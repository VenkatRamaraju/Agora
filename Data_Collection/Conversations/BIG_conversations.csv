"looks to me, volume was nearly double today after yesterday's high volume, as though shortys are trying to keep the stock down but may have reached a floor with continued good news and 28% of float now short.I'm looking for at least 5% up over the next week. trim and repeat."

$1.20 dividend ÷ $55 stock price = 2% return. Better than any online banks and as secure.
It’s nice to see the stock keep going up rather than sell off in the morning after a big rise! But it will go back down again eventually and that will be time to buy again￼￼
"Same scenario always plays out after earnings. Regardless the blowout earnings each quarter for four now, there will be selloff for a few days and ultimately hit new high and then retreat a little. So one can anticipate it will play out the same was to have a down day today and probably early next week with buying coming in late week. Some are playing it like clockwork."
Can someone please explain why this stock keeps getting clobbered? There's nothing negative in the news.
"So, they sold distribution center because they needed cash. Otherwise .18C loss as opposed to .16C loss as analyst expected. Same store sales decline. Lowered guidance for Q4 than analyst expectation. Real winner. Like I said, $15 here we come. Look out below!"
"As earnings report date approaches, it looks as though theTrend is slow and steady growth I would appreciate any thoughts/opinions regarding Big Lots taking a nose dive around the earnings date, as it will be positive news, yet Big Lots stock seems to be manipulated more often than not,,,"
Margins so thin / extreme discounting has begun from all there competitors so they will miss there numbers by a huge amount next quarter JC PENNY 2.0 THIS IS A VALUE TRAP
Big Lots is down 5.49% to 54.67
Disappointing day to say the least. You would have expected a much bigger pop based on the earnings beat.
I love big going to go there today! 1.20 dividend woot. undervalued.
Surprised that this is down but it's early in the trading session. Also possible that the lack of a stimulus deal is putting some strain on retail stocks.
anybody know the earnings date? Yahoo has tonight...nasdaq friday...and others have it listed for june1...anyone?
wow is big lots stock cheap. less than 8x earnings and returning $100MM to shareholders this year via div and buyback. 3-5 year investment you will make 40% total return minimum.
"I day traded this today, but for a better ROI, I went long in OSTK instead of this (BIG) much better upside potential"
Dividend appears to be safe longer term. Holders will hold and buyers will buy for the most part. OMO
Too late to get in before earnings? It’s up 14% over the last week.
Real traders sold at $50 ON friday then jumped into BBIG at 6.50 this morning. #BIG
why is it not going up?
time to sell.. this will close at 22
Market is going down once again... Does it mean Big Lots will go higher once again since the stock always rise when the market is down...
should they buy sears?
Time to buy
"I used to enjoy shopping at big lots, but the last few times I can't find anything I wanted at those prices. The 5 year stock long term graph trend is really scary."
"Why big should be $80 sooner than later, low float, insanely low PE and updating all stores and great fast delivery."
"I'd like to be enthusiastic about this big move up today but the volume is not there and I'm going to remain only cautiously optimistic that this is the start of a bigger trend. This has been a weird stock to follow for the past month. It seems to make some big moves without much volume and with no news, so it's hard to know what's driving it."
Next stop $55...
Buy?
Big Lots is up 6.46% to 49.25
"Go BigPros: Strong well managed company and strong earnings report a head,,Not a “Robin Hood” stock- trend driven.Is a Consumer sector stock, poised for growth in uncertain times/Holiday season approaching Ready for a real breakthrough in to the 60’s. Biden or Trump?Doesn’t matter,,,When the stimulus bill finally passes, whether now, or in February-Will give Big a boost-Big Lots knows its place in the grand scheme of things,and that’s ok with me"
"with all corona virus going on. Costco, and other grocery price will go up. This stock is a BUY"
$BIG Target Lowered by Bank of America Outperform » Underperform USD 50 » USD 45 Target Lowered by Loop Capital Hold USD 60 » USD 50
A close above $47.32 (the 50 day moving average) should trip more buy signals.
Buy a ton of this into earnings. If it tanks on earnings then double down
Is the stimulus check announcement going to make any difference to this stock?
"Avg. Down if your down but don't sell for a loss. Don't sell Period! This is how we fight a class war. We can win this. I'm with you in the deep red, but that will be $Big green$ if we stay in this."
tomorrow big ..like dollar tree
"Thinking about averaging down. The only thing I find wrong is lower guidance, so I guess the big boys are shying away from the stock for now. At some point they will come back in and I want to be ahead of them."
Where is early january update on sales...
BIG way down just like 0LLI￼￼
I was looking to exit in the mid 40's thinking that 10x this year's earnings would be a good exit point. Estimates have jumped. I now think I will take profits in the 50 range (10x next year's earnings). Actually I hope they are able to buy some shares at the current price which will help boost EPS and probably boost my exit point higher.
The companies that have taken $big funding with bad deals so far are companies that know that somebody else has a much better vaccine. Who could that be?
"Unreal, market has been opened 12 minutes and volume is already 1.5 times normaldays' trade over past three months. Shorts having fun. No way was this earnings report bad enough to deserve 13% haircut."
Like to buy a retailer before Christmas. This year I'm going with a very oversold Big lots.
"Two reasons to not get excited about companies buying back shares.1--- How many times do you see a company buy back shares and see the stock a year later less than where shares were purchased? ----wasted cash 2---- Company will buy back shares to try and make it look like EPS are better than they are. Why, because there are less shares to divide by for next earnings report. That is why you have to look at balance sheet to see how many shares were outstanding this quarter verses last. To be fair when a company buys back shares and retires them they don't have to pay dividends on them. Always look at gross revenues."
"5% buyback & 29% float short, low sales ratio, no exposure to trade war= stock at new 52 week low... why not"
"Buy 100 shares of $BIG between now and 12/14 and get a $30 rebate on 12/30/20. I got my order in, doubt it will get filled at my bid price. LOL"
"Doing research on Big Lots: at a glance, it seems to be a very well managed company with record breaking earnings in recent quarter. But why is it only trading at 2.5x P/E?Their current debt seems a big high compared to cash on hand, haven’t done a thorough research yet.Thanks!"
At some point this becomes a buy. Just need new ideas in mgmt
"Jim Cramer says there are activists in the stock, which is usually a good thing, they are probably responsible for financial decisions like the store lease buybacks - which increase the earnings each quarter. Jim Cramer did not seem too enthusiastic about the stock due to the investor activists . He said once the activists leave he said watch out￼. That’s way too little information to make a decision on￼. He is not giving full disclosure!"
"I don't mind the pause and retracement. Although it would be nice for $BIG to go higher (and it looks like it will), it has had a pretty nice move in the right direction today that it needs to consolidate before going higher. Looking forward to management providing improved guidance when this uptrend begins to fade. See you all at $57. GLTYA"
time to buy. buy low.
This is 2.40 PE. Low P/E multiples are good base indicators that the company is undervalued. also with great dividend. the stock is prob being being shorted to take options money.
Every time I go to our local Big Lots they are very busy. They seem very progressive with internet promotions and correspondence. Why is stock not moving?
"BIG posted the largest gains in Global Rank, up 1,617 positions, an indication, in our view, that BIG's accelerated Store of the Future remodels paid off just in time for peak holiday season."
"Wow, hope they finish off last year's buyback here and announce a new one. Been a great year !!! Last August they announced 500 million buyback. Unlike some companies they have used it. Think they could take out another 4 million shares before earnings..."
Big Lots Appoints Gurmeet Singh as Chief Technology Officer
"Get ready to go a lot higher , BIG should go ex dividend on Dec 13 2019 based on history."
Fun to watch calls increase in real time...
2x the average daily volume and recovered most of this morning's drop. May even finish the day positive.
"Bought in at $46. Regretting I did. Saw plenty of news articles saying this was a great value stock, time to buy, whatever. Nothing but sell off every day since I bought. I guess I shouldn't believe a word I read. Seems every time I get into a stock because of analyst opinions and news articles I lose. Seems like the good news articles are nothing more than a sales pitch to get the losers to buy in while the big money is selling off. I'm hoping to break even now."
BigUp BIG todayBought during recent ‘dips’Let’s see if the momentum trending upward will continue Go Big
All in at $45.30. I think the MM is allowing the stock to drop for the stock buyback. Repurchased 2.2M shares at $45.81 last quarter????? The only time it was the share price was that low was just after last earnings report last quarter. The share price should bounce back just like last quarter. Load up now IMO.
I'll bet we finish green today. IMHO
This was down today because there was a rotation out of the Covid stocks and into other stocks such as Macy’s￼
"no way to panic, just bought more"
This company has been taken behind the wood shed and pounded. Look at the balance sheet way over sold. Last earnings report looked very reasonable compared to peers. Companyhas stated it's buying back shares. From 64 to 42 makes no sense at all. BUY
HIGH ALERT !The following 2 weeks of september is the worst stock sell-off / every year....see below new before too late to sell next week !https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html
"Buy buy buy BIG before it rocket up 30%...One company value investors might notice is Big Lots (BIG). BIG is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 8.99. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 25.46. BIG's Forward P/E has been as high as 12.42 and as low as 6.94, with a median of 8.83, all within the past year.Investors will also notice that BIG has a PEG ratio of 0.80. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. BIG's industry currently sports an average PEG of 2.37. Over the past 52 weeks, BIG's PEG has been as high as 3.78 and as low as 0.63, with a median of 1.04.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Big Lots is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, BIG sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks"
Options expired today
Big is way over sold
"They had an extra 20% off your entire purchase this past weekend. It was not one of their “Friends and Family” scheduled events. Happening late in the month, just before the end of the quarter, they are trying to make the month and quarter anyway they can, even losing margin."
"I'm all in and holding what I got. There is a lot of pressure in $BIG and stocks in general right now. End of year tax selling (last week), Stimulus, Guidance. Still betting $BIG will cross $50 before next earnings."
People buy this company because of its solid financials. You're dreaming of there will be any significant short squeeze. This is a buy and hold for the dividend and pension funds see that too.
"Where are all the articles about how BIG is at all time highs while extremely undervalued with amazing profits, debt, PE & PEG etc.? When the articles do show up, its usually after the big money has already bought in, telling us how much of a buy it is."
"Frankly, estimated Q4 EPS of $2.40-$2.50 sucks. To be honest, this is lower than where they said they were tracking against Q4 on the last earnings call. At that time they said early Q4 results were showing ""low double digit gains"". So 10% up from $2.39 = $2.63. The fact that results are now projected even lower is just poor. I think we can expect Q4 earnings to come in around $2.55, so they can post a beat against revised estimates in February.Sadly, the stock is likely going nowhere but down from yesterday's high, even though the sector has been hot over the last week. Unless there is some great strategy conveyed at the ICR conference that the investment banking community embraces, I think it will be some time before we sniff $50/share.I hope to be wrong. Still a good long term investment with the dividend, but likely not a high growth stock in 2021."
"Agreed w Danny too !CAUTION !THE BAD NEWS below from CNBC yesterday saying :History is not on the market’s side with the S&P 500 averaging a 0.4% decline for September, the worst of any month, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac. Friday in particular begins a historically weak period for stocks as those September losses typically come in the back half of the month."
"Their customer count is down every year in every store, they have to keep raising prices every week and they fired(restructured) hundreds of their managers. Go into a store and they have 3 employees running it. Why it's so easy to steal there. I wonder where the next CEO will cut to keep making it look like they are making money?"
"Bought in just now at 22.06. To those asking what the difference between Oliie's and this is - Ollies is valued at 4 times more than BIG even after it fell 27% today. BIG makes 4 times more revenue than them and slightly better earnings. This is undervalued, and Ollie's is still overalued after losing a quarter of its market cap today."
Too bad we couldn't hold in 46 but it's a start. I still think we saw the bottom yesterday.
Use SA to look at their previous two reports. They said at the start of the year 2019 was going to be a great year for them and they raised the FY guidance. Every quarter since they beat earnings and went up YUGE. Same story this time round
"@Rob, nothing wrong with $DG, but with a P/E of 23.66, it's kinda expensive. If $BIG had the same P/E with it's current earnings, $BIG share price would be $147..... AND ....- In the past 12 months $BIG has more that doubled (up +125%), $DG is up only 37%- $BIG pays a dividend of 2.26%, $DG only 0.66%$BIG may stay under valued and $DG over valued, but my bet is that they won't. $BIG share price could DOUBLE from it's current level and still be less expensive than $DG. For the Risk/Reward I'm a buyer of $BIG. Added more to my position under $52 on the dip. Buy the dips IMHO. GLTY"
"Hold on guys, it is just a shake out , so week hands drop their shares and after this big jump up."
opening position in BIG with Target price if 54 within 3 months or less . this stock is waiting for an execuse to run above 50
"Beat earnings and here is the dividend info.COLUMBUS, Ohio, Dec. 6, 2019/ PRNewswire/-- Big Lots, Inc. announced today that on December 4, 2019 the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per common share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.. The dividend will be paid on December 30, 2019, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 16, 2019.. About Big Lots, Inc. Headquartered in Columbus, Ohio, Big Lots, Inc. is a discount retailer operating 1,421 BIG LOTS stores in 47 states with product..."
Manipulation until close to earnings and upside really BIG.
Extremely positive recent news. Look at their chart. I’m buying...then buying more. Thanks shorts!
If BIG would be trading somewhere around 105-140 I would consider it to be fair but 70 simply does not make sense
Two weekends in a row doing 20% off promotion. End of fiscal year in a week. Not optimistic that 4th quarter will meet or beat expectations.
"Ive been digging through this company for a few weeks. I'm getting DCF and PE valuations between $120 - 200. I'm thinking what is throwing people off for one is that sale-leaseback of Distribution Centers. They Sold their DCs in order to shore up some liquidity for whatever Covid may do, but it turns out they crushed revenue all year so they paid down their LT Debt with the proceeds and bought back $100MM shares. They've had a cash position of approximately $60MM for the past ten years. They are now at about $900MM - I'm buying this dip and waiting for mean reversion"
"Buyback , borrow for a bigger buyback ! This year is toast. Gear up for next year..."
"Re: federal stimulus. Even without direct stimulus checks to individuals, the stimulus will still inject a lot of money into the economy, such as through enhanced federal unemployment benefits. It'll be a good thing for BIG."
BIG has a PE of 2. It’s competitors have a PE around 24. Should the price of BIG be 12 times higher? The institutions think it will get BIG soon. Low volume on up day.
"Let's see how they support with the buy back money they have set aside. There is still plenty of that left. Now is the time for them to come in and support heavy, if they themselves believe in the longer term strategy."
"BIG FANS - If you want to make 50K in a few days with literally no downside, buy BIG after 1-2 down days, next day it will go back up by same ratio, sell and next day it will sell off 1-2 days and then repeat. I have done this for last 18 trading days to benefit from 8 buy and sell to the tune of $58K .... its like someone is playing this thing up and down in same continual range ............... Really wierd as by rights this should have retreated below $50 or risen in high $70. Check the charts yourself."
"Well, it isn't that bad.Conversely, I see lots of growth with the company with lots of stores coming up.I think it's oversold. Give it another day or two, this thing will be back to $48."
Buy signal for BIG was on 1-8-21. Price target is $55
will this EVER go above 46 again?
If this stock hits 43.41 my sl gets touched& im out $600 Hope the short sellers choke on their Christmas meals
"With all the upgrades, share buyback, $.30 dividend paid September 25th, we could go up 20% from here. Institutions love BIG."
know how you know you got a great investment! when the market is down 900 and you make profit! love Big lots !!
"low debt, good sales, low PE. this is a great stock to own. fair market value according to gurus focus is $400"
Wondering if the Market Maker for BIG was/is keeping the share price down the last couple days for the buyback. High volume and low share price just doesn't make sense with better guidance and improved earnings. BIG has a P/E of 2.45 with peers having 22 -24 P/E ??Bought more at the open today. Go BIG.
"A stock with a PR at 3 paying decent dividend, while announcing positive outlook with such low share price? Best valued stock to own. With the PE expansion to 5, this will be a $80 stock and is still undervalued. Earnings should be in early March, I believe and we see firework!"
"$55 by Christmas, anyone?"
BIG stock pays 2-1/2% dividend. This is the best place to park your savings money for the next two years.
Bruce says they can buy at the open mkt. Buy buy buy...
"great dividend, undervalued this it's truly a great opportunity. added some more today."
Biggest news for Big Lots outside of China trade deal: Universal Postal Union agreed today (9/25/19) to allow the US to raise terminal fees as high as they want. Ebay will take a HUGE hit and Dollar Stores and Big Lots type discounters will take a tremendous amount of those sales. Estimates are that international postal rates to mail from China to the US could go up as much as 600%. Forget all the Chinese stuff for $1 on Ebay when the postage costs $6. People will go to actual stores and pay $3 for it instead of $1 plus $6 postage.
No doubt about Big’s successful business formula...it’s working very well. An overdone sell-off because management justifiably refrained from giving guidance during a worsening pandemic has now created a bargain. Especially since they’ve done great even during these crazy times. I just doubled my position. See you soon back at above $52.
Looks like $BIG could be setting up for a nice move up.- Way oversold- PSAR indicator about ready to change to BUY- 23.5% short interest- If we could get a trend reversal followed by good guidance $BIG could make a quick move upIMO GLTYA
Squeeze? 107% ownership + In the money calls significantly outnumber puts...
"Big Lots posted comparable-store sales growth of 3.4%, toward the high end of the company's guidance of 2% to 4%, which drove total revenue up 3.6% to $1.15 billion, edging out estimates at $1.14 billion. Am I mistaken? That was very positive"
Let’s spend millions on a new HQ with tons of amenities instead of investing in the stores. The former HQ was designed to be expanded however the former CEO wanted it to be near his home in the affluent New Albany area. Where was the board of directors?
The store is comparable to a Dollar General on steroids.No real bargains these days.
"Jeff, I'm with you on your analysis. I have 1000 shares at 45.42 and had expected upward movement sooner than now, and am not real happy with how long it's taking to trend upward, but I can be patient. One thing I worry about is that this stock seems to be owned almost all by institutions and the price must be subject to some manipulation. But in the months ahead, it does seem that BIG can have a lot of upside so I'm sticking it out for now."

"December 07, 201811:33 am ET... CFRA Maintains Strong Buy Opinion on Shares of Big Lots, Inc.(BIG 30.9*****): We cut our 12-month target by $7 to $42, a forward P/E of9.2X our NTM EPS estimate of $4.59, below the historical three-year forward P/Eaverage. We lower our FY 19 (Jan.) EPS estimate to $4.31 from $4.50 and FY20’s to $4.75 from $4.85. BIG posts Oct-Q adjusted loss per share of$0.16 vs. $0.06, missing consensus. Sales climbed 3.5% to $1.2 billion, beatingconsensus. Gross margin narrowed 10 basis points to 39.9%, meeting consensus.That said, we believe today’s 20% drop in shares is an over-reaction tonear-term results and an under-estimation of optimistic prospects for profitablefuture reinvention. We view Oct-Q as a transition quarter for BIG and the mostchallenging from a P&L point of view, as BIG prepares for peak holidays andaccelerates store fleet optimization. We underline that comp store salesincreased 3.4%, beating consensus and representing BIG’s best quartercomp in nearly 27 quarters, an indication, in our view, that Store of theFuture remodels are paying off. /Camilla Yanushevsky"
"The fact that management still has not provided Q4 guidance as promised is disconcerting as companies tend to release goods news quickly and bad news slowly. Also the Barclays downgrade today from equal weight to underweight with a price target of $42, on top of the JP Morgan cut from $55 to $53, does not bode well for near term share pricing. Barclays cited poor 4th qtr. deals on electronics and high toy inventories as reasoning for projecting poor 4th qtr. results. This can all turn on a dime if BIG is able to release Q4 EPS projections above $3.00, but the longer it takes to release the news, the less likely the news is going to be good. Of course, apart from Q4 results which might miss the consensus estimate, the stock is still hugely undervalued and great longer term investment.Hopefully we will get positive early Q4 guidance from BIG very soon."
BIG intrinsic value with EPS of 6 --> conservative estimate $100. http://www.moneychimp.com/articles/valuation/buffett_calc.htm. Time to buy.
"BIG, the company spent millions today buying shares and trying to prop this up.That's why there were well over 10,000,000 shares traded, It's going to have to spend a lot more in the coming weeks doing the same because, the EARNINGS ARE TERRIBLE.!!There's no way to hide how bad they were and BIG is not going to be BIG long. Do you think they're going to rally from here?WHY would anyone invest in this???"
One of the WORST stocks that I ever purchased.
"The ""thrill of the hunt"" has left Big Lots! Too many planagrams, too many imports from China. The ""closeouts"" have moved to Ollie's and Bargain Hunt. Most pantry items are priced the same as Kroger's, Mejiers, etc. There is a reason that they don't publish customer counts. It decreases year after year (from an insider)."
"I am compelled to give my “Opinion” on BIG.. as I have 1700Shares of this stock, and bought insome time ago at $48.I am struggling with the to hold on, or maybe losing what patience I had based on this stocks lackluster track record...Yet, I read from various sources-So as not to have a bias outlook as to the future of this particular stock.I have yet to find/hear about any real downside with BIG..anywhere from $60-$70 range-Target.I am frustrated with the manipulation that occurs when all the positive-factual data/info comes out from the mgmt. of this company, as the share values are trending upwards, then in the same day, drop in a dramatic decline- only to continue the pattern over time.I have no doubt of the successful growth that has or will continue to occur- but one would think that that would be reflected in the company’s actual stock, that many of us are investing in, based on all these prevailing factors etc.When is BIG going to break out?Reward the hard working people that are vested in this company and aren’t looking for a quick buck, but real consistent positive results.Value investors, for a supposed value stock.I am now waiting to recoup my initial investment- then get off thisBIG merry-go-round of mediocrity and hearing the empty words- from these so-called experts touting!,this company,,, that in my opinion Is never going to be a money maker for the long investor."
"FWIW, Technically, hope $BIG closes above the 50 day moving average, the up trend should continue."
Earnings moved to a Friday. Fridays are the best days for bad news. Happenstance?
In the short term anything is possible. This is a bear raid. They are after your shares. This is a small cap and susceptible to manipulation.
Whoof. I need a shower!
Economy is on its way to slowing down. BIG will thrive in a recessionary environment
"this stock is shorted 33%, institutions own 101%. volume is low because not retail investors, now imagine if this became the next gamestop"
Somebody explain why have this great stock been downgraded?
Here we go! Starting to look good to go up soon.....Zacks ranks a #1 strong buy. Fundamentals are great....EPS 7.05
Most encouraging part of quarterly report is BIG has paid down debt and has no long term debt issues. Very few companies are in this position. Publix is another one.
Reason it’s going up: I sold all my shares this morning. This thing immediately starting climbing
"For what it's worth. Positives outweigh Negatives which are temporary COVID-19 related. IMOPositives:+ Sales increase of approximately 7.5%+ Ecommerce demand quarter-to-date is up approximately 135%+ acceleration in trends in January and, for the quarter as a wholeNeutral, longer term positive:+/- repurchase of approximately 1.2 million shares+/- $344 million remaining under a $500 million share repurchaseNegatives:- adverse freight impact as a result of transportation- additional expenses related to Covid-19"
So this company is dying for no reason?
"Unbelievable with guidance significantly higher and ended the day in minus corner, down four bucks from the high. It surely be back up, but says a lot how shorts can manipulate share price of small stocks."
who knows why pre-market -2.84% ?
The sales must be online because the two stores close where I live are empty
"The sound of positive drum beats continues to get louder and short interest drops another 60K. The question is, when will the short squeeze begin -- not if?

"Well Finally I am on the “green side” for now anyway Any solid intel on the pps ceilingfor this stock/time frame etc.,would appreciate ure comments"
BIG earnings around December 4th. Will we surpass $57 this month?
Just saying I don't understand this stock.... solidly beats earnings but now down 15% since reporting.
Bought 100 shares today to get the dividend
Dividend cut in half but still averaging over 2%.
look at chart it goes down after earnings until X day than is baaaam time to buy today Monday is the day bottom for today could be now don't know this is a great stock
This stock has earnt my attention. Looks VERY cheap. Thinking of buying before earnings.
Must be some concern over lack of stimulus bill and the unemployment numbers. It's ok. We're in a holding pattern until we get some positive news to start BIG back on the uptrend.
"don't sell your shares, https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/big/analyst-research"

nice move by BIG today on above-average volume. I like it.
"I am going to hold. Really, not too bad given all that is going on."
I picked up another 250 shares yesterday! Earning have been confirmed to be $2.54. Go BIG or stay home!
"BIG looks like it record best in the history of the brand, which is powered by good in-store and online results. Likewise, this next company has compelling reasons to consider. Here: https://shr.link/ThermalDroneTech"
Probably one of the best value stocks out there on the market to buy into:PE = 3EPS = 17.5Record cash flows being generated.Return on capital 25%Management consistently buying back shares and stock has a track record of consistently beating EPS forecasts.Even pays a dividend to put the icing on the cake.
"What you do on a day like today is buy more shares. Especially with a good earnings report. A stimulus bill will get passed before too long.￼ As they say, be greedy when others are fearful. This is how you make money."
"BigLots stock is trading at six month low, and 13.8% cheaper to buy. Dividend date is coming up. As supply chain woes get better, the BIG retailer has a lot to gain."
"Big Lots is presenting at the (virtual) ICR conference this week on Wednesday, 1/13 from 9:30-10:25. This is a large conference event with all of the major investment banks. I would expect BIG to release their promised Q4 earnings estimates either in advance of this conference, or at this conference. My expectation is either tomorrow before markets open, or more likely after they close. If for some reason they do not provide these estimates either tomorrow or Wednesday, then I believe there is good reason to believe that the numbers are subpar - well under the $2.99 consensus EPS estimate. Hopefully the estimates will be strong. I truly believe any estimate over $3.00/share and the stock gaps up over $50/share."
"I'll take big over gme and amc anyday. It's actually a great, profitable, dividend-paying, company and is ridiculously cheap compared to it's peers, even after today's runup."
Can’t wait to see how BIG the earnings are on August 28th. Will BIG be valued at a higher PE than 6 and a higher stock price per share like $75?
"In this upcoming week (or the following week at the very latest) we can expect early guidance from BIG on Q4 results as promised on the last earnings call. Projections above $3.00/share and the stock gaps up, under $2.50/share and the downward trajectory likely continues. Last week investors were betting on weak Q4 projections - hopefully they will be proven wrong.Also, if Dems happen to win the GA Senate race, BIG is likely to decline with all stocks. History shows that markets do best when neither party controls all 3 - House, Senate, Presidency. Thus Dems winning both Senate seats would spark some measure of selloff in my opinion."
Time to go up again. Woohoo
"Remember, earnings are in 2 weeks. The 17.5 puts are highly active. Sell while u can, anything above 20! This is going below 17 for a short while, then will resume it’s upward movement to mid 20s"
went down after last quarter also. waiting for another buy in point to average down a little more. Solid company
Buying before earnings is fool’s errands. Bad earning report Will easily drop it to the 20s and a good earnings will drop price by MM for at least 5 bucks. Smart thing to do is to sell now and buy back later.
Everything is good Market overreaction
I was hesitant to buy call options on DLTR and DG which both would of paid out nicely overnight. BIG looks like the next one to follow suit but I'm hesitant once again because i shop at big lots even before the pandemic and they are always empty.Not to mention its already at it's 52week high practically. Anybody want to weigh in?
How are not more investors excited about big? Do people even look at financials?
OLLI plummeting! Does not bode well for BIG￼
"Does a 20%share buyback mean we go up 20% from here, maybe 10 points or more if the shorts have to cover?"
BIG is 108% owned by institutions.Can’t wait for earnings tomorrow.
Big Lots is up 6.03% to 69.25
buying for 50 k now
Bidenomics working miracles across the country! Yeahhh!
"Temporary dividend hype. Did anyone read the full report? Guidance flat. Earnings lower than 2018. 2018 @ $4.04, 2019 est $3.70-$3.80. Don’t hold too long into the dividend hype. Probably going back to $15."

"went the other day to a store. New Broyhill looks good but overpriced. Bought the same sofa on Wayfair.com for $150.00 less. Seems there MU% on furniture is too high. 50-60% MU on that category is a disaster!. Also looked at some other accessory's etc. Not impressed. They are a discounter not a department store. Walmart works on an average of 25% in the hard home category! Not 50-60%. All department stores that have or had that 50-70%IMU are GONE!!!!! JCP, Sears, Pier1, At Home, Tuesday Morning, etc. There only one way to pay your bills,,,, with sales not margins!! I'll take 30% of $100 million($30 million) versus 50% of $25 million($12.5 million). And that's how the upper management at Big Lots feels,,,, Margins don't pay the bills,,,,,, sales do!!"
"Big Lots stock sinks toward 7-month low after profit and sales miss, surprise loss outlook for current quarter. Not good"
If we get a new Stimulus Package this week will BIG go back up?
"Bought shares for 40 k, Big is over sold"
Time to BUY!
Great guide higher today + stock buyback! Going higher. Ignore the shorts.
I'm actually considering margin...
I love my BIG stock! look how well it's holding on a 670 point drop. yahoo analyst target 57.22 buy. and great dividend.
"Big Lots (BIG), which saw a positive improvement to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating on Tuesday, with an upgrade from 88 to 91. The company holds the No. 1 rank among its peers in the Retail-Discount & Variety industry group."
"Up over 4 bucks now over $60! Should hit all time high of $67 this week. With 28% shares shorted, shorts will be hurt seriously. Shorting a stock with increasing earnings and revenue and a PE of 3.7. Can’t fathom such rationale for shorting this one. On top of all the progress, this stock even pays a nice dividend."
"Why doesn't anything good like this EVER happen to stocks I have held for nearly a YEAR! Examples....KSS, KHC, FB, MCD, ANAB....need I go on? Have had decent earnings.....I think I am about to just give up! RAISE fed rate so I can return back to safe and sound CDs!!!! Fed rate should AT LEAST be up 1.5 points...dwumpf econ my axe!"
"Markets up big today, and this POS is making record lows. Hello, new 52 week low. Goodbye money. Unbelievable."
I believe this is a good entry point. Taking a position here!
"Huh. Blew the doors off, no? Had 3.5k but just bought 1.5k more in pre market."
"The bigger the fall today, the bigger the jump tomorrow after great earnings"
Officially part of the group. 500 shares at 46.98.. wait for the stimulus to roll out
I will be happy when BIG is at $75 Jeffreys Price Target or bought out near there.Another 50% return from here. The institutions are in it to win it...
"There you go, we are taking off!$55 soon, guys?"
"Okay so I don't know how earnings can be good and most of the discount retailers had bad 4th quarters. Today's Zack's article sounds like its pumping the stock up but then reads: ""For the fiscal year ending January 2020, this discount retailer is expected to earn $3.81 per share, which is a change of -5.7% from the year-ago reported number."" If you notice every time the stock drops someone puts out another publication that really has no depth to it. Its being pumped to get back years of losses...."
Big volume imminent...
Bought 2000 shares today.
Somethings up. Why is it dropping so much on a thousand point gain in the DOW
Very nice Bull flag setting up on the monthly chart.
There are still quite a few stores that have not been remodeled into what the call “Store of the Future”. We will see very shortly how 4th quarter and fiscal year 2019 sales report. They definitely have some dumpy stores left out there.
"Three stocks that look like bargains compared to their peers right now are Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), Big Lots (NYSE:BIG), and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Investors could set themselves up for some great long-term returns by investing in these companies today."
"Big needs a CEO and a head merchant that know what they are doing. There needs to be a house cleaning starting with Bruce and Lisa. Morale in the stores, where payroll has been slashed is very bad."
Where do we go from here ? I bought a bit more....
Big lots is a tenant of mine. their sales have doubled since the pandemic
Closed above $50 today just like I had predicted. 
I think you will get a lot more for your shares I would not be selling them this cheap. Looks like Wall Street wants shares If you need to sell go ahead but at least do it with call option where you can get more for your shares. Just my take someone want shares and is buying them up
"The market is starting to actually digest the news. They missed consensus estimates by analysts. The business still looks strong underneath. And......they sent a HUGE signal, as I mentioned below. ""We still have $344 mil for stick buy back (wink wink)."""
it has only 35m outstanding shares. shorted 19%. Its forward PE is only 10. and give out divident.
price consolidationing beautifully between 36 and 40. Bull flag pattern on the charts. Coiled and ready to pop. 42+ by the end of the week. Anticipating more upgrades this week.
"They are about to buyback a quarter of the company and people are giving it to them at a discount lol. I knew earnings wouldnt be enough to boost the stock but with a P/E of 7 and at an 8% discount with the buyback added in, this is really starting to look tasty. Like the company literally just said they want to buy back $500 M(a quarter of their MC) and you want to sell it back at a discount because you want in or out of some fomo play? that makes no sense to me but what do I know, I've just been bullish on this since its run down from 25 to 11 earlier this year"
"Dividend increase please, less than 10% payout with plenty of cash left after good earnings like this quarter, time to pay up boys"
I was in too high on this and got out yesterday in premarket. Buying again and holding long. I believe in this company. I don’t believe in the bears who really are making decisions despite what the company is doing.
buying today on 50 k
sell at the bell doesn't look like an earnings beat to me
"There was a guy here predicting $2.50-$2.55 a share about a month ago. He (or she) was right, but also said stock would have hard time getting over $50. That was proven not true. There was also a guy (gal?) here who suggested buying under $50 and selling when over $50. That worked well for me. Company seems very undervalued to me today at $58, so I'm buying more shares today."
"All last night I was having a nightmare that I was having a colonoscopy and I didn't know why, Now I know why. I don't think I've ever seen a stock with such a low PE ratio and a company that makes such a high level of profit to be considered grossly overvalued in the way BIG LOTs, Inc. is."
"Volume is too low to make a big fluctuation on the price movement, be it up or down. :("
"Keeps going down. Ughhhh, how are they doing with products? Heard more container problems and empty shelves in some stores"
Did I miss something? Up over a $1 today. What's happened between yesterday and today?
great opportunity for a swing trade. low $48 seems to be the sweet spot to get in. Will be waiting a little longer to make a move. I'm find with getting in at a higher price if it means more strength.
Beat!!
I’m getting in when it goes down to 46 today
"What is with this stock, down 20 points in less than a month ... SERIOUSLY BIG Management !!! Get you act together or get new jobs .."
Jeffreys has a price target of $75.
"Its funny: every time I pay attention to Zacks's recommendation, that stock goes 180 degrees in opposite direction!"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-lots-named-1-total-174700954.html
"If BIG crosses $55 and hold above it, it will surge over $60"
its way way oversold here and a miss is already factored in so any good news and its back to 32-35
Hope BIG LOTS earnings on August 28 are 4 times what is expected. Jeffreys $75 price target may be sooner than later. How many shorts must cover?
Must be expecting good news at the ICR conference tomorrow.
Does anybody has ideas about tomorrow? Will we grow?
"This is NOT over reaction with the guidance of loss next quarters. This will hit the low of the year to under $40 in a few days, if not today. Move out and buy other promising stocks. You can always come back at the end of the year selloff during loss harvesting time."
"BIG is going to do very well going forward with the unfortunate resurgence of the virus leading to reversal of business opening and consumers’ reluctance to go shopping. Its new internet marketing, just started, will bring in even more shoppers. BIG is on its way as being in the right place at he right time with increasing focus on its operations by the management. Still a under noticed stock and being lumped together with other retailers in distress. BIG will continue to grow fast with earnings surprising to Wall Street. I foresee its share price rivals that of HD at some point in the next 18 months. One of the best hidden value in the market now. The overall over-priced stock market will pull back due to numerous problems in the economy and social unrest, BIG may pull back a bit along with the whole market down, that’s the time to buy or add big time before its value is recognized and share price goes up reflecting such awareness."
"Moved up another 3% pre-market after its upward movement already in the past few days. Those naysayers and shorts will be mightily disappointed.How one can short this one with increasing earnings and revamping of its operations to not only challenge the brick and mortar stores, but into the internet format is beyond me really. BIG is paying a healthy dividend, priced at very low PE with increased sale indicating a very under-valued stock. The recent appointment of a technology expert to its executives will add more to its forward movement. Will be over $80 by the yearend and at three digit price next year."
"The only reason I found for the PE ratio of big is the unusual gain last year from sale of a property. However, upon looking back several years, I also noticed historical low PE. I couldn’t find another reason, could anyone?"
Is this a short squeeze!!!
I wonder if the mass layoffs that are being reported from this week will affect stock price
"This company is struggling. Their inventory monitoring system is a joke, buyers are clueless of what sells, logistics is a cluster.. etc. etc. If you can't track your merchandise you cannot properly manage it. This causes customer service issues as well. The company needs to decide if it is going to be a closeout discount retailer or a retailer who sells some items at a discount and pray its furniture sales and understaffed underpad labor force to reduce overheard will carry it. I see trouble on the horizon. I foresee that this company closing its doors in the next 3 to 5 years if they do not address their flawed inner structures as the store level cannot keep bailing corporate miss management out no matter how many CEOs they go through."
With such a big run up it’s trading 15x normalized earnings. YTD has been awesome but the street knows that’s not permanent. Being labeled essential was a gift. It’s great they packed their balance sheet with cash and will be buying back stock but the share price won’t rocket higher any time soon. Should be slow EPS gains moving forward thanks to the buybacks.
I wish I could just own the whole company.
Kroger buying big lots?
"What am I not understanding about the market reaction and press on this stock.This morning, MarketWatch said that it jumped 2.7% premarket, apparently overlooking the ""minus"" sign.The articles say that this is an overpriced stock. I read one of them last night and it talked about how low the PE ratio was and all of the great fundamentals of the stock before concluding that it's ""overpriced."" No clue on that conclusion unless it's somehow the thing to say.A great earnings report sends the stock down substantially.I'm a newbie, so please educate me on this one."
$10 to $15 today
"All the manipulation in BIG from the big drops to burning the shorts . Most the time turns a stock into just a trading stock , because it trains the shareholders to take the profits and run before they are gone , We will know for sure if BIG can hold the gains all the way to the ex dividend and how big the drop is after the ex dividend , Does no good to have a great gain then give $3-4 back after the ex dividend date. Time will tell if Big has just become another trading stock or not . But for sure every long holder is now wondering if they should sell before the ex dividend date or not. Because they are not sure after all the manipulation that has been taking place."
Wonder when will Big Lots initiate shares buy back...
BIG LOTS is currently trying to buy back about a tenth of its stock. They stop when the price goes up and will begin to buy after it goes back down. It seems to have support mid 40s.
Time to move up...
"Typical “sell the news” with blowout earnings and revenue announced! With the $500 million buyback shrinking 20% share count, BIG should be a $80 stock minimum. Will get there soon enough. In the meantime, enjoy the $1.20 dividend while you wait!"
looking for $60 tomorrow on earnings.. 50/200MA both around $60 as well
"It looks like Big Lots is getting very good, bullish press the last couple days (from Investopedia and Simply Wall St) pointing $BIG's very low P/E and the 2.58% dividend being sustainable. Also pointing out $BIG share price is 52% below estimated fair value. Anyone else read the articles? Any thoughts? Really looks great heading into 2021. GLTY"
Buying calls now for next week
I sold my small position short but bought calls bc it seems oversold for a good earning and corporate confidence
"When I was a kid in the early 90's we had a big lots in our town, it was mostly junk. I went to a Big Lots for the first time about a year ago in our town, and to be honest, its become a solid retail store. I was very impressed with what they offered and the prices. Much better experience and improved product offerings from what I could recall from 25 years past. Needless to say, when the stock dropped last March I was in with a large portion of our savings. This store is miles ahead of Dollar Tree, Family Dollar etc. at least from my perception as an average consumer."
"Seriously though, this company has retained earnings over 3 times its current market cap. it earned its entire current valuation in profit in the last 24 months. It pays a dividend ffs! if you dont see room for BIG growth over the next year we must be reading different financials."
