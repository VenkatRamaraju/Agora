"Keeps going down. Ughhhh, how are they doing with products? Heard more container problems and empty shelves in some stores"
"No long term debt, great ROIC, nimble mgmt. I went by one today and it closed for 5 weeks for remodeling, painters were in."
"It 's way undervalued should buy more and more quickly before the train leaving its station,"
Just loaded 5.7k more on BIGas it's a BUY rating today.
Still 101% ownership and 17% short interest - This one gonna run...
"Waiting for more cash to clear would love to have 2000 shares with a $50 average price. #big dreams, #not selling, #take that short stacks"
Does anyone know the status of the buy backs by BIG? How many millions of dollars do they have left to use?
WOW
Extra billion for DLTR buybacks going to help float all boats. Looks like we're going over 50 today...
"I checked the website, checked out a store. Most everything they sell outside of food is destined for a landfill within a year or so. Good stuff for areas with hurricanes and natural disasters. If it blows up you didn't lose anything of value. It was going in the trash anyways."
Great day to buy more shares with the Piper downgrade.
$55 BY THE END OF THIS MONTH AT LEAST !!!!!!!!!!!
Does anybody have any thoughts on why we were down 5 bucks a share yesterday? The only thing I can think of is Dollar Tree is getting in to selling some items over a dollar so that might hurt business at Big Lots. I wonder though if shoppers at Dollar Tree will be turned off by some items being over a dollar and head to Big Lots for shopping?
Squeeze? 107% ownership + In the money calls significantly outnumber puts...
"All-Smarter people than me predicted this. #OPTIONS. Next week, this will be a distant bad dream. I just purchased another 300 shares. We know October and November are our months. #ATH. #BIG BROTHER EU. #WESTERN MARKET EUAs."
Happy to join. Management is accelerating share buy backs. Weâ€™re at a very good support level. Stock is very cheap at these levels. Looking forward to holding this one for a while! Have a great weekend all!
Most encouraging part of quarterly report is BIG has paid down debt and has no long term debt issues. Very few companies are in this position. Publix is another one.
NEXT STOP : $50 FOR SURE....
Some good put volume at 57.50. Compare that to the call volume between 49.6 (current price) and that number...
BIG 's Big BUYING OPPORTUNITY today...a SCREAMING BUY !!!!!!!!!!
