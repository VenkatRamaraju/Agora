"don't sell your shares, https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/big/analyst-research"
went down after last quarter also. waiting for another buy in point to average down a little more. Solid company
Can someone please explain why this stock keeps getting clobbered? There's nothing negative in the news.
Does anybody has ideas about tomorrow? Will we grow?
"Unbelievable with guidance significantly higher and ended the day in minus corner, down four bucks from the high. It surely be back up, but says a lot how shorts can manipulate share price of small stocks."
"Moved up another 3% pre-market after its upward movement already in the past few days. Those naysayers and shorts will be mightily disappointed.How one can short this one with increasing earnings and revamping of its operations to not only challenge the brick and mortar stores, but into the internet format is beyond me really. BIG is paying a healthy dividend, priced at very low PE with increased sale indicating a very under-valued stock. The recent appointment of a technology expert to its executives will add more to its forward movement. Will be over $80 by the yearend and at three digit price next year."
A close above $47.32 (the 50 day moving average) should trip more buy signals.
Buy a ton of this into earnings. If it tanks on earnings then double down
"Let's see how they support with the buy back money they have set aside. There is still plenty of that left. Now is the time for them to come in and support heavy, if they themselves believe in the longer term strategy."
Extra billion for DLTR buybacks going to help float all boats. Looks like we're going over 50 today...
"Huh. Blew the doors off, no? Had 3.5k but just bought 1.5k more in pre market."
"Buy buy buy BIG before it rocket up 30%...One company value investors might notice is Big Lots (BIG). BIG is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 8.99. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 25.46. BIG's Forward P/E has been as high as 12.42 and as low as 6.94, with a median of 8.83, all within the past year.Investors will also notice that BIG has a PEG ratio of 0.80. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. BIG's industry currently sports an average PEG of 2.37. Over the past 52 weeks, BIG's PEG has been as high as 3.78 and as low as 0.63, with a median of 1.04.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Big Lots is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, BIG sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks"
Great day to buy more shares with the Piper downgrade.
"With all the upgrades, share buyback, $.30 dividend paid September 25th, we could go up 20% from here. Institutions love BIG."
"As earnings report date approaches, it looks as though theTrend is slow and steady growth I would appreciate any thoughts/opinions regarding Big Lots taking a nose dive around the earnings date, as it will be positive news, yet Big Lots stock seems to be manipulated more often than not,,,"
"I checked the website, checked out a store. Most everything they sell outside of food is destined for a landfill within a year or so. Good stuff for areas with hurricanes and natural disasters. If it blows up you didn't lose anything of value. It was going in the trash anyways."
Like to buy a retailer before Christmas. This year I'm going with a very oversold Big lots.
"BIG posted the largest gains in Global Rank, up 1,617 positions, an indication, in our view, that BIG's accelerated Store of the Future remodels paid off just in time for peak holiday season."
"$55 by Christmas, anyone?"
I wonder if the mass layoffs that are being reported from this week will affect stock price
One of the WORST stocks that I ever purchased.
Does anyone know the status of the buy backs by BIG? How many millions of dollars do they have left to use?
Margins so thin / extreme discounting has begun from all there competitors so they will miss there numbers by a huge amount next quarter JC PENNY 2.0 THIS IS A VALUE TRAP
"Doing research on Big Lots: at a glance, it seems to be a very well managed company with record breaking earnings in recent quarter. But why is it only trading at 2.5x P/E?Their current debt seems a big high compared to cash on hand, haven’t done a thorough research yet.Thanks!"
"I don't mind the pause and retracement. Although it would be nice for $BIG to go higher (and it looks like it will), it has had a pretty nice move in the right direction today that it needs to consolidate before going higher. Looking forward to management providing improved guidance when this uptrend begins to fade. See you all at $57. GLTYA"
"BigLots stock is trading at six month low, and 13.8% cheaper to buy. Dividend date is coming up. As supply chain woes get better, the BIG retailer has a lot to gain."
"Waiting for more cash to clear would love to have 2000 shares with a $50 average price. #big dreams, #not selling, #take that short stacks"
Two weekends in a row doing 20% off promotion. End of fiscal year in a week. Not optimistic that 4th quarter will meet or beat expectations.
Most encouraging part of quarterly report is BIG has paid down debt and has no long term debt issues. Very few companies are in this position. Publix is another one.

I love my BIG stock! look how well it's holding on a 670 point drop. yahoo analyst target 57.22 buy. and great dividend.
"I'll take big over gme and amc anyday. It's actually a great, profitable, dividend-paying, company and is ridiculously cheap compared to it's peers, even after today's runup."
BIG earnings around December 4th. Will we surpass $57 this month?
Is this a short squeeze!!!
"This is NOT over reaction with the guidance of loss next quarters. This will hit the low of the year to under $40 in a few days, if not today. Move out and buy other promising stocks. You can always come back at the end of the year selloff during loss harvesting time."
"They had an extra 20% off your entire purchase this past weekend. It was not one of their “Friends and Family” scheduled events. Happening late in the month, just before the end of the quarter, they are trying to make the month and quarter anyway they can, even losing margin."
"FWIW, Technically, hope $BIG closes above the 50 day moving average, the up trend should continue."
I'll bet we finish green today. IMHO
Fun to watch calls increase in real time...
Wondering if the Market Maker for BIG was/is keeping the share price down the last couple days for the buyback. High volume and low share price just doesn't make sense with better guidance and improved earnings. BIG has a P/E of 2.45 with peers having 22 -24 P/E ??Bought more at the open today. Go BIG.
$55 BY THE END OF THIS MONTH AT LEAST !!!!!!!!!!!
I was hesitant to buy call options on DLTR and DG which both would of paid out nicely overnight. BIG looks like the next one to follow suit but I'm hesitant once again because i shop at big lots even before the pandemic and they are always empty.Not to mention its already at it's 52week high practically. Anybody want to weigh in?
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-lots-named-1-total-174700954.html
"I'd like to be enthusiastic about this big move up today but the volume is not there and I'm going to remain only cautiously optimistic that this is the start of a bigger trend. This has been a weird stock to follow for the past month. It seems to make some big moves without much volume and with no news, so it's hard to know what's driving it."
Big volume imminent...
anybody know the earnings date? Yahoo has tonight...nasdaq friday...and others have it listed for june1...anyone?
"went the other day to a store. New Broyhill looks good but overpriced. Bought the same sofa on Wayfair.com for $150.00 less. Seems there MU% on furniture is too high. 50-60% MU on that category is a disaster!. Also looked at some other accessory's etc. Not impressed. They are a discounter not a department store. Walmart works on an average of 25% in the hard home category! Not 50-60%. All department stores that have or had that 50-70%IMU are GONE!!!!! JCP, Sears, Pier1, At Home, Tuesday Morning, etc. There only one way to pay your bills,,,, with sales not margins!! I'll take 30% of $100 million($30 million) versus 50% of $25 million($12.5 million). And that's how the upper management at Big Lots feels,,,, Margins don't pay the bills,,,,,, sales do!!"
All in at $45.30. I think the MM is allowing the stock to drop for the stock buyback. Repurchased 2.2M shares at $45.81 last quarter????? The only time it was the share price was that low was just after last earnings report last quarter. The share price should bounce back just like last quarter. Load up now IMO.
The companies that have taken $big funding with bad deals so far are companies that know that somebody else has a much better vaccine. Who could that be?
I believe this is a good entry point. Taking a position here!
Just loaded 5.7k more on BIGas it's a BUY rating today.
HIGH ALERT !The following 2 weeks of september is the worst stock sell-off / every year....see below new before too late to sell next week !https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html
Biggest news for Big Lots outside of China trade deal: Universal Postal Union agreed today (9/25/19) to allow the US to raise terminal fees as high as they want. Ebay will take a HUGE hit and Dollar Stores and Big Lots type discounters will take a tremendous amount of those sales. Estimates are that international postal rates to mail from China to the US could go up as much as 600%. Forget all the Chinese stuff for $1 on Ebay when the postage costs $6. People will go to actual stores and pay $3 for it instead of $1 plus $6 postage.

Dividend cut in half but still averaging over 2%.
I wish I could just own the whole company.
BIG LOTS is currently trying to buy back about a tenth of its stock. They stop when the price goes up and will begin to buy after it goes back down. It seems to have support mid 40s.
"Wow, hope they finish off last year's buyback here and announce a new one. Been a great year !!! Last August they announced 500 million buyback. Unlike some companies they have used it. Think they could take out another 4 million shares before earnings..."
"BIG, the company spent millions today buying shares and trying to prop this up.That's why there were well over 10,000,000 shares traded, It's going to have to spend a lot more in the coming weeks doing the same because, the EARNINGS ARE TERRIBLE.!!There's no way to hide how bad they were and BIG is not going to be BIG long. Do you think they're going to rally from here?WHY would anyone invest in this???"
it has only 35m outstanding shares. shorted 19%. Its forward PE is only 10. and give out divident.
"I'm all in and holding what I got. There is a lot of pressure in $BIG and stocks in general right now. End of year tax selling (last week), Stimulus, Guidance. Still betting $BIG will cross $50 before next earnings."
Buying before tomorrow
"All-Smarter people than me predicted this. #OPTIONS. Next week, this will be a distant bad dream. I just purchased another 300 shares. We know October and November are our months. #ATH. #BIG BROTHER EU. #WESTERN MARKET EUAs."
"They are about to buyback a quarter of the company and people are giving it to them at a discount lol. I knew earnings wouldnt be enough to boost the stock but with a P/E of 7 and at an 8% discount with the buyback added in, this is really starting to look tasty. Like the company literally just said they want to buy back $500 M(a quarter of their MC) and you want to sell it back at a discount because you want in or out of some fomo play? that makes no sense to me but what do I know, I've just been bullish on this since its run down from 25 to 11 earlier this year"
"Hold on guys, it is just a shake out , so week hands drop their shares and after this big jump up."
Earnings moved to a Friday. Fridays are the best days for bad news. Happenstance?
"Agreed w Danny too !CAUTION !THE BAD NEWS below from CNBC yesterday saying :History is not on the market’s side with the S&P 500 averaging a 0.4% decline for September, the worst of any month, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac. Friday in particular begins a historically weak period for stocks as those September losses typically come in the back half of the month."
"Up over 4 bucks now over $60! Should hit all time high of $67 this week. With 28% shares shorted, shorts will be hurt seriously. Shorting a stock with increasing earnings and revenue and a PE of 3.7. Can’t fathom such rationale for shorting this one. On top of all the progress, this stock even pays a nice dividend."
"Big Lots stock sinks toward 7-month low after profit and sales miss, surprise loss outlook for current quarter. Not good"
Buy signal for BIG was on 1-8-21. Price target is $55
"The fact that management still has not provided Q4 guidance as promised is disconcerting as companies tend to release goods news quickly and bad news slowly. Also the Barclays downgrade today from equal weight to underweight with a price target of $42, on top of the JP Morgan cut from $55 to $53, does not bode well for near term share pricing. Barclays cited poor 4th qtr. deals on electronics and high toy inventories as reasoning for projecting poor 4th qtr. results. This can all turn on a dime if BIG is able to release Q4 EPS projections above $3.00, but the longer it takes to release the news, the less likely the news is going to be good. Of course, apart from Q4 results which might miss the consensus estimate, the stock is still hugely undervalued and great longer term investment.Hopefully we will get positive early Q4 guidance from BIG very soon."
"Bought shares for 40 k, Big is over sold"
Dividend appears to be safe longer term. Holders will hold and buyers will buy for the most part. OMO
"Keeps going down. Ughhhh, how are they doing with products? Heard more container problems and empty shelves in some stores"
look at chart it goes down after earnings until X day than is baaaam time to buy today Monday is the day bottom for today could be now don't know this is a great stock
great opportunity for a swing trade. low $48 seems to be the sweet spot to get in. Will be waiting a little longer to make a move. I'm find with getting in at a higher price if it means more strength.
Whoof. I need a shower!
Every time I go to our local Big Lots they are very busy. They seem very progressive with internet promotions and correspondence. Why is stock not moving?
Reason it’s going up: I sold all my shares this morning. This thing immediately starting climbing
opening position in BIG with Target price if 54 within 3 months or less . this stock is waiting for an execuse to run above 50
2x the average daily volume and recovered most of this morning's drop. May even finish the day positive.
Still 101% ownership and 17% short interest - This one gonna run...
"Ive been digging through this company for a few weeks. I'm getting DCF and PE valuations between $120 - 200. I'm thinking what is throwing people off for one is that sale-leaseback of Distribution Centers. They Sold their DCs in order to shore up some liquidity for whatever Covid may do, but it turns out they crushed revenue all year so they paid down their LT Debt with the proceeds and bought back $100MM shares. They've had a cash position of approximately $60MM for the past ten years. They are now at about $900MM - I'm buying this dip and waiting for mean reversion"
"BIG FANS - If you want to make 50K in a few days with literally no downside, buy BIG after 1-2 down days, next day it will go back up by same ratio, sell and next day it will sell off 1-2 days and then repeat. I have done this for last 18 trading days to benefit from 8 buy and sell to the tune of $58K .... its like someone is playing this thing up and down in same continual range ............... Really wierd as by rights this should have retreated below $50 or risen in high $70. Check the charts yourself."
Big Lots is up 6.46% to 49.25
LOOP CAPITAL just came in with a BUY rating on BIG and price target of $230! Only 39 million shares outstanding...Long and and strong.
"What am I not understanding about the market reaction and press on this stock.This morning, MarketWatch said that it jumped 2.7% premarket, apparently overlooking the ""minus"" sign.The articles say that this is an overpriced stock. I read one of them last night and it talked about how low the PE ratio was and all of the great fundamentals of the stock before concluding that it's ""overpriced."" No clue on that conclusion unless it's somehow the thing to say.A great earnings report sends the stock down substantially.I'm a newbie, so please educate me on this one."
Just saying I don't understand this stock.... solidly beats earnings but now down 15% since reporting.
"Buyback , borrow for a bigger buyback ! This year is toast. Gear up for next year..."
"Big Lots posted comparable-store sales growth of 3.4%, toward the high end of the company's guidance of 2% to 4%, which drove total revenue up 3.6% to $1.15 billion, edging out estimates at $1.14 billion. Am I mistaken? That was very positive"
know how you know you got a great investment! when the market is down 900 and you make profit! love Big lots !!
"It 's way undervalued should buy more and more quickly before the train leaving its station,"
NEXT STOP : $50 FOR SURE....
BigUp BIG todayBought during recent ‘dips’Let’s see if the momentum trending upward will continue Go Big
Is the stimulus check announcement going to make any difference to this stock?
I love big going to go there today! 1.20 dividend woot. undervalued.
"this stock is shorted 33%, institutions own 101%. volume is low because not retail investors, now imagine if this became the next gamestop"
Great guide higher today + stock buyback! Going higher. Ignore the shorts.
This was down today because there was a rotation out of the Covid stocks and into other stocks such as Macy’s￼
"The bigger the fall today, the bigger the jump tomorrow after great earnings"
"What you do on a day like today is buy more shares. Especially with a good earnings report. A stimulus bill will get passed before too long.￼ As they say, be greedy when others are fearful. This is how you make money."
There are still quite a few stores that have not been remodeled into what the call “Store of the Future”. We will see very shortly how 4th quarter and fiscal year 2019 sales report. They definitely have some dumpy stores left out there.
At some point this becomes a buy. Just need new ideas in mgmt
$10 to $15 today
Probably one of the best value stocks out there on the market to buy into:PE = 3EPS = 17.5Record cash flows being generated.Return on capital 25%Management consistently buying back shares and stock has a track record of consistently beating EPS forecasts.Even pays a dividend to put the icing on the cake.
Did I miss something? Up over a $1 today. What's happened between yesterday and today?
"All the manipulation in BIG from the big drops to burning the shorts . Most the time turns a stock into just a trading stock , because it trains the shareholders to take the profits and run before they are gone , We will know for sure if BIG can hold the gains all the way to the ex dividend and how big the drop is after the ex dividend , Does no good to have a great gain then give $3-4 back after the ex dividend date. Time will tell if Big has just become another trading stock or not . But for sure every long holder is now wondering if they should sell before the ex dividend date or not. Because they are not sure after all the manipulation that has been taking place."
"No long term debt, great ROIC, nimble mgmt. I went by one today and it closed for 5 weeks for remodeling, painters were in."
No doubt about Big’s successful business formula...it’s working very well. An overdone sell-off because management justifiably refrained from giving guidance during a worsening pandemic has now created a bargain. Especially since they’ve done great even during these crazy times. I just doubled my position. See you soon back at above $52.
"Get ready to go a lot higher , BIG should go ex dividend on Dec 13 2019 based on history."
BIG 's Big BUYING OPPORTUNITY today...a SCREAMING BUY !!!!!!!!!!
"This company is struggling. Their inventory monitoring system is a joke, buyers are clueless of what sells, logistics is a cluster.. etc. etc. If you can't track your merchandise you cannot properly manage it. This causes customer service issues as well. The company needs to decide if it is going to be a closeout discount retailer or a retailer who sells some items at a discount and pray its furniture sales and understaffed underpad labor force to reduce overheard will carry it. I see trouble on the horizon. I foresee that this company closing its doors in the next 3 to 5 years if they do not address their flawed inner structures as the store level cannot keep bailing corporate miss management out no matter how many CEOs they go through."
"Remember, earnings are in 2 weeks. The 17.5 puts are highly active. Sell while u can, anything above 20! This is going below 17 for a short while, then will resume it’s upward movement to mid 20s"
Does anybody have any thoughts on why we were down 5 bucks a share yesterday? The only thing I can think of is Dollar Tree is getting in to selling some items over a dollar so that might hurt business at Big Lots. I wonder though if shoppers at Dollar Tree will be turned off by some items being over a dollar and head to Big Lots for shopping?
"Dividend increase please, less than 10% payout with plenty of cash left after good earnings like this quarter, time to pay up boys"
BIG way down just like 0LLI￼￼
"BIG looks like it record best in the history of the brand, which is powered by good in-store and online results. Likewise, this next company has compelling reasons to consider. Here: https://shr.link/ThermalDroneTech"
Extremely positive recent news. Look at their chart. I’m buying...then buying more. Thanks shorts!
"For what it's worth. Positives outweigh Negatives which are temporary COVID-19 related. IMOPositives:+ Sales increase of approximately 7.5%+ Ecommerce demand quarter-to-date is up approximately 135%+ acceleration in trends in January and, for the quarter as a wholeNeutral, longer term positive:+/- repurchase of approximately 1.2 million shares+/- $344 million remaining under a $500 million share repurchaseNegatives:- adverse freight impact as a result of transportation- additional expenses related to Covid-19"
"Maybe these dudes bottomed , maybe they get some stuff to sell from China. Ports jammed. Need supply chains to losen. With inflation maybe more people shop big lots. ?"
"I am compelled to give my “Opinion” on BIG.. as I have 1700Shares of this stock, and bought insome time ago at $48.I am struggling with the to hold on, or maybe losing what patience I had based on this stocks lackluster track record...Yet, I read from various sources-So as not to have a bias outlook as to the future of this particular stock.I have yet to find/hear about any real downside with BIG..anywhere from $60-$70 range-Target.I am frustrated with the manipulation that occurs when all the positive-factual data/info comes out from the mgmt. of this company, as the share values are trending upwards, then in the same day, drop in a dramatic decline- only to continue the pattern over time.I have no doubt of the successful growth that has or will continue to occur- but one would think that that would be reflected in the company’s actual stock, that many of us are investing in, based on all these prevailing factors etc.When is BIG going to break out?Reward the hard working people that are vested in this company and aren’t looking for a quick buck, but real consistent positive results.Value investors, for a supposed value stock.I am now waiting to recoup my initial investment- then get off thisBIG merry-go-round of mediocrity and hearing the empty words- from these so-called experts touting!,this company,,, that in my opinion Is never going to be a money maker for the long investor."
"Big Lots is presenting at the (virtual) ICR conference this week on Wednesday, 1/13 from 9:30-10:25. This is a large conference event with all of the major investment banks. I would expect BIG to release their promised Q4 earnings estimates either in advance of this conference, or at this conference. My expectation is either tomorrow before markets open, or more likely after they close. If for some reason they do not provide these estimates either tomorrow or Wednesday, then I believe there is good reason to believe that the numbers are subpar - well under the $2.99 consensus EPS estimate. Hopefully the estimates will be strong. I truly believe any estimate over $3.00/share and the stock gaps up over $50/share."
"The only reason I found for the PE ratio of big is the unusual gain last year from sale of a property. However, upon looking back several years, I also noticed historical low PE. I couldn’t find another reason, could anyone?"
"BIG is going to do very well going forward with the unfortunate resurgence of the virus leading to reversal of business opening and consumers’ reluctance to go shopping. Its new internet marketing, just started, will bring in even more shoppers. BIG is on its way as being in the right place at he right time with increasing focus on its operations by the management. Still a under noticed stock and being lumped together with other retailers in distress. BIG will continue to grow fast with earnings surprising to Wall Street. I foresee its share price rivals that of HD at some point in the next 18 months. One of the best hidden value in the market now. The overall over-priced stock market will pull back due to numerous problems in the economy and social unrest, BIG may pull back a bit along with the whole market down, that’s the time to buy or add big time before its value is recognized and share price goes up reflecting such awareness."
Happy to join. Management is accelerating share buy backs. We’re at a very good support level. Stock is very cheap at these levels. Looking forward to holding this one for a while! Have a great weekend all!
"@Rob, nothing wrong with $DG, but with a P/E of 23.66, it's kinda expensive. If $BIG had the same P/E with it's current earnings, $BIG share price would be $147..... AND ....- In the past 12 months $BIG has more that doubled (up +125%), $DG is up only 37%- $BIG pays a dividend of 2.26%, $DG only 0.66%$BIG may stay under valued and $DG over valued, but my bet is that they won't. $BIG share price could DOUBLE from it's current level and still be less expensive than $DG. For the Risk/Reward I'm a buyer of $BIG. Added more to my position under $52 on the dip. Buy the dips IMHO. GLTY"
WOW
"Temporary dividend hype. Did anyone read the full report? Guidance flat. Earnings lower than 2018. 2018 @ $4.04, 2019 est $3.70-$3.80. Don’t hold too long into the dividend hype. Probably going back to $15."
"Jeff, I'm with you on your analysis. I have 1000 shares at 45.42 and had expected upward movement sooner than now, and am not real happy with how long it's taking to trend upward, but I can be patient. One thing I worry about is that this stock seems to be owned almost all by institutions and the price must be subject to some manipulation. But in the months ahead, it does seem that BIG can have a lot of upside so I'm sticking it out for now."
"Where are all the articles about how BIG is at all time highs while extremely undervalued with amazing profits, debt, PE & PEG etc.? When the articles do show up, its usually after the big money has already bought in, telling us how much of a buy it is."
"Well, it isn't that bad.Conversely, I see lots of growth with the company with lots of stores coming up.I think it's oversold. Give it another day or two, this thing will be back to $48."
This is 2.40 PE. Low P/E multiples are good base indicators that the company is undervalued. also with great dividend. the stock is prob being being shorted to take options money.
"December 07, 201811:33 am ET... CFRA Maintains Strong Buy Opinion on Shares of Big Lots, Inc.(BIG 30.9*****): We cut our 12-month target by $7 to $42, a forward P/E of9.2X our NTM EPS estimate of $4.59, below the historical three-year forward P/Eaverage. We lower our FY 19 (Jan.) EPS estimate to $4.31 from $4.50 and FY20’s to $4.75 from $4.85. BIG posts Oct-Q adjusted loss per share of$0.16 vs. $0.06, missing consensus. Sales climbed 3.5% to $1.2 billion, beatingconsensus. Gross margin narrowed 10 basis points to 39.9%, meeting consensus.That said, we believe today’s 20% drop in shares is an over-reaction tonear-term results and an under-estimation of optimistic prospects for profitablefuture reinvention. We view Oct-Q as a transition quarter for BIG and the mostchallenging from a P&L point of view, as BIG prepares for peak holidays andaccelerates store fleet optimization. We underline that comp store salesincreased 3.4%, beating consensus and representing BIG’s best quartercomp in nearly 27 quarters, an indication, in our view, that Store of theFuture remodels are paying off. /Camilla Yanushevsky"
price consolidationing beautifully between 36 and 40. Bull flag pattern on the charts. Coiled and ready to pop. 42+ by the end of the week. Anticipating more upgrades this week.

Big Lots Appoints Gurmeet Singh as Chief Technology Officer
"A stock with a PR at 3 paying decent dividend, while announcing positive outlook with such low share price? Best valued stock to own. With the PE expansion to 5, this will be a $80 stock and is still undervalued. Earnings should be in early March, I believe and we see firework!"
Bruce says they can buy at the open mkt. Buy buy buy...
"Go BigPros: Strong well managed company and strong earnings report a head,,Not a “Robin Hood” stock- trend driven.Is a Consumer sector stock, poised for growth in uncertain times/Holiday season approaching Ready for a real breakthrough in to the 60’s. Biden or Trump?Doesn’t matter,,,When the stimulus bill finally passes, whether now, or in February-Will give Big a boost-Big Lots knows its place in the grand scheme of things,and that’s ok with me"
"Seriously though, this company has retained earnings over 3 times its current market cap. it earned its entire current valuation in profit in the last 24 months. It pays a dividend ffs! if you dont see room for BIG growth over the next year we must be reading different financials."
If BIG would be trading somewhere around 105-140 I would consider it to be fair but 70 simply does not make sense
Everything is good Market overreaction
Some good put volume at 57.50. Compare that to the call volume between 49.6 (current price) and that number...
"Typical “sell the news” with blowout earnings and revenue announced! With the $500 million buyback shrinking 20% share count, BIG should be a $80 stock minimum. Will get there soon enough. In the meantime, enjoy the $1.20 dividend while you wait!"
$1.20 dividend ÷ $55 stock price = 2% return. Better than any online banks and as secure.
OLLI plummeting! Does not bode well for BIG￼
I'm actually considering margin...
Time to BUY!
Can’t wait to see how BIG the earnings are on August 28th. Will BIG be valued at a higher PE than 6 and a higher stock price per share like $75?
In the short term anything is possible. This is a bear raid. They are after your shares. This is a small cap and susceptible to manipulation.
Bought 2000 shares today.
looking for $60 tomorrow on earnings.. 50/200MA both around $60 as well
Squeeze? 107% ownership + In the money calls significantly outnumber puts...
"The ""thrill of the hunt"" has left Big Lots! Too many planagrams, too many imports from China. The ""closeouts"" have moved to Ollie's and Bargain Hunt. Most pantry items are priced the same as Kroger's, Mejiers, etc. There is a reason that they don't publish customer counts. It decreases year after year (from an insider)."
"It looks like Big Lots is getting very good, bullish press the last couple days (from Investopedia and Simply Wall St) pointing $BIG's very low P/E and the 2.58% dividend being sustainable. Also pointing out $BIG share price is 52% below estimated fair value. Anyone else read the articles? Any thoughts? Really looks great heading into 2021. GLTY"
Bidenomics working miracles across the country! Yeahhh!
With such a big run up it’s trading 15x normalized earnings. YTD has been awesome but the street knows that’s not permanent. Being labeled essential was a gift. It’s great they packed their balance sheet with cash and will be buying back stock but the share price won’t rocket higher any time soon. Should be slow EPS gains moving forward thanks to the buybacks.
