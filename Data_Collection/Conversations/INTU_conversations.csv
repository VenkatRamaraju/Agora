"Nobody has figured out the multiplying effects of adding Intuit × Credit Karma x Mailchimp = $5,000!"
"Thinking about new acquisitions, WIX, LSPD, BILL, AFRM, SOFI. Feeling like Intuit going to make some moves, next 12 months! cash is piling up!"
Intuit reached an all time high at 610.38
Intuit and Credit Karma is multi Trillion dollar Monster on the Rise!
All in for post earnings rise to $555.
The March to $800 has resumed!
"Intuit is PRINTING MONEY!!! Intuit just bought the LA Clippers a new Basketball stadium! Intuit Dome, CEO is spending money like a boss."
"Filling the gap or the specialists need to get themselves good with expiration or somebody big wants some shares as cheap as possible. About to get back into my earnings play but I now own some INTU core shares. Whether it is three minutes or three trading days, we will see the stock hgigher from here."
"The new CEO is a smart guy, but shares are worth about high 300s to low 400 range currently. Too much optimism is baked into the stock currently, so caution is warranted."
"Hmmmmm. Markets/economies squeezing the hell out of small/medium biz. That means squeezing our margins. That means squeezing equity/pps. That means squeezing... US! Thats a lot of squeezing. I hope I'm wrong, and that increased scale retains (improves?) bottom line, but...???"
I heard about INTU the other day on (http://Fairstox.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
What do long-term investors of SHOP think about $INTU becoming a formidable competitor to Shopify? Shop has been trailing the Nasdaq since Intuit announced it's plans to acquire Mailchimp during the summer.
1000$ by end of year
"Suspect after bottling out @ 499, we will climb right back into the high 500s. This is a blip on the screen, @ xmas time, when we will be Hoovering @ 550"
INTU the moon. Noone care for the unemployed files.
"Mailchimp confirmed, what a vision to merge the marketing platform into Its portfolio"
"Goodrazi says he started talking with Mailchimp about a potential transaction last year, and that Mailchimp then hired an investment banker and created a competitive bidding process. He says Mailchimp chose to accept the offer from Intuit despite the fact that it was not the highest bidder. How AWESOME is Goodrazi??? This guy has more vision and charisma than anyone else in Silicon Valley."
"Probably be trading in the range of 570 to 590, during September. Buy at this level, and make some moola. A sure thing. M"
"Intuit Agrees to Buy Mailchimp for About $12 Billion!!! Huge! Was getting nervous this deal was not going to get done. Intuit is going to become a Emarketing Giant!!! Credit Karma is going get Intuit to one billion, Mailchimp will get them over 2 billion!!"
"Intuit gets new $645, price target! Still way below my $800, price target!"
"Intuit Introduces Money by QuickBooks, Mobile Banking Designed for Small Businesses! Intuit keeps evolving at warp speed!"
Yes I feel your pain. It is sickening that a company crushes and does everything right yet the stock still goes down. Such manipulation
Intuit in Talks to Buy Mailchimp for More Than $10 Billion! Really like the pivot into Digital Marketing! Intuit might get to Trillion even faster than a speeding bullet!
"Long for over five years. Intu does not disappointment me at all. The dividend keeps growing and the stock keeps performing well. Glad to have it in my portfolio. If you play short, time your buys/sells well, and good luck to you."
Intuit is acting really really strong!
"Intuit Ventures Launches to Accelerate Innovation for Early and Growth Stage Small Business and Consumer Fintech Companies!!! How awesome is Intuit under, CEO Sasan Goodarzi? Pretty, Pretty Awesome!"
Probably picks up $40-43 tomorrow keeping the multiple about right. If it’s a sideways day it may gain additional momentum as the hottest movers tend to get exaggerated. It looks like it may settle in around $600 over the next week. Honestly nobody on here is considering opening a short position. Market is pricing in curve reversal. Leave intuit to smart money. If you need a short try OCGN ( just picking from a lot of dirty dogs I occasionally short after hype pops)
"On the conference call, Intuit is now talking about the integration of TurboTax & KreditKarma. They already have been experimenting with this integration & intend to drive it much further. Driving margin leverage by becoming more & more of a software company. Margin expansion was already occurring back in 2019 before the Covid-19 outbreak. Later."

"The talks between Mailchimp and Intuit, if true, make a lot of sense from the angle that both companies share the same customers...small and medium size businesses. There is a lot of marketing synergy to cross sell each other's customer base. It also gives MC an advantage over their competitiors....even Shopify and Amazon, because neither AMZN or SHOP are into the bookkeeping side of business - as far as I am aware. AS far as the $10B price tag, it is probably a reasonable price to pay 10:1 X earnings (MC is a privately owned company, but their last known annual earnings was around $750M and that was a few years ago). I would guess that MC will continue to be based in Atlanta, and they could very well keep thier name - at least for a while. What really makes this deal so good for both companies is that MS's recent entry into e-commerce was moderatley successful and Intuit has the customer base, size and scale to jump start that area in a big way."
"Fantastic 4th quarter, very strong full year, great guidance, this is well above expectations on every count!"
I think we may have hit the top here.
"Man, I guess that I don't understand the stock market! Great earnings and great guidance! Analyst PT boost up to 640. Despite that the stock is sold off! What's this puzzle??"

Will this split?
"Breaking Intuit news: Four INTU price target increases on the wires so far this morning: Barclay's, Jeffries, JP Morgan & Piper Sandler ~ whose analysts were all congratulating Intuit in the conference call. Two robust price target increases were from JP Morgan [$530 to $630] & Piper [$498 to $621]. I would normally not be posting this until 0715; but I am already loaded to the gills with INTU so I will share the wealth. Big of me, eh? LOL"
