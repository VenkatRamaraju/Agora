"Time for me to join the party. QR #3 will be great. Why? Many tax laws are changing, New software to buy or update."
"The numbers tell a story, and the story the tell is INTUIT is worth $800 a share! Intuit is CRUSHING IT."
"Breaking Intuit news: Four INTU price target increases on the wires so far this morning: Barclay's, Jeffries, JP Morgan & Piper Sandler ~ whose analysts were all congratulating Intuit in the conference call. Two robust price target increases were from JP Morgan [$530 to $630] & Piper [$498 to $621]. I would normally not be posting this until 0715; but I am already loaded to the gills with INTU so I will share the wealth. Big of me, eh? LOL"
Intuit in Talks to Buy Mailchimp for More Than $10 Billion! Really like the pivot into Digital Marketing! Intuit might get to Trillion even faster than a speeding bullet!
Wow! Amazing quarter! Intuit is must own stock for the next decade! With new leadership this stock should soar to epic heights! Which company has the most valuable data in the world? IT IS INTUIT!
I added today on the dip. Earnings were very good! Stock will be over $170 in 2018.
Great great SHORTING Opportunity of a lifetime here. This puppy is heading down a good 20-30% from here. They are losing thousands of long term customers by the hour as I write. The IRS Turbotax Stimulus Check fiasco is affecting millions. Intuit Management is completely asleep at the switch. The class action lawsuits could run into the millions. Just in time for tax season. Turbotax's franchise value is being obliterated.
Maybe the best stock in America. Significant growth anticipated.
"Watch out soon the computers will start selling, Keep buying need to hold it up or the computers will kick in and start selling INTU"
"Raising my 12 month price target to over $1,000!!! Insane Numbers!!!"
I'm loading more now
"In the CNBC interview, the CEO said the lowered guidance was due to them shifting some expenses to build out their live support offerings for Turbotax to be available and used throughout the whole tax season. Sounds like a reasonable explanation. He also said they have really good insight into the consumer and economy since they can see things like how many employees are being hired by their customers etc and it all looks strong right now. Along with the top and bottom line beats, stock sounds like a Buy to me."
"Earning seem to have been muted by market fears...should be higher, but it might even drop tomorrow. That is what theThat ket does."
Most seem to be completely neglecting the fact that there has been an influx of retail investors this past year. I imagine that there are going to be far fewer individuals using the cheaper or free versions of Turbotax for 2020.
"The new CEO is a smart guy, but shares are worth about high 300s to low 400 range currently. Too much optimism is baked into the stock currently, so caution is warranted."
"$NLOK For Intuit ($INTU) to be valued at 73.08B (or more than 10.24x sales), Autodesk ($ADSK) at 40.39B (or 12.3x sales), and Adobe ($ADBE) at 177.60B (or 15.23x sales), compared with NLOK's 50M direct subscribers and 12B valuation (2.4x sales) makes $NLOK a strong buy.CreditKarma, which helps consumers monitor their credit, was acquired by $INTU for 7B (or 7x sales)."
INTU the moon. Noone care for the unemployed files.
Wow! Impressive!!!
"intu is a gem. we all know that when the world ends, the accountants still need to close out the book. this is one of the best stock to own for ur retirement."
"like INTI, but way too expensive for my taste. Buyer at $150 and below."
DOWN TO 255 LEVEL TODAY AS BIG GUIDANCE MISS BRINGS MORE PAIN TO LONGS AS I COVER FROM 271.40
"Alert! If market did not sell off, Intuit would have traded over $350 on earnings, business momentum, and Credit Karma purchase!!!"
Sold today for a big gain. Thank you very much Intuit!
"Looks like I sold all my shares and it's still going higher , Just didn't want to be holding it with all the tax chances and how bad it might hurt INTU sense it's still the major part of the business"
"Looks like they just doubled the share count with the SEC filing now at 200% of target, Might just be getting ready to dump some shares into the market"
Tomorrow is their earnings are they expected to do good ?
I heard about INTU the other day on (http://Fairstox.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Suspect after bottling out @ 499, we will climb right back into the high 500s. This is a blip on the screen, @ xmas time, when we will be Hoovering @ 550"
"Sold my shares today at 443, gonna buy back when it drops"
How low is INTU going to drop when the stock market tanks? Do you thing it will drop below $70? it is coming
"Intuit Ventures Launches to Accelerate Innovation for Early and Growth Stage Small Business and Consumer Fintech Companies!!! How awesome is Intuit under, CEO Sasan Goodarzi? Pretty, Pretty Awesome!"
Folks thinking of selling here must not be aware of options straddle which suggests a close near $578 tomorrow for the 8/26 options expiration. But to each his own.
No one is watching this stock but it is acting really STRONG!
Anybody knows how INTU reacts after earnings?
You all should watch Patriot act's new episode on Netflix about intuit. Fundamental investors will get a sense of what kind of company they are dealing with!
Top and bottom line beats.
happy new year all. good luck to all longs going forward with INTU. Wasn't a bad year all things considered
1000$ by end of year
"Hmmmmm. Markets/economies squeezing the hell out of small/medium biz. That means squeezing our margins. That means squeezing equity/pps. That means squeezing... US! Thats a lot of squeezing. I hope I'm wrong, and that increased scale retains (improves?) bottom line, but...???"
"Just shorted intuit, way way overpriced this will be down to 523.00 after hours"
"So I’m new to this, but can someone explain how MailChimp plays into Quickbooks, credit karma and turbo tax? I see how those work together, but not seeing the whole vision of where Intuit is going - thx"
"On the conference call, Intuit is now talking about the integration of TurboTax & KreditKarma. They already have been experimenting with this integration & intend to drive it much further. Driving margin leverage by becoming more & more of a software company. Margin expansion was already occurring back in 2019 before the Covid-19 outbreak. Later."
"After listening to SOFI, earnings call, SOFI, would be a wonderful addition, to Intuit's eco system!"
Square would fit nicely in this organization.
Intu has partnered with Robin Hood’s tax team... they are offering a discount to use turbo tax. This should result in many new customers paying for the premium turbo tax!
"Goodrazi says he started talking with Mailchimp about a potential transaction last year, and that Mailchimp then hired an investment banker and created a competitive bidding process. He says Mailchimp chose to accept the offer from Intuit despite the fact that it was not the highest bidder. How AWESOME is Goodrazi??? This guy has more vision and charisma than anyone else in Silicon Valley."
Intuit and Credit Karma is multi Trillion dollar Monster on the Rise!
something leaked...this stock is moving up
INTU new high. Congrats longs
Does anyone actively comment on this board?
"Intuit gets new $645, price target! Still way below my $800, price target!"

"the free free free tax filing software is not really free after all. After you registered and signed in and answering a few questions, even before I made any input on earning, the software prompted to upgrade to their deluxe edition for just a mere $19.99...and the column next to it shows $49.99 with itemized deduction...So if you plan on using the free free free turbo scam software, be prepared to keep getting these popup telling you to upgrade and pay. Try it, you will be disappointed with the free free free turbo scam..."
Beautiful!
"Intuit should be up BIG today! TurboTax online sales up 7% up from 4% in 2018. That is a 75% acceleration in growth! TurboTax continues to Steal market share from everyone! Desktop units were down 3%, but as a SAAS company, Intui t should not be selling Any desktop units, their goal should be ZERO! When you aggregate the online and the desktop units were up 5% vs 4% last year, 25% acceleration in growth! Some knew how Amazing the numbers were and bought a ton of 270 calls Monday! INTU over 300 after earnings!D%"
Nearing the bottom. Primed to bounce back after Oct 30.
GOING DOWN HARDER TO 250 RANGE TODAY SELL SO I CAN COVER MY 1000 SHORT SHARES FROM 271.40
"Intuit Launches Quickbooks Cash No-Fee Business Bank Accounthttps://themarketsignal.com/Free-Report/INTUIntuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)’s 14 Days Aroon down is 7.14, whereas 14 Days Aroon Up is 92.86, the stock is bullish. Intuit has stepped up to facilitate no-fee business bank account called QuickBooks Cash.It allows small business owners an access to accounts which pay 1% interest on being used in alliance with QuickBooks mobile apps or software. The idea behind this launch is to assist small business owners in managing complex financial situations and their funds with ease."
OMG!!! Best Quarter in Intuit's History!! New CEO is a ROCK STAR! Only misstep was not closing BIGC deal! Over $700 in 18 months!
Historical charts tell me (next week will be very good for intu).
"Hope we not going down tomorrow,earnings was not bad"
"Intuit Introduces Money by QuickBooks, Mobile Banking Designed for Small Businesses! Intuit keeps evolving at warp speed!"
"Intuit is a beast, grinding to $300"
"Probably be trading in the range of 570 to 590, during September. Buy at this level, and make some moola. A sure thing. M"
"""That performance beat average analyst expectations of adjusted earnings of 23 cents a share on sales of $952 million. Intuit shares gained immediately after the earnings report was released, but declined about 3% in late trading after news of the executive changes hit""..intuit is gonna be fine, if anything, the drop is a buying opp."
Nice! Well Intuit is going to $300!! And it wont be grinding anymore! Intuit $400 in 6 months! New CEO is a ROCK STAR!!!
Every trader should use (http://trademarketview.tech)! Their watchlists help me make the best possible stock picks each day. I never start a trading day without their advice!
Probably picks up $40-43 tomorrow keeping the multiple about right. If it’s a sideways day it may gain additional momentum as the hottest movers tend to get exaggerated. It looks like it may settle in around $600 over the next week. Honestly nobody on here is considering opening a short position. Market is pricing in curve reversal. Leave intuit to smart money. If you need a short try OCGN ( just picking from a lot of dirty dogs I occasionally short after hype pops)
"Intuit Agrees to Buy Mailchimp for About $12 Billion!!! Huge! Was getting nervous this deal was not going to get done. Intuit is going to become a Emarketing Giant!!! Credit Karma is going get Intuit to one billion, Mailchimp will get them over 2 billion!!"
All in for post earnings rise to $555.
The March to $800 has resumed!
"The talks between Mailchimp and Intuit, if true, make a lot of sense from the angle that both companies share the same customers...small and medium size businesses. There is a lot of marketing synergy to cross sell each other's customer base. It also gives MC an advantage over their competitiors....even Shopify and Amazon, because neither AMZN or SHOP are into the bookkeeping side of business - as far as I am aware. AS far as the $10B price tag, it is probably a reasonable price to pay 10:1 X earnings (MC is a privately owned company, but their last known annual earnings was around $750M and that was a few years ago). I would guess that MC will continue to be based in Atlanta, and they could very well keep thier name - at least for a while. What really makes this deal so good for both companies is that MS's recent entry into e-commerce was moderatley successful and Intuit has the customer base, size and scale to jump start that area in a big way."
Why down?
"Credit Karma Money is Multi Trillion dollar Idea! Credit Karma Money is a Autonomous Finance Platform! This is what gives Intuit the ability to 10X over the next 5 to 7 years. They are going to use Credit Karma Money to deliver and manage financial assets, savings, 401K's, Robo investing and more! What gives Intuit and Credit Karma a huge leg up is the 88 billion in tax refunds that Turbo Tax customers receive. Intuit is just getting started."
What do long-term investors of SHOP think about $INTU becoming a formidable competitor to Shopify? Shop has been trailing the Nasdaq since Intuit announced it's plans to acquire Mailchimp during the summer.
"I am a long time turbotax user. I have had, for the first time, an absolutely dreadful experience with customer support when all I was trying to do was purchase the 2018 version. My theory is that intuit is trying to more closely integrate turbotax with the rest of the company, and something has gone terribly wrong."
Seems a bit of uncertainty here now that Intuit is planning a revamp of a few sectors and laid off 715 employees. Not sure what this will bring but usually uncertainty is a bad thing in investor's eyes.
"How much is Credit Karma worth? A giant tanker, fill with GOLD! Upstart Just doubled making loans to Credit Karma, customers! That's 4.2 billion in a single day!"
Intuit still marching to $800!
"we got our new quickbooks bills this week. ever small business that uses quickbooks gets this yearly bill now. and its tax season too, so turbotax drives this up . INTU to go up 20 percent from here . In 6 months this is 330. mark my words."
"Intuit is going to crush full year guidance, strange they did not raise. Somebody is trying to keep shares down, but won't last long."
what happened?
TurboTax launched a free online portal to help people who don't file taxes get their stimulus check faster! this is free advertising is worth 100's of millions of dollars! Screaming buy!
"be warned! I opened a position and bought a share, so this will for sure head back to 450 now."
"Could you imagine how much Credit Karma would be valued at today, it was an IPO? North of 30 billion."
Intuit is in Beast Mode! Moving all in to a SAAS model is going to produce amazing results in the future. Credit Karma is still not being valued for the monster it is becoming under Intuit's leadership and ecosystem. Wondering what other companies Intuit has it's eyes on???
Cnbc Options Actoin on Friday were bullish....
Intuit valuation is fairly high here and insider sales #$%$ the market but are just normal for this kind of security. It is impossible to time anything with INTU and so just hold on as the business model is super. There is good support in the mid 260's
"Hopefully Intuit looking at another aquisition. Thinking they should go after fintechs that have great mobile apps, Robinhood, Experian and Sofi come to mind."
Will this split?
"I have used TurboTax for 20 years. This will be my last year. The quality of their product keeps dropping, and their customer service is non existent. The latest software bug in their tool has been their for 3 weeks and they still have not fixed it.Good by Intuit. You have lost a loyal customer."
"One of the greatest stock of recent times, doesn't get much Wall street media coverage, but keeps going up nicely!"
"Intuit is PRINTING MONEY!!! Intuit just bought the LA Clippers a new Basketball stadium! Intuit Dome, CEO is spending money like a boss."
"I’m always amazed seeing how well Intuit’s stock price has done. Their other businesses than tax prep software must be doing better than the TurboTax products. I’ve used TurboTax fir 39 years and consider myself fairly computer savvy. Afterthree consecutive years of worsening software downloads, horrible customer service, clunky and worsening user interfaces, as well as legions of horrible other users reviews of Intuit’s software, I have given up. The last, because their most recent cloud based tax program, “don’t pay until you file” wouldn’t even let you see a tax file before the final filing,,,,was the final straw. Went to a CPA. Am surprised intuit isn’t significantly shorted."
Intuit + Credit Karma = Fintech Beast! this is just the beginning of a incredible future for the Intuit Platform they are going to add so many verticals your head is going spin all the way around. Intuit just might be the best Fintech in the World! The reason is the DATA they got the DATA!
Nice breakout in a stock that has a wide economic moat.
"with bad earnings and layoffs looming, this is very expensive in th 200s. this will be in the low 100s once the selloff is over."
SOFI is next INTU
"Long for over five years. Intu does not disappointment me at all. The dividend keeps growing and the stock keeps performing well. Glad to have it in my portfolio. If you play short, time your buys/sells well, and good luck to you."
"Considering we are on the mist of a once in a lifetume pandemic, small business continue to get crushed and we have tens of millions unemployed, 14% revenue gain is pretty, pretty good."
"Intuit, buys App Integrator OneSaas To Boost QuickBooks Commerce! Intuit is on its way to becoming a trillion dollar company! Really focused on Ecommerce and Digital payments past 12 months!"
More worried about the new lawsuits regarding TurboTax hiding free file. Seems like a new one each week. Whoever is running the companies PR efforts around this should be tossed. Seems like the CEO is also ignoring the issue. Guess the courts will determine
"Question, For anyone that might have the real answer is; With the Tax changes how many of TurboTax customers not going to need to buy the higher priced version? and How bad it that going to hurt earnings?"
"Filling the gap or the specialists need to get themselves good with expiration or somebody big wants some shares as cheap as possible. About to get back into my earnings play but I now own some INTU core shares. Whether it is three minutes or three trading days, we will see the stock hgigher from here."
"What kind of brain-iacs would be shorting Intuit after these earnings? Have at it, grasshoppers. And then get yourself to the nearest Shorter's Anonymous meeting ASAP. Jeesh!"
"article brought me here - I looked at this earlier...WAY TOO high - now i recall why I didn't buy.maybe I missed out, but still seems too inflated"
LOTS OF SELLERS ON MY LEVEL 2 PLATFORM. I WILL BE ABLE TO COVER BELOW 255 TODAY. GUARANTEED.
Who holding or buying into er
Intuit is a great company. The foundation of my business was built around their applications and services.https://www.cloudledger.net/
"Going to be a very hard sell now for the higher priced versions of TurboTax, Most will not need them with no more home write off's and no more state tax write off's"
Yes I feel your pain. It is sickening that a company crushes and does everything right yet the stock still goes down. Such manipulation
Intuit CEO brilliant move! TurboTax launched a free online portal to help people who don't file taxes get their stimulus check faster! Intuit has a HUGE advantage on tax prep and all other services they provide and sell because of this free online portal!
Such an under rated company!
Key excerpts of the earnings release: Total company revenue for the first half of the fiscal year grew 14%.Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue up 11 percent to $1.0 billion.Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew 28 percent.Great set up for this quarter.
"Intuit is Crushing it! Imagine if the Public discovered how Awesome this Company and stock, is!"
"The sell off today, is not rational, moving the tax deadline will only drive traffic to intuit websites for a longer period. Revenues will not be lost but moved out 90 days. Intuit will surely move down on market sell offs due to the virus, but today's sell off makes no sense. Intuit is going to be fine in time"
look at the cup and handle breakout - could go parabolic with these numbers! Overlap Square and Paypal charts from last quarter to INTU right now - going a lot higher!
"Most exciting news in the history on Intuit, ""Intuit Partners with Octopus Energy to Provide Renewable Options to UK QuickBooks Employees & Customers""!!!! Intuit now a Green Renewable Energy Company!! The New CEO in a GENIUS!!"
Intuit is acting really really strong!
I think we may have hit the top here.
This earnings call is going to be fireworks... the best year Intuit has ever had in terms of turbo tax... I'm sure they will cross $320 mark..
"Believe, INTUIT, will double in next 18 months"
Why is it dropping post an amazing result!!
Why INTU - Intuit Inc. Stock Fall Down Today? See details: https://prem.li/StockMarketToday
think we will get a bump in the am ?
"they guiding units not dollars. 'Live' is like 3x the price of deluxe, it's gonna be a good Quarter"
INTU just hit the jackpot. Supreme Court killed physical requirement for sales tax. This means that every online retailer will be paying tax in every state. Check it out for yourself. South Dakota v. Wayfair Intuit is going to sell A LOT of tax software.
INTU reached a new All Time High at 201.54
Why is the P/E of this stock so high since it is not growing fast?
"Total insider trades last 12 months 2,364,778 shares sold. 0 shares bought.... http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/intu/insider-trades"
Intuit reached an all time high at 588.84
Why why
"Earnings will crush but the stock will probably drop 5%, just like every other company has done lately."
Question? All I can find out about the tangible book value of INTU is showing it's value is under $70 is that right or not?
Cut off ties with upstart. Why filter then your business when you can replicate the same AI and keep all the business for yourself.
Overreaction and not company specific news. This is when you add to a stock not get bearish.
"Hopefully, Motley Fool, will bring all the love, Intuit deserves!!!"
Watch out INTU is rolling over
"Latest newsNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called on two state agencies Wednesday to investigate Intuit, H&R Block and other companies that prepare tax returns, citing recent media reports that the companies allegedly hid their free tax filing options from Google searches.""The allegations against these major tax return preparers are disturbing, and New York will not stand idle as the public's interest is undermined in order to pad the profits of wealthy corporations,"" Cuomo said. ""I am calling on the Department of Financial Services and the Department of Taxation and Finance to investigate these claims to help ensure New Yorkers are protected.""Americans who make an adjusted gross income of $66,000 a year or less are eligible to file their tax returns for free under the Free File Alliance — an agreement between the IRS, major tax preparation companies and states, including New York. The partnership was an exchange for the IRS promising not to create its own free, online service.But Intuit, the maker of TurboTax, and H&R Block are actively steering taxpayers away from their free versions — TurboTax Free File and H&R Block Free File — according to a report Sunday by ProPublica. In order to do so, the companies are allegedly adding code to tell Google and other search engines not to list the free versions of their online tax filing tools.Intuit disputed the report's findings.""Our search and marketing practices around the IRS Free File program have been called into question. These characterizations are untrue and we look forward to sharing the facts with New York regulators,"" an Intuit spokesman said in an emailed statement to CNBC.H&R Block defended its role in the Free File Alliance.""H&R Block's Free File program grew 8.3 percent this tax season, exceeding the Free File program growth of 6.8 percent, and we believe H&R Block is in full compliance with the Free File agreement,"" Susan Waldron, a spokesperson for the company, told CNBC.Shares of H&R Block were down 2.6% to $26.50 on the news. Intuit's stock also fell, dropping 2% to $245.97."
I constantly have to revise my projections as INTU keeps proving me correct. The next price target is $345
"Thinking about new acquisitions, WIX, LSPD, BILL, AFRM, SOFI. Feeling like Intuit going to make some moves, next 12 months! cash is piling up!"
"Wow! Loved, INTU, CEO, tried to buy BIGC, before IPO. This guy is Awesome! Sorry deal wasn't made, but Love how he is thinking about the future of eccomerce, digital markets and where the universe is headed!!"
With triple the number of people filling taxes this year using turbo tax compared to last year... $335 is an easy target for this stock. can't wait to see this explode next week.
INTU reports earnings today. I expect their earnings to rock!!! Good luck to all longs!!! GO INTU GO!!!
"I got INTU worth $800, still a long way to run!"
"You know what is even better than the earnings report? The conference call, Intuit is building a platform that is going to mint money!"
R Muted. Bye bye
"Nobody has figured out the multiplying effects of adding Intuit × Credit Karma x Mailchimp = $5,000!"
Way to many key people have left INTU in the last month. For a stock trading at all time highs. Time will tell what happens next
QBO payroll didn’t deposit people’s checks this morning and is a system wide problem. People are getting frustrated with it. Customer support has been lacking in recent years. Expect some bad publicity soon.
"Stocks will probably get crushed until, there is good news in Coronavirus, but Intuit, is setting itself up for the next decade of accelerated growth with Credit Karma purchase."
"How soon do they have to announce how bad earnings are going to get hit by customers not having to buying the higher priced versions of TurboTax, because of the tax changes do to no more home right off's"
I smell hedge funds manipulation..time to load up
stock is sitting right at its all-time high in fact it just hit a new all-time high. Should break out now Above This level
"I have never seen any acquisition thrive like Credit Karma has in the Intuit Ecosystem. There seems to be a multiplying effect with with combining these two assets into one platform. After listening to the conference call, it appears that Management is looking for more deals to unleash this potential. Looking forward to some exciting acquisitions in the next 12 months."
"Ever try to call Intuit customer Service? It is non-existent.First, it's almost impossible to find the number.I called it for quickbooks and went through a phone tree before being disconnected.Tried again, same thing happened twice.A company that runs it's business like this will not be successful."
Best value of cloud related businesses and arguably the stickiest business. Great entry point.
"History. Intuit was founded in 1983 by Scott Cook and Tom Proulx in Mountain View, California, USA. After the success of Quicken for individual financial management, the company developed similar services for small business owners.Developer(s): Intuit Inc.Type: Accounting softwareOperating system: Microsoft Windows; macOS ..."

Intuit is burning pretty hot today. Hold or buy?
I find it amazing how few people have this company on their radars
"Before Credit Karma, Intuit was growing 10 - 12% a year. Now, Intuit is printing 40% growth!! Revenue growth is accelerating, Credit Karma growing Revs like triple digits. Shoud be an AMAZING year!"
Intuit is $400 stock in 24 months! Way undervalued!
"Credit Karma Money and Instant Karma, is Genius! Rocket Fuel, to make Intuit Trillion dollar company in 5 years! Growth Rate about to hit escape velocity!"
What is going on does anyone know? Many of the insiders have been selling. Bad drop today.

"Man, I guess that I don't understand the stock market! Great earnings and great guidance! Analyst PT boost up to 640. Despite that the stock is sold off! What's this puzzle??"
"Ahhhh, but the market did sell off. So, therefore, the alternate reality of which you refer will never come to fruition. This will be blood red tomorrow along with the rest of the market. Have a nice night"
Intuit reached an all time high at 610.38
