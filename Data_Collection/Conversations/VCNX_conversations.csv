"Green, huh? Can we expect another ""walk to end Alzheimer's"" post on LinkedIn??"
"For anyone that is long, I reccomend clicking on the link for the presentation today to get a good feel for what they are working on, timelines, expectations and potential opportunities for their platform. Definitely worth the 30 mins."
"""Walk to End Alzheimers""... Haha!! ... That's how we fund health care in America... Walk-a-thons, bake sales, Go Fund Me, Taxpayer funded research grants for trillion dollar pharmaceutical companies, kickbacks to pharmaceutical reps from doctors, $5,000 annual health insurance policies that cover absolutely nothing, US Senators that take $1,000,000 bribes from health insurance lobbyists, ......"
"I see Vaccinex is posting about their team participating in the ""Walk to end Alzheimers"" and asking for donations. Would be awesome to see updates on the actual treatment studies."
Does anyone know dates of data release ?There a conference on Aug 8-9 Where they will be making a presentation (can anyone confirm this ?) then “early October “ for the release of top line data on the Huntington’s signal trial.
Hard to believe this thing has a mkt cap of $87MM with 2 major pharma deals in the hopper.
I'm long 1500 shares headed into earnings. If #'s are good I'll buy 500 more.
Volume is picking up nicely :) get in boys i believe its the right time.
"$VCNX And another LinkedIn post by vaccinex thanking everyone for supporting the Walk to End Alzheimer's. While, indeed, a noble effort......When can shareholders expect an update/news on your go-to-market progress?"
VERY ENCOURAGING AND HELPFUL INFO:https://www.directorstalkinterviews.com/vaccinex---consensus-indicates-potential-286.8-upside/412965810
The reason this is great news is because of their large R&D spending. Most people who bought the stock Friday don't understand this and will sell thinking it is a pump and dump. Stock will go to 10 to 20 over the next week or two. Probably a good idea to buy some below 5.
I am not a scientist but as I will try to explain what is going on with this company's promise and why this company may be so attractive to big pharma. This company and the platform technology they offer may be the missing link to develope more effective alzheimer and other neurodegenerative pharmaceuticals and the big boys are realizing this. The clinical trial that tanked the stock's price was not the complete failure that Wall Street has reflected and discounted in the share price- it showed encouraging bioactivity (but had a flawed study design) and hence the interest of big pharma. Further study results and analysis of the platform data are coming near the end of the year. A big barrier to neuroactive drugs is the ablility to cross the blood brain barrier and penetrate target cells and here is where Vaccinex comes in. Several posters here have looked at the study slides from privious studies by Vaccinex and have commented on the unique brain cell penetration offered by this company's platform. Also vaccine stocks are going to be very attractive in the near and long term following the covid vaccine publicity. Vaccine technologies can not only treat viruses but vaccines can be added to pharmaceuticals to allow the brain penetration that can treat degenerative brain diseases. Here is where Vaccinex comes in and I must say what a great name for a company in this sector! Even a 10% share of a drug that is truly successful in treated Alzheimers would net Vaccinex billions in royalties. I'm sure others can explain the potential of this company a lot better than me. Position-long 12k at 2.48.
"I have been puzzling over the way the share price reacted to the massive volume spike on 2/19/2021 - over 270M shares traded on what Yahoo represents as a 9M share float and 22M total shares. I searched Edgar and found the same numbers recorded in the 10Q filed 11/13/2020 and nothing in subsequent filings to indicate additional shares being issued and no mention of preferred series cobvertible to common. So the share price and volume just did not correlate, in my mind. Today I went back further and found a prospectus filed on 9/9/2020 which indicates the company authorized the sale of common stock equaling $113,000,000. Not a specific number of shares, but a specific dollar amount. So, there may have been dilution but the total number of new shares (if any, to date) won't be known until disclosed at the next quarterly. Looking at historical data, the share price has averaged around $2 from the date of the prospectus, so if the full offering has been raised, there may be as many as 57,500,000 new shares. On the other hand, the share price the past two days has been above $5 on average, and if the offering was realized in that time frame there would be an additional 23,000,000 (or fewer) new shares. I don't like share dilution but that is unavoidable during R&D phase, and as it goes, this is mild, especially in light of the results-oriented announcements of the past few days. Also, it has the happy result of providing the funds needed for continuing operations, additional R&D, and cash reserves. So all in all, a big plus for those who see the long-term possibilities.The prospectus: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1205922/000119312520242246/d73277d424b5.htmSo, a float of 32 - 68 million shares makes a lot more sense as it relates to the massive trading volume of last week, but I still would have expected to see more upward pressure. So I checked the latest short interest and discovered of the 278M shares traded Friday, 2/19/2021, 87M (31%) were short sales. And that is the final piece that helps me make sense of the share price/volume spike we saw on Friday. Going forward, if the share price remains relatively stable at the $4 - $5 range, I think we might see a nice bump, especially if more good news is forthcoming."
"Next, partner announcement! Patience is key to this one folks."

I bought 6000 shares at $1.98 and sold at $9 good luck to all
"I’m holding from $6, and I shall be keeping these stocks at least until the end of the year."
Oversold. This is a good value investment and worth holding. Price target 13.50 before the licensing deal!
