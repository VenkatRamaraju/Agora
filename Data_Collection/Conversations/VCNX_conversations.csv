Yea right.no pumping aloud
going back to original price
Told you guys over 30 mins ago.....IT'S DONE!!!!
Interesting hypothetical;With 2.65 mm float at say $8 there are literally 100’s of hedgefund and other entities (or individuals) with a mere 22 mill that can own the entire public float. If this wasn’t done late Friday it most certainly can even before the open tomorrow- no telling what the ASK will go to after that.This thing hits on robinhood or Portnoy site we’ll see $20 plus ....easily
Is this a one-trick pony or has some hope? Tempted to buy some at these basement sp?
VCNX - 17% Short volume. The pain has only begun. BUY BUY BUY
This is the right stock. Just lie low and wait.
"Glad i was watching my stocks today, lol."

"Importantly, having raised $32 million in the first quarter of 2021 through our open sale market agreement with Jefferies"
Not holding up AH
It took 2 weeks but it was worth it.
"VX15/2503 didn't show any improvement in clinical symptoms of Cohort A, just some improvements in biomarkers and imaging scans. So this is really just a complete gamble as that wont get it done to consider the trial pivotal. Also, weird cozy ownership structure and lack of any investment coverage makes this a very strange little venture to say the least"
The principal investigator said that there really isnt any evidence that the drug does anything (remarks after Cohort A was analyzed). https://www.neurologylive.com/journals/neurologylive/2019/october-2019/treating-huntington-disease-new-trials-aim-to-explore-uncharted-territory

Some newsletter must have recommended it? Or is a hedge fund buying in? Up 34% on no news????

FLOAT is now 2.65 million shares per market watch- this is after recent insider buy last week.

Got back in at 4.68 AH. I feel comfortable with that price. This could move with any positive news at all.
Stop selling so we can move up!! Hold what you got and let’s get this moving in the right direction!!!
Should be at all time high
This thing falls quick... Why?
Feels like a shakeout. Could trade over 6 today?
The news from today should send the stock 70% up not 7%
Nice news!

"Well that doesn't bode well. Curious though, why Merck entered into the agreement to use the drug with Keytruda with these test results? It would seem that there must be something there for them to proceed"
expiration date of options today so shorts are forced to bring the pps under $5 or hedge funds and shorts losing lots of money

"Example 2 Anti-CXCL13 Antibody Inhibition of Human B-Cell Migration Inhibition of CXCL13 function, e.g., B-cell migration, was evaluated using established models that simulate B-cell migration in both human and mouse systems. Migration towards a non-CXCL13 chemokine, SDF-1.alpha. (a.k.a. CXCL12), was used as a control to confirm specificity of anti-CXCL13 antibody on inhibition of B-cell migration. Thus, anti-CXCL13 antibodies were tested for inhibition of human CXCL13-induced migration and the absence of an effect on SDF-1.alpha.-induced migration. Inhibition of Human B-Cell Migration Towards Human CXCL13. The effect of 3D2, 3C9, and MAb 801 on human CXCL13-induced B-cell migration was tested. Two clonal cell lines, human pre-B-697-hCXCR5 and human pre-B-697-hCXCR4, were used to assess the effects of anti-CXCL13 antibodies on recombinant human CXCL13-dependent migration and recombinant human SDF-1.alpha.-dependent migration, respectively. Transwell tissue culture-treated plates with 8 .mu.m pore size and diameter of 6.5 mm (Corning Costar: 3422) were used. Human pre-B-697-hCXCR5 cells were used for rhCXCL13-induced migration, and human pre-B-697-hCXCR4 for were used for rhSDF-1-induced migration (negative control). Cells were resuspended in chemotaxis buffer ((RPMI 1640 with 1-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, PennStrep and 0.5% BSA) pre-warmed to RT) at 5.times.10.sup.6/ml and returned to 37.degree. C. for 30 minutes. Diluted chemokine (97 nm (1 .mu.g/ml) rhCXCL13 or 12.5 nM (0.1 .mu.g/ml) rhSDF-1.alpha. in chemotaxis buffer)+/-antibodies were added into the lower chamber at 590 .mu.l/well and pre-incubated for 30 minutes at RT. The cells were added at 100 .mu.l (5.times.10.sup.5) cells/upper chamber. Plates were incubated overnight at 37.degree. C. Inserts were then removed and Alamar blue was added at 60 .mu.l per well and the plates were incubated at 37.degree. C. for 4 hours. Fluorescence was measured at wavelengths 530 nm and 590 nm."
Good for Robert to make $5000. Don’t have a clue why it popped. Must be some inside news but then you would hold it! Pump and dump by one person more likely
VCNX short sellers feeling ill today....
to the moon booom 
Reddit traders hate short sellers... So do I...
Conference was a poor attempt to show the drug as a possible treatment for Alzeihmer's and late stage HD. Bottomline is drug failed to meet both primary endpoints and investors are back o square one. This is a long shot at this point. Any investment here will take long term to provide any returns... I am out
"Next, partner announcement! Patience is key to this one folks."
Oh plenty of time.....
"Looks like it not worth to keep it. Dumping in 10m. Major loss with 22k. I am afraid this will go to 1.50-1.80 by Friday. Since no other drugs are in the pipeline (except the one with Merck), not worth to keep it. Another 20% haircut by tomorrow."
We all got hosed here!
This is either trading on insider news ( may need investigation) or they are selling new shares ( ATM)
Next 10Bagger
"Happy Sunday, tomorrow is a BIG day. Hoping Great news"
Bought 3000 shares at $5.21
"Buy !!! skyrocket this week , to the moon"
anyone checking out the presentation tomorrow?
I’m making a long term gamble on this with a couple hundred shares at $6.70.It’s worth the gamble if they do come out with something big but not much cost if they don’t.
just added more on dip
Zacks Strong Buy!
Less float of shares and that means Huge UP
"Up over 25% on 3x normal volume going into the weekend, but no news and little action in the options. Is something happening, or not? 12 month high was over $12.00, so lots of room to move up on any news!"
Phase 2 fail is better than phase 3 failure. Stock should rebound.
Bought a few shares after hours... even though I refuse to take any vaccinations for COVID...
I just made 100k profit wooooooooopppppp
One of the best Hedge Fund was involved.
surface oncology just released earnings and a collaboration with Merk. Its very possible Vaccinex also has a deal with Merk 2nd player? Perhaps vcnx was told to hold off on the news until their earnings announcement.
when the name of the drug company the partner with is revealed this will go $15
Oversold. This is a good value investment and worth holding. Price target 13.50 before the licensing deal!
too late to buy now.
"Well, I thought I was buying low in the first place and then it sunk 42%.So, what did it do? Bought more. C'mon Vass, lets win together..... I rooting for you and everyone else... lets win together!!!then if goes up, you can play the song ""started from bottom, now were here."""
as soon as i buy the price drops... how do i have that affect on stocks???
I think this stock had patent news shows a volume surge
Is it a good buy at 5 ?
"Very Encouraging results for cancer patients and with drug combination therapies. VCNX takes a different approach from other companies with Alzheimer's disease therapies, more focused on deterioration effects of the disease."
Does anyone know dates of data release ?There a conference on Aug 8-9 Where they will be making a presentation (can anyone confirm this ?) then “early October “ for the release of top line data on the Huntington’s signal trial.
We need more NEWS on this stock $$$$ good things await us
Where's the $10 everyone said it would hit.Said 2 hours ago it was done....and I'm still correct!!!
Vaccinex is currently transitioning from the data gathered phases from past years of investment in scientific studies to actual drug therapies being developed.
Haters get out of this board
anyone an idea how long this will take until they can launch and make profit? what will happens after licensing ?
Got in when it dipped by 56%. Any chances of seeing $2 in the future.
10-12 usd this week!
"So here is what happens today based on my understanding, they got patent approval, price shoot up, I can’t see the news anywhere so assuming most of the trading was insider or based on insider news. People were holding this stock at 1.some thing, soon they say the profit, they sold, partially they were tired of holding this for long at same price or slightly declining. This caused the stock to go down. Now the dump part is over so I am assuming we will see the news impact tomorrow, some where 3 or 3.some thing. Let’s see what we have tomorrow."
a lot of good info
"74K moves the stock by 9%. When news hits the wire in few weeks, this will fly like a rocket"
$7-8 Monday with a possible push over $10
"Look at September 3rd, when the stock dropped from $6 to some $1.86.Then it took about 5 months before this pump. So, it is going back down to $2.-2.50 range. Can't stop it as all those who bought under $2 will sell."
looks like steady accumulation this week. I'm sensing a nice move up ahead.
Where is everyone
Will skyrocket soon to the moooooon
Nice candidate for a short squeeze. But no problems if vcnx goes lower. Love to add more if it goes lower as it is a phenomenal news; and when we get news of the terms of agreement with these two big pharma it’s no telling how high given the micro float.
This is easily hitting 10+
More you buy faster they sell.
this going to 22$ #VBIV AND #VCNX LIKE #HTBX AND #IBIO ALSO IN THE COVD IS #TNXP STARTED TO MOVE UP STILL CHEAP
This will be the Winner very
Who Are these two «prominent» drug makers?? Can they hold back information much longer??
great report! great start of the week!
$2.50 by next Friday on margin call selling and stop losses
Highest trading volume in past 12 month was 19M shares. 270M today on what is supposed to be 22M total. I don't see how that is possible unless every share changed hands 13 times. Either the total shares is inaccurate (filings don't reflect it) or a #$%$ ton of shares were bought and sold without being delivered. Is it legal to keep selling shares when the orders outnumber the supply? 270M shares in 6.5 hours equals a sell rate of 41.5 million shares per hour. That's almost 2x the total and 4x the float. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VCNX/history?p=VCNX
3 analyst cover this thing and they all rate it a buy with a PT of 13.50
Phase 2 study - if they hit prospective outcomes - FDA Fast track through Phase 3.
ACIU is saying they have an Alzheimer’s Vaccine.
Looks like big sharks are buying in. Hmmm…I guess the price is low enough. Lets see how long this run lasts.
It’s going up later trust me
nailed it!
I wish every short in America would contract covid and be too sick to move for about six months!
See you all Monday at $10 per share. LOL
Only 9 million share float. No telling where this stock could end up with good news.

Don’t forgot shorts have to cover!!! They hate holding over weekend cuz you never know what can happen come Monday !
I just bought more
"I have been watching the short shares available and someone is grabbing 50,000 and using to bring this down methodically each morning. Interesting plan, you all should read the information last September 2020, this s. show is a temporary drive for one greedy person."
Wow what an amazing run! You guys! The price target is closer each day <3
The reason this is great news is because of their large R&D spending. Most people who bought the stock Friday don't understand this and will sell thinking it is a pump and dump. Stock will go to 10 to 20 over the next week or two. Probably a good idea to buy some below 5.
"Be ready folks! Someone grabbed 150,000 shares to short sometime this morning. Im prepared to buy more!"
Does anyone know the name of the mystery prominent drug maker?

Dave 0724 thank you for your responses on Vaccinex. Very helpful and informative.

"Someone is betting a 1/2 million to steal your investment $$$Buy as much as you can, they have to cover in a day!"

$10 is knocking the door  just be patience
Hard to believe this thing has a mkt cap of $87MM with 2 major pharma deals in the hopper.
I'll be laughing if this end over $6 tonight. especially to the shorters who keep talking this stock down
"Huge profit loss, cut my losses or hold till it project"
Losing interest in this dog fast.
Got 15k premarket @ 1.97. Thanks weak hands. Should get 2 bucks back to 4 range today.

Looks like we just hit a gusher!

Although a PI co with Mkt cap ~$325MM, they have some really high value products that are worth a look. Getting long SURF and SLS."
I am not a scientist but as I will try to explain what is going on with this company's promise and why this company may be so attractive to big pharma. This company and the platform technology they offer may be the missing link to develope more effective alzheimer and other neurodegenerative pharmaceuticals and the big boys are realizing this. The clinical trial that tanked the stock's price was not the complete failure that Wall Street has reflected and discounted in the share price- it showed encouraging bioactivity (but had a flawed study design) and hence the interest of big pharma. Further study results and analysis of the platform data are coming near the end of the year. A big barrier to neuroactive drugs is the ablility to cross the blood brain barrier and penetrate target cells and here is where Vaccinex comes in. Several posters here have looked at the study slides from privious studies by Vaccinex and have commented on the unique brain cell penetration offered by this company's platform. Also vaccine stocks are going to be very attractive in the near and long term following the covid vaccine publicity. Vaccine technologies can not only treat viruses but vaccines can be added to pharmaceuticals to allow the brain penetration that can treat degenerative brain diseases. Here is where Vaccinex comes in and I must say what a great name for a company in this sector! Even a 10% share of a drug that is truly successful in treated Alzheimers would net Vaccinex billions in royalties. I'm sure others can explain the potential of this company a lot better than me. Position-long 12k at 2.48.

Takeover coming from Biogen within a few Weeks. Hostile takeover at $750 mil. What a barging.
Analysts have it as a strong buy and price target at $7. Maybe its catching up to their predictions lol.
"This thing is a money maker. Was selling 10k blox at 8-9, mkt was eating it up now bought back below 3 and will sell again in the teens."
"The partners don't want to tip their hand so that's why no names announced yet. Looks to me that they are likely considering a buyout. (jmho) These types of volume on unspecific or no news are always troubling. Watching to see how the next hour plays out. This market has been crazy, so one never really knows."
When will the company release more information about the deal?

Still holding around over a $5 average. I took a big loss should I cut my losses or hold

No one is selling. SHORT will have to cover SOON.
"Positive news,plus positive growth all year . Aside from shorts lately is this a long term play ? "
"I have been puzzling over the way the share price reacted to the massive volume spike on 2/19/2021 - over 270M shares traded on what Yahoo represents as a 9M share float and 22M total shares. I searched Edgar and found the same numbers recorded in the 10Q filed 11/13/2020 and nothing in subsequent filings to indicate additional shares being issued and no mention of preferred series cobvertible to common. So the share price and volume just did not correlate, in my mind. Today I went back further and found a prospectus filed on 9/9/2020 which indicates the company authorized the sale of common stock equaling $113,000,000. Not a specific number of shares, but a specific dollar amount. So, there may have been dilution but the total number of new shares (if any, to date) won't be known until disclosed at the next quarterly. Looking at historical data, the share price has averaged around $2 from the date of the prospectus, so if the full offering has been raised, there may be as many as 57,500,000 new shares. On the other hand, the share price the past two days has been above $5 on average, and if the offering was realized in that time frame there would be an additional 23,000,000 (or fewer) new shares. I don't like share dilution but that is unavoidable during R&D phase, and as it goes, this is mild, especially in light of the results-oriented announcements of the past few days. Also, it has the happy result of providing the funds needed for continuing operations, additional R&D, and cash reserves. So all in all, a big plus for those who see the long-term possibilities.The prospectus: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1205922/000119312520242246/d73277d424b5.htmSo, a float of 32 - 68 million shares makes a lot more sense as it relates to the massive trading volume of last week, but I still would have expected to see more upward pressure. So I checked the latest short interest and discovered of the 278M shares traded Friday, 2/19/2021, 87M (31%) were short sales. And that is the final piece that helps me make sense of the share price/volume spike we saw on Friday. Going forward, if the share price remains relatively stable at the $4 - $5 range, I think we might see a nice bump, especially if more good news is forthcoming."
Looking forward to Vaccinex News Release in the morning!
"Relax. This will head back up, the RSI cooled right off into oversold."
"is this up because BIIB alzheimer's drug got approved by the fda and VCNX has SIGNAL-AD, also a alzheimer's drug in phase 1b/2a trial? Did the fda lower the alzheimer's drug bar and now any company can get one approved?"
