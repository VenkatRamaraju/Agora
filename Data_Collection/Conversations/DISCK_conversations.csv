"And yes, I sold my shares today for a 50 cent loss. First and only time I will EVER again go long this bloated, debt laden dying company. My first loss in 7 tries. I only win by shorting this. More bleeding ahead tomorrow."
DISCA short interest is still over 33 million.
I cannot imagine that shorts can hold it for too ling. what is the benefit for them?
"my nephew has 5000 shares of disca. he also has 5000 shares of att. now, he wants to be in one company or the other, not both, with the prospective merger looming. i am not qualified to advise him at all. ( and suffer the wrath of my sister) i respect opinions on this board. thanks"
"I see many people have problem with debt in this company. Well i went to check again and what i find out in 10-Q that debt is not a problem at all. They did a nice job in Q2 paying some of it and most if it is due in 2030+ so in next 10 years,even longer some of it is in 2040 and 2050. They have 2.9B in cash right now which before they were BB shares, slowly but becouse of merger they are saving it all, plus they can borrow even morr you can find it in 10-Q and all of this is preparation for merger. So you should see huge cash pill until next year ready for merger. I expect arround 5B. Now ask yourself how this is not cheap if we are literally now spiting way above 10%+ FCF. Disca is one of the cheapest stocks in this overpriced market. If this go bellow 24 i will continue to buy. My avarage is arround 28, it is one of my biggest position. But even without merger, discovery will still be amazing deal, that why burry and others are slowly buying. Volumen is spiking, i also dont understand ehy stock is still going down but sometime market act strange and this is time to buy the dip. I have no idea how far down this can go, but i am sure thid will be 40+ dollar stock when valuation kick in,and when shorts go squeez then you will see the pain. Good luck and have fun."
All I can say those shorts are extremely powerful.Since the deal disca lost about 5-7 bln and T lost about 40-50 bln in value
"accumulation. shorties are already pulling their fingers to the "" buy "" button )"
"It might get to 24.40 , 24.50 on Monday."
why is thisndown by discb is up
Shorts come on keep pushing the price down I wanna buy more! The overall market is down more than discovery gimme some more cheap shares please
"Wow, Ortex shows there are still 33 million (MILLION!) short shares in this beaten-down stock. When will all those shorts cover?"
"T guys have the margin calls.They are talking more and more about calling off the deal.T lost almost 10% in the last week.And according to marketbeat estimation is trading below its book value (25.1 and book value 25.15).We DISCA people used to the rollercoasters.But T - it was more than 200 bln company - a lot of analysts predicting 30+ priceThe one thing which is worrying me,that there are no real analysts who could say about the stock value.Stocks can go up and down like crazy with no significant news and they just follow the market makersnot able to estimate the real stock price."
"T lost about 2% today, or about 4 bln in value, hitting 1 year low."
"On TD Ameritrade, no change tonite.

"This morning, Ortex issued a new Buy signal on DISCA."
Anyone an idea when we can expect news regarding the merger?
huge volume
"So, after all these good things happened why not the stock price?"
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
just shows u how leverage and schemes can build a stock..its come down and doesnt care where it was before
"you are going the right way, comrades! going to> 30!!haha"
"I think this will be positive and bring new information about the merger and amazing outlook. Monday Monday. Chief Financial Officer Gunnar Wiedenfels will present at the Bank of America Securities Media, Communications & Entertainment Conference on Monday, September 13, 2021 at 12:30 p.m. ET."
"Good news for longs: ""Polish Senate pauses media bill that could force independent network owned by U.S.-based Discovery off the air"". The Bill is not dead, but it is ""paused""."
33M short shares can't cover (volume is way too low) so they just keep shorting instead.

Hedge funds shorting and working overtime to hold 2-hr RSI under 30.00. They know damnwell that's a key crossover.
"Discb low float better short term stock imo...better chance of a squeeze than a or k but long term I feel like discak will be the winner  this squeezed like gme when volume increased slightly, hoping for some diamond hand apes to buy the dip!!"
Hope shorts cannot hold it 
This stock (A shares) NEVER was more than $32/33 in the 6+ years pre pandemic. And it dropped as low as $18-19. And that period was when 40 million more USA households had cable tv. The only time it EVER rose significantly higher was Bc of Archegos manipulation. Bubbles warp minds.
"Most of people are looking at disca like merger play, but checl the last Q. Do you see almost 800M in FCF in one Q on this valuation, lets say 3B FCF this is 10% of enterprise value per year. Do you have any idea how cheap company actually is? So merger will just put this valuation much much higher. Why do you think Burry bought it? Its a safe play, how much more this can go down? Its already by all metrics very very down. This is time to buy, merger will happen i dont know if you see but they are already preparing cash for it, someone ask why they dont BB shares, well here is your answer. They are spending on more for Disvocery plus which is gona be massive cash machine. Wait until end of the year when disc start going up and up and up, and then merger happen and you gona see 40-50 dollars."
Nice bump
Does anyone here know if the DISCA DISCB & DISCK shares will all be reorganized into one class of shares upon completion of AT&T merger?
"The longest fall in the history of the stock, already 203 days"
If you didn’t watch this today you should. The long term prospects look great and Gunnar explains it well. Watch it. Shorts time is short. https://ir.corporate.discovery.com/news-and-events/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/Discovery-Chief-Financial-Officer-Gunnar-Wiedenfels-To-Present-At-The-Bank-of-America-Securities-Media-Communications--Entertainment-Conference/default.aspx

"Anyone have a rationale why DISCB is up huge, but DISCA just sitting here? I get voting differences, but both stocks should be implying same enterprise value."
Guys? Can someone explain what's going on? I'm panicking and am close to liquidation :(
people cant wait tonget out too many other good things happening
is there any bottom on this one?
HBO Max will be cash cow. Prepare for Oct - Nov. rally when it goes live
They had some interesting insights about DISCA on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"How can 31.6 million short shares ever cover, when daily volume is recently averaging around 3 million shares? Anyone?"
"I know a lot of stocks can say this, but this dropped 10 percent in a week from already low prices for no reason (that we know of). I have a 29 and change average now. I'm discouraged at the moment, but I have to believe we will rise again soon. Maybe the after work beers have helped ease my sadness from looking at this stock."
Pattern is exactly the same over the last 6 months.
"Whenever DISCA goes up over 3 percent during the day, the next day it crashes. Maybe tomorrow it will go up"
"Maybe, the Discovery deal is not going through. ATT can pay the breakup fee and keep TW or sellto Google."
Disca Heavily Shorted squeeze up with recent favorable news
Hello guys and girls what’s the difference between $DISCA & $DISCK is it only voting rights or is there anything else I should know? Looking to start a position and not sure which one. Any info would be appreciated both seem to be great value?
"T is the winner of the merger.T shareholders: may be. I think the stock price of T is very attractive now because T dividend oriented shareholders are selling big times now. No reason to sell. Big dividend in form of shares (DISC) coming. CRAZY to sell now. I don't think there is news on taxability on the shareholders yet.But using the PFE/VTRS model, there will be A taxable event here."
"Morgan Stanley bought another 500,000 shares."
DISCA is due for an upward Fibonacci retracement.
this is worth about $28/share. I might buy at that price. more pain to come for longs. Either sell and buy cheaper or sell some covered calls. shorts will have fun with this one.
"When most of the commenters on these Yahoo Finace boards are now shorts, you know the inflection point for any given stock has been reached."
"Wow, Ortex says 33.77 million shorts shares in DISCA, while daily volume averaging only 4+ million. That's a lot of days-to-cover."
Mr. Warren Buffett appears to be on board. Hoooo-wahhhh!
"Given the fact that DISC is 29% of the new company and has a market cap of 13B means that the NewCo company now has an implied market cap of 44B. That is Time Warner combined with Discovery and yet the market cap is now only 44B. I am buying every week and happy to do so. I hope it keeps dropping as my outlook is 3 yrs, not 2 months. I also buy when things are on-sale at the food market, so why not the ""stock"" market. if Warner was already on it's own the company would have a market cap over 100B, so I'm content to wait and see if it can get to full value. BTW - if HBO was for sale, does anyone believe the price would be less than 50B for just HBO. That is HBO without any other part of either company. There are tiny nobody companies with zero profits that are worth more than 50B. ATT and their horrific track record are still dragging this down, but that is the point of the spin-off - get away from T and be on it's own. Once it's away from T, then the value will rise as their is no T baggage to drag it down. But that is 9 months away and nobody thinks more than 2 months ahead at this point."
"Discovery+ is launching in The Philippines, in a partnership with local telecoms giant Globe. In low income, less developed markets and those where credit card usage is not widespread, partnerships with local telecoms or cable firms can offer billing and marketing by the telco that enable lower cost packages and wider access(@Variety). Globe Telecom has 76.65M mobile subscribers & 4M broadband subscribers"
"Final volume today was less than 10% of the total short interest. Given recent low volume, can someone explain to me why an investor couldn't simply plop $20 million on a big buy of DISCA tomorrow morning, and simply take profits as a sizeable percent of the 33 million short shares are forced to cover?"
people should take notice with the panic buying in the past 2 trading sessions. This tells me the stock is in the bottoming process and the downside is very limited. Do your own DD.
I glad the hedge funds control most of the shares and they are bullish.
On the surface this was a brutal day but that was the strongest close I've seen in a long time. I am strangely optimistic about the rest of this week.

I will not make any grand pronouncements about this stock. I've been crushed by false hope too many times. BUT today did feel good. I hope that we can continue this tomorrow.
If you didn’t listen today the Goldman webcast with CEO David Zaslav was good as he shared the vision of the merger. There is lots of great IP and content between Warner/Discovery. The stock price will work itself out over time.

"Ortex reporting 33.45 million shares short in DISCA. AGAIN, DAILY VOLUME IS NOW AVERAGING AROUND 3.0 - 4.0 MILLION, so we are now at almost 10 days-to-cover for shorts. Have fun with that, shorts."
Goes up a little... Crashes double the following day.... One of the most manipulated stocks... So undervalued.... Can't believe how stocks can be controlled... I wish regulators looked into this closely...
There is even no bounce!What a manipulated joke!
"Assuming 2023 estimates of EBITA of $14B and FCF of $8.4B are close. I think growth at ~10 percent YOY is reasonable + debt lowered to 3x EBITA + Synergies savings + EBITA expansion to 12-14x gets you to a price target >$80 by 2025. The price is currently $24.50. Also, Food for thought, if the price of a company goes down but the fundamentals and future prospects improve, that is what I call a buying opportunity. GLTA longs!"
"Sept 8 (Reuters) - The HBO Max streaming service will be available in six European countries on Oct. 26 and will launch in 14 additional territories next year, AT&T T- owned WarnerMedia said on Wednesday.The service will be available in Spain, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Andorra and will include films and series such as ""Harry Potter,"" ""Game of Thrones"" and ""The Big Bang Theory."" The company will announce pricing and additional content details in October.Streaming services are expanding overseas in a bid to grow subscribers as the U.S. market slows. Being early to market is important because of the widely held view that consumers will subscribe to several - but not all - available streaming services.Europe is WarnerMedia's second international rollout of HBO Max, which debuted in the United States last year. In June it launched in 39 territories in Latin America and the Caribbean, where the company is selling two subscription plans, starting at $3 per month.In July WarnerMedia Chief Executive Jason Kilar told Reuters that HBO Max subscriber growth in Latin America will exceed the absolute number of subscriber additions in the U.S. market over the second half of this year and that he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if that trend persists into 2022.On a call with analysts the same day, AT&T raised its forecast for global HBO Max subscribers to between 70 million and 73 million by the end of the year. It previously expected 67 million to 70 million subscribers. nL4N2OY1V5The service's expansion comes as AT&T is preparing to close a deal to combine its media content with Discovery DISCA and focus on its original business of providing phone and internet services."
Would be nice if this reach $29ish
"Dougie kass disposed of most of his shares, if that means anything."
Curious why others would buy this stock? What’s the reasoning for expecting that this will rise? Do you understand the business this company is in and hopes to compete in?
"Have fun today, shorts."
"Disc A shares closed Tuesday at 25.16. They opened Wednesday around 25.40. In two days the markets have risen 3 percent, with the Dow jumping nearly 1200 points. Disc has risen. But only 55 cents from its week nadir."
"In July 2011, Netflix was $43.26. In October 2012, it was $7.72. It is now $573.The DISCA 2019 pre-pandemic low was $24.095. DISCK is at a point where weak hands sell while investors who don't use leverage & who diversify their portfolio buy to hold for months or years."
bought more :p
"This is a waiting game. My cost base is 29$ and i am not worry about it. I went to listen conference call and i am even more bullish. We need to understand that in 6 months disc+ gain 18M suscribers, they are rolling it out in another countrys. So if we assume that they will have 22-25M suscribers until the end of the year that already give you massive revenue boost. Last Q 750M in FCF on a enterprise value of 28B, and that FCF is low now becouse of capex which is use for rolling disc + and other stuff. So FCF will grow, revenue will grow and they are not buyback shares becouse of merger. So merger is just a plus, a big catalyst to drive this stock higher, even if doesnt happen they will use FCF to buyback shares and reduce debt significantly even if they wanna lavarage at arround 3. So this look like perfect storm, ready to explode soon. It is just boring. So take a brake and just watch you will be rewarded."
My first day ever waking up as a DISC Long. 25.80 average for me on A shares. Like I said yesterday I believe she will rise today-tomorrow to mid-27s. Because retail investors think this is super cheap. Then I will sell. Godspeed. Bullish for today.
"Applying a P/E of 8.5, the new company WB Discovery should have a mkt cap of about 90B. The 29% (Discovery ownership in the new company) of 90B is 26B, so the double of the actual market cap. This analysis doesn't include the potential growth and the sinergy due to the merger."
Is this stock ever going to go up??? What a disaster for my portfolio. Oh well.
Does the CEO really get paid 25 million a year?
"Why is there such a huge gap in % change in price today, between DISCB (up 23.1%) and DISCA (down 1.2)%?"
"HBO Max is currently available in the U.S. and, as of June, in 39 territories in Latin America and the Caribbean. But it may be a few more years before HBO Max has a full rollout in major European markets like the U.K., Germany, Italy and France due to an ongoing licensing agreement with pay TV provider Sky, which is expected to expire in 2025. (via @THR)"
What’s the difference between DISCA and DISCB besides voting rights? Why is DISCB higher in share price than DISCA?
I think the last of the old cheerleaders - “low volume Sid” - has deleted his account. He likely has sold. he was super positive and optimistic and everyone liked his comments. You must understand this business. Disc will bleed hard tomorrow. The reckoning is here.

Good buy moment. No way it can go much lower even if there will be financial crisis
"I have also become bearish now. Not because of the fundamental but technical. All indicators pointing further downsides. I also did a quick review of the price history of this stock as someone mentioned it. In 2017, one of the greatest year in recent market history, this stock has a peak-to-trough decline from 29.9 to 19.3. In other words, once this stock falls it will fall hard. Will open more naked short calls (in addition to the covered calls I already have) at market open."

Frustrating to see exactly what I thought would happen to this stock happen. Even with a bubbly market. I covered too soon. This company is a bundle of risk with no dividend. I hope I’m wrong and this surges but I see more red tomorrow.
The high short interest + the long dated sweeps are the only thing keeping me in this
"Another reason I have become bearish (or at the very least not expecting any large gains soon) is that the price actions of T and DISCA are intimately linked since the merger. Check out the minute price charts of T and DISCA today or any day since the merger announcement. They are exactly the same! It is obvious that institutions are arbitraging the prices of both stocks since the merger. Now you may ask: Chun Yu, what are the implications of this? The first one is very obvious. If you want DISCA to rise, T has to rise too. Thus, simply throwing money at DISCA hoping it to rise is pointless. You are just throwing money at the arbitrageurs. Second, what are the chances of T rising significantly (>10%) in the near future so that DISCA may rise? My point of view is that it is slim to none, T being a dividend stock and staying at high 20s to low 30s for the past year or so due to its own fundamental problems.Therefore, in the short term the price action of DISCA will simply linger at the current levels until one of the following happens: 1. the merger goes through or 2. the merger failed. Both will be positive for the price IMHO since the stock is currently undervalued but simply hampered by the arbitrage situation as mentioned above.My play on this in the short term is simple: selling covered calls/covered strangles to generate cash flow. You can also ""wheel"" the stock by selling short puts then sell covered calls when assigned. Personally I would target $22.5 puts and sell them on down days and $27.5 calls and sell them on up days."

"WB+DISCA Merger is too delayed, NFLX is growing stronger daily nearly $300 BILLION Co, that gives NFLX the advantage. Cheap access to money, compensation.. WB+ DISCA merger should hv completed by end of 2021.. This is dragging on, costing them, giving NFLX more time to distance the advantage.."
Michael Burry also bought about 800k shares at 27.* price.It just can't be that bad)). I hope we will see 28 after conf call.Wish you good weekend 
"With daily volume now so thin, how will 24.74 million short shares ever cover?"
"I've yet to hear a plausible explanation from shorts, as to how 33M short shares cover when daily total volume is now hovering in the 3-4M range. Not mathematically possible, without causing a major spike in price."
mega squalor ... even in the green market is unable to resist
Quicksand. Who wants to be 43B in debt. Are the Board or Directors of DISCA sure they want this deal?

"The price is down, every paycheck I add 20% of it. This month I’m actually happy I managed to add more. When it skyrockets, I’ll quit my job and retire. I don’t care about the trends, I did my math, this company is going to x100"
Current Fair Value per Share = EV (enterprise value) - Debt ÷ outstanding shares = 30B - 12B ÷ 506 mil = $35. share undervalued by $10.
"I wanna know who is selling this, because is not a big guys volume is dry. I think is trigerering stop losses day after day.  Ah cheep shares for us longs. Trading at x8 FCF, you are not gona find better deals somewhere else. Time will give returns. Next year i expect this return huge amount."
very sad situation
"stick with your Discovery accumulation plan, folks ...monthly"
This stock is disgustingly cheap.
"AT&T stock has stagnated for years because they paid big dividends instead of investing in next-generation infrastructure. They overpaid for Time Warner, then failed to realise the value of that asset. AT&T & Discovery have both dropped after the merger announcement because the market can't assess the potential value of Warner Bros Discovery. On top of this, AT&T are halving their dividend after the merger completes. Telecoms is a low margin business with huge infrastucture costs. AT&T has a P/E ratio of 18.74. Verizon has a P/E of 11.29.Streaming media is a high growth business. Netflix has a P/E of 62.25 & Disney has a P/E of 107.8. DISCK has a P/E of 12.38. No one knows when DISCK & AT&T will bottom, but the potential upside for Warner Bros Discovery is much better than that for AT&T."
"for some minutes in the after market it reach the disca. After the merger they will be the same stock, so before or after they will have the same price, almost surely it will be higher than now"
Two-hour RSI is finally back over 30.00 and pointing up....

I have kept averaging down on this one. Big mistake. I have a mid-27 average now and am way over exposed. I thought we'd see a reversal. The shorts were right on this one.
The big boys sure playing cat & mouse game last few days. It sure looks too cheap here.
diska one of the worst stocks on my watch list and also in my portfolio ... I made a big mistake buying this company stock.
"If is god down more i will increase my position, buying since 30 dollar and reducing my cost. Fundemntals will catch up, if you have long horizone, right now this is ridiculous. If it goes down the 23.90 i am buying more, but this seems like impossible. This is one of the cheapest stock in the market, seems like it never goes up and this is where victory will be achive if you start buying, or dont buy there is players eho are ready to jump. Even if merger doesnt happen this is cheap, very cheap. I dont knoe if you notice but they have a lot of cash ready, instead of bb shares and reducing debt, but if you read last Q you will see they reduce it. FCF is massive in this valuation."
Stock down 10% YTD. Shorts with short attention span think there is still meat on bone. This is primed for the longs!!!
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
There are 2 main things keeping shares in a holding pattern. One is that the deal doesn’t close for another 8-9 months. The second is that I believe that people believe there will be a lot of AT&T share holders that will be selling the new company when it is formed and buyers can just wait until then and maybe even get shares at a better price. Personally I think the downside here is less then $5 and upside is $25 to $50 in the next 1-3 years. So I’m buying now and betting big! Discovery also previously traded up to $77 because there was more buying then selling. Who’s to say that can’t happen again.

"This is obvious but also worth repeating. DISC removed any “buyout”Premium when the Warner deal was announced. They gutted shareholders, who would have benefited from speculation that Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Comcast, ANYONE would buy them out for $20-$25 billion. Now valued at half that."

Great buy!!!!

according to fintel FINRAthere were 71.67% shorts today!The largest amount of short I ever saw on DISCA!Shorts definitely want to see DISCA/DISCK below 25/24But I saw as well some resistance at least.Don't know who won this battle.
"Just saw this on Twitter: Discovery price target lowered to $27 from $38 at UBS! Well, that makes opening $27.5 strike naked calls very attractive!"
Red day Again
This painful to hold lol
Literally every single thing I have said since $35 has come to pass. I got yelled at for shorting WAY too late then. I take no pleasure in people losing money. I take solace in maybe having saved some prospective longs their hard earned cash. Now the bleeding resumes. Congrats shorts.
Shatner lives! About 100 hours of Discovery programming coming out of that launch.

There was heavy blocks of selling today at two levels: 27.20 and then later on at 26.85. This is going to close near the lows even as market has fully rebounded. Another winning day for those with short positions. I don’t see this reversing in the near term.

On Discovery+, Dobrik will join homey fare from networks like HGTV and the Food Networks as well as series from the company’s core offering, the Discovery Channel; Dobrik’s show is, presumably, a gambit to find content to draw in younger audiences who are more used to their entertainment coming from YouTube or TikTok videos than full-length TV shows. The streaming service launched in January and had accumulated 18 million subscribers through August.(via @Forbes)"
i ammgoing to venture and say that disca combo with t holding this back
Polish Senate pauses media bill that could force independent network owned by U.S.-based Discovery off the air
"4 man race - Netflix, Disney, Amazon and Warner Bros. Discovery. Content is KING and Warner Bros. Discovery has it in spades."
I have 8000 shares of T and wonder what DISCA investors think of the pending sale/merger? Most of the small investors over at T are ambivalent. Some #$%$ others happy. I'm neutral but still holding my shares and my breath.
John sounds desperately negative...lol...I wonder why. bought some myself today
With 16% 25 mil shares short and funds are scrambling to take positioms. Short squeeze is inevitable. It is a matter as to when not if. Do your own DD.
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
By FAR the worst investment I've ever made.
false breakdown. we'll see what happens tomorrow. hello shorties
@ JOHN gotta go now. must take another nausea pill. every time you post big increase in nausea pill sales.
In at an average of 26.30. Couldn't pass it up. Looks like media stocks are going to be on the rise today!
My only stock in green today!
"Volume is now so ridiculously low, shorts in DISCA are effectively trapped. This stock is incredibly ripe for a $2 - $3 upward squeeze. Regardless of all other factors, for that reason alone, I will HODL."
Best content and management. Will one day be worth more than nflx
Paper-thin trading volume today. Makes shorting-based manipulation by HFs easy.
Great buying oppt. Will go back up to the $40-50 soon!
"Short calls filled successfully. You can short the stock however you want, shorts/hedge funds/investment banks/etc :)"
"good quote from Peter Lynch:""just because the stock price goes down doesnt mean you're wrong, just because it goes up doesnt mean youre right."" dont make a decision based on price movements only."
"Huge volume, HBO Max launch in Europe is approaching (Oct-Nov), time to accumulate more shares."
"Funny how quiet the board is when the stock goes up, but if it goes down all the shorts crawl out and start shouting. I guess Shorts are like Libs, all mouth - no substance."
A great buy if your investment horizon is 15 years+.
"To all investors looking for a licit platform to invest and make profits; the stock market trading is like sailing a ship on a rough sea and if you ain't got an experienced captain at the deck, your ship is sure to crash! Likewise, trading, the importance of a mentor is never overlooked, cos no matter how good the strategy is,you might get confused at a point and that's where the expertise comes on and if not properly guided,it will result in a whole lot of losses. That's why it's pertinent to have a very good trader to guide you. Crypto still remains the Future of Finance, I will advise everyone to make investments no matter how little. The pandemic has been a perfect eye-opener for us all to really see how life can be without your usual income stream. You can reach him on T*eIegram at Fullerton_markets"
"Capco Asset Management, LLC buys Discovery Inc (New Position)"
"Just an FYI ..D E Shaw's avg price is about $29.45 ..Michael Burry (Scion Asset Mgmt) avg price is about $28.80 ..Burry bought back a significant portion of the shares he sold off (before the Archegos disaster) in March ..the low price in March was $34.60 ..he's evidently added to his position since then ..if he thought $34.60+ was a good price to get back in, he must really view the current price as extremely undervalued ...do your own DD"
bizarre reactions again between the class shares....B shares down 10%.
Equity Investment Corp Buys Discovery Inc (Added Position)
This stock could easily get a 5 or 10% boost by announcing that they intend to clean house and return CNN to a news organization not a propaganda factory. The first step toward recovery is realizing you have a problem.
Could be details imminent on the Warner Discovery deal. It’s about time.
only down $52.12 in past six months. What a great stock !
"I have the proof on ThinkorSwim that Citadel automatically moves DISCA against retail traders' big buys. Stop this now, or Sec. Gensler gets a letter, with all my evidentiary proof, by Friday."
"brutal day, but strong finish?"
UBS: Let's help usher out all the short positions in DISCA this morning.
"This is what I found in seeking Alpha:While possibly dead money for a year, Discovery is my favorite media name for the next five.The combination of AT&T’s WarnerMedia and Discovery creates a streaming giant with more content than Netflix.Malone is the Warren Buffett of the media world. The next decade at Discovery could be similar to what he did with Charter Communications (stock up 4.5x in 8 years).HOLD TIGHT TO YOUR SHARES..AND DO YOUR OWN DD."
All I care about with this stock is the high short interest.
"On TD Ameritrade, TipRanks elevates DISCA up to 8 (from 7 yesterday) on a scale of 1 to 10."
switched from disca to disck
Everyone on here is now short DISCA. I wonder what that suggests about what's coming next.
This is crime. The price right now is at big discount. The hedge fund guy who sold 19million share affect the stock but this is great time to enter. this is the price to hold on for long term to make your income on a stock.
"Remember trust the process. When something is cheap it will not stay cheap for a long time, i also checked short % and is pretty high."
"Discovery is today revealing Discovery Sports Events as the new corporate brand to represent our global promotion & events management arm, previously known as the industry renowned Eurosport Events."
"According to MarketBeatDISCA's book value is 24.64$ per share.(Netflix book value is 24.98$ per share)Usually it is really hard to bring the market value of the company below its book value.You have to be ""gifted"" to do this.But I belive in Zaslav. He can do it!"
"Streaming - even if successful - is an incredibly low margin biz. DISC’s sole profit generators right now - cable advertising and telco carriage fees — are slowly dying. In the case of carriage fees, those currently account 30 percent of their operating profit w HUGE margins. Streaming has ZERO carriage fees."
"Burry, Paulson, DE Shaw, bought into Discovery Inc. last quarter. This gives me confidence in my own research. With the stock price now lower than what those intelligent individuals bought for. This price is a steal."
"So increadbly easy to munipulate this stock. Take it down to $26, run it back up to $28, then down to $26 again. Can get sleepy just watching this action."

Gene and other longs. I do wish you luck. I’m on your side for the moment. But please tell me: why would anyone buy this when they can buy an alternative dividend paying equity (T) that is actually DOWN YOY and provides a stake in the growth part of this equation.
Lolol all the longs climb out of their shells today gloating. I stick around on green and red days. Congrats fellas.
"The aftermarket manipulation was very interesting.Somebody decided to buy more shares aftermarket,But shorts were still on guard to manipulate down.They just shorted more."
What a gift. Long long long call.
What's wrong with you?

"Why this look exactly like nokia 6 months ago, and DBX 1 year ago. Same think happen, many bears bashing it, laughing at me, telling me i am delusional and bam 50%+ on both stocks after that and all of them were gone after. Never soon them again. Guys if you are not adding at this lvl and reducing your cost base, you must be clueless. Go check last Q, check FCF check forecast, and then check valuation. Trust me, dont forget what i said. Put this stock in your portofolio trust me. See ya in 6 months."
"This is worth $40 right now purely bc it will own 29% of Time warner, the market cap is way too low."
This is acting the way AMC should be acting.
"Upperwestsid is v delusional, this isn't going to squeeze. How many times do I have to repeat this?"
This have to do with put options thing
"I have discb not sure what the difference is apart from price , what am I best off having b or a"
T destroyed this stock
This share price actually goes … up?
"I wonder when this garbage will go into the growth stage or at least stop falling? More and more often I start to think that I live in a matrix, every time I buy, the stock falls, so this time, I bought 300 shares at a price of 28, I thought it was a good price and on the same day the stock began to fall, at first stocks in 2 days fell by 7%, then by another 4%, and to be honest, I'm in a wild frustration, since a reversal is not visible yet. I am amazed by such companies that seem to be doing well with their business and their finwiz card also looks pretty good, but if you look at the chart, this company has absolutely no growth, look at the chart and you will see that the stock price fluctuates on average for many years from 25 to 30 and changes are very slow. If the share price tends to 19, to the prices when the pandemic began, then what can be said about this company, what words? Only things like garbage, vomit, ugliness and poverty and so on come to mind."
Why do the A shares and B shares trade so differently?
"Wanting to sell this B and buy K, same deal with all when merge"
Great news from Poland
"New this morning on TD Ameritrade: DISCA is now increased by TipRanks to an ""8"" (on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being highest)."
I have a $DISCK addiction every time I see it on sale I buy more!
$$$ cash flow machine Getting 20 cents on the dollar invested here Couldn't care less on what the ticker price is going to do in the next quarter or twoInvestment is putting money to get money back later from the asset. Not by selling to somebody else but what the asset itself will produce. If you are an investor you are looking at what the asset will do in our case the business. If you are a speculator you are looking at what the price of the object is going to do independent of the business.
