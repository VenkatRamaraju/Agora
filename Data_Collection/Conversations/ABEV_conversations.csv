"I just can't figure this company out, they have a pile of money, yet, they don't pay a dividend and don't buy back some of the 4.4 billion shares they have floating. How long are we supposed to wait to see some of our money back? Patience is wearing thin."
"$2.50 coming, watch! $2.50, then back to $1.50, trading 16times earning is expensive earning little money@pennies. Sell Brazil is not making money their etf ewz is down 15percent to date. Once us markets drop and really correct more then you'll see ambev low $2's if not $1's"

Ambev is a strong buy and will be back at 5 - 7 dollar range post COVID. It's a safe bet.

disappointing this stock can't break the 4 dollar mark.
there is a real big problem with this company.
"We're looking at $3.90 to $4.20 by October. Shares are oversold and the buying pressure is picking up. You see the same in BUD, DEO, STZ, and BF-B. This is not exclusive to ABEV. Plus, the absolutely massive and ridiculously unusual open interest in October call contracts tells me that somebody knows something is ""brewing."" --Pun intended."
Just keep buying. $6 stock by end of 2022. Easy double

"With the gyrations of the share price lately, I am beginning to believe the big boys are trying to stampede the weak hands into selling so they can buy cheap. I am playing their game and adding."
Have to be one of the cheapest best stocks trading right now. This price is like a fire sale.
