Earning beat.! Up 10% in pre market trading
i think ambev shares are pretty good deal here ... buying and holding for the long term ...whatever the long term may be these days
"With the gyrations of the share price lately, I am beginning to believe the big boys are trying to stampede the weak hands into selling so they can buy cheap. I am playing their game and adding."
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Fairstox.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Have to be one of the cheapest best stocks trading right now. This price is like a fire sale.
"I just can't figure this company out, they have a pile of money, yet, they don't pay a dividend and don't buy back some of the 4.4 billion shares they have floating. How long are we supposed to wait to see some of our money back? Patience is wearing thin."
Do you think AMBEV will be strong again?
"BUY BUY and BUY MORECovid is ending, people loosing the fear to hang outBeer consumption will pop, and so ABEV's EARNINGSSo, buy now wile is very undervaluedIt's a double in a few months"
$3.00 Coming very soon! ABEV will be $5+ by next year100% gains from here!
"$2.50 coming, watch! $2.50, then back to $1.50, trading 16times earning is expensive earning little money@pennies. Sell Brazil is not making money their etf ewz is down 15percent to date. Once us markets drop and really correct more then you'll see ambev low $2's if not $1's"
Earnings should be coming around 10/28/2021.
"Going back to $3.'s, buy low sell higher! EPSD in week ABEV will earn.Special Divy on way, we should get paid!"
"IKt's a Buy $3.00-$5.00 coming! Unbelieveable SP and Bovespa record highs AMBEV, VALE, PBR lows... PBR lmao!Braclays Upgraded! AMBEV easy $5.00!! been down 2 months+"
there is a real big problem with this company.

"Ambev SA · Earnings release date · Q3Thursday, November 4, 2021"
Ambev is a strong buy and will be back at 5 - 7 dollar range post COVID. It's a safe bet.
Awesome report showing some major turnaround in Brazilian market .
