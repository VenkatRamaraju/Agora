"Ambev SA · Earnings release date · Q3Thursday, November 4, 2021"
"ABEV should run north $7.00 soonIn Rio de Janeiro for a vacartion week,Never seen so many people in the streets hanging out and DRINKING lots of BBERPeople are losing the fear, pandemic is ending. BEER consume will top!"
"Beer sales in America must be tough. In states like mine, the tax is so high that Bud costs $7.29 for six bottles, then add sales tax."
On the verge of break out. Target price 5.40$ unless there is bad quarterly earning next week.
"This stock is gonna take off, countries are opening back up, people are going back out vaccine is here, patience, this stock has a lot going for it, I am long, it will move up, my opinion"
Time to Dump and Run!! $2.50 next stop!!!!! Oucccchy AMBEV no growth or money!!!$2.00 then!!!
Do you think AMBEV will be strong again?
"This looks like a company that could pay a decent dividend, based on financials. It could have a much better stock price and better support if it paid even a 2% dividend."
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Fairstox.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."

what else is there to do in the middle of a pandemic but hang out inside and drink beer? i dont get it. why is this company not doing better? it is a consumer staple stock. i can survive on just drinkong beer for at least a month ...maybe longer
$3.00 Coming very soon! ABEV will be $5+ by next year100% gains from here!
has the world drinking habits changed to fruit juice? common people drink more beer. salty snacks for everyone!
there is a real big problem with this company.
FYI. Dividend declared of $0.099. Going ex-div 12/20/19. Pay 1/7/20.

I need help with this stock. $50 billion revenue with 10-15 billion earnings. Why is it trading at $2.93 a share?? Just started looking at to start a potential stake and don't understand this at all.
i can't believe a beer company is down during a pandemic. what else is there to do during a pandemic but drink a nice cold beer?
"Did you know that Ambev makes up 4% of the entire Ibovespa in Brazil? The Ibovespa is an index like the Dow in NY. That means Ambev is a huge company, a driver of the Brazilian economy. Thought that was interesting and wanted to share it with you all."
3 million share buy at end of day Friday. Excited for this one.
"When in the world is this company going to throw something our way in the form of a dividend. If it does not go in price per share, it should give us something for our effort. Patience is running short, I have held since 2011."
I jumped inRelatively Strong balance sheet Lots of cash and people will continue to need to drink (non alcoholic and alcoholic) beverages ... probably see 50% gain in next 6 months
"IKt's a Buy $3.00-$5.00 coming! Unbelieveable SP and Bovespa record highs AMBEV, VALE, PBR lows... PBR lmao!Braclays Upgraded! AMBEV easy $5.00!! been down 2 months+"
4.61 entry point. Close to the 52 week bottom. Company seems solid. What am I missing? Will this be at $5.00 in a month? Inquiring gamblers want to know.
https://discord.gg/NvDC7TNR
"Heineken in the first half year suffered a loss, that means that ABEV is most likely to suffer an even greater loss for the first half year. That's probably why some institutions decided to sell 2 days ago.What do you guys think? Keep everyone updated! :)"
"$2.50 and under $3 very soon sell. Market correction coming, Delta Covid will crush reopening and Abev will get hurt as well. $2.50 lmao."
This is the calm before the storm. Be ready for the earnings call on the 29th.
"With a solid balance sheet and improved earnings outlook, the low stock price presents a takeover target!"
"AMBEV is a solid company financially but due to pandemic crisis she is struggling a bit right now. The good news is that there is an Ex-Div date on Jan 14th, 2021 and the vaccines are being distributed as I type. Hold it for 6 months and this will double and you wont regret it."
Buy and hold with diamond hands!!! Let's drive this up to $30+
"If it hits 2.4 or 2.5, new chance to buy."
https://discord.gg/Neu2HZC
"$2.50 coming, watch! $2.50, then back to $1.50, trading 16times earning is expensive earning little money@pennies. Sell Brazil is not making money their etf ewz is down 15percent to date. Once us markets drop and really correct more then you'll see ambev low $2's if not $1's"
2.26 - 2.28 is a nice entry range
"I think we're overdue for an analyst upgrade on ABEV. One year target should be at least $4.00, IMO."
I'm in. 2.75. Copa America (Argentina & Colombia) coming in July. people can't go to the stadium but they can watch t.v and drink. They own the biggest beer brand in Argentina and Colombia. Large moat. if it dips below 2.50 I'll pick up more.
Market is miss pricing ABEV they reported earns 8 cents a share US on increasing revenues
"Buying this stock at $2.25 is a gift that one should jump on amidst no chaos. Patience, and you will be well rewarded."
"As ABEV supply half the world with beer it is a very strong buy from me. When the dust settles from this virus, this stock will sky rocket. Just look at what the average price has been over the last 5 years. It will be quite the return on your investment. The world needs beer now more than ever!"
"I live in Brazil for 20 yrs so I am familiar with this company. The Real just got a lot stronger so the price on the ADRs will reflect that change. Also just a rumor but I heard over the weekend that a Chinese company is interested in buying Ambev. No way to know if that is true or not. I like the company a lot. Beer is huge in Brazil, always has been always will be."

i have remained in isolation for four months now and survived on drinking beer and eating nuts and berries. this company stock should be going gangbusters. beer is a life saver and a consumer staple. it has many good nutrients .

Go time!
Have to be one of the cheapest best stocks trading right now. This price is like a fire sale.

C’mon!! Over $3 this week!
Alcohol consumption has increased 33% in the USA since the Pandemic. I am sure it has also increased in Brazil and elsewhere.
"We're looking at $3.90 to $4.20 by October. Shares are oversold and the buying pressure is picking up. You see the same in BUD, DEO, STZ, and BF-B. This is not exclusive to ABEV. Plus, the absolutely massive and ridiculously unusual open interest in October call contracts tells me that somebody knows something is ""brewing."" --Pun intended."
"07/26/19 (FRI) - What a pop yesterday for ABEV. My short signal went off big time. This morning should be where I short 3k shares, but I won't get to this time as I have all my money tied up in a few other stocks. Oh, well. Nature of the game."
"Going back to $3.'s, buy low sell higher! EPSD in week ABEV will earn.Special Divy on way, we should get paid!"
PATIENCE = GREAT PROFIT! HOLD...
hold...
I can’t believe we are down premarket like this when the earnings report couldn’t have been better. Crazy upside in this stock. I guess I’ll add more this morning.
Imagine how this stock would be doing if their beer would be good...
ready to buy more @ 1.89

"ABEV is so under-appreciated. Here's a beer distribution company that regularly delivers operating margins on par with the leading software companies in the world. 25% of each sale translates to free cash flow. There's obviously currency risks to consider, but those are far outweighed by the greatness of the company overall. Don't get me wrong, not a stock that's going to get you rich overnight, but one that can deliver nice gains over time. Few better ways to play the Latin American market in my opinion. Good luck ABEV longs!"

Many Brazilian analysts have increased their price target. This will fly!!!
As I said earlier AMBEV is the biggest Brazilian Bull on NYSE! Enjoy the ride up!
CBD Drinks In AMBEV’s Future!?
Come on this stock has been awful lately
"$13B in NI, $52B Market Cap. Is this actually trading at a PE of 4? Outstanding B/S, consistent profits every year. How is this not trading higher?"
"I couldn't believe the stats on this until i saw the 15 billion shares outstanding, yikes"
why such a huge sell-off in one day? Is there any news on this stock?
Awesome report showing some major turnaround in Brazilian market .
https://go.trade-ideas.com/SHAQ
"For me this stock is about 3% of my portfolio. This stock will be one of the largest gain % wise if there is a vaccin and/or herd immunity works, compared to other countries Brazil is significantly affected by the pandemic. Ambev managed to still be profitable, but that was primarely due to diversification in other countries. Once Brazil will recover, this stock will be accelerated.My 6 year to 8 year price target for Ambev is 10 USD. In the short term this could possibly retest the 1.80-2.00 lows."
"CoVid will resolve in time, buy while this is down. Brazil is a developing market, they dominate the S and C American market"
"Little confusing, if we look at the numbers, brand position in market etc...some call it fundamentals etc....how would one explain, match or beat expectations and trading PE Ratio (TTM)17.91 all this in region where the doors have been closed and now ramping up to full on open? Any comment please. p.s. I'm buying."
I gave this company & stock enough time/$$. I hoped earnings would give a bump up over $5 and was ready to capture gains. hopefully this will rebound a few % and then I'm out. It looked like it was heading up.
$3.00 today!?
Earnings should be coming around 10/28/2021.
Huge numbers and a great earnings report. This should move us over $3.00 easily.

Buy ABEV at these levels while you can easy 50% upside in the next 6 months!
Looking at the Brazil market getting slaughtered due to the news. The other Brazilian stocks I follow are down around 6 to 7% so all in all at least abev is better than the general market.
is there any indication that AB InBev will buy the remaining 38% they do not own ?
"Buy low and sell high is the theme, got in @ $2.40 yesterday around 15K shares. US is recovering from Corona fatigue and South America is next in line for mass vaccinations. In my opinion, ABEV will be trading around $4 in few months. Hold is the word and you will not regret. ABEV has been very generous to me for the past year and this year wont be any different."
Who's loading up?
"I just can't figure this company out, they have a pile of money, yet, they don't pay a dividend and don't buy back some of the 4.4 billion shares they have floating. How long are we supposed to wait to see some of our money back? Patience is wearing thin."
I honestly just think that there is lots of value here. We closed 2019 at $4.66. We are now trading at $2.20. Down like 53% in 3 months. Again I realize that the world is basically shut down but it will eventually come back albeit at a measured pace. The first thing I look at before investing in a company is their debt. I was surprised to see how little debt ABEV has compared to their massive market cap. I even looked it up on like 3 different sources to make sure. It is basically not leveraged at all and is very financially strong enabling it to weather this crisis. Once medicine and eventually a vaccine is developed there is no reason why this and other businesses wont be back to normal. I started buying today. Up to 37k shares and would like to add another 10k or so on weakness....
"I recently rec'd a free share of this for signing up with Webull. ""Looks at recent price graph. Goes down almost every day. Held it less than an hour and sold."""
"Guys, at this pandemic time all are having some kind of financial crisis. You can check this for some social media job offerings:source:http://evanallen1000.qlitrk.com/r/arman1"
the stock manipulation ive recorded it well send it in see what happens pretty blatant
https://go.trade-ideas.com/SHFB
Last opportunity to buy this low. Going up soon.
"The company seems to have a solid base, and speculators seem positive about the prospect of ABEV improving market volume. Moreover, viewing has changed over time, and this company is capitalizing on the growing need for a video on demand. https://shr.link/MassiveIndustryTakeOver"

This is an easy $2.75-$3 by years end.
Ambev is a strong buy and will be back at 5 - 7 dollar range post COVID. It's a safe bet.

new investment for me .. will accumulate if price drops further

"Same trading pattern as AOBC within the last year (see chart), and then last Friday, AOBC jumped 43% in one day!Be patient, trust your research, keep buying, and then wait for the big upward pop. After-all, the game is to buy low and sell high."
"In Brazil, AB InBev's second largest market, the company sold 11.9% more beer in the fourth quarter than a year earlier, with nearly a third of the population benefiting from the government's ""corona voucher"" payments."
get rid of all the spam on this forum.
"This isn’t going anywhere.. just like Vale, GE.. solid fundamentals but the float is way too high to see strong returns, unless they are buying back shares."
"With the gyrations of the share price lately, I am beginning to believe the big boys are trying to stampede the weak hands into selling so they can buy cheap. I am playing their game and adding."
$2.50 next stop! Unload! Unload!! ABEV $2.50 then $2.00!
Last minute trade 6 M shares with a green candle. Someone big is accumulating.
After elections this should keep moving up and sumner around the corner Brazilians celebrate with a cold beer!
couldn't resist adding more at $2.23 today

"zero reason for it to be this low. they have weathered corona and lockdown very well. 7.7% increase in volume, 20% increase in revenue and 13% increase in gross profit compared to last year's Q4they are ahead of schedule for their renewable/sustainability goalsthey have increased their cash reserves to $3b usd / R$17b"
Unbder $3.00 very soon will close $2.90's Market correction in midst just started will last another month and ABEV $2.30!$2.30!!!!!
never saw a wider disparity between market cap and share price. Wow.
Just keep buying. $6 stock by end of 2022. Easy double
I sold today. This stock seems to hit $2.80 drop to $2.60ish and rinse and repeat. Seems to be a trading stock and not a holding until this covid situation improves in Brazil. So I will play it until I miss the boat. This stock is also given as a free stock to people signing up for certain brokerage accounts so alot of small fish here with the volume plays. People pumping and dumping. I do neither although I like the stock. One day this will increase but I am not holding until then. I will trade in and out.

"ABEV > The LARGEST and most PROFITABLE BEER group of the worldStunning balance sheet, earnings much better than expected2018 All time High = $7Now at BARGAIN = $3Strong Buy and Hold, a no brainer"
"ABEV, one of the largest and better managed BEER & BEVERAGE companies on EarthThis jewell is very undervalued. By a conjunction of factors, f ex, the pandemic thatreduced its revenues in 2020. But pandemic and quarentines are getting over.People got locked too much long. Forbidden to hang out, party and drink.Now that the population is getting FREE again.They will DRINK and PARTY as never seen before.Because, they want to compensate the months in isolation, they dont know if they will alive next year.They don't when will happen another pandemic like this, etcSo ABEV's revenues and earnings may recover violently,Remenber ABEV all time high is U$7 just 2.5 years ago.Way way below the $3 now. Huge up side. no brainer BUY"
i think ambev shares are pretty good deal here ... buying and holding for the long term ...whatever the long term may be these days
"Nothing fundamentally wrong with AMBEV. The Bovespa stock index dropped 8 percent, and Brazil’s currency weakened to a record low of 5.71 against the dollar on the news Brazil’s popular justice minister quit on Friday. Hold tight; we may see some softness in the short term until the political environment normalizes."
https://discord.gg/zKW7V74
"My prediction is a 6.00 USD level in 2022 after there is a vaccin and the consumption of beer is back on previous levels. Don't look too much at your portfolio: I bought on average 2,43 USD (I did some swing moves to lower it before). Upside of 150% in the next few years and currently I am down 5,7%."
"COVID numbers in brazil and most of SA has been going down. with summer coming as well, sales should become relatively more stable.. doubt this has anywhere to other than up over the next 2-3 months"
"Earnings beat? If I’m reading it correctly, it looks like they had approx $2.6B in revenue and $0.026 per share in earnings. Both beats.https://api.mziq.com/mzfilemanager/v2/d/c8182463-4b7e-408c-9d0f-42797662435e/0e421b53-fe17-9e1f-fabc-4ef9183af386?origin=1"
Bought in today
Anyone know if they are still paying dividend and if so when?
"Looks like someone bought 200,000 Jan ‘21 call options this morning. $2.50 strike price @ around 40 cents per. Pretty bullish move!"
Picked some up here today at $2.27. This stock is down over 50% ytd. They have basically no debt (about $600m) compared to their $35b market cap. This week S and P rated their debt stable even in this global crisis. Yes times are tough with this global shutdown but things will improve later this year and next. I am adding here on any weakness....
that 4.40 barrier is one tough wall to break through
Long term stock?
$2.50 next stop but fist $2.90 close coming lmao sell!

"07/08/19 (MON) - A short signal went off for ABEV last Friday, so I shorted 3k shares at $4.97 a little earlier today. Should be able to cash out within 48 hours. Let's see, eh?"
"All world major indices @ record highs, Dow Jones,s&p, Nasdaq, Bovespa, but ambev still at lows lmao get ready when market corrects this will be $2.50 under, in $2's"
PATIENCE = GREAT PROFIT ! HOLD...
"The market pressure downwards will pressure Ambev down to the 2,20 USD - 2,30 USD region at least is my expectation. There are strong bearish signs in the market today (!) - good if you want to buy lower.- I saw the signals early, but I don't want to sell, I still have a lot of cash on the side as a hedge for a downturn -I am long on Ambev average 2.48; personally if I was patiened I would be waiting untill the bearish signals fade. Goodluck and stay safe."
Curious if folks thinks AMBEV S.A has a strong enough balance sheet to make it through the COVID crisis?
What do you think if I bought in now ?
3$ is the next target
Earning beat.! Up 10% in pre market trading
"reinstatement of the dividend so soon is great news. this will be a great stock to hold long term, even if brasil will be slow to recover from covid"
"ABEV not only produces beer but also carbonated soft drinks (CSD), other non-alcoholic beverages, malt, and food products.

Buy the dip...

Keep in perspective that we haven’t seen these levels in 10 years! This is an incredible buying opportunity for short term or long term investors - buy now while you can at these levels folks will still be drinking beer during and after this COVID stuff blows over.
