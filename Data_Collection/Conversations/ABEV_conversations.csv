"ABEV is so under-appreciated. Here's a beer distribution company that regularly delivers operating margins on par with the leading software companies in the world. 25% of each sale translates to free cash flow. There's obviously currency risks to consider, but those are far outweighed by the greatness of the company overall. Don't get me wrong, not a stock that's going to get you rich overnight, but one that can deliver nice gains over time. Few better ways to play the Latin American market in my opinion. Good luck ABEV longs!"
why such a huge sell-off in one day? Is there any news on this stock?
"my cost basis is $2.26, so I can afford to hold. but I didn't buy this stock for the growth. I bought for the dividend primarily, and recession proof business model secondarily. I can understand and fully agree with cutting the dividend during the 2020 covid shutdown. But it's gotta be raised soon or I'm out. Anyone want to speculate when we may see more normal Divy levels? I would be happy with 3% and, with these super low bank rate times, pretty sure it would attract more institutional investors and pop the price up. I just can't understand why ABEV is hesitating."
This is an easy $2.75-$3 by years end.
Huge numbers and a great earnings report. This should move us over $3.00 easily.
"I recently rec'd a free share of this for signing up with Webull. ""Looks at recent price graph. Goes down almost every day. Held it less than an hour and sold."""
"the balance sheet is very healthy .... i don't think it is bleeding money ...so what is the issue? this company will recover when we have a vaccine ...and things improve ...next year ...until then buy and hold ..it is very cheap here .. in fact, i would be afraid some company will come in and scoop them up before it fully recovers."
"If it hits 2.4 or 2.5, new chance to buy."
disappointing this stock can't break the 4 dollar mark.
Picked some up here today at $2.27. This stock is down over 50% ytd. They have basically no debt (about $600m) compared to their $35b market cap. This week S and P rated their debt stable even in this global crisis. Yes times are tough with this global shutdown but things will improve later this year and next. I am adding here on any weakness....
To the moon!!!!
Market is miss pricing ABEV they reported earns 8 cents a share US on increasing revenues
I heard about ABEV the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Last opportunity to buy this low. Going up soon.
Very nice move today
Here in Brazil all the restaurants and bars are closed due to the virus threat. Ambev profits will be affected by this but I doubt they will post a loss because people still drink at home and more people are at home. As soon as the economy opens back up things will go back to normal. I'd give it a year.
when are they going to increase dividend?
I gave this company & stock enough time/$$. I hoped earnings would give a bump up over $5 and was ready to capture gains. hopefully this will rebound a few % and then I'm out. It looked like it was heading up.
the in 52 week 4.72
I honestly just think that there is lots of value here. We closed 2019 at $4.66. We are now trading at $2.20. Down like 53% in 3 months. Again I realize that the world is basically shut down but it will eventually come back albeit at a measured pace. The first thing I look at before investing in a company is their debt. I was surprised to see how little debt ABEV has compared to their massive market cap. I even looked it up on like 3 different sources to make sure. It is basically not leveraged at all and is very financially strong enabling it to weather this crisis. Once medicine and eventually a vaccine is developed there is no reason why this and other businesses wont be back to normal. I started buying today. Up to 37k shares and would like to add another 10k or so on weakness....

"great revenue year after year and great assets, this is under value! I will buy tomorrow I am sure it will go up.."
Alcohol consumption has increased 33% in the USA since the Pandemic. I am sure it has also increased in Brazil and elsewhere.
fire management
can somebody help me here had this stock for about 2 months still 2.36 same as i paid millions traded everday and the stock does not move what gives
"I just can't figure this company out, they have a pile of money, yet, they don't pay a dividend and don't buy back some of the 4.4 billion shares they have floating. How long are we supposed to wait to see some of our money back? Patience is wearing thin."
3 million share buy at end of day Friday. Excited for this one.
Good day today!
mentioned in an article... may cause some traffic...
"This stock is gonna take off, countries are opening back up, people are going back out vaccine is here, patience, this stock has a lot going for it, I am long, it will move up, my opinion"
that 4.40 barrier is one tough wall to break through
"I think we're overdue for an analyst upgrade on ABEV. One year target should be at least $4.00, IMO."
"ABEV should run north $7.00 soonIn Rio de Janeiro for a vacartion week,Never seen so many people in the streets hanging out and DRINKING lots of BBERPeople are losing the fear, pandemic is ending. BEER consume will top!"
FYI. Dividend declared of $0.099. Going ex-div 12/20/19. Pay 1/7/20.
As I said earlier AMBEV is the biggest Brazilian Bull on NYSE! Enjoy the ride up!

"My prediction is a 6.00 USD level in 2022 after there is a vaccin and the consumption of beer is back on previous levels. Don't look too much at your portfolio: I bought on average 2,43 USD (I did some swing moves to lower it before). Upside of 150% in the next few years and currently I am down 5,7%."
what else is there to do in the middle of a pandemic but hang out inside and drink beer? i dont get it. why is this company not doing better? it is a consumer staple stock. i can survive on just drinkong beer for at least a month ...maybe longer

"Aren't the dividends paid every quarter for this company. In 2017 and 18 , they were paid randomly and then in Dec of 2019 and nothing afterwards. Can anyone here explain this?"
What do you think if I bought in now ?
"ABEV, one of the largest and better managed BEER & BEVERAGE companies on EarthThis jewell is very undervalued. By a conjunction of factors, f ex, the pandemic thatreduced its revenues in 2020. But pandemic and quarentines are getting over.People got locked too much long. Forbidden to hang out, party and drink.Now that the population is getting FREE again.They will DRINK and PARTY as never seen before.Because, they want to compensate the months in isolation, they dont know if they will alive next year.They don't when will happen another pandemic like this, etcSo ABEV's revenues and earnings may recover violently,Remenber ABEV all time high is U$7 just 2.5 years ago.Way way below the $3 now.

"ABEV > The LARGEST and most PROFITABLE BEER group of the worldStunning balance sheet, earnings much better than expected2018 All time High = $7Now at BARGAIN = $3Strong Buy and Hold, a no brainer"
This is great news! wont be long before this hovers around 4.00 and paying a quarterly dividend!
ambev is a buy at this low price ... also look at diageo deo ... pays a decent dividend too just like ambev... people will drink their troubles away in times like these ...i am not a big drinker but i could use some of the hard stuff ..

"I added some shares at 2.37 just now. Tried getting it at 2.36 and waited for a few hours, but the orders of bigger players are first in line. Averaged my purchase currently at 2.43 USD. I will add more when it goes towards 2.19-2.24. Hope you guys are more patiened."
"Did you know that Ambev makes up 4% of the entire Ibovespa in Brazil? The Ibovespa is an index like the Dow in NY. That means Ambev is a huge company, a driver of the Brazilian economy. Thought that was interesting and wanted to share it with you all."
Today I bought a smaller position at the level of 2.41 usd HOLD!
"$13B in NI, $52B Market Cap. Is this actually trading at a PE of 4? Outstanding B/S, consistent profits every year. How is this not trading higher?"
"As ABEV supply half the world with beer it is a very strong buy from me. When the dust settles from this virus, this stock will sky rocket. Just look at what the average price has been over the last 5 years. It will be quite the return on your investment. The world needs beer now more than ever!"
This thing has been on a $0.70 slide for 2 months. I'll check back when it is closer to $2.90.
I wouldn't be surprised if it breaks 4.49 today.
I can’t believe we are down premarket like this when the earnings report couldn’t have been better. Crazy upside in this stock. I guess I’ll add more this morning.
"ABEV not only produces beer but also carbonated soft drinks (CSD), other non-alcoholic beverages, malt, and food products. It also provides isotonic beverages, energy drinks, coconut water, powdered and natural juices, and ready-to-drink teas under the Guaraná Antarctica, Gatorade, H2OH!, Lipton Iced Tea, Fusion, Do Bem, Pepsi, Canada Dry, Squirt, Red Rock, Pepsi-Cola, Seven Up brands, and Palm Bay and Mike's brands. Check it out. Oversold!!!"
"For me this stock is about 3% of my portfolio. This stock will be one of the largest gain % wise if there is a vaccin and/or herd immunity works, compared to other countries Brazil is significantly affected by the pandemic. Ambev managed to still be profitable, but that was primarely due to diversification in other countries. Once Brazil will recover, this stock will be accelerated.My 6 year to 8 year price target for Ambev is 10 USD. In the short term this could possibly retest the 1.80-2.00 lows."
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"The market pressure downwards will pressure Ambev down to the 2,20 USD - 2,30 USD region at least is my expectation. There are strong bearish signs in the market today (!) - good if you want to buy lower.- I saw the signals early, but I don't want to sell, I still have a lot of cash on the side as a hedge for a downturn -I am long on Ambev average 2.48; personally if I was patiened I would be waiting untill the bearish signals fade. Goodluck and stay safe."

"This looks like a company that could pay a decent dividend, based on financials. It could have a much better stock price and better support if it paid even a 2% dividend."

"So, here’s the idea.. after several months of holding this stock, Friday I was thinking, should I load up as many shares as I have money left in my account, so if there is an election pop (that’s th expectation anyway), I’ll be able to finally exit this stock? Long story short, I didn’t load up in the fears that it might go the other way (unlikely). I’m hoping the election will keep Brazil moving forward, so I can stay long. I’m sure people have more shares than me, but my 6000 shares could definitely be working better for me! Good luck everyone - election is tomorrow."
"Heineken in the first half year suffered a loss, that means that ABEV is most likely to suffer an even greater loss for the first half year. That's probably why some institutions decided to sell 2 days ago.What do you guys think? Keep everyone updated! :)"

"We're looking at $3.90 to $4.20 by October. Shares are oversold and the buying pressure is picking up. You see the same in BUD, DEO, STZ, and BF-B. This is not exclusive to ABEV.

Confused... Should i buy now or wait for a dip?
I sold today. This stock seems to hit $2.80 drop to $2.60ish and rinse and repeat. Seems to be a trading stock and not a holding until this covid situation improves in Brazil. So I will play it until I miss the boat. This stock is also given as a free stock to people signing up for certain brokerage accounts so alot of small fish here with the volume plays. People pumping and dumping. I do neither although I like the stock. One day this will increase but I am not holding until then. I will trade in and out.

"$ABEV is a marco (Brazilian Real, pandemic) and fundamental story. Stick with the macro story buying now at the trough at $2,30's. Fed policy to tolerate a bit more inflation than target is a positive catalyst for the Brazilian Real. While in the Brazilian front the Congress favored a balanced budget for next years fiscal period. While fundamentals are set to return back to normal (not the best margins) once Covdi 19 is containd. Short term target $4,5. Looking forward to see how institutional players react in the $3-$4 range. I'm a short term bull and long term neutral."

"This stock went down because in Brasil the coronavirus is more severe than in other areas. Besides that there was a high number of unemployment and high inflation in the country. Together with other currencies increasing in value compared to the Brazilian own currency, causes a high risk cocktail.Nevertheless: their earnings result, balance sheet, and cash flow surprised me to the upside.After selling at 2,98 USD I bought in again with an average of 2,48 USD.If Ambev keeps dropping I'll keep adding to around 2,20 USD. I doubt it will drop below it, but I do see a possibility for it to reach 1,80 USD."

"Nothing fundamentally wrong with AMBEV. The Bovespa stock index dropped 8 percent, and Brazil’s currency weakened to a record low of 5.71 against the dollar on the news Brazil’s popular justice minister quit on Friday. Hold tight; we may see some softness in the short term until the political environment normalizes."
"I wanted to buy into ABEV at 2,51 USD. But that place is reserved for the big players.So, I bought into 2.52 USD. If it continues to tank (like the technicals suggest) I will be adding more positions.I'm a bearish bull."
