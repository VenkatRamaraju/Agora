"I just can't figure this company out, they have a pile of money, yet, they don't pay a dividend and don't buy back some of the 4.4 billion shares they have floating. How long are we supposed to wait to see some of our money back? Patience is wearing thin."
2.26 - 2.28 is a nice entry range
"Buying this stock at $2.25 is a gift that one should jump on amidst no chaos. Patience, and you will be well rewarded."
ready to buy more @ 1.89
"$2.50 coming, watch! $2.50, then back to $1.50, trading 16times earning is expensive earning little money@pennies. Sell Brazil is not making money their etf ewz is down 15percent to date. Once us markets drop and really correct more then you'll see ambev low $2's if not $1's"
Picked some up here today at $2.27. This stock is down over 50% ytd. They have basically no debt (about $600m) compared to their $35b market cap. This week S and P rated their debt stable even in this global crisis. Yes times are tough with this global shutdown but things will improve later this year and next. I am adding here on any weakness....

why such a huge sell-off in one day? Is there any news on this stock?
"Maybe we can get the Reddit crowd to notice this stock, lol. This stock actually does have a future and is just beaten down."
I can’t believe we are down premarket like this when the earnings report couldn’t have been better. Crazy upside in this stock. I guess I’ll add more this morning.
"This stock is gonna take off, countries are opening back up, people are going back out vaccine is here, patience, this stock has a lot going for it, I am long, it will move up, my opinion"
On the verge of break out. Target price 5.40$ unless there is bad quarterly earning next week.
$4.00 soon

I'm in. 2.75. Copa America (Argentina & Colombia) coming in July. people can't go to the stadium but they can watch t.v and drink. They own the biggest beer brand in Argentina and Colombia. Large moat. if it dips below 2.50 I'll pick up more.

i can't believe a beer company is down during a pandemic. what else is there to do during a pandemic but drink a nice cold beer?
Have to be one of the cheapest best stocks trading right now. This price is like a fire sale.
"All world major indices @ record highs, Dow Jones,s&p, Nasdaq, Bovespa, but ambev still at lows lmao get ready when market corrects this will be $2.50 under, in $2's"
I wouldn't be surprised if it breaks 4.49 today.
"For me this stock is about 3% of my portfolio. This stock will be one of the largest gain % wise if there is a vaccin and/or herd immunity works, compared to other countries Brazil is significantly affected by the pandemic. Ambev managed to still be profitable, but that was primarely due to diversification in other countries. Once Brazil will recover, this stock will be accelerated.My 6 year to 8 year price target for Ambev is 10 USD. In the short term this could possibly retest the 1.80-2.00 lows."
never saw a wider disparity between market cap and share price. Wow.
Very nice move today
Curious if folks thinks AMBEV S.A has a strong enough balance sheet to make it through the COVID crisis?
https://discord.gg/Mju3QqF
"Did you know that Ambev makes up 4% of the entire Ibovespa in Brazil? The Ibovespa is an index like the Dow in NY. That means Ambev is a huge company, a driver of the Brazilian economy. Thought that was interesting and wanted to share it with you all."
will grow again
"Heading into summer in the southern hemisphere. ABEV's sales are in the southern hemisphere, NOT in the US. The dollar is falling against the currency's of the countries ABEV's sales are in."
that 4.40 barrier is one tough wall to break through
earning may 7. Might be an interesting week!
"This will head North from here. Summer is ending in Brazil next quarter will be much better and with vaccinations things will start reopening, dollar hasn't been as low since 2016. Buy with both hands thats a bull. AMBEV all the way!"
"ABEV, $3.05 + 9% on pre market right now!Whatch out shorters .... Good news coming"
"My prediction is a 6.00 USD level in 2022 after there is a vaccin and the consumption of beer is back on previous levels. Don't look too much at your portfolio: I bought on average 2,43 USD (I did some swing moves to lower it before). Upside of 150% in the next few years and currently I am down 5,7%."

4.61 entry point. Close to the 52 week bottom. Company seems solid. What am I missing? Will this be at $5.00 in a month? Inquiring gamblers want to know.
Slow and steady wins the race.
After elections this should keep moving up and sumner around the corner Brazilians celebrate with a cold beer!
"Aren't the dividends paid every quarter for this company. In 2017 and 18 , they were paid randomly and then in Dec of 2019 and nothing afterwards. Can anyone here explain this?"

"I wanted to buy into ABEV at 2,51 USD. But that place is reserved for the big players.So, I bought into 2.52 USD. If it continues to tank (like the technicals suggest) I will be adding more positions.I'm a bearish bull."

"ABEV, one of the largest and better managed BEER & BEVERAGE companies on EarthThis jewell is very undervalued. By a conjunction of factors, f ex, the pandemic thatreduced its revenues in 2020. But pandemic and quarentines are getting over.People got locked too much long. Forbidden to hang out, party and drink.Now that the population is getting FREE again.They will DRINK and PARTY as never seen before.Because, they want to compensate the months in isolation, they dont know if they will alive next year.They don't when will happen another pandemic like this, etcSo ABEV's revenues and earnings may recover violently,Remenber ABEV all time high is U$7 just 2.5 years ago.Way way below the $3 now.

C’mon!! Over $3 this week!
Up up and away in my beautiful booze balloon.
i have remained in isolation for four months now and survived on drinking beer and eating nuts and berries. this company stock should be going gangbusters. beer is a life saver and a consumer staple. it has many good nutrients .
"Buy low and sell high is the theme, got in @ $2.40 yesterday around 15K shares. US is recovering from Corona fatigue and South America is next in line for mass vaccinations. In my opinion, ABEV will be trading around $4 in few months. Hold is the word and you will not regret. ABEV has been very generous to me for the past year and this year wont be any different."
"country opening back up, lets eat, drink and be merry, my opinion"
"the balance sheet is very healthy .... i don't think it is bleeding money ...so what is the issue? this company will recover when we have a vaccine ...and things improve ...next year ...until then buy and hold ..it is very cheap here .. in fact, i would be afraid some company will come in and scoop them up before it fully recovers."
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend http://tradenow.xyz. They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."

"2.24 looks like a really good possible entry, slightly higher is fine too.There are a lot of risks involved with Ambev; do your research well!"
"I think we're overdue for an analyst upgrade on ABEV. One year target should be at least $4.00, IMO."
Really? 4% drop in afterhours? -_-

"If it hits 2.4 or 2.5, new chance to buy."
"seems some resistance in the share.....I keep buying,,,after corona this is a double"
As I said earlier AMBEV is the biggest Brazilian Bull on NYSE! Enjoy the ride up!
"$ABEV is a marco (Brazilian Real, pandemic) and fundamental story. Stick with the macro story buying now at the trough at $2,30's. Fed policy to tolerate a bit more inflation than target is a positive catalyst for the Brazilian Real. While in the Brazilian front the Congress favored a balanced budget for next years fiscal period. While fundamentals are set to return back to normal (not the best margins) once Covdi 19 is containd. Short term target $4,5. Looking forward to see how institutional players react in the $3-$4 range. I'm a short term bull and long term neutral."
"This looks like a company that could pay a decent dividend, based on financials. It could have a much better stock price and better support if it paid even a 2% dividend."

This is an easy $2.75-$3 by years end.
Looking to get in but I would look to see <$2 price
Here in Brazil all the restaurants and bars are closed due to the virus threat. Ambev profits will be affected by this but I doubt they will post a loss because people still drink at home and more people are at home. As soon as the economy opens back up things will go back to normal. I'd give it a year.
"I live in Brazil for 20 yrs so I am familiar with this company. The Real just got a lot stronger so the price on the ADRs will reflect that change. Also just a rumor but I heard over the weekend that a Chinese company is interested in buying Ambev. No way to know if that is true or not. I like the company a lot. Beer is huge in Brazil, always has been always will be."
"The market pressure downwards will pressure Ambev down to the 2,20 USD - 2,30 USD region at least is my expectation. There are strong bearish signs in the market today (!) - good if you want to buy lower.- I saw the signals early, but I don't want to sell, I still have a lot of cash on the side as a hedge for a downturn -I am long on Ambev average 2.48; personally if I was patiened I would be waiting untill the bearish signals fade. Goodluck and stay safe."
Are bars and restaurants beginning to reopen in Brazil?
Brazil covid new cases going down recently. ABEV recovery soon?
Looking at the Brazil market getting slaughtered due to the news. The other Brazilian stocks I follow are down around 6 to 7% so all in all at least abev is better than the general market.

Any comment please. p.s. I'm buying."
"This stock went down because in Brasil the coronavirus is more severe than in other areas. Besides that there was a high number of unemployment and high inflation in the country. Together with other currencies increasing in value compared to the Brazilian own currency, causes a high risk cocktail.Nevertheless: their earnings result, balance sheet, and cash flow surprised me to the upside.After selling at 2,98 USD I bought in again with an average of 2,48 USD.If Ambev keeps dropping I'll keep adding to around 2,20 USD. I doubt it will drop below it, but I do see a possibility for it to reach 1,80 USD."
Just jumped in at $2.25. Only up from here!!
Does anyone know the DATE they report earnings? Why has the SP dropped 15% in 2 months? Will it ever get back to $5? So many questions...never buying a foreign company stock again.
Market is miss pricing ABEV they reported earns 8 cents a share US on increasing revenues

I honestly just think that there is lots of value here. We closed 2019 at $4.66. We are now trading at $2.20. Down like 53% in 3 months. Again I realize that the world is basically shut down but it will eventually come back albeit at a measured pace. The first thing I look at before investing in a company is their debt. I was surprised to see how little debt ABEV has compared to their massive market cap. I even looked it up on like 3 different sources to make sure. It is basically not leveraged at all and is very financially strong enabling it to weather this crisis. Once medicine and eventually a vaccine is developed there is no reason why this and other businesses wont be back to normal. I started buying today. Up to 37k shares and would like to add another 10k or so on weakness....

"my cost basis is $2.26, so I can afford to hold. but I didn't buy this stock for the growth. I bought for the dividend primarily, and recession proof business model secondarily. I can understand and fully agree with cutting the dividend during the 2020 covid shutdown. But it's gotta be raised soon or I'm out. Anyone want to speculate when we may see more normal Divy levels? I would be happy with 3% and, with these super low bank rate times, pretty sure it would attract more institutional investors and pop the price up. I just can't understand why ABEV is hesitating."

"ABEV is so under-appreciated. Here's a beer distribution company that regularly delivers operating margins on par with the leading software companies in the world. 25% of each sale translates to free cash flow. There's obviously currency risks to consider, but those are far outweighed by the greatness of the company overall. Don't get me wrong, not a stock that's going to get you rich overnight, but one that can deliver nice gains over time. Few better ways to play the Latin American market in my opinion. Good luck ABEV longs!"

"For scalpers can maybe try 2.44 and lower buy - 2.50 and higher sell.I buy and hold to make a longterm 200%-300% gain. I think it is good that they managed to still be profitable, despite being active in one of the worst hit areas. The biggest trigger for a rally is when a vaccin comes out. I will add more between 2.20 - 2.30 USD or when a vaccin is there, if there is a vaccin I will even accept a 3.00++ USD level for adding. I could see ABEV potentially retesting a 1.90 USD level. At 2.20-2.30 I will add a small position, sub 2 USD I will add a larger position. My current average price is 2.47 USD."
How does this stock justify a p/e of 33.
I sold today. This stock seems to hit $2.80 drop to $2.60ish and rinse and repeat. Seems to be a trading stock and not a holding until this covid situation improves in Brazil. So I will play it until I miss the boat. This stock is also given as a free stock to people signing up for certain brokerage accounts so alot of small fish here with the volume plays. People pumping and dumping. I do neither although I like the stock. One day this will increase but I am not holding until then. I will trade in and out.
"Same trading pattern as AOBC within the last year (see chart), and then last Friday, AOBC jumped 43% in one day!Be patient, trust your research, keep buying, and then wait for the big upward pop. After-all, the game is to buy low and sell high."
Keep in perspective that we haven’t seen these levels in 10 years! This is an incredible buying opportunity for short term or long term investors - buy now while you can at these levels folks will still be drinking beer during and after this COVID stuff blows over.
"Nothing fundamentally wrong with AMBEV. The Bovespa stock index dropped 8 percent, and Brazil’s currency weakened to a record low of 5.71 against the dollar on the news Brazil’s popular justice minister quit on Friday.

"I think there are a lot of opportunities to buy into this stock slowly; I have secured my position at 2.43 USD on average (you can even buy lower today). I even think 1.80 USD could be retested, but I don't see the probability being high that it will drop sub 2.00 USD 2.20-2.30 range should be possible. You need to have a long breath to make money on this one. I'll keep holding it and in a few years I will look what has become."
I need help with this stock. $50 billion revenue with 10-15 billion earnings. Why is it trading at $2.93 a share?? Just started looking at to start a potential stake and don't understand this at all.

"As ABEV supply half the world with beer it is a very strong buy from me. When the dust settles from this virus, this stock will sky rocket. Just look at what the average price has been over the last 5 years. It will be quite the return on your investment. The world needs beer now more than ever!"

"So, here’s the idea.. after several months of holding this stock, Friday I was thinking, should I load up as many shares as I have money left in my account, so if there is an election pop (that’s th expectation anyway), I’ll be able to finally exit this stock? Long story short, I didn’t load up in the fears that it might go the other way (unlikely). I’m hoping the election will keep Brazil moving forward, so I can stay long. I’m sure people have more shares than me, but my 6000 shares could definitely be working better for me! Good luck everyone - election is tomorrow."
is there any indication that AB InBev will buy the remaining 38% they do not own ?
"$13B in NI, $52B Market Cap. Is this actually trading at a PE of 4? Outstanding B/S, consistent profits every year. How is this not trading higher?"

"Ambev will reinstate its pre-covid position very soon! And, then, by summer time in Brazil it will be in new highs!"
"its a big company, but there isn't any attention from investors!"
Confused... Should i buy now or wait for a dip?
"The company seems to have a solid base, and speculators seem positive about the prospect of ABEV improving market volume. Moreover, viewing has changed over time, and this company is capitalizing on the growing need for a video on demand. https://shr.link/MassiveIndustryTakeOver"
"I couldn't believe the stats on this until i saw the 15 billion shares outstanding, yikes"
