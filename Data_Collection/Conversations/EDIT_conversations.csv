Oh my...will not be a good day for shorts. Moderna prospects gaining traction. Could be a 10+ day.
A cautionary tale. $EDIT $BEAMhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/low-interest-rate-dow-35000-joby-aviation-carvana-coinbase-beyond-meat-investing-11631464939?mod=hp_trending_now_opn_pos2
Wow! Sounds like they invented a whole new technology. Something other companies may want to license too.
Okay. What I got outta it. Positive update. Straight to the point. Everything but results for 101. Mullens is adamant but the September deadline for low dose and mid dose trials. So I expect the results are positive and exciting. But what caught my eye was the bit about updating our cas-12 (301). AsCas12a Ultra with significantly less off target edits. It’s all about the technology. Mullens it seems moving Editas Forward in a big way. I’m confident and sure the market will get the same outta this earning report and update. The market is gonna like this and so will the share price. No reason why we can’t enter September in the $70’s.
Could just be some profit taking.
Hilarious that this stock is rallying when the company is in disarray. Does anyone know why one of the founders of this technology and CMO would leave for opportunities elsewhere….think about that objectively
"With over 1.5 million shares traded in the first hour, you have to wonder what were the shorts thinking was going to happen anyway."
Price predictions for today? I hope it hold above 60 today. I think we’ll see green tomorrow - new month
I expect Editas's share price leading up to Fridays option expiration to fall. Be patient or be ready to add more going into September.
"For those interested to better understand the different dose levels under the varying EDIT-101 cohorts and compare them to the preclinical results from mice and non-human primates, take a look at slides 20 and 21 of the May 21, 2021 presentation. https://www.editasmedicine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ASGCT-2021-MacLeod_final.pdf"
What a fight between green and red today! Very volatile swings
"Cathie Wood covered all bases today. She bought EDIT, BEAM, NTLA, and CRSP."
Drum Roll Please.......... a September to Remember.
What a week and a half!
"Weird price action in CRISPR stocks this morning, they are all over the place."
"The Cas12a Ultra revelation may explain the hiring spree. Management seems confident, market seems bullish, it may truly be time to retake leadership role in CRISPR space with our new Cas12a Ultra sale catching the wind."
"Looks like most, if not all, of CRISPR stocks took a 3%-5% haircut at 1:00 today."
"Not sure if it was mentioned here (Sorry if it was) but I see that 301 was added a third site last month (Nashville, Tennessee). In the ER call they had so much to cover that I guess it was forgotten. What a night and day difference between the old and new management. We have progress, we have updates, soon we have data. https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/history/NCT04853576?A=3&B=4&C=Side-by-Side#StudyPageTop"
Not what shorts want as we move closer to a holiday weekend. Sometimes you get moves like this when their is going to be positive news articles coming out over the weekend.
"Hey, what was the name again of that genius analyst that called out a $20 price target a few months ago? Which company did he work for? I'd like to send them a greeting card because when they slammed the stock I took the opportunity and loaded up on EDIT. And boy, did I well! And I sure hope you did the same. Remember to always question the motives of those giving ""priceless"" advice on WS. Quite a few morons and cardsharpers in the game!"
"The interest in Editas by the stock analyst has certainly grown ever since Mullen took over the company's leadership after his sacking of the previous two CEO's. Todays call had close to double the number of analyst questions compared to previous calls, and even Cory Kasimov, the Biotechnology Analyst at JPMorgan didn't use a surrogate to ask a question, but took the time himself to listen in on the call and asked his own question. The company is in the spotlight, so execution will be critical going forward."
Lots of confidence in all CRISPR stocks. They’re moving in unison for a reason. Behold the future of medicine and the market knows it. It’s gonna be a great week.
"It has been a month since the US PATENT TRIAL AND APPEAL BOARD denied 2 motions from CVC saying: ""Briefing in the current interference is complete, with authorized motions, oppositions, and replies in the second, priority, phase of the interference having been filed. Authorization of a new motion at this time would be disruptive and could impede our goal of securing the just, speedy, and inexpensive resolution of the proceeding. Accordingly, CVC’s request is DENIED.""I am expecting a decision on the priority phase of this hearing to be decided in the near future and a favorable ruling for Editas would certainly enhance and solidify our investment."
"I think we’ll see some articles following sept 29 data updating us on Carlene Knight and Michael Kalberer, two of the clinical participants publicized in May"
"50 SMA is right at 200 SMA, will cross to upside tomorrow."
"“We would be interested in technology licenses and/or in development candidate licenses and/or, if it makes sense, M&A,” Bancel said. “You can count on us to be disciplined.”Unsurprisingly, analysts wanted more on the gene editing news, although executives largely faced questions about COVID-19 vaccine boosters during the Q&A. Moderna President Stephen Hoge piped up to say the company has been watching the gene editing field closely and considering where its mRNA technology could help with “delivering gene-editing cargoes” to different tissues.“We think it's the right time for us to start to expand in that direction,” Hoge said."
Interesting what positive insightful comments from competent management will do for an undervalued security. Also appreciate the thoughts from the investors in EDIT herein. This is a good board to follow.
"I never understood the logic of a crisis taking the whole market down. What does gene editing have to do with an explosion in Kabul? Anyway, it's part of the ""game"" if you have cash you have a buying opportunity"
"I will add, having one person be CEO, President, and Director of the Board is unsustainable for a company with big long term plans. I’m curious how that changes or progresses over the coming years."
Here's the schedule for Cold Spring Harbor. Jennifer Doudna is the keynote speaker. Our Dr. Joung will be there. https://meetings.cshl.edu/meetings.aspx?meet=CRISPR&year=21
"I tried listening again to the conference call especially to the parts where there were overlapping voices. For those of you who have been here long enough you probably remember that Editas had problems recruiting for phase 1 due to COVID so they had data from the first ones that were recruited but they continued to keep it to themselves. They were asked again and again in conferences about it and they always told the press that they will only release data for a full cohort. From what I could hear in the part with audio problems, Lisa is saying that the data from phase 2 is from the people in the 2nd cohort that already had 3 months or more from the beginning of the treatment. This is a complete 180 from the original approach of only releasing info for the full cohort. It only gives me confidence that my previous guess is probably correct, that they did not want to show up saying phase 1 data shows its safe and that is all since it would have been considered by WS as coming empty-handed even though phase 1 was never expected to have any meaningful impact and that from the phase 2 data they can already show something more than just safety. I just cannot think of any other reason to go ahead and release this data for a partial cohort. I have never seen a company releasing bad info in the middle of a phase saying ""in the meantime, it is not working but we keep trying and we will update you at the end of phase 2"" only reason that makes sense is that they saw something that can prove something good. I do not know if it will be in the level of it proves that editing occurred or in the level of having an impact on sight using their tests but it must be something good. The only question is the level of ""good""."
"$CRBU doing well today while all others $BEAM, $NTLA, $CRSP and $EDIT are having down days. Every Gene Editing stock has its day."
FDA approved Pfizer covid vaccine. Welcome to the new era. FDA will have to update its procedures. We will have in the next few years many new cures for diseases that sometimes do not even have a treatment. The sick people must get their chance
What exactly is the Broad Institution's relationship with EDIT or it competitors? From what I understand they are located near EDIT and sell or license proprietary Gene info to companies to better the world ???
"We see now why EDITAS got rid of their EDIT 201 project. They hold the patents to AsCas12a. If this is what they say it is and its a game changer for every company doing cancer gene editing with T cells and NK cells, then EDITAS has a huge leverage over the rest of the market and they have made themselves immediately relevant to this sector of the industry. Could be a huge revenue generating tech for them."
"It has been 45 days since the last motion was presented and denied by the US Patent Trial Appeals Board (PTAB), which is the longest period of silence in this case so far, so I am assuming the panel of judges is deep into their final review of facts in the current CVC vs. Broad et al; CRISPR interference case that began June, 24th, 2019, to determine priority.I am going to go out on a limb and predict the final decision will be rendered within 30 days, sometime around the time the Editas 101 data is announced."
"Since our ceo will speak I don't expect data to be discussed. And as the topic is treating rare diseases, maybe he will give timeline about IND. They promised by the end of the year. Could be now"
Everyone that wants to short is free to do so. I hope you go all in. I don't see some of the guys that were shorting this stock when it was in the mid 40's talking about it going to $20. We are going to start to move up as the market tries to front run the news coming out at the end of this month.
It seems to be a decent sign that we bucked the biotech and gene editing market on the same day our management had a fireside chat with Wells Fargo.
"Looking at the big picture, does anyone see a bright future any time soon?"
"Seems like a shake out of traders taking money off the table. Good news $95, Bad news $35. I'm in!Big news this week one way or the other. Place you bets!!!"
Waiting for the Cold Springs PR.....maybe they don't want to get ahead of the presentation at the conference?
Lots of articles on Moderna planning on entering the gene therapy space. Even if they choose a different company it will still drive up the value of Edit. I am pretty sure we will be $100+ by year end if not the end of the third quarter.
September 28-Oct 2 (The BIG ONE): Intl. Symposium on Retinal Degeneration. EDIT-101 Data from trials expected
"Anybody on this MB know who could that be: That was 08/19/2021- somebody pontifying what would happen to EDIT- but the morning of 08/23/2021- celebrating the shorts are being burned- what do I know- he is an expert at everything: ""Yes, until the options on Friday expire. Personally I am not expecting any earth shattering news at the conference, and don't anticipte any meaningful price movement until next week or beyond.There is a bit of bad news on the horizon, as there will be a triple witching option market day on or about the day Editas is set to announce EDIT-101 data next month."""
400k shares traded in the first 20 Minutes
They had some interesting insights about EDIT on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
wow!!
"Dang folks, shorts are getting burned, where is this gonna land near term? I dare say 88 or so prior to clinical update. I’m thinking this is like the NTLA set up"
EDIT is on a breakout trend. Next stop is $90+
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4452331-editas-gene-therapy-specialist-leading-the-way-in-eye-disease?utm_source=stck.pro&utm_medium=referralNice article about edit
Just hope some real buyout news will come out after the long holiday weekend. Longs stay firm!

"Congrats to all that have held on tight, not just with Editas but other gene editors also. It wasn’t easy keeping strong and required as investors a helluva lot of foresight and faith. So give yourselves a well earned pay on the back.Good news. Significant movement is on the horizon now that preliminary results are starting to filter through with CRISPR. And the results look good. Far too good for others to ignore. We’ve all talked about cash rich Moderna and it’s desire to make the natural move from mRNA to gene editing but what about Pfizer and the other big pharma’s? No way they’re going to allow Moderna to run away from the pack.The CRISPR sector looks set to do a Tesla, capturing future medical dominance with its radical innovation in treating diseases and not just symptoms. Based on CRISPR’s early success and positive trials not to forget it’s radical overhaul of future medicine, Is it too early to see an explosion in share price? I think not!The time is ripe and anyone selling their holdings will live in a world of regret for a long time.I expect big pharma to be ruthless in the near future - pursuing joint works, investing and buy outs that will grab the attention of the market. Not investing in gene editors and CRISPR will be akin to the motor industry not investing in EV. Our moment has arrived…"

Crsp is relatively under value now
would be nice to see a solid breakout above this 68.50 level - technically it would have a nice run after that
There are 3 new positions listed on the Editas Linkedin page this morning. That's in addition to the 30+% increase in personnel this Summer
"Countdown is down to 20 days. Does anyone have any insight or opinion on whether it is typical for the poster presentations to be released and published prior to the actual start date of the symposium? In other words, any chance news of the results gets publicly disseminated before the 29th? I’m guessing the answer is no otherwise why would Editas schedule a company call directly after the symposium presentation."
"A win in the patent case would mean Editas receiving a license fee and royalty payments from others who commercialize their Cas9 eukaryotic research in the US. In a broader sense this is an ideal position when you follow the money i.e., Healthcare = Insurance Coverage = $$$$ vs. agriculture."
"Arbor co-founded by Feng Zhang: "" $VRTX and Arbor Biotechnologies today announced a new collaboration to enhance efforts in developing ex vivo engineered CELL THERAPIES, using Arbor’s proprietary CRISPR gene-editing technology for select diseases"""
"An independent committee looked at EDIT-101 initial data, and said, ok, we think it is safe and practical to give this treatment to children."
"So... To put it in layman's terms, with regards to business implication... SLEEK will allow them to create cell therapy cures (As an example for types of cancer) in a manner that is more efficient (Since they can create most of the cells the way they want them to be so the cost of manufacturing will be reduced, and they will be able to create (And sell) more since they will be able to create the right cells faster, and they will be able to potentially create more cures before others since it will allow them to KO/KI with efficiency potentially something that other companies cannot do as they do not have that efficiency.Did I get that right? Sounds like a huge business impact."
Cas12a Ultra. I firmly believe EDIT is loading up on employees and institutions are loading up on shares because of the promise of Cas12a Ultra. Differentiating platform.
Stay away from this... Zhang and Chinese backed stock can't be trustable and they would cook the data for pump the price... I would rather trust Jennifer Doudna...
I can certainly remember the payday in early JAN after investing at the recommendation of a man I have great respect for: Jeff Brown. So EDIT has been to $90 and it has dumped to $34. My instincts are telling me this stock is gonna make a breakout and run to new highs near $100 plus. Bought a ton today and am buckled in for the ride. It is always interesting to make large contrarian buys on days such as this...
Any news leaks?
"• Truist is basing its upgrade on the upcoming Leber congenital amaurosis 10 (""LCA10"") top-line data readout for EDIT-101, the company's IP portfolio, and scarcity value. • Analyst Joon Lee believes the EDIT-101 data could show efficacy. • In addition, Editas is in a good position in an ongoing CRISPR patent case, which could give the company an advantage in the U.S. • Lee adds that Editas is attractive as a potential partner or target."
It is shocking how this stock is struggling to get ahead these days.
Even in optimistic days like these beam and ntla still are up more % than edit although their mkt cap is so much higher. Just shows how the mkt is eager for real data. I believe we will be very happy Sep/Oct
Good weekend to digest the Cold Spring news.... not so good if your Short... what will Moderna be making of it.....is it ground breaking like their vaccines...
Some of these bears on this chat need to contact EDITAS and sign up for the EDIT 101 adult cohort tests so they can get some vision and see clearly the future of this stock. This isn't a case of buy the rumor sell the news till September. Everyone has been waiting over a year for this news. The results will be positive for sure. Just how positive and how life changing will determine if this stock hits NTLA type levels or not.
I'm new here with 300 shares and I wish  for all of you well!
I feel there are more to this market than we know. Solicitation a genuine course preceding placing assets into this essentially tangled market. I've made more than 6BTC from an assignment of 2BTC all through the latest a month and a half using Steve's help.
"@anonymous, @iamaverb, go to your comments and photon powered from 5 years ago. Good stuff...very interesting lol."
New rising of price target Opennheimer went from 42$ To 80$ :-)
Support at $60??? I’m not a chart guy but hoping so. Hoping a slow ascent til sept results.
If Moderna is only interested in partnering and not acquiring... good news for BMY as they also want to enter the space.
Let’s get some headline Cas12a news by Friday!
What is the exact date when they will release the data of EDIT-101? They said September but September when?
https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2021/08/24/2-stocks-pioneering-1-technology-that-will-change-the-world-forever/
"I've observed after Anonymous wrote ""Meg Tirrell on CNBC hinted that Moderna may consider buying a CRISPR company with its new found valuation and revenues"" the rumor mill started. ""Hinted"" i.e., ""speculated"" i.e., ""a thought popped in her journalist head"", does not make it true, or even in a class of being an actual rumor. And now the rumors are swirling on this board and taking on a life of it's own."
Issued too late to affect the market today.https://ir.editasmedicine.com/news-releases/news-release-details/editas-medicine-presents-data-new-sleek-gene-editing-technology
"Just to illustrate the importance and confidence research institutions place in CRISPR. The US Patent and Trademark Office alone has around 6,000 CRISPR patents or patent applications, with 200 being added every month, mostly from China and the United States."
"""I'm in it for the long haul"" - that's what rookie investors tell themselves as they watch profits disappear time and time again. You've already seen this go down from $100 to $30 earlier this year and I bet the same rookies will sit on their hands and ride it back down to $20 this time around. Meanwhile, those who know what they're doing make money in both directions and I can assure you the next direction for this stock will be DOWN!"
CNBC final trade this afternoon was Editas . Finally some attention on there .
"Hiring per the Editas Linkedin page has increased dramatically. Looks like at least 40 high-end scientific positions over the last few weeks. That's 17%+. Just this morning, 3 more added;Scientist 1-Molecular biologyResearch Assco-Lead Cell lineSenior Scientist-in vivo gene editing.Our company is preparing for something big.....and really soon."
"I just saw a lot of differing opinions on a post from somebody considering investing. This all connects when proven data is released. Many want to see a path to revenue, many, many more than are willing to take a risk on a speculative biotech. Initial results are imminent."
ARKK sold 85k shares today. Very small vs. total position but still an interesting change
"I didn't think there was any new news in the ms chat this morning, but the tone was extremely confident. Another subject....imagine what this stock could do without the constant pressure and manipulation to keep the sp down. To support my point, I only need to point to the MC compared to other genetic co's with even less progress in clinic and much less patent ownership."
Only 267k shares traded as of 10:47am. Looking forward to Mullen’s comments tomorrow morning at orphan drug conference
SLEEK and Cas12a Ultra could provide EDIT a huge competitive advantage.
Got hammered today!
"I feel like folks should be connecting the dots about now that CRISPR works in mice, non primate, primates, etc. and that means upcoming clinical results are going to be positive, showing high efficacy, no off target cuts, and folks are going to be reporting restored or improved vision! It’s hard to underestimate how the press is going to take what i hope will be upcoming interviews and articles with Carlene Knight and Michael Kalberer, two of the previously reported on patients."
"Anyone know what ever happened to J. Brown? Is he still recommending this stock or did he jump ship long ago? He had been waiting for results for over two years on this. Now that we know when, he should be having one of his pumps here soon."
"Over 40 weeks post injection: Thomas Hock@Crisprtalk·15mThe high dose is 3x10^12, The difference seen between 10^12 and 10^13 is not dramatic. 10^12 might be maxing it out.https://twitter.com/Crisprtalk/status/1436330503590846472/photo/1"
"Lisa Michaels “I don't think I fully appreciated this before I came into the field, that every one of the enzymes being used by us and the editors is a little bit different,” she said. “Even the base editing techniques are still somewhat dependent upon the use of Cas9, and Cas12a, which we have complete proprietary ownership of, is a uniquely different approach.” www.biospace.com/article/a-pivotal-moment-for-crispr-in-the-gene-editing-journey-/"
"EDIT made a strong comeback from the lows. Also, DVAX (NOT NVAX) on the move, and Goldman upgraded to buy"
All of this will come down to data in Sept. If the readout isn’t interpreted as great we are going back down.Very exciting to see this thing climb at a consistent clip!
The recent 15-day report shows short interest in Editas fell another 10% and 40% over the last 2 months. It seems the market is beginning to treat the company with a margin of respect.
"EDIT up today , NTLA, BEAM both down. Patent protection and new management team along with results from Edit - 101 coming soon. I think those spreads continue to tighten. Market caps gap will close."
All CRISPR STOCKS should be up big tomorrow.
"IMO, Its really important Editas doesn’t become complacent with its current programs and pace. The markets are having second thoughts on 101, we don’t want that. limitations with 101 like low expected revenue need to be addressed. Now would be an excellent time to re-market and retool some of our programs to better show future growth. Like using the 101 platform to expand into other eye targets and not just LCA10. Proving a modular approach. Markets will love that! Also, It’s time for a serious push for Editas 301 program to take some of the pressure off 101."
This is setting up technically and fundamentally for a big sustainable run. Much better follow through happening with new management.
EDIT run- with NTLA and CRBU backing up- nice team work!All Gene Editing Companies are run by excellent CEOs.
Just listened to the presentation. Repetitious at best. Nothing new. Anybody else listen?btw....5 new jobs on our Linkedin page this morning.

I never heard about EDIT till my Swiss Banking friend told me to get in to gene editing stocks. All the big billionaires are buying up gene editing stocks worldwide. My friend said this is the next wave in to the future with insane gains coming.
"So we all agree we will probably see it go higher in anticipation to the data and then explode assuming the data is good. so... who is selling, all bots everything that we see now?"
"Short positions fell by 1 million shares in the last 15 days and over 3 million shares in the last 45 days to a multi-year low of 7,497,370 shares short. This tells me the smart money consensus is there are just too many catalysts on the horizon for them to remain short. I still maintain next week around the 1st we will see a steady rise in share price until we hear the EDIT-101 data."
NTLA was around the mid to high 70's when they published and they shot up to $160 before cooling off. I anticipate the same type of move for EDIT once the data is released.
"Yep!Nat Harooni DNA@NatHarooni·1hLevel 1:$EDIT-101: “I would like to thank all of the patients who have and will participate in this landmark gene editing medicine clinical trial” -Language seems to imply trial safe enough to move forward. -Recent hiring spree, particularly w/ In Vivo, is Stargardt Tx on the way?"
"I agree , but it will get to over 100$ very fast now"
"I have been adding more since yesterday based on my past comments that THIS time, management/Mullen will not disappoint."
I've done my research thank you all for your guidance !! I have learned a lot and EDIT is amazing SLEEK is a great tool !
"Here are my thoughts from this morning’s 2021 Wells Fargo Healthcare Conference.The conference call was difficult to follow as Wells Fargo had audio issues that had a sound delay playing simultaneously with the live event itself. But here were the impressions that I took away from listening to the event. Keep in mind they were careful not to provide any information ahead of the upcoming data release so this is my take away while trying to “read between the lines” of what was said and not said.I don’t think we should expect meaningful clinical benefit for the first two patients (Adult low-dose cohort). They are still important since they are providing evidence that the treatment remains safe over a longer period of time. It sounds like we will see a lot of variability in terms of the sight improvement amongst the different patients in cohort 2 (adult mid-dose). A key factor will be how much sight an individual patient actually had during their infancy or childhood. My impression from what Lisa Michaels (CMO) said was that there is a lot of variability in people inflicted with LCA10 in terms of visual acuity early in life. And as a result, patients that had better vision and stronger neural pathways developed prior to the disease progression will see better results from the EDIT-101 treatment. So hopefully they learned that earlier enough to be able to use data from their natural study to select patients in the second cohort with a higher chance of realizing more meaningful clinical outcomes because they had better vision longer during their infancy and childhood.The initial patients from cohort 1 have extremely poor vision. Light perception only. They can’t even count the number of fingers that were waved in front of their eyes. The most important observations they got from those first two patients was that the treatment was safe. They didn’t see any inflammation. And in all the follow up appointments with these patients the treatment “has continued to be very good” (presumably she means from a safety standpoint). As a result of the safety indications from the frost cohort, they were able to revise the protocol and use patients in the second cohort with better seeing eyes because it’s a lot easier to measure progress from a baseline if you use patents that have sight that can be measured."
When will EDIT began to act like a winner again?

I like the chart to 99 resistance.
"Here is the game these big asset management firms play in the market. This is how they manipulate the sector. As you see from this quote from the Wall Street Journal below, which is their media puppet to be able to carry out this big short, they all set themselves against ARK and they will manipulate Cathy's stocks down by coordinating their dumps. They will try to drag her stocks down and when the market goes down because of the banking sector being over leveraged, they will prey on this down turn and ARK will be forced to sell their profitable stocks to cover their loses. They remind me of a bunch of hyenas trying to attack a lion. For ARK and SQUARE, TESLA and such, their big play should be BITCOIN. If they can pump BITCOIN before the market starts to tank, they can offset this play by these big asset management hyenas and hold in a neutral position until the market levels off and crypto starts to recover. ARK, SQUARE, TELSA and some of her largest holdings hold large positions in BITCOIN and if BITCOIN can reach 85k-100k in the next two to three months this will give them millions and even billions in revenue to offset any downward move caused by these asset management firms. Although EDIT should pump, it will be short lived because the market may start to dump in the next couple of months and ARK and others are going to be squeezed by these asset management firms who are preparing for this market downturn already.

Put options, which give investors the right to sell shares at a certain price, typically deliver profits to investors when the stock or fund they are betting against declines in value. Several other funds that previously hadn’t bet against the ARK fund took on new positions against it in the second quarter, filings show. Laurion Capital Management held roughly $171 million worth of put options against 1.3 million shares of the ARK Innovation ETF. GoldenTree Asset Management, Moore Capital Management and Cormorant Asset Management also held sizable bearish positions on Ms. Wood’s fund."""
"The breakout is being tested today, a close above 70 would be good."
"EDIT up 9% today. I just don't understand the low volume and this company going bankrupt comments. Are we all seeing and reading the same things here? Lol. Momentum, news all seem pretty positive so far. Am I missing anything? And for those of you on here commenting negative one sentence posts: I'd never call anyone out for being bearish, but geez, can you at least back up your statements with data, information, news, something tangible that we can decipher for ourselves?? Please and thanks."
EDIT They knew they would get data on the adult low-dose and mid-dose cohorts. Yet Editas revealed that the study will also include data from the pediatric mid-dose and adult high-dose cohorts.
"Shake out , onward MARCH ....."
"Regarding the Cold Spring Harbor meeting that starts today and what EDIT will be presenting, this was CEO Mullen on the last conference call: “Additional data supporting the unique properties of our proprietary Cas12a enzyme was recently published in Nature Communications and we plan to present new data on our multi-transgene knock-in proficiency at upcoming Cold Spring Harbor meeting.”"

9 new Editas Medicine scientific positions posted on Editas' Linken page this morning. That's about 50 in the last several weeks.
Bottom line: It continues to drop daily~!
"Can anyone tell me why Feng Zhang's team's research of Cas13a for RNA edit was licensed to $BEAM instead of $EDIT? I think his team is the science advisory panel of $EDIT, no?"
Anyone know when the latest update is supposed to be? Is it before end of year? Thanks
"Now that we got some good fundamental news coming up in a couple of weeks, the manipulators have been neutralized and we can look at some TA. For the hour timeframe, we stalled yesterday around the 66 dollar mark and we began to lose momentum. We have a very thick money wave but we are in for a pull back the next couple of hours it seems. The four hour shows a bullish explosion for the last couple of days but the money wave is almost out and our momentum wave is trending down. We still look bullish but we are cooling off and coming down on the RSI a bit. The daily looks really strong still. Good money flowing into this stock. We are at the top of our momentum wave so we will need to come down a little before pumping back up. The weekly looks a bit better than it has been. It has not confirmed a definite reversal of our bearish trend yet but its about two to three weeks out. If the next two weeks are green, we will confirm a reversal of the bearish trend we had been under for the last several months. On the shorter time frames we are getting a dump as we have a large selling wave but it looks like we have some support at $63 which is stalling the bears for a while until the selling pressure is gone and our momentum wave heads back up. We can see a small pump from here a dollar or less and then roll back down unless we get some money to come in. It will close the day around this price today or lower. IT does not look like we will pump back up to 65 but rather to around the mid $63 level. Long term we have some very good news. Our 50 day moving average has officially crossed our 200 daily moving average at the 43.83 mark creating a golden cross. This is a bullish indicator. The last time we had this, we shot up $60 in a couple of weeks."
Editas Medicine is up 10.70% to 66.84
"Hi. I'm considering investing, was wondering if someone could help answer some questions. So the LCA10 (cure for genetic blindness) is in clinical trials...but I read that leber congenital amaurosis 10 affects 3 per 100,000 births. So, 120 people per year in the US. How much can they reasonably expect to make off that? I understand how life changing it can be, but is there any profit to be had?Even sickle cell treatment, only 70k to 100k Americans have it. It seems like a limited market. Am I missing anything? I admittedly do not know health sector very well.Thanks!"
There has to be a reason for the decline. Always last to know.
As time goes on It’s gonna be interesting to learn if Moderna has bought a position in Editas or Intellia. I suspect that would be the first step in making its intentions known. Both use mRNA as a vehicle for their gene editing package. So both would make a perfect fit for cash rich Moderna who let’s face it needs to grow its business line to justify its valuation. So expect collaborations and accumulating positions in either Editas Medicare OR Intellia Therapeutics.
"More on Cas13b and its significance - work from Feng Zhang's lab:Cas13bt, tiny version of Cas13b, can be used to create RNA editors. They're small enough to fit into a single AAV for in-vivo CRISPR gene-editing delivery."
Shorts putting downward pressure ahead of 9/1 to make it an easier exit? I have no evidence and just speculation why we are down 6% on good volume
"SLEEK enables high efficiency, multi-transgene knock-in of induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs), T cells, and Natural Killer (NK) cellsData support SLEEK as an optimized approach to develop next generation cell therapy medicinesCAMBRIDGE, Mass., Aug. 20, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Editas Medicine, Inc. (Nasdaq: EDIT), a leading genome editing company, today announced data on a new gene editing technology termed SLEEK (SeLection by Essential-gene Exon Knock-in). The Company reported these data in an oral presentation at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory’s Genome Engineering: CRISPR Frontiers meeting, being held virtually August 18-20, 2021.Despite major progress in achieving gene disruption, efficient knock-in of transgenes continues to be a significant challenge for the gene editing field. To solve this challenge, SLEEK was developed enabling high knock-in efficiencies with different transgenes while also ensuring robust, transgene expression. Editas Medicine believes that SLEEK may enable the development of next generation cell therapeutics for cancer and other serious diseases.New preclinical data demonstrated that SLEEK results in the knock-in of multiple clinically relevant transgenes through a proprietary process that selects for cells containing the knock-in cargo. In addition, high percentage knock-in efficiencies were enabled by Editas Medicine’s proprietary engineered AsCas12a nuclease. More than 90 percent knock-in efficiencies were observed in various clinically relevant target cells, including iPSCs, T cells, and NK cells. Additionally, SLEEK may be used to fine-tune the expression levels of transgene cargos, an important attribute of next-generation cell therapy medicines.“We find the new gene editing SLEEK technology to have immense potential, as it enables nearly 100 percent knock-in of functional transgene cargos at specific locations in the genome, which we believe to be the highest in the gene editing field across multiple cell types. We believe that this novel technology has broad applications and may result in substantially improved gene edited cell medicines, including for novel CAR-T and CAR-NK cell therapies,” said Mark S. Shearman, Ph.D., Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Editas Medicine. “We believe SLEEK is an optimal approach to achieve highly efficient multi-transgene knock-in for the next generation of cell therapy medicines, and we are leveraging this technology across many oncology programs, including for treatment of a variety of solid tumors.”"
Sleek is cool but it won’t work in the liver or other deep tissue
Looks like it’s game-on for EDIThttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/editas-medicine-participate-upcoming-investor-120000654.html
when will Mullins announce the date results on the edit-101 ?
"Congrats to Feelthebern5g for his success! Many of us got close last December when this stock hit $99. This time around I am sure many more of us will hit this mark. If you are new, hold on for the ride."
"Okay, question for Edit Longs ONLY plz. What TP do u expect on Monday and at which price level do you think we should add more?"
I think we may hit 70+ this week.
"Good job shorts, kudos for today."
"What's your next play after edit 101 data is out. I hope options many of us bought will give us a nice reward. Are you going to buy more crbu if it stays with low mkt cap? Or options bet on the next company with data that is supposed to be released? (I am still long and don't plan to sell my edit shares, just talking about the hopefully nice gains from the options)"
"Editas will have to update the main page of the website ""WHAT IF WE COULD REPAIR BROKEN GENES?"".It is like Tesla website to say ""What if cars could be electric?""."
"Today move makes me recall early this year downgrade to 25 from garbage analyst working for Gs. Really shame on him, steal cheap shares from us"
"If the September announcements add up, we will see EDIT above 100$ eoy. IMHO"
"Feng Zhang back again with a big hit! Just WOW. Feng Zhang@zhangf·44mCRISPR technologies are powerful gene editing tools because they are programmable. We are excited to describe 3 new programmable systems, IscB, IsrB, and TnpB, some of the most abundant genes on the planet, with potential for gene editing. @ScienceMagazine https://science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj6856#IscB, a transposon-no RNA or CRISPR components are known to interact with it, making its function a mystery.#IscB associates with a new, diverse class of large structured non-coding RNAs, termed omegaRNAs.Naturally occurring omegaRNAs contain a guide sequence that directs IscB to its target DNA. This guide can be reprogrammed to target IscB to DNA sequences.#The small size of IscB (~30% the size of Cas9) makes it an ideal candidate for in vivo genome editing technologies.#functional IscB genes in the eukaryotic cells, in the chloroplast of green algae I. tetrasporus.#Beyond IscB, we uncovered additional classes of OMEGA systems, TnpB and IsrB, that also function as programmable RNA-guided endonucleases and nickases, respectively.#"
"More on Cas13 from Feng Zhang's Team: RNAY editing delivery using 'ultracompact' versions of Cas13. Zhang’s team identified a subfamily of Cas13, known as Cas13bt that are roughly half the size of other enzymes in the family and can fit neatly into an AAV packageThe size of the enzymes are a crucial factor in the ability to deliver the genetic payload hence the importance of Zhang’s lab latest discovery."
"Jeff Brown's latest on EDIT - Editas Medicine (EDIT) confirmed that it will present initial data from the EDIT-101 trial at the International Symposium for Retinal Degeneration (RD2021) on September 29 at 9:05 a.m. ET. Editas will host a webcast for investors following that presentation at 11:00 a.m. ET.And we got a little bit of a surprise. We knew we would get data on the adult low-dose and mid-dose cohorts. Yet Editas revealed that the study will also include data from the pediatric mid-dose and adult high-dose cohorts.This is a great sign. Clearly, the safety data must be great, or else Editas would not be talking about the higher dose cohorts – especially with regard to the pediatric patients.So we are less than three weeks away from our first big catalyst for EDIT. I can’t wait."
"“we find this new gene editing technology sleek to have immense potential, as it enables nearly 100 percent knock in of functional transgene cargos at specific locations in the genome , which we believe to be the Highest in the gene editing field across multiple cell types”."
Does anyone know when we're supposed to hear about data from EDIT 101
"Even though EDIT is down this morning, only 700 shares traded so far pre-market. Low volume. Company has too many good future catalyst to stay down."
"Editas will be participating at the World Orphan Drug Congress USA, August 25-27, Oxon Hill, MD. Our CEO James Mullen will be on a keynote panel discussing ""treating rare diseases"". That will be on Thurs Aug 29 at 9:30 am. I think you would need to pay to listen."
Volume well down. Shorts you having fun. Your day will be soon.
I think this will run again tomorrow. The last time we saw a 10% daily gain it followed up the next day.
Technically we broke through resistance yesterday at 68 and it looks like we are back testing it. If we hold we will pump back up from here. Hopefully we can close above $68 today and establish a level of support at $68 going forward.
Breaking out.
"Editas' furious hiring pace continues. On the Editas Linkedin page....,2 new positions last week, 1 yesterday. And today's, ""Senior Scientist 1, ""In Vivo Gene Pharmacology"". That one says a lot about the conference on the 29th doesn't it?"
I made a meme https://imgur.com/gallery/CPx8muN
"Once again, this is a strong move. Up 5% when sector is down."
Seems that a minimum of a 6B market cap would be fair when Edit 101 results are announced at the end of September. Lebers itself may not be a huge market but an effective treatment/potential cure for genetic blindness is a pretty big deal. CRSP/NTLA responded well
Would not want to be short here especially with current risk - reward. Reward is 8 million short shares that if you pick up 20 points its + 160 million. Risk is if Moderna makes an offer it could be 150 points going the other way ...1.2 billion potential loss. Moderna is flush with cash and a roaring stock price.....I would not discount the rumor.
It was mentioned here in the past that SLEEK is not that exciting as it might take years before it will be in use. Lisa just confirmed they are already using it.
Almost 500k traded the first hour. Volume is really stepping up
EDIT taking some breath. Perfect. Good chance to fill the bags before the chart head to 80 up-to 90 USD.
"I haven’t watched or read the latest Editas snippets but judging from the reaction on this board from a couple of our more level headed posters (Donato) it stands to reason that Editas Medicine has a ways to go before it can claim success. So be patient. I shudder to think where we would be if Collins and Albright we’re still at the helm. Mullens is doing an excellent job in turning this around but it’s gonna take a little more time, it seems."
I missed the Wells Fargo presentation. Anything said thats expected to impact share price today?
Michelle Robertson appears to have an automatic sell set at every $10 increment...
Editas Medicine Presents Data on New SLEEK Gene Editing Technology at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory’s Genome Engineering: CRISPR Frontiers Meeting
Today someone bought 900+ puts with a $57 strike price paying $500k+ premium. Someone knows something about the data coming out later this month. Unless you know something you would not risk half a million on a put expiring in two weeks. I will be doing the same. Data will most likely not be as expected.
"I think the most important piece of information is the mid dose is included. IMO based on comments by Lisa during conference calls they pushed to show this info b/c it’s going to show similarly great results as the other CRSPR companies have shown.Obviously, this is my speculation but I will act to accumulate even more as we progress towards this announcement.Not to mention they are throwing more “weight” into this announcement than previous. They seem to be pulling out all the stops from my viewpoint."
"Looks like we started the next leg up. We will probably go up to 70, consolidate a little, then 80, then wait to the explosion after 101 data.GLTA"
"Hey, I like slow and steady on these things, but 25-30% in a week is acceptable."
As soon as someone says a stock is going to be bought ..2 days later we can be sure to see it dropping..
There is a big disconnect between the NASDAQ (up 141 points) and most gene-editing companies today.
"Excellent resistence. This, CRSP and the other gene editing leaders will be like MRNA / BNTX in a few years. Sit back, enjoy the ride, add on dips."
"EDIT: Another one tomorrow morning r@open Hopefully MS spreads the word over to GS ...LOL can’t wait to see who speaks and if there’s any surprises.9.30 AM on September 14, 2022 MS Annual Global Healthcare Conf (19th)"
Hit hard again today. I guess we are rangebound till 9/29?
"i bought my wife 5562 shares at 42 last month, she is very happy"

Is BLI another gene editing company with more upside potential?
Once it runs thru 70.40 were going to 100Nothing can stop what is coming!
"As usual, I buy and it drops $2 immediately"
"Should not be under 100 at this point. I expect with 14% short interest, Editas will rise to 88 or so by September clinical update if EDIT follows the NTLA model. Hard to say as EDIT is differentiated with SLEEK"
Could anyone please share some thoughts about what will be discussed in the upcoming investors conferences on 10th and 14th of September joined by Editus Medicine. Thanks in advance

EDIT has been hiring people like crazy. I don't see that as being behavior that indicates that a buyout is coming. Why increase your payroll and reduce your EBITA before a buyout? I don't see it.
"Bluster on EDIT in also seen on BEAM MBs: Just two hours back - I was told that I know nothing- but the same person turned his viewpoints in 4 days on EDIT and now his sidekick thinks he was right in calling me out: iamaverb2 hours agoReplied to a reaction$BEAM conversation@RV Please articulate what you are saying regarding CRBU getting an exception. If you are paying close attention, the company is only in phase I with their CB-010 trial, which is a long way off from proving any efficacy, much less getting approval to skip the pivotal phase III trial.@Offer. A phase III trial usually contains 100's if not thousands of patients, not a ""handful"". No offense intended but I am assuming the two of you are new to investing in early-stage biotech firms and have little experience with the workings of the FDA."
Anyone know CEO comments? Hope we see a PR
Expect Green Day today
EDIT turning into a leader with SLEEK and CALITAS
Wow- a nearly 11% increase!
Offer....agree. We are witnessing the change from horse and buggy to the automobile....only it's now drugs to gene therapy!
"So, Meg Tirrell on CNBC hinted that Moderna may consider buying a CRISPR company with its new found valuation and revenues. That’s where these posts are coming from. "

"Something to keep in mind, this company cut their losses on the original EDIT-201 program (healthy donor NK cells cells for cancer) due to competitive landscape (read: product had too low of a chance of success compared to peers) and has publicly stated they are accelerating the EDIT-101 trial. They have proven they will be prudent with their clinical dollars."
"The ruling of no interference means that the courts never heard arguments to decide who the original inventors of CRISPR/Cas9 were, which is the question that UC Berkeley wanted answered in the first place."
"At exactly the moment the press release was issued today at 4:00 p.m. ET, big blocks of 1000+ shares were being traded. Tomorrow morning should catch the shorts back on their heels."
Would not be surprised if shorts try to break this below 60.
Now with SLEEK technology EDIT has a double-edged sword. I see nothing but up from now on. Thanks to those that debated EDIT with me over the years.
"We're all investors here, so any opinions appreciated: sold my remaining 750 shares of NTLA yesterday in order to load up on more EDIT and some CRBU. Mistake selling NTLA? Is the consensus diamond hands bc CRSP, EDIT and NTLA potentially can all hit $300 sooner than we may know? Or timely taking profits and reallocating? Thanks."
"Mullen added another member to the board, Emma Reeve, who is an accomplished biopharmaceutical executive with more than 25 years of global financial experience across pharmaceutical, medical device, and bio-pharma companies."
"I am looking forward to next week and beyond, and hope all of us longs enjoy the success of the long-awaited results. Good weekend to all."
If Moderna rumors are true they will be buying shares getting to 4.99% before they have to publicly disclose ownership at 5%+. Lots of potential upward pressure here.

Looks like the 50 SMA should cross the 200 SMA to the upside around Friday or Monday. That’s a strong technical indicator.
Please come back roaring next week.
looking at the after-hours trading seems like many retail investors are betting on a good Monday. No large transaction but seems to me like much more trades than the usual for after hours.https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/edit/after-hours-trades
This consolidation that’s been happening in the 60s is looking very strong. Bust above 69-70 and we could get a very nice move leading up to 101 data.

If we close above $72 today we will be in a solid position to test $85-$90 before EDIT shares data in a couple of weeks. Where is JB and his usual pump? Now is the perfect time. Maybe since he does not have the element of surprise he is staying quiet. Anyone know what is going on with him?
"Why the pop today? I have been following this stock for years with no real position, but I've noticed a big move up from the 20's now into the 60's. Where is a good place for me to do some DD.

History will repeat itself. We will see same as ntla. 80 by data release. 200 after data is released with the squeeze and then settling down at 150. GLTA
https://www.thestreet.com/tech/.amp/news/editasjdm080921
"My guess is data release headline will be something along the lines of: “EDIT-101 has resulted in no serious safety concerns, has shown productive editing and some vision improvement in cohorts to date. Increased vision improvement is expected in pediatric and high-dose adult patients who are currently enrolled and continuing to enroll.” Realistic expectations are important, and all indications from management and otherwise support that type of data update."
I think many will be disappointed tomorrow. For some reason many hope there will be a 101 update tomorrow while it was clearly announced that it will take place at the end of September. Another thing I see is people hope for 80 after 101 data. Taking into consideration mkt cap of edit and the other 3 I really don't see why the jump shouldn't be closer to 200. If 101 works then edit should be credible for making 301 work as well
Jeff Brown never said to sell EDIT. He is still very high on it. Sent an email earlier this week saying to hold for huge gains and he is very excited about the data release coming soon. I am sure he will pump it more as we get closer to that. Not sure what J. Brown guy Brian is referring to???
"2 new positions on the Editas Linkedin page this morning. Scientific Tech Leader and Research Associate Biological. Not counting, but that's probably over 50 in the last 2 months."
Whoever was the first to call for the share price to rise on the 1st of this month nailed it.
EDIT can easily be a 25B market cap in 5 years. Share Price can get to $350 by 2026.
