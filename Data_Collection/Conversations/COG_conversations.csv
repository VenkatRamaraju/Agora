"I have some interesting tracking observations of comparison for our new company. I have followed Natural Gas stocks for 6 years. At one time or another I have owned RRC, AR, and EQT, never at the same time. I always thought COG was overvalued but I was heavily investment in XEC. You can't help but notice now, that CTRA, AR, RRC and EQT are all trading in the same general price range. Now that our combined company is so much bigger and so well diversified as far as asset base, there is no reason we are not at least leading the pack ahead of RRC. So that is my new stare and compare. We should be trading at a significant premium to EQT and RRC for sure! We are actually going to rival EQT in overall production going forward. RRC is a terribly managed company with extremely high interest rates on its debt. We own the absolute cream of the crop with CTRA. Don't sell it cheap. This really is worth a double for sure. I will be very curious to see where Thomas Jorden deploys our new Capital investment money? Is he going to blow out the Texas Permian, or accelerate New Mexico Permian where he already has lots of drilling permits but will likely not be getting more. Last but not least, they could even revisit some of their gas properties in OK that are low Oil producers. We have lots of options now for sure. Nice to be here! I was not a believer. I am now."
"We do need to hope oil & gas don't go any higher or we will be in big trouble. This is truly bizarre. I happen to own OVV and CNQ as well as this. They are both on fire and have been since the beginning of last week. There is something going on here that we don't know about. I am not even going to speculate what, but this is not right. I am not worried, merely perplexed. Long for long term. I know the company has to be in a quiet period within some period before ER. I think they could at least provide us something like a production update on each area. The fertilizer companies do that within weeks of an ER."
"Lack of buying holding the stock down. Volume is low, but it’s all sales. Bid just keeps getting pulled lower. Fuel prices soaring with no end in sight as little is being done on production and yet this company can’t attract investors. Yet. But the cash flow headed this way is unbelievable. And the gamble of a harsh winter simply adds speculative fuel given the open season to the spot market CTRA has. Faith that our political leadership will notch our energy policy and see fuel skyrocket. And we will prosper on the other side of this mess."
from Yahoo finance stock piles at the biggest US crude oil depot in Cushing Oklahoma is approaching critical low levels that’s all you have to know the last time this happened oil was at $100 a barrel get ready for some big fireworks coming up all oil and natural gas stocks are going much higher this sector is totally overlooked but I have a funny feeling billions of dollars over the next several months will be coming this way this is one of my favorite companies and I also have Sand Ridge energy and magnolia oil and gas and ETFs that spread it around but I think will be at 52 week high‘s before the year is out on all of them.
just about everything I hold is energy related but when we get this next big move over the winter all energy is going to be reset too much higher prices there will be billions of dollars coming in to Oil natural gas uranium and coal it’s getting to the point no matter what fuel switching you do it really won’t matter because you’re all going up in price and they’re going to go up at a much more rapid Pace that inflation the only way people can protect themselves and actually make money is to buy the stocks in these companies or ETFs or whatever exotic wall street paper there is what is we roll through what is sure to be some great numbers these commodity stocks are going much higher and hopefully this is how it plays out for me silver and gold platinum and palladium kind of stay within his trading range I will take my profits sometime during the winter and I will divert around 50% into the metal sector this sector is the most manipulated in the world but as we go forward the confidence in the dollar is going to collapse the average person he’s not going to buy bitcoin and that in itself is a tremendous investment but for Joe blow on the street it’s going to be buying silver silver dimes are going to be the currency of choice as a US government will monitor everything you do over $600 first of all these times are a US currency and second of all they are 90% silver which can be very easily calculated and recognizable 2022 he’s going to experience the results of all the Central planning that these bankers have done since 2008 we are in uncharted waters when you look at Venezuela I’m not saying we’re going exactly there but we’re moving in that direction it has more and more people lose confidence in the US dollar they are going to get out of the system in different ways over these next six months I’m expecting to make a whole Lotta money in energy and then we’ll take it from there.
"We have two nice upgrades today and the stock is still stuck in the mud. In case anyone didn't see the upgrades. Truist actually started coverage with a buy and a PT of 32. Mizuho upgrades to buy and raised PT from 21 to 31. That is a huge move in PT! Disappointing to see no movement from that especially when AR, RCC, EQT and OVV are up much more."
"Unusual low volume is why this stock is so volatile lately with downward trajectory.There are no big buys or big volume, it’s going totally unnoticed. Shorts are are cut in half 2% only. Next week can be interesting"
"Quote from climarex CC back in June. Someone asked how they will approach hedging strategy after merger:""And as we look ahead, I think that we'll look at a hedge program as built to insure our capital program, but also our -- certainly our ordinary dividend, which is increasing. So although obviously, we need to get the NewCo team together and have this debate. I don't think you're going to find any serious disagreement. And I would expect -- and this is -- we haven't had that debate yet, but I would expect that there will be a pretty strong voice that we might hedge a little less going forward than we have currently.And our current hedging program is a programmatic 50% of our volumes. But we'll debate that long and hard. And I never want to get caught up in short-term optimism when we discuss long-term capital planning, and it's really easy to do."""
This first / next earnings reports in a few weeks should be interesting. Many tailwinds within the commodities. Sub par performance from the stock amidst a pile of good facts. I think management will want to make a statement with this first address. Especially with such a loaded deck. They need to validate the merger and generate excitement to appease investors and attract new ones. I think this will be instrumental as the will be just 60’days from free reign to price their goods to a hungry market in peak season.
"@MikeM @big mike You guys keep talking about COG low hedging with our new company, but what about hedging from the XEC side on gas (not talking oil)? XEC is a huge gas producer on its own. I frankly don't know what their hedge position is on gas. This stock should be much higher on COG gas alone but there is much more gas now!"
i’m just reading my energy report that was sent to me by Goehring & Rozencwajg The title is the IEA ushers in the coming oil crisis The decline of oil in non-OPEC producing countries he’s going to give OPEC tremendous pricing power entry gain market share significant potential price spikes may occur because of this there were many things hitting the oil markets that point to much higher prices lack of investment to push by governments for ESG and EV at the same time oil demand is going to grow over the next decade I personally think most people are sleepwalking to this huge wake up call that is about to hit we will soon be at $100 a barrel as world oil supplies shrink we might be $100 stock within a year and that is no joke.
Yahoo???How long will I take yahoo to figure out the stock change? I wish they?d quit dining my phone about this stock being down some huge amount based on its previous numbers. Can it be that #$%$ hard?
"Truist Securities Starts Coterra Energy at Buy with $32 Price TargetandMizuho Securities Upgrades Coterra Energy to Buy from Neutral, Adjusts Price Target to $31 from $21"
"Range Resources going lower today. Hedges gonna choke them for another year. Paying now for sins of the past. Their report puts lipstick on this by saying that 2022 production is less than 50% hedged. And it appears to be at prices just under $4. CTRA is in an amazing position as the spot market is nearly out of control. It’s actually a little scary, but for a producer it couldn’t be a better scenario. Increasing production in a zero hedge environment caught short on supply. This will take off soon"
here in Pennsylvania we’re starting to see much cooler temperatures I think today’s sell off in these energy stocks will be yet for the year the combination much cooler temperatures and the third quarter earnings report is a catalyst for much higher prices to come stay long and strong and by the dips when they occur we’re going to start to see much colder temperatures and I think we are going to have a November like we had a few years ago very cold very early if that’s the case my three biggest holdings is this company right here Sand Ridge energy and magnolia oil and gas will double very quickly.
The amazing part is this should be a $30 stock two months ago I will go out on the limb and say is the oil is right around $85 a barrel and probably going to hit $100 by the end of the year this stock is going to double by the end of January I just bought some more call options we’re going to see a huge up move right before the earnings report or right after but we’re going to go to $30 very quickly.
"Leave it up to Zacks to screw this up totally! This is what the Zacks earnings estimates are fresh off the press today, after market. Someone better get this retracted or we are going to really disappoint next week! This independent oil and gas company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.74 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2944.4%"
it’s so nice to know you’re going to pick up a quick $.50 dividend tomorrow and then as we move through the rest of October and November we’re probably going to see a huge help move in this company when the oil and natural gas companies report the ones that are on hedged are going to have blow out numbers and I’m not saying we are going to have blowout numbers but when you look into the future everything is forward-looking we’re 90 days away and were also increasing production at the same time which is roughly 10% more as the rest of the world has to deal with higher oil prices their business model will suffer that money is moving in this direction watch and see.
"At $80 Oil and $5 Natural Gas this is what CTRA(Cabot and Cimarex) has presented to shareholders:Annual Free Cash Flow of $3.8B or $4.72 per share.Base Dividend of $400M or $.49 per share.Variable Dividend of $1.5B or $1.87 per share.Total Dividend of $1.9B or $2.36 per share (11% dividend yield as of 10/29/2021 closing price)Excess Free Cash Flow beyond Total Dividend of $1.9B or $2.36 per share.It is all right there in the presentations. Take a look at Suncor's (SU) performance on Thursday and Friday. They doubled their dividend and whacked down debt. CTRA will have some very good news this Wednesday morning. Hiking Dividend, Debt Knocked Down, Buybacks etc.....Wall Street has been playing games with this stock this year. The company has spelled it all out for investors but you notice CTRA is getting very little publicity and the the merger news was mostly negative. The ability to allocate capital to their various basins is going to make this an absolute cash flow monster. I would love to hear them say Wednesday how undervalued they believe their entity is and a decent percentage of Cash Flow is going towards buybacks."
I can’t figure out the reason for downward trajectory of CTRA stock price. Stock is push downwards from $23.50 to $21.25 in a week time and is performing bad even as earning date Nov 3 is approaching
