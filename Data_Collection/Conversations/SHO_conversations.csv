"Sunstone has 20 properties, and most of them are in shutdown states, 3 in Cali, 2 in Florida, 2 in NY, 1 in New Orleans, 1 in Washington DC...we are going to be shutdown for more then 2 weeks, try 2 months, then it will takes MONTHS to ramp back up afterwards. I have no idea who is buying this stock but it's not worth more then $5, they are going to take massive losses the next several quarters due to people just simply not wanting to travel even after the restrictions are lifted."
