Dropping again. Been buying in the low 20's 19s selling when it goes over 21.50. Rinse and repeat. The pattern sets up great..GLTA
It's buy time. Let's see if the pattern remains the same. Although the market is scaring me a little. GLTA this week.
$120 Gucci Hot Wheels sold out in a minute... 
Hopefully see $24-$25 by december
Mattel is up 7.96% to 21.95
Looking promising before the report...
I'm buying again down here. Xmas is coming. Stock has been good to me. Market is down again dragging everything down with it. GLTA but this stock will be going up again.
Why MAT is weak today?
It's going be a blood bath all over the markets today. This is going to hurt.
Back to 20.00 next week.
"The market should appreciate great companies like mattel. It's beating up on earnings and revenues for more than a year and it's barely moving while other companies bleeding money are going up 100%, it's ridiculous"
They had some interesting insights about MAT on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"No dividend, no investment from me. The company is too old, established, and hated to invest without a dividend."
IMPRESSIVE !!!!
People are not aware that mattel brands are selling worldwide. Brands like hot wheels or barbie are famous other places. Revenue should be great this year
"Got more in at 20.42, was that a good idea?"
"Just from current report Mattel is undervalued by 10 percent. Based on the projection for holiday season quarter , I think price should be 25-30 percent higher from it is now by January 2022"
"Bought @18.02 looks like I'm out 20.02 quick 1000 bucks on 500 shares. Long term be in since the 8.00 buck days. Selling all @ 20 if she drops. Made great money from MAT. I'll be watching, if this dips down to the low 18's I'll buy again. Easiest stock to read I have ever seen. GLTA Who knows maybe it will hold 20.00 and the stop loss won't kick in."
"Going up after hours, it report out? Please share."
BREAKING NEWS!Fisher-Price will buy NIO and will team up with Mattel $MAT for their swapping technology for Fisher-Price latest car model E-TYKES.Very Bullish!!!
