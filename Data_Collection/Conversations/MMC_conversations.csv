Have you seen all the bullish comments from a variety of investment companies? They keep buying and expanding in strong regional areas. Great business plan that really seems to be out working their competitors!
Nice move up after hours. Any news?
"Just wondering, is there a single former J&H employee left at MMC? Just curious since so many left with the get out of jail card offered."
"I want to know when two things will happen. Earnings growth steady and beating estimates, so when is greedy management going to share the wealth with a dividend increase?Second, MMC has had a philosophy of splits to keep the per share price between about $40 & $60/sh then let’s it run to $120 to $140. Go back and look at history after J&H acquisition/merger. So when will the split the stock. Does not increase “value” but splits always cause per share prices to rise."
"According to earnings announcements, the Marsh’s and the Aon’s of the world made money and acquired a reasonable amount of new business in a very difficult business environment through 2020. As the economy starts to rebound 2021, revenues only stand to get better as far as I’m concerned."

What is fundamentally wrong with MMC that would make it undeserving of 120?
"I am a Long MMC holder. It’s the market that is driving the price down. If interest rates continue to rise, stocks will go down. Bonds are less risky. If the Fed hikes rates multiple times this year the market will crash. But great buying opportunity for more MMC."
Dan stays on the board at MMC. Good thing!!!

"If WB of BRK.A purchases more MMC, where do the public filing show up first? Is this considered insider trading or fair game?"
