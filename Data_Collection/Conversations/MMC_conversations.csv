"We want more doom and gloom and negative news from the MMC Companies. The world is ending, lock down, death and destruction its the MMC marketing tactic."
why so much doom and gloom on every MMC press release? That's so played out. Better start some positive forward thinking reasons to use the company. competitors are a month a head of MMC and clients and investors are moving towards the smile vs. the house of horrors

"1. Glaser guarantees no one loses a job due to COVID-19.2. Aon realizes effect of COVID-19 on the industry, cuts salaries across the board by 20%.3. Next move, MMC. By being self-forced to hold jobs steady, the only way to achieve an austere expense budget is to follow suit. Expect an announcement by.... May 15?Good theater!"
"I am a Long MMC holder. It’s the market that is driving the price down. If interest rates continue to rise, stocks will go down. Bonds are less risky. If the Fed hikes rates multiple times this year the market will crash. But great buying opportunity for more MMC."
See ya Bernard. Just hit $140!

"I want to know when two things will happen. Earnings growth steady and beating estimates, so when is greedy management going to share the wealth with a dividend increase?Second, MMC has had a philosophy of splits to keep the per share price between about $40 & $60/sh then let’s it run to $120 to $140. Go back and look at history after J&H acquisition/merger. So when will the split the stock. Does not increase “value” but splits always cause per share prices to rise."
"Last major press releases from MMC. Transgender Rights, Global Warming, Employee Discrimination. Nothing about the insurance industry. If you are a Wall Street analyst or institutional portfolio manager.... What side of this bet do you think smart money is moving? Go short on MMC"

glad to buy MMC @82 and will sell @140
