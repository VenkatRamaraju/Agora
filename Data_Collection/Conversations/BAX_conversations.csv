"Well, tomorrow is the big day...fingers crossed."
Accounting issue may resolve in Baxter's favor....
2021 will be a great year for this company and due for a breakout given the strong fundamentals and an aging population.
Pretty sad!!!!!!
Just curious if anyone panicked and baled on BAX the last few weeks?
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on What*sapp>>>>>>> +447901191306 or Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"
What was the cause for the drop yesterday....I can't find anything. Report was pretty good.
"One year ago HRC was trading for $83 per share. So you wait to pay 87% more ?Healthcare is not cyclical, nor seasonal. There is no excuse for this poorly timed, all cash, acquisition expense. Bed pans, and emergency room time-of-death clocks aren't worth this premium."
Tomorrow BAX will be easily 85-90 $ / share. Mostly owned by institutions + SEC forbidden short selling. It will have very good results (see presentation of 2 march on their site - revenue is up by 5% plus SnP will gain back 3%.
I believe next week BAX will surprise for the following Macroeconomic reasons:1. Renal business pickup due to increase in hospitalization activities in urgent care category2. Their consumable use in healthcare has gone up due to higher usage/disposal rate in healthcare3. Non-covid healthcare activity increase over the last 6 month
So if this a bad deal for BAX why is the stock going up?
They are going to give one third of their market cap to purchase this company ? Does not make sense to me . Way over paid.
REUTERS: Baxter International Inc. reported adjusted earnings of $501 million or $0.97 (vs $0.89 forecast) per share for the period. - Revenue: $3.04 billion in Q4 vs. $2.83 billion in the same period last year. -Guidance: Next quarter EPS guidance: $0.72 to $0.74BAX is a safe heaven during this turmoil period. And the potential is relly good.
"Holding on to BAX even though they have some accounting issues. Ultimately recoverable, I believe."
"Imo, BAX overpaid by a few hundred million but the market apparently loves the deal; the ""market"" in this case being the large institutional investors who own virtually all of the stock in both companies."
"As an insider, Joe needs to step down immediately! He has created a very toxic environment. Employees are extremely unhappy and not motivated. Anytime someone has an opportunity to leave, they are flying out the door. Baxter is not retaining good talent, and this is reflecting on the business and will continue to have long lasting effects."
They paid one billion plus over sticker price ! That company market cap is not even a 10 billion market cap . Fuzzy math . And I normally like BAX . But no way is this a good deal .
relax guys. everything is long term.
Market loves this deal. wow
"Must not be a good enough deal , no analysts are upgrading or down grading as of yet … my opinion is it would be a sad investment for BAX"
"Maybe if they started making batteries and losing money, the stock would skyrocket?"
"Glad to see today's spike but I just sold. Bought 800 @ $73.98 on August 11th and I'll take a quick $5,488 gain and look for other fish to fry. Grew up in northern Illinois and BAX and ABT have always been thought of as great places to spend a career - first class employers. The only issue is getting into their stocks when they're not fully valued. That opportunity hit last month when BAX got hammered and I'm glad I got in but I don't see the upside after this morning's move and my guess is that increase will head a bit south by the end of the day."
Do you guys follow http://the-alphatrader.com/? It seems way better than all the spam on the BAX board - The alerts have been great!
"5-star analyst Danielle Antalffy, of SVB Leerink, writes of Baxter, “[We] see BAX's underlying fundamentals -- accelerating sales growth, meaningful margin expansion -- as unchanged. One of the most meaningful datapoints in this quarter was 6% peritoneal dialysis patient growth… well ahead of the mid-single-digit long-term growth outlook for the Renal business that the Street is modeling. As the COVID pressures begin to lift, visibility into the long-term growth drivers should improve, and we would expect the shares to move meaningfully higher.”And it doesn't hurt that Ray Dalio co-chief investment officer of the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates just bought up 124,701 shares of the stock, a holding that is worth $9.73 million at current prices."
"I wonder what the investors who were unloading BAX today know that I don't? True, it's not terribly unusual to see a stock go down despite a solid earnings report; but it is VERY unusual to see that stock drop nearly 10% to a new 52-week low on huge volume."
"Who is responsible for this ! This is not a good deal for BAX . Money is cheap but one third of our market cap for a company that’s not even worth 10 billion .. it will take years and years to make back that money , if we can or do . Bad investment for BAX"
Well at least they will have higher growth but most likely will over pay.....
Why is Bax stock price keeps going down in spite of good fundamentals and very good potential post-covid with its products and services?
I would be interested in finding out what the analysts have to say about this deal .
BAX is steady and moving up. And HRC is barely treading water/dipping. Perhaps the street believes the deal won't go thru now....So hard to read this one...
"Baxter has increased plasma fractionation capacity annually, to support growth in demand for the plasma-derived treatments. This maybe for the Coronavirus antibody infusions"
IF the market did not love this deal for BAX the price of the stock would be down.
"YOU CANNOT MAKE MONEY ON GOVERNANCE……. Baxter International's acquisition of Hill-Rom Holdings could bring both opportunities and challenges for Baxter's ESG score. Baxter is among the top 20 highest scoring companies in the global medical equipment and supplies industry with an overall ESG score of 60.4, well above the industry average of 47.6. Hill-Rom on the other hand has a much lower overall score of 49.9, and a particularly weaker performance in certain social metrics, including access and affordability, and selling practices and product labeling. Baxter scores higher than Hill-Rom in business model innovation, which includes product design and lifecycle management, and supply-chain management. In contrast, Hill-Rom's leadership and governance profile is stronger than Baxter's, something that Baxter could gain from."
"It is hard to say if Bax overpaid or not. But two facts to consider. First, Bax has very low debt currently. Second, the interest rate is low right now. Not much risk to incur more debt at a low interest rate."
"Great balance sheet with strong fundamentals, poised to rally to at least $120+ before end of 2020."
Waiting for two things to happen!1. Raise dividend...didn't happen2. CEO resign....soon hopefully!
Maybe the CEO of hrc will take over the combined CEO position....
Looks like the ambulance chasers have arrived.
"Will be 85 within the week, cnbc said great company and best management in the business."
Sure glad they didn't have a bad report!
