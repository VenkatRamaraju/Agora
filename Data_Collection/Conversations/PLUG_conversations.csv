"JPMorgan points to massive growth in fuel cell vehicles in ChinaAugust 27, 2021 0 By BRET WILLIAMSThe investment banking company sees H2 as playing a huge role in the commercial trucking market.JPMorgan’s Elaine Wu has predicted that hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) will become a central figure in the Chinese commercial truck market.This aligns with the predictions made by a number of other analysts and energy market experts.“Currently, the fuel cell vehicles account for less than 5% of the commercial truck market in China and that could grow to about one-third of total market share in 2050,” said the firm’s head of Asia ex-Japan ESG and utilities research in a “Squawk Box Asia” report from CNBC. According to Wu, the rapid refueling time of only about 10 to 15 minutes for trucks makes this greenhouse gas emission-free option an appealing one in China’s commercial market.Moreover, the range is substantially higher, at around 800 kilometers per refueling (about 500 miles), which is about 50 percent to 100 percent better than the current lithium battery electric vehicle range. Several automakers are already well into their FCV research, including Toyota, BMW and Honda.Fuel cell vehicles - commerical H2 truckChina his already promoting the use of fuel cell vehicles as it aims to reduce its carbon emissions.“The [Chinese] government is promoting something, what we call ‘city clusters’ so that there could be demonstrative cities telling successful stories of how fuel cell vehicles are implemented in various parts of the country,” explained Wu. “This is also a policy that we saw implemented about a decade ago, when the central government was trying to produce lithium battery electric vehicles. And we saw how successful that was.”According to announcements from Beijing, the country has set a 2025 goal by which one in five new cars sold will be new energy powered.That said, while FCVs appear to be an obvious option for commercial trucks and long-haul vehicles, competition with battery electric vehicles is fierce when it comes to personal cards. Tesla has made it into the country and is providing stiff competition for local electric automakers like Xpeng and Nio.Still, with the pollution from long-haul vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in the trucking industry will play an important role in China’s capacity to achieve its 2060 target for carbon neutrality."
"the more we find out that we need hydrogen to reduce emissions, the more its shares fall, moreover the indices are at their maximum, but we are about -60% since January ."

"Below is a segment from a Bank of America analysis:Public demand for decarbonization and sustainable energy is growing, as the damage caused by fossil fuels becomes harder to ignore. In 2020 alone, there were 22 incidents that caused over $1 billion in damage, compared with an average of six per year between 2002 and 2010. By 2030, flooding will affect over 145 million Americans every year; wildfires are becoming more harmful, with twice as much land burned between 2000-2018 than in the previous 15 years; and natural disasters like heat waves, avalanches, and droughts are all becoming more frequent."

Really! The mostly stool article claims it is expansion of the hydrogen economy in China that I has spooked investors. Really? I see it as awesome support and scale for a nascent industry. Great for Plug and all Hydrogen stocks.

PLUG drops 6 to 8% on nothing news yet today the NY institutions guarded the nasdaq from total sell off. After the act of criminal terrorism in Afghanistan. Shorts only want to short when they can orchestrate it together from the big owners collusion. . Today exampled they weren't ready to short and it stayed steady only down around 50 points after the incident. No shorting was allowed until the NY tribe can work together in collusion. If any reason to drop was today not merely shorting for profit on daily regularity using co owned algo terminals. Prayer for the victims today and the administration failed to plan an orderly escape. USA losing credibility and the reconciliation bill is now never going to get bipartisan support for H2 or EV recharging stations. Pitiful market manipulation today. Shameful that the market ignored the plight of our people and allies..

"Sandy Munro said in an interview ,not long ago ,that Ford and GM will survive, but as much smaller companies. I have read opinions that they are so far behind Tesla they will never catch up. Since GM is a Plug customer, they can work with Plug on fuel cells and start making delivery vans and mini buses. Then eventually for heavy duty 3/4 ton and 1 ton work trucks . Having to outsource batteries from foreign companies with inferior quality, I believe fleets will look to buy American as long as they know the fuel will be readily available,Green, price competitive and fuel cells practically maintenance free. As electric cars (Tesla and some day Chinese) become more and more dominant GM and Ford will lose their profitable ICE business and not be able to sell enough electric cars to reach profitability. They will have to seek niches to help them survive.If Tony Seba is right about ride sharing and robo taxis ,the number of cars owned by individuals will drop dramatically over the next ten years. Word to GM Go Plug."

Subscribe for free.Driving the news: The vessel, dubbed Sea Change, was launched last week by All American Marine, a shipyard based in Bellingham, Washington, and SWITCH Maritime, an investment company focused on zero-emissions maritime vessels.How it works: The Sea Change runs on electricity generated by a 360-kilowatt fuel cell system.Compressed hydrogen gas stored in 10 onboard tanks flows to the fuel cells, where it mixes with air, creating electricity that powers a pair of 402-horsepower electric motors. The only byproduct is water.When the boat is idling or traveling at low speeds, excess electricity is stored in a 100-kilowatt battery until needed.The estimated range is 300 nautical miles."
It's not clear why a last years $3 junk stock that had never made a profit for 22 years can survive the overwhelming competition and huge oversupply in a zero profit environment. Little pluggie gets crushed like a fly.
The infrastructure bill about to be passed on 9/27 by the House (it already passed the Senate) provides for acredit for the production of low carbon hydrogen. The credit is $3.00 per kg from 2022-2024 and $2.00 per kg from 2025-2027. The credit is in the form of a tax credit or a cash payment. There are about 900 kg in a ton.
"For those who are following the progress of the reconciliation and infrastructure bills, one point of concern pertains to how Manchin and Sinema will use their leverage to downsize the cost of the reconciliation package. However, since Manchin is a plenary speaker at the H2 Shot Summit next week, I can't imagine that he would endanger all of the work done to date in support of H2. See plenary speakers here: https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-shot-summit-plenary#speakers"
"50% green by 2024, 5X green H2 plants by 2024, 100 tons per days, 500 tons per day by 2025, 1000 tons per day by 2028. that is huge growth."
This company and it's largest institutional shareholders should be investigated for collusion immediately. These prices games are a moral outrage and completely unethical. This is a total sham and even the most optimistic longs on this board should be calling it out
"I trust my analysis.Last year I predicted that my top performers would be #PLUG and #INMD. Currently I'm up 250% with InMode and around break even with Plug, only reason being that I tripled my position. I have set a target of $250 a share for both within 5 years."
I did it. 1000 shares of plug power in the pocket!
Amazing how quickly they can take this down scare people off and buy their shares. Just when you think it is safe to get back in the water the sharks are unleashed.
That's strange a 4 million share trade during the day a minute ago!
Plug has outperformed Nasdaq by 8.5 % to 2.5% this week. The fact that there has been no news to cause this rise is a positive sign. News of new clients which have been hinted at and news of the successful rollout of the Renault fuel cell vans in the next few months will propel this further into the green.

"Forrest says green hydrogen market could be worth $16 trillion by 2050Giles Parkinson 18 August 2021 61ShareTweet0ShareIron ore billionaire Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest has delivered some extraordinary predictions for the renewable hydrogen industry, saying it could grow to $16 trillion by 2050, “way more than any industry that exists today”.In a speech to the Clean Energy Council’s “Infinite Australia” webinar, Forrest – one of Australia’s richest men – also declared his goal of producing 15 million tonnes of renewable energy hydrogen by 2030 through his Fortescue Future Industries, and ridiculed the push for gas and sequestered hydrogen.The Australian fossil fuel industry, with the support of the federal government, is spending significant sums trying to produce hydrogen from coal and gas, coupled with the promise of carbon capture and storage, even though new studies say this combination will increase rather than cut emissions. “The oil and gas sector is preying on public hope, and the political opportunism this allows – by allowing the colours of the rainbow and calling it clean hydrogen, which of course, being made from fossil fuels, it is anything but,” Forrest said.“Blue, grey, pink, yellow hydrogen is not renewable green hydrogen. And don’t get me started on the smokescreen of sequestration.“The most recent argument that hydrogen made from fossil fuel whose carbon emissions have attempted to be sequestered – buried in the ground – is “the new green”, is false. Regardless of the success of sequestration – it normally fails, there are huge carbon emissions emitted in its process. “If it is not renewable green, don’t be fooled by any other colour coded spin. Any other colour than renewable green is dirty hydrogen.”Forrest says the green hydrogen market could create revenues of $US12 trillion ($A16 trillion) by 2050, an industry on the scale unlike any ever seen, as it meets clean energy needs in transport, energy and industry."

@ Carmen...Why did you delete your post concerning JMI? Do us a favor and stay on your IDEX board.
"Plug Power is a source of profit/loss for investors. There are 3 main diffrences between shareholders: 1. average price (it is normal to be optimistic if you have 15 or 10 or 2.5 average price. If the average price is 55, there is a bit of frustration. I have 30, I believe in Plug Power's SUCCESS and probably I will invest more in order to reduce average price). 2 Time. If the investment in Plug Is long term, it doesn't matter what happens today. Patience makes the difference. Plug could be like Tesla. On the contrary short term could be a big disappointment. Medium term could bring some small to medium profits 3. Target: if the target is 400 maybe is not realistic. I have a target price of 73, it could be as well too much. For me it will be worth the one year (MY TIME) wait. It is possible to add one more year because I trust Andy Marsh."
"Did Scott Levine finish serving his section before he blogged about China news taking down Plug Power? ""Can I get you folks anything else? Would you like to see a desert menu?"" ""Ok, I'll bring you your check"""
Plug will not be acquired. They just increased authorized shares to 1.5 Billion. They clearly don't want to be a buyout candidate.
"To all pumpers and cheerleaders on this board: ask Andy, send email to PR and ask about data center pedestal that Andy promised to reveal in June. More than two months have passed and no word had been put out in the press. Nada! Many investors on this board would like to hear any update and why the things are so quiet."

"Fuel Cells are the answer!“ The existing network is acceptable for many purposes. But chargers are very unevenly distributed; almost a third of all outlets are in California. This makes EVs problematic for long trips, like the 550 miles of sparsely populated desert highway between Reno and Salt Lake City. “Range anxiety” about longer trips is one reason electric vehicles still make up fewer than 1% of U.S. passenger cars and trucks.This uneven, limited charging infrastructure is one major roadblock to rapid electrification of the U.S. vehicle fleet, considered crucial to reducing the greenhouse-gas emissions driving climate change.”"
Can we pop above the 50 dma ($28.08)this week? I'm looking to test $30 by the end of the week and then we might test $35 next week. What will the catalyst be to get us there

"Plug Power views The infrastructure investment and jobs act as a major step forward in the development of hydrogen energy in the US Based on feedback from many of our customers seeking help achieving their sustainability goals, we believe that green hydrogen is the true future is from hydrogen energy. Only green hydrogen – where renewable energy generates hydrogen from water and releases harmless oxygen – will enable the US to decarbonise energy, transportation and industrial applications.We recognize that blue hydrogen—defined as using natural gas to generate hydrogen from methane and capture its carbon emissions—is not the long-term solution to decarbonizing the US economy. Carbon capture requires long-term geological storage and does not eliminate upstream emissions. Several attempts by the fossil fuel industry to implement carbon capture have failed, so we have little confidence that they will succeed. And blue hydrogen eventually becomes too expensive and emits too much carbon.Plug is fully committed to a green hydrogen future. We are investing heavily in building a green hydrogen ecosystem and are on track to expand 500 tons of green hydrogen production by 2025, which will replace 4.3 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. This includes the groundbreaking of a green hydrogen production facility in Camden County, Ga., which will produce 15 tons of liquid green hydrogen per day, and North America's largest planned green hydrogen production facility in Alabama, New York, which will produce 45 metric tons of green liquid hydrogen per day using clean New York hydropower.The future is green hydrogen - no one will buy blue if green is available. We believe that our production of green hydrogen will outperform blue hydrogen in terms of cost, availability and environmental characteristics"
"@JP…..Please don’t be offended by what I am about to say.I believe in 2019 the world used 70 million tons of H2 and the U.S. used 10 million tons. (World use is predicted to quadruple in the next decade). The vast majority of that was grey, which has a worse carbon footprint than fossil fuels. The vast majority of what PLUG uses now is grey.I point this out because in 2028 PLUG’s plan is to produce only 365,000 tons of green, which is a tiny proportion of total U.S. consumption. There is indeed a paradigm shift moving toward widespread adaptation of hydrogen. Much of the emphasis is on green, but Big Oil has weaseled their way into the Infrastructure Bill and the Reconciliation Bill, and they are going to be controlling the majority of H2 production, grey and blue, for years to come. It isn’t until their methods have been denounced as carbon polluters and green and pink are universally adapted that there will be a net planetary improvement. How long will it take the world to produce 250 million tons of green and pink annually?As I stated before, PLUG’s green hydrogen will be no more than a small niche within a much larger reservoir. But green hydrogen will indeed become the epitome and PLUG will be the torch bearer. If PLUG plans to provide 50% green to their customers in 2025, then by 2028 when they are producing 1,000 tpd they should be approaching 80% or so.I read in an article that green H2 may become like currency itself. Though I believe it will be many, many years before H2 provides a net planetary benefit, I strongly believe that the niche PLUG has carved out for itself, combined with the business plan and first to market strategies, will make PLUG a highly successful business. PLUG will be well into production by the time blue is disproved and PLUG will be printing money with green H2 and other business relationship it has nurtured.H2 has a long time before it becomes a silver bullet. PLUG, not so long."

Plug Power has a large warehouse off ex 10 Northway in Saratoga county New York I have been by there last year when they first opened but when I went by there today I was overwhelmed by what I saw. This warehouse itself is busting at the seems looks full to capacity So much so they have an incredible amount of large material being stored outside. My best assumption is that this material is for hydrogen refueling stations to be assembled as the parts looked similar to the assembled refueling stations a had seen in Latham in the past. Plug Power is very busy there I could only see inside the warehouse from the outside loading dock open door but I can tell you the warehouse was full and very busy with 3 trailers being loaded at the dock

The potential of the hydrogen business is so huge and evident that doesn't appear in the headlines of economic press. The big players are setting strong positions in these stocks and prefer the silence at this stage . The time of great valuations is coming.

This is the biggest issue, most of people accept significant loss and take small profits. The minimum target price for me is 73. So if the stock goes to 5, I am okay because I took the risk for what I believe it will become A GREAT INVESTMENT, NOT A LAS VEGAS SLOT MACHINE.

This will be the only major investment that will bring together the world consensus- governments, investors, and all world population. Never at any time in history has been such great concern about climate change. Objectively, there is no better alternative to hydrogen. First, because it makes possible to solve the problem of emissions in different areas- residential, Industrial, transport : sea, air and etc. Second, because even in sectors where the Ev’s dominate, now is becoming consensual that Fuel Cells bring advantages in several levels. The time to invest is now. It’s now that infrastructures are going to be created, it’s now that governments are going to invest. Now we start a better future…."

I am confident that after the next earnings report in November we will have enough new announcements to get the stock price back into the 40's...

Currently, most of Plug’s revenue comes from materials handling; however, we now have the four business units. Where can we expect the revenue to come from in the future?

"Letters to the Editor: Hydrogen car naysayers sound like battery EV critics 20 years agoFor those who want to find problems and complexities, the hydrogen economy is filled with them. For those looking for a way to provide fast refueling, scalable electric propulsion and a potential to step away from fossil fuels, this is an incredible and very plausible pathway that we are perfecting in California like the pioneers we are destined to be.Adam Bray-Ali, Alhambra..To the editor: When I leased a Toyota Mirai in 2018, I was advised to keep the fuel tank half-full at all times. That way, I would always have enough range (100-200 miles) to get to a station that's operational.I've driven to Palm Desert, Lake Arrowhead, San Francisco, San Diego and all over L.A. without a fueling incident. And hydrogen will be ""green"" when companies start using solar energy for water electrolysis.If only a tiny percentage of all cars sold in the United States are electric, let's address that first. Hydrogen fuel produced with solar energy is a solid alternative for a clean-energy future.Cort Casady, Palos Verdes Peninsula..To the editor: Why go to all the trouble trying to distribute hydrogen fuel for automobiles?With the apparent overabundance of solar electricity generated during the day, that power should be used to manufacture hydrogen at the point of collection. The hydrogen could then be used to generate electricity at night when there is no sunshine, and could be charging electric vehicles while they are parked in the garage."

"Just watched a live news conference from the Ascension Parish, LA Sheriff’s Office. The #1 issue for them after lack of electrical power is lack of fuel. This is critical for first responder vehicles and all the electrical line repair trucks. If the refineries are w/o power, they cannot produce and pump gas to the distribution tankers, and they can’t get gas to the stations. One thing they don’t seem to be having a problem with is cell phone service, which they said was a bright spot in life returning to normal. Thanks to cell tower stationary backup power provided by companies like PLUG, more people are at least able to communicate and coordinate restoration efforts."

"It looks like the U.S. Gulf Coast will be hit by a potentially major hurricane Sunday or Monday. Once again, PLUG will provide superior backup power for critical communications in so many areas. Here’s a key excerpt from the December, 2020 article on the Plug Power website:“As linemen, tower crews, cell techs, tree crews and so many first responders worked post-hurricane, Plug Power’s GenSure fuel cells continued to provide backup power to ensure communications were viable to get the job done – and check in with loved ones. 142 fuel cells operated, providing backup power for a total of 5,212 hours. The longest runtime was nearly 211 hours, with the average being 36.75 hours. For the 2020 hurricane season, Plug Power fuel cells provided nearly 6,800 hours of emergency power to a region hit hard.”"

"Today is my last day of regular work. Thank you Andy Marsh and Plug managers. Retirement is solid because of my investment from 2017 to now. Took some off the table in January. Look forward to the portfolio increasing dramatically the next three years. If it doesn’t, I still can play golf, go to football, hockey and baseball games. Now if we can get past the pandemic some overseas travel would be great. Look forward to fun discussions on this board as this company completes the vision of a hydrogen economy. I assume there are others like me retired on this board. We should start the Plug breakfast club."
"The way I see it, with the electrolyzers the giga factory and so many new alliances and projects; that plug is at a starting point that it was a year ago when the price was a few bucks. Our current price seems like a few bucks and that we could accelerate like we did last December. Only, we are in a much better position than we were a year ago financially with contractual agreements and products for sale. I don’t believe that we will increase our share price by 10 fold in the next 12 months, however, I think it’s entirely possible for PLUG to increase share price 3X to 4X in the next 12 months. That would be somewheres between 75 and $100 per share. Current price is the new ground floor for PLUG. I’m looking for a new wave of investors coming on board. Following that a new wave of traders that will keep or attempt to keep the price stable between 75 and 100 for as long as they can until the next wave of investors arrive at the end of 2022."

Should YOU buy PLUG power stock? We don’t think it’s a good idea if YOU buy it right now. Now WE are going to load up on it but you....you need to wait. They have never been profitable you know.
"Question for all the hydrogen wizards here. I’m driving down a backroad in a fuel cell car. I run out of fuel. What do I do? Do I have someone bring to me a container of hydrogen AT 10,000 PSI? And if they could, how do I transfer it to the vehicle. Answer wizards!"
"CFRA (Plug Outlook) 8/21/21-Recommendation HOLD12 mo. target price $30.PLUG increased its 2021 gross billings guidance from $475 million to $500 million, driven by the continued adoption of GenDrive units in material handling markets (shipments were up 37% Y/Y in Q2), supported by a growing customer base. We expect this momentum to continue into 2022 coupled with sales growth in other markets (electric vehicles, stationary power, and electrolyzers). PLUG’s 2022 billings guidance of $750 million includes $150 million from its electrolyzer business.Given PLUG’s robust cash balance, we expect to see M&A, joint ventures, and accelerated green hydrogen production. We rate PLUG shares at Hold. PLUG’s growth strategy is not a walk in the park, in our view, risk is consisting of building out a 500 ton per day green hydrogen network by 2025 and penetrating competitive electric vehicle markets. While we think PLUG has a favorable position in the material handling industry, we note that more than half of PLUG’s 2024 billings goal of $1.7 billion is exposed to new markets, and hence, execution risk.Upside risks include accelerating trends in hydrogen fuel cell adoption and clean energy headline momentum."
I do agree with Some here that state that some timelines were stated for news to be released about such things as pillar customers and back up power for Such and such company and other big things that have as yet not happened. I hope we have not gone back to the overpromise and under deliver days.
Andy is on deck…
