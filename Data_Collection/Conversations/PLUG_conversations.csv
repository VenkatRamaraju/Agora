"PLUG is my AMZN.Why is that you may ask. Well, I learned a lesson when I did not comprehend why Amazon was recommended more than a decade ago by different publications without really digging into the BIG story behind it all, just seemed like wishful thinking to me, but it turned out that I just could not see the big picture. I was baffled by the numbers that seemed to make zero sense at the time. They were burning money by the ship loads and I just could not understand the real economy of scale they would end up with(the BIG picture). WS sure understood, maybe they did not do the best possible job explaining it, but they got it right.Now why PLUG is my AMZN - well it is the same situation, money is burning and ships are ready to bring more as they burn out, and that is because this is a revolution of the greatest market there is - Energy. To see this thing ten years from now is like looking at Amazon in 2010. Some folks will be kicking themself, just like I did with AMZN in the past - and Netflix I might add :)All the signs are there. Governments across the globe are talking about green energy and hydrogen revolution. It is just that simple, hydrogen has ZERO emissions, it can be stored for a rainy day, you can fill up your tank in few minutes just as you do now with diesel or petrol and it can be used as backup power for facilities when wind is not blowing and sun is not shining. It can also replace col in the foundries and much much more. It's the future and PLUG is the leader of the pack with ample financing and big money backing. It's just that simple, so get on board now when it is just getting started. I will ride this 2nd coming of AMZN for a long long time - cheers!"
"It's only a matter of time before large cruise corporations like Norwegian, Royal Caribbean, Carnival etc partner up with PLUG power.Besides the OBVIOUS benefit to the planet, the optics for the cruise industry of beautiful travel destinations and oceanside views make this plan a no-brainer in my opinion.Mark this post!!"

@Dr J. You talk like Plug depends on the infrastructure bill. Marsh has said the bill is not factored into Plugs current plans. And the US is just one country in the world. Plug is a global company.
Lots of stars aligning for PLUG:-Global H2 uptake across major industries.- tax break on Clean H2 - Government grants- Major partners- COP 26 climate crisis conferenceI dont know how this stays below $50 next week.
"Australia tops list of nations poised to tap hydrogen boom.Australia is emerging as a front-runner among nations vying to become hydrogen-exporting powerhouses amid fresh projections showing demand for the fuel could increase six-fold by 2050.As governments around the world seek to scale up their emerging hydrogen industries, global resources consultancy Wood Mackenzie has identified Australia as one of the best-placed countries to tap the potential boom in the global market, backing up the federal government’s focus on the fuel as part of its push to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions.“Australia, in particular, stands out from the crowd in its track record of exporting a diverse set of natural resources and minerals, sheer physical scale, solar and wind resources and substantial potential for large-scale CCS,” Wood Mackenzie research director Prakash Sharma said.The federal Coalition this week announced a policy to reach net zero emissions by 2050, a target requiring the country to reduce or offset all greenhouse gases. Under the policy, 40 per cent of Australia’s emissions reduction will come from lower-emissions technologies, such as hydrogen, becoming cheap enough to compete with carbon-intensive industries.“Australia and the Middle East sit in the top echelons for solar irradiance and offer massive green hydrogen potential,” Wood Mackenzie said. “For supply to Northeast Asia, for instance, suppliers in Australia would appear to be ahead of the pack.”Federal Energy and Emissions Reduction Minister Angus Taylor said the industry’s potential “cannot be ignored” and argued Australia can attract $70 billion of investments over the next decade.More than 150 million tonnes of hydrogen would be traded on the seaborne market by 2050, Wood Mackenzie said.Hydrogen production that doesn’t generate greenhouse emissions has gained enormous international attention for its potential future applications as a zero-emissions energy source.Link in reply."
"Plug Power price target raised to $46 from $37 at Piper SandlerPiper Sandler analyst Pearce Hammond raised the firm's price target on Plug Power to $46 from $37 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst sees upside to the consensus 2022 revenue estimate of $810M and expects Plug will be closer to $950M. The Street is not factoring in the Fortescue electrolzyer deal which is incremental to the company's 2022 revenue guidance, Hammond tells investors in a research note. The analyst also sees additional catalysts for Plug and the renewables group in the passage of the reconciliation bill ""as well as COP26 driving investors to increase sector exposure."""
"From Linde Q3 earnings call. No mentioning of Plug Power but still relevant. P.J. Juvekar -- Citi -- AnalystAs you look at this technology road map and green hydrogen costs coming down, where do you see that? I know Steve had commented on some numbers maybe a year ago. And what about this production tax credit of $3 for green hydrogen? How would that play out?Sanjiv Lamba -- Chief Operating OfficerP.J., that production tax credit is actually very, it will be a very good supporting mechanism. We talked earlier on about in the previous question about how we see the incentives support the development, that $3 per kg will be a good support mechanism. We obviously have to read the rules and it hasn't yet come through. So I'm looking with some eagerness to that coming through and getting an understanding of how that, how those rules come into play. But that would be encouraging. Clearly, we believe that there is an opportunity here for us to move forward. Steve mentioned to you in the past that if we get hydrogen, blue or green, green, obviously more challenged in this reference, at about between $1 to $2 per kg, it's at that point that you see an inflection point and you see widespread adoption of technologies utilizing hydrogen and really hydrogen becoming a reasonable fuel in the portfolio fuels we'll have. We'll always have fossil fuel, at least for many decades ahead. But it will be a more important part of that portfolio of fuels and energy basket as it will. Steve, do you want to add something?Stephen F. Angel -- Chief Executive Officer and DirectorOkay, Sanjiv, I'll add something. So yes, just to build on that, I mean, if you were to look at the cost of hydrogen today and you were to use the U.S. Gulf Coast, which obviously, we produce a lot of hydrogen, we use a lot of hydrogen in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Gray hydrogen is about $1.30 a kilogram, and that's at $5.50 natural gas. Carbon capture would add another $0.40, $0.50, maybe you're in the $1.7 range sort. And if you think about green, it's like about $4.5 a kilogram. And out of that, probably $2.50, you call it, is the renewable power cost. And so if renewable power was free, then you would still have $2. And we all know renewable power isn't free. So we have some work to do to bring those costs down in terms of capital costs, operating costs. And as you were to work that down below that $2 number, then you've got a chance to have something competitive. So you need the combination of low cost renewable, low cost capital, lower cost, operate low cost capital and better efficiencies and then you can drive that number lower. And I would say ideally below $2, but certainly in that range would be is what's needed."
"Job posting from Amazon: Sr. Manager, WW Hydrogen Economy - to create and own Amazon’s global Fuel Cells and Industrial Vehicle’s Power Source strategies. - will take a lead role in developing long term strategies to deploy hydrogen fuel cell technology across multiple sectors within Amazon. I am trying to put this into context with Amazon's Rivian deal. As we all know Amazon is seriously committed to FC technology and partners with PLUG but perhaps they did not want to keep all eggs in one basket or they were not quite sure if hydrogen credits will ever happen. I wonder - now as hydrogen green credit is reality - how all of this will play out and if Amazon will order Hyvia vans or if they keep FC tech for mid-size and semi trucks? Or will Amazon ask Rivian to design a FC version preferably with PLUG?"
"Interesting article in Green Car Congress, regarding the use of electrolyzers in steel making in New Zealand:"" Rio Tinto and BlueScope to explore low-carbon steelmaking pathways """" Rio Tinto and steel producer BlueScope will work together to explore low-carbon steelmaking pathways using Pilbara iron ores, including the use of clean hydrogen to replace coking coal at BlueScope’s Port Kembla Steelworks.The two companies have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to research and design low-emissions processes for the steel value chain, including iron ore processing, iron and steelmaking and related technologies.Rio Tinto and BlueScope will prioritize studying the use of green hydrogen at the Port Kembla Steelworks in Australia to reduce Pilbara iron ores directly into a product that could then be processed in an electric melter to produce metallic iron suitable to be finished into steel.The MOU expands the partnership between the two companies, who were already jointly studying technology to reduce carbon emissions from existing iron and steelmaking processes. It will also allow more projects to be added as technologies mature.The first phase of the collaboration will be to determine the scale of a pilot plant to be based at the Port Kembla steelworks, consisting of a hydrogen electrolyzer, direct reduction process and melter.At an investor seminar last week, Rio Tinto said it was focused on studying three potential pathways towards net-neutral steelmaking; using sustainable biomass with Pilbara iron ore to replace coking coal in the iron and steelmaking process; using hydrogen-based hot-briquetted iron (HBI) with high-grade ores in Canada; and using hydrogen direct reduced iron (DRI) with a melter for Pilbara ores.This MOU aligns with the last potential pathway and shows Rio Tinto’s commitment to each of them.At the investor seminar, Rio Tinto announced new targets of reducing its Scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions by 50% by 2030, more than tripling its previous target, and a 15% reduction in emissions by 2025, five years earlier than previously. These targets are supported by around $7.5 billion of direct investments to lower emissions between 2022 and 2030. ""Just FYI.Link below.Thanks !:-)JMI"
"CBS NewsOn the road towards renewable energy, Japan is betting on hydrogen"
"If you believe in the long term plan which so far has been super conservative and the build out of the hydrogen highway in US, and Europe and all the other parts and pieces and finally the projected revenues and EBITDA projections then today and the last six months of consolidation will be so far in the rear view mirror and we become a full fledged utility and manufacturing company. Blowing away the neighsayers that temporarily make efforts to bring our long perspectives down. Don't let em even think they are impacting your knowledge that Plug Power has begun to change the paradigm and will dominate much of the green hydrogen landscape. The future is in its infancy. Green hydrogen will successfully change planet earth, environmentally, energy, socially and politically. And it doesn't matter your politics. The younger generation will be handed a great win with Plug and the other green hydrogen stocks. GLTA and remember stay focused and stick to your convictions as long as the story remains trmendous and the company is meeting its projections."
We stand in solidarity witnessing the resumption of upwards march of Plug green hydrogen and loads of green green days ahead. Kudos to Plug and cheers to usPLUG will onwards March galantly into the forties and thereafter ride into the fifties
"When you invest in PLUG power, you are accomplishing SO MANY positive things SIMULTANEOUSLY:A) The building out of the enormous, ubiquitous hydrogen infrastructure which simultaneously creates profits, jobs and HELPS RESTORE the planet to its prehistoric, primordial purity and beauty.B) Leveraging the most ABUNDANT element, hydrogen, in the UNIVERSE, whose possibilities for production, storage and use are advancing SO RAPIDLY with the increasing prominence of artificial intelligence and phenomenal computing powerC) The emergence of solar, wind and hydroelectric generated electricity which facilitates GREEN hydrogen production by electrolysis.D) Gives people real, substantive and lasting hope that we as ONE CONNECTED world can actually get it right when it comes to energy and a pure, clean planet.Consider these amazing facts concerning the emergence of the Hydrogen Economy. Please do NOT take MY word for any of this, but rather, research and verify on your OWN:Fact One: In ONE DAY (a 24-hour period), the sun delivers to the earth MORE ENERGY (in the form of sunlight) than is used by the ENTIRE POPULATION of the EARTH in ONE YEAR.Fact Two: Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, produces pure, clean energy, and is easily extracted from water by the process of electrolysis for later use in fuel cells.Fact Three: As the cost of electricity produced by solar, wind and hydroelectric gets cheaper and cheaper with new advances in technology, mainstream hydrogen use becomes more and more COMPELLING and can no longer be ignored.Fact One + Fact Two + Fact Three= PLUG --> $1000 per share!"
Earnings call today for phillips 66. Hopefully during the Q&A we'll get to know more about what their plans are regarding their partnership with plug.
Exxon made a lot of cash in the last quarter. They could have invested in clean energy. But nooooo they are going to do the only investing they know how to do — stock buybacks.

"This article gives you an idea of the carbon capture storage, this in North Dakota. This will be like nuclear waste storage, they will have to monitor and prevent leaks forever. Only with basalt will CO2 get integrated in the rock and there is no basalt in oil&gas producing states.CCS is a total joke.https://www.willistonherald.com/news/oil_and_energy/north-dakota-permits-first-of-likely-many-carbon-storage-projects-in-the-state-and-its/article_8df4acfa-31d4-11ec-a832-b7f2604ec2b6.html"
"One of the key advantages of hydrogen is that it is performs flawlessly and 100% reliably in extreme cold/ hot weather and produces a lot of power! So it is ideal for any heavy transportation modes such as trains, cargo ships / cruise liners (even smaller boats and yachts too, which pollute with their gasoline and diesel engines), trucks, and now even aircraft, which have been honing hydrogen propulsion systems to perfection. It is also an ideal choice for back-up generators for hospitals and any other facility where 100% reliability is critical.When thinking about PLUG as investment, consider these amazing facts about a hydrogen-based world (Please do NOT take MY word for any of this, but rather, research and verify on your OWN):Fact One: In ONE DAY (a 24-hour period), the sun delivers to the earth MORE ENERGY (in the form of sunlight) than is used by the ENTIRE POPULATION of the EARTH in ONE YEAR.Fact Two: Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, produces pure, clean energy, and is easily extracted from water by the process of electrolysis for later use in fuel cells.Fact Three: As the cost of electricity produced by solar, wind and hydroelectric gets cheaper and cheaper with new advances in technology, mainstream hydrogen use becomes more and more COMPELLING and can no longer be ignored.Fact One + Fact Two + Fact Three= PLUG --> $1000 per share!Bullish / Strong Buy on PLUG"
"Green H2 is generated by electrolyzing water using renewable electricity, emits zero greenhouse gases anywhere in its lifecycle, and at this time is just beginning to be scaled to become the motive and backup power source of the future. To be cost competitive with diesel and gasoline, green H2 production and distribution infrastructure must be massively built out, to facilitate which quickly government support would be extremely helpful.Enter blue H2, an aspirational offering by big oil, whose profits are already in the billions, that is proposed to capture the CO2 emitted producing today what is called grey H2, which is generated using natural gas in the almost universal industrial process for producing hydrogen called Steam Methane Reformation (SMR). Fugitive CH4 emissions, upstream at the fracked gas wellhead and in transporting and processing natural gas, are not reduced at all by capturing the CO2 emissions produced by SMR to change grey H2 into blue H2.Despite these facts, the House Reconciliation Bill will hand oil companies the exact same subsidy, for ten years, earned by producers of 100% emissions-free green H2. According to the Bill: ""The term `qualified clean hydrogen' means hydrogen which is produced through a process that, as compared to hydrogen produced by steam-methane reforming, achieves a percentage reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions which is not less than 40 percent.""In other words, multi-billion dollar oil companies will be paid -- with subsidies meant to scale rapidly zero-emission green H2 infrastructure -- to emit for the next 10 years 60% of the greenhouse gases produced by SMR. Oil companies will be paid to produce blue H2 cheaper than green H2 with precisely dollars whose intention is to make green H2 less expensive than H2 produced using SMR. A triumph of oil industry lobbyists and lawyers. A disaster for every living thing on planet Earth."
