"Remember, a lot of traders have loved PLUG for years now, since it is a high-Beta stock, lots of volatility.It explains why it moves in a range that is a pretty good swing each day, even on low volume days.For a long while earlier this year, several months, it was seeing $3.00 - $7.00 swings in price, per day. I certainly don't begrudge traders doing day or swing trading since, as I have posted many times, I've done it myself.Unfortunately, it also leads a lot of them to Troll constantly, thinking that their Bashing will lower the share price by a few cents.Those you can just Mute. You know who they are.......Thanks !:-)JMI"
"742,000 without power in Louisiana. “Ida also caused more than 95% of the Gulf of Mexico's oil production to shut down, regulators said Sunday, indicating the hurricane is having a significant impact on energy supply”Not only is oil consumption the root of pollution but it’s also unreliable to serve as a source of energy on a planet that will face more and more sever weather, mainly caused by Co2. A strike of irony perhaps. https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/29/weather/hurricane-ida-sunday/index.html"
"Revisiting 2020 shareholder letter where Acciona deal was explained. One of the targets caught my attention, 6GW of electrolyzers in EU by 2024. Andy said more recently that 1GW is between $500-600 million, so that portion of the business alone is worth $3.6 billion. Andy said $2 billion sales funnel for this business, sweet Susan he was being conservative!"

Am I the only one who heard Andy say that USA truck news is coming in September?

Dark pool transaction of over 4 million shares. Make this illegal as well.
"Follow up on my post a few weeks ago. I will be continuing my crusade to call out the bs occurring with this stock until something changes. The SEC will only investigate if we all work together and continue to direct their eyes this way. Otherwise, nothing will change with the SP manipulation. Please, if you are a long, complain to the SEC so that they direct resources this way. There is tremendous fraud happening daily here with the institutions and perhaps even management by their unwillingness to publish updates.--Thank you for contacting the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

good news fo hydrogen. https://www.hydrogenfuelnews.com/fuel-cell-vehicles-jpmorgan/8548139/
Really! The mostly stool article claims it is expansion of the hydrogen economy in China that I has spooked investors. Really? I see it as awesome support and scale for a nascent industry. Great for Plug and all Hydrogen stocks.
Amazing how quickly they can take this down scare people off and buy their shares. Just when you think it is safe to get back in the water the sharks are unleashed.

"One of the hottest stocks in the entire stock market last year, and we're supposed to believe it falls off the face of the earth on improved positioning, partnerships, capitalization, and institutional ownership? Call it whatever you want. I have my own description for it."
"Last August the stock price of Plug was around 13. So, it double in a year. And 18 months ago it was around 4, that's about a six fold increase. So, let's keep things in perspective... Those of us that bought 2-4 years ago are in really good shape. I am confident that after the next earnings report in November we will have enough new announcements to get the stock price back into the 40's... So patience is the name of the game, stay long and ignore the tick by tick fluctuations... It's a marathon not a 100 meter dash..."

Good articlehttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/are-hydrogen-stocks-set-for-a-rebound-2021-08-30
What was the most important news from Plug in August ? I’ll tell you the management restructure to 4 GM running the 4 segments of growth !! Plug needed that focus and I feel confident these 4 business envelopes will prosper in a Big Way!!
"Let me ask you what is PLUG worth when Amazon announce some of these 1 Giga Electrolyzer plants? We know they are selling electrolyzers to amazon.New projects across the U.S.: The 11 U.S.-based projects announced today include Amazon’s first solar projects in Arkansas, Mississippi, and Pennsylvania, and additional projects in Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, and Ohio. In total, Amazon has enabled more than 6 GW of renewable energy in the U.S. through 54 projects."
"Nice Youtube video by The Economist, the title is:"" Hydrogen: Fuel of the Future ?""It's 8 minutes long and presents a fair and balanced assessment of Hydrogen and pure EV, for transportation, plus a discussion of applications where H2 is superior, and how the two will co-exist for a while. About the 6:40 minute mark, there is a collage of company logos streaming by, and PLUG is among them. Just FYI. I will try to post the Link in a reply here.Thanks !:-)JMI"
"So let me get this straight, the fact that China is committed to going all in on green hydrogen is bad for Plug, even though Plug has never expressed a serious interest in entering the Chinese market. Makes perfect sense to me."
"Did Scott Levine finish serving his section before he blogged about China news taking down Plug Power? ""Can I get you folks anything else? Would you like to see a desert menu?"" ""Ok, I'll bring you your check"""

"Well, we have a deal with and 10 truck trials, and a 5th pedestal and you know Yada, Yada, Yada. So, when do we get past the Yada Yada's and real contracts with profits Andy?"

USA truck news coming in September ……. Get ready for lift off
"CFRA (Plug Outlook) 8/21/21-Recommendation HOLD12 mo. target price $30.PLUG increased its 2021 gross billings guidance from $475 million to $500 million, driven by the continued adoption of GenDrive units in material handling markets (shipments were up 37% Y/Y in Q2), supported by a growing customer base. We expect this momentum to continue into 2022 coupled with sales growth in other markets (electric vehicles, stationary power, and electrolyzers). PLUG’s 2022 billings guidance of $750 million includes $150 million from its electrolyzer business.Given PLUG’s robust cash balance, we expect to see M&A, joint ventures, and accelerated green hydrogen production. We rate PLUG shares at Hold. PLUG’s growth strategy is not a walk in the park, in our view, risk is consisting of building out a 500 ton per day green hydrogen network by 2025 and penetrating competitive electric vehicle markets. While we think PLUG has a favorable position in the material handling industry, we note that more than half of PLUG’s 2024 billings goal of $1.7 billion is exposed to new markets, and hence, execution risk.Upside risks include accelerating trends in hydrogen fuel cell adoption and clean energy headline momentum."
"The way I see it, with the electrolyzers the giga factory and so many new alliances and projects; that plug is at a starting point that it was a year ago when the price was a few bucks. Our current price seems like a few bucks and that we could accelerate like we did last December. Only, we are in a much better position than we were a year ago financially with contractual agreements and products for sale. I don’t believe that we will increase our share price by 10 fold in the next 12 months, however, I think it’s entirely possible for PLUG to increase share price 3X to 4X in the next 12 months. That would be somewheres between 75 and $100 per share. Current price is the new ground floor for PLUG. I’m looking for a new wave of investors coming on board. Following that a new wave of traders that will keep or attempt to keep the price stable between 75 and 100 for as long as they can until the next wave of investors arrive at the end of 2022."
"To all pumpers and cheerleaders on this board: ask Andy, send email to PR and ask about data center pedestal that Andy promised to reveal in June. More than two months have passed and no word had been put out in the press. Nada! Many investors on this board would like to hear any update and why the things are so quiet."
"Forrest says green hydrogen market could be worth $16 trillion by 2050Giles Parkinson 18 August 2021 61ShareTweet0ShareIron ore billionaire Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest has delivered some extraordinary predictions for the renewable hydrogen industry, saying it could grow to $16 trillion by 2050, “way more than any industry that exists today”.In a speech to the Clean Energy Council’s “Infinite Australia” webinar, Forrest – one of Australia’s richest men – also declared his goal of producing 15 million tonnes of renewable energy hydrogen by 2030 through his Fortescue Future Industries, and ridiculed the push for gas and sequestered hydrogen.The Australian fossil fuel industry, with the support of the federal government, is spending significant sums trying to produce hydrogen from coal and gas, coupled with the promise of carbon capture and storage, even though new studies say this combination will increase rather than cut emissions. “The oil and gas sector is preying on public hope, and the political opportunism this allows – by allowing the colours of the rainbow and calling it clean hydrogen, which of course, being made from fossil fuels, it is anything but,” Forrest said.“Blue, grey, pink, yellow hydrogen is not renewable green hydrogen. And don’t get me started on the smokescreen of sequestration.“The most recent argument that hydrogen made from fossil fuel whose carbon emissions have attempted to be sequestered – buried in the ground – is “the new green”, is false. Regardless of the success of sequestration – it normally fails, there are huge carbon emissions emitted in its process. “If it is not renewable green, don’t be fooled by any other colour coded spin. Any other colour than renewable green is dirty hydrogen.”Forrest says the green hydrogen market could create revenues of $US12 trillion ($A16 trillion) by 2050, an industry on the scale unlike any ever seen, as it meets clean energy needs in transport, energy and industry."
"Such a nice statement from the president Andy Marsh last Q2 ""We have a funnel today that exceeds $2 billion for electrolyzers. And as you can see, I put out relatively modest numbers for next year based on that. We are in negotiations with plants, which are as large -- which customers are looking for sites as large as one gigawatt. And just to give you a feel that, that one project would be somewhere in the $500 million to $600 million range."""
