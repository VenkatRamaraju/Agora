Want to get Stonepeak bought out first and then get investment grade from rating agencies first. Then increase dividend along with paying down more debt.
"Two great reports from TRGP:1.TRGP bought $300 Million face value of their own bonds back at 20% discount, thus making an instant $60 Million profit, plus annual interest savings of $12 Million in perpetuity.2. Leverage ratio is now reduced to a very respectable 4.1Nice !!"
"We got a pop because: Thu, June 3, 2021, 2:53 PMNEW YORK, June 3, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- S&P Dow Jones Indices will make the following changes to the S&P MidCap 400 effective prior to the opening of trading on Wednesday, June 9:Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP) will replace CoreLogic Inc. (NYSE:CLGX). Stone Point Capital and Insight Partners are acquiring CoreLogic in a deal expected to be completed soon pending final closing conditions."
"TRGP management did a plan outlining the profitability even if 20% (!!) of oil drillers who supply us with natural gas shut down. That's the $1.4 Billion EBITA on the low end of the 1.4 to 1.6 Billion. However, based on spot crude around $40, not only will the drillers not shut down, but if this price holds a bit longer, I'm sure new wells will be added in the Permian as they are making money hand over fist right now. We charge them by the volume for the NG flow. Also, as I predicted, propane exports rose (almost 30% in dollar terms). Here we charge by the commodity, as we outright buy the NG and sell the NGLs that we own. And I'm confident exports of NGLs will go through the roof. Currently propane is a big export, but in the future, butane and methane, will be exported to European and Asian customers who are paying SEVERAL TIMES Mont Belvieu prices, which is what we're getting now."
why stock go up?
Number of oil rigs running increases again. If oil holds in the high sixties this is a $70 stock. If Brent hits $80 (as Goldman predicts) this is a $90 stock.
Targa Resources reached a 52 Week high at 56.12

Xain you really should go back to school so as to gain a rudimentary comprehension of numbers and graphs
stock go up. why Xain no post?
When will targa restore the dividend to Pre Covid levels?
"Thanks for the run up in share price, will give them one more quarter to increase the dividend or I'm out. Six quarters at .10 down from .90."
why stock go up to be there as soon as possible thanks again for your time
why divident so small?
"Good to see that TRGP has been buying its debt back at discounts of 20-25%. While we all like getting dividend payments, we are really better off as shareholders with the discounted debt purchases, particularly given that a significant portion of the dividend is now taxable. So in effect, instead of ending up with $0.70 or $0.75, depending on tax rates, for each dollar of dividend, we have an additional $1.25 (20% debt discount) or $1.33 (25% debt discount) of equity in the business."
stock not move much any body now. why
TRGP has much valuable assets in many parts of the country. Other companies may be interested in their infrastructures which cost a lot to build new ones for other companies. TRGP has many other projects coming to fruition. The stock price is quite undervalued in my humble opinion. i am not surprised that Raymond James upgraded TRGP to strong buy at target price of 48 today and the stock price is going up.
"After they close on Stonepeak, they will reinstate the dividend at a lower level (with a promise to increase rapidly in 23 and 24. Share price will ramp up."
Why Xain continuously asking “why”?
