Do investors understand that this is a natural gas play and that natural gas is up about 50% in the last couple of weeks?
"$750 million in unsecured notes going out, but I can't see who is underwriting them. JP Morgan just upgraded a couple of days ago... whadya wanna bet they're involved somehow."
"Loving the move. Was tired of waiting and about to call in quits, and it sTArted to move! Patience is real virtue."
Great Buying opportunity today!!
"$10 early next week.Overblown panic gave us a chance to buy in single digits.The assets that Targa owns are extremely valuable.TRGP is a major player in the U.S. NGLs market, which is about to explode due to all the huge infrastructure being put in place to enable exporting our plentiful propane (NGL) and LNG to the rest of the world which is thirsty for it (and paying dearly)."
Goldman Sachs just started TRGP at a buy and shooting for $49!
"Consensus estimate for profits this quarter are 3 cents/share. If we add the ""accounting depreciation"" we get a very nice real profit (what accountants call cash flow from operations). But due to the reduction in interest expenses (after the recent refinancing), next quarter's profits are consensus at 12 cents/share. After adding back the depreciation accounting deduction, the profits cover many many times the new reduced dividend, and could even support something close to the old dividend."
Silence on the board.... no one wants to write anything until we break 30 ?
Well I jumped yesterday when the SP spiked. I left some on the table but today's earnings may give me a reentry opportunity...I'll consider it if the SP reacts the way I think it may.
Wish I had some more cash!!11.2% !!!! Wow!!! DRIP that for 10-20 years.. woo-hoo!!
Oh no... we're under 18.....(but not for long!!)
Frank. Just a few days ago you said the year end numbers were going to tank the great company. Please stop being a short that give out negative information out about a company that employees work hard every day to provide for there family as well to protect long term investors like myself. Ps I will take 2.50 a share bump any day or night. This company has potential and I believe in the management team.
"in 2016 targa went just below 15 in feb, was close to 60 by yr endoil touched 25 in feb and as at 50 by yr endcan you see a similar scenario not exact by #'s but somewhere close?"
Expecting another good day. The volume will start picking up steam. 62.50 by March 12th. This stock has been hammered by shorts and it’s time for the Longs to get a win. Divy coming soon.
"Two great reports from TRGP:1.TRGP bought $300 Million face value of their own bonds back at 20% discount, thus making an instant $60 Million profit, plus annual interest savings of $12 Million in perpetuity.2. Leverage ratio is now reduced to a very respectable 4.1Nice !!"
Today is the day for this stock to soar.
Never heard of this company but Cramer totally dissed it last night so I bought 100 at the open just as a test.
"Wow 20%... stopped trading This stock is truly getting beat up!! Oil prices are unbelievable.... can’t wait to see where we are at, in a couple years. Probably be very happy to own this stock!!"
Whats going on? Why the surge today?
"The IR presentations are a joke. A few questions for management: now that oil is pushing $70 per barrel and drilling activity is likely to increase how much spare capacity do you have? If you inlet volumes increased by 20 percent how much capital do you have to spend to process, transport, frac and then export? What would be the impact on annual EBITDA and what would be the multiple on that incremental capital? How would that impact the economics associated with the buyout of Stonepeak? It’s as though all this low cost growth upside is some secret Targa is hiding from potential investors."
60.00 in 51 days. See you all at 60.00. Good luck to all longs. Just a quick over view to all you longs. The new direction of the 1500 new concept store is doing extremely well. It is going to drive huge profits for CVS investors.
I am long ! Any reason for sharp move up?
Very nice 2nd quarter!!
Why today's sell off?
"I bought more today, luckily within a few cents of the days low...rounded out my # of shares. Now lets see what shes got. I'm hoping they don't bother the dividend."
I'm back in. I like the huge saving from the refinancing of the debt.Did anyone calculate how many cents per share this will add to the annual earnings ?(multiply by 10 to get the addition to the share price once the earnings reports are published?)I'm asking so I don't have to reinvent the wheel.
why divident so small?
Want to get Stonepeak bought out first and then get investment grade from rating agencies first. Then increase dividend along with paying down more debt.
stock go up. why Xain no post?
Since there is no news and volume is low I am guessing an institutional holder is getting out of their position.
Short covering yesterday.
"Up 8% after hours, anybody know what's up ?"
"I told you guys!!!! This thing is taking off, and I in at around 38!!!! And its going higher. GLTA"
Bought some more today and continue to reinvest all dividends. When the future looks bright but the market doesn’t see this is when I have gotten my Best Buy’s.
"Well I said I was neutral on the stock for now when really I wanted to say I was bearish because it had fallen to low $36s and then clawed back to just over $39 and than fallen to close below that on Friday. It would appear the big boys are at it again and exiting and will likely drive the price below the $36 point this time before it has a chance to claw its way back maybe over $37. Just an opinion boys, just an opinion."
Another 27 points and I’ll be back to even on this one. It’s been a long strange trip.
"Cheap, great divy, should be much higher, this is a long term gem to hold in your 401k..."
JP Morgan PT $24... Targa will come out on the other end of this leaner and more efficient. Earnings revised upward $.05
Make it stop Make it stop I’m all outta cash !!
"Bottom line, will this company survive ? Or headed to bankruptcy?"
when is this stock going to make a move up. So tired of the stagnation. Do something or I will sell you!
"The preferred is down just about as much as the common, the common just has to survive for the preferred to be worth full value. Makes no sense what so ever."
Going out of business? Preparing to cut the dividend? Lost 25% in a month.
Anyone see the write up in Barrons? Nice recommendation for TRGP. Still got a long way to go. Still long.
Today will be a very good day. Green and strong. $$$$
12 !My crystal ball sees 13 maybe even tomorrow...
Considering purchasing but can someone explain why this stock had a high of 139 back in 2014 and is where it is with NO splits today?
I hope we get back to 36 so I can buy a ton more. This will be 60 in 1 year.
I had to sell some that I bought at 7 ......
Up $2.... nice run today.
This rally in TRGP is well deserved as they are in a sweet spot for future growth. Long awaited.
Will TRGP eventually buy out Sanchez Midstream Partners? SNMP fighting Bankruptcy.
"Thanks for the run up in share price, will give them one more quarter to increase the dividend or I'm out. Six quarters at .10 down from .90."
stock not move much any body now. why
Based on that jobs report that just came out this stock is going to have another great day!
"recent added shares will dilute earnings, , dividends could be cut"
Will hit $20 by Friday
Call showed me that growth is continuing and they have cut some costs to help the company be more profitable.
"I don't know about the next few months, but by 2025 there will be a huge ""sucking sound"" (to quote the great Ross Perot) of natural gas (NG) flowing South through TRGP's pipelines. This time, it will be making us big bucks.https://www.rigzone.com/news/texas_lng_project_secures_air_permit-08-may-2020-162021-article/We all know one of the big growth engines for Targa's profits is exporting NGLs (liquid propane and methane). But NG also gets liquified (its a dangerous and expensive operation) to be sent on huge ""tanker"" ships to customers paying 2 to 6 times for NG than lucky U.S. consumers are. Fortunately, there are players willing to invest the billions, and put up with government red tape that takes years to bring a NG liquification port to operational state. And TRGP gets to charge a ""modest"" fee for piping the NG from the drillers. The (long term) future is so bright for TRGP, we need sunglasses. We just need to survive the short term. Based on the financials reported, it looks like the management has that covered."
Earnings this week so we will see an easy hike upward! Hopefully we get back to $26.

Are we feeling good about TRGP?
I don't expect a dividend increase until next year. Looks like they want to get their leverage ratio below 4%.
question for the group. i am new to the pipelines. why would you be in TRGP vs ET or PAA which seem to be stronger financially. TRGP lost money last year which concerns me going into this rough period.
"I don't know what happened to Yahoo news, but my Schwab news says TRGP has filed for a secondary offering. The proceeds are to be used for general corporate use including things like debt reduction, projects, and other reasons. It's kind of a double whammy on a down energy day."
Natural Gas prices through the roof! How will this impact TRGP??
On CNBC today one of the commentators mentioned the strong companies would be buying up competitors (with good assets) in most sectors.
Have to wonder why another company (like WMB for example) has not attempted a buyout while this company is trading on the cheap.?
"TRGP has weak covenant space vs the sector thus the need for the dividend cut. It has $2.9B in absolute liquidity, a revolver of $435M due in 2023, no term loans and only $7M in bonds/notes maturing in 2021. I think they will now outperform the sector given the action they took."
"Not very many followers on this stock/company... at least in this chat board. I know everything about Targa as they are a client of ours for many years. If Pioneer does well, so does Targa, but like Pioneer, it’s all about oil prices."
"Targa has plowed hundreds of millions in capital improvements the past several years but has little to show for it income wise. Just lackluster earnings,and management is just trying to pay down debt and keep over paying poor performing management. Targa and management have little respect for shareholders."
Looking at Targa to pick up a few shares . Is this a good price or better to wait a few months?
"Sell Sell Sell, Cramer doesn't like it... lol"
"This stock is very under valued, good company in a tough energy environment. They make money no matter the price of Natural Gas, as long as it flows through their pipes and they can extract the bi-products for sale to 3rd parties."
$30 by end of this year?
"2018 Dividend question - Does anyone know when the company will verify how much of last year's divds are Return of Capital? My broker's 1099 shows ALL qualified divd but shows heavy ROC on my basis page. I know that ALL of 2017's dividends were marked Return of Capital, or non-dividend distribution, and reduced our cost basis. So in reality the ""dividend Yield"" of TRGP is misleading for new share owners."
"TRGP management did a plan outlining the profitability even if 20% (!!) of oil drillers who supply us with natural gas shut down. That's the $1.4 Billion EBITA on the low end of the 1.4 to 1.6 Billion. However, based on spot crude around $40, not only will the drillers not shut down, but if this price holds a bit longer, I'm sure new wells will be added in the Permian as they are making money hand over fist right now. We charge them by the volume for the NG flow. Also, as I predicted, propane exports rose (almost 30% in dollar terms). Here we charge by the commodity, as we outright buy the NG and sell the NGLs that we own. And I'm confident exports of NGLs will go through the roof. Currently propane is a big export, but in the future, butane and methane, will be exported to European and Asian customers who are paying SEVERAL TIMES Mont Belvieu prices, which is what we're getting now."
What a recovery... I'm only down about half a buck on the shares I bought a week or so ago.
"Announced another Permian plant to come on line in 22. That’s in addition to the Heim plant that comes on line later this year. The liquids will flow through Ruby and then into existing Targa frac capacity. Cha-Ching! This also improves the economics of the Stonepeak buyout, which were already stellar."
"Now I'm stuck with my original shares, bought at $35 and $41 :(Hopefully in a year or two they will return to $1/share dividend, and we'll put this mess behind us. Until then I will assume the title ""bag holder""."
"Surprised someone like Enbridge, Kinder or Williams hasn’t tried to take these guys out (while the stock is still cheap). Most of the near term growth potential will be in NGLs; something these potential buyers should be salivating for in this market. Guess they are all waiting for TRGP to hit $50 per?"
why stock go up to be there as soon as possible thanks again for your time
Morgan Stanley raised TRGP price target from $44to $52 today.
"Excerpt from the last earnings call""So our general -- yes, our general targets as we work with the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors is to hedge 75% for the next 12 months out, 50% for the 12 months after that, 25% for the 12 months after that. Those are the general guidelines. And then within those general guidelines, on a quarterly basis, we're working with the Risk Committee to figure out the appropriate tolerance for hedges within Targa."""
TRGP is down -4.92% to 44.44
Holding steady even as the market tanks. How's that for strength and conviction by smart money!
Back to the low 40’s - Today!
If you sell to the shorts at these prices your will regret it. Tax loss selling over soon; back into the low 40’s by Jan.
I had better luck in Las Vegas
Do low natural gas prices Help or hurt Targa?
"Jeez a new $13 price target from CFRA??CFRA UPGRADES LP UNITS OF TARGA RESOURCE PARTNERS TO HOLD FROM STRONG SELL1:34 pm ET March 10, 2020 (CFRA) Our 12-month target price of $13 (slashed by $19) reflects an 8.5x multiple of enterprise value to forward EBITDA, well below TRGP's historical forward average, but in line with peers. Our upgrade is on valuation, with shares down 68% YTD, considerably worse than the median decline of 38% in our midstream coverage universe. TRGP has been shifting more of its business towards fee-based contracts as opposed to percent-of-proceeds, but it still has a material 20% of its business mix in '20 from the latter category. We think the rapid decline in share price in the last few days is a reflection of both exposure to such work as well as general concern over health of emerging markets (given the influence of coronavirus on business activity) and what that may do to demand for NGL's overseas. Although TRGP's net debt-to-capital ratio is high at 59%, we note no major maturities until 2023, buying management some time to recover from the recent swoon in crude oil prices."
Is this a buy at $35?
Nice shake out. Guess that answers the question of who was selling. Certainly not smart money! So what is the consensus on 44/share by end of next week? You guys should try Market Edge.
see will stock go up again tomorrow or sell here's.? anybody now?
"The media is saying that 25% of Texas electricity generation is from wind farms, and that they shut down when the temperature drops too low (as in the last few days). This sounds believable to me. In a situation like this, Texas, as well as neighbors on the grid (including CA) have standby natural gas fired generators to fill unexpected peak demand. From the proportions reported (25% of the state of TX !) I think they will all be at maximum power, burning all the NG they can get. Meanwhile, mobile homes, and regular homes in rural areas will be burning all the propane gas they can get to keep from freezing (imagine the cost of repairing water lines inside walls that bust from the water freezing and expanding).This is the perfect storm for TRGP who makes (""fracs"") propane gas and distributes it in Texas, as well as pumping NG from the wells to the NG thirsty consumers freezing everywhere. Add to that skyrocketing propane and NG prices in East Asia, and you have an unprecedented demand for LNG sailing from the gulf to Japan, Korea, and China.I can see TRGP leapfrogging to the high 40's after the earnings are reported for Q1 2021."
Targa Resources reached a 52 Week high at 56.12
Bought the first shares in 2014. Have invested all dividends and have added shares. Another 22 points and I’ll be whole. What a strange trip it’s been. Not my best investment I would say. But at least it’s recovering. If it had been in a taxable account I probably would have taken my loss years ago.
any thoughts on when we might see dividend increases?
TRGP is down 4.91% to 39.91
"With this stock's performance, the yield, the fact that Targa is a go-to company in the Permian and Bakken, the prospects for even higher o/g prices, why is this such a quiet board? Good things happening with Targa, folks."
"Let's see now.... if the communists make the cost of building new pipelines extremely high (now huge bribes to politicians are required), does that make the existing ones worth more?"
Cramer didn’t like it when it was $8
A little surprised at all the selling. A tremendous growth story if oil holds in the 50's.
"Got my fat dividend.I'm now waiting for early 2020 when distribution coverage can go back above 1.2 and the stock can go back to 60. New pipeline will be 100% on line by end of this year, in my estimation."
Targa Resources initiated at Piper Jaffray. Piper Jaffray analyst Pearce Hammond initiated coverage of Targa Resources with a $43 price target.
New bond issue is a hit.The partnership is now flush with cash.$0.75 billion to payoff the old bond (refinanced)and $0.75 billion for paying off the rip off bank credit and for new projects that will increase earnings.
"Looks like they are trying to save the company, smart move to cut the div."
I decided to buy at $42.33
Targa Resources reached a 52 Week high at 57.02
"As usual the latest presentation is chocked full of data, with little useful information. They have 320 thousand barrels of frac capacity coming on in 19, 20 and early 21. The volumes in the new NGL line are ramping up fairly quickly and it appears they can get up to 300 per day out of the Permian with their own plants under construction. My calculations indicate an incremental $600,000 a year of gross margin is possible from the new line and the three new fracs. Plus the contribution from the new plants, the gathering, and the export business. How about a single slide running through 2021 showing projected Ebitda, Long term debt, capital outlay from approved projects, and dividend coverage for each year? Or is some kind of secret?"
This is a long term hold for me so I will just wait it out and collect my dividends.
It seems like they should soon be announcing the amount & schedule for ev-div and payout...or did I miss it?
This will be 7s this week and Dividend cut in half at the least
"The Bakken deal was huge in that it allows TRGP to stop the ATM program, which was their highest cost of capital. Also, less future supply of stock should mean the price per increases, all other things equal."
"The tree shaking continuous, but I am holding on strong."
The SP today is doing well. A couple of more days like today will put me back in the plus column on the shares I own. GLTA... I'm torn over the decision to buy more.
"HOUSTON, April 03, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Targa Resources Corp. (TRGP) (""Targa"" or the ""Company"") announced today that it has closed on the sale of a 45 percent interest in Targa Badlands LLC, the entity that holds all of Targa’s assets in North Dakota, to funds managed by GSO Capital Partners and Blackstone Tactical Opportunities (collectively, “Blackstone”) for $1.6 billion in cash."
"Well they announced the dividend. Whew! I was sure sweating it. I'm glad that CFRA caution was not warranted, at least for this quarter. We'll see when earnings are reported how to proceed. Reuter's still rates it as Outperform... Market Edge Second Opinion says go Long... Credit Suisse Rating is at Outperform (since January) and Morningstar Rating is at 4 Stars out of 5 since Oct. 2"
Why Xain continuously asking “why”?
This FERC ruling will have no impact on TRGP.
"CFRA CUTS VIEW ON SHARES OF TARGA RESOURCES CORP. TO STRONG SELL FROM HOLDWe cut our 12-month target price by $7, to $34, reflecting a 9.8x multiple of enterprise value to projected '20 EBITDA, below TRGP's historical forward average, but above trough levels. We now see a '19 loss per share of $0.87 (widened by $0.57) and cut our '20 EPS estimate by $0.37 to $0.39. We are pessimistic on TRGP's prospects on two fronts. Based on data from S&P Global, we see natural gas liquids (NGL) pricing deteriorating through '20, which could weigh on demand for NGL logistics, an area that TRGP is expanding. In addition, we note that TRGP's distribution coverage ratio in '19 appears weak at just 0.9x, well below peers in the 1.25x range. We note TRGP's net debt-to-equity is at a multi-year high, and while it's possible that management would continue to support the dividend (yielding 9.4%) through short-term weakness, we do not think a dividend cut can be ruled out, especially if NGL pricing weakens."
"TRGP is going out of business? If not, how is this justified?"
board's thoughts on targa guidance based on $52 oil and now oil below 30will they have to stop div and how much of a loss until oil get back to at least upper 40's?
"trgp was down 90% in the 2016 bottom, that would make a 6$ target this time around before the bottom is in around april or may"
We all expected the market to go down for the next week or two.. but this stock has nowhere to go but up at this point. Nows a good time to average down in my opinion.. but we will see.
Number of oil rigs running increases again. If oil holds in the high sixties this is a $70 stock. If Brent hits $80 (as Goldman predicts) this is a $90 stock.
"Looking at the schedule of new projects coming on line, I can see TRGP is the 50's and even 60's in early 2020. From these currently depressed levels (that's why the div. yield is so high) that can be a 50% return, so I've been buying more shares. As a side benefit, this last ""X"" I racked up a huge dividend. But I'm going for the capital gain. Good luck to all my fellow investors!"
A new slide detailing the economics of the buyout of Stonepeake. 5-6x Ebitda on strategy assets. Would rather see excess cash flow going for this than for repurchase of common stock.
"They will be bought (in a stock for stock deal) by the likes of either OKE, WMB or KMI."
I lost a lot on my shares that I bought in the 30s but in the past few weeks... but I just kept doubling up my positions every week ... admittedly I have less than 10k invested in this stock in total..... but I was able to bring down my average price to 10.45 per share. I almost want to take the money and run but I am a sucker for dividends. I know its #$%$ right now.. but I think in the next few months as things loosen up.. they will be increasing the dividend just as they have done historically. I am not saying it will be back up to 90 cents per share again anytime soon.. but it wont stay at 10 cents a share forever. As this increases I think it will drive the prices back up to at least $15.00-18.00. If you thought it was worth investing in back when it was in the 30s.. then I saw the 7 dollar shares as a golden opportunity to increase my position and increase the potential for faster profit.
They don’t make it until year end without being bought. Assets are too good and too cheap. Will provide the likes of Williams or Kinder to enter the NGL sector in a big way.
"This stock is in a lot of MLP ETF's, but it isn't an MLP."
Should reach $42 price by 11/8/19
"Ok so now that the price of the stock has come back up to where it was and they have had so many months of paying only 10 cents a share in dividends, how long do you think it will be before the dividend comes back up to that 90 ish cents per share? It has been an OK run but I am thinking about selling it all and moving my money into LUMN and let that ride out for a while. I remember a year ago when this was around 33 per share, but its been a long time since it has been anywhere above 40. Without the dividend driving my cost basis down this is starting to lose its value in my overall portfolio."
"Bought more at $39.98 this morning. TRGP has a lot of projects coming online this year, which should improve divvy coverage, earnings second half of 2019, going into 2020. Most are fee based also. Just saying."
"We got a pop because: Thu, June 3, 2021, 2:53 PMNEW YORK, June 3, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- S&P Dow Jones Indices will make the following changes to the S&P MidCap 400 effective prior to the opening of trading on Wednesday, June 9:Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE:TRGP) will replace CoreLogic Inc. (NYSE:CLGX). Stone Point Capital and Insight Partners are acquiring CoreLogic in a deal expected to be completed soon pending final closing conditions."
This is trading based on the fear of a divy cut. If they hit their projections over the next 6-9 months this should trade up to a 6-7 percent yield. At some point over the next few years this company gets bought IMO.
why stock go up?
"Cheap, cheap, cheap and totally misunderstood. Grand Prix is a fantastic asset. Buffett or PSX should swoop in and pick TRGP on the cheap. Dividend would go away and all that cash would be available to the acquirer. TRGP has no debt maturities until 2023. Capex will decline now that Grand Prix is complete."
"I'm asking about the new bond's coupon rate because in February TRGP issued a 4% 1 billion $ bond (partially) to refinance the 5.25% older bond. This was, in itself, a big positive for TRGP's profitability. I'm wondering if the new 1.25 billion $ bond is at 3% (wishful thinking?) it would be AMAZING for TRGP's profitability."
"After they close on Stonepeak, they will reinstate the dividend at a lower level (with a promise to increase rapidly in 23 and 24. Share price will ramp up."
TRGP has much valuable assets in many parts of the country. Other companies may be interested in their infrastructures which cost a lot to build new ones for other companies. TRGP has many other projects coming to fruition. The stock price is quite undervalued in my humble opinion. i am not surprised that Raymond James upgraded TRGP to strong buy at target price of 48 today and the stock price is going up.
"Targa Resouces TRGP goes ex-dividend 10/31/2019. Excellent dividend of $.91, ($3.64 annual dividend). Stockinvest has TRGP as a ""Strong Buy Candidate"". A buy signal was issued from a pivot bottom point on Monday October 14, 2019, Indicators suggest TRGP should hit $42 by next week. Raymond James and UBS have a $52 price target."
Good Q1 results.
"Morgan Stanley said consolidation likely , looks like Targa could be target for it's natural gas units. Picked up another 1000 this morning"
"This is my good deed for the day. If oil settles in at $70 per, this is an $80 stock within 18 months. If your a short, close out your position and move on. If you don’t comply and get slaughtered, that’s on you."
Xain you really should go back to school so as to gain a rudimentary comprehension of numbers and graphs
"Targa Resources, Inc. (TRGP) Ex-Dividend Date Scheduled for January 29, 2021Contributor Jan 28, 2021 9:00AM ESTTarga Resources, Inc. (TRGP) will begin trading ex-dividend on January 29, 2021. A cash dividend payment of $0.1 per share is scheduled to be paid on February 16, 2021. Shareholders who purchased TRGP prior to the ex-dividend date are eligible for the cash dividend payment. This marks the 4th quarter that TRGP has paid the same dividend.The previous trading day's last sale of TRGP was $26.99, representing a -32.8% decrease from the 52 week high of $40.17 and a 637.43% increase over the 52 week low of $3.66.TRGP is a part of the Public Utilities sector, which includes companies such as Enbridge Inc (ENB) and Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD). TRGP's current earnings per share, an indicator of a company's profitability, is -$7.85. Zacks Investment Research reports TRGP's forecasted earnings growth in 2020 as 268.4%, compared to an industry average of 14.3%."
I am guessing this company has some intermediate and long term deep value here...
My guess is we won’t see a dividend increase until after the buyout of Stonepeak. Q1 of 2022.
"Broke into the green on this one today (overall). I was a little hesitant averaging down a couple of weeks ago, but living within a mile of one of their facilities, I sucked it up. Hopefully everything works out for this little company."
"Targa is a midstream company. Pioneer is an upstream company and Targa’s biggest client with over 50% of their revenues coming from Pioneer. Upstream O&G companies poke holes in the ground and produce oil and gas. Midstream companies take that oil and gas and process it and transport it. Processing is taking the gas and oil (mainly gas) and separates all the constituents (ethane, methane, propane, hexane, etc....they get heavier and you start getting into NGLs which fetch the better pricing) Targa provides that processing service to Pioneer. The more gas Pioneer produces, the more Targa processes.Hope this helps."
.50 today. Might even do better. As Frank noted March 16th we will be at 60.00 a share. Looks like a home run. Lol
"Hopefully we will see 2020-2012 projections (EBITDA, Cap Exp, Debt and dividend coverage) from this company when they report Q3 earnings in November. I really do not understand how they can spend this much capital (which has stressed all their financial metrics) and then omit what they expect the results will be."
"I am encouraged with the future prospects by the nature of the comments in the CC, including the following: ""We expect full year 2019 dividend coverage to be about 0.9x, assuming a flat $3.64 annual dividend with significantly higher coverage in the second half of 2019 than the first half."""
Upgrade and new PT of $22!
I'm thinking it will get up to around $35/share after the earnings call next week.
"Buy in the $33 to $35 range, sell in the $40 to $42 range. That is the only way to make money on this stock. Almost every opening it drops like a rock so if you short it at the opening you can buy it back mid day and make a nice profit. JMHO."
"Good to see that TRGP has been buying its debt back at discounts of 20-25%. While we all like getting dividend payments, we are really better off as shareholders with the discounted debt purchases, particularly given that a significant portion of the dividend is now taxable. So in effect, instead of ending up with $0.70 or $0.75, depending on tax rates, for each dollar of dividend, we have an additional $1.25 (20% debt discount) or $1.33 (25% debt discount) of equity in the business."
"this horrific stock is down in the premarket, when will we get a decent return on this , my least favorite stock"
The earnings report was excellent with improving margins overall and new infrastructure projects coming this year.
When will targa restore the dividend to Pre Covid levels?
Mild correction after a quick 10% gain over the last couple of days? In line with market pull back. Will go higher?
$10 !The good news is that I made fortune on the shares I bought in the 7's.The bad news is that I lost a bigger fortune on the shares I had bought in the 30's.Anyone care to share their opinions about what they expect to happen from here? Please leave sarcastic or cryptic comments to yourself.
"After the dividend is increased, we could return to $60."
I just wonder how they will handle the dividends in the future. I guess we will not see anything close to 1 USD per quater in the next 10 years but what is realistic? 0.25?
Pleased with the Q4 call and guidance. With the buyout of Stonepeak should be guiding close to $2 billion in EBITDA for 2022.
Who said this was light volume? This is a heavy down day on heavy volume. Apparently someone made their money and are placing it elsewhere with greater prospects for capital appreciation. Not aware of any new problems with Targa.
Director Rene Joyce had a margin call that resulted in his shares being dumped. It is against TRGP policy to have shares subject to a margin loan. This guy should be fired from the board. Complain to the company.
Great earnings report
"For what it's worth, my understanding is that about half their business is gathering and processing natural gas and that is susceptible to price drops in an economic slowdown. They also have a lot of expansion planned, and since they have such a high payout, they don't have a free cash flow sufficient to cover it, so they will borrow and sell some assets. The borrowing often requires refinancing so they are hurt by rising rates. Their LNG business is more reliable and a better profit driver than the gather and processing operations but it is still reliant on demand from some emerging markets like India and China. Slowdowns in global growth would hurt demand. Anything that hurts their profits may lower the dividend and their hefty is what attracts many buyers, so lower dividend and greater risk may result in selling."
"I am starting to think this might be the last 10 cent dividend.In 3 months, I would not be surprised to see a big dividend hike.Some experts are predicting $41/share now."
"The partnership has done far better the last year, i'm holding as of right now but not happy with the performance earnings will be important."
23 more points to go and I’ll be back to whole principle wise. And that includes investing all dividends and averaging down along the way. Long for the ride.
Isn’t time to buy? I have few hundred shares and I’m thinking to buy few hundred more? Any opinions? Thanks!
Rumor on the Street that Marathon Midstream might be interested in Targa to gain foothold in LNG exports?
This company probably has spent more $$$ on growth capital (for its size) than any other in this space; probably by a wide margin. When you spend that much capital on long lead time projects your probably not helping yourself by being so cryptic about how much incremental EBITDA you expect from those projects and by when.
"Targa seems to have wild swings for no reason - likely computer driven.I have been an investor for 5 years or more - through mergers, etc. and I always am amazed at the movement of this stock for no apparent reason - it does seem to trade with oil, so I guess oil being down 60 cents today is some reason - any thoughts here???"
If the low on the 30th was 47.66 how does the closing price for the 30th show 47 on the 31st?
