29.60 buy point.. ready to climb
Zach has the #1 strong by rating but a flat 0% ESP. That makes me a little nervous. Several upgrades and good news over the past few months. Can’t decide whether the hold through earnings or not. ￼
I think there should be more upside because there is more value here than the price offered and a much bigger value in future. Common shareholders are being unfairly compensated
"Fortuantely, PPC revenue from Asia is negligible. PPC does not even report sales in Asia. Only US, Mexico and Europe. No worries regarding China Tariffs with regards to PPC business. Tyson only sells about 5% to Asia, so the drop in TSN stock price over the China Tariffs is over-reaction.http://ir.pilgrims.com/news-releases/news-release-details/pilgrims-pride-reports-operating-income-372-million-and-gaap-epshttp://ir.tyson.com/investor-relations/news-releases/news-releases-details/2014/Tyson-Posts-Record-Second-Quarter-Sales-Exceed-90-Billion-as-Earnings-Increase-58-to-060/default.aspx"
They own 80 percent no one else will bid I sold 500 at 27-27.30 thank you JBS
"""Pilgrim's Pride (PPC) Q4 Earnings Lag, Weak Regions Hurt""Missed EPS by 3 cents: 9c vs 12c estimates. Not good report."
How do you expect the board to respond to the. JBS offer. ? How quick could this go thru
From what i just saw the vote will be us regular holders if this goes thru
Sitting at a 5 year low. Time for the board to get to work and make some changes.
Target for PPC is $23.57.
"With JBS already owning 80% of PPC I don’t see how the deal doesn’t close. This is one of those cases that a lawsuit actually benefits the shareholders of PPC. The BOD of PPC will simply rubber stamp the offer.Since the stock is trading above the buyout offer the market is apparently gambling a higher offering will happen except from who? No other company or person would want to just own 20% of PPC. Hence, as said, market may be pinning its hat on a class action. That is definitely no sure thing. Accordingly buying puts might be a good “bet.”"
Earnings was a mIss but all things considered is good. Buying more on dips. Day after release CFRA comes out with strong buy and for good reason. Tyson will rise now also because if pilgrims pride can work through the pandemic this well then Tyson will do at least as good.
Wow I was expecting a qtr mil settlement fine at least. Going back into this 200 shares at a time.. hopefully it doesn’t go up too fast now. Mighty fine business

Buy anywhere in the 15‘s and wait six months. This is a gold mine.
"PPC and it's primary owners will have to declare a dividend for me to engage holding PPC again. Turmoil in the meat/empoyee, feed, and trucking sectors will soon be forgotten,"
Today's piece by Zacks about PPC's momentum is a farce. I guess Zack didn't get the memo about the buy-out.
This is a total BS offer. Stock was at $36.00 couple of years back. Food stocks are doing very well at this point. Need at least $35.00.
They can have my shares at $38
"This is from Ycharts (Search chicken price history)US Chicken Wholesale Price is at a current level of 2.623, up from 2.350 last month and up from 2.335 one year ago. This is a change of 11.63% from last month and 12.36% from one year ago"
The real offer will have to be above $29
My son in law made 3.9 million on options.
Not sure why this stock is going down. The quarterly report was excellent as to sales and profit versus previous year. This company has made several major changes that should be reflected in an increase in price per share
Excellent earnings report. They beat everything. Grabbed 20 K on the dip at $23.39.
I think we can get all time highs by end of July. ASF & AI implications will have huge impacts on export demand.
"24 April 2019 - Poultry may very well become the world's most consumed meat in 2019, surpassing pork as African swine fever spreads continues to impact pig herds across China. According to Christine McCracken, senior protein analyst at Rabobank, there could be a historic opportunity for a lasting gain in market share for poultry.“Hog losses in China due to ASF will trigger big shocks in global protein markets,” McCracken told the International Poultry Council (IPC) at a meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana last week, “and poultry is the meat protein with the most to win ... Poultry consumption will indeed surpass that of pork in 2019, and pork will be unlikely to recoup its leadership position.”McCracken estimated that pork production losses in 2019 could amount to 14% of the world’s pork supply and may continue to move higher. “Expect imports of all proteins (beef, poultry and seafood) to have limited near-term impact. Prices for all proteins will rise.”In her view pork market stabilisation may begin in 2021 and a modest rebound of 1-2% in volumes could take place in 2022-2027, though environmental and slaughter constraints are likely to limit the size and speed of expansion.IPC president Jim Sumner was in agreement: “With China having lost 30% of its herd to ASF and with it producing 50% of the global supply, there is no doubt that poultry is now king of the meat proteins worldwide,” he said. But Dr. Paul Aho, President of Poultry Perspective, believes that poultry’s good fortune might not last long.Dr. Aho predicted pork production will drop 15% worldwide in 2019 and from there it will increase 5% per year for four years, and then continue increasing at a more modest 2% average per year. Meanwhile, poultry would increase 3% per year for three years (spurred in part by a shortage of pork) before dropping down to an average increase of 2% per year,” he predicted.“Poultry will surpass pork in production this year and will never relinquish the crown by my reckoning,” he said."
Don’t understand why down. First quarter numbers beat the estimates. Chicken prices on the rise and corn prices down !!
Excellent entry point !!
"In as much Mr Elon Musk has aided in the current liquidations,it's unavoidable,the market had it coming,time when traders and investors will be able to contain leverage positions. But considering the fact that crypto is the future it's also inevitable that another speculative growth is coming soon."
for months i told you and was stacking shares. market makers and sh price was not moving in face of upgrades and Kerry acquire. see ya.
Jobs knows the books probably not so great on sales due to feed margins ect can’t see a chicken going for 25 bucks in the store
"Ppc is in sweet spot right now. Big and global to meet protein demands (shelves are empty). They Are superb cost managers. Poultry is cheapest meat to produce, most versatile and quickest to bring to market. They have strong relations with us foods and other distributors. Their earnings power is unmatched now."
I regret that I had put a sell order and it got executed @18.87
"SAFM said the problem was the weak demand. In other words, too much supply. PPC may have a similar problem. Companies are usually too optimistic."
"The price is inflated, and JBS doesn't look serious about the buyout either...seems more like play to keep stock price in certain range above $26.5 and trap more gullible investors at higher valuation.... don't think there will be a buyback by JBS..its a big bluff and its working"
If they buy us out can we buy into another co. of the same business so wen don't have to pay a lot of taxes/
Looks like shorts are trying to cover a little 16.6 percent held by institutions3.4 percent short
"Why are the shares MORE than $26.50/share, because that's the acquisition price? The shares are trading at a premium from $26.50/share. This means, to me anyways, that the share price will go down to $26.50."
Quarter numbers were very good. Should be going up
"should you think wrong doing is negligence issue, think again muppet. rumor indicates several other meat marketers unrelated to ppc, are swept in now. if true, and with all the many names, suspect a very Rapid settlement for all involved. fed shall Not interrupt food chain."
