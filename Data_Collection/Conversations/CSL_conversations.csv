"biotherapeutics giant is a fantastic long term investment option for investors. This is due to the company’s world class CSL Behring and Seqirus businesses. These two businesses have leading therapies and vaccines, a growing plasma collection network, and extremely promising research and development pipeline."

When will Carlisle sell the Brake & Friction business. It is a failing endeavor with Chris Koch providing such in depth mico-management as to never allow the business to be successful. The business plan here is flawed and CSL should sell to someone who can salvage what is left. Less than 10% of the corporation's sales and a drain on resources and energy. Take the impairment and sell.
