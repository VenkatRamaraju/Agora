In with a position today at $90.85. Looks like this could be finally starting to breakout.
"Gonna go out on a limb and project that tomorrow we are gonna get a dividend elimination, massive raise of capital (secondary offering), elimination of guidance, and finally an earnings miss."
"Stock is so similar to AutoNation (AN) yet doesn't perform anything like it.. makes no sense to me! Especially after going no where off great earnings, though summer has always been big for car business."
This is one reason why i'm a strong buyer here...Crammer said good growth stock for making America strong again.......

I did some growth comparisons on some of the stocks that people have mentioned on Carvana conversations board. And Carvana stands out as the best growth stock without any doubt. Carvana has done an astonishing exceptional job in the past year growing at high speed through the pandemic. This is the comparison:$CVNA revenues grew 41% for the past year$VRM revenues grew 14% for the past year$CARG revenues declined by 6% for the past year$KMX revenues declined by 7% for the past year$PAG revenues declined by 12% for the past yearLooks like Carvana is taking market shares away from competitors very aggressively. The Carvana management has really done a very impressive job!
P/E of 5.5! Wow. Plus decent dividend. Buying opportunity.
Anyone know why this dipped so much today?
Penske Automotive is up 4.92% to 108.83
