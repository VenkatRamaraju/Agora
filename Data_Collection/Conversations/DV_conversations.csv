in a correction or bear market a P/S of 18x is way overpriced. watch this go under $20. cut your losses now. economy is slowing down due to inflation. the Fed is behind the curve in raising rates.
They had some interesting insights about DV on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.

"$DV is mightily overvalued at this price. Lots of lawsuits that at a minimum are a large distraction and at worst could result in multi-million dollar settlements, from a company that now has almost no cash on hand with it's most recent purchase in an industry that doesn't smell the greatest these days. Now the word on the street is that DV is jumping back into technical instruction again...the behemoth that DV is, is now getting into a segment that requires an absolute nimble approach to the fast-pace of technology? DV will be teaching even more classes that it's graduates can and will complain have little or no application in the market because it has already begun moving in a new direction. DV has a solid base with some of it's Nursing & CPA programs, but there is a lot about this company that isn't so solid, which brings me back to $DV being mightily overpriced at this point."
did it bounce off 34.50 or is it going to 34.50?
good stock
