Hey Diamondhands guess what! Short Interest payments are due on Wednesday. The massacre begins tomorrow. Shorts owe a fortune in Short Interest Monthly Payments based on the interest rates ranging from a low of 51% to a high of %499% via Ortex data. Shorts have to pay the lenders on Wednesday LOL

We’ll see at least +30% in pre-market
"So, was I right, or was I right? Look at the volume, 330 million. Once most investors discover what BBIG is all about, a TikTok competitor, the volume will become 1 billion, daily."

These guys (sellers) are playing right into the shorts hands. Selling for small profit while freeing up shares. Should be over $ 15.00 right now with this volume.
Got in at 7.10 can we see 15 end of the week
Maximum Cost to borrow478.54%
No shares available just hold and stop worrying
Can someone please answer me this. Why does this stock have over 300 million volume but the prices are moving sideways?
"Remember 51 institutions are invested in BBIG , check the list . they don't invest to lose money ."
