"Wow what a day today huh but folks, this is just the start as I keep trying to say.Do you have any idea what's about to unfold tomorrow? Here's a hint.First, just look where BBIG ended the day today almost at the day's high.That sends one very strong signal.Second, look what happened in the after-hours. See how they again ran it down to as low as they could get it? Where is it now?Again a strong display of strength.Third, if you're not taking a look right now at the BBIG 6 month chart then you should definitely be doing that to see the big picture.The price is catapulting and I propose the volume tomorrow will not let up as this after-hours session is proving.Volume now in after-hours eclipsed 13.5 million and guess what, I'm almost certain with all these indicators, this 8pm $8.12 price will seem low in the morning. Forth, as I've already pointed out, there's not going to be any over-head resistance from buyers at higher prices so the skies pretty much the limit with only profit takers pulling us back from time to time. Some have asked how high will it go but honestly I'd prefer not put a ceiling on how high it will go but with all this late night interest,I see a very nice gap up heading our way. Lastly just as was the case today, volume will certainly dictate the price. Just my humble old guy opinion and you can take it or leave it... Cheers..!"
"From down 11% to up 15%, what does that tell you? Yes, BBIG has the momentum."
I’m sitting on 1500 shares since last Friday and not selling until Friday.
Too funny. I cant wait for Afterhours
"i tell myself, never trade a stock in the first hr...but what do i do? Bag holding at 9.2 now, not concerned though."
We Got thisShorts are Done for !!!
This is going to MARS
Just added 250 shares @ 7.20
"What we all saw happen tonight at the end of the after-hours session is known in the hedge world as ""splashing"" the close. It is an often used method to make the late-night session appear to have given up ground when we all saw in actuality that it recovered very nicely from the after-hours attackjust like a big-time bull should didn't it? It won't matter one bit tomorrow morning people, look now at the futures in every index... UP! Now cheers to all who held the line and double-cheers to all who bought more like I did. I can't wait to see how high this goes tomorrow and where it will be on Friday at the bell and like I've said before, no reason to sell cause there's no way to lose at this point. Goodnight everybody... :-)"
Guys hold !!!!
Block anyone talking about other stocks
All Aboard
"$20 end the week,time to get in."
Gonna smoke & see how high this gets
Last chance to get in before we open at 12-15 tomorrow
"Someone fill me in, why do the shorties have to pay the short interest fee tomorrow? Why is the short interest fee due tomorrow?"
"Guy's relax, don't panic sell. There will be ladder attacks tomorrow and a ton of shills flooding this chat trying to make people sell. There are already shills making fake accounts with names of OG users on here to make them think they sold. There is a reason behind this!! These guys shorted over 11 million shares back when it was worth $2.89/share. They shorted 33 million worth of the stock. Now it's sitting at 8.40 AH and its bound to explode much higher. These guys are paying anywhere from 81-106% interest on a stock that is currently worth $8.40 and they are losing hundreds of thousands of dollars. If this explodes to $20 (which it most likely will by next week), then they will be losing millions. The shorts have hit us hard with every weapon at their disposal. The oldest trick in the book is to infiltrate the main chat forums and try to get people to panic sell. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM. Wait until you truly feel comfortable to sell, whatever that price may be. Because this hasnt even started to accelerate. Shorts added another few million shares to their short list and there is only 55000 available shares left to short. Everybody reading this, please broadcast this to every social media platform. Flood reddit with new posts about today's events. Get everybody on board, especially r/WallStreetBets. This will go boom very quickly. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, I JUST LIKE THE STOCK"
R. I. P. Shorts
I'll tell you what....I promise I will buy up all of your PROG tomorrow at $1.25 per share if you all switch to long positions and get this running to $20 tomorrow.
"Come on, $8.75 by close"
"on the Fintel website, it says no shares to borrow."

Good day everyone! $30-40 end of week! We got this! 
My suspicion somebody already has inside news on this...rapid drops taking out stop losses and then consistent accumulation. They are not getting my shares until 50.
"All that fuss and commotion this morning, it will be right back to where it started today in no time, and then most likely post a modest 10% profit for the day by the time is closes. HOLD and reap the generous benefits."

"BREAKING NEWS PART 2Based on the company's monthly active users, the combined valuation of the company following its recent acquisition is around $5 billion, he said. The company is doing well in countries outside of the United States, he said, adding that in places where Tik Tok is banned, including India, the company is doing extremely well. Lomotif is exploring how to enter the American and European markets, he added. The company expects to change Lomotif's name to ""Lomo,"" Farnsworth noted. Farnsworth told Benzinga the company has content agreements with Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) and Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) on the Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat platforms. ""We are definitely on a M&A trail of looking at things that make a lot of sense for us,"" he said."

"The PROXY result everyone's been talking about AKA The Merger.A lot of people here and elsewhere are confused about the proxy, and most don't even know know what a proxy is, simply put it's an individual who represents and votes on behalf of the shareholders (Us-retail investors) on a certain issue, say a proposed merger for instead. So who is BBIG merging with? A company called Zash Global Media, which is the majority owner of the social media app called Lomotif (Think TikTok) ""Founded by Paul Yang in 2014, Singapore-based Lomotif enables users to create, share, and watch short music videos with friends and has the patented technology for mixing and video editing. The app boasts of having over 225 million installations in 200+ countries in 300+ languages.""Ted Farnsworth, CEO of Zash recently announced that they will release the proxy result regarding the merger between Zash(Lomotif) and BBIG in few days. The most DREADFUL words in the stock market, a ""few days"", cause nobody what what the heck that means in English.Youtube search: $BBIG - Vinco Ventures on upcoming ProxyLong story short, if Lomotif is anything like TikTok, the merger will literally send BBIG stock price to the moon."

The stock has everything to keep momentum going for quite some time this is not a pump and dump this is a real gem!
"These guys only have 55000 shares left available to short. We are about to make massive gains tomorrow. PS, to any shorts reading this, how is paying 106% interest rate?"
I added 250 shares at opening to average down. I’m sitting on 1500 shares. Not worry at all in fact if I have more money I will buy more !

"Remember 51 institutions are invested in BBIG , check the list . they don't invest to lose money ."
Patience is a Virtue Stay Strong  
people hold this will be 20+ buy Friday
I've got some news if you don't already know this. A rising price between 1:45 and 2pm like what we're all seeing occur now is almost always a very good sign for an excellent run into the close and continued climb in after-hours. Just sayin...
Who bought above 6.50 and is holding? praying not to be a bagholder
Who shorted at 5.70 be honest.
"Man you PROG spammers are relentless!!! I actually have a small position in it but you guys are getting on my nerves too. Spamming another stocks board isn't going to make people go buy it, it's just going to #$%$ people off, and probably stay away from it. How is it you don't understand that???"
This price is a massive discount for what’s coming! $30+ soon
"SHORTS ARE TRAPPED.. NEWS08/31/2021, 04:00 PM ET - Benzinga Vinco Ventures Traps Shorts, Options Traders Bet Big On Squeeze Potential Vinco Ventures, Inc (NASDAQ: BBIG) on Monday gapped up 71% higher and opened at the $9.10 level amid speculation the stock was the latest target of a short squeeze. Vinco then hit a psychological resistance level at $10 where it ran into a group of sellers and closed the day down about 22%.Vinco traded down to $5.51 in Tuesday's session, which closed the gap and bulls came in and bought the dip. Because gaps fill 90% of the time, bullish traders may have been waiting for the gap to fill before taking a position.A number of options traders did exactly that and at 9:43 a.m., near when Vinco reached its low-of-day, the traders began hammering bullish call contracts which continued throughout the trading day. Together the traders bet over $3.33 million Vinco is headed higher over the following weeks and months."
I am wondering for those who didn’t buy today and see tomorrow the big price. What will be the look on their face?!Are you one of them?
"Per Ortex, 10x more shares borrowed than returned today. Cost to borrow avg of 220%. Explosion imminent."

Last chance
We’re holding strong here fellas!
This stock is looking very very charged for a serious run. I'm going to load the boat even more on the morning dip.!
Guess what! Short Interest payments are due on Wednesday. That's Today . Shorts owe a fortune in Short Interest Monthly Payments based on the interest rates ranging from a low of 220% to a high of %499% via Ortex data. Shorts have to pay the lenders TODAY
Why you selling??
"Today was a day of filling in yesterdays Gaps, which are done, the rest of the day is growth and valuation increase. Be ready for a fun ride from here!!!! $10 here we come!!!"

Bought this months ago in the high 4's. Averaged down when price dipped below 3. Been patiently waiting for this to fly. Honestly why would you sell now ? Great days lay ahead.
Bought a block here at $6.14 and have absolutely no worries. I know what's about to happen.
Bears were running show before I showed up. - Almighty Zeus
Houston we go for launch
Can someone explain to me what will happen when the shorts cover? Is it guaranteed that this will go up or are we hoping? I’m new to this so just a tad confused haha
Do not sell this now. Do not take profit. Shorts have to cover and need your shares. Sell at 8.10 or sell at 25? Its in your court. Do not sell this is not going back down
"Vinco Ventures Traps Shorts, Options Traders Bet Big On Squeeze Potential on Vinco in Tuesday's session, which closed the gap and bulls came in and bought the dip.

Together the traders bet over $3.33 million Vinco is headed higher over the following weeks and months. It's interesting to note there are now Vinco calls available for purchase with a $20 strike price."
Stay the course. Diamondhands are buying the dip and the paperhands will be gone. That is when the real fun begins just watch and learn. Do not set stop losses. This is going to turn north

if you are watching this and don't have a position here..... perhaps you should buy some now just in case there is proxy news released between now and 4am. you never know.
Go green - buy now we are almost there !10-15 per share is next
Can someone please answer me this. Why does this stock have over 300 million volume but the prices are moving sideways?

"Go BBIG or go home, folks!"
All shorts we are coming for you

Shorts be like....................
"ignore the bears, it’s clear their is heavy short attacks happening to drive the price down… putting up huge fake walls etc , just hold and don’t let weak emotion get to you. The float is small here, far more buys the last few days than ever before… this will slingshot once it breaks all resistance"
im glad this is scaring shorters
We just needed to close over eight and then 10 is our next resistance
What the ceo saying about shareholders being very happy in a few days? Are we getting preferred dividends or shares out of the merger?
if you see someone mentioning prog that they are loading up.. These are the short sellers trying to buy your shares from bbig
"Guy's the same thing just happened with SPRT, and everybody called it gme 2.0. Does this mean this is gme 3.0, because this thing is exploding. The shorts lost the battle today, but they will hit us with everything they have tomorrow. Start spreading the word people, the most powerful tool is information. Start blasting this across:r/WallStreetBetsr/WallStreetBetsNewr/PennyStocksI do not have enough reddit clout, someone here needs to spread the word. We need everybody to know about what is happening right now. We need a hero."
Shorts are like
Good night sweet shorts what recovery
+$10 after hours then open $15 tomorrow
"The volume is in our favour, the shorted shares are in our favour, one simple action to get rich……..HOLD HOLD HOLD. $10 per share is nothing $20 is warming up and $50 is real!!!!"

Tomorrow will be open above $10..massive volume....buy and hold..
if this can break 6.53 top bb we should have a strong gap up now there are literally 0 shares to short if people even bought a share each we'd be set....
"I bought 7500 shares @$8.05. I put my sell order in at $35. I hope this helps the squeeze, several of my friends are buying and holding with diamond hands too! GLTA"
Thumbs me if you guys think we going to $10 Tomorrow?
"I seriously have to just laugh. They see it run like it did today - They know the Shorts are in Trouble - They know the Shorts are going to pay dearly tomorrow - Yet, they still sell their shares. (???????????????????) I really don't get it. Baffling...."
Repeat after me. NO SHARES AVAILABLE TO SHORT.

"Not many bears here at all, everyone wants a piece of the BBIG pie."
"I bought at $9.01, I almost panicked this morning when I saw $5.50…. If you don’t know how good the stock is please get off this board and go to Prog …. This is your chance to experience what we’ve all experience with AMC and GameStop. If you sell your shares right now you are allowing the short $$$$ to win and lower the price. Everyone can do as they may because it’s your money but follow good do not follow evil! If someone is telling you to sell there’s a reason behind it they are not after your well-being! If someone is pumping up the stock that could only be good news because the more buyers the higher the price. Think about it for a sec? Why would a stranger tell you to sell your shares?"

"everyone PLEASE do not panic if the proxy is not released tonight - they have until COB Friday. The proxy has to be released 10 days before the record date for the final vote per SEC rules. Yes I know they publicly stated it would drop by end of the month, but things happen, thats life. They have 3 more days no need to rush it out if there are still fine details being ironed out. Do not buy into the Bears false narrative that the merger isn't happening or will be delayed again - the 2 past delays were due to the Lomotif acquisition and valuation audit taking longer than anticipated. Lomotif was based in Singapore, and if I learned anything from the TRCH/MMAT merger mess, it's that mergers with foreign entities take WAY WAY longer than your run of the mill domestic mergers. It took a solid month to finalize that debacle. The Lomotif deal is done. Everything is done. There will not be another delay, regardless of whether the proxy comes tonight or Friday. Just hold and relax."
Will be green today
AH and tomorrow will explode 
I realize a move to $10.00 by 8pm sounds to many like a hill to high to climb but I'm not so sure. I see the volume in the after-hours has now rocketed over 11.8 million sharesand rising quickly so I do not underestimate my guess even now.I believe this stock has proven today that almost anything is possible....Let's see?
