Should gap up in the morning pretty good based on this late action...
"check out how the investors are punishing the stock today, broken revenue promises are never a good thing. also take note of how past and current earnings discussion never detail recovery specifics. having confidence in this stock is almost impossible at this point. borrowing money to buy a profitable businesses then claiming profit is not how u run a business, is the whole thing just smoking mirrors"

"I have been a bull for 3 months, but this is dead money til warrants are filled or healight news, no denying this bulls.

Debt tender offer is a done deal...book value will increase from 500M to 650M...this stock will rise from .4 to $3 in next 2 weeks
move to ACOR much better
Then AH will take here away
i am a recent buyer of stock and lets not forget a pe fund controlled this and they did the typical roll up non sense. However at its current enterprise value to sales and the fact it is still generating ebitda makes this a great speculation. They are now rolling down from the roll ups and if they can just generate 60 to 70 mill in cash this year to pay down debt they can easily refinance into a secured loan. The rig count won't go much lower because only the majors are left and yes there are fewer customers but the customers left will be good ones.We sell alot of razor blades and remember we are in the depths of a depression for oil service. When you see companies like basic and key energy evaporate that shows you the extent of the damage.This company will survive which is all it has to do.Even if they stop liquidating inventory after this year they will survive. I believe with 60 mill debt paydown this year net debt assuming 60 mill in cash is 280 mill against 60 mill ebitda or 4.6 times in the depth of a depression. Assume in three years oil stabilizes if revenues stay at 1 billion and just a 10% ebitda margin that's 100 mill ebitda at 8 times whicjh is where the market will price it minus 280 mill in debt gives you 4.60 a share
Going to $1.60
We have achieved the note Exchange!!! https://ir.f-e-t.com/news-releases/news-release-details/forum-energy-technologies-inc-announces-expiration-and-results-0

finally!!
PEIX looks good 2
"Investors, if anyone is thinking long term with this stock I would exercise extreme caution at least until interest payments from all the borrowed cash hit the balance sheets. I suggest you study the weatherford model and how interest payments on large debt will eventually force an asset selloff. Another good indicator is leadership effectiveness, can anyone (outside the company) say changes have been made and are working?"
Any possibility it can pop up from now and make sure before July there are at least 10 days above 1 dollar?
still waiting on that $1 rise
Thank you .79 cents I'm almost full now
"study Weatherford, this stock will trade below 1.00 very soon"
I think oil is in for a long run of problems so loaded up 2 cent CETY Clean Energy breakthrough that is goimg to rival wind and solar. https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/21922151-bioresearch-alert/5421073-2-cent-cety-to-become-amazon-of-waste-heat-to-energy-rival-wind-and-solar
"With 20:1 RS, the actual stock value is 60 to 65 cents especially when oil prices are $46. Go figure: this company is in a make or break situation. ROI will be in question!"
Use to be a great company until they made changes to management and laid off a bunch of great employees. They hired a bunch of middle management losers. This company is pretty much worthless now and it will probably be bought out for pennies on the dollar.
FET is up 27.78% to 0.23

"There's no need for FET to execute a reverse split.... FET share price will be over $1,00 per share by end of year.,,"
Perhaps the BOD are considering RS? This could help especially when demand increases in summer. Still long way to go. All the best FET!
"We keep talking about debt, where are the profits or profitable assets purchased with all this borrowed money? seems like a large portion was wasted or sent in the wrong direction."
Forum Energy is up 41.18% to 0.47
FET is down 8.08% to $5.69
We should fly away soon
They had some interesting insights about FET on http://tradenow.xyz. Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Will reach to .7
I stand by my .80 per share in the near term run (which is about half way back since February)...seems to be the pattern. Could be today or early next week. Unless something bigger is brewing and then it will be above this level.
"24,000 shares here, we shall see...............I do have a punt point, but this one has regularly been all over the map......."
Shorts really Want to take high risk. Its gamble if hedge funds are shorting penny oil stocks $CPE $OAS $FET $CDEV $QEP. These stocks will have their days to be fair.

Bought this morning on the high at $0.41 was this a mistake? Does anyone think this will break 60 cents anytime soon?
FET is up 10.28% to 5.90
"Chris Gaut on the reverse split: ""It should be transparent and no impact on shareholders and just a matter of the math. And so you should expect that, that will occur this year.""This is an example of a technically true but misleading statement. Math is math, but what Mr. Gaut is leaving out of his statement is that when you do a reverse split, it is widely viewed as a broadcast of weakness in your business. That in turn can have the effect of suppressing your stock price after the reverse split. How FET will perform after the reverse split remains to be seen, but it would be very rare for a stock to have a reverse split from a position of strength, and FET is no exception."
"If you take a 5 year Operating CF + Add the Cash/AR, 1/2 of Inventory, Subtract all Liabilities, the company has a value of 2.7 a share. Obviously there was some risk the last two quarters, but it seems costs are under control and management is on notice. Congrats to the folks who bought the last two bottoms at .85 and 1.01"

"I am thinking whether to add more here. FET seems to be the only small company in the energy space that is trying to buy back it's debt for a nice discount. That shows 2 things. Management is opportunistic and taking advantage of the current bond market. Second, management is confident that their company will get through this when the dust settles."
