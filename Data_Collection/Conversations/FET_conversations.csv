"Do not be fooled with cash reserve numbers, there still remains no viable reset plan, a mountain of debt and fewer customers with each passing day. Chapter 13 is looming mark my words."
They had some interesting insights about FET on http://tradenow.xyz. Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"earnings alert, a stock price pullback is likely, usual story, low earnings, false promises, reduced outlook,,,"
"Hey, im old, on disability, found one of these apps... joined, whatever and decided to play with something cheap. This FET stock? Is it on it's way to zero? I feel bad for people that invested real money."
"i said a while ago buy PEIX at 0,22 look now"

"Fail. Teach ya to invest in hope, try to beat manipulators and in an oil related business when there’s so much else out there."
new 52 week low
Buy all these oil stocks $QEP $CPE $FET CDED $ OAS.
Todd has an alarm at $1.00. I don’t think he’s waking up any time soon
bond restructuring announcent soon. catalyst coming...
all in 100k shares
can anybody explain to me (please) why tf when oil goes up fet trembles and the opposite?can't wrap my head around it
Do the convertible debt holders have a short position in the stock?
Should be breaking out over the next few days...probably hit .80 per share which is about half way back. Something bigger could be in play too...just saying.
"post market up + $0.16, someone knows something we dont know !!!!"
"With 20:1 RS, the actual stock value is 60 to 65 cents especially when oil prices are $46. Go figure: this company is in a make or break situation. ROI will be in question!"
FET is up 6.98% to $4.82
from 2011 to 2014 average crude oil price was $95.50 and fet didn't make any profit then so how they will do now?
"check out how the investors are punishing the stock today, broken revenue promises are never a good thing. also take note of how past and current earnings discussion never detail recovery specifics. having confidence in this stock is almost impossible at this point. borrowing money to buy a profitable businesses then claiming profit is not how u run a business, is the whole thing just smoking mirrors"
citi group want 1.00 atleast
"Have fun, opec talks are about dropping production for all ...market is overfilled.. This wont come back for a year or two if it does."
"good company, medium products, profit projections vs debt reduction does not inspire. I have watched this stock underperformfor quite some time with no effective recovery plan. Study weatherford very carefully, this will predict the forum future."
"Investors, if anyone is thinking long term with this stock I would exercise extreme caution at least until interest payments from all the borrowed cash hit the balance sheets. I suggest you study the weatherford model and how interest payments on large debt will eventually force an asset selloff. Another good indicator is leadership effectiveness, can anyone (outside the company) say changes have been made and are working?"
"FET: Market cap $398M, Revenue: 1B, debt: 600B, cash $29m. Need to cut cost to survive, else end up like WFT, and TTI. TTI is at its worst! compare their financials...."
FET is the only stock green !!
Do your own DD.Ftsi is positioned financially a bit stronger.this looks interesting also...
Forum Energy is up 41.18% to 0.47
1 for 25 Reveres split soon
Dman you think by open it will be too alate to get in ?
Jackpot!!!
Thought we were due to move up...maybe time to move on
"Optimistic, but .44 (50SMA) will be resistance, as it was back on march 9th and 13th. If that can be conquered then there's a gap to fill up to .55 from march 6th. supposed to be an earnings report soon, so who knows what that will do"
I stand by my .80 per share in the near term run (which is about half way back since February)...seems to be the pattern. Could be today or early next week. Unless something bigger is brewing and then it will be above this level.
I have total 250k shares of these stocks $CPE $QEP $FET $CDEV $OAS and will sell at 3 bucks plus. Still super good buy at super cheap price.
Institutes bought well over 60 million shares over $0.9https://fintel.io/so/us/fet
so much more cash available than listed market cap...clear potential here
They have 100M+ net cash flow target for coming years ( which they proved in last 3 quarters)..net debt is very low..with revenue increasing in 2020 and cost declining..this stock is steal at this price
$WLL $OAS $FET $DNR everyone get in $AXAS its starting to run!
"I've been long since $16.31 per share...I need some reprieve, left it in an account years ago and here we are lots of money losses later..."
"FET Insider Buy Alert!Director John A Carrig bought 50,000 shares @ $22.28 for $1,114,000.00 on May 21st!"
"U guys remember when i said to buy peix 0,38 ,told me to get lost ,peix 2,58 now"
PEIX .so under value with 1.4 billion in revenue and market cap of only 35 million
PEIX exploding
"OAS is $1+, FET will catch up"
Bought this morning on the high at $0.41 was this a mistake? Does anyone think this will break 60 cents anytime soon?
Run up will start very soon for $TUSK. $OAS $QEP $CPE $CDEV $FET longs load up ASAP
Forum Energy is up 31.76% to 0.43

"Financials look good. 90M Operating cash flow, YOY Cash is up 10M, AP down 40M, Debt down 118M. Margin-SGA improved by YOY. They'll need to restructure the debt due in Q3 2021 most likely, but that shouldn't be an issue. By next year the debt will be reduced by another 100M+"
It will reach $1 in next few days
Congrats to all longs from these penny oil stocks $QEP $CPE $OAS $CDEV $FET. Have great great weekend. MAGA all the way. Trump 2020.
insider buy！ good sign for oil
FET is down -6.85% to 11.55
is it wise to hold over the weekend?
Insider buys are surging..other companies are declining with oil but FET is holding to .5...it will soon be at $2
This stock will be at $5 before 2020 end when people will realize it’s true value..
".90 is very optimistic,,,,,this is a weatherford copy paste,,,,my prediction is they will be delisted by April 2020,,,,"
Congrats long $OAS $CPE $CDEV $ QEP $FET. Another undervalued oil stock you need to get in early $TUSK. LOAD UP
"Is this a good investment or ,,, i got in .41"
Keep buying back convertible debt. It trades at a discount and is similar to buying back shares.
Repeat of WFT situation here. Identical however lesser debts than WFT. Hopefully FET May get out of this situation in couple of months.
$2 very soon..very strong fundamentals..debt reduction to 0%..strong cash flow..cost saving strategies..list goes on
"So, if FET is able to buy back $80M of debt (max offered in the tender), they will retire $200M or about half of their total long term debt. That will be a steal for the shareholders..."
i am a recent buyer of stock and lets not forget a pe fund controlled this and they did the typical roll up non sense. However at its current enterprise value to sales and the fact it is still generating ebitda makes this a great speculation. They are now rolling down from the roll ups and if they can just generate 60 to 70 mill in cash this year to pay down debt they can easily refinance into a secured loan. The rig count won't go much lower because only the majors are left and yes there are fewer customers but the customers left will be good ones.We sell alot of razor blades and remember we are in the depths of a depression for oil service. When you see companies like basic and key energy evaporate that shows you the extent of the damage.This company will survive which is all it has to do.Even if they stop liquidating inventory after this year they will survive. I believe with 60 mill debt paydown this year net debt assuming 60 mill in cash is 280 mill against 60 mill ebitda or 4.6 times in the depth of a depression. Assume in three years oil stabilizes if revenues stay at 1 billion and just a 10% ebitda margin that's 100 mill ebitda at 8 times whicjh is where the market will price it minus 280 mill in debt gives you 4.60 a share

Buy in while you can! Market will open and this will spike! Expect +50% gains again today!!
Earning tomorrow before market hopefully little increase but not sure the whole sector in trouble and will see how the president will help.
Use to be a great company until they made changes to management and laid off a bunch of great employees. They hired a bunch of middle management losers. This company is pretty much worthless now and it will probably be bought out for pennies on the dollar.
We should fly away soon
"Chris Gaut on the reverse split: ""It should be transparent and no impact on shareholders and just a matter of the math. And so you should expect that, that will occur this year.""This is an example of a technically true but misleading statement. Math is math, but what Mr. Gaut is leaving out of his statement is that when you do a reverse split, it is widely viewed as a broadcast of weakness in your business. That in turn can have the effect of suppressing your stock price after the reverse split. How FET will perform after the reverse split remains to be seen, but it would be very rare for a stock to have a reverse split from a position of strength, and FET is no exception."
Feeling good about the rest of this week.

"Wow... Insider just lost $74,500 in 2 months"
FET is up 6.18% to $8.59
"I am thinking whether to add more here. FET seems to be the only small company in the energy space that is trying to buy back it's debt for a nice discount. That shows 2 things. Management is opportunistic and taking advantage of the current bond market. Second, management is confident that their company will get through this when the dust settles."
ftsi same like fet just 10 time more cash on hand
tomorrow will be continue keep it up guys
"good job FET, keep up"
"I'm starting to watch this company, may i ask why do you guys think it will go up?"
