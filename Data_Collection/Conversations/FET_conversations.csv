today was another 52 week low
"post market up + $0.16, someone knows something we dont know !!!!"
why this is going up!!! what news we are missing?
"FET Insider Buy Alert!Director John A Carrig bought 50,000 shares @ $22.28 for $1,114,000.00 on May 21st!"
so much more cash available than listed market cap...clear potential here
from 2011 to 2014 average crude oil price was $95.50 and fet didn't make any profit then so how they will do now?
I have total 250k shares of these stocks $CPE $QEP $FET $CDEV $OAS and will sell at 3 bucks plus. Still super good buy at super cheap price.
sold all my oil related stock's on Friday
Debt tender offer is a done deal...book value will increase from 500M to 650M...this stock will rise from .4 to $3 in next 2 weeks
Buy all these oil stocks $QEP $CPE $FET CDED $ OAS.
"the final nail will be poor 1qtr earnings, debt interest payment, low sales, and NYSE stock delist. There is no good news on the horizon. I forecast business liquidation and a chapter13 filing is iminent! All due to greedy mgmt. and poor planning."
Shorts really Want to take high risk. Its gamble if hedge funds are shorting penny oil stocks $CPE $OAS $FET $CDEV $QEP. These stocks will have their days to be fair.
Insider buys are surging..other companies are declining with oil but FET is holding to .5...it will soon be at $2
Keep buying back convertible debt. It trades at a discount and is similar to buying back shares.
I stand by my .80 per share in the near term run (which is about half way back since February)...seems to be the pattern. Could be today or early next week. Unless something bigger is brewing and then it will be above this level.
"If it breaks 2.50 the stock will go into freefall due to trading panic,,,,,there will be no bottom in site !!!!! Weatherford echo !!!!"
i am a recent buyer of stock and lets not forget a pe fund controlled this and they did the typical roll up non sense. However at its current enterprise value to sales and the fact it is still generating ebitda makes this a great speculation. They are now rolling down from the roll ups and if they can just generate 60 to 70 mill in cash this year to pay down debt they can easily refinance into a secured loan. The rig count won't go much lower because only the majors are left and yes there are fewer customers but the customers left will be good ones.We sell alot of razor blades and remember we are in the depths of a depression for oil service. When you see companies like basic and key energy evaporate that shows you the extent of the damage.This company will survive which is all it has to do.Even if they stop liquidating inventory after this year they will survive. I believe with 60 mill debt paydown this year net debt assuming 60 mill in cash is 280 mill against 60 mill ebitda or 4.6 times in the depth of a depression. Assume in three years oil stabilizes if revenues stay at 1 billion and just a 10% ebitda margin that's 100 mill ebitda at 8 times whicjh is where the market will price it minus 280 mill in debt gives you 4.60 a share
"I have been a bull for 3 months, but this is dead money til warrants are filled or healight news, no denying this bulls. There is tremendous upside.Testing for healight, will not be for another 3-6 months at least. To create an injection mold in the medical device industry takes 2-4 months at the fastest pace... making sure parts fit, work, proper materials etc. etc. etc.Oil is down today and some really nice entry points - here are some ideas:$BORR $PACD $FET $SSL - all track CL=FI will be back AYTU Fam."
"Is this a good investment or ,,, i got in .41"
Bought this morning on the high at $0.41 was this a mistake? Does anyone think this will break 60 cents anytime soon?
$2 very soon..very strong fundamentals..debt reduction to 0%..strong cash flow..cost saving strategies..list goes on
Is this the week?
"I am thinking whether to add more here. FET seems to be the only small company in the energy space that is trying to buy back it's debt for a nice discount. That shows 2 things. Management is opportunistic and taking advantage of the current bond market. Second, management is confident that their company will get through this when the dust settles."
This is an oil equipment company with $400M plus book value and 1B revenue
"Chris Gaut on the reverse split: ""It should be transparent and no impact on shareholders and just a matter of the math. And so you should expect that, that will occur this year.""This is an example of a technically true but misleading statement. Math is math, but what Mr. Gaut is leaving out of his statement is that when you do a reverse split, it is widely viewed as a broadcast of weakness in your business. That in turn can have the effect of suppressing your stock price after the reverse split. How FET will perform after the reverse split remains to be seen, but it would be very rare for a stock to have a reverse split from a position of strength, and FET is no exception."
"good company, medium products, profit projections vs debt reduction does not inspire. I have watched this stock underperformfor quite some time with no effective recovery plan. Study weatherford very carefully, this will predict the forum future."
bought 100k shares around 23 cents two days ago.This is how I win
We have achieved the note Exchange!!! https://ir.f-e-t.com/news-releases/news-release-details/forum-energy-technologies-inc-announces-expiration-and-results-0
oil 39 and dropping we should see oil price drop to about $19 by December so all those small cup companies will not survive i expect FET to drop between. 015 to .25 next two months
Do the convertible debt holders have a short position in the stock?
"Sec filing that was filed last night, looks like we are leaning on the side of it being a done deal.https://ir.f-e-t.com/static-files/e4c20c53-3cfc-4277-a53d-23f852fb8052"
"Investors, if anyone is thinking long term with this stock I would exercise extreme caution at least until interest payments from all the borrowed cash hit the balance sheets. I suggest you study the weatherford model and how interest payments on large debt will eventually force an asset selloff. Another good indicator is leadership effectiveness, can anyone (outside the company) say changes have been made and are working?"
"FET Gapping up nicely. Volume will break all your moving average resistance 44c,54c Keep your pocket open to grab half a dollar per share. Oil and energy are the sectors to watch tomorrow FET Rock n Roll "
so what do you think about the frist quarter released. 033 lost per share i need any input?
Congrats to all longs from these penny oil stocks $QEP $CPE $OAS $CDEV $FET. Have great great weekend. MAGA all the way. Trump 2020.
breakout overnighter
$1+ by tomorrow!

"Do not be fooled with cash reserve numbers, there still remains no viable reset plan, a mountain of debt and fewer customers with each passing day. Chapter 13 is looming mark my words."
"We keep talking about debt, where are the profits or profitable assets purchased with all this borrowed money? seems like a large portion was wasted or sent in the wrong direction."
