"I have been a bull for 3 months, but this is dead money til warrants are filled or healight news, no denying this bulls. There is tremendous upside.Testing for healight, will not be for another 3-6 months at least. To create an injection mold in the medical device industry takes 2-4 months at the fastest pace... making sure parts fit, work, proper materials etc. etc. etc.Oil is down today and some really nice entry points - here are some ideas:$BORR $PACD $FET $SSL - all track CL=FI will be back AYTU Fam."
They have 100M+ net cash flow target for coming years ( which they proved in last 3 quarters)..net debt is very low..with revenue increasing in 2020 and cost declining..this stock is steal at this price

I hope this manipulation ends and we fly to $5 book value
Fet has been reacting like this the past month and half .it goes up 15 to 20 cent in 3 days then back down .eventually it wont go back down
Is this the week?
"Do not be fooled with cash reserve numbers, there still remains no viable reset plan, a mountain of debt and fewer customers with each passing day. Chapter 13 is looming mark my words."
insider buy！ good sign for oil
Buy these cheap stocks $FET $OAS $QEP $CPE $CDEV $OVV $OII. You will have very nice summer.
They had some interesting insights about FET on http://tradenow.xyz. Definitely made me think twice about the company.
PEIX .so under value with 1.4 billion in revenue and market cap of only 35 million
"when this board quite, is the time up"
"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4326613-forum-energy-technologies-is-down-not-outGood article. Obviously this a risk play, however the company is oversold and undervalued based on its 2019 numbers."
"i said a while ago buy PEIX at 0,22 look now"
Buy all these oil stocks $QEP $CPE $FET CDED $ OAS.
bought 100k shares around 23 cents two days ago.This is how I win

Insiders buy a lot of shares.I am long!http://insiderbuyingselling.com/?t=fet
Todd has an alarm at $1.00. I don’t think he’s waking up any time soon
anyone think we will get to $.25?

wow bad report .time to jump ship!
"With 20:1 RS, the actual stock value is 60 to 65 cents especially when oil prices are $46. Go figure: this company is in a make or break situation. ROI will be in question!"
This stock will be at $5 before 2020 end when people will realize it’s true value..
"the final nail will be poor 1qtr earnings, debt interest payment, low sales, and NYSE stock delist. There is no good news on the horizon. I forecast business liquidation and a chapter13 filing is iminent! All due to greedy mgmt. and poor planning."
ftsi same like fet just 10 time more cash on hand
It will reach $1 in next few days
"Here come the oil pumps... the night before Calls expire  3,2,1...  https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Russian-Oil-Minister-Get-Ready-for-a-Significant-Uptick-In-Crude-Oil-Demand.htmlhttps://oilprice.com/Energy/Natural-Gas/Five-Value-Stocks-In-Natural-Gas.html$OAS, $CPE, $VAL, $FET"
"Fail. Teach ya to invest in hope, try to beat manipulators and in an oil related business when there’s so much else out there."
"Investors, if anyone is thinking long term with this stock I would exercise extreme caution at least until interest payments from all the borrowed cash hit the balance sheets. I suggest you study the weatherford model and how interest payments on large debt will eventually force an asset selloff. Another good indicator is leadership effectiveness, can anyone (outside the company) say changes have been made and are working?"
$WLL $OAS $FET $DNR everyone get in $AXAS its starting to run!
"Wow... Insider just lost $74,500 in 2 months"

FET is the only stock green !!
quiet as a mouse in here. earnings 7days now ......... wanna see a run up. .
Think about it. These companies $OAS $CPE $FET $CDEV are working hard to deal like $QEP. Oil is UP again. Load up while they are super cheap.
Are you guys part of (https:// www.tradenow.xyz)? They just talked about FET.
Debt tender offer is a done deal...book value will increase from 500M to 650M...this stock will rise from .4 to $3 in next 2 weeks

What is up with this flat line? Can anyone shed some light?
Will reach to .7
1 for 25 Reveres split soon
"good company, medium products, profit projections vs debt reduction does not inspire. I have watched this stock underperformfor quite some time with no effective recovery plan. Study weatherford very carefully, this will predict the forum future."
"post market up + $0.16, someone knows something we dont know !!!!"
Forum Energy is up 9.58% to 20.71
Check out Chap guys. Take your profits to the next rocket
today was another 52 week low
I stand by my .80 per share in the near term run (which is about half way back since February)...seems to be the pattern. Could be today or early next week. Unless something bigger is brewing and then it will be above this level.
"Hey, im old, on disability, found one of these apps... joined, whatever and decided to play with something cheap. This FET stock? Is it on it's way to zero? I feel bad for people that invested real money."

"In 2 quarters this organization needs to file bankruptcy. 28M cash, 500M enterprise value, and 600M in debts?"
Congrats to all longs from these penny oil stocks $QEP $CPE $OAS $CDEV $FET. Have great great weekend. MAGA all the way. Trump 2020.
Should gap up in the morning pretty good based on this late action...
I have total 250k shares of these stocks $CPE $QEP $FET $CDEV $OAS and will sell at 3 bucks plus. Still super good buy at super cheap price.
Going to $1.60
still a huge risk with no viable plan for near term profitability
This is an oil equipment company with $400M plus book value and 1B revenue
"We keep talking about debt, where are the profits or profitable assets purchased with all this borrowed money? seems like a large portion was wasted or sent in the wrong direction."
finally!!
$1+ by tomorrow!
"and here is the part where I remind everyone told ya so, check the analyst ratings and outlook."
"earnings alert, a stock price pullback is likely, usual story, low earnings, false promises, reduced outlook,,,"
Bought this morning on the high at $0.41 was this a mistake? Does anyone think this will break 60 cents anytime soon?
Tomorrow will be a 2000+ gain for Dow. Stimulus plans are being implemented next couple of days will be upward trending. $MSFT $ZM $ZOOM $FET
"tomorrow OPEC+ meeting to assure more cuts, Monday will be big day, I hope!"

"If it breaks 2.50 the stock will go into freefall due to trading panic,,,,,there will be no bottom in site !!!!! Weatherford echo !!!!"
So what's the consensus on the issuing of 124 mil shares for the 2021 debt?
Use to be a great company until they made changes to management and laid off a bunch of great employees. They hired a bunch of middle management losers. This company is pretty much worthless now and it will probably be bought out for pennies on the dollar.
Forum Energy is up 31.76% to 0.43
Forum Energy is up 13.69% to 10.96
"I’m into this 2000 shares at .35 couple hundred bucks going to 44 hope it goes up to 58 Texas is open again but consumption is not, so who knows"

"If you take a 5 year Operating CF + Add the Cash/AR, 1/2 of Inventory, Subtract all Liabilities, the company has a value of 2.7 a share. Obviously there was some risk the last two quarters, but it seems costs are under control and management is on notice. Congrats to the folks who bought the last two bottoms at .85 and 1.01"
"FET Insider Buy Alert!Director John A Carrig bought 50,000 shares @ $22.28 for $1,114,000.00 on May 21st!"
so much more cash available than listed market cap...clear potential here
"There's no need for FET to execute a reverse split.... FET share price will be over $1,00 per share by end of year.,,"
Thought we were due to move up...maybe time to move on
"good job FET, keep up"
Should be breaking out over the next few days...probably hit .80 per share which is about half way back. Something bigger could be in play too...just saying.
Do the convertible debt holders have a short position in the stock?
"Chris Gaut on the reverse split: ""It should be transparent and no impact on shareholders and just a matter of the math. And so you should expect that, that will occur this year.""This is an example of a technically true but misleading statement. Math is math, but what Mr. Gaut is leaving out of his statement is that when you do a reverse split, it is widely viewed as a broadcast of weakness in your business. That in turn can have the effect of suppressing your stock price after the reverse split. How FET will perform after the reverse split remains to be seen, but it would be very rare for a stock to have a reverse split from a position of strength, and FET is no exception."
"PEIX ,BEAT REVENUE BY 50 MILLION FLYING AFTER HOURS"
this dog has flees
"Financials look good. 90M Operating cash flow, YOY Cash is up 10M, AP down 40M, Debt down 118M. Margin-SGA improved by YOY. They'll need to restructure the debt due in Q3 2021 most likely, but that shouldn't be an issue. By next year the debt will be reduced by another 100M+"
"If the fracking companies are rattled, I don't see how this company goes away. All the majors do a lot of offshore work. Thoughts?"
its green...wth is going on. lol...
"FET is a Cup and a Handle in the Bullish Char, and it's a BUY!!"
"I'm starting to watch this company, may i ask why do you guys think it will go up?"
"Is this a good investment or ,,, i got in .41"
FET is 85% owned by tutes
Can they take this company to private? Why not?
Tender offer will be successful and will soon see $1 as a bargain price
"FET: Market cap $398M, Revenue: 1B, debt: 600B, cash $29m. Need to cut cost to survive, else end up like WFT, and TTI. TTI is at its worst! compare their financials...."
Congrats long $OAS $CPE $CDEV $ QEP $FET. Another undervalued oil stock you need to get in early $TUSK. LOAD UP
"FET Gapping up nicely. Volume will break all your moving average resistance 44c,54c Keep your pocket open to grab half a dollar per share. Oil and energy are the sectors to watch tomorrow FET Rock n Roll "
Institutes bought well over 60 million shares over $0.9https://fintel.io/so/us/fet
from 2011 to 2014 average crude oil price was $95.50 and fet didn't make any profit then so how they will do now?
Shorts really Want to take high risk. Its gamble if hedge funds are shorting penny oil stocks $CPE $OAS $FET $CDEV $QEP. These stocks will have their days to be fair.
who owns PEIX 2
Can this be 1.75 next week
Forum Energy is up 14.67% to 9.77
i am a recent buyer of stock and lets not forget a pe fund controlled this and they did the typical roll up non sense. However at its current enterprise value to sales and the fact it is still generating ebitda makes this a great speculation. They are now rolling down from the roll ups and if they can just generate 60 to 70 mill in cash this year to pay down debt they can easily refinance into a secured loan. The rig count won't go much lower because only the majors are left and yes there are fewer customers but the customers left will be good ones.We sell alot of razor blades and remember we are in the depths of a depression for oil service. When you see companies like basic and key energy evaporate that shows you the extent of the damage.This company will survive which is all it has to do.Even if they stop liquidating inventory after this year they will survive. I believe with 60 mill debt paydown this year net debt assuming 60 mill in cash is 280 mill against 60 mill ebitda or 4.6 times in the depth of a depression. Assume in three years oil stabilizes if revenues stay at 1 billion and just a 10% ebitda margin that's 100 mill ebitda at 8 times whicjh is where the market will price it minus 280 mill in debt gives you 4.60 a share
bond restructuring announcent soon. catalyst coming...
"U guys remember when i said to buy peix 0,38 ,told me to get lost ,peix 2,58 now"
Forum Energy is up 41.18% to 0.47
$2 very soon..very strong fundamentals..debt reduction to 0%..strong cash flow..cost saving strategies..list goes on
$FET with international revenue increasing towards 1/3rd and North America rigs define..this stock is heading towards $5 with short term $2
Do your own DD.Ftsi is positioned financially a bit stronger.this looks interesting also...
"I am thinking whether to add more here. FET seems to be the only small company in the energy space that is trying to buy back it's debt for a nice discount. That shows 2 things. Management is opportunistic and taking advantage of the current bond market. Second, management is confident that their company will get through this when the dust settles."
Can it close at $1.+
fet will open .75 and going 2 00 wow!
"Optimistic, but .44 (50SMA) will be resistance, as it was back on march 9th and 13th. If that can be conquered then there's a gap to fill up to .55 from march 6th. supposed to be an earnings report soon, so who knows what that will do"
So is this gonna run like the other small oil co's..?? It sure feels like it
Perhaps the BOD are considering RS? This could help especially when demand increases in summer. Still long way to go. All the best FET!
why this is going up!!! what news we are missing?
Dman you think by open it will be too alate to get in ?
oil is $34 and fet?
FET is down 11.40% to 1.01
watching this thing fall is absolutely hilarious!
anyone have news on the delisting status?
"Another 52week low, 3.79 The best Christmas present ever!!!"
"bottom line on this stock is very simple, if you invested 100bucks you have 5remaining,,"
"They got Q4 SGA down to 56M, if we keep that pace for 2020, match 2019, Revenue we get Net Income of 18M with about 63M in Depreciation, Giving us operating cash flow of 81M in 2020. That doesnt take into consideration AR and Inventory paydowns. Albeit I am concerned about the quality of AR/Inventory left."
This company will soon be back at $5 before Q2 earnings
today close .46
Flying in AH
Anyone have a medium or long term thesis on the SP for this company?
This will show a sharp reversal to $2..this Is an equipment company...no direct loss due to low oil price..1-2 quarter of pain but due to Aramco buying lots of equipment it will improve..
