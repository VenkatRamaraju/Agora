Hedge Funds are playing with this stock. Don't be intimidated by the swing in price. Buy on the dips.
Capital senior living reached terms for lease termination of 7 communities leased from Ventas.
There will no upside in Reits until until 6% inflation returns
"Feb. 13th VTR filed a Form 4 showing that on 2/13 Debra Cafaro bought and sold 64,084 shares of VTR stock. Bought for $45 per sh., then sold for $64.0908. Nice large gain if you can do it. She probably had options on shares at $45."
"This should go back to around$57.00.........to be even for the year..........Income stocks bring ""income""........not growth."
"Remember this company runs nursing homes and elderly care centers. And if this virus hits one or more of their facilities, Katie bar the doors!"
"Well folks, we are up a long way from the bottom! Hope some of you were able to buy near the lows.Now, let's consider the dividend going forward. Wondering what some of you think would happen with the share price under the conditions listed below. I have my thoughts shown out to the side.* No change to the current dividend (Price goes over $50 by end of summer)* 30 to 50% dividend cut (Price falls 10 to 15% from here but still over $40 by end of summer)* Short term halt to the dividend (Price falls to 31 to 33 dollar range but recovers to 35 to 40 dollar range by end of summer)"
"Who is short VTR these days, here.VTR has been trending up since the low.looks like $60. is a magnet. (shorterm)Shorts keep covering higher."
Does anyone have information on the offering vtr filed today in an attempt to raise funds. Not happy it was filed day before ex-div date.
"Picked up a few shares today, how's it going to respond to earnings?"
"will this ever get back to 60 ask the guy that bought @ 57.50, 4100 shares LOL"
"Buy it as this will rotate up to $73-$75 in near term. Nice cash flow, reliable stock supported by strong healthcare clients."
"Why is this stock going nowhere? Was recommended to me and purchased, for $65.00 in 3/2014. I am starting to think the stock market is a scam on the little people by the 1% ers?"
"Analyst Actions: Jefferies Upgrades Ventas to Buy From Hold, Lifts Price Target to $68 From $62"
Hope nobody was counting on a big increase in the dividend. 0.3% increase. Anyone else surprised?
Vote on whether my sold $50Feb19 CC will be called.. I say yes..
anyone know what time is the earning tomorrow? thanks in advance
Folks... Why do you invest in the company??? The share price appreciation is not that great...
"Took a 1000 share position Friday. Think there is at least a 10% up move from here the next 12 months, but believe rising interest rates will hold stock appreciation down. That said, 16% a year is good money."
strong balance sheet is good they will come back
just bought in long. I like the chart. Pulling out of a nasty long term drop and it's now above the 50 day moving average.
Good time to buy
"Picking up some more tomorrow if it stays down or goes lower, fully expecting a dividend cut of around 30%. That would still yield over 8%."
"08:34 AM EST, 02/20/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Ventas (VTR), a real estate investment trust company, reported Q4 2019 normalized funds from operations (FFO) of $0.93 per share, compared with $0.96 a year ago. That beat the Capital IQ consensus forecast of $0.92.Revenue for the quarter was $996 million, up from $923.3 million. That beat the analysts' forecast of $977.9 million.The company said it expects normalized FFO for full-year 2020 of $3.56 to $3.69.The company noted that its Q4 2019 Normalized FFO per share included $0.01 of fees and a cash tax refund that will not carry over into 2020.Price: 60.00, Change: +0.83, Percent Change: +1.40"
nice day
"Man. I'm hoping my Feb 19th $50 CC is called so I can dump this dog, but I doubt it. That's OK, I'll just write another one a bit higher, and still got the $200 up front. Works for me..."
I'm guessing that leaving the dividend unchanged didn't help much with confidence ...
"Click bait led me to this story stock and I look at the books and notice that the div has actually declined 2017 but there is a capital gain included in reporting for the IRS on your tax form. And their site says the div is always on the increase and that would be a lie with part being not div but cap gains. I think this is a setup? But what do I know?Look at this transaction. I am no expert. But, they sold some nursing homes for $300 Million to make money and maybe to pay the div?Why sell a couple homes if you specialize and own 1200 medical businesses?I personally do not trust. Down $10 for the month. Invest at your own risk and do your own DD."
Opening up weak again this morning...rising interest rates ? disappointment in div increase ?...what ?
now is the time to get back in this one with a pull back as rates trend lower the hunt for yield is ex-div should be end of the month
Dividend is less than the reduced PPS. You will lose money if the trend over the past year continues.
Are Nursing homes finished? Will everyone just stay home and age at home? Is that possible? Has Coronavirus changed everything?
"I have own VTR cense 2004, bought for.22.50.Vtr has been good to me."
The swings on this stock makes zero sense to me
VTR is up 4.91% to 49.80
"The whole REIT sector is out of favor right now due to the perceived effect of future interest rate increases. Makes no difference whether VTR is affected by the rate increases or not. Perception is reality. The machines will continue to pounce on VTR until their algorithms tell them not to. If you are a long term investor, collect the divy and get paid to wait. Those who bought VTR looking to make a quick buck I suspect will feel more pain until the tide turns."
One years worth of dividends in one day. I like it.
bought some more today
Seems like a good investment for the next 10 years as demand from baby boomers steadily picks up.
Has anyone heard anything on the dividend?
Cafaro on CNBC Mad Money now !
VTR is up 4.94% to 62.07
"[Zacks]Zacks Equity Research,Zacks•July 27, 2018Ventas, Inc. VTR reported second-quarter 2018 normalized funds from operations (FFO) of $1.08 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02. The figure came in higher than the year-ago quarter tally of $1.06.Results reflected robust performance of its high quality portfolio.Ventas posted revenues of $942.3 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $918.7 million. Further, the revenue figure compares favorably with the year-ago number of $895.5 million."
I can see this falling to $45.00 after the div date..............Better wait imo.
I'm considering going short......this is the 2nd inning we are in.....with 20 million out of work...noway we get back to normal.
This selloff is overdone. Getting to be a cheap stock again.
Another day of the same old stuff. Continuous selling after noon today. The pattern repeats day after day....up in the morning and sells down reminder of the day. Can't remember the last time this closed near high of the day. Anyone have any thoughts on this price action?
yes
"Starting in 2020 the population of people over 80 will grow 4% per year. At same time US penetration rate of those who usually access Senior Housing is relatively low and could go higher. The combination of more Seniors over 80 and the percentage of those over 80 who sign up for Senior Housing could raise demand dramatically. Demand could be rising at the same time new Senior Housing starts are at a 9 year low. A new Senior Housing project takes 18 to 24 months to complete, so in 2 years time their could be a dramatic imbalance which could cause occupancy rates to rise significantly and pricing to at least be firm if not rise as well. It is pretty short sighted to sell this based on the over capacity that exists today and might last for a few quarters."
"Haha. Last ok back at the comments a couple months ago. Peter was spot on! Well, ok. Not even close. I hope he took his own advice and sold."
"Wow, what a gift below 50...FOR THE SHORTS !"
This is brutal
Dividend growth was 3.3% over last 5 years in a period when business was good and the stock was much higher. Now Dividend growth will be more like 1-2% because of modest dilution from options and higher interest rates. Earnings growth will be about the same. We are headed for 9x FFO that is a price in the 30's.
I just bot some after hours while watching Cramer interview the CEO on Mad Money. The dividend sound sustainable AND ITS OPTIONABLE!!!. This could be an income gem!
Sold off last year at 60+. Will get back in if it goes to 30s. Will put it in my Roth in drip mode and revisit EOY to re-balance if necessary. That's my plan.OH! Expect a div cut or two until finally 2.25/yr to maintain 6%. This is how it works.
Can someone explain why this keeps going down even on a good day? Isn’t a low yield on the 10 year a good thing for reits?
"just hold this one, the panic, while certainly not over, is now managed"
For how much longer will this continue to lose $$ ? Looks like my prediction of $45.00 could well be in the cards...........What do I know ? ;o)
why is vtr down today with Dow up 130 pts???
How are earnings ? Did they release
"Oh my, what is happening? Good results? Who could have expected that?"
"OK...the problem is defined and there are plenty of experienced managers, problem solvers and innovative thinkers in this huge organization. So, go to it and turn this short term issue around. You can offer customer incentives, unload the worst properties, advertise and market creatively, benchmark your best performers or competitors for best practices, assess you personnel and processes for improvements. Work the whole system and the performance will make things happen, DO NOT SIT IDLE AND PREPARE EXCUSES. This is when leaders and the future leaders are discovered."
Didn't they buy AthenaHealth today?
News on the dividend?
must have been a bad call?
I thought the earnings release was scheduled BEFORE the market opened today. 4/24/2020
Havent owned a reit for some time now anyone on this board know how the divis are taxed in a non roth account?
WoW...needs to hold right here..on a long term chart
VTR reached a new 52 Week Low at 56.84
"Rather disappointed and surprised to see Ventas increase their senior housing exposure with yesterday's announcement of the SNR merger. I was hoping to see them expand more in the medical office and research facility space for portfolio diversification. I don't think many hold VTR for the near-term performance outlook, but longer term, the demographics are certainly in its favor. The recent acquisition unfortunately, will probably push any hope for a dividend increase even further out into the future."
Good news for once...way overblown...reversal tomorrow.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/japanese-flu-drug-clearly-effective-in-treating-coronavirus-says-china
"As a new Shareholder I reviewed most recent financials to understand what negatives are impacting VTR stock. Two things stood out, FFO forecasted to drop slightly to $4.05 in 2018, still providing a nice coverage for the $3.16 dividend. The Senior Housing portion of the portfolio is forecasted to be soft due to new supply. Are these reasons cause for a 30% pullback over the last several months ?"
I purchased this as a long term investment....saying that makes me feel better...NOT!
"Not sure what's wrong with this stock.. Competitors, Peak and O are way up and this one's stuck. What gives?"
The number of COVID-19 infections in nursing homes has been severely under reported. Federal oversight and tracking is going to ramp up soon.https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/more-2-200-coronavirus-deaths-nursing-homes-federal-government-isn-n1181026
VTR reached a new 52 Week Low at 57.30
Is this divided sustainable?
"Barron's article, favorable. The Oct. 22nd issue of Barron's, page M5, has a very favorable short article on VTR, worth reading. Current price gives a yield of slightly over 5.5% and dividends have been increased by a small amount each year."
"No stock offerings in the last 2 quarters after $1.3B in 2016. They also paid down debt. Without raising new capital, they cannot grow. That game is over with the stock down and cost of capital way up. If VTR paid out all its cash flow, they could only raise the dividend 18%. The yield would be 6.8% with little or no futures growth. Past future growth for them has come from aggressive capital raising and acquisitions. If that is now over, which it should be, growth only comes from rent escalators, which are usually 1-2%. If all that comes to be, the stock will get revalued so the price reflects an 11-12% future return. That means the yield needs to be closer to 9%. That means a price of $40. The whole REIT sector is faced with this issue. VTR got particularly overvalued as investors thought the MOB business was open ended, not cyclical and safe. Not any more it seems."
Insider buying
"07/01/2020 - So far I'm quite right, I'm still looking at $40 by end of July and $50 by end of year. 2021 will be the recovery year when vaccine becomes and available followed by bring back the original dividend.It'd be an easy $60. Why invest in FANG stock, when you can get paid a good dividend while waiting for the recovery. Write OTM calls in the mean time to boost return, that's what I'm doing!"
"why did Yahoo mess up the portfolio part of their website? it is not an improvement, why do software people always want to changE and make things worse. If it isn't broken, DON'T FIX IT!!!"
One negative rating made this stock tank ?
if drop to $50 buy
"Vaccine development is going well. VTR will rise to $40 by end of month, and by $50 in July, and back above $60 by summer end. Glad that I bought. This is among the most undervalued stock out there, the customer base remains stronger than ever."
"Will Nursing Homes and Assisted Living be a thing of the past, post-Coronavirus?"
"I believe the drop in REIT share prices in general is due to the increase in the 10-yr yield. I am long, just hang in & collect my dividend. Good thing I am avg 60.24!"
"I had SNR which just got bought by VTR, so now I own VTR. I would think the acquisition would be good for VTR, but no one has said anything about it. I was planning on staying in SNR long term now thinking of selling since this one looks topped out."
"Love this in today's press release. Reduced interest on debt by 1.25%. Wow. ""The Company extended its maturity profile and managed interest rate risk via the issuance of $650 million of 3.00% Senior Notes due 2030, the proceeds of which were used to retire $600 million of 4.25% Senior Notes due 2022."""
When do the cut the divy ?
"Sold Short a lot of shares of VTR today at $53.88. This is a Pure Earnings Short Sell play. VTR reports earnings pre-market tomorrow, and I am expecting a major sell-off in response to disappointing and weak numbers. VTR is poised to collapse because she is significantly over-valued and faces past, present, and future Covid-related headwinds. Stock is close to a 52 week high for absolutely no valid reason. Top insiders of the company are selling their shares in recent weeks. Company Guided down in February. There is just no reason for the stock price to go up from these levels on this earnings release, barring absolute blow-out beats on both EPS and Revenue estimates, which is extremely unlikely. Will Cover tomorrow afternoon and feeling confident this will be my 7th winning trade in a row, all of them single day Pure Earnings Short Sells. Good Luck!"
"Came back to this board on 05/22/2020, overall markets down, VTR up +2.29% as of 3:44PM ET. Yup, just as I've said, Wallstreet is realizing what an idiot they all have been to have sold this stock and it's now they are trying to buy it back.People, just wait for the earning confirming solid FFO in Q2, then this stock will rocket past $45 in summer, as I've said, I'm eyeing return to $50+ by end of year.Nursing homes are the safest place to be, they are limiting visitation and control (but allow) social activities. Watch the senior citizens booking this place up like there is no tomorrow.As more people are heading out and bringing back potential virus, senior citizens no longer feel safe living with their own families or by themselves.Mark my words. This train is departing the station. Long VTR."
"debt is a lil high, great deividend tho. margin is a bit lower compared to other reits"
"I’m pretty sure we are going to need healthcare facilities 3,5, and 10 years from now as the boomers age and I don’t think people in care will give a darn what the 10 year t-note rate is at. These selloffs when rates perk up just puzzles me. Yes debt becomes a little more expensive, but rates are still low compared to historical standards."
"I've been an investor/trader in VTR for a few years. Overall, I've made some fat stacks. These prices are close to the original price I paid years ago. If I sold today, I would about break even on stock price but up big time on dividends and short term buy/sell. These prices, to me, as a long time follower, represent a buy - time to double or triple down. However, the concern is the overall market and sector in general. There is generally a sell-off and market correction mid Jan to mid Feb - we might see that again this year and the might be able to buy shares even cheaper at the end of Feb.But long term, this stock is a SOLID performer - and I see NOTHING to indicate differently despite the nay sayers. Yes, it wil have it ups and down - which stock doesn't?"
CNBC had Mr Wonderful on talking about Reits. He says inflation will kick in next year and last at least 3 years. Scared investors to get out of reits and utilities.
"Crazy thing is after going up 15% in one day, this is still undervalued."
What time does the end of day tank begin?
"Deb Cafaro is the best REIT CEO in America and her leadership team is equally impressive. It is time to add shares at this stock price given the dividend yield, the balance sheet strength, and their property locations!"
"Here's the most ridiculous thing ever: Wallstreet believes occupancy level will drop and yes it did drop, so the senior citizens moving back home with their families while the 20 year olds party and bring home the virus? Wouldn't it be smarter and much SAFER to be in a nursing home where it's much more well controlled with LIMITED visitation? Isn't that the safest place to be? Wallstreet has gotten this wrong and this stock, just announced $0.97 FFO/share will rocket back to to $40 by end of next month, and back above $60 by end of year in this 0% interest rate environment. If VTR doesn't cut dividend, we'll see this happen much sooner. Oh, and that doesn't include the possibility of arrival of vaccine. Anyone shorting this must hate money."
Buy at 57
"I do not own VTR, but I do own HCN. The ""new"" 4% senior unsecured notes offered today is a good financial move. Read the news release. This will push 2019 debt coming due into 2028 (I think). Doing this while interest rates are low. Good move. This may help to make a base for the stock."
Wait till Sept...thats when the sheet hits the fan......you will get these guys in the teens
What a lovely day
Approaching an 8 year low for stock price
What is going on with these reits. Bought all day today and Thursday. Just wondering whos selling? Closed end bund funds and mortgage reits selling way under book value too. Forced selling for over extended investors?
There is a Moody's report out 3 days ago on VTR. Worth reading.
Jan. 31st there is a 13G/A was filed. I'm not a lawyer. What is thie 13G/A all about? Good or bad?
Trump is going to announce the Stafford Emergency Act for the country in the next 48 hours. GL people.
it keeps running maybe back to $91macro environment is once again positive for select income producing REITs & MLP's
"Looks good. Sounds good.If the divy remains the same or is increased, either way this is going back pre-plandemic."
Is VTR keeping the current dividend?Did they declare the n earnings report?
Dividend hike to be announced tomorrow Dec. 8th (well last yr. it was done on this date).
All other REITs up today except VTR.
"Why all this sell off? VTR should be declaring the new Dividend rate soon, my guess is this Friday.Stock at a low, buy now, avoid the rush."
Declared full dividend.
"VTR is grossly overpriced. They must continually issue new stock and debt for capex. When the well drys up, they can no longer grow the dividend. Now that the stock is down somewhat, and if they have another stock offering, it begins to dilute. The stock should be selling at 12x EBITDA and is selling at 17.5x. It is the whole REIT sector driven up by the thirst for yield which is now reversing. If you can sell it, do so and come back at $40."
Ceo is on Cramer tonight. Can’t wait to hear what she has to say.
nice up 10% I wanna see what happens after number are ouy
"Another quarter of no growth. NAREIT FFO per share was $0.98 compared to $1.04 in the same period in 2017. Guidance weak. Thye say they delivered strong earnings. Are these strong? Income from continuing operations per share was $0.37 compared to $0.42 in the same period in 2017. Their statements are not reliable. They may have hit a wall on MOB's. The stock is just too expensive for low/no growth. 17x EBITDA and should be 10X. If they paid out all FFO, the yield would only be 6.8% with zero growth. Stock is 25% overpriced and with rates about ready to go up it may come sooner than later."
Today the Healthcare REIT sector is down even though the ten year t note rate is down. I can’t find any news and earnings season is over. How do these trade in concert if one another? Is it program trading? It’s as if 50 mutual fund companies had a conference call at 7 am and said “sell this category today”.
I really like this stock. The cost vs yield is compelling. At this price in 15-years assuming no dividend hikes (or cuts) your cost basis will be effectively zero. This is how you make money in the stock market. Buy quality companies that are out of favor and get paid 6% while you wait.
I've got wood
"ONE hour and six minutes left in the trading day, when does the sell off begin?"
vtr is on solid ground. very minimal exposure to medicare/medicaid. they seem to be in the right markets where there is limited supply /new construction. stay the course long.
Just saw that Todd Lillibridge will be leaving his former leadership role with the company. He has a solid reputation with the health care customer base. Has his replacement been named and how might this change affect the company’s future share price?
Debra sells another 15K shares from options with another year and a half of exercise period left.
"Zacks stock analysis paper title is misleading. According to Zacks, everything is beating. Why the stock down?"
"Boomer stock, demand for their services and facilities will only climb over the next 10-15 years as medical needs increase. Slow LT growth"
"I’m just a simpleton but for diversification this works. Birth, pharma, food, financials, weapons, robotics, physical goods trading platforms, metals, music and ageing. Just like one of the Gillette family said to a family youngster “make something people need every day”. In my case “that none of us can really avoid”."
stock clearly went down today because the coronavirus deaths in Washington state were in a long term care facility.
Must be bad news coming. Dividend cut.
VTR reached a new 52 Week Low at 57.90
Technically...this baby is hanging by a hair.....if if breaks this level basically right here........its a long ways down
Just going to hold and but more.
Debra files a 10b5 plan and sells 30K shares. This may mean she will be dumping more shares each month.
Time to buy! 6 months from now you will see why
"Temporary dividend cut and still yield is pretty nice, Im ok with this."
Check out stag.. monthly dividends.. love it.. stock on sale..
Yeah
Anyone thinking of nibbling on some VTR yet? In the low 40's it will start to look appealing.
Still sitting at $24 from back in March 2020...
"I was planning to buy a load at this price ""after"" the div..........Looks like I'll get the div AND my price"
"Part of the investment thesis was more coverage through ACA. Now with the mandate gone, insurance signups will revert to emergency rooms and the newer revival of the doc in a box model. Medicaid will pay for both at very low rates. Medical Office buildings which makes up the bulk of VTR's portfolio will experience slack demand vs ACA hysteria two years ago. The sellers of MOB's look smart right now. I suspect VTR will pull back all capex. While they have a good portfolio of properities, the valuation is way to high. We should look at this as total return vehicle with a current yield of 5.4% and 4% growth--maybe. That 9.4% total return is too low so they either have to grow faster or the current yield must be higher. The yield gets higher by the price of the stock declining."
With a 200 plus payout ratio how will dividend be safe
Been waiting to buy. Down from $68+. How greedy will the almost 8 mil shares short be. Buying now!
"Several insiders/officers/directors bought in the past few days at 33.18, which is a positiveindicator that the stock is oversold."
The only downside to this big run up is that my dividends are going to reinvest at higher prices. I was hoping this would still be below 40 come div time.
Ventas donates 9 million...stop giving away shareholder money....
"I have a cost basis of $28.20, so I should be happy. But I really wanted to pick up some more for under 30."
Anyone hear news of the dividend?
Sure seems like Ventas would want to buy MPW. Accretive and both stocks would probably go up. :-)
Another round for cheap Ventas stock
"VTR finally getting some positive moves. You can't keep a good stock down. Still not too late to buy, buy, buy."
"VTR FFO normalized growth rate over the last 3 years per share is -7%FFO per share was $4.47 in 2015, $4.13 in 2016, and $4.16 in 2017. So far this year, FFO is up 1.7% on a per share. These figures are from the 2017 10K and 2018 10Q. While we hear a lot about FFO rising, VTR has a history of equity offerings thus diluting FFO/shr. The payout ratio on FFO is 84%. Therefore dividend increases from here will be very modest, approximately 1.7% per year. They can start having equity offerings again with debt but that just diklutes FFO/shr. That worked fine when the stock was 20x FFO and debt was cheap. So the total return is 7% from dividends and FFO per share growth. I am not satisfied with that given the risk of share price declines from rising interest rates. It seems to me the yield should be 9% with 1.7% growth. That puts the stock at $40. That is a dramatic drop, but not unrealistic. This is true for the whole REIT complex. Tell me where I am wrong."
".45/dividend is intact for another quarter. Good news, I suppose. Once a vaccine is out and things stabilize, I would hope we'd start to see some dividend increases within another year or two."
Inching closer to a 6% yield....any takers?
"The board gives themselves free stock and pay increases, but we shareholders don't get the normal div. Hogs."
"Dividend increase of 6 cents/yearly was a big disappointment. I expected at least 2 cents/quarter, or 8 cents yearly."
Sorry...chart says 48.00
When are Earnings?!?
SERIOUSLY...MAX CHART SAYS ...32.80
"OMG- Good article in Seeking Alpha, everything else in my watchlist is in the green, 6% div and this thing can'tgo up ???? Sold for a loss. F the dividend."
Are many REITs going bankrupt? Seems so.
Where is the bottom price???
"Lots of revenue, little earnings. Was a hot stock less than 6 mo. ago, selling at $65/share, when my broker told me that we all end up in a facility at some point. Wall Street is a fickle mistress? We need more of you rich people to get old and have your kids put you in a facility so I can make money? LOL"
"I have been in this stock for 3 years now at the suggestion of my Edward Jones advisor. I have invested $17000.00 and with all the dividends, I am up only $120. I will be exiting soon and no longer use Edward Jones. Very poor return on my money."
Nice pop at end of day. Helped me end the day green!
Bought 4100 shares at 57.50 thank you!
Down almost 20% in one quarter and dividend of 79 cents gets paid today. Totally a bad time to have held ventas.
hmmm. maybe my sold 15Jan$50CC won't be called after all.. %^ 0
"MPW, earnings came out this morning and it appears earnings are impressive. MPW has a beautiful bullish chart."
May go positive by close.
VTR held up very well in a bad market today. Wondering if all the sellers have cashed out. Big tech took a beating today while it seems that many of the out of favor stocks fell very little. Still think that $50 is very likely for VTR by year end. They should be able to support the current dividend pay out.
Happy to have loaded up in the $58s.
"It's times like these you reinvest the dividends and let compounding work it's magic. I don't currently have a position in VTR, but do in competitor HCP so I'm experiencing much of the same as holders here. If VTR somehow drops under $50, I'll be taking a fairly significant position (about 5% of investable assets). Time will tell. Good luck VTR longs."
Hmmm did I miss something that is causing this to tank today? Was ceo busted gangbanging a bus load of midgets? Earnings looked solid
"Announced around 12-10-18, dividend increased by 1 cent, or 1/4 cent each quarter. Pretty cheap of them. They give themselves big raises and stock options and we loyal share owners get a crumb. These people will want your vote next year to vote them on the board of directors, so remember the 1/4 penny you get each quarter."
Get ready for a surprise
"Ventas looks to be conservative in guidance probably reason for short term pullback today... Given challenging senior housing market conditions, our senior housing operating portfolio did not perform consistent with historical patterns or our expectations in the quarter, a trend we expect to continue for the balance of the year. As a result, while national leading indicators of supply and demand in the senior housing sector continue to improve, giving us confidence in the powerful upside that lies ahead, we have reduced our 2019 property level guidance for our senior housing operating business. This changed expectation leads us to conclude that our return to enterprise growth will occur after 2020."
"I'd say, today is last chance to get on board before this train leaves town and head to $40 in a month, $50 by summer, certainly back to $60 in 2021. Easy 2x money in 12 months. I'm buying REITs all day long, UDR, MAA, AVB, BXP, HST, VTR, chance of a lifetime."
"dang, sure glad I bought last week!"
Don't you love how the Big Hedge Fund guys jumped back in at the End of Day ?
"I shall purchase more share @$53.30, a hair shy of 6% div yield. That is still slightly above the 5 yr. blended average(3 yr trailing, 2 yr. projection) P/FFO...."
The dividend is over 10%
"I think this is a value stock you buy today, collect your dividends and wait for the big upturn on healthcare real estate that will be brought on by the aging baby boomers. It’s the calm before the storm."

Even more brutal today. Wow under $30 now
nice week
Glad I bought at $23.50
Why will the share price drop to $59?
I always thought VTR was a blue chip and safe harbor in Rocky times?
"Feeling pretty comfortable about VTR. The long term trends pre-pandemic haven't changed. VTR's business probably takes a year or so to fully normalize, but I expect it'll be tough to add capacity to VTR's core markets because demand for home building and the like will compete for those resources. Which aids VTR and the stronger players. My guess is by mid-next year, we're looking at a $3+ annual dividend and a $70+ share price"
"We have entered grossly overpriced again. The 30 year treasaury is down to 3% and REITS have rallied strongly. The index is selling at 15.5x EBITDA, near its high. VTR is 17.2x EBITDA but has stopped growing. The 5.3% yield is no longer interesting. IF inflation returns as I suspect, REITS will get crushed as rates rise. Plot interest rates alongside VTR and you will see the coralation. Rates rise, VTR falls. Long Tresaury yields should be 7%, Since the stock is up, they will have another stock offering like the old days. On a per share basis this does not help us. I am selling and will come back another day."
"The growth of senior housing is coming due to the aging baby boomers, but what do you think is the time frame? The oldest baby boomers are 72 this year. Could it be 5-7 years away still or is 73,74 and 75 ages that people start to need care in high enough numbers to raise occupancy rates? Obviously in 8 years when baby boomers are turning 80 this industry will be thriving, but that’s still quite a ways off. Would like everyone’s input please."
At least it can't go below $0!
Insiders continue to buy!
VTR is bringing down the whole Reits sector before earnings tomorrow. Insiders must be hinting to their friends.
bad day for vtr. might revisit march low
"Another 25% intra day price swing today 3/20/2020. This should really be looked into. I don't own any VTR, just an observation."
No dividend increases until 1) earnings stabilize 2) covid 19 is not seen as a senior housing issue 3) Covid 19 not seen as acute care issue. Let's hope there is no dividend cut.
What about the dividend?
Opportunity at hand.
I'm loving buying here below $59.
No new posts--equals all the hot money is gone.No need to manipulate their fellow retail investor.Maybe the confident short can chime in.VTR has held up nicely.
Why the big drop today? News?
Odd that were down a $1 this morning. I’m adding more here’s
GLPI is an excellent REIT in the Leisure and entertainment business with triple net leases with guranteed income from it's tenantsYielding over 7 percent now and they just raised their dividend again from 63 cents to 68 cents don't miss out on this one. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4235060-gaming-leisure-properties-brief-synopsis
back to 2011 level
If new starts are at a 9 year low and it takes 18 months to 24 months to complete a new senior Housing project and demand fills up new space in the next year what do you think the SHOP portfolio will experience in 2 years? I’m willing to wait and hold and collect the 5% dividend and see what happens. At $73 this was over valued but at $64 it is a pretty good value with the potential of SHOP and the steady eddy NNN leases and the MOB and the R&I portions of the portfolio providing ballast.
Will we get another 1 penny per year dividend increase?
"Revenue over $1B, record, no dividend cut, FFO $0.97/share, just shy of 2 cents from March 2019 quarter. Yet stock dropped 50%. Yeah, this price won't last long, I'm buying another 200 shares at open."
Why was it halted today?
do people not understand the death rate has plummeted! and they are making no distinction between cases!?
IMHO ... priceTarget must be changed ASAP! Be in 7th heaven.
Unable to trade and sell the gain on Schwab right now.
Finally! 1st qtr dividend announcement today. Payable 4/14 to holders of record 4/1. $.7925/share.
Great reit
This REIT is going lower. If they paid out all cash flow it would yields 6.9%. Any growth has come from huge stock offerings --$1B in the last year alone. Income is fixed because leases do not adjust. Should be selling around $45.
"what's going on with VTR?? end of year selling, tax bill changes,. what??"
"Will take a hit on March 21st when Fed raises interests rates. Dividend is not that great for a REIT. Most REIT 8-9% range, so price needs to come down to $43 to be fair value"
Senate bill says companies that take the relief loan/grant cant pay a dividend. How stron is VTR's balance sheet and cash pile?
steady growth and remember that VTR is in property business - this will fly when inflation kicks in
Will this ever get back to 60?
"The price when you sell is what matters. Lower prices in between when you bought and when you sell are just part of the game. Too many investors these days need instant gratification to confirm their investments are OK. VTR is going to be OK. Just wait for it. That is something people in this world don’t do well anymore. Patience and waiting for something to work is a trait that has been lost. We would be better off most of the time if we would buy something high quality at a low relative price (like VTR) regardless of what the short term momentum chasers are doing and saying and just bury it and forget about it. Then dig it up in 10 years. Forget about what happens in between. You would be surprised at how wrong the momentum chasers are most of the time about the long term. I get criticized for this philosophy as being too simple and too naive. I am told investing is much harder than that. Well it works for me. (Definitely not every time, but if I apply it consistently then it works enough to give me overall success). And so many people make it so much harder than they need to. It really isn’t that hard. Low prices of high quality assets lead to high future returns. High prices of those same assets lead to low future returns. Low prices of relatively good assets present opportunity for high future returns. So welcome this disconnect between value and price. Only care about price when it is time to sell. If my time horizon is 10 years or more the price today doesn’t matter. It only tells me if I should be a buyer or a seller."
Hoping VTR goes down to around $30. Huge purchase for me if it does
VTR reached a new 52 Week Low at 50.08
I've bought VTR four times this week and will continue buying next week and beyond until it turns upward. This is a gem company and way oversold by the big institutions. Love the income this stock will provide my retirement.
It's a great day to have more than 2000 shares of VTR !!
"Regarding the new launch, spin off, whatever they want to call the Limited Partnership they just announced as complete.One analyst says the ""contribution of sites (facilities) to the new partnership will cost earnings decrease of $.02/qtr."" Ventas receives $0.6B in cash to payoff debt. They now own 20% of the new LP Fund. What does this mean for VTR stockholders? Debbie says it will help us. Any thoughts? Does any of the LP income trickle back to VTR holders with accompanying accounting nightmares of LP reporting?"
"Ventas stock has recovered nearly all of its pandemic related capital loss and continue to move towards $60 per share. The company appears to have weathered the pansemic issues imopacting its stock, however it has not adjusted its dividend given the return to nearly full valuation. The stock was very ayttractive with a yield of 6% when I purchased it, however the current yield of 3% makes me question if it is safe to continue to hold. I would think that management would be feeling the pressure to reinstate the full dividend to keep sharehoulders from bailing out. I have already liquidated 35% of my holdings after making a nice 59% return on the cheap post pandemic crash shares I purchased in the 20s and 30s. Bottom line, for longs focusesd on dividend income with possibly better options, is Ventas still a hold?"
What's wrong with this stock?
"05/26/2020 - VTR jumped 5.43% today to close at $35.54. Mark my words, by end of summer, this will be well above $50 and back to $60 by year end. The next earning will show that. VTR dropping 50%? Come on, did half of the senior citizens check out already so that FFO is reduced by half? I call BS."
This stock should hold up well in a recession.
"https://www.ventasreit.com/sites/default/files/company_presentations/Q12020Results_COVID-19_Update.pdfGoing through the report, I do not see anything that justifies a 50% drop in share price. Long-term investors, keep your shares, collect the dividends. Vaccine is coming and this stock will double, easy in a quarter."
Looks like a good buy at these levels.
This is why it is down:Analyst Actions: Raymond James Downgrades Ventas to Underperform From Market Perform
VTR reached a new 52 Week Low at 52.25
"Price target, $40 in summer, $50 end of year and fully recovered within a year from today. Mark my words. I just picked up a few more shares of UDR today to complement VTR. NEVER let a crisis go wasted. While rest of people are shopping on Amazon buying junk that they don't need or hoarding up 5 years of toilet paper (stupidity beyond words), I'm shopping on Wallstreet buying quality stocks to keep for lifetime."
Nice q report. Improved 2018 guidence.
"Sadly, Socialist ideologues actually run our Congress now."
New one year low today. My target is $42. Still has way to go. Fundamentals are not getting better and higher interest rates are awful for them
"VTR is a slow grower, but will grow and boost dividends."
"Concur with fellow Bulls on this one. View this as strong, steady dividends and future room for growth. Typically a low volatility play for one's hard earned money in a highly volatile and limited options for those craving lower risk, steady, decent yield/income. Should be considerable upward movement into this stock as the rotation will continue to occur in the markets."
Good day for VTR and other healthcare REITs especially compared to the overall market. I hope this is a start to the rotation to value investing.
Why such a premium stock price to comparable companies based on about all financial measurements?
"Watch this stock jump when VTR announces its dividend increase. Under priced now, will move up."
What's with all the spam.................
"Shouldn't the full dividend have been mostly restored by now? There are rules on div. payouts based on earnings. I haven't done the math yet, but it sure feels like there should have been upward movement by now."
"Forecasting down earnings and down FFO for 2018. There was no growth in 2017 either. They have overpaid for many MOB acquistions. At $48 it still seems overpriced and the whole REIT sector will continue to get crushed as rates rise. Could be interesting at $40 where it is headed. At that price the yield is 7.9% and with 3% growth, total return is 11%. They can no longer raise the dividend. If thwy decide to have stock offering to pay down debt, the stock will be crushed."
Brad Thomas is drowning in the Ventas moat !He's deep underwater. Somebody save him !
When is X-div date.........??The 29th ? Why if the record date is 4/4/2018 ? Seems to me it should be on 4/2/2018 ???
Why does this stock always close at the low of the day? Moves up in the morning and just like clockwork bleeds down into the close!
In the last 5 years no lower than 47...it's a bargain here. .let the shorts get caught...it will be fun to sqeeze
Agree good for income and longtime
I have some insight in to this world. One thing folks need to realize...uptakes will be impeded for min. 6 months.....and costs are going way up.
Is this a good dividend to buy
"Overvalued, Rising rates, the new Tax Law, everything is wrong here."
I’d like to see a dividend increase... what is stopping them at this point?
"Well, sure didn't take long for sellers to show up today at $60 plus!"
