ARI is down 9.86% to 12.34
Apollo Commercial Real is up 5.90% to 9.15
Nice dividends
I'm in at $18.70 today.
"where's the divi announcement? last year, it was 12/12. very strange."
hoping for a strong ec tomorrow. I hope Apollo fairs better than my other REITs stocks have this quarter.
will jared default on this loan?
"Look at the tenants in Manhattan, they are not going anywhere. The dividend may drop another 10 % or so, do the math, this will crawl back to the mid teens, it's a no-brainer, I added to my position this am."
"The main concern here is that the retail and commericial real estate is crashing and not returning as to how we have seen it in the past. Tenants are already calling for rent reductions from landlords, which is not a favorable situation. My personal feeling is 50% of small businesses will not reopen. SBA Loan money is based on the businesses hiring back employees. the only problem is that in a higher than most people realize the former employees are being paid more to stay home than to work.Why would you go back, take a pay cut and be on payroll for a small business that is no more than flip a coin to survive? I would not take that risk. I would wait to see what reopens and apply to the survivors."
waiting for a great dip.....
Down only a mere 18 cents after earnings. This is a very positive start to better things.
"Tanking again . Volume or no volume , this is going down every strong up market day . Under 5 by November at this rate."
"First time we are getting exposed to specific Geographic risk of the U.S. 34% of properties are in New York, New York. 20%U.K. and 9% in other areas of Europe. Much of this hotels. This virus will pass but there are some unique near term challenges. Doesn't mean however that contracts are canceled. I expect this back to $10-12 with a divy cut. Look past 6 months."
Why the drop? Seemed like earnings were in line with expectations unless I missed something. Feels like a buying opportunity to lock in a nice yield (close to 10% at these prices)
"in 2015, ARI was at $17....with 1/2 the revenue and EBITDA. Do you think this will really stay this low? Come on."
ARI is down 8.93% to 8.26
Apollo Commercial Real reached a 52 Week low at 15.63
"The best stock to own out of the 2008 downturn was “General Growth Properties” - it looks that the best thing to own out of the 2020 downturn is Commercial Real Estate. Lease costs will be up 30% YOY this time next year when the election and COVID are behind us. Buy this stock and never look back. At these levels I am going all in!!! See you at the finish line, good luck!"
happy day
Rain or shine this is worth $13-$14/share...any day MM
Somethings not right. ARI has been underperforming other commercial REITs. Should have jumped to CIM.
"Why the big downturn? News? Down almost double the div? I was looking for an entry point but when I don't understand the drop, I'm avoiding."
Apollo Commercial Real is up 4.97% to 9.09
I don't see why I wouldn't drop 50grand in this and forget about it if I just bought my dream car.
"anybody have any idea on the pre-market price that Yahoo has posted, down $0.66?"
Does ARI move up above $16/s in 2021? Thoughts...
They are merging with another company. Good stuff
"A little birdie told me that there are issues with the tenants in Manhattan, currently looking at different debt strategies to get over the hump. It would be prudent to keep a close eye on all SEC filings."
Do they miss December earnings and divident?
CIM declares 0.30 divvy. We are next.
"“Despite continued economic uncertainty, ARI had another solid quarter, producing operating earnings that covered the $0.35 per share quarterly dividend,” said Stuart Rothstein, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company. “Importantly, ARI achieved these results while maintaining a defensive capital position, ending the quarter with $450 million of liquidity after opportunistically using some excess liquidity to repurchase common stock. To date, ARI has repurchased $119.2 million of common stock at a price which is accretive to both operating earnings and book value per share.”"
"what is pulling this down, with a good earnings report? plus stock buy back?"
ARI is down 4.97% to 15.86
I like Apollo at $17 please! It's obvious where it's going.
ARI is down 8.68% to 7.74
"Everyone is staying safe and WFH, commercial real estate will crash and many will go bankrupt."
Another monster secondary offering - Apollo gets greedy 2x in 12 months
Why has this dropped more than Airline stocks ??
Waiting for good earnings
"Why is this stock price so low? BV is 16.10, and had profits the past two quarters? I guess more opportunity for me..."
ARI-PC reached a new All Time Low at $24.54
"Dividend .35 this quarter, still a great rate, adding shares."
ARI is up 5.00% to 15.12
Decent report. They sold some NY stuff at par. Dividend looks safe. Trading under book. Great deal until about 16.
ARI is down 7.40% to 15.14
Well sold half 1000 shares hope no add if cut dividend.
ARI is up 27.12% to 5.39

low volume no sellers.
ARI is down 4.95% to 13.84
ARI Stock under selling pressure . Support at 7.50 - 8.00. Market correction will bring it to that level.
Time to start trading/accumulating.
"Probably one of the best managed REITS out there.Was initially thinking to sell it, but no, i will rather sell KBWY and buy more here."
Wondering if they will cut the dividend next quarter?
Life is good with Apollo!
Maybe we get to keep divi?
looks like Apollo is surging on people receiving first rounds of covid-19 vaccine.
Apollo Commercial Real is up 5.06% to 9.14
"I do not think, but I'm not sure, interest rate hikes are good for any real estate Reit"
Going down daily on even strong Market days . Will wait to buy at under 8.
Absolute awesome performance in this stock the last week and no one is here and no one is talking about it. Perfect! Long and strong from the mid $6's.
"9.25 is the new 15.Long time holder here, ARI has agile management, if things get worse , they will adjust."
new to ari . looks like a great investment for div returns even growth long haul ? longs opinions ?
"a better overall choice than a commercial bank...for real estate loans. Banks cant act quickly, and, have too mant Fed overdight to perform as ARI, ABR, BRMK. Bett er total return without Bank's baggage!!! LONG ABR"
ARI is down 20.92% to 7.07
Why suddenly ipo 120000000 shares
"Patience, patience, the illiterate money chasing suits are coming to buy high soon."
looking for that descent dip today. Live this company. Another excellent one to buy on the dips and okay divided is Simon property (SPG).Looking to buy more of those after I sold with the 20% jump on Monday with vaccine news.
"the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.35 per share of common stock, which is payable on October 15, 2021 to common stockholders of record on September 30, 2021."
They will pay the divi again This is due to run hard Nice ER
"The slaughter of the Innocents. Best managed REIT out there. Something is going down in Manhattan, and the retail investor will be the last to know."
"That letter to shareholders this morning is a joke. Didn’t say anything about future dividends. I’m holding, but getting disappointed already. This is turning into a POS quickly"
I small a divi cut .. I’m out
"... Holding its ground nicely . Now we just need another Fed Stimulus to drive ARI over 12 . Also , the Company did mention in the conference call that they will look to Capitalize on opportunity caused by the Fallout from Covid . I imagine they will look to Expand their Loan Portfolio ."
Does anyone know what happened to the dividend today?
News leak . Big drop without press release .
"Just sharing a theoretical idea to spark conversation; There's really no doubt that in the wake of current events many companies will increase work from home headcount enabling them to recover some value by reducing operating expenses. But will this be a boon or a bust for REITs? Let's say for example ARI holds an asset that's currently enabling 5 tenants to house 100 employees each. Now let's say the average headcount is reduced 20% (again, purely theoretical). How likely is this to promote further division of leased space so that now this same space is hosting 6 businesses at a headcount of 80 each and thereby increasing the potential to increase revenue for REIT's like ARI?I know next to nothing about office space leasing and trends so just throwing the ball out there hoping for a more refined perspective and perhaps some historical analogies."
excellent day for Apollo. Loving it.....
If they shoulda they woulda!! I'm talking about a dividend cut. Absolute gem here!
keeps trying and fails to go up.
I commend the CEO of this company for communicating with the Stock holders with a letter to clarify and put some issues and concerns at ease. This is rare and appreciated very much. Hopefully the irrationally price of the stock will recover to levels it should be at.12-16
ARI is down 11.04% to 6.61
ARI is down 10.26% to 5.59
"the moment one wants to like these guys, they find another way to dilute and smack down their shareholders. it get annoying after a while."
Getting ready to buy a boatload. Stock/mkt not ready yet. Look at DRE 2008. This is not advice. This is only an opnion.
ARI is up 20.85% to 7.22
some buyers for 15% dividend maybe?
Back in Monday.
how will no dividend effect the price?
Cut dividends?
hope everyone is bought in for the divided date today. Still a long on this solid company. Also love Simon property group (SPG).
The management at ARI have strong foundation and strategy. I have faith in this team.
Friday and up is a new trend?
ARI is up 4.91% to 17.00
Did I mention 15% dividend??? earnings? $.39?
They're gonna take a HUGE hit on the next report. EPS will be $0.02 due to COVID and they'll drop the div to $0.05 and they'll STILL be signing their own death certificate by continuing to pay out more than they make.
"NEW YORK, July 08, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. (the “Company” or “ARI”) (NYSE:ARI), today announced the Company will hold a conference call to review its second quarter 2021 financial results on Tuesday, July 27, 2021 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The Company’s second quarter 2021 financial results will be released after the market closes on Monday, July 26, 2021. During the conference call, Company officers will review second quarter 2021 performance, discuss recent events and conduct a question-and-answer period."
So who can explain: Why the 10% sell-off or price adjustment alongside the 10% dividend payout? What's the point of receiving a dividend if you lose principle value by the same amount? I thought DIVs were supposed to benefit stockholders (rather than just sitting in company cash bank accounts).
$13 a share by next Friday is in the cards folks!
Does anybody know how the additional issuance of shares will affect the dividends payout and company’s ability to maintain dividend levels?
volume is moving up a bit. positive sign?
"I'm still watching, not sure I want this REIT."
zack's report overlooks the $.35 dividend is based on 90% REITs required payout. earnings should be $.40... about???
DO NOT SELL UNLESS IT'S LIMIT ORDER ABOVE THE BID PRICE!!!
Anyone Invested here believe ARI can make it to 11 by end of December ?
"Outlook, Changed To Negative From Stable. The negative outlook indicates that a ratings upgrade is unlikely over the next 12-18 months. As of 31 December 2019, the company's exposure to the hospitality and retail sectors was a relatively high 36% of total loans (26% for hotels and 10% for retail) ~Moody's"
EC tomorrow. Expecting good numbers.  If so be prepared to see $16ps. IMO
"Ok, I admit I freaked out a little bid over the price drop. Now I see I was incorrect in my estimate. Good I didn’t sell."
ARI is up 6.09% to 12.01
Insider selling is a problem. 6/10
"If economic conditions deteriorate further , Expect another Dividend cut . The stock price may react positively to a Dividend cut."
5 million shares traded in after hours today. Seems very unusual . Someone wants a nice dividend payout??
Friday slight up volume and price 2 weeks in a row.
"I am thinking about buying 2300 shares. I bealive this a good buy however I am going to wait until the end of the election. ARI had another solid quarter, producing operating earnings that covered the $0.35 per share quarterly dividend,” said Stuart Rothstein, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company. My main fear though is if they cut their dividend. If anyone wants to start a discord about stock information let me know and I can create a server."
"Lower rates will hurt them. Marc Lichtenfeld of Oxford Income Letter wrote an article about Apollo RE which is a subsidiary of Apollo Global Mgt. All new loans originated were floating rate loans. Which means as rates rise, so will the interest Apollo earns on the note. 93% of the company's portfolio is made up of these floating rate loans."
volume is dropping ...
Great earnings release will be up bigLY come 2021
"....There is suppose to be an expected onslaught of defaults in Commercial Real Estate. I wonder how much exposure ARI has , and the effect on the share price this will cause ."
"So, You're making $.40/yr and paying out $1.40.. How is that sustainable in real estate?"
ARI is down 5.12% to 15.58
"They took 183M CECL charge this quarter, hopefully that is pessimistic."
Proud now it’s time to step the game up and show u how this is suppose to go
I am glad to see ARI bought back almost 3 pct of the float in Q2. That is the best way to show trust in their portfolio and dividend. What is better than buy back your debt at 45 pct discount? The hit here is on the owners to collect rents . They hold a mortgage in 90 pct of the portfolio. You can distrust and sell you stock now with a discount value or wait it to trade at book value. I say 3q buy back will be huge. It’s a no brainer. Eventually they will reduce the float until make it private. This worth 14 usd anytime.
Can anyone explain a drop of this magnitude? I get that with rates dropping there will be a ton of refinancing but what about prepayment penalizes and lower cost of funds? Not to mention that some borrowers may not have the financial strength to refinance. is there a fear of default and if so what about the collateral? Don't they also have some hedges to protect against rate drops? Just struggling to comprehend.
"Unless there's a reduction of more than 10% in the dividend, it would be foolish to use this stock as a speculative investment. Buy and hold for the medium term (2 years minimum)"
"Well, we dropped nearly as much as the dividend today."
Apollo Commercial Real is up 6.69% to 11.64
why is this up 4% in pre-market?
this company is just too stable...
Other REIT'S have cut their dividend I wonder if ARI will follow suit.
What is BV. when in Commercial Real Estate value declining
Great dividend!
hello ........?
Why the big increase in A/R ($965M y-o-y) when revenues are not growing at a commiserate rate? This is what is eating their cash....
Very decent report!
If this dividend (.35) rises to $.40 stock. should go to $16.00?
Zacks has ARI @ strong buy we should see blue skies soon!
still waiting.......
"In sync, I love it... Soon an upgrade to $14 is to come and us longs will be rewarded"
"The head APOLLO company, I mean."
The question is ..... why is ARI trading higher than IVR ??? Both are REITS.
IMHO this is the best managed REIT in the market. This storm will pass and this one will come out on top.
Bought in the $6's a bit over a month ago. Punched out in the $11's a week and a half ago. Looking to re-enter. BEST REIT no one is talking about.
"Looking back to 2015, they have consistently cut the dividend. Any explanation as to why?"
Should see a nice pop tomorrow
"up 4% midweek no news, volume up a little too."
"Hmm... You buy for 0.35 divy, thing drops by $1. Better sell pre-ex-div, buy back at discount, wait till next Q, repeat."
"NEW YORK, March 16, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. (the “Company”) (NYSE:ARI) today announced the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.35 per share of common stock, which is payable on April 15, 2021 to common stockholders of record on March 31, 2021. "
ARI reached an all time low at 7.51
ARI has a good management team and is coming back nicely. $19/s would be nice!
"slow, but worthy recovery. Looking forward to 19$+ eventually."
"volume up price up, must be Monday."
Dumped everything today. Doesn't look like this fund will survive.
"Been in and out of ARI for around 10 years. never lost so much as a dime, and could have made nothing but more.I have no complaints."
How about a public offering?
big comeback before earnings?
We are going down - abandon ship!
Dividend declared $0.35/shareForward yield 15.18%ex-div Sept. 29
"For the second quarter of 2021, net income available to common stockholders per diluted share of common stock was $0.42 and Distributable Earnings (a non-GAAP financial measure defined below) and Distributable Earnings prior to realized losses and impairments on real estate owned and investments were $0.27 and $0.41 per share of common stock, respectively.Commenting on the financial results, Stuart Rothstein, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company said: “ARI had an active and successful first half of 2021, committing to over $1.4 billion of transactions in the United States and Western Europe. We remained focused on efficient capital deployment, as we funded a portion of our robust pipeline with the capital generated from $553 million of loan repayments. In addition, ARI continued to diversify the Company’s capital sources and strengthen the balance sheet with the completion of an eight-year debut $500 million 4.625% senior secured notes offering.”"
Is this a good price to buy?
"What will it take for this to move to 11 or 12 ? This is the Highest yielding stock I have seen currently . Market does not seem confident on the sustainability of a 15 Percent yield , and it shows in the dead stock price."
I wonder what spurred this climb? Not complaining 
How bad will earnings miss?
"yeah, 8.50 was a gift. I should have pounced..."
"Based on the conference call Q&A, it sounds like they can manage with the current already-cut 35 cents quarterly dividend, but they are kind of ""surviving"" with it. Any medium setbacks might lead to further dividend cuts in the next year or so."
Quarter 4 dividend declared. $0.35.
will this reach a new low?
More debt for acquisitions...anybody have a comment. In the past when they were issuing shares up the yin yang nobody really seemed to care. The price as not really affected. Now another $200-230 million in debt for acquisition. Gonna be the same thing as diluting the stock? Thoughts?
"Collecting my dividend, riding the bull long to the #$%$ I see $20 when the dividend increases to all new highs because debt isn't bad in 2020 and total revenues show growth."
ARI is down 12.54% to 10.32
ARI is up 19.54% to 8.87
Apollo Commercial Real is up 6.19% to 10.63
I think commercial real estate bottomed two months ago and it's only positive news from here.
How safe is their dividend?
"Their tenants, even the blue chip types, are not paying their rents. The buildings are in danger of going belly up. The social distancing and shutdowns is destroying the N.Y. real estate business."
Anyone can tell me why this is not $14?
Apollo Commercial Real is up 6.84% to 10.94
volume and up tick.
they are late on the divy announcement...
How low is the pull back?
Picked up 50k.
Holy moly what a day.
I'm thinking ima sell and take my slight loss. I also own cim and I think my money is better there. Similar div and there more residential.
waiting for the dip..........
ARI.... will it hit $16 - $18 by November?
Im quite sure that in the end of 2021 well see it at 12-13 DOLLAR PRICE.and 1.6 dollar dividend yearly.pay attention that they bought thir own shares at 9 dollar price about 110 mil dollars.
"ari is OK, it is just the secondary stock offering is too early. If the management company holds out for more substantial earning/share increase and then issue stocks at say 120% book value, that is much better for the existing share holder."
Great quarter. Beat consensus by 7 cents. Not sure how they do it when they diluted our shares by 10% with the stock equity offering. Hope they use/used that capital and get better than the dividend return of10+%
ARI is down 10.30% to 6.27
will this pull back on profit taking?
"Looking 1 month and 1 year charts, it looks like a W bottom has formed and many stocks show the same. In Europe, people get 5 weeks paid vacation and so far that is about what we have just had. We can recover from that, and the massive stimulus will accelerate it."
I had 2000 shares on 09/30. Sold 1000 on 10/06 but only received $350 in dividends. Shouldn’t I have received $700?
this stock is just too stable. Never a good point to add to my collection. 
This was 11+ a week ago. Sheesh. Buying here.
