Dividend declared $0.35/shareForward yield 15.18%ex-div Sept. 29
"“Despite continued economic uncertainty, ARI had another solid quarter, producing operating earnings that covered the $0.35 per share quarterly dividend,” said Stuart Rothstein, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company. “Importantly, ARI achieved these results while maintaining a defensive capital position, ending the quarter with $450 million of liquidity after opportunistically using some excess liquidity to repurchase common stock. To date, ARI has repurchased $119.2 million of common stock at a price which is accretive to both operating earnings and book value per share.”"
"New York, NY, April 22, 2021 – Apollo Commercial Real Estate Finance, Inc. (the “Company” or “ARI”) (NYSE:ARI), today reported results for the quarter ended March 31, 2021.For the first quarter of 2021, net income available to common stockholders per diluted share of common stock was $0.37 and Distributable Earnings (a non-GAAP financial measure defined below) were $0.39 per share of common stock."
Does anyone know what happened to the dividend today?
I am glad to see ARI bought back almost 3 pct of the float in Q2. That is the best way to show trust in their portfolio and dividend. What is better than buy back your debt at 45 pct discount? The hit here is on the owners to collect rents . They hold a mortgage in 90 pct of the portfolio. You can distrust and sell you stock now with a discount value or wait it to trade at book value. I say 3q buy back will be huge. It’s a no brainer. Eventually they will reduce the float until make it private. This worth 14 usd anytime.
"For the second quarter of 2021, net income available to common stockholders per diluted share of common stock was $0.42 and Distributable Earnings (a non-GAAP financial measure defined below) and Distributable Earnings prior to realized losses and impairments on real estate owned and investments were $0.27 and $0.41 per share of common stock, respectively.Commenting on the financial results, Stuart Rothstein, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company said: “ARI had an active and successful first half of 2021, committing to over $1.4 billion of transactions in the United States and Western Europe. We remained focused on efficient capital deployment, as we funded a portion of our robust pipeline with the capital generated from $553 million of loan repayments. In addition, ARI continued to diversify the Company’s capital sources and strengthen the balance sheet with the completion of an eight-year debut $500 million 4.625% senior secured notes offering.”"
"I am thinking about buying 2300 shares. I bealive this a good buy however I am going to wait until the end of the election. ARI had another solid quarter, producing operating earnings that covered the $0.35 per share quarterly dividend,” said Stuart Rothstein, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company. My main fear though is if they cut their dividend. If anyone wants to start a discord about stock information let me know and I can create a server."
"the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.35 per share of common stock, which is payable on October 15, 2021 to common stockholders of record on September 30, 2021."
Anyone Invested here believe ARI can make it to 11 by end of December ?
So who can explain: Why the 10% sell-off or price adjustment alongside the 10% dividend payout? What's the point of receiving a dividend if you lose principle value by the same amount? I thought DIVs were supposed to benefit stockholders (rather than just sitting in company cash bank accounts).
"a better overall choice than a commercial bank...for real estate loans. Banks cant act quickly, and, have too mant Fed overdight to perform as ARI, ABR, BRMK. Bett er total return without Bank's baggage!!! LONG ABR"
I commend the CEO of this company for communicating with the Stock holders with a letter to clarify and put some issues and concerns at ease. This is rare and appreciated very much. Hopefully the irrationally price of the stock will recover to levels it should be at.12-16
"a small miss yields a buying opportunity today. ""For the third quarter of 2021, net income available to common stockholders per diluted share of common stock was $0.38 and Distributable Earnings (a non-GAAP financial measure defined below) and Distributable Earnings prior to realized losses and impairments on real estate owned and investments were $0.35 per share of common stock.Commenting on the financial results, Stuart Rothstein, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company said: “ARI had another solid quarter of operations and continues to build an active pipeline for new transactions. We expect origination levels in 2021 to reach pre-pandemic levels, as transaction volume remains robust and commercial real estate market fundamentals continue to improve.”"

hoping for a strong ec tomorrow. I hope Apollo fairs better than my other REITs stocks have this quarter.
IMHO this is the best managed REIT in the market. This storm will pass and this one will come out on top.
hope everyone is bought in for the divided date today. Still a long on this solid company. Also love Simon property group (SPG).
"Just sharing a theoretical idea to spark conversation; There's really no doubt that in the wake of current events many companies will increase work from home headcount enabling them to recover some value by reducing operating expenses. But will this be a boon or a bust for REITs? Let's say for example ARI holds an asset that's currently enabling 5 tenants to house 100 employees each. Now let's say the average headcount is reduced 20% (again, purely theoretical). How likely is this to promote further division of leased space so that now this same space is hosting 6 businesses at a headcount of 80 each and thereby increasing the potential to increase revenue for REIT's like ARI?I know next to nothing about office space leasing and trends so just throwing the ball out there hoping for a more refined perspective and perhaps some historical analogies."
I think commercial real estate bottomed two months ago and it's only positive news from here.
