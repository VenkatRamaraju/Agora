"only 36 cents or 40 % that was lost for today but my other stocks like apple,MSFT,TMUS, were 2$,10$ ,3$ down. MIGHTY MASTEC! Bullish for tomorrow"
The whole market is down. This will bounce back quickly when market is green.
Argus price target $97. B. Riley $111. Cowen $120. Seems like pretty good appreciation from this level.
From $31 last March to 91$ per share today . best infrastructure company .
"So I've always been the buy and hold investor, in fact I still have my first 2000 shares of PWR bought in 2004 at $6.90! But the BETA (volatility) of MTZ has always intrigued me. When PWR is up $1, MTZ is up $2. When PWR is down $1, MTZ is down $2. So why not exploit that? Have a look at a MTZ 6 week chart. Three times it#$%$ $45, Twice it's fallen to $38. Both times I bought 600 shares at $38ish and sold at $44.50ish. Do the math, nice money. Lot more than my SS. So today I bought again for the third time. Where will it be in a month? Who knows, But I bet $44+. Anyone want to join me?"
"Long and strong since 2013, glad to see the market acknowledgement."
Bottom of this correction may be at hand....
Well today I sold 50 Quanta and used the $$ to buy 70 more MasTec. Confident it will be a brilliant move within six months.
"@Adam This is purely an opinion. I am new to investing. I'm going strictly off if what I see on the charts. The rise of MTZ began with the change of political administrations. Now that its becoming more and more obvious that this admin is failing, so does this stock."
Took a starter today. Hello friends
"I don't get it. PWR is selling for 15X 2020 earnings, MTZ selling for 9X 2020 earnings. Why the disparity? I'm thinking of buying back into MTZ. Should play catch up at some point."
"Well, after selling all my MTZ a while back, on Wednesday I bought a couple hundred shares again at $89.74........This overdone pull back is too hard to ignore. $6 in 2022, that's an unacceptable 15PE. Stick a minimum 20PE on it and we're back to the $122 high.....I believe in the spring. (Y'all see PWR today? Geez)"
I don’t understand the drop in the after market after posting Q3 earnings. The drop caused only because their backlog dropped by 300m?
"Credit Suisse keeps MTZ outperform rating, lowers price target from $130 to $117. Thirty bucks from here still sounds pretty good."
"MasTec’s top line is likely to gain from significant project awards across segments. In 2018, the company came up with a record 18-month backlog of $7.7 billion, up 9% year over year, marking the third consecutive year of noteworthy financial performance.The company’s strong demand in its end markets will help it to post improved 2019 results. MasTec projects 2019 annual revenues at a record level of $7.6 billion, primarily on the back of Communications, Transmission and Power Generation segments. Notably, its Communications segment will benefit from fiber deployments and the execution of 5G rollouts in 2019.zack's equity research"
"I continue to sell small amounts of Quanta and buy shares of MasTec. A $30 price difference is irrational when they will both have $5.50 eps in 2022. MasTec will play catchup at some point, hang in there."
Biased Analysist? - MasTec (MTZ) is expected to deliver a year-over-year DECLINE in earnings. Quantas (PWR) is expected to deliver a year-over-year INCREASE in earnings. - Zach
The Infrastructure Bill will pull us back up again. I plan to hold and I will do it with confidence. GLTA
MTZ authorized repurchase of up to $150 million common shares. This in addition to previously authorized $129 million. Repurchased approximately $110 million in Q1 2020.
Upgraded the price target to $54.00. Yahoo finance. Tomorrow should another great day
