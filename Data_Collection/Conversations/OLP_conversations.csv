Looks to be a smart move on the dividend. Never hurts to conserve some cash. Haven't seen anyone else offering this cash or/ and stock option..

Wonder if this is the reason why they did not increase the divvy. It's been a long time since they have made so many purchases in this close of a time span. Hopefully we will see this bear fruit later in 2019.The purchases made on 11/29 and 12/10 mention the annual rents but not the cap rate whereas the purchase made on 12/13 they mention the cap rate but not the annual rents. Would like to see more consistency in the press releases and mention both items.
