Very disappointed the divvy was not increased. They have increased it in the fourth qtr for the past 6 yrs.

Does anyone have availability to the analyst downgrade report?? Would like to see what their reasoning was.

Nice REIT and no one here ?
Looks to be a smart move on the dividend. Never hurts to conserve some cash. Haven't seen anyone else offering this cash or/ and stock option..

"If you go to company's web site, their properties are shown on a map. Using this a guide I guess this REIT will recover sooner than latter. You be the judge..."
Wonder if this is the reason why they did not increase the divvy. It's been a long time since they have made so many purchases in this close of a time span. Hopefully we will see this bear fruit later in 2019.The purchases made on 11/29 and 12/10 mention the annual rents but not the cap rate whereas the purchase made on 12/13 they mention the cap rate but not the annual rents. Would like to see more consistency in the press releases and mention both items.
cant go to the gym on amazon ! long OLP !
