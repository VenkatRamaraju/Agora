"Moving forward, buy now or any dips!"
SPGI is up 4.97% to 174.62
what a little ROCK STAR !!!!!!!
"I remain a big fan of SPGI. It looks like they stopped buying back their shares as of March 2020. Given the recent acquisition of IHS Markit, that seems sensible. And I can't wait to see what IHS Markit does to grow revenues!! That said, I hope SPGI either resumes buying back those shares, or boosting that dividend. Good luck to all longs!"
"expensive, nice margin, low dividend"
I’m glad it’s up but are this rate is the stop price sustainable ? I’m afraid there will be a pull back. Thoughts ?
why the sudden drop?
"Great business, but the stock has gotten way too expensive recently. Just sold my whole position and bought NTNX instead."
S&P Global is up 8.42% to 283.54
I bought 155 shares of this company 15 years ago. I wish I had bought 1500 shares. Sleeper stock that nobody talks about. Talking heads only talk about fang and Disney which is OK with me.
S&P Global is down 4.92% to 334.47
After watching this company for 6 months I bought some stock. This is a great company with great margins. I need to buy more on this little pull back. I don’t have an idea why it sold off. Great earnings reports. Any ideas? Maybe it’s just the overall dip in the market. I don’t know.
"In this ""renewed"" Market environment, I strongly suspect we go to $375 in 1 mth, then, $430 by end of July. Chart it."
Anyone know why this has such a high short ratio? I'm looking to buy in just not sure if we can expect a small pullback given the short ratio?
This stock is rated as a 10/10 by Equity Starmine. It is overweight compared to price but maintains ahead of industry metrics which I think is optimistic.
slow and steady wins the race !
It’s falling because it’s had a huge run up for years. This pull back is good before earnings so we can see a higher run up when they report. This should be trading in the 400+ range .
Another great year for SPGI.
RSII 100% BUY BARCHART
"I absolutely love this company; I love this stock! I bought this stock back in the McGraw days, when the price was (temporarily) beaten down because the government tried to pin the 2008 financial crisis on S&P. Best move I've ever made. This is my one ""set it and forget it"" investment. I reinvest my dividends and look at the incredible 10 year chart. If the company wanted to increase the dividends more aggressively, I wouldn't mind -- but they also use the cash to make great acquisitions so no complaints. When I see posts about ""taking profits"" or how ""S&P is the worst,"" I just have to laugh. Let's go, S&P -- keep on keepin' on!"
"Why does SPGI seem to get no love or respect, at least any time recently? Long term charts and profitability and Return on Equity look pretty killer "

"Can someone explain why they have been dropping since september. And if it is the IHS Markit merger, why is that resulting in a drop?"
S&P Global is up 6.95% to 236.85
SPGI reached a new All Time High at 195.37
What I missed here? Why falling for 5 months?
profit taking. look at the patterns. always goes back up and higher. My oldest stock in my portfolio. 220's will be next. Not to mention a div aristocrat. Yes...and a bit bias because I use to work there. Long hold for me.

"""decrease of 3% compared to the same period last year "" with a decline on ratings revenue, but generally ok, might be worth, SMA 200 is stable and rising -https://wallmine.com/nyse/spgi/charts"
"Such an underrated stock....... it never disappoints and a div aristocrat as well. +58% YTD, maybe bias because I worked for them back in 2006 to 2012. Held my company stock since then. Stay long and prosper."
What happened? Down 8+% on almost three times normal volume.
"Another thing I love about SPGI — not only do they provide a strong dividend, but they also buy back stock and reduce the overall shares outstanding!!"
SPGI reached a 52 Week low at 201.46
This thing just never seems to get any legs. If this ER fails to report a nice increase in earnings then it is way overvalued. There are better companies out there in financial services that have lower p/e higher dividend and more pin action.
