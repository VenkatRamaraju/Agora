Today is a great day to buy ROL. It should be back in between $52.00 and $54.00 by mid-May. That equates to a 5 - 10% increase. Get on the “bandwagon”.
why the sudden drop of 4% today?
Just as I said ROL always bounces back and never misses a 52 week Target Price. Since February 6th ($46.86) it is up almost 10% February 26th ($51.42).

History shows it is a Great time to buy. ROL should be back to its 52 week high within the next 60 days. There is a great chance it will also split either 3 for 2 or 2 for 1.
is it good to buy now or wait? the financial statements look very strong

Rollins management doesn’t care about some analysts “guess.” They will continue to grow revenue and profit.
Anyone have new information on this stock? Why the drop? Why the split?
any reason why ROL stock jumped down from 58 to 38?
why this stock doesn't go anywhere
Rollins is down 5.14% to 37.31
"With all the storms and bugs getting bigger, this stock should be hitting new highs everyday. In & buying."
"Thoughts on earnings? Seems like this company misses more than not, yet stock has always recovered."
Rollins has 51% insider stock. Is that a good or bad sign? Pros is that stock will be less volatile. Is my thinking correct?
"Great company and great stock, we will see $70 by the end of the year "
Seems to be a pretty high multiple for a pest control business; I guess it's flatlining for a while. It may be worthwhile to $-cost average into it for 2k shares... It will certainly help diversify my portfolio!
"ROL always recovers after a major drop. Should easily hit the new ""Target Price"" ($40.10) a 9% increase; and then grow back to the $44.00 range (another 10% increase)."
Get on the bandwagon. Another great year for ROL. Notice they raised the one year “target price”.
I entered at 39.90...anyone higher than me? any insights will be welcome
