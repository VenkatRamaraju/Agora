Good news that real estate prices continue up not down. Up more coming as building material costs are skyrocketed recently. World must reduce human population growth if we want to lower real estate prices or else more humans means ever higher demand for habitat or places to do business.
Zoom CFO said commercial businesses are coming back soon where pandemic is waning down. Less people will use Zoom for meetings instead face to face in the office building again. This means investors should not sell now. Double Price coming out way. At least back to $12.
PGRE is up 7.06% to 8.64
$15 bucks coming back by next year. Hold on tight to your shares. Enjoy stock moving while getting great dividends. Two birds with one stone. Price is still so cheap. Like buying cheap houses in 2011 during housing crisis.
Don’t let shorts scare you to sell. Just look at Nordstrom it was $12 before vaccines. Now with vaccines stock is at $34. Same for Wells Fargo. Weak hands should not sell. You should buy if you have the money.

"Don't listen to short sellers. $16 within two years by 2024. Just hold and don't even look at it. Stock will rise back up by 2024. Humans are social animals. That is human nature, they always gather around in close contacts interacting with each other. Pandemics will always pass and go."
Huge upside
Stock going back up

Anyone there? PGRE seems quite undervalued. I hope the company can buy back a few hundred million more of stock before the price goes up again.

Someone want takeover of Paramount???
New better covid vaccine will be coming next year from OCGN. Stock up 800% the last two days. Might go up much higher tomorrow. Not based on Mrna technology but from traditional Wes virus. Americans will embrace if approved. Phase 3 trial in India now. This means Paramount will go back up
Property rents are strong. Reits are coming back and stabilizing. Forward looking means this is time to buy and hold for huge upside
Office buildings are thing of the past. Workers are never returning to office buildings in large numbers. Companies have found out much cheaper having workers work from home. It’s win win for both workers and companies.Paramount will be sub $5 share price in the future.As leases expire Paramount will be hurt big time.
Hope this drop lower to $8.50 so I can add more
Buy because management is great
PGRE reached an all time low at 10.12
$15 is definitely coming
Human habits never change. Businesses still want workers to be together so they can interact for maximum efficiency. Besides their salary is still high. Unless you pay workers less for working from home. Only software programmers might be ok for working from home but still a boss would still want a collective mind thinking together to get a project done. As society get back to normal people will get back to the office. Besides humans are social animals. They like to interact with others directly. One would get bored working alone at home. Trust me. I know human instincts.

"I started following ""lionstock-aletrs” (Gooogle it - off course without any space or dash in between the words) and their notifications are better than anyone else."
Steady increase to $12 then to $16 by 2023
I buy trends. When things are turning around I buy when others sell. Sometimes work but it’s all about timing. I always buy at higher prices thinking it has dropped enough. This is why buy small amounts and then average down. It works great this way to buy stock.
PGRE reached an all time low at 9.36
Really good time to get more shares on this dip.. $$$
Commercial properties continue going up in price. Hold tight for higher prices as more vaccines are approved and everything will be normal again.
Commercial properties are coming back strong. Buy now while they are still cheap. Pandemic will not last forever also.

Will be buying more once weak hands sold
Management is being too cautious. They need to sell a building at a discount and buy 1/3 of the shares back. Would create enormous value given the share price.

Paramount is really selling very cheap prices.
Great news 3 successful vaccines on the way by December 10 to 25. Never knew there would by any vaccines since normally takes 5 years to develop. Mrna technology change that. Vaccines can now be designed within hours or days.

There will be 6 to 8 covid vaccines approved worldwide within this month. Covaxin is a traditional vaccine approved in India and should be approved for use in the USA soon. 40% of Americans might want a traditional vaccine instead of Mrna based vaccines. Do not sell. Should be buying.
Going to test its previous low of $6.75?
