$12 by end of the year.
Paramount reached an all time low at 5.57
Huge upside
"You all will make good profits holding Paramount. $16 is still very reasonable by 2024 to 2025. I want to invest in high growth companies like QS, bros, baba, bidu instead."
My QS is going up big time while I get some dividend from Paramount. feeling happy this Christmas for sure.
Commercial properties continue going up in price. Hold tight for higher prices as more vaccines are approved and everything will be normal again.
Repeat. Do not sell. Trend is up from now on.
Management is being too cautious. They need to sell a building at a discount and buy 1/3 of the shares back. Would create enormous value given the share price.
Hope this drop lower to $8.50 so I can add more
PGRE is up 7.95% to 9.50
Markets moving back up

Productivity not good working at home. Also more vaccines are being approved. The world no longer worry as much as before. Don’t need to sell especially low prices. 3 more more vaccines will be approved within the next two months.
Property and land values are going up. Paramount is way undervalued.
Nice after hours reaction. Should see strong upside tomorrow unless entire market crashes!
Paramount is really selling very cheap prices.
"I think $13 to $14 bid should be able for a merger for consolidation of this sector, Consolidation is happening now."
$15 is coming
Pandemic will be over by next year as children will be vaccinated.
"Go ahead , weak hands. Sell now. I will be scoping up those lower by prices."

I buy trends. When things are turning around I buy when others sell. Sometimes work but it’s all about timing. I always buy at higher prices thinking it has dropped enough. This is why buy small amounts and then average down. It works great this way to buy stock.

Great news 3 successful vaccines on the way by December 10 to 25. Never knew there would by any vaccines since normally takes 5 years to develop. Mrna technology change that. Vaccines can now be designed within hours or days.

Just think want to let shorts scare weak hands to sell especially stock dropped $1 already. Many stocks are starting to head back up. Even the airlines and cruise ships.
Office buildings are thing of the past. Workers are never returning to office buildings in large numbers. Companies have found out much cheaper having workers work from home. It’s win win for both workers and companies.Paramount will be sub $5 share price in the future.As leases expire Paramount will be hurt big time.

New better covid vaccine will be coming next year from OCGN. Stock up 800% the last two days. Might go up much higher tomorrow. Not based on Mrna technology but from traditional Wes virus. Americans will embrace if approved. Phase 3 trial in India now. This means Paramount will go back up
Good news that real estate prices continue up not down. Up more coming as building material costs are skyrocketed recently. World must reduce human population growth if we want to lower real estate prices or else more humans means ever higher demand for habitat or places to do business.
"I sold all my Paramount holding to have cash to buy Quantumscape, Baba, bidu, Bros and possibly Sava if it dips to $50."
"I started following ""lionstock-aletrs” (Gooogle it - off course without any space or dash in between the words) and their notifications are better than anyone else."
PGRE reached an all time low at 9.36
Don’t let shorts scare you to sell. Just look at Nordstrom it was $12 before vaccines. Now with vaccines stock is at $34. Same for Wells Fargo. Weak hands should not sell. You should buy if you have the money.

Property rents are strong. Reits are coming back and stabilizing. Forward looking means this is time to buy and hold for huge upside

Ocgn will have vaccine from India by April next year plus we have two vaccines. Probably end up with 5 to 6 vaccines to end covid. Great time to add. Don’t sell any shares.

"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Thetraderguide.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
Human habits never change. Businesses still want workers to be together so they can interact for maximum efficiency. Besides their salary is still high. Unless you pay workers less for working from home. Only software programmers might be ok for working from home but still a boss would still want a collective mind thinking together to get a project done. As society get back to normal people will get back to the office. Besides humans are social animals. They like to interact with others directly. One would get bored working alone at home. Trust me. I know human instincts.
$15 bucks coming back by next year. Hold on tight to your shares. Enjoy stock moving while getting great dividends. Two birds with one stone. Price is still so cheap. Like buying cheap houses in 2011 during housing crisis.

Anyone there? PGRE seems quite undervalued. I hope the company can buy back a few hundred million more of stock before the price goes up again.

There will be 6 to 8 covid vaccines approved worldwide within this month. Covaxin is a traditional vaccine approved in India and should be approved for use in the USA soon. 40% of Americans might want a traditional vaccine instead of Mrna based vaccines. Do not sell. Should be buying.
$12 might be before end of this year.

"Don't listen to short sellers. $16 within two years by 2024. Just hold and don't even look at it. Stock will rise back up by 2024. Humans are social animals. That is human nature, they always gather around in close contacts interacting with each other. Pandemics will always pass and go."

Rents are starting to go back up even in San Francisco
Zoom CFO said commercial businesses are coming back soon where pandemic is waning down. Less people will use Zoom for meetings instead face to face in the office building again. This means investors should not sell now. Double Price coming out way. At least back to $12.
