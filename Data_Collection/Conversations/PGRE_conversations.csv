PGRE reached an all time low at $12.57
"You all will make good profits holding Paramount. $16 is still very reasonable by 2024 to 2025. I want to invest in high growth companies like QS, bros, baba, bidu instead."
Productivity not good working at home. Also more vaccines are being approved. The world no longer worry as much as before. Don’t need to sell especially low prices. 3 more more vaccines will be approved within the next two months.
"I sold all my Paramount holding to have cash to buy Quantumscape, Baba, bidu, Bros and possibly Sava if it dips to $50."
Commercial properties are coming back strong. Buy now while they are still cheap. Pandemic will not last forever also.
Commercial properties continue going up in price. Hold tight for higher prices as more vaccines are approved and everything will be normal again.
Nice after hours reaction. Should see strong upside tomorrow unless entire market crashes!
Steady increase to $12 then to $16 by 2023
PGRE reached an all time low at $13.07
$15 bucks coming back by next year. Hold on tight to your shares. Enjoy stock moving while getting great dividends. Two birds with one stone. Price is still so cheap. Like buying cheap houses in 2011 during housing crisis.
Property and land values are going up. Paramount is way undervalued.
Anyone there? PGRE seems quite undervalued. I hope the company can buy back a few hundred million more of stock before the price goes up again.
"Do not sell, $12 is coming soon."
PGRE reached an all time low at $13.56
Property rents are strong. Reits are coming back and stabilizing. Forward looking means this is time to buy and hold for huge upside
New better covid vaccine will be coming next year from OCGN. Stock up 800% the last two days. Might go up much higher tomorrow. Not based on Mrna technology but from traditional Wes virus. Americans will embrace if approved. Phase 3 trial in India now. This means Paramount will go back up
$12 might be before end of this year.
I buy trends. When things are turning around I buy when others sell. Sometimes work but it’s all about timing. I always buy at higher prices thinking it has dropped enough. This is why buy small amounts and then average down. It works great this way to buy stock.
Good news that real estate prices continue up not down. Up more coming as building material costs are skyrocketed recently. World must reduce human population growth if we want to lower real estate prices or else more humans means ever higher demand for habitat or places to do business.

Repeat. Do not sell. Trend is up from now on.
Zoom CFO said commercial businesses are coming back soon where pandemic is waning down. Less people will use Zoom for meetings instead face to face in the office building again. This means investors should not sell now. Double Price coming out way. At least back to $12.
PGRE reached a new All Time Low at 14.03
Just think want to let shorts scare weak hands to sell especially stock dropped $1 already. Many stocks are starting to head back up. Even the airlines and cruise ships.
$12 by end of the year.
"When Wells Fargo was traded at $22, short sellers bashing it many months and now it is at $42. Paramount is great company and will be $20 soon"
PGRE reached a new 52 Week Low at 14.46
There will be 6 to 8 covid vaccines approved worldwide within this month. Covaxin is a traditional vaccine approved in India and should be approved for use in the USA soon. 40% of Americans might want a traditional vaccine instead of Mrna based vaccines. Do not sell. Should be buying.
Don’t let shorts scare you to sell. Just look at Nordstrom it was $12 before vaccines. Now with vaccines stock is at $34. Same for Wells Fargo. Weak hands should not sell. You should buy if you have the money.
Good news real estate is forecast to go up next year. News today on TV. This means trend is up. Don’t sell.
Management is being too cautious. They need to sell a building at a discount and buy 1/3 of the shares back. Would create enormous value given the share price.
Great news 3 successful vaccines on the way by December 10 to 25. Never knew there would by any vaccines since normally takes 5 years to develop. Mrna technology change that. Vaccines can now be designed within hours or days.
My QS is going up big time while I get some dividend from Paramount. feeling happy this Christmas for sure.
PGRE reached a new All Time Low at 13.76
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Thetraderguide.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
Ocgn will have vaccine from India by April next year plus we have two vaccines. Probably end up with 5 to 6 vaccines to end covid. Great time to add. Don’t sell any shares.
Paramount should start moving back up to $15 since I don't own this anymore Stock always go up a lot after I sell. Enjoy your gains.
Office buildings are thing of the past. Workers are never returning to office buildings in large numbers. Companies have found out much cheaper having workers work from home. It’s win win for both workers and companies.Paramount will be sub $5 share price in the future.As leases expire Paramount will be hurt big time.
"I think $13 to $14 bid should be able for a merger for consolidation of this sector, Consolidation is happening now."
"Don't listen to short sellers. $16 within two years by 2024. Just hold and don't even look at it. Stock will rise back up by 2024. Humans are social animals. That is human nature, they always gather around in close contacts interacting with each other. Pandemics will always pass and go."
