"After witnessing the 2008 CNBC shill show, its amazing how history repeats. The Dukes are trying to liquidate the REITs - a so called “defensive” sector. Bank analysts are coming on touting the great yields. The yield on SBA is Zero. The common is trading at a ridiculous multiple. Interest expense is getting out of hand."

"It may be a while before distributions are made:""SBA’s determination as to the timing and amount of future dividend distributions will be based on a number of factors, including REIT distribution requirements, investment opportunities around its core business and its existing federal net operating losses (“NOLs”) of approximately $1.15 billion as of December 31, 2015. SBA may use these NOLs to offset its REIT taxable income, and thus any required distributions to shareholders may be reduced or eliminated until such time as the NOLs have been fully utilized. SBA does not expect that it will be required to make any distribution of accumulated earnings and profits (commonly referred to as a “purging” dividend) in connection with its REIT conversion."""
