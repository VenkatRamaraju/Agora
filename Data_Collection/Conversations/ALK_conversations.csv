"Bought 100 shares at $36 back in July and just sold today at $66. Even with the good news pouring in, I feel that the current price isn't justified, and I think ALK will be stagnant if not bearish in the near future. Thank you ALK for the great ride; I will miss you."
How can compared between Southwest Airlines and all?

This stock has been an option seller's dream the past couple months.
I got in just before ALK joined the One World alliance. This was definitely the right move. I see 90$ by the end of the year. And this is a conservative estimate!

"Alaska Air Group’s ALK subsidiary, Alaska Airlines, announced the acceleration of its fleet growth by exercising options on 12 Boeing 737-9 aircraft earlier than planned. The aircraft are expected to be delivered between 2023 and 2024. As vaccinations increase and countries reopen their borders to vaccinated travelers, the move is prudent.With the conversion of the 12 aircraft, Alaska Airlines’ firm order for Boeing 737-9 planes totals 93. Five of these aircraft are currently in service. The 737-9 jets consist of 16 first class seats and 24 premium class seats, and can carry 178 guests."
$60 seemed like a very strong resistance. Seeing that it has been breached it will be interesting to see if this was a legitimate move or rather a fake out.
"Investors will rotate into airlines again, have patience. Major bullish catalysts are coming in July..-Data is showing July 4th weekend will break post-pandemic TSA travel numbers by a decent margin.- United States will loosen international travel restrictions in July or early August.- Highly anticipated airlines earnings mid July.- Transatlantic routes will most likely open end of July as UK reopens- July on average is the busiest travel month of the year.- Increase in oil prices are being countered by higher demand for tickets and ticket prices.$DAL $AAL $UAL $SAVE $JETS $JBLU $ALK $LUV"
