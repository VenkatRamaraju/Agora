Fantastic score for BMTC. WSFS is paying 2.3x TBV (in stock). That’s a huge premium to the median 1.3 multiple over the past year’s acquisitions. The deal could also heat up Philly area competition.

"Looks like a good buy now. Near its low and paying a dividend with a 4% yield. Might be a while before we see $40+ again, but I can easily see BMTC returning to $30 when things settle down. That's a nice 20% (approx.) return, plus whatever dividends you get along the way."
