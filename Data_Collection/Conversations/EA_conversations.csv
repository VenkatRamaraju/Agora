any reason why $EA lost so much in the last days after it runs already over 145$?
"Nasdaq going up to much. EA falling now. I dont get it....ATVI rebounded.TTWO keeps going higher as the day goes on.EA falls, after falling the most in the last week and month in the sector."
Remember Google tried and failed at running a game studioAmazon studios hasn't delivered one good game in the past.Gaming Studios are fundamentally a very hard business to succeed in and EA has been doing very well.This is a LT buy and hold stock.Do not sell under 200!
"Bullish currently! Here are some reasons why:1. Fifa 22 official release (Tomorrow)2. Battlefield 2042 (November)3. Black Friday season & Christmas, a lot of people is wishing some EA games for these periods.4. Four EA games added to the Geforce Now service.PT: $150 before end of 2021"
"Seems like a big overreaction.....added some today, hope I wasnt too early."

Anything driving this drop? May be time to get some more...
"Alright well I pulled the trigger. Not a huge position, but I’m in at 126.87"
"EA may do great for shareholders, but standing by their products is something they are terrible at. The ethics behind their products and how they shut down servers of slightly older games and allow hackers to destroy games such as the titanfall debacle. Absolute trash company (even though it makes money)."
"MADDEN 22 Looks to be a hot mess. If the rest of the games EA makes are this bad, the sales will drop.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VEAA-D9vzY"
Why is EA down 6%? is Battlefield getting delayed PAST NOVEMBER??? I don't see any confirmation on this...
"EA delays game for 1 month reiterates revenue and bookings, stock loses 3.5 billion in market cape....ohh the irony, they won't even make that from the game!"

"RSI at 23, this is popping this week - wayyy oversold"
https://discord.gg/rYDb9qmm
My December 17 $145 and $150 calls are thankful the delay is only until November 19th Appreciate the discount this morning and anticipate this stock being near $160 by end of November off BF hype and holiday run.
"Electronic Arts Announces Battlefield 2042 Is Now Set to Launch Worldwide on November 19, 2021"
Now EA is under performing ATVI which had a price target decrease yesterday.
I heard about EA the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
i think this is a value buy at $126.00. I picked up 35 shares today. Let's see what happens in Q4
Blackrock is the largest holder of EA. Blackrock also owns a ton of evergrande corporate debt. I bet this EA selloff is Blackrock raising $$$ for a possible evergrande default.
This is absurd. Q4 earnings report will remain the same. Stock is down $9.
Manipulated dumpVery uncomfortable with this position
Swing traders about to take profits better get out
"50 and 200 day MA about to meet, either this thing bounces big off resistance tomorrow or it’s headed for 110 in the short term"
Thinking about buying but can’t tell if this is going to be a longer term trend or not. Worries about next earnings forcing this lower but obviously with battlefield coming out I see this soaring into the start of 2022.
they acquired glu mobile....and im a 32 y.o. who spends alot....of money on it lol....interested in buying and hold e.a.
this has come a long way since Apex reveal came out in AH and it shot up ... still holding it and praying for NC Dubs

Lost 5.4billion market cap since the delay of BF2042.
"Adding some of this, seems pretty cheap at the moment!"
"From a technical standpoint, there’s so much pulling this up right now the 50 day MA crossed the 200 day and we’ve seen nothing but upward resistance pushing this higher. On top of that, the battlefield hype will/is only adding to momentum. Very bullish on this right now"
I feel like losing FIFA is a big deal?
Love this V shape chart! This accumulating is for the rally tmr!
rumour: battlefield 2042 delay ... in case you guys dont know.(no shares or short here)
I don’t see many people talking about how revealing madden 22 has been. Anyone else see fundamental flaws in the programming requiring an entire (expensive) rewrite?
Time to start using that buyback!
