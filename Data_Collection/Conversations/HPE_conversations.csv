hpe' future is very positive with demands of data center servers.
I wonder why the sudden drop in stock price in HPE (about a 3% drop) took place just now...
A lot of volume to the downside. Not a good sign.
"Tomorrow is hopefully going to be a great day. I got an email this afternoon ( something I signed up for) from the Supreme Court of Calif who will notify you of changes to a case you are interested in. At 1:58 Pm today I got an email which reported that Oracle's petition for review of their case - where they lost to HPE -was denied. When Oracle lost their appeal at the Calif. Court of Appeals ( in their SEC filing 10Q) on June 14th of this year, they basically said they would appeal ( which they did) to the Calif. Supreme Court. When Oracle filed their 10Q for their quarter just ended, they said they had appealed. But cautioned that if they lost their appeal ( and it appears that they have lost it as their request was denied) they did not mention any other appeals ( like to the US Supreme Court ) or any other avenues - and further stated that if they lost their appeal, it would be a material loss to them. I believe we are there now. We will see if there is an announcement tomorrow to confirm what I have believed. I did notice that the stock was up after hours today, as reported on both Yahoo and the WSJ. The WSJ reported after hours volume of 487,223 shares. Folks, if I have this correct, this could be HUGE!!!.. The award could be as much as around 12% of their market cap, plus a potential short squeeze. I am hoping for 16 plus!! That is my personal hope."
Looks like a breakout is forming...could see a nice climb to the $19 range...little resistance till then...lets see
"Ok guys, the company is putting on a virtual securities analyst meeting this Thursday at 10:00 am PT/ 1:00 ET. At their website there is a link to watch a webcast. We will see what they have to say."
I think the sweet smell of victory over Oracle ( HPE recently won the Calif. Supreme Court ruling) with a potential $2.3 Billion payday ( sooner rather than later) should move the HPE stock much higher in the near term. Maybe there will be some sort of feedback at the Securities Analyst meeting on Thursday morning of this week. Its at 10:00 AM PT/ 1:00 ET and the speakers will be the CEO & CFO. So you have the two top people. Maybe this is the time for the good news.
"So I listened to the virtual presentation today. They did confirm that they have indeed received the $2.3 Billion from Oracle. Which is fantastic. While not said, it leads me to believe that is why they have taken two large actions: (#1) They announced previously ( and it was again mentioned today) that they were paying off a $1Billion long term loan ( thereby reducing their debt - which is very positive & saving them $46 Million annually in interest cost, or $11.5 Million a quarter. and (#2) They announced that they would buy back * at least* $500 Million in company stock next fiscal year ( which begins next Monday). That is on top of the $250 Million in stock they announced that they would buy back in their Fiscal 4th quarter, which ends this weekend, as their fiscal year ends Oct. 31st. So the combination of those two is pretty significant. They were upbeat the whole call. I was pleased. Until their 4th quarter earnings are released in about a month, I think it will take some analyst upgrades to get the stock back over 16-17"
"Thank You Daniel for all your hard work, honesty and time in keeping everyone on this board updated"
if aruba was stand alone company it'd be trading at 30x sales like every other high growth tech
Is it time to load for next week?
"One of these days, hopefully very very soon, HPE is going to make the big press release regarding the windfall ($2 Billion plus??) from winning the Calif. Supreme Court's ruling against Oracle. While Oracle can appeal to the US Supreme Court and try and overturn it, their options there are very limited ( and statistically a very low chance of getting a review) and making a deal now might be in their best interests. Up to now, it has been Oracle 0-3 ( no wins, 3 losses - as in loss at trial court, loss at Calif. Court of Appeals, and loss at Calif Supreme Court) Both HPE and Oracle can hire the best lawyers money can buy, at the center of this are the basic facts of the case. And with Oracle, their lawyers can only play with the cards they have been dealt. And I would think that the 3 straight losses speak for the cards they have been dealt, or they would have won at least one of them! From my reading, Oracle has 90 days from the date of the decision of the Calif. Supreme Court to appeal. Then the US Supreme Court has time to decide if they will even take up the case or not. All the while and even as I write this, the interest on the jury award is accruing at $1 Million a day according to SEC filings by HPE. Now Oracle can go just so long as their options are running out very fast now. If they appeal, and get turned down by the US Supreme Court for even a review, it is game over. And any leverage they have today is totally gone. So while they just have a little bit a leverage today ( saying they will appeal and delaying longer) they might try and make a deal to end it and stop the $1 Million a day clock from running. I believe - the end is near! Of course, HPE gets half of $1 Million a day ( the other half goes to HPQ) so $500,000 a day, which works out to $45 Million in just one quarters earning. We will see what comes of this. Hoping the stock jumps very high upon good news! And also hoping that the Shorts get squeezed Very hard when it happens."
"Something that could signal something important. This afternoon, HPE filed a SEC form 8-K which was a statement that they were paying off a $1 Billion long term debt this month. The debt doesn't come due until 2024 - so quite early. It current has an interest rate of 4.65%. The notice doesn't mention refinancing it with new debt with a lower interest rate or a longer maturity. Just paying it off. Given that they declared that they would buy back $250 Million in stock recently and paid cash for a recent acquisition, this is a pretty big use of cash/liquidity with the other things going on. Perhaps they are more confident of getting a big settlement with Oracle soon??? Don't know. But paying off a lot of debt could help their credit rating, and also their earnings! Its all positive !!"
Is this a good chance this deal with Orchle will be completed.
"Who has the power at Yahoo to remove these posts about HPE and HPQ's win in CA Supreme Court yesterday?I have posted a Reuters news link twice. Daniel has posted about it, and another posted a link also.ALL THESE POSTS HAVE BEEN REMOVED THIS MORNING.I again ask.... who has the power to remove these posts? This is potentially substantive information to stockholders."
What would you rather doPay $5 billion + lawsuit or just buy company?
This is one of my favorite long term stocks. Patients will pay.
The company needs to follow in the footsteps of its former parent company and raise their dividend as well by 30%.That substantial dividend increase would be the catalyst we need to get this stock to the basic 10multiple it certainly merits.
"Something may be going on between Oracle and HPE. The Calif. Supreme Court just declined to hear the appeal of Oracle who wanted to overturn their now ( with interest ) $4.5 Billion award to HPE & HPQ ( split 50-50 between HPE & HPQ.) Oracle's June 10Q, to the SEC when they lost at the Calif. Court of Appeals, they said they would appeal to the Calif. Supreme Court. In early September, that 10 Q to the SEC said that if they lost the appeal at the Calif. Supreme Court they would be liable for the jury trial amount plus interest ( now about $4.5 Billion) They didn't mention if they lost it ( which they just did) they would try and appeal to the US Supreme Court. Now, if I were HPE, I would love to put out a press release that we just won $2.25 Billion! ( or about 12% of the market cap of the company!!! Why haven't they? Some thoughts come to mind. Are they waiting for Oracle to run up the white flag and admit that they lost before they speak? Or is Oracle spending some time trying to figure if they have any chance in the world of making a go for the US Supreme Court ( which is a very slim chance statistically - if you can even call it at chance at all). Keep in mind that this (Calif Supreme Court decision) a material event for Oracle, so they are duty bound to disclose the probable loss ( I would think) in a timely manner) or potentially risk lawsuits ( haven' they lost enough already?) Also keep in mind that the award as it stands now, is accruing a $1 Million dollar a day interest cost. ( That figure come from HPE's SEC 10-Q filing) Which, should they decide to further appeal to the US Supreme court, keeps adding up. Or are they in discussions to just buy HPE for what ?? $20/share??? The award to HPE works out to about $1.70 share, so deduct that from $20 and you get less than $18.50 /share in true cost. Somethings gotta give soon, as the Calif. Supreme Court's siding with HPE is HUGE!!! Why no announcement? From either side? Make my mind wonder - what is going on? It is such a big event, that this must be consuming a lot of time. Do I hear more stock buy backs in my mind? That is the kind of money you can do Many things with. I am hoping that there is an announcement very soon -which will clarify the situation. In any event, this is a big deal for HPE!"
