Tax loss selling as each tranche becomes liquid...no buyers on the other side.
"Quoting from PR today --- ""New York City REIT completed a successful third quarter, highlighted by listing our Class A shares on the NYSE, collecting over 85% of the cash rent due in the quarter, and significantly increasing our weighted-average remaining lease term to over 7.5years, despite the ongoing challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Michael Weil, Chief Executive Officer, commented"".It is beyond my comprehension to see how this has been a successful quarter for stockholders. What world are these guys living in?"

Stay away from NYC. Who ever NYC hired as their market maker just messes around with the trades and really does not provide adequate liquidity. Terrible trader - tough to buy and sell as the market maker just buys from or sells to you 2 shares at a time to make things difficult and yes with a bid ask spread you can drive a truck through - not good. STAY AWAY!!

any idea what's so wrong with this stock? it just keeps sinking while other reits are rising
Roundtripper!!
I guess this reit hasn't made a profit in 4 years. How is that possible??? I guess that's why it's lost around 75 percent of its initial value.
