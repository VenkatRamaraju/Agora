"Raised dividend, share buybacks, FY guidance at the high end of the range and above consensus estimates. VFC should actually be up and not down today!"
Reinstating $2.4billion share repurchase program!
"Still holding the position bought at $66.15. NKE report was concerning from a supply chain perspective. Feel a lot better after the Levi’s report. We have exposure to manufacturing in Vietnam but not to the extent of NKE. VFC is a dividend aristocrat. I think below $70 is a good place to own the stock after this correction. Ironically, we where making similar lows this time last year before rallying to $90. I think the risk/reward favor the bulls."
Wow they missed on earnings and revs. Not good. New lows coming!
VFC issued somewhat favorable guidance. The company sees FY22 revenue of $12.0B vs. $11.8B prior and $12.0B consensus and expects FY22 EPS of $3.20 vs. $3.18 consensus.
Squid game on Netflix is causing Vans to get sold out!
added at $68.35
FY guidance will be at the high end of the range according to mgmt. FY revenue and earnings expected to be above consensus and the company raised the dividend. Just added to my existing position!
Veronica wu stepped down as she spoke against BLM movement - this 5% drop is not a business issue. Ex dividend in 2 days it very likely should run up tomorrow into the dividend.
Veronica Wu steps down. Board of Directors. Could have been for personal reasons so I bought more.
"Looks to me like they bumped up the dividend payment:VF’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, payable on December 20, 2021, to shareholders of record on December 10, 2021."
VFC has been a Dividend Aristocrat for the last 48 years with a yield just under 3%. Only about 65 companies are on the aristocrat list and many with much shorter time on the list and lower yields. I've owned it for several years and just bought more. Great secure long term investment that pays investors to wait for the next upturn! Price target is $95!!!
This is insane. Buying as much as possible at the discounted rate. IMHO
How is this possible - still going down - all other stocks are green.
"IMO, this is a gift. The only thing I feel bad about is buying on this drop because she is leaving the board on a subject I COMPLETELY agree with her on!"
"Initially started buying at $69.25, then $68.30. then $67.30 and now $66.95."
VFC just raised the dividend to $0.50. Should support the stock!
this thing just continues to go down. $69.21 now. Wow

Started at $66.15. Basically at 52 week low. Quite a decline with CFRA with a strong buy rating yesterday. I understand the issue with Director Wu but it seems it has gone down enough. Thoughts? Catching a falling knife.
