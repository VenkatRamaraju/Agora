VF is down 4.92% to 68.82
VFC is down -4.92% to 74.60
New 52 week low today.
Earnings were 2 cents light but they guided higher for the year. Obviously expectations got too bullish. My take It would be a great investment in the low $60 but I do not think it goes that far. Realistically for long term investors I think you start @$75 and add on weakness. I think a test of the low $70’s is likely and a buying opportunity.
"23 May 2019 @ 09:00 EDT Yahoo shows: ""Pre-Market: 4:31AM EDT 82.80 -7.53 (-8.34%)"" It closed 22 May at 90.33. (90.33 / 7) = 12.90 so that is not it. KTB-WI closed at 37.15. (90.33 - 37.15) = 53.18. 53.18 / 7 = 7.59 so that looks like the spin off market value?"
VFC reached a new All Time High at 94.45
I almost bought a strangle because robin hood said earnings was tomorrow morning lol. thankfully I saw the article stating it's the 22nd.

"From the press release: Record date of May 10, 2019, distribution of shares is expected to be after market close May 22, 2019. Ratio is 1 for 7 VFC shares.Kontoor ticker expected to be KTB WI (When Issued)They lose me here with: 'Beginning on or about May 9, 2019, and through the distribution date, it is expected that there will be two ways to trade VF common stock – either with or without the distribution of Kontoor Brands’ common stock. VF shareholders who sell their shares of VF common stock in the “regular-way” market (that is, the normal trading market on the NYSE under the symbol “VFC”) after the record date and on or prior to the distribution date will be selling their right to receive shares of Kontoor common stock in connection with the spin-off. It is anticipated that shares of VF common stock will also trade ex-distribution (that is, without the right to receive the Kontoor Brands distribution) during that period under the symbol “VFC WI.” '"

I know my charts are a bunch of Voodoo... but VFC broke the major up trend line today. The next support is around 72.50. The stock did seem to bounce there today but any more selling pressure and I believe this stock will be bearish for the near term.
"Looks like VFC is jumping again. Cash flow cow with almost Dividend King status (50 years straight increasing divs), with low debt. I sold a $100August CC, and it very well might be excercised. That's OK too, I got a nice premium and will sell for extreme valuation."
when are earnings?
"BOOT (Boot Barn) is VF's next acquisition. Or it should be. Way down from recent highs, stellar management and everything that supposedly caused it to tank during the Covid panic is more or less a non-issue at this point."
"Yowza x2.. I'm up 50% in 9.5 months in VFC, plus 3 dividends and another soon. Not too shabby... Buy low, reap divs, reinvest while working, paycheck when early retired. No need to sell the goose that lays the golden eggs. Simple peeps if you keep it simple..."
Too rich for me. Lower levels maybe
VFC is down -4.91% to 91.56
"For fiscal 2020, VF Corp. expects revenue in the range of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion and adjusted EPS in the range of $3.30 and $3.35. FactSet guidance is for sales of $14.5 billion and EPS of $4.23, which may not take the separation into account. Per the above excerpt, VFC guidance didn't include the Kontoor spinoff since Kontoor is now a separate company as of today.Closing price for VFC-WI (pre-spinoff) yesterday (5/21) = $86.63Current premarket VFC (post-spinoff) today (5/22) = $87.50"
What will the share ratio be for VFC shareholders in the new company?
"Initially started buying at $69.25, then $68.30. then $67.30 and now $66.95."
Falling today? I assume from the announcement they will be releasing their numbers? Its been on my watch list for some time now.

"We are sporting towards a 52 week high, summer season is nigh. Superior cash flow, -A- credit rating with low debt, keeps the divs and div increases pumping. Yowzah, it's a keeper."
"Dividend increase announced in the press release: VF’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, reflecting a 12 percent increase over the previous quarter's dividend. This dividend will be payable on December 20, 2019, to shareholders of record on December 10, 2019."

I was sitting on over 50% gains. Took some off the table today and kept my original position amount for dividends. Sold 30% of my holdings and took profit. I still really like this company but with the market turmoil and this currently at all time highs and PE getting a bit lofty. Good luck to all.
Just initiated a position in VFC. What a gift!
"Excellent company. Fantastic leadership. They even provided guidance, along with a fair beat on revenues and nice beat on EPS. Definitely one to watch and buy for the long term. If VF acquires some smaller retail companies, it could bolster a new trend in sales....."

"Still holding the position bought at $66.15. NKE report was concerning from a supply chain perspective. Feel a lot better after the Levi’s report. We have exposure to manufacturing in Vietnam but not to the extent of NKE. VFC is a dividend aristocrat. I think below $70 is a good place to own the stock after this correction. Ironically, we where making similar lows this time last year before rallying to $90. I think the risk/reward favor the bulls."
Up scope today.. can the century mark be far away?
Going into close with a covered call. Either way it goes for earnings it will be a good Friday! Goodluck to everyone!

Hope that not to many followed her on this one. So don't feel bad if YOU have picked a losing stock. It happens to the best of us. GLTA"

I emailed the company because they won't be selling many of those. Maybe a couple teens will buy them, but the women who have money to spend won't be buying them. They will just wait till they come out with the ones that actually fit. I always wear the same size Lee's and I positively can't wear those."

Spinoffs have historically almost always led to price gains immediately following it. The spinoff creates a market inefficiency because the shares won’t be priced correctly following the spinoff.

"SOME input on 5G. It is over hyped. A facade. It's a much shorter wavelength, and is more susceptible to high humidity, rain, dense air in general. It just doesn't have the penetrating power of 3G. An alleged ATT technician @ an ATT store told me a smart phone switches down to 3G in fringe areas. Lets say you are 5 miles from the tower and it is raining . Good luck. so a smart phone will lose all those wonderful things they are claiming 5g can do, because it is almost a microwave wavelength. In the city should work fine with line of sight . My suggestion is to go with fiber optics when ever you can, obviously not with a cell phone of course"
