i'm expecting a 20 percent gain in all argentina stocks if they reach a deal with bondholders this week. last i heard they were 5 dollars apart. its a win/win so expect that to happen sooner rather than later. then should be getting my dividends next month perhaps and buy 10 percent more with that lol. i'm heavily invested in argentina. i own 3 other stocks in my retirement portfolio in argentina.

"Anyone wondering why the share price has made a nice move upwards? Clue? 1Q21 Highlights....BBVA Argentina's inflation adjusted net income in 1Q21 was $3B, 50.8% greater than the $2B reported in 1Q20. Excellent potential here as the pandemic conditions are starting to improve in the world and this share price was once in the $25 range, any idea where it might be headed from the $3.37 range today? Well $8.00 and a dividend would be a very acceptable situation. Good luck to shareholders!"

"This company is heavily undervalued; it has great financials that have been improving over the past four years, and I believe it should be at least $7. Argentina’s economic situation—while not too important to the company—will get better in the upcoming months, not decline. The country’s economy is expected to decline in 2020 but increase drastically in 2021, 2022, and 2023."

If Argentina Yuanifies there dollar debt will be manageable in 10-20 years since the dollar will only be worth a fraction of the value it is today. Argentina can cover their import needs just by trading with China.

"We've got another dividend in the works. This makes sense, if BCRA (the Central Bank of the Republic of Argentina) is taking this long to approve one dividend, might as well get the next onto the stack.
