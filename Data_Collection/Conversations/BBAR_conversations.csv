anyone knows what happened AH? -16%?
When do you suppose BBAR will start paying dividends again?
"April 27, 2021: There is a 6-k sec filing from BBAR that says a new dividend has been voted on and approved. No date for action is given, and there's a note that it requires final bank authorization.I'm only on this board, if you have access to others then Spread the News: A dividend is forthcoming."
I have a question guys. This seems to have appeared in my portfolio without me purchasing it. Did it split from another company?
Banco BBVA Argentina is up 6.41% to 4.19
Banco BBVA Argentina is down 6.70% to 3.76
Banco BBVA Argentina is up 6.62% to 4.19
If Argentina Yuanifies there dollar debt will be manageable in 10-20 years since the dollar will only be worth a fraction of the value it is today. Argentina can cover their import needs just by trading with China.
Why is it going up for the second day?
"Really good results on the income, surpassed last year and last quarter on nearly all metrics. Let's go!"
Banco BBVA Argentina is up 6.95% to 4.47
Banco BBVA Argentina is down 6.37% to 4.05
Anyone know if dividends will be paid this year? Did not find anything on their website.
Banco BBVA Argentina is up 6.51% to 3.63
i'm expecting a 20 percent gain in all argentina stocks if they reach a deal with bondholders this week. last i heard they were 5 dollars apart. its a win/win so expect that to happen sooner rather than later. then should be getting my dividends next month perhaps and buy 10 percent more with that lol. i'm heavily invested in argentina. i own 3 other stocks in my retirement portfolio in argentina.
For the patient investor BBAR is still profitable and a great long term investment. IMO BBAR stock will start to appreciate in three to six months when the virus issue begins to subside and HOPEFULLY the world economy begins to recover.
"This company is heavily undervalued; it has great financials that have been improving over the past four years, and I believe it should be at least $7. Argentina’s economic situation—while not too important to the company—will get better in the upcoming months, not decline. The country’s economy is expected to decline in 2020 but increase drastically in 2021, 2022, and 2023."
"We've got another dividend in the works. This makes sense, if BCRA (the Central Bank of the Republic of Argentina) is taking this long to approve one dividend, might as well get the next onto the stack. The report is up over at the sec page for BBAR. This site won't let me post a link for some reason, but it's dated 9/21/21 if you want to google it."
Banco BBVA Argentina is up 6.78% to 4.41
I'm acumulating shares at this level. In 3 to 5 years I will bear the fruits. Patience
This established AGENTINA Bank (BBAR) will IMO rebound along with the economy. The patient investor will find BBAR a solid safe investment.
"this is a great strong buy , you have to by and hold and in a couple months check and say tks to me"
"Anyone wondering why the share price has made a nice move upwards? Clue? 1Q21 Highlights....BBVA Argentina's inflation adjusted net income in 1Q21 was $3B, 50.8% greater than the $2B reported in 1Q20. Excellent potential here as the pandemic conditions are starting to improve in the world and this share price was once in the $25 range, any idea where it might be headed from the $3.37 range today? Well $8.00 and a dividend would be a very acceptable situation. Good luck to shareholders!"
under 2 in the next months
"Very heavy volume in BBAR and GGAL, along with 5% increases. Same with Argentine stocks across the board. I didn't find any news. Anyone?"
Just wondering how the new tax on the wealthy is going to affect the Argentine banks.
Excelent time to be selling this stock.Those who made the trade 3 to 4.20 be happy.Turn around soon.Target :2.5
I know that quarterly results were good but there must be more to the stock price increase. Anyone know if something political is favorable and pushing most Argentine stocks up?
Any news explaining the 7% drop today?
BBAR is a well run company that will get back on track revenue wise once the pandemic issue is resolvedafter the first of the year.
Banco BBVA Argentina is down 5.91% to 3.66
Here's hoping we're finally going to cross over into the $4 range and then continue our journey up as the pandemic in South America slows and the economies start firing up.
any news on when the dividend is? i thought it was supposed to be a few days ago. so far i haven't got a penny.
"Got in at about $3.30 and sold at $3.70 or so. The fundamentals on this stock are great. The problem is Argentina. I would like to hold but threat of nationalization, runs on foreign currency, just general LatAm funny business are making me anxious about getting back in the game."
Any one know where the Argentine government stands on approving the dividend that BBAR proposed to pay? Is there any timeline or date on when the government would rule on this? Thanks!
Cheers to all longs.
Banco BBVA Argentina is up 6.99% to 3.98
"Should really take off since it seems obvious that the dollar is going to keep falling. Even if not it looks like it's undervalued by 50% compared to U.S. bank stocks. Just my opinion. You might so oh no, they're too mush into socialism but what country isn't at this point?"
30% down today
"Argentina’s economy is expected to grow this year for the first time since 2017 after contracting 9.9% in 2020. However, all economic indicators point to a long recovery before the country returns to pre-recession levels."
