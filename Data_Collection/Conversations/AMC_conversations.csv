"Via Ortex#AMC - Short InterestA lot of securities lending activity in $AMC today, especially given the high cost to borrowThe intraday data shows 5m shares being borrowed at an average rate of 129%5 million shares borrowed at 129% today!"
"WHY AMC IS DOWN AFTERHOURS: Hedge fund managers, Short sellers, and Market Makers are using their extended hour trading to scare retail traders (You) off. Most retail traders (You) lack the ability to trade before and after the market opens/closes. This is why it is currently down. Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock. It will happen every single evening for the next several days so be prepared for this. If it is to stressful for you, please put away your phone/computer and check again in the morning. COPY AND PASTE THIS SO EVERYONE KNOWS THE TRUTH"
And no one is selling....
"Repost from Mr wolf, very important message : “Listen to me very carefully as I cannot stress this enough. PM and AH action is when the big money has the most control and manipulation over the share price. The only reason this was held down today is because they blocked out millions of investors from buying. Short positions have went up here drastically which means they are banking on a crash but if you as an individual investor, hold together with many other like minded investors.. we can not lose. Keep fighting the good fight. Cheers. $GME $NAKD $SNDL $AMC and many more”"
"AMC investors: Please conduct your research on DRS as I have spoken to some who own GME and they claim it works; however, you need to do the research and speak to others to find out the disadvantages."

HF's shorting a lot of fake shares. Make them pay
AMC should have a register for all the shares. Shareholders could have access online to confirm they own real shares and not phantom HF trickery. And AMC will be able to help the APES that helped them.
"Do you know what is costs me to go to a Yankee game? $30 just to park, plus ticket costs, food and $12 beers! You can stay home and watch those too. But people still go because it is an experience. Same with the theatre. I went to weeks ago and the theatre was filled with couples. The date night is not dead and I will not sell until the shorts cover! How you like them apples!"
"What a killer time to be holding a boat-load of AMC with the volume and price increasing daily huh? 30 million, 40 million, 50 million and tomorrow I predict massive volume that will top today by some measure and you want to know why? Well... if you don't study charts much I would encourage you to start now and look at AMC's one month chart on Yahoo and please compare the current price, 10 day, and 50 day moving averages and make sure you use one day intervals. What you will see is when AMC closed today at $10.32 the price had just broken over the 50 day moving average and people that's on a one month chart. Now look back on the chart a few days to the last time you see the current price breaking over the 50 day moving average. To save you time the and effort the last time this happened was on April 4th and the price was at $9.11. After that occurred, the price shot up to 11.50 within the next 2 weeks. That's nearly a $2.50 move and I expect to see a similar occurrence but at even a a faster pace with volume picking up like it has been lately. The best part is, the higher the price steadily climbs, (look at AMC's 5 day chart) the more confidence retailers will have and when you couple that with the number of people buying and holding with so much upside potential we could see a move of over $3.00 to the upside from this price and now in the after hours the price is at $10.40 so we're breaking even higher over the 50 day as I type. I won't even talk about the possibility of a mega-squeeze which I for one am not relying on. Lastly, AMC is practically the only stock in my portfolio that saw an increase today and that's one heck of a lot to be said with the DOW down almost 700 points. I know I already said lastly but finally... Look at the futures of every index...If I were shorting this stock... oh forget it... I'd never short this stock. GO LONGS..!"

You’re only position AMC
"6138 long! Here is a blip from the announcement. What seems most important is the last ten words. Do they sound like management has any interest to ""get"" those shorties? You tell me : The Board of Directors (the “Board”) and management team of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. thank you for your continued support and enthusiasm for our company. As fellow shareholders, we are entirely committed to growing our business for the shareholders who are rooting for our success, certainly not to those who would seek to profit from our demise."
Once in a lifetime opportunity here folks. 20+ years in the market I've never seen anything like this. Never again will billions of phantom shares be printed with no intention of having to cover them. They couldn't cover at $6 they sure can't cover now! GME / AMC will forever change trading. All these new rules are designed so this can never happen again. Trade wisely
Been watch the volume at theaters! Down 60% from pre pandemic levels!

A trading buddy asked me the other day about AMC and where I got the pick. I told her to check out (http://financialdeals.tech). That’s where I get 95% of my winners.
I keep buying more at these great prices. I will eat Ramen noodles for a while until this squeezes than ill be eating lobster and filet migon.I will feed the food banks in my city when I become wealthy.

"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s top brokers are quietly tightening their rules for who can bet against retail traders’ most-popular meme stocks.Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Jefferies Financial Group Inc. are among firms that have adjusted their risk controls at prime-brokerage operations, according to people familiar with the moves. The banks are trying to protect themselves against fallout from extreme surges and dips that have characterized trading in companies including AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., MicroVision Inc. and GameStop Corp.The changes mean some hedge funds and other institutional investors now face higher collateral requirements or are limited from shorting certain stocks, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing internal policy decisions.“Until further notice, Jefferies Prime Brokerage will no longer offer custody on naked options” in GameStop, AMC and MicroVision, the firm said in a memo to clients seen by Bloomberg News. Naked options allow investors to short a stock without owning the underlying securities. Jefferies, which told clients that other stocks may be added to the list, will also no longer permit short sales of those securities.Representatives of Goldman, Bank of America,Citigroup and Jefferies declined to comment. It’s not unusual for banks to adjust their risk controls as market conditions change.The measures may change the fortunes of retail investors lighting up Reddit message boards with their forays into day trading. Increased margin requirements could hasten the short squeezes small investors have been rushing to capitalize on. On the other hand, if hedge funds pull back on short bets due to the new restrictions, the Reddit crowd won’t have as many opportunities to chase short squeezes.Archegos FalloutMany brokerage firms have been re-examining their risk controls after some of the industry’s largest prime brokers were forced in March to liquidate the multibillion-dollar portfolio of Bill Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management at a discount, though Bank of America and Citigroup were among those that escaped the saga unscathed. The little-known family office collapsed after making a series of wrong-way bets on media and technology companies."

I believe AMC just came out with its own Crypto Currency. That should boost the stock.
Shorts haven’t covered. Period. I will sell after they cover. Period
why most recent comment is 1 week old? WTH post broken
"I made a long post a couple of days ago, and I will reiterate a few points here, particularly for our new apes. Nowadays, until the squeeze happens, AMC stock has nothing whatsoever to do with the overall market or company fundamentals. Anyone who brings this up is distracting you in the hope that you would panic and sell. I am holding my shares. I admit that it is much easier for me to hold, since I've been in this since 13 dollars, and whether I see 50 dollars gain per share or 45 or 55 is all great. But if you got in at 40s, 50s, even 60s, fear not my fellow apes, much brighter days are ahead. Remember, if AMC fundamentals did play a role for now, the stock would've dropped already, since it's been three weeks that we've been in the 50s. If HFs and some of the mainstream media that echo negativity and FUD could drop the stock, they would've succeeded by now, but they haven't. Ask yourself why in the world then is AMC trading at near 60s. What could possibly be the reason? Why hasn't it dropped to 30s or 20s already. Again, the answer is rather simple. Vast majority of apes are holding and winning. There are a few HFs that are long AMC, and they are winning and not selling. The volumes that you see are high frequency traders and probably short HFs that volley shares back and forth, but at the end of the day, AMC continues to slowly but surely rise because we have new apes that are buying and holding. Week by week we are rising. What then, if not AMC fundamentals or overall market, matters when it comes to AMC stock. I think the answer is apes buying and holding, causing some FOMO, and more importantly some gamma squeezes, that is causing AMC to continue its meteoric rise (just zoom out and look at weekly chart). Where do we go from here. My opinion is that we'd break a few technical barriers, and go above the sore points for HFs, which apparently seem to be in the 62 to 65 dollar range, considering how many times we've come close. Once we clear the 65ish range, and close above that, the next would be mid 70s. It takes a couple to a few of barriers that we need to cross before you see sudden jumps that'll cause circuit breaks, and before you know it, short squeeze(s) will happen. Keep in mind that not all HFs will necessarily cover at the same time, so don't assume that once you see a short squeeze that, say, takes the stock from 70s to 100 (for example), that this would be the end of short squeeze and game over after this. No, there could be multiple such rises and a series of short squeezes over several days. In fact, it is entire possible that we may see a very persistent but drawn out squeeze that will take us into hundred over a longer period of time. Just keep your mind open, don't assume things, and play day by day, by being patient and committed. At the end of the day, do what is best for you, and do your independent research. Above is just my opinion and I am holding my shares until I become convinced that HFs have covered. One last point, I would not assume that after HFs cover, that the stock would necessarily drop to what it was a couple of months ago. Again, GME did go through one squeeze, and yes the stock did drop, but it was nowhere near as low as it once used to be, and in fact over a few subsequent months, GME grew back to above 300. I bet many people thought GME would never ever ever reach even above 100 (after it dropped from the peak of 483ish after the first squeeze), but clearly they were wrong. Same thing with AMC. I am convinced that this will have an incredible rise with huge gains for many apes, followed by a drop, but I don't think it'll drop to teens. I think it will be much higher and may continue to rise again. GLTA (except shorts. haha)."

"Good Morning All! I see there is no shortage of ""OMG this is taking so long"" FUD here this morning. I will hold a position in this company forever, beyond a squeeze, cause I support the company and also the freedom of being able to watch great movies on the big screen as originally designed. In-theater movies are our family thing on birthdays - each choses the one they want and everyone goes along. I will do my part to support that tradition whatever it takes. If this never got to be anything but a $25 stock spinning off an eventual dividend, I can live with that. Obviously much bigger things are in store, but wanted to share my thoughts. Patience is key and wish all of you lots of it (along with much wealth and good health, of course!) Have a good day and feel free to join me in the pond!"
"Brief synopsis of AMC:$AMC conversationIn 2013, AMC added 500 million shares of which they used none until 2016, In 2016, AMC issued not 1/3, not 1/4, not 1/5 of the 500 million shares they added in 2013. They issued a small amount.In 2016, AMC acquired three movie theaters/cinemas for billions and took on the debt to become the largest movie theater chain in both the world and the United States. In a strategic move to reduce the competition, AMC acquired Odeon Cinemas, UCI Cinemas, and Carmike Cinemas in 2016.,In 2019, AMC theaters posted positive EBITDA and reported 33% YOY growth and outperformedthe competition.In 2020, AMC was required to shut its doors due to the pandemic. Where many other companies received millions of government assistance in the form of the PPP (Cares Act/Paycheck protection program), AMC received zero but was still required to make payments to employees that they kept on despite not being able to generate any revenue. Without generating any revenue, the company continued to process payments for expenditures.As of 2021, AMC retired $ 600 million of debt and restructured existing debt by converting fixed rate of interest into a floating rate and eliminated the high interest rate and LIBOR. A significant amount of debt for AMC is not due until 2026. AMC raised capital prior to the Reddit runup and had $ 1 billion in cash on its book as of March 2021. They claim they have plenty of cash to get them through the remainder of 2021."
"in my opinion, fundamentals DON'T matter with AMC right now. This is a gamma squeeze and short squeeze play. But the squeeze hasn't started yet because shorts haven't began to cover. I'm wondering how shorts can possibly buy to cover an estimated 1 billion synthetic shares if retail investors aren't selling. Yikes! This is gonna moon."
"Ortex Twitter … Saturday, May 15th “A #ShortSqueeze signal was generated based on the recent price increase and the high shorting level in $AMC”“Historically, #ORTEX's best performing trading signal is the EPS family of signals. #AMC had an EPS signal triggered yesterday.”"

"just added my first 100 shares, love to the community.Copied in:Good morning all, A very nice day yesterday indeed. well done. There seems to be a lot of anxiety today about the squeeze. Relax, there is one item on today''s agenda and only 1. That is to keep the share price as high as possible at the close. $55 would be a very good thing, $60 would be an amazing number. I know that looking at $61 this morning it is easy to say we are on our way higher. Expect an epic price battle today. I don't think the shorts and hedges are ready to wave the white flag just yet.I want to address the $60 price tag really quick. At a close above $60 there will be a requirement to cover around 50 million shares. Why is this important? Well if retail all hold, and we are all still holding and not selling even 1 share, and the institutions and insiders hold, there are not enough available shares to be purchased. That would lead several of those options needing to be covered with Ape shares and then the gamma squeeze kicks in and the price begins to head toward where we all would like for it be.HOLD EVERY SHARE. Buy what you can, be careful with your spending, nothing is 100% certain no matter how good it looks right now. Ignore the noise, it may very well get loud in here today.Feel free to copy and paste this as many times as you want. I have a feeling this post will be deleted much like several of my posts from yesterday afternoon.This is the way. I hold for you, you hold for me and together we go forward toward history.Enjoy the day."

"A short message to share in addition to all positive information from others in this board. 1. looking into the $AMC daily chart, a very clear volume-price divergence trend is shown in last three weeks. 2. this data shows a potentially very strong uptrend run in following days/weeks.3. apparently short squeeze seems delayed by some force, this has been tried hard to try to shake off the paper hands, to buy more time as much as possible, to reduce the power of squeeze, etc.4. major margin calls seem not starting yet, it can start at anytime.5. newly approved NSCC-002 seems not really being executed in practice yet, when it is effectively in action, changes will immediately show up.6. price strongly standing around this level (mainly around $50~$60) for three weeks looks very much like a consolidation before a big blowing up.7. it seems a lot of ""buy the dip"" and FOMO catching up in last a couple of weeks. 8. data shows still a lot of short attacks in last few days, hence price moves shows there has been no major sells from longs.Expectation will be that when the critical line is crossed, explosion follows,  time coming.

".E.E.Hey AMC Diamond hand Apes......1). As of July 31st, US debt ceiling suspension ends..... This is a bad news for the market, since it will create a lot of volatility & uncertainty in the market. But, great news for AMC stock.......2). When there is this type of volatility & uncertainty in the market, typically a Market sell off of blue chip stocks. Citadel owns about 6,2000 blue chip long positions. They must liquidate their long positions to cover their short position for AMC. I mentioned the latest NSCC-2021-010 about a week ago. This NSCC rule, hopefully will soften the market crash......3). There is about 5mm Ape strong & getting stronger with each subsequent day....... 4). Retail own more than 80% of the (legal) shares....I will touch on the synthetic shares below..... Robinhood accidently released the numbers of synthetic shares, by performing a simple calculation....(THIS IS FOR short sellers are still in denial & spread FUD about synthetic shares).......5). I estimated about 18 billion synthetic shares (BASED on my previous posts in the May FINRA & Fintel.io reports). Wes Christian estimated 9B - 26B synthetic shares...... 6). Apes own most of the synthetic shares or about 3,000% with 18 Billion synthetic shares. FINRA indicates 1.5 Billion or 300% AMC shares traded in the dark pool in May 2021. FINRA has NOT released the June report yet. But, you can estimate the June & July AMC shares traded in the dark pool via Fintel.io (BASED ON the 46.5 Million F-T-D shares for June compared to about 10 million F-T-D shares in May. In other words, according to Fintel.io, there are about 3.5 times more or roughly about (7 billion) AMC shares were traded in the dark pool in June 2021......7). We know the percentage volume traded in the dark pool was higher in June than May & higher in July than June. What is the number of shares traded in the dark pool in July, if there were 7 Billion shares traded in June? This was how I estimated 18 Billion synthetic shares as of end of July 2021...... 8). If the Fed/DTCC allowed these SHFs to continue creating more synthetic, the synthetic shares will obviously go further NORTH. The more the naked synthetic shares, the higher AMC will go......9). AMC will be the biggest margin call in the history, imo (as I previously mentioned)......10). Additionally, we have seen the DTCC frantically filed dozen of the latest NSCC rules to force liquidation for the SHF. Furthermore, hundreds of $billion Reverse Repo for days & finally, Reverse Repo surpassed $1 Trillion last week....... 11). Massive accumulation of AMC shares by the Long institutions recently, including the pension funds. (There are many other reasons I previously mentioned).....12). The NYSE president's statement that AMC SP does not represent its true value due to supply & demand. The current AMC SP is an ILLUSION......13). Accordingly to Fidelity, the buy orders is 3:2 ratio than sell orders......Many buy volumes are delayed & not executing since Brokerages like Robinhood route retail orders through Citadel & the dark pool.... 14). The only reason the SHF has been able to continue to manipulate the SP on the down trend was due to the Dark Pool, along with 7 other shorting methods by these SHFs. 15). Their days are numbered. We know the MOASS is inevitable. They can only delayed the squeeze until it blows.. Massive defaults are on the horizon. I am not going anywhere, until these SHFs cover. These are only my research and opinions. Do your own research before investing."
just to be clear longs can hold here because we didn't buy in margin because AMC became 100% margin requirement long time ago. only those borrowers of shares to short have to pay interest and get margin calls.. that's why we can hold and hodl..

"AMC is not a short squeeze. Ever since $72 all we have been told is $1000 and higher for AMC stock. And all the stock does is go down. The AMC Reddit community is a joke. If you post ANYTHING that suggests AMC will not be at least $1000 the moderators ban you for FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt). As a result all that the community members read is bullish. Anyone that doubts the stocks ability to make new highs is banned."

I surely hope we AMC investors can always remember that Yahoo Message Boards has been short cheating us - favoring the short selling hedgies by screwing up this message board month after month - today the messages are 5 months late. It's deliberate. Other boards are not screwed up like this one.

Check out real time trade stats by googling: ""Nasdaq AMC real time trades"" and you'll see all the trade orders are 100 share volumes every millisecond.

AMC has changed its fundamentals since the shorts got in… it has capital to spare blockbusters waiting in line and millions of customers who missed the big screen. Adding sport events etc and creating a viewing experience that differentiates it from Netflix. Having a short position will surely be reconsidered today.

I live with a bunch of roomnates that come and go and I am fully vaccinated, so any fear of going to the movies is void with me. I love ""Tge Movies"". I am just a squirel trying to catch a nut and have had the opprtunity to buy 65 shares of this stock with some money Ive saved. I will hold the stock in the lows as well as the highs. It's simply an investment I made as a means to have some hope and a little fun along the way. I believe I am not the only one doing this with this particilar stock. I also believe that's why it has a pretty strong base that really cant be shaken to easily. Lets see what happens."

All I can say is the CEO of AMC and his Exc team are brilliant!!!

"I feel like there are a ton of new and confused traders in here so I'm going to help explain what's happening...Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their #$%$ition. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their #$%$"

"It is sad for me to think this way about where this world and its people are going.....but.....myself knowing and belief that every business had started up with just an idea, a belief if you will. Even if the company or business is multi-million/billion dollar or not. And it took hard work for people to start up a business from scratch, and with hopes and dreams to make a profit from it, all along with the thoughts of helping out the economy, raising peoples spirits in some sort of way, or even being happy with what they are doing in life without making an impact on their life or wallet. At some point, everybody started out at ZERO $....and some made it big, some barely making it, and some still struggling. The point is you work hard in what you believe in, then somebody or company tries to tear it down for a quick buck! That is not the way it should be, that is not the way we should believe, that is not what we the people of the world should exercise! I would not want that on my conscience! Shorts and Hedges should stop, put themselves in other peoples situation, and think about what they are doing by ruining companies trying, and still trying to make it. They are not only ruining the companies they built, but ruining the peoples lives that actually made it a reality. I have put in what I could in support for #AMC...just because without movie theaters that we grew up with, and enjoyed, we would not have the warmth of sitting by a loved one watching a movie, a first date as a kid, even a first kiss, a place where everybody could be together and laugh, cry, be scared, without being ashamed or ridiculed...because we all were doing it at some point! We even would not have the moving forward technology we have today to watch movies at home if it wasn't for the film industry all together! It makes NO sense to me to ruin a company or lives for what took so long to build...even if mistakes were made and caused problems within their company. It happens...we are only human and we can only learn from it. If it was something I could believe in...this is a stock worth saving! Im in!"

"Without the squeeze, this is still a company that deserves a stock price of $140+. Seriously, a $60 billion market cap isn't unheard of. In fact, they are more deserving of a $600-$900 billion market cap. That would place the stock price at $1400 to $2000. If it were as big as apple, it would be up to $6,000 on its own merit. $14.03 share price is wildly undervaluing this great American company. Even without any kind of squeeze, this could get into the thousands. We all know this is going to squeeze though, so $100K and beyond is possible! If this squeeze is like others, we can expect it to last for a few days, even a week or two. Be ready. Be aware that the hedge funds will try to make you panic sell at a loss. If we hold they will lose."
"AMC spikes whenever the situation seems very bad. I have no idea why it happens, but it's always like that. I guess shorts take any opportunity to get out at cheaper price."
Why anyone would sell a stock with 109M borrowed shares and 100 utilization of shares baffles me.
"AMC investors: Paid shills out in droves and they would like to portray the image that they are here just passing through for no other reason but they are compassionate and concerned about their fellow man and woman.

"You can tell from EM and other pump and dump Ape reactions that they are way overextended into AMC. My guess is they bought on margin. The entire revenue for movie theaters (including ads and concessions) was 19B at its highest. The average valuation for movie theaters is ~1x EV/sales. That means that Apes have valued AMC as being more valuable than the entire movie theater industry in the US despite having below average industry margins and returns. There also won't be a short squeeze because the cost to borrow is too low, FTDs are not high (implying no naked short selling), and there are millions of shares available to borrow."

However, AMC pays no dividend, so the carrying costs-- margin interest-- are very minimal. Imagine the cost of a short position in AT&T, which currently pays a hefty dividend yield of 7.7%. Here is an example of a stock you don't want to short because of the very high carrying costs."

"The Apes can't refute these facts. If the Apes respond, notice how they can't refute the points, they just call names 1) The CEO is selling shares2) Members of the Board have already sold shares3) AMC's SEC documents warn investors that the stocks trading is divorced from fundamentals4) The cost to borrow and days to cover is low - That's not conducive to a short squeeze5) The spikes in AMC occurred because of options gamma squeezes. This is not something that happens when the implied vol on options contracts is 100-150%6) AMC was losing money before the pandemic and will be losing money even if revenue recovers to pre=pandemic levels. This is because of the additional high cost debt AMC added during the pandemic. 7) More mid tier content is flowing direct to streaming and bypassing theaters completely 8) The period that theaters have exclusive rights to new films has shrunk from 90 days to 45 days. This will cost theaters ~3-5% of revenue based on historical revenue generation patterns 9) Naked shorting is not happening at the moment. The FTDs are low (you can find this on the SEC website) and the incentive isn't there for market makers given the low cost to borrow and the billions of available shares that can be loaned. 10) AMC is looking to issue additional stock. You can find this disclosure in the company's SEC documents"

I heard about AMC the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"So, I understand that without a squeeze we will rise to about $75 before December 31st? that's pretty good. I will take that. Might see $50 before Friday thanks to Halloween movie mania."

"Reposting from Art: $AMC conversationReposting from Art: MUST READ — JUST PUBLISHED BY CNA FINANCE. Link is in comments.AMC Entertainment (AMC) Stock Will FlyAMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) is a stock that has become the black sheep of Wall Street as of late, with article after article, warning investors that they should stay away from the stock at all costs.But how did one of the most successful movie theaters in the world become the black sheep of Wall Street? Was it COVID-19? You would think, but no!The fact is that short sellers have been passing around a silver platter filled with bovine feces and telling investors that it’s quality due diligence. They have convinced even the experts that AMC stock is going to fall to zero. They’ve urged retailers to stay away, all while their short positions resulted in significant losses for the very investors that they say their reports are designed to protect.Well, I’m going to get quite a few experts upset with me here, but the fact of the matter is that you can’t blindly follow names like Citron and Hindenburg research, like many covering AMC stock have been doing.The War Wages OnRecently, retail investors have shown they’ve had enough of the hedge fund manipulation through short positions that rob small investors of the value in the stocks they care about. The war became clear when GameStop went for a tremendous run for the top, essentially becoming the figurative symbol that retail investors painted on their chests before going to war.Since, we’ve seen short squeezes on several stocks, and in my view, it’s just the beginning.AMC Is The Next BattlegroundThe tension between the bears and the bulls is heating up when it comes to AMC stock. To be fair, I’m going to outline both arguments here:The BearsThe bears have a relatively simple argument. They argue that movie theaters in general have been losing their luster over the years, and that the COVID-19 pandemic will be the final nail in the coffin for these businesses.Moreover, the bears say that while various movie theaters are opening back up, fears surrounding COVID-19 will keep sales at a minimum, ultimately handing these companies a financial weight that none of them will be able to hold up.Ultimately, the bears say that at the moment, we’re experiencing the death of movie theaters as we know it, and that if you invest in these companies, companies like AMC, you’re going to experience losses.The BullsI want to be very clear here, if I haven’t been already. I am a believer in movie theaters. Moreover, I’m a believer in AMC and the company’s ability to rise from the ashes like the phoenix and that those with short positions should stop spreading smut about this opportunity.So, what’s the deal?The real deal here is simple. Movie theaters are an iconic form of entertainment that aren’t going anywhere any time soon. In fact, I believe that we’ll soon see a big uptick in revenue among movie theaters for two very big reasons, and that AMC will be a prime beneficiary of this activity. Here’s why:COVID Could Actually Revive The Movie Theater Experience. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers have been stuck at home. As vaccines get jabbed into arms, consumers aren’t just more willing to get out of the house, they will have a strong desire to do so. After all, it’s a whole new, and for the vaccinated, safe world out there. Why not explore again? With the movie theater experience being an iconic one in the United States, movies and dinner will likely become a major date night plan yet again. So, while short sellers say COVID will kill theaters, I say it has the potential to breathe new life into them.Summer Is Coming. Consumers being willing to travel couldn’t come at a better time for the movie theater industry. Summer is the time when the biggest blockbuster releases come, and with summer just around the corner and vaccines finding their ways into arms, there’s a strong chance that we’re going to see a significant boost in revenue among movie theaters.Beyond the fact that movie theaters are likely to make a big comeback very soon, the company is sitting on a solid financial foundation. Even through all the pain, AMC has plenty of cash on the balance sheet, with the CEO telling investors that the company has no plans to sell a single newly issued share in 2021. That’s a strong statement from a company that bears say can’t afford to survive.The Next Battle Is Coming SoonI recently wrote a post about a short squeeze that’s likely coming to AMC stock, and it was met with quite a bit of feedback from both sides of the coin. I got praised and cursed tens of times throughout the day. It’s clear that emotions surrounding the stock are high, and those high emotions are likely to lead to explosive movement.Chances are, that movement will be in the upward direction."

I love the Stock #AMC will be buying more in the morning and every opportunity I can for the next few years
There is a lot of fud out there. Matt has cleared up a lot. The SEC report card contradicts itself in some areas so there is likely to be further news yet. Diamond Hands here.
I'm hearin rumblings about a possible $AMC $NFLX merger is the announcement AA has?
Can anyone explain to me why there’s a discrepancy of about 300k trading volume difference from 2pm pacific time and 5pm pacific time. This not the first time on AMC stock.
"Serious question....please discuss onlyNot to single out Citadel, but using only as an example. WHY do entities like this ALWAYS pit themselves against bullish sentiment? Another way of asking, why is Citadel constantly fighting against retailers who want to see a company succeed...in this case, AMC? I ask this question seriously. If a company is poised or destined for failure, I understand shorting it. But time and time again, it APPEARS that entities like Citadel exist only to destroy companies, even if they are poised to be successful. Personally, I find this practice highly unethical...possibly criminal....particularly if unfair (or illegal) tactics are used to unlevel the playing field. Anyway, this is where I will stop with my opinion and welcome yours. What say you?"
As more quality movies come to theaters and the crowds returning continue to grow AMC will continue to recover to past market values..JMO GLTA..
Shorts said sell at 33.I didn't and now I'm laughing at them!
I am so tired of AMC doing nothing all day. Can you move??? I have been reading http://alert-sounds.com/ for a month now and the stocks there actually go!

"Board still broken, and I'm still holding, back to HOOD board to communicate with AMC holders :)"
Great news on amc today but yet it dropped like this ? Yeah okay lol
"Basically trading side ways...this is perfect with low volume. Not getting much lower, the only option soon will be for the shorts to cover. Once that happens, the exponential rise begins.Amc is the $hood"
"It is easy to hold when your position is at loss.. real test will come when prior to earnings day if $AMC is trading @7/8/9/10 and you see green and you see scary messages on earnings and you sell. This will give shorts opportunity to cover. Just hold or if it falls below 5/4 after ER just add more. If we hold until after ER, squeeze is imminent."
AMC should be allowed to go to bankruptcy court. Frontier communication did it and it was operational the entire 18 months in bankruptcy. Now it has less debt a clean balance sheet and adding new fiber services. Charter did the same. Lots of companies emerge stronger. If not then all you shill haters will get ready to pay up and prop up this giant octopus.
"Over 385K reactions on $AMC conversation on Yahoo! Finance. We have an incredible amount of support from fellow retailers who want nothing more than to be able to participate in the market when abnormalities like the SI, manipulation and bashing of AMC have been taking place for months now. Well now is the time retailers, let's add more pressure to this pressure cooker: let's buy more and hold what we have. We all know that the company is doing better from a fundamental point of view, the shorts are in deep, deep trouble and are beyond desperate to change the current positive sentiment to a sour one rooted in fear of loss of a squeeze. Well we are not going to give them the attention they so desperately cry for - they would screw all of us over in a heartbeat to make $1 if they had the chance (they probably have already).We have the upper hand here, let's keep it and let's keep our stock and add to our holdings."
"In my opinion we are stretching ourselves too much. To many stocks on the board. We should as a group select the stocks we want to work with to control the supply. It stated with $GME. And has gone too wild. I thought we were focusing on $BB, $AMC Now every day new stocks appear and were spreading ourselves thin."
"WOW! How many times today did I hear that this was going to be taken down or it was going to close red or it could even hold $38? Abby, Riaz, Elena, Turd Furgeson and John/Scott/Ghewala; all of you bashers... this is why I don't pay any attention to you."
The board is made to look like the squeeze happened already. HFs haven’t covered
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Stocks-tracker.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"if you are questioning your conviction simply look at the institutional 13F filings there are so many financial entities that bought shares at the 33-36 dollar level and if they are reporting it now, it is still in their portfolio, this means they didn't sell when it went up to 70 and didn't sell at any point on the way back down to this level and are not likely to sell unless it goes higher than the previous top"
"Quit buying options, they making money every week off of you! Buy the stock!"
"The $phun is over, back to the basics $AMC"
"$AMC is a buyMONDAY, if $AMC closes above $10 today all the calls expire in the money and market makers will be forced to buy shares back therefore on Monday the price would rocket starting the AMC short squeeze, copy and paste this so people know how long to buy and hold for!"
Bought 50 more $AMC in the premarket. RSI is low. Golden Cross. Bullish sentiment in the media/options market. This is going to do something big this week. The sentiment is strong.
"$AMC 69,420 is the floor once the first billion of synthetics is bought back, then it's to the Milky Way from there!!"

#AMC Seriously Gary Gensler and the SEC how much more evidence do you need to prove manipulation of a stock price?
"The squeeze doesn't START until today. Shorts have the option to close out in coming weeks (they're hoping the stock will drop again) but the longer they wait, the higher premium they'll have to pay when they finally close their position. THE SQUEEZE WONT BE IN FULL EFFECT UNTIL AT LEAST WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY NEXT WEEK! That's what I've understood from reading. Happy investing! $NOK $AMC $GME $NAKD $BB"
Epic short squeeze brewing in sls as they approach fda approval any day on cancer drug to treat 20 different types of cancer. 7 days to cover.

Sellas life sciences can 10-30x from 140m market cap here. Institutions been buying all year. Up from $3 to $8 now.
$40-$45 is going to be the next channel that AMC is going to trade in. More pain will be Incoming for the short sellers. I'm very bullish on this stock over the next 90 days.
$AMC algo showin jump up to $250 max by holidays..we'll see if hedgies change their techniques
Anyone notice higher high and higher lows
"I have this extreme phobia of crowded movie theaters, and I have discussed this mental ailment with my psychiatrist, Dr. Quack. He came up with the perfect solution. ""Mike, I can prescribe medication, but why don't you first try attending an AMC theater to see the latest version of 007? The movie has been a flop, and AMC theaters are generally empty venues. However, you must first find a theater still in business."" With replies like that, I immediately grasp why I pay Dr. Quack big bucks for his medical remedies. Speaking of crowded houses, I closed by Bitcoin position, and plowed all those profits into additional short positions in AMC. Coming to an empty theater near you: $4.99 AMC shares. $20 popcorn. $7- soda. $8- Milk Duds. It looks like the AMC shares will be within my budget in a few months."

AMC is going to erupt. Shorts be very careful. It’s happening.
Holding strong!
Actually it's a brilliant move. postponing the annual meeting and asking us to vote is very positive. Adam aron had the numbers but that numbers is still low when they done their counting. He is willing to bankrupt the short hedges once and for all. He had a hint that all this shares we are buying are all syntheric now. So he wants to make us to vote to add this recently synthetic shares to Amc's book. This is mind blowing. I could wait for another year to be multimillionaire. I'll sit tight and buy more of this synthetic shares. This would be great as I am turning 40 this coming August...this is my greatest gift to my kids.
"$AMC Predicting today's closing volume will be around 132 million..... Just looking at charts & numbers people!!!

"Freedom of Information Yahoo; please don't delete.The SEC must publish relevant information regarding the proposed Supplemental Liquidity Deposit Requirements (SR-NSCC-2021-002). This information can be found at their site. The Federal Register is the official publication site of related publications. I can't post the link (YF Guidelines) but you can search for Federal Register SR-NSCC-2021-002 for additional info.The SEC must post all comments received during the extended comment period. As of now, there are a handful of comments in favor of passing 2021-002. If you search for SEC Comments on NSCC Rulemaking you'll find the site to post a comment if you'd like to. I don't believe that we risk delaying the process longer by posting our support of the proposed rule change. It's possible that if the SEC continues to receive comments in favor of this rule change, implementation would be more likely. Comments must be submitted by May 31st. I haven't read every one yet but so far they are all from small retail investors. Perhaps an influx of support of the Supplemental Liquidity Deposit Requirements amendment would assist our cause. You know that the HFs are lobbying heavily against it. Their liquidity is in peril and they have everything to lose.Well informed is well armed.

short squeeze is oming... ready for new $amc
Test
"Remember, we hold to bleed them dry, NO MATTER how long it takes. They will say ANYTHING to deter us, but their words of ""encouragement"" are proof we still have the upper hand here. Some of you have no idea how much this movement can positively affect the market dynamic in the future; just HOLD! If the SEC deems this B.S. ""legal"", then so be it. The beauty about the market algorithm not getting edited to combat manipulation is it still allows the retail investors, when banded together, to FORCE squeezes on these hedge funds. Yes, they have the funds to drag their games out and make you THINK you don't have the upper hand, but that's just how the game goes. Buy, hold, go live life, and eventually come back to a very pretty profit. Good luck everyone!"
"All you need to do is keep questioning what is the paid shills motivethey are here posting by the hour, every day, every week, every month claiming terrible stock, going bankrupt, you must sell immediately.

I like how the only recent post is negative referring to a drop to 30s. I'm reading that as AMC to the moon as i scratch my head. let it ride baby.
"Robinhood users, Fidelity has 0 limitations to amount of shares you can buy for $AMC! I recommend switching over or at least opening another brokerage account and buying there. If Robinhood was limiting the amount of shares that could be purchased, this thing would be at $20+ already! HOLD!"
"We have been here everytime with $AMC right before every big spike. The usual strategy, shorts let it ride up a bit without manipulation and then heavily short ladder to inspire a panic sell.

!!! Please like this comment and respond so it gets to the top of the list !!!Big money managers and short sellers are going to manipulate the stock in the after hours session to scare retail holders and the general public into selling their shares. this will occur during after hours today and pre market monday. It is going to be inevitable that if we keep the price inflated they will evenutally have to cover the short postions they are holding which will in turn send the price up significantly please be disciplined and dont let emotion scare you out of a large profit. you may see at times mass gains and drops in price. good luck to all holders we have come this far have a great weekend and see you all monday
"Have shorts covered? No. Am I selling? Also no.Easy buy, easy hold"
Warning  Please Read This. Roku has a market cap over $50 Billion. Netflix has a Market cap over $250 billion. Disney has a market cap over $360 billion. The biggest movie theater chain in the world has only a market cap of $6 billion dollars. Yeah sorry you can’t convince me other wise that $AMC isn’t insanely undervalued.  even at $100 $AMC at a market cap of $45 billion will still be undervalued. They have 1 billion dollar cash on hand that can mean so many things they can do for growth and opening up more innovating theaters. They also have a huge chance to dominate their competition like Netflix or Disney.
"Just join in the battle yesterday. To all who is long on AMC, I have been told that I should set all of my shares at limited sale between a very high price range ($150 - $300), so the brokerage no longer can borrow my shares to the shorter to sale at the current price. I do believe this is right thing to do, I hope every one who own AMC will do the same thing, there will be no more shares available to sale on Monday, even if the shorter try to buy back their shares, they have to pay at much much higher price. Good luck to you all"
"$AMC as the SQUEEZE is inevitably upon us, please take into consideration the smaller accounts. The guys who have single digit, and under 100 shares. These are most likely the people working 9-5 struggling and trying their hardest to do their part. Let’s hold for them! #AMCSQUEEZE"

"Actually I am pretty impressed that shorties are still fighting with their full strengths, such as, ladder attack, naked short selling, bot spamming, bribe media and so on. Yes, they used to win with those tactics before but not anymore. Some people said it is David (retail investors) VS Goliath (hedge funds) but it should be other around since we have much more aggregated total funds than those hedge funds have. Beside, time is on our side since every second shorties are bearing interest cost exponentially and there are lots of pressure from margin call. TRUST THE PROCESS AND LOGIC. WE WILL WIN THIS WAR.

Go to the hood board for the latest info on AMC not a financial advisor
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Fairstox.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
"Today's SEC filing shows Vanguard's VEXMX fund has increased their $AMC holdings from 768,494 shares to 1,633,595 shares. That's 112% increase. The info is on fintel.io.Go figure."
"I did a little research today on AMC's price action on the day it hit it's all time high of $72.62 and it was on June 2nd but get this. If you look at the AMC chart on Yahoo using one day incrementsyou will only see a high price of $62.55 on the chart.You actually have to change the interval to 2 min intervals to seethe highest price of the day. You may find this hard to believe but it's true. The price was rapidly rising from $49.00 at 12:00 noon.Then all hell broke loose for the shorts and AMC was quickly up to $61.72 at 12:26pm eastern on 3.5 million shares during that 12:24 to 12:26 span. By 12:36 the price pulled back to $50.56 but then, at 1:02pm it was back up to $59.82. From 1;06 to 1:08pm the price popped to $64.89 on 7.6 million sharesand by 1:10 it hit $66.84 on 8.11 million shares, during that 2 minute span.Finally by 1:12pm it hit $72.32 on 9.83 million shares, during that 2 minute span.By 1:22pm the price was back down to 59.73 and AMC closed that day at $62.36. I am pointing this out so that you can see there are actually very few shareholdersabove $60.00 and that move to $72.63 was very short and sweet.Keep this in mind everybody. There will be very little upside resistance from people selling out of higher positions or so I believe. GO LONGS..!"
The Media can't get enough of $AMC... The whole world could be buyers of this... $500k is NOT unrealistic given the amount of momentum here https://lussosnews.com/amc-stock-is-breaking-out-again-what-you-should-know-this-time/
"This is only my thoughts and really does not amount to much. I never chat any other stock other than AMC. I write this for only those who have followed me since AMC was under six dollars. I bought something called PALT the other day at seven zero three price. PALT - Small float. Profitable company. Law suit against big company. Possible takeover target. What's not to like? That was what I scribed. It is a small company, very small float. Getting in and out can be tough. You would not want to own much. It could run above ten this week on any kind of volume. If you get in, make a few points and get out of most of what you own. Keep a small amount in case of a buy out. That is if you buy at all. I do not care. I am not a tout. I am just sharing a small stock with what I think is a small opportunity. Always do your own DD (Due diligence), never rely on others to do your work for you. Nothing good can come from this. On AMC, the MOASS is still in play. Today will be a light day on volume. It is a waiting game on AMC. In my opinion, stay away from options, just own the stock. Think about this longs, or those considering going long, do you think in a week from today APPLE, or TESLA, or MICROSOFT, or PROCTOR AND GAMBLE, or any other big name stock, could double in a week? Probably not. AMC, if it takes off in price, passes mid eighties, would probably trigger the MOASS and go over two hundred very quickly. How many under forty dollar stocks have that potential? I've had my say, happy Columbus Day."
"Today is the day the hedge funds bleed out. Total short interest in $AMC is over $1 Billion. The short interest ratio is over 30%. SSR is still in effect. Robinhood allowing 5,500 shares of the stock today. Oh, and Elon Musk defended us... not a financial advisor. I like the stock"
"For the past two days massive market sell-off and both AMC and GME managed to be in the Green. AMC closed at $8.05, up 0.04 cent from last Friday. The good news we have roughly 110k call options IN THE MONEY. Don't be too discouraged by the flat price, it's irreverent right now, our motto has always stayed the course to force the HF's to trigger a short squeeze. It's coming sometime in this century.$5.50 - 18,982 contracts$6.00 - 32,473 contracts$6.50 - 17,836 contracts$7.00 - 20,619 contracts$8.00 - 15,250 contracts = 110k In The Money$9.00 - 15,156 contracts$10.00 - 32,273 contractsThese call options will have 3 business days to be satisfied and settled (T+3) by Wednesday 4pm, or they will be treated as Failed To Deliver, the HFs will be paying interest on any Fail To Deliver and as of this writing it's 11.7%, I'll bet anyone by next Wednesday interest rate will be 13%+. With over 108 million shares on loan plus today's options expiring ITM and millions of more shares may not be settled by Wednesday, they are paying an interest rate of 11.7% and going up by the days just how long do you think the hf's will hold it out?I want to be very clear on this issue with everyone, some of these options were covered today or they will be covered soon, we just don't know the number, but I don't think the HFs will be covering them all and if they do it will reflect on the share price on Monday - Wednesday. Also, NOT ALL options will be exercised, some buyers may just sell them off for a profit. Personally, I would exercise them and forced a power play on the HF's.4th Quarter Earning Report:On Wednesday, March 10th, AMC will report 4Q earnings report in the after hour. There is absolutely no chance of profitability here, don't look for it or expect it, the only question is just how bad? I have been studying earning reports for years now and profit and net loss are irreverent, the magic number that everyone will be looking at is the ""Future Guidance"", where AMC sees itself 6 months from now, earning and opening, etc. Countless times when a company reported a solid profit and missed future estimate shares tanked anyway, vice visa, sometimes company posted a quarterly net loss but report solid upside growth in coming months shares go up.We all know where AMC will be in 6 months from now, and that's fantastic news for us. The only way to STOP AMC from reopening 60%-90% complicity is the resurgence of Covid-19, I doubt the would happen with more vaccines available to the public. So I am expecting another massive net loss for AMC but strong """"""future guidance"""""", so we'll have to wait and how that played out. IMO, AMC goes up 20%+ in AH or the next day. I bloody can't wait to see KING KONG punch Godzilla in da face on the big screen.Highlight from CEO's Adam Aron interview on CNBC today March 5th:1. Raised $2.2 billion CASH before January 2021.2. More than enough cash to last a long time. NO bankruptcy in 2021.3. The Most important comment ""I see good times ahead"".4. Go watch the interview on YouTube."
"Here is a little earnings education for our basher friends. The EPS (earnings per share) is expected to be -.08 compared to -8.41 last year or -.79 the previous quarter this year. That is huge! That is a great earnings report, due to increased revenue. This will drive FOMO buying naturally even without the pending squeeze.AMC is the $hood $bac"
I just wanted to say big shout out to whoever pumped the shiattt out of this stock and provided me with beautiful cap gains. Love you longggggg timeeee. Now back to $AMC and $GME which are the real plays.

AMCX 29mil share float double the short% seems an easy squeeze
"Amc ended last week with $8.01, ended this week $8.05. Short interest Went through the ROOF this week at a whopping 11.7% (and counting) for the Bears. If you’re new to investing this is GREAT News and WILL lead us to the Gamma Squeeze, leading to a Short Squeeze. It may not look like it, but Progress Was Made, a LOT of progress was made. Buckle up everybody, next week is gonna be A very Good week for AMC shareholders. Oh by the way, those 50+ million shares failed to deliver? Yeah, they didn’t disappear. They ARE going to be paid eventually. Like I said, bears pay interest for failing to deliver "
Gamble with the 2 billion on the balance sheet. Great idea for the shareholders. Show TV on the big screen....even better.
"Have you eve noticed how ocean waves will slowly erode a sharp precipice, and then without notice, the cliff comes crashing down into the raging surf? I have seen this occur twice in Bolinas, California, a trust fund hippy and surfing enclave north of the Golden Gate Bridge. The San Andreas Fault also passes directly underneath Bolinas. With the analogy of unstable earth, I expect to see similar behavior in AMC common shares. When the foundation (mere hype and hot air) suddenly gives way, AMC sell volume will explode. I patiently await 200,000,000 shares in a single day of AMC trading when the apes vainly attempt to exit this travesty. Meanwhile, the AMC cliff just erodes little by little. Heaven forbid that a 7.8 earthquake should occur. Bolinas is overdue for such an event, the last major tremor being the 1906 earthquake. The AMC earthquake likely occurs much sooner."
"Imagine if $sndl and $amc pop at the same time....oh lord, what will I do? 61,113 shares of SNDL."
Market DOWN big time in pre-market.... Are the Hedge Funds liquidating other stocks to prepare for the squeeze?? $AMC is the only stock I have that is in the green this morning... Hmmmm...
"The shorts get so exited when the price is down 3% in pre market just to be bought back up before market opens to green! We are already up 400% this month, who is really winning here!"
Who bought $72.62?
Markets are going down because the hedge funds are selling to shore up their overleveraged short positions in AMC GME BB and other stocks they're sold out on.
I have stopped going on here and commenting cause it always shows days old comments. But I haven't sold people. I've added 43 shares on this dip we've had. Not giving up on this
Not selling until the $PROG 5yr chart look like the $AMC 5yr chart. No fixed PT no stop loss. Just riding the wave.
"I'm already heavily in $AMC. Today's decisions for me are either Buy and HODL. But oh my, I'm feeling FOMO and I definitely will panic buy!  Hope you shorts had some great rest and sleep this weekend, you soon will definitely be resting in peace soon "
numerous yahoo finance articles bashing the hell out of AMC today. that's all i need to see to embolden me to buy another few thousand shares monday morning. yahoo is beholden to the hedge funds and is required to do their bidding. AMC will be extremely active this coming trading week as more and more people are coming to the realization that the AMC short squeeze is a once in a lifetime opportunity. the opportunity to tap into generational wealth. do your due diligence and buy what you can afford. you'll be glad you did.
Check out Charles Payne interviews on YouTube for some insight on Citadel’s legal issues….oh Kenny you’re going down & AMC going to da mooooon!!

Very little membership growth in AMCStock reddit and WSB. Social media posting volumes are down and perhaps more importantly the implied vol on AMC options is too high for a gamma squeeze to be executed. Apes have also lost tons of capital speculating on just out of the money short term AMC options. Can't wait to see the overextended Apes that bought on margin respond to this post. EM? What do you say?
"AMC IS a TRADING STOCK for just-one day at a time!!! IT IS not a BUY & HOLD STOCK!!!PURELY A GAMBLE... It is Hyped by Disliked Gang called ""APES"". When SEC Arrest their Gang ring-leaders.. Whole Thing Collapse.... SWITCH TO AAPL, BB, JEF, MSFT... Do your DD first."
By now they should realize AMC holders are not falling for HF miss leading info. We all here for the long run. Buy more and hold.
Here is APE's Checklist.Did margin calls happen yet? Nope? Hodl.Did hedge funds buy back their shares? Nope? Hodl.Has there been a massive liquidation and market collapse? Nope? Hodl.Is Citadel closed due to bankruptcy? Nope? Hodl.Is the price for $AMC over 100k? Nope? Hodl.
4 million people went to the movies this past weekend! AMC strong . Keep holding. Keep buying.
$AMC investors are gonna have the best Xmas of their lives in 2021! Get ready! 
"$AMC as the SQUEEZE is inevitably upon us, please take into consideration the smaller accounts. The guys who have single digit, and under 100 shares. These are most likely the people working 9-5 struggling and trying their hardest to do their part. Let’s hold for them! #AMCSQUEEZE "

"$AMC... Man Of The Hour: David Portnoy (BARSTOOL founder & president) today on Fox Business.... Invested $2mil (paid top dollar) in the heavily shorted stocks yesterday to support the cause... YES, he is in $AMC for the long haul, he said. By the end of the day yesterday, he was down $700,000. Today, at the time of the interview, he was only down $200,000 but said he is still in for the duration.... He said, and I quote: ""Robinhood STOLE money from its clients""... BRAVO David Portnoy... YOU get it!!!.... PLEASE LIKE and or cut and paste to keep it at the top.... EVEN AOC and Ted Cruz agree on what RH did was wrong.... Congress is meeting on it as we speak.... Oh.... EVEN Mark Cuban supports the cause.... :)"
I heard a rumor netflix is interested in a merger with amc any thought netflix board here
"Share some of my opinions here. Very sadly speaking, I think a Gamma + Short squeeze to $AMC may be coming, may be right ahead of us. I just looked at AMC option chains, data about shorts, share flows, recent price moves, and trading picture last week. I still cannot find any reason to deny this feeling in my mind. I am a long, so this just gives me a feeling that I never had before. Let's all keep focusing on the price moves in following days/weeks, and see what will be happening."
Anyone coming here to ask for help for other companies right now we are sorry but we are dedicated to AMC at this time ! AMC is our number 1 priority! When the squeeze is done with will listen to other investments options ! Have a nice weekend !
