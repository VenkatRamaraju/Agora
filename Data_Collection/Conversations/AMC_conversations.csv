short squeeze is oming... ready for new $amc
I don't intend to talk much but I am holding until the share price jumps like game stop. the hedge funds can play their games but eventually they won't be able to do anything to keep this share price down...
Holding strong!
$AMC investors are gonna have the best Xmas of their lives in 2021! Get ready! 
"Breaking News: $AMC most heavily traded stock in dark pools confirmed by Citadel lawyer. SEC implementating restrictions to dark pool trading to prevent further price manipulation. In addition, brokers such as Fidelity ensure retail trades are not going through the dark pools. This is huge! This will accelerate the short squeeze tremendously.Congrats to all new buyers and investors!"
Community strong!
We respectfully ask for a warrant to arrest Ken griffin and his subordinates in federal court. You have 10 business days to offer the warrant or march in protest to sec building in Washington d.c.
AMC has changed its fundamentals since the shorts got inâ€¦ it has capital to spare blockbusters waiting in line and millions of customers who missed the big screen. Adding sport events etc and creating a viewing experience that differentiates it from Netflix. Having a short position will surely be reconsidered today.
Yahoo! has been so bad lately - especially the AMC board. I like using http://alert-sounds.com/ now instead for my daily research.
"I could not resist buying more $AMC and $GME today, fridays are great for picking up discounted shares"
The shorts can't do anything but complain to each other.I'm stacking up plenty of cash for more AMC shares Beaches.
looks like another opportunity to buy more shares in pre-market...

I think today is going to be a good day for #AMC stock!
Go to the hood board for the latest info on AMC not a financial advisor
Robin Hood misses rev. Estimate. Will AMC able to hold tomorrow? Risk is high
HF's shorting a lot of fake shares. Make them pay
"Serious question....please discuss onlyNot to single out Citadel, but using only as an example. WHY do entities like this ALWAYS pit themselves against bullish sentiment? Another way of asking, why is Citadel constantly fighting against retailers who want to see a company succeed...in this case, AMC? I ask this question seriously. If a company is poised or destined for failure, I understand shorting it. But time and time again, it APPEARS that entities like Citadel exist only to destroy companies, even if they are poised to be successful. Personally, I find this practice highly unethical...possibly criminal....particularly if unfair (or illegal) tactics are used to unlevel the playing field. Anyway, this is where I will stop with my opinion and welcome yours. What say you?"
"#AMC - A potential partnership with Netflix?   Also, institutions are still buying."
Today this board is two weeks late instead of four months late
