"One of the lowest volume days in weeks. What does that tell you? The shares are drying up and less and less are selling as we set up ourselves for an amazing pay day. Yes, we all wanted it yesterday but its more stable today than a few weeks ago meaning once it takes off you can forget about the original $100-$145 target . That will be dust. I can't see the HF's fighting this any further next week. How can they when they can't find enough shares to cover. If they do, more money in our pockets. Like many of us have said, we have plenty of time and it isn't costing us anything other than watching them squirm."
"The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that it fined Robinhood $57 million and ordered the online brokerage to pay approximately $12.6 million in restitution, plus interest, to thousands of customers for a total settlement of $70 million."
"This is WAR, folks. Nobody ever said it was going to be easy. But this WILL bounce back. Just buy what you can afford to, and keep holding strong!!"
Hey! Great day. We ended in Green. Was expected. We were fighting a computer..that wouldn't let us break $60. It's hard to beat a computer in chess so imagine what we are fighting. The time is coming when we will see the promised land and we will all be super uber rich and we can buy everything we ever wanted and be so happy. Quit our jobs and find new boyfriends. But we must all buy and hold. Buy the dips and hold. We are doing so good!
"I have not posted in a while here but wanted to share this todayOutstanding news to report from Ortex today. Finally something to smile about.As of close Monday shares on loan has as I predicted crossed the 100M markSHARES ON LOANCurrent100.39m Why is this important? Well yesterday shorts added over 2M more shares to the on loan til. So with 80% of market data reported, Shares on loan is sitting between 102.5M and 103M.This puts us right in line with where we were at the end of May. Realize that AMC went on to add another 12M shares to the overall total first week of June so I am sure that shorts picked up some of those.Next this is super important and again this is as of Monday close.% FREEFLOAT ON LOANCurrent19.62% - Now once again keep in mind the additional 2M yesterday, this is extremely close to the 20% free float on loan which should signify all legal shares to borrow are gone or very close to being gone.Here is the most important item now to keep an eye on.UTILIZATIONCurrent91.89% - I would think after yesterday this is closer to 93% or 94%. This will ramp up if shorts are not able to borrow more and must utilize the short shares that are in their possession.Based on the numbers we are seeing now on Ortex it looks like shorts are making one final push to drive down the price as low as they can get itThe available shares on Stonko Tracker seem to be correlating with the data from ORTEX as only 400K shares were available to borrow earlier this morning. Yesterday was the same, Stonko did not show more than 500K shares at any given time.Also based on review of Stonko Tracker to support this data I am presenting, Shorts have loaded up on borrowing ETF shares this morning. So to me it seems we need to keep an eye on the IWM ETF. This is the ETF LOADED with AMC shares and it seems to be where shorts have now resorted to borrow from today to offset the lack of short shares to borrow.If in fact shorts are at 20% of the free float on loan and we can force them to use the remaining unused short shares in their arsenal, we reverse this and regain control. I am beginning to think tomorrow and next week could be pretty interesting if these numbers are accurate."
170 mil volume mid day and only up 2%. Yeah ok.
I love this stock. Hoping for another big run up. In the meantime I’ve traded this 31 times since May. Best year I’ve had. It helps being retired and watching this all day. Wish I would have retired years earlier.
"Shorts have to cover nearly 3M shares each day this week. Otherwise, they will soon be forcefully liquidated. It's not costing me a penny to watch this drama unfold. Hedgies, you can keep buying in DarkPools. Keep selling in lit markets. Keep sending your army of bashers and Shills. Keep ladder attacking at noon. All your tricks and algorithms are now exposed. We now know for 200% certain that hedgies cannot cover their short positions. We gave hedgies plenty of chances to cover when it was at $10, at $20, at $30, at 40 and at $50. Now hedgies shall pay and cover at a price greater than $70."
I received a dividend last night. You know what that means…more AMC!!!
"We stay focus and we know our goal and target. Hold strong and buy a little or more if u can. I bought more today.The float and then some is all ours, and they need to cover Not for sale"
"Bear,This is for you to watch at night time or when you get out of school.

do you know why a lot of shills and bashers are here ? Because AMC hodlers are winning!!!
Looks like a blackout in the recent messages for this community. Seems like shorters and hedges are suffering
They will cover soon they won't find better price to
This period of consolidation is GOOD & very healthy. It’s happened before every major RIP we’ve had and just strengthens our position. HOLD LONG & STRONG & you WILL be rewarded!!!
"Sit back and think, if any stocks you own go down for a day, do you go publicize it on chat rooms? Probably not...Only people that do are paid..."
I am going to short this stock if it goes above $50. 511m shares floating will keep this in check withno wings to fly. short above 50 will surely making profit.
Back to 70$
I bought it $10 and I need it to be $1000 to get a new house!!!!
"I have no doubt about this stock. Look at how consistent the chart is. APES aren't selling. It's just a matter of time before we rocket up again. Could be next few weeks or a month, doesn't matter to me, it's inevitable."
The chart is showing fear for the shorts. Today was the day to make some damage.
$SOFI army will make a stand tomorrow! Everyone buy one share!!! $TSLA $AMD $AMC $GME $NVDA $NVTA
"AMC isn't about what the price per share is, it's about having shares when this takes off. Shares or no shares, who cares about the price. The math tells the story, just do the math."
Where in the world is Tony and Mr. Digby? Haven’t seen posts . Are you just chillin or are you being blocked?
"I bought 300 more shares today at $58.66, total now 1,500 shares. Steve R"
No one is happier than Adam. Jan net worth in stocks was 8 m. Now 270 m. Lol he will sell if he’s smart
Consolidation is key. Every dip is a buying opportunity. Been here for a while and holding for a couple of months. Our lows are getting higher! AMC is a winner.
"Forget today's price for a minute and just know shorts are burying themselves. They have borrowed almost 8 million shares today alone and they cant budge this much below 54.00 max. Short interest is increasing, utilization is rising, returned shares is shrinking.If anyone believes shorts have won today you are wrong. We are in control even on a red day.EstimatedShort Interest Change+4.54%EstimatedCurrent SI % of FF14.25%EstimatedCurrent SI72.9mReturned Shares3.64mBorrowed Shares7.76m"
Aren't a number of the Financial Media outlets guilty of intentionally misleading the public re the factual info re AMC?
"Look at the one month chart, there’s been a rejection at the 60-65 range/resistance weekly."
"Ok apies, your hourly update:We will drop her into the 56's shortly. Range control 56.00 to 57.3please plan accordingly"
Uh oh…someone thinks shorting AMC might be risky https://www.schwab.com/margin-updates
SHORTS are trying to COVER. I AM NOT SELLING TO PUSH SP UP!!!
The Longer Shorts Wait...The Bigger The...

If RH cannot interfere like last time during the squeeze is it possible we have less swings and more upward movement ?
"The current volume is just short of 70 million, our volume on Friday was 77 million, and we still have 3 and a half hours in the day market"
"If this stock was crashing it would be decreasing per day around -15% we are looking soo good,….expect a big push to 70$ soon"
AMC CAN AND WILL NOT BE DENIED..! We have proven that time and time again from just seven months ago at only $2.00 to over $60.00 again today.Why couldn't they stop us? The only possible answer is they can't or they would have. It's that simple Apes. Stick with the program because with each passing day it becomes more obvious... we're winning!Higher highs and higher lows for the last 3 days in a row..! Isn't that a fact? YES IT IS..!My prediction is just like it's always been over the past 6 months... APES will prevail.
"just hold your shares.. its easy. if you bought recently and sell soon, you owe the government half of your gains. Nobody should want to give government any more money, they can't manage what they already get"
Purchased 135 sharesMy friends purchased 1290 shares total this morning I am buying another 465 for a total of 600’shares with this dip.The other 10 guys are each purchasing 600 shares eachGreat day
"Some nice raises for US banks, I firmly believe when eligible $TD will raise its dividend by +20%This is because a raise of 20% brings their DPS to $3.80 and based on their trailing EPS of $7.77 is a payout ratio of roughy 49% which is between their target of 40-50%Their trailing EPS of $7.77 is based on 4 COVID Q’s. Their earnings per share will increase over the next 4 Q’s. it is actually not unrealistic for this DPS to be $4.20 in 2 years which is approx. 33% higher than today’s dividend. $TD only raises once a year unlike other Canadian banks, so these large increases are not unrealistic in my opinion. I think buying today is equivalent to buying a 2022 yield of 4.41% (DPS 3.80) and a 2023 yield of 4.90% (DPS 4.20)Not crazy high yields, however for a company that pays out less than 50% of their earnings and has a lot to gain from raising interest rates puts them in an excellent position. The 5 year trailing dividend average is 3.79%. based on my 2023 dividend per share projection of $4.20 that implies a share price of $111 (4.20/ 0.0379). That implies a 4.9% yield on today’s money with a 30% capital gain. Not firework YOLO returns like $AMC. however, when the party ends and valuations matter again, you’ll be happy owning something that you only paid 11 times earnings for."
We buy red and green knowing massive upside is coming. Stay the course. The mother of all short squeezes. A modest chunk. Buy and hold for financial freedom. We own the outstanding float
This will bring financial freedom and traveling the most beautiful places on earth
Haven’t been on yahoo finance in over a year and I don’t miss it. Just came here cos ST is down at the moment
soon
I have moved all my assets 23k in to AMC form SPCE while it's an only chance for me to go to the moon soon
Yahoo trying really hard to suppress AMC
That movie was overrated. Probably better to Wall Street. Way more accurate. Go $AMC.
I stopped using google because I’m tired of seeing Motley Stool articles.
why even read the articles that are being paid for by hedge funds
It’s always so hard to sleep at night being so enthusiastic knowing financial freedom is near. We celebrate red or green 420 style knowing shorts are drowning. Over leveraged institutions will poop themselves
Dark Pools being looked at. It’s only a matter of time before thing change.Gary Genseler himself is looking into Dark Pool trading link below he actually does read our twitter messages! let's hope he does the right thing for retail investors $AMC! https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1422896436228804613?s=19

"Now is the time to take a look at AMC's 3 month chart on Yahoo. Make sure you're lookingat the 200 day, the 50 day and the 10 day averages. You will see a very impressive pattern.The current price just spiked over the 50 day moving average and the 10 day may be bouncing upwards before it even breaks below the 50 day average. Tomorrow will be critical to stay engaged and watch the volume. This morning you could tell the run was coming because the volume level was so high it gave it away. We see that repeat tomorrow and we'll have theheadlines in every paper around the world. They are still crazy about AMC with planes in Korea flying AMC banners and people hanging AMC banners on the over-passes and waving to get the attention of commuters. It's a world-wide move that keeps getting bigger regardlessof what anyone says. See the 3 month chart and look at the 50 and 200 day. What are they doing? That's right... nothing but up. GO LONGS..!"
Where does Robinhood get the free shares? They have them in a vault or are they in the drawer with the blank checks?
Apes OWN the float and also OWN this & the HOOD chat boards! Cheatin’ Hedgies are surrounded!BUY & HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
Our mission continues it’s path to SUCCESS…with 2000+% gains YTD…Hedgies failing…short interest at nearly 20%…Apes OWN the float…I believe we’re doing just fine!Ignore the FUD…BUY…HOLD & WIN!HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
Almost 60 in pre market. The sweet lord is looking over us today
"Buy and Hold, $70+ this week.Huge buy volume."
We own the outstanding float we celebrate red or green knowing shorts are down billions. And the Short squeeze is 10/10 rating
Important for AMC investors to watch. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgfDtGXnmR4
Same action as yesterday I guess 3-5% gain to finished. Awaiting the day we get a 100-200% gain day
"-----AMC IMPORTANT COMMUNITY INFO-----As some of you know, I have been a part of this story since the beginning. I have made many posts and done my own DD accurately. Though I have been quiet for a while (due to work) let me stay this, and it applies to apes new (who got in at $70) and old (apes who got in at $3). We only got to where we are now because we were patient. We went from $18 to $5 and held. These pull backs and consolidation are part of a pattern and at the end of that pattern is always a major rip. So if it takes a few weeks of consolidation or dips so be it. The rips happen when you least expect it. My second point is the community.We have been invested in this mentally and physically long enough to understand what is going on. We have come together for a reason, we are made up of the common folk, united globally to take back what is owed to us. don't let them take this opportunity away from you, from me, from your neighbor or from someone across the world. Its the only weapon they have left and its the oldest and simplest weapon in the book... Divide and conquer...When you have interns from institutions working to spread FUD on chat rooms and false DD then that should only strengthen your conviction in AMC and that institutions are getting desperate...SO what is my point...No more infighting (not that I have seen much). No more uneasiness (and I speak from experience) about the day to day price action. No more stress because we all know how this story ends and its beautiful and meaningful. Waiting truly pays off (I again speak from experience) Love you all. To those of you who are uncertain. I'm up enough to buy a house in full and I got in originally at $18 back in January so imagine how long I had to wait. your time will come. I am holding for you and more importantly for our powerful unification of the common folk. This is going to happen when you least expect it... So why not not walls tree where is hurts and get rich off it at the same time? Regardless, much love and spread that love thought the community!-K(not financial advice, just my opinions and experience. please dont take advice from someone who eats crayons and only looks up and down before crossing the street)please spread this message on whatever social media you feel like, I know yahoo is deleting everything..."
Don't stare at the chartsSet alerts (not sell limits) and walk awayGo about your dayHave faithAs long as we don't give up ... we will winHave a 5 or 6 digit exit strategy in mindIt's a waiting game ... don't give up. Don't sell

wow desperate hedge funds still shorting just hold and buy
zoom out to 1 month. Looks like AMC has been pretty steady in the mid fifties for the month. a dollar up or down isn't bothering my Friday. I like this stock.
"Motley is accusing us Apes of manipulation. Affecting the price and thus defrauding other investors. Listen Motley, AMC has been in the news for months, EVERY wallstreet investor is AWARE of what’s happening along with retail. If the SEC won’t go after hedgies, what makes you think they have the fire power to come have millions of retail investors  your scare tactics fail on every logical level. Here’s a  for trying"
When we all buy at the same time does that help at all? Buying a few more at noon central time if anyone wants to join in.
"- Order Flow delay- Suppressing SI% by using synthetic shares to “close out” (they know we look at ORTEX and the like)- High Darkpool volume to manufacture “evidence” for closed out short position- T+X Settlement cycle to hammer the stock price downAs such, TLDR: they’ve used legal loopholes to short the stock using synthetically generated shares to the point where the shares outstanding is anything but what’s reported (27x is a number been thrown around a lot, so see if you can hunt that down). We can verify there is another digital repository and they’ve been delaying orders by following their footsteps (who knows by how long, by resetting FTD’s, sources above). We aren’t up against a single devil, we are up against potentially 3 and more smaller demons (think Citadel backing up Melvin, there are way more Melvin's) being guarded by these market makers, as they guard the capital of the 1% of America that laugh at the “stupid” 99% while rigging everything in their favor. D-Day has arrived, they will try to shake your conviction, if the vast majority of apes hold they will implode hard and you will have you xxxx price or xxxxx price.There is no concrete timeline, this would’ve been over by now if the psychological warfare was ineffective in their eyes but here we are."
I will hold all day and buy more on artifical manipulated dips. I know how supply and demand works.
"Well, Did we show the Hedgies today! They were their shorts.All these B. S. articles about the death of AMC and meme stocks etc...We'll  to the "
"So just a small correction today, or will it eat away at the last few days of gains?

love dip wit my chips .....
"115,000,000 shares traded and up .05%, is there anyone at the SEC not in bed with the HF or not “Working from home” is doing f all."
Any one else remember when a $2.00 down day would have been 40% down? Now it’s just a slight nuisance while we wait for the squeeze. HODL!
"Who do you trust ?( Motley, MarketWatch, seeking alpha) or (Charles fox, Trey, Matt, Jackson, Houston, Rocky, Mask investor, Review Dork, Roensch Capital, Kevin ....)Thought so "
Prediction time: $75+ tomorrow. $62+ pre-market. And um.... Lots of tissue boxes for my shorties.
they have no more shares to short... I foresee upward movement today
"When every media outlet is going out of their way to talk down your investment, yet you're holding the highest performing stock YTD, you're on to something special."

"Hey, guys. Holding for almost 7 months. I was in this sub since from the beginning and saw everything. May I offer advice? Why keep calm. You won.

Wondering what happens to AA moods, voting, ""fatigue"" (haha, monkeys aren't tired, we're more determined than ever) or something? This is what we are referring to. ""They're everywhere. Youtube, Twitter, Reddit, right here in the comments for a moment. Their job is to spread confusion, division, doubt, impatience and whatever else will make you give up. You won. They have to cover .All the shorts have to cover and they can't while holding.It's that simple.Of all the FUD and all the media spins NO single object has NEVER opposed our DD.Not once.They have never refuted our thesis.They can't The data supports it, as does the president of the NYSE, and if you zoom out and see the big picture, so does the DTCC and other regulatory banks, moving to damage control policies (you won. and if you like stocks like me). f. That's all it takes. Believe in AMC and you will be regret Hold strong next week is a big week"
Did anyone call citadel and ask what it’s going to close at today? Lol

What’s with the comment section here?
Shorts about to lose it all!!
"AMC made this list last Friday.What Is a Threshold List?A threshold list, also known as a Regulation SHO Threshold Security List, is a list of securities whose transactions failed to clear during the previous trading days. Threshold lists are published in accordance with regulations set out by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Regulators review this information as part of their efforts to detect market manipulation.This is the SEC trying to enforce the rules. Good for them & us."

let's GO
"Dear apes,New apes or old apes. I would like to remind you of some basic facts and focus point for this whole movement.1. It is a fact that hedgefunds have to cover at some point.2. For the covering our shares are needed.3 no one knows when it will happen could be Monday could be in a month could be 3 months Thea fact is that if the majority just doesn’t sells they will have to do it at some point.4 despite the facts that hedgefunds have money and power this like everything has its limits.5 Even if they would be borrowed 100billion they have legal obligation to BUY BACK OUR SHARES. greetings"
If they were shorting at and below $10 and it’s now $59 it’s pretty clear they don’t have the power and control they’re given credit for.
"NEWS OUT 40mins ago...latest facts on the short sellers on how much they lost yesterday!!

Community holding strong!
90% of my investments the biggest return came with holding at least a minimum of 3-4 weeks . Every time I sold for quick profit I lost out on even bigger
we will hit $70 today and battle for $65 close. my prediction. may go much higher though!

We buy and hold AMC for the moon or not at all

"We now need SEC to address the activities in dark pool, the fake shares, the failure to deliver. Gary Gensler (Chair, SEC) has not done a bad job in the few weeks he's been at the helm and he has said on record that he would like all the stocks traded on visible exchanges. Let's hope he keeps up the momentum and bring in regulatons to bring off exchange trading activities into line."

Yahoo still showing “most recent” posts as being from 5 days ago. They are proving their biased towards the HF’s with their illegal manipulation in this manner.
"As a novice investor, I find it interesting that most of the price decline occurs during the pre/post market. It is observable and undeniable that the price DOES NOT significantly decline throughout the day. I am no sure what that tells me about buying and selling and who is doing it, but it is interesting none the less. Also, are there any brokerages that allow retail to sell and buy right at 4:00 am?"
Feel free to settle FTD and other abuses. We're patient. Does not cost US a thing but TIME which is not on you side
"Selling stock short without having located stock for delivery at settlement. This activity would violate Regulation SHO, except for short sales by market makers engaged in bona fide market making. Market makers engaged in bona fide market making do not have to locate stock before selling short, because they need to be able to provide liquidity. However, market makers are not excepted from Regulation SHO’s close-out and pre-borrow requirements."
"When Russel 2000 is on uptick so is amc. It almost seems like they’d short the whole index just to tank amc. No , they’d never do that"
From what I have been told. The first 15 minutes of after hours were trades from the regular session that didn't get processed? We should have hit 60. Everyone knows the buy pressure was greater than the sell pressure again.
"When you look at the historical data of previous short squeezes and compare it AMC, there is so much similarities with the price action. Who would have thought that we willget to $72 on the 2nd of June when we were riding the wave of short attacks at $5.50. Amazing stuff. History in the making. At the moment, the short HFs are too proud to accept defeat. ""Pride comes before the fall."""
200% margin requirement needed to short AMC per Schwab and TD Ameritrade. The vice is tightening on the short positions. An easy week for AMC Apes. Hold every share you have and buy more shares if you can but be smart with the money you use to do it with. Enjoy the ride.
I will be buying another 100 shares today and will continue to HODL until we reach at least $10k/share. Outrageous you say...to be hodling for $10k/share. I say what's outrageous and also unconscionable is the behavior of the Hedge Funds by creating synthetic shares of AMC and setting up naked short positions which are impossible to cover. The actions of the Hedge Funds has led us to a point where $10k/share is reasonable. This is not financial advice. I just like the stock.
Hedge funds are bleeding out financially. They realize they need to cover vey soon or they will go bankrupt themselves. It’s happening folks. Enjoy the moon ride!!!  Triple digits any day now!! Buy whatever you can!

A lot of huge purchases today betting on AMC price climbing higher.

Shorts trying to cover just before the close.
"I can't speak for you but I'm just setting up price alerts on my phone. AMC will squeeze when she's ready to squeeze. You can't put a specific date/time on it, and it isn't good for your health to just sit and stare at the chart all day. Check in with Roensch Capital on YT at night for a recap of AMC price action for the day and a preview of coming attractions. Wash. Rinse. Repeat. HODL. All the stress is on the shorts so let the stress rest with them. Good things come to those who wait so let this thing marinate and then get paid. This is the way."
"This post has been deleted every time. AMC investors: I was hoping for feedback from someone who is familiar with the IEX. If youhave Td Ameritrade, go to 'My Profile' , then 'General', then 'Direct routing' select edit, then check box and accept/submit, then go into trades and buy AMC, and select 'Additional Details', then 'Routing' in the drop down list, select IEX which changes 'order flow preferences'MY QUESTION TO ANYONE WHO CAN ANSWER IS: can this stop Citadel and the others from routing our orders through the Dark Pools?If yes, can someone provide the Pros and Cons of changing order flow preferences."
The basher effort is indicative to their desperation.Basher effort on this stock is the only bullish sign one need to know where this is going.Squeeze inevitable.
"the market manipulators are trying to make you sale, don't sale, instead buy more and hold. It is imminent, soon the shorts are going to have to buy and the short squeeze is gonna send the price to the moon, stay calm and you are going to multiply your investment !!!!"
The lower the price the MORE we add !! We are in control here.
MARGIN CALLShttps://franknez.com/charles-schwab-raises-margin-requirements-for-amc-gme-stock/
"There’s a reason that Youtuber’s and big players are still invested into AMC. There’s a reason that ETFs have been selling other positions and buying AMC. It’s because they all think that it’s going back up. Just think about this. If you sell, or if you have already sold, you’re still going to be monitoring AMC like crazy because you don’t want to miss out on the squeeze. Once we bounce back up, you’re going to want to buy back in, and you’ll try to buy back in cheaper than you sold just to get those few extra shares. You’re not alone in this. 99% of people who sold will be doing the same thing. All we need is a big enough push upwards and then FOMO buying will kick in from all of the people who sold, plus others, and the momentum will pick up. This has happened with all bud jumps ahead and squeezes with “meme stocks”.I know many people are waiting to see if this goes back up to buy in, but if everyone just realized that this will go back up because the apes are buying and holding, and that AMC is currently on sale, then they bought in regardless of price action, we will see the price go back up.Not financial advice, but I’ll personally be doing what I can to help this movement.Note:With emotions so high with this stock, everyone just take 5 minutes of their day to make a post on social media and AMC groups. People need motivation and reassurance that they’re not alone in this movement. The more people who post and show that they’re buying/holding, the better the APES moral will be."
make no mistake people this price is being dropped by the hedges shorting more and more shares every day. new rules are coming into effect seems weekly we're almost there ladies and gentlemen. we're all holding waiting for the squeeze 
"Just called my local AMC theatre to see if they had information on the MOASS. Lady on the phone said, ""Please HOLD"". I said' ""Absolutely!"""
i love seeing consolidation like this amongst the gains. this is healthy growth.
"I know some of you got in at 50s, 60s or even 70s and are anxious. Calm Down. I bought in on January at $12 and saw price movement from $12 to $7, $7 to $5, $5 to $25, $25 to $7, $7 to $17, $17 to $5. Up and down 8x - 14x. What you're seeing now is nothing in scale. I stay because i have the conviction that shorts will have to cover which they have not. I added a ton at 30s, 40s, 50s, even mid 60s. We own the float, we have the cards. The only way we lose is if we fold to hedgie bluffs. APES STICK TOGETHER    "
Hold strong. Loaded 2595 shares yesterday at 44.7. Loaded another 2595 shares today at 43.7. My target is 130+ even I have to hold for a year. Stay strong Apes. We own this.
AMC ON THRESHOLD LIST SINCE JUNE 18TH AND REPORTED 2 DAYS BACK TO BACK FROM 25TH OF JUNE..THEY HAVE 7-13 TRADING DAYS TO SETTLE BEFORE AUTOMATIC COVERING BY COMPUTERS..5 DAYS HAVE PASSED ALREADY..AND WE HAVE 7 TRADING DAYS LEFT TODAY BEFORE SHOWTIME..JULY 6TH
Funny how the board always works fine when we in red but the real funny part is y’all still gotta cover no matter what y’all try to do to the fake price 
"Look, I know most, if not all of you, that are AMC apes/junkies could care less about a company's fundamentals, but just a thought, because a CFO that I once worked for and highly respected had a favorite saying: ""Cash is King"" In 2017, 2018 and 2019 (before the pandemic) AMC produced, on average, about $550 million in cash flow from operations and those 3 years were reasonably good years. Lets, just for the heck of it, jack that up by 50% to $750 million in cash flow from operations. With 500+ million shares now outstanding that figure to be about $1.50/share or about 3.3% return. Better that your average savings account, but WAY less cash than hundreds, if not thousands, of good, solid companies are generating."
Btw Hedgies. I'm still NOT selling
Im so scared i Will buy another 3k worth of AMC shares today
"Going to be fast and furious with thousands of dollar swings. Be smart and understand holding until all short sells are covered including the naked and fake ones. It will run up past 100k at some point, stay the course!Amc is the #hood"
Yahoo is blocking positive comments and allowing the paid negatives to flow! Hoooold!
NOTICE: YOU will see alot of chatter about other potential squeeze stock....The only plays worth being in is AMC and GME period. the others are just a deterrent...APE STRONG
well I can't wait for the market to open. About 1 month ago I said June 20th when summer came around AMC would take off. I sure hope I am right and we see a $70 or higher close for the day. AMC TOO THE MOON
$100 come on down. Ape nation is ready for triple digits. By order of the Peaky Blinders. Hedgies going down.
I like the stock and will hold forever if needed.
Still riding this AMC rocket ship. Not getting off till we get to the moon!!!!
"Remember that despite the PM, AMC shares will be required to be covered, per the NYSE mandatory threshold requirements, on the open market."
I think we are only days away if not hours or minutes for this to up bigthere is not much they can do to keep the price down
They are routing trades....taking exchange rates....and the real price of AMC is 688.12!
Got to love when they drive the price down in an attempt to force retail investors to sell. Only thing is it is backfiring on them and actually causing more investors to buy shares. Investors are averaging down and are also able to buy more than they would have because of the nice discount they are giving us. The only way out for these guys is to pop the price upward which may make some people take profits maybe around $75 -$80 range even though this most likely will go much much higher.
Holding strong in UK supporting the USA
I heard about AMC the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
They have to start at 5125.00 per share!!!!!
Buy assets and learn high income skills
so happy the HF are called out on the failure to deliver. since AMC has 7.3 million failure to deliver .. its a great day
"Yahoo is censoring the #AMC chat, so we all moved over to HOOD. AMC looking good premarket!! "
Still here! Still holding! Bought more! $AMC

Where can I go get some uplift in these moments as I really want to hold and forget.

"Delay delay delay the inevitable all you want. I'll sit and wait and wait and wait until I sell at 100k. Hedgies, y'all done messed up."
strong day today
"Just how strong is AMC? Simply look at yesterday's trading by shorts and yet we ended up a couple of pennies at days end. Now I will say this do not be alarmed by what appears to be lower volume on a daily basis, remember shorts trading between themselves is going to be much less likely to occur and the drop in volume would actually make you realize how much of the volume we had seen in the past was just that.Date Short percentage Dark Pool percentage2021-06-23 45.7 % 57.5 %I mean we were attacked yesterday based on these numbers and they could not get AMC to budge."
Time to buy more!!!
19.62% short on ortex. yahoo deleted this multiple times
How many of you think it will go past 100 and how many think it will sink just curious lol
Stay in don’t sell. Squeeze is coming shortly !!!!!!
"15 more on a daily basis for me. We will soon reach the point when shorties will be able to cover and institutions want to buy. That's going to be a lot of buys, and what happens when that occurs? BOOOOM!"
"AMC is now the largest member in the Russel 2000 after the rebalancing. We’ve 4 times the market-cap of the second member from the Russel 2000. AMC is already a big player, but will be even a bigger play right now. This is really a bullish potential for AMC. They will turn more eyes on us. And I mean the Index-managers ect..  $$"
I’m buying many more shares today. AMC is going higher!
"Repost, I hope everyone is remembering that today after the market closes, the Russell 2000 is rebalanced. AMC will need to be purchased. Why sell your shares now when you could just wait until Monday. Not financial advice but just my opinion."

"The American Prospect☰How the GameStop Hustle WorkedHow hedge funds and brokers have manipulated the market.by Lucy KomisarJUNE 22, 2021 5:30 AMKomisar-GameStop 062221.jpgJohn Minchillo/AP PhotoI have written previously for the Prospect about the frenzy over GameStop (GME), the video game and electronics company. By now, you know the story. Millions of retail investors made the stock soar by over 1,000 percent in January 2021. This brought disaster upon a handful of hedge funds that had bet on GameStop’s stock to drop. According to Markets Insider, one analyst estimated losses in February of roughly $19 billion. The hedge fund Melvin Capital reportedly closed out its position after taking a drubbing of 51 percent. Another fund, Maplelane, lost 40 percent.The rally eventually subsided, and the stock fell, though it remains well above its original price. But as retail investors looked into the details in the aftermath, they found telltale signs of a common yet egregious trading fraud by major brokers and hedge funds, which evaded what could have been far bigger losses. What happened around GameStop can be explained only by massive counterfeiting of shares.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which along with other regulators could confirm whether the patterns seen in GameStop trading constitute fraud, has known about and largely ignored practices like this for years. The financial media also ignores this systemic corruption.Here’s how it works.Naked Short Selling and Fails to DeliverThe SEC allows traders to short a stock, which means to sell it even if they don’t own it, hoping to buy it back later at a lower price and bank the difference. Short sellers borrow the stock, usually from a broker, who either has it in their inventory, borrows it from another broker, or vows to “locate” the stock when the time comes and cover the short.That promise is often fake. A broker handling several sellers will borrow synthetic or manufactured shares, or “locate” the same stocks for multiple shorts. Traders and brokers have been mildly sanctioned for this scam.Sellers are supposed to send shares to buyers within two days. If they don’t convey the stock, there is a failure to deliver (FTD). This is also known as naked short selling. Traders that have outstanding FTDs are required to transfer the shares within a given time and are restricted from selling short until then. This rule is massively ignored or finessed, and the penalties are minor.The major GME short sellers had to cover their shorts at a time when the funds had shorted much more stock than existed and when owners with real shares weren’t selling, even at higher prices. They were threatened with a short squeeze, with the price going so high that they cannot cover it with existing assets, and they get a margin call, a demand that additional money gets dropped into their brokerage account.The short squeeze ended under peculiar circumstances. A January 28 spike in GME led Robinhood, the online broker that handled orders for many retail traders, to cut the buy option for the stock from its app. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told the House Financial Services Committee in February that he had discussed the trade restrictions with the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which clears public trades, after it made a $3 billion margin call.However, DTCC CEO Michael Bodson told the committee in May that “the decision to restrict trading really was internal to Robinhood, we did not have discussions about that.” He noted that with Robinhood, “the system worked.” It stopped the buys while the big traders continued to sell. GME that day hit $483, but then the price plummeted, and the short squeeze was over.Why would Robinhood shut down GME trading? It did not lose money on trades, because it did not have its own investments. The answer may be hidden in the murky relationships involving market makers and hedge funds.Citadel Securities, a market maker, handled Robinhood’s orders on a “pay for order flow” basis (it paid for orders routed to it), which equaled 40 percent of Robinhood’s revenue. Citadel Securities is a division of a company founded by billionaire Ken Griffin. Another division, the Citadel hedge fund, helped provide short seller Melvin Capital with nearly $3 billion in funds during the GME short squeeze. Citadel Securities would have the clout to persuade Robinhood to shut down trading, and the motive, given its other division’s investment in Melvin. (UPDATE: Robinhood COO James Swartwout stated in sworn court testimony in February for a case in California that “no third party, including either Citadel or Citadel Securities, requested that Robinhood apply restrictions on stock or options trading or played any role” in the decision to limit trading.)Citadel Securities also has a knack for running afoul of the trading laws. It has been fined 58 times in the last few years for violating trading regulations, many about nak"

"If you've seen the Adam Aron interviews on Trey's Trades, then you know the silverback is very anti-hedge fund. And let's not forget that no one knows when the MOASS will happen. But in no particular order, here are a handful of signs to watch out for..... climbing stock price, high trading volume, market sell-offs, and news about more hedge funds failing. Keep a level head. Don't let misinformation get the best of us. MOASS will eventually happen. Adam Aron is on our side."
"Annnnd, YAHOO FINANCE continues to take down posts that are negative towards the hedgies. . ."
Gonna be a GREAT day for Ape Nation…MARGIN CALL MONDAY!HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
"Here is what is really happening today: The Short sellers are desperate. The Apes are winning. Every share shorted today brings our new average higher tomorrow. AMC is a top weighted stock in the Russell 2000 and will continue to be for the rest of 2021. Apes  don’t need to think, we just do. We BUY, we HOLD, we HODL while the shorties lose their shorts. We are on track to close higher today. Ignore fud, stay strong stay long, lets rip thru the 60’s.  Rocket        "
The longer they take to cover the higher my price goes. I have been buying since Jan so I have some of those REAL shares that they really really need.
Picture this just buying one share. And that one share being worth thousands! 
"Well I look at today as a huge success for AMC. We were not pushed around by shorts, and when we were knocked down a bit we climbed right back.This was an absolutely beautiful day of consolidation at the upper levels of our channel of $53.75 to $63.Short sellers borrowed over 12 million shares per Ortex and returned 11 million. They did not make much money. They did succeed in lowering the IV in the options chain which again may work against them as lower options prices will attract new money.Shorts continue to double down without attempting to cover any of the previous shorting. So while this looks like it was a stagnant day, today was a huge success.Perhaps tomorrow we see more consolidation, and that will stand to make us stronger and make the push north even larger.There could be gamma squeezes on the horizon as we see how options chain plays out. $60s may have to be hedged for if we can put enough pressure there, $65 would absolutely have to be hedged for.The shorts margin for error is getting slimmer by the day. We need our buyers to come on strong tomorrow because even the least of solid buying pressure will likely be more than shorts can handle."
"Big shout out to the HF shorting, without them we wouldn't be going where we are going. Greatly Appreciated"
JP Morgan has warned Hedgies to expect Margin Calls…our day is NEAR!HOLD LONG & STRONG!
"The hedge funds cannot control the price like they were, they can only attempt to manipulate the apes who have harness the price power. They pay millions to trade sideways it with pennysThey are well aware, the largest demographic of holders are millennials, whom need the money they invested in. They know new investors are experiencing the stock market fatigue watching it everyday. So what is there plan. Using common sense, they are going to use all there power to attempt to make the stock stall and trade sideways, pennys! They want to bore you into submission, they want to warp your reality into thinking 1 of 2 things1. This is the new normal stock price for awhile, its only down from here2. Sell before it drops it will never be 60 again.They know a cent below will make it red and red has the power to install anxiety in new investors. Just hold!"
"DON'T TRUST ETRADE! I am not happy with Etrade they called me this morning in regard to a cash call. At the time I was undergoing a medical treatment for cancer, so they left a VM. Once the my treatment was complete, I checked my phone and, called back immediately to inform them that I would be making a transfer to cover as soon I as arrived home. I was surprised to find out that not even hour after they left the VM, they decided to sale shares of my AMC!!! Which is very shady to me. Considering all of the things that are going on with AMC and, the fact that E-Trade is in business with Citadel, the biggest shorter of AMC, the decision to sell shares of AMC and not any of my other holdings is very suspect. I have Tesla and Apple just to name a couple."

"AMC Pre-Market is showing a 7th straight day of decreasing volume which is lining up great for a gamma squeeze; however, if you have options expiring today that are currently OTM or even ITM but chasing a losing premium, I do not believe you’re likely to get much increase today. Prediction for the day is overall green but with a closing point of $57.60-$58.20."
"Why buy the dips - I buy bec as Trey says no fundamentals have changed (shorts didn’t cover, longs didn’t sell and sec didn’t fix anything). The current price I see as discount (I bought at 5.5 as well) and ultimately it will go past 72 and break 100 in my opinion. If it dips more I will keep buying. I’m looking at the large picture and not day to day basis. U have to be able to keep calm and focused. Not selling, I know the value of my shares and the manipulation that is going onNot for sale"
"Here is Hedgies trick today. Open green, latter it down to red. Pump crypto & CLOV to distract. All just to try and control Ape emotions. It makes me want to buy more honestly, so I will "
Good morning all holders. We're one more day closer to the G.M.O.A.S.S. Remember all we have to do is HODL. We already won!
No amount of illegal market manipulation can defeat Apes as long as we HODL
Thumbs up if you can see $100 at the end of this week!
This is the biggest opportunity in the market ever. This short squeeze is inevitable this summer
"By Monday or Tuesday, maybe even within 6 hours of the open will be a big move. The next excitement is coming. I think anyway, been wrong before and can be wrong again but what the h. I think I will buy another 100 at the open dip."
"It will reach $90 by the end of July, hold or just buy more but do not sell !"
Cheatin’ Hedgies continue to pay massive interest and lose big-time…their egos are our best friend as their grave gets deeper & deeper.BUY & HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
Torchlight is the latest distraction to the AMC movement and it just so happens that Chitadel is a top 10 holder in Torchlight.
"Please have patience folks, we have the shares locked up and they can only try to scare you into selling. Short sellers and their associates will try all the tricks in the book in order to get you to sell, but here is why you shouldn’t:1. Low volume - ladder attacks stopped which inflated numbers anyway. 2. FOMO investors and day traders exited so the volatility is less, that is in part why this stock went down on low volume.3. Institutional buyers will be rebalancing their portfolios this week, a positive for this upcoming week, but also a negative for last week as the institutions want to purchase this at the lowest price point. Look at the valuation of AMC, it is 4x what it was at the end of last month.4. Lastly, if you are wondering who has sold and who has not sold….just know that this stock price has formed a new base because of everyone holding shares and not selling, that is why the stock held at over $50 this week!I appreciate the stock holders of AMC, I know we call ourselves Part of the Ape community. Call it what you will, I’m just glad to be part of that group. Stay safe, stay humble, and as always, stay healthy! Hold those shares, don’t let the bullies intimidate you or waiver in your stance against this movement! Good luck to all!Jersey Jimmy"
Volume is irrelevant. Everyone is holding. They cap the price with HFT back and forth hoping we just tire out. That's what their AI says. Time is running out for them....just have to ignore the day to day. If you want fast money..hit the casino
People I dont have the most money but i have AMC i buy AMC and if you dont think your 30 shares matter! your 5 shares? They all matter! Rich people beyond our wealth are heavily in AMC now! Everyone sees the corruption everyone sees this will end bad for the institutions that bet against the people. They will continue to do this AMC is your stand it is our stand. This is where the Theft of billions stops!
If you’re on fidelity you can see the orders by fidelity customers. Ever since the price has been dropping theres been more buyers than sellers. Everyday.
"whenever someone goes out of their way to tell me this is dead, it shows me how desperate they are for me to sell. Bring it on bears, shills and interns! Just looking for an excuse to buy more like when you said this was done in the 10s."
To the moon..soon ..LOL
"My only question is this. I was just looking at the top movies by revenue for the past week. The best movie earned 22 million. For theater operators that is peanuts. The worst we used to see was 60 to 80 million. That means theaters aren't selling popcorn, candy or soda pop. Noone is spending time in their video game arcades. Now with at least a new limited lockdown I have a hard time buying this stock. I agree there may be the threat of a short squeeze and that will certainly run up the price short term but what happens after that?"
"1st halt, haha, good news squeeze coming, remember GME halts? "
Shorts have not covered.Shorts need 10x the float to cover. We own the float.Nothing else matters. 
STRONGER TOGETHERWe patiently HOLD we Win !! Don’t get distracted by Shorty’strickery.Keep the faith .
"Do NOT be surprised. We may go down a bit more today but once the Consolidation is over, you will all go to the moonTrust. Patiences will pay off￼"
The shorts are buying one day of survival at a time and their weapon of choice are 10 cent a post bashers. You don't even need to read the charts to know which side is winning.
Why not just issue more stock? Seems like the logical thing for this company to do.
Remember what Buffet taught us. Hodl

"If you look at the GME chart or even the Volkswagen chart from back then you'll see both going sideways for a week or so before the squeeze occurs. Keep holding, we're not loosing anything by it staying that way. Buy more if you can."
"If anybody is still wondering about whether the HFs are in panic mode or not, yesterday's blackout of all US and Canadian investors from the AMC message board should alleviate any of those lingering doubts you may have had."
Is it too late to buy more?
There was buying in the final ten minutes of the Friday session and then into AH. Let’s take this as a sign of momentum to come. This massive pennant could burst upwards pre holiday easily and there are predictions that it makes a move post holiday as well. Just hold and be patient as they put more on the table for us to squeeze at the 60-65 level. If we break that they will cover quick Luu to reduce risk and this will burst. They have doubled down. Let’s double down on them!!!!!!

Short can’t get a volume sell off. Lol. Enjoy that interest
Just got in with 70 shares at $35
"Breakout and all they have is 1.8 million shares to stop it ,"
"repost from E.E.10). We shall find out the FTD by next week of those option contacts on June 18th. Each contract is 100 shares. 411,700 call options are 41 million shares. On the put contracts, that is 76 million shares..….that is about $2.5 - $3 Billion to be put on AMC stock (as of June 18th market closed price of $59 alone). This is only from the June 18th option contract. The $65 and $70 open interests for June 25th are being built. The $70 strike of Gamma Squeeze is likely. Future open interests as high as $145. This could go on for weeks and months.....11). Who knows how long this thing will play out if short sellers continue to double down and refuse to cover their short position? If NSCC-002 gets implemented….short institutions will not be able to over-leveraged their short/risky position, future short squeeze will not be as massive. Shorts have lost $5B so far on AMC stock. They also have to pay a borrowing fee daily. They lose millions each day with their short position since almost 50 days ago & since $10. We lose nothing when we (Apes) HODL....... 12). 43% or about $143 million Robinhood's revenue of Q1 2021 is from Citadel. Robinhood revenue has increased 263% due to the GME saga. Robinhool made $91 Million in Q1 2020 & $331 Million in Q1 2021. Robinhood route retail investors trades through Citadel. These institutions are working with prime brokerage to take advantage of retail investors and try to bankrupt companies like GME & AMC. Free & fair market, not so much. I have told everyone I know not to use Robinhood brokerage since they are helping Citadel....13). As these short institutions/MMs realized that more Apes continue to buy & HODL AMC Stocks, this goes against the short institutions Algorithm. When AMC SP is higher, as we have since the past 6 weeks, the deeper these shorts are under water. They are down 500% since shorting at $10, almost 2 months ago.... 14). Dark pool: Short institutions, the elite 1% can trade in the dark pool. According to Stonk-O-Tracker, as high as 65% traded AMC stock in the dark pool. Short institutions continue buying AMC stock as of last Friday, June 18th in the dark pool and selling those shares in the lit exchange (NYSE). On Wednesday, June 16th, short institutions bought 17.8 million AMC shares in the dark pool and another 37.7 million AMC shares on Friday, June 18th. They lost $24.6 billion on the OFF exchange ""dark pool"" as of June 18th. These short institutions continue to double down their short position (as of June 18th). 2 Million shares sold short on the lit exchange (NYSE) is a fraction of what is being bought compared in the ""off exchange (dark pool)"" and dumped those shares in the market to manipulate prices.Hide quoted text15). The more desperate these shorts are, the more FUD you will see/hear from them & the media. When in doubt, zoom out and see a larger perspective. I continue to add to my position and HODL AMC stock, until I see short sellers covered. The amount of synthetic shares & AMC shares bought on ""Off exchange or dark pool"" is astronomical. Not only they have not started to cover their short position, they continue to double down as of last Friday. June 18th. The short institutions/MMs have been destroying many companies and retail investors for decades. NSCC-002 will be a huge win for retail investors when it’s implemented. These are only my opinions. Do your own research before investing."
"We all know by now that APES will NOT be distracted by any other ticker being pushed on this board or by the media. 100%, these are unequivocal attempts to distract and divert attention away from our beloved AMC. Lots of it out there. Tune it all out and be stress free!"
$AMC - This is the way!

"Amc $500 soon they will realize that this isn’t about movie theater but the revolution, GameStop paved the way and still holding above $200 with empty stores and no guidance "
"The small HFs know they have to cover at these levels to have chance of survival, as once this hits 60s they are chopped meat. However, they can't cover bc the FOMO would send this to the stratosphere. They are in a tough spot and they get what they deserve. Bankruptcy in bound!"
"The Stocks, Forex, and dividends market is constantly evolving with new features, market fluctuations, trading opportunities. You can make great profits fast but trading without experience and the right strategy for the particular market you can lose them even faster. Another thing is your risk management plan. Even if your winning system and trading psychology are good, a lack of risk management skills will make you give back all your profits at some point. That's why it's always advisable to work with a professional and registered trader, I work with Mr Jared Cannon who has taught me how to capitalize on the stock and crypto market trends and his trading signals and strategies have actually proven to bring out the best results with her knowledge and experience from stock trading, I'm always grateful because it has actually been helpful to me financially. So far I have made reasonable profits learning how to trade better through him. I recommend him, don't forget that as some are losing in the financial market, others are capitalizing and winning.

"Also, can someone guestimate a realistic price squeeze target or at least what they're predicting it realistically could get to?"
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!

"Today's move bodes incredibly well for AMC and not to be underestimated. Remember, earlier this morning, this dropped to 38.76 and it bounced by 10 dollars from that low. Think about it. That is an almost 25% increase from the bottom! Moreover, it did so with large volume. Check the daily volume for the past few days, and it has been in around 50-60 million shares, except yesterday which was around 94 million shares. But today, we are already above 105 million shares and there is 3 hours left in the market. So we've move 25% from the bottom with large volume. Huge amounts of buying is what is happening, not to be confused with short squeeze. Vast majority of shorts have not covered. Some may have covered today, but short shares are still above 90+ million shares based on Ortex. Before today, we've had 7 days (except one in the middle) of dropping, and this was the bottom. The best shorts could do was to bring this down to 38-40 dollar range which is a huge support level, and we bounced very nicely from that. I personally believe we're set for another run to mid 50s in the next few days and testing low 60s very shortly. Another thing that is quite significant is that before the past few days drop, we were settling around mid 50s with low volatility with some chance of breaking out up or possibly down. Unfortunately, it moved down, and we saw that in the last few days. Now, it is clear we survived the down trend, tested major support at 38-40, and did NOT fall below that. This gives me more confidence that in the near future, people just have to accept that this stock is a stock that's trading in the 50s irrespective of the fundamentals. Just look at the price action in the last month to see what I mean. What is next? I believe mid 50s, test of low 60s, and very likely squeeze. Again I don't have timeline nor would I state any timelines. I just follow the trends and whenever I can buy at the dips. Above is just my opinion and not any financial advice. You do what is best for you. For me, the best is to hold and wait. I can tolerate to see my huge gains fluctuate. I was fortunate to get in at around 13 and added more on the way up, but some of you may have bought above 50 and might be down. So good luck to you, and I think you will be a winner. Patience pays off. I cannot overstate the importance of this stock being in the 50s for so long, after all the talk and FUD in the media saying the price is not justified by fundamentals. What matters now is that most apes are holding and shorts don't know what to do."
"Low volume means we holding, only manipulation going on."
Not buying this maipulation...not selling till 1k
Buy and hold toWin the stock market of wealth
Leaks and whispers are saying that the real price of AMC is 5K per share…. Big institutions are loading up and so am I. ￼
E-Trade sold 1000 shares of mine AMC which i was holding for more than 8 months to cover the margin requirement in another stock. They could have squared off the stock on which margin requirement was there. This is very frustating
In 2 weeks my work stock wont be in a blackout period and i'll have access to roughly 125K. Selfishly hoping were still in this price range so I can yolo into retirement 30 years early
21% gains and AMC isn't even put on the trending list. Good job Yahoo...
"FLGT continues to explode, up 12.5%, while market and AMC sliding.FLGT could be a better short squeeze stock than GME or AMC !FLGT could climb 3-fold from here and still be UNDERVALUED !"
come on hedgy how am i going to get my shares on sale if you keep letting the price go up? you are working for us now lowering the price so we have more upside so get to it i want 800 more shares at 56 please

Great day!! Hope we will have even better tomorrow. Stay strong everyone !!
The whole world knows that Amc will be green and they cannot stop us today.

You want to borrow the rest of the shortable shares....go ahead......haha! Not going to work with those box office numbers!
When the first big margin call hits this will explode.Just don't sell no matter what.... if you need to hold for an year or two hold. Reminder... any short position MUST be covered at the end. There is no option to not cover just matter of time.
ODD: My yahoo conversation boards seem to be functioning fine in all my other holdings...
Buy buy. They have less shares to short fees goin up again

And Hedge Funds Bankruptcy is the GOAL.NO Need To SeLL until after we know what to Multiply the current share price by(Shorted Share Count).Believe it. Its Over 7 Billion Synthetic Shares.Thats 14 FAke[AMC] = x14 MultiplierYou Dont SeLL on the SQUEEZEYou HoDL on the SQUEEZE to hit 100k- 500k"
"Who’s ready, shorts are down billions and drowning we celebrate everyday 420 style knowing due diligence and extensive research pays off massively. Red or green we buy that’s a fact"
"NOT Financial ADVICEFor all of the new baby apes. I know a lot of you have questions, and I thought it would be helpful to provide you with some overall context to understand the significance of the movement you just joined.Here’s the cliff note version. Covid hit last March and a couple of big hedge funds concocted a plan to drive AMC into bankruptcy by “shorting” it and make a ton of money in the process. You “short” a company when you think the value of the stock is going to go down. When the country locked down and AMC closed their doors and their revenue literally went to $0 overnight, it was a no brainer play for the hedge funds. So they started borrowing millions and millions of shares from brokers and sold them “short” at the market price at the time, and they pocketed the cash from the sale. The idea is that the stock price will drop, you can buy them back later at a lower price, and then return the borrowed shares to the broker and keep the difference. If the company goes bankrupt, the stock goes to $0 and they don’t have to buy anything back at all and keep everything. This is what they were banking on. They’ve done this to company after company over the years, and they saw this as a sure thing as any. Well a bunch of people on Reddit (affectionately known as “Apes”) noticed they were trying to drive AMC, GameStop and many other retail and mortar stores into bankruptcy, and banded together to buy up all the available shares, driving up the share price. This resulted in the mini squeeze in January. But Apes didnt sell after that. And the hedge funds didn’t cover their short positions either (I.e. buy back the millions of shares they had borrowed and sold short). The Apes kept buying and buying, and holding and holding, and once the real shares were all bought up, the hedge funds doubled, tripled and quadrupled down on their short position and started making synthetic shares (IOUs) and selling those shares into the market trying to drive the price down. When the price dropped, instead of selling like the hedge funds wanted them to, Apes said “thank you very much for the discount” and kept buying more and holding. Nobody has sold for the past 5 months since the movement really got started in January, and more and more people are jumping in and adding more everyday. Now because of all of the synthetic IOU shares the hedge funds have created to keep shorting AMC, us Apes likely own more way more shares than are actually supposed to exist (as much as 6x-8x by some estimates). But real or synthetic, each share the hedge funds sold short is a liability on their books that must be bought back in order to close out their position. They literally have hundreds of millions of shares, possibly billions, to buy back, and we own them all. They have to buy them back eventually, and every day that the borrowed short shares are still on loan, the hedge funds are paying interest to the brokers they borrowed them from. Meanwhile it costs us nothing to hold. Things started to come to a head a couple weeks ago because the interest rate on the borrowed shares was reported to be as high as 250% (1-2% is normal for your average stock), so the hedge funds are collectively paying hundreds of millions of dollars every day just to hold their position, and a lot of them are starting to miss the payments and margin calls could be coming very soon. That’s when the fun starts. At that point, the broker forces them to buy back all of the hundreds of millions of shares they have borrowed and sold short, because the broker doesn’t want the hedge funds’ recklessness to fall onto them. And remember, the Apes own all the shares and aren’t selling. The hedge funds can only buy a share for what an Ape is willing to sell it for, and us Apes really love our shares. Once the margin calls start, the computers just start buying back all of the shares at the best available price no matter what that price may be. They all have to be bought back. Everything must be settled. And if the cheapest price an ape is willing to sell for is 1,000, or 10,000 or 100,000, well then that’s what the hedge funds will be forced to buy the borrowed shares back for in order to close out their position. Apes are going to hold and hold and hold driving up the price further and further to make the hedge funds bleed as much as possible until they are inevitably forced to buy back their millions of shares. They will need to buy our shares, and we set the price. And remember, it costs us nothing to hold. This movement has been building for the past 5 months, but you just heard about it yesterday. One thing Apes don’t do is set dates for the squeeze. Nobody knows when it will happen, all we know for sure is that the math says it’s inevitable as long as we hold."
Buying Monday. Haven’t had a red Monday following a green Friday since December.

Fair Warning to Hedgies — I’m going to buy more. Today.
"More convinced than ever that this cannot be held under $60. They desperately want it there. But too much buying momentum and pressure, plus we are seeing 002's effects. HF punches are weaker each day. HODL (not advice, just like the stock)"
Lots of big calls bought today. Follow the money.
I find it interesting that CS just bought a large amount of shares at 58 last week and also today raised there margin requirements! HmmmmWill others follow?
"Good afternoon, all. A novice at investing here. What is t best time of day to buy shares in this stock?"
"Please try send below complaint off to SEC if you canTo: chairmanoffice@sec.govcc commissionerpeirce@sec.gov; commissionercrenshaw@sec.gov; commissionerroisman@sec.govSubject: Market Manipulation - AMC EntertainmentDear Mr GenslerI would like to draw your attention to market manipulation activity happening on an industrial scale on range of stocks including AMC listed on US Exchanges by market makers operating in the dark pool.Brokerages such as Fidelity which routes retail orders through NYSE reports day in day out the buy orders for AMC outnumbering sell orders by nearly 2 to 1, yet the price has been falling consistently now for the past month. It is falling because brokerages such as Robinhood,TD Ameritrade and Charles Shwab, attracted by payments for order flow, are routing retail orders through dark pool market makers such as Citadel and Virtu which routes sell orders to lit exchanges on receipt and park buy orders in their books; eventually releasing it to lit exchanges as and when it favours them.In fact, on option expiry days, you can almost exactly predict to the dime where the price of stocks manipulated in this manner will finish at end of day trading.My question to you Sir is: Why is the SEC allowing Citadel and other clearinghouse money makers/broker-dealers to route over 50% of all the AMC retail buy orders to dark pools and sell orders to the market, thus effectively truncating AMC market price?United States prides itself as a free fair and competitive market driven economy. However, the above practice appears anything but. It is pure manipulation by and to the benefit of a single entity Citadel, and to the detriment of tens of millions of retail investors. This needs to be investigated and the practice ended as a matter of URGENCY,Sincerely"
I've started the switch from Etrade to Fidelity. The reason - Etrade was one of the bad players back in January is a PFOF broker. I am buying more and don't want my money going to Citadel direct. If anyone is buying more you must do this too. I'll let you know how long it took to transfer.
Why are there no conversations about this stock less than two month's old.
Almost 3000 shares I’m holding this is probably the only chance I’m going to get to make it big. I can see why people are trying to get us to sale. AMC will be massive
Buy and hold if you like money and massive gains
We own the outstanding float. A modest chunk and stay the course
"Robert posted low volume, why because we own over 80 % of the float and when you are consolidating and getting nearer the tip of the bullish wedge the stock takes a breather. The high volume of the past may also have been due to high frequency trading to control the stock. We are sitting beautiful."
Lat time we had a similar daily candle was May 21st. What happened after that?
Good night Kenny. Let’s see what failed tricks you have in store for us tomorrow
"Yf hacked by citadel? Lot of spam here . Guys its simple Buy if you can, hold and relax, we‘re so close Trust me, been here since January 21 we got ist, hold strong from germany ! Now its time for football EURO 2020"
"Some simple math to prove there are a Billion or more Phantom shares. If just 500,000 of us own 1,000 shares, that's already almost the entire float of AMC. But there may be 5 or 6 million shareholders! Then there's the whale owners, that's the 433 institutional owners who own 143,349,463 shares. This is insane!!!"
At least we have SSR in effect tomorrow...
"We own the float , short interest have been increasing and gamma is about to happen soon , are you sorry for hedge fund ?"
"Shorts will indeed cover at some point and when they do this stock will rocket before you can even get in. So buy, hold and fasten your seat belt for take off. "
When the volume is less than half you know people are holding strong! Wait until July 4 weekend when even more people go to the movies....im sure you can cover then shorts!
Testing. Testing. Are we blocked again today?
"I have 5 grand, I was saving for the power hour, but buying now!!!"
"I vote no to diluting shares, simply because we own the majority of the shares… if you vote yes, you let them take power away from us… simple, don’t believe that they need money to make amc better, they already did their offering, cash is not an issue, ask Jerome Powell"
I'm rather new to this. But from reading these comments my mind is awakening to the depths that people will bend the rules to try to get what they want and have the regulating body look with blind eyes. I hope the newest rules will change this. How can they let these people borrow again and again?
Bought 20 more shares today. Discount much appreciated
I liquidated all my other stocks on Friday so I can use the money to buy another 300 shares on Monday or Tuesday. I already have 12k shares
Short sellers manipulating premarket!
"buying 100 more shares, not worried about bills, they can wait another month, ill pay them double next month ha ha can anyone say cheese !!!"
We’ve been consolidating for a week now it’s time for the next leg up. Shorts haven’t started to cover that’s facts
"There will never be a squeeze going forward, constant dilution, 511m float and poor fundamental makeit so heavy to fly even with a pair of wings. If it goes above $50 today, I am all-in to short."
Who would bet that Citadel goes bankrupt before AMC or GME?
Ready to buy
"AMC is a day trader's dream come true.But who among you can work the AMC pump and dump cycle with success?You will be competing with computer driven trades, which dominate the volume.It's just easier to await the AMC self-implosion which will be numbers based.Not hype based.My favorite number is AMC's extreme debt levels.Debt that cannot be repaid in its entirety.Also recall that AMC owes back rent on a slew of empty theaters.There was a grace period on the rent due. There is no rent forgiveness."

"They have algorithms to short and sell off our emotions. They have television media. They have FUD articles and hit pieces. They have social media with bots and paid bashers.

If you subtract 200M short shares from the float what does that put this stocks fundamental value at? Id say 200+ maybe 500?

GERMANY: 29.98Change to prev. day +5.64% Anybody know how to figure this in USD?? Thanks! GO APES GEAUX!!! :))
"Shorts and mainstream FUD brought this down to 30s from 50s in July. They were waiting for a disastrous earning report, which didn't happen. Despite all the negativity and talk about fundamentals, etc., this baby is holding at low 30s and slowly but surely climbing up toward upper 30s, then 40s and so on. I look at Ortex numbers and it is amazing that despite millions of shared borrowed (to be shorted at some point), with a short interest at record high, this stock continues to hold thanks to a resilient ape community. As a card holder ape member, I have not sold a single share. Yes it did hurt to see my gains cut, but gain is a gain. I am still way in the green and won't see until I see shorts running for cover with a massive squeeze. They have to have to have to have to cover at some point. I am not selling. I don't have to look at my account. I used all cash to buy my shares early on, and at no risk of margin calls, etc. Shorts on the other hand must endure fees, huge potential losses that they have to deal with at some point. Good luck to you if you are long!"
Push those hedge funds! Show them who is boss!
Your typical Motley staff writer
"I’m fine, but my dad is a hedge fund manager and he told me we have to sell our house to cover "
No longs are selling - we knee on buying. They see the buy orders and don’t want to give people discount prices tomorrow. This is why I think it’s rising AHs. Not for saleSee u all above 80 and beyond
"According to fintel yesterday we had 29% !!!! Short volume, yet 7% up!!!! Holly molly . game over. ..."
"and to think, hedgie STILL has not covered...not even close..."
One large buy puts us over 50.

Do not assume changing your login name will prevent identifing you, your fingerprint left on all deviced you communicate with."
I know of like at least 6 people that have told me they are paid bashers but all six actually buy the stock behind their employers back!
"$HOOD... HERE WE GO!!! Down, down, down.... But I did warn you... It was all a scam, initiated by Citadel to get YOUR money so THEY can pay down the upcoming squeeze at $AMC... This will NEVER see 3 digits, BUT, it MAY see 1 digit... The smart investors are bailing asap... The original investors need to wait UNTIL they can, THEN WILL BAIL ALSO... They already filed such with SEC!!! Be educated, do your Due Diligence... THIS drop is nothing compared to when they bail... The complete plug will be pulled... I suggest you get out now... REALLY!! I do not care about RH, Ivan, Citadel.... I care about the Mom & Pop investor who put their hard earned money in this scam IPO and is being duped by Citadel, through the Media, to invest.. YOU.... I am very sorry you are gonna lose your shirt unless you act upon this... :("

Pullback above 35.60. Now the game starts for the upward journey. Stay united .patience is the key. If you are holding like me not planning to sell at any lower price. Reply to the message
"40 was the magic number for this week guys. Don’t forget that.Yes, 60 would have been a bonus, but that’s all it was. A bonus.We have set ourselves up very well for a great week next week. At the start of this week we were worried about getting pushed to below 40, we closed at near 60. STAY ON TRACK."
"SPREAD THE WORD !!!!!!!! SPREAD THE WORD .......PLEASE READ BELOW PEEPS FRICKEN MOOOOON..........HERE IS THE MOST EXCITING PART: It is said that if a stock is on the threshold securities list for 13 days, they will literally be forced to cover ALL of those FTD positions. Remember, it takes 5 days to be listed (which AMC was on Friday), so it has now been 7 days because of the fact that it was still listed on Monday and Tuesday.Edit: Here is the link to where it says if a stock is on the threshold securities list for 13 consecutive days, they must be forced to cover all FTD positions. Look at the bottom of the first big paragraph under Rule 204: https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htmI can tell you one thing… if, AMC stays on this threshold list for 13 days… it is BOOM BOOM CANDLES time."
HF acting act they have a choice they don't Debt will be settled just like it always is relax and wait for the fun to happen. Hold for GOLD
Get excited...yf posted positive reviews for AMC
"What we need is to hold, know 95% of the Float is our, most have been in the GREEN like me, heavy,so there is no place to go to get these returns, even in a Month or Two....Hold your profits steady....spread the word, 18%short share interest and 1 Billion Synthetic & Dark Pool BS, Whistleblowers and Exec's leaving Citadel regularly...Writing on the wall"
"Wow! YF deleted my comments early this morning. Well, I did pick-up more AMC shares today as I said & I’m holding. People who are now buying into AMC stock & are holding are thinking smarter given the more extensive DD out there &/or new info on the goings-on about AMC that is being shared in social media."
"I called Fidelity and TD Ameritrade yesterday to make certain that they CANNOT lend my AMC shares. Both told the same story:To lend out a investor's shares, the investor would have to have a margin account at either brokerage AND they must have a debit in their margin account. If these conditions exist, both brokerages can lend the investor's shares. If these conditions DO NOT exist, then the investor's shares CANNOT be loaned out by either brokerage.I found this interesting. Also, when I talked to TD Ameritrade, I explained that with all the attention on naked shorting and shorting in general, I DO NOT want my shares to be used by the brokerage firms to lend. The person at TD Ameritrade had an interesting reaction and agreed with me. I got the impression that they are getting tons of calls about shorting because the Apes have brought this into the spotlight this year."
i was looking to put another 30k to work today buying but were good now
"Strong box office showing for ""Black Widow"" - AMC theaters continue to fill..."
With heavy volume today this thing will fly high! Let’s shatter $50 this morning and force the margin calls.
"This Monday morning small surge can be from the hedges buying some stocks now to sell on a dip to make it look like a sell off. Might see a 5.00 to 10.00 fluctuations in the coming days. Hold and stay strong brother's, this is a standoff that can take time since they will not give up easily, wouldn't you if you were them?"
Quick reminder to Yahoo Finance: please fix the Conversations section so we can filter Top Reactions again. Thanks
They have been saying sell at 8...12 ...14 ..20...30..40...50..etc Up 391% in the last 6 months @ 350K...BUYING AND HOLDING STRONG...LETS GO AMC family!
"BOOM CNBCAs vaccination rates continue to rise and the number of coronavirus cases decline consumer confidence in returning to movie theaters has spiked. These audiences are also being exposed to fresh movie marketing on the big screen, which could entice them to return for future releases — particularly movies such as ""F9,"" which is only available in theaters and not being released on streaming until a later date."
Due diligence and extensive research pays off massively with extraordinary gains
I've got a question for you. When there aren't any shares of AMC left to purchase what will happen?
trying to scare us is not working HF 
Everyone buy one share forTrey trades tomorrow #goodluckwithyoursurgery
"It is sad for me to think this way about where this world and its people are going.....but.....myself knowing and belief that every business had started up with just an idea, a belief if you will. Even if the company or business is multi-million/billion dollar or not. And it took hard work for people to start up a business from scratch, and with hopes and dreams to make a profit from it, all along with the thoughts of helping out the economy, raising peoples spirits in some sort of way, or even being happy with what they are doing in life without making an impact on their life or wallet. At some point, everybody started out at ZERO $....and some made it big, some barely making it, and some still struggling. The point is you work hard in what you believe in, then somebody or company tries to tear it down for a quick buck! That is not the way it should be, that is not the way we should believe, that is not what we the people of the world should exercise! I would not want that on my conscience! Shorts and Hedges should stop, put themselves in other peoples situation, and think about what they are doing by ruining companies trying, and still trying to make it. They are not only ruining the companies they built, but ruining the peoples lives that actually made it a reality. I have put in what I could in support for #AMC...just because without movie theaters that we grew up with, and enjoyed, we would not have the warmth of sitting by a loved one watching a movie, a first date as a kid, even a first kiss, a place where everybody could be together and laugh, cry, be scared, without being ashamed or ridiculed...because we all were doing it at some point! We even would not have the moving forward technology we have today to watch movies at home if it wasn't for the film industry all together! It makes NO sense to me to ruin a company or lives for what took so long to build...even if mistakes were made and caused problems within their company. It happens...we are only human and we can only learn from it. If it was something I could believe in...this is a stock worth saving! Im in!"
Tonight Cramer said AMC has room to run. He included it in a graphic with stocks like Tesla and nvidia.
"There are two ways to drive share price down - dilution, and shareholders selling. You cannot short something into nothing if the majority of shareholders do not sell. Apes should begin to think of themselves as institutional shareholders. Institutional shareholders provide stability to share prices because they aren't day trading. These hedge fund games are nothing more than sinister attempts to get weak hands to sell. Shareholders selling is what fuels the shorts and the hedge funds who support them. If you don't sell, they cannot do anything.We own the majority of the float. If you sell, you are simply fueling the very monsters who are trying to ravage your investment.If you hold, they will eventually run out of ammunition.This is not financial advice. This is common sense."
Yahoo keeps deleting my comment when I say that the CEO of Citadel says they play off people's emotions... remember that in case this gets deleted again.
"What the professionals fail to realize is we aren't buying AMC because of the business, we are buying the trade!!!"
"Friday, yes good ole manipulation...watching the ladder attack...buttttt...not selling one share...good weekend everyone enjoy the summer weather"
No more shares to borrow!!!
yahooo censorship on this board cost me a lot of money....
"The fact of the matter stays the same, FUD and shills aside, we absolutely will moon, the pressure on THEIR side is insurmountable. We have this in the bag just hold "
After this pops and make no mistake it will squeeze.....everyone should do some good with their money....pay a portion forward to help some ppl who are in need....
It should be a conflict of interest for citadel to hold positions when they are responsible for processing the transactions. Bring on more new rules!
Let's push $AMC over $47 by close.
My ex husband made 2.3 million dollars on AMC.
So Etrade is trying to get folks to get into their lending program.Second time they have sent me this email with an annual 2700$ payout.LOL NO THANKS!!
bought another 5 shares because it was under 40 dollars a great buying point!
Is it just me or does Yahoo only show five to six day old comments when you try to view the most recent comments?
Someone posted this weekend that CS bought a large amount at $58 ! I would think that would say that they think something big is going to happen. !why else would a brokerage invest at this level ?
"Folks, the whole key to this movement is to hold onto your shares. They can borrow and short all they want, but if the don’t get the actual shares, they will just go deeper in debt. I don’t believe this will be a typical squeeze as we have seen in the past. Slow and steady rise in price allows consolidation, allows higher lows to forms, and forces the shorts to pay compounded interest on their debt….and compounded interest is one of the true miracles in life, unless you are on the opposite side of it. Good luck to all!"
Only way this squeezes is marge calls! Will wait patiently.
why the after hours bounce?
"There is a nice piece on Franknetz. Recommends keeping emptions in check once the squeeze starts, write down your affirmations, goals and exit strategy. Trey's Trades also offers some excellent insight re. holding during the squeeze and exiting. Pays for all of us to be wise to the end and beyond the end."
Hey bashers and bots - we r not selling and shorties know it. They see those buy orders flying in.Not for sale
We are going to do whatever we have to get this to moon today! We have a lot more money left to put into this....I will sell my house like ken to get this to moon! We have to match the hedge fund commitment!
"Hedge Funds be like ""please dont let this stock get too high""...The stock:"
"There were some big money plays just before market close on Friday. $600k worth of call options were placed for AMC within the last 12 minutes of trading. On Sunday, news was released that Hedge Funds will now have to have 200% the regular margin requirements to short a stock. This means that Hedge Funds will need to have twice as much collateral in order to short a stock, meaning that there's a much bigger chance of them getting margin called. With this news, the big money plays on Friday, and this higher than normal pre-market volume, I can't help but this that there may have been some insider trading. Follow the big money people. This may be a very good week for AMC. BUY and HOLD!"
trading 212 have loaned out ALL AMC shares! Nothing else HF can do now. lmao
"Guess what? I love this stock! Bashers, repeat after me, AMC TO PLUTO BABY!!"
This week will be incredible this summer will be life changing
"Like we longs have been saying. Our amc shares are precious and we know what they r worth. Not selling, not single shareNot a Dave Portnoy (I still like him)Not for sale"
"HF managers, close out your positions. There is no reason to bet against $AMC anymore. In fact buy some shares for your clients. They are making money with the recovery in full swing. Vaccines are working. :D"
"(Copied and Shared)Good morning all, A very nice day yesterday indeed. well done. There seems to be a lot of anxiety today about the squeeze. Relax, there is one item on today''s agenda and only 1. That is to keep the share price as high as possible at the close. $55 would be a very good thing, $60 would be an amazing number. I know that looking at $61 this morning it is easy to say we are on our way higher. Expect an epic price battle today. I don't think the shorts and hedges are ready to wave the white flag just yet. I want to address the $60 price tag really quick. At a close above $60 there will be a requirement to cover around 50 million shares. Why is this important? Well if retail all hold, and we are all still holding and not selling even 1 share, and the institutions and insiders hold, there are not enough available shares to be purchased. That would lead several of those options needing to be covered with Ape shares and then the gamma squeeze kicks in and the price begins to head toward where we all would like for it be. HOLD EVERY SHARE. Buy what you can, be careful with your spending, nothing is 100% certain no matter how good it looks right now. Ignore the noise, it may very well get loud in here today. Feel free to copy and paste this as many times as you want. I have a feeling this post will be deleted much like several of my posts from yesterday afternoon. This is the way. I hold for you, you hold for me and together we go forward toward history."
"When it was $10, the BASHERS would tell us to sell. Now it’s trading between $50-60 and they’re desperately telling us to sell now  gotta love it. On that note, APES HOLD THE LINE!!"
"$AMC, no more shares to borrow!!!https://twitter.com/antoniothemexi/status/1409722779243585536?s=21"
Hedges are backing off some because the word is out everywhere about the Dark Pool.
"AMC INVESTORS; TO ALL THOSE INVESTORS THAT HAVE TD AMERITRADE, CHANGE YOUR ORDER FLOW PREFERENCES FROM the default to the 'IEX' EXCHANGEIEX, the Investors Exchange, A simple and transparent stock exchange dedicated to investor and issuer protection."
So far $2M+ in call options at $145 this morning alone!Let’s gooooo!HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
Yahoo Finance is censoring content. Just knowing this bolsters our resolve
Woow 5 million shares available to borrow just vanished!Only 200 k available nowLet's close over $40 today!
Green Day Tomorrow! 
The emaciated husk that is Sean Williams put out an amusing article this morning. the evil retail investors are ganging up and manipulating the market while the poor hedge funds suffer unjustly.
The short interest volume has increased from 94m to 102m as of Fri. now the total % shorted is 22.72%.
"All other chat boards are functioning as they ought to be. Why not AMC? I would very much like to read your replies, should I be able to find them."
"When we buy now, we are intercepting hedgies small packets of shares he's passing back and forth. That annoys him a lot..."
Reported short shares is now 92M up from 85M two weeks ago and 80M a month ago. Still shorting this beautiful stock. I’m holding for the big squeeze.
"Tomorrow should be a good day for AMC, lots of shorts paying up, buy, buy, buy"
Will it close green? It sure has been trying.
40 TODAY..
"the market manipulators are trying to make you sale, don't sale, instead buy more and hold with a Good strategies I was recommended to Ortex_Fx ,, On Telegram platform , the professional has an accurate trading strategies . And also stay ahead of market signals . It is imminent, soon the shorts are going to have to buy and the short squeeze is gonna send the price to the moon, stay calm and you are going to multiply your investment"
"They won’t allow me to post the link, but simply google the NYSE Threshold list. Here AMC has a “Y” status meaning that this FTDs that have been expired require mandatory maintenance, or covering basically. This greatly limits their ability to short as they will be required to buy according to the rules set in place by the NYSE."
It’s going down PM because it’s all they can do. There’s good news for AMC on multiple fronts today. When market opens it will go up. Shorts are toast!!
Media putting out a lot of negativity this weekend…..going to be a good green week. 
"My entire portfolio 1. Physical gold2. Physical silver3. 5,000 shares of AMC"
We know NOBODY is selling at this price. They're just moving them back and forth. Low volume is actually good news
"I love the bashing articles.. The more there is, the more I'm convinced this is THE play. Keep it coming."

"so much questionable activity in such a small stock? I strongly suspect illegal trading, likely on the part of hedge funds.Maybe they’re trying to make back some of their losses.MAYBE THEY WON’T BE ABLE TO, THAN IT SOARS!"
"This 4th of July ,,,The fireworks that AMCWill provide by the end of the week will be the best show-WorldwideI got a great spot reserved for the festivities 6.5 K and holding for as long as it takes-Got a good feeling about this week"
Good job $AMC! The squeeze is near! 
"There's lots of speculation that this is consolidation before the breakout, and the chart supports it (check the massive bullish pennant pattern on the daily chart). I know I know, it's been a long time since we've had a rip, but consolidating at higher levels is healthy for the chart. How do you think the people who bought in the single digits back months ago felt? They fought tooth and nail to keep their levels. That being said, this is not a logical stock, and don't be surprised if we trade sideways or dip until a possible breakout. Until then (and after) I'll keep holding on."
YF destroyed the vibe in this board. I rarely recognize any current names. I don’t know what they did but Yahoo is loosing subscribers by the boatloads. I canceled my paid subscription today. Not worth it when they are manipulating this chat room.
We create our dreams into reality. What we conceive we achieve
No one is selling so they can buy a Hyandai Elantra. Fight to the death. All or nothing.
"Yahoo will not let me post links but APES must vote ""NO"" to the creation/issuance of 25 million shares. Adam Aron is Director of Centricus Acquisition Group which is owned by Citadel. Look up sec.report/CIK/0001032673/Insider-TradesAPES have done their part to keep AFC afloat and now we need to get paid. We can happily revisit the need to create/issue 25 Million shares after AMC has squoze."
Hedgies have no way out. They can't short shares they dont have anymore (naked shorting) so now they have to ask the prime broker for shares..once all those are used up the cost to borrow will sky rocket and little hedgies cant afford to pay and bam there is the start of the end. They will cry collusion blah blah..Their only play is to put out FUD and bring the price down a few bucks and beg you to sell. Remeber we own 80 percent of shares we tell them our price.
DESPERATE bashers & Bots out in force…OUR DAY IS NEAR!HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
"At this point , out enemy is not Citadel or other HFs .. at this point our only enemy is our emotions that might force us into panic selling. Citadel - Ken Griffin already talked about it and he is confident that APES are like Bears ..look at the charts … HFs are scared and they are trying their best , their last attempt.. they are only betting on emotional weakness. They are heavily shorted when the price was around $10 .. they can’t logically drag the price that low because they are dealing with APES - HODL Pressure is on HFs to cover their position .. at any point if the stock crosses $63 and then $77, it will automatically trigger Margin calls- FOMO - panic covering and thats limit less upside. Think about it .. not a financial advice."
If they did a special dividend of .10c would they have to pay it to all the synthetic shares too? Or would this be a great way of exposing all the fake shares. In the whole scheme of things would be that expensiveZ
"$HOOD $AMCBye bye HOOD... I suggest anyone who is still holding: get out now!! I still think that when it hits $36 ($2 below the IPO start) and still sinking, we are close to a squeeze at AMC... AND, I think it wall all come to a head on or around September 25th... I'm just sayin'... Viva la AMC!!!"
"everything is being manipulated. not just the stock, but our social media platforms and chat forums. They're making it look like AMC is dying out slowly. IMO"
"In as much Mr Elon Musk has aided in the current liquidations,it's unavoidable,the market had it coming,time when traders and investors will be able to contain leverage positions. But considering the fact that crypto is the future it's also inevitable that another speculative growth is coming soon."
Thumbs up if you believe the AMC price will hit at least $65.00 today.
"No Motley Stool for 2 days, are they feeling well"
I love money. That's why I buy AMC stock.
"Why am I not getting the latest reactions, when there are 12,000 new posts? the most recent post is 2 wks old......strange!"
Citadel...
When I sign into yahoo everything is really choppy I mean I have a very hard time navigating through it it’s not my Wi-Fi our cell coverage checked them both when I sign out I can run through the message boards just fine anyone else experiencing this?
"Remember... play their game... by PUTS and when you're ahead sell them and buy more stock.Also, remember to put ALL your shares on a GTC order at 5,000.00 a share. This produces an 'on order' and prohibits the broker from loaning the shares!"
I could care less about short term taxes just pay it and use your remainder wisely
"Getting paid in a couple of days. Guess what. Buying more AMC.. Increasing my number of share every possible opportunity I am given as the squeeze lingers on. My profit opportunity further increases with time.. Very,very happy sitting and waiting for that check to clear."
Yahoo: Please restore the AMC MB so that we can see the Newest Reactions and Recently Discussed posts like we've always been able to do until just recently. We can do this on other YMB's. Why not the AMC MB???
The average person doesn’t go around bashing stocks unless they have an ulterior motive. AMC strong!!
"Why can't it be Monday tomorrow. Would love to see the HF's squirming right now . Over 10 MM shares out of the money. Wow. Over 140000 put options or over 14,000,000 Shares out of the money. lets see how they are going to cover these. They are definitely on extra morphine to whether the pain and eventual squeeze."
"Price means nothing at this point. They have billions of shares to cover and the whole world is realizing this. We have seen the desperate acts from HF to manipulate price via darkpool, shut down trading via robinhood, avoid FTDs via IWM etf, Dump large sell orders on open market and short darkpools to avoid SSR and the list goes on and on.. They wouldn't be doing all this if they weren't absolutely terrified of our power..All we been doing is holding and buying dips."
Love how the analyst's keep referring to the fundamentals. Eather they are all daff or they think we are.Fundamentals have absolutly nothing to do with this play! We are winning and the fake analysts who act as if the squeeze does not exist only strengthen our position! The more they try the more convinced I am of big things ahead!! Good luck to you all and hold and be strong!
"To all of those, who like me, are new to both investing in AMC, this chat room. WE ARE NOT PLAYING SPIN THE WHEEL! WE OWN THE WHEEL!"
Strong close AH bodes well for yet another great day tomorrow!Go AMC !!!!!!Let’s keep squeezing those SHORTS !
Gama squeeze then margin calls with short squeezes
BIG GEORGE W INCOMING... #AMC
The millions of dollars they are spending to try and drive this down day after day is mind boggling.
"Shorts have NOT covered...I repeat, shorts have NOT covered!"
Let shorts pay the interest and wait for margin calls. We will keep buying steadily and putting more pressureNot for sale
#amc.. I love it. ain't selling #@&#
Don’t let the low volume lately scare you. It’s lower because retail investors aren’t selling!! The short interest is almost 20%. Tic tock tic tock Hedgies 
"I have averaged up so much I see little profit now until the MOASS. But that is our goal. Buy 1, 5, 10 shares if you can. Over 4 million retail investors in this. We should own every share out there. You want that money? Theres no reward without risk so grow a pair and lets make the MOASS real!"
Tomorrow will be adding 1750 more shares throughout the day. I have still my shares kept in a safe without a code until we squeeze;).Going to exercise some of my options that are in the money and get more diamond shares. Long and strong till the end!
As soon as the price hits $40 the Yahoo comment section will suddenly break again XD
How much did it cost you to short today Hedgies closing green
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Thetraderguide.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
We will never leave until financial freedom and the squeeze is golden
Its easy to keep the price down when they are not routing our buy orders through the exchange. Sending them to the dark pools.
"$54.01!!! Hahhahaha. Love it. Have a great weekend. Me and my tens of thousands of AMC will be chillin by the pool. I can wait a year, two, three whatever. This is my early retirement!"
See you at $50 tomorrow
your about to see a lot of money show up here because everything is red and those algos are gonna dump market wide and jump on amc and gme frankly anything with high beta or squeeze potential.
"50 with fries please, by Friday thank you."
They tried to ladder it. It's going back up people. We CONTROL THE FLOAT.
"Random thoughts:If I log onto YF with my wife's account the threads are in perfect order - no trickery. With my account, they are all jacked up - so my account was targeted to encourage me not to post - just further motivationThe average amount of time for the SEC to bring charges against a firm is 5 years. Why does it take 5 years to build a case? you got me. But hey I would actually wait 5 years for this particular prize in the end (ps it won't actually take that long). I suggested a proactive peaceful protest outside the SEC back in March - but couldn't get any takers. Still not too late to get the signs and blowhorns out for the apes that live close by the SEC. Need someone to step up and organize locally. I'd like to start an AMC go fund me so that we have a large chunk of funds to use on a Friday at close to get options in the money. HFs do similar tactics but if we do it i'm confident the SEC will not hesitate to pounce on us. Not a political conversation but i halfway lost my respect for this supposed great country after what happened in the election. If the SEC lets HFs weasel out of this somehow, I will move out of this country and support someone else. Our Founding Fathers were so much better than our modern Govt. so we have gone backwards as a nation.Most buy orders routed to dark pool and all sell orders routed to the nyse? No wonder we can't get any traction. Yet this is legal to do. Something very wrong here.You watch these utube videos on chart analysis and it seems that we are supposed to just accept that buy orders in going to the dark pool. Share price would be much higher in nyse if this wasn't happening. To all new investors, all of us long timers were under water for long periods of time. You will come out on top in a big way if you hold too."
"To all short hedges.., you must be looking at the buy button very hard thinking if I buy in now I may can save some more pain as the price increases with hardly any limited shares left in the float!!!  I say do it NOW while you can still save yourself before the others beat you to it!!!! Better hurry and buy it is all I am saying!!!"
It’s like shorting using a high interest credit card. Right now it’s 18%. Citadel has the worst business plan in the history of the stock market. I’d be resigning too. Squeeze inevitable. Hodl
"I’m voting NO on the new shares Mr. AA .What I will do is, for every $1,000 in share price I will donate back to AMC 1 share.$1,000 ps = 1 share$2,000 ps =.2 shares$3,000 ps = 3 shares and so on."
Remember options have to be covered on the open market and don’t sweat the PM today.
tomorrow should be off the hook. 4 million retail investors at least 1/2 get paid tomorrow
"so many desperate shorts, you can see it in their words."
I don't even have an idea to sell my shares under $10 K + more they short higher my price goes .
"Anyone paid out any money for holding shares today? Nah, me neither  "
#AMC to the moon baby
Prepare price jump coming soon today
"AMC investors:Hedge funds and paid shills have underestimated the AMC investors currently holding the stock. Hedge funds arrogance and the reliance on algorithms have not helped hedge funds to achieve their goal(s) and this is why paid shills are still a heavy presence here on the AMC thread, as well as the HOOD thread. This battle is still ongoing with hedge funds believing they can continue to illegally naked short and to 'park buy orders' in the order flow process while dumping 'sell' orders on the open market, with the hope that investors, seeing a small spike' will get bored of the continuous 'ups and downs' of the stock and be motivated to sell. I cannot provide a date on the expected squeeze but can tell you that patience will reward. We are waiting on any one of the potential catalysts to propel this stock to new highs and there are some major economic events expected to impact the markets and those events will most likely impact AMC in a positive manner. Remember, AMC IS BACKED BY BILLIONS OF SYNTHETIC SHARES. While I worry about my positions in other stocks, I do not worry about AMC. THE QUESTION IS NOT 'IF' A SQUEEZE WILL OCCUR, IT IS 'WHEN' AND ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT IT IS INEVITABLE!!!"
How can you go wrong with a stock that closed higher every Friday for the last 4 weeks. SIMPLE ANSWER - YOU CAN'T
#APESUNITED#WERENOTLEAVINGBUY & HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
"Lookout for bashers using catchy and reversed names pretending to be apes and saying the price will go down, these are NLP experts working for the HF trying to get you to sell Just ignore and hold You know there is not more shares. “they have to cover”"
"Some thoughts. Elon M is using his doge and crypto profits to hurt the short companies as much as possible. Kenny G and Michael B made a deal to punch back on Elon M by shorting Tesla and the ""meme stocks"" and crypto. As announced by Burry last week. I could be wrong of course but i have this idea. And the feeling we have Elon M. on our side."
"AMC Entertainment ($AMC) has taken over the online forums and stock trends over the last few weeks.The leader of the recent meme-stock rally has been on fire. Shares have risen almost 400% over the last month, despite the stock being down 22% from the highs set earlier this month.With all the crazy things going on and my limited time/ability to day trade I have found https://stockhaul.today/6wd9a7 useful"

"I am not a financial advisor.I am 66 yo. I retired after 4 years of active duty (Marine) and 39 years as a Professional Project Manager.I know a thing or two because I've seen a thing or two.For myself, when I see AMC going sideways and not breaking away as I expect it to, I need to remind myself of my strategy and that is to HOLD ON FOR DEAR LIFE (HODL).I will NOT sell my shares until Short Interest is dropping, which means the shorters are covering.I will NOT sell based on the FEAR OF MISSING OUT (FOMO).I will have patience and wait until the time is right and that is likely about the time the stock has peaked and is starting its downward trend.I do not have any recommendations for what you should do, but the more that HODL, the more likely it will be that the share price will go up, and I mean way up.I will be tempted to cash out when I taste big money (during a Gamma Squeeze), but that is not the best time for me to get out.I want the MOTHER OF ALL SHORT SQUEEZES (MOASS).I am going for the big stuff and that will only happen if I HODL and have patience.I will let this day-to-day #$%$ bounce all over the place and generally go sideways, but at some point, the games will end and the hedgies will need to cover and then the big show will begin and I will win.That is all.Carry on.APES TOGETHER STRONG"
SSR in effect…AA Tweets new share vote is off the table…shorty’s interest skyrocketing…ooooo gonna be a NICE day!HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
Yahoo fix your comment board. It works on every other ticker symbol I've checked.
Bulls remember these 4 words “ Shorts have to COVER “ To the moon 
Jim Cramer says “HOLD!!!!!”
Is it ok for retailers to print up new shares at home or is that only ok for market makers? Asking for a friend.
No stop losses. We don’t have sell buttons until after the short squeeze. Just buy and hold then spread the word
Looks AMC cancellation withdrew of secondary offering today.. Should skyrocket tomorrow.. No more additional shares needed! Wow! That is why options took off! Yahoo!
10 million shares shorted today and we still end green
*UPDATE: AMC Says Total Global Box Office For 'F9: THE FAST SAGA' Over $400MYOWSA !
SURVEY: Which Ape/Apette bought or bought more AMC because of the unusual bashing activity? Thumbs up if you did. I did!!!!
AMC WILL SQUEEZE. THEY NEED TO BUY BACK 1B SHARES. HODL & BUY.
Buys outwieghing sells 2 to 1 and the price drops.Yea nothing to see here.Holding keeping droping it and we will keep buying.
"n 2017, Citadel Securities paid more than $22 million to settle a case with the SEC, which alleged the firm misled customers about whether they were getting the best price on trades. Last year, it was fined $700,000 by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority over allegations the firm traded ahead of some orders"
"looks like Yahoo deleted a lot of posts, especially from the Top Posts. What's going on?"
"STOP! PLEASE READ Before you think about selling because people (bashers) are telling you to because this stock is so bad, Ask yourself this question, why did Charles Schwab Investment Firm (Hedge Fund) buy 328,000,000 million shares of AMC stock at 58 dollars the other day if it was a bad investment."
SHARE: On Friday 25th $AMC appeared on the NYSE “Threshold List” This occurs when a stock has 5 or more CONSECUTIVE days of shares that failed to settle.--we may have just won all :)
The fact so much money is being wasted to keep us from getting what we deserve speaks volumes.
"Let me explain why this will be the moass in wallstreet history (this parabolic squeeze will probably never happen again). The retail investor in AMC are very average people with normal jobs working until retirement. They know that AMC is quite literally their one shot at financial freedom (which is the strongest motivation of all, to hold) to finally quit their job and do what makes them happy. The retail investor knows AMC can in fact bankrupt citadel because of all the manipulation that they have done. Their goal was to bankrupt AMC and pay no taxes at the end of the day. This was being naked shorted into oblivion at 2 - 4 dollars a share!!!! It's 54 now! Citadel is finished and the squeeze is going to be monumental. Retail doesn't sell and 100k 500k per share is very real. There is no way out for hedge funds or other shorts. #retailholdsforfreedom"

"The AMC squeeze happened on July 22, 2021, the stock price jumped to $100khttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Theatres"
They have billions of synthetics owed while we own the outstanding float
"$59 is cheaper than $110-120, and $120 is cheaper than $180... Simple math to keep a healthy xhort position, fellas."
Yahoo is allowing the bashers to post negative while blocking the positive comments. They are a bought media source!
BUY MORE
Let’s go to 50
"BYPASS DARKPOOLS FYI some online brokers have a direct trading option that enables investors to specify that their orders be executed directly with an exchange, instead of a clearinghouse. Its clearinghouse orders that can be bulk routed to dark pools folks.Investigate your broker's direct trading options and if they don't have one - change to one that does.Bypass the darkpool! This is the way."
"We're having a green day today. No matter how hard they've tried, they can't hold the price down anymore. I don't like throwing numbers out there, so I'm just saying green today."
HF are falling. The hole is getting bigger. We all know when we dig a hole sooner or later if it gets bigger and bigger.Let’s NOT pretend we all knowSo what’s it take for this to happenWe buy responsibly We HOLDWe do NOT sell without 1 dream ever coming trueWe NEED to trust and believe in the movement and we need to support and stick togetherThis will all happen even if you do not think it will and with all the desperate bashers trying to get you to sell because they want your shares. Don’t give them up that easy. Think!!! Why are there people in here desperate to get you to sell something YOU paid forMore behind this and we all know it.￼
"More FUD stories. Same one that told you to sell at 10, 15, 20, 25, etc. Not selling!"
"I love this!! With little volume we are FN consolidating at 60. Do you even understand what that means and how strong this stock is??? It also confirms we truly do own the float. Noone is selling. We’ve shaken out virtually all of the paper hands. The true apes live on and mark my words (not setting dates), but one nice little catalyst and you’re going to see something no1 has ever seen in the stock market in its history! The more bashers you see, the more nervous they really are. Theres no need for bashing if things are going your way. Common sense! That’s why I get pumped seeing negative articles, bashers, shills, etc etc...they dont get that they are making zero difference at this point! Instead of wasting their time, the should cover and/or go long on AMC! Hodl on Apes!"
Hedge funds/institutions pay and own news media’s to manipulate the retail investors as pawns for profits. I’m all in AMC. I’m saying no more to blatant manipulation from Dark pools.
"AMC will not close above $56 today due to extreme manipulation by hedge funds. They do not want to cough up on options expiring between $56 to $60 which would yield substantial losses for them. It's a fix using synthetic shares. But they won't get away with it forever, cos we're holding and buying more, whilst they keep shorting and paying high interest charges. Whilst they may own the clocks as to when AMC squeezes, but we the Apes most certainly own the time.HODL tight."
"Longs that understand SUPPLY and DEMAND, will buy all they can and hold for record breaking numbers.......I hope shorts remain stubborn and don't cover.....I can handle 1000...2000...5000...10,000% gains on the way to the largest squeeze in Wallstreet history....I'm hoping we start the PERPETUAL squeezes at 500..."
"Hedgies won’t start freaking out until the volume dries out and they realize we ain’t selling... day traders giving the hedgies BS back forth little volume - soon when the volatily dies down, day traders will leave it, we won’t sell it and the hedgies won’t be able to cover or grind our their position - that’s when we fly... in the meantime ok to buy, but hold and don’t day trade this"
"If shorts do not close before share count it will be a huge mistake. If we find out that the float is much bigger than currently advertised, the days to cover may turn into weeks to cover or even worse, if they have to buy more shares than us retail own, we could all just hold and name our price before the action even starts. Why would we even sell one share."
Still HOLDING. I love AMC and I trust the movement. Army is growing
Hold for gold.
We love buying and holding this has massive upside coming. Biggest opportunity I’ve ever seen in the market. Buy now or chase $100+. This will goto extraordinary levels. The whole world is behind our movement and buying
Shorts are down billions and trillions over leveraged and drowning. September 1st. Reverse repo is cut off to institutions. Everyday until then will be over one trillion in borrowing from the reverse repos. Breaking records daily
Funny how yahoo has to delete comments favoring AMC but keeps shills comments in place.
yahoo is scattering out everyone's posts only trying to confuse and seperate us. It will never happen.Always check top 10 amc youtube videos for the best updated info / Together united we will more thanwin we will conquer and transfer wealth and call out corruption that will change stock market forever!!
"I jumped on the bandwagon at $34 this afternoon, glad to be aboard!....Now I'm excited to watch this thing blow past $60."
Sellers exhausted ! Strong hands  holding amc now !
"I dont mind these low volume days, we had a few days near A BILLION, we need to cool off the avg share volume to increase the days to cover."
Looks like the theater business is booming. Bears lied.

I smell a short squeeze and gama squeeze upon us
Muted at least 50 haters today.

Just bought 95 more shares Lets push it today
Celebrating 420 style knowing massive gains coming for those who conceive they will achieve
Why does Yahoo have all the top posts from 3 days ago?
"I WILL START SELLING ABOVE $40,000 PER SHARE !!!"
I’m ready for it. &. “IT” WILL BE HJGE 
The squeeze most likely coming in 13 days. that's my opinion and DD. Let's see . Be ready just in case.
Back to $40 tomorrow and let's make the shorts get shorter I'm holding since I bought in for $25.25!!! 
Today $60+ definitely. Nobody has so much money as 5m individual investors willing AMC going to the moon.
Citadel during the squeeze
"Millions of FTD shares. Where are you going to get them? I'll start the bidding at the introductory price of $1000 for my first 10 shares. It goes up in increments of $1000 for each subsequent block of 10 until we hit 100k. That's a bargain, ask around."
APE THINK: The short HF’s I would expect are consolidating these short positions into a few shell entities to isolate the massive future losses and subsequently drive these shell companies into bankruptcy at some point to eliminate the need to cover. A Lawsuit could head off this scenario to expose it early with the law suit discovery and close that escape door.
"I drive past AMC, here in Vegas, everyday - its 10 min from house, off freeway. I can easily see the parking lots. And guess what?THEY ARE ALWAYS FULL NOW:)"
We retail investors will go down in history for the BIGGEST G.M.O.A.S.S. #AMCARMY #AMC
we cracked $60 with ease . imagine if the momentum keeps up! you are investing in a company who had debt to no debt. Who struggled through the pandemic. With each and everyone's support the theaters will survive . we will see 100s soon. apes stronger together
Hedgies is so desperate that they playing with themselves again overnight. The red premarket is just residue left on the bed between Sean William of MF and the Hedgies. We will rip today + 10% at least. BookIt!
The math doesn’t lie …holding since 801
that's the fakest sell ever and the most obvious ladder attack by hedgefunds..it won't work..were going to the moon. it's official
i dont pay any interest to hodl so i will keep holding. not financial advise
"This weekend I read an article that was written with the intent to dissuade people from investing in AMC, stating that the stock was overpriced and the shorts would win the battle over the longs. It urged people to get out. I researched the author, and found another article written by him in February- telling people that the stock was overpriced (at $5.80), the short squeeze was over (from what- $2.00?) and people should get out. Both articles stated that the author had no positions in the stock ""at the time of the writing"". If that's the case- the author should find another profession, or should at least write about things he actually knows something about."
"in the end it doesn't matter they are using more short shares to drive the price down they can not claim any profit from the stock dropping without buying the short back in, covering is a mandatory part of the shorting process it is unavoidable there is absolutely no way to get out of a short position without buying back shares"
"Looking back over the last couple of months of the AMC rise, I came across another price channel that appears to be similarly played out to where we are now.From May 13th to May 21st we were stuck in a price channel between around $12 to $14. When we first went to $12 on May 13th, we had volume of 296 million, the following 3 days we averaged around 185 million in volume and tested the $14 price only to be rejected on May 18th.On May 19th, 20th, and 21st volume dropped dramatically as we have seen occur this week, averaging around 66 million volume per day or roughly 1/3rd the volume from May 13th to the 18th.AMC proceeded to drop from a close of $14.03 on May 18th to a close of $12.08 on May 21st. Again sound like a similar trend?On May 24th, a Monday, volume returned and AMC shot from $12.08 to $13.68, Tuesday May 25th it closed at $16.41, Wednesday May 26th, $19.56, Thursday the 27th, $26.52, and Friday May 28th it closed at $26.12.The point of this is we are seeing a similar pattern develop over the last few weeks where we are in a channel that has consolidated beautifully. This channel is now 10 days old and is wound so tightly that when it explodes it could be wild and violent to say the least.We are showing characteristics of something ready to occur as volume has now tailed off, this tells me no one is really selling.A more telltale sign is that short interest as of Friday June 25th was up again as once again shorts borrowed more than they returned.We now sit with the following numbers per ORTEXSHARES ON LOANCurrent97.13m remember 102 million gets us to 20% of free floatThis data is as of close on Wednesday as the T+2 rule makes us wait for trades to clear.% FREEFLOAT ON LOANCurrent18.99%UTILIZATION OF BORROWED SHARESCurrent91.35%Now this is from close of business yesterdayEstimatedCurrent Short Interest95.45m meaning this many shares are what shorts are paying interest on which is due next week by the way.Bottom line is this, every hurricane takes time to develop, takes time to strengthen takes time to make landfall, but when it does it can cause devastation to anyone in its way. Shorts are in our way and Hurricane AMC is building to a category 5 with this 10 day consolidation.When the volume comes back and the buyers strike its gonna be fun."
"Sorry folks but I’m gonna have to sell when it hits $1,000,000.00"
"Some great news from the SEC:AMC Entertainment was added to the NYSE Threshold Securities list on Friday, June 25th"
"It’s not over 60 because there is only selling pressure. Don’t sell, just hold. Do you think when you buy a stock it isn’t queued up by the MM and bought through the dark pools as they see fit ? Total market manipulation. We hold the float. SEC do your job and not what you were bribed to do . Get some integrity ."
"Nothing but negative articles about AMC. That means buy, buy, buy."
"AMC is the one hedgies want most to bring down cos they're losing the most on it. They could have got us long ago had it not been for our unity in purpose. It's our unity that took the price to $72 and it is our unity that can take us there again and far far higher. We will stand together fellow Apes and HODL and BUY more with the cash if we can. Hedgies have to cover all stock short sold, and we will be waiting when they do start properly covering."
"The most important thing for us to do is buy what we can and hold what we have. Ape army strong today and for as long as it takes until they pay, and pay and pay. We own this."
Great sustained move upwards today.
Were still here shillsOh and btw Norway yes the nation juat bought 1% of AMC.Vikings off the starbard bow Hed.gies
Went to theatres this week for first time since Covid and I must say it feels great to support AMC in theatres and in stock market Waiting for this to take off
"On Wednesday, market makers, which are also DTCC clearing members, will have to tighten up their short-selling belts. Because their available capital will be contrasted more frequently with member deposits, their ability to maintain massive short positions is slated to be crippled.Current State of the AMC/GME SagaIn case you haven’t yet grasped the basics of short selling, here is a brief recap of basic indicators (we’ll get to the breaking news afterward). The foremost among them is the short interest percentage, referring to the number of shorted shares divided by outstanding shares.According to Ortex data, as of today, both AMC and GME stocks have relatively high estimated short interests, AMC at 13.64% and GME at 14.54% (17% on May 28) of free float.Above 10% is considered high, while above 20% is extremely high, which translates to more investors thinking the stock price will fall. Of course, bullish short squeezers tend to use this metric as an opportunity to buy the dip, counting on the stock to rebound.￼￼AMC and GME price moves in 2021, source: TradingViewRegarding the free float, also called public float, it refers to the number of shares available for public trading by using the following formula:Free float = outstanding shares – restricted shares – closely-held sharesWith these two metrics in mind, we arrive at the short-interest ratio, as the number of shorted shares divided by average daily trading volume. This is one of the key factors that enter the consideration when to take short positions. The higher it is, the longer it would take to repurchase the borrowed shares, which is why it is commonly known as the days-to-cover ratio.A ratio above 10 would indicate a negative outlook on the stock. As of May 28 report, AMC’s short ratio was 0.7 with 20.3 million shares sold short, while GME’s short ratio was at 1, with 11.97 million shares sold short. Meaning, they were both bullish indicators."
i love the stock
"There is something very wrong here. If yahoo is blocking messages that either favor/don't favor specific companies, then this could be considered to violate SEC trading laws. - could someone with connections to trey/matt/another big youtuber get them to talk about this? imagine if someone filed a lawsuit on Yahoo for this"
"I will not sell till hedge funds cover it's as simple as that I've been holding since January 28th and haven't sold a single share I joined this movement for something bigger than the 2 commasand I can guarantee you atleast 3 million apes feel the same way we are strong, apes hold!"
"Please try send below complaint off to SEC if you canTo: chairmanoffice@sec.govcc commissionerpeirce@sec.gov; commissionercrenshaw@sec.gov; commissionerroisman@sec.govSubject: Market Manipulation - AMC EntertainmentDear Mr GenslerI would like to draw your attention to market manipulation activity happening on an indutrial scale on range of stocks including AMC listed on US Exchanges by market makers operating in the dark pool.Brokerages such as Fidelity which routes retail orders through NYSE reports day in day out the buy orders for AMC outnumbering sell orders by nearly 2 to 1, yet the price has been falling consistently now for the past month. It is falling because brokerages such as Robinhood,TD Ameritrade and Charles Shwab, attracted by payments for order flow, are routing retail orders through dark pool market makers such as Citadel and Virtu which routes sell orders to lit exchanges on receipt and park buy orders in their books; eventually releasing it to lit exchanges as and when it favours them.In fact, on option expiry days, you can almost exactly predict to the dime where the price of stocks manipulated in this manner will finish at end of day trading.My question to you Sir is: Why is the SEC allowing Citadel and other clearinghouse money makers/broker-dealers to route over 50% of all the AMC retail buy orders to dark pools and sell orders to the market, thus effectively truncating AMC market price?United States prides itself as a free fair and competitive market driven economy. However, the above practice appears anything but. It is pure manipulation by and to the benefit of a single entity Citadel, and to the detriment of tens of millions of retail investors. This needs to be investigated and the practice ended as a matter of URGENCY,Sincerely"
AMC is trending now on Yahoo. Cool. :)
5 minutes till closing bell. Take a chance of a lifetime and get in now!!
Large buys from Fidelity & Blackrock today!

"WE APES KNOW WHY WE ARE HERE , WE CHANGE THE LIVE OF MANNY PEOPLE !!!!WE WILL..."
So awesome! I moved funds around expecting to buy around 60. I got more at 55. Thanks to consolidation!
"At $72.62, ALL short positions EVER opened during regular trading hours will be in the red and building losses! Looking forward to seeing that day come!"
"I can guarantee that a lot of APES! are just like me, a guy who has a working man's job and has been involved in the markets for a time just so he can eventually get by. That ""get by"" has been hijacked a lot in the past 30 years of investing. I have too many sad songs to sing (ONT, NYFX, currently CYDY) terrific companies that are getting or were driven into the ground by the man. AMC is our push back, our revenge!! I bought more today and will tomorrow. APES! stay strong and long and win!"
"Buying shares that route to Citadel is like throwing a hot dog down a hallway. If you are still buying, switch to a broker that gives you the option of routing directly to the exchange instead - TD and Fidelity come to mind. . If everyone did this during this year the price of a share would be in the thousands."

Did you guys see the news regarding RH paying out $70 million in fines for the January outages they had? Made my day!!
"all we have to do is hodl, for epic transfer wealth back to the average investor, imo"
"As many of you know I like to follow charts. I ask you to go have a look at the last time on the AMC one month chartthe price fell below the 10 day average like today near the closing. Make sure you're looking at the 1 month interactive chart on Yahoo using the 10 day 50 day and 200 day averages.Also make sure you're using one day intervals. Now look back to January 10th when the price dropped below the 10 day average, what happened next? The price went from $42.81 on the 10th to $59.04 by the 15th before any real pull-back didn't it? I'm not saying that AMC will repeat a $16.23 spike again but as all of us Apes know already, it sure could couldn't it?GO LONGS..!"
Not expecting much... I take every day as it comes... This is not an emotional transaction for me.. why? Because I would lose out.. I'm staying for the gold not these pennies they are throwing at us..
"Half a year ago shorts needed to cover millions and millions of shares. We were fighting between $5-$15. Now, more people have bought in, surely many sold as well, but shorts need to cover at least the same amount of shares. The play is the same, the price is already much higher. Remember that we have time and the current situation is much better compared to half a year ago. You all saw what a small covering of shorts + FOMO + gamma could do ($70+). Imagine what happens the next time someone covers. Absolutely bullish and holding until I am rewarded. Not financial advice."

New reactions doesn’t work - Yahoo is engaged in indirect share price manipulation.
any shares purchased under $500 a share are still considered bargain basement prices.
"Payday today! Time to load up some additional shares, anything below $100 is still a bargain imo. Look at the trend, DD and potential catalysts lining up. Whether it's next week, next month or next year, this is going to fly. Not financial advice"
"Putting aside all of the short squeeze and other fun stuff aside, we as shareholders need to start thinking about how to protect our investment thru this next share offering. While everyone is free to cote any way they want, lets please not be blinded by this side talk of ""if you vote YES, you will be diluting your share price and other"". Bottom line is every single company raises cash thru a share offering and in this case an AMC offering ATM price is exactly what we need to to protect our investment long term and further solidify the share price. Sure there is always a drop when new share flood the market but that's normal and temporary. The best example is the latest GME ATM offering that closed today at a share price of $225. Who would have thought that GME was even going to survive until last January when the regular investors decided to take things into their own hands. Despite all the pundits screaming that GME should be bankrupt and that they have no long term model and other, they were proven wrong and by bringing in the right management team, GME is here to stay. Forget that it was at over $400 and other. That was a temporary spike based on shorts and other FOMO factors.The same can be said here about AMC. Simply put; It will never ever go back to $5 if we don't want it to. We the regular investors have also staged a similar coup here and need to be patient and do what's right. The CEO has a plan to go out there and acquire other assets and pivot the business outside of just movie theatres. Yes, we can make some quick money in the short term but trust me that won't pan out if we don't send a message that AMC is here to stay and therefore you can short it at $5, $10, $20, $30, it just won't go back unless we have weak hands and let it go. The ride that GME has gone thru has and will continue to reward the diamond hands. Some cashed out (which is great) and others are in it longer term. Bottom line, if we are to take advantage of this imminent squeeze and ensure we protect what we invested, we need to really also think long term to ensure the share price stays above $30, $40 and even $50.I will be voting YES but its your choice and just my 2 cents from experience . Keep in mind I am holding 18,000 shares and while I went in initially to make a quick buck (and I have), I have realized the power of the APES and realized I can continue to make money on this but we need the majority of the APES to be on the right side."
if the shorts shorted say 2 million shares at 60 and bought back at 54. that's 12 million to put towards there losses. correct.
"Patience APES, seems like they are trying to tire us out. So two simple points to take note:1. Buy the DIPS to counter the short attack2. Continue to HOLD, it’s FREE!! "
I funny feeling today we will be closing green
I smell $65 this morning..DIAMOND HANDS HOLD STRONG !!!AMC to $1000
"$4 stock is now consolidating over $50 and the bashers are saying ""it cant even hold 60"" LMAO are the HFs picking these shills up off the streets?"
"don't expect the squeeze today, we hold as long as necessary!"
YF fix your chat room you are being discussed everywhere for supporting HF/bashers.
BYE - BYE - BYE === DO NOT BUY!! Based on 5 Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets for AMC Entertainment in the last 3 months. The average price target is $8.17 with a high forecast of $16.00 and a low forecast of $1.00. The average price target represents a -82.16% change from the last price of $45.80.

"State of New Jersey common pension fund D bought 229,643 AMC shares in the second quarter. It hadn’t owned any shares of the movie-theater chain at the end of the first quarter."
We'll now likely see a retest of the 50 day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Down to $37.

My comment about citadel playing off emotions got deleted for the third time in the last 2 days.
Funny how the bashes dissappear when the stock climbs! Little B-otches
Bought 100 shares @ 54...averaged up to 14$.....I will keep buying regardless of averaging up to 54! We own the float! AMC strong from Canada!
"Me and all my family and friends own more then s million share, average $7 to all the way $48 , we all holding long and strong"
I feel the reason they have held off on covering their short position is because they feel if they drag this out long enough we will settle for $300-600 per share. I’m sorry but we start selling at $5000. They have the money! Don’t sell for pennies! Time to make it right!
"To those of you who are new. You may have felt compelled to sell your shares @$57.99 this morning and are now regretting it. This is a buy and hold situation. This is nothing but an unmitigated attack by the shorts, those who are shorting the stock, in the hope you will sell your shares. To do so would give them legitimacy, as they are selling synthetic shares. I am not a financial advisor, but do have a vested interest in AMC, recently becoming a share holder. This isn't about the volatility in the share price, but rather a cause, forcing those who have, for years, beaten down those without a voice. We are their collective voices, as we fight for both ourselves, as with them. The end goal is to have the shorters cover5 their positions, at which time the price of the shares will rise substantially, there technically being no limit on how high they could conceivably go. So, in conclusion, buy shares when the price dips and hold!"
Top reactions from 4 days ago? Really Yahoo?
Shorts have spent billions trying to wait this out. Trading both ways and trading options to try and scratch out some liquidity to keep them afloat. It’s the equivalent of having a maxed out credit card and continually paying the minimum
You do all realize yesterday's low on AMC was $52.97 right? Look at today's low... $54.33.And correct me if I'm wrong but yesterday's high was only $56.29 correct? Today's AMC high of $59.36 so far with 2 1/2 hours left? Do you see any trend here?
"$AMC $HOOD...AMC: Can you say FIFTY DOLLARS?!! Very soon!!...HOOD: Can you say FORTY DOLLARS?!! Very soon!!...Seems to me, Citadel is putting everything it has in TRYING to raise the share price at HOOD, while AMC zooms up and up and up..."

They trying to keep it under 60. Everybody buy at least one share. 60 is cheap compared to what it will be when it squeeze.

I bought 100 more abd now sitting at 1100 $500 minimum sell Shorts are screed
Yahoo deleting my post so let me make it short and to the point-002 forces hedgie to short on the open market rather than the massive amounts they cannot afford in the dark pools- So short interests rises and quickly at that.- Market makers love what they see and will drive the price up to squeeze the new short positions in the 57-70 range. This is when volume increases and then FOMO. - when we pass through this range the squeeze begins as shares available to short on the market become limited and there is no choice but to close their positions.- this does not include synthetic shares and the FTDs being ignored.- we can not assign a date but with rising short interest the sharks will come out to okay and drive AMC upwards and soon. -
"It’s a simple 3 word combination “SHORTS HAVE TO COVER”. Don’t worry about the day to day fluctuations, yes it can be frustrating, I get frustrated too, but at the end of the day, shorts are likely over 20% short of the float deep, that’s insanity, and on top of that Apes own most of the float. Just hold and wait till the covering begins or margin calls occur, this will be crrrraaayyyzzyyyyy, 4 digits minimum."

Anyone else notice the dip price is getting higher and higher? I really just think the HF's underestimate just how much some of us want see them burnt 
We should all go to AMC and watch Free Guy opening date aug.13 being released only in theaters. If that tops 100 million imagine what the stock would do. Then see what the shills say.
"Now the world is seeing how easily Citadel can control a stock and profit at will. Short selling with their algorithms and the dark pool heavily weigh in their success factor over the retail investor. They take the order flow, massage it, and release it in a way that fits their narrative. If they want to let it ride up to short it and then ride it back down, easy breezy for them. They have been doing this to us for months now. They are making profits from this and would not be able to play like this if they did the right thing and closed their positions. This is why the number one thing that has to change is defaults by the hedge funds. They should be up to date, all the time. Instead they get puny fines for not delivering and then they use the money they got from borrowing and selling our shares to fight us.Most companies would have perished with this type of artificial pressure from the hedges. Gladly though, AMC retail investors are in a unique position. Eventually the hedges will have to pay us back. There is no way around that fact and the price will skyrocket. They could keep shorting and controlling the gaps to make money and that may be a good thing for us. Maybe they can profit enough to pay us when it is time."

In the last month, if your money was in here for the last month alone you would be up @ 90% and for the past 6 months, up over 2000%. Keep things in perspective and don't worry about the little day to day ups and downs. This still has a long way up to go so HODL (not financial advice)."
I love this chat. Stock goes $60 to $59. And all these bashers are out in full force.
"Retail investors collectively are in charge of the price. Not anyone else. As long as you HOLD and ADD as and when you can, the price WILL continue to go up. Its simple, HOLD and ADD and stay together until the Squeeze comes. It will come."
"My summary:1. NO price in the 30's will get anyone to sell.2. Prices in the 20's will cause a tidal wave of buying.Whatcha gonna do Hedgies???  Not sure your team of psychologists are going to help you here, best start the rise upwards and get them to earn their money with how to shake us out that way instead. Handy hint, you are wasting your time below about $500 per share, so maybe start there.#AMC - HOLDING INDEFINITELY. WHATEVER IT TAKES. "
"APE SUPPORTINGCopied in:Good morning all, A very nice day yesterday indeed. well done. There seems to be a lot of anxiety today about the squeeze. Relax, there is one item on today''s agenda and only 1. That is to keep the share price as high as possible at the close. $55 would be a very good thing, $60 would be an amazing number. I know that looking at $61 this morning it is easy to say we are on our way higher. Expect an epic price battle today. I don't think the shorts and hedges are ready to wave the white flag just yet.I want to address the $60 price tag really quick. At a close above $60 there will be a requirement to cover around 50 million shares. Why is this important? Well if retail all hold, and we are all still holding and not selling even 1 share, and the institutions and insiders hold, there are not enough available shares to be purchased. That would lead several of those options needing to be covered with Ape shares and then the gamma squeeze kicks in and the price begins to head toward where we all would like for it be.HOLD EVERY SHARE. Buy what you can, be careful with your spending, nothing is 100% certain no matter how good it looks right now. Ignore the noise, it may very well get loud in here today.Feel free to copy and paste this as many times as you want. I have a feeling this post will be deleted much like several of my posts from yesterday afternoon.This is the way. I hold for you, you hold for me and together we go forward toward history.Enjoy the day."
60% of volume is going through dark pools buy and hold for financial freedom
I can write now that the trading day is over....buying more and holding more soon!!!!
When you have been buying constantly since Jan and you still have FOMO. I can't get enough shares to HODL
Hedgies have themselves to blame for the stock going to the moon!!They have pretty much shorted the whole float!!!Meaning this will hit ultimate highs!!!Thank you hedgies!!!
Why is so many people mentioning the 60$ target for yesterday? Last time I check 40$ strike had a substantial amount of contracts already... Am I missing something?
"Here we go again, just keep messing with the board yahoo, do your job for the HF"
Hedge fund life lines & under handed tricks are being reduced daily. Someone is going to have to show the world the market is not rigged against investors. There is going to be businesses that are going to take the heat and the fall. The Feds are not going to accept blame.They are going to prove you can hit big buying shares in the market.And that’s what going to happen.
"I'm just chilling, squeeze is inevitable"
hope this rockets soon we need a new tractor for the farm!
I spent about $60 at AMC last night and bought more shares today
"Lots of people trying to bring AMC down, but it’s holding up very strong. Therefore, finally I am in AMC and holding strong…"
Share price does not reflect true supply and demand. Realistically this should be at 5x the price if you remove dark pool. Buy orders routed via darkpool and sell orders dumped on NYSE. We know the game they are playing and they got caught. This has to stop!
F9' has highest opening weekend of the pandemic with $70 million box office haulShorts can eat the fundamentals as well 
This has been a long consolidation in the 50's. Time for a breakout!
"wow the fud is strong today, you know theyre worried haha"
Current price at 56.28 AMC is still over $3.25 above Friday's low of $52.97 and almost$2.00 above yesterday's low. Congrats to all APES..!

"Good post if yahoo don't deleteDo y’all not realize that most people hold index funds for years and get a 7-11% return on their investment year over year. Stop saying this day or that day and just hold. If the squeeze comes in November we will literally be able to say we increased our investment in the hundreds to 1000%. So yes while getting rich over night would just be a dream come true, take a step back realize considerable gains can come but stop getting people set up to be disappointed. Hell even if it takes us months to stair step to 1k, 5k whatever the pay off will be well worth it if everyone just keeps their emotions in check. Have belief in the stock and just hold. Not financial advice but this is how I am approaching amc."

"As retail investors, we don't have access to super computers to manipulate the stock price of any stock. But HF do. Now Motley wants to blame us for buying and holding. Really? When you buy and hold over a year. You pay less in taxes in that calendar year. But now al of a sudden. You want us to sell. And subject ourselves to a swing trade liability in taxes. When. the tax code clearly favors buy and hold. Especially now that you've gotten caught making to many cookies. And you want us to return them so you can clean up your mess. No thanks, we'll do it for you. And don't go away mad, just go away."

They can’t borrow your shares if you’re not in margin Something that’s been questioned recently
F9: THE FAST SAGA’s estimated $70 million U.S. opening weekend is the largest for any movie since STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER in 2019. The total global box office for F9: THE FAST SAGA already exceeds $400 million.
Surely there's Lawers over there in the states who are into investing into stocks and shares who have either heard about this illegal shambles or are even investing in amc who can use tools at there disposals to look into what's happening here and make some calls HELP THE LITTLE PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT TO INVEST INTO A FAIR AND LEVEL FIELD
oh i wish i bought at the dip...Checks notes... I DID!!!!Thanks Motley tool and you shills for the great advice
AMC makes the NYSE Threshold list again today!!!!!
Imagine people selling because its not going up fast enough. Worst idea ever. This could be one of the surest bets in the stock market to make you good money. All you have to do is HOLD. Easy peazy lemon squeezy.
"To ALL APES, the SEC and FINRA have gotten together to review the activity of ongoing overleveraging in the stock market. Hedge funds could soon face total return swaps per Gary Gensler, SEC chairman.In a total return swap, the payer (hedge fund) must pay the interest on the underlying assets, plus any appreciation in the market value of the asset. This sounds like shorts paying all short borrowed fee owed on top of the market value of naked shares they traded.As for 13-F filings and short selling disclosures, there’s a strong possibility that hedge funds also face 13-F filings. This filing will provide the SEC with insight on equity and dark pool disclosure.Everything is falling into place, despite the continuous short laddering.HOLD, and rest assured that justice is ensued."
"What if their in their own game , Buying stocks to gain on their own short squeeze more than they would shorting."
"Short interest percentage :The first predictor to look at is the short interest percentage—the number of shorted shares divided by the number of shares outstanding. For instance, if there are 20,000 shares of Company A sold by short sellers and 200,000 shares of stock outstanding, the short interest percentage is 10%. The higher this percentage is, the more short sellers there will be competing against each other to buy the stock back if its price starts to rise. Short interest ratioThe short interest ratio is the short interest divided by the average daily trading volume (ADTV) of the stock in question. For instance, if you take 200,000 shares of short stock and divide it by an ADTV of 40,000 shares, it would take five days for the short sellers to buy back their shares.The higher the ratio, the higher the likelihood short sellers will help drive the price up. A short interest ratio of five or better is a good indicator that short sellers might panic, and this may be a good time to try to trade a potential short squeeze.Daily moving average chartsDaily moving average charts show where a stock has traded for a set time period. Looking at a 50-day (or longer) moving average chart will show whether there are peaks in a stock's price. To view moving average charts, check out one of the many charting software programs available. These will allow you to plot this on your chosen stock's chart.News headlines can also trigger a short squeeze, so stay informed about what is happening in your stock's field. The Bottom Line: Correctly timing a short squeeze can be a very lucrative strategy, but with this high reward potential comes high risk. Timing a peak is no easy feat. A trader looking to profit from a potential short squeeze should make a careful study of short squeeze predictors including short interest, the short interest ratio, daily moving averages, and industry trends."

Here's their scare tactic on CNBC......AMC deserves to drop 83%Their wickedness is spewing badly right now. They know they're in trouble. They know they just made a lot of people millionaires by their mistakes.
"At this point, the financial press is no longer pretending to be objective. Their purpose is a show of force. It's just part of the program to manipulate the market. They don't just drive down the price, it's a show of force that they can. That blank look in Kenny's eyes is there to project an entitled authority. Yet, Main St is standing it's ground and on the offensive. Buy orders out number sell orders 2:1. They can keep kicking the can down the road. But we're coming for them."
So could it be that shares are drying up? Paper hands and Day traders keep handing over their shares and Retail investors are buying and holding them. I am sure that by now we own more than 80% of the float. I guess we should keep buying up all the shares until 100 %.
"Don't get excited about small runs, and don't get demoralised by the dips. Don't build yourself up about SEC rules, 002's, whatever, these cnuts have ways round everything. They will have a whole project team dedicated to that one rule. Just relax. They need to buy the float back about 4 times over. Not sure when they will start, it may be months, maybe a year, but they will have to do it. Are you not happy to wait for such a huge payday? Until then these numbers a meaningless."
Listen bashers if AMC is over as you say it is. Then why are you still here? It ain't over until the retail investors say it's over! Got it bashers!!!
Ken going to be the new frank lucas snitching on all his friends to avoid jail time #amc 
We own the outstanding float
"I started buying this stock in Feb at $14.35. I continued to buy as dipped. I bought shares at $10, $9, $8, $6. My only regret is not loading up in the $6 dollar range. I managed to get my average price down to $9.88. I haven't sold 1 share yet and have no intention of selling until it squeezes. I can wait minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years if necessary."
We’re not buying for any other reason besides squeezing the shorts
I am options delta neutral player. I make money off the implied volatility of a stock. The IV of AMC near dated options is over 200%. That is a HUGE implied volatility. Options predict a +-$8 move in AMC this coming week.
I originally bought 22 shares at 10.18 now I'm at 49 shares I've averaged up to 30$ safe zone and will avg up as the time and climb progresses.
cost me nothing to hold... Cost shorts money every day in fees to hold..
"LOL, These MFer's can't sell shares they already sold we own 3x to 5x of the float DTCC 005 Just put the cage around these HF's The show is about to begin."
"Amc F9 this weekend , green after hours, beautiful wedge forming on the charts, shorts adding more short positions, short interest reported increasing to 18%, but we know it's a lot higher than that, good week ahead."
BUY & HOLD. IT IS TIME TO GO TO THE MOON!
Financial freedom is coming for those who conceive they will achieve. Stay the course. A modest chunk. Scared money doesn’t make money. 10/10 shorts squeeze rating. The short squeeze is inevitable this summer. We the people stand against blatant manipulation
One 8 percent gain at a time. Slow but steady wins the race.
"AMC is on the NYSE Threshold List for June 25 (google it yourself).This means the security must have five or more consecutive days of failed settlementtotaling at least 10,000 shares or 0.5% of shares outstanding.Lots of new naked shorting last week. Keep adding that fuel to the fire!"
They blew their wad and didn't even get it down a dollar.  I love it!
"It’s payday! After bills, enough left to buy 4 more shares at a sale price. Holding in BC Canada!"
"A simple explanation as to why we will go up soon enough. - short interest has gone up quickly and by quite a percentage. Why? 002 is making it so HFs have to short more out on the open market rather than the massive amounts shorted in dark pools. This indicates that SI would be much much higher as it does not take into account all of the previous shorting having taken place in dark pools. Mind you AMC has faired well despite attacks both inside and outside of the NYSE. - volume is low and why is this a good thing? With short interest rising the market makers are waiting but not for much longer. The market makers see rising interest as blood in the water. They will come in to push the price as high as they can to force margin calls. The volume at this point will spike quickly as a result of these trades.- what can hedgie do? They can continue shorting all they like on the open market and eventually will cover due to the buying pressure. This game has costs them too much and is pricier everyday. The shares on the open market to short are limited and their fuel tank, not ours, will run dry and then it’s time to put more fuel in our tank."
This needs to close above 43 to maintain a bullish trend!
We’re cooking now!!!
Have Hedgies covered…NO!Is short interest up…YES!Do we OWN the float…YES!It’s not a matter of IF but WHEN the SQUEEZE will happen…HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
Yup! The Short Squeeze WILL happen when you least expect it!
Volcano ready to erupt
We will see the real price very soon!!
"No worries about selling stock, no one can be a bag holder, there are 4 billion synthetic shares and only 500 million floated shares, hedge funds must close all positions, and we own 80% of the float we can not lose."
Doesnt matter what the chart shows. When they start covering then you will see the actual price. This is the same momentum we had from February to June. Back and forth from 8-10 then BOOM. Just relax and hold.
"When all of this first began I able to put my shares up for sale for $8000 to $10000, now they won't let put a sale price higher than $4000. For GME and $3000 for AMC, for this reason alone I have no sale price, for this reason I believe the first good short covering run will be around these prices, which I believe the squeeze will last longer than a week depending on the amount of shares being traded, if they can find shares to buy and there is very low volume it may take longer, this just my opinion, I have no price prediction, the price will be what the price will be."
"I'm with all you apes 250 shares and HODLING. But let's stop with the $70,80,90,100.... By the EOW - every week. We will get there but you have no idea when it'll be and may do harm by saying so as people's expectations are more immediate and will be let down as likely paper handed b1tch3Z. Live long and HODL I love you all but there's no rush "
"Citadel basher squadron worked all weekend and came up with this strategy. We will put out tons of fud, open more positions short on every play we are in and spend thousands of dollars to save nickels. Wow that’s ingenious isn’t it. Meanwhile Marge is now screaming. Closing time is coming. Interest payments are out of this world . The manipulation is becoming more blatant to the world as people aren’t Fooled as easy as before. The best is the Apes just keep buying and holding even more. How can you deal with that ? You can’t because we aren’t selling . Buy, Hold, HODL. It’s that simple and tell your girlfriend’s boyfriend put some bananas in the fridge. See it, believe it because it’s real."
"Just bought more - discount price Not selling a single share, supply and demand See u all above 80 and beyond"
"Shetidel and their algorithms detecting emotional buying and selling… guys don’t panic sell…, only buy and HODL! This is the way! Just know they short the stock hard when they sense fear…. If we played their game we’d all pretend to panic sell let them sell off tricking their algorithm and buy back as much as we can afford… what would they do then? Can someone say short squeeze? Not financial advise lol"
"Folks let’s finish strong today. We done a good job so far consolidating in the 50-60s. Low volume means that people are not selling. Soon we will break through 60s and go higher and higher, consolidation after consolidation. We own AMC, not the HFs. More we hold, faster the margin call for hedgies. Let’s goooo!!!!!! "
"100,000,000 shares borrowed.Selling shares that they don't have.Hedges are going down down down!!!"

Lol they try all thing to drop this price. Manipulation. Nobody is selling. We own 80% of AMC.Amc will squeeze. No doubt !

Were there margin calls today?
No longs are selling. Our shares are like gold. We r buying more and holding harder. Have not sold single share and bought more last week.Not for sale
Why the low volumes compared to previous days ? Where is everyone ?
I want you all to pay attention to what Yahoo is showing now at 4:01 as AMC's closing price. It is showing $56.72 as I type.
They literally halted buy orders on publicly traded stocks back in January. 300-million in volume yesterday and stock closed +10%. 240-million in volume today and it closes -2%. MANIPULATION
"Lots of FUD today and shorting, meaning we are going higher real soon. Hold on tight to your shares apes cause we are getting ready for take off."
"Update: Wednesday June 23, 2021: 1). The NSCC-2021-002 Rule should go into effect tomorrow, June 24th per the Federal Register. Per NSCC-002 Rule, margin calls are automatically when it deems HFs overleveraging their short position. The margin calls are intraday. I expect margin calls for these GREED HFs starting tomorrow. The MOASS is coming.....2). I mentioned that HFs have lost $24.6 Billion in the ""off"" exchange (Dark Pool) as of June 18th (on top of $5 Billion they have lost in the ""lit"" exchange (NYSE). As of today, HFs have lost $28.2 Billion in the ""off"" exchange....almost another $4B since June 18th. HFs continue to double/triple/quadruple down their short positions. New total HFs have lost so far is $34 Billion (previously $30 Billion on June 18th). In as little as 3 days, HFs have lost an additional $4 Billion......3). From my previous calculations with HFs $30 Billion lost (as of June 18th), my PT was at $6,500, as of June 18th. With $4 Billion additional lost, as of today June 23rd, my new PT increased to $7,600 (with $34 Billion HFs losses)..... 4). I do not believe HFs are done with shorting AMC stock. I believe their losses will continue to mount and the new PT will climb as their losses mount. Could we see HFs continue to be short AMC stock and lose another $34 Billion? and my new PT reaches $15,000? We shall see in the coming weeks/months.....5). They (HFs) might have already planned to buy massive shares at $2,000 and $4,200 and sell short when we hit that target. This might go on for a while. These are only my opinions. Do your own research before investing......6). Rule NSCC-002 should be in effect tomorrow. It will be a fun day for Apes starting tomorrow......"
I’m having a great time in my hot tub drinking coffee and muting bashers. I declare today Mute Monday. It feels good. Just do it a few times today while AMC starts the squeeze!
"just wanted to thank everyone holding strong. I have only 10 shares, but regardless of $$ I can say that I have been a part of this movement mainly because I agree with the other reason for this short squeeze. The market was supposed to be a free market where ANYONE could invest money into the companies that they supported. however after years of corrupt intentions this is no longer the case and its about time there was a strong, and smart, enough force to actually put up a fight. I'll hold for your million(s) and i believe whole heartedly , that you will hold mine. TO THE MOON!!!!! cheers"
Buy and hold! Retail investors are winning!
"Today Range was 38.76 - 49.79 so far. That's a huge range proving that no retail investors were really selling. It was just the hedge funds shorting AMC hoping to trigger a sell off. Well, that didnt happen and we recovered quickly. This might also suggest that Hedgies are desperate as their days to lose another $10 - $30 billion are numbered.APES we are holding DIAMOND HANDS. HODL and LONG!! see you at AMC = $100k a share."

Super low volume today. I guess the hedgies shorting back and forth at a loss is the only action this stock is seeing today! Just be patient…it costs nothing to hodl!
"002 and market liquidity. Everyone knows over the past year that money has been pumped into the system at record highs. Fed reserve, Congress, state govt have all pumped money (liquidity) into the system to fight effects of Covid on economy. That means that money has flowed like wine. Well, HF, like many others have become drunk and hooked on the liquidity. 002 is now instituted because they recognize that just as in ‘08, people like Kenny and HF have gone too far and are over leveraged with all the free or cheap money pumped into the market. 002 will reign that back in and force HF to properly balance their positions. It is a matter of when, not if, 002 starts the dominos. I promise you, Kenny will be just another infamous name like Madoff, Mullen, etc. this is a tale too often told. And YOU are part today the reason why light is being brought to this issue. Just HODL and relax. The moment will be upon us sooner than you think. Not advice, just reading obvious signs. Enjoy the last few days of freedom and paychecks shorty, your fall from Grace will be immediate and spectacular."

"I just sent this letter to the SEC it only takes a few seconds, email address is (chairmanoffice@sec.gov) everyone needs to do the same, you have to fight these people from all ends, don't be lazy!!! LETTER BELOW:Just copy and paste!Subject: Market Manipulation - AMC EntertainmentDear Mr GenslerI would like to draw your attention to market manipulation activity happening on an industrial scale on range of stocks including AMC listed on US Exchanges by market makers operating in the dark pool.Brokerages such as Fidelity which routes retail orders through NYSE reports day in day out the buy orders for AMC outnumbering sell orders by nearly 2 to 1, yet the price has been falling consistently now for the past month. It is falling because brokerages such as Robinhood,TD Ameritrade and Charles Shwab, attracted by payments for order flow, are routing retail orders through dark pool market makers such as Citadel and Virtu which routes sell orders to lit exchanges on receipt and park buy orders in their books; eventually releasing it to lit exchanges as and when it favours them.In fact, on option expiry days, you can almost exactly predict to the dime where the price of stocks manipulated in this manner will finish at end of day trading.My question to you Sir is: Why is the SEC allowing Citadel and other clearinghouse money makers/broker-dealers to route over 50% of all the AMC retail buy orders to dark pools and sell orders to the market, thus effectively truncating AMC market price?United States prides itself as a free fair and competitive market driven economy. However, the above practice appears anything but. It is pure manipulation by and to the benefit of a single entity Citadel, and to the detriment of tens of millions of retail investors. This needs to be investigated and the practice ended as a matter of URGENCY,Sincerely"
"The AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc stock price gained 6.37% on the last trading day (Thursday, 8th Jul 2021), rising from $45.07 to $47.94. During the day the stock fluctuated 28.46% from a day low at $38.76 to a day high of $49.79. The price has fallen in 7 of the last 10 days and is down by -17.77% for this period. Volume has increased on the last day along with the price, which is a positive technical sign, and, in total, 49 million more shares were traded than the day before. In total, 143 million shares were bought and sold for approximately $6.86 billion.The stock lies in the lower part of a very wide and strong rising trend in the short term, and this may normally pose a very good buying opportunity. If the lower trend floor at $44.99 is broken, it will firstly indicate a slower rate of rising, but may also be an early warning for a trend shift. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise 260.32% during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between $162.11 and $318.03 at the end of this 3-month period."

We might be waking up to the 60s tomorrow. It is common for margin calls to be covered during closed hours to prevent FOMO buyers from jumping in causing a sharper rise before market open.

There are huge money to be made if you are cool enough to hold, maybe buy and most important Not sell."

"#AMC Call me crazy, but here's my hypothesis. Over the last 2 days we've seen a sizeable drop in volume. Today at 1:20 PM we just eclipsed 60m for the day. My reasoning is our buys are being routed to dark pools while the sells are done on the open market. This is a ""hold"" play by big money. Less new buyers at this range if there's no movement on the stock, or any news. 002 passed which was huge news and the volume gets cut in half? The HF know holding the price stable is how to stay solvent for as long as possible. The Apes resolve was underestimated. They can't bring it down, they're holding it from going up, for now. Think like a HF. Stop new buyers, and hold out hope people will get bored and sell. If the average is 120 shares per ape, and let's say most bought at $20, that would equate to $2400 total. At $56, $2400 gets you 42 shares if you bought now, new or old. See what I'm getting at? See the perception they're trying to build? The age-old attitude of stocks was always ""buy low, sell high"". Try this instead, ""buy high, sell higher"". This is not advice or guidance, so please do what's best for you. I'm no advisor, this is purely my opinion. Good luck."
time is coming to a close look at the positive we are not in the 40S we will pravale hold hold hold. they try smoking mirrors to break the strong unity that we AMC holders have. good going APE Nation!

"We have not seen borrowed share utilization this high in weeksUTILIZATIONCurrent94.977 days ago77.74% Change22.16Shorts once again are hanging on by a string. First they flash crashed crypto on Friday, what is ironic is right after crypto flash crashed, shorts borrowed over 2 million shares of AMC, coincidence? I think not.Then shortly after 1:30 pm they crashed the entire market. Yet they could only bring AMC down a bit over 2%.Stocks like Alphabet (google) fell by as much as $25 bucks, Amazon was down, Apple was down, FB was down it was insane. Why because 818 billion dollars in options were expiring at 4pm.This is the largest dollar total in stock market history. We will find out Monday I am sure via news articles just how costly week ending 6/18 was for shorts, not only in AMC, which I am sure they lost over 2 billion last week, but from an overall market perspective. It seems all companies that had big options calls closing were crashed.We are in the drivers seat handily, and if 002 passes on Monday June 21, the hedgies will no longer be able to manipulate the markets on a daily basis as has been the case forever. Intra day liquidity checks are going to be the death of over leveraged hedge funds. With only 1 hour to regain compliance for those who find themselves over leveraged, they will find themselves liquidated if they fail to regain compliance and margin calls will happen rapidly perhaps during market hours even. Usually these occurrences happen in premarket and after hours but 002 could really change that instantly."
Just one way…. HODL!
buy a little more.

Shorts are playing with fire right now.Just a matter of time before they realize how trapped they are. They are losing money everyday and its obvious they cant ladder during the day as they used to.Clock is ticking and time is running out. Just make sure you do not have stop losses set, you will lose your shares when they come fishing."
Just day-dreaming here. It would be real neat for Cathy Wood of Ark Investments to buy in to AMC. That would wipe tge smile off Jim Cramer's face so it would or is it Wood? Charlie

"Hey Diamond Hand Apes......According to Fintel.io info below, there should be $2.12 Billion in Amount (or 32,260,074 in shares) of Failure-to-Deliver (FTD) that the SHFs to buy back in the next 2 trading weeks, From Aug 9 - Aug 20 (10 trading days)............The next 2 weeks are the consecutive trading days of the highest FTD (in 10 consecutive trading days). The right column on the right is the Price multiply Puantity (# of share) = $Amount. (See link). The FTDs are the highest for consecutive days, as mentioned (Item #2) in my previous post......Look at the (FTD) starting next week, Aug 9 for the next 10 trading days. I expect the SHFs will be very active trading in the dark pool for the next 2 weeks to try to keep the SP down to prevent the MOASS. This will result in more synthetic shares......Each day they create more synthetic shares, the AMC SP will go higher & more they have to pay. Read the number of synthetic shares I estimated by the end of July (based on the MAY 2021 FINRA Report for 1.5 billion shares traded in the darkpool (300%) & May & June FINTEL.IO report for the FTDs......Failure to DeliverDate T+35$Amount 2021-06-21 8/09/2021$240,187,4762021-06-22 8/10/2021$202,296,4862021-06-23 8/11/2021$216,284,0222021-06-24 8/12/2021$226,409,8572021-06-25 8/13/2021$250,580,9432021-06-28 8/16/2021$217,503,4362021-06-29 8/17/2021$206,944.9922021-06-30 8/18/2021$237,412,8602021-07-01 8/19/2021$199,476.9842021-07-02 8/20/2021$121,914,374Total: $2,119,011,430https://fintel.io/ss/us/amc.........Also, on Aug 6, more institutions bought AMC shares; The Swiss National Bank bought $47M worth of AMC shares or 832,741 shares for $33.44 per share. Now put $47M in perspective when you compare with the FTD, above for the next 10 business days......... $240M (on 8/9); $202M (on 8/10); $216M (on 8/11); $226M (on 8/12); $250M (on 8/13); $217M (on 8/16); $206M (on 8/17); $237M (on 8/18); $199M (on 8/19); $121M (on 8/20). These are the amounts that SHFs have to buy back in the open market. However, they will try to buy in the dark pool to sell in the open market to try to keep the SP down, to prevent the MOASS for the next 2 weeks. If the SEC banned dark pool trading with the intention of SP manipulation in the lit exchange, the MOASS would probably have already happened. The MOASS is inevitable. The SHF can only delay it (continuing to manipulate by buying in the dark pool and selling in the lit market to keep the SP down) to trigger stop losses and get rid of the paper hands. But, this MOASS will happen sooner or later. The SEC has already forced the Large Banks to liquidate, due to the lending clients (SHF) over-leverage short positions.

"From IBD...""When a stock shows a high level of short interest and is getting bid up, you can almost count on a chain reaction of buying to occur. Why? Short sellers, betting on a decline in the stock, often have to do an about-face. They cover their short position by buying back shares.According to data analyzed by MarketSmith, short interest — shares sold short by individual and professional investors — stands at 0.9 times AMC stock's daily average volume of 99 million shares, or roughly 89 million shares. Short interest, in other words, has climbed back to nearly 17% of the stock's entire float. That's down from 21% in the spring.""We are going higher... These shorts have not and will not learn their lesson LOL..."
shorts will have to cover! there is no other way!AMC LONG AND STRONG
"Was away for a week - see we are holding in very very nicely… for the last week didnt really check in on AMC but was not worried - I am holding long till this thing hits $1,000 per share… just a matter of time… Very bad press for Citadell that is negatively affecting other institutions too- rumour is that they are gonna put the screws to Citadell, and perhaps replace some of the MM’s who manage the after and pre-trade… the small volume is where you see obvious manipulation to set the stage for the days trades… you can’t have a stock trade up 10% on massive volume then in AH retract a full 15% on no volume. All the AH does is set the price for dark pool - that’s why the very next day it takes retail buying of about 10 mil shares to push the price back up - manipulation up the wazoo"

"It's ironic that the social network tactics being used against retail investors are now being used effectively to bankrupt the hedge funds. They invented these Gustapo strategies long before the modern social network to shape the narrative in their favor. They spread the word however they could to the public and to their collusion partners. They totally controlled the media aspect and the psychological warfare. They used these tactics successfully to bankrupt many companies or kill their share price momentum. Of course here we are today and I think we now have the upper hand because we can share information and due diligence all over the world in a matter of seconds. The internet has allowed us a chance to access worlds of knowledge instantly that in recent history, you either went to library to get or were lucky enough to know somebody who could share their knowledge. One cannot hide behind misinformation and lies that easy anymore. Conspiracies are much harder to pull off and the playing field has been somewhat leveled. We still are not privy to as much information as the hedge funds but eventually, with our diligence and persistence, the playing field will be leveled even more.Just a few short months ago, nobody new anything about the dark pools, naked shares, synthetics and much much more. It is killing the hedge funds because as time goes on, all their secrets are being uncovered by smart apes as well as the entire world who must now think the United States stock market is not what they thought fair trading should be. The hedges have caused far more damage then we think. It's not our fault and even if it is, who cares. We own the shares and we want to get paid."

Full time job since 19 years old, bought a pre construction house about 7 years ago that has now appreciated a couple hundred grand, made $40,000.00 profit on Aphria, and have bought in close to 1000 shares around the $12 per share average here. Still going to hold until the squeeze. I know a good opportunity when I see one. In the world of crooked manipulation only made to help the rich. You need to make smart decisions. This is seriously the play right now. Lots of money will be made for those who stick around and we’re not talking $100 a share. Even if you get cold feet and sell early I’d imagine that would around the $140 per share mark. But being completely conservative.. $400-$1000 is going to come really quickly"

"On January 27th 2021, AMC stock, one hour into trading, the days volume was already over 500 million shares which was significantly above the stock's 30-day average volume of 86.8 million shares a day. By 4pmET on that day more than 1.1 billion shares had been traded and we have since that day barely reached half that volume ever again. Now add to that, the outstanding share float on January 27th was only 250 million authorized shares. The next day, robinhood and a couple other brokers stopped everyone from buying AMC shares. GME as well. Now ask yourself how could this happen? It couldn't be that people bought the 250 million shares and sold them and bought them and sold them and bought them and sold them and bought them 5 times in the same day? The Stock was hot and on an incredible upswing trading around twenty dollars from a previous day high of 5 dollars. Who would have been selling at that particular time? Like nobody.Could it be that because of what GME was doing at the time (they closed around 350 dollars on that day) people, like me saw a chance for AMC to do something similar and at the price of 5 dollars was worth buying a ton of shares and did just that? I think so. I think there were at least 750 million shares or more sold on that day and this is why hedges could not close their positions even when it came down shortly thereafter to 5 dollars per share. I seriously think that AMC shares were sold out 6 months ago and there are probably 1.5 billion shares out there somewhere. Never made sense to me until finding out about dark pool and their ability to park buy orders. If this is all yrue and there are that money shares out there, we are rich and the hedges should have already been liquidated as they could not possibly cover that amount. Now, since the SEC is giving them such a long leash, they are probably whittling down and trying to cover those shares. Good luck with that. Does anyone know where to see the level 2 buy/sell ratio for AMC on January 27th 2021?"

"Latest news on AMC, we are going higher and higher...my target was over $65 and touch $75.......this week.REUTERS'Meme' stock prices may not properly reflect demand -NYSE president06/16/2021 6:01:43 PMBy John McCrankNEW YORK (Reuters) - The prices of so-called meme stocks may be distorted because the majority of trades in those names are executed away from public exchanges where share price formation occurs, the head of the New York Stock Exchange said on Wednesday.""Meme stocks,"" which often start as low-priced, highly shorted stocks that users of online forums such as Reddit's WallStreetBets rally behind, are some of the most heavily traded and volatile shares on any given day.Shares of companies like video game retailer GameStop Corp and theater chain operator AMC Entertainment have whipsawed this year, with GameStop having rallied more than 1,600% in January alone, prompting trading halts by some brokers and sparking Congressional and regulatory hearings.""In some of the meme stocks that we've seen, or stocks that have a high level of retail participation, the vast majority of order flow can trade off of exchanges, which is problematic,"" said Stacey Cunningham, president of Intercontinental Exchange Inc's NYSE.""That price formation is not really reflective of what supply and demand is,"" she said at a conference hosted by CNBC.Retail trading surged during the coronavirus pandemic, helped by a shift by retail brokerages to commission-free trading, with individual traders now responsible for around 35% of market volume, up from 20% pre-pandemic.In meme stocks, individual traders contribute as much as 70% of the volume, Cunningham said.The majority of retail orders bypass exchanges because of an arrangement called payment for order flow, in which retail brokerages sell their customers' marketable orders to wholesale brokers. The wholesalers match the orders internally, trying to profit off of the bid-ask spread, while offering retail traders the best market price or better.Retail brokers say payment for order flow lowers overall costs for individual traders.But the practice raises conflict of interest questions and will be included in a broad review of stock market rules, Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said last week.The review will also examine whether off-exchange trading - which is about 50% of the market when institutional block trades are included - distorts the price discovery mechanism for stocks, Gensler said.

"An update to yesterday's short interest scenario on AMC.As mentioned yesterday when the NYSE updated its short interest on May 28th there were 100.2 million shares in short interest resulting in 20.1% of the float being shorted.We discussed the fact that the following week we all know what happened to AMC price and the gamma squeeze that occurred on June 2nd.Now Ortex is once again reporting the following and this is as of Wednesday due to the T+2 rule. As of close of business Wednesday Ortex is reporting 97.13 million shares on loan. Ortex is also reporting 18.99% of the free float, of which retail owns approximately 80% is now on loan being shorted. I can tell you that yesterday of which is not crunched by Ortex yet due to the 2 day settlement system Ortex reported and additional 2.09% increase in short interest.Utilization of these borrowed shares which had been sitting in the high 80% range is now closing in on 92% as of Wednesday.Why is all of this important? Well based on numbers as of Wednesday versus May 28th total that would leave only about 5 million shares or less available to be borrowed by shorts before reaching 100% of free float accounted for.At 92% utilization as of again Wednesday, that would leave about 7 million shares available to be shorted based on the 93.17 million on loan, these shares may very well have been used Wednesday and Thursday.Bottom line is this, short interest is increasing rapidly, shorts are running at levels that leave them in a very precarious position. The price of AMC remains very stable and within our channel of $53.75 to $62.00. The options chain remains very bullish at nearly 3 to 1 ratioThe last 2 times that short interest reached over 20% AMC broke out from $10 to $14 and from 29$ to $72.Now I am not saying history is going to repeat itself, but it often can repeat itself.This post is not to give predictions or timeframes on anything, it is meant to give you all an update of exactly where we stand and where shorts ability to maneuver is at at the current time.Bottom line is shares to borrow are limited and short interest is rising to a dangerous point once again for short sellers."
"if you settle on selling for anything under 100,000 it would be criminal you are letting the hedges get off easy. hodl long and strong buy the dips"
Where are all the shorts ?
Did anyone read the yahoo review at the bottom of this page on AMC they really bashed us retail investers and claim it will never squeeze. paid bashers..Im buying more today for sure.
I want to know why I can't see current comments? Everything that's posted is from 2 months agao.

That 40 would put my over 10k shares pleaseeee at this point I’m begging 
AMC is a buy buy buy
"Ultimately, the stock price will be driven by financials. If AMC can get back to the level of net income they had pre-pandemic -- that is back to losing only $100 million per year and they can continue to dilute the stock to remain out of bankruptcy -- then AMC will approach the pre-pandemic valuations (around $5 per share). Enjoy!"
this is not financial advice.. this is just a strategy.APE strategy is just to simply Buy & Hold. That is what destroys hedge fund AI bots predicting sentiment. Thats all that I will be doing. The stock can drop 20% tomorrow... Il be holding. we bounced back 40% in one afternoon and up 400% in 1.5 months. remember short squeezes are real. hedge funds have not bought back their borrowed shares.

Mentally immune to price actions these days. Can hold for as long as it takes before squeeze
58.3% short percentage yesterday. 54.4% day before. Yet AMC is holding up incredibly well in the upper $50's. Someone is desperate.
"Welcome to Tuesday morning the 22nd of June. Please do not let what happened yesterday put a dent in our resolve at AMC. Yesterday our price per share dropped, shorts lost hundreds of millions of dollars(Again) and thru it all they even managed to increase their short position here in AMC. As I have been saying for a while now, in this price range the price of the stock does not matter. Apes holding their shares and adding to our positions when we can is what is the single most important thing we need to do. This week will get interesting on Thursday and Friday when Russell gets their realignment done and the funds start to purchase the stocks they have to. Many are expecting AMC to have a lot of volume and good price action late this week. Shorts and hedges are still playing their games, cross trading to lower the price, trying to convince Apes to sell here and move to other ""short plays"" Which they have set up and will take your money if you try to buy in there now. WISH is on their wish list not ours. AMC and GME are the real deals and everyone on both sides of this stock are fully aware of that fact. Do not let daily pricing effect your thoughts on AMC, today could be another red day but I am not leaning that way. I think we will see a lot of volatility today but a small green finish is there for us if we stay to the strategy of buy and hold. We cannot go wrong if we simply buy and hold. The other side still cannot figure out why they have not convinced us to sell. They threw the playbook at us, now they are fabricating short squeeze plays in other companies and still trying to convince us to sell AMC. If they thought AMC was done, why would they spend so much time and money on trying to get us to sell it still? Apes know the game and we are not playing their game any longer. We are in control of this game and we will get to the final goal if we just stay on the plan we have had since this began. Buy and Hold. It is the way at AMC. Enjoy the day all, I will post again if anything starts to play out. I see a London based fund, White Square capital has shut it doors after losing big on the GME squeeze. they lost almost 80% of their holdings this year and elected to sell and return what money they could to their investors. That is 1 shoe to drop. There will be others in the near future. When they start to call and liquidate these places we will see the price the want."
"My cut for what its worth: got in a position in the mid $30's and got out this morning at $45ish. What I saw yesterday was a lot of the shorts getting out. Think about it: if they shorted in the mid to high $30's with a 15% - 20% stop loss, it got triggered when the stock ran up early yesterday. I may be wrong but the potential to drop $8 (back to the high $30's) is greater that going up another $8. Anyway good luck to those of you getting in now. Bearish (over the next several weeks)."
"You didn't sell at $61 two days ago, why would you sell at $57?!?"
We own the float not institutions!Keep buying..Once 200% of the float is owned by retail investors this will run to $1000
I added 600 shares today . It will go up sure..
"still not selling, this will be epic return of wealth back to the average investor who has patience, imo"
Amc will bounce up hard tomorrow! It will bounce into space tomorrow. Mark this post shorts!
"Cryptocurrencies are much easier to own than stock. Even though most investors and traders do purchase a derivative of stock, the stock itself is not with the user. This means to properly own stock, you cannot just purchase the asset on an exchange on Telegram platform. >>RitaspenserFX Has the best strategies of trading in stock most especially on Crypto currency"
"Hold steady and be patient...Why do people keep talking about fundamentals....Many people clearly don't understand what's happening with the stock or the movement behind it. There are around 500m shares80% of those are owned by retail traders.15% are held by institutions.Then we have almost 20% short interest.So there are more short positions open than the are available shares, and some other factors like synthetic shares.HF are losing hundreds of millions a week and the shorts haven't covered!"
to all you manipulaters on this board. even though I know this will get deleted. just want to let you know that the rest of us already know that something really big is coming just buy what is being done now. going to start going up in very big increments very soon

The reason why it stagnant it's because he hold ! They have less power and the longer we hold the longer they pay interest and they gonna have to cover eventually The chart shows we are winning ! Proud of the community
Shorts STILL haven’t covered…Apes OWN the float…it’s REAL SIMPLE…BUY…HOLD….WIN!
is this the start of the squeeze 
Would like to know who's actually keeping an eye on all this mess! Wow...when this explodes! It's going to big massive....dollars in my pocket! Holding strong from Canada!

"Still holding and bought more gme and amc today. If you wanna see the squeeze get going, don’t invest in crypto and/or cash out. Stop a income they are using to lower the price. Not fin advice too. Just something I’ve been watching for a month or so."
guess what I'm not selling haha!
"This is too obvious , stock keeping $55 level for weeks now the same way it kept $11 level before the blowup ROCKET  started .SHORTS CAN YOU SPELL $1 0 0 "

Shave off 28 dollars a share for no reason in two weeeks in the face of heavy buying pressure. Seems legit.
Gonna be sweet when shorty’s FAKE shares are converted to REAL cash for Ape Nation!HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!

"Tue, June 15, 2021, 7:05 AMAMC+8.98%(Corrects to $512 million from $488 million in the headline)(Reuters) -Investors shorting ""meme stock"" AMC Entertainment Holdings are estimated to have lost about $512 million on Monday after a rally that sent the cinema operator's shares up more than 15%, data from financial analytics firm Ortex showed.By contrast, AMC short-sellers suffered $1.2 billion in mark-to-market losses for the week to May 28, when small-time traders on online discussion groups sent the stock up about 116% by triggering a phenomenon known as a ""short squeeze"".AMC shares were up 2% at $58.12 in premarket trading on Tuesday. The stock has surged more than 2,580% so far this year, riding a wave of support from individual traders who have come together on online forums such as Reddit's Wall Street Bets.Recent reports from brokerages Fidelity and Freetrade show AMC has been the most traded stock by their customers, many of whom are small-time investors.Market sources told Reuters last week that the volatility in AMC shares had led some professional traders to use options to limit their risk as they make bearish bets on the stock.AMC has raised funds in recent weeks by issuing fresh equity to hedge fund Mudrick Capital and selling stock ""at-the-market"", as it capitalizes on the blistering rally in its stock. It plans to use the proceeds to repay debt and for potential acquisitions of theaters.(Reporting by Sagarika Jaisinghani, Aaron Saldanha in Bengaluru and Sujata Rao in London; Editing by Anil D'Silva)"

Fasten your seatbelts.Total Return Swap AMCThe SEC and FINRA have gotten together to review the activity of ongoing overleveraging in the stock market. Hedge funds could soon face total return swaps per Gary Gensler, SEC chairman.In a total return swap, the payer (hedge fund) must pay the interest on the underlying assets, plus any appreciation in the market value of the asset. This sounds a lot like shorts paying all short borrow fee owed on top of the market value of naked shares they’ve traded.13-F filings and short selling disclosuresThere’s a strong possibility that hedge funds also face 13-F filings. This filing will provide the SEC with insight on equity and dark pool disclosure.Everything now seems to be falling right into place despite the continuous short laddering.Margin calls will result in a short squeezeAt first we might experience what’s known as consecutive gamma squeezes. These are usually triggered by high volume in the market due to expiring call options in the money or very high purchasing days.As more short sellers and hedge funds with larger short positions in AMC stock begin to cover, we will begin to experience the beginning of a short squeeze.A short squeeze could last several days to several weeks. During this timeframe, the stocks price will continue to skyrocket as more short positions are closed.It really does feel like we’re coming to an end here. This new beginning is going to change millions of people’s lives and I’m glad to be that first person to congratulate you.Source https://franknez.com/how-soon-will-hedge-funds-get-margin-called-amc/"
I am very happy with the HF and the shorters holding out. I am a working man. d I collect my pay checks it continues to give me the opportunity to increase my share counts. I will keep buying on every opportunity that I have. Making best use of my investment in AMC as time drags along. Thanks you HF and Short sellers. You are making my dream come true.
As long as someone is telling me to sell I'm going to hold. Simple as that.
"New Apes and apes , one of the most important things you can do is switch to a broker who does not use payment for order flow. Some of the current ones are Fidelity and Public. Check with your broker. Also turn off share lending. Shidatel is getting your trades otherwise and using the dark pools to route our purchases. This is why when we see the order flow showing greater inflow than outflow and still the price drops. The trades through the dark pools have been over 65 % the last few days."
"If you hold it, he will squeeze."
No one is falling for shorties tricks We will buy more and keep buying and holdingNot for sale

"In my trading career I have held on to every stock that I bought, some as as long as 2 to 3 years even if it meant loosing 50% of my portfolio. At some point I decided enough is enough and started swing trading for one stock another but in the long run I ended up where I started. now I heard about amc when it was $10 and decided to do some digging on it. from one utbe video to another and my own research I was became more convinced that the ape movement was up to something good. unfortunately I did not join the party till the 30s but very glad I did. i have made up all my loses in less than a month and I continue to hold because I know what I hold. for all the new folks that want to join in and are hesitant, my advice is get in now because amc can double anytime from here and you what? I will still be holding because I truly believe this will hit a 1000 soon. May The APEs live forever"
"If you want to know how strong AMC is right now you should just go have a look at the interactive 5 day chart on Yahoo and be sure you use 5 min intervals. What you will see is what amounts to a kiss of death to the shorts. During the post-lunch take-down, hey were able to force the current price, 10 day and 50 day average price below the 200 day average by some measure over the last half hour but my goodness, just look at it now..! All three indices moving back up and over the 200 day as I type.Now have a look at the AMC one month chart and you will see the current price as I post is breaking back over the 10 day moving average which sends and evenstronger signal. I truly believe we are going to see some real fire-works this afternoon and I mean that. This is such a strong signal AMC is sending out here and now. It's phenomenal really and I've never witnessed anything like it. It feels so good to be a part of making history doesn't it?"
Let’s say people are making 5k a month 60k a year salary thats for a graduate if you invest in amc a couple shares and have to wait it out a year for this to squeeze you will make way more so just chill and relax I don’t know how people panic when you should be ready when this reaches those high 4-5 digits buy and hold this is a gurentee patience
This can touch 60 tomorrow.

"Wow, another great day. The lowest volume I’ve seen in probably the last 30 days and the price only dropped $1.39.

Saw F9 in Friday at an AMC with the fam. It was a blast going to the movies again. Im sure ill be going 1 once a month from now on. No matter how free watching a movie at home is. You cant replace that special feeling. Im sure alot of others did that too. F9 was the best turnout during the pandemic so far. It is rebounding ! Have fun! YoLO ApES!

". AMC Entertainment is still heavily shorted. You will have to decide whether its current share price is worth it if trades at $100, $500, or even $1,000 plus . These prices all depends on Diamond  Hands .AMC Entertainment stock has not even started squeezing yet.Eventually the margin calls will come , just hold and buy the dips "

"Shorting a stock equals infinite loss potential.Buying a stock equals losing the money you invested.

Five people in my immediate family have invested in AMC because we like the stock and we like the movie theatre. I am going to hodl till the squeeze however long it takes."
Just HODL no problem

"Either way we win, it pops soon we win, it gets delayed a bit more, we buy more and make more $$$. Win Win!"
"Its really important we all get some perspective here: The HF’s are giving it all they’ve got. What's the impact? A slight drop? A bit of barcoding? If they could drop this to peanut prices, they would - BUT THEY CANT. That’s because we continue to hold, and that’s enough! Don’t get bored and lose sight of the rewards on offer. Go out and do something else to occupy your mind. This could rumble on for a while. But if we all stick together, pick up a few more shares as and when we can, we will emerge rich winners.It’s really that simple. Just HODL and don’t believe the repetitive b.s.

Tomorrow is the reconstitution of the Russell 1000 and 2000. annually one of if not the highest volume trading day of the year. A lot of folks saying AMC is going to have a very good day. Don't want to put the cart before the horse but lets see how we start the morning and go from there. At a price ranging in the $50s. Apes are not interested in selling. If today was the shorts and hedges trading to drop the price they spent a lot of money to drop the price a mere 2.75%. I would lean more toward the investment funds lining out for the day tomorrow. Have a good evening everyone. Tomorrow we see how the reconstitution plays out.

Buy and hold this diamond under pressure. The whole world is buying standing up against blatant manipulation. Knowing financial freedom is near. Shorts will inevitably poop themselves. The short squeeze rating is 10/10
Long weekend coming with a major blockbuster being released. $$$$$ AMC to the moon!
"NOTE TO ALL APES: those, like myself, who are new to this post, need only to scroll down when you click on most recent posts, or top reactions to find those responses which are timely and note worthy. Do not even bother responding to the myriad of no names bashing the stock. Merely mute them. Do not engage, as once you do, they probably get paid. This stock's real worth is unknown, due to the criminal elements manipulating the price. Wait them out! Buy and hold! Every share you buy is one less share the H'Funds can short you with. Should the stock dip, as it undoubtedly will, at times, due to not only votility as with manipulation, buy one or two more, further putting the squeeze on those who would have the company go bankrupt; no longer doable, due to retail investors, such as you and I, wanting to put an end to their corruption. COME TOGETHER! APES FOREVER! STRONG ARE WE! If long time holders have anything to add, please step in."
Here’s how this is going down:Rumors about Amazon buying out AMC will push the price up causing a gamma squeeze. Shorts will start to cover pushing up the price further then panic will set in among the big crooked Hedge Funds causing them to beat each to the punch to cover. Then MOASS hits like a rocket going to the moon. The Ape community lives happily ever after eating bananas and FREE popcorn at the AMC theatres!!! THE END

MOASS is getting ready !!

"Not leaving, not selling single shareHave been buying all day yesterday and will continue to buy more. When it rockets  past Saturn don’t say I should of bought more like when it was 6.Also clear price manipulation to keep price low for getting out of call options. Percentage of borrowed shares for shorting increased from 0.9 to over 5. Amc stock has been shorted 50 and greater each day’s volume for last week."
"22% short volume ratio, you know shorts haven’t covered a share when, and we’re already in the 50’s, imagine when the covering begins and shorts aren’t able to find shares to buy, sky is the limit. Patience, we need another gamma squeeze to try to get this to short squeeze via margin calls."
"If hedge funds were so great at manipulating the stock lower, why did AMC go to $72? If hedge funds manipulated the stock down to single digits, isn't it fair to say that the Reddit pump and dump manipulated the stock to $72? And if the market is ""broken"" and none of the price bids are real, why would you expect the MOASS to happen when it's clear the ""evil"" market makers and hedge funds don't want it to happen? Nothing about the Apes make any sense. They don't care about fundamentals but they chirp about 2Q results. They don't trust the market, but they bet their life savings on a single stock. They expect a short squeeze, but there are other stocks in the market with a better setup for a squeeze. They don't trust independent research on the company published on Seeking Alpha, but they'll listen to an unemployed twenty something that lives in his mother's basement because he's on YouTube."

"Well it seems like shills are taking a different approach on Yahoo board here. They are all casting doubt pretending to be longs. I see them responding to my posts. They stand out like a sore thumb.Folks, let me make this simple, there is no doubt we are going higher. patience is the key. shorts borrowed 12 million shares yesterday and could do nothing to this stock.Shorts are now much more limited in what they can do as far as manipulation due to 002. Ladder attacks, naked shorting, over leveraging are all things of the past.Any short that attempts such nonsense will be over liquidated and have a huge issue with the potential for an automated sell off due to intra day liquidity checks.I have Ortex running all day long, short interest is rising, do not let anyone tell you different, shares are being borrowed by the millions daily. Shorts borrowed 12 million yesterday, accomplished nothing and returned 11 million of those.We had an up day in the upper levels of our price channel even though volume was extremely low for AMC.Yahoo board blocked us out yesterday, Apollo Investments owns Yahoo. They shorted AMC before, and are probably short again. Trying to control the narrative by buying Yahoo and controlling our ability to discuss AMC is a bold move but will not work.We are strong, we know what we own, and we know that everyday shorts are becoming weaker and the rules are leveling the playing field. Do not allow anyone on this board to tell you anything different. Nothing has changed."
It's weird that Yahoo only shows $AMC posts that are 4 weeks old...
Do ya'll think we finish above 40 today?
Hah I got to buy 10 more shares today Thanks for the discount
Still not leaving.
"A short message to share in addition to all positive information from others in this board. 1. looking into the $AMC daily chart, a very clear volume-price divergence trend is shown in last three weeks. 2. this data shows a potentially very strong uptrend run in following days/weeks.3. apparently short squeeze seems delayed by some force, this has been tried hard to try to shake off the paper hands, to buy more time as much as possible, to reduce the power of squeeze, etc.4. major margin calls seem not starting yet, it can start at anytime.5. newly approved NSCC-002 seems not really being executed in practice yet, when it is effectively in action, changes will immediately show up.6. price strongly standing around this level (mainly around $50~$60) for three weeks looks very much like a consolidation before a big blowing up.7. it seems a lot of ""buy the dip"" and FOMO catching up in last a couple of weeks. 8. data shows still a lot of short attacks in last few days, hence price moves shows there has been no major sells from longs.Expectation will be that when the critical line is crossed, explosion follows,  time coming. GLTL!"
I'm curious if anyone can explain this for me. let's say all the rumors are accurate and the short position is significantly higher than reported with synthetics etc. let's go on the basis of 2 to 1. if 80% is owned by retail and some institutions let's say 400mil and theres 1 billion shorted shares. how could hf possibly close out their positions?
Buy and hold they're screwed and will have to cover billions of synthetics phantom shares IOUs Christmas sale.
From 800k shares available to borrow to 20k in 30 minutes. I can afford to buy at least 1 share
Who’s holding?
They’re censoring me bright and early that means we’re about to explode buy and hold
 Prepare for lift off 
NYSE threshold today along with 002 and it’s liftoff. Roughly 6.5 million shares at threshold require mandatory maintenance. How can you short when you’ll be too busy buying and market makers add on extra pressure blasting the stock off through the low 60’s
"In this time of immediate gratification and impatience, it is truly inspiring to see the commitment of my fellow Apes. Some of you are sitting on 100-200 % or more gain and you are still holding strong. This would not work if not everybody's faith and commitment. Long and strong!!!"
MOTLEY going extra hard on the FUD this morning.. some serious movement must be imminent!
SEC pressure is here!!!! Be patient they still have some days left to cover but these next ten days should be wild. Keep up the positive vibes as this is a buying opportunity for new investors and old alike.
"AMC thanks the diamond hand crew for allowing them to stave off bankruptcy. AM is the same ole company with the same ole problems, except it now has a better balance sheet which is admittedly a big deal. Regardless, AMC will see single digits within the next year and still have a market cap 3-4x higher than pre-pandemic levels, which makes zero sense. Diamond hand that reality!"
shorts suppressing trading and providing more consolidation higher in the channel. buy and hodl. simple for us.
"still holding. as long as we're above 40 and 50 hedge funds are paying huge interest and have margin call risk. And if they cover then we rocket into the 100s... there's no way out for shorts, just buy and hold."
how many shares does it take to manipulate this stock price...day after day....while failing to deliver shares and having millions of synthetics in the hands of retail. when will the stock price reflect the true supply and demand.
SEC - is there a requirement to report trades ( buys) hdpoening in dark pools? If only one side of the trace is reported or transparent is r that price fixing? That is a violation of the Sherman anti trust act
This will create the most millionaires and billionaires
It’s gonna be another good day! Message board is jacked again
Yolo'd AMC. Love me a cute little drop. Holding strong. Diamond hands baby!
Hedge funds are gonna bring price up And call that the big squeeze. to convince paper hands to sell don't sell wait for a 100k 500k 1000k.. Be prepared we will win.
"Yesterday's market freefall may have forced some margin calls. Emphasis on ""some"". This may be epic once shorts are forced to cover!"
I bought more today and will buy more Monday. I’ll continue to add more shares till short covering starts. Hodl and strong. The only way

"As long as everybody HOLDS, there is no way this stock will go back to $10 anytime soon. Don't buy the fear these paid bashers are selling. We are strong and bigger than the hedgies, who by law, HAVE to cover their positions and pay out the options that expired in the money. The end of July is looking VERY good. I've been here since January, I can wait for another 3-weeks to see this pop above $80"
"Just in from the Lone Star State of TEXAS"" Reporting live from TEXAS!! The "" South APES shall Rise again!"""
"If you believe there is a ""two book"" system-- why would you sell now? Current estimates of the ""real value"" of AMC stock is around $2000 per share."
"Holding on to my 125 shares, hoping for a miracle."
Still here not going anywhere heads up rise and shine everybody we’re going to the moon again looks like we’re getting ready for another squeeze
"People, enjoy the weekend. Trust the process. "
"More often then not short squeezes are followed by a few days of dips, I think there is a potential this goes low (below $50) by Friday then moon sometimes next week. Jus take a look of a few historic short squeezes they all follow a similar pattern. DONT BE SCARED IF THIS GOES LOW it’ll jus set itself up for a moonride "
"Down 4% for the week, up almost 400% the previous 4 weeks, and bashers want you to abandon this stock when shorts haven’t covered? Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!"
"Our true enemy is the SEC. Humans we tax payers pay in order to ensure that the stock market is not being manipulated by institutions who have trillions of dollsars at their disposal and can use their funds to lower the true value of stock in favor of exploiting hard working citizens simply to line their pockets. The FED and SEC are very much aware of these manipulations taking place in the stock market. However, they have a conflict of interest in performing their Fiduciary Duties as they have behind the scenes connections with these HF and shorting Financial Institution which they also benefit from when these stocks are manipulated. So they snail like crawl their feet in enforcing the laws that would disallow such. Buying time for their behind the scene friends in order for them to force we the hard working people to sell our shares, allowing the HF managers and shorting institutions opportunities to buy legitimate shares. We need an independent third party to investigate the SEC members as well and prosecute them to the fullest evidence find them in violation of enforcing fair trading laws acts. Corruption needs to be eliminated at all cost. Especially when tax payers monies are paying trusted hired individuals to ensure there is fairly and equal trading opportunities for all when it comes to investment opportunities. Presently the playing field is not level and many government officials who gave law degrees have acknowledge that the stock market is being manipulated by managers of HF and Shorting Institutions."
"Alright, looks like we can communicate again today after what was a day of some big consolidation at AMC and another day that finished green although by just a hair. 002 kicks into full effect today and a lot of folks thinking it will be a major upheaval in the way we are priced at AMC. I don't expect much of a price increase from 002 if any at all. Once again the watchful SEC will need to become the enforcing SEC and they just do not seem to be enforcing anything at this time so expect more of the same there. Yesterday ortex reported that there are still 91 million short shares(that we know of) that are still to be covered. Shorts still need our shares and we are not selling so they will continue to need our shares. Please do not make them available. The morning looks pretty good for another hold by the apes in this price range. Do not worry about the price hanging around and not running like wildfire every day. To be honest if the price was going up 12% a day I would be more concerned than I am with the heavy support we have shown at these levels All is good at AMC this morning. Today I think is another day of finding that place or item that helps you to relax and just let it go. As we see the price swings are getting larger as we have seen 10% become almost the normal range here for the day. For now do not expect anything different. Again, the squeeze can happen at any minute, it is that close and it is coming. With enough pressure coming today there is a decent (60%) chance we will see a $60+ close today. That is a large mountain to climb with what we have seen this weeks but never underestimate the will of this Ape community. We were censored yesterday, I expect a little retaliation today against the shorts and hedges and the will to drive price up. Enjoy the day all. Higher highs are on the way."
"It’s VERY SIMPLE, shorts have to cover their positions one day or another, and the amount of short % is 20%. The stock price will go to unimaginable heights once the covering starts, but no one knows when that’ll happen. Either HF’s can keep paying monthly interest and eventually go bankrupt, or they can begin to cover and try to avoid bankruptcy. In either situation to stock price will keep climbing due to supply and demand economics. With HF’s paying interest monthly and not covering, the stock price will climb slower, with HF’s covering their short positions the stock price will climb much faster, but either way it’s going to climb. All that’s required is patience. It’s basically inevitable unless the government or SEC bails out HF’s somehow, which is unlikely."
Hey shorts. You think you can stop at AMC from finishing green today? ha.
"Billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin has left Faena House.GETTING OUTTA DODGE CITY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IF YOU ARE WILLING TO LOSE 13.8 MILLION!!!The founder and longtime CEO of Chicago-based Citadel sold his remaining penthouse at the ultra-luxury Miami Beach condo building, a three-bedroom, 4,243-square-foot unit, for $11.2 million. It was on the market for $12.5 million.Griffin, a Daytona Beach native who has amassed a huge residential land portfolio in Palm Beach, paid $60 million for two penthouses in the building in 2015. The purchase was considered a record for residential real estate in South Florida at the time, but the units were never combined.He sold the larger unit, a four-bedroom, 7,433-square-foot condo, in December for $35 million. That means he sold the two for about 23 percent less than their combined purchase price, incurring a loss of about $13.8 million on the properties."
I bought shares today and I'm buying more shares tomorrow! Who is with me???AMC TO THE MOON!!!
still have one and half hour
"APES: The plan was simple, Citadel bet against AMC hoping for bankruptcy. Make lots of money and if the company went bankrupt, Citadel was off of the hook paying capital gains taxes. Citadel had/has borrowed so many stocks that if AMC would have lost, no stocks to return, thus keeping all of the profit and the person who loaned them the shares, would have lost everything. Citadel bought 3 million Cinemark shares on the long. NOW MF is working hard at convincing readers today that Cinemark has been shorted as much as AMC. This is a LIE. Citadel hopes the naïve will start buying Cinemark, so the stock price increases, they can sell off at a profit and then try and cover their AMC losses. Citadel NEEDED AMC to go bankrupt, so that Cinemark was the only major theater chain standing. Cinemark has half of the theaters that AMC does. Had AMC gone bankrupt, Citadel would have scooped up vacant AMC theaters, and sold them to Cinemark, so they could expand their visibility across the world. This is WHY WE HODL!"
Wanna hear my theory? Was sorta quiet today with low volume. Calm even on a sideways day. Why? Rule 002 kicked in. Hedgies could only use whatever borrowed shares they already had left in the cupboard from the past few days previous to Wednesday. They couldn’t borrow more today without paying the price because of 002. So now their out. That means any buying from Apes won’t be easily countered and the price could jump and gap up. All that’s needed is just a little push….
Amazon to buy AMC

"Just remember that we are in the driver's seat and they need our shares. End game is near. That's why they are bashing at a higher intensity. Stock price is actually in the thousands in the dark pool. Do you really think they would be reacting to this stock in the 40""s??"
"From another YF poster. All should read. Looking back over the last couple of months of the AMC rise, I came across another price channel that appears to be similarly played out to where we are now.From May 13th to May 21st we were stuck in a price channel between around $12 to $14. When we first went to $12 on May 13th, we had volume of 296 million, the following 3 days we averaged around 185 million in volume and tested the $14 price only to be rejected on May 18th.On May 19th, 20th, and 21st volume dropped dramatically as we have seen occur this week, averaging around 66 million volume per day or roughly 1/3rd the volume from May 13th to the 18th.AMC proceeded to drop from a close of $14.03 on May 18th to a close of $12.08 on May 21st. Again sound like a similar trend?On May 24th, a Monday, volume returned and AMC shot from $12.08 to $13.68, Tuesday May 25th it closed at $16.41, Wednesday May 26th, $19.56, Thursday the 27th, $26.52, and Friday May 28th it closed at $26.12.The point of this is we are seeing a similar pattern develop over the last few weeks where we are in a channel that has consolidated beautifully. This channel is now 10 days old and is wound so tightly that when it explodes it could be wild and violent to say the least.We are showing characteristics of something ready to occur as volume has now tailed off, this tells me no one is really selling.A more telltale sign is that short interest as of Friday June 25th was up again as once again shorts borrowed more than they returned.We now sit with the following numbers per ORTEXSHARES ON LOANCurrent97.13m remember 102 million gets us to 20% of free floatThis data is as of close on Wednesday as the T+2 rule makes us wait for trades to clear.% FREEFLOAT ON LOANCurrent18.99%UTILIZATION OF BORROWED SHARESCurrent91.35%Now this is from close of business yesterdayEstimatedCurrent Short Interest95.45m meaning this many shares are what shorts are paying interest on which is due next week by the way.Bottom line is this, every hurricane takes time to develop, takes time to strengthen takes time to make landfall, but when it does it can cause devastation to anyone in its way. Shorts are in our way and Hurricane AMC is building to a category 5 with this 10 day consolidation.When the volume comes back and the buyers strike its gonna be fun."
All the fake accounts are in FULL FORCE this weekend. Buy more guys !!!!
We are not leaving
Today is a battle we must hold strong $RIDE $WKHS $AMC $WISH $CLOV $BB
"Just Hold!! Set no dates. Set no expectations, just info! They have a heads up if we set expectations!Just Hold!! And enjoy their bankruptcy and your new found wealth!!"
I always believe in this stock to go to the moon but it is being held back by HF if we get it over 50 and buy buy buy they will cover because they know it won’t go down from there
"Great, now they can start shorting it again"
This the part where the waves retract and the BOOM A MASSIVE TUSNAMI!!
"Imagine you are the manager of citadel....you already know you're bankrupt. Your only option is to manipulate the stock at this point hoping and praying you can last longer than retail is willing to hold. We've won already. Sit back, relax, and wait for the inevitable. s"
If you like money buy and hold like the over 400 institutions long on AMC for the short squeeze. Algorithms are about to push us to $150-200 without the short squeeze with margin calls
Invesco with nearly a 6 mill share purchase today!
"With the world watching this play, the options are limited is several ways. New rules put in place , listed on Threshold . The world is waiting to see if the little guy can still make a buck buying stocks in the market.No Pressure. There is no vulnerability left on this board, many hardened traders are here to win.Payday is right around the corner.If you invested your hard earned money, You should compensated with the True value of this stock."
This is a gold mine. The biggest opportunity in the market ever. Buy now or chase massive gains at $100+
The numbers don’t lie…we are winning BIG-TIME and the Cheatin’ Hedgies are effed…HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
"this message board needs a good revamping immediately. since throwing their weight behind the hedge funds (for money, of course), yahoo risks losing as much as the shorts do. i, for one, will leave yahoo completely once the ape war achieves a glorious victory. so, the hedge funds go broke and yahoo loses their only product...their reputation. think about that for a moment yahoo. there's still time to repair the damage you've caused. your choice !"
"APES, AMC has started the fake squeeze to shake us up. I’ll keep holding. Until AMC goes all the way up to the moon!!!!"
I'm liking this
Just bought 800 MORE SHARES!!!! Higher highs!!!! SEE THIS!!!! $45 easy push for lunch!!
Have Hedgies covered…NO!Is short interest up…YES!Do we OWN the float…YES!It’s not a matter of IF but WHEN the SQUEEZE will happen!BUY & HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
"Algorithms can’t process a large amount of data, that’s why it’s somewhat hard to get it over $60. Has been a major problems for engineers    AMC APES LETS GO "
"Apes this is awesome - no volume is absolutely the best thing we want... Please please please trust me when I say that. I was a trader for many many years. I am now 65. I treated many many stocks. What freaks the short sales out the most is when the volume gets low. It means retail is not selling. When the volume gets low the volatility goes down and that means the day traders do not trade. Shorts depend on the day traders to create some volatility to cover the short to average up their short position.When the day traders no longer trade the stock, when shorts cannot average up the position, I am in retail does not sell and we are seeing that right now this is when the squeeze happens. Just when you think everybody has forgotten about the stock. Just when you think it’s dead in the water. Damn the stock takes off. AMC is due for an incredible run please please please trust me. On the technical side you were set up for a massive movement, short interest is increased 5%, daytrading is going down, RSI is looking good... As God is my witness, and I’ve treated for many many many many years just hold on and trust the process. We all think we need volume no capital no. NO! As soon as the short sees that there’s no stock out there to cover their position, as soon as they see crazy asking prices. And as soon as a day trader are bored thenTurn AMC will you reach 500 to 1000 to 5000 to 10,000 $. Please trust me"
2 da’ MF mooooon!BUY & HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
Buy the short seller made dip. A modest chunk and stay the course for massive upside
Margies callin’ Shorty…tick tock tick tock…
Push up to $150.
"I put this in a reply but herre it is again for everybody, Trey didn't sell his AMC position, just more bashers lying to get you to sell.https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/mbwe9h/no_trey_of_treys_trades_did_not_sell_off_his_amc/"
Some buying pressure and volume sends this right back up.
"As of 11:32, there are ZERO shares left to borrow."
"Just the fact that can manipulate this stock so much and hide the real buy orders is unbelievable. The market is looking very corrupt now that we know what is really going on. Why would anyone invest after knowing all this?We are lucky because we own the float and everyone is holding but I hope other investors in other stocks are taking notice and learning that the odds are so stacked against the retail investor.When they start covering and institutions begin selling, do you think they will let retail gobble up some of those shares? Probably not. If it's going through Citadel, they can just put the buy orders aside and take every share that becomes available. We need to just hold the majority and will will outlast them."
"This past week was brutal, but we hung in there! It was a good win today, but we've still got a lot of ground to make up. Keep our eyes on the prize!"
Good time to BUY more before the next EXPLOSION… not a matter of IF but WHEN…BUY & HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
With this short interest we should go up $1 per half hour
Yapoo up to it’s old tricks againToday is Friday Aug 27thPerhaps AMC will make a run today
Look at the number of Call Options for Friday. Wow. Already over 300k iin the money. Huge day tomorrow and the day after and the day after. Love it.
"The real questions is how can retail investors make this AMC short squeeze happen?We know that short-sellers eventually have to cover their spots. This means that they will eventually have to buy AMC stock at the current share price. 1. If retail investors continue to drive the share price up by buying the dip and holding their positions, short-sellers will have no other option than to buy from the retail investor at a higher share price.NOTE: Retail investors do have to sell a bit as the price goes up in order to keep that momentum. Look at it as giving rats crumbs. Not only will they want more but they’ll need more.2. Retail investors will also need to buy the climbs in order to show a demand for the stock. This doesn’t have to be huge buys, rather incremental to validate the current share price.This play essentially creates a supply and demand scenario between retail investors and short-sellers. The results? A short squeeze . Im sensing we are getting closer by the day to our short squeeze goal, and the Hedge funds , and the short sellers just keep digging the graves deeper and deeper. When this pops up, it’s going to be so epic just st hold your shares and buy the dips if you can, every little bit helps our goals to the moon  "
"Really wish I could see inside these hedge funds homes when they have to tell their families they can't afford the lifestyle that they are a custom to.. LMAO sorry honey will have to get rid of the maid, sorry honey we can't afford that private school anymore for kids, sorry honey we have to downsize because I had to sell all my assets because I did a bad business deal. I would love to see the wife's reaction to all this. One day it will be a show some hedge funds wife will come out and be like we're doing a reality show"
"Everyone,don’t you agree that in the weekend when every basher is gone because they don’t get paid in weekends. I really lost some trust because of all the negativity but now I see that there is still major support for this cause thank you all please keep the positive commenting up it really motivates to hold"
"good idea to have all sell limits and stop losses off. wouldn't want to sell yourself short at like 10,000 or pennies like that. I will personally choose to sell on the way down to maximize gains."
Holdin since July 2020! Haven't sold one share..we got this! 
More Hedge Fund Investment firms that bet against GME and AMC are expected to fold before margin called by their brokers.

#AMC TO PLUTO SOON
AMC Strong!!! Doing great on this down market day!!!
Shares on loan are more than June.. If they start covering now imagine the spike of the price.. We gonna see 100+in one day.. They just wait to tank the price more to cover at lower price.
"FYI - “We recognize that it will take AMC years to repay its debt burden, and longer until it is able to revisit its growth strategy,"" says Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""We believe the company has sufficient liquidity to allow it to survive with low utilization through at least (the third quarter), now that most of its highest earning theaters have reopened."""
HF's are trying to convince us the squeeze happened. They want to lull us asleep by keeping the price here. They think we'll get bored and sell. Just HOLD. This is still very low.
"9% is bs, should be 90%"
Will AMC launch alongside Bezos tomorrow?
This is why you should get better jobs and real stocks instead of flipping burgers M-F
HF will keep fall and AMC will go up it just a matter of time y’all will run out of money to play with
Half of AMC shareholders hold more than 1k shares! Institutions loading up! Citadel sold almost a million AMC put contracts since June 30! Collateral requirements increasing for shorts and loopholes closing for Naked Shorting and FTD can kicking. MOASS time baby
The greatest generational wealth shift is well under way. We are going to have thousands of new millionaires made each day at the expense of hedgies. I ignore the bashers as I know how valuable each AMC share is worth. The price does not reflect true supply and demand..remember that.
This week's chart is starting to look exactly like last weeks. Just holding.
" This is a very Bullish Chart, traders! https://stockreport.tips/Bullish-Charts"
"They had to spends in the billions to pull this back a few bucks and yet the whole week we been in the mid 50's what a beauty the power of the crayon eating Apes, stay strong relax we are doing just fine, We are making history and revolutionary the stock market, with all the new rules in place this thing is going to fly very high see y'all on the moon baby "

"AMC is the highest performing stock in the market YTD because of all the people that held at single digits, after 5-6 red days in a row and said,""I understand the game being played. I'm buying."""
yahoo is fake news
AMC is part of the Threshold. Look it up. GME was part of it before it boomed. This is a fact.
Patience is key for this game we got nothing to lose a lot of us are in the green 80% of us since March and we’re up 500% we are still holding nobody should complain cause each share is gonna be worth 5-6 digits when they have to cover simple
Let's end the day on a good note. Just buy and hold.
"I love when my post P off the HF... Every 100 million we borrow, we make 250, million. Keyword is borrowed, so the interest rates plus the fact you have to give that 100 million. do you really make 250 million? No you do not, it's not even your money it's the investors money. Also you have to cover all the money that you've actually lost.. So once your tally it up you're pretty much broke. So you can sit there and say you make all this money but the facts are you guys are so in debt trying to short the stock you're not even breaking even. You guys should've been D D's because then you'd have a clue about the game."
"fact is, we own the float. eventually hedgies will need to buy shares from us in order to cover. that's what sets off the squeeze along with massive Tendies. HODL."
"If you can't see that this is going to be trading in the 10,000s then you ain't a real "
"All that manipulation, all that FUD and all that dark pool activity and they still can't keep AMC down. Keep the pressure Apes. Buy the dip if you want, buy the market and even buy the rise up as it adds more buying pressure. The few extra dollars here and there won't mean much when this MOASSes."
"It’s kinda shocking to read some people’s comments that a massive short squeeze is already a foregone conclusion.There are two things that propelled AMC up. 1. A legit short squeeze2. A mass influx of new traders buying up the stock.It’s done, if you bought above $30, chances are you will be sitting on a permanent loss."
"https://fintel.io/so/us/amc It's More, much more, $5000 is the whisper number, the amount it's trading for in dark pool."
"I decided to experiment w/AMC a few months ago by day-trading it. Made a few dollars here and there. Then spent some time doing a bit of research - listening to all sides - reading - reviewing what analysts were saying. A few things appear to be worth thinking about. (1) There are many hyped up Apes who are excited about the prospect of being rich - and their excitement is contagious; they bring others like themselves into the market. (2) Apes have been consistently buying up shares - both old Apes and new investors - helping to keep the price in a narrow range. (3) AMC is certainly not worth the current stock price - however, the value of shares has gone up so much, that the company certainly has a future - and can begin to use the $ gained through the uptick in stock price to leverage and reinvent itself. (4) Citadel and others who have shorted this stock are getting cornered - and as we know when cornered, the only natural response is to lash out - that accounts for all of the ""scary"" posts - warning of an armageddon-like price drop. Like some are saying, if they weren't worried, they wouldn't be wasting time here trying to scare people. (5) In reviewing the charts, the time does seem ripe for the shorts to begin saving themselves - they are spending much in interest, and at a certain point, it will be time to pay the piper - i expect that they have noticed that the Apes are not going to give in - and so they will need to. (6) My overall assessment is that the stock is ripe for a jump up this week - perhaps to the $75 level. That will be very bad for the shorts - and from there, who knows where the stock will go. I say, it's certainly worth taking some risk with extra cash if you have it."

in opening my account this Am in TdAmeritrade i see a positive story a Elon musk AI ETF is selling its positions in Wallmart and FB and buyingca 3.6% stake in AMC
I’m buying on this discount. This is a bargain. Thanks short. Hold longs!!
"AMC stock just made history, closed above 56,33 $ two consecutive days , first time ever, showing real strenght"
"no advice. keep holding, buying. I think we all just about don't care less what they do . we will win."
I think I see an opportunity in AMC. I may add to my position Monday.
We didn’t sell at 70…why would we sell now?
"Nice rally and the SSR is on for Tuesday, not too shabby at all..."
I'm not only holding but I'm buying today... and if this thing ever dips again I'm buying a lot more ... selling the boat the car the lady ... well I at least know the boat n car will sell... buynhold.. morning to all the good folk... even you bear .. I miss u...
TD AMeritrade and Yahoo both show 58.11 at market close - which is correct.Robinhood shows 57.98 at 4PMAnyone else seeing that?
"Did you guys see the new info that’s come out about dark pools? Such a shame. 47% of retail investors stocks they bought were sold on the dark pools, but not even on the dark pools it was through Citadels other version of the dark pools where it’s not tracked by Finra and doesn’t have to be reported. So those shares are just out there floating around and not part of the Nasdaq as they try and send FUD to scare you out of your shares and prevent this squeeze from happening. Citadel is not playing fare."
"Not selling one share since first buying in JanuaryNot for sale I bet some of these bashers are thinking  I should of bought and held like the longs said at 5.5, 10, 14, 29 etc."
"This is a bullish ascending triangle forming. Look up ""bullish ascending triangle"". Once a new high is made in the mid to high $70s, this puppy will rocket to $100 easy on short panic covering and longs and sideline watchers FOMO chasing. Looks like it's set for early next week.https://photos.app.goo.gl/jeABCT5C4maXy4ab8"
"For those of you new to AMC, or GME for that matter, take heed of the advice of some of the greatest Wall Street minds.... Be Patient and Think Long-Term,.... AMC and GME are not 100% predictable, much of the tactics and reactions have been thanks to wrinkle brain apes that have researched and posted a slew of due diligence. Just HOLD.Keep Emotions in Check,... If you expect the squeeze to happen today, then there is a real good chance you will be disappointed. There are hundreds if not thousands of accounts on this board saying to sell, Adam Aaron is a fraud, bla bla bla. They serve one purpose and one purpose only, to get you to doubt and sell, thus lowering the price. Ask yourself, why would someone I don't know, give a care about what I do with my money? If you threw cash off the roof of a building, would thousands of people tell you to stop? NO the shills have a purpose here, IGNORE THEM.Disregard Short-Term Forecasts,... The shills again, many will say it's falling, you're going to lose, etc. IGNORE THEM. Let the process work an buy when you can.Don’t Try to Time the Market,.... Buy and hold. No one knows when the squeeze will happen, but it will if we hold and stay focused on the goal. It costs nothing to hold. It costs the hedge funds interest every day, and if the price rises even more if they have to cover short positions, in the shirt term. They have already already lost massive amounts on AMC and GME, keep up the good work apes!Markets Fluctuate. Stay the Course,....We are seeing this now, but consider how far up since January lows thing has gone. If you got in recently, hold out, it will rise again. A Market Correction is an Opportunity,....Buy the dips if you can, if you cannot, just HOLD.Ultimately, it's a personal choice and you need to examine your own tolerance to risk. Remember this, there has never been more legit due diligence posted online about any single company from so many different sources. Read it and study to increase your comfort level, I didn't know jack back in January, but I feel a heck of a lot better now about my investment. I'm also up a very tidy amount in gains since January, but I'm not selling because I believe the best is yet to come.Good luck to all.Not financial advice, I'm not a financial advisor. I just like the stock. AMC APES!"
Newest reaction is 9 days old.......Citadel controlling the boards on Yahoo
seems their ladder is broken
OUR NEW GOAL APES:Its not about AMC anymore. Its about bankrupting Ken.ITS PERSONAL NOW. KEEP BUYING AND HOLDING.
I’ll keep buying amc over crypto any day of the week
"Whata surprise it’s doing exactly what I thought it was gonna do, shake the paper hands then everyone will get FOMO again in the dip then moon time  No timelines tho, who knows when this thing is gonna take off. I got shares at $26 $38 $44 $64 I ain’t selling a single one, I’m a true ape and I’ve seen a lot of so called “apes” get that paper hand panic WE CHASE BANANAS remember the shorties covered only a minuscule amount of shares today not even a dent into how much they hav to buy back. Multiply this number by 13 that’s the number y’all will see in the next few months"
"There needs to be meaningful consequences, not teeny fines. 2014, Citadel was fined $800,000 for irregularities in its trading practices between March 18, 2010, and Jan. 8, 2013 In 2017, Citadel was fined $22 million by the SEC for misleading clients regarding the way it priced trades.[65]In 2018, Citadel was forced by the SEC to pay $3.5 million over violations stemming from incorrect reporting for nearly 80 million trades from 2012 to 2016.[66]In 2018, Bloomberg reported that 40% of Robinhood's revenues were derived from selling customer orders to firms such as Citadel Securities and Two Sigma Securities.[67]In January 2020, Citadel paid a 670 million-yuan ($97 million) settlement for alleged trading irregularities dating from 2015.[68]Citadel Securities was fined $700,000 by FINRA in July 2020 for trading ahead of customer orders.[69] They delayed certain equity orders from clients to buy or sell shares while continuing to trade the same stocks in its own account as part of its market-making activities, according to FINRA.In 2020, Citadel Securities was censured by FINRA a total of 19 times for a variety of misconduct, including failing to close failure-to-deliver positions, naked short selling, inaccurate reporting of short sale indicators, executing trades during circuit-breaker halts, and failing to offer its clients best prices on the bid-ask spread.[70]On March 25, 2021, Citadel agreed to a censure by FINRA and a $275,000 fine for improperly reporting nearly 500,000 Treasury transactions between 2017 and 2019, revealing a systemic failure in Citadel's compliance systems."
"Let’s see how today plays out, I unfortunately sense red, but really hoping for the 50’s, but we all know HFS don’t want this past the 49 range cause then there’s no stopping this till the 60’s"
"there was no technical analysis that predicted 12 to 72, a 600% jump within 3 weeks , SI is higher now than it was at 12 , we are at 55+ right now pm. You know what it isss!!!"
Hey YF please show current / recent post
"If they think we will sell for hundred per share they better think again. After taxes that ain't nothing. If we hold for the first couple of times they try to bait us, they will raise the price again, they will repeat this process of trying to shake out the weak hands. The more we wait and refuse to sell cheap, the more we will make. If they offer us a 100 dollars and many people take it, the price may never get high. Also, they want to squeeze before we find out the share count. They have a chance to beat us if we are going to fold on the first offer."
This is the biggest opportunity of our lives to date
"APES will be buying so many things by fall, we'll make the unemployment rate drop to 1% Haha!!"
"Just hold there will be no bag holders, 4 billion synthetic shares, only 500 million shares floated, we own 80% we cannot lose, no bag holders on this stock hedge funds need to cover all their positions."
Hit $59 and it’s like yesterday and today never happened! Except that they have to pay daily
Tune out the noise and realize that patience pays. I've been in since January and I've also been in plenty of opportunities where I missed out on huge gains for a lack of patience. NIO was one of my biggest mistakes. In at 2.64 out at 3.19. patience=big money. #notfinancialadvice
"Hedge Funds: ""Don't let this stock get too high"" the stock:"
Buy and hold
Last two times this bounced the RSI was around 42.50. we are very near that point again. Expect this to bounce again soon.
Funny how they can take a stock down this much even if retail owns the float
Time is our most precious asset. We own the outstanding float. We won’t be leaving until every short position is closed. And we sky rocket to extraordinary levels
More than one person confirming 2nd book price of $5k..and a rare and mega bullish parabolic arc formation is showin on charts..we're gettin close guys..holdin since July 2020 so OG  here 
"This is the reason I spend no time in Yahoo anymore. Too many clowns show up and try to prey on longs fears.We have been here since $8 Some were down when they bought at $20 for a long while. Some are down now, but all I talk to are buying more on these generous dips.The clowns in here will tell you shorts have miraculously covered. Well truth be told, they dropped us 15% today, ran it up a few times hunting for real shares and still ended up adding 1.36M more shares to their short stack at days end.What does that tell you? No one is holding and shorts are not covering.Please ignore or block the paid shills who are working for hedge funds. Know who the real longs are because we have thick skin and have been here since January with no plans of leaving and allowing hedge funds to steal from the average American any longer."
"AMC is so strong that not even all of these short attacks can impact it. Short interest rose over 4% yesterday and is at 2.30% today.The best that the could do is bring us down to $51 and change.UTILIZATION of borrowed shares is back up as you can see.Current94.287 days ago82.9092.2 million shares are on loan as of today which is up from 87.50 million just 7 days ago.002 goes into effect tomorrow. Shorts are in a real hole and there seems to be no way out.I believe there is a good chance we close in green today and then we may see some fireworks soon. With an automated intraday liquidity check staring at hedgies everyday, much of the manipulation used to attack stocks will now be impossible to pull off.I would at least expect the routine to change as hedgies may be able to play games after each liquidity is complete each day so we may have to look at new daily trends, but overall shorts are on a much shorter leash beginning tomorrow and it is showing today as AMC just will not fade regardless of the shorting going on today.Good Days Are Coming Soon. The Game Has Changed."
Relax
T-35 + 002 being being passed and effective on Wednesday right away! What can I say!? Holy cow! You know what’s next MARGIN CALL! So BUY AND HOLD!!!!!!!
breaking $57 today is crucial gets us out of the pennant and primed for a breakout. imo*not a financial advisor*
"As rocky outcrop says this chart movement is called a sideways shake out, trying to test the patience of APEs and make options more difficult."
"Jim Cramer said, anyone shorting AMC and GameStop are going to lose. And he’s right. Retail investors are holding until shorts are squeezed out of their positions.Shorts can either: 1 Take the loses and close their positions right now where the stock price is around $54. 2 Or, get squeezed out of their positions at a high interest rate above $54, resulting in even bigger losses.With hedge funds shorting AMC losing billions of dollars its first quarter, it’s no surprise we’re going to the see this occur their second quarter as well.How will this affect AMC stock price?I can imagine shorts and hedge funds alike must be furious. The little guy causing a disruption, what!?!￼My personal take is retail investors are going to continue to see foul play. You’re going to experience this from bogus headlines. They’ll usually try to steer the public from buying AMC stock to keep the volume and hype down.Not sure if hedge funds know this yet but you do know documentaries of what’s taking place are in the works right?Independent filmmakers such as the Mulligan Brothers will be covering this story from the retail investors perspective and rumor has it Netflix will be writing as well.Expect AMC stock price to rise and continue to be shorted. We will see volatility with shorts attacking the price action. They do this by trading synthetic shares at low bids.Hang in there just hold buy the dips and I’ll see you on the "
"Futures recovering from the Fed spooking it on Friday (which triggered the selling of AMC near end of day). A huge Bullish Ascending Triangle formation is almost complete, predicting a massive spike in the stock price by today or Tuesday. Shorts are about to get creamed. Once the stock price makes a new all time high over the mid $70s, EVERY SINGLE short will be under water. We'll see panic covering like we haven't seen before. Their only options are: cover high or cover higher.While apes are buying and holding, to gain more shares, once the stock rallies really high on any given week, sell covered calls a few % above the high share price. You'll get good money for it. Turn around and buy more shares of AMC with it. Keep doing this weekly and you will have dozens of times more shares than you originally started with in a few months. Who doesn't want free AMC shares???? Plus buying more shares ensures the stock price can be pushed above $1,000+. Let's do this apes. Play smart, and get that free money. Vicious positive feedback, self-sustaining loop. AMC will be the most epic short squeeze in the history of the stock market.https://photos.app.goo.gl/6PCMTagGSyhxRke56"
yo!
"47 million ftds have to be dealt with between this upcomeing Wednesday and august 19th I suspect when we see the first half of July report it will be high as well. In the past the avoided a ftd pump because they shorted...they won't have 47m to short this time! They used ftds and shorting to keep most june and July options otm to kill down gamma effect when they cover. The facts are in the options, ftds, short intrest change, and price action."
$60 INCOMING
"I talked three people into buying shares, promised them this their ticket to freedom! They all bought 3 shares!"
"Hundreds of millions of shares for AMC may have been sold and the hedges need to buy back.This is why they didn't close at 5 dollars. Hold you r shares, each one is worth a bar of gold."
You can take this down 10 or 20 % but remember one thing hedgies ; we have got all the REAL shares so keep on playing till it is hammer time !
I’ve always been cautious with respect to price targets but I think the big jump is coming very soon. It just feels like it’s happening. We can blow over a 100 in a blink of an eye and then possibly 300-400 in very short order.
"June 20, 2021 - this stock has the potential to reach $231,000. Not financial advise, as no one really knows how high this could go. BUY, HOLD AND REPEAT, NOT JUST ON THE DIPS. WE ARE NOW RAMPAGING THROUGH THE CONCRETE JUNGLE! THOSE THAT STAND IN THE WAY WILL BE CRUSHED!"
"I sold DPLS to buy more AMC, bought 1K shares"
We own the outstanding float and we’re not leaving
"AMC is going to the moon very, very soon. GLTA AMC APES."
Like this post for BEAR. He's losing his retirement lol 100k floor. We are united.
"all collective data on charts and recent box office success, with big box stuff on deck indicates mass accumulation period ahead and longs holding with no grace for shorts."
"This has been a fairly strong test of the will of the AMC Apes. As we have been saying, be prepared to be tested and tempted. This is the plan of the shorts and the hedges. We knew it was coming, we were prepared and it appears that very few sold shares during this downturn in price. Again, remember the target price you have for selling your shares, it isn't $37 or $38,. so price still means nothing. What matters is the short positions are still open and still costing these hedge funds millions every day they refuse to cover. We have to give them a tip of the cap, this was their best effort to date to get weak hands to sell. For all of those who are still holding, you are going to glad you did in the long run. When you see 6 figures disappear from your trade balance it is tough to hold. I admit, I was bummed watching that, but I know what I own and I know that the basis behind this movement has not changed. NOT 1 SHARE left my hands. The price will be back. They can play all the games they want but at the end of the day, they still have a lot of short shares to cover and we own them. They cannot buy them until we set the price and start selling. Enjoy the evening."

"AMC chart analysis for those who missed it: Bullish Ascending Triangle. When the triangle formation is complete, it'll rocket up. Lapes (ladies) and Gentleapes (gentlemen), behold, an imminent short squeeze is upon us. Charts predict this will happen Monday or Tuesday. The interesting part is once it makes a new all time high in the mid $70s, E-V-E-R-Y SINGLE SHORT will be under water. We'll see panic covering like we've not seen before from shorts, just like when AMC crossed the $36+ all time high threshold a few weeks ago. Sideline watchers and paper hand longs will FOMO chase the price, pushing it up even higher. $100+ is coming.https://photos.app.goo.gl/nkuo8cR7SeBeMJZo9"
AMC going past $50 per share cause AMC is on fire!
"Time for a pep-talk: AMC has done exactly what it is supposed to do. We have risen this stock from $5.00 to $55.00 where it has leveled off. If we want to see $65-$70 next week, the only thing we need to do is continue doing what we've been doing, which is BUY and HOLD. If you've already bought, then just HOLD. We knew it was going to be an uphill battle, but we're winning. Stay strong. The unity is working."
Over $60 by end of this week...Mark my words..Check my resume..
A must read for all AMC buyers.https://franknez.com/what-will-an-amc-short-squeeze-look-like/Amc is the #hood
I bought another 300 shares friday so i have a plan for today
We created history for a more fair market place for all retail investors
"All the pump and dump squeeze stocks the shills have been pushing tanked. Amc is the true squeeze stock in play with mind boggling numbers to back it up. Don’t be fooled by hedgies latest ploy to steal your stocks. I will hold for you, you will hold for us. Stay thirsty my friends. We will drink fro the cup of success soon"
"Yahoo AMC chat server, too much positive sentiment"
Me thinks this is a very unusual time to see the price going up just prior to the lunch-break.Very odd and very promising if you ask me.
"$HOOD $AMCFor AMC today, It is clear sailing up to a big wall at $49.52.... So let's take it up to THAT wall, and scale it tomorrow...Meanwhile... It looks like AMC and HOOD will cross paths today or tomorrow at around $47.50... AMC on the way up, and HOOD on the way down... Never to cross paths again!!! Viva la AMC!!!Remember, when HOOD spirals down to around $36 and is still heading south, we are probably, at that point, in the beginning of the AMC squeeze... Until then, we are building pressure.. Volume super good yesterday AND today... Be proud Apes, knowing that we already won, we are just waiting for the prize to be delivered!!!..."
They had some interesting insights about AMC on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
55.00-57.00 is the next Target
HOLD FOR GOLD!
There is no catalyst for a price drop today. Clearly continued massive shorting
There is too much misinformation floating around that is intended to destabilize the Ape Army. Anyone who has seen the Adam Aron interviews on Trey's Trades knows that the CEO is against the hedge funds. The proposed 25M shares will not be used against the Ape Army. Watch the interviews to get a history lesson on how previously authorized shares were used. The silverback is on our side.
"As I understand it, this price is also fakery? That is, the shorts have not covered, and the price is still being made artificially, by two main trading blocks, swapping shares back and forth. If so, the MF article about how AMC could squeeze and $2000 is possible is simply a new attempt to manage expectations and get people to sell early. Or early-ish. Does this sound about right?"
"AMC INVESTORS:HEDGE FUNDS ARE TRYING TO CREATE EMOTIONAL FATIGUE. THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN OUTLAST THE RETAIL INVESTORS.This is why it is so important for those investors who are having difficulty hand the volatility to walk away right now. For hedge funds, this is a game, that for the most part, they have always won. They have software designed to evaluate emotional trends and identify patterns. I cannot predict the squeeze as there are events that have taken place for which we have no control. This should have squeezed already and hedge funds have billions, not millions, but billions of shares that need to be bought back. THERE IS NO WAY OUT FOR THE HEDGE FUNDS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF YOU, THE INVESTOR. IF THEY COULD HAVE FIXED THE DAMAGE THEY HAVE DONE, WE WOULD NOT HAVE THIS CONSTANT ILLEGAL AND DECEPTIVE MANIPULATION-THEY WOULD HAVE FIXED THIS PROBLEM AND MOVED ON TO THEIR NEXT TARGET.They are still here because you are the obstacle standing in their way of reaping billions in profits and hindering them from moving on to their next target. Your failure to give in to the corruption perpetrated by the hedge funds and the acceptance by the DTC and SEC is why AMC is still at the forefront of conversation and we are characterized as degenerates. It is quite interesting, how titles have changed. You can be law-abiding, hardworking people who are investing in a stock and you are referred to as degenerates;However, you have billions in your bank, are stealing from the common person to get those billions, the SEC pardons you because you have billions, the DTC writes new rules and regulations because you have billions to impact those rules and regulations but you are the victim being harassed by the very people from which you have been fleecing capital for years. THIS IS AMERICA, THE GREAT COUNTRY AND LAND OF OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL BUT RIGGED IN FAVOR OF A FEW. Set your emotions aside. There is no room to get weepy and hedge funds do not give a 'ship' as they would steal the shirt off of your 'mother's back if it was the only one she had left but they could make a buck or two'Understand what you invested in, understand the potential, and focus on the goal!!!"
"Bulls want to see AMC's stock regain the eight-day EMA as support and for bullish volume to break the stock up out of the triangle and above a resistance level at $57.16. If it can regain that level as support, it has room to move up toward $61.26.HOLD YOUR SHARES !"
Where is Bear?Aren't we supposed to be below 30 by now?
"When AMC does pop with gamma squeezes right before the major major squeeze afterwards ,you decide to sell early.if you make this decision you are betting that the shorts can bring down this price afterwards. Simply by looking at AMC’s yearly charts I could not risk selling to early, because when this thing begins to pop it could and can take entirely week or two weeks to play out the biggest squeeze!"
This price action up and down is nothing all manipulation! WE ALL KNOW THIS IS EASILY WORTH 800+ PER SHARE ONCE THE HF COVERS!!!
"1). For Lit (NYSE) Exchange: Float: 513M shares; 2). shorted shares: 87M shares (or about 17% shorted shares); Retail investors own more than 80% of AMC stock; 4).

"Did you saw it 18% GME , but AMC still 8% , but till the end of the day it will be 20%!!!!"
Good morning everyone. They need our shares. They need them so they can cover all of their manipulation. Absolutely don't sell. We are winning. Official registered data shows 80 million short shares. This does not include unregistered. Also around estimated 6 billion naked shorts. They have dug themselves a grave. That is why they are selling out of other stocks to pay what they owe. Not to mention Virgin and Meta surprising the hedges. They will have no choice to cover a huge margin call. Sit back. Hold and Buy if you can.
Buy open at market then going to the beach.. then back home to buy at the market on close... trust the process....
Not leaving.
hfs in deep trouble if the rumors about gme giving out dividends on Wed come true . it's all over for them
