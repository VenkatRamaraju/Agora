"Congratulations to the shorts today  for losing another couple $100M for suppressing $AMC. Clients gonna be pulling their investments from your funds, and law suits will ensue! "
"Sorry to say we are not going to recover to the 50's this week HF can't afford it. They need us under $45 and fast. Still the same gameplan, HODL!! It will take time, just chill and relax. If we could honestly get it and hold it at $50 by EOD Friday then zoom we go. But HF can't afford it to happen. They are gonna kick that can farther down the road. They have not learned. Everyone Banks, other HF, Retail... all know what this will do to the market, everyone is prepping. They are gonna drag everything down when this rockets. This is going to be an epic cluster for the US. But, it's healthy in the end."
"AMC investors: i have posted the message below at least 9 times, and communist yahoo continues to delete it, so if you read it, please copy and repost so that it can be sharedhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keX6XhKBVqs&t=35sI have been posting this all over the place for the past 4-5 days but it has been deleted here at least 7 times. In October 2009, the SEC pacified the investors by telling them they were lookin into abuse taking place in the dark pools; however, we are now at October 2021, a total of 12 years later. Once would have to wonder how quickly they work or just acknowledge the corruption. One thing to consider is the annual salary of these individuals working for the SEC/DTCC/FED or in politics. Many of these individuals earn annually !74K - $ 300K a year but their net worth is in the millions. Gary Genslers net worth is over $ 100 million. How is that possible on his salary and just look at the net worth of other top-ranking senators/politicians.One final note: You can see that the Biden administration has transformed this country into something unrecognizable in less than 10 months and one that would make the founding fathers 'roll over in their graves' but yet, Gary Gensler is unable to suspend illegal activity in the dark pools!!!!!"
"Remember, we hold to bleed them dry, NO MATTER how long it takes. They will say ANYTHING to deter us, but their words of ""encouragement"" are proof we still have the upper hand here. Some of you have no idea how much this movement can positively affect the market dynamic in the future; just HOLD! If the SEC deems this B.S. ""legal"", then so be it. The beauty about the market algorithm not getting edited to combat manipulation is it still allows the retail investors, when banded together, to FORCE squeezes on these hedge funds. Yes, they have the funds to drag their games out and make you THINK you don't have the upper hand, but that's just how the game goes. Buy, hold, go live life, and eventually come back to a very pretty profit. Good luck everyone!"
TKXHFPotential to climb 50 - 100 fold from here.Market Cap $ 9 million.Could become a $500 million company easily .
"Why is bank of America SHORTING amc illegally,nothing is being done. It's not only bank of America, as the onion layers get peeled back this is getting exposed."
#AMC not selling
Hey Citadel how about releasing some of those buy orders into the lit market 
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"
"Derp,@derp Good try. I know your paid wage does not require much in the way of calculations. Lets use a few sites for numbers https://fintel.io/so/us/amchttps://fintel.io/so/us/amc/citadel-advisors-llchttps://www.ortex.com/stocksIf we were only being conservative. I will use approximations on the lower side so that you can get the pictureLegal shares 100,000Institutional shares 138,066,484Insider shares 1,600,000.Investors at a conservative average of 120 shares per 4.2 million investors. Now, all you need is a little calculator to add those numbers, the look at your bosses positions and use the float of 513,000,000 as guidance to tell everyone that synthetic shares do not exist. Next, when we subscribed to Say Technology it extracted our shares from our broker and after 65,000 investors information was pulled, it displayed an average amoun of shares per investor of 1,066. Now that I gave you an example previously, add up all of the numbers for AMC previously provided; however, multiply the 4.2 million investors by an average share amount of 1,066. There are billions of synthetic shares. Derp, if you are attempting to sell a lie, make sure that you can back it up with the numbers."

Elon holds AMC
HOLD 4 GOLD!
Fun fact!!!!AMC and GME had a higher buy to sell ratio than HOOD but yet hood went up with 48 pending court cases and AMC and GME went down.Could a Shill please explain to me mathematical how with higher buying pressure the prices go down??? LolLove you manipulate much??
Today is Friday August 6th and the earliest conversation shown is 10 days ago.
"Citadel has done some major SHADY stuff, including not telling the truth. As SEC reinforces rules AMC will continue to grow stronger. Only when SEC enforces the rules will AMC be able to accel. Keep holding, keep buying. Keep the truth going."
$40 is coming. Patience is the key.
"August 8th is day 1 for hedgies to action failure to deliver. It's also when earnings come out. Until then, hedgies will bully people into selling. Why would anyone care so much about you and tell you to sell?"

Even the rich privileged Congressmen are scared of and know what is coming with the $AMC squeeze of all squeezes. They can't stand it when common people have the ability to become wealthy by turning the tables on the ultra rich and their years of market manipulation.
AMC should have a register for all the shares. Shareholders could have access online to confirm they own real shares and not phantom HF trickery. And AMC will be able to help the APES that helped them.
"I had 5k when stock was $2. Sold at $3 - $4. Who could have imagined the stock goin to $37 and if that wasn’t high enough, doubled to $73 that same day? Wow! Had I acquired another 5k and then sold at $73 would’ve amounted to $730,000. 20k shares = almost $1,500,000. Guess what, fundamentally, the stock ain’t worth $2. The stock turned shareholders who owned at $2 into a millionaire practically overnight. EXCEPT FOR THOSE MEME INVESTORS WHO BOUGHT AT >$70. They still holding the bag, unless they bought a lot of puts to protect that huge profit. Eventually, the stock will drop back to $2 and if it did, I wouldn’t be buying. Not at $2 not a $1. The company will never be profitable. You have a business that’s been burning $100 to $200 million a month for years."
I'm extremely optimistic about AMC next week. Past $50 psychological barriers which will bring in new apes and lead to some gamma covering. Bullish 13.95% up for the week.58% up for the month.
"I am employed by a multi-national dark pool and I have been instructed to put in overtime on this message board, the very forum which we also control, and thus, it is disabled for all but our chosen few. My firm is headquartered in Tel Aviv, but all trade records are kept in the Cayman Islands for tax evasion reasons. We also have a satellite branch in Sao Paulo, Brazil where we keep our full arsenal of synthetic shares, otherwise known as phantom whales. Our full tilt ladder attack on AMC was quite successful today. The only ingredient missing is explosive volume, so we will push this hype down a few more ladder rungs tomorrow by utilizing our AMC phantom whales in Brazil. Large sell orders are already in place. We won't be satisfied until the apes are in wet panty mode, and since these mammals are a stubborn bunch with their religious chants--HODL--that means panic selling won't ensue until we drive AMC below $35-. That is our plan, and I openly reveal our machinations. You can liquidate now, or you can wait and attempt an escape below $10-. Our ultimate goal is to have AMC shares delisted from the NYSE, but long term, AMC will do a fine job of self-imploding without our assistance. Take this knowledge brother, and may it serve you well."
Fresh Motley Stool article out. That means load up on shares of AMC!
lets close it at $40 today!!!! we can and we have the power!!!!!! buy the dip!!!!! buy buy buy buy buy
Hold
Nice volume LOLAny time it will continue dropping. Just taking a rest.
hold
"92,798 call options expired in the money. Nice hold."
Bots in here trying to pressure us to sell is all the conformation that I need 100k the floor after this is done the bots gonna work for us
"AMC investors: You can see today, that Hedge funds borrowed a significant amount of shares to take this down. THEY CAN TAKE THIS DOWN ALL THEY WANT BUT THEY NEED TO BUY BACK THE SHARES.THE ONLY THING STANDING IN THEIR WAY OF ACHIEVING THEIR GOAL IS US AND OUR EMOTIONS.THEY WILL TAKE IT DOWN, ALLOW IT TO RUN UP, TAKE IT BACK DOWN AND EITHER TAKE IT TO NEW LOWS OR KEEP IT MOVING IN A SIDEWAYS POSITION. THE REASON THEY ARE GOING THIS IS THAT THEY ARE DELAYING WHILE PLAYING ON OUR EMOTIONS. THEY HOPE TO OUTLAST RETAIL INVESTORS BY PLAYING ON YOUR EMOTIONS AND CAUSING YOU TO SELL OUT OF BOREDOM OR SHEER FRUSTRATION. IF WE HOLD, WE CAN WIN. IF WE SELL, HEDGE FUNDS WILL BE CELEBRATING AND HAVING A 'TOAST' AT OUR EXPENSE. WE ARE A 'THORN' IN CITADEL'S SIDE AND HE IS BANKING ON HAVING THE ABILITY TO HIJACK OUR EMOTIONS AND GET US TO SELL."
Movie theatres... that's so last century.
"I think AMC at $33 is still very cheap! Now with the trend up, I may buy in even more tomorrow! To the MOON...."
#AMC Seriously Gary Gensler and the SEC how much more evidence do you need to prove manipulation of a stock price?
As usual Hedge funds and shorted using any negative market sentiment to manipulate AMC down.Whilst others panic sell I’m buying bargains all over the market.AMC IMO is the biggest at this price. Holding and buying since January.
"$AMC 69,420 is the floor once the first billion of synthetics is bought back, then it's to the Milky Way from there!!"
I put in most recent to find the comments but Yahoo really showing me the ones from 9 days ago nice.
Almost 7.5+6 million shares shorted over two days. Only could drop by few cents.

"It's a scare tactic, clearing out the weak hands before the earnings and possibly a boom. I'm here to stay!!!. no point telling people to buy or sell anymore it is your choice. AMC NOT LEAVING"
"Investors should be aware that AMC stock already trades at a high price-to-sales ratio of 12, and that explains why the stock is trading down after the positive news today. A strong finish to 2021 might not necessarily translate into a higher stock price."

Thank you yahoo for showing who you support.... NOT retail investors.... Why is AMC the only board messed up????
The reason why AMC has not gone to the moon yet is because I'm still in it.
"AMC in review:$2 at the New year.Spiked 10x to $20 by jan. 27.Returned to single digits until mid March. (Shills said it was a pump and dump, and it was finished)Nearly tripled by March 18th.Camped out in the high singles until mid-May. (Shills said it was a pump and dump and AMC was toast)Spiked to $72 intraday on June 2nd.Current reconsolidated in high $30's. (Shills again claim it's a dead cat pump and dump).Here's the thing: pump and dumps don't last 7 months.And the thesis hasn't changed: high short interest (probably higher than we realize... posted numbers are just estimates, and funds regularly lie on 13f's), an increase in S&P rating, and an increase in regulatory interest, as we continue to get increasingly vocal.Yes, fundamentals are poor, but improving (hence S&P's rating increase and ""path to solvency""), and bottom line: Shorts. Must. Cover.$39 is the new springboard. We've demonstrated that 7 -10x weekly jumps are possible (don't know when, just that the _first shorts_ to buy and close will likely get the best prices, so there's ""blood in the water"" among them.)Longs are in a good place. Just be patient."
"Why are latest reactions 7 days old, Yahoo Finance? And why have you hidden/deleted this same post twice in the last 10 minutes? Does it really contravene your code of conduct?"
Have shorts covered?…NOPE!Is short interest high?…YEP!Do Apes OWN the float?…YEP!BUY & HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
Yesterday was very significant day for those trading ( or trapped ) in AMC. You judge a stock by how it reacts to news. Yesterday we had very positive news of a blockbuster weekend box office. Initially the stock climbed over 39 then collapsed under 37. If you had any doubts before....it is now clear what direction this stock is headed. DOWN !

They had some interesting insights about AMC on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
What will be outcome of Cold War (buy and sell ) between retail investor and hedge fund ? How much patience needed to hold stock and time line ?
"If the share price starts rising drastically out of nowhere, what does that tell you? It tells you that they are either closing their positions, which they cannot because there are not enough shares for that unless we all sell. The other reason the share price will rise like heat, they are releasing buy orders that were parked in their offline database. Think about that for a moment. Ok. this just verifies that they have been parking buy orders in mass. They have been killing all the momentum for the last seven months by hiding the buy orders. During the stimulus payouts, tax returns and many more positive catalysts that should have increased the share price, it actually did but they were hiding it. Now to be fair, AMC sold a bunch of shares, Wanda sold a bunch of shares and this did not help but that wasn't enough to keep the price at the level it is today. We are looking at a fake number. The share price could be ten to fifteen times what we are seeing.The only reason I am not marching down on wall street and putting together protests is, they can do a ton of manipulation but the one thing they cannot do is forever hide the shares that were already purchased because it is a matter of record in our broker accounts. So in the end it doesn't matter, unless we sell early we will become rich."
Let’s RIP!BUY & HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
Shorts haven’t covered. Period. I will sell after they cover. Period

"I live in a part of California where AMC is over 2 hours away....but still go for the ""Shock and Awe""effect of the movies there. I buy AMC gift cards to support the theatres and leave filled with popcorn and 8 buck Slurpee!!!!!!!!!"
great spot for me to finally get in!
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don't start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
"Basically trading side ways...this is perfect with low volume. Not getting much lower, the only option soon will be for the shorts to cover. Once that happens, the exponential rise begins.Amc is the $hood"
We love the stock. I love my amc warriors
I've had a change of heart. I love AMC. Go longs!!
"If you cash needs a boost, pay close attention to $SPRT ..already up 1.00 after hours, Possibly to $50 to $100 by Friday. Merger happening with super short float. Then you can buy more AMC.. Cmon Apes, lets do this. Shares are hard to get. Buyers are reporting buy orders being rejected. No Shares available. APES UNITED . This may be as big as AMC squeeze. Check it out for yourself... Love to All APES "
"This is what happened:The small-cap Russell 2000 sank by 1.4% to 2,209. Look at the graphs, you will see the pattern among stocks included in the Russell 2000. The Russell index declined based on inflation fears."

"Obviously the smart money had access to the ""advance ticket sales"" on Friday.....selling the stock down over $1.00. And sure enough the box office number....$23 million was very disappointing ! Predictions of a 100 million weekend for James is not going to happen. I see a break of 35 and a run down to 30 support.....very soon."
Ok time for us all to buy 1 share more. They cannot compete with our numbers when we stand together!
"AMC investors:Why would Ken Griffin and others spend millions of dollars employing paid shills to post false and misleading information? Obviously, there is a reason he is spending so much money in an attempt to influence investors to sell.HE NEEDS YOUR SHARES AND THE ONLY WAY HE CAN GET THEM IS IF YOU SELL. CONDUCT YOUR RESARCH USING EXTERNAL SOURCES. PAID SHILLS HERE EARN THEIR HOURLY WAGE BY BASHING AMC. THIS IS WHAT THEY DO FOR A LIVING."

"The shorties loop holes are disappearing, no more short laddering. The volume is low for now, once the banks and brokers force margin calls to offset a tanking market, the covering of shorts will begin and like a domino effect.FOMO volume will go through the roof, the spikes will exponentially increase. We are almost there fellow $AMC investors.Amc is the $hood"
Courtesy of Antonio MartinezThey have said this about AMC.....- It would go bankrupt- It would go to $0.01- That the squeeze already happened- No one is going to the movies- It would never see $50 againThey were wrong. And they say MOASS won't happenSuper Bullish #AMC
"AMC investors: Paid shills out in droves and they would like to portray the image that they are here just passing through for no other reason but they are compassionate and concerned about their fellow man and woman. On a paid shill wage, it is not a secret that their mental capabilities are limited. They are connected to AMC because of their pay check and the script they are paid to recite and repeat."
Breakthrough to $150. Then to Mars form there.
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Rightpicker.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
Wow! Fundamentals are pointing to a bright future. AMC is doing well. I wonder why anyone would short this? I guess big egos fall hard.
Shorty STILL hasn’t covered…WE’RE NOT LEAVING!HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
It's a good feeling when there are so many bashers in this place....reminds me of the old days of Feb/March/April. I think something moonish is about to happen soon!

don't buy options don't fall into their trap ..you can't win in option ..buy actual shares and hold...
Moon
It just keeps getting easier to buy more as it drops. The float is being controlled by holding. The manipulation is synthetic. When the shorts have to cover/ close they will be paying over and over again and again to close. Marge will start things off and the unraveling will begin. Hold hold HODL. That simple remember together we are strong.

Very little membership growth in AMCStock reddit and WSB. Social media posting volumes are down and perhaps more importantly the implied vol on AMC options is too high for a gamma squeeze to be executed. Apes have also lost tons of capital speculating on just out of the money short term AMC options. Can't wait to see the overextended Apes that bought on margin respond to this post. EM? What do you say?

"Stop wasting your time and money just cover it, no one is selling."
Gary Gensler just confirmed he is looking into the dark pools and market structure. The fun is about to begin.
I heard about AMC the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Squeeze cannot start until shorts sell first short share to cover, still 0% covered, they can pay high interest still, FOMO kicking in $50-70, shorts started sold number to start, then you will get a squeeze. As long as no big banks loan them cash like last time as margin balance 200% minimum required. Once they start buying shorts, price will start to spike above Ath. Aa soon as they ran out of liquidity, go into margin balance, they get a warning to cover in 2 days, then you are in A short squeeze!!! Until then you just buy if you can and hold if you can! This is not a financial advice! AMC amazing"
Why do these writers waste their time authoring articles about AMC's fundamentals? I think we all know the fundamentals and DO NOT CARE! This is not a game of fundamentals or technical performance.
The shorts are manipulating this and that is a given but.......they are now bringing the price into an area that will bring other hedge funds into long positions and create that foma we are waiting for....the rip is coming...
Shorts didn't cover. Apes are not here for fundamentals. MOASS is whey we're here. 4 digits is my goal now.

AMC is struggling today but it was expected. Keep buying and holding. Amazon possibly buying the company is even more reason to do so.

"Last Friday AMC closed at $42.8 Today 9/10 (1 less trading day for Labor day) AMC closed at 50.16.That is a 17% jump. Every time the stock gains 10%, the Shorts lose $1b. In 7 days now they have lost $1.75b even when they placed 500m shares in Latin America. Small covering every day for them but no where near where they need to be in order to not go out of business. This is with all the other tactics dark pool, paid bad articles and bashers on every board. Let your mind wander where this could go when it actually squeezes. Have a great weekend my little Apes!"

"Investors in AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. AMC need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Dec 17, 2021 $145.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.MOASS!"

"Very good Twitter video with Gary Gensler. He mentioned retail’s positive engagement over Sm. That he is investigating big actors & hedge funds and looking into dark pools & market structure.And, if, as some mentioned, he is reading our posts. I would like to say that he need look no further than this week in AMC. The shares we are buying are clearly being used against us to manipulate the stock price while we, along with the world are watching this travesty.Also, Bill McIntyre’s SEC recommendation is as valid now as it was in 2000. These hedge fund / market maker’s destroy good companies and cheat investors that are entitled to compensation for the unfair losses. And those abusing or have a history of abuse, should immediately lose their market maker privilege. We hold, despite great losses as we also support a fair & equitable market for all. And this includes small cap companies, like AMC that are unfairly targeted for greed, at the expense of the economy."

Some of you forget there are LAWS around this scenario that FORCES these hedge funds to buy back the shares they borrowed, so the the squeeze is inevitable in my opinion. The hedge funds are just doing everything they can to minimize their losses because it's not just money they will be losing......they'll be losing their clientele as well, and consequently their business. I can only imagine that some of their clients are the type of people you don't want to upset... They tucked themselves and they know it lol, so just continue to hold and enjoy the show they're going to put on!"

"Legitimately similar movement to what $AMC did on its run to $72. 20-30% gains per day, if only PROG  could have the same backing as AMC!"
buy at 47 or 50 or 60 or whatever it will hit over 200+ and the price you get it for has no difference than the one who pay it at 5. jump in the game and enjoy the ride.
Select the best answer:A) Shorts haven't covered.B) Citadel is going bankrupt.C) Short Interest is high.D) All of the above.
"A moment of reality...we might see in the 60s or early 70s tomorrow. It may slide back to the 40s again. For those with thousands of shares like myself, it may seem tempting to sell some off and buy back if it goes lower. I can't emphasize this enough..that is too risky and an irresponsible move that not only contributes to a delay in the squeeze, it also hurts your own individual gains potential. Best to buy more and hold until all shares, FTDs and naked shorts are completely covered.Amc is the #hood"
Once in a lifetime opportunity here folks. 20+ years in the market I've never seen anything like this. Never again will billions of phantom shares be printed with no intention of having to cover them. They couldn't cover at $6 they sure can't cover now! GME / AMC will forever change trading. All these new rules are designed so this can never happen again. Trade wisely
"$HOOD $AMCWOW!!! Something may be brewing with a distribution deal of some kind between AMC and GME... THIS could be interesting...Meanwhile HOOD has become the Titanic, barely staying afloat with holes in its bow... And taking on water. I knew that Citadel couldn't maintain two fronts in their war against Retail Investors... AMC and HOOD... Trying to raise the price at Robin Hood so they can cash in, collect a lot of money to help pay for the impending AMC Squeeze, leaving retail investors holding the bag... Their other front, and one they are losing, is with the 4 million plus Apes at AMC. A HUGE ARMY of investors. They are failing at crashing the AMC share price to $1 like their stooges have claimed in the Media. Citadel could've bought out of this mess at $5/share but got greedy and power hungry. And NOW, just digging the hole deeper for themselves...Hark!!... What is that I hear? Is that the sound of shredding machines coming from the Citadel executive offices?!!Look, brothers and sisters, know one thing: WE ALREADY WON, WE ARE JUST WAITNG FOR THE PRIZE TO BE DELIVERED!!!"

Question - SERIOUSLY is this going to go to $100.
"Not worried. I got into this for the big move, not small day to day gains or movement. I will hold and simply add to my position should this drop below my cost basis. Chart movement does not lie, this stock is walked down almost every single day from 10-12 and then trades sideways most the afternoon. Same song and dance, I will continue to wait."

At the very least, its a takeover target from the tired, older health insurance companies like UHC or countless others.Take your big payout from AMC or GME and roll it over to the next one ready to launch!!!"

"The Apes can't refute these facts. If the Apes respond, notice how they can't refute the points, they just call names 1) The CEO is selling shares2) Members of the Board have already sold shares3) AMC's SEC documents warn investors that the stocks trading is divorced from fundamentals4) The cost to borrow and days to cover is low - That's not conducive to a short squeeze5) The spikes in AMC occurred because of options gamma squeezes. This is not something that happens when the implied vol on options contracts is 100-150%6) AMC was losing money before the pandemic and will be losing money even if revenue recovers to pre=pandemic levels. This is because of the additional high cost debt AMC added during the pandemic. 7) More mid tier content is flowing direct to streaming and bypassing theaters completely 8) The period that theaters have exclusive rights to new films has shrunk from 90 days to 45 days. This will cost theaters ~3-5% of revenue based on historical revenue generation patterns 9) Naked shorting is not happening at the moment. The FTDs are low (you can find this on the SEC website) and the incentive isn't there for market makers given the low cost to borrow and the billions of available shares that can be loaned. 10) AMC is looking to issue additional stock. You can find this disclosure in the company's SEC documents"

"another hit job from the same writer! this guy must be getting paid by the ""shorts"" crowd.SearchWhy AMC, Clover, and Other Meme Stocks Are Tumbling TodayThe notion that groups of individual investors can consistently organize efforts to push stock prices around is starting to crumble. At some point, companies must prove their stock's value. And, at some point, people will want to take profits.￼James Brumley(TMFjbrumley)Sep 8, 2021 at 1:49PMAuthor BioWhat happenedShares of AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC), Skillz (NYSE:SKLZ), and Tonix Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:TNXP) are down 1%, 6.5%, and 5.3% as of 1:30 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, with the fickle meme stock trading crowd reversing recent bullishness. Leading the charge for today's rout, however, is Clover Health Investments (NASDAQ:CLOV), down 12.7% as of mid-session.So whatIf you're looking for the headlines behind the moves, don't bother. There aren't any.As has been the case for the past few months, traders looking for a speculative edge are simply gathering around these stocks in an effort to collectively create the price action they desire, often by creating memes regarding these companies. Such efforts cause incredible price volatility.￼IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Many of these names -- like Clover this week -- have also been recently targeted as short-squeeze candidates. That's not a terribly bad bet right now either, to be fair, in that more than 7% of the outstanding shares of the health insurance company are currently tied up in short trades. That's enough short positions to prospectively spark en masse buying that drives the price sharply higher, if those short-sellers start becoming unnerved by a bit of bullishness. Tuesday's 15% jump for Clover shares didn't do the trick, however, with most of that gain being given back today.Shares of movie theater chain AMC Entertainment aren't really helping the broader bullish effort either. While one would expect this king of all meme stocks to soar following reports of record-breaking Labor Day weekend box office ticket sales, a bit of Tuesday's near-9% gain from AMC shares is also unwinding with Wednesday's1% sell-off. While that's hardly a devastating setback, the failure to follow through on Tuesday's advance is telling in and of itself.Of course, the broad market's sell-off today is also creating a headwind for these well-known meme stocks.Now whatThe advent of meme stock mania (and in particular, organized efforts to spark short squeezes) comes as no real surprise. If you give enough people enough time and the means of doing so, it's reasonable to expect them to capitalize on an opportunity -- including one they must plan out on one of the internet's more popular message boards. A little success on this front early this year prompted the trading crowd to replicate the effort.Regardless of the strategy's previous effectiveness, however, meme stock mania is losing steam. Not only are hedge funds and other managed investment pools now shoring up their risk exposure to short squeezes, traders are also running out of stocks they can push around.They're also running out of other buyers and bullish arguments.See, for most meme stocks to continue their rallies, new buyers must bring new money to the table to purchase shares from traders that have already scooped up the stock and are now looking to lock in a sizable profit. Enough people were willing to take such a swing early in the year when AMC was trading around $2 per share. Now that it's trading at more than $46 per share, however, would-be buyers are considerably less interested. Underscoring this idea is the fact that shares of Tonix Pharmaceuticals and Clover Health have yet to respond to the same rally driving strategies that -- at least for a while -- buoyed AMC stock. In a similar vein, Skillz shares have also stopped responding to the bullish prompts that drove the stock from around $11 per share in November of last year to February's high in excess of $46. They're now back near $11, unable to keep a rally going.There's something of a litmus test for the entire meme stock movement due this afternoon. Another meme stock company, GameStop (NYSE:GME), is slated to report its fiscal second-quarter numbers after today's closing bell rings. The numbers are important. But even more important is whether or not the trading crowd relaying on the web's popular message boards will be able to convince others to start and sustain a rally from GameStop. If it can, other meme stocks like AMC and Clover will remain at least somewhat in play. If it can't, it may well be a sign that the underlying strategy of individual traders targeting one ticker at a time is no longer effective. This in turn may sour most of them from even trying to do so, continuing the conversion of many of these meme names back to more conventionally priced stocks"
Both inflation and AMC SP going boom boom candle this week.
Isn't it funny how you can see the manipulation a mile away. They just have their Algorhythmn machine turned on today and they set it to level the 45 Deg drop off at precisely 12pm and then start a 45 Deg upward climb the rest of the day. Not guaranteed but it usually is correct. #AMC
I love how you can goto any other stock and Top Reactions is current but AMC is weeks and months old. Why would that be???
"I've bought shares ranging from $20 to $50 and not a worry in the world. When in doubt, zoom out. This may take 6 months to play out. Yet, the trade is so easy. Buy on the dips, hold, and relax."
I surely hope we AMC investors can always remember that Yahoo Message Boards has been short cheating us - favoring the short selling hedgies by screwing up this message board month after month - today the messages are 5 months late. It's deliberate. Other boards are not screwed up like this one.
"WOW! How many times today did I hear that this was going to be taken down or it was going to close red or it could even hold $38? Abby, Riaz, Elena, Turd Furgeson and John/Scott/Ghewala; all of you bashers... this is why I don't pay any attention to you."

"Here is a little earnings education for our basher friends. The EPS (earnings per share) is expected to be -.08 compared to -8.41 last year or -.79 the previous quarter this year. That is huge! That is a great earnings report, due to increased revenue. This will drive FOMO buying naturally even without the pending squeeze.AMC is the $hood $bac"
The FTDs are in the millions. Shorts haven’t covered. No one knows amount of synthetic shares. Don’t forget.
"I just did Say voting for AMC. At that time, it averaged 1175 shares per vote. So if there are still 4.1M shareholders…we have about 4.85B shares of AMC bought.We need shareholders to link in share count on this and get it more accurate!Holding long and selling on the moon!"
GENVIRO $DECN TO THE MOON LIKE $AMC
"For all you who did not read the news Here is it. 04:36 AM EDT, 10/01/2021 (MT Newswires) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings(AMC) has exercised an option to repurchase $35 million of its 15% cash/17% payment-in-kind toggle first lien secured notes due 2026, according to a Thursday press release.The total cost to exercise the repurchase option was $41.3 million, including principal and accrued and unpaid interest.As a result of the debt reduction, the movie theater chain said its annual interest cost will be reduced by $5.3 million.Today, we pass 50."
"Paper profits on my current AMC short position: $56,789.00I will perhaps cover at $4.99, but I may hold for zero--delisting.Per word wages as a paid AMC cynic for incessant posts: $10,011.00Profit sharing agreement with Citadel: $16,342.00It is important to understand that a short must make all dividend payments while the position is open. However, AMC pays no dividend, so the carrying costs-- margin interest-- are very minimal. Imagine the cost of a short position in AT&T, which currently pays a hefty dividend yield of 7.7%. Here is an example of a stock you don't want to short because of the very high carrying costs."

APES just sit back and relax. Nothing has changed and the squeeze is still yet to come... Just buy cheap and hold. #AMC Gold Bars!
"As that squeeze happened, and then bleed out, all i could think is that some important people wanted a better average on their short position. After it turned, it just bleed out. Hardly even an attempt at heading back up. When the first squeeze happened, I remember watching it happen. It kicked down doors at every whole dollar. It got knocked down a dollar and came storming back up... Today felt like manipulation."
post squeeze clarity; never investing a penny more into the US markets
Nice rebound across the board. We’ve held up well here in spite of hedge fund efforts to bring us down.

We haven’t seen anything yet. Shorts haven’t covered. They will be forced to. Another day of reverse repo being over leveraged one trillion in borrowing my over 70 counter parties causing MOASS. Margin debt all time high. Correction soon in the markets will bring the squeeze
Ape Nation UNITE!Shorts STILL haven’t covered - buy the dip before we RIP!
I hear we are going back to $70+ soon. I hear an Amazon deal is possible with AMC.

"Yahoo still banning AMC posts, hedgies must still be paying them....."
For those hoping for giant price gains please realize that price action like this is far better. It's holding and setting up support at the $50+ range. You don't want massive spikes and nothing to show for it. A 3%-4% gain on the day is fantastic and the support it sets is even better.

"If AMC is not going to the moon then why yahoo blocking all positive comments, think about it"
"I have preached this idea consistently: $35- is a key inflection point for AMC stock. I never expected we would get there so rapidly. Once we get below $35-, selling volume will accelerate, and AMC is one stock which cannot handle selling pressure without a precipitous drop in the bid side. Liquidity 101 is the course you failed in college. Tomorrow's trading session promises to be extremely exciting. There are but hours to escape this travesty."

"$AMC Bashers have not had a victory since last December when the short selling mafia was getting everyone to sell their shares to bankrupt AMC. Ever since then, they have been trying to get us to sell our shares and what happened? We went from 5 dollars to where we are today and beyond. Yet the bashers continue to push their losing narrative."

They had some interesting insights about AMC on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
20% of AMC's float is short. I'd say thats about $5-6 billion in short positions. This security is a short sellers worst nightmare....Holding Strong!!

10/10 short squeeze rating. Fuel on flames by shorts will billions of synthetics phantom shares IOUs Christmas sale. The monster grows bigger and stronger everyday with word of mouth. Bulls and longs in control
"What's the news causing the selloff? Stocks don't legitimately go down 11% in a day without news driving it. There is no news for AMC, meaning this selloff is likely ILLEGAL manipulation"
Shorts said sell at 33.I didn't and now I'm laughing at them!
Folks could you help us take $ship away from the hedge fund manipulation? $ship is trading 30% below the worth of its assets!

"This is only my thoughts and really does not amount to much. I never chat any other stock other than AMC. I write this for only those who have followed me since AMC was under six dollars. I bought something called PALT the other day at seven zero three price. PALT - Small float. Profitable company. Law suit against big company. Possible takeover target. What's not to like? That was what I scribed. It is a small company, very small float. Getting in and out can be tough. You would not want to own much. It could run above ten this week on any kind of volume. If you get in, make a few points and get out of most of what you own. Keep a small amount in case of a buy out. That is if you buy at all. I do not care. I am not a tout. I am just sharing a small stock with what I think is a small opportunity. Always do your own DD (Due diligence), never rely on others to do your work for you. Nothing good can come from this. On AMC, the MOASS is still in play. Today will be a light day on volume. It is a waiting game on AMC. In my opinion, stay away from options, just own the stock. Think about this longs, or those considering going long, do you think in a week from today APPLE, or TESLA, or MICROSOFT, or PROCTOR AND GAMBLE, or any other big name stock, could double in a week? Probably not. AMC, if it takes off in price, passes mid eighties, would probably trigger the MOASS and go over two hundred very quickly. How many under forty dollar stocks have that potential? I've had my say, happy Columbus Day."
"Keep shorting, you basically stacking more shares to cover. HFs you can NOT close your positions without buying back "
I buy amc From my mamas basement
Got a tax rebate in the post today. Guess what I've spent it on?
$amc dark pool hitting a billion dollars in positive liquidity. Last time it was positive was may 24th. In my opinion. Major move is coming VERY soon!
The manipulation with the stock price is real. The good thing about it is it's cheaper to buy 
This could go to 5$/share and given they haven’t covered I won’t sell a share.
Hedge funds/institutions pay and own news media’s to manipulate the retail investors as pawns for profits. I’m all in AMC. I’m saying no more to blatant manipulation from Dark pools.
AMC is going to erupt. Shorts be very careful. It’s happening.
"Not sure what their psychologists say, but I’m well past fear. I’m into anger now!!! I hope your social media scanning AI picks this up! I’m not selling ONE effin shares until this reaches 5 digits, and I have a lot of shares you need!!!"
"You can tell from EM and other pump and dump Ape reactions that they are way overextended into AMC. My guess is they bought on margin. The entire revenue for movie theaters (including ads and concessions) was 19B at its highest. The average valuation for movie theaters is ~1x EV/sales. That means that Apes have valued AMC as being more valuable than the entire movie theater industry in the US despite having below average industry margins and returns. There also won't be a short squeeze because the cost to borrow is too low, FTDs are not high (implying no naked short selling), and there are millions of shares available to borrow."
"dont buy any option to help citadel hedge, if you can afford buy real share only"
HERE WE COME TO PICK UP APES AT THE 60 THEN 70 THEN HEADING TO 180 THE 260 THEN......NOT FREAKIN SELLING A SINGLE SHARE
October 1st Phase 5 regulations state that the main banks need to have $1tn in order to pass their stress tests. They are MASSIVELY over-leveraged and will NOT meet this requirement. HOLD $AMC & $GME. somebody say SQUEEZE THEM CHEEKS HEDGIES!!!
I predict it will close green today!
Price can drop to $27They still have to cover June FTDThey owe the stock what they lost.. regardless of how much they winning these recent weeks from shorting…
$40-$45 is going to be the next channel that AMC is going to trade in. More pain will be Incoming for the short sellers. I'm very bullish on this stock over the next 90 days.
Been watch the volume at theaters! Down 60% from pre pandemic levels!
