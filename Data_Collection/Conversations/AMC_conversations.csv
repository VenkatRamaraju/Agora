can't even see recent comments. yahoo finance is market manipulated at its finest
"28% short interest on AMC, according to CNBC:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/24/gamestop-surges-30percent-to-lead-meme-stock-rally-in-otherwise-boring-market.html"
As long as someone is telling me to sell I'm going to hold. Simple as that.
"Just how strong is AMC? Simply look at yesterday's trading by shorts and yet we ended up a couple of pennies at days end. Now I will say this do not be alarmed by what appears to be lower volume on a daily basis, remember shorts trading between themselves is going to be much less likely to occur and the drop in volume would actually make you realize how much of the volume we had seen in the past was just that.Date Short percentage Dark Pool percentage2021-06-23 45.7 % 57.5 %I mean we were attacked yesterday based on these numbers and they could not get AMC to budge."
"AMC - HOW CAN THIS STOCK RUN HIGHER? It is easy really. If longs want to see this stock go up HUGE, then you have to force the shorts hand. How can we longs do this? VERY EASY. Go on line, buy a couple tickets to the movie at AMC. If you go, or don't go, it does not matter. The huge surge in sales will FORCE the HF's to cover. If you agree, copy and paste this all over the internet!"
Wonder if I told my lender that I’m not gonna pay back my loans and I’d also like to take additional loans backed by my fake money what they’d say? Shorty’s gotta pay up SOON … HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
"1. The short interest of Volks Wagon when it sqoze to 1000 Euros ($1200 USD) was 10%. The short interest of $AMC is currently 13%.2. There are millions and millions of shorted shares covering tomorrow, most of which are between $58-$60. The higher we can get the price by tomorrows close, the more shares they will have to buy back, resulting in a bigger gamma squeeze. In my opinion, we're going to see a gamma squeeze tomorrow regardless, but the higher we can get the price, the bigger the gamma squeeze. If it's big enough, it will lead to a short squeeze.Stop watching the minute chart. Zoom out and look at daily chart. We are slowly rising even though the Hedge Funds are fighting us and trying to drop the price. There were 2.2 million shares shorted yesterday morning, resulting in the pre market drop. I'm sure they tried the same thing this morning.The question isn't if the squeeze will happen, it's if you're be in on it when it does!!"
Don't sell your shares otherwise this won't squeeze
"Listen it is simple when you look at charts and also look in depth at the options change and how they coincide.AMC is still stair stepping higher every week. We are in a channel between $53.75 and $62 that has now consolidated nicely for the last 2 weeks for the most part. For the last several sessions we have closed in the upper echelon of this channel at $59.40 $60.37 and now $59.26. A majority of the trades over the last 2 sessions when combined occurred at over $60. This is a very bullish pattern as we had 2 small consolidation markers over the channel at above $62.What occurred Friday was a marketwide dump. and once the price was below $60, hedgies were also able to dump the shares they had purchased to hedge the $60 call options. Rather than drive the price down to the low $55 which would have caused even more dumping of hedged shares, AMC fought back and prevented that and closed higher at $59.26.This was the danger we faced with so many options in the money was a potential dump and we not only survived it we beat it.All of this suggests AMC is ready to go forward on Monday and hedgies are all the weaker for it.Now on to the options chain. For the last several months a deep dive into the options chain has show a 55 to 44 ratio in call options to put options. This suggests a somewhat evenly divided chain with hedgies able to mitigate potential losses fairly well.But as we moved into June and look forward at July August September and even further out, Call options are now at a 65% to 35% ratio. Taking it a step further and looking at the $145 calls, more and more are being purchased at costs of 1200 to 1900 per call options. A look over at the PUT chain shows that Puts at a similar cost basis are for the most part not being purchased.The fact that call options are being purchased at 2.5Xs the rate as PUT options is tremendously bullish and the fact that there is hardly any hedging at PUT levels comparable to the $145 call options is an even more bullish signal.Take it for what it is worth but AMC is EXTREMELY EXTREMELY bullish no matter what any shill on this board says and to even remotely think otherwise or to have any ounce of fear is unwarranted.When you look at the growth of the short interest over the past week as compared to previous weeks, shorts are digging a hole so deep, that when this lets go its going to be a disaster for the last few remaining shorts.In my opinion once we break over $60s and start to consolidate again above $62.50 or wherever it may land, there will be some shorts who will start to cover. I do not believe this wee be too far off."

"Maybe we should act like we are getting out, play a little psychology like the smart money, that way they short more synthetic shares thinking we are getting out."
"I can guarantee that a lot of APES! are just like me, a guy who has a working man's job and has been involved in the markets for a time just so he can eventually get by. That ""get by"" has been hijacked a lot in the past 30 years of investing. I have too many sad songs to sing (ONT, NYFX, currently CYDY) terrific companies that are getting or were driven into the ground by the man. AMC is our push back, our revenge!! I bought more today and will tomorrow. APES! stay strong and long and win!"

Amc Gme merge! Omg this is going to be historical!
I'm curious if anyone can explain this for me. let's say all the rumors are accurate and the short position is significantly higher than reported with synthetics etc. let's go on the basis of 2 to 1. if 80% is owned by retail and some institutions let's say 400mil and theres 1 billion shorted shares. how could hf possibly close out their positions?
Good evening apes! Tomorrow should be an exciting day! Looking forward to buying more AMC and not just on the dips. Of course I also Hold every share and have never sold or tried to flip not even one!
POWER GLIDE TO $50 TOMORROW!

There is too much misinformation floating around that is intended to destabilize the Ape Army. Anyone who has seen the Adam Aron interviews on Trey's Trades knows that the CEO is against the hedge funds. The proposed 25M shares will not be used against the Ape Army. Watch the interviews to get a history lesson on how previously authorized shares were used. The silverback is on our side.

"another hit job from the same writer! this guy must be getting paid by the ""shorts"" crowd.SearchWhy AMC, Clover, and Other Meme Stocks Are Tumbling TodayThe notion that groups of individual investors can consistently organize efforts to push stock prices around is starting to crumble. At some point, companies must prove their stock's value. And, at some point, people will want to take profits.￼James Brumley(TMFjbrumley)Sep 8, 2021 at 1:49PMAuthor BioWhat happenedShares of AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE:AMC), Skillz (NYSE:SKLZ), and Tonix Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:TNXP) are down 1%, 6.5%, and 5.3% as of 1:30 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, with the fickle meme stock trading crowd reversing recent bullishness. Leading the charge for today's rout, however, is Clover Health Investments (NASDAQ:CLOV), down 12.7% as of mid-session.So whatIf you're looking for the headlines behind the moves, don't bother. There aren't any.As has been the case for the past few months, traders looking for a speculative edge are simply gathering around these stocks in an effort to collectively create the price action they desire, often by creating memes regarding these companies. Such efforts cause incredible price volatility.￼IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Many of these names -- like Clover this week -- have also been recently targeted as short-squeeze candidates. That's not a terribly bad bet right now either, to be fair, in that more than 7% of the outstanding shares of the health insurance company are currently tied up in short trades. That's enough short positions to prospectively spark en masse buying that drives the price sharply higher, if those short-sellers start becoming unnerved by a bit of bullishness. Tuesday's 15% jump for Clover shares didn't do the trick, however, with most of that gain being given back today.Shares of movie theater chain AMC Entertainment aren't really helping the broader bullish effort either. While one would expect this king of all meme stocks to soar following reports of record-breaking Labor Day weekend box office ticket sales, a bit of Tuesday's near-9% gain from AMC shares is also unwinding with Wednesday's1% sell-off. While that's hardly a devastating setback, the failure to follow through on Tuesday's advance is telling in and of itself.Of course, the broad market's sell-off today is also creating a headwind for these well-known meme stocks.Now whatThe advent of meme stock mania (and in particular, organized efforts to spark short squeezes) comes as no real surprise. If you give enough people enough time and the means of doing so, it's reasonable to expect them to capitalize on an opportunity -- including one they must plan out on one of the internet's more popular message boards. A little success on this front early this year prompted the trading crowd to replicate the effort.Regardless of the strategy's previous effectiveness, however, meme stock mania is losing steam. Not only are hedge funds and other managed investment pools now shoring up their risk exposure to short squeezes, traders are also running out of stocks they can push around.They're also running out of other buyers and bullish arguments.See, for most meme stocks to continue their rallies, new buyers must bring new money to the table to purchase shares from traders that have already scooped up the stock and are now looking to lock in a sizable profit. Enough people were willing to take such a swing early in the year when AMC was trading around $2 per share. Now that it's trading at more than $46 per share, however, would-be buyers are considerably less interested. Underscoring this idea is the fact that shares of Tonix Pharmaceuticals and Clover Health have yet to respond to the same rally driving strategies that -- at least for a while -- buoyed AMC stock. In a similar vein, Skillz shares have also stopped responding to the bullish prompts that drove the stock from around $11 per share in November of last year to February's high in excess of $46. They're now back near $11, unable to keep a rally going.There's something of a litmus test for the entire meme stock movement due this afternoon. Another meme stock company, GameStop (NYSE:GME), is slated to report its fiscal second-quarter numbers after today's closing bell rings. The numbers are important. But even more important is whether or not the trading crowd relaying on the web's popular message boards will be able to convince others to start and sustain a rally from GameStop. If it can, other meme stocks like AMC and Clover will remain at least somewhat in play. If it can't, it may well be a sign that the underlying strategy of individual traders targeting one ticker at a time is no longer effective. This in turn may sour most of them from even trying to do so, continuing the conversion of many of these meme names back to more conventionally priced stocks"
"We will see extraordinary levels, but keep holding for gold because we’re going much higher even then"
What could be Yahoo's intent in manipulating the comment section of AMC stock?
"Time, evidence and data is on our side. Time is our most precious asset like 24 karat gold and class D diamonds"
Just keep buying! And seriously hold! Yesterday was the end of the dip! We can gain 5-15% daily now!
"At $72.62, ALL short positions EVER opened during regular trading hours will be in the red and building losses! Looking forward to seeing that day come!"
"Alright, looks like we can communicate again today after what was a day of some big consolidation at AMC and another day that finished green although by just a hair. 002 kicks into full effect today and a lot of folks thinking it will be a major upheaval in the way we are priced at AMC. I don't expect much of a price increase from 002 if any at all. Once again the watchful SEC will need to become the enforcing SEC and they just do not seem to be enforcing anything at this time so expect more of the same there. Yesterday ortex reported that there are still 91 million short shares(that we know of) that are still to be covered. Shorts still need our shares and we are not selling so they will continue to need our shares. Please do not make them available. The morning looks pretty good for another hold by the apes in this price range. Do not worry about the price hanging around and not running like wildfire every day. To be honest if the price was going up 12% a day I would be more concerned than I am with the heavy support we have shown at these levels All is good at AMC this morning. Today I think is another day of finding that place or item that helps you to relax and just let it go. As we see the price swings are getting larger as we have seen 10% become almost the normal range here for the day. For now do not expect anything different. Again, the squeeze can happen at any minute, it is that close and it is coming. With enough pressure coming today there is a decent (60%) chance we will see a $60+ close today. That is a large mountain to climb with what we have seen this weeks but never underestimate the will of this Ape community. We were censored yesterday, I expect a little retaliation today against the shorts and hedges and the will to drive price up. Enjoy the day all. Higher highs are on the way."
"If you have 60,000 bucks right now and you buy 1000 shares you will be a millionaire it’s that simple so anyone that’s on the fence now is the time to buy this is going to happen hold and become a millionaire"
"Good post if yahoo don't deleteDo y’all not realize that most people hold index funds for years and get a 7-11% return on their investment year over year. Stop saying this day or that day and just hold. If the squeeze comes in November we will literally be able to say we increased our investment in the hundreds to 1000%. So yes while getting rich over night would just be a dream come true, take a step back realize considerable gains can come but stop getting people set up to be disappointed. Hell even if it takes us months to stair step to 1k, 5k whatever the pay off will be well worth it if everyone just keeps their emotions in check. Have belief in the stock and just hold. Not financial advice but this is how I am approaching amc."
Not Leaving!!!Shorts haven’t covered!AMC to Infinity!!!
"Simple question:(Taken from AMC site) “As of June 2nd the number of investors who want to own a part of AMC continues to increase and now stands at approximately 4.1 million. More than 80% of AMC shares are held by a broad base of retail investors with an average holding of around 120 shares.”Now if we own that much of the float and we aren’t selling. How exactly do they plan on buying 100,000,000 shares back they borrowed to short? Sucks to be short right now."
This price action up and down is nothing all manipulation! WE ALL KNOW THIS IS EASILY WORTH 800+ PER SHARE ONCE THE HF COVERS!!!

"Its true, Citadel has paid fed chair Janet Yellen millions in speaker fees. She is bought and paid for. Who knows how many SEC people are also paid off?"

"I have all week, all month, and all year. Holding strong!"
Its easy to keep the price down when they are not routing our buy orders through the exchange. Sending them to the dark pools.
Enjoying the sun. And celebrating another day red or green 420 style knowing shorts are over leveraged and will poop themselves. With billions of synthetics phantom shares IOUs Christmas sale that must be covered

Hmmm those new rules kick in today. Interesting.
This is the power behind AMC. Don't be fooled by media or articles you read. We're winning and it's only the beginning. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VquB2sJNeiI&feature=youtu.be
"On January 27th 2021, AMC stock, one hour into trading, the days volume was already over 500 million shares which was significantly above the stock's 30-day average volume of 86.8 million shares a day. By 4pmET on that day more than 1.1 billion shares had been traded and we have since that day barely reached half that volume ever again. Now add to that, the outstanding share float on January 27th was only 250 million authorized shares. The next day, robinhood and a couple other brokers stopped everyone from buying AMC shares. GME as well. Now ask yourself how could this happen? It couldn't be that people bought the 250 million shares and sold them and bought them and sold them and bought them and sold them and bought them 5 times in the same day? The Stock was hot and on an incredible upswing trading around twenty dollars from a previous day high of 5 dollars. Who would have been selling at that particular time? Like nobody.Could it be that because of what GME was doing at the time (they closed around 350 dollars on that day) people, like me saw a chance for AMC to do something similar and at the price of 5 dollars was worth buying a ton of shares and did just that? I think so. I think there were at least 750 million shares or more sold on that day and this is why hedges could not close their positions even when it came down shortly thereafter to 5 dollars per share. I seriously think that AMC shares were sold out 6 months ago and there are probably 1.5 billion shares out there somewhere. Never made sense to me until finding out about dark pool and their ability to park buy orders. If this is all yrue and there are that money shares out there, we are rich and the hedges should have already been liquidated as they could not possibly cover that amount. Now, since the SEC is giving them such a long leash, they are probably whittling down and trying to cover those shares. Good luck with that. Does anyone know where to see the level 2 buy/sell ratio for AMC on January 27th 2021?"

"Good morning all. After a very nice Monday we received a little bit of a boost via Regulation SHO last evening. Reg SHO gives us a little insight into failures to deliver. Those stocks that were supposed to be purchased but have not been. Well seems AMC Entertainment has made the threshold listing. This listing is compiled and released by the NYSE and a company is listed when FTD are in excess of .005 of the outstanding shares listed for the ticker and have been in an FTD state for the last 5 trading days. This list in many ways allows folks to see how the stock is being ""manipulated"" by short holders. The SEC is aware of this situation, so now we just have to hope they quit just watching and they start enforcing."
Google is buying AMC ....news from Germany after Labor Day the stock will be 74$ !!!
"Just the fact that can manipulate this stock so much and hide the real buy orders is unbelievable. The market is looking very corrupt now that we know what is really going on. Why would anyone invest after knowing all this?We are lucky because we own the float and everyone is holding but I hope other investors in other stocks are taking notice and learning that the odds are so stacked against the retail investor.When they start covering and institutions begin selling, do you think they will let retail gobble up some of those shares? Probably not. If it's going through Citadel, they can just put the buy orders aside and take every share that becomes available. We need to just hold the majority and will will outlast them."
"If you sell, they win. AMC is fundamentally different now then it was before because we Apes own most of the shares. Mute and don't listen to shills. They're seriously not looking out for your best interest. Apes hold strong together."

And it took hard work for people to start up a business from scratch, and with hopes and dreams to make a profit from it, all along with the thoughts of helping out the economy, raising peoples spirits in some sort of way, or even being happy with what they are doing in life without making an impact on their life or wallet. At some point, everybody started out at ZERO $....and some made it big, some barely making it, and some still struggling. The point is you work hard in what you believe in, then somebody or company tries to tear it down for a quick buck! That is not the way it should be, that is not the way we should believe, that is not what we the people of the world should exercise! I would not want that on my conscience! Shorts and Hedges should stop, put themselves in other peoples situation, and think about what they are doing by ruining companies trying, and still trying to make it. They are not only ruining the companies they built, but ruining the peoples lives that actually made it a reality. I have put in what I could in support for #AMC...just because without movie theaters that we grew up with, and enjoyed, we would not have the warmth of sitting by a loved one watching a movie, a first date as a kid, even a first kiss, a place where everybody could be together and laugh, cry, be scared, without being ashamed or ridiculed...because we all were doing it at some point! We even would not have the moving forward technology we have today to watch movies at home if it wasn't for the film industry all together! It makes NO sense to me to ruin a company or lives for what took so long to build...even if mistakes were made and caused problems within their company. It happens...we are only human and we can only learn from it. If it was something I could believe in...this is a stock worth saving! Im in!"
"This is getting very real for AMC!I am excited for the upcoming days and weeks ahead of us. Be sure to read all the way to the end for some exclusive announcements.Lets get started!AMC Stock PredictionLast week I predicted we would be breaking the $30 level of resistance after consolidating in that range all month and it came to fruition!The following day, someone wanted me to make another prediction, LOL. We are now trading in the mid $40s and on our way to $50+."
"Still not selling #AMC, holding until it squeezes!"
Nothing like yesterday but we're still green. No $50 today Investors unless something major happens in power hour.
Why isn’t yahoo posting all the recent comments
AMC is now on the NYSE threshold securities and NOW SHARES CANT be borrowed until this failure to deliver is paid back. They have 7-13 days to pay it back or the position will be automatically closed. THIS IS NOT THE SQUEEZE. THE SQUEEZE IS WHEN ALL THE SYNTHETICS ARE COVERED. Not financial advice.
No matter how today plays out you can expect a gap up on Monday because the new fast and furious box office numbers will be significant. HF and MM know this. They’re will be a bump coming near eod or after market tonight / pre market Monday. Hodl.
If you like money buy and hold like the over 400 institutions long on AMC for the short squeeze. Algorithms are about to push us to $150-200 without the short squeeze with margin calls
We didn’t sale last Friday and we won’t sale today… if they could drop this stock to 40$ they would already had done it. Just be patient to get paid that’s all I’ll say today.
"If you hold it, he will squeeze."
0 shares to borrow gentlemen—let's show these hedge funds who they've been messing with!
Hedge funds/institutions pay and own news media’s to manipulate the retail investors as pawns for profits. I’m all in AMC. I’m saying no more to blatant manipulation from Dark pools.

F9' has highest opening weekend of the pandemic with $70 million box office haulShorts can eat the fundamentals as well 
"On Wednesday, market makers, which are also DTCC clearing members, will have to tighten up their short-selling belts. Because their available capital will be contrasted more frequently with member deposits, their ability to maintain massive short positions is slated to be crippled.Current State of the AMC/GME SagaIn case you haven’t yet grasped the basics of short selling, here is a brief recap of basic indicators (we’ll get to the breaking news afterward). The foremost among them is the short interest percentage, referring to the number of shorted shares divided by outstanding shares.According to Ortex data, as of today, both AMC and GME stocks have relatively high estimated short interests, AMC at 13.64% and GME at 14.54% (17% on May 28) of free float.Above 10% is considered high, while above 20% is extremely high, which translates to more investors thinking the stock price will fall. Of course, bullish short squeezers tend to use this metric as an opportunity to buy the dip, counting on the stock to rebound.AMC and GME price moves in 2021, source: TradingViewRegarding the free float, also called public float, it refers to the number of shares available for public trading by using the following formula:Free float = outstanding shares – restricted shares – closely-held sharesWith these two metrics in mind, we arrive at the short-interest ratio, as the number of shorted shares divided by average daily trading volume. This is one of the key factors that enter the consideration when to take short positions. The higher it is, the longer it would take to repurchase the borrowed shares, which is why it is commonly known as the days-to-cover ratio.A ratio above 10 would indicate a negative outlook on the stock. As of May 28 report, AMC’s short ratio was 0.7 with 20.3 million shares sold short, while GME’s short ratio was at 1, with 11.97 million shares sold short. Meaning, they were both bullish indicators."
SAD this yahoo board is compromised (censored) working with the hedge funds against amc...that's ok...we shall prevail...
"Today is great buy volume, just wait for tomorrow will be even bigger!"
"What I like is these so called smart moneys guys are to smart to realize that, we are not going any where until every single short synthetic shares is covered. So with that being said I love the consolidation and the slow grind upward, that means they are adding more synthetic shares. I can not express how I greatly appreciate what these HF shorting are doing. This will be a once in a life time event for us."
58.3% short percentage yesterday. 54.4% day before. Yet AMC is holding up incredibly well in the upper $50's. Someone is desperate.
"What if their in their own game , Buying stocks to gain on their own short squeeze more than they would shorting."

Buy and hold amc will reach 4 or 5 digits
Why is this conversation room so messed up? I can't use it because all the messages are so badly out of chronological order. I wonder if Yahoo did this on purpose?
Coming soon
I just bought 500 shares of AMC. Any chance this will go GREEN today? Just asking !
"AMC Entertainment – Shares of the movie theater chain rebounded 7.7% to around $36 apiece after shedding 15% in the previous session. The price of the meme stock has been cut in half from its all-time high of $72.62 in early June. The shares have fallen about 37% in July alone amid a pullback in speculative names.

I love this chat. Stock goes $60 to $59. And all these bashers are out in full force.
"There needs to be meaningful consequences, not teeny fines. 2014, Citadel was fined $800,000 for irregularities in its trading practices between March 18, 2010, and Jan. 8, 2013 In 2017, Citadel was fined $22 million by the SEC for misleading clients regarding the way it priced trades.[65]In 2018, Citadel was forced by the SEC to pay $3.5 million over violations stemming from incorrect reporting for nearly 80 million trades from 2012 to 2016.[66]In 2018, Bloomberg reported that 40% of Robinhood's revenues were derived from selling customer orders to firms such as Citadel Securities and Two Sigma Securities.[67]In January 2020, Citadel paid a 670 million-yuan ($97 million) settlement for alleged trading irregularities dating from 2015.[68]Citadel Securities was fined $700,000 by FINRA in July 2020 for trading ahead of customer orders.[69] They delayed certain equity orders from clients to buy or sell shares while continuing to trade the same stocks in its own account as part of its market-making activities, according to FINRA.In 2020, Citadel Securities was censured by FINRA a total of 19 times for a variety of misconduct, including failing to close failure-to-deliver positions, naked short selling, inaccurate reporting of short sale indicators, executing trades during circuit-breaker halts, and failing to offer its clients best prices on the bid-ask spread.[70]On March 25, 2021, Citadel agreed to a censure by FINRA and a $275,000 fine for improperly reporting nearly 500,000 Treasury transactions between 2017 and 2019, revealing a systemic failure in Citadel's compliance systems."
I must say $AMC is a real winner! Pretty much all day long I am watching other stocks and they are just going down and being pumped and dumped or manipulated with short attacks but amc is different because it has strong ape support to combat some of the manipulation but other stocks dont seem to have the same type of protection.
"I cannot envision how cheerful my life is correct now since I met the best broker on message, his systems and procedure is so justifiable and uncommon yea, I began exchanging with 1BTC presently I'm acquiring 4BTC week by week, Mrs Stella I'm always cheerful and appreciative for everything you do folks you can contact her on Telegram @Stellalamar42 and have an euphoric future"
They are tricking ppl to sell their stocks guys! Don’t buy the fake news! Becareful of market manipulator￼s.
When we rocket soon slingshotting to another galaxy make sure to cover. And buy now before chasing $100+

"Indicators shows a 75% chance, increasing from 71%, of closing over $59 today. Depending on mid day trading."
Yo bashers! Retail Investors own the float so we own the price when the G.M.O.A.S.S. happens. So that means we own you. Get it bashers.
"They short em we buy em. We own them, they don’t!"
"Big thing happening within YF, a product manager named Steve Hsu that worked on the message boards at YF tweeted a confirmation that they are vetting and censoring any damaging posts to Citadel and other short sellers/hedge fund managers that bet against AMC.Check it out before it is removed. I can't link to it, keeps getting auto deleted."
Short interest nearly 20%…we OWN the float…shorty’s sweatin’ BIGTIME!HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
"The recent daily price actions reminds me of when we couldn't break $14. We went down all the way to around $9 and the back and forth between $12. The point is, they are not going to make this easy. Bad news for those who are impatient. But good news for those who are patient cos look at how this stock is consolidating beautifully. We are going to the moon at the appointed time. Only God is infinite. HFs will eventually run out of ammo. They are not infinite, and that is a fact."
"$AMC Ent Holdg There seems to be a lot of confusion so let me clear something up, AMC is a buy and hold until MONDAY, if AMC closes above $9 tomorrow all the calls expire in the money and market makers will be forced to buy shares back at a premium, therefore on monday the price would rocket officially starting the AMC short squeeze, copy and paste this so people know how long to buy and hold for!"
"Like many of you, I've spent an inoridinate amount of time lately running scenarios and pondering ways to retain and bolster as much of my soon-to-be-realized gains on AMC for years to come. Not financial advice but like I'm sure many, I plan to park a good chunk of cash in dividend stocks and low-load funds that spin off yearly yields of 4 and 5 percent or greater. You can figure this at any investment or yield percentage, but if you are new to investing and thinking conservatively, consider this...$1,000,000 reinvested @ 4.5% = $45,000 annual dividend income. :)"
"Was away for a week - see we are holding in very very nicely… for the last week didnt really check in on AMC but was not worried - I am holding long till this thing hits $1,000 per share… just a matter of time… Very bad press for Citadell that is negatively affecting other institutions too- rumour is that they are gonna put the screws to Citadell, and perhaps replace some of the MM’s who manage the after and pre-trade… the small volume is where you see obvious manipulation to set the stage for the days trades… you can’t have a stock trade up 10% on massive volume then in AH retract a full 15% on no volume. All the AH does is set the price for dark pool - that’s why the very next day it takes retail buying of about 10 mil shares to push the price back up - manipulation up the wazoo"
ORTEX:Increased borrowing in $AMC - So far today we have seen 7 times as many shares borrowed as returned.
the whole US market is corrupt AF! This is not just AMC but the whole market. Never gonna touch US based scam stocks again after this
Yahoo fix your comment board. It works on every other ticker symbol I've checked.
"Even Citadel going long on AMC and bought shares, look it up…. It’s there on fintel lol….. they know the long term value once it squeezes."
The emaciated husk that is Sean Williams put out an amusing article this morning. the evil retail investors are ganging up and manipulating the market while the poor hedge funds suffer unjustly.
I have this very strong sense that we will experience a squeeze week!
"Folks let’s finish strong today. We done a good job so far consolidating in the 50-60s. Low volume means that people are not selling. Soon we will break through 60s and go higher and higher, consolidation after consolidation. We own AMC, not the HFs. More we hold, faster the margin call for hedgies. Let’s goooo!!!!!! "
Seriously all jokes aside you need to buy asap. This is not going to happen again at such affordable prices. ~$300 a share by septembers end.
"Guys, stick to $AMC. Citadel is pumping volume into other stocks to make it seem as they are squeezing. And putting extra false selling pressure. Please be smart, Citadel is now across all social platforms. Stick to $AMC. Stay strong!"
F9 has already vastly shattered previous post pandemic box office sales. Weekend isnt even over. Next week weekend is holiday weekend and F9 will continue to smash revenue outlook! Let's Go AMC. #ApeNation
"When every media outlet is going out of their way to talk down your investment, yet you're holding the highest performing stock YTD, you're on to something special."
I’ll hold this for years if that’s what it takes this is pretty much a guaranteed retiring plan so I’ll enjoy the little time left I have being a working man. $AMC
"Stop the predictions. Stop writing directly to Hedge Funds on this chat. Theyre not reading what you wrote. Its wasting space.Stop writing to bashers as well. Use your energy wisely. Just my opinion.This chat is for facts about what is happening with AMC. Or moral boosting.Me, I could care less about being emotional one way or another taking money from hedge funds. I am not veangeful, at all. They have their job to do. I have mine. It happens to be basically the same job yet mine is not illegal. Mine is worthy. I want to help me and my family have a better life. Just like all us APES.Keep buying, holding, and waiting.PeaceHODL"
..Beautiful AMC Shares! ....loading up Big Time on the DIPS!!
"I actually think Y’all worry too much instead of taking action, I’m no expert in trading but I’ve made what I could never imagine, my investment with Mr darren and his team was and still is 1000% worth it. I keep counting my profit weekly and monthly"
"Billions of synthetics phantom shares IOUs Christmas sale must be covered. Break out, gama squeeze then margin calls short squeeze."
I am very happy with the HF and the shorters holding out. I am a working man. d I collect my pay checks it continues to give me the opportunity to increase my share counts. I will keep buying on every opportunity that I have. Making best use of my investment in AMC as time drags along. Thanks you HF and Short sellers. You are making my dream come true.
Today will be day 16 of the reverse repo being over leveraged. Over one trillion in borrowing still. Which means America defaulting is coming. With margin calls soon after
"They have algorithms to short and sell off our emotions. They have television media. They have FUD articles and hit pieces. They have social media with bots and paid bashers. They pay for all this and pay billions in fees on top of it.They laughed at us then 1 went out of business. Now news outlets not affiliated with Hedges are listening and SEC kind of adjusting rules (we will see).All we pay for is our shares and costs nothing to hold. If this thing go sideways to $50 or dips because of shorting, I don't care, I am here all the way. I will add. They can cover some but not all. No way they can cover naked/synthetic. Boom.I will hold past $100 just to shake hands looking for a quick buck if that's all they want. I easily see $125 but I want min $500. Do we get there? Who knows. But we have to hold if we want to. (Volkswagon hold) Diamond hands to $1000 and beyond.I am Ape.That's just me. Do your own."
All other stock conversations are working............just AMC not showing current messages........Yahoo owned by Citadel LLC
"Class action law-suits coming to a theater near you. Rumor has it that the share price these Hedgies will have to buy back those synthetic shares will make us all rich , there’s billions of of these fake shares they will need to cover ."
"adding more shares everyday. rest of my portfolio isn’t doing great, almost don’t care since AMC will   hedgies "
3500 shares holding with diamond hands. Lets do this!!!
So could it be that shares are drying up? Paper hands and Day traders keep handing over their shares and Retail investors are buying and holding them. I am sure that by now we own more than 80% of the float. I guess we should keep buying up all the shares until 100 %.
eternals will be shown exclusively in movie theaters before heading to disney+
"Do not forget that during the squeeze..It will take weeks for the shorts to cover..During this time,hedge funds who are friends with citadel will sell their bulk shares and tank it to make you to sell..This is emotional manipulations..Don't fall for it.."
"We blame HF’s for this hardcore manipulation, but the reality is that the entire market is rigged, top to bottom, it’s a money making machine out of the average retail investor."

"96,678 calls in the money, 160,893 puts out of the money. We need to hold above $12, they will bring everything today, be prepared.Do not rely on short interest numbers alone. Like ,when looking at 1 minute chart, the whole story can be seen when you zoom out. The media and bots have increased the attacks. At this point they will risk prison rather then go bankrupt, to get your shares. #AMC #AMCtothemoon"
"Having stock like AMC/GME/MMAT, fearless life for share hoders who know what is the value of stock...this 3 company will be major stock in market where millions will be benefited"
This is a revolution for financial freedom
Motley is attempting to compare AMC to Cinemac. Pumping it as a soon to be short squeeze. He of course forgot to mention that Citadel owns the majority of that company and we don’t CARE if it’s shorted and goes bankrupt. Citadel is heavily invested in it. It’s a distraction in hopes that people buy the stock so citadel can offset its AMC losses. We like the AMC stock!
"Wow, another great day. The lowest volume I’ve seen in probably the last 30 days and the price only dropped $1.39. If the volume keeps getting lower without a drop in price then the days to cover ratio increases for the shorts and the higher the days to cover ratio is, the faster the squeeze happens"
Funny how they can take a stock down this much even if retail owns the float
"There is something very wrong here. If yahoo is blocking messages that either favor/don't favor specific companies, then this could be considered to violate SEC trading laws. - could someone with connections to trey/matt/another big youtuber get them to talk about this? imagine if someone filed a lawsuit on Yahoo for this"
"Robinhood Financial LLC has agreed to pay nearly $70 million to resolve sweeping regulatory allegations that the brokerage misled customers, approved ineligible traders for risky strategies and didn't supervise technology that failed and locked millions out of trading"
We need a short squeeze likes of $AMC
"Selling stock short without having located stock for delivery at settlement. This activity would violate Regulation SHO, except for short sales by market makers engaged in bona fide market making. Market makers engaged in bona fide market making do not have to locate stock before selling short, because they need to be able to provide liquidity. However, market makers are not excepted from Regulation SHO’s close-out and pre-borrow requirements."
"This was a fake short squeeze initiated by Citadel. DO NOT SELL, this stock can go much much higher if we HODL. All MEME stocks were up today, hedge funds are desperate for you to liquidate your postions, DO NOT SELL"
"My crypto investments are tanking and I love it. It means the shorts are liquidating to cover AMC. Once we max squeeze, the perfect scenario is buying more crypto when low at large volume. Millions to make more millions.Amc is the #hood"
"https://www.nyse.com/regulation/threshold-securitiesAMC since yesterday ""These settlement failures may be indicative of naked short selling, although they may also be caused by benign factors, such as administrative errors."""
Why are people selling this off after hours. Over 2 million customers visiting AMC Theaters in a 4 day span is bullish not bearish.

Should I get a home equity loan for more shares? Then buy 15 more houses after the squeeze?
We own the outstanding float. A modest chunk and stay the course
"This month, next month, following month, amc holders looking like:"
"Look, I know most, if not all of you, that are AMC apes/junkies could care less about a company's fundamentals, but just a thought, because a CFO that I once worked for and highly respected had a favorite saying: ""Cash is King"" In 2017, 2018 and 2019 (before the pandemic) AMC produced, on average, about $550 million in cash flow from operations and those 3 years were reasonably good years. Lets, just for the heck of it, jack that up by 50% to $750 million in cash flow from operations. With 500+ million shares now outstanding that figure to be about $1.50/share or about 3.3% return. Better that your average savings account, but WAY less cash than hundreds, if not thousands, of good, solid companies are generating."
"It’s funny if you go to Reddit there are pages and pages of amazing DD,Then you check out this board and the bashers DD is ,This stock is bad! "
Surely if it goes down today with amc acquiring building and building new theatres all over which means the business is getting stronger thanks to all of us investors that have help and no thanks to HFs who tried to drive amc under if it goes down today it will b the most transparent day of manipulation ever so here's to a beautiful green chart
Fomo will drive us triple digits EOW..
"SPREAD THE WORD !!!!!!!! SPREAD THE WORD .......PLEASE READ BELOW PEEPS FRICKEN MOOOOON..........HERE IS THE MOST EXCITING PART: It is said that if a stock is on the threshold securities list for 13 days, they will literally be forced to cover ALL of those FTD positions. Remember, it takes 5 days to be listed (which AMC was on Friday), so it has now been 7 days because of the fact that it was still listed on Monday and Tuesday.Edit: Here is the link to where it says if a stock is on the threshold securities list for 13 consecutive days, they must be forced to cover all FTD positions. Look at the bottom of the first big paragraph under Rule 204: https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htmI can tell you one thing… if, AMC stays on this threshold list for 13 days… it is BOOM BOOM CANDLES time."
do you know why a lot of shills and bashers are here ? Because AMC hodlers are winning!!!
"In case you're fairly new to AMC and aren't aware of this most unusual situation, AMC's share price actually doubled on June 2. That is when a gap resulted from the HOD on June 1 being $33.53, and the LOD on June 2 being $35.59.Since this gap was filled today, I have a strong feeling that AMC's share price is about to take off quickly towards uncharted territory. Does anyone here agree with me?"
"Apes - please follow these orders:1) Hold, hold hold do not sell2) Buy more if you can..average up3) get friends and family to do likewise, use social media in this effort to create a mania4) Do NOT believe any FUD or fall for hedge fund distractionsIf you do these things there will be a huge wealth transfer for ALL. It only works when retail apes unite and act together. All of our money have to be combined to take on the powerful big money. That simple."
Guaranteed Citadel is working with other Hedge Funds to transfer the money to them before they allow our sales to take place during the squeeze. Manipulation to the end but they'll never be able to steal it all completely.

"You would be wrong to call this movement failed if you only looked at:- The regulation it's forced upon the financial sector- The amount of new retail investors it's brought to the table, who read all of DD, and leave no stone un-turned in their effort to educate themselves on financial dealings- The lawsuits and settlements that have been borne in the wake of itYou'd be a BIG TIME wrong to call this movement a failure if you continue to ignore the above while also ignoring the following:- The stock is up 2500% since the start of the year. - Apes will continue to be a market presence going forward.Seriously, if you're still getting paid to bash this ticker, it's time to ask your boss for a raise before he has to close up shop permanently."
FINALLY THE CEO is doing...THE RIGHT THING!25 MILLION SHARES - WITHDRAWN!!!!Lovin AA now!
Amc been #1 for months...And yahoo never trends it...haha!Another sign that we GOT A WINNA!!

"Just saw Shang-Chi movie at my local AMC theatre. Movie is excellent, very entertaining, and free popcorn always tastes extra good. To the Moon!!"
Yahoo deleting my post so let me make it short and to the point-002 forces hedgie to short on the open market rather than the massive amounts they cannot afford in the dark pools- So short interests rises and quickly at that.- Market makers love what they see and will drive the price up to squeeze the new short positions in the 57-70 range. This is when volume increases and then FOMO. - when we pass through this range the squeeze begins as shares available to short on the market become limited and there is no choice but to close their positions.- this does not include synthetic shares and the FTDs being ignored.- we can not assign a date but with rising short interest the sharks will come out to okay and drive AMC upwards and soon. -
F9 movie numbers are just the start to big summer movie going experiences... Can you say Catalyst?

"Yahoo AMC chat server, too much positive sentiment"
With this short interest we should go up $1 per half hour
624 million dark pool shares shorted data is finally coming out
Fact: the shorts havent covered I will buy and hold until they doNothing else mattersIf they keep shorting trying to knock the price dwn the price will just go higher because they still have to buy back shares and have added more.
Top Bullish Charts | September 2021  https://chart-analysis.tools/Bullish-Charts
"AMC withdrew it's S-3. that means the 25 M shares are off the table. Some other poster said that this was done to limit the HFs shorting the debt and he gave an example. Below is what is on the SC site about S-3s. My interpretation is that there are not enough votes for the authorization of the 25M shares and it was pulled.What is an S-3? Off SEC site.> SEC Form S-3 is a regulatory filing that provides simplified reporting for issuers of registered securities.> An S-3 filing is utilized when a company wishes to raise capital, usually as a secondary offering after an initial public offering has already occurred.> In order to utilize the simplified process, firms must first meet a certain set of eligibility criteria.Notice what is says in the second bullet point, so it seems that the 25 M shares is off the table."

Don't listen to the FUD. All these other post and news articles about other squeezes are only distractions. Cinemark is the most recent one. The HF's are in on it and employing media to setup honeypots to get you to sell your AMC.

"Latest news, shills level 3 have switched over to the 43 million shares now, which as we know AMC could use anytime and as stated by the Ceo, What's wrong with amc setting themselves up to take a bit when this squeezes, there more than enough considering the amount of synthetic shares out there.

"DawnyesterdayReplied to a reaction$AMC conversationIf GME and AMC were to squeeze, think about the tax revenue the government will gain. Hedge funds continuously find ways to reduce their taxable income and shelter their money in accounts overseas. You cannot rely on the top 1% to sustain the market and pretend that there has not been an economic collapse with those families that do not fit in that category. It all looks ‘pretty’ on paper and in the news. Once the dust settles from the stimulus payments and we return to what could be defined as normal, poverty is going to increase and if you do not believe any of this, I have no problem taking your information and we could discuss within the next year.The wealth gap continues to widen and this will only continue.We continue to hear that a squeeze could collapse the market. This means that the wealthy will suffer the most. Most of the lower socioeconomic class are not investing in stocks. However, the government will experience a significant windfall in tax revenue. This redistribution of wealth will ultimately lead to more investments in the market, to support those stocks that have been crushed as a result of hedge funds short attacks. The squeeze will enable those investors who lacked access to medically necessary health care to now have the financial means to seek medical care for themselves and their families, new businesses would be opened as those with the desire but lacking in cash, would now have the ability to pursue their business interests, and families, that have been struggling for a long time in the 'land that claims to have opportunity for all' may now have the money to invest in homes, cars and education.THEY CAN CALL IT ANYTHING THEY WANT, BUT A COLLAPSE IS NOT WHAT I SEE."

"AMC short sellers lose $1.5 Billion after 134% rally! - June 2, 2021 by Tyger FitzpatrickNet losses surpass $1.5 Billion for AMC short sellersThe continued momentum in AMC stock has seen short sellers lose upwards of $1.5 Billion this week according to Ortex data. Interestingly, as of Friday last week across the board of AMC, GME and SPCE short sellers have accumulated a net loss of over $1.8 Billion. It seems AMC’s popularity amongst retail investors may be attributed to its recent performance gaining 219% this month alone. We will see if these losses will continue into this week as retail investors continue to push AMC stock higher.https://youth-investment-group.com/2021/06/02/amc-short-sellers-lose-1-3-billion-after-117-rally/"
"How soon will we see an AMC short squeeze? Retail investors all want to know. Is it this week? Will it be next week? Or, are we looking at a longer game here? Here’s what we know.Key Highlights • AMC closed at $58.11 on June 28th. The stock has fundamentally surged despite short sellers attacking it. AMC Entertainment is set up for a short squeeze. • The perfect time to buy AMC stock is when the market is red, or what we refer to as on ‘discount’. AMC is looking bullish though, red days might just be over. • AMC entertainment continues to be the most heavily shorted stock in the market. • AMC’s short borrow fee continues to increase."
"It is easy to hold when your position is at loss.. real test will come when prior to earnings day if $AMC is trading @7/8/9/10 and you see green and you see scary messages on earnings and you sell. This will give shorts opportunity to cover. Just hold or if it falls below 5/4 after ER just add more. If we hold until after ER, squeeze is imminent."

"APES: The plan was simple, Citadel bet against AMC hoping for bankruptcy. Make lots of money and if the company went bankrupt, Citadel was off of the hook paying capital gains taxes. Citadel had/has borrowed so many stocks that if AMC would have lost, no stocks to return, thus keeping all of the profit and the person who loaned them the shares, would have lost everything. Citadel bought 3 million Cinemark shares on the long. NOW MF is working hard at convincing readers today that Cinemark has been shorted as much as AMC. This is a LIE. Citadel hopes the naïve will start buying Cinemark, so the stock price increases, they can sell off at a profit and then try and cover their AMC losses. Citadel NEEDED AMC to go bankrupt, so that Cinemark was the only major theater chain standing. Cinemark has half of the theaters that AMC does. Had AMC gone bankrupt, Citadel would have scooped up vacant AMC theaters, and sold them to Cinemark, so they could expand their visibility across the world. This is WHY WE HODL!"

It is observable and undeniable that the price DOES NOT significantly decline throughout the day.

The short squeeze hasn’t even begun. A beautiful September ahead for diamond hands
"Some have been asking what ""$8.01"" is, and how a price represented a day in AMC history. Well, sit back and take in a story...Friday, Feb 26th, 2021. There were near 12,000 calls closing in the money above $8 on that Friday, which would have been a huge boon for the A-P-E-S. The hedgies had fortified behind walls of puts and our intelligence showed they were armed with computer-algorithm-driven trading that could belt out 100 shares/second of hot lead...Opening bell: Wave after wave of gorilla gang stormed in slapping the ask at $.10 and $.20 over, but every time the price stayed below $8... Stim checks and life savings were hurled at the hedgie defenses. Chimpanzees, orangutans and silverbacks stood shoulder to shoulder scooping up every banana in their path - all around brave a-p-e-s lay strewn about the battlefield, fully tapped out. We would make steps forward, but then price action would drop back down. Many thought that by 3pm we had taken the big Eight, but we were beaten back with little more funds to continue the assault. By 3:45pm, with the final countdown ticking, It looked hopeless...In the few remaining minutes of the trading day, with price hovering at $7.98, the AMC moon platoon mustered all they had and mounted a ferocious charge. Seconds before the *clang* of closing bell - one that would ultimately spell the beginning of the end of the vile hedgies, or could just as easily have shattered many retail investors' finances - there was a massive surge of volume. A silverback whale fell from the sky in the same moment that every remaining a-p-e fired all they had left --- the ticker rolled over, and as the toll of the closing bell rang out, our tickers showed... $8---.0---1If you were there that day, it was most likely the largest communal effort of your life - to buy and hodl for yourself alongside millions of others fighting the evil of the world according to their own plan - no financial advice.If you were there that day, it was YOUR shares that put us over.In the next battle, it will be YOUR shares that means the difference between Moon and exploding on the launchpad.Ever since that day, we have been on the way to victory over the hedgies, and 8-0-1 has been our battlecry.Repost AMC Holders"
"For the current market cap of AMC you construct, brand new, every movie theater in the US. But we're hoping and praying for a short squeeze when the company needs to issue more shares and the cost to borrow is low and the availability of lendable shares is high. Don't be Sheeple. Think for yourself."
"Are you starting to grow impatient with AMC because you're not seeing it boom to $100.00 already like everyone's been saying would happen?Are you thinking about just selling a block of your position to put into anotherstock that's been hot lately? I've got news for you... no stock has been hotter than AMC. Look now at the 3 month chart and what are long term trend lines showing you? Look at the 50 day term and the 200 day and look at the past year for gosh sake.Now go mow the yard or feed your dog or what-ever else you've been neglecting doing because you're so caught up in AMC that you're startingto miss other important things to do. That's right, just let AMC sit and simmer on the stove and the aroma will fill the air and soon others will want tohave some and when it's ready to serve everyone will feast on it. GO LONGS..!"

"I do heavy heavy technicals and all I got to say is price between 52 and 61 doesnt matter at all. Its a channel of consolidation and with a heavy rise in the short interest to almost 19% (most likely A LOT higher). Once we break out of this channel, its going to be a heavy heavy increase unless the shorts cover (which they definitely should) which would trigger the MOASS! We are sitting extremely pretty folks! Hold tight, buy more if you can afford to, dont buy into the fake media or basher posts per usual and relax! We’re chilling while they paying heavy interest rates every day"
Share price does not reflect true supply and demand. Realistically this should be at 5x the price if you remove dark pool. Buy orders routed via darkpool and sell orders dumped on NYSE. We know the game they are playing and they got caught. This has to stop!

"To those of you who are new. You may have felt compelled to sell your shares @$57.99 this morning and are now regretting it. This is a buy and hold situation. This is nothing but an unmitigated attack by the shorts, those who are shorting the stock, in the hope you will sell your shares. To do so would give them legitimacy, as they are selling synthetic shares. I am not a financial advisor, but do have a vested interest in AMC, recently becoming a share holder. This isn't about the volatility in the share price, but rather a cause, forcing those who have, for years, beaten down those without a voice. We are their collective voices, as we fight for both ourselves, as with them. The end goal is to have the shorters cover5 their positions, at which time the price of the shares will rise substantially, there technically being no limit on how high they could conceivably go. So, in conclusion, buy shares when the price dips and hold!"

Hello AMC army.......greetings from the past....... our stock is probably $1500 wphlen you read this message.
"Please have patience folks, we have the shares locked up and they can only try to scare you into selling. Short sellers and their associates will try all the tricks in the book in order to get you to sell, but here is why you shouldn’t:1. Low volume - ladder attacks stopped which inflated numbers anyway. 2. FOMO investors and day traders exited so the volatility is less, that is in part why this stock went down on low volume.3. Institutional buyers will be rebalancing their portfolios this week, a positive for this upcoming week, but also a negative for last week as the institutions want to purchase this at the lowest price point. Look at the valuation of AMC, it is 4x what it was at the end of last month.4. Lastly, if you are wondering who has sold and who has not sold….just know that this stock price has formed a new base because of everyone holding shares and not selling, that is why the stock held at over $50 this week!I appreciate the stock holders of AMC, I know we call ourselves Part of the Ape community. Call it what you will, I’m just glad to be part of that group. Stay safe, stay humble, and as always, stay healthy!

"“The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that it fined Robinhood $57 million and ordered the online brokerage to pay approximately $12.6 million in restitution, plus interest, to thousands of customers for a total settlement of $70 million.”This is exactly what we are fighting for… victory for the retail investor."
"28 years old here and having a great year. Full time job since 19 years old, bought a pre construction house about 7 years ago that has now appreciated a couple hundred grand, made $40,000.00 profit on Aphria, and have bought in close to 1000 shares around the $12 per share average here. Still going to hold until the squeeze. I know a good opportunity when I see one. In the world of crooked manipulation only made to help the rich. You need to make smart decisions. This is seriously the play right now. Lots of money will be made for those who stick around and we’re not talking $100 a share. Even if you get cold feet and sell early I’d imagine that would around the $140 per share mark. But being completely conservative.. $400-$1000 is going to come really quickly"

Kenny G and Michael B made a deal to punch back on Elon M by shorting Tesla and the ""meme stocks"" and crypto. As announced by Burry last week. I could be wrong of course but i have this idea. And the feeling we have Elon M. on our side."
Every time AMC is about to go there's some stock that comes out of nowhere and starts getting everybody to sell and Chase. today that stock is ETFR. This manipulation is getting a little much
"As of 5/28 AMC's short borrow fee rate was 7.65%. ... In order for an AMC short squeeze to happen, retail investors will need to continue buying the stock and drive up this short borrow fee. Unfortunately for shorts, an AMC short squeeze is inevitable. Retail investors are not giving up. So hold buy the dips and hold hold hold See you all on the moon "
"so on weekends apparently people with no monetary interest in AMC take it upon themselves to, in their spare time, give investors in the stock warnings of it going down in an attempt to save them from themselves, Yep sounds reasonable. about as reasonable as that guy giving out free candy if you just get in the van, but what other intent could they have?"
We’re not leaving. I’m buying more this month. This is very cheap. I miss the synthetics phantom shares IOUs Christmas sale
"Shorts got bent over, and thrusted with a dry one. It onlyGets worse for shortys after today.MOASS on its way"
Current price at 56.28 AMC is still over $3.25 above Friday's low of $52.97 and almost$2.00 above yesterday's low. Congrats to all APES..!
Almost 3000 shares I’m holding this is probably the only chance I’m going to get to make it big. I can see why people are trying to get us to sale. AMC will be massive

"Repost from Mr wolf, very important message : “Listen to me very carefully as I cannot stress this enough. PM and AH action is when the big money has the most control and manipulation over the share price. The only reason this was held down today is because they blocked out millions of investors from buying. Short positions have went up here drastically which means they are banking on a crash but if you as an individual investor, hold together with many other like minded investors.. we can not lose. Keep fighting the good fight. Cheers. $GME $NAKD $SNDL $AMC and many more”"
Holding strong!
With DTCC capital rules changing the shirts will likely close out some short positions incrementally — I see buying pressure the next four weeks bringing amc to mid to high sixties

This is a gold mine. The biggest opportunity in the market ever. Buy now or chase massive gains at $100+
"Nice today looking strong and has regained the lead after that horrible manipulation yesterday. Great job to those of you buying and holding through all this manipulation. We buy we hold and we wait for the shorts to cover and trigger massive squeezes. We dont need price predictions, we dont need chart analysis, and we done need fundamentals we just need to keep it simple and wait for moass which can happen at any moment."
"Those elected to protect working people in DC have no plans to stop the hedge fund activity because they rely on the wall street system for their personal wealth and re-election campaigns. Let's face it, they want us divided, yet, here we are, a perfect example of working together to gain individual financial freedom. With me, I don't want gov giveaways; just a fair opportunity to gain ground though investing. I'm confident we'll win this one but look at who's against us and who looks away. As Pacino said in his role in Scarface: ""its okay."" Anyway, I added 45 this morning .to my 6 month bag and plan to walk away a fairly rich dude. Best to all who HOLDS"
repost: StockroverRemember in January 25th GME went from 20$ to 340$? I rode that ride and I know exactly how this is going to be with AMC. You will see this will drop to 30's and may be to high 20's and then Kaboom the blast happens...You will see your SP will climb to 3 digits and may be 4 digits as AMC is better than GME to reach to 4 digits..... Right now it's shaking the weak hands.. Many times I thought of selling my 1800 GME shares early January when it kept going sideways and had I sold I would have never made this much profit. I sold half of GME @ 245$ to buy AMC. The HF's and Shorts did the same thing then spreading FUD. The lesson I learnt was to avoid listening to negative posts.. All I can say is to hang tight and HODL strong to your AMC Stock. Im not a Financial advisor but I have enough experience to know the pattern HF's are planning. Good Luck!!
"When you think about AMC holding the line between $55 and $58 for days on end, enduring the short selling onslaught, if I was a hedgie, I would be shaking in my boots right about now"
"yawn. I am an APE... been here for ages. Nothing makes the HF's giggle more than you others predicting the squeeze. It will happen when it happens. Just hodl, relax... Do your job or read a book. Stop pretending to be the amazing Kreskin."
"Shorts have not covered.Shorts need 10x the float the cover.We own the float.Dont forget what we’ve been through since january.

"Sharing a draft about $AMC synthetic shares. While $AMC share price has been suppressed in last few days, we just had the announcement today about $AMC share counts. The news release shows an image which all of us have recently been talking about, and it is basically consistent with what we thought.I am sharing a simple summary that may help to draw a clear and simple picture based on public data.- 501,780,240 shares outstanding as of June 2, 2021- approximately 4.1 million1 individual shareholders eligible to vote at the upcoming Shareholder Meeting- More than 80% of AMC shares are held by a broad base of retail investors with an average holding of around 120 shares. Shares held by retail investors ~ 80% x 501,780,240 ~ 401,424,192- As of June 9th, 2021 from a top brokerage firm: Institutional Stock Ownership 12.6% Institutional Mutual Fund Ownership 10.4% Mutual Fund Ownership 3.2% Insider Ownership 6.5% Other 67.4% Total of institution ownership: 12.6% + 10.4% + 3.2% = 26.2% Total of the rest excluding individual retail investors: 26.2% + 6.5% = 32.7% Equivalent number of shares covered by record excluding shares from individual owners: 32.7% x 501,780,240 = -164,082,138 shares Shares needed to cover the records: -63.72M = 501.78M - 401.42M - 164.08M- Synthetic shares: total number of synthetic shares: Z naked shorts: X naked call contracts: Y other naked shares: W Z = X + Y + W Short interest: Assuming 21% SI which is about 100.4M shares Minimum number of synthetic shares from public records: 100.4M - 63.72M ~ 37M (assume all 63.72M shares were still amid transactions, this is very unlikely) Hidden number of synthetic shares: U: a lot discussions in forums estimate that this number is huge, its estimation could be more than 1B. Here are the cases we may basically have for synthetic shares:* The worst case: all 63.72M shares were overlapped with shorted shares (very unlikely), then synthetic shares are about 37M = 100.4M - 63.72M.* The best case: none of 63.72M shares is overlapped with shorted shares (very likely or very closely), then synthetic shares are about 164M = 100.4M + 63.72M.* The super best case: large number of hidden synthetic shares (very likely), then synthetic shares are much more than 164M* Conclusion with high probability: Minimum number of synthetic shares 164M (known) + multiples of 164M (estimated)[Bottom line]: 164M or MUCH MUCH MORE synthetic shares will have to be covered by real shares, most of these shares need to be from individual investors. Hope this post can be helpful to some of you to understand the current picture of $AMC. Data shows us that the time is getting closer. The current price volatility is just a part of the process. The ride is still going forwards while it may not be as easy as some of you thought. We know we are on the way up and will go much further. GLTL."

"NOT Financial ADVICEFor all of the new baby apes. I know a lot of you have questions, and I thought it would be helpful to provide you with some overall context to understand the significance of the movement you just joined.Here’s the cliff note version. Covid hit last March and a couple of big hedge funds concocted a plan to drive AMC into bankruptcy by “shorting” it and make a ton of money in the process. You “short” a company when you think the value of the stock is going to go down. When the country locked down and AMC closed their doors and their revenue literally went to $0 overnight, it was a no brainer play for the hedge funds. So they started borrowing millions and millions of shares from brokers and sold them “short” at the market price at the time, and they pocketed the cash from the sale. The idea is that the stock price will drop, you can buy them back later at a lower price, and then return the borrowed shares to the broker and keep the difference. If the company goes bankrupt, the stock goes to $0 and they don’t have to buy anything back at all and keep everything. This is what they were banking on. They’ve done this to company after company over the years, and they saw this as a sure thing as any. Well a bunch of people on Reddit (affectionately known as “Apes”) noticed they were trying to drive AMC, GameStop and many other retail and mortar stores into bankruptcy, and banded together to buy up all the available shares, driving up the share price. This resulted in the mini squeeze in January. But Apes didnt sell after that. And the hedge funds didn’t cover their short positions either (I.e. buy back the millions of shares they had borrowed and sold short). The Apes kept buying and buying, and holding and holding, and once the real shares were all bought up, the hedge funds doubled, tripled and quadrupled down on their short position and started making synthetic shares (IOUs) and selling those shares into the market trying to drive the price down. When the price dropped, instead of selling like the hedge funds wanted them to, Apes said “thank you very much for the discount” and kept buying more and holding. Nobody has sold for the past 5 months since the movement really got started in January, and more and more people are jumping in and adding more everyday. Now because of all of the synthetic IOU shares the hedge funds have created to keep shorting AMC, us Apes likely own more way more shares than are actually supposed to exist (as much as 6x-8x by some estimates). But real or synthetic, each share the hedge funds sold short is a liability on their books that must be bought back in order to close out their position. They literally have hundreds of millions of shares, possibly billions, to buy back, and we own them all. They have to buy them back eventually, and every day that the borrowed short shares are still on loan, the hedge funds are paying interest to the brokers they borrowed them from. Meanwhile it costs us nothing to hold. Things started to come to a head a couple weeks ago because the interest rate on the borrowed shares was reported to be as high as 250% (1-2% is normal for your average stock), so the hedge funds are collectively paying hundreds of millions of dollars every day just to hold their position, and a lot of them are starting to miss the payments and margin calls could be coming very soon. That’s when the fun starts. At that point, the broker forces them to buy back all of the hundreds of millions of shares they have borrowed and sold short, because the broker doesn’t want the hedge funds’ recklessness to fall onto them. And remember, the Apes own all the shares and aren’t selling. The hedge funds can only buy a share for what an Ape is willing to sell it for, and us Apes really love our shares. Once the margin calls start, the computers just start buying back all of the shares at the best available price no matter what that price may be. They all have to be bought back. Everything must be settled. And if the cheapest price an ape is willing to sell for is 1,000, or 10,000 or 100,000, well then that’s what the hedge funds will be forced to buy the borrowed shares back for in order to close out their position. Apes are going to hold and hold and hold driving up the price further and further to make the hedge funds bleed as much as possible until they are inevitably forced to buy back their millions of shares. They will need to buy our shares, and we set the price. And remember, it costs us nothing to hold. This movement has been building for the past 5 months, but you just heard about it yesterday. One thing Apes don’t do is set dates for the squeeze. Nobody knows when it will happen, all we know for sure is that the math says it’s inevitable as long as we hold."
After market hedge will cover so Im loading up now
"AMC investors:Hedge funds and paid shills have underestimated the AMC investors currently holding the stock. Hedge funds arrogance and the reliance on algorithms have not helped hedge funds to achieve their goal(s) and this is why paid shills are still a heavy presence here on the AMC thread, as well as the HOOD thread. This battle is still ongoing with hedge funds believing they can continue to illegally naked short and to 'park buy orders' in the order flow process while dumping 'sell' orders on the open market, with the hope that investors, seeing a small spike' will get bored of the continuous 'ups and downs' of the stock and be motivated to sell. I cannot provide a date on the expected squeeze but can tell you that patience will reward. We are waiting on any one of the potential catalysts to propel this stock to new highs and there are some major economic events expected to impact the markets and those events will most likely impact AMC in a positive manner. Remember, AMC IS BACKED BY BILLIONS OF SYNTHETIC SHARES. While I worry about my positions in other stocks, I do not worry about AMC. THE QUESTION IS NOT 'IF' A SQUEEZE WILL OCCUR, IT IS 'WHEN' AND ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT IT IS INEVITABLE!!!"
"every time I ever think about selling, I remind myself how these institutions were to big to fail and then ask myself would my ""essential "" self get that treatment...no. I've been broke, so that doesn't change. I hodl for every family who lost their home in 2008. I hodl for anyone who was rejected a loan from the very bank that took our money to bail them out. I hodl for fairness, PDT regulations are just another example of the wealthy marginalized the working class. I hodl for my wife, son and daughter. I hodl for you. Have a great weekend and remember the two things you can't replace because money comes and goes ....Time and Family. Much love Ape Nation/Family."
"https://fintel.io/so/us/amc It's More, much more, $5000 is the whisper number, the amount it's trading for in dark pool."
I will be buying another 100 shares today and will continue to HODL until we reach at least $10k/share. Outrageous you say...to be hodling for $10k/share. I say what's outrageous and also unconscionable is the behavior of the Hedge Funds by creating synthetic shares of AMC and setting up naked short positions which are impossible to cover. The actions of the Hedge Funds has led us to a point where $10k/share is reasonable. This is not financial advice. I just like the stock.
"Well I look at today as a huge success for AMC. We were not pushed around by shorts, and when we were knocked down a bit we climbed right back.This was an absolutely beautiful day of consolidation at the upper levels of our channel of $53.75 to $63.Short sellers borrowed over 12 million shares per Ortex and returned 11 million. They did not make much money. They did succeed in lowering the IV in the options chain which again may work against them as lower options prices will attract new money.Shorts continue to double down without attempting to cover any of the previous shorting. So while this looks like it was a stagnant day, today was a huge success.Perhaps tomorrow we see more consolidation, and that will stand to make us stronger and make the push north even larger.There could be gamma squeezes on the horizon as we see how options chain plays out. $60s may have to be hedged for if we can put enough pressure there, $65 would absolutely have to be hedged for.The shorts margin for error is getting slimmer by the day. We need our buyers to come on strong tomorrow because even the least of solid buying pressure will likely be more than shorts can handle."
"Futures recovering from the Fed spooking it on Friday (which triggered the selling of AMC near end of day). A huge Bullish Ascending Triangle formation is almost complete, predicting a massive spike in the stock price by today or Tuesday. Shorts are about to get creamed. Once the stock price makes a new all time high over the mid $70s, EVERY SINGLE short will be under water. We'll see panic covering like we haven't seen before. Their only options are: cover high or cover higher.While apes are buying and holding, to gain more shares, once the stock rallies really high on any given week, sell covered calls a few % above the high share price. You'll get good money for it. Turn around and buy more shares of AMC with it. Keep doing this weekly and you will have dozens of times more shares than you originally started with in a few months. Who doesn't want free AMC shares???? Plus buying more shares ensures the stock price can be pushed above $1,000+. Let's do this apes. Play smart, and get that free money. Vicious positive feedback, self-sustaining loop. AMC will be the most epic short squeeze in the history of the stock market.https://photos.app.goo.gl/6PCMTagGSyhxRke56"
"does anyone else find it strange that volume is way, way up but price doesn't reflect that?"
"Markets tumbling are probably making shorts skittish. If they feel the trend could continue over the next few days, drying up liquidity we could see some break ranks and start to cover while the price is somewhat low."
"Shorties were talking big when they saw a 4% drop in AH, but it changes very fast with low volume.Im used to holding for long, because $AMC thaught me well."
Wait until we break $48 then $72 then we GAMA squeeze margin call short squeeze
"The Failure to Deliver. I truly wonder if they haven’t been paid because hedge funds cannot pay them? Not that they don’t want to, but they can’t because of the billions in losses. Thoughts?"
"After $AMC reached ATH, today it's taking a break at $47.91. This is actually a great ending of this amazing week of $AMC. In fact, all data is pointing to a stronger uprun storm in upcoming weeks. Today's closing is way above old ATH, we know that* all open short positions before this week are deeply trapped, * more than 18M shares need to be delivered for the ITM calls expiring today, * potentially more than 10M shares are needed for next week call option delivery assuming price will go above 50 next Friday. This number can be way bigger if next Friday closing is much higher. In addition to what we have already known about $AMC in last few months, let's simply put together the followings to see what the current picture of $AMC is:* After 20M new shares going into the market, we can still stand at today's closing, way above old ATH, amazingly strong. * More importantly, the first 8.5M shares had almost no power to bring price down, and price recovered quickly after the second 11.5M shares out.* Today's closing was heavily suppressed to handle today's option contracts - this move was actually expected.* There will be no more new shares out to the market this year (according to news release). So the other side can no longer have this level of power by easily accessing to a huge number of shares within a week/days.And more1. All shorts before this week are trapped because today's closing is way above old ATH.2. Shorts receiving margin calls will have to buy-to-cover that will trigger short squeeze.3. Short squeeze will drive price higher to trigger gamma squeeze.4. Here (2) and (3) will keep pushing each other to drive price higher and higher.5. FOMO will bring more longs into play and drive price higher while price is rising up.6. Longs will buy more to take this unique opportunity.7. More foreign investors may join in like what happened in India and Korea.8. Shares available to short are drying out, so the other side will have less and less power to drive price down. We had a great week, but don't be surprised if you see FUD around this weekend. The above give us more than enough confidence to stay calm and relax on this weekend; the best for longs is to do so, enjoy the weekend and come back to the ride next Monday. Hold strong, buy the dip within capacity of spending and risk taking. We know that we are on the way up. GLTL."

Look at the number of Call Options for Friday. Wow. Already over 300k iin the money. Huge day tomorrow and the day after and the day after. Love it.
MOASS IMMINENTChad Beynon is an analyst from McQuarie and did a recent hit piece on AMC. Beynon’s success rate is only 64% and likely was compensated financially from hedge Funds to spread FUD on AMC. This stock is about the naked shorting that the Hedge Funds are doing and the MOASS that will happen because they have to cover all the synthetic shares they created. Plain and simple. Hold and you will make money when the squeeze happens.
Citadel is also in United Kingdom’ and Ireland CCEU and EUCC and all kinds of eye brows should be up remember Goldman sax just did a huge reverse repo with bank in england / lots of jpmorgan jane street and black rock are all working together to screw retailers and the US markets LOL
"-----AMC IMPORTANT COMMUNITY INFO-----As some of you know, I have been a part of this story since the beginning. I have made many posts and done my own DD accurately. Though I have been quiet for a while (due to work) let me stay this, and it applies to apes new (who got in at $70) and old (apes who got in at $3). We only got to where we are now because we were patient. We went from $18 to $5 and held. These pull backs and consolidation are part of a pattern and at the end of that pattern is always a major rip. So if it takes a few weeks of consolidation or dips so be it. The rips happen when you least expect it. My second point is the community.We have been invested in this mentally and physically long enough to understand what is going on. We have come together for a reason, we are made up of the common folk, united globally to take back what is owed to us. don't let them take this opportunity away from you, from me, from your neighbor or from someone across the world. Its the only weapon they have left and its the oldest and simplest weapon in the book... Divide and conquer...When you have interns from institutions working to spread FUD on chat rooms and false DD then that should only strengthen your conviction in AMC and that institutions are getting desperate...SO what is my point...No more infighting (not that I have seen much). No more uneasiness (and I speak from experience) about the day to day price action. No more stress because we all know how this story ends and its beautiful and meaningful. Waiting truly pays off (I again speak from experience) Love you all. To those of you who are uncertain. I'm up enough to buy a house in full and I got in originally at $18 back in January so imagine how long I had to wait. your time will come. I am holding for you and more importantly for our powerful unification of the common folk. This is going to happen when you least expect it... So why not not walls tree where is hurts and get rich off it at the same time? Regardless, much love and spread that love thought the community!-K(not financial advice, just my opinions and experience. please dont take advice from someone who eats crayons and only looks up and down before crossing the street)please spread this message on whatever social media you feel like, I know yahoo is deleting everything..."
"Getting paid in a couple of days. Guess what. Buying more AMC.. Increasing my number of share every possible opportunity I am given as the squeeze lingers on. My profit opportunity further increases with time.. Very,very happy sitting and waiting for that check to clear."
"It is all a matter of perspective and interpreting the exact same data and analyzing the exact same facts. Let's look at the data. Today, according to Ortex, roughly 9 million shares were borrowed and shorted at a roughly 500 million dollar cost. The HFs combined half a billion dollars, built a nuclear bomb, and threw it at the ape community, and the damage was a mere 6% drop. In other words, my massive gain that's been in deep green since 13 dollars, was reduced by 6%. This is true of anyone who bought at 60 dollars or lower. Now, with these additional 9 million shares that were borrowed today, we are left with far fewer shares to borrow and short tomorrow. The utilization rate is at about 94% or so. You check Ortex. This means that in a day, or at most 2, there won't be any more shares available to borrow and short this stock, and the allowable shares would carry a significant borrowing cost. Yes, do to market dynamics, some longs existing, some other HFs selling, there will still be some shorting, but that would be very small compared to today's 9 million shares. Keep in mind that these new shares shorted is another huge block of shares that need to be covered at some point, and adds more burden to the shorts.Given the above facts, what is a sensible conclusion? What would a reasonable person (not biased by their long or short position) would conclude? I say the most sensible observations are as follows: 1) given their best attempt to short massive shares, the damage is only in single digits (6% in this case); 2) sooner or later, most of the shares are exhausted and won't be available to short, therefore the HFs won't have this weapon against us; 3) nothing significant changed about the ape community and the fact that they own 80+% of the shares, and still not selling; 4) We are not the ones with a huge potential margin calls hanging over our heads, which means the ape community is under no pressure, tangible or psychological to get out of their positions. All in all, we are in an excellent position and I have repeatedly made that in a little more than three weeks, the HFs along with media desperately try every dirty trick under the sun, yet can't get the stock to fall from 50s. I admit that so far they have been effective at keeping us at bay near low 60s. But the ape community is like a river that will eventually find its way through any barrier, by creating little cracks and then suddenly breaking the entire barrier very violently. We've made these cracks by touching low 60s a few times, and next time we knock, it won't be to create another crack, but the break that barrier violently to get to 70s, 80s, 100s, and so on. I am confident in my position because data backs my arguments. If AMC drops to teens and single digits before a massive short squeeze, I will admit defeat. Plain and simple. But there is almost zero chance of that happening, as there is not an iota of logical reason whatsoever why AMC continues to persist in the 50s THREE weeks after it's initial rise, if not for an impending massive short squeeze due to our great ape community that continues to hodl. I have been in the market for a long time, have been long, short, done options, and survived the 2008 crash. I have NEVER EVER held on to a position like I am holding on to AMC. There is a reason for that."

"Do not despair, do not sell you shares, do not give in to their tactics, and never ever give up a good fight. A stock cannot continue to go down and down and down, indefinitely, just as it cannot continue to go up and up and up. The underlying facts that shorts have to cover sooner or later has not changed. The fact that any major covering would lead to a squeeze has not changed. The best shorts can hope is to scare people to give up their shares. Remember that shorts continued to short at 60s, at 50s and at 40s. They are up from those positions, and as soon as they cover those, the stock will go up. They are still massively down from their earlier shorts which constitute majority of the reported short shares. Furthermore, just like you and I know that the squeeze will happen sooner or later, so do hedge funds, and there are many hedge funds that see these values as good buying opportunities. Last time the stock dropped from 50s down to 38, it bounced 30 percent and hit a high of 48. This time it dropped to 33ish, and already back up by 2 bucks. Above is my opinion and not financial advice. You do what is good for you. I am holding and not scared of these dirty tactics."
If you subtract 200M short shares from the float what does that put this stocks fundamental value at? Id say 200+ maybe 500?

"AMC investors. I KNOW THIS SEEMS LIKE IT HAS GONE ON FOREVER AND YES, IT DEFINITELY HAS BEEN TOO LONG. This stock should have squeezed already but hedge funds have continued to double down and borrow more shares that they never buy back. At times, we thought SEC would step in, At times, we thought DTCs new rules would level the playing field but we are in this battle and we are going to win, as long as we hold. I HAVE SAID THIS MORE THAN ONE TIME BUT WILL SAY THIS AGAIN. Hedge funds are looking to get as many investors to sell as they possibly can. They have borrowed shares in the millions daily without ever buying them back but yet, the SEC does not appear to be stepping in. EVERY ACTION HAS A CONSQUENCE and things change daily. Do you honestly believe that hedge funds can continue to short indefinitely without ANY IMPACT TO BANKS, AND OTHER AREAS OF THE MARKET. HEDGE FUNDS ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY POSSIBLY CAN TO WRESTLE SHARES FROM WEAK HANDS AS THIS SQUEEZE IS INEVITABLE BUT IF THEY CAN MINIMIZE THE IMPACT ON THE MARKET, THEY ARE GOING TO TRY. Why hasn't the SEC stepped in? Is this not impacting the market as a whole? -- of course it is, hedge funds have shorted the Russell index, they have shorted the market to instill fear and cause a massive sell-off in order to get Investors to sell AMC and GME. Do not think for a minute that the SEC really does not know what is going on and do not think that they have not discussed a plan with Citadel and other hedge funds. Even those groups which did not truly understand the illegal activities of some of these hedge funds, now have an understanding of what is going on in the market. Do not believe any financial institution that pretends they do not know what is going on and those who spend considerable amount of money bashing one stock when there are thousands of publicly-traded companies. Hedge funds and their paid shills have been spending millions in resources for months now. THEIR DESPERATION IS OBVIOUS. They know the squeeze is inevitable and they know the only way out is through you and many others. THEY NEED THE MASSES TO SELL AND IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS THROUGH THE HUNDREDS OF PAID SHILLS THAT THEY HAVE 'DEPLOYED' TO THE AMC BATTLE, then they are going to do what they can to motivate some weak hands to sell in order to soften the blow. BUY AND HOLD, IF AFFORDABLE TO DO SO. FOR TD AMERITRADE MEMBERS, YOU MIGHT WISH TO CHANGE YOUR ORDER FLOW PREFERENCES FROM THE DEFAULT TO THE IEX EXCHANGE. IEX, this is the Investors Exchange, it is a fair, simple and transparent stock exchange dedicated to investor and issuer protection."
"Latest New on AMC from Reuters....i see $100 soon any day....also watch us live on youtube with the Masked investor...REUTERSUPDATE 1-Retail traders account for 10% of U.S. stock trading volume - Morgan Stanley06/30/2021 6:53:20 AM(Adds dollar value of trades, Europe data)By Thyagaraju AdinarayanLONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - Retail investors currently account for roughly 10% of daily trading volume on the Russell 3000, the broadest U.S. stocks index, after peaking at 15% in September as lockdown boredom and extra savings triggered interest in stock markets, Morgan Stanley said on Wednesday.The retail frenzy from last summer carried over into 2021 with so-called ""meme stocks"" like GameStop and AMC Entertainment rapidly soaring more than 1,000 percent, leaving professional traders perplexed.The average daily trading volume on the Russell 3000 index over the last five days was $380 billion, according to Refinitiv data, meaning individual traders contributed around $38 billion a day.European retail investors on the other hand make up a 5% share of total market volume, Euronext recently said.Morgan Stanley says the phenomenon has prompted many questions from its clients about how to effectively estimate retail activity.""We find that retail investors tend to prefer companies in sectors they are likely to be familiar with as consumers, such as consumer discretionary, communication services, and technology,"" the U.S. investment bank said in a note.Applying its own methodologies, Morgan Stanley found that over the five-year period from July 2016 to June 2021, stocks with high retail participation continued to outperform stocks with low retail participation over the subsequent one month.The bank's number crunching also highlighted that these traders have bifurcated quality preference, with greatest activity in high quality and junk names.Meta Material, formerly Torchlight Energy, was the latest name to see huge speculative bets by small individual traders. Clover Health Investments and Koss Corp were other names that made headlines on a retail trading frenzy.(Reporting by Thyagaraju Adinarayan; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)Refinitiv logo  Refinitiv 2021.

Why would we even sell one share."

"Big money plays in AMC on Friday. $600k worth of call options were made in the last 12 minutes of trading on Friday. On Sunday, a 200% margin requirement has been put in place when shorting stocks, meaning that Hedge Funds need double the amount of collateral in order to short AMC. This will make a margin call happen much much faster. Now we're seeing higher volume in the pre market than we have seen in weeks. This could be a life changing week. Thanks to all of my fellow apes that have been BUYING AND HOLDING!"

"Hey Apes.....There are about 100M (legal) shares on loan. I did some calculations to come up with the realistic AMC SP when all the (legal) shares are returned. My calculations for the (legal) shares on loan when returned (first). Here it goes:1). AMC share price jumped from $35 to $72 with 30M (legal) shares returned on June 2nd. 2). If 60M (legal) shares on loan are returned, AMC SP should be about $109.3). If 90M (legal) shares on loan are returned, AMC SP should be about $146.4). If all 100M (legal) shares on loan are returned, AMC SP should be about $158.30....... I estimated there are about 3B synthetic shares (My estimate is low). Wes Christian thinks 9B to 26B synthetic shares. There may be more. I will provide my calculations for AMC SP based on my 3B synthetic shares created, 9B and 26B synthetic shares. 5). If 3B synthetic shares are returned (buy back/covered), AMC SP should be about $7,200.6). If 9B synthetic shares are covered, AMC SP should be about $21,600.7). If 26B synthetic shares are covered, AMC SP should be about $62,208.We will find out the numbers of synthetic shares when Chad & Wes count them. I believe there will be FOMO when AMC SP starts to run from $100. There are probably many paper hands that will jump in once we short squeeze starts. The HIGH of AMC SP might be higher than $62,208 due to other variables (FOMO, Gamma Squeeze, more than 26B synthetic shares, etc). The MOASS will happen. Short HFs/MMs can only delayed the inevitable. It will come sooner or later. I am HODL""ING & BUYING until these GREED/CORRUPTED SHORT HFs cover. These are only my research and opinions. Do your own research before investing."

We consist of farmers, truck drivers, waitresses, oil field workers and the list goes on. We ‘s will not give up our shares. This is the best chance we have ever had and probably ever will have at paying off our mortgage’s and creating financial freedom. So keep putting it off and shorting it as long as you will. In the meantime we will keep recruiting more apes into our community. Your algorithm in your computers can not give you insight of our desire to achieve a dream that no one here ever thought possible. So we apes will continue our quest to ￼￼￼￼end your constant threat and end your manipulation of a market that was designed to fill your pockets while we would continue to work jobs that barely will keep our heads above water. ￼We will continue to hold and tell friends and neighbors about our movement. They will each bring with them a few dollars here and there, in some cases much more and continue to buy up the synthetic shares that you make available. We are not going away, you will not break our spirt. We will continue to hodl, which you know, cost us nothing. Our army grows stronger every day, while your bottom line goes further in the red. We can wait, after all what will change in our life’s if this doesn’t happen? Nothing, we will lose￼ some money, but overall our lives will remain the same. However if we win our world would change dramatically. So we will continue to hold. So continue to play your games with this stock.

I have not looked at this as of yet but will provide information in a later post https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc.htm#SR-NSCC-2021-005The Minimum Required Fund Deposit As part of its market risk management strategy, NSCC manages its credit exposure to Members by determining the appropriate Required Fund Deposits to the Clearing Fund and monitoring its sufficiency, as provided for in the Rules.4 The Required Fund Deposit serves as each Member’s margin. The objective of a Member’s Required Fund Deposit is to mitigate potential losses to NSCC associated with liquidation of the Member’s portfolio in the event NSCC ceases to act for that Member (hereinafter referred to as a “default”).5 The aggregate of all Members’ Required Fund Deposits, together with certain other deposits required under the Rules, constitutes the Clearing Fund of NSCC, which it would access, among other instances, should a defaulting Member’s own Required Fund Deposit be insufficient to satisfy losses to NSCC caused by the liquidation of that Member’s portfolio. Pursuant to the Rules, each Member’s Required Fund Deposit amount consists of a number of applicable components, each of which is calculated to address specific risks faced by NSCC, as identified within Procedure XV.6 Currently, each Member is required to maintain a minimum Required Fund Deposit amount of $10,000.7 If a Member’s Required Fund Deposit, as calculated by Procedure XV, is less than $10,000 on a given day, NSCC requires a deposit to bring the Member’s Required Fund Deposit up to $10,000. The first 40% of a Member’s Required Fund Deposit, but no less than the minimum Required Fund Deposit amount of $10,000, is required to be in cash.8 NSCC’s margining methodologies are designed to mitigate market, liquidity and other risks. NSCC regularly assesses its margining methodologies to evaluate whether margin levels are commensurate with the particular risk attributes of each relevant product, portfolio, and market. In connection with such regular reviews, NSCC has determined that there are circumstances where the current minimum Required Fund Deposit amount is insufficient to manage NSCC’s risk in the event of an abrupt or sudden increase in a Member’s activity.SR-NSCC-2021-005"

"Morning to all, today we might test some higher numbers again, so word of Advice: Try your best to not get too excited until we break just around that 82 wall. If we play it cool we're less likely to activate an emotional dump detected by the algoritms. Keep on about your day and do what you normally do as if nothing happened. (not financial advice.)"
The shorts can't stop this machine. They will try! We just keep buying the dips and hold for gold. Amc is the #hood
Retail investor own 80% of AMC that why jeff bozzzzzo cant buy AMC in order to bring share price down
Board is still broken. This means AMC is probably going nuclear.
"I love many things, but one thing I love the most is this stock."
Not sure about other investors but I find it entertaining to see all of these paid shills. The idea that they believe they are being smart and that no one has caught on to why they are trolling a message board for which they have no connection is funny and sad at the same time. It is sad that they are being paid per post by the guy who throws them a turkey at thanksgiving and gives them an 'AMC' gift card at Christmas while asking them to his 'illegal bidding' so that he can remain in hiding and plan his next illegal attack on AMC
How long should I hold? Can AMC reach 1k?
"hedge funds are trying their hardest to short ladder $AMC. Just hold your stock, buy more if you can afford to! Check out real time trade stats by googling: ""Nasdaq AMC real time trades"" and you'll see all the trade orders are 100 share volumes every millisecond. These are desperate hedge funds trading their stocks back and forth for a lower and lower price, driving the price down. The price drop means absolutely nothing AS LONG AS EVERYONE IS HOLDING, this will explode! https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amc/latest-real-time-trades"
Who is been holding since January with me and been adding more shares regardless price up and down?I am
This period of consolidation is GOOD & very healthy. It’s happened before every major RIP we’ve had and just strengthens our position. HOLD LONG & STRONG & you WILL be rewarded!!!
"When AMC does pop with gamma squeezes right before the major major squeeze afterwards ,you decide to sell early.if you make this decision you are betting that the shorts can bring down this price afterwards. Simply by looking at AMC’s yearly charts I could not risk selling to early, because when this thing begins to pop it could and can take entirely week or two weeks to play out the biggest squeeze!"
Bulls and longs are in control. George W cup and handle bull flag with breakout imminent. Time to cover shorts
"This post has been deleted every time. AMC investors: I was hoping for feedback from someone who is familiar with the IEX. If youhave Td Ameritrade, go to 'My Profile' , then 'General', then 'Direct routing' select edit, then check box and accept/submit, then go into trades and buy AMC, and select 'Additional Details', then 'Routing' in the drop down list, select IEX which changes 'order flow preferences'MY QUESTION TO ANYONE WHO CAN ANSWER IS: can this stop Citadel and the others from routing our orders through the Dark Pools?If yes, can someone provide the Pros and Cons of changing order flow preferences."
Tommmorow we need to show these cheating A-wipies who owns this stock- we need some massive buying pressure tommrow - lets get a 50% gains- remeber we own this float
I've got a question for you. When there aren't any shares of AMC left to purchase what will happen?
"The most important thing for us to do is buy what we can and hold what we have. Ape army strong today and for as long as it takes until they pay, and pay and pay. We own this."
strong day today
We only know how to buy and hold. Massive upside coming bringing financial freedom and traveling the most beautiful places on earth
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Thetraderguide.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
"Let us refer to AMC Stocktwits, a message board which functions, quite unlike Yahoo. Observe the extreme bullish sentiment on AMC. You can note 30 to 1 net favorable comments generally characterized by statements such as, ""$1000 AMC coming!"" I translate absurd mob love to tulip mania. I don't want to attend any AMC theater where someone screams ""Fire!"" You will then witness the apes trample over one another as they scramble for the narrow exit door. I also do not want to be a member of any club which would have me as a member. I have a full tilt level 10 sell signal on AMC common shares. Let's get ready to rumble. Copious ape blood will flow in the gutter. Dark red."
Same action as yesterday I guess 3-5% gain to finished. Awaiting the day we get a 100-200% gain day
"Is there any hope left for Hedge Fund companies shorting AMC?***Retail Investors own the outstanding float. Hedge Fund companies are blatantly manipulating AMC with naked short selling which means massive upside is coming.***Desperate Hedge Fund companies threatened by the success of the Retail Investor continue to write articles filled with desperation in attempts to instill fear into selling.It's Game Over for Shorties, as AMC is on its way to the Moon we look back at the past 3 months and consider the momentum AMC has had overcoming all odds. What Hedge Fund companies don't realize is the BEST IS YET TO COME FOR AMC who recently released a block-buster last weekend with still even greater movies, expect this quarter to be outrageously positive as jealous hedge-funds watch the greatness unfold more great news will be on the horizon.*Following months are going to be EPIC for AMC just like any block-buster movie.*Unlike Poor Hedge-Fund companies whose managers are a slow dying breed, AMC will continue to thrive and thriving it is with very significant upside.As a fellow Ape, we both know our role in this, go see an afternoon matinee at an AMC theatre near you during short attack down days.Watch the shorts do their thing, just kick back and relax this is temporary, the truth of the matter is every time there is a short attack it guarantees an upside. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction which makes stock rise.As Apes we own the float that has not changed.When 2021 comes to a close, it will undoubtedly be remembered as the year AMC went to the Moon!***Apes will not sell."
"I called Fidelity and TD Ameritrade yesterday to make certain that they CANNOT lend my AMC shares. Both told the same story:To lend out a investor's shares, the investor would have to have a margin account at either brokerage AND they must have a debit in their margin account. If these conditions exist, both brokerages can lend the investor's shares. If these conditions DO NOT exist, then the investor's shares CANNOT be loaned out by either brokerage.I found this interesting. Also, when I talked to TD Ameritrade, I explained that with all the attention on naked shorting and shorting in general, I DO NOT want my shares to be used by the brokerage firms to lend. The person at TD Ameritrade had an interesting reaction and agreed with me. I got the impression that they are getting tons of calls about shorting because the Apes have brought this into the spotlight this year."
"Time, evidence and data is on our side"
"Desperate Hfs are borrowing and selling shares so fast, to try and artificially suppress the price, but are running out of shares to borrow. https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMCGet ready for AMC to really shoot up !!"
"This is getting so Tense ! Never I'm my life before did I wish the weekend away so I could get to Monday ! Tension building, squeeze coooommmming +!"
We expanded the ape army this week based on FOMO and the merger discussions with Amazon. Great news for longs to have greater control of the float!
"$AMC conversationBoy this definitely warrants a short share recall. Numbers aren't even close to adding up with retail owning all of 500 million shares that doesn't include institutions, , borrowed etf's, and insiders. Now if we take all the shorts my guess is we are way, way, waaaaaaaaay beyond the 102 million reported by ortex today. We could be well over 1.5 billion shares short we just don't know. We must, must must call in the short shares as a shareholder with thousands of shares I believe it is necessary beyond a shadow of a doubt so I know my shares are not being diluted by synthetic shares. Yea or Nay shareholders this is a huge catalyst. We shareholders demand all short shares be recalled due to the numbers that just do not add up. ""Yea or Nay"""
"The Grove and the Americana theatres, 2 of the highest grossing theatres in LA are now in AMC hands. "
"There were some big money plays just before market close on Friday. $600k worth of call options were placed for AMC within the last 12 minutes of trading. On Sunday, news was released that Hedge Funds will now have to have 200% the regular margin requirements to short a stock. This means that Hedge Funds will need to have twice as much collateral in order to short a stock, meaning that there's a much bigger chance of them getting margin called. With this news, the big money plays on Friday, and this higher than normal pre-market volume, I can't help but this that there may have been some insider trading. Follow the big money people. This may be a very good week for AMC. BUY and HOLD!"
"Robert posted low volume, why because we own over 80 % of the float and when you are consolidating and getting nearer the tip of the bullish wedge the stock takes a breather. The high volume of the past may also have been due to high frequency trading to control the stock. We are sitting beautiful."
just like yesterday. at market close we get synthetic shorting while volume is low to intentionally drop the price.
Time is our most precious asset. We own the outstanding float. We won’t be leaving until every short position is closed. And we sky rocket to extraordinary levels

"AMC is so strong that not even all of these short attacks can impact it. Short interest rose over 4% yesterday and is at 2.30% today.The best that the could do is bring us down to $51 and change.UTILIZATION of borrowed shares is back up as you can see.Current94.287 days ago82.9092.2 million shares are on loan as of today which is up from 87.50 million just 7 days ago.002 goes into effect tomorrow. Shorts are in a real hole and there seems to be no way out.I believe there is a good chance we close in green today and then we may see some fireworks soon. With an automated intraday liquidity check staring at hedgies everyday, much of the manipulation used to attack stocks will now be impossible to pull off.I would at least expect the routine to change as hedgies may be able to play games after each liquidity is complete each day so we may have to look at new daily trends, but overall shorts are on a much shorter leash beginning tomorrow and it is showing today as AMC just will not fade regardless of the shorting going on today.Good Days Are Coming Soon. The Game Has Changed."
"Tomorrow is launch  day to $100, just needed a good base Green Day today to establish the needed positive algorithms."
This is the biggest opportunity in the market today. This is a revolution. George W cup and handle bull flag 
Super low volume today. I guess the hedgies shorting back and forth at a loss is the only action this stock is seeing today! Just be patient…it costs nothing to hodl!
Yahoo stop deleting my posts!Bought 500 more shares this am with my diamond hands.Long and strong till the end!
"and to think, hedgie STILL has not covered...not even close..."
If we close this for Trey above 60 ! It will be the greatest day of AMC ! I know we can do it Light tap
"So they have 13 days to exercise their FTD or can file some BS and extend it to 35 days.? Of course they will file for the extension which makes no sense. They really effed up with AMC. They never thought in their wildest dreams there would be diamond hands who bought in all they way from ten and as much as they could until 70. Plus the diamond hands that bought at $20/$30/$40/$50. When we all get rich we must have a huge family union. Rent Disneyland out for the weekend, for family fun and then vegas for a weekend of pure partying!!!!"
"Simple Questions to Ask Yourself:1) Do you bash any stocks?2) Why is the AMC YF board ""messed up""?3) Why do bashers care about what we do with our money?4) Do you know what ""Short and Distort"" is? (If not google it)5) Do you want financial security?6) Does the moon have a hot tub?"
Anyone owning CALLS at the $45-$50 strike should be buying huge sums today.
"if you still have fear or doubt that this will squeeze, you haven't been paying attention"
"Please try send below complaint off to SEC if you canTo: chairmanoffice@sec.govcc commissionerpeirce@sec.gov; commissionercrenshaw@sec.gov; commissionerroisman@sec.govSubject: Market Manipulation - AMC EntertainmentDear Mr GenslerI would like to draw your attention to market manipulation activity happening on an indutrial scale on range of stocks including AMC listed on US Exchanges by market makers operating in the dark pool.Brokerages such as Fidelity which routes retail orders through NYSE reports day in day out the buy orders for AMC outnumbering sell orders by nearly 2 to 1, yet the price has been falling consistently now for the past month. It is falling because brokerages such as Robinhood,TD Ameritrade and Charles Shwab, attracted by payments for order flow, are routing retail orders through dark pool market makers such as Citadel and Virtu which routes sell orders to lit exchanges on receipt and park buy orders in their books; eventually releasing it to lit exchanges as and when it favours them.In fact, on option expiry days, you can almost exactly predict to the dime where the price of stocks manipulated in this manner will finish at end of day trading.My question to you Sir is: Why is the SEC allowing Citadel and other clearinghouse money makers/broker-dealers to route over 50% of all the AMC retail buy orders to dark pools and sell orders to the market, thus effectively truncating AMC market price?United States prides itself as a free fair and competitive market driven economy. However, the above practice appears anything but. It is pure manipulation by and to the benefit of a single entity Citadel, and to the detriment of tens of millions of retail investors. This needs to be investigated and the practice ended as a matter of URGENCY,Sincerely"
They can’t borrow your shares if you’re not in margin Something that’s been questioned recently
From 800k shares available to borrow to 20k in 30 minutes. I can afford to buy at least 1 share

"AMC investors: It is easy to spot the paid shills but also understand, there are fake longs who gradually give themselves away by their comments. They will soft bash the stock and will increase their bashing based on the comments from you. When you are a participant in what we are seeing here on AMC message thread (psychological warfare), it is important to know and understand who you can depend upon as a source of information. The hedge funds have been and are proficient at identifying patterns and using emotions to gain the upper hand. They have been doing this for many years and we have been complaisant, that is, UP TO NOW. AMC is not only a play to gain a significant amount of money but it an awakening by the common investor in which they sending a message that THEY ARE NO LONGER GOING TO SIT IDLY BUY WHILE HEDGE FUNDS STEAL THEIR CAPITAL THROUGH ILLEGAL TACTICS TO PAD THE POCKETS OF THEMSELVES, THEIR FAMILIES, THEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR WEALTHY CLIENTELE!!!"
Think of the little guys holding only a couple shares. Im holding to the moon for them!!
F9 biggest opening since Star Wars. Rise of sky walker.
AMC going past $50 per share cause AMC is on fire!
"I have averaged up so much I see little profit now until the MOASS. But that is our goal. Buy 1, 5, 10 shares if you can. Over 4 million retail investors in this. We should own every share out there. You want that money? Theres no reward without risk so grow a pair and lets make the MOASS real!"
We never lost hope ! It’s going to pay off big! If we hold from here interest is more costly! Don’t let shorts win their bets! That’s the strategy. Collective strength !

"A lot of you guys just go from info to info and worry. The biggest thing going on right now, imo, is the regulations being put into place that almost literally specifically protect the market from crashing when this all comes tumbling down.

Facts:There are regulations due to be passed blah blah blah (i dont need to go into this again)500M share dilution gone - 43M outstanding shares they can use is a drop in the bucket.
