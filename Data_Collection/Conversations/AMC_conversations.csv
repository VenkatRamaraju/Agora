"AMC is so strong that not even all of these short attacks can impact it. Short interest rose over 4% yesterday and is at 2.30% today.The best that the could do is bring us down to $51 and change.UTILIZATION of borrowed shares is back up as you can see.Current94.287 days ago82.9092.2 million shares are on loan as of today which is up from 87.50 million just 7 days ago.002 goes into effect tomorrow. Shorts are in a real hole and there seems to be no way out.I believe there is a good chance we close in green today and then we may see some fireworks soon. With an automated intraday liquidity check staring at hedgies everyday, much of the manipulation used to attack stocks will now be impossible to pull off.I would at least expect the routine to change as hedgies may be able to play games after each liquidity is complete each day so we may have to look at new daily trends, but overall shorts are on a much shorter leash beginning tomorrow and it is showing today as AMC just will not fade regardless of the shorting going on today.Good Days Are Coming Soon. The Game Has Changed."
"Those elected to protect working people in DC have no plans to stop the hedge fund activity because they rely on the wall street system for their personal wealth and re-election campaigns. Let's face it, they want us divided, yet, here we are, a perfect example of working together to gain individual financial freedom. With me, I don't want gov giveaways; just a fair opportunity to gain ground though investing. I'm confident we'll win this one but look at who's against us and who looks away. As Pacino said in his role in Scarface: ""its okay."" Anyway, I added 45 this morning .to my 6 month bag and plan to walk away a fairly rich dude. Best to all who HOLDS"
This Yahoo board has been manipulated. Thats how i know the squeeze hasnt started. Simple. Hodl and buy
"Ken Griffin sells remaining Faena House condo for $11.2M Hedge funder’s two units sold for a combined $46M, 23% less than he paid in 2015Cover AMC short"
"just wanted to thank everyone holding strong. I have only 10 shares, but regardless of $$ I can say that I have been a part of this movement mainly because I agree with the other reason for this short squeeze. The market was supposed to be a free market where ANYONE could invest money into the companies that they supported. however after years of corrupt intentions this is no longer the case and its about time there was a strong, and smart, enough force to actually put up a fight. I'll hold for your million(s) and i believe whole heartedly , that you will hold mine. TO THE MOON!!!!! cheers"
"I vote no to diluting shares, simply because we own the majority of the shares… if you vote yes, you let them take power away from us… simple, don’t believe that they need money to make amc better, they already did their offering, cash is not an issue, ask Jerome Powell"
Almost 3000 shares I’m holding this is probably the only chance I’m going to get to make it big. I can see why people are trying to get us to sale. AMC will be massive
"Just the fact that can manipulate this stock so much and hide the real buy orders is unbelievable. The market is looking very corrupt now that we know what is really going on. Why would anyone invest after knowing all this?We are lucky because we own the float and everyone is holding but I hope other investors in other stocks are taking notice and learning that the odds are so stacked against the retail investor.When they start covering and institutions begin selling, do you think they will let retail gobble up some of those shares? Probably not. If it's going through Citadel, they can just put the buy orders aside and take every share that becomes available. We need to just hold the majority and will will outlast them."
"Not advice, but I am still holding. Interest rates and volume are looking VW like."
We have not won until your earnings hit 7-8 digits!
STRONGER TOGETHERWe patiently HOLD we Win !! Don’t get distracted by Shorty’strickery.Keep the faith .
Holdin since July 2020! Haven't sold one share..we got this! 
"Morning to all, today we might test some higher numbers again, so word of Advice: Try your best to not get too excited until we break just around that 82 wall. If we play it cool we're less likely to activate an emotional dump detected by the algoritms. Keep on about your day and do what you normally do as if nothing happened. (not financial advice.)"
My secret to Holding I grew up poor this is easy .... opening a refrigerator door and seeing it always empty that was hard been here since 8.01 not selling my 8001 shares are locked down
"Our support level just gets higher, and higher on profit taking days."
"Repost, I hope everyone is remembering that today after the market closes, the Russell 2000 is rebalanced. AMC will need to be purchased. Why sell your shares now when you could just wait until Monday. Not financial advice but just my opinion."
"1). For Lit (NYSE) Exchange: Float: 513M shares; 2). shorted shares: 87M shares (or about 17% shorted shares); Retail investors own more than 80% of AMC stock; 4). Short institutions have lost about $5 Billion.....4). For Dark Pool ""Off"" Exchange: Short institutions have lost $29.5 Billion (almost 6X more than the ""lit"" exchange): Total: Short HFs/MMs have lost so far about $35 Billion (see #9 below); Based on the data: 5). about 589.3M shorted shares in the dark pool (or about 102% shorted shares in the dark pool) (It might be higher than 102% in the coming weeks/months......Not 17% that we read); 6). About 480% retail investors own AMC stock ( (this includes synthetic shares in dark pool); this is my only conservative estimate. 480% retail investors own AMC stock (80% x 6); 7). 70,109 ""CALL"" option contracts ITM on June 25th & 263,288 ""PUT"" option contracts OTM on June 25; 8). The cost to borrow for short is as high as 19% & the Avg a few day ago was 3.5% cost to borrow (daily short borrow fee): SEE short HFs amount loss mounting each day just from the Avg 3.5% borrow fee....I am not including the calculation of the Gamma Squeeze and Short Squeeze. I believe that these GREED institutions will continue to double down their short positions....I think short institutions might lose tens of $trillion betting against AMC stock when Calculate the Short Squeeze......9).

The Avg short borrow fee will likely be higher in the coming weeks. 11). The short HFs losses will be mounting to about $69.6Billion on July 23 if they stop buying in the dark pool and sell in the lit exchange, as of June 24th. But, short HFs will not likely stop double/triple/quadruple down the short positions. I am willing to wait out as long as it takes until shorts cover. These are only my opinions. Do your own research before investing."
My post keeps getting deleted toAMC is projected to go 300% in the next 3 month. SRC stockinvest.us. search. Published yesterday. Probability 90%
MOTLEY going extra hard on the FUD this morning.. some serious movement must be imminent!
"Alright, looks like we can communicate again today after what was a day of some big consolidation at AMC and another day that finished green although by just a hair. 002 kicks into full effect today and a lot of folks thinking it will be a major upheaval in the way we are priced at AMC. I don't expect much of a price increase from 002 if any at all. Once again the watchful SEC will need to become the enforcing SEC and they just do not seem to be enforcing anything at this time so expect more of the same there. Yesterday ortex reported that there are still 91 million short shares(that we know of) that are still to be covered. Shorts still need our shares and we are not selling so they will continue to need our shares. Please do not make them available. The morning looks pretty good for another hold by the apes in this price range. Do not worry about the price hanging around and not running like wildfire every day. To be honest if the price was going up 12% a day I would be more concerned than I am with the heavy support we have shown at these levels All is good at AMC this morning. Today I think is another day of finding that place or item that helps you to relax and just let it go. As we see the price swings are getting larger as we have seen 10% become almost the normal range here for the day. For now do not expect anything different. Again, the squeeze can happen at any minute, it is that close and it is coming. With enough pressure coming today there is a decent (60%) chance we will see a $60+ close today. That is a large mountain to climb with what we have seen this weeks but never underestimate the will of this Ape community. We were censored yesterday, I expect a little retaliation today against the shorts and hedges and the will to drive price up. Enjoy the day all. Higher highs are on the way."
AMC is the people’s stock. We own the float.
Smart money is loading up huge
FOX Business reported AMC to have a strong chance of a short squeeze. Coming from a big news platform it certainly brings the stock sentiment up for most retail investors.
"Anyone who watched the Adam Aron interviews on Trey's Trades knows that the CEO is against the hedge funds. Hedge funds are hoping the Ape Army will destabilize, or, simply go away. Don't let misinformation get the better of us. We are winning. Hedge funds have been losing billions and billions this year alone. And don't forget the battle for GME is still ongoing. What we saw in January was only a gamma squeeze."
"On 2nd June 2021 AMC share price was $70+ and on that day, the volume was way over 500M.... look at the volume now... what does that indicate?1. HFs have no more shares - We Apes have all their shares and not selling.2. HFs are playing ping pong - buying & selling between themselves. Technically speaking, they can play this game all day and bring it down to zero... but, they will not do that because, it will make them go bankrupt (personally speaking, even at this point in time, many HFs are on the brink of Bankruptcy).3. AMC share value has the potential to increase exponentially if we continue to HODL. On June 2nd, it increased by 125% and this is nothing when it starts to squeeze.Do not compare AMC to GameStop or Volkswagen because AMC is of a different league and this squeeze will go into the Wallstreet history books!HODL, Buy if you can & continue to HODL... (not a financial advice)"
"I can guarantee that a lot of APES! are just like me, a guy who has a working man's job and has been involved in the markets for a time just so he can eventually get by. That ""get by"" has been hijacked a lot in the past 30 years of investing. I have too many sad songs to sing (ONT, NYFX, currently CYDY) terrific companies that are getting or were driven into the ground by the man. AMC is our push back, our revenge!! I bought more today and will tomorrow. APES! stay strong and long and win!"
"Wow, the shorts are really hitting yahoo chat today eh. Ain't gonna work. AMC "
"-----AMC IMPORTANT COMMUNITY INFO-----As some of you know, I have been a part of this story since the beginning. I have made many posts and done my own DD accurately. Though I have been quiet for a while (due to work) let me stay this, and it applies to apes new (who got in at $70) and old (apes who got in at $3). We only got to where we are now because we were patient. We went from $18 to $5 and held. These pull backs and consolidation are part of a pattern and at the end of that pattern is always a major rip. So if it takes a few weeks of consolidation or dips so be it. The rips happen when you least expect it. My second point is the community.We have been invested in this mentally and physically long enough to understand what is going on. We have come together for a reason, we are made up of the common folk, united globally to take back what is owed to us. don't let them take this opportunity away from you, from me, from your neighbor or from someone across the world. Its the only weapon they have left and its the oldest and simplest weapon in the book... Divide and conquer...When you have interns from institutions working to spread FUD on chat rooms and false DD then that should only strengthen your conviction in AMC and that institutions are getting desperate...SO what is my point...No more infighting (not that I have seen much). No more uneasiness (and I speak from experience) about the day to day price action. No more stress because we all know how this story ends and its beautiful and meaningful. Waiting truly pays off (I again speak from experience) Love you all. To those of you who are uncertain. I'm up enough to buy a house in full and I got in originally at $18 back in January so imagine how long I had to wait. your time will come. I am holding for you and more importantly for our powerful unification of the common folk. This is going to happen when you least expect it... So why not not walls tree where is hurts and get rich off it at the same time? Regardless, much love and spread that love thought the community!-K(not financial advice, just my opinions and experience. please dont take advice from someone who eats crayons and only looks up and down before crossing the street)please spread this message on whatever social media you feel like, I know yahoo is deleting everything..."
Remember options have to be covered on the open market and don’t sweat the PM today.
I will be buying another 100 shares today and will continue to HODL until we reach at least $10k/share. Outrageous you say...to be hodling for $10k/share. I say what's outrageous and also unconscionable is the behavior of the Hedge Funds by creating synthetic shares of AMC and setting up naked short positions which are impossible to cover. The actions of the Hedge Funds has led us to a point where $10k/share is reasonable. This is not financial advice. I just like the stock.
"Folks John is desperate, he just posted a link to motley. You might as well say there done. Same as posting a link to MarketWatch, seeking alpha. I read one article on them over a month ago and now just laugh at their titles. Same as the article about AMC owing 200 million, but they forgot to say it was AMCX different company. The lows these people will go to in order to con you out of your shares , lol"
"AMC investors:Hedge funds and paid shills have underestimated the AMC investors currently holding the stock. Hedge funds arrogance and the reliance on algorithms have not helped hedge funds to achieve their goal(s) and this is why paid shills are still a heavy presence here on the AMC thread, as well as the HOOD thread. This battle is still ongoing with hedge funds believing they can continue to illegally naked short and to 'park buy orders' in the order flow process while dumping 'sell' orders on the open market, with the hope that investors, seeing a small spike' will get bored of the continuous 'ups and downs' of the stock and be motivated to sell. I cannot provide a date on the expected squeeze but can tell you that patience will reward. We are waiting on any one of the potential catalysts to propel this stock to new highs and there are some major economic events expected to impact the markets and those events will most likely impact AMC in a positive manner. Remember, AMC IS BACKED BY BILLIONS OF SYNTHETIC SHARES. While I worry about my positions in other stocks, I do not worry about AMC. THE QUESTION IS NOT 'IF' A SQUEEZE WILL OCCUR, IT IS 'WHEN' AND ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT IT IS INEVITABLE!!!"
"On January 27th 2021, AMC stock, one hour into trading, the days volume was already over 500 million shares which was significantly above the stock's 30-day average volume of 86.8 million shares a day. By 4pmET on that day more than 1.1 billion shares had been traded and we have since that day barely reached half that volume ever again. Now add to that, the outstanding share float on January 27th was only 250 million authorized shares. The next day, robinhood and a couple other brokers stopped everyone from buying AMC shares. GME as well. Now ask yourself how could this happen? It couldn't be that people bought the 250 million shares and sold them and bought them and sold them and bought them and sold them and bought them 5 times in the same day? The Stock was hot and on an incredible upswing trading around twenty dollars from a previous day high of 5 dollars. Who would have been selling at that particular time? Like nobody.Could it be that because of what GME was doing at the time (they closed around 350 dollars on that day) people, like me saw a chance for AMC to do something similar and at the price of 5 dollars was worth buying a ton of shares and did just that? I think so. I think there were at least 750 million shares or more sold on that day and this is why hedges could not close their positions even when it came down shortly thereafter to 5 dollars per share. I seriously think that AMC shares were sold out 6 months ago and there are probably 1.5 billion shares out there somewhere. Never made sense to me until finding out about dark pool and their ability to park buy orders. If this is all yrue and there are that money shares out there, we are rich and the hedges should have already been liquidated as they could not possibly cover that amount. Now, since the SEC is giving them such a long leash, they are probably whittling down and trying to cover those shares. Good luck with that. Does anyone know where to see the level 2 buy/sell ratio for AMC on January 27th 2021?"
F9 movie numbers are just the start to big summer movie going experiences... Can you say Catalyst?
"At $72.62, ALL short positions EVER opened during regular trading hours will be in the red and building losses! Looking forward to seeing that day come!"
All other stock conversations are working............just AMC not showing current messages........Yahoo owned by Citadel LLC
New to amc. Does fast and furious doing great numbers make the stock go up?
"There were some big money plays just before market close on Friday. $600k worth of call options were placed for AMC within the last 12 minutes of trading. On Sunday, news was released that Hedge Funds will now have to have 200% the regular margin requirements to short a stock. This means that Hedge Funds will need to have twice as much collateral in order to short a stock, meaning that there's a much bigger chance of them getting margin called. With this news, the big money plays on Friday, and this higher than normal pre-market volume, I can't help but this that there may have been some insider trading. Follow the big money people. This may be a very good week for AMC. BUY and HOLD!"
Let’s go to 50
FINALLY THE CEO is doing...THE RIGHT THING!25 MILLION SHARES - WITHDRAWN!!!!Lovin AA now!
"AMC investors. I KNOW THIS SEEMS LIKE IT HAS GONE ON FOREVER AND YES, IT DEFINITELY HAS BEEN TOO LONG. This stock should have squeezed already but hedge funds have continued to double down and borrow more shares that they never buy back. At times, we thought SEC would step in, At times, we thought DTCs new rules would level the playing field but we are in this battle and we are going to win, as long as we hold. I HAVE SAID THIS MORE THAN ONE TIME BUT WILL SAY THIS AGAIN. Hedge funds are looking to get as many investors to sell as they possibly can. They have borrowed shares in the millions daily without ever buying them back but yet, the SEC does not appear to be stepping in. EVERY ACTION HAS A CONSQUENCE and things change daily. Do you honestly believe that hedge funds can continue to short indefinitely without ANY IMPACT TO BANKS, AND OTHER AREAS OF THE MARKET. HEDGE FUNDS ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY POSSIBLY CAN TO WRESTLE SHARES FROM WEAK HANDS AS THIS SQUEEZE IS INEVITABLE BUT IF THEY CAN MINIMIZE THE IMPACT ON THE MARKET, THEY ARE GOING TO TRY. Why hasn't the SEC stepped in? Is this not impacting the market as a whole? -- of course it is, hedge funds have shorted the Russell index, they have shorted the market to instill fear and cause a massive sell-off in order to get Investors to sell AMC and GME. Do not think for a minute that the SEC really does not know what is going on and do not think that they have not discussed a plan with Citadel and other hedge funds. Even those groups which did not truly understand the illegal activities of some of these hedge funds, now have an understanding of what is going on in the market. Do not believe any financial institution that pretends they do not know what is going on and those who spend considerable amount of money bashing one stock when there are thousands of publicly-traded companies. Hedge funds and their paid shills have been spending millions in resources for months now. THEIR DESPERATION IS OBVIOUS. They know the squeeze is inevitable and they know the only way out is through you and many others. THEY NEED THE MASSES TO SELL AND IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS THROUGH THE HUNDREDS OF PAID SHILLS THAT THEY HAVE 'DEPLOYED' TO THE AMC BATTLE, then they are going to do what they can to motivate some weak hands to sell in order to soften the blow. BUY AND HOLD, IF AFFORDABLE TO DO SO. FOR TD AMERITRADE MEMBERS, YOU MIGHT WISH TO CHANGE YOUR ORDER FLOW PREFERENCES FROM THE DEFAULT TO THE IEX EXCHANGE. IEX, this is the Investors Exchange, it is a fair, simple and transparent stock exchange dedicated to investor and issuer protection."
10/10 short squeeze rating. Billions of synthetics phantom shares IOUs Christmas sale
Just another +7.5% day.It’s hard just holding shares without paying interest.
"I am more of a trader than a ""diamond hands"" guy - but must admit am impressed with the steady upward trend here"
"Seems like shorty is stuck at the moment. They have borrowed another 4.61 million shares today so far and were only able to return 1.69 million so far. They have increased their short shares by 3.07% today and it doesnt look like they will find many shares to buy back at this $56 level.The more stagnant the price becomes, the more likely we are to see a bounce up off these levels. Shorts are playing with fire right now.Just a matter of time before they realize how trapped they are. They are losing money everyday and its obvious they cant ladder during the day as they used to.Clock is ticking and time is running out. Just make sure you do not have stop losses set, you will lose your shares when they come fishing."
"So what we all want to know is this, is AMC trending up or down? Let's see if we can tell by the following.Friday's low $52.97 Friday's high $56.29Monday's low $54.33 Monday's high $59.36Today's low $56.18 Today's high $61.00What do you think now?"
"DON'T TRUST ETRADE! I am not happy with Etrade they called me this morning in regard to a cash call. At the time I was undergoing a medical treatment for cancer, so they left a VM. Once the my treatment was complete, I checked my phone and, called back immediately to inform them that I would be making a transfer to cover as soon I as arrived home. I was surprised to find out that not even hour after they left the VM, they decided to sale shares of my AMC!!! Which is very shady to me. Considering all of the things that are going on with AMC and, the fact that E-Trade is in business with Citadel, the biggest shorter of AMC, the decision to sell shares of AMC and not any of my other holdings is very suspect. I have Tesla and Apple just to name a couple."
"Due to the new ruling, the volume will be low til the shorts decide to cover, could be anytime now. Patience is a virtue"
"The literally insane number of basher on this board, increasing every day, tells you absolutely everything you need to know about this situation. The hedge funds are UTTERLY DESPERATE. Nobody is selling, and they haven't covered. It's totally clear from the data. #AMC - HOLDING INDEFINITELY. WHATEVER IT TAKES."

Maybe we should be reporting this to the Secret Service since it should fall under counterfeit laws. The SEC is unwilling to take action on the manipulation.
#AMC 2 D MOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Got the paperwork in the mail for the vote in July but I will sell each share for 500 by the end of the month and go on vacation to Nassau Bahamas
"no advice. keep holding, buying. I think we all just about don't care less what they do . we will win."
Amc been #1 for months...And yahoo never trends it...haha!Another sign that we GOT A WINNA!!
The millions of dollars they are spending to try and drive this down day after day is mind boggling.
I’m having a great time in my hot tub drinking coffee and muting bashers. I declare today Mute Monday. It feels good. Just do it a few times today while AMC starts the squeeze!
"Getting paid in a couple of days. Guess what. Buying more AMC.. Increasing my number of share every possible opportunity I am given as the squeeze lingers on. My profit opportunity further increases with time.. Very,very happy sitting and waiting for that check to clear."
So many longs holding strong and buying more. This is why we got where we are. Imagine if few more paper hands and day traders join the cause - it will be beyond epic. Bashers u are welcome to come on board as well. Remember we told u to buy when it was 6 and 8 and 12. U know u want to join the cause and go long. It feels right and it feels good. See u all above 80 and beyond I trade accurately with crypto currency’s on What_sApp +44 7404 277920 with the help of RitaspenserFX .. Good luck guys . Also have a close ears for disclaimers
"I bought . I held. the price went up and down and up up and down down down and up and down and up up up and down and up and down and up up up and down and up up up up up up and down and up and down and here we are now, more ups than downs and a massive increase in my account please explain what I am doing wrong shorty"
"Shorts will indeed cover at some point and when they do this stock will rocket before you can even get in. So buy, hold and fasten your seat belt for take off. "
"Just added 310 more shares, bought the dip time to go out and enjoy life because i trust the process. Always remember we own the float and the hedgies have not covered "
"It's ironic that the social network tactics being used against retail investors are now being used effectively to bankrupt the hedge funds. They invented these Gustapo strategies long before the modern social network to shape the narrative in their favor. They spread the word however they could to the public and to their collusion partners. They totally controlled the media aspect and the psychological warfare. They used these tactics successfully to bankrupt many companies or kill their share price momentum. Of course here we are today and I think we now have the upper hand because we can share information and due diligence all over the world in a matter of seconds. The internet has allowed us a chance to access worlds of knowledge instantly that in recent history, you either went to library to get or were lucky enough to know somebody who could share their knowledge. One cannot hide behind misinformation and lies that easy anymore. Conspiracies are much harder to pull off and the playing field has been somewhat leveled. We still are not privy to as much information as the hedge funds but eventually, with our diligence and persistence, the playing field will be leveled even more.Just a few short months ago, nobody new anything about the dark pools, naked shares, synthetics and much much more. It is killing the hedge funds because as time goes on, all their secrets are being uncovered by smart apes as well as the entire world who must now think the United States stock market is not what they thought fair trading should be. The hedges have caused far more damage then we think. It's not our fault and even if it is, who cares. We own the shares and we want to get paid."
"When AMC does pop with gamma squeezes right before the major major squeeze afterwards ,you decide to sell early.if you make this decision you are betting that the shorts can bring down this price afterwards. Simply by looking at AMC’s yearly charts I could not risk selling to early, because when this thing begins to pop it could and can take entirely week or two weeks to play out the biggest squeeze!"
"When the super squeeze happens...does it really matter if the launch pad is the $40s, $30s, $50s, or single digits? Just R-E-L-A-X."
I can't wait to pay my 37% capital gains tax ! I will then know I have made millions!
We want our $2 back  how much money do you think the hedge funds lost today trying to keep this stock down?
F9 had the highest grossing weekend since Q4 of 2019... Covid restrictions are being lifted and the rocket is fueled... Now we wait - I have all the time in the world. I'm not losing any money holding... :)
"I feel so relaxed sitting here at $59, just bought another 100 shares."
This is huge. Top lawyer Wes Christian was hired to represent AMC and GME against Wallstreet and the Hedgies. His team is funded by a gofundme created by an AMC investor Chad Brewer. Wes Christian tweeted it is legit. https://gofund.me/fb8f2ecd
"Strong box office showing for ""Black Widow"" - AMC theaters continue to fill..."
"Vanguard has over 65 million shares, AND Blackrock has over 27 million shares... They are all in on AMC since they know the squeeze is inevitable... HODL"
"When all of this first began I able to put my shares up for sale for $8000 to $10000, now they won't let put a sale price higher than $4000. For GME and $3000 for AMC, for this reason alone I have no sale price, for this reason I believe the first good short covering run will be around these prices, which I believe the squeeze will last longer than a week depending on the amount of shares being traded, if they can find shares to buy and there is very low volume it may take longer, this just my opinion, I have no price prediction, the price will be what the price will be."
AMC makes the NYSE Threshold list again today!!!!!
"Today is great buy volume, just wait for tomorrow will be even bigger!"
"Look at it this way, not even 100M volume today and we still went up $4 like no apes sold and it was hedge funds and plus they increased the short percent it’s at 19% now??? Like what?? They’re making all the effort and still losing day to day even when we are in red days they still lose money with us, it’s not that hard to understand that we all to do is buy and hold this is gonna sky rocket very very soon"
shorts attacked AMC and GME exact sme time. 12:30...12:33. coordinated. market manipulation yeah.
"MESSAGE TO HEDGE FUNDS #$%$1700 dollars per share or we just hold, simple as no Negotiations we can hold forever?"
I have bought 10 shares in the name of our common Ape friend Trey. I will donate 10 shares of money to charity after squeeze.
Lots of big calls bought today. Follow the money.
The last time #AMC had 8 red days in a row it proceeded to go from $10 to $77. So patient is the key just believe in AMC

The emaciated husk that is Sean Williams put out an amusing article this morning. the evil retail investors are ganging up and manipulating the market while the poor hedge funds suffer unjustly.
10 million shares shorted today and we still end green
"Well it seems like shills are taking a different approach on Yahoo board here. They are all casting doubt pretending to be longs. I see them responding to my posts. They stand out like a sore thumb.Folks, let me make this simple, there is no doubt we are going higher. patience is the key. shorts borrowed 12 million shares yesterday and could do nothing to this stock.Shorts are now much more limited in what they can do as far as manipulation due to 002. Ladder attacks, naked shorting, over leveraging are all things of the past.Any short that attempts such nonsense will be over liquidated and have a huge issue with the potential for an automated sell off due to intra day liquidity checks.I have Ortex running all day long, short interest is rising, do not let anyone tell you different, shares are being borrowed by the millions daily. Shorts borrowed 12 million yesterday, accomplished nothing and returned 11 million of those.We had an up day in the upper levels of our price channel even though volume was extremely low for AMC.Yahoo board blocked us out yesterday, Apollo Investments owns Yahoo. They shorted AMC before, and are probably short again. Trying to control the narrative by buying Yahoo and controlling our ability to discuss AMC is a bold move but will not work.We are strong, we know what we own, and we know that everyday shorts are becoming weaker and the rules are leveling the playing field. Do not allow anyone on this board to tell you anything different. Nothing has changed."

"The American Prospect☰How the GameStop Hustle WorkedHow hedge funds and brokers have manipulated the market.by Lucy KomisarJUNE 22, 2021 5:30 AMKomisar-GameStop 062221.jpgJohn Minchillo/AP PhotoI have written previously for the Prospect about the frenzy over GameStop (GME), the video game and electronics company. By now, you know the story. Millions of retail investors made the stock soar by over 1,000 percent in January 2021. This brought disaster upon a handful of hedge funds that had bet on GameStop’s stock to drop. According to Markets Insider, one analyst estimated losses in February of roughly $19 billion. The hedge fund Melvin Capital reportedly closed out its position after taking a drubbing of 51 percent. Another fund, Maplelane, lost 40 percent.The rally eventually subsided, and the stock fell, though it remains well above its original price. But as retail investors looked into the details in the aftermath, they found telltale signs of a common yet egregious trading fraud by major brokers and hedge funds, which evaded what could have been far bigger losses. What happened around GameStop can be explained only by massive counterfeiting of shares.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which along with other regulators could confirm whether the patterns seen in GameStop trading constitute fraud, has known about and largely ignored practices like this for years. The financial media also ignores this systemic corruption.Here’s how it works.Naked Short Selling and Fails to DeliverThe SEC allows traders to short a stock, which means to sell it even if they don’t own it, hoping to buy it back later at a lower price and bank the difference. Short sellers borrow the stock, usually from a broker, who either has it in their inventory, borrows it from another broker, or vows to “locate” the stock when the time comes and cover the short.That promise is often fake. A broker handling several sellers will borrow synthetic or manufactured shares, or “locate” the same stocks for multiple shorts. Traders and brokers have been mildly sanctioned for this scam.Sellers are supposed to send shares to buyers within two days. If they don’t convey the stock, there is a failure to deliver (FTD). This is also known as naked short selling. Traders that have outstanding FTDs are required to transfer the shares within a given time and are restricted from selling short until then. This rule is massively ignored or finessed, and the penalties are minor.The major GME short sellers had to cover their shorts at a time when the funds had shorted much more stock than existed and when owners with real shares weren’t selling, even at higher prices. They were threatened with a short squeeze, with the price going so high that they cannot cover it with existing assets, and they get a margin call, a demand that additional money gets dropped into their brokerage account.The short squeeze ended under peculiar circumstances. A January 28 spike in GME led Robinhood, the online broker that handled orders for many retail traders, to cut the buy option for the stock from its app. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told the House Financial Services Committee in February that he had discussed the trade restrictions with the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), which clears public trades, after it made a $3 billion margin call.However, DTCC CEO Michael Bodson told the committee in May that “the decision to restrict trading really was internal to Robinhood, we did not have discussions about that.” He noted that with Robinhood, “the system worked.” It stopped the buys while the big traders continued to sell. GME that day hit $483, but then the price plummeted, and the short squeeze was over.Why would Robinhood shut down GME trading? It did not lose money on trades, because it did not have its own investments. The answer may be hidden in the murky relationships involving market makers and hedge funds.Citadel Securities, a market maker, handled Robinhood’s orders on a “pay for order flow” basis (it paid for orders routed to it), which equaled 40 percent of Robinhood’s revenue. Citadel Securities is a division of a company founded by billionaire Ken Griffin. Another division, the Citadel hedge fund, helped provide short seller Melvin Capital with nearly $3 billion in funds during the GME short squeeze. Citadel Securities would have the clout to persuade Robinhood to shut down trading, and the motive, given its other division’s investment in Melvin. (UPDATE: Robinhood COO James Swartwout stated in sworn court testimony in February for a case in California that “no third party, including either Citadel or Citadel Securities, requested that Robinhood apply restrictions on stock or options trading or played any role” in the decision to limit trading.)Citadel Securities also has a knack for running afoul of the trading laws. It has been fined 58 times in the last few years for violating trading regulations, many about nak"

Large buys from Fidelity & Blackrock today!
I truly believe the reason AMC volume was so low today was because new restrictions and rules are starting to take their effect. Doesn't it make sense that the volume would drop majorly if manipulationwas getting restricted? I also can't believe how well the price stood up with virtually no volume comparedto the past. I think I would be scared to death right now if I were shorting and saw no real pull-back on a such a decrease in volume. What's going to happen when AMC makes another announcement and the volume spikes?
AMC is now on the NYSE threshold securities and NOW SHARES CANT be borrowed until this failure to deliver is paid back. They have 7-13 days to pay it back or the position will be automatically closed. THIS IS NOT THE SQUEEZE. THE SQUEEZE IS WHEN ALL THE SYNTHETICS ARE COVERED. Not financial advice.
"A short message to share in addition to all positive information from others in this board. 1. looking into the $AMC daily chart, a very clear volume-price divergence trend is shown in last three weeks. 2. this data shows a potentially very strong uptrend run in following days/weeks.3. apparently short squeeze seems delayed by some force, this has been tried hard to try to shake off the paper hands, to buy more time as much as possible, to reduce the power of squeeze, etc.4. major margin calls seem not starting yet, it can start at anytime.5. newly approved NSCC-002 seems not really being executed in practice yet, when it is effectively in action, changes will immediately show up.6. price strongly standing around this level (mainly around $50~$60) for three weeks looks very much like a consolidation before a big blowing up.7. it seems a lot of ""buy the dip"" and FOMO catching up in last a couple of weeks. 8. data shows still a lot of short attacks in last few days, hence price moves shows there has been no major sells from longs.Expectation will be that when the critical line is crossed, explosion follows,  time coming. GLTL!"

On 6/2 AMC sold 11.5 million shares to drop the share price from $72 to $35. On 6/3 hedgies shorted 10.5 million shares only to drop the share price from $63 to $53. Is it not an evidence apes have been growing stronger and hedgies have been growing weaker? We are winning. Hedgies are just dragging along. Hold until the dominos fall
"Wow, another great day. The lowest volume I’ve seen in probably the last 30 days and the price only dropped $1.39. If the volume keeps getting lower without a drop in price then the days to cover ratio increases for the shorts and the higher the days to cover ratio is, the faster the squeeze happens"
We’ve been consolidating for a week now it’s time for the next leg up. Shorts haven’t started to cover that’s facts

"Most of the gains obtained already would take years if not decades to accumulate for the average person. By holding, we can gather so much more profit in such a short time.

"If you want to know how strong AMC is right now you should just go have a look at the interactive 5 day chart on Yahoo and be sure you use 5 min intervals. What you will see is what amounts to a kiss of death to the shorts. During the post-lunch take-down, hey were able to force the current price, 10 day and 50 day average price below the 200 day average by some measure over the last half hour but my goodness, just look at it now..! All three indices moving back up and over the 200 day as I type.Now have a look at the AMC one month chart and you will see the current price as I post is breaking back over the 10 day moving average which sends and evenstronger signal. I truly believe we are going to see some real fire-works this afternoon and I mean that. This is such a strong signal AMC is sending out here and now. It's phenomenal really and I've never witnessed anything like it. It feels so good to be a part of making history doesn't it?"

"Jim Cramer said, anyone shorting AMC and GameStop are going to lose. And he’s right. Retail investors are holding until shorts are squeezed out of their positions.Shorts can either: 1 Take the loses and close their positions right now where the stock price is around $54. 2 Or, get squeezed out of their positions at a high interest rate above $54, resulting in even bigger losses.With hedge funds shorting AMC losing billions of dollars its first quarter, it’s no surprise we’re going to the see this occur their second quarter as well.How will this affect AMC stock price?I can imagine shorts and hedge funds alike must be furious. The little guy causing a disruption, what!?!￼My personal take is retail investors are going to continue to see foul play. You’re going to experience this from bogus headlines. They’ll usually try to steer the public from buying AMC stock to keep the volume and hype down.Not sure if hedge funds know this yet but you do know documentaries of what’s taking place are in the works right?Independent filmmakers such as the Mulligan Brothers will be covering this story from the retail investors perspective and rumor has it Netflix will be writing as well.Expect AMC stock price to rise and continue to be shorted. We will see volatility with shorts attacking the price action. They do this by trading synthetic shares at low bids.Hang in there just hold buy the dips and I’ll see you on the "

"On Wednesday, market makers, which are also DTCC clearing members, will have to tighten up their short-selling belts. Because their available capital will be contrasted more frequently with member deposits, their ability to maintain massive short positions is slated to be crippled.Current State of the AMC/GME SagaIn case you haven’t yet grasped the basics of short selling, here is a brief recap of basic indicators (we’ll get to the breaking news afterward). The foremost among them is the short interest percentage, referring to the number of shorted shares divided by outstanding shares.According to Ortex data, as of today, both AMC and GME stocks have relatively high estimated short interests, AMC at 13.64% and GME at 14.54% (17% on May 28) of free float.Above 10% is considered high, while above 20% is extremely high, which translates to more investors thinking the stock price will fall. Of course, bullish short squeezers tend to use this metric as an opportunity to buy the dip, counting on the stock to rebound.AMC and GME price moves in 2021, source: TradingViewRegarding the free float, also called public float, it refers to the number of shares available for public trading by using the following formula:Free float = outstanding shares – restricted shares – closely-held sharesWith these two metrics in mind, we arrive at the short-interest ratio, as the number of shorted shares divided by average daily trading volume. This is one of the key factors that enter the consideration when to take short positions. The higher it is, the longer it would take to repurchase the borrowed shares, which is why it is commonly known as the days-to-cover ratio.A ratio above 10 would indicate a negative outlook on the stock. As of May 28 report, AMC’s short ratio was 0.7 with 20.3 million shares sold short, while GME’s short ratio was at 1, with 11.97 million shares sold short. Meaning, they were both bullish indicators."

They can’t borrow your shares if you’re not in margin Something that’s been questioned recently
"This activity, short laddering, sideways movement, will continue. They will never cover of their own free will. The SEC must enforce the rules or they get margin called in order for this to go up. I hold until I have retirement money. I have plenty of time! Costs nothing to hold!"
"Looking back over the last couple of months of the AMC rise, I came across another price channel that appears to be similarly played out to where we are now.From May 13th to May 21st we were stuck in a price channel between around $12 to $14. When we first went to $12 on May 13th, we had volume of 296 million, the following 3 days we averaged around 185 million in volume and tested the $14 price only to be rejected on May 18th.On May 19th, 20th, and 21st volume dropped dramatically as we have seen occur this week, averaging around 66 million volume per day or roughly 1/3rd the volume from May 13th to the 18th.AMC proceeded to drop from a close of $14.03 on May 18th to a close of $12.08 on May 21st. Again sound like a similar trend?On May 24th, a Monday, volume returned and AMC shot from $12.08 to $13.68, Tuesday May 25th it closed at $16.41, Wednesday May 26th, $19.56, Thursday the 27th, $26.52, and Friday May 28th it closed at $26.12.The point of this is we are seeing a similar pattern develop over the last few weeks where we are in a channel that has consolidated beautifully. This channel is now 10 days old and is wound so tightly that when it explodes it could be wild and violent to say the least.We are showing characteristics of something ready to occur as volume has now tailed off, this tells me no one is really selling.A more telltale sign is that short interest as of Friday June 25th was up again as once again shorts borrowed more than they returned.We now sit with the following numbers per ORTEXSHARES ON LOANCurrent97.13m remember 102 million gets us to 20% of free floatThis data is as of close on Wednesday as the T+2 rule makes us wait for trades to clear.% FREEFLOAT ON LOANCurrent18.99%UTILIZATION OF BORROWED SHARESCurrent91.35%Now this is from close of business yesterdayEstimatedCurrent Short Interest95.45m meaning this many shares are what shorts are paying interest on which is due next week by the way.Bottom line is this, every hurricane takes time to develop, takes time to strengthen takes time to make landfall, but when it does it can cause devastation to anyone in its way.

"It is sad for me to think this way about where this world and its people are going.....but.....myself knowing and belief that every business had started up with just an idea, a belief if you will. Even if the company or business is multi-million/billion dollar or not. And it took hard work for people to start up a business from scratch, and with hopes and dreams to make a profit from it, all along with the thoughts of helping out the economy, raising peoples spirits in some sort of way, or even being happy with what they are doing in life without making an impact on their life or wallet. At some point, everybody started out at ZERO $....and some made it big, some barely making it, and some still struggling. The point is you work hard in what you believe in, then somebody or company tries to tear it down for a quick buck! That is not the way it should be, that is not the way we should believe, that is not what we the people of the world should exercise! I would not want that on my conscience! Shorts and Hedges should stop, put themselves in other peoples situation, and think about what they are doing by ruining companies trying, and still trying to make it. They are not only ruining the companies they built, but ruining the peoples lives that actually made it a reality.

We even would not have the moving forward technology we have today to watch movies at home if it wasn't for the film industry all together! It makes NO sense to me to ruin a company or lives for what took so long to build...even if mistakes were made and caused problems within their company.

"Our true enemy is the SEC. Humans we tax payers pay in order to ensure that the stock market is not being manipulated by institutions who have trillions of dollsars at their disposal and can use their funds to lower the true value of stock in favor of exploiting hard working citizens simply to line their pockets. The FED and SEC are very much aware of these manipulations taking place in the stock market. However, they have a conflict of interest in performing their Fiduciary Duties as they have behind the scenes connections with these HF and shorting Financial Institution which they also benefit from when these stocks are manipulated. So they snail like crawl their feet in enforcing the laws that would disallow such. Buying time for their behind the scene friends in order for them to force we the hard working people to sell our shares, allowing the HF managers and shorting institutions opportunities to buy legitimate shares. We need an independent third party to investigate the SEC members as well and prosecute them to the fullest evidence find them in violation of enforcing fair trading laws acts. Corruption needs to be eliminated at all cost. Especially when tax payers monies are paying trusted hired individuals to ensure there is fairly and equal trading opportunities for all when it comes to investment opportunities.

Not sure your team of psychologists are going to help you here, best start the rise upwards and get them to earn their money with how to shake us out that way instead. Handy hint, you are wasting your time below about $500 per share, so maybe start there.#AMC - HOLDING INDEFINITELY. WHATEVER IT TAKES. "
"Desperate Hfs are borrowing and selling shares so fast, to try and artificially suppress the price, but are running out of shares to borrow. https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMCGet ready for AMC to really shoot up !!"
Another beautiful day to be a AMC shareholder. Still up 400% I got no complaints
"Hold steady and be patient...Why do people keep talking about fundamentals....Many people clearly don't understand what's happening with the stock or the movement behind it. There are around 500m shares80% of those are owned by retail traders.15% are held by institutions.Then we have almost 20% short interest.So there are more short positions open than the are available shares, and some other factors like synthetic shares.HF are losing hundreds of millions a week and the shorts haven't covered!"
We own the outstanding float multiple times

"In case you're fairly new to AMC and aren't aware of this most unusual situation, AMC's share price actually doubled on June 2. That is when a gap resulted from the HOD on June 1 being $33.53, and the LOD on June 2 being $35.59.Since this gap was filled today, I have a strong feeling that AMC's share price is about to take off quickly towards uncharted territory. Does anyone here agree with me?"
Shorts have spent billions trying to wait this out. Trading both ways and trading options to try and scratch out some liquidity to keep them afloat. It’s the equivalent of having a maxed out credit card and continually paying the minimum
"Some interesting facts I have been reviewing. NYSE short interest report indicated this on May 28thShares Short Were 102.30 million what is interesting is that the percentages was 20.01. To me this is something to keep an eye on going forward.Why? Because we now know via the share recount that 4.1 million a p e s own almost 80% of free float.The reason I believe we need to keep a close eye on this, is the stock exploded the following week after May 28th.Now as of June 22nd shares on loan are 93.68 million. In other words there are less than 9 million shares available to borrow as of June 22. The data I get on this is 2 days behind due to the T+2 rule. Yesterday shorts added approximately 1 million shares to this total and as of this moment today they have added about 2.7 million. which would be about 97.4 million.There could be around 4.5 million shares left to borrow for shorts before they reach the 20% threshold of free float. As of the 22nd 18.32% of the free float had been borrowed. Add another 3 million as of right now and that has to put us over 19%.This is how I see it, shorts are closing in on doomsday. I am not giving a date of expectation but at this rate shares to borrow will be gone soon. As long as a p e s continue to hold 80% of float, this is the predicament shorts find themselves in.If shares on loan reaches 102.30 million, there should be no more shares to borrow.Remember the date was May 28th, look what happened the following week as an example."
There is too much misinformation floating around that is intended to destabilize the Ape Army. Anyone who has seen the Adam Aron interviews on Trey's Trades knows that the CEO is against the hedge funds. The proposed 25M shares will not be used against the Ape Army. Watch the interviews to get a history lesson on how previously authorized shares were used. The silverback is on our side.
"Listen it is simple when you look at charts and also look in depth at the options change and how they coincide.AMC is still stair stepping higher every week. We are in a channel between $53.75 and $62 that has now consolidated nicely for the last 2 weeks for the most part. For the last several sessions we have closed in the upper echelon of this channel at $59.40 $60.37 and now $59.26. A majority of the trades over the last 2 sessions when combined occurred at over $60. This is a very bullish pattern as we had 2 small consolidation markers over the channel at above $62.What occurred Friday was a marketwide dump. and once the price was below $60, hedgies were also able to dump the shares they had purchased to hedge the $60 call options. Rather than drive the price down to the low $55 which would have caused even more dumping of hedged shares, AMC fought back and prevented that and closed higher at $59.26.This was the danger we faced with so many options in the money was a potential dump and we not only survived it we beat it.All of this suggests AMC is ready to go forward on Monday and hedgies are all the weaker for it.Now on to the options chain. For the last several months a deep dive into the options chain has show a 55 to 44 ratio in call options to put options. This suggests a somewhat evenly divided chain with hedgies able to mitigate potential losses fairly well.But as we moved into June and look forward at July August September and even further out, Call options are now at a 65% to 35% ratio. Taking it a step further and looking at the $145 calls, more and more are being purchased at costs of 1200 to 1900 per call options. A look over at the PUT chain shows that Puts at a similar cost basis are for the most part not being purchased.The fact that call options are being purchased at 2.5Xs the rate as PUT options is tremendously bullish and the fact that there is hardly any hedging at PUT levels comparable to the $145 call options is an even more bullish signal.Take it for what it is worth but AMC is EXTREMELY EXTREMELY bullish no matter what any shill on this board says and to even remotely think otherwise or to have any ounce of fear is unwarranted.When you look at the growth of the short interest over the past week as compared to previous weeks, shorts are digging a hole so deep, that when this lets go its going to be a disaster for the last few remaining shorts.In my opinion once we break over $60s and start to consolidate again above $62.50 or wherever it may land, there will be some shorts who will start to cover. I do not believe this wee be too far off."
Do NOT get distracted with other squeeze plays. AMC IS THE ULTIMATE PLAY!!!!

Should I get a home equity loan for more shares? Then buy 15 more houses after the squeeze?
"As retail investors, we don't have access to super computers to manipulate the stock price of any stock. But HF do. Now Motley wants to blame us for buying and holding. Really? When you buy and hold over a year. You pay less in taxes in that calendar year. But now al of a sudden. You want us to sell. And subject ourselves to a swing trade liability in taxes. When. the tax code clearly favors buy and hold. Especially now that you've gotten caught making to many cookies. And you want us to return them so you can clean up your mess. No thanks, we'll do it for you. And don't go away mad, just go away."
Citadel is also in United Kingdom’ and Ireland CCEU and EUCC and all kinds of eye brows should be up remember Goldman sax just did a huge reverse repo with bank in england / lots of jpmorgan jane street and black rock are all working together to screw retailers and the US markets LOL

SEC pressure is here!!!! Be patient they still have some days left to cover but these next ten days should be wild. Keep up the positive vibes as this is a buying opportunity for new investors and old alike.
"Robert posted low volume, why because we own over 80 % of the float and when you are consolidating and getting nearer the tip of the bullish wedge the stock takes a breather. The high volume of the past may also have been due to high frequency trading to control the stock. We are sitting beautiful."
"If we all APES stick together for real and try to keep buying feel share everytimewe can that would keep us alive and STRONG.In the last 6 months I was ablt to acumulate 489 share and I'm going to get to 500 soon, just waiting for my 2 days weekend OT and WT."
Back to $40 tomorrow and let's make the shorts get shorter I'm holding since I bought in for $25.25!!! 
I urge you to have a look right this second at the AMC 5 day chart using 5 min intervals to see the prcemoving below the 200 day average as I speak. This is going to be their biggest push down today. HOLD FOR THE GOLD..!

Who would bet that Citadel goes bankrupt before AMC or GME?
"28 years old here and having a great year. Full time job since 19 years old, bought a pre construction house about 7 years ago that has now appreciated a couple hundred grand, made $40,000.00 profit on Aphria, and have bought in close to 1000 shares around the $12 per share average here. Still going to hold until the squeeze. I know a good opportunity when I see one. In the world of crooked manipulation only made to help the rich. You need to make smart decisions. This is seriously the play right now. Lots of money will be made for those who stick around and we’re not talking $100 a share. Even if you get cold feet and sell early I’d imagine that would around the $140 per share mark. But being completely conservative.. $400-$1000 is going to come really quickly"
"There will be no bag holders, shorts need to close all positions, and we hold 80% of the float and there are 4 billion shares and only 500 million actual floated shares, non of us can lose."

nice it feels good to be on green again. almost sold this one but good thing I give it a breather. my position is unchanged 11k shares still holding since February.
I can work for another 20 years or hold amc for 1-2 years until shorts cover? I’ll hold and buy more!
AMC has now eclipsed yesterday's volume total by 1 million shares at 1:35pm and we've just gotten started... GO LONGS..!
Massively shorted and still holding strong - just think about that. When it goes above 80 and 100 don’t say I should of bought moreNot for sale

I'd rather lose my investment than sell. Ever since I started trading (2008) I've watched good companies I invested in go south due to manipulation. Almost impossible to gain anything.

"Today Range was 38.76 - 49.79 so far. That's a huge range proving that no retail investors were really selling. It was just the hedge funds shorting AMC hoping to trigger a sell off. Well, that didnt happen and we recovered quickly. This might also suggest that Hedgies are desperate as their days to lose another $10 - $30 billion are numbered.APES we are holding DIAMOND HANDS.

It’s like shorting using a high interest credit card. Right now it’s 18%. Citadel has the worst business plan in the history of the stock market. I’d be resigning too. Squeeze inevitable. Hodl

21% gains and AMC isn't even put on the trending list. Good job Yahoo...
"Shorting a stock equals infinite loss potential.Buying a stock equals losing the money you invested. They call us names for buying stock they shorted and the more money we make the more money they lose. They say we are risk takers for gambling with money we have, while they gamble with money they don't have and if they lose they are bankrupt. Five people in my immediate family have invested in AMC because we like the stock and we like the movie theatre. I am going to hodl till the squeeze however long it takes."
Anyone else see those F9 box office numbers? Yeesh. I’d be sweating if I was HF or shorting right now.
"Did you guys see the new info that’s come out about dark pools? Such a shame. 47% of retail investors stocks they bought were sold on the dark pools, but not even on the dark pools it was through Citadels other version of the dark pools where it’s not tracked by Finra and doesn’t have to be reported. So those shares are just out there floating around and not part of the Nasdaq as they try and send FUD to scare you out of your shares and prevent this squeeze from happening. Citadel is not playing fare."
HF getting nervous. Spent billions dropping price artificially all with one aim: Scare us to sell. And it’s not happening. They are running out of time and expected more bang for this buck. I riding this out.
"in the end it doesn't matter they are using more short shares to drive the price down they can not claim any profit from the stock dropping without buying the short back in, covering is a mandatory part of the shorting process it is unavoidable there is absolutely no way to get out of a short position without buying back shares"
A lot of huge purchases today betting on AMC price climbing higher.
"the worlds greatest stock market supercomputers take half an hour to get the close price correct, wonder how wrong it is all day? if it takes half an hour to get it right at close, was that surge up to 59 early in the day really 59 or was it higher and we just don't get the real story?"
Funny how they can take a stock down this much even if retail owns the float
Leaks and whispers are saying that the real price of AMC is 5K per share…. Big institutions are loading up and so am I. ￼
"There are 12 hedge funds short on AMC as per Fintel,396 hedgefunds and institutions long on AMC.The time has come for them to square off.I don't see any way out for those smaller ones short on AMC.

"I made a long post a couple of days ago, and I will reiterate a few points here, particularly for our new apes. Nowadays, until the squeeze happens, AMC stock has nothing whatsoever to do with the overall market or company fundamentals. Anyone who brings this up is distracting you in the hope that you would panic and sell. I am holding my shares. I admit that it is much easier for me to hold, since I've been in this since 13 dollars, and whether I see 50 dollars gain per share or 45 or 55 is all great. But if you got in at 40s, 50s, even 60s, fear not my fellow apes, much brighter days are ahead. Remember, if AMC fundamentals did play a role for now, the stock would've dropped already, since it's been three weeks that we've been in the 50s. If HFs and some of the mainstream media that echo negativity and FUD could drop the stock, they would've succeeded by now, but they haven't. Ask yourself why in the world then is AMC trading at near 60s. What could possibly be the reason? Why hasn't it dropped to 30s or 20s already. Again, the answer is rather simple. Vast majority of apes are holding and winning. There are a few HFs that are long AMC, and they are winning and not selling. The volumes that you see are high frequency traders and probably short HFs that volley shares back and forth, but at the end of the day, AMC continues to slowly but surely rise because we have new apes that are buying and holding. Week by week we are rising. What then, if not AMC fundamentals or overall market, matters when it comes to AMC stock. I think the answer is apes buying and holding, causing some FOMO, and more importantly some gamma squeezes, that is causing AMC to continue its meteoric rise (just zoom out and look at weekly chart). Where do we go from here. My opinion is that we'd break a few technical barriers, and go above the sore points for HFs, which apparently seem to be in the 62 to 65 dollar range, considering how many times we've come close. Once we clear the 65ish range, and close above that, the next would be mid 70s. It takes a couple to a few of barriers that we need to cross before you see sudden jumps that'll cause circuit breaks, and before you know it, short squeeze(s) will happen. Keep in mind that not all HFs will necessarily cover at the same time, so don't assume that once you see a short squeeze that, say, takes the stock from 70s to 100 (for example), that this would be the end of short squeeze and game over after this. No, there could be multiple such rises and a series of short squeezes over several days. In fact, it is entire possible that we may see a very persistent but drawn out squeeze that will take us into hundred over a longer period of time. Just keep your mind open, don't assume things, and play day by day, by being patient and committed. At the end of the day, do what is best for you, and do your independent research. Above is just my opinion and I am holding my shares until I become convinced that HFs have covered. One last point, I would not assume that after HFs cover, that the stock would necessarily drop to what it was a couple of months ago. Again, GME did go through one squeeze, and yes the stock did drop, but it was nowhere near as low as it once used to be, and in fact over a few subsequent months, GME grew back to above 300. I bet many people thought GME would never ever ever reach even above 100 (after it dropped from the peak of 483ish after the first squeeze), but clearly they were wrong. Same thing with AMC. I am convinced that this will have an incredible rise with huge gains for many apes, followed by a drop, but I don't think it'll drop to teens. I think it will be much higher and may continue to rise again. GLTA (except shorts. haha)."
this is not financial advice.. this is just a strategy.APE strategy is just to simply Buy & Hold. That is what destroys hedge fund AI bots predicting sentiment. Thats all that I will be doing. The stock can drop 20% tomorrow... Il be holding. we bounced back 40% in one afternoon and up 400% in 1.5 months. remember short squeezes are real. hedge funds have not bought back their borrowed shares.
"How shorts are feeling , having sold their shares at 10 and carrying 500 % losses"
"We own the float , short interest have been increasing and gamma is about to happen soon , are you sorry for hedge fund ?"
If anyone happens to do the math: 9B synthetic shares==>$4.5 Trillion; 26B synthetic shares==>$13 Trillion that shorts will likeky bankrupt. The DTCC has $67 Trillion to bail out Citadel.
Is it ok for retailers to print up new shares at home or is that only ok for market makers? Asking for a friend.
Were going today!!!! Everytime we test that $60.00 is another dent in it before it crumbles! Stay Long. STAY STRONG! APE POWER.
Yahoo deleting my post so let me make it short and to the point-002 forces hedgie to short on the open market rather than the massive amounts they cannot afford in the dark pools- So short interests rises and quickly at that.- Market makers love what they see and will drive the price up to squeeze the new short positions in the 57-70 range. This is when volume increases and then FOMO. - when we pass through this range the squeeze begins as shares available to short on the market become limited and there is no choice but to close their positions.- this does not include synthetic shares and the FTDs being ignored.- we can not assign a date but with rising short interest the sharks will come out to okay and drive AMC upwards and soon. -
"HOLD AND ADD MONDAY! Yahoo finance just even said it. The shorts have not covered! They think we're going to fold. I'm buying more Monday!! AMC king kong of Russel 2000. MOASS! HODL!!! The article, ""When it comes to AMC stock it's a matter of when, not if."""
"the market manipulators are trying to make you sale, don't sale, instead buy more and hold with a Good strategies I was recommended to Ortex_Fx ,, On Telegram platform , the professional has an accurate trading strategies . And also stay ahead of market signals . It is imminent, soon the shorts are going to have to buy and the short squeeze is gonna send the price to the moon, stay calm and you are going to multiply your investment"
"At this point , out enemy is not Citadel or other HFs .. at this point our only enemy is our emotions that might force us into panic selling. Citadel - Ken Griffin already talked about it and he is confident that APES are like Bears ..look at the charts … HFs are scared and they are trying their best , their last attempt.. they are only betting on emotional weakness. They are heavily shorted when the price was around $10 .. they can’t logically drag the price that low because they are dealing with APES - HODL Pressure is on HFs to cover their position .. at any point if the stock crosses $63 and then $77, it will automatically trigger Margin calls- FOMO - panic covering and thats limit less upside. Think about it .. not a financial advice."
"There is something very wrong here. If yahoo is blocking messages that either favor/don't favor specific companies, then this could be considered to violate SEC trading laws. - could someone with connections to trey/matt/another big youtuber get them to talk about this? imagine if someone filed a lawsuit on Yahoo for this"
I have moved all my assets 23k in to AMC form SPCE while it's an only chance for me to go to the moon soon
Not sure about other investors but I find it entertaining to see all of these paid shills. The idea that they believe they are being smart and that no one has caught on to why they are trolling a message board for which they have no connection is funny and sad at the same time. It is sad that they are being paid per post by the guy who throws them a turkey at thanksgiving and gives them an 'AMC' gift card at Christmas while asking them to his 'illegal bidding' so that he can remain in hiding and plan his next illegal attack on AMC
Bears still playing on the possible covid third wave card. does that change the fact that amc stock is naked shorted into billions and we own more then 80% of the float? NOPE.
"Today's move bodes incredibly well for AMC and not to be underestimated. Remember, earlier this morning, this dropped to 38.76 and it bounced by 10 dollars from that low. Think about it. That is an almost 25% increase from the bottom! Moreover, it did so with large volume. Check the daily volume for the past few days, and it has been in around 50-60 million shares, except yesterday which was around 94 million shares. But today, we are already above 105 million shares and there is 3 hours left in the market. So we've move 25% from the bottom with large volume. Huge amounts of buying is what is happening, not to be confused with short squeeze. Vast majority of shorts have not covered. Some may have covered today, but short shares are still above 90+ million shares based on Ortex. Before today, we've had 7 days (except one in the middle) of dropping, and this was the bottom. The best shorts could do was to bring this down to 38-40 dollar range which is a huge support level, and we bounced very nicely from that. I personally believe we're set for another run to mid 50s in the next few days and testing low 60s very shortly. Another thing that is quite significant is that before the past few days drop, we were settling around mid 50s with low volatility with some chance of breaking out up or possibly down. Unfortunately, it moved down, and we saw that in the last few days. Now, it is clear we survived the down trend, tested major support at 38-40, and did NOT fall below that. This gives me more confidence that in the near future, people just have to accept that this stock is a stock that's trading in the 50s irrespective of the fundamentals. Just look at the price action in the last month to see what I mean. What is next? I believe mid 50s, test of low 60s, and very likely squeeze. Again I don't have timeline nor would I state any timelines. I just follow the trends and whenever I can buy at the dips. Above is just my opinion and not any financial advice. You do what is best for you. For me, the best is to hold and wait. I can tolerate to see my huge gains fluctuate. I was fortunate to get in at around 13 and added more on the way up, but some of you may have bought above 50 and might be down. So good luck to you, and I think you will be a winner. Patience pays off. I cannot overstate the importance of this stock being in the 50s for so long, after all the talk and FUD in the media saying the price is not justified by fundamentals. What matters now is that most apes are holding and shorts don't know what to do."
Stay in don’t sell. Squeeze is coming shortly !!!!!!
"Hundreds of millions of shares for AMC may have been sold and the hedges need to buy back.This is why they didn't close at 5 dollars. Hold you r shares, each one is worth a bar of gold."
"AMC investors: It is easy to spot the paid shills but also understand, there are fake longs who gradually give themselves away by their comments. They will soft bash the stock and will increase their bashing based on the comments from you. When you are a participant in what we are seeing here on AMC message thread (psychological warfare), it is important to know and understand who you can depend upon as a source of information. The hedge funds have been and are proficient at identifying patterns and using emotions to gain the upper hand. They have been doing this for many years and we have been complaisant, that is, UP TO NOW. AMC is not only a play to gain a significant amount of money but it an awakening by the common investor in which they sending a message that THEY ARE NO LONGER GOING TO SIT IDLY BUY WHILE HEDGE FUNDS STEAL THEIR CAPITAL THROUGH ILLEGAL TACTICS TO PAD THE POCKETS OF THEMSELVES, THEIR FAMILIES, THEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR WEALTHY CLIENTELE!!!"
"At this point, the financial press is no longer pretending to be objective. Their purpose is a show of force. It's just part of the program to manipulate the market. They don't just drive down the price, it's a show of force that they can. That blank look in Kenny's eyes is there to project an entitled authority. Yet, Main St is standing it's ground and on the offensive. Buy orders out number sell orders 2:1. They can keep kicking the can down the road. But we're coming for them."
"Just now raised my total shares to 5000. Been here since January. BUY and HODL seems to be working out. I’m up 462%. Trust the process and stick together, for each other. 1 share or 10000, we do this TOGETHER."

We will find out Monday I am sure via news articles just how costly week ending 6/18 was for shorts, not only in AMC, which I am sure they lost over 2 billion last week, but from an overall market perspective. It seems all companies that had big options calls closing were crashed.We are in the drivers seat handily, and if 002 passes on Monday June 21, the hedgies will no longer be able to manipulate the markets on a daily basis as has been the case forever. Intra day liquidity checks are going to be the death of over leveraged hedge funds. With only 1 hour to regain compliance for those who find themselves over leveraged, they will find themselves liquidated if they fail to regain compliance and margin calls will happen rapidly perhaps during market hours even. Usually these occurrences happen in premarket and after hours but 002 could really change that instantly."
"Average short position 2 weeks ago approx $12. Last Friday aprox $16. Guesses on this friday? I say $19. HF losing millions, but successfully avoiding the squeeze.Time is running out. We need some urgency."
Tune out the noise and realize that patience pays. I've been in since January and I've also been in plenty of opportunities where I missed out on huge gains for a lack of patience. NIO was one of my biggest mistakes. In at 2.64 out at 3.19. patience=big money. #notfinancialadvice
"No more AMC shares to borrow, so how will they cover all the ITM call options???"
BUY >> HOLD >> WIN!HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
This is the power behind AMC. Don't be fooled by media or articles you read. We're winning and it's only the beginning. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VquB2sJNeiI&feature=youtu.be
they have no more shares to short... I foresee upward movement today
They are gonna try and short it to 26 and leverage a single tute to sell.... won't work
"Been in AMC for a few weeks now and pretty much every outlet is showing this as a sell with a PT of less than 10 dollars but weve been consolidating nicely in the 50's thats with ALL the FUD, with all the BOTS trying to break down investor sentiment and with the staggering amount of short shares being thrown at us daily but the word is already out. You come to AMC BUY some shares and HODL !! THAT message has spread like a fire and it's been holding for weeks!"

For this reason the community speculates Citadel securities is a sinking ship."
Who is been holding since January with me and been adding more shares regardless price up and down?I am
"AMC Pre-Market is showing a 7th straight day of decreasing volume which is lining up great for a gamma squeeze; however, if you have options expiring today that are currently OTM or even ITM but chasing a losing premium, I do not believe you’re likely to get much increase today. Prediction for the day is overall green but with a closing point of $57.60-$58.20."
They are routing trades....taking exchange rates....and the real price of AMC is 688.12!
"AMC made this list last Friday.What Is a Threshold List?A threshold list, also known as a Regulation SHO Threshold Security List, is a list of securities whose transactions failed to clear during the previous trading days. Threshold lists are published in accordance with regulations set out by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Regulators review this information as part of their efforts to detect market manipulation.This is the SEC trying to enforce the rules. Good for them & us."
Wow. Yahoo finance is now shilling for the hedge funds.
"If you've seen the Adam Aron interviews on Trey's Trades, then you know the silverback is very anti-hedge fund. And let's not forget that no one knows when the MOASS will happen. But in no particular order, here are a handful of signs to watch out for..... climbing stock price, high trading volume, market sell-offs, and news about more hedge funds failing. Keep a level head. Don't let misinformation get the best of us. MOASS will eventually happen. Adam Aron is on our side."
"Excited about the increasing short interest rate, curious to see what it will be next week! Who else increased their position this week and is ready for the next rip?"
"this is exactly what happened once they drove it down to $5 a share. The FUD articles went up, the bashers intensified and a few weeks later the stock ripped! there is something big brewing!"
Share price does not reflect true supply and demand. Realistically this should be at 5x the price if you remove dark pool. Buy orders routed via darkpool and sell orders dumped on NYSE. We know the game they are playing and they got caught. This has to stop!
F9 has already vastly shattered previous post pandemic box office sales. Weekend isnt even over. Next week weekend is holiday weekend and F9 will continue to smash revenue outlook! Let's Go AMC. #ApeNation

I know of like at least 6 people that have told me they are paid bashers but all six actually buy the stock behind their employers back!

"Hedgies doing all they can to hold the price down...short shares, borrow shares and then return them...they figure, hold on for awhile, and the buyers will dry up..."
"It is all a matter of perspective and interpreting the exact same data and analyzing the exact same facts. Let's look at the data. Today, according to Ortex, roughly 9 million shares were borrowed and shorted at a roughly 500 million dollar cost. The HFs combined half a billion dollars, built a nuclear bomb, and threw it at the ape community, and the damage was a mere 6% drop. In other words, my massive gain that's been in deep green since 13 dollars, was reduced by 6%. This is true of anyone who bought at 60 dollars or lower. Now, with these additional 9 million shares that were borrowed today, we are left with far fewer shares to borrow and short tomorrow. The utilization rate is at about 94% or so. You check Ortex. This means that in a day, or at most 2, there won't be any more shares available to borrow and short this stock, and the allowable shares would carry a significant borrowing cost. Yes, do to market dynamics, some longs existing, some other HFs selling, there will still be some shorting, but that would be very small compared to today's 9 million shares. Keep in mind that these new shares shorted is another huge block of shares that need to be covered at some point, and adds more burden to the shorts.Given the above facts, what is a sensible conclusion? What would a reasonable person (not biased by their long or short position) would conclude? I say the most sensible observations are as follows: 1) given their best attempt to short massive shares, the damage is only in single digits (6% in this case); 2) sooner or later, most of the shares are exhausted and won't be available to short, therefore the HFs won't have this weapon against us; 3) nothing significant changed about the ape community and the fact that they own 80+% of the shares, and still not selling; 4) We are not the ones with a huge potential margin calls hanging over our heads, which means the ape community is under no pressure, tangible or psychological to get out of their positions. All in all, we are in an excellent position and I have repeatedly made that in a little more than three weeks, the HFs along with media desperately try every dirty trick under the sun, yet can't get the stock to fall from 50s. I admit that so far they have been effective at keeping us at bay near low 60s. But the ape community is like a river that will eventually find its way through any barrier, by creating little cracks and then suddenly breaking the entire barrier very violently. We've made these cracks by touching low 60s a few times, and next time we knock, it won't be to create another crack, but the break that barrier violently to get to 70s, 80s, 100s, and so on. I am confident in my position because data backs my arguments. If AMC drops to teens and single digits before a massive short squeeze, I will admit defeat. Plain and simple. But there is almost zero chance of that happening, as there is not an iota of logical reason whatsoever why AMC continues to persist in the 50s THREE weeks after it's initial rise, if not for an impending massive short squeeze due to our great ape community that continues to hodl. I have been in the market for a long time, have been long, short, done options, and survived the 2008 crash. I have NEVER EVER held on to a position like I am holding on to AMC. There is a reason for that."
I will buy and hold blatant manipulation for my brothers and sisters. We stand up to fraud and market manipulation
"Not selling, if it goes down to $52 I will double my position. I am not on a timeline, but the hedge funds are. They are borrowing with double digit interest rates to keep from covering and they are hoping we get bored or scared with fake news. Well, it is not working. Most apes only bought what they are willing to lose, so there is no pressure to sell."
Every morning for the last 5 months I’ve been waiting for the 1000% increase pre market  hopefully one day..
"NOT Financial ADVICEFor all of the new baby apes. I know a lot of you have questions, and I thought it would be helpful to provide you with some overall context to understand the significance of the movement you just joined.Here’s the cliff note version. Covid hit last March and a couple of big hedge funds concocted a plan to drive AMC into bankruptcy by “shorting” it and make a ton of money in the process. You “short” a company when you think the value of the stock is going to go down. When the country locked down and AMC closed their doors and their revenue literally went to $0 overnight, it was a no brainer play for the hedge funds. So they started borrowing millions and millions of shares from brokers and sold them “short” at the market price at the time, and they pocketed the cash from the sale. The idea is that the stock price will drop, you can buy them back later at a lower price, and then return the borrowed shares to the broker and keep the difference. If the company goes bankrupt, the stock goes to $0 and they don’t have to buy anything back at all and keep everything. This is what they were banking on. They’ve done this to company after company over the years, and they saw this as a sure thing as any. Well a bunch of people on Reddit (affectionately known as “Apes”) noticed they were trying to drive AMC, GameStop and many other retail and mortar stores into bankruptcy, and banded together to buy up all the available shares, driving up the share price. This resulted in the mini squeeze in January. But Apes didnt sell after that. And the hedge funds didn’t cover their short positions either (I.e. buy back the millions of shares they had borrowed and sold short). The Apes kept buying and buying, and holding and holding, and once the real shares were all bought up, the hedge funds doubled, tripled and quadrupled down on their short position and started making synthetic shares (IOUs) and selling those shares into the market trying to drive the price down. When the price dropped, instead of selling like the hedge funds wanted them to, Apes said “thank you very much for the discount” and kept buying more and holding. Nobody has sold for the past 5 months since the movement really got started in January, and more and more people are jumping in and adding more everyday. Now because of all of the synthetic IOU shares the hedge funds have created to keep shorting AMC, us Apes likely own more way more shares than are actually supposed to exist (as much as 6x-8x by some estimates). But real or synthetic, each share the hedge funds sold short is a liability on their books that must be bought back in order to close out their position. They literally have hundreds of millions of shares, possibly billions, to buy back, and we own them all. They have to buy them back eventually, and every day that the borrowed short shares are still on loan, the hedge funds are paying interest to the brokers they borrowed them from. Meanwhile it costs us nothing to hold. Things started to come to a head a couple weeks ago because the interest rate on the borrowed shares was reported to be as high as 250% (1-2% is normal for your average stock), so the hedge funds are collectively paying hundreds of millions of dollars every day just to hold their position, and a lot of them are starting to miss the payments and margin calls could be coming very soon. That’s when the fun starts. At that point, the broker forces them to buy back all of the hundreds of millions of shares they have borrowed and sold short, because the broker doesn’t want the hedge funds’ recklessness to fall onto them. And remember, the Apes own all the shares and aren’t selling. The hedge funds can only buy a share for what an Ape is willing to sell it for, and us Apes really love our shares. Once the margin calls start, the computers just start buying back all of the shares at the best available price no matter what that price may be. They all have to be bought back. Everything must be settled. And if the cheapest price an ape is willing to sell for is 1,000, or 10,000 or 100,000, well then that’s what the hedge funds will be forced to buy the borrowed shares back for in order to close out their position. Apes are going to hold and hold and hold driving up the price further and further to make the hedge funds bleed as much as possible until they are inevitably forced to buy back their millions of shares. They will need to buy our shares, and we set the price. And remember, it costs us nothing to hold. This movement has been building for the past 5 months, but you just heard about it yesterday. One thing Apes don’t do is set dates for the squeeze. Nobody knows when it will happen, all we know for sure is that the math says it’s inevitable as long as we hold."
"Let the price rise begin the gamma squeeze are ready and fired up, AMC over $100 this week, maybe into the low thousands."
"A simple explanation as to why we will go up soon enough. - short interest has gone up quickly and by quite a percentage. Why? 002 is making it so HFs have to short more out on the open market rather than the massive amounts shorted in dark pools. This indicates that SI would be much much higher as it does not take into account all of the previous shorting having taken place in dark pools. Mind you AMC has faired well despite attacks both inside and outside of the NYSE. - volume is low and why is this a good thing? With short interest rising the market makers are waiting but not for much longer. The market makers see rising interest as blood in the water. They will come in to push the price as high as they can to force margin calls. The volume at this point will spike quickly as a result of these trades.- what can hedgie do? They can continue shorting all they like on the open market and eventually will cover due to the buying pressure. This game has costs them too much and is pricier everyday. The shares on the open market to short are limited and their fuel tank, not ours, will run dry and then it’s time to put more fuel in our tank."
"If shorts do not close before share count it will be a huge mistake. If we find out that the float is much bigger than currently advertised, the days to cover may turn into weeks to cover or even worse, if they have to buy more shares than us retail own, we could all just hold and name our price before the action even starts. Why would we even sell one share."
Warren Buffett is a surprise winner from AMC's surging stock — his company owns a chunk of the cinema chain's landlord
"Just called my local AMC theatre to see if they had information on the MOASS. Lady on the phone said, ""Please HOLD"". I said' ""Absolutely!"""
If we close this for Trey above 60 ! It will be the greatest day of AMC ! I know we can do it Light tap
Buy and hold! Retail investors are winning!
We got it over $54. WHoa Whoa . That 1 penny burnt almost 28000 puts or 2.8MM shares. UnbelievableAn amazing day. Well done APES. Thats why holding the float controls the script.

"AMC Entertainment (NYSE: $AMC) Explodes +22% Higher As We Reveal Our Newest Trade Idea LIVE from Bora Bora, French Polynesia  Link >> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCbUjnc6j58"
My comment about citadel playing off emotions got deleted for the third time in the last 2 days.
"Well it's sure been a busy week or so for AMC... a quick recap;1. SR-DTCC-2021-005 is filed, designed to curb future failure-to-delivers and the creation of synthetic shares.2. Charles Schwab increases margin requirements on AMC to 100% (long) and 200% (short).3. London-based hedge fund White Square Capital announces it's closure, the fund once totalled around $440,000,000 and made approx. 19% profit last year. Despite this they suffered large losses shorting GME, AMC and others in January. The company stated that it's business model was no longer viable with two large investors pulling their capital. All eyes are now on Melvin and Light Street Capital as two more big January short losers. Melvin you recall had to be bailed out by Citadel to the tune of $2.75bn in order to avoid being margin called.4. AMC is moved onto the NYSE 'Threshold List', meaning 0.5%+ of outstanding shares failed-to-deliver for 5 consecutive days (12,500,000+ shares).5. Just before market close on Friday two large call sweeps were placed on AMC with a strike price of $145, expiring mid-December. Premiums for the two bets alone were around $2,000,000. Others bought the same option taking the total bets on it above $4,000,000.6. On it's opening weekend, F9 (fast and furious) took over $70,000,000 in the US and over $400,000,000 globally. The largest US box office weekend since Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker... Cinema is back.Now please may I have another banana and a red crayon, I'm hungry."
I am very happy with the HF and the shorters holding out. I am a working man. d I collect my pay checks it continues to give me the opportunity to increase my share counts. I will keep buying on every opportunity that I have. Making best use of my investment in AMC as time drags along. Thanks you HF and Short sellers. You are making my dream come true.
I'll buy the dips today!!!! buy hold repetition.. love the stock!!
Lol they try all thing to drop this price. Manipulation. Nobody is selling. We own 80% of AMC.Amc will squeeze. No doubt !
SHARE: On Friday 25th $AMC appeared on the NYSE “Threshold List” This occurs when a stock has 5 or more CONSECUTIVE days of shares that failed to settle.--we may have just won all :)
Motley is attempting to compare AMC to Cinemac. Pumping it as a soon to be short squeeze. He of course forgot to mention that Citadel owns the majority of that company and we don’t CARE if it’s shorted and goes bankrupt. Citadel is heavily invested in it. It’s a distraction in hopes that people buy the stock so citadel can offset its AMC losses. We like the AMC stock!
"Googling AMC stock - 2nd article? ""AMC Slips as other Meme stock rockets"". The stock in question? CLOV, up 3.8%. as AMC is down 2.6%...I don't even think they're trying anymore..."
Don't make a case where you sell 100 shares now and later become expensive and can't buy 10 shares.
Didn't gamestop drop wayyy down to $48 before the surge to $400? Thought so.
"Class action law-suits coming to a theater near you. Rumor has it that the share price these Hedgies will have to buy back those synthetic shares will make us all rich , there’s billions of of these fake shares they will need to cover ."
Okay I have more friends buying today on the open and later today
Turn off share lending..they are running out of options... they r so desperate..!!!
I'm curious if anyone can explain this for me. let's say all the rumors are accurate and the short position is significantly higher than reported with synthetics etc. let's go on the basis of 2 to 1. if 80% is owned by retail and some institutions let's say 400mil and theres 1 billion shorted shares. how could hf possibly close out their positions?

"On Wednesday, market makers, which are also DTCC clearing members, will have to tighten up their short-selling belts. Because their available capital will be contrasted more frequently with member deposits, their ability to maintain massive short positions is slated to be crippled.Current State of the AMC/GME SagaIn case you haven’t yet grasped the basics of short selling, here is a brief recap of basic indicators (we’ll get to the breaking news afterward). The foremost among them is the short interest percentage, referring to the number of shorted shares divided by outstanding shares.According to Ortex data, as of today, both AMC and GME stocks have relatively high estimated short interests, AMC at 13.64% and GME at 14.54% (17% on May 28) of free float.Above 10% is considered high, while above 20% is extremely high, which translates to more investors thinking the stock price will fall. Of course, bullish short squeezers tend to use this metric as an opportunity to buy the dip, counting on the stock to rebound.￼￼AMC and GME price moves in 2021, source: TradingViewRegarding the free float, also called public float, it refers to the number of shares available for public trading by using the following formula:Free float = outstanding shares – restricted shares – closely-held sharesWith these two metrics in mind, we arrive at the short-interest ratio, as the number of shorted shares divided by average daily trading volume. This is one of the key factors that enter the consideration when to take short positions. The higher it is, the longer it would take to repurchase the borrowed shares, which is why it is commonly known as the days-to-cover ratio.A ratio above 10 would indicate a negative outlook on the stock. As of May 28 report, AMC’s short ratio was 0.7 with 20.3 million shares sold short, while GME’s short ratio was at 1, with 11.97 million shares sold short. Meaning, they were both bullish indicators."
"Shorts have NOT covered...I repeat, shorts have NOT covered!"
my paper tax credit check will clear tomorrow morning. will use all of it to buy AMC shares first thing tomorrow morning!
"What I like is these so called smart moneys guys are to smart to realize that, we are not going any where until every single short synthetic shares is covered. So with that being said I love the consolidation and the slow grind upward, that means they are adding more synthetic shares. I can not express how I greatly appreciate what these HF shorting are doing. This will be a once in a life time event for us."
"Let’s put it this way, if we haven’t sold by now, we ain’t selling until we break some hedgies. None of the psychological games will work. None of the paid bashers comments will work. None of the bad press or name calling will work. We want to see happen to the hedgies what they tried to make happen to our beloved AMC. WE ARE NOT GOING AWAY! Keep holding. Keep buying. Keep the faith. This is our time!"
"AMC investors: Remember that 'buy' orders are being parked and 65% or higher orders being routed through dark pools .Therefore, if you want this to stop occurring, you can either switch to a broker that does not route through Citadel or change order flow preferences."
"Really wish I could see inside these hedge funds homes when they have to tell their families they can't afford the lifestyle that they are a custom to.. LMAO sorry honey will have to get rid of the maid, sorry honey we can't afford that private school anymore for kids, sorry honey we have to downsize because I had to sell all my assets because I did a bad business deal. I would love to see the wife's reaction to all this. One day it will be a show some hedge funds wife will come out and be like we're doing a reality show"
"Keep holding, APES! This low volume consolidation phase is good! Just be patient. It costs us nothing to HOLD! #MOASS #AMC to the #MOON! "
"Just spoke to seasoned broker. The dark pool trading is huge with AMC. There is a lag time on when it actually reflects on the ticker price. That is why Citadel is using the dark pool to not only short ladder with buys, but also cover on the dark pool to minimize spiking in price. They can do this for a bit, but eventually will catch up to them. In other words, they can only delay the inevitable squeeze, they cannot prevent it."
..Beautiful AMC Shares! ....loading up Big Time on the DIPS!!

"Joke of the day !!!MF says that AMC shares are manipulated, but not by Wall Street, it's manipulated by retail investors "
"Indicators shows a 75% chance, increasing from 71%, of closing over $59 today. Depending on mid day trading."
"Amc F9 this weekend , green after hours, beautiful wedge forming on the charts, shorts adding more short positions, short interest reported increasing to 18%, but we know it's a lot higher than that, good week ahead."
I received a dividend last night. You know what that means…more AMC!!!
"Its just a matter of when we will have another Double Day, not if. At just under $55 per share this stock is sure to have its day where we see $120+ real soon. I also have high hopes we move from the Russell 2000 index and slide into the Russell 1000 index next quarter. We have prevailed against the short sellers and we will continue to do so! Big hedge-fund spectators pay people to bash this stock and write false articles about where this stock is headed. Rest assured there's no going back, around here we don't look back we look forward. This is not about the numbers its about the naked short selling hedgefunds banding together to bring this stock down on one hand and Strong Confident Apes banding together to buy and hold this stock for dear life until we can force those hedgies to buy back the shares they short. Also known as a Short Squeeze.We will prevail. We are Apes. Keep doing what we do Apes. We buy we hold we hold some more! In the end the hedgies shorts liars thieves will hit a brick wall and this will hit the ceiling. Lets go, 2021 is our year, its the year of the Ape!Don't think about it, just do it! Buy, Hold keep Hodling."
"It will take weeks, months even, for all short positions to be covered. And that’s the ones we know about . The slight gamma we experienced at the beginning of June was due to a margin call of just 1% of outstanding shorts. Our price went up 3.5x and there is no reason to think it won’t do that again. I’m aiming high, but I do believe the share price will be near the $200 range by Friday. "
Ortex estimated short interest up 1.18%+ the estimating the short interest to be 18.94% of free float
AMC Strong!!! Doing great on this down market day!!!
They shorted the entire float in the dark pool and the floor is still rising. Let that sink in.
"Hey everyone, happy Sunday  let’s have a good week my friends, another brick in the wall as we keep holding for the cause.No emotions involved for me anymore, just numbers and facts. I hold, you gold, we are gold."
I love this chat. Stock goes $60 to $59. And all these bashers are out in full force.
STILL HOLDING!! I CAN DO THIS FOREVER!!
AMC squeeze will have 2 outcomes:1. Life changing tendies...2. Citadel Closure
"They have algorithms to short and sell off our emotions. They have television media. They have FUD articles and hit pieces. They have social media with bots and paid bashers. They pay for all this and pay billions in fees on top of it.They laughed at us then 1 went out of business. Now news outlets not affiliated with Hedges are listening and SEC kind of adjusting rules (we will see).All we pay for is our shares and costs nothing to hold. If this thing go sideways to $50 or dips because of shorting, I don't care, I am here all the way. I will add. They can cover some but not all. No way they can cover naked/synthetic. Boom.I will hold past $100 just to shake hands looking for a quick buck if that's all they want. I easily see $125 but I want min $500. Do we get there? Who knows. But we have to hold if we want to. (Volkswagon hold) Diamond hands to $1000 and beyond.I am Ape.That's just me. Do your own."
So awesome! I moved funds around expecting to buy around 60. I got more at 55. Thanks to consolidation!
No matter how today plays out you can expect a gap up on Monday because the new fast and furious box office numbers will be significant. HF and MM know this. They’re will be a bump coming near eod or after market tonight / pre market Monday. Hodl.
BIG consolidation between 2pm and 4pm today. Very good.
we cracked $60 with ease . imagine if the momentum keeps up! you are investing in a company who had debt to no debt. Who struggled through the pandemic. With each and everyone's support the theaters will survive . we will see 100s soon. apes stronger together
"It's the same story everyday when the price starts ripping higher, and then the hedges dip into their bag of tricks with short ladder attacks, routing our buy orders to dark pools, etc. The apes are holding long and strong, so this is not directed towards them, but this is a reminder for everyone else to not allow them to cause you to lose heart and give up, because that's exactly what they are counting on. What they are not counting on is they're not dealing with the same breed of traders that they are used to. Their dirty tactics won't last forever. If for no other reason, they can't continue the pain of paying interest on millions of shorted shares forever. If they're going to try, let's force them to keep doing so until they finally crack and realize we're not going anywhere and it's over for them."
"$AMC, no more shares to borrow!!!https://twitter.com/antoniothemexi/status/1409722779243585536?s=21"
HOLD FOR GOLD!
Zack’s has upgraded AMC to #2 (BUY) based on fundamentals. Strong revenues expected to continue.
"Bloomberg ""AMC stock (ticker: AMC) jumped 5% on Thursday morning, to about $35, snapping a four-day losing streak. The shares are up more than 1,600% since the start of the year, but down some 42% from their early June highs""Up more than 1,600% since the start of the year, , oh what will we do with our losses Shills ╭∩╮(･◡･)╭∩╮"
Does YF really think that shutting down our AMC conversation would scare us and make us sell our shares. NOT SELLING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Buy open at market then going to the beach.. then back home to buy at the market on close... trust the process....
I just bought 500 shares of AMC. Any chance this will go GREEN today? Just asking !
"AMC is seriously about to break out like crazy, the chart is forming a tsunami rocket pattern"
how many shares does it take to manipulate this stock price...day after day....while failing to deliver shares and having millions of synthetics in the hands of retail. when will the stock price reflect the true supply and demand.
200% margin requirement needed to short AMC per Schwab and TD Ameritrade. The vice is tightening on the short positions. An easy week for AMC Apes. Hold every share you have and buy more shares if you can but be smart with the money you use to do it with. Enjoy the ride.
"Definitely voting no for the extra shares Adam requested. Probably wouldn’t affect us anyway but honestly why help him. He could have helped himself by letting the stock keep soaring up higher before selling instead of causing us a delay. He played himself and that’s not our issue. He said the stock isn’t his priority or concern, the company is. Okay well the company isn’t OUR concern, the share price is. Glad we’re at an understanding"
"I can't speak for you but I'm just setting up price alerts on my phone. AMC will squeeze when she's ready to squeeze. You can't put a specific date/time on it, and it isn't good for your health to just sit and stare at the chart all day. Check in with Roensch Capital on YT at night for a recap of AMC price action for the day and a preview of coming attractions. Wash. Rinse. Repeat. HODL. All the stress is on the shorts so let the stress rest with them. Good things come to those who wait so let this thing marinate and then get paid. This is the way."
"APES: The plan was simple, Citadel bet against AMC hoping for bankruptcy. Make lots of money and if the company went bankrupt, Citadel was off of the hook paying capital gains taxes. Citadel had/has borrowed so many stocks that if AMC would have lost, no stocks to return, thus keeping all of the profit and the person who loaned them the shares, would have lost everything. Citadel bought 3 million Cinemark shares on the long. NOW MF is working hard at convincing readers today that Cinemark has been shorted as much as AMC. This is a LIE. Citadel hopes the naïve will start buying Cinemark, so the stock price increases, they can sell off at a profit and then try and cover their AMC losses. Citadel NEEDED AMC to go bankrupt, so that Cinemark was the only major theater chain standing. Cinemark has half of the theaters that AMC does. Had AMC gone bankrupt, Citadel would have scooped up vacant AMC theaters, and sold them to Cinemark, so they could expand their visibility across the world. This is WHY WE HODL!"
I see Yahoo continues to manipulate this chat room.
"BOOM CNBCAs vaccination rates continue to rise and the number of coronavirus cases decline consumer confidence in returning to movie theaters has spiked. These audiences are also being exposed to fresh movie marketing on the big screen, which could entice them to return for future releases — particularly movies such as ""F9,"" which is only available in theaters and not being released on streaming until a later date."
The whole world buys and holds against blatant manipulation by news media’s and hedge funds
"As many of you know I like to follow charts. I ask you to go have a look at the last time on the AMC one month chartthe price fell below the 10 day average like today near the closing. Make sure you're looking at the 1 month interactive chart on Yahoo using the 10 day 50 day and 200 day averages.Also make sure you're using one day intervals. Now look back to January 10th when the price dropped below the 10 day average, what happened next? The price went from $42.81 on the 10th to $59.04 by the 15th before any real pull-back didn't it? I'm not saying that AMC will repeat a $16.23 spike again but as all of us Apes know already, it sure could couldn't it?GO LONGS..!"
"Yahoo is not showing this but there is a key indicator happening as I type.If you look at the 5 day chart a golden cross has now formed on the AMCchart with the current price, 10 day and 50 day averages all crossing up andover the 200 day average. The last time this happened was on 6/22/12 and started at the open and the price went from $55.00 to $60.00 high the following day. Just saying..."
This is the biggest opportunity in the market ever. This short squeeze is inevitable this summer
Tommmorow we need to show these cheating A-wipies who owns this stock- we need some massive buying pressure tommrow - lets get a 50% gains- remeber we own this float
Hedge funds are gonna bring price up And call that the big squeeze. to convince paper hands to sell don't sell wait for a 100k 500k 1000k.. Be prepared we will win.
"When you're questioning the sideways action in AMC, just step back and remember. Every share you buy, every share you hold, makes hedges hemorrhage cash every single day. The hedge funds are panicking, pulling every string they can to try to depress price. AND THEY ARE FAILING.They try to pay shills to post on sites like this and pretend to be terrified apes to instill fear. They borrow at HIGH COST every single day to short into the market. They use their propaganda arm, the financial media (who are their personal friends), to write articles pumping worthless companies as the next squeeze while pretending AMC has already squeezed (it hasn't even started to).All of these tactics come at MASSIVE cost to the hedge funds. And all of these tactics have produced NO BENEFITS for the hedge funds. Hedge funds are losing BILLIONS of dollars in this MOVEMENT.Have no doubt the APE ARMY is winning here. We absolutely are. The hedge funds are bleeding out... increase the pressure. Buy shares on dips. Hold your shares. Tell your friends about the insane gains you've already earned and expect in the future. APE ARMY will cause this thing to squeeze, and the hedge funds will be finished for good."
"I used to be worried. Posting 10-20 posts a day. I am down to 1-2 a day, no worries anymore. Hold strong and wait. I have plenty of time since I am much younger than these hedgies. :)"
From the low yesterday (31.15) to the close today (43.09?) is a 38% gain -- what does that even mean??? I know this stock can double sp in a day...but 38% in a DAY. I guess there is a lucky day trading Ape out there.
"The market is down due to renewed Covid fears. If you look at stocks like AMC, airline stocks, some Vegas stocks- you will probably see that the selloff began several days ago. If AMC holds the line here without tanking- it has but one way to go. And that is up."
"Everybody on here saying there's no way they're going to ""let"" AMC get back over $60.00 but I just have to ask. How did they already ""let"" AMC get up to $72.62 three weeks ago or the following day, why did they ""let"" the price hit $68.80? As recently as 4 days ago on June 18th did they ""let"" AMC run up to $64.96?You guys are delusional if you think AMC can't run back up over $60.00 and it will most likely happen tomorrow when the Golden Cross occurs on the AMC 5 day chart. In fact if you look back onto AMC's timeline you will see the last time there was a Golden Cross on a 5 day chart (5 min intervals) it began on June 17th at exactly 10:10am and AMC's price shot from $57.00 to $64.74. Be aware and stay alert fellow Apes.If the Golden Cross happens tomorrow morning we could see a very very nice return. That's today's chart info on AMC and I hope you all enjoyed it. Cheers..!"
Can AMC reach 100 million shares traded today?
TD AMeritrade and Yahoo both show 58.11 at market close - which is correct.Robinhood shows 57.98 at 4PMAnyone else seeing that?
"With the world watching this play, the options are limited is several ways. New rules put in place , listed on Threshold . The world is waiting to see if the little guy can still make a buck buying stocks in the market.No Pressure. There is no vulnerability left on this board, many hardened traders are here to win.Payday is right around the corner.If you invested your hard earned money, You should compensated with the True value of this stock."
When the volume is less than half you know people are holding strong! Wait until July 4 weekend when even more people go to the movies....im sure you can cover then shorts!
Feel free to settle FTD and other abuses. We're patient. Does not cost US a thing but TIME which is not on you side
"Shorts have to cover nearly 3M shares each day this week. Otherwise, they will soon be forcefully liquidated. It's not costing me a penny to watch this drama unfold. Hedgies, you can keep buying in DarkPools. Keep selling in lit markets. Keep sending your army of bashers and Shills. Keep ladder attacking at noon. All your tricks and algorithms are now exposed. We now know for 200% certain that hedgies cannot cover their short positions. We gave hedgies plenty of chances to cover when it was at $10, at $20, at $30, at 40 and at $50. Now hedgies shall pay and cover at a price greater than $70."
There r no longs selling at this price - we didn’t sell at 72Not for sale
AMC Is A SUPER STONK!
"whenever someone goes out of their way to tell me this is dead, it shows me how desperate they are for me to sell. Bring it on bears, shills and interns! Just looking for an excuse to buy more like when you said this was done in the 10s."
Super low volume today. I guess the hedgies shorting back and forth at a loss is the only action this stock is seeing today! Just be patient…it costs nothing to hodl!
"190 million shares at, on average, $34.... that's $6.46 billion changed hands yesterday.That's some pretty serious coin that caught that falling knife.Guess the squeeze is still on."
"AMC chart analysis for those who missed it: Bullish Ascending Triangle. When the triangle formation is complete, it'll rocket up. Lapes (ladies) and Gentleapes (gentlemen), behold, an imminent short squeeze is upon us. Charts predict this will happen Monday or Tuesday. The interesting part is once it makes a new all time high in the mid $70s, E-V-E-R-Y SINGLE SHORT will be under water. We'll see panic covering like we've not seen before from shorts, just like when AMC crossed the $36+ all time high threshold a few weeks ago. Sideline watchers and paper hand longs will FOMO chase the price, pushing it up even higher. $100+ is coming.https://photos.app.goo.gl/nkuo8cR7SeBeMJZo9"
"Just how strong is AMC? Simply look at yesterday's trading by shorts and yet we ended up a couple of pennies at days end. Now I will say this do not be alarmed by what appears to be lower volume on a daily basis, remember shorts trading between themselves is going to be much less likely to occur and the drop in volume would actually make you realize how much of the volume we had seen in the past was just that.Date Short percentage Dark Pool percentage2021-06-23 45.7 % 57.5 %I mean we were attacked yesterday based on these numbers and they could not get AMC to budge."
AMC AMC AMC… your beautiful strong resilient and gonna make a lot folks really rich if they hold strong and you know what AMC the people too are resilient and strong ok AMC… have a great evening… PS… the cash is coming and nothing less than 1000 a share or what’s the use…
"Shorts have not covered.Shorts need 10x the float the cover.We own the float.Dont forget what we’ve been through since january. Their only option is to try to wait us out with fud, shills, and short ladders.There are still over a billion synthetics that must be bought back at our price.Apes enjoy the weekends while bashers and interns play bash the stock.We all know whats coming "
Went to theatres this week for first time since Covid and I must say it feels great to support AMC in theatres and in stock market Waiting for this to take off
"Payday today! Time to load up some additional shares, anything below $100 is still a bargain imo. Look at the trend, DD and potential catalysts lining up. Whether it's next week, next month or next year, this is going to fly. Not financial advice"
"Do NOT be surprised. We may go down a bit more today but once the Consolidation is over, you will all go to the moonTrust. Patiences will pay off￼"
If you subtract 200M short shares from the float what does that put this stocks fundamental value at? Id say 200+ maybe 500?
Pullback above 35.60. Now the game starts for the upward journey. Stay united .patience is the key. If you are holding like me not planning to sell at any lower price. Reply to the message
Just bought some more. Time is on our side. Don't focus on predictions on when the squeeze will happen. It's not a moment but a process that can take weeks still. Setting your hopes on a date will just lead to potential disappointment. You're lucky to be in this position where you can change your situation by just buying and holding a stock. So just sit back and relax and enjoy the cringe try-hard basher posts. It's free entertainment ...free like holding.
Please keep shorting this more money for us. We will wait for the cheese and that's a whole lot of cheddar coming our way. GOGO SAYS HOLD FOR CHEESE!
do you know why a lot of shills and bashers are here ? Because AMC hodlers are winning!!!
"Big money plays in AMC on Friday. $600k worth of call options were made in the last 12 minutes of trading on Friday. On Sunday, a 200% margin requirement has been put in place when shorting stocks, meaning that Hedge Funds need double the amount of collateral in order to short AMC. This will make a margin call happen much much faster. Now we're seeing higher volume in the pre market than we have seen in weeks. This could be a life changing week. Thanks to all of my fellow apes that have been BUYING AND HOLDING!"
"Don't forget, we are fighting rich powerful people and they don't like to lose. Nobody wants us to win, including SEC, DTCC, THEIR INSURERS or the government BUT if we just hold the line they can't beat us without trashing the system itself.They will drag this out as long as possible but we will win.

From Kennith’s Wikipedia page for extra motivation: ‘Kennith Griffin owns an art collection valued at $800 million and personal residences valued in total at over $1 billion. His 2015 purchase of two paintings from David Geffen for $500 million represented the largest private art deal ever.’
"If this stock was crashing it would be decreasing per day around -15% we are looking soo good,….expect a big push to 70$ soon"
"You would be wrong to call this movement failed if you only looked at:- The regulation it's forced upon the financial sector- The amount of new retail investors it's brought to the table, who read all of DD, and leave no stone un-turned in their effort to educate themselves on financial dealings- The lawsuits and settlements that have been borne in the wake of itYou'd be a BIG TIME wrong to call this movement a failure if you continue to ignore the above while also ignoring the following:- The stock is up 2500% since the start of the year. - Apes will continue to be a market presence going forward.Seriously, if you're still getting paid to bash this ticker, it's time to ask your boss for a raise before he has to close up shop permanently."
Fact: the shorts havent covered I will buy and hold until they doNothing else mattersIf they keep shorting trying to knock the price dwn the price will just go higher because they still have to buy back shares and have added more.
"Folks let’s finish strong today. We done a good job so far consolidating in the 50-60s. Low volume means that people are not selling. Soon we will break through 60s and go higher and higher, consolidation after consolidation. We own AMC, not the HFs. More we hold, faster the margin call for hedgies. Let’s goooo!!!!!! "

The short squeeze hasn’t even begun. A beautiful September ahead for diamond hands
How much does it cost longs to hold again? Cheers to my future deep millionaires! 
Let's push $AMC over $47 by close.
The Netherlands. Holding strong! You hold for us. We’ll hold for you.
"one day soon, maybe today, you will leave your screen to get a cup of coffee, and when you return AMC will be $90+ and rising rapidly. Be ready."
"I don’t check my equity, I only check how many $AMC shares i have and smile.."
"NOTE TO ALL APES: those, like myself, who are new to this post, need only to scroll down when you click on most recent posts, or top reactions to find those responses which are timely and note worthy. Do not even bother responding to the myriad of no names bashing the stock. Merely mute them. Do not engage, as once you do, they probably get paid. This stock's real worth is unknown, due to the criminal elements manipulating the price. Wait them out! Buy and hold! Every share you buy is one less share the H'Funds can short you with. Should the stock dip, as it undoubtedly will, at times, due to not only votility as with manipulation, buy one or two more, further putting the squeeze on those who would have the company go bankrupt; no longer doable, due to retail investors, such as you and I, wanting to put an end to their corruption. COME TOGETHER! APES FOREVER! STRONG ARE WE! If long time holders have anything to add, please step in."
"The volume has dropped significantly and we're trading comfortably in this range between 50-60$. These Short sellers think it's dropping to 10$, just like they thought it was dropping to 5$ from 12$ back in march LOL. You would need 0 shares bought in a day and every share sold. It's literally impossible. Don't listen to the negative comments because they know 0. This stock is healthy consolidating, of course from it's peak high it's going to drop a bit, but it's already started to climb again, which is more than enough indication that there's plenty of room to run."
"Good morning all. After a very nice Monday we received a little bit of a boost via Regulation SHO last evening. Reg SHO gives us a little insight into failures to deliver. Those stocks that were supposed to be purchased but have not been. Well seems AMC Entertainment has made the threshold listing. This listing is compiled and released by the NYSE and a company is listed when FTD are in excess of .005 of the outstanding shares listed for the ticker and have been in an FTD state for the last 5 trading days. This list in many ways allows folks to see how the stock is being ""manipulated"" by short holders. The SEC is aware of this situation, so now we just have to hope they quit just watching and they start enforcing."
"Please have patience folks, we have the shares locked up and they can only try to scare you into selling. Short sellers and their associates will try all the tricks in the book in order to get you to sell, but here is why you shouldn’t:1. Low volume - ladder attacks stopped which inflated numbers anyway. 2. FOMO investors and day traders exited so the volatility is less, that is in part why this stock went down on low volume.3. Institutional buyers will be rebalancing their portfolios this week, a positive for this upcoming week, but also a negative for last week as the institutions want to purchase this at the lowest price point. Look at the valuation of AMC, it is 4x what it was at the end of last month.4. Lastly, if you are wondering who has sold and who has not sold….just know that this stock price has formed a new base because of everyone holding shares and not selling, that is why the stock held at over $50 this week!I appreciate the stock holders of AMC, I know we call ourselves Part of the Ape community. Call it what you will, I’m just glad to be part of that group. Stay safe, stay humble, and as always, stay healthy! Hold those shares, don’t let the bullies intimidate you or waiver in your stance against this movement! Good luck to all!Jersey Jimmy"
"Hey, guys. Holding for almost 7 months. I was in this sub since from the beginning and saw everything. May I offer advice? Why keep calm. You won. We have repeatedly warned new monkeys that the only tactic is psychological manipulation. Are you upset or confused by literally everything but holding your gold tickets? You became a victim. Wondering what happens to AA moods, voting, ""fatigue"" (haha, monkeys aren't tired, we're more determined than ever) or something? This is what we are referring to. ""They're everywhere. Youtube, Twitter, Reddit, right here in the comments for a moment. Their job is to spread confusion, division, doubt, impatience and whatever else will make you give up. You won. They have to cover .All the shorts have to cover and they can't while holding.It's that simple.Of all the FUD and all the media spins NO single object has NEVER opposed our DD.Not once.They have never refuted our thesis.They can't The data supports it, as does the president of the NYSE, and if you zoom out and see the big picture, so does the DTCC and other regulatory banks, moving to damage control policies (you won. and if you like stocks like me). f. That's all it takes. Believe in AMC and you will be regret Hold strong next week is a big week"
Yahoo is allowing the bashers to post negative while blocking the positive comments. They are a bought media source!
Don’t let the low volume lately scare you. It’s lower because retail investors aren’t selling!! The short interest is almost 20%. Tic tock tic tock Hedgies 
PAYDAY! Time to buy a few more AMC shares!!! Don't forget to go watch Fast 9 this weekend!!
All it will take is 1 or 2 hedges to cover with this market drop. Take your own advice HF. Don’t be the last one out. Cover. None of us are selling.
Wonder if I told my lender that I’m not gonna pay back my loans and I’d also like to take additional loans backed by my fake money what they’d say? Shorty’s gotta pay up SOON … HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
Important for AMC investors to watch. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgfDtGXnmR4

There was buying in the final ten minutes of the Friday session and then into AH. Let’s take this as a sign of momentum to come. This massive pennant could burst upwards pre holiday easily and there are predictions that it makes a move post holiday as well. Just hold and be patient as they put more on the table for us to squeeze at the 60-65 level. If we break that they will cover quick Luu to reduce risk and this will burst. They have doubled down. Let’s double down on them!!!!!!
BREAKING NEWS: Charles Schwab margin calls short sellers shorting both $AMC and $GME stock...
"I called Fidelity and TD Ameritrade yesterday to make certain that they CANNOT lend my AMC shares. Both told the same story:To lend out a investor's shares, the investor would have to have a margin account at either brokerage AND they must have a debit in their margin account. If these conditions exist, both brokerages can lend the investor's shares. If these conditions DO NOT exist, then the investor's shares CANNOT be loaned out by either brokerage.I found this interesting. Also, when I talked to TD Ameritrade, I explained that with all the attention on naked shorting and shorting in general, I DO NOT want my shares to be used by the brokerage firms to lend. The person at TD Ameritrade had an interesting reaction and agreed with me. I got the impression that they are getting tons of calls about shorting because the Apes have brought this into the spotlight this year."
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
Citadel has off shore brokerages in England and Ireland and there is a second set of books this is not actually the price and I will even say us gov is completely involved because if I can find foul play this easy they already know
SURVEY: Which Ape/Apette bought or bought more AMC because of the unusual bashing activity? Thumbs up if you did. I did!!!!
I have this very strong sense that we will experience a squeeze week!
"The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced that it fined Robinhood $57 million and ordered the online brokerage to pay approximately $12.6 million in restitution, plus interest, to thousands of customers for a total settlement of $70 million."
"adding more shares everyday. rest of my portfolio isn’t doing great, almost don’t care since AMC will   hedgies "
Yahoo Finance is censoring content. Just knowing this bolsters our resolve
"Hedgies won’t start freaking out until the volume dries out and they realize we ain’t selling... day traders giving the hedgies BS back forth little volume - soon when the volatily dies down, day traders will leave it, we won’t sell it and the hedgies won’t be able to cover or grind our their position - that’s when we fly... in the meantime ok to buy, but hold and don’t day trade this"
Anyone who has seen the Adam Aron interviews on Trey's Trades know that he is anti-hedge fund. The proposed 25M shares cannot be used in 2021. Don't let misinformation sway your shareholder vote. Hedge funds are counting on rifts to destabilize the ape army.

"As a novice investor, I find it interesting that most of the price decline occurs during the pre/post market. It is observable and undeniable that the price DOES NOT significantly decline throughout the day. I am no sure what that tells me about buying and selling and who is doing it, but it is interesting none the less. Also, are there any brokerages that allow retail to sell and buy right at 4:00 am?"
" This is a very Bullish Chart, traders! https://stockreport.tips/Bullish-Charts"
58.3% short percentage yesterday. 54.4% day before. Yet AMC is holding up incredibly well in the upper $50's. Someone is desperate.
"If you have 60,000 bucks right now and you buy 1000 shares you will be a millionaire it’s that simple so anyone that’s on the fence now is the time to buy this is going to happen hold and become a millionaire"
"If they push the squeeze out another few months , less capital gain tax.."
Hedge fund life lines & under handed tricks are being reduced daily. Someone is going to have to show the world the market is not rigged against investors. There is going to be businesses that are going to take the heat and the fall. The Feds are not going to accept blame.They are going to prove you can hit big buying shares in the market.And that’s what going to happen.
any shares purchased under $500 a share are still considered bargain basement prices.
Looking good Billy Ray!
I remember $8.01 like it was yesterday. I hope I'll remember $124.02 like it was yesterday too!
"What we need is to hold, know 95% of the Float is our, most have been in the GREEN like me, heavy,so there is no place to go to get these returns, even in a Month or Two....Hold your profits steady....spread the word, 18%short share interest and 1 Billion Synthetic & Dark Pool BS, Whistleblowers and Exec's leaving Citadel regularly...Writing on the wall"
Tonight Cramer said AMC has room to run. He included it in a graphic with stocks like Tesla and nvidia.
bought another 5 shares because it was under 40 dollars a great buying point!
"Today is just one of any battles. We win some, we lose some. If we are patient and we buy/hold, we will win the war!"
"Well I look at today as a huge success for AMC. We were not pushed around by shorts, and when we were knocked down a bit we climbed right back.This was an absolutely beautiful day of consolidation at the upper levels of our channel of $53.75 to $63.Short sellers borrowed over 12 million shares per Ortex and returned 11 million. They did not make much money. They did succeed in lowering the IV in the options chain which again may work against them as lower options prices will attract new money.Shorts continue to double down without attempting to cover any of the previous shorting. So while this looks like it was a stagnant day, today was a huge success.Perhaps tomorrow we see more consolidation, and that will stand to make us stronger and make the push north even larger.There could be gamma squeezes on the horizon as we see how options chain plays out. $60s may have to be hedged for if we can put enough pressure there, $65 would absolutely have to be hedged for.The shorts margin for error is getting slimmer by the day. We need our buyers to come on strong tomorrow because even the least of solid buying pressure will likely be more than shorts can handle."
I’m buying many more shares today. AMC is going higher!
"They r still shorting it - appears shares available for shorting have decreased. This is them suppressing it - what will happen once they get called on all the outstanding sharesNot for sale I don’t care, I’m confident with my trade on Telegram platform . With Ortex_Fx .."
Aren't a number of the Financial Media outlets guilty of intentionally misleading the public re the factual info re AMC?
pretty sure what we are seeing is a batch release of buy orders that were in Dark Pool Limbo... expect them to be shorting and we shall see a dip shortly.. getting close people..hodl and buy if you can. *not financial advice.
Why are all the comments from a month ago.
They trying to keep it under 60. Everybody buy at least one share. 60 is cheap compared to what it will be when it squeeze.
How does a stock sell off 4 points with no sellers LOL?
"1). AMC will likely surpass Volkswagen SP when it has its short squeeze. Why? a). 5M Apes strong. The numbers continue to grow each trading day; b). 80%+ Apes own AMC LEGAL shares (20% by institution); c). I believe there are about 2.5B - 3B synthetic shares. d). There are more shorted AMC shares (legal & illegal) than any other stocks when all the synthetic shares are officially counted; e). Apes own about 480% of all legal & illegal shares; f). Short HFs/MMs have been heavily shorting AMC for the past 3 months, at about $10 Avg short position. 2). Short HFs/MMs used at least 7 different shorting tactics: 2a) They short in the ""Lit"" NYSE market""; 2b). They massively bought in the ""Dark Pool"" & sold those shares in the ""Lit"" Market to manipulate SP to strike stop losses & get rid of paper hands; 2c). They short via the ETF (any and all ETF with AMC stock); 2d). They short using Options; 2e). They short via converting convertible notes/bonds/death spiral debt into shares & short those shares (AA decided to withdraw $600M convertible bond) to not give them any ammo; 2f). They short by ""FAKE"" selling among their many accounts to drive SP lower to strike stop losses; 2g). Even with SSR, they have the ability to mark short shares as ""short exempt""......3). Most if not all short HFs/MMs are under water since the Avg short position was $10, about 3 months ago. They are massive in over their heads. They will have to cover their short position eventually. It's a delay tactic to get as many paper hands out as possible before they cover. But, they have NOT covered it. Instead, they continue double/triple/quadruple down with their short positions. Check the short interest. It keeps going up...... 4) They own more than 50% of the media. (Be careful what you read). The more under water these short HFs/MMs are, the more desperate they are & the more FUD FUD FUD FUD FUD we see/hear.....5). They pump other stocks to get some paper hands to leave the AMC position to chase then dump those stocks. The only (2) stocks with majority of Apes holding are AMC & GME. AMC continues to have more buying orders than selling orders, even when it's on low volume day & SP down. Remember the 7 shorting tactics mentioned on item #2. 6). I believe the market will likely crash due to AMC stock. The banks know this. Some are shutting down all existing personal lines of credit in coming weeks....7). AMC anticipates that this weekend ""Black Widow"" will beat F9 last week's opening. The Poirier vs. The McGregor fight will be shown at 95 AMC theaters this weekend..... 8). The CDC & FDA think the current vaccination will likely be safe for the Delta Variance. They do not think the booster shots are needed for the Delta Variance at this point. This is great news for AMC.....9). Short HFs/MMs will likely go bankrupt if they continue to double down their short positions. The Options T+35; Threshold Security Listing for 13 calendar days plus T+2 (which mean next week; last week of July; Middle of August, early September, etc (Start with June 25th, count 13 calendar days from June 25, then add T+2 trading day). We might be in this position until the end of 2021 or better half of 2022 due to all the call options and if AMC continues to be on the Threshold Securities List in the weeks and months ahead)..... 10). I believe short HFs/MMs will likely stop shorting at some point. All the SEC & FINRA rules have been put in place to stop this corrupted system for a more transparency & level playing field for Retail Apes. The short HFs/MMs often choose to pay the fines rather than stop shorting. The best case scenario I see is for them to short get in more deep water and start to go long or play some call options to recoup their losses. It costs them about $1 billion a day with the CTB fees. It costs Apes nothing to HODL. They have not been covered yet. I am HODL""ing"" for as long as it takes, until I see these short HFs/MMs cover. The Gamma Squeeze will eventually happen with all the Call Option Contracts. The Mother of All Squeezes is inevitable and will likely trigger once Gamma Squeeze strikes $100. When the MOASS strikes, we will likely see the most violent SP jumps......Call options T+35 & F-T-D of 13 calendar day plus T+2 will likely play out for weeks & months. This is the social & culture movement play to bankrupt these short HFs/MMs. Anyone talking about the fundamentals or tell you about other shorted stocks is FUD to get you out of your game. These are only my research and opinions. Do your own research before investing."
We own the outstanding float multiple times. I’ve watched the blatant manipulation for months
"Amc $500 soon they will realize that this isn’t about movie theater but the revolution, GameStop paved the way and still holding above $200 with empty stores and no guidance "
They will cover soon they won't find better price to
"We blame HF’s for this hardcore manipulation, but the reality is that the entire market is rigged, top to bottom, it’s a money making machine out of the average retail investor."
"Stop the predictions. Stop writing directly to Hedge Funds on this chat. Theyre not reading what you wrote. Its wasting space.Stop writing to bashers as well. Use your energy wisely. Just my opinion.This chat is for facts about what is happening with AMC. Or moral boosting.Me, I could care less about being emotional one way or another taking money from hedge funds. I am not veangeful, at all. They have their job to do. I have mine. It happens to be basically the same job yet mine is not illegal. Mine is worthy. I want to help me and my family have a better life. Just like all us APES.Keep buying, holding, and waiting.PeaceHODL"
Short interest nearly 20%…we OWN the float…shorty’s sweatin’ BIGTIME!HOLD LONG & STRONG!!!
"To those of you who are new. You may have felt compelled to sell your shares @$57.99 this morning and are now regretting it. This is a buy and hold situation. This is nothing but an unmitigated attack by the shorts, those who are shorting the stock, in the hope you will sell your shares. To do so would give them legitimacy, as they are selling synthetic shares. I am not a financial advisor, but do have a vested interest in AMC, recently becoming a share holder. This isn't about the volatility in the share price, but rather a cause, forcing those who have, for years, beaten down those without a voice. We are their collective voices, as we fight for both ourselves, as with them. The end goal is to have the shorters cover5 their positions, at which time the price of the shares will rise substantially, there technically being no limit on how high they could conceivably go. So, in conclusion, buy shares when the price dips and hold!"
"Motley is accusing us Apes of manipulation. Affecting the price and thus defrauding other investors. Listen Motley, AMC has been in the news for months, EVERY wallstreet investor is AWARE of what’s happening along with retail. If the SEC won’t go after hedgies, what makes you think they have the fire power to come have millions of retail investors  your scare tactics fail on every logical level. Here’s a  for trying"
Happy Moon Day!
"I don't see anybody mentioning end of month is near, half year reporting day tomorrow! Positions may need to be closed, short covering tru borrowing becomes far too expensive. This may help , or better, cause.... high demand for, amongst others, AMC......"
"1st halt, haha, good news squeeze coming, remember GME halts? "
AMC ON THRESHOLD LIST SINCE JUNE 18TH AND REPORTED 2 DAYS BACK TO BACK FROM 25TH OF JUNE..THEY HAVE 7-13 TRADING DAYS TO SETTLE BEFORE AUTOMATIC COVERING BY COMPUTERS..5 DAYS HAVE PASSED ALREADY..AND WE HAVE 7 TRADING DAYS LEFT TODAY BEFORE SHOWTIME..JULY 6TH
So Etrade is trying to get folks to get into their lending program.Second time they have sent me this email with an annual 2700$ payout.LOL NO THANKS!!
This price action up and down is nothing all manipulation! WE ALL KNOW THIS IS EASILY WORTH 800+ PER SHARE ONCE THE HF COVERS!!!
"AMC isn't about what the price per share is, it's about having shares when this takes off. Shares or no shares, who cares about the price. The math tells the story, just do the math."
Good volume day and well into the GREEN!
"Imagine you are the manager of citadel....you already know you're bankrupt. Your only option is to manipulate the stock at this point hoping and praying you can last longer than retail is willing to hold. We've won already. Sit back, relax, and wait for the inevitable. s"

"I entered the 1,000 share club today. That 916 share # felt odd. I bought another 84 for a clean 1k! "
tomorrow should be off the hook. 4 million retail investors at least 1/2 get paid tomorrow
"This past month the pre market volume was in the millions at this time. It is only 100k so far. The short laddering has stopped. There is only one play left for Citadel and others like them, take care of their margin calls and buy more to cover their losses during the squeeze. Any time now...BOOM!"
Deep breaths everyone and hold! Another week of Hedgies racking up losses! Stay strong. Stay the course. Stay for the win!
"Good post if yahoo don't deleteDo y’all not realize that most people hold index funds for years and get a 7-11% return on their investment year over year. Stop saying this day or that day and just hold. If the squeeze comes in November we will literally be able to say we increased our investment in the hundreds to 1000%. So yes while getting rich over night would just be a dream come true, take a step back realize considerable gains can come but stop getting people set up to be disappointed. Hell even if it takes us months to stair step to 1k, 5k whatever the pay off will be well worth it if everyone just keeps their emotions in check. Have belief in the stock and just hold. Not financial advice but this is how I am approaching amc."
"Selling stock short without having located stock for delivery at settlement. This activity would violate Regulation SHO, except for short sales by market makers engaged in bona fide market making. Market makers engaged in bona fide market making do not have to locate stock before selling short, because they need to be able to provide liquidity. However, market makers are not excepted from Regulation SHO’s close-out and pre-borrow requirements."
"Futures recovering from the Fed spooking it on Friday (which triggered the selling of AMC near end of day). A huge Bullish Ascending Triangle formation is almost complete, predicting a massive spike in the stock price by today or Tuesday. Shorts are about to get creamed. Once the stock price makes a new all time high over the mid $70s, EVERY SINGLE short will be under water. We'll see panic covering like we haven't seen before. Their only options are: cover high or cover higher.While apes are buying and holding, to gain more shares, once the stock rallies really high on any given week, sell covered calls a few % above the high share price. You'll get good money for it. Turn around and buy more shares of AMC with it. Keep doing this weekly and you will have dozens of times more shares than you originally started with in a few months. Who doesn't want free AMC shares???? Plus buying more shares ensures the stock price can be pushed above $1,000+. Let's do this apes. Play smart, and get that free money. Vicious positive feedback, self-sustaining loop. AMC will be the most epic short squeeze in the history of the stock market.https://photos.app.goo.gl/6PCMTagGSyhxRke56"
"Was prime for take off and the HF's stopped it in its tracks and dropped it back below $60. They will lose eventually, just wait and see"
Platforms are trying desperately to mis-inform retail investors that meme stocks are dying because they are losing billions to the everyday investor in their short game #longlivewallstreetbets #buyAMCandhold
"all collective data on charts and recent box office success, with big box stuff on deck indicates mass accumulation period ahead and longs holding with no grace for shorts."
I've got a question for you. When there aren't any shares of AMC left to purchase what will happen?
8001 shares holding strong in Virginia Stonewall Jackson style
The hedgefunds and shorts are going to smoke some pole today!AMC to $1000 !!!
amc buying up theaters. nice!!!
Sold off shares in another security and bought my 9 more shares of AMC!! Feeling effin good!!! Let's go!! 
"Yes holdYes buyYes, don’t spend $ that you can’t afford to lose,,,Invest wisely Long term Keep ure emotions out of the process Good luck to all hereI am still holding Cautiously optimistic Go AMCLooking forward to a better week ahead "
Always a good day when AMC is the trending ticker!!! (AMC100k) (APESTRONGTOGETHER)!!!
"22% short volume ratio, you know shorts haven’t covered a share when, and we’re already in the 50’s, imagine when the covering begins and shorts aren’t able to find shares to buy, sky is the limit. Patience, we need another gamma squeeze to try to get this to short squeeze via margin calls."
Invesco with nearly a 6 mill share purchase today!
We buy red and green knowing massive upside is coming. Stay the course. The mother of all short squeezes. A modest chunk. Buy and hold for financial freedom. We own the outstanding float
"They won’t allow me to post the link, but simply google the NYSE Threshold list. Here AMC has a “Y” status meaning that this FTDs that have been expired require mandatory maintenance, or covering basically. This greatly limits their ability to short as they will be required to buy according to the rules set in place by the NYSE."
I like a lil buy and hodl during my summers!!!! Didnt come this far to come this far. I got moon tickets on a one way squeeeze baby!!!
"U can’t go wrong buying amc today, gonna close the day on top"
"Hedge Funds: ""Don't let this stock get too high"" the stock:"
So could it be that shares are drying up? Paper hands and Day traders keep handing over their shares and Retail investors are buying and holding them. I am sure that by now we own more than 80% of the float. I guess we should keep buying up all the shares until 100 %.
"shorts have added to their position. short intrest shot up to almost 19%. This is not over, it hasn't even started. We are seeing healthy consolidation."
Bought 10 shares today to join in. Hope it’s not too late.
"any reason why this stock should be 100. or 10. ? how many here still watching the show here rather in AMC theaters. There is emotion, comedy, tragedy all in here...."
No squeeze yet....Let's just continue higher as they short more....It's the gift that keeps on giving.....The EVENTUAL squeeze is the big bonus as we simply go higher... 
"I'm 57 and every penny of my retirement is in AMC at 12.50 a share and guess what?I haven't sold 1 share...I'm not leaving, I'm not selling!"
"Please try send below complaint off to SEC if you canTo: chairmanoffice@sec.govcc commissionerpeirce@sec.gov; commissionercrenshaw@sec.gov; commissionerroisman@sec.govSubject: Market Manipulation - AMC EntertainmentDear Mr GenslerI would like to draw your attention to market manipulation activity happening on an indutrial scale on range of stocks including AMC listed on US Exchanges by market makers operating in the dark pool.Brokerages such as Fidelity which routes retail orders through NYSE reports day in day out the buy orders for AMC outnumbering sell orders by nearly 2 to 1, yet the price has been falling consistently now for the past month. It is falling because brokerages such as Robinhood,TD Ameritrade and Charles Shwab, attracted by payments for order flow, are routing retail orders through dark pool market makers such as Citadel and Virtu which routes sell orders to lit exchanges on receipt and park buy orders in their books; eventually releasing it to lit exchanges as and when it favours them.In fact, on option expiry days, you can almost exactly predict to the dime where the price of stocks manipulated in this manner will finish at end of day trading.My question to you Sir is: Why is the SEC allowing Citadel and other clearinghouse money makers/broker-dealers to route over 50% of all the AMC retail buy orders to dark pools and sell orders to the market, thus effectively truncating AMC market price?United States prides itself as a free fair and competitive market driven economy. However, the above practice appears anything but. It is pure manipulation by and to the benefit of a single entity Citadel, and to the detriment of tens of millions of retail investors. This needs to be investigated and the practice ended as a matter of URGENCY,Sincerely"
"Was away for a week - see we are holding in very very nicely… for the last week didnt really check in on AMC but was not worried - I am holding long till this thing hits $1,000 per share… just a matter of time… Very bad press for Citadell that is negatively affecting other institutions too- rumour is that they are gonna put the screws to Citadell, and perhaps replace some of the MM’s who manage the after and pre-trade… the small volume is where you see obvious manipulation to set the stage for the days trades… you can’t have a stock trade up 10% on massive volume then in AH retract a full 15% on no volume. All the AH does is set the price for dark pool - that’s why the very next day it takes retail buying of about 10 mil shares to push the price back up - manipulation up the wazoo"
We didn’t sale last Friday and we won’t sale today… if they could drop this stock to 40$ they would already had done it. Just be patient to get paid that’s all I’ll say today.
3500 shares holding with diamond hands. Lets do this!!!
"Look at the percentage dark pools, this is why we need to request or move to non payment for order flow .Trading dataSummary of trading data of AMC. Short percentage is the amount of volume shorted.

Let shorts pay the interest and wait for margin calls. We will keep buying steadily and putting more pressureNot for sale
We own the outstanding float we celebrate red or green knowing shorts are down billions. And the Short squeeze is 10/10 rating
"just buy at 59.50 20 shares , common drive AMC UP"
Citadel sponsors the Motley Stool. So Citadel is a hedge fund and market maker who sets the price and also shorts it while owning the media...and the SEC and other institutions thought that was OK... The system needs an overhaul and it can start with us getting our tendies
My ex husband made 2.3 million dollars on AMC.
The reason why it stagnant it's because he hold ! They have less power and the longer we hold the longer they pay interest and they gonna have to cover eventually The chart shows we are winning ! Proud of the community
Trey trades is going in for his heart surgery today . Lets show some support and all buy 1 share at 11 am !!!!!!!
"LOL, These MFer's can't sell shares they already sold we own 3x to 5x of the float DTCC 005 Just put the cage around these HF's The show is about to begin."
"LMAO...Chris Markoch....FUD writer....busting on retail investors? Did you know many Apes take their pictures outside AMC theaters now....Many have seen new movies like F9 in AMC theaters.You say you get it, but talk about earnings and pps and streaming being the future. WHEN HAVE APES EVER TALKED ABOUT THAT STUFF as reasons we are here??Your snipe -- ""when the story of the stock market circa 2020 is made into a movie it has the potential to be a blockbuster. Maybe that will be a time to go to the theater. Oh wait, people will just stream it.""Smoke this. 2021 score Apes 1 Hedges 0 ... 4mil Apes going to local AMC theaters to see ""Plan of The Apes - GME"" at $14 a seat is $574mil in 1 weekend. Now what about 100mil+ worldwide movie viewers any way they want that weekend. Then the sequel ""Plan of the Apes 2 - AMC"". Maybe a part 3.....YOU GOT NOTHIN. YOU NOT APE. Hedges were gonna take down an icon and 38k jobs for profit because of Covid and not care. It's what they have done for decades. It needs to stop. The small investor, the struggling company has no chance once the hook is in. Another writer gleefully writes how $1 puts are where you should be placing your money when supposed fundies for weeks, even on CNBC, said $8. You all don't care about the truth of naked shorting and dark pools or 38k, not one mention of SEC changing things, just about seeing your hit piece in print. WELL NOW A COUPLE COMPANIES AND MANY SMALL RETAIL INVESTORS are making the money and big money doesn't like that.JMO"
Does the USA have a free market? NO! Not while hedge fund managers can boast about using AI to manipulate the share prices...
I really need AMC to squeeze. I need to pay off my loans… I need 25k to pay off… I hold 200shares currently and that’s everything I have…
"Hello my fellow s , I've enough bananas to take me to the promise land at $100k floor, but I'd ask each and every  to keep holding ( if you can ), thinking why?1.

They are obviously routing the trades through the OTC somehow! The real price of AMC is said to be 3800.per share
Is shorting a stock @ $10 and after paying interest for 6 months and then eventually covering @ $500 A sound investment strategy?
"buying 100 more shares, not worried about bills, they can wait another month, ill pay them double next month ha ha can anyone say cheese !!!"
"In my opinion, technical analysis does not apply to AMC. I just buy and hold and wait for shorts to cover… easy."
"Is it just me, or is Motley Tools always wrong on stocks like $AMC, $WKHS, $WISH etc? LOL"
The JPMorgan team said blockchain data suggests recent cryptocurrency sales were made to cover losses and that “there is likely still an overhang of underwater positions which need to be cleared through the market.”

"$AMC gang! I think we need a reminder of where we were 4 weeks ago, and now. Consolidation is good. The stronger the consolidation is, the harder it is for them to drop is below $50. It brings more value to your shares. We've held $50+ for almost 4 weeks. We are not leaving! "
HFs are possibly planning a fake short squeeze at $150 to wipe out paper hands who may believe the squeeze is over. But we know there are 9 billion synthetic shares to be covered and sky's the limit. Buckle up APES!
We are all in this together HOLDING for $$$$9999.00
"When you look at the historical data of previous short squeezes and compare it AMC, there is so much similarities with the price action. Who would have thought that we willget to $72 on the 2nd of June when we were riding the wave of short attacks at $5.50. Amazing stuff. History in the making. At the moment, the short HFs are too proud to accept defeat. ""Pride comes before the fall."""
