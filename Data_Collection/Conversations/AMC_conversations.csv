AMC is now on the NYSE threshold securities and NOW SHARES CANT be borrowed until this failure to deliver is paid back. They have 7-13 days to pay it back or the position will be automatically closed. THIS IS NOT THE SQUEEZE. THE SQUEEZE IS WHEN ALL THE SYNTHETICS ARE COVERED. Not financial advice.
"A simple explanation as to why we will go up soon enough. - short interest has gone up quickly and by quite a percentage. Why? 002 is making it so HFs have to short more out on the open market rather than the massive amounts shorted in dark pools. This indicates that SI would be much much higher as it does not take into account all of the previous shorting having taken place in dark pools. Mind you AMC has faired well despite attacks both inside and outside of the NYSE. - volume is low and why is this a good thing? With short interest rising the market makers are waiting but not for much longer. The market makers see rising interest as blood in the water. They will come in to push the price as high as they can to force margin calls. The volume at this point will spike quickly as a result of these trades.- what can hedgie do? They can continue shorting all they like on the open market and eventually will cover due to the buying pressure. This game has costs them too much and is pricier everyday. The shares on the open market to short are limited and their fuel tank, not ours, will run dry and then it’s time to put more fuel in our tank."
"AMC is on the NYSE Threshold List for June 25 (google it yourself).This means the security must have five or more consecutive days of failed settlementtotaling at least 10,000 shares or 0.5% of shares outstanding.Lots of new naked shorting last week. Keep adding that fuel to the fire!"
"If you want to know how strong AMC is right now you should just go have a look at the interactive 5 day chart on Yahoo and be sure you use 5 min intervals. What you will see is what amounts to a kiss of death to the shorts. During the post-lunch take-down, hey were able to force the current price, 10 day and 50 day average price below the 200 day average by some measure over the last half hour but my goodness, just look at it now..! All three indices moving back up and over the 200 day as I type.Now have a look at the AMC one month chart and you will see the current price as I post is breaking back over the 10 day moving average which sends and evenstronger signal. I truly believe we are going to see some real fire-works this afternoon and I mean that. This is such a strong signal AMC is sending out here and now. It's phenomenal really and I've never witnessed anything like it. It feels so good to be a part of making history doesn't it?"
"How soon will we see an AMC short squeeze? Retail investors all want to know. Is it this week? Will it be next week? Or, are we looking at a longer game here? Here’s what we know.Key Highlights • AMC closed at $58.11 on June 28th. The stock has fundamentally surged despite short sellers attacking it. AMC Entertainment is set up for a short squeeze. • The perfect time to buy AMC stock is when the market is red, or what we refer to as on ‘discount’. AMC is looking bullish though, red days might just be over. • AMC entertainment continues to be the most heavily shorted stock in the market. • AMC’s short borrow fee continues to increase."
"Michael Kurlander, the Deputy Global Treasurer of Citadel Securities has resigned after 4 years with the hedge fund. Michael Kurlander is now the CFO for Pagaya, a financial AI tech company. Citadel has been losing billions of dollars since the rise of retail investors in the AMC and GameStop saga."
"On Wednesday, market makers, which are also DTCC clearing members, will have to tighten up their short-selling belts. Because their available capital will be contrasted more frequently with member deposits, their ability to maintain massive short positions is slated to be crippled.Current State of the AMC/GME SagaIn case you haven’t yet grasped the basics of short selling, here is a brief recap of basic indicators (we’ll get to the breaking news afterward). The foremost among them is the short interest percentage, referring to the number of shorted shares divided by outstanding shares.According to Ortex data, as of today, both AMC and GME stocks have relatively high estimated short interests, AMC at 13.64% and GME at 14.54% (17% on May 28) of free float.Above 10% is considered high, while above 20% is extremely high, which translates to more investors thinking the stock price will fall. Of course, bullish short squeezers tend to use this metric as an opportunity to buy the dip, counting on the stock to rebound.AMC and GME price moves in 2021, source: TradingViewRegarding the free float, also called public float, it refers to the number of shares available for public trading by using the following formula:Free float = outstanding shares – restricted shares – closely-held sharesWith these two metrics in mind, we arrive at the short-interest ratio, as the number of shorted shares divided by average daily trading volume. This is one of the key factors that enter the consideration when to take short positions. The higher it is, the longer it would take to repurchase the borrowed shares, which is why it is commonly known as the days-to-cover ratio.A ratio above 10 would indicate a negative outlook on the stock. As of May 28 report, AMC’s short ratio was 0.7 with 20.3 million shares sold short, while GME’s short ratio was at 1, with 11.97 million shares sold short. Meaning, they were both bullish indicators."
We didn’t sale last Friday and we won’t sale today… if they could drop this stock to 40$ they would already had done it. Just be patient to get paid that’s all I’ll say today.
"Looking back over the last couple of months of the AMC rise, I came across another price channel that appears to be similarly played out to where we are now.From May 13th to May 21st we were stuck in a price channel between around $12 to $14. When we first went to $12 on May 13th, we had volume of 296 million, the following 3 days we averaged around 185 million in volume and tested the $14 price only to be rejected on May 18th.On May 19th, 20th, and 21st volume dropped dramatically as we have seen occur this week, averaging around 66 million volume per day or roughly 1/3rd the volume from May 13th to the 18th.AMC proceeded to drop from a close of $14.03 on May 18th to a close of $12.08 on May 21st. Again sound like a similar trend?On May 24th, a Monday, volume returned and AMC shot from $12.08 to $13.68, Tuesday May 25th it closed at $16.41, Wednesday May 26th, $19.56, Thursday the 27th, $26.52, and Friday May 28th it closed at $26.12.The point of this is we are seeing a similar pattern develop over the last few weeks where we are in a channel that has consolidated beautifully. This channel is now 10 days old and is wound so tightly that when it explodes it could be wild and violent to say the least.We are showing characteristics of something ready to occur as volume has now tailed off, this tells me no one is really selling.A more telltale sign is that short interest as of Friday June 25th was up again as once again shorts borrowed more than they returned.We now sit with the following numbers per ORTEXSHARES ON LOANCurrent97.13m remember 102 million gets us to 20% of free floatThis data is as of close on Wednesday as the T+2 rule makes us wait for trades to clear.% FREEFLOAT ON LOANCurrent18.99%UTILIZATION OF BORROWED SHARESCurrent91.35%Now this is from close of business yesterdayEstimatedCurrent Short Interest95.45m meaning this many shares are what shorts are paying interest on which is due next week by the way.Bottom line is this, every hurricane takes time to develop, takes time to strengthen takes time to make landfall, but when it does it can cause devastation to anyone in its way. Shorts are in our way and Hurricane AMC is building to a category 5 with this 10 day consolidation.When the volume comes back and the buyers strike its gonna be fun."
"Good morning all. After a very nice Monday we received a little bit of a boost via Regulation SHO last evening. Reg SHO gives us a little insight into failures to deliver. Those stocks that were supposed to be purchased but have not been. Well seems AMC Entertainment has made the threshold listing. This listing is compiled and released by the NYSE and a company is listed when FTD are in excess of .005 of the outstanding shares listed for the ticker and have been in an FTD state for the last 5 trading days. This list in many ways allows folks to see how the stock is being ""manipulated"" by short holders. The SEC is aware of this situation, so now we just have to hope they quit just watching and they start enforcing."

"Big money plays in AMC on Friday. $600k worth of call options were made in the last 12 minutes of trading on Friday. On Sunday, a 200% margin requirement has been put in place when shorting stocks, meaning that Hedge Funds need double the amount of collateral in order to short AMC. This will make a margin call happen much much faster. Now we're seeing higher volume in the pre market than we have seen in weeks. This could be a life changing week. Thanks to all of my fellow apes that have been BUYING AND HOLDING!"
"An update to yesterday's short interest scenario on AMC.As mentioned yesterday when the NYSE updated its short interest on May 28th there were 100.2 million shares in short interest resulting in 20.1% of the float being shorted.We discussed the fact that the following week we all know what happened to AMC price and the gamma squeeze that occurred on June 2nd.Now Ortex is once again reporting the following and this is as of Wednesday due to the T+2 rule. As of close of business Wednesday Ortex is reporting 97.13 million shares on loan. Ortex is also reporting 18.99% of the free float, of which retail owns approximately 80% is now on loan being shorted. I can tell you that yesterday of which is not crunched by Ortex yet due to the 2 day settlement system Ortex reported and additional 2.09% increase in short interest.Utilization of these borrowed shares which had been sitting in the high 80% range is now closing in on 92% as of Wednesday.Why is all of this important? Well based on numbers as of Wednesday versus May 28th total that would leave only about 5 million shares or less available to be borrowed by shorts before reaching 100% of free float accounted for.At 92% utilization as of again Wednesday, that would leave about 7 million shares available to be shorted based on the 93.17 million on loan, these shares may very well have been used Wednesday and Thursday.Bottom line is this, short interest is increasing rapidly, shorts are running at levels that leave them in a very precarious position. The price of AMC remains very stable and within our channel of $53.75 to $62.00. The options chain remains very bullish at nearly 3 to 1 ratioThe last 2 times that short interest reached over 20% AMC broke out from $10 to $14 and from 29$ to $72.Now I am not saying history is going to repeat itself, but it often can repeat itself.This post is not to give predictions or timeframes on anything, it is meant to give you all an update of exactly where we stand and where shorts ability to maneuver is at at the current time.Bottom line is shares to borrow are limited and short interest is rising to a dangerous point once again for short sellers."
FOX Business reported AMC to have a strong chance of a short squeeze. Coming from a big news platform it certainly brings the stock sentiment up for most retail investors.
"APES: The plan was simple, Citadel bet against AMC hoping for bankruptcy. Make lots of money and if the company went bankrupt, Citadel was off of the hook paying capital gains taxes. Citadel had/has borrowed so many stocks that if AMC would have lost, no stocks to return, thus keeping all of the profit and the person who loaned them the shares, would have lost everything. Citadel bought 3 million Cinemark shares on the long. NOW MF is working hard at convincing readers today that Cinemark has been shorted as much as AMC. This is a LIE. Citadel hopes the naïve will start buying Cinemark, so the stock price increases, they can sell off at a profit and then try and cover their AMC losses. Citadel NEEDED AMC to go bankrupt, so that Cinemark was the only major theater chain standing. Cinemark has half of the theaters that AMC does. Had AMC gone bankrupt, Citadel would have scooped up vacant AMC theaters, and sold them to Cinemark, so they could expand their visibility across the world. This is WHY WE HODL!"
"If shorts do not close before share count it will be a huge mistake. If we find out that the float is much bigger than currently advertised, the days to cover may turn into weeks to cover or even worse, if they have to buy more shares than us retail own, we could all just hold and name our price before the action even starts. Why would we even sell one share."
Motley is attempting to compare AMC to Cinemac. Pumping it as a soon to be short squeeze. He of course forgot to mention that Citadel owns the majority of that company and we don’t CARE if it’s shorted and goes bankrupt. Citadel is heavily invested in it. It’s a distraction in hopes that people buy the stock so citadel can offset its AMC losses. We like the AMC stock!
"Wow, another great day. The lowest volume I’ve seen in probably the last 30 days and the price only dropped $1.39. If the volume keeps getting lower without a drop in price then the days to cover ratio increases for the shorts and the higher the days to cover ratio is, the faster the squeeze happens"
"Was away for a week - see we are holding in very very nicely… for the last week didnt really check in on AMC but was not worried - I am holding long till this thing hits $1,000 per share… just a matter of time… Very bad press for Citadell that is negatively affecting other institutions too- rumour is that they are gonna put the screws to Citadell, and perhaps replace some of the MM’s who manage the after and pre-trade… the small volume is where you see obvious manipulation to set the stage for the days trades… you can’t have a stock trade up 10% on massive volume then in AH retract a full 15% on no volume. All the AH does is set the price for dark pool - that’s why the very next day it takes retail buying of about 10 mil shares to push the price back up - manipulation up the wazoo"
"There were some big money plays just before market close on Friday. $600k worth of call options were placed for AMC within the last 12 minutes of trading. On Sunday, news was released that Hedge Funds will now have to have 200% the regular margin requirements to short a stock. This means that Hedge Funds will need to have twice as much collateral in order to short a stock, meaning that there's a much bigger chance of them getting margin called. With this news, the big money plays on Friday, and this higher than normal pre-market volume, I can't help but this that there may have been some insider trading. Follow the big money people. This may be a very good week for AMC. BUY and HOLD!"
