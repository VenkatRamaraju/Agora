"ZERO trust in Yahoo, after the AMC conversation has been disrupted for months!! Why has this been unusable for this long!!! Still hodling my thousands of AMC shares!!!!"
"State of New Jersey Pension Fund increased their holdings in $AMC by another 66,000 shares bringing the total to over $11.28 million shares , paper hands should be ashamed , pension funds buying and your selling"
AMC earnings report comes out Nov. 1st and they are already posting articles saying it's going to be way over expectations... Looks like Nov. 1st afterhours AMC is going to start popping yet once again!!! #AMC
"What a beautiful thing. Retail investors own 75% of float. Even when some of the big institutions sell off in the 500s, it will still grow because we all know the real value is in the 10s of thousands. AMC is the $hood"
"AMC earnings report expected to be stellar. Over 800 million revenue for 3rd quarter. Nov 1st and 2nd will be huge days for FOMO buying, shorts covering and little manipulation. Going to be a great week!AMC is the $hood"

Finally the price tickers are more insync with the activity. Retailers moving from the RH dark pool trades to lit brokers like Fidelity. Now we should see $hood sink and AMC rise.
#AMC Let’s go Brandon!!
#amc never forget hood listing was just to distract from AMC. just like SENS and CLOV..
"This is awesome! Market open dips down to 35 maybe less so the shorts can start to cover, plus gives one last chance for some major FOMO buying. Expect a huge day and week!AMC is the $hood"
Not looking good for Citadel in the SEC court hearing today. In a nutshell....They won't be allowed to dark pool trade as effectively as they have been. This will open up the floodgates for FOMO and more accurate price action. This could very well be the catalyst to the squeeze. AMC is the $hood
$AMC TO THE MOON!!!
"Why are people posting about hood here? This is the #AMC board. Think about it, which stock is about to explode and which one is irrelevant?"
We respectfully ask for a warrant to arrest Ken griffin and his subordinates in federal court. You have 10 business days to offer the warrant or march in protest to sec building in Washington d.c.
"This is what $AMC looks like with less price manipulation, small volume yet gains are showing as it should. Like I said before, hood will sink and $AMC will naturally rise with less short laddering and dark pool trades. Just a matter of time!"
Bought some more $AMC.
The only thing that will maintain some level of integrity in the stock market would be never finding out how the short selling mafia is able to oversell a stock in the magnitude AMC was oversold. There are only two ways...Amc goes bk which won't hapoen even if they make zero dollars for a year and a half. The other way we don't find out about the fake shares is let a squeeze happen and most AMC fake shareholders sell their shares. I think the second option will be mandated by the SEC in order to save integrity.
It is so blatantly obvious that the hegies are trying their best to bring the price down before they announce yet another earnings report that blows past expectations.... Hahaha Love it! #AMC
"$AMC at this revenue rate will be out of debt far ahead of their obligated repayment plan in 2 years. This company is on fire and would be in the 50s naturally without the short squeeze. The hundreds of millions of shorted shares needs to be covered, and when that happens boom. Get in at these discounts before it is too late."
"Citadel Securities sues SEC over approval of new stock-order typeBy Kanishka Singh2 MIN READ(Reuters) - Citadel Securities, which provides trading services to asset managers, banks, broker-dealers and hedge funds, has sued the Securities and Exchange Commission over its decision to approve a new mechanism for trading stocks at upstart exchange operator IEX Group Inc.“The SEC failed to properly consider the costs and burdens imposed by this proposal that will undermine the reliability of our markets and harm tens of millions of retail investors,” a Citadel Securities spokeswoman said in an email on Friday.The lawsuit, which was filed on Friday and first reported by the Wall Street Journal, increases Citadel Securities’ dispute over IEX’s “D-Limit” order type. The D-Limit is designed to give traders a way to buy or sell stocks at the exchange while protecting them against unfavorable price moves.ADVERTISEMENTCitadel Securities earlier asked the SEC to reject the proposal from IEX, saying the D-Limit will damage the U.S. stock market’s integrity. But in August, the SEC sided with IEX allowing the plan to go forward.Citadel Securities asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the SEC’s decision to approve the D-Limit order, according to a copy of the court filing.OF COURSE CITADEL DOES NOT APPROVE OF AN ORDER TYPE TO PROVIDE SOME PROTECTION FOR THE RETAIL INVESTOR AS IT MAY IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO FLEECE CAPITAL FROM THE COMMON INVESTOR."
