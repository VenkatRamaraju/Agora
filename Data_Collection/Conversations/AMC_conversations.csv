Many AMC millionaires will be made soon!
"reposting news: Today's SEC filing shows Vanguard's VEXMX fund has increased their $AMC holdings from 768,494 shares to 1,633,595 shares. That's 112% increase. The info is on fintel.io.Why do you think Vanguard would have increased their position in AMC? Do you still believe the HFs and Shorters?"
"Still not selling #AMC, holding until it squeezes!"
Been watch the volume at theaters! Down 60% from pre pandemic levels!
"In order for the squeeze to happen, EVERYONE needs to get on the same page. No selling for quick little profits to buy again at the dip. This only allows the shorts to cover cheap.As call options expire again, the likelihood of the price going up and up is VERY HIGH. HOWEVER, do not underestimate the Hedge Fund's. They will continue to short and bring the stock price down. BUYING at those pull downs is what I plan on doing.IMPORTANT TO NOTE: The CEO just received a $3.7m bonus, and other high ranking employees also received generous bonuses - do you believe a company that isn't on the up and up would dish out these bonuses? IMO - expect better than expected earnings reporting. IF this happens, this is just going to increase the share price even more. Remember - share prices almost always increase after ""expectations"" are beat.This game is simple. The short interest is there. The possibility of a Gamma / Short Squeeze is there. We all know this could happen - therefore, we all need to be on the same page. JUST BUY, and HOLD. Do not panic sell or take small profits.Ex: If you bought 1,000 shares at $8 and it goes to $10, you will make a $2k profit. Sure, that's nice but if you HOLD and put the pressure on the HF's, the price could go to $100 - $500. 1,000 @ $100 would give you $92,000 profit, and a $492,000 profit at $500/share. See the difference?JUST HOLD and be patient! :)"
"1. The short interest of Volks Wagon when it sqoze to 1000 Euros ($1200 USD) was 10%. The short interest of $AMC is currently 13%.2. There are millions and millions of shorted shares covering tomorrow, most of which are between $58-$60. The higher we can get the price by tomorrows close, the more shares they will have to buy back, resulting in a bigger gamma squeeze. In my opinion, we're going to see a gamma squeeze tomorrow regardless, but the higher we can get the price, the bigger the gamma squeeze. If it's big enough, it will lead to a short squeeze.Stop watching the minute chart. Zoom out and look at daily chart. We are slowly rising even though the Hedge Funds are fighting us and trying to drop the price. There were 2.2 million shares shorted yesterday morning, resulting in the pre market drop. I'm sure they tried the same thing this morning.The question isn't if the squeeze will happen, it's if you're be in on it when it does!!"

"$AMC as the SQUEEZE is inevitably upon us, please take into consideration the smaller accounts. The guys who have single digit, and under 100 shares. These are most likely the people working 9-5 struggling and trying their hardest to do their part. Let’s hold for them! #AMCSQUEEZE"

$AMC is offering 44.4 million new shares! moving their debt into stock. this company will survive much longer because of what we are doing. BUY & HOLD
"Here is my prediction $AMC and $GME.Let’s try to understand what happened recently.1. SLR Exemption Expired as of March 31, 2021Since Pandemic, FED temporarily exempts SLR for one year expiring as of March 31, 2021. https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319b.htmSo what happens to all lenders and bankers? They must maintain SLR (6%) as of today. This meant all bankers must have enough cash in hand. To do that, bankers don't allow further leverages, margin calls, and/or collect calls for any outstanding overdue debts. U already witnessed forced liquidation by Goldman Sachs last week. https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-markets-blocktrades-banks/focus-in-archegos-fire-sale-credit-suisse-nomura-burned-by-slow-exit-idUSL1N2LS2LQIs good for AMC and GME?Yes, I think so. SLR exemption expiration also affects short positions by using leverages. Typically we said margin calls.Then why no short squeeze today?well, I am not sure. Maybe Citadel is too big to get margin calls? or FED/SEC/ALL Bankers can't kill whales? or they are negotiating new terms? who knows?2. FED preparing MMs/Bankers Bankruptcy near futureThe page 22 of SR-NSCC-2021-801, https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-801.pdfAs described above, the proposal would strengthen NSCC’s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to complete end-of-day settlement in the event of the default of a Member. The proposal would do this by allowing NSCC to calculate and collect, when applicable, SLD every Business Day from those Members that pose the largest liquidity exposures to NSCC on that day. The proposal would also include a mechanism to allow NSCC to collect SLD on an intraday basis, including on the first Business Day of the Options Expiration Activity Period, when liquidity exposures are historically higher.3. FED now just watch HFs activity and will put new regulations in the near futureYellen Signals Scrutinizing Hedge Funds a Renewed FSOC Focus, https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/yellen-signals-scrutinizing-hedge-funds-193235163.htmlYou see something is brewing. The biggest problem of HFs with $AMC and $GME is there is no exit plan available for them since they dug too deep. They have done too much due to HFs’ arrogancy and Icarus syndrome.If debtors (bankers) force the margin call and liquidate Shitadel's short position yesterday, MOASS. then Shitadel should have been bankrupt which might trigger a deep recession. However, yes as everybody knows no squeeze yesterday. But a short squeeze is possible at any time, just HFs deferred it as long as they can but not long term anymore as you see FED is stepping in. It looks like bankers have extended HFs SLR as the exception cause it is too big to kill and its damage is also too big to swallow for them (simply bankers will lose tons of billions). I believe HFs’ main focus is covering their short positions without the short squeeze. Not sure how much time they earned but I believe $AMC and $GME SP will climb steadily as FED/SEC will put strict regulations such as limitation of short volume, no short laddering (including other tactical manipulation), and enhance the transparency of HFs. Let’s see what will happen next.This is not financial advice but just my idea. The investment decision should be based on your DD.Be Blessed and Be Strong."
"I know its not a whole lot in the big scheme of things, but I filed a complaint to the SEC, one person wont make an impact but if they receive 1000-10,000,-100,000 complaints of market malpractice and illegal activity, theres always a little hope. https://www.sec.gov/oiea/Complaint.htmlBought more shares today, filed to the SEC, spread DD, spread likes, upvotes. about to enjoy the weekend.See you all monday"
"Just called my local AMC theatre to see if they had information on the MOASS. Lady on the phone said, ""Please HOLD"". I said' ""Absolutely!"""
"Just remember that yesterday during pre market the Hedge Funds shorted another 2.2 million shares to drive the price down. They’re trying the same thing today. If they keep the price under $60 by tomorrow’s close, they will save themselves billions of dollars and they may also prevent a gamma squeeze. BUY and HOLD!"
"Attn: Schwab Brokerage Traders- I called the brokerage line today to have them administratively change it so that my purchased shares would not be on lend. They told me as long as nothing is in my margin account or debited, it will not be lent to other traders. To confirm, I repeated that no short sellers could borrow my shares to short, and he said that was correct. This setting is on by default - as long as there is nothing in your margin account. There, saved you 25 minutes on hold. You're welcome."

"Read this carefully.. $AMC results are pushed to March 2 nd.. This is actually good news - 1. We don’t break the momentum.2. Call options are going to get exercised in the money getting more shares bought and virtually nothing to short3. Earnings are for Q4 with no business which is already known to the world. 4. Reason for pushing the results is to declare positive news like a buyout or completion of fund raising and grown in Covid free summer to come.We can very well be in 20s this Friday, in 100s after Monday and in 1000s after positive newsboys earnings.. life changing returns to gain and nothing to loose really.Hit like and keep on top so everyone understands. Let go to the moon  and beyond  "
"Reposted from Reddit WHY IS AMC GOING DOWN: EXPLAINEDFirst able, this is not financial advise but I have seen people asking this so much, so I'm gonna explain what is happening.Why does AMC keep going down even if we are holding? Because of MARKET MANIPULATION. Hedge funds know a way to trick the algorithm so that the numbers keep going down. They basically sell their stocks back and forth between them so that people start thinking that everybody is selling. This is known as short ladder attack (since the negative volume emulates the pattern of a ladder). Based on the Order Book (L2), the amount of BUY orders are way way way bigger than the amount of SELL orders. People are buying and holding, but yet the stock keeps going down. These numbers are psychological, market manipulation will not last forever and eventually the stock will skyrocket.AMC is the most purchased stock in Robinhood right now, which is basically all you need to know. AMC is not dead, in fact is the most hyped stock right now.Once the market manipulation stops we will win this fight. This is a patience duel. AMC is currently below negative 10%, which means SSR (Short-Sale Rule) will take place tomorrow Tuesday 9th. This means shorts will have it harder to short AMC and we have a chance to recover.Just stay positive, the Gamestop phenomenon took 5 weeks to happen. And even if AMC doesn't squeeze as expected, it is an over $20 stock. They have cleared debt thanks to this movement and people will go back to the movies now that the vaccine is being distributed. Also there are rumors that Amazon and Netflix would be looking to purchase AMC, which would be huge for current AMC stock holders. But these are just rumors.STAY POSITIVE, STAY STRONG. WE LOVE THE STOCK AND WE LOVE THE MOVIES!!!! UPVOTE SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON."
ORTEX is classifying $AMC as being a Short Squeeze (Type 3) with a rating of 4.5/5.

"Sharing a draft about $AMC synthetic shares. While $AMC share price has been suppressed in last few days, we just had the announcement today about $AMC share counts. The news release shows an image which all of us have recently been talking about, and it is basically consistent with what we thought.I am sharing a simple summary that may help to draw a clear and simple picture based on public data.- 501,780,240 shares outstanding as of June 2, 2021- approximately 4.1 million1 individual shareholders eligible to vote at the upcoming Shareholder Meeting- More than 80% of AMC shares are held by a broad base of retail investors with an average holding of around 120 shares. Shares held by retail investors ~ 80% x 501,780,240 ~ 401,424,192- As of June 9th, 2021 from a top brokerage firm: Institutional Stock Ownership 12.6% Institutional Mutual Fund Ownership 10.4% Mutual Fund Ownership 3.2% Insider Ownership 6.5% Other 67.4% Total of institution ownership: 12.6% + 10.4% + 3.2% = 26.2% Total of the rest excluding individual retail investors: 26.2% + 6.5% = 32.7% Equivalent number of shares covered by record excluding shares from individual owners: 32.7% x 501,780,240 = -164,082,138 shares Shares needed to cover the records: -63.72M = 501.78M - 401.42M - 164.08M- Synthetic shares: total number of synthetic shares: Z naked shorts: X naked call contracts: Y other naked shares: W Z = X + Y + W Short interest: Assuming 21% SI which is about 100.4M shares Minimum number of synthetic shares from public records: 100.4M - 63.72M ~ 37M (assume all 63.72M shares were still amid transactions, this is very unlikely) Hidden number of synthetic shares: U: a lot discussions in forums estimate that this number is huge, its estimation could be more than 1B. Here are the cases we may basically have for synthetic shares:* The worst case: all 63.72M shares were overlapped with shorted shares (very unlikely), then synthetic shares are about 37M = 100.4M - 63.72M.* The best case: none of 63.72M shares is overlapped with shorted shares (very likely or very closely), then synthetic shares are about 164M = 100.4M + 63.72M.* The super best case: large number of hidden synthetic shares (very likely), then synthetic shares are much more than 164M* Conclusion with high probability: Minimum number of synthetic shares 164M (known) + multiples of 164M (estimated)[Bottom line]: 164M or MUCH MUCH MORE synthetic shares will have to be covered by real shares, most of these shares need to be from individual investors. Hope this post can be helpful to some of you to understand the current picture of $AMC. Data shows us that the time is getting closer. The current price volatility is just a part of the process. The ride is still going forwards while it may not be as easy as some of you thought. We know we are on the way up and will go much further. GLTL."
"Okay listen very carefully, like this so everyone sees it. Over the weekend, shorts, bashers and bots will be out in force with trying convincing arguments as to why you should sell. Some of these guys will come in the form of pretend shareholders acting like they care about you saying that they too themselves are going to sell on Monday. Do not listen to them or pay them any mind. This is the time that will now separate the boys from the men. RH is in trouble, they are losing millions of users over the weekend and guess what those users will be doing next week? Switching to more reputable brokers and buying. This is a global trend now, there's no hiding the fact that the manipulation and corruption is happening on a much larger scale. I hold NAKD and AMC CURRENTLY because I like the companies and what they are doing. I'm not intelligent, I get my advice from my 6 year old sister. WSB. $GME $NAKD $SNDL $AMC"

There needs to be coordinated action getting this into the news about Amc the sec and dark pools. If this market manipulation is possible then how can the little man ever invest its a rigged system to exploit. It has to be stopped not just for us but for everywhere it happens. What's the point of investing if it isn't. As for all these bashers and a psychological point of view on it why would anyone put so much effort into bashing if they didn't get anything from it. Its not kids in the playground teasing it's grown men and woman. This just doesn't happen of there's no upside for being a basher. It's as clear as day to me and that's why I hold. In fact every basher just strengthens my resolve as I know they have an agenda. They are not your friends lol. I could care less what they say I will hold and I buy one share every dip. Nobody helps you in life you help yourself. Be aware of this when a basher is begging you daily to sell. Good luck people.

"$AMC.... The rocket is on the truck, and we are on our way to the launch pad.... Everything is prime for take off, except for the volume. The volume IS up today considerably, and I predict it will close around 215 million.... However, I'm saying that the squeeze will trigger at above 400 million.... March 19th (with the new SEC Ruling) and May 4th (when every share will be accounted for as per AMC move) will end most of the artificial pricing we have been seeing. Combined with Theatres opening across the country and Vaccine roll out, I think WE are in good shape.....Now WHY IN THE WORLD would you wanna sell at $10, $15, $20?..... When THIS blows, it will be big.... Three figures at least.... Don't settle for peanuts, when you can buy the whole circus!!!And all you have to do is RELAX & HOLD!!!! Easy peasy... History, in America, has always taught us: In UNITY there is strength!! AND, we not only make money, but we also save a great American tradition: the iconic Movie Theatre Experience!!! In solidarity my brothers & sisters... God bless us all!!!Cut & paste and re-share IF you so desire.. Nothing better than to rally the troops with hope..."
"AMC investors:Hedge funds and paid shills have underestimated the AMC investors currently holding the stock. Hedge funds arrogance and the reliance on algorithms have not helped hedge funds to achieve their goal(s) and this is why paid shills are still a heavy presence here on the AMC thread, as well as the HOOD thread. This battle is still ongoing with hedge funds believing they can continue to illegally naked short and to 'park buy orders' in the order flow process while dumping 'sell' orders on the open market, with the hope that investors, seeing a small spike' will get bored of the continuous 'ups and downs' of the stock and be motivated to sell. I cannot provide a date on the expected squeeze but can tell you that patience will reward. We are waiting on any one of the potential catalysts to propel this stock to new highs and there are some major economic events expected to impact the markets and those events will most likely impact AMC in a positive manner. Remember, AMC IS BACKED BY BILLIONS OF SYNTHETIC SHARES. While I worry about my positions in other stocks, I do not worry about AMC. THE QUESTION IS NOT 'IF' A SQUEEZE WILL OCCUR, IT IS 'WHEN' AND ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT IT IS INEVITABLE!!!"

"Why AMC is Down Today.AMC is down 2.58% on the day and down 10% on the week. It looks like the big dog shorters are raising the short interest and increasing the stock utilization to try to shake the unshakable hands of the APES. The shorts ladder attacks a few days ago has brought shares down to support levels, but has fail to rescue the shorts from their imminent demise. In Short( pun intended), the shorts continue to bleed money as the steadfast APES continue to HOLD and HODL with no risk. Good job APE community. We shall be victorious!"
"There is a discussion that some are beginning to discuss the potential collapse of the market and are now claiming that GME and AMC could be used as a market hedge against market weakness. hmmm. We listened to months of why we should sell out of AMC and now, they are claiming something contrary to their earlier comments requesting that we sell."
"The buzz on AMC is mad. Something is brewing. I'm happy to just be in the game for long term but I get this feeling that there's going to be a huge event next week, like an acquisition news or joint venture news. Mutual funds don't load up for fun. They know something."

"It’s insane how people are comparing AMC with GME. AMC is going through a healthy surge in prices from opening its doors and good news ahead. It has not even gone through its gamma and short squeeze which is to come. With the upwards momentum and if it continues upwards in upcoming weeks, the squeeze(s) would be imminent. When that happens, that is when you can compare AMC with GME. While GameStop was well ahead of AMC. GME holders held late Nov and Early Dec of 2020. While AMC began late Jan from the hype of GME. It is obvious that AMC would happen later since its interests was gained much later."

IMO that is very strong language and if we don’t squeeze this week, the game is still on. There is no set date, I have much respect for Trey, but I do not agree with the “make or break”, so don’t get discouraged if we don’t moon shot this week"
"For those upset about postponement of the shareholder meeting, a bit of perspective. The earnings release and call this week is what ""investors"" look at and listen to. In our case, specifically the forward looking statements. This is the call that matters. A shareholder meeting is just to give retail the warm fuzzies. This comes from many years in executive management in a publicly traded company."
"The SEC investigating BofA is simply fodder, PR, lip service to justice. When have the big banks EVER been accountable for ANYTHING??? They won't penalize the banks, they won't force Citadel to liquidate their fake shares or shorts, they'll slap them on the wrist and then make whatever they're engaged in FULLY legal. That's how these things go. Don't get your hopes up for ""justice being done"" by changing the current stock market dynamics. These people and institutions OWN the market, they're the ones who write the rules, nothing will change. If this pops back above $50, I'm changing my strategy, selling, and swing trading this until it's back below $20.00. I should've been doing that from the beginning, I'd be sitting on over $500K right now instead of $17K waiting and praying for a short squeeze. Citadel has admitted, they ARE the market-maker and they set the price, regardless of how many shares are purchased and held by measly retail traders like us."
Don't sell your shares otherwise this won't squeeze
"AMC Army: DO NOT PANIC. This is just part of the volatility that exists with the stock. It will go up and will go down but it will reach new higher highs as it continues to climb until the short squeeze occurs.THE SHORT SQUEEZE IS IMMINENT.The hedge funds have created a major mess and the SEC, DTC, and others have done nothing to stop their fleecing of capital from the common investor in order to benefit the hedge funds wealthy clientele.The goal of hedge funds and their paid shills is to create panic and fear within the retail community.Additionally, do not allow the hedge funds and their paid shills to divide the GME and AMC community. We are partners and are both striving for the same thing."
"After $AMC reached ATH, today it's taking a break at $47.91. This is actually a great ending of this amazing week of $AMC. In fact, all data is pointing to a stronger uprun storm in upcoming weeks. Today's closing is way above old ATH, we know that* all open short positions before this week are deeply trapped, * more than 18M shares need to be delivered for the ITM calls expiring today, * potentially more than 10M shares are needed for next week call option delivery assuming price will go above 50 next Friday. This number can be way bigger if next Friday closing is much higher. In addition to what we have already known about $AMC in last few months, let's simply put together the followings to see what the current picture of $AMC is:* After 20M new shares going into the market, we can still stand at today's closing, way above old ATH, amazingly strong. * More importantly, the first 8.5M shares had almost no power to bring price down, and price recovered quickly after the second 11.5M shares out.* Today's closing was heavily suppressed to handle today's option contracts - this move was actually expected.* There will be no more new shares out to the market this year (according to news release). So the other side can no longer have this level of power by easily accessing to a huge number of shares within a week/days.And more1. All shorts before this week are trapped because today's closing is way above old ATH.2. Shorts receiving margin calls will have to buy-to-cover that will trigger short squeeze.3. Short squeeze will drive price higher to trigger gamma squeeze.4. Here (2) and (3) will keep pushing each other to drive price higher and higher.5. FOMO will bring more longs into play and drive price higher while price is rising up.6. Longs will buy more to take this unique opportunity.7. More foreign investors may join in like what happened in India and Korea.8. Shares available to short are drying out, so the other side will have less and less power to drive price down. We had a great week, but don't be surprised if you see FUD around this weekend. The above give us more than enough confidence to stay calm and relax on this weekend; the best for longs is to do so, enjoy the weekend and come back to the ride next Monday. Hold strong, buy the dip within capacity of spending and risk taking. We know that we are on the way up. GLTL."

"50 with fries please, by Friday thank you."
!!! Please like this comment and respond so it gets to the top of the list !!!Big money managers and short sellers are going to manipulate the stock in the after hours session to scare retail holders and the general public into selling their shares. this will occur during after hours today and pre market monday. It is going to be inevitable that if we keep the price inflated they will evenutally have to cover the short postions they are holding which will in turn send the price up significantly please be disciplined and dont let emotion scare you out of a large profit. you may see at times mass gains and drops in price. good luck to all holders we have come this far have a great weekend and see you all monday
If $amc and $gme have taught us anything it’s obvious there is nothing but shills spreading fud on this board. This stock is heavily manipulated and shorted… matter of time before this blasts off.
AMC and GME Stocks: Citadel Drama Intensifies!
"Reposting from Art: $AMC conversationReposting from Art: MUST READ — JUST PUBLISHED BY CNA FINANCE. Link is in comments.AMC Entertainment (AMC) Stock Will FlyAMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) is a stock that has become the black sheep of Wall Street as of late, with article after article, warning investors that they should stay away from the stock at all costs.But how did one of the most successful movie theaters in the world become the black sheep of Wall Street? Was it COVID-19? You would think, but no!The fact is that short sellers have been passing around a silver platter filled with bovine feces and telling investors that it’s quality due diligence. They have convinced even the experts that AMC stock is going to fall to zero. They’ve urged retailers to stay away, all while their short positions resulted in significant losses for the very investors that they say their reports are designed to protect.Well, I’m going to get quite a few experts upset with me here, but the fact of the matter is that you can’t blindly follow names like Citron and Hindenburg research, like many covering AMC stock have been doing.The War Wages OnRecently, retail investors have shown they’ve had enough of the hedge fund manipulation through short positions that rob small investors of the value in the stocks they care about. The war became clear when GameStop went for a tremendous run for the top, essentially becoming the figurative symbol that retail investors painted on their chests before going to war.Since, we’ve seen short squeezes on several stocks, and in my view, it’s just the beginning.AMC Is The Next BattlegroundThe tension between the bears and the bulls is heating up when it comes to AMC stock. To be fair, I’m going to outline both arguments here:The BearsThe bears have a relatively simple argument. They argue that movie theaters in general have been losing their luster over the years, and that the COVID-19 pandemic will be the final nail in the coffin for these businesses.Moreover, the bears say that while various movie theaters are opening back up, fears surrounding COVID-19 will keep sales at a minimum, ultimately handing these companies a financial weight that none of them will be able to hold up.Ultimately, the bears say that at the moment, we’re experiencing the death of movie theaters as we know it, and that if you invest in these companies, companies like AMC, you’re going to experience losses.The BullsI want to be very clear here, if I haven’t been already. I am a believer in movie theaters. Moreover, I’m a believer in AMC and the company’s ability to rise from the ashes like the phoenix and that those with short positions should stop spreading smut about this opportunity.So, what’s the deal?The real deal here is simple. Movie theaters are an iconic form of entertainment that aren’t going anywhere any time soon. In fact, I believe that we’ll soon see a big uptick in revenue among movie theaters for two very big reasons, and that AMC will be a prime beneficiary of this activity. Here’s why:COVID Could Actually Revive The Movie Theater Experience. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers have been stuck at home. As vaccines get jabbed into arms, consumers aren’t just more willing to get out of the house, they will have a strong desire to do so. After all, it’s a whole new, and for the vaccinated, safe world out there. Why not explore again? With the movie theater experience being an iconic one in the United States, movies and dinner will likely become a major date night plan yet again. So, while short sellers say COVID will kill theaters, I say it has the potential to breathe new life into them.Summer Is Coming. Consumers being willing to travel couldn’t come at a better time for the movie theater industry. Summer is the time when the biggest blockbuster releases come, and with summer just around the corner and vaccines finding their ways into arms, there’s a strong chance that we’re going to see a significant boost in revenue among movie theaters.Beyond the fact that movie theaters are likely to make a big comeback very soon, the company is sitting on a solid financial foundation. Even through all the pain, AMC has plenty of cash on the balance sheet, with the CEO telling investors that the company has no plans to sell a single newly issued share in 2021. That’s a strong statement from a company that bears say can’t afford to survive.The Next Battle Is Coming SoonI recently wrote a post about a short squeeze that’s likely coming to AMC stock, and it was met with quite a bit of feedback from both sides of the coin. I got praised and cursed tens of times throughout the day. It’s clear that emotions surrounding the stock are high, and those high emotions are likely to lead to explosive movement.Chances are, that movement will be in the upward direction."
Bulls and longs are in control. George W cup and handle bull flag with breakout imminent. Time to cover shorts
Yesterday was very significant day for those trading ( or trapped ) in AMC. You judge a stock by how it reacts to news. Yesterday we had very positive news of a blockbuster weekend box office. Initially the stock climbed over 39 then collapsed under 37. If you had any doubts before....it is now clear what direction this stock is headed. DOWN !
"Look it up for yourselves, Amazon in talks with AMC about purchasing them…. Imagine getting free movie tickets with prime and Amazon just bought MGM studies recently so this ain’t no gimmicks"
"What a killer time to be holding a boat-load of AMC with the volume and price increasing daily huh? 30 million, 40 million, 50 million and tomorrow I predict massive volume that will top today by some measure and you want to know why? Well... if you don't study charts much I would encourage you to start now and look at AMC's one month chart on Yahoo and please compare the current price, 10 day, and 50 day moving averages and make sure you use one day intervals. What you will see is when AMC closed today at $10.32 the price had just broken over the 50 day moving average and people that's on a one month chart. Now look back on the chart a few days to the last time you see the current price breaking over the 50 day moving average. To save you time the and effort the last time this happened was on April 4th and the price was at $9.11. After that occurred, the price shot up to 11.50 within the next 2 weeks. That's nearly a $2.50 move and I expect to see a similar occurrence but at even a a faster pace with volume picking up like it has been lately. The best part is, the higher the price steadily climbs, (look at AMC's 5 day chart) the more confidence retailers will have and when you couple that with the number of people buying and holding with so much upside potential we could see a move of over $3.00 to the upside from this price and now in the after hours the price is at $10.40 so we're breaking even higher over the 50 day as I type. I won't even talk about the possibility of a mega-squeeze which I for one am not relying on. Lastly, AMC is practically the only stock in my portfolio that saw an increase today and that's one heck of a lot to be said with the DOW down almost 700 points. I know I already said lastly but finally... Look at the futures of every index...If I were shorting this stock... oh forget it... I'd never short this stock. GO LONGS..!"
AMC will be around $500 by Friday after the ultra gamma short squeeze hits. Hold strong!
"$AMC $HOODGotta laugh at the media report yesterday where Chad Beynon (analyst at Macquarie Group) downgraded AMC share price to $6.00.... Hahaha... SO OBVIOUS, he is doing the bidding of his boss... There are MANY connections between Macquarie and Citadel... -Citadel's Head Of Commodities, Sebastian Barrack, was at Macquarie for 20 years before moving over to Citadel.-Citadel and Macquarie have been working together for years. Macquarie's Chairman, Kevin McCann, in 2014, did a small cap prospectus with Citadel being introduced by Broker Evans & Partners...So this ""announcement"" was a Media hatchet job to attack the AMC share price and bring it down... THEY ARE VERY DESPERATE!!!! I like that... SHOWS that we are close to the Big Squeeze... And with all that, they can't keep the price down...Meanwhile, RH continues to flounder.... EVENTUALLY sinking below its IPO launch price of $38.00... IT IS COMING!!!!Viva la AMC!!!"
EVERYONE go back and look at January 27! Just before it went up to $25 it barcoded just like today a few cents up and down before it took off to $25. This time there are no stocks left to short!!!!!!!
"Actually I am pretty impressed that shorties are still fighting with their full strengths, such as, ladder attack, naked short selling, bot spamming, bribe media and so on. Yes, they used to win with those tactics before but not anymore. Some people said it is David (retail investors) VS Goliath (hedge funds) but it should be other around since we have much more aggregated total funds than those hedge funds have. Beside, time is on our side since every second shorties are bearing interest cost exponentially and there are lots of pressure from margin call. TRUST THE PROCESS AND LOGIC. WE WILL WIN THIS WAR. WE TOGETHER, STRONG!!!$GME, $AMC"
"Nice today looking strong and has regained the lead after that horrible manipulation yesterday. Great job to those of you buying and holding through all this manipulation. We buy we hold and we wait for the shorts to cover and trigger massive squeezes. We dont need price predictions, we dont need chart analysis, and we done need fundamentals we just need to keep it simple and wait for moass which can happen at any moment."

"GameStop, AMC extend rallies, gouging short sellers!Shares of GameStop (GME.N) and cinema operator AMC Entertainment (AMC.N) rallied to their highest levels in months on Wednesday, with some market-watchers saying the recent surge was forcing bearish investors to unwind their bets against the video game retailer.GameStop shares surged 15.8% to $242.56, around its highest level since mid-March, while AMC shares shot up 19.2% to $19.56, the highest since Jan. 27. CFRA on Wednesday raised its price target for AMC shares to $18 from $2.50.About 20.6% of AMC shares are sold short, according to Dusaniwsky who notes that even as the shares have been rallying, short-sellers have been adding to their exposure, selling 1.18 million shares short over the last week.With the rally in AMC shares, now up 822% for the year-to-date, shorts are down $1.37 billion in year-to-date mark-to-market losses, including $290 million losses from Wednesday's rally, S3 data showed.https://www.reuters.com/technology/gamestop-amc-extend-rallies-gouging-short-sellers-2021-05-26/"
"What a great position we are in now. The SSR was hit today meaning no short laddering tomorrow. The price is lower meaning huge FOMO buys.

It is not a matter of whether, but it is a matter of when. Dont want to get caught with being out when it really does jump. definitely in the next 12months: we will see a spike (to a big#) and stabilize at 20+ or 30+Will be the $Amc of the next 12months if not much earlier (i did buy amc at 8s fyi). if you can, park some in here. dont need an MM to tell you that. sorry to tag amc here but it was one of my best fetching investments, hence…"

"Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. There's room for both squeezes, lets go boys."
"Name me another group chat for AMC Yahoo, Reddit, StockTwits, or discord that has that amount of views and attention as AMC every single Day. Name me another talked about stock literally from 7 year olds to 65 year olds. From the complete beginner to people that’s been In the market for decades. Name me another stock in the entertainment sector that’s insanely undervalued as AMC. Roku has a market cap over $50 Billion. Netflix has a Market cap over $250 billion. Disney has a market cap over $360 billion. The biggest movie theater chain in the world has only a market cap of $6 billion dollars. Name me another stock with so much downside and literally infinite upside. Yeah! sorry you can’t convince me other wise that $AMC isn’t insanely undervalued.  even at $100 $AMC at a market cap of $45 billion will still be undervalued. They have 1 billion dollar cash on hand that can mean so many things they can do for growth and opening up more innovating theaters. They also have a huge chance to dominate their competition like Netflix or Disney. It’s only a matter of time before they will get completely destroyed with their evil and dishonest action. We are doing this not just for us but, for a bigger purpose to help or loved ones and people in our communities struggling in these times, For all the Beautiful stories that was shared on Reddit for the people that are going to difficult times in the life battling cancer and difficulties, For our world to be better place from the evil and greed these hedge funds do to hard working innocent people. Because we all know what they’re doing is obvious now and completely out of desperation. Thank you and I salute every one holding and buying more at any price. WeWillNotLeave "

Ask yourself this though, do you believe GME stock should be over $100? Is Tesla worth $700? We could go on and on. This is just another tactic to try and get us holders to sell. It's not working with me. Holding here."
Gap up in the morning due to anticipated FOMO as today is digested
"$GME's volume yesterday was 93 Million. $AMC volume was 1.2 billion. $GME increased pps by $200.00, $AMC increased pps by $15.00. The difference is a buy and hold mentality vs a buy and sell for profit one. We did 12 times the volume yet only increased $15 per share.The key to winning here is not the volume, its what you do with the shares that you buy. If you buy and hold the price will go up. If you buy and sell the price will stay stagnant or limp along up or down.This will not be over on 01/29. The amount of shorting did not occur in one or 2 days so the amount of squeezing will not correct months of this in one or 2 days. People are selling to make pennies or in some cases a couple bucks a share but if everyone who bought shares would just hold them we could possibly be selling for hundreds of dollars per share.I have a small position as I am the little gut in all of this. My small position wont make me millions, it won't even change my life. But it will give me a greater opportunity to reinvest and hopefully overtime achieve that life changing stock purchase.If you don't believe in the power of purchase and hold, go look at $GME. It can be done.Best of luck to all."
"FUNNY Oxford dictionary defines a Hedge Fund as..... hedge fundnouna limited partnership of investors that uses high risk methods, such as investing with borrowed money, in hopes of realizing large capital gains.But yet the retail investors are the problem.... no we are the solution to addressing their greed.I love AMC, I love that the world is getting better, and I love that this process has allowed the playing field to be corrected!Going forward maybe Hedge Funds will be a better community partner!"

"A short message to share in addition to all positive information from others in this board. 1. looking into the $AMC daily chart, a very clear volume-price divergence trend is shown in last three weeks. 2. this data shows a potentially very strong uptrend run in following days/weeks.3. apparently short squeeze seems delayed by some force, this has been tried hard to try to shake off the paper hands, to buy more time as much as possible, to reduce the power of squeeze, etc.4. major margin calls seem not starting yet, it can start at anytime.5. newly approved NSCC-002 seems not really being executed in practice yet, when it is effectively in action, changes will immediately show up.6. price strongly standing around this level (mainly around $50~$60) for three weeks looks very much like a consolidation before a big blowing up.7. it seems a lot of ""buy the dip"" and FOMO catching up in last a couple of weeks. 8. data shows still a lot of short attacks in last few days, hence price moves shows there has been no major sells from longs.Expectation will be that when the critical line is crossed, explosion follows,  time coming.

"Enforcement of the SEC's new rule on off-exchange securities starts January 3rd! If the new rule is ACTUALLY upheld, you can say, ""bye bye"" to dark pools! :D The mandated transparency of off-exchange securities data for the public and SEC removes the hedge funds ability to control order flow, and subsequently eliminates share price manipulation. Regardless, January 3rd will solidify the retail investors' sentiments towards the integrity of the stock market based on the actions of SEC at that time. Good luck fellow investors!"

"i have to laugh when a paid shill believes he or she is going to attempt to be rational. They tell you that you (the investor) has no understanding of what a paid shill is or does. They need to remember this is not a political board and we are not their puppets. The retail investor has much more access to information that hedge funds would like to believe is off limits to the common investor.The disadvantage that retail investors have is that they do not have the billions of dollars to buy their friends (Politicians, regulatory agencies, social media) and buy the silence of their enemies. If we were playing at the same level, hedge funds would not be winning and AMC WOULD HAVE SQUEEZED A LONG TIME AGO. I told many about my brother-in-law who owned a hedge fund and relied on many short strategies as his primary source of revenue. He enjoyed shorting stocks and it impacted family relations. HEDGE FUNDS DO NOT EARN MONEY, THEY MAKE MONEY AND IN MANY CASES, THEY MAKE THIS MONEY BY FLEECING CAPITAL FROM THE COMMON INVESTOR. THEY HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR YEAR BUTThe difference now, is that retail investors eyes have been opened and as a result are not willing to kowtow to the demands of the hedge funds. IF THAT IS WHAT PAID SHILLS, SOCIAL MEDIA AND HEDGE FUNDS CALL GREEDY, What do they call someone who has just stolen money from the common investor and from the accounts he or she manages in order to hide it in offshore accounts. For years, the wealthy have created financial structures that enable them to protect their assets from tax consequences and while many in government would send the message to 'tax the rich' Well, that was never possible as the rich had their assets protected; therefore, the tax the rich led to tax increases on the middle and lower socioeconomic classes to make up for the tax shortfall. What is the definition of GREEDY. Lets wait to see if STOCKHOUND will provide the definition. He appears to be the expert on just about EVERYTHING."

"Well, I'm not sure who can see this, but most TA people on trading view are rationally predicting AMC to $200 within the next few months."
It must be brutal to be a short on AMC! Talking about the wrong side of the trade. Shorts are getting weaker by the day!   shorts  
"Today is the day the hedge funds bleed out. Total short interest in $AMC is over $1 Billion. The short interest ratio is over 30%. SSR is still in effect. Robinhood allowing 5,500 shares of the stock today. Oh, and Elon Musk defended us... not a financial advisor. I like the stock"
Evergrande will affect for AMC. Banks have to call their loans back from Evergrande 1.8 million people are stiffed banks are owed. Margin calls will happen World wide.
Block a bear buy share
"Bank of America has a more than 75% probability score for bankruptcy, via MacroAxis. The fact is there is no path that can save overleveraged institutions or short sellers betting against $AMC. The future of BoA is grim. Amc is the $hood"

"---- What is really happening to AMC--------Re posting because yahoo deleted it the first time---I am going to sum everything up for you in the most simple way possible. We are a community of strangers and we've been through more challenges together then most close friends do in a life time. So I will be clear when I say this...We are winning this revolution. Plain and simple. So... Let me make a basic checklist of tactics they are already using to weaken us. Why because we have ""stepped out of line""...1-False reporting of data (already seen in ortex with short utilization, interest etc)2-Drive the share price up and then crash it (to destroy our morale)3-Create false news articles and more recently hijacking trusted social media accounts to spread FUD (seen on AMC facebook group) - Citadel is a major share holder of facebook by the way4-Create infighting within our community (AMC vs GME and so on) (we are all apes fighting for the same cause)5-Prepping us to look forward to dates (like the June share recount) so when nothing happens on that date we create our own self destructive FUD.PLAIN AND SIMPLEThere will be many more tactics used against us, expect it to get harder to hold on to your shares but keep that conviction you had at the beginning because when you least expect it, its going to pop.They are fighting for their lives right now and don't care about laws anymore and that should give you comfort. Holding is easy, buying is easy. If you are in it for the squeeze then the daily price action does not matter, it is all psychological. At this point they are in too deep for them not to cover. Even the basic false data they are reporting is still looking amazing for us...so relax, it will take time, get on with your lives and stop worrying about what they are doing or the price action. Stop worrying about dates or future catalysts. stop worrying about what fellow apes are saying or not saying. -At this point it is a complete exposure of the corruption in our system, a ""class warfare"" so hold strong, we are winning.-Love you all, K(This is not financial advice or any sort of advice for that matter. This post is just my opinion. I don't really know anything. I eat crayons, trip on my shoe laces and hold my own hand when I cross the street by myself.)"
"New York Stock Exchange charged Citadel Securities LLC with engaging in wash sales 502,243 times using its computer algorithms."

"$AMC has over 320,000 options expiring today. Read that again! Hold, out of 57 million shares about 45 are being shorted. Thats a lot of covering needed. This will explote people. Like this so that we can get it to the top."
"HFs returned those 6mil shares they borrowed today, i guess they were just used as a scare tactic. They wont short 6mil shares anyway when the short interest is at 14.4% and market crash coming up... market crash benefits AMC, cause it will trigger margin calls."
"Guys, stick to $AMC. Citadel is pumping volume into other stocks to make it seem as they are squeezing. And putting extra false selling pressure. Please be smart, Citadel is now across all social platforms. Stick to $AMC. Stay strong!"
Load up as much as you can afford to hold. A modest chunk and stay the course. George W cup and handle bull flag indicates massive upside coming

"AMC short sellers lose $1.5 Billion after 134% rally! - June 2, 2021 by Tyger FitzpatrickNet losses surpass $1.5 Billion for AMC short sellersThe continued momentum in AMC stock has seen short sellers lose upwards of $1.5 Billion this week according to Ortex data. Interestingly, as of Friday last week across the board of AMC, GME and SPCE short sellers have accumulated a net loss of over $1.8 Billion. It seems AMC’s popularity amongst retail investors may be attributed to its recent performance gaining 219% this month alone. We will see if these losses will continue into this week as retail investors continue to push AMC stock higher.https://youth-investment-group.com/2021/06/02/amc-short-sellers-lose-1-3-billion-after-117-rally/"
I must say $AMC is a real winner! Pretty much all day long I am watching other stocks and they are just going down and being pumped and dumped or manipulated with short attacks but amc is different because it has strong ape support to combat some of the manipulation but other stocks dont seem to have the same type of protection.
"AMC short sellers lost $512 million after Monday's rally - OrtexTue, June 15, 2021(Reuters) -Investors shorting ""meme stock"" AMC Entertainment Holdings are estimated to have lost about $512 million on Monday after a rally that sent the cinema operator's shares up more than 15%, data from financial analytics firm Ortex showed.By contrast, AMC short-sellers suffered $1.2 billion in mark-to-market losses for the week to May 28, when small-time traders on online discussion groups sent the stock up about 116% by triggering a phenomenon known as a ""short squeeze"".AMC shares were up 2% at $58.12 in premarket trading on Tuesday. The stock has surged more than 2,580% so far this year, riding a wave of support from individual traders who have come together on online forums such as Reddit's Wall Street Bets.Recent reports from brokerages Fidelity and Freetrade show AMC has been the most traded stock by their customers, many of whom are small-time investors.Market sources told Reuters last week that the volatility in AMC shares had led some professional traders to use options to limit their risk as they make bearish bets on the stock.AMC has raised funds in recent weeks by issuing fresh equity to hedge fund Mudrick Capital and selling stock ""at-the-market"", as it capitalizes on the blistering rally in its stock. It plans to use the proceeds to repay debt and for potential acquisitions of theaters.(Reporting by Sagarika Jaisinghani, Aaron Saldanha in Bengaluru and Sujata Rao in London; Editing by Anil D'Silva)"

"The billionaires showed no mercy to us when they wiped out the middle class in the 2008 financial crisis. Then they had “experts” and “financial advisors” going all over the media telling us it was our fault why we are poor. We should live frugal, we should work 10 jobs to make ends meet and we should pay higher taxes while we celebrate them as “role models” we should aspire to become. Show no mercy because we finally get a chance to correct this injustice done to us. My selling price for each of my $AMC shares is $1,000 and the selling price for my $GME shares is $25,000. What do I have to lose when Wallstreet wiped out everything from the middle class in 2008? "

"Short Squeeze Here’s why this matters: • Not only are shorts losing money every day but huge hedge funds are bleeding billions of dollars due to retail investors holding • This is a huge win for retail investors – our favorite companies have been saved • Unless shorts close their positions, hedge funds will continue to suffer • Interest rates will continue to skyrocket for short sellers, enabling them to close their positions sooner than later • An AMC short squeeze might be closer then you think.Here’s what retail investors can do: 1 Continue to hold your positions, it’s free 2 Buy the dips to counter any short attacks 3 Share articles on social platforms that can provide value to the community and keep everyone informed 4 Keep a close eye on the stocks performance so you do not miss the squeeze.Hedge funds are not going to be able to recover from this. Yes they can possible receive help from huge banks but this too will be at a cost.Furthermore, borrowing money from banks won’t change the fact that shorts still have to cover their positions. Retail investors are buying AMC stock every day. Shorts are fighting a war they cannot win ."

The division is between the 'haves' and the 'have nots' I cannot get into the politics right now but the the haves do not wish for the common people or investors to be at their level financially, so they are allowing hedge funds to fleece your capital as this is how they will maintain control.

"Key Highlights • AMC closed at $44.26 on August 24th. The stock has surged since early this year due to volume despite short sellers attacking it. AMC Entertainment is set up for a short squeeze. • The perfect time to buy AMC stock is when the market is red, or what we refer to as on ‘discount’. AMC is looking bullish though, red days might just be over. • AMC entertainment continues to be the most heavily shorted stock in the market. • AMC’s short borrow fee continues to increase."

"I feel like there are a ton of new and confused traders in here so I'm going to help explain what's happening...Gamestop (GME) and (AMC) are two failing companies who's stocks got a bump in the market due to some recent good, but ultimately inconsequential news. That jump caused large multi-billion dollar short-selling hedge funds to short GME and AMC stock with the assumption that they'd continue to fall after their bumps.(Short selling is when someone borrows shares at a higher price then sells it with the assumption that they can buy the shares again later (1/29) at a cheaper price, give those shares back and then pocket the difference.)This is where we the people (FB, Reddit, Twitter..) come in to ruin their day.A bunch of us agree to flood AND HOLD! the stock with unexpected new money, causing the stock price to rise instead of fall. This causes the short sellers to lose money because they are going to have to give back those borrowed shares in the future (1/29).As the short sellers watch the stock rise alomg with their losses, they start folding one by one and buying the stock in order to give the shares back and close their position. Buying those shares causes the stock to rise which in turn puts MORE pressure on the short sellers and more of them have to buy more shares... This is called a SHORT SQUEEZE.On Friday (1/29), time will be up for many of the short sellers. They'll have to close out their positions by buying stock which will cause AMC and GameStop to sky rocket.That is why you BUY NOW (apply pressure and start your investment) and HOLD. Because every person that sells is relieving the pressure and reducing the billions of dollars the hedge funds will owe us, the little guys.The price will go up, and it will go down, just buy it and hold it at LEAST until Friday 1/29.I copied this comment so Copy and paste to educate the people!"
"Today's SEC filing shows Vanguard's VEXMX fund has increased their $AMC holdings from 768,494 shares to 1,633,595 shares. That's 112% increase. The info is on fintel.io.Go figure."

Facts:There are regulations due to be passed blah blah blah (i dont need to go into this again)500M share dilution gone - 43M outstanding shares they can use is a drop in the bucket. AA doing a share audit - now bashers spreading FUD about “how can we trust it”. You think AA isn’t going to ensure its done properly?? Come on...AMC moves earnings call up A MONTH. No insider info here but you don’t move earning up a month if its bad news. Basher out in full force! New ones every day. Its all good news folks. Don’t listen to the FUD, hold, buy if you can and just relax."

"Mudrick’s AMC Bet Backfires After Meme Frenzy Wrecks Hedges(Bloomberg) -- After weeks of profiting from the stock and debt of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., hedge fund Mudrick Capital Management ended up with a 5.4% loss after a derivatives bet went haywire.The fund, which specializes in distressed debt, suffered the losses on AMC after day traders pushed the movie theater’s shares up as much as 127% on a single day, derailing call options Mudrick had sold on AMC shares to hedge exposure to the company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on the losses.Up until the improbable surge in AMC’s shares, the firm founded by Jason Mudrick had been among the big winners on AMC securities after the hedge fund agreed to help keep the cinema chain afloat last year by committing to buy new debt issued by the company. That and other AMC positions helped the fund reap almost $200 million in gains in January, Bloomberg News previously reported. Then the firm bought about $230 million of new shares from the company in a deal announced June 1, shares it quickly flipped to day traders and other AMC enthusiasts for another profit.But that’s when things started to unravel.To protect the firm’s holdings from a market plunge, Mudrick sold call options that gave other investors the right to buy shares from him at pre-set levels -- most of which were at $40 or more -- well above any price at which the shares had ever traded.As AMC’s stock surged June 2 in its Reddit-fueled frenzy, the price suddenly blasted past the prices at which the fund’s counterparties could cash in on the call options, the person said. The hedges ended up losing 10%, causing the net loss of 5.4%.A representative for Mudrick declined to comment.Shedding RiskMudrick no longer has exposure to AMC after unwinding all of its debt, stock and derivatives bets. The firm is still up between 12% and 14% for the year, the person said.A risk committee for Mudrick Capital met virtually on the night of June 1 and decided to exit all debt and derivative positions the following day, the person said. Mudrick sold about a third of its exposure before the stock surged even further on June 2 and was fully out by that afternoon. The firm sold its 15% first-lien bonds in the theater chain for 121 cents on the dollar, the person added."

"On three hours of sleep a night and with no time to eat, one New York-based hedge fund manager overseeing billions in assets called last week the most stressful of his life.FILE PHOTO: A GameStop store is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., January 29, 2021. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri“Nothing was making sense anymore,” he said, as he watched the stock of GameStop Corp soar, while he bet it would fall.Wednesday was the worst. Fueled by chatter on Reddit and other social media to take on Wall Street, investors used venues like online trading app Robinhood to bid up the brick-and-mortar retailer. GameStop surged 135%, on its way to gaining more than 1,500% in January without any change in its business outlook. Hedge funds scrambled. By this point trading had become so unpredictable across all sectors that funds were forced to dump their winning stocks to balance out their portfolios.“It’s time to cut out,” the manager said he told his team. “Let’s live for another day.”"
"IMO, the reason it's difficult to create and follow an exit plan, is because one's exit plan should depend upon and change, according to how fast the share price rises and falls. Example: your exit plan would be very different if the share price rose 300% in one day vs a rise of 50% per day for many days. I think we'd all prefer to see a gradual consistent rise say 33% per day for many days, but profit takers and days traders, scalpers (10 minutes in and out) could make things extremely volatile. Huge downward episodes will cause many investors to adjust their exit plans. Share price could peak at anywhere from $300 per share to infinity if we see an overall stock market crash. Investors will be going in and out as they see trend reversals. After a 500% rise, say to $200 per share, we could see a 50% drop the next day to $100 per share and falling, what do you do? Some would sell, then consolidation for a week, and another trend reversal is obvious, $150 per share, and rising, do you get back in? Diamond hands will be selling as they see $100,000 profits etc., then maybe coming back in as they see staggering rises continue in share price. This should be a historic bumpy wild unpredictable crazy event. Everybody plans to make huge profits which can only be realized by selling, which brings share price down. Then however, what may be the effect upon AMC actually realizing impressive fundaments, P/E ratios, profit, and say the virus is being defeated and folks return in a big way to buying AMC Movie Tickets and large popcorns and large sodas????"
For what it’s worth amc is fighting strong in Frankfurt and attacking 48 currently and has crossed it. Looking for it to hold but 4am here will impact that. Still a good sign as amc is in beast mode
Its easy to keep the price down when they are not routing our buy orders through the exchange. Sending them to the dark pools.
Evergrande will force margin calls world wide as speculative lending will come into focus in world wide markets.

"this is who we are up against.... ask yourselves, if this was all made up why did they bail out Melvin, stay strong, it's going to be volatile but in the end game is they still need to cover, it's that simple.""When Melvin Capital, one of the funds at the center of the GameStop debacle, lost some 50% of its holdings in the trade, Griffin's Citadel and billionaire Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management stepped in to bail out the fund with a $2.75 billion cash infusion.But a separate business, also founded and majority-owned by Ken Griffin, has also drawn plenty of attention from those inclined to see a rigged system in the recent stock market saga. It's Citadel Securities, which is what's known as a market-maker.Market makers basically act as used car dealers for the stock market, according to James Angel, associate professor of finance at Georgetown University. They buy stocks from willing sellers and hold them briefly until they can connect with a willing buyer— making them middlemen on a massive scale.""They sell the service of convenience to investors,"" Angel says. ""Because when your buy order comes in to the market, it's usually not going to come in at exactly the same moment as somebody else's sell order. So you either have to wait around, spending your time and risking that the market's going to move, or you can trade immediately with a market maker.""Citadel Securities buys large amounts of mom-and-pop orders from brokerages like Robinhood and others, earning a penny or perhaps two on each transaction."""

"DawnyesterdayReplied to a reaction$AMC conversationIf GME and AMC were to squeeze, think about the tax revenue the government will gain. Hedge funds continuously find ways to reduce their taxable income and shelter their money in accounts overseas. You cannot rely on the top 1% to sustain the market and pretend that there has not been an economic collapse with those families that do not fit in that category. It all looks ‘pretty’ on paper and in the news. Once the dust settles from the stimulus payments and we return to what could be defined as normal, poverty is going to increase and if you do not believe any of this, I have no problem taking your information and we could discuss within the next year.The wealth gap continues to widen and this will only continue.We continue to hear that a squeeze could collapse the market. This means that the wealthy will suffer the most. Most of the lower socioeconomic class are not investing in stocks. However, the government will experience a significant windfall in tax revenue. This redistribution of wealth will ultimately lead to more investments in the market, to support those stocks that have been crushed as a result of hedge funds short attacks. The squeeze will enable those investors who lacked access to medically necessary health care to now have the financial means to seek medical care for themselves and their families, new businesses would be opened as those with the desire but lacking in cash, would now have the ability to pursue their business interests, and families, that have been struggling for a long time in the 'land that claims to have opportunity for all' may now have the money to invest in homes, cars and education.THEY CAN CALL IT ANYTHING THEY WANT, BUT A COLLAPSE IS NOT WHAT I SEE."

"if you think this share price matches true supply and demand then you don't belong investing..take away the dark pool and their ability to hide buy orders and dump sell orders on the Lit exchange whenever they please, this thing is easily 5k per share. Follow big money bears"
There were ONLY 1.4 million shares covered last week. The other 27.6 million shares returned were borrowed but NOT sold short. Don't believe the bashers out there twisting the narrative that all 29 million shares were covered. That is FALSE information.
"SEC Reportedly looking into Robinhood's President's sale of AMC stock just prior to shutting off retail's buy button for meme stocks Feb 28, according to zerohedge.Guess they also see clear insider trading issues. Are they first to be thrown under the bus?Bullish #AMC"

"Today is a big day, and this week is a big week. While $AMC share price has been suppressed in last few days, we just had the announcement today about $AMC share counts. The news release shows an image which all of us have recently been talking about, and it is basically consistent with what we thought.I am sharing a simple summary that may help to draw a clear and simple picture based on public data.- 501,780,240 shares outstanding as of June 2, 2021- approximately 4.1 million1 individual shareholders eligible to vote at the upcoming Shareholder Meeting- More than 80% of AMC shares are held by a broad base of retail investors with an average holding of around 120 shares. Shares held by retail investors ~ 80% x 501,780,240 ~ 401,424,192- As of June 9th, 2021 from a top brokerage firm: Institutional Stock Ownership 12.6% Institutional Mutual Fund Ownership 10.4% Mutual Fund Ownership 3.2% Insider Ownership 6.5% Other 67.4% Total of institution ownership: 12.6% + 10.4% + 3.2% = 26.2% Total of the rest excluding individual retail investors: 26.2% + 6.5% = 32.7% Equivalent number of shares covered by record excluding shares from individual owners: 32.7% x 501,780,240 = -164,082,138 shares Shares needed to cover the records: -63.72M = 501.78M - 401.42M - 164.08M- Synthetic shares: total number of synthetic shares: Z naked shorts: X naked call contracts: Y other naked shares: W Z = X + Y + W Short interest: Assuming 21% SI which is about 100.4M shares Minimum number of synthetic shares from public records: 100.4M - 63.72M ~ 37M (assume all 63.72M shares were still amid transactions, this is very unlikely) Hidden number of synthetic shares: U: a lot discussions in forums estimate that this number is huge. Minimum number of synthetic shares 37M + U- Bottom line: 37M or MUCH MUCH MORE synthetic shares will have to be covered by real shares, most of these shares need to be from individual investors. Hope this post can be helpful to some of you to understand the current picture of $AMC. The ride is still going forwards while it may not be as easy as some of you thought. GLTL."
"APE SUPPORTINGCopied in:Good morning all, A very nice day yesterday indeed. well done. There seems to be a lot of anxiety today about the squeeze. Relax, there is one item on today''s agenda and only 1. That is to keep the share price as high as possible at the close. $55 would be a very good thing, $60 would be an amazing number. I know that looking at $61 this morning it is easy to say we are on our way higher. Expect an epic price battle today. I don't think the shorts and hedges are ready to wave the white flag just yet.I want to address the $60 price tag really quick. At a close above $60 there will be a requirement to cover around 50 million shares. Why is this important? Well if retail all hold, and we are all still holding and not selling even 1 share, and the institutions and insiders hold, there are not enough available shares to be purchased. That would lead several of those options needing to be covered with Ape shares and then the gamma squeeze kicks in and the price begins to head toward where we all would like for it be.HOLD EVERY SHARE. Buy what you can, be careful with your spending, nothing is 100% certain no matter how good it looks right now. Ignore the noise, it may very well get loud in here today.Feel free to copy and paste this as many times as you want. I have a feeling this post will be deleted much like several of my posts from yesterday afternoon.This is the way. I hold for you, you hold for me and together we go forward toward history.Enjoy the day."

This is a revolution. The best market hedge for the next crash coming
"It is sad for me to think this way about where this world and its people are going.....but.....myself knowing and belief that every business had started up with just an idea, a belief if you will. Even if the company or business is multi-million/billion dollar or not. And it took hard work for people to start up a business from scratch, and with hopes and dreams to make a profit from it, all along with the thoughts of helping out the economy, raising peoples spirits in some sort of way, or even being happy with what they are doing in life without making an impact on their life or wallet. At some point, everybody started out at ZERO $....and some made it big, some barely making it, and some still struggling. The point is you work hard in what you believe in, then somebody or company tries to tear it down for a quick buck! That is not the way it should be, that is not the way we should believe, that is not what we the people of the world should exercise! I would not want that on my conscience! Shorts and Hedges should stop, put themselves in other peoples situation, and think about what they are doing by ruining companies trying, and still trying to make it. They are not only ruining the companies they built, but ruining the peoples lives that actually made it a reality. I have put in what I could in support for #AMC...just because without movie theaters that we grew up with, and enjoyed, we would not have the warmth of sitting by a loved one watching a movie, a first date as a kid, even a first kiss, a place where everybody could be together and laugh, cry, be scared, without being ashamed or ridiculed...because we all were doing it at some point! We even would not have the moving forward technology we have today to watch movies at home if it wasn't for the film industry all together! It makes NO sense to me to ruin a company or lives for what took so long to build...even if mistakes were made and caused problems within their company. It happens...we are only human and we can only learn from it. If it was something I could believe in...this is a stock worth saving! Im in!"
"AMC investors: Each time someone mentions Gary Gensler or someone else stepping in to hold the Hedge funds accountable, I have to take a deep breath. Do we honestly believe that these politicians or executives of the regulatory bodies are going to 'rock the boat' of those who are filling their pockets. Lets take a look at salaries. All of these politicians cannot be savvy investors, always profiting and always building significant wealth despite having the financial means to invest. hmmm, can someone explainNancy Pelosi's salary is $ 193,400 annually, but she amassed over $ 400 millionJerome Powell's salary is $ 203,500 annually, but he is amassed over $ 40 millionGary Gensler was a professor at a university and his current salary is $ 300k but he amassed $ 119 millionSenator Warren's salary $ 175,000 annually but she amassed over $ 12 millionAre we to believe that our top politicians are all savvy investors and where did they get the money to invest that would yield millions upon millions of dollars."

Shorts fuel the flames maximizing potential upside gains
"Yes Interest rate to borrow is now 20% roughly. The actual squeeze is coming. If the recovery in price today said anything to the hedgies it should have been GAME OVER. They are once again losing BILLIONS today 3.32 million borrowed today per Ortex, only 175K was last report I got on shares returned and now we are going to close green today. OUCH. 20% on $60 shares is big bucks for borrowing and on top of that the borrow fee is large also.We will see day traders sell off today but make no mistake, this is going up regardless of today's close.Shorts will get some shares back when day traders sell, but nothing of note."
"Good Morning All! I see there is no shortage of ""OMG this is taking so long"" FUD here this morning. I will hold a position in this company forever, beyond a squeeze, cause I support the company and also the freedom of being able to watch great movies on the big screen as originally designed. In-theater movies are our family thing on birthdays - each choses the one they want and everyone goes along. I will do my part to support that tradition whatever it takes. If this never got to be anything but a $25 stock spinning off an eventual dividend, I can live with that. Obviously much bigger things are in store, but wanted to share my thoughts. Patience is key and wish all of you lots of it (along with much wealth and good health, of course!) Have a good day and feel free to join me in the pond!"
"I made a long post a couple of days ago, and I will reiterate a few points here, particularly for our new apes. Nowadays, until the squeeze happens, AMC stock has nothing whatsoever to do with the overall market or company fundamentals. Anyone who brings this up is distracting you in the hope that you would panic and sell. I am holding my shares. I admit that it is much easier for me to hold, since I've been in this since 13 dollars, and whether I see 50 dollars gain per share or 45 or 55 is all great. But if you got in at 40s, 50s, even 60s, fear not my fellow apes, much brighter days are ahead. Remember, if AMC fundamentals did play a role for now, the stock would've dropped already, since it's been three weeks that we've been in the 50s. If HFs and some of the mainstream media that echo negativity and FUD could drop the stock, they would've succeeded by now, but they haven't. Ask yourself why in the world then is AMC trading at near 60s. What could possibly be the reason? Why hasn't it dropped to 30s or 20s already. Again, the answer is rather simple. Vast majority of apes are holding and winning. There are a few HFs that are long AMC, and they are winning and not selling. The volumes that you see are high frequency traders and probably short HFs that volley shares back and forth, but at the end of the day, AMC continues to slowly but surely rise because we have new apes that are buying and holding. Week by week we are rising. What then, if not AMC fundamentals or overall market, matters when it comes to AMC stock. I think the answer is apes buying and holding, causing some FOMO, and more importantly some gamma squeezes, that is causing AMC to continue its meteoric rise (just zoom out and look at weekly chart). Where do we go from here. My opinion is that we'd break a few technical barriers, and go above the sore points for HFs, which apparently seem to be in the 62 to 65 dollar range, considering how many times we've come close. Once we clear the 65ish range, and close above that, the next would be mid 70s. It takes a couple to a few of barriers that we need to cross before you see sudden jumps that'll cause circuit breaks, and before you know it, short squeeze(s) will happen. Keep in mind that not all HFs will necessarily cover at the same time, so don't assume that once you see a short squeeze that, say, takes the stock from 70s to 100 (for example), that this would be the end of short squeeze and game over after this. No, there could be multiple such rises and a series of short squeezes over several days. In fact, it is entire possible that we may see a very persistent but drawn out squeeze that will take us into hundred over a longer period of time. Just keep your mind open, don't assume things, and play day by day, by being patient and committed. At the end of the day, do what is best for you, and do your independent research. Above is just my opinion and I am holding my shares until I become convinced that HFs have covered. One last point, I would not assume that after HFs cover, that the stock would necessarily drop to what it was a couple of months ago. Again, GME did go through one squeeze, and yes the stock did drop, but it was nowhere near as low as it once used to be, and in fact over a few subsequent months, GME grew back to above 300. I bet many people thought GME would never ever ever reach even above 100 (after it dropped from the peak of 483ish after the first squeeze), but clearly they were wrong. Same thing with AMC. I am convinced that this will have an incredible rise with huge gains for many apes, followed by a drop, but I don't think it'll drop to teens. I think it will be much higher and may continue to rise again. GLTA (except shorts. haha)."

"Okay listen very carefully, like this so everyone sees it. Over the weekend, shorts, bashers and bots will be out in force with trying convincing arguments as to why you should sell. Some of these guys will come in the form of pretend shareholders acting like they care about you saying that they too themselves are going to sell on Monday. Do not listen to them or pay them any mind. This is the time that will now separate the boys from the men. RH is in trouble, they are losing millions of users over the weekend and guess what those users will be doing next week? Switching to more reputable brokers and buying. This is a global trend now, there's no hiding the fact that the manipulation and corruption is happening on a much larger scale.

"$NIO $AMC $GME $NAKD $NOKMonths back, when Citron spread false info about NIO causing SP to plummet, I remember everyone scratching their heads asking themselves ""How is this even legal?"", and thought nothing could be done. I guess we were wrong.Classic case of wealth inequality where ""In 2011, financial inequality was greater than inequality in total wealth, with the top 1% of the population owning 43%, the next 19% of Americans owning 50%, and the bottom 80% owning 7%""Think about it. Now the tables have turned. Before it was always the small population who controlled most ASSETS that controlled the system, but now the it's the larger percentage number of the POPULATION who is fighting back and can implement change through strength in numbers.Being a Gen-Xer, I've learned to never underestimate the millennials and younger generations who know the internet way better and can outsmart the system.

"On January 27th AMC shares jumped 300% from $4.97 to $19.90 in one day. What was the reason behind this movement? AMC raising $900 million in the week before or the CEO announcing bankruptcy is off the table? the answer is none of it, it was the classic HF's bull trap, the hf was losing so much money in GameStop they needed to make money somewhere else, they intentionally put money into AMC to raise the price so retail investors would jump in at $14-$19 thinking the price would continue to go up. We all know what happened next, AMC tanked 65% the following day and people who brought AMC in at $14-$19 were trapped, hint the ""bull trap"".I don't know what will happen on Monday, none of us do, hopefully, AMC price will rise to $10-$11, but do NOT FALL for the Bull Trap if the price rises to $15 or $20 if you sell your shares kiss goodbye to the short squeeze. Why do you think the HF vs retail investors were battling it out over 1 cent on Friday? Literally, it was down to the last minute. Those 120k+ call options were the catalyst that we needed to pressure the hf to buyback 10 of million of shares to cover their short interest.""(Reuters) - The U.S. government on Saturday authorized Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, enabling millions more Americans to be vaccinated in the coming weeks and setting the vaccine up for additional approvals around the world.""The approval of Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine couldn't happen at a better time for AMC shareholders. The last time vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech were authorized back on November 7th AMC shoots up to 90% and closed over 50% for the day. All the weeds, airlines, hotels, and housing-related stocks were also up 20%-30% as well.A new vaccine approved and millions of shares buyback, it will be very interesting how this played out on Monday.

It's simply an investment I made as a means to have some hope and a little fun along the way. I believe I am not the only one doing this with this particilar stock. I also believe that's why it has a pretty strong base that really cant be shaken to easily. Lets see what happens."
"Tomorrow will be a day full of volatility, but the odds are on our side. I expect a gap up pre market, followed by a dip when opens and strong rally towards the end of the day. The fight is far from over, I suggest everyone to hold their shares throughout the weekend.

"*PLEASE GET THE WORD OUT*When you see the price climb peak and then fall, that is your moment, everything we've all talked about. No one truly has diamond hands until they hold through that tempting moment to sell when they see the price peak and fall back down. During that time you need to remember, this happened to our brothers at GME during the squeeze there and the price climbed to $400 a share only because they held during that time. ---To sum it up, the price will ebb and flow, just don't get caught up in the dips and panic sell thinking you missed the peak, just hold through and we will be considered the new NASA. Its looking like this squeeze will last two weeks. I know there are a lot of new investors out there so it is super important to get the word out. diamond hands, but for real when it goes down DIAMOND HANDS"
Cover shorts before black swan event
"I can’t figure out AMC movement. Such low volume…appears to be hedge algorithm manipulation….selling back and forth to each other…when does it end and the MOASS come, to cover the millions of synthetic shorted shares that have NOT covered??? Go AMC!"
"For all that do not know what Stock Utilization is read onThe utilization rate is the number of shares borrowed divided by the number of shares that institutional investors are willing to lend. A higher rate indicates that more of the supply of shares in the securities lending market is being borrowed. A higher utilization rate also increases the likelihood that short sellers could face a buy-in if investors recall their loaned shares.Remember per ORTEX AMC is at 98.2% - This has not gone down, why? Because Share to Borrower Interest Rates have increased dramatically over the last 7 days from under 1% to 9.85%So based on the utilization rate of AMC, do you really think shorts and hedges have covered? On top of that, these shares now come with a 9.85% yearly interest rate compounded daily and paid monthly just like a credit card would be. Now maybe you can relax a bit and realize just how much trouble shorts and HFs are really in."
"#AMC short interest estimate: 8.48 B shares sold short to date (45% short percentage, 157M shares volume per day for 6 months Feb-June - 20 trading days per month) divided by 513.33M shares outstanding = 16.51 (1651.6%). Even if half covered (they didn't) it's 825.8%!"
" What a strong finish from $AMC - despite the desperate efforts we have seen to try and push the price down, we know now that it is just a matter of time until the price goes sky high. Looking good !!"
"Today is a big day, and this week is a big week. While $AMC share price has been suppressed in last few days, we just had the announcement today about $AMC share counts. The news release shows an image which all of us have recently been talking about, and it is basically consistent with what we thought.I am sharing a simple summary that may help to draw a clear and simple picture based on public data.- 501,780,240 shares outstanding as of June 2, 2021- approximately 4.1 million individual shareholders eligible to vote at the upcoming Shareholder Meeting- More than 80% of AMC shares are held by a broad base of retail investors with an average holding of around 120 shares.Shares held by retail investors ~ 80% x 501,780,240 ~ 401,424,192- As of June 9th, 2021 from a top brokerage firm:Institutional Stock Ownership 12.6%Institutional Mutual Fund Ownership 10.4%Mutual Fund Ownership 3.2%Insider Ownership 6.5%Other 67.4%Total of institution ownership:12.6% + 10.4% + 3.2% = 26.2%Total of the rest excluding individual retail investors:26.2% + 6.5% = 32.7%Equivalent number of shares covered by record excluding shares from individual owners:32.7% x 501,780,240 = -164,082,138 sharesShares needed to cover the records:-63.72M = 501.78M - 401.42M - 164.08M- Synthetic shares:total number of synthetic shares: Znaked shorts: Xnaked call contracts: Yother naked shares: WZ = X + Y + WShort interest:Assuming 21% SI which is about 100.4M sharesMinimum number of synthetic shares from public records:100.4M - 63.72M ~ 37M (assume all 63.72M shares were still amid transactions, this is very unlikely)Hidden number of synthetic shares:U: a lot discussions in forums estimate that this number is huge.Minimum number of synthetic shares37M + U- Bottom line:37M or MUCH MUCH MORE synthetic shares will have to be covered by real shares, most of these shares need to be from individual investors.Hope this post can be helpful to some of you to understand the current picture of $AMC. The ride is still going forwards while it may not be as easy as some of you thought. GLTL."
"AMC investors: i have posted the message below at least 9 times, and communist yahoo continues to delete it, so if you read it, please copy and repost so that it can be sharedhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keX6XhKBVqs&t=35sI have been posting this all over the place for the past 4-5 days but it has been deleted here at least 7 times. In October 2009, the SEC pacified the investors by telling them they were lookin into abuse taking place in the dark pools; however, we are now at October 2021, a total of 12 years later. Once would have to wonder how quickly they work or just acknowledge the corruption. One thing to consider is the annual salary of these individuals working for the SEC/DTCC/FED or in politics. Many of these individuals earn annually !74K - $ 300K a year but their net worth is in the millions. Gary Genslers net worth is over $ 100 million. How is that possible on his salary and just look at the net worth of other top-ranking senators/politicians.One final note: You can see that the Biden administration has transformed this country into something unrecognizable in less than 10 months and one that would make the founding fathers 'roll over in their graves' but yet, Gary Gensler is unable to suspend illegal activity in the dark pools!!!!!"
AMC is struggling today but it was expected. Keep buying and holding. Amazon possibly buying the company is even more reason to do so.
Indicators are sending a strong signal that we well close over $55 today. Don't be a mope. Buy and hold. We own the float.
Same action as yesterday I guess 3-5% gain to finished. Awaiting the day we get a 100-200% gain day
Think of the little guys holding only a couple shares. Im holding to the moon for them!!

It is coming....we all feel it!!!! Once in a lifetime!! It’s exciting to be a part of the greatest market upset in the history of the stock market!!!!!!!
"WHY AMC IS GOING HIGHER - IMPORTANT FOR LONGS- This is one of the most informative posts for ALL AMC longs to understand. I am tired of creating this, and then poof, it is gone. For those who have followed me along our journey, if you agree with this post, repost it in your own words. This is detrimental to the big money (HF's), I am sure I am not well received by them (they do not like me). Here goes: On June 2nd AMC soared. Why did it happen? Most likely because all the small, individual investors that were short could not maintain their short position. The big money beasts can. So, Mr. Margin came a calling for more capital. Many brokerages will not even call, they just ""sell you out"". For shorts, that is they buy to cover. Hence the price rose on huge volume (into the seventies). Go look, you can all see this. So, here is were it gets interesting. This minor short squeeze gave the big HF's more ammo to manipulate with. Now they could borrow all those shares from the small squeeze. The past seven weeks has been all theater, a show put on by manipulation! The next squeeze will be the MOASS. Please, if you agree, re post this in your own words. Over and over and over. This is EXACTLY what big money does NOT want to us to know right now. Thumbs up if you agree! I assume soon I will be banned for life on here, LOL."
"In my opinion we are stretching ourselves too much. To many stocks on the board. We should as a group select the stocks we want to work with to control the supply. It stated with $GME. And has gone too wild. I thought we were focusing on $BB, $AMC Now every day new stocks appear and were spreading ourselves thin."
They literally halted buy orders on publicly traded stocks back in January. 300-million in volume yesterday and stock closed +10%. 240-million in volume today and it closes -2%. MANIPULATION
You know when Motley comes out with an article saying to avoid buying AMC that its time to increase my holding.
"This is who we are AMC ARMEY up against.... ask yourselves, if this was all made up why did they bail out Melvin, stay strong. The game has just started, and it's going to be volatile but in the end, the game is they still need to cover, it's that simple.""When Melvin Capital, one of the funds at the center of the GameStop debacle, lost some 50% of its holdings in the trade, Griffin's Citadel and billionaire Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management stepped in to bail out the fund with a $2.75 billion cash infusion."
I bought it $10 and I need it to be $1000 to get a new house!!!!
"If you're wondering where all of the AMC supporters are, they are now posting for AMC on the HOOD board. It was taken over when Yahoo decided to mess with this board and post week to month old posts. They don't want AMC supporters to communicate any positive thoughts."
"Here’s a perspective to consider when deciding to invest in AMC shares. You’re essentially supporting an experience and an environment that no streaming service can replace. An activity many millions of individuals enjoy annually, from the over priced pop corn to the delicious refillable drinks. Think about this; when you’re watching a Netflix movie with friends / family, is everyone’s full attention directed towards the movie, or is one or more people aimlessly browsing on their phone? You can’t replace a good movie Theater experience with an off the shelf Netflix flick. So I personally see absolutely no harm in holding this stock for many months, a lot can happen in that time and I’m excited to see where this ends up."
"REPOST!! Billy Lowenstein · For all of the new baby apes. I know a lot of you have questions, and I thought it would be helpful to provide you with some overall context to understand the significance of the movement you just joined.Here’s the cliff note version. Covid hit last March and a couple of big hedge funds concocted a plan to drive AMC into bankruptcy by “shorting” it and make a ton of money in the process.You “short” a company when you think the value of the stock is going to go down. When the country locked down and AMC closed their doors and their revenue literally went to $0 overnight, it was a no brainer play for the hedge funds.So they started borrowing millions and millions of shares from brokers and sold them “short” at the market price at the time, and they pocketed the cash from the sale. The idea is that the stock price will drop, you can buy them back later at a lower price, and then return the borrowed shares to the broker and keep the difference. If the company goes bankrupt, the stock goes to $0 and they don’t have to buy anything back at all and keep everything. This is what they were banking on. They’ve done this to company after company over the years, and they saw this as a sure thing as any.Well a bunch of people on Reddit (affectionately known as “Apes”) noticed they were trying to drive AMC, GameStop and many other retail brick and mortar stores into bankruptcy, and banded together to buy up all the available shares, driving up the share price. This resulted in the mini squeeze in January. But Apes didnt sell after that. And the hedge funds didn’t cover their short positions either (I.e. buy back the millions of shares they had borrowed and sold short).The Apes kept buying and buying, and holding and holding, and once the real shares were all bought up, the hedge funds doubled, tripled and quadrupled down on their short position and started making synthetic shares (IOUs) and selling those shares into the market trying to drive the price down. When the price dropped, instead of selling like the hedge funds wanted them to, Apes said “thank you very much for the discount” and kept buying more and holding. Nobody has sold for the past 5 months since the movement really got started in January, and more and more people are jumping in and adding more everyday.Now because of all of the synthetic IOU shares the hedge funds have created to keep shorting AMC, us Apes likely own more way more shares than are actually supposed to exist (as much as 6x-8x by some estimates). But real or synthetic, each share the hedge funds sold short is a liability on their books that must be bought back in order to close out their position.They literally have hundreds of millions of shares, possibly billions, to buy back, and we own them all. They have to buy them back eventually, and every day that the borrowed short shares are still on loan, the hedge funds are paying interest to the brokers they borrowed them from. Meanwhile it costs us nothing to hold.Things started to come to a head a couple weeks ago because the interest rate on the borrowed shares was reported to be as high as 250% (1-2% is normal for your average stock), so the hedge funds are collectively paying hundreds of millions of dollars every day just to hold their position, and a lot of them are starting to miss the payments and margin calls could be coming very soon.That’s when the fun starts. At that point, the broker forces them to buy back all of the hundreds of millions of shares they have borrowed and sold short, because the broker doesn’t want the hedge funds’ recklessness to fall onto them. And remember, the Apes own all the shares and aren’t selling. The hedge funds can only buy a share for what an Ape is willing to sell it for, and us Apes really love our shares.Once the margin calls start, the computers just start buying back all of the shares at the best available price no matter what that price may be. They all have to be bought back. Everything must be settled. And if the cheapest price an ape is willing to sell for is 1,000, or 10,000 or 100,000, well then that’s what the hedge funds will be forced to buy the borrowed shares back for in order to close out their position.Apes are going to hold and hold and hold driving up the price further and further to make the hedge funds bleed as much as possible until they are inevitably forced to buy back their millions of shares. They will need to buy our shares, and we set the price. And remember, it costs us nothing to hold. This movement has been building for the past 5 months, but you just heard about it yesterday. One thing Apes don’t do is set dates for the squeeze. Nobody knows when it will happen, all we know for sure is that the math says it’s inevitable as long as we hold.REPOST!"
"Cristhian Andrews-Under SEC rule 15c3-3, brokers must NOT lend out shares from cash accounts. On a weekly basis however, brokers get into customer’s cash accounts and lend out their shares regardless if the user opted out. Attorney Wes Christian confirms: “there are no boundaries with them”. #AMC"
"$AMC Predicting today's closing volume will be around 132 million..... Just looking at charts & numbers people!!! GOOD, but not the environment conducive for a squeeze...Having said THAT....We are having a marvelous day with great gains..... Knocking down THREE walls of resistance and we are only half way in...KEEP PUSHING!!! The best defense is an offense!!!... ;)"

investing in all this fake expect account manager recommended to you in all Yahoo finance channels is not profitable.Let me tell you why?I've been trying for years without yeilding any results or income....
"Look, I know most, if not all of you, that are AMC apes/junkies could care less about a company's fundamentals, but just a thought, because a CFO that I once worked for and highly respected had a favorite saying: ""Cash is King"" In 2017, 2018 and 2019 (before the pandemic) AMC produced, on average, about $550 million in cash flow from operations and those 3 years were reasonably good years. Lets, just for the heck of it, jack that up by 50% to $750 million in cash flow from operations. With 500+ million shares now outstanding that figure to be about $1.50/share or about 3.3% return. Better that your average savings account, but WAY less cash than hundreds, if not thousands, of good, solid companies are generating."
"$AMC is set up to join the RUSSEL 1000 index this month meaning once it is in, index funds will have to buy it up and hold it for a year, meaning this will make for a bigger squeeze. Scientific polling shows a likelihood of 2.5+ billion shares in circulation, or more than 5X the float. Even synthetic shares have to cover. Looking at the candle chart, there is an inverted hammer, a bullish sign. This is going to be big. Tomorrow Fox Business analyst Charles Payne will interview legal expert Wes Christian on naked short selling. I'm looking forward to this week! So much is happening and I'm excited for AMC."
"We broke through 60 multiple times today. Both the floor price and support levels keep rising. New AMC stockholders:Do not be discouraged by down days , focus back and realize we were trading at $2.04 to start the year. 2,500% gain ever since."
"I would hold this stock for two years if it was only going to $80 but after reviewing all the data that exists that is legal to be short I know it's going to $1,000 it has too.Now viewing the data and the flow, I have hired data scientists who tell me more like 2 billion plus shares are short. My analysts started to run scenarios on AMC stock and they stopped at $40,000 price per share because it became uncalculated in their minds.Were in the Twilight zone welcome to another time and space."
"$AMC...; These prices are all artificial.... Once all the Real shares are counted, watch how high the real price is!!! Just chill!"
"IMHO, a positive turn on the case will easily add $5-6 to the current price. I expect Cineplex to trade $20+ either way!! $AMC"

"The recent push back on the hedge funds by each and every one of us has created a mess for the SEC. Trust me, they know exactly what is going on and they also know that the Market mechanics have got to change now that we retail investors have a better understanding. The short market in it's present form will no longer be the cash cow that it once was for the hedge funds. All their tricks have been exposed and retail has found ways to even the playing field. There is only one thing left for the SEC to do and they have been doing it now by changing the rules to ensure that the hedge funds never target a company so heavy where a stock is 100 percent or more shorted and a hedge fund is never under leveraged. There have been massive losses by the hedges and there will be even more losses shortly. I do believe that we will win this war and the hedges will have to pay us dearly. Like many have said, everyone involved from the top down are just trying to position themselves to better absorb the losses the market is going to take when the positions in GME and AMC are finally closed out. After that, the potential of future short squeezes will be non existent. I'm looking for a big payday while we watch so many people cry about how we are killing the market and about how we retail investors are wrong for what we are doing."

"$AMCThis has the potential to break $500 a share if we all buy and HOLD! The short squeeze will bring us past $100 on Friday and then the weekly options will expire on Jan 29th at the end of the trading day on Friday and this will get close to $200 after hours, if we HOLD until the next weekly options expire on Feb 5th we will MOON much much higher! Then Feb 12th, 19th, and 26th there will be more weekly options that expire and bring us to over $500 a share. The key is to buy on dips and HOLD!!!!"
"My Plans:1.) HOLD2.) BUY more3.) HOLD those as well4.)

I become a lifetime holder. 9 times out of 10, with TIME on our side, the stock comes back to my buy in price point and jets north of it. Look at $NIO....thought about it once or twice selling at $5.xx for a lose. Decided to hold and move on to other things in my life as I watched another stock I have $APHA tank below my buy in. Check them out right now. I’m sitting like a king on a throne, and I will be with $AMC as well. Patience makes for fortunes.....HOLD AND CHILL. We HOLD Together, We WIN Together!!"
I keep buying more at these great prices. I will eat Ramen noodles for a while until this squeezes than ill be eating lobster and filet migon.I will feed the food banks in my city when I become wealthy.

"1. Our focus should be GME and AMC only... so please refrain yourself from talking about other stock short squeezes here. we need everyone's focus and concentration for this to work2. We would need to buy and hold! We need to hold majority of the float. Please don't be distracted by trading volume as the high volume is main driven by day traders selling and buying multiple times. What we need to do is hold what we have and buy more and hold if you have extra funding...3.

I just looked at AMC option chains, data about shorts, share flows, recent price moves, and trading picture last week. I still cannot find any reason to deny this feeling in my mind. I am a long, so this just gives me a feeling that I never had before. Let's all keep focusing on the price moves in following days/weeks, and see what will be happening."
"Over 385K reactions on $AMC conversation on Yahoo! Finance. We have an incredible amount of support from fellow retailers who want nothing more than to be able to participate in the market when abnormalities like the SI, manipulation and bashing of AMC have been taking place for months now. Well now is the time retailers, let's add more pressure to this pressure cooker: let's buy more and hold what we have. We all know that the company is doing better from a fundamental point of view, the shorts are in deep, deep trouble and are beyond desperate to change the current positive sentiment to a sour one rooted in fear of loss of a squeeze. Well we are not going to give them the attention they so desperately cry for - they would screw all of us over in a heartbeat to make $1 if they had the chance (they probably have already).We have the upper hand here, let's keep it and let's keep our stock and add to our holdings."

Call options are going to get exercised in the money getting more shares bought and virtually nothing to short.3. Earnings are for Q4 with no business which is already known to the world.4. Reason for pushing the results is to declare positive news like a buyout or completion of fund raising and grown in COVID free summer to come.We can very well be in 20s this Friday, in 100s after Monday and in 1000s after positive earnings..

"A comment to all from someone also in the struggle and very familiar with rough times both in the market and in life. This recent pull back caused so many to be discouraged and this is the main theme of the stock market with any stock and no matter how much we are winning or are up or even in the red remember that the day changes with each day and we must take it one day at a time. I know some of the popular AMC social media apes mean well but remember they are people too and can make mistakes and simply do not accurately know what the stock will do. They can get an idea at times and predict certain patters but anything can happen. Remember how fast this stock moves up and how much it trades with popularity and that has not changed nor has the squeeze play. The squeeze has not happened yet and the shorts have not covered. This is not the time to give in to the market tricks and FUD. We are battling ourselves more than any HF and we must stay strong and remember we have the advantage and its a matter of when they cover not if they cover, the borrowed shares must be returned and those millions of shares will cause a massive amount of buying pressure starting an event level short squeeze. I am not a financial advisor but have made some profit in this market for a while. Its not too late to get in these are buying levels. Invest what you can afford... stay away from options, and be patient as we await the moass. While AMC's fundamentals are improving the main factor is that this is a buy and hold short squeeze play above anything being discussed."

interesting how the market moves  and technology trying to make things easier..thanks to new developments....
Im thinking that they are routing trades to the dark pool because there are no shares left to buy at this point. They are doing the same thing to GME.
Just a day trader selling its only 2% so just buy and hold we will see the squeeze after hour’s
Very little membership growth in AMCStock reddit and WSB. Social media posting volumes are down and perhaps more importantly the implied vol on AMC options is too high for a gamma squeeze to be executed. Apes have also lost tons of capital speculating on just out of the money short term AMC options. Can't wait to see the overextended Apes that bought on margin respond to this post. EM? What do you say?
Yo bashers! Retail Investors own the float so we own the price when the G.M.O.A.S.S. happens. So that means we own you. Get it bashers.
"$NAKD $AMC $NOK- The bulk of the institutional shorts will all have come due by Wednesday. So long as we HOLD THE LINE, the price will continue to increase as the hedges have to buy back at a premium. The sell point will be between Wed-Fri."
"WHY AMC IS DOWN AFTERHOURS: Hedge fund managers, Short sellers, and Market Makers are using their extended hour trading to scare retail traders (You) off. Most retail traders (You) lack the ability to trade before and after the market opens/closes. This is why it is currently down. Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock. It will happen every single evening for the next several days so be prepared for this. If it is to stressful for you, please put away your phone/computer and check again in the morning. COPY AND PASTE THIS SO EVERYONE KNOWS THE TRUTH $GME $AMC $BBBY $BB $SPCE, LIKE THIS SO EVERYONE SEES"
"You can tell from EM and other pump and dump Ape reactions that they are way overextended into AMC. My guess is they bought on margin. The entire revenue for movie theaters (including ads and concessions) was 19B at its highest. The average valuation for movie theaters is ~1x EV/sales. That means that Apes have valued AMC as being more valuable than the entire movie theater industry in the US despite having below average industry margins and returns. There also won't be a short squeeze because the cost to borrow is too low, FTDs are not high (implying no naked short selling), and there are millions of shares available to borrow."
"This didnt sqeeze when we all got it to $70 a share. You really still have hope? News flash, shorts DONT have to cover ;)"
"Just checking with some old friends, seems they go to AMC a lot now with the new movies out"
"$AMC $HOODThe HFs are cashing in BIG TIME today... I'm thinking the AMC squeeze is close... MY date prediction: September 26th will be the start...Meanwhile.... RH is the Titanic.... AGAIN I SAY: When RH drops to $36 ($2 below their initial IPO offering), the AMC squeeze is starting.... I'm just sayin'.... HOLD FOR THE GOLD!!! Viva la AMC..."
"Does anyone think that the housing market is going to collapse?Reason I ask is, once AMC hits $100+ , I’m taking all my money and buying several homes for needy families."
Let's push $AMC over $47 by close.
"28% short interest on AMC, according to CNBC:https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/24/gamestop-surges-30percent-to-lead-meme-stock-rally-in-otherwise-boring-market.html"
"Had to create new account. YF booted me to the curb. Hard. Make no mistake. I’ve been here since February. Got in initially at $10. Haven’t sold a single share. And bought the whole time. At $60 at $50 at $40 at $30. My DCA is now at $32.75. . I’m here for the long haul. Not going until every short that was taken out at $10 and less, COVERS. WE HAVE THE MARKET BY THE COCONUTS"
"Well that was quite a finish yesterday, Sorry I wasn't part of it but my real job required me to be elsewhere and it will again this afternoon unfortunately. I am not going anywhere on Friday I wouldn't miss the close this Friday for any reason. No matter what the price is at open I am slapping the ask to get the ball rolling today. Time to turn up the heat again. The pressure on the short positions in AMC is getting enormous. Borrowed shares are all but gone. They may scrape up a couple hundred thousand shares but not much more. The lending rate is over 26% and yet there were short sales yesterday to the tune of 5.7 million shares that will be added to the we need to cover pile. It is critical that not 1 share of AMC gets sold by Apes today. We need to keep buying the ask because as others have mentioned a close above $10 on Friday would be more fuel for the rocket. Great day yesterday, lets keep it rolling today. Its a great feeling to know that every share we buy will cost a hedge fund over $1000. This is the way. I love this stock."
someone just bought 10 million shares
"ngl I got outta this at the right time lol all my other stonks are green, LFG! $CMC $AMC $BTCM $PROG many more lfh daddy, order flow is too bearish on GME on webull"
If you like money buy and hold like the over 400 institutions long on AMC for the short squeeze. Algorithms are about to push us to $150-200 without the short squeeze with margin calls
"Good job, team. We brought it in right on the max-pain number.No one needs shares to cover their short options."
"Wouldn't that be something if AMC were to have another double tomorrow like on June 2, 2021.Let's DO it, AMC!HIGH.............LOW.................VOLUME72.62............35.59...............766.5M"
"Did y'all see the news that come out on Friday? Wall Street’s top brokers are tightening their rules for who can bet against AMC. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Jefferies Financial Group Inc. are among firms that have adjusted their risk controls. HFs now face higher collateral requirements and increased margin requirements or are now being prevented from shorting AMC any more."
Cramer just said today that we own 80% and institutions own 20% of AMC so don't let the shills on here tell you otherwise it's simply not true.
"AMC gaining momentum, featured in this...https://lussosnews.com/5-stocks-under-50-that-gained-momentum/"
Warning  Please Read This. Roku has a market cap over $50 Billion. Netflix has a Market cap over $250 billion. Disney has a market cap over $360 billion. The biggest movie theater chain in the world has only a market cap of $6 billion dollars. Yeah sorry you can’t convince me other wise that $AMC isn’t insanely undervalued.  even at $100 $AMC at a market cap of $45 billion will still be undervalued. They have 1 billion dollar cash on hand that can mean so many things they can do for growth and opening up more innovating theaters. They also have a huge chance to dominate their competition like Netflix or Disney.
Dark pool trickery shares real value is over $486+!!
We’re not leaving without financial freedom. Time is on our side. With evidence. Due diligence and extensive research pays off massively
$CEI Hurry up and hit 10 so i can buy more $AMC
"Our protest is to hold till $10,000! You want the f’n money or not people??????No protest! I unlike most hedge funds and elite have to work; that will change soon!"
"Just saw Shang-Chi movie at my local AMC theatre. Movie is excellent, very entertaining, and free popcorn always tastes extra good. To the Moon!!"
Why isn’t yahoo posting all the recent comments

"You had the Big Short in 2008 and now is the Big Squeeze that's just getting started...there's no stopping us! Momentum will continue after hitting new high's in June (DOW will continue to soar since VIX is fading and hitting all time lows), then FOMO through the fast approaching and much anticipated Fourth of July to celebrate independence from the pandemic (bye, bye FUD), and $AMC will hit it out of the park when reporting Q2 earnings in August. Also, don't forget a huge run up before the Holiday Season and 2022 New Year so continue buying and HODL for $100,000...let's go diamond hands!!!"
"I didn't know shorting was so profitable, but I shorted AMC a few weeks ago, and the profits are amazing.Thanks AMC longs for your help!"
"well yahoo won't let me see the latest comments, 2 weeks old is the newest, but I'm thinking the bashers must be out in full force today...not selling a single share of my AMC...love the movies"
"Please like and push to top...$AMC UPDATE: Februari 04th, 2021What is happening?Shorts are ladder attacking the share price back and forth. They've been doing this for a while as we all know. This is illegal for them to do, but the SEC has not done anything about it and likely won't. Is the system rigged? Yes, it is.What can we do:The share price you see is not technically what the share price should be. The ladder attacks are hedge funds trading shares back and forth between each other which drives the price down. Their goal is to drive the price down using their tactics and ability to do so. The majority of us are buying, not selling. This is good for us because those who bought high can now average down. Do not kid yourself, the Hedge Fund's will continue this for as long as they can to steer you away from buying more, and to convince you to sell. Once you do - they cover. They are not covering with the shares they are trading back and forth. Eventually, these HF's will have to cover and buy back your shares. Yes, this may take longer than you want or expect, but eventually, they WILL give in. When they start buying, they need to increase their bid if people refuse to sell. Eventually, they have to bid up to the lowest price someone will ""ask"" for. This is the significance of HOLDING. Buy, and hold. These cheap prices right now are gold for the retailer.The hedge funds are playing serious psychological games that they play to wear down the interests and hype of the stock. Again, do not kid yourself. These guys have billions and will pay good money to learn ways on how to manipulate you and your actions.When will the squeeze happen?Nobody knows. You cannot ""time the market"". This could happen shortly, or it could happen in a week or two, maybe a month. It all comes down to how long the hedge funds are willing to wait and continue paying interest on their positions. Remember, they need your shares. They can only buy them from you if you are willing to sell them. If everyone just buys and holds, they are stuck. This is the squeeze to force them into buying from you. RIGHT NOW - notice how the share price is flashing back and forth between $7.09 and $6.96 ?? Is that not suspicious ? back and forth? This just proves what they are doing to manipulate.Fundamentals:AMC is debt free and about to start opening up. That means they are going to start posting revenues in the near future. Why is this important? Because when you have a clean balance sheet of little to no debt and report making good revenue, this looks very very good for the financial world. If a company looks good financially, their stock price will almost always increase. AMC has growth ahead of them which makes this stock worth a lot more than what the ticker shows right now. If you do not need the money - for sure, let this ride for the long run - you WILL make money.Charts & More:Volkwagen did the same thing as what AMC is doing now. It almost went back to the previous low before it shot up. Do you think Hedge Fund's weren't in the same boat then as they are now? They will try to tank this as much as they can, until they cannot hold on anymore. Eventually, they will pay.A $2m dollar $20/call bet was placed the other day. This is an extremely good sign, provided this investor knows something. I don't know about you, but if I were going to wager a $2m bet that this stock was going to be $20 or above by end of February, I'd have done my homework. Based on this alone, I believe this says there is a greater chance that it will, than wont, be $20 or above come end of Feb.So, my fellow retail investing friends, the game here is patience. HF can play all the dirty tricks they want but eventually they will break. They cannot afford to be patient, we can. REMEMBER THIS."
"I WILL START SELLING ABOVE $40,000 PER SHARE !! HOLD & BUY !!!!"
"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"
"I realize this gets repetitive....shorts have not covered at all. There might be some hedgie sell off that is bringing the price down a little. This means nothing, in fact it is a good thing, we just buy at the discounted price and at the end of the day, we just own more of the float. We got them up against the ropes. Just a matter of time. Amc is the #hood"
"Something I just noticed. As you look at the one day chart on AMC make sure you look closely at what occurred at 3:51pm. 1.38 million shares shorted, ""sold"" and thathuge sell down began to initiate what is known by the hedging community as ""splashing the close"". Nothing more than few 100k shares sold at market every minute after that first big hit to gobble up all the bid prices and quickly tank the price intothe closing. Why? Only so they can create the illusion the price is not really aboutto close on a real run which it was up until 3:50 right. They only have to drop a few more millionbucks to make that happen and after a day like the last two in a row and so much already lost, what's another few million to make things look not so bad at the close?Just like yesterday's close I might add when they were able to splash it by about .40 cents.Oh and they benefit twice actually from that big short position they took with the first buyand all of the thereafter because they plan to buy out of those when they take out the weakhands at 10:30 or 11:00 or when-ever they strike. Understand? Just my years of experience and you can trust what I'm saying or not."
Amc going back to 50. It’s consolidating and preparing for lift off. May all the longs be prosperous and wealthy
Look at the number of Call Options for Friday. Wow. Already over 300k iin the money. Huge day tomorrow and the day after and the day after. Love it.
"AMC is a strong company and price would continue going up if HFs did not manipulate so much. As the SEC looks at the rules closely and actually enforces them, this will help the price go up and allow regular Market activity to occur. Citadel has not been telling the truth lately in public appearance with Congress. They stopped the buying and with dark pools do not allow the market to react normally with price going up with the demand. keep holding and keep buying as this is a strong stock."
"I must say, I'm convinced there are some hedge funds barely afloat right now because of AMC. There's no denying it."
"$GME $AMC $NAKD $NOK $BBThis day in history:1865 - House passes 13th Amendment to abolish slavery1952 - Truman announces development of H-bomb1971 - Apollo 14 departs for the moon2021 - Largest organization of online-based retail investors take on decades-long, unchecked Wall Street corruption paving the way for long overdue improvements to the American financial system. Historians believe this sole event helped save American democracy from the ever increasing gap in unsustainable wealth inequality."
"I have preached this idea consistently: $35- is a key inflection point for AMC stock. I never expected we would get there so rapidly. Once we get below $35-, selling volume will accelerate, and AMC is one stock which cannot handle selling pressure without a precipitous drop in the bid side. Liquidity 101 is the course you failed in college. Tomorrow's trading session promises to be extremely exciting. There are but hours to escape this travesty."

Cramer says he had cocktails with Aron last night. Cramer is also promoting his new money making gimmick. a 5 year partnership with CNBC selling his advice. Cramer also said the new Bond movie went gangbusters inEurope and he and Aron discussed how great it will do here in the AMC movie houses.
"All you need to do is keep questioning what is the paid shills motivethey are here posting by the hour, every day, every week, every month claiming terrible stock, going bankrupt, you must sell immediately. So if they believe all of this to be true, THEN, WHY ARE THEY STILL HERE.THEY ARE HERE BECAUSE THEY ARE PAID TO MOTIVATE YOU TO SELL AS THEIR BOSSES, THE HEDGE FUNDS CANNOT COVER THEIR POSITIONS UNTIL AMC INVESTORS SELL ALL OF THEIR SHARES AND UNTIL RETAIL INVESTORS SELL, HEDGE FUNDS CONTINUE PAYING INTEREST DAILY AND SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO SHORT THIS STOCK, PAY THE HOURLY WAGES OF THE PAID SHILLS AND BORROWING FEES TO CONTINUE THEIR ILLEGAL TACTICS All the while, Gary Gensler of the DTCC and other regulatory bodies claim they are evaluating the situation. AS IF ANYTHING HAS CHANGED FROM THE FIRST TIME THEY BEGAN EVALUATING WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH THE DARK POOLS MORE THAN 10 YEARS AGO."
"I chose the red pill. I see the manipulation…and when you see it, you can’t UNSEE it. Citadel and hedge funds need a takedown."
Buy and hold to win the stock market game of wealth
Hello my brother's and sister's APES for how long we are in AMC I'm since February and they still trying to scare us to make us sell our share I not know about you but I'm still holding my shares remember they are not covering yet HF and shorts still shorting we just keep buying and holding .Remember APES TOGETHER STRONG to the .
A friend just called me and he works for a brokerage. That brokerage/firm which remains unnamed has had internal talks about supporting $AMC and has no plans to short . That’s good news because it shows there are some good ethical companies out there not looking to bet on American failure and loss of jobs!
"$AMC conversationBoy this definitely warrants a short share recall. Numbers aren't even close to adding up with retail owning all of 500 million shares that doesn't include institutions, , borrowed etf's, and insiders. Now if we take all the shorts my guess is we are way, way, waaaaaaaaay beyond the 102 million reported by ortex today. We could be well over 1.5 billion shares short we just don't know. We must, must must call in the short shares as a shareholder with thousands of shares I believe it is necessary beyond a shadow of a doubt so I know my shares are not being diluted by synthetic shares. Yea or Nay shareholders this is a huge catalyst. We shareholders demand all short shares be recalled due to the numbers that just do not add up. ""Yea or Nay"""
Still yahoo amc forum is not working correctly and not showing new postsI don’t believe this is coincidental We will not leave and we will not sell. Been buying more and holding stronger
I heard about AMC the other day on (http://Pick-stocks.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Hope my funds could make it in time before the lift off next week; gotta buy more shares. I have set aside all emotions because I know my diamond hand bros and sis are with me.Thumbs up so I know you are here.
Seriously all jokes aside you need to buy asap. This is not going to happen again at such affordable prices. ~$300 a share by septembers end.
"CEO will NOT dilute NOW!!!The shares wouldn't be issued until 2022 : ""The movie-theater chain will ask shareholders to authorize another 25 million shares at its annual meeting on July 29. If approved, AMC (ticker: AMC) could issue such shares starting in 2022. The number is significantly smaller than a previous request to authorize 500 million shares that was later withdrawn."" (https://www.barrons.com/articles/amc-stock-sale-51622760628)25 millions shares is less than 5% of current float, so inconsequential regarding any ""dilution"".This is just another hit piece by the hedge fund shorties trying to drive the price down."
Buying 100 more today because #kengriffenlied
"For the current market cap of AMC you construct, brand new, every movie theater in the US. But we're hoping and praying for a short squeeze when the company needs to issue more shares and the cost to borrow is low and the availability of lendable shares is high. Don't be Sheeple. Think for yourself."
