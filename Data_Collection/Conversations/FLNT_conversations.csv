Motley Fool highly recommends Fluent. Already pre-announced results in January and it is good
"Some insider buying and great numbers last quarter. Now that spin off over, I think we will begin to see positive news and better share price. My fingers are crossed."
looks like its going to launch from this point : I have received an alert yesterday by email: FLNT and LIVX will be trading up. they said the stocks reached reversal point and will bounce back
My prediction 4th quarter sales will be around 69 million.
Wondering is anyone else here feeling nervouscited about earnings?
"lost over $2000 following someone else’s conviction, good lesson about not following alerts."
46% of shares held by insiders and 32% held by institutions. You know a stock is in good condition when you see those numbers. Glad to be holding a small percentage of the remaining shares
"Looking better and better down here. I think this will turn up soon, most will wish they bought more. good luck longs."
Nice move refinancing the remaining debt plus a $15M LoC to shore up the financials. Dunno if it'll move the SP tomorrow but that 5% savings will go right to the bottom line.
buy moreeeee
See you at $1
Happy and lucky I could sell my 7k shares finally after 9 months. it was a very difficult one
Why drop? Thanks
Looks like a little breakout happening premarket. Good luck to all.
Increased my position to 30k worth of shares. Hoping to turn this into 100k before the end of the year. Good look all longs. Let's fly this puppy high together!
"hit piece on red violet on seeking alpha dragging down fluent I think, guilt by association. It sounds like fluent management correctly got rid of a problem division and members of the board, which should only be a positive for them going forward. Not sure of why the reaction in stock is down, I don't see any potential liability to them."
"Dr. Frost bought 600,000 shares over the last 2 weeks at a cost of 3 million"
Fluent is up 12.66% to 2.58
$8 by end of week
Time to get this stock moving on the upside. Very tempted to buy more.
This should not be moving down
"Did some DD with @Clovus before yesterday's close and FLNT looks very promising, with the potential to follow in the footsteps of $APPS. No promises, but promising. So far, so good!The ER next week should beat the consensus of $0.06 and the revs could catapult FLNT into the double digits short term, and possibly parabolic over the year. Of course, I could be reading this completely wrong...8>D"
I heard decent earnings and growth of 18%. They have their own platform so Google cookies phase out will not hurt them. Market malaise with tomorrows tape telling the whole tale. Our new addition stock FTCV/Etoro did well today. We took a position right at the open with an average of $12.45 in two portfolios.Holding FLNT long term as I see a lot of similarity to Apps last year.The Analyst
Picked up 1K shares at 3.21 early this morning in a small pure spec play.
"New stock owner here. Had to buy when I was looking at the fundamentals of this company. Could not pass up at these prices. The growth and increases in revenue are insaaaaane. I have this one sitting in a nice little corner for my portfolio. This company is like a small, but super strong, little tugboat. Here's to hoping it is a diamond in the rough."
"Perhaps FLNT's strength is related to other digital ad plays because Pinterest reported very strong digital advertising numbers. PINS is up, but so are MGNI and PERI and FLNT. Perhaps people are rotating out of TTD to invest in the lesser-known digital ad plays."
almost my ideal setup..will be watching closely
We are gonna get a nice pop of action tomorrow!
what happened
It will be $20 by End of this week. Chart is best
Averaged this down to $4.26 but taking a beating. Someone play devils advocate and tell me why this wont hit that price again. All the analysts give it strong recommendations but if someone has a defense for this dropping and never recovering please let's hear it so I can evaluate all angles.
this is on like a permanent track up
Bought more at $2.90 selling other stocks to load up more at this price. Back above $4 in three days
Does someone know whats the reason for todays jump?
At $7.49 or under this stock has close to 5000 contracts ( calls in jeopardy) today where they keep the stock and premium too. Lets see the real price on Monday when I believe it goes back to the mid 8s. I sold covered calls for March 10 at $1 today.
FLNT is not APPS. Here's to APPS investors wishing they had invested in FLNT. It begins tomorrow.
What is up today ? Any ideas?
will the block chain technology solutions help the company to go to double digit?
"Have no clue about this company. But someone bought 39,978 options today vs 1373 average amount of contracts. 98% calls. In at $7.50 level with a $10 target short term soley on the options trade. No clue why"
"The valuation now at this price is beyond undervalued. If you listen to the conference call, the core business and growth plan remains solid. Bought a bunch over past few days. Sitting on close to 40000 shares. If this goes any lower might end up with more than 60000. With the low float, and eventual rebound this will be a big win. Look how fast it ran up this last time last year. At the end of the day, Fluent is THE leader in performance marketing by far. Almost everybody uses them in the industry. This is a no brainer if your on the fence."
I hate this stock. I’m in soooo deep. Looks like I’ll be holding for the next 5 years to break even.
who is buying this?
"held for 2 years, bought at 1.75 directly from a stock screening email. sold at 4.15 yesterday, not sorry."
Does it have the issue of safety?
This stock is getting accumulated here and volume has dried up. They will have to move it higher to the next channel soon to get the shares they want. I think we test $4 sometime in January. GL
the most strange stock I ever invested in... no idea what the management is doing . A marketing company but zero PR.
"Revs and earnings beat forecast. Potential liability penalty to NY AG is already funded so ongoing operations will not be impeded. $11M in debt paid down during FY20; $40M remaining. FYQ1 and Q2 restructuring will enable ongoing growth in Q3, Q4 and onward.A strong, stable company with revs that are outsized to its market cap. And it's profitable and growing. And the bear case is...?"
"yikes up a buck, back down, up I guess this is on a few peoples day trading radar"
"Folks who wonder why Fluent lost value over the last week and then got hammered AH, PM, and likely today really need to read the call transcript. The market will punish severely any company that fails to say, ""We had a blockbuster year and this next year will be even better!"" Instead, Fluent said it had a banner year (though it missed top-line Q4 revs by $4M: $81M vs. $85M expected), increasing both its EBITA EPS ($0.07 vs. $0.05 expected) and operating margins.So why is it getting hammered? Two reasons. First, the whole market is being held ransom to Fed Chair Powell's comments on inflation and T-bill yields later today. Consequently, it is savaging the growth sectors, with threats of more to come if the Powell fails to meet the easy money demands of the MMs while keeping inflation under wraps. Second, the Fluent board gave implied forward guidance for 21Q1 and 21Q2 that indicates non-sequential growth as it changes its inner workings to create a more profitable platform for its customers in the latter half of FY21. Since that guidance is not sufficiently bullish MMs are penalizing FLNT stock holders.The bottom line is that FLNT should be a long hold and, if possible, try to add to the bottom over the next few months in anticipation of a breakout going into summer. That is, unless other events don't cause further disruption..."
Buy when nobody wants it. March 12 guys. 2 weeks away
"Apparently, great numbers. Must have really scared the shorts. Stock up 20 percent. Spin-off going forward and big growth ahead. Really like the Fluent story and the management."
Looks like good numbers. Management sounds upbeat about the future of the company. Now free of the Dubner cloud which cast a large shadow. Good little growth story. Time for the stock to breakout higher.
"Don't worry about random short term movements that are just noise. FLNT has outstanding growth and is now profitable. It's PEG ratio is attractive. It is firing on a all cylinders thus far and continues to have amazing growth. This stock can dip to $2 and I still wouldn't worry. The long road to the top with small cap companies is filled with bumpy rides. You bought in because you are an investor and a true believer in the company. Stay strong, nothing is wrong here. You will be rewarded much more than short term traders on this gem."
Fluent is up 6.06% to 2.45
"Even though Y/Y and Q/Q revenues are up, the bears are louder right now because they had to revise their guidance from ~14-16% growth to ~11-14% growth. It's going to be a large oversell in the short term. The company is still growing at a sustainable rate, and they might even beat revenue projections for a quarter or two over the next year, thus this will be a big hoopla over nothing."
/.Here are my questions:1- why did they offer shares in January while claiming that they will announce large dividend after closing the merger? do they know that the deal will not close. Announcing that they will have large dividend and then dilute shareholders don't make sense to me.2- what the impact of offering shares after merger deal on the other party of the merger? this material change which lead me to believe that they have zero confidence in closing the deal
SKLZ is one of their clients too. I have sklz at $22 and i love to see flnt going up like skillz 
"This move was expected but way overdone. The company is building up it's business - new headquarters, new corporate positions, new clients - investing in the future.There are companies trading at $100 a share, while losing money. This company is growing and is in a good place going forward. Bought more yesterday and will keep buying at these absurd valuations."
Buy the dip
This could boom depending on $TTD ER
"I’m vested, Can anyone tell me some info on how the capital is being eaten up by the time it’s at net income for shareholders? Any bright opinion or info would be appreciated!(Info grabbed from Yahoo finance)Gross Profit (ttm)95.58MEBITDA23.31MNet Income Avi to Common (ttm)-10.09M"
"Forget defending itself. Come out with some forward looking guidance. $65 million in revenue, $9 million net income, 0.14 per share profit. That's doable...."
6 month chart looks like a regular volatility contraction pattern trying to find a new base at higher prices . Normal pull back
"Year over year, the financial for FLNT are solid. EBITDA positive, net income positive, long term debt is down. I bought 4,000 shares at 5.67 this morning. No regrets..."
https://ampgoo.com/have-insiders-been-buying-fluent-inc-nasdaq-flnt-shares-this-year
Adding more at the bottom to average down and hopefully turn a profit quicker once market corrects itself.
"Hopefully this whole market crash is behind us and great stocks like this are free to fly up to their correct valuation, which I estimate is around $18"
"it seems we are on right direction. The company should provide updates. If there is progress, we will see something"
Lets squeeze those short
What happened today?
Fluent is up 6.67% to 2.72
"reduced guidance last quarter, no guidance this past ER. this is a sinking ship. they're trying to hide the bleeding."
"FYI if you believed in FLNT when you initially invested in it, I don’t see any reason in selling. People selling it rn are people that didn’t even look into the company LOL. Still holding strong! Buy the dips if you can but I still like the stock :)"
"Buy shares in any company that had an earnings surprise and rose the day following the news. These stocks experience what academics call the ""Post Earnings Announcement Drift"". Studies clearly show that these stocks usually outperform the market over the next 9 month."
"After some DD, just bought 10,000 shares. Looking to retire early"
"Every time they announce a new management hiree the stock gets clobbered. Personally, I think it is a very positive sign. The company is growing, expanding and getting more business. All good"
When is this stock going to move? It has been pinned under $2.50 all quarter! It should be trading in the $4-$5 range easily given current fundamentals
"Why can't this company make more money No matter how much revenue's grow, they are lucky if they make a penny a share. It's great that they aren't losing money but how about growing the profits. Going nowhere, in a hurry."
"Hi Frank, I amAlso following this ticker. Not sure the reason behind the jump today. Perhaps someone new increased the target?"
"This is one bizarre stock, so far. Short trading history and no one seems to know what this company will report for.earnings, since it was spun off from Cogent. If you're a gambler you would be buying this stock now. The Fluent part of Cogent was supposedly always profitable, the CEO and other insiders were buying the stock before the spin off, and other positive developments point to some future upside in this stock. I hope I am right."
"Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks said "" I believe we are heading into a new age, and the future is Blockchain"""
Guess I’m stuck with the bag 
Added this morning. Like the business and space they operate in. Good luck to all.
Pretty quiet in here considering the news that came out today where Fluent is named as a global ROI leader with Facebook and Google...
"Looks like Fluent has one, maybe two more quarters to turn things around. They set aside $4M for the anticipated settlement, so the $3.7M settlement restores $300K to the cash flow balance. The PR from the settlement is killing the share price that can only be recovered through a series of strong earnings reports. The board telegraphed that this quarter would not be good as Fluent restructures its marketing to ""better"" customers. Therefore, we need a remarkably pleasant surprise to stanch the bleeding.We'll know soon enough..."
Way undervalued compared to other digital advertising peers
"26,000 March 10 calls have been traded today. Made to top 50 list. Something brewing?"
"It’s strange how the mysterious Michael the shorter disappeared as fast as he showed up. Strong ER, Brauser almost gone, dead weight of Red Violet after spin off and large insider buys. This is a winner. Still think great upside still for this company"
Not bad. I like the direction of company but Brauser hammers the SP. I hope for success soon. https://stocktwits.com/livetraderalerts/message/135349379
This is only the beginning!
RAD ran up 200% with similar news:Looking for another 50% upside!
Insane volume. Hope it continues tomorrow.

Bought some march calls here. hoping for a run by then. good revenue and good company
"If you look at the 50 MA-line with 1h candles, you'll notice that over 86% of the time, when the 2 first to pop above the line are 2 great green ones, it will go up for day. Look at it yourself with the chart. All we need is for it to keep going up for the next hour. And we we'll all be making good gains consistantly for the next week."
Another Frost Honig stock #FLNT tanking. Frost owns 25 %
po. s. company
Volume should be 20m and could double with 7m short squeeze Ready for it??
I guess this is the real story of the price movement recently:https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1460329/000146032919000030/fluent-sx3.htm
"Repositioning for growth with larger companies and people are selling, HA! I will be adding. From the CC --- ""That's a great question, Jim. And we referenced that we're now working with 5 of the 25 largest companies in the world at the onset of this year, that number was two."" Let that sink in for little FLNT, still lots of market to grab. See you in the double digits."
"I am going to hold this for as long as it takes to come back,"
Day traders aren't here yet otherwise it will go boom soon.
Picked up another large position today. Options are 3 x normal volume. Second time a top ten unusual option trade in a few weeks. Lets see if it breaks that $8.50 upper resistance. All this call buying was the same with RKT two weeks ago when I bought it.
Thoughts as this drops?
This is the perfect time for FLNT to start buying its own stock. The price is absurdly low now and is a great bargain. FLNT has $21 M in cash and probably can borrow more or use an existing line of credit.
It s a beat
"This is a very successful fast growing company that just happens to be profitable. Yes, they are making investments in their future, which may slightly eat into the profits, but I am still bullish. Good time to buy IMOP."
The low volume makes it easy to drag this down and is a pain to watch
Anyone share some spin off info
This thing is still flying under the radar but after day like this it'll start popping up much more.Short term PT @ 10$.
Lets go!! Whole market is hurting and we are flying!
Just bought another block at $7.80
"Fluent Announces Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2020 Financial Results Q4 2020 revenue of $82.0 million, up 2.5% over Q4 2019 Net income of $0.2 million, or $0.00 per share Media margin of $32.0 million, up 21.8% over Q4 2019 and representing 39.0% of revenue Adjusted EBITDA of $11.1 million, representing 13.6% of revenue Adjusted net income of $5.4 million, or $0.07 per share"
Looks like end of year tax selling
Back close to 175M market cap means this is in the buy zone again. I think they are doing the right thing for long term success and profitability.
Why COGT dropping continuously. Should I hold it?
$4+ this week
"I find it disturbing that I, as a small investor, can exert so much control over the options on this stock. I often see no bid, and as soon as I toss up a 5 cent bid, 1000 other bids go up at 5 cents as well. the same goes for the ask. this stock appears to be solely traded by bots."
"Yesterday morning:Canaccord Genuity initiated coverage on Fluent Inc (NASDAQ: FLNT) with a Buy rating. The price target for Fluent is set to $5.00. Fluent earned $0.05 in the second quarter, compared to $0.06 in the year-ago quarter. At the moment, the stock has a 52-week-high of $3.90 and a 52-week-low of $1.02. Fluent closed at $2.29 at the end of the last trading period."
everything green on my screen today but FLNT
Short squeeze incoming from now till earning. $10 is old pt now
ALL my fault I bought some shares yesterday. This is what usually happens !!!
"let`s pray this is the bottom now,... otherwise we see again at 2 $ range"
I see acquisition coming on our way. FLNT going to $12+ soon.
"I just bought, so prepare for it to do nothing but drop from now on. Sorry."
stock appears poised for a great rebound
Very nice bounce back after an aggressive selloff. This was one of the best buying opportunities that you will get to own this stock. Holding for the long term.
"Good product, unfortunately they need to up their game with the sales management executives. To much of an old boys network, they set unrealistic sales goals, that constantly change, the talent people quickly see this and jump ship, leaving them with lowest performers. I remain hopeful CEO takes action and corrects this problem. Otherwise they should consider strategic transaction to unlock shareholder value."
"Big week coming for FLNT this week. I am very excited for earnings and guidance. If the stock follows the rest of the field (which I expect it to do), hopefully we can get to double digits by EOW. Thankfully last month's red market is behind us. It was killing companies even with good earnings. Now that everything is green again, earnings will only move it up like crazy. GLTA"
"Alot of impatience in here. They have shifted focus to land big time clients this year. Whether that pays off or not... we’ll see. If so, could be next $apps in 2022. IMO. DYOR"
Anyone know anything about this company? I purchased 3 weeks ago strictly off reading the chart
"No deal, happy days!!!"
"Happy to be in this, but I think I need more shares...I was an early investor last year in APPS, and I see some similar attributes. Digital advertising should boom in 2021."
Stock is showing some life this week. Nearly doubled off it's low for the year. Will it continue. Betting it will.
I am not sure I can hold such a loss any longer but definitely hurts
I told you $8 coming by end of week.
"Looks like management getting their act together, let’s keep this going ."
"Crazy reaction to decent qtr, must be a sell the news event"
Great Recovery today. Not long till this is double digits.
"I am still holding this, its not easy. hard to walk away with the loss though."
Bashers tried hard this morning to spread fear and steal shares. Nice try. Going to double digits.
That's funny I just applied to a job on linkedIn for this company and looked and saw many recent new postings so it looks like something is happening
$15 by june
Great time to start a position or to average down
Extremely undervalued company!!!
I am getting all giggly thinking about earnings. No reason this won't shoot up 20% just like APPS and PERI did on their earnings. The field is flying high!
"Current FLNT price has not been priced in latest fundamentals, target raised to $6.5."
Should see 4.60 close
This one gonna tank.. if move to cash for now only daytrade..
Market cap too low here but a great time to open a position or add IMO. Remains to be seen if they will pull off the transition successfully; I am a believer.
They knew before today that the deal will not close (I questioned this in my previous post). Today's news prove that.
"Shorts are killing the price, the buys outnumber the sells by a good chunk today"
"New York-based Fluent agreed to pay $3.7 million, according to the attorney general's office. It said Fluent provided the broadband industry with more than 5 million digital signatures for net neutrality comments."
Selling appears to be fading here. Maybe some green days ahead.
This bag is getting harder and harder to hold... in at 5.86
Buying the dip worked and should continue to work. It’s time to buy and holding for 1-2 years minimum.
"Fantastic buying opportunity right now. Market is over-reacting to ""blood in the water"" that is exceedingly disproportionate to the news. Bargain basement time, folks."
"After the earnings report, why on earth would it be down after hours? It's like Bizarro world"
"At this point having no P/E seems to be looked at more than already making a profit. Dreams and sales growth is great. Having and doing both, with a profit would seem better. Dreams and sales are great, but profits is what makes a long term model."
Next APPS here
