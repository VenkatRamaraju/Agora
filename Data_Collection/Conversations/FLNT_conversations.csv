"lost over $2000 following someone else’s conviction, good lesson about not following alerts."

Bought some march calls here. hoping for a run by then. good revenue and good company
Back close to 175M market cap means this is in the buy zone again. I think they are doing the right thing for long term success and profitability.
"Looking better and better down here. I think this will turn up soon, most will wish they bought more. good luck longs."
This is the perfect time for FLNT to start buying its own stock. The price is absurdly low now and is a great bargain. FLNT has $21 M in cash and probably can borrow more or use an existing line of credit.
"Hello, is anybody home? Are the doors still open, what is happening with this company"
"Over a million shares short, with volume basically at its minimum (I know it was less over the last couple months)… Days to cover, they better be scared!"
Market cap too low here but a great time to open a position or add IMO. Remains to be seen if they will pull off the transition successfully; I am a believer.
are they releasing ER today?
"26,000 March 10 calls have been traded today. Made to top 50 list. Something brewing?"
"held for 2 years, bought at 1.75 directly from a stock screening email. sold at 4.15 yesterday, not sorry."
"FYI if you believed in FLNT when you initially invested in it, I don’t see any reason in selling. People selling it rn are people that didn’t even look into the company LOL. Still holding strong! Buy the dips if you can but I still like the stock :)"

Pretty quiet in here considering the news that came out today where Fluent is named as a global ROI leader with Facebook and Google...

Magnite is looking good at these prices, but their SpotX guidance isn't that great. Fluent is a pass imo. TTD I'm not familiar with enough to comment."
