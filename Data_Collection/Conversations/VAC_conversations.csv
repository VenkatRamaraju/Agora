"MAR warning is bad news for VAC, given that VAC depends so much on the call transfer program run by MAR. If their own rooms are going empty, how willing do you think they will be to transfer a customer over to timeshare?"

"For the record.......Its not how many cars you make, Its how many cars you sell. This is important.The ENTIRE automotive sector is in complete collapse, and Tesla just happens to be in the automotive sector.Berlin is on hold, model S is real tired, model X is a warranty nightmare, model 3/Y not sure if the 3 will give up sales to the 3, no semi, no roadster, no 400000 orders for the Y, no robotaxi, no fsd (yet people paid for it), $11.6B debt......Tesla in 17 years has NEVER had an annual profit, and that streak is very safe.$spy$tvix$sqqq$xom$lyv$grub$uber$vac"

"It is a miracle to see this stock at this price in a time where there is literally no travel and people trying to survive. MVW seems to rely mostly on their existing customer for sales. I wonder how long a company can survive on such a sales model. I hear from my friends in Orlando that the city is dead with all the parks at lowest to no visits. It is hard to even believe that someone will buy timeshare in this market conditions that we live in when there are hotels and other options available at 1/3rd of the price to rent. I do not see any growth in this business for next 5 years. The Beta for this business needs to be recalculated and new risky discount rates need to be used for valuation. With their revenue almost at 30% of pre-covid days, they may probably have to cut more cost meaning more layoffs. Considering their cash position and the securitization market that is ahead of them with such low sales, it will be an interesting company to watch.My prediction is that it is a very tough road ahead for timeshare business and for this company to keep afloat. I do not think that market has stabilized yet. I think this stock is not work more than $60 considering the risk and return at this point of time."
excessively over priced/valued right now. Defaults and declining net new sales for years to come.
"A nice breakout on earnings! Club/Destination points are selling as they offer so much more than traditional timeshare weeks. VAC was not substantially affected by the Caribbean storms (aside from St Thomas,) and I know for a fact that demand is up for Aruba destinations and others I suspect. So many other island resorts will be offline for years to rebuild."

VAC is now threatening Aruba owners who are renting out their units. THey are threatening to take peoples units away from them for renting units. Marriott offers to rent units for owners but take a very high fee. They also rent units out on their website. But after all these years they are coming after owners who have been renting their units for years. I called Marriott and they confirmed the existence of the letters from legal in Aruba. VAC will hide behind Aruba law and keep it in Aruba courts.

"I heard the CEO in CNBC Cramer. They did $17 million this quarter. I am pleasantly surprised that they even did 5% to 6% of last year. I think it is going to be a slow and long recovery for VAC. I should have shorted it when it was over $100. I think that the market will fall again when the results of 2nd Q are announced next month. Right now, every company has to be revalued based on the current macro economic conditions. I think Beta based on prior index and stock data might not be applicable. Bearish short term because I have no idea about long term in this market."

I think VAC might have reached its upward limit and that a pullback may be possible. the other week awesomeSTO-CKS alerted this company i think. google them .
Down she blows...here comes fair value of $60/Share. Net New sales will be in severe decline over next 2+ years. Rental/management fees...which is where VAC makes it money after a unit/time is sold will be down significantly. Defaults on loans of past sales will be up. Revenues from 'extras/foods/incidentals will all be down with capacity levels limited.
"I Disagree Lou, Covid is spiking to all time high stats, the 2nd wave is here and getting stronger... people are NOT traveling, and certainly are not renting beach property where throngs of people could gather. Moreover, with Covid restrictions and another probable lock-down soon coming, VAC is dead meat, and is a great short / certain sell at these recent gains. Sell if you are a long, and short the hell outta this otherwise... I'm looking for $30ish a share soon (or lower)... maybe even bankruptcy will be in the cards."

"If you owned ILG and received shares of VAC, you should sell. VAC has a flawed business model. It buys back its timeshares for pennies on the dollar and resells them. It is not recurring income. At some point it will blow up."
"Digital is the buzz world in earnings call for VAC. I am curious to know what % of total revenue is directly from Digital Sales? I wonder if they are talking about lead generations through website, email communications and other oft repeated tasks in the industry. It is near to impossible to sell timeshare online digitally to new customers.. Are they referring to their existing customers buying extra points through some online process? It is a bag of mixed BS...lol... Can any analyst enlighten me? I am holding it but might short this baby soon."

No justification for its recent bump in stock price. Looks like a good time to short it back to the 50s. Cheers!
The near-term and mid-term outlook looks awful and it is up over 20% in a week from ZERO news. Why is this stock up???

"This valuation based on lost revenue is out of control. COVID-19 cases and deaths are climbing, so travel is going down significantly. Business travel decreases significantly. If they open entirely, they will be bleeding money for well over a year here. Great short now! Love the puts!"
IR guy is a dueche. Been there a year and has done nothing to help. Worthless and has this whiny  tone to his voice. Street says he was nearly fired multiple times from Avis and was actually canned before that. Just our luck while battling a pandemic we get to deal with this clown!!

"Time shares are selling, as cruise ships are closed, and luxury places hard to find at low time share prices. Having your own seperate apartment, with kitchen much safer than congregating at a hotel, or cruise. So, guys, which way is up?"
Nice close up 12% just before today's earnings call. Demand is very high for some their beach resorts. We had a unit for rent in Myrtle Beach next week and had 8 inquiries just this week. With cruising gone for the rest of the year (yeah it will be) time share demand for the summer beach areas is strong. One ominous threat for the east coast beach resorts - the impending hurricane season. Good luck to all ...

Great way to own this is through a hedge fund trading at 60% discount SVCTF. Owns this and many other dynamic small and mid cap growth stocks. Also owns a huge position in Ebay and Ebay calls. Has a 20% % compound average since 1987. It is the largest of the 5 funds I own. For those looking for a break from the ups and downs of individual stock ownership.

Baby boomers era ending. Airbnb and other options available. Loss of personal retirement savings due to COVID. Travel paralysis. Social distancing that can severely restrict sale of timeshares. Struggling industry to get new customers and depending on existing owners may find it very difficult to sell points. 2nd Q results will be a disaster.. Loan delinquencies and the uncertainly with the business model makes me bearish on this stock.
