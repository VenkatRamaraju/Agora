JMIA is up 8.72% to 20.69
"Shorts couldnt crash us after earning. Its only up from here. Latest after the earning in february, its over 50 again!"
Looks like heading towards $18
"loaded more today. I see now why this conversation never connects, because it is between short term speculators and long term investors. Different views. And I dont believe a short term speculator can bring in any good profit. This stock is all about long term."

"Jumia open “Grub” in Africa “Through our on-demand platform, Jumia Food, consumers can make ad-hoc purchases of grocery and FMCG items from convenience outlets and supermarkets for delivery within one hour. We are also piloting the use of dark stores or micro fulfillment centers located in high population density areas for the fulfillment of grocery orders”"
Still waiting for 15$ ? 
$JMIA is doing a lot of good for Africa and the Hedge Fund Bots are trying to BK the company by selling shares deep into the red every single day. They will sell many time the shares on the float and hedge those excess shares with puts and calls till investors push prices so low they can cover for pennies on the dollar or just put it into BK re buy the company pump it up and do it all over again. If your serious about your money contact anyone in Congress that will listen beg and plead for mercy these are trillion dollar hedge funds wrecking are society and keeping us poor
Resistance has hit 4 times this month. $22.00 seems to be the bottom. Shorts have had their moment but today has tired the sentiments. My position in JMIA is solid and I’m excited for the future. Stay long stay calm. GLTA
"There are traders and there are investors. Both make money. The taxes paid by traders is lot higher than the investors. But that is a different thing. The last continent left behind development on the planet is Africa for whatever reasons and I do not want to get into a political debate here. The growth rates will be far bigger in the under developed nations compared to developed nations. Growth rate is what market looks at. That will come and if any one has any doubts it, look at the countries where growth rates are higher than the developed countries in the last two decades. When someone says it is Amazon or Alibaba or Africa, it does not mean that the dollar valuation will be similar but the PPS increase will be in similar proportions. I don’t expect this company to be a Trillion dollar company at least in my life time. I don’t even dream of it. But I know the potential in terms of multiples in PPS this company can achieve. I have seen it in India with e-Commerce companies started by college graduates achieving multi billion dollar valuations. I have seen in other countries where internet penetration and user hesitation in using e-commerce platforms changed faster than we could imagine. Yes, one last issue is about the ability of people to spend. That is one master stroke from the Management by moving out of high value luxury items to essential items as they know essential items are always in demand. But when it stabilizes even the stuff like smart phones, branded apparel will eventually make it back to Jumia platform. Good Luck all fellow longs. In 2025 let us meet again and check if our investment thesis is right and I believe it is right."

"Once again, large buys coming in!"
Gotta love watching the MM liquidate 500k of their shares in the last 10 minutes to make sure this closed below $20 so options contracts expire worthless. 15% of total volume today in last 10 minutes. 40% of the shares traded today were synthetic.

"This company is going to have to announce some type of milestone achievement. Such as a certain amount of monthly users, or app downloads, or strategic partnerships."
"I expect Q2 ER to be good. Jumia is focused now on growth after 6 consecutive quarters of positive and growing gross profit. Jumia Q1 ER said: ""About three years ago, we decided to set the business on a clear path toward profitability. And we chose to do that instead of growing and scaling as fast as we can because we wanted to make sure that as the business scales, it turns profitable. We have now significantly improved our unit economics, our costs are under control, and it's time now to grow faster."""
"Been here since $6, this is a long term investment. I plan on holding for at least 5-10 years. A smart investor doesn’t stress about the stock each day. Be patient"
Strong support at $19 I think we can go to 24 by next week.

"Jumia is a long terme stock, I'm holding it for 5 years or more. see JMIA at $1000/share"

$JMIA Hedge funds are still latched onto JMIA shorting every uptick and killing investor confidence. These rotten practices have been going on for close to 4 decades. We have to stop the unlimited hedge fund shorting. At this point I wouldn't be surprised if every share has been shorted twice and they will not let this off the floor ever and will eventually sell every share 10 times until they can BK it so it can get bought and started all over again. Business will keep growing but will be strangled in a hedge Funs snake hold
Short term mid term and long term indicators point lower
"this dropping stock doesnt make Sense anymore, it's clearly manipulated and then some.. just bought extra 15k yesterday, looking to buy another 4k if prices keep dropping tommorow"
"Honestly, jumia drops 5% on any casual day, so at the end todays report was not that badly welcomed. I was expecting 20% drop on bad news."
"And there it is again, some strong buy volume right on schedule!"
At this point… if I would be BABA i would offer 5-6 billion and takeover the complete logistic infra etc they build over 9 years…To compelling… any competitor would need years and years to build it up

Aug 4 : Jumia Upgraded to Buy by Zacks research
"This whole “cash flow positive” and “fundamentals must be good” charade is getting very old even for a proficient short such as myself. In fact I covered every position because novice shorts think it is getting way too easy to make money and every small cap growth stocks will go to zero. We are seeing the opposite of the hat we saw in February. Bulls capitulating for losses, lots of panic while shorts are exuberant and believe high growth stocks will go to penny land.Going to scale long positions in next week into beat up growth names. $sdc$nndm$jmia$surf$root"
they have spent extra $10M more on sales and advertisement expenses than year ago... and for that they got $1M Gross profit and $30M less revenues...They definitely do not rush to reach $100 pps :-)visits of their websites are not growing...so hardly can the business... you can check on monthly basis on similarweb
Fake red at pre market. Green when bell rings
My wishful thinking of the week: I hope $JMIA mimicks $MELI ! $SE
"You can figure out that the ER was not bad (and in fact as envisioned) by the fact that the stock is holding up quite well.. If ER was truly bad, stock would have dropped > 10%."
Jumia is so oversold at this level that I have my next buy order at $17.75 I don’t go more than 10% my total investment fund but this I may have to eke out a bit more.
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Thetraderguide.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"I'm holding a few hundred shares at about $23.50, so I'm happy with the past two days, but has there been any news? I haven't figured out why we're seeing this sudden pop this week."
Jumia Pay registered a nice growth in Q2. Long term has very good potential.
RSI is indicating that it is way over sold
Pattern continues as more large block buying just now!
Shorts are trapped and dont know what to do lol
Jumia has only done 141million in revenue since the quarter ending in September 2020. Current market cap is just north of 1.8 billion. Currently trading at a 12.75 price to sales ratio. For a company with a negative net profit margin and weak revenue- Jumia is trading at around its fair value. $15 per share would be more appropriate
It’s difficult to think that this stock was almost $70 less than one year ago!
"On TV I watched Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya win the Tokyo Olympic Marathon. Many of the world-class marathoners were exhausted in the hot weather with 86% humidity. But Kipchoge chugged along at controlled pace and at the finish line looked like he is good for another five miles.I imagine it must have pleased Jumia because its strategy is similar:Africa is a continent-size opportunity but it is dynamic and you have to adapt and control your pace.It is good to grow but first get your Unit Economics and costs under control.So after 6 consecutive quarters of positive and growing gross profit, and substantially improved Unit Economics, Jumia in its Q1 ER said ""It is time now to grow faster."" That is pacing and control. Kipchoge would be pleased."
"Jumia ER was better than most think. We all know how difficult e commerce is in Africa. However they have increased 13% yoy their orders where other e-commerce companies like Wish saw disappointing growth. Jumia has established a solid ecommerce model for doing business in African countries even with the inordinate amount of instability in the various countries including the pandemic. It’s a amazing they even have the kind of revenues they do. The recent buys by DB include 100k share buys by BNP, Susquehanna, and Intervest and Raymond James. Now is the best time to increase your investment exposure to Jumia."
I found the most recent photo of Clarkissa -
Looks like the large buys stopped at 10:45ish. Drifted the rest of the day:(
The BIG reward is years down the line for those who hold LONG.

And once again this morning another large block being purchased!
"JMIA has broken support, be ready for under $10"

DE Shaw bought the dip today and increased their net share ownership by 200% to 2.8 million shares in addition about a dozen firms bought 870k lots today as noted in their 13F. I’m buying w the smart money.
"Clarissa, I'm really impressed. You rode this thing all the way down from the $50-60 region as a vocal short seller, making a ton of profit, only to reverse your position at around $18 (which now looks like it was pretty damn close to the absolute low) in order to ride the elevator back up and amass even more gains. Godspeed to you, Miss."
"JMIA is going to sink into the Abyss, $10 coming in the near future."

This is all I have to say 
"Back to $70 Q4 for 1 simple reason, if you listened to earning conference call, they now focus on Food because they seen the highest growth in this sector, they Focus on African Walmart/Costco now than Amazon…Etc, they also continue to grow on the credit cards and going to be mini bank with digital money wallet"
"These large blocks are either shorts covering or outright new buys. Either way, it leads to a rising stock price!"
There have 6 separate instances of large blocks being purchased just today alone!
Rise of the Taliban is a major negative for this stock. No longer worth the risk. Sell if you can. Only way it rises is through a memetrade. Islamic militants will be emboldened for many years and this will make deliveries more difficult throughout Africa not just northern Africa.
"Think people are being too harsh here. Started a position Friday close. why? Way more cash on balance sheet , smaller losses compared to a year ago, and it's interesting to see a expanded eco system and I assume a continuation of that with more pillers of the company being added. defiantly a buyer and believer here."
This recent action has been quite disheartening. I think the thing to remember is that this is not JMIA specific. Virtually everything has been red for the last 2 weeks now. Use these market conditions to get your discounts
"Guys, how you can explain that jmia revenues staying at the same level as past year quarters? I am talking about quarter 3 for example."
We all fooled by Andrew left so called pumper #$%$ shorter ... he shorted-in the beginning then pumped unprecedentedly just to gain and to short again.. If he hadn't done that then SP would have risen gradually and held the gains!! Now who bought high are stuck and stock is still undervalued
There's the dead-mouse bounce we've been expecting .... trying to allow $17.50 calls to have some residual $value .... next week she heads to $16!!
High options volume!

"In my opinion we must hold it 1-2 years target. Hope it 'll have a better earnings report towards b.e. and growth in their jumiapay business. Concern? rate of ""cash burn"". Price target? a rational and modest one is 37-40. I'll wait for it"
"It is a good ER. Jumia grew orders by 13% year-over-year, increased ad and promotions gradually toward 2019 level taking advantage of its cash position, and took concrete steps for off-platform use of JumiaPay in Egypt. Now Jumia has 7 quarters of positive gross profit. Still has $638 million cash to pursue its goals. The 13% growth of orders may look small but it has been only 3 months since Jumia said it will focus on growing faster."
"Not an impressive report. The guidance was not reassuring, still losses, and not high growth YoY. Jumia Pay and Logistics were the two stronger points but not anything to be really excited about currently. I am selling and will wait until they show some sign of turning the corner. Right now they are increasing marketing to seek growth."
"So basically, no progress? I’m in at average of 8.27 so don’t really care what happens today, just wondering if this company is actually worth holding to"
Cmon jmia wake up !

"People seemed to be worried about Jumia’s performance over the past 6 months as I am too. However, what has happened to the stock will be a mere blip on the chart and future of Jumia. If you believe in the growth opportunities Africa long term and forget about the day to day noise, read the Brookings report on Africa and affirmation of what the future holds. If you believe, you WILL be very wealthy if you stay the course w Jumia. If it goes down, I will buy more. I don’t believe that earnings will be all that great, but the report will state they are running more efficiently which is better to do sooner than later. My hope is Jumia will provide some color on what is happening on the ground and that they see the various economies in Africa are starting to grow. Enjoy the article and have a great weekend. https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/us-trade-and-investment-in-africa/"
"we approach the 6-month anniversary of JMIA's all-time high, JMIA has now lost 70%+ and getting weaker/going lower. I suspect JMIA has another 28% to fall -- toward the $14 level. At this point, JMIA will fallen 80% !!!!! What a fantastic investment !!!"
Jumia should follow the pattern of its similars (Sea in Asia and Mercadolibre in Latam) which were down almost 50% from its highs and now are recovered…
So $JMIA revenue is less than $60m per Q and it’s trading at $20 and $Wish with 600m and no debt $7? Help me understand.
There were promises of 15 today instead..well there are margin calls for the shorts.I already posted my recommendation to buy last week. Who followed it should be in profit.

"Jumia NOT a viable business""What Is Going On With Jumia Stock?The African e-commerce site offers massive long-term potential. But did it enter the market too soon?Will Ebiefung(TMFwillebbs)Aug 27, 2021 at 10:21AMAuthor BioKey PointsJumia's long-term potential is clear, but its operating results aren't very encouraging.Revenue growth is modest, and profitability looks far away.E-commerce is one of the most pivotal retail megatrends in our lifetime, and the transformation is far from complete. While e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Alibaba Group Holding are solidifying their dominance in established markets, Jumia Technologies (NYSE:JMIA) aims to build a first-mover advantage in one of the last frontiers for widespread online shopping: Africa.Is it time to bet on Jumia or sit on the sidelines until the market becomes more developed?A potential opportunity It is unclear how fast Africa's e-commerce market is growing or how much it is worth from a business perspective, but it has potential. First, Africa has a massive population of 1.4 billion, with an average age of 20. Second, and more important, internet use is surging, which drives e-commerce adoption. Cisco estimates that internet traffic in the Middle East and Africa grew at a compound annual rate of 42% between 2016 and 2021. And massive investments in infrastructure could help the sector keep its momentum in the coming decades. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is installing a subsea cable called 2Africa that will provide almost triple the network capacity of all subsea cables currently serving the continent by 2023. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is undertaking a similar project called Equiano, expected to complete the first phase this year.But internet penetration doesn't guarantee e-commerce adoption. And Jumia's challenge will be to overcome Africa's hard infrastructure challenges (roads, bridges, and the like) while encouraging the adoption of a brand new way of shopping for many people. So far, the results aren't encouraging. Growing at a snail's paceJumia's first-quarter revenue increased by a measly 4.6% year over year to $40.2 million. And that wasn't even driven by its core third-party e-commerce marketplace, where annual active customers only grew just 3.3% to 7 million. Marketing and advertising (up 18%) was the company's best-performing segment in the quarter, but this opportunity has a very limited runway for expansion with user growth so slow. To make matters worse, the total value of goods sold on Jumia (gross merchandise value) declined by 11% to 223.5 million as consumers shifted from high-value items like phones to everyday items like toiletries.This slowdown is alarming because Jumia is still far from profitable and would benefit from more scale to cover its overhead. General and administrative costs totaled a whopping $34.2 million (85% of revenue) in the second quarter, and its operating loss increased 25% year over year to $51.6 million in the period. That said, management is taking steps to turn things around. Jumia is boosting its investment in marketing and technology and has begun testing micro fulfillment centers in highly populated areas to help deliver groceries. It is also developing social commerce features like user-generated content (video/picture uploads). But it could take years for these efforts to trickle down to the company's bottom line, and that's a long wait for shareholders.Jumia is not a buy (yet) While Jumia faces massive challenges, I don't think it's a write-off. The African e-commerce market has potential, but it isn't mature yet. And Jumia might have arrived too early to create a viable business in the niche.But the company has accumulated logistics infrastructure, along with user data and experience that could be valuable in the right hands. Jumia stock is not a slam-dunk buy right now, but it is certainly worth watching. 10 stocks that could be the biggest winners of the stock market crashWhen our award-winning analyst team has an investing tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has quadrupled the market.*They just revealed what they believe are the ten best buys for investors right now… And while timing isn't everything, the history of their stock picks shows that it pays to get in early on their best ideas.""My take, Jumia business model is not viable, but e-commerce can be very successful in Africa IF well thought out.... there you have it!"

Here’s IMO. Shorts better cover. We have bounced off $22 as a floor so many times this month I’ve lost count. Earnings will prove the goal to profits laid out by the playbook of Amazon is proving to work to their benefit and has reduced years of getting there. Shorts will be running for the DOOR !!!!!

"LOOK OUT BELOW!!!! She's sinking to the low $teens ... while simultaneously numerous ""fraud"" cases are going to be brought against this Management Team in numerous jurisdictions! We've seen this scenario since January '21 based on a detailed review of the Company and its target markets .... however, when JMIA was running into the $60s it definitely challenged our ""will"" to hold steady our short positioning. It's a beautiful thing to hear all the ""I'm folding"" squeals from longs who have been posting FUD/concepts on JMIA for some time. Now they are all in hiding. Too funny."
Cramer says buy when everyone hates it.
"1.8B Cap, 650M Cash, high revenue and growth, Covid E-commerce stock, buy the Dip"

Additional positive news is that Facebook is joining forces to support the undersea cable project set for 2023 and connecting over 26 countries to high speed Internet. Believe it or not e commerce is moving faster and faster and Jumia will be on top of the e-commerce mountain when this all said and done and now a serious target by Facebook.

Ask yourself this:Where do you think this stock will be when the pandemic is over and the tourist money returns to Egypt? Egypt is the country that matters. They don’t have the logistical problems of other African countries and Jumia has a foothold there.

Deutsche Bank just got in to jumia with 118k shares.
Hodling 500 shares from last year at 9.80$ average. Already double my initial investment. waiting to go back to 60$.
"I want Jumia to go sub-20 sometime before the earnings report, just like it did last quarter. I want to steal some more shares at a cheap price. Now that Jumia has a foothold in Egypt, it’s guaranteed to be at least in the 30’s once the pandemic is over. From there, I can be patient."

Market Makers are shaking the tree trying to get the week hands sell and give up. I am in for the long haul. Even if its 2 to 5 years. At some point it will get over a $100 per share.
"LOL!!! Maybe people are only see in the short run, JUMIA ER is not bad. Jumia still have more than 600M Cash in hand. JumiaPay and Jumia Food are growing fast."
"Unfortunately, I bought at 33. dummy me. Than after weiss jinxed any short term hope, I sold at 18 and took my losses and hope after 30 days it is under 10 to buy back in. I see nothing good over the next few months, however, as Jackxxx weiss said, it is a good company, a bad stock right now. I would look for 12 to buy in again."

"Jumia gives SMEs across Africa access to online loans:https://www.jumia-blog.com/post/jumia-gives-smes-across-africa-access-to-online-loans""Small medium enterprises (SMEs) often find it difficult to access loans in Africa. Often, they don’t have easy access to the required materials, traditional application fees, or the types of traditional financial history necessary to complete the process.We solve this problem with a win-win solution for the seller and the lender. With up-to-date information on sellers’ sales performance and loan repayment schedules, we can recommend adjustments or additional loan offers where needed. Many sellers are repeat borrowers who have successfully repaid their loans. In fact, some sellers are on their fifth loan, building a thriving business along the way. Jumia Lending Service is operational in Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Egypt, and Ivory Coast in partnership with fintech lenders such as Lendigo and Phastmoney in Nigeria, Aman and Vitas in Egypt and Pezesha in Kenya."""

"Whatever is announced tomorrow I get the feeling shares won't be flat... +/- $3 probably in the cards but I don't know which way it will go? Positioned long into ER, pain to around $18 then I would have to consider bailing. Gut tells me ER will be good, but will it be good enough? GL to those who hold."
"The breakdown into the teens continues.As Samr said “Jumia is undervalued”, so Jumia will reach fair value shortly."
Going to be green today great job jumia!!!
"I'm long with over 100k in JMIA, but this earnings report is blah - don't understand why everyone has to pump or gloom, this is a long term play, the quarterly fluctuations are just that as they are trying to find their ground. They have had minimal growth and had hoped for more over the last 2 years, but there are so many factors at play, from COVID to infrastructure, that any commentary here is just inane. I am long because I think there's opportunity, but I recognize that there is a huge execution risk"
Thought we were going to 5$ lol
Sold all. time to move on
Faceplant buys JMIA to compete with Amazon in the retail space.

Is this is a ABNB type of run up? Crash tomorrow? No news and a run up just doesn't seem right.
Jumia will be 43$ by December easy way to double your money - we all know this!
Amazon was losing money for more than ten years. it was at300 dollar's and losing ask Cramer.
"With over 4000 employees, JMIA better report a big increase in revenue this quarter. It seems a company with that many employees would have to have revenue of 4 to 5B. We shall see on Tuesday."
"If it would take $50 billion to get where JMIA is today, $50 a share is not outrageous. Undervalued at current price."
Jmia $60 next stop.
I’m buying if it gets below $14
Weekly Retest of 17$ completed
Does anyone have a sense why there would be so many trades of JMIA going through after-hours?
why is this down so much?
"One should not forget, that cash and cash equivalents more than trippled yoy from (USD million) 195,734 to 637,655. Given the loss it means at least 10 more quarters to go until it could become economically critical, while also providing a lot of capacity to improve the business. From my point of view a very underestimated fact, when it comes to the general, healthy financial situation of JMIA."
30-40 percent pop after earnings. Sit back and enjoy the ride
"In my opinion, this stock is significantly undervalued. Yes, last quarters results weren't too impressive, but what many people don't know is that certain large US corporation(s) are working on building a large undersea cable to greatly boost internet access/usage in Africa. Who do you think will be a primary beneficiary of this development in the short and long term? To me, Jumia is in a great position moving forward and should benefit tremendously from the resources and technological infrastructure being built in Africa. Of course, do you own research and analysis before investing."

Where is REDDIT when you need them. The shorts need to be shown where to go.
I think small caps in general have some room to run. They have been beaten down so hard of late that I think we start to see a rotation out of big cap names and into these beaten down names for a better risk reversal.
