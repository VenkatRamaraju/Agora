Iv been accumulating for months. Now is the time. Looking for a suprise.
Buying @ $7. JMIa days are over
Who’s holding the bag like me…. Long term
Lots of call option activity.
"For the past 5 months I’ve been predicting JMIA would hover mostly around the $17-19ish range for about a year. I was right. Buying more Jumia in the 17’s and low-18’s would be a good idea right now, because the pandemic restrictions are already starting to go away. Expect more volume in the next 6 months. A year from now, JMIA will be hovering around the 20’s, and 2-3 years from now it may be in the hundreds. Internet penetration and logistical infrastructure in Africa is only increasing, and JMIA already has a foothold in Egypt, one of Africa’s healthiest economies."
Is this a real company?
There reporting for USA hands first. Earning best share price will double.
Only 2B market cap... this has so much potential to get to 20B mkt cap in short term.
