"$1000 stock some day. If you have the insight and patience, you will get rich off Jumia.I'm a buyer here. Best to my fellow longs!"
This is all I have to say 
Ignore short bashersMassive potential for jumiaThey build all up over 9 yearsJumia will soon explode to upside  Extremly undervalued !
"Long 5k shares, as of today."
"Once again, large buyer stepping up!"
average at 40. holding forever. something for my great grand children.
Huge buys coming in from big banks. Jmia will be 800$ stock in 2025 same like MELI went from 8$ to 1550$
"There are traders and there are investors. Both make money. The taxes paid by traders is lot higher than the investors. But that is a different thing. The last continent left behind development on the planet is Africa for whatever reasons and I do not want to get into a political debate here. The growth rates will be far bigger in the under developed nations compared to developed nations. Growth rate is what market looks at. That will come and if any one has any doubts it, look at the countries where growth rates are higher than the developed countries in the last two decades. When someone says it is Amazon or Alibaba or Africa, it does not mean that the dollar valuation will be similar but the PPS increase will be in similar proportions. I don’t expect this company to be a Trillion dollar company at least in my life time. I don’t even dream of it. But I know the potential in terms of multiples in PPS this company can achieve. I have seen it in India with e-Commerce companies started by college graduates achieving multi billion dollar valuations. I have seen in other countries where internet penetration and user hesitation in using e-commerce platforms changed faster than we could imagine. Yes, one last issue is about the ability of people to spend. That is one master stroke from the Management by moving out of high value luxury items to essential items as they know essential items are always in demand. But when it stabilizes even the stuff like smart phones, branded apparel will eventually make it back to Jumia platform. Good Luck all fellow longs. In 2025 let us meet again and check if our investment thesis is right and I believe it is right."
"Holy cow!In June, 2019 Jumia had 170 pick-up stations in Kenya.That has now grown over 3 times to 563 pick-up stations in 2 years: https://www.jumia.co.ke/sp-pickups/Shoppers like pick-up stations. You would see lots of comments on Jumia app in Google play store asking Jumia to open pick-up stations in their localities too."
Where are the single digit shorts?

"I'm holding a few hundred shares at about $23.50, so I'm happy with the past two days, but has there been any news? I haven't figured out why we're seeing this sudden pop this week."
"These large blocks are either shorts covering or outright new buys. Either way, it leads to a rising stock price!"
"Good volume, large blocks picked up by banks looking for a double?"
"Oh yeah, I forgot this was going to single digits! What ever!"
What is the sudden reversal?
"Jumia gives SMEs across Africa access to online loans:https://www.jumia-blog.com/post/jumia-gives-smes-across-africa-access-to-online-loans""Small medium enterprises (SMEs) often find it difficult to access loans in Africa. Often, they don’t have easy access to the required materials, traditional application fees, or the types of traditional financial history necessary to complete the process.We solve this problem with a win-win solution for the seller and the lender. With up-to-date information on sellers’ sales performance and loan repayment schedules, we can recommend adjustments or additional loan offers where needed. Many sellers are repeat borrowers who have successfully repaid their loans. In fact, some sellers are on their fifth loan, building a thriving business along the way. Jumia Lending Service is operational in Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana, Egypt, and Ivory Coast in partnership with fintech lenders such as Lendigo and Phastmoney in Nigeria, Aman and Vitas in Egypt and Pezesha in Kenya."""

"Jumia open “Grub” in Africa “Through our on-demand platform, Jumia Food, consumers can make ad-hoc purchases of grocery and FMCG items from convenience outlets and supermarkets for delivery within one hour. We are also piloting the use of dark stores or micro fulfillment centers located in high population density areas for the fulfillment of grocery orders”"
LOL  Soooo undervalued Could easy jump to 25And never look back
"In my opinion, this stock is significantly undervalued. Yes, last quarters results weren't too impressive, but what many people don't know is that certain large US corporation(s) are working on building a large undersea cable to greatly boost internet access/usage in Africa. Who do you think will be a primary beneficiary of this development in the short and long term? To me, Jumia is in a great position moving forward and should benefit tremendously from the resources and technological infrastructure being built in Africa. Of course, do you own research and analysis before investing."
There have 6 separate instances of large blocks being purchased just today alone!
I’m buying if it gets below $14
"Back to $70 Q4 for 1 simple reason, if you listened to earning conference call, they now focus on Food because they seen the highest growth in this sector, they Focus on African Walmart/Costco now than Amazon…Etc, they also continue to grow on the credit cards and going to be mini bank with digital money wallet"
"Money going out of Chinese E-commerce, many of their companies on the way to be de listed, JMIA going to gain on that"
Gotta love watching the MM liquidate 500k of their shares in the last 10 minutes to make sure this closed below $20 so options contracts expire worthless. 15% of total volume today in last 10 minutes. 40% of the shares traded today were synthetic.
The BIG reward is years down the line for those who hold LONG.

This recent action has been quite disheartening. I think the thing to remember is that this is not JMIA specific. Virtually everything has been red for the last 2 weeks now. Use these market conditions to get your discounts
