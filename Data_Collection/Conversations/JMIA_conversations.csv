@no Jumia is well-positioned. It built logistics and digital payments it in Africa from scratch putting it way ahead of any competition. It is trusted by big partners - just look at the very large partnerships it has gained recently : Toll card recharge using JumiaPay for 1.5 million motorists in Morocco.Online text books purchase for Algeria's 10 million school students to help them avoid crowding at physical stores in these covid times.Online purchase of jerseys for the Ugandan National Football Team in football crazy Uganda.The last two are exclusive partnerships with Jumia.
"Tracked Jumia App ""Ratings and Reviews"" counts on Google Play Store for past 2 months.From Aug to Sep, monthly total increased from 33K to 46K showing 40% increase in just 1 month!This portends well for growth.Remember to clear the Play Store cache if you track. Otherwise you will get stale numbers."
"So much BS about jumia being undervalued.Undervalued how? 170 million revenue, with shrinking growth and 1.8 billion cap? Will be undervalued when it drops to 10."
"Jumia Brand Festival campaign is now on across all Jumia countries : https://techtrendske.co.ke/jumia-partners-with-samsung-loreal-and-adidas-for-its-brand-festival-campaign/Managing Director of L'Oreal East Africa : ""E-commerce is a high growth channel for our business and represents a significant share of our growth. we are excited to work together with Jumia teams across Africa."""
"What’s another 3% drop? Also the baggie charade about the great growth africa has, Julia’s partnerships, and fluff promises are getting tiring. Bottom line: jumia is not showing any of that in its earnings, in fact it’s user base is flat and earnings are sliding. Pumpers should be reported for manipulation."
Article on internet today about hyperinflation in Africa and how the price of goods purchased online could triple over the next 6 months forcing many citizens to scale back on purchasing online especially eCommerce sites. Said many eCommerce could go bust or have to raise millions in cash which could dilute the shareholders but with hyperinflation the cash raised wouldn’t last long so they would have to constantly dilute shares maybe every week  mad times we live in.
Buy into this weakness. Expecting a reversal.
Get ready for a massive drop this week possibly going below $15
Lets go jmia at $1000/share 5 years or more
10$ next week ! Hyperinflation in Africa will be the end for Jumia as the cost of goods will sky rocket  ! Profits will dwindle and more fund raising will be required to keep lights on ! Mark this post
Yeah another green day. Lets go Jmia to $70
"I buy this #$%$ stock at 18.17 per share, it goes to 18.25, then hits the skids and likely only because I?m in now, it drops to 17.85 per share. WT actual F?"
Going to the . Looking forward to the next earnings report.
Lets go $20 and more
"@Clarissa is an impatience investor, it will reach $50, $100 and then $1000 by time. Clarissa only looks at the current price and know very little about Jumia. Jumia long terme investors want 10x or more. Again we can't argue with dump person LOL."
Wouldn’t it be exciting to have technology finally at your disposal? Imagine how you felt getting internet-first cell phone-laptop-e-commerce it was life changing. That’s happening to Africa and fast. Internet being set up for all. Jumia will be part of the fathers of e-commerce for the country. I’m long!
This will be a buy at 12!!!

I like to see Jmia at $15 so I can buy more but I keep buying Jumia for the long hold.

quick short at 19.75
SaNR says jumia is up 10% in the last 10 days but he never mentions it’s down 70% from February highs. Haha nice work you PUTZ!
"Cover until its too late, back to 60 in ABOAE"
25 soon… and will never look back
The 52 week low is now $11.51 today.Last Monday it was $7.99Last Wednesday it was $8.72Last Friday it was $10.18Yesterday it was $10.50Today $11.51Jumia no longer has the $4 to $10 range in its one year history. That has to be a Positive going for as the price rises. It will not show such a large gap between the high and low on the 1 year chart.
What’s another 5% ? Just pretend you’re giving money to the hut dwellers of Africa.
The BIG reward is years down the line for those who hold LONG.
@Clarissa is clueless period.I like to see Jmia a low price so I can get more shares. Holding jmia for 5 years. Let stay in this forum for 5 years and lets talk about by then.
"@Clarissa TS earlier posted Vaxart was down $17 from earlier this year. This is a 72.4% drop using the Oct 13 closing price. Clarissa doesn't just troll Vaxart (look at her corpus of posts), she is a prolific basher across many company boards. Just tap her avatar.But, she actually is a long on one company: $JMIA. So, how has it performed according to the standard Clarissa set forth earlier today? It's down 72.6% from its one year high. So, by the standard Clarissa established and her bashing of Vaxart, how does she feel about her own long?I wonder if her fellow longs, co-owners, appreciate her behavior? An old saying: people in glass houses don't throw stones. Or, more appropriately for Clarissa, boulders."
Red africa. It is clear this is heading for 15$.
Im going to buy more slowly and hold. Jumia at this price is a gift.
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks.All you'd need to do is send Steve a messagewhats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR on Te** le* gram @ ( SteveFX01 )"
I added more shares today...cost averaging down. Thank you shorts!
growth factor has alot of potential.. but the valuation is way too high with how little revenue they are doing and much cash they are burning..
nice insider buy of 50k shares.
I just saw a new report by Statista comparing monthly visits to different online marketplaces in Africa https://www.statista.com/statistics/1243149/monthly-visits-on-main-online-marketplaces-in-africa/Jumia drew as many monthly visits as all of the other online marketplaces combined! Jumia is now pushing growth using its 600+ million USD cash and a solid business foundation (consistently increasing gross profit for the past 7 sequential quarters). CEO is confident. He recently bought 1 million USD worth of Jumia stocks with his own money. Jumia is doing well and growing.
"SaNR, who even said anything about Meli closing shop? First off; jumia is no meli, it is far far away from that level. When it comes to revenue, Meli is 30 years ahead jumia both sales wise and geographic footprint.No one said anything about closing shop, but due to hyperinflation both can easily underperform, and the weaker they are like jumia the worse they will do.We are here to make money with stocks right? Not sit on bags of promise that africa will develop in a decade. Even so, we are witnessing a rotation in cash earning value stocks, which jumia is far from one with its losses and declining revenues. Even if it grows and brings more revenue/sales, if it does not develop a means to show profitability by ALL standards, it can remain a laggard for years to come. Also, yea it is in 12 countries, all with garbage currencies, belonging to 3rd world nations. So same shiet diff place. Those currencies will be as valuable as toilet paper. Based off your post, are you a novice or just unaware of how macroeconomics impact stocks like jumia?"
Hmmm  Jumia had 7 mio users last q… in a tam of about 650 mioIf they ad a 1 mio a quarterThat would be 11 y over yProbably 50-60% growthEven conservativeAdding just 0.5 per qIt would be 9Still strong growthUndervalued by a lot2 bill for the internet of a continentAnything is possible on positive side even much faster user adaption

What has really improved here since this African “Amazon” thing was trading at 7$ ? Bunch of dilution and more cash on balance sheet but besides that we are seeing shrinking revenue and flat user growth. Hard to justify 1.8 billion cap.

"@WS tell the whole story. Jumia CEO with a ringside view of the company invested 1 million USD of his own money. Also 30.41% of shares are held by Institutions, which Yahoo Finance calls ""unusually high"" for a company of Jumia's size. There are 213 institutions holding Jumia shares. Baillie Gifford is the #1 institutional investor with a 9.76% stake. Mastercard invested $50 million USD pre-IPO. Top mutual fund is Vanguard with 6.82% of Jumia shares."
"@JDawg Yeah Clarissa and other scaremongers like @WS daily repeat their mantra - ""Africa has problems so no company can make money there."" That mantra is untrue. They are blissfully unaware that 400+ African companies have each more than 1 billion USD annual revenue and they are on average both faster growing and more profitable than companies of similar size in USA and Canada and elsewhere (""Africa’s overlooked business revolution"" report by McKinsey : https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/middle-east-and-africa/africas-overlooked-business-revolution). There is a YouTube video too about this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSG322tqe0kI think longs would find the article and the video interesting and anyone considering investment in Jumia would find some input there. Have a good weekend everyone."

"@Clarissa TS Amazon is a good example because most people are familiar with it. Why would I give an obscure example which no one heard of? Jumia is doing well in a much tougher environment than Amazon. But it has the cash and 7 consecutive quarters of growing gross profit as foundation for growth. Online retail is only 1% of African retail. So it has a massive ramp for growth. And read @zules's latest post - Jumia is by far the dominant ecommerce in Africa as per Statista's latest report. So I do not buy your ""sky is falling"" pretense. But hey, you have a lot to do. You are bashing half a dozen stocks daily. Get to work :)"

"The latest Investor Place article is saying Jumia remains a buy : https://investorplace.com/2021/09/despite-missing-revenue-expectations-jmia-stock-remains-a-buy/Its takeaway is:""Remember, Jumia is not just an online e-commerce platform but a payment processor and logistics company as well. Alibaba has a market cap of $398 billion much larger than Jumia’s $1.86 billion market cap. If the company can achieve even a portion of its growth plans, JMIA stockholders would be very well off.""Amen to that. I would add two more positives. Jumia Advertising Service is shaping up well as the latest Jumia Blog article shows. For new growth global brands need Africa and Jumia has the data and local expertise. Also Jumia is not sitting on its 600+ million USD cash. As mentioned in Q2 ER, It is selectively turning on advertising and promotions, investing in tech, and the next phase of JumiaPay for off-platform use . That too should boost growth."

This website can help you learn about Africa: http://themedicsclub.net/negative-african-stereotypes-do-african-live-on-trees/A excerpt for you: ""But for anyone who’s wondering, NO! Africans don’t typically live in huts and on trees. They mostly live in houses and apartments like the people in the other 6 continents. Yes, there are parts of some African countries where huts are still in existence and the media has not shied away from solely showcasing these as “today’s Africa” but it is not logical to generalize based on that alone. It’s like noticing the large numbers of homeless people on the streets of New York and Houston and then going ahead to portray the USA as a country of homeless individuals. """

Longs are not saying ""Hey guys, buy Jumia TODAY because Apple/Nike/Hyundai set up official shop on Jumia.""You ,on the other hand, are daily predicting imminent doom of Jumia and a bunch of other stocks. For example, you posted 2 weeks ago: ""15$ this week. Sorry bulls. It’s clear as daylight"". That did not age well, did it? :) Any ""clear as daylight"" prediction for next week? LOL"
"YTD low, not even an attempt to prop it up, suppose the Nov. 8th numbers are starting look quite clear, thought the forth coming earning will be decisive ..."
"Jmia at $20, $50 then $100 next stop.Lets go"
SaNR and The bulls back into hiding.
"The most downloaded app in Africa, SaNR saidMany partnerships, SaNR said. Marketplace shift SaNR said Down she goes."
Jumia scooped two awards during KENYA E-COMMERCE AWARDS 2021 on Friday: E-commerce Website of the yearBest eCommerce Loyalty ProgramAlso Jumia's logistics partner G4S won the Best courier service E-commerce awardhttps://ecommerceawards.co.ke/winners/
With a market cap of only 2 billion Jumia is a perfect candidate for buy out if amazon decides to expand in Africa.
"The article about cash burn rate showing about 5 years worth of cash on hand is encouraging. Especially if Jumia shows improvement in revenue and some increased cash flow. And if the stock price increases in the next year or 2, then Jumia can do another offering to get more cash to fund more growth."
This was $69.89 in JAN this year guys!
What made this company jump from $5 to $60?
Jumia for decades to comeWill be the “internet” of a continentSevere undervalued

$GSAT THANK ME LATER
Btw black friday jmia weeks comming Hmmm if they add new users nicely each of next quarter with the growth initiativeThe market is so huge10% of there current tam would mean about 65 mio usersWelll 
"Hello Clarissa, the point of my post was to show your faulty thinking that no company can make in money in Africa because of problems there. As for Jumia's earnings, take the time to read the ERs, specifically:change of business model to third-party marketplaceswitch to frequently-bought lower value items for customer lifetime valueseven quarters of sequentially growing gross profitfocus on growth since late last year (""It is time now to grow faster"")CEO thinks growth plan is executing well; recently he bought Jumia shares worth 1 million USD using his own money.You are busy daily bashing a bunch of stocks - Jumia is just one of many. An example is your post from 2 weeks ago: ""15$ this week. Sorry bulls. It’s clear as daylight"". Clear as daylight? LOL"
Why the jump today ?

SaNR how come you never address hyperinflation in africa considering the sky rocketing commodity prices ? Or does that not matter for a jumia bull?
A bad example! Look how many other stocks never recovered! There are more failures than Amazons.

"Amazon of africa Fake out Strong green now, yet very weak volume, to be faded by end of day into a typical 1-2% green."
"Lets go $25,$70 then $90"
"SaNR,-shrinking revenue -declining earnings-flat marketplace commission revenue -flat user growth You may talk about sales increase, switch to marketplace model, and the selling of every day items, yet none of it is showing in their earnings. Same with all the partnerships and new downloads. There is no growth in a growth stock. Period"

Red is coming to africa.It is clear as daylight this one will be 15 in the next few weeks. SANR agrees
(http://Fairstox.com) is truly one of the best stock advice newsletters out there! Their daily emails give me all the information I need to trade more wisely each day. I rely heavily on their watchlists and recommend all traders should do the same!
Straight up to $20 then $50
"tanTan your predictions of 50, 100, 1000 are inconsequential. So please keep your paws off the keyboard. SaNR, I agree with some of your points, but again you are not addressing inflation. That will crush companies with poor earnings. If inflation is indeed going to persist, all those new brands sold on jumia will lot save jumia from going under. Who is going to buy them off jumia when those poor uneducated Africans have no money left after food prices go up?"
RED ! And heading towards 10$ mark this post 
Going red as usual

"jmia q32021 ERThis is what I had calculated as the ""Waterloo"" of Jumia, NOT that Jumia can be compared in any sense to Napoleon.In the past, jmia has inflated GMV via sales team in an attempt to inflate their sales figures as the basis for their compensation such fraudulent practices, this time, they WILL face dire consequences plus any attempt to cook books.The quarter has just ended, despite the tremendous goodwill we have for African e-commerce, Jumia has fallen on its face in a lot of ways, I will not catalog them here, they are glaringly obvious.Q3 2021 is what IMO will show utter futility in jumia approach to e-commerce in Africa & trigger downward spiral, unfortunately, those looking at preliminary Q32021 results are confirming this by early exit."
 comming… 25 soon and never look back !Severe undervalued
Looks like more shaft taking by the pomPom squad
Watching for potential entry.
Added today at 18.8. Still waiting for the shorts to make it drop further prefarably in low 18 or 17. So can the shortsellers please go to work. Cant wait to waste my money. Perhaps you can post some discouraging massages. I am not selling up and down us good for me. Thanks for the help.
The 52 week low is $10.18 today. Yesterday it showed $8.72 and the day before it was $7.99. The 52 week low will be in the teens next week. It is no longer the $4.00 range that some said they bought this at early last year.
Green as usual LOL
