Total train wreck.See ya at 15.
Lots of cash on balance sheet $836mil. Little debt $14 mil
Added another 1000 at 17.3 and keeping hoping to add in low 16. Keeping cash on the side. Live long and prosper v.
Watch each day for the next week the 52 weak low is going to be higher. It started in the low 7's and will be in the teens by Oct 20th area.
Jumia is going to $35 or higher after earnings.
Jmia $25 is the next stop. Lets go
Thanks shorties i bought 2000 shares at 17.8. Hope we can do this again. When you are pushing the share down can you please push it down to 16. Much appreciated :) stay long.
"October 19th 2021, put it on your calendars. I suspect the period of accumulation will end on or about that date and we will see a secular rebound in small to mid cap growth stocks. Don’t expect much news before than longs; this has been a targeted suppression by MM/HF since February after they were burned on GME and AMC. Nothing last forever patience is the key. You can’t beat the, so join them by accumulating and biding you time."
Broke $20 looking for an easy 25!
JUMIApay is another PAYPAL and will go up accordingly.
Watch list for shorting 2022 Bk play
And Jmia green
Laughing at all the shorties…
Quiet period before Earnings 11/9
Still awful stock. Holding still waiting for earnings.
Feeling this was way over sold. Recent large insider buying. Low market cap considering the market they are spreading like wild fire through
What made this company jump from $5 to $60?
JMIA is down 7.47% to 18.59
Someone is buying heavily
"JIMA is a undervalued stock. Even though the stock has been trading low and the volume is low, it is a excellent oppurtunity to buy now.It will give more than 100% ROI is few years : https://walletinvestor.com/stock-forecast/jmia-stock-predictionhttps://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=JMIA"
"Straight from the lead bashers mouth. She is not selling JMIA, what does that tell you about the bashers long term view. You know why you invested, story has not changed much. Wealth transfers from the impatient to the patient. Choose what type of investor you are.Clarissa TS2 hours agoJdawg, everyone on this board knows I own shares, yet unlike you my cost basis stands at -37$. That is negative 37 a share on 10k shares.Wanna know why? I bought at 4 in March 2020, failed to take profits in February, but shorted the F out of this stock ever since. Also, you can blame China, evergrande, etc, but that doesn’t change the atrocious performance of this stock ytd."
Im going to buy more slowly and hold. Jumia at this price is a gift.
"I fail to understand why @Clarissa is flooding the conversation denigrating JMIA . If she is so pessimistic of JMIA, why doesn't she leave the JMIA room to finds some other stock she believes in. What is the point in spreading negativity"
Live look at Rocket Ray and his short position. Every good bear needs to know when to cover
Fidelity has charged me a fee for holding my JMIA ADS.Has anyone else incurred a fee in their brokerage account ?

Anyone heard from Clarissa today? She’s unusually quiet 
There reporting for USA hands first. Earning best share price will double.
Goldman is putting a lot of money in Africa. JMIA options are more active.
I don't think that JMIA has another 10% in gains in it. Looks pretty bad here. I actually found http://alert-sounds.com/ the other day and their stocks are way better...
"Jmia has massive uptrend. It doesn't if it drops in the short run, I will buy more.I'm holding Jmia for 5 years or more than who will laugh at that time LOLJmia at $30, $60, $100, $200, $500 and $1000 BOOM. Lets go"
Back to 20 before we know it.
SaNR how come you never address hyperinflation in africa considering the sky rocketing commodity prices ? Or does that not matter for a jumia bull?
Lol!!! Many people don't get what is the new Africa. Jmia is a rare opportunity. Im buying most i can and hold it for 10 years. $1000/share or more
Same eps as Tesla at a fraction of the cost!
Watching for potential entry.
Beautiful 10 day chart!

639mil$ of cash on their balance sheet. market cap less than 2B.something has to give!
Hold the line.https://tech-ish.com/2021/10/28/jumia-consumable-habits-change/
Jumia at $60 is coming near you LOL
Market cap?LaughableShould be: 10 bill at least
The 52 week low is $10.18 today. Yesterday it showed $8.72 and the day before it was $7.99. The 52 week low will be in the teens next week. It is no longer the $4.00 range that some said they bought this at early last year.

"We all waiting the moment of explosion. Be prepared, JMIA is going high."
This is a long term play… patience will be rewarded.
"Many people don't get the massive potential of Jumia. Jumia is going to be $1000/share or more in the future.Africa is a continent in which Jumia has 11 countries served. Of course, it will take time, I'm buying and hold for 10 years.Jmia $20, $50 and $100/share next stop"
"Tracked Jumia App ""Ratings and Reviews"" counts on Google Play Store for past 2 months.From Aug to Sep, monthly total increased from 33K to 46K showing 40% increase in just 1 month!This portends well for growth.Remember to clear the Play Store cache if you track. Otherwise you will get stale numbers."
I like to see Jmia at $15 so I can buy more but I keep buying Jumia for the long hold.
"Based on your projection for JMIA free cash flow for the next 7 years, can someone do the simple math for me to show they won’t raise equity before then?"
I just saw a new report by Statista comparing monthly visits to different online marketplaces in Africa https://www.statista.com/statistics/1243149/monthly-visits-on-main-online-marketplaces-in-africa/Jumia drew as many monthly visits as all of the other online marketplaces combined! Jumia is now pushing growth using its 600+ million USD cash and a solid business foundation (consistently increasing gross profit for the past 7 sequential quarters). CEO is confident. He recently bought 1 million USD worth of Jumia stocks with his own money. Jumia is doing well and growing.
Green as usual LOL
Potential Triple Bottom??????
High call volume…
"Algerians can now buy school textbooks online on Jumia and avoid crowding bookstores in these pandemic times. The online bookstore on Jumia is now up and running in time for the new school year: https://www.jumia.dz/mlp-boutique-officielle-livre-scolaire/Jumia's partnership contract with Algeria's National Office for School Publications is one of the largest to date. There are 10 million school students in Algeria which is the largest country in Africa by area. Algeria by itself is one-fourth the size of USA.Jumia is now delivering textbooks everywhere in Algeria for a shipping fee of only 150 Dinars ($1 USD). A typical comment from shoppers in the comments pages on Jumia: ""School book pack delivered in 2 days only, while the queues in front of the bookstores exceeded 500 people ... thank you jumia"".The Customer Lifetime Value of these happy customers is added bonus for Jumia. It also creates trust which according to MercadoLibre CEO was the most important factor in the success of his company."
SaNR says jumia is up 10% in the last 10 days but he never mentions it’s down 70% from February highs. Haha nice work you PUTZ!
See Jmia at $60 sooner than we think
to the moon
"@Clarissa is an impatience investor, it will reach $50, $100 and then $1000 by time. Clarissa only looks at the current price and know very little about Jumia. Jumia long terme investors want 10x or more. Again we can't argue with dump person LOL."
"A lot of posters here trying to tell us to sell so they can cover their short position and or to try and create a long position.So sorry, not selling, go away."
19.99. TODAY
"For the past 5 months I’ve been predicting JMIA would hover mostly around the $17-19ish range for about a year. I was right. Buying more Jumia in the 17’s and low-18’s would be a good idea right now, because the pandemic restrictions are already starting to go away. Expect more volume in the next 6 months. A year from now, JMIA will be hovering around the 20’s, and 2-3 years from now it may be in the hundreds. Internet penetration and logistical infrastructure in Africa is only increasing, and JMIA already has a foothold in Egypt, one of Africa’s healthiest economies."
"The article about cash burn rate showing about 5 years worth of cash on hand is encouraging. Especially if Jumia shows improvement in revenue and some increased cash flow. And if the stock price increases in the next year or 2, then Jumia can do another offering to get more cash to fund more growth."
Was in Egypt during holidays last week. Lots of Jumia advertisements on the streets. Jumia Food Delivery works also.
Only 2B market cap... this has so much potential to get to 20B mkt cap in short term.
Is this a real company?
"First time even on this board, just wanted to hear some chatter, and immediately clarissa ts is the most annoying thing in here  and im not even invested in this company."

"Jumia is not an if stock, it’s a WHEN stock. Bought more today."
Going to the . Looking forward to the next earnings report.
"Hello Clarissa, the point of my post was to show your faulty thinking that no company can make in money in Africa because of problems there. As for Jumia's earnings, take the time to read the ERs, specifically:change of business model to third-party marketplaceswitch to frequently-bought lower value items for customer lifetime valueseven quarters of sequentially growing gross profitfocus on growth since late last year (""It is time now to grow faster"")CEO thinks growth plan is executing well; recently he bought Jumia shares worth 1 million USD using his own money.You are busy daily bashing a bunch of stocks - Jumia is just one of many. An example is your post from 2 weeks ago: ""15$ this week. Sorry bulls. It’s clear as daylight"". Clear as daylight? LOL"
"Markets green, africa red."
growth factor has alot of potential.. but the valuation is way too high with how little revenue they are doing and much cash they are burning..
Lots of call option activity.

RED ! And heading towards 10$ mark this post 
Buy the dip!
"@Clarissa TS Amazon is a good example because most people are familiar with it. Why would I give an obscure example which no one heard of? Jumia is doing well in a much tougher environment than Amazon. But it has the cash and 7 consecutive quarters of growing gross profit as foundation for growth. Online retail is only 1% of African retail. So it has a massive ramp for growth. And read @zules's latest post - Jumia is by far the dominant ecommerce in Africa as per Statista's latest report. So I do not buy your ""sky is falling"" pretense. But hey, you have a lot to do. You are bashing half a dozen stocks daily. Get to work :)"
just put order for 3k at 1845...please sell

"We believe the future of jumia is very dim. As dim as the light quality of its average customer in the mega cities it serves. We have added an additional 2000 shares Friday, so it looks better end of year for “tax loss harvest season”."
"Many people just don't get this, Jumia is doing well in many levels. JMIA stock is down because of manipulation, a good upside correction soon or later."
And bulls were wondering why we never hear about the Nigeria prince scam! It’s evolved into owning stock of this e-commerce play in countries without electric or plumbing.

"@Clarissa TS earlier posted Vaxart was down $17 from earlier this year. This is a 72.4% drop using the Oct 13 closing price. Clarissa doesn't just troll Vaxart (look at her corpus of posts), she is a prolific basher across many company boards. Just tap her avatar.But, she actually is a long on one company: $JMIA. So, how has it performed according to the standard Clarissa set forth earlier today? It's down 72.6% from its one year high. So, by the standard Clarissa established and her bashing of Vaxart, how does she feel about her own long?I wonder if her fellow longs, co-owners, appreciate her behavior? An old saying: people in glass houses don't throw stones. Or, more appropriately for Clarissa, boulders."
Green on another RED day! Consolidation has been happening over the last couple of weeks.
@Clarissa is clueless period.I like to see Jmia a low price so I can get more shares. Holding jmia for 5 years. Let stay in this forum for 5 years and lets talk about by then.

This article adds details helping us understand better:""In-app purchases increase 55% over 2020: Consumer spend fell by 50% at the start of the pandemic. However, as it became clear that consumers would need to adapt to digital methods of shopping, spending quickly recovered.

No. The increased online spending carried through to 2021 :""Unsurprisingly, spending in 2020 peaked in November, coinciding with Black Friday and the lead-up to Christmas.

This website can help you learn about Africa: http://themedicsclub.net/negative-african-stereotypes-do-african-live-on-trees/A excerpt for you: ""But for anyone who’s wondering, NO! Africans don’t typically live in huts and on trees. They mostly live in houses and apartments like the people in the other 6 continents. Yes, there are parts of some African countries where huts are still in existence and the media has not shied away from solely showcasing these as “today’s Africa” but it is not logical to generalize based on that alone. It’s like noticing the large numbers of homeless people on the streets of New York and Houston and then going ahead to portray the USA as a country of homeless individuals. """
Lets go $20 and more

"@Clarissa TS, no camels here in Florida so unfortunately I am unable to ride one :) Annoy Clarissa a bit and she instantly spouts racist slur. LOLSwitch to marketplace model and every day items have been a smart move. Why? Because it achieved Jumia's immediate goal of increasing gross profit.If you do not have gross profit then with every sale you are increasing your net loss.Some ecommerce companies do not care about it but Jumia does (read ER).Jumia now has 7 consecutive quarters of increasing gross profit after fulfillment.After achieving that this year Jumia said ""It is time now to grow faster"" (ER transcript).They have the fire power of $600+ million cash and the foundation (gross profit) to go for growth now.Partnerships are very important to build a continent-wide ecosystem and that is why we longs share such news. Longs are not saying ""Hey guys, buy Jumia TODAY because Apple/Nike/Hyundai set up official shop on Jumia.""You ,on the other hand, are daily predicting imminent doom of Jumia and a bunch of other stocks. For example, you posted 2 weeks ago: ""15$ this week. Sorry bulls. It’s clear as daylight"". That did not age well, did it? :) Any ""clear as daylight"" prediction for next week? LOL"
