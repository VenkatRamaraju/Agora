Shorts are getting really chatty predicting $10 and lower. We shall see. No reason to buy now with no catalyst in sight. Holding long
Anybody see that? There was a HUGE amount of buying/short covering a minute after the close. The price shot way up! YAY!!!
china impact overblown. $JMIA will see $25 very soon and $30 by year end.
"Jumia needs to announce any milestone achievements they may have reached. New users, app downloads, warehouse additions. Do something to get the stock higher, so they can do another offering next year because they are going to need more money to keep expanding. Long JMIA."

"When this stock was $60 and everyone said it was going to $100 or higher, is was a sell.Now that its $22 and people are screaming $0 to $10, its time to buy. Just my opinion."
IMO this one is a better post-ER article on Jumia than the ones I have seen so far:https://seekingalpha.com/article/4448644-jumia-stock-fell-last-month-buy-sell
"Clarissa, I'm really impressed. You rode this thing all the way down from the $50-60 region as a vocal short seller, making a ton of profit, only to reverse your position at around $18 (which now looks like it was pretty damn close to the absolute low) in order to ride the elevator back up and amass even more gains. Godspeed to you, Miss."
The shorts will cover next week…
Um anyone?
Until January 2022 jmia Will be $ 40
"Now each one of the officers and people on the the Board, need to purchase 10K shares just like the CEO did yesterday.They need to put their money into showing the public that they too believe in what they are doing as a company."
So $JMIA revenue is less than $60m per Q and it’s trading at $20 and $Wish with 600m and no debt $7? Help me understand.
Gota love some early morning premarket earnings.
Jumia should follow the pattern of its similars (Sea in Asia and Mercadolibre in Latam) which were down almost 50% from its highs and now are recovered…

I think small caps in general have some room to run. They have been beaten down so hard of late that I think we start to see a rotation out of big cap names and into these beaten down names for a better risk reversal.
This recent action has been quite disheartening. I think the thing to remember is that this is not JMIA specific. Virtually everything has been red for the last 2 weeks now. Use these market conditions to get your discounts

Additional positive news is that Facebook is joining forces to support the undersea cable project set for 2023 and connecting over 26 countries to high speed Internet. Believe it or not e commerce is moving faster and faster and Jumia will be on top of the e-commerce mountain when this all said and done and now a serious target by Facebook.
Waka waka - it’s time for Africa.
Sold all. time to move on
It’s difficult to think that this stock was almost $70 less than one year ago!

"Jumia gives SMEs across Africa access to online loans:https://www.jumia-blog.com/post/jumia-gives-smes-across-africa-access-to-online-loans""Small medium enterprises (SMEs) often find it difficult to access loans in Africa. Often, they don’t have easy access to the required materials, traditional application fees, or the types of traditional financial history necessary to complete the process.We solve this problem with a win-win solution for the seller and the lender. With up-to-date information on sellers’ sales performance and loan repayment schedules, we can recommend adjustments or additional loan offers where needed. Many sellers are repeat borrowers who have successfully repaid their loans. In fact, some sellers are on their fifth loan, building a thriving business along the way.

"In my opinion, this stock is significantly undervalued. Yes, last quarters results weren't too impressive, but what many people don't know is that certain large US corporation(s) are working on building a large undersea cable to greatly boost internet access/usage in Africa. Who do you think will be a primary beneficiary of this development in the short and long term? To me, Jumia is in a great position moving forward and should benefit tremendously from the resources and technological infrastructure being built in Africa. Of course, do you own research and analysis before investing."
Weiss just lost all reputation and trust. I'll never listen to him again !
Should be seeing 15 a week from now
"Once again, large buys coming in!"
@no Jumia is well-positioned. It built logistics and digital payments it in Africa from scratch putting it way ahead of any competition. It is trusted by big partners - just look at the very large partnerships it has gained recently : Toll card recharge using JumiaPay for 1.5 million motorists in Morocco.Online text books purchase for Algeria's 10 million school students to help them avoid crowding at physical stores in these covid times.Online purchase of jerseys for the Ugandan National Football Team in football crazy Uganda.The last two are exclusive partnerships with Jumia.

As mentioned earlier. To deliver product you need infrastructure. You need roads to start with. When this drops below $19 beware of major pullback. I do now own this stock but i find it comical that people see opportunity here. This is not mini Amazon. Get out before you get to $15.
"Jumia NOT a viable business""What Is Going On With Jumia Stock?The African e-commerce site offers massive long-term potential. But did it enter the market too soon?Will Ebiefung(TMFwillebbs)Aug 27, 2021 at 10:21AMAuthor BioKey PointsJumia's long-term potential is clear, but its operating results aren't very encouraging.Revenue growth is modest, and profitability looks far away.E-commerce is one of the most pivotal retail megatrends in our lifetime, and the transformation is far from complete. While e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Alibaba Group Holding are solidifying their dominance in established markets, Jumia Technologies (NYSE:JMIA) aims to build a first-mover advantage in one of the last frontiers for widespread online shopping: Africa.Is it time to bet on Jumia or sit on the sidelines until the market becomes more developed?A potential opportunity It is unclear how fast Africa's e-commerce market is growing or how much it is worth from a business perspective, but it has potential. First, Africa has a massive population of 1.4 billion, with an average age of 20. Second, and more important, internet use is surging, which drives e-commerce adoption. Cisco estimates that internet traffic in the Middle East and Africa grew at a compound annual rate of 42% between 2016 and 2021. And massive investments in infrastructure could help the sector keep its momentum in the coming decades. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is installing a subsea cable called 2Africa that will provide almost triple the network capacity of all subsea cables currently serving the continent by 2023. Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is undertaking a similar project called Equiano, expected to complete the first phase this year.But internet penetration doesn't guarantee e-commerce adoption. And Jumia's challenge will be to overcome Africa's hard infrastructure challenges (roads, bridges, and the like) while encouraging the adoption of a brand new way of shopping for many people. So far, the results aren't encouraging. Growing at a snail's paceJumia's first-quarter revenue increased by a measly 4.6% year over year to $40.2 million. And that wasn't even driven by its core third-party e-commerce marketplace, where annual active customers only grew just 3.3% to 7 million. Marketing and advertising (up 18%) was the company's best-performing segment in the quarter, but this opportunity has a very limited runway for expansion with user growth so slow. To make matters worse, the total value of goods sold on Jumia (gross merchandise value) declined by 11% to 223.5 million as consumers shifted from high-value items like phones to everyday items like toiletries.This slowdown is alarming because Jumia is still far from profitable and would benefit from more scale to cover its overhead. General and administrative costs totaled a whopping $34.2 million (85% of revenue) in the second quarter, and its operating loss increased 25% year over year to $51.6 million in the period. That said, management is taking steps to turn things around. Jumia is boosting its investment in marketing and technology and has begun testing micro fulfillment centers in highly populated areas to help deliver groceries. It is also developing social commerce features like user-generated content (video/picture uploads). But it could take years for these efforts to trickle down to the company's bottom line, and that's a long wait for shareholders.Jumia is not a buy (yet) While Jumia faces massive challenges, I don't think it's a write-off. The African e-commerce market has potential, but it isn't mature yet. And Jumia might have arrived too early to create a viable business in the niche.But the company has accumulated logistics infrastructure, along with user data and experience that could be valuable in the right hands. Jumia stock is not a slam-dunk buy right now, but it is certainly worth watching. 10 stocks that could be the biggest winners of the stock market crashWhen our award-winning analyst team has an investing tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has quadrupled the market.*They just revealed what they believe are the ten best buys for investors right now… And while timing isn't everything, the history of their stock picks shows that it pays to get in early on their best ideas.""My take, Jumia business model is not viable, but e-commerce can be very successful in Africa IF well thought out.... there you have it!"
"On TV I watched Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya win the Tokyo Olympic Marathon. Many of the world-class marathoners were exhausted in the hot weather with 86% humidity. But Kipchoge chugged along at controlled pace and at the finish line looked like he is good for another five miles.I imagine it must have pleased Jumia because its strategy is similar:Africa is a continent-size opportunity but it is dynamic and you have to adapt and control your pace.It is good to grow but first get your Unit Economics and costs under control.So after 6 consecutive quarters of positive and growing gross profit, and substantially improved Unit Economics, Jumia in its Q1 ER said ""It is time now to grow faster."" That is pacing and control. Kipchoge would be pleased."

This stock always goes back down on Thursday and Friday each week to make the call options worthless that were sold during the beginning of the week.
Soon 25  and will never look back
Could double or triple up according to this article ? Will double or triple the other way down. 50% or 60% down likely. Short this or get out. Its a disaster in the making.
dammm $WISH app is addicting!! Awesome concept of e commerce with customer engagement. I am impressed. This could be a huge success in the future. With the right partners and advertisements it could be huge! Can easily see it multiplies x20-30 in the future. Changed my mind for long term investment $AMZN $JMIA $SE
There have 6 separate instances of large blocks being purchased just today alone!
$JMIA is doing a lot of good for Africa and the Hedge Fund Bots are trying to BK the company by selling shares deep into the red every single day. They will sell many time the shares on the float and hedge those excess shares with puts and calls till investors push prices so low they can cover for pennies on the dollar or just put it into BK re buy the company pump it up and do it all over again. If your serious about your money contact anyone in Congress that will listen beg and plead for mercy these are trillion dollar hedge funds wrecking are society and keeping us poor
"Holy cow!In June, 2019 Jumia had 170 pick-up stations in Kenya.That has now grown over 3 times to 563 pick-up stations in 2 years: https://www.jumia.co.ke/sp-pickups/Shoppers like pick-up stations. You would see lots of comments on Jumia app in Google play store asking Jumia to open pick-up stations in their localities too."

"Jumia ER was better than most think. We all know how difficult e commerce is in Africa. However they have increased 13% yoy their orders where other e-commerce companies like Wish saw disappointing growth. Jumia has established a solid ecommerce model for doing business in African countries even with the inordinate amount of instability in the various countries including the pandemic. It’s a amazing they even have the kind of revenues they do. The recent buys by DB include 100k share buys by BNP, Susquehanna, and Intervest and Raymond James. Now is the best time to increase your investment exposure to Jumia."
Deutsche Bank just got in to jumia with 118k shares.
JMIA DDD NNOX SPCE are trading at the bargain price - imo
"There are traders and there are investors. Both make money. The taxes paid by traders is lot higher than the investors. But that is a different thing. The last continent left behind development on the planet is Africa for whatever reasons and I do not want to get into a political debate here. The growth rates will be far bigger in the under developed nations compared to developed nations. Growth rate is what market looks at. That will come and if any one has any doubts it, look at the countries where growth rates are higher than the developed countries in the last two decades. When someone says it is Amazon or Alibaba or Africa, it does not mean that the dollar valuation will be similar but the PPS increase will be in similar proportions. I don’t expect this company to be a Trillion dollar company at least in my life time. I don’t even dream of it. But I know the potential in terms of multiples in PPS this company can achieve. I have seen it in India with e-Commerce companies started by college graduates achieving multi billion dollar valuations. I have seen in other countries where internet penetration and user hesitation in using e-commerce platforms changed faster than we could imagine. Yes, one last issue is about the ability of people to spend. That is one master stroke from the Management by moving out of high value luxury items to essential items as they know essential items are always in demand. But when it stabilizes even the stuff like smart phones, branded apparel will eventually make it back to Jumia platform. Good Luck all fellow longs. In 2025 let us meet again and check if our investment thesis is right and I believe it is right."
"Not many positive posts on the board… usually signals a bottom. As we approach earnings next week, we have seen brutal beat down since last report. Expectations are low going into earnings, a decent or good report should turn things around quick. These type of setups into earnings tend to surprise folks and we could see a big bounce. Not saying it will happen, but the setup is there…"
"Oh yeah, I forgot this was going to single digits! What ever!"
"Think people are being too harsh here. Started a position Friday close. why? Way more cash on balance sheet , smaller losses compared to a year ago, and it's interesting to see a expanded eco system and I assume a continuation of that with more pillers of the company being added. defiantly a buyer and believer here."
"People seemed to be worried about Jumia’s performance over the past 6 months as I am too. However, what has happened to the stock will be a mere blip on the chart and future of Jumia. If you believe in the growth opportunities Africa long term and forget about the day to day noise, read the Brookings report on Africa and affirmation of what the future holds. If you believe, you WILL be very wealthy if you stay the course w Jumia. If it goes down, I will buy more. I don’t believe that earnings will be all that great, but the report will state they are running more efficiently which is better to do sooner than later. My hope is Jumia will provide some color on what is happening on the ground and that they see the various economies in Africa are starting to grow. Enjoy the article and have a great weekend. https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/us-trade-and-investment-in-africa/"
Where are the single digit shorts?
"Unfortunately, I bought at 33. dummy me. Than after weiss jinxed any short term hope, I sold at 18 and took my losses and hope after 30 days it is under 10 to buy back in. I see nothing good over the next few months, however, as Jackxxx weiss said, it is a good company, a bad stock right now. I would look for 12 to buy in again."
"Just like I said before ER. I bought more. Easy. Think to your self. If you invest in a company, not at stock market, would you ask for profit two days later? One year later? 2 years later? No… business needs time."
Almost another -10% week !!!! -9.45% to be precise. Markets up 0.71 - 0.87% for the week ..... JMIA = NEGATIVE !!!! It's a picture of Beauty!! We'll have to order a double-wide to haul all the $coin we've earned on JMIA!
"What if jmia adds this q 0.5-1 mio users and next (blackfriday q) another 0.7-1.5 mio users… ?…and next year so on…for years to come…maybe even accelerating?So this would mean stock is now at absolute turning point…The infra / logistic was build up over 9 years.Its allways darkest b4 dawnBut the probabillity is - lets say higher than not, since they invest in growth."
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks.All you'd need to do is send Steve a messagewhats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR on Te** le* gram @ ( SteveFX01 )"
Jumia Pay registered a nice growth in Q2. Long term has very good potential.
"One should not forget, that cash and cash equivalents more than trippled yoy from (USD million) 195,734 to 637,655. Given the loss it means at least 10 more quarters to go until it could become economically critical, while also providing a lot of capacity to improve the business. From my point of view a very underestimated fact, when it comes to the general, healthy financial situation of JMIA."
Where is REDDIT when you need them. The shorts need to be shown where to go.
Jumia has only done 141million in revenue since the quarter ending in September 2020. Current market cap is just north of 1.8 billion. Currently trading at a 12.75 price to sales ratio. For a company with a negative net profit margin and weak revenue- Jumia is trading at around its fair value. $15 per share would be more appropriate
Get out ASAP. Shaky Infrastructure will not support this company. Look for 10 per share soon.
"Mpesa 50mln users , just saying"
"Once again, large buyer stepping up!"
"Same pattern as all other small cap growth and commodities. Only stocks doing well are huge tech. Instead of whining daily about price, turn the computer off and check in a couple months. It is not a jumia only event."
"1.8B Cap, 650M Cash, high revenue and growth, Covid E-commerce stock, buy the Dip"
"This whole “cash flow positive” and “fundamentals must be good” charade is getting very old even for a proficient short such as myself. In fact I covered every position because novice shorts think it is getting way too easy to make money and every small cap growth stocks will go to zero. We are seeing the opposite of the hat we saw in February. Bulls capitulating for losses, lots of panic while shorts are exuberant and believe high growth stocks will go to penny land.Going to scale long positions in next week into beat up growth names. $sdc$nndm$jmia$surf$root"
Great time to buy back in
In America they are working on a new Ecommerce that will give people free stuff with taxes for the people that work
They had some interesting insights about JMIA on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
And another large buy going thru now!
Jumia will be back to 30 by October. Don't sell below 30 HOLD!!

"A sea of red plagues the market today, nothing company specific to warrant this drop. Pass, check back tomorrow"
$JMIA Hedge funds are still latched onto JMIA shorting every uptick and killing investor confidence. These rotten practices have been going on for close to 4 decades. We have to stop the unlimited hedge fund shorting. At this point I wouldn't be surprised if every share has been shorted twice and they will not let this off the floor ever and will eventually sell every share 10 times until they can BK it so it can get bought and started all over again. Business will keep growing but will be strangled in a hedge Funs snake hold
Ignore short bashersMassive potential for jumiaThey build all up over 9 yearsJumia will soon explode to upside  Extremly undervalued !
JMIA to $30 in September easily!
"Hey, JMIA Longs --- how's your perianal holding up? I can call Dr. Procto if it has ripped. Stay greased ..... only $4/share to the downside to go! Enjoy the expensive ""ride"" .."
At 70$ it was going to go to the moon and everyone in africa was to shop online at some point. At 18 it is going Bk and africa is never going to develop.There is a reason retails are a bunch of amateurs. Time to start buying
"Will likely take 10 years to get to 30 again. Imagine being one of the wimps who bought at 60, 50, 40 or 30 "
Gettin ready to get ready!!!
Just backed up the truck!
There's the dead-mouse bounce we've been expecting .... trying to allow $17.50 calls to have some residual $value .... next week she heads to $16!!
Shortcovering ....
I keep talking about the large block buys showing up. Some of you are leaving way too early!
"Annual gross profit of Jumia from 2017 to 2020(in million euros)2017: 27.22018: 44.22019: 75.92020: 92.8Source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/1042987/annual-gross-profit-of-jumia/These numbers tell a consistent story. IMO longs should be quite comfortable with Jumia now at mere 2B market cap, its improving fundamentals and focus on growth, and > 600 million USB to execute its plans in the continent. It will be interesting with Brand Festivals now kicking in all the Jumia countries (with shipping sponsored by brands) and then Black Fridays down the line."
Let’s hope for a nice rise tom
"Long 5k shares, as of today."
"Odd. A 12$ stock with negative earnings and shrinking growth trading for nearly $20 on the hype, hope and promise that the hut dwellers of Africa will buy stuff online. Oddly enough, those poor uneducated people still need to develop electricity and indoor plumbing before worrying about ordering online."
"Since the Co-CEO bought 50K shares Monday, the other Co-CEO needs to step up and do the same and buy 50K shares. Show some solidarity and belief in your company!"
The BIG reward is years down the line for those who hold LONG.

Cramer says buy when everyone hates it.
Nice large blocks being bought once again!
"Back to $70 Q4 for 1 simple reason, if you listened to earning conference call, they now focus on Food because they seen the highest growth in this sector, they Focus on African Walmart/Costco now than Amazon…Etc, they also continue to grow on the credit cards and going to be mini bank with digital money wallet"
With a market cap of only 2 billion Jumia is a perfect candidate for buy out if amazon decides to expand in Africa.
See the liftoff. Still waiting for 15?
"One-on-one interview with Jumia CEO September 2https://www.cmlviz.com/stocks/JMIA/news/2021/09/02/jumia-jmia--one-on-one-with-the-ceoA year and a half ago, every order we delivered, we're losing money after logistics; the more we were growing the business, the more we were destroying it.Now, we’re in a place where we generate $1 of profit for every order after all the logistics, despite what people think is a nightmare of infrastructure in Africa.And that is a great foundation. We have a stronger balance sheet.And we believe it’s the right time to accelerate.And we only said we would do that last quarter, and we only started this quarter.And at the end of the day, we’re talking about opportunities that are not only e-commerce, but bringing an entire informal world of economy online.Africa will never fall off the map and Jumia is right in the middle of it. So, that’s our job, to do it right."
Strong support at $19 I think we can go to 24 by next week.

Over 4M shares traded today. I don't know if that is a good sign. This company needs to share a big improvement in revenue or the shorts are going to pounce on it.
Pattern continues as more large block buying just now!

Cramer says buy JMIA when everyone hates the stock…
"I'm long with over 100k in JMIA, but this earnings report is blah - don't understand why everyone has to pump or gloom, this is a long term play, the quarterly fluctuations are just that as they are trying to find their ground. They have had minimal growth and had hoped for more over the last 2 years, but there are so many factors at play, from COVID to infrastructure, that any commentary here is just inane. I am long because I think there's opportunity, but I recognize that there is a huge execution risk"

"And there it is again, some strong buy volume right on schedule!"
"It is a good ER. Jumia grew orders by 13% year-over-year, increased ad and promotions gradually toward 2019 level taking advantage of its cash position, and took concrete steps for off-platform use of JumiaPay in Egypt. Now Jumia has 7 quarters of positive gross profit. Still has $638 million cash to pursue its goals. The 13% growth of orders may look small but it has been only 3 months since Jumia said it will focus on growing faster."
Green is coming. Jmia at $60 sooner than we think.
Journey to black friday Jumia shares extremely undervalued

Jumia is so oversold at this level that I have my next buy order at $17.75 I don’t go more than 10% my total investment fund but this I may have to eke out a bit more.

Huge buys coming in from big banks. Jmia will be 800$ stock in 2025 same like MELI went from 8$ to 1550$

Great earnings! They change the buissnes to marketplace and when they are done revenue will skyrocket it's a 800$ stock
"Honestly, jumia drops 5% on any casual day, so at the end todays report was not that badly welcomed. I was expecting 20% drop on bad news."
I am not one to make predictions like this shorts  here Now i do oneIn the next 12 month user adoption to e comerce and other jumia services will accelerate dramticallyInflectionpoint / i just talked to a person in ghana ordering tv on jumiaStock will jump 10 fold

Looks like some big boys buying today for the long term.
Really hoping we can break that high of $22.15
Still waiting for 15$ ? 
There were promises of 15 today instead..well there are margin calls for the shorts.I already posted my recommendation to buy last week. Who followed it should be in profit.
Gotta love watching the MM liquidate 500k of their shares in the last 10 minutes to make sure this closed below $20 so options contracts expire worthless. 15% of total volume today in last 10 minutes. 40% of the shares traded today were synthetic.
