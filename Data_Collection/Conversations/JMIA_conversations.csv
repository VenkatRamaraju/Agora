Is this a real company?

Lets go jmia at $1000/share 5 years or more
Why the jump today ?
Added another 1000 at 17.3 and keeping hoping to add in low 16. Keeping cash on the side. Live long and prosper v.

Rocket ray after checking his short position: “jumia going to 10
40 s soon Black friday 
"Cap: 1.7BCash: 900MJumia, is not just e-commerce, it’s technology company, it’s Costco, it’s Grub, it’s UPS it’s everything"
"The latest Investor Place article is saying Jumia remains a buy : https://investorplace.com/2021/09/despite-missing-revenue-expectations-jmia-stock-remains-a-buy/Its takeaway is:""Remember, Jumia is not just an online e-commerce platform but a payment processor and logistics company as well. Alibaba has a market cap of $398 billion much larger than Jumia’s $1.86 billion market cap. If the company can achieve even a portion of its growth plans, JMIA stockholders would be very well off.""Amen to that. I would add two more positives. Jumia Advertising Service is shaping up well as the latest Jumia Blog article shows. For new growth global brands need Africa and Jumia has the data and local expertise. Also Jumia is not sitting on its 600+ million USD cash. As mentioned in Q2 ER, It is selectively turning on advertising and promotions, investing in tech, and the next phase of JumiaPay for off-platform use . That too should boost growth."
"October 19th 2021, put it on your calendars. I suspect the period of accumulation will end on or about that date and we will see a secular rebound in small to mid cap growth stocks. Don’t expect much news before than longs; this has been a targeted suppression by MM/HF since February after they were burned on GME and AMC. Nothing last forever patience is the key. You can’t beat the, so join them by accumulating and biding you time."
What made this company jump from $5 to $60?
Green is coming
"Jmia at $20, $50 then $100 next stop.Lets go"
Lol!!! Many people don't get what is the new Africa. Jmia is a rare opportunity. Im buying most i can and hold it for 10 years. $1000/share or more

Watch each day for the next week the 52 weak low is going to be higher. It started in the low 7's and will be in the teens by Oct 20th area.
@Clarissa is clueless period.I like to see Jmia a low price so I can get more shares. Holding jmia for 5 years. Let stay in this forum for 5 years and lets talk about by then.
"We believe the future of jumia is very dim. As dim as the light quality of its average customer in the mega cities it serves. We have added an additional 2000 shares Friday, so it looks better end of year for “tax loss harvest season”."

This article adds details helping us understand better:""In-app purchases increase 55% over 2020: Consumer spend fell by 50% at the start of the pandemic. However, as it became clear that consumers would need to adapt to digital methods of shopping, spending quickly recovered. Between April – May 2020 there was a 256% rise in overall spending in retail apps! Overall there was a 55% increase in consumer spending in apps in 2020.""Did the boost in online shopping fizzle out after last year's Black Friday and Christmas sales? No. The increased online spending carried through to 2021 :""Unsurprisingly, spending in 2020 peaked in November, coinciding with Black Friday and the lead-up to Christmas. As a result, between Q3 and Q4 there was a 60% uplift. This increase in spend has carried through to 2021. If we compare H1 2020 with H1 2021 we see a 65% increase in spending.""African ecommerce is turning the corner and becoming an everyday phenomenon.Another thing. @Zule posted 3 days ago in JUMIA WEEKLY NEWS that African telecom majors MTN, Vodacom, and Safaricom are are seeing a major boom in earnings.

"@Clarissa TS Amazon is a good example because most people are familiar with it. Why would I give an obscure example which no one heard of? Jumia is doing well in a much tougher environment than Amazon. But it has the cash and 7 consecutive quarters of growing gross profit as foundation for growth. Online retail is only 1% of African retail. So it has a massive ramp for growth. And read @zules's latest post - Jumia is by far the dominant ecommerce in Africa as per Statista's latest report. So I do not buy your ""sky is falling"" pretense. But hey, you have a lot to do. You are bashing half a dozen stocks daily. Get to work :)"

Im going to buy more slowly and hold. Jumia at this price is a gift.
"Many people just don't get this, Jumia is doing well in many levels. JMIA stock is down because of manipulation, a good upside correction soon or later."
Watching for potential entry.
The 52 week low is $10.18 today. Yesterday it showed $8.72 and the day before it was $7.99. The 52 week low will be in the teens next week. It is no longer the $4.00 range that some said they bought this at early last year.
Potential Triple Bottom??????
"@Clarissa TS earlier posted Vaxart was down $17 from earlier this year. This is a 72.4% drop using the Oct 13 closing price. Clarissa doesn't just troll Vaxart (look at her corpus of posts), she is a prolific basher across many company boards. Just tap her avatar.But, she actually is a long on one company: $JMIA. So, how has it performed according to the standard Clarissa set forth earlier today? It's down 72.6% from its one year high. So, by the standard Clarissa established and her bashing of Vaxart, how does she feel about her own long?I wonder if her fellow longs, co-owners, appreciate her behavior? An old saying: people in glass houses don't throw stones. Or, more appropriately for Clarissa, boulders."

This website can help you learn about Africa: http://themedicsclub.net/negative-african-stereotypes-do-african-live-on-trees/A excerpt for you: ""But for anyone who’s wondering, NO! Africans don’t typically live in huts and on trees. They mostly live in houses and apartments like the people in the other 6 continents. Yes, there are parts of some African countries where huts are still in existence and the media has not shied away from solely showcasing these as “today’s Africa” but it is not logical to generalize based on that alone. It’s like noticing the large numbers of homeless people on the streets of New York and Houston and then going ahead to portray the USA as a country of homeless individuals. """

"For the past 5 months I’ve been predicting JMIA would hover mostly around the $17-19ish range for about a year. I was right. Buying more Jumia in the 17’s and low-18’s would be a good idea right now, because the pandemic restrictions are already starting to go away. Expect more volume in the next 6 months. A year from now, JMIA will be hovering around the 20’s, and 2-3 years from now it may be in the hundreds. Internet penetration and logistical infrastructure in Africa is only increasing, and JMIA already has a foothold in Egypt, one of Africa’s healthiest economies."
"SaNR,-shrinking revenue -declining earnings-flat marketplace commission revenue -flat user growth You may talk about sales increase, switch to marketplace model, and the selling of every day items, yet none of it is showing in their earnings.

SaNR how come you never address hyperinflation in africa considering the sky rocketing commodity prices ? Or does that not matter for a jumia bull?

"A lot of posters here trying to tell us to sell so they can cover their short position and or to try and create a long position.So sorry, not selling, go away."
I want to break free.
"@Clarissa TS, no camels here in Florida so unfortunately I am unable to ride one :) Annoy Clarissa a bit and she instantly spouts racist slur. LOLSwitch to marketplace model and every day items have been a smart move. Why? Because it achieved Jumia's immediate goal of increasing gross profit.If you do not have gross profit then with every sale you are increasing your net loss.Some ecommerce companies do not care about it but Jumia does (read ER).Jumia now has 7 consecutive quarters of increasing gross profit after fulfillment.After achieving that this year Jumia said ""It is time now to grow faster"" (ER transcript).They have the fire power of $600+ million cash and the foundation (gross profit) to go for growth now.Partnerships are very important to build a continent-wide ecosystem and that is why we longs share such news. Longs are not saying ""Hey guys, buy Jumia TODAY because Apple/Nike/Hyundai set up official shop on Jumia.""You ,on the other hand, are daily predicting imminent doom of Jumia and a bunch of other stocks. For example, you posted 2 weeks ago: ""15$ this week. Sorry bulls. It’s clear as daylight"". That did not age well, did it? :) Any ""clear as daylight"" prediction for next week? LOL"

"If increased sales and number of orders are indeed a fact, then the stock price will go up. This board does have a few good posters supplying updates that support rising numbers."
Green as usual LOL
