Why the sudden move down further? The companies making strides to reduce burn. They have cash in the bank and even low debt. Just a painful stock to own at this point. Little movement. Little interest. Seems wise to $ cost down and hold to come back in a time.

"In the July 31 10-Q, on p. 3, it looks like there has been about $150 million dollars written off in 2020 in Goodwill and Other intangible assets. What I do not understand is that there is a current liability of $6.77 million for income taxes payable. There is also a deferred liability of $20.74 million for non-current income taxes payable. With roughly $150 million in losses from intangible assets, why is there any income tax liability?Also, even after these write downs, the balance sheet looks great with about $16 in tangible book value. With a current share price of around $10, MOV could double or triple once the pandemic is over."
