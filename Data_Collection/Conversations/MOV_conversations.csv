Hate to think what their stock would of done if they would of missed their numbers ! lol....
Im liking what Im seeing nice turnaround
"In the July 31 10-Q, on p. 3, it looks like there has been about $150 million dollars written off in 2020 in Goodwill and Other intangible assets. What I do not understand is that there is a current liability of $6.77 million for income taxes payable. There is also a deferred liability of $20.74 million for non-current income taxes payable. With roughly $150 million in losses from intangible assets, why is there any income tax liability?Also, even after these write downs, the balance sheet looks great with about $16 in tangible book value. With a current share price of around $10, MOV could double or triple once the pandemic is over."

This stock has tripled in price since November. Why is no one talking about it?
"Movado Sales Better Than Expected, Company Raises Annual Guidance."
Wow this is like watching paint dry but I think we tested the $9.60 lows. Seems to be inching up.
Is it a good time to buy?
Movado reached a 52 Week high at 23.25
Today is a great buying opportunity on an over done low volume sell off before earnings- love days like this.

I will always let anyone know to forget predictions and start making good profit now because future valuations are all speculations and guesses.The market is very unstable and you can't tell if it's going bearish or bullish.While myself and others are tradn without fear of making a loss others are being patient for the price to skyrocket. It all depends on the pattern you follow.I was able to make 17.54 bTC in just September from implementin tradess with tips and info from John Jirak…READ MORE
