Why the sudden move down further? The companies making strides to reduce burn. They have cash in the bank and even low debt. Just a painful stock to own at this point. Little movement. Little interest. Seems wise to $ cost down and hold to come back in a time.

"I think we put in the low. The stocks trading at 1x, which is crazy. I suspect a dividend will come back in time or maybe they just try to focus on the SP. Would be nice to see someInsider buying."

"In the July 31 10-Q, on p. 3, it looks like there has been about $150 million dollars written off in 2020 in Goodwill and Other intangible assets. What I do not understand is that there is a current liability of $6.77 million for income taxes payable. There is also a deferred liability of $20.74 million for non-current income taxes payable. With roughly $150 million in losses from intangible assets, why is there any income tax liability?Also, even after these write downs, the balance sheet looks great with about $16 in tangible book value. With a current share price of around $10, MOV could double or triple once the pandemic is over."

I'm not in this equity but CEO Grinberg is taking out $5.5 million a year in salary+He's Overpaid and He Under-Delivered. He's not giving back a cent as shareholders take the full hit for his excuses.
this is no risk the company has cash and the price is going around that 10.50 and 9.50 range no risk
