What is up with this stock. Down very day for last 2 weeks????
Does anyone know why the stock is down so big after hours?
Wonder why this is up 6% after hours? I have a coworker there in Finance and she wasn't sure why either.
Best investment in GREEN on the market. Dividends keep accumulating more green.
"No problem... I’m in for 5 years plus.... I do care about the share price, but in reality unless it goes to $150 a share, I’m not selling ...., and quite frankly￼ within reason could care less where the price goes...As long as it’s over my purchase price in five years when it’s time to sell I’m good..,, collect and drip"
"Has this been called?$25.33 down $1.11 on heavy volumeThis is the quote I'd expect if DUKH had been called, but I don't see anything in the news, on the company website, or SEC filings. Has this been called? Or if not, what's going on?"

"Huge loss, if you were in it for the dividend you just lost more than half of that, and closed on the low of the day. Typically in times of volatility investors move to utilities. If the market is going down and utilities are going with it then likely the market is correcting."
I don't understand the +4% drop in DUKH. This preferred I've had for years & it seldom drops that much with less than a month to the next div. I'm wondering if they plan to call it in. That would explain a $25 valuation.
"Why has this dropped 10% in such a short time? Is it headed back to $85 or $72? One could say inflation fears, but many other dividend stocks are still holding or going up nicely. And gold is dropping like inflation will never happen. It did seem that the duk announcement to cut rates on hurricane areas started this continuous dump. Mgmt probably thought that would maybe buy them love from the woke crowd, but it tanked the shareholders. Won't hurt them tho, they will just award themselves more shares to make up for the drop in stock price when bonus' come EOY. Does hurt the average duk employee shareholder tho."
"had it since 2011, before the reverse 3-1 split....I've seen it in around 65 dollar a share up to 104, I still love me some duke at any price...come on down to 65 or even 55 and I will scrape up every penny I can find to buy more! I love that dividend!"
The greatest company ever!
"Any thoughts as to why the utility sector, and DUK specifically is down today? Generally when the market drops the utility sector picks up as a safe haven."
"$ES $NEE $DUK $POR $ED $EIX $AGR $PPL all have the current ROE below of 8,7%. Does it mean what all these companies are SELL too?"

Just announced a dividend increase to $.98 per share. My records show that I received a dividend of $.985 the past year. This would be a DEcrease in dividends. Am I correct?
The Duke-ster has been berry berry good to me. It’s in a good spot right now.
"As the market starts to correct and people look for a safe haven for cash, this will only go up. Hold strong ladies and gentlemen."
"The yield isn't earth shattering, but, to me, it's a steady climber and I'm happy to have it in my dividend paying portfolio. I will definitely be increasing my position on this one!"
I am buying more at this price
