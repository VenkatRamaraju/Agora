"Heard the JPM is predicting a 4%, 10 year and that is what tanked ALL of the utilities today. While it is tough to watch my equity"
horrific price action.
Love those shares below $73 today. Thanks
Heading for a YEAR OVER YEAR LOW. Ouch
"90.40 base, i will buy 90.70 or less this week. Good luck to you all."
I know DUK will recover from its bad week. But I don't expect a fast recovery. Im looking at 3 months.
"I think I got in too early at $84.15. Oh well, stocks go up and down, so I’ll hold a little bit before averaging down. The pandemic is proof that utilities are solid investment."
"Picked up more shares under 89. Waiting to add one more chunk. largest holding, I will be sitting in this for a long time."
"After dec 31 it will toggle up, then level out and then drop a bit, Probably will get back into my ol' tried and true duke at the end of Jan."
"great earnings by duk,,,how is it this stock can not break the down trend and get north of 80"
What a gift. I just picked up 1800 shares.
"This is a little ridiculous. Yes I know all utilities are down; and yes I realize that demand may be down, because businesses are closed. But on the positive side, residential usage is up. Although not enough to fully compensate for the business demand loss, it does compensate for a large portion of it. Other positives, interest rates are way down, fuel cost is way down; and yet DUK drops 11% in less than a month. Generally when the market is down, investors will pile into utilities, because they are supposedly more secure. I realize that this market is messed up because of the pandemic and the global economy, but everyone still has to use gas and electric or some other alternative fuel. Just an observation!"
"PE, dividend payout, and EPS are all jacked up. Not buying this."
It's time for a split
Hit all time high at $99.89. Should I stay in or sell today? thumbs up stay/ thumbs down sell
There are some post divvy shorts out there. Most will cover by Wednesday.

"someone wanna tell me why Duke is dropping after yesterday's little rally? Dow is up +361, but Duke is dropping?!?!"
All time high at close today!!! Good going longs
Mid 80's Coming Soon !
"kind of funny this stock has ZERO to do with virus /unemployment numbers , It is hedge funds hoping Aunt Mary sells so they can buy on the cheap ..dance puppets dance ,they will sell millions of shares at a loss to get billions of shares at a profit ...think about it"
"Hi, I am thinking of investing in DUK/PRA (DUK-PA), but was informed that this cumulative preferred security is callable in 2025, at $25 per share. That gives me (you) a little over 3 years before this security is called. It originally paid a 5.75% coupon, and is still yielding over 5%. Purchasing it now would cost me $3 a share when it is called, which would be 2 years of interest. If my information is not correct, I would appreciate someone responding. Thank you."
"how good is this company? I want to invest in because of they are represented in the fossil energy and renewables at the same time. The dividendreturn is good, but my only question is: is the growth rate of the company enough? Are they ambitious enough?"
"Last week on a day D was rising more than DUK, I swapped out some D and started a position in DUK... glad I did that now.. /%^0"
Value stocks will be bought soon. 5% dividend stocks will rebound. Keep buying at these levels- the rewards are coming
Core holding IMHO. Big fan of the UTES. Retire early my friends. BTW use the drips. Cheers.
Watch for DUK to pull back toward the end of Feb. thru May !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Start buying when the dividend has reached 5.15% !!!!!! Best Regards
"We got a $10 bump from the NEE takeover rumor. When the rumor was dispelled, we stayed up here. Pleasantly surprised. Why? Maybe a signal to the market that the utility industry simply was being undervalued?"
"Going to get some Duke around mid Feb. I just retired and will start drawing the divy, I will leave the shares to the kid ...hopefully they will let it drip for 20 or so years then enjoy life with being a wage slave in the hamster wheel"
RIP Al Barker. You were a class act.
thanks for the dividend bump Duke! maybe that will de-incentivize the goons at Elliott management to run along somewhere else and try to fleece a different company
"I see elliot management is acting like the first-rate, second-rate firm that they are....Duke energy just sent out an open letter calling thrm out on the stunts they tried too pull...thank you board of directors and thank you Lynn Good.as to elliot management...stuff it, three different ways...deep, wide and continuously"
The Duke-ster has been berry berry good to me. It’s in a good spot right now.
This is a solid company. Glad I found it in the news. May open a position in the coming days.
The onset of electric vehicles mean MORE ELECTRICITY NEEDED.
"Bought a little DUK, PNW, OGE, EXC today. I like buying income..."
We want current conversations not 2 years down to 7 days ago? Why aren't they showing today's conversations??
"Duk cuts corners by improperly detensioning CR3 containment to make equipment repairs (after another plant had done is successfully by taking the right steps), and then has to shut down the plant, eliminate jobs, because the containment has started to delaminate. Guess who made that decision to cut corners. Guess who paid Duk to make imprudent project decisions? The ratepayers, yet their dividend is still safe? They are paying out $2.7 billion in divi each year. The system is propping up DUK's imprudent project decision making because there is vested interest in keeping the divi safe. It's high time the commission poses a serious question to utilities (along with the rest of the big corporations (GE, PG&E, Entergy., 737 MAX, etc......) regarding their project management as it is concerned with projects that can deal a death blow to large investments. The Project management system nowadays is driven by schedule and cost and prudent engineering decisions have fallen in third place. I have a real problem with passing through the costs that these imprudent project management decisions have made. The cost of CR3, coal ash, etc...should be shouldered by the company...not the ratepayer!"
$75.10 No way I was passing that up! Have another buy order for less if drops more. :) I bought a bunch of Raytheon at 103.22 yesterday! glt
I add a couple or three every time the div yield increases >4.25%..
"Just curious as to why the utility sector is down today. Generally, when the market dumps like this, investors pour into utility stocks."
duke will grow producing energy for all electric cars in their area
Is Duke expected to raise dividend this quarter?
No matter what’s the situation is: Energy and utility companies always make money. ￼Duke has Lots more improvements going from 2021 to 2030. Stable long term stock with Good dividend. Seeing over $100 in couple month and at least above $200 by 2025
Duke dividened... even through the Great Depression....a gift that keeps on giving...gotta love Duke!
"Just a little article snippet.""Duke Energy customers that haven’t been able to pay their bill because of the pandemic, are running out to come up with a plan.Duke Energy customers started receiving letters Monday, warning that if they don’t start paying, they could have power disconnected as early as Sept. 3"""
Just as Michael P predicted.....78+ shines on the horizon.....
"Whatever happened to all that money that Duke raised last November, from issuing new shares of stock to pay for the pipeline? It looks like they recently cancelled the construction of the pipeline, so where is that money? I think they diluted existing shares when they issued the new shares. Is that money gone now?"
why is the EPS listed as $3.04 but if I add up the last 4 quarters earning (from chart on right of summary page) I get over $4?
"Bank of America all of a sudden puts a BUY rating on Duke These wall street scams are getting old,,, drop the stock down from 90 to 72 then cover then short and now at 76 its a BUY,,, these crooks should be in jail for the actions they do,,"
just bought a few @90.92..... fwd div yield works for me..
"Raised divy, good earnings coming and with a market pullback coming, should see new highs soon enough."
"Not affected by tariffs, benefits from low energy prices, good dividend, a great stock to buy and own long term."
"Really nice run up from September in the low 80's to mid 90's right now, great job Duke, wish I had more shares, but 5-10 at a time is all I can afford!! cheers"
Everybody keeps wanting electricity and my shares keep earning dividends. The big investments into green energy infrastructure should add value going forward. Seems like a good value stock to me.
Did you notice the press coverage indicated NEE was securing financing for the deal. Doesn’t that suggest they will return to DUK with a new offer? $130/share isn’t out of the question for a premier utility like DUK.
"New shares bought today yield only 3.6%. Not so good for a utility. But, you can’t find a CD paying this rate."
Any idea why the utility sector continues to get hit. DUK down 3% in 8 days.
I’d sell this one
"the dividend is $623 million a quarter or $2,45 billion a year they pay out,,,they will be bankrupt soon,,"
Why on God's green earth would it take 20+ minutes to get through on the phone to a Customer Service Rep? There is no good reason. Just fix it or it will be a BIG issue at the shareholders meeting.
"Well, today REITS were hot, UTES not.. no prob I have both worlds covered and divs regardless..."
This totally irrational
"I asked this before recently, but did not get an answer and have not found anything on the internet about it. Whatever happened to all that money that Duke raised last November, from issuing new shares of stock to pay for the pipeline? It looks like they recently cancelled the construction of the pipeline, so where is that money? I think they diluted existing shares when they issued the new shares. Is that money gone now?"
"whats amazing is the Najarian boys and fast money said this was a SELL and look how fast it dropped,,,the control they all have at the top"
utilities have a built in monopoly ability to raise rates affecting the financial well being of the elderly many of whom never had access or assistance in financial planning for retirement like public utility employees do at the expense of their customers. Service is supposed to assist others not fleece them. Any govt related entity regulated has the same mindset as govt ...the public has to pay the price.
finally a turn around for utility stocks?
Coal ash spill must not be that severe or this would have dropped like a rock. When the news came out Friday I took a flier on some $75 puts and it never dropped.
Dukes service area is growing like crazy so they grow and buy out other utilites. guess who will fuel the electric autos and trucks in their service area
"Hottest summer in decades and DUK down 3% in 6 days, on no news that I can find."
"So what's wrong with this picture, YTD shareholders see a 12% loss in stock value, a 17% reduction in 6 months, yet in March of this year Lynn Good gets a 55% increase in compensation."
"2 yrs ago the ANA: l ysts told me the same thing Dont buy this at 80 its not a growth stock.. No, it replaced my PEPCO stock that got bought out & was producung an Excellent 4,+ divi... Then Everyone wanted into this stock & it ran up to 95 or so.. Now with Tax kiss selling and other uncertainties about coal ash Liabilities it has run back down to 87.. Let it run back to 80 again I will be in this After Xmas if it does.. You guys can keep wishing that the anlysts are right , hoever if you dont have CALL optionsd you'll be on the outside looking in again"
duk is not publicly going to battle against this takeover rumor. That may mean they are quietly walking through a lot of math with the people of NEE to see if there is a number that makes both sides happy.
Believe we closed at all time high today! Correct me if wrong! Go DUkE lonnnnng
"10 YR interest rates.......Rates have been in a slight upward trend of late which raises cost of capital on loans. Utilities are heavy borrowers to fund projects. This is but one variable that affects price of utility stocks. I've owned DUK for over 40 years (as an employee for 26 yrs and now as a recent retiree). This usually translates to a short term negative effect unless rates take off like a rocket due to governmental over spending, lack of confidence in the dollar, political crisis, etc. OR, just a little natural run of the mill correction. It has been on a tear lately."
"Sad as it is, based on the past 52 weeks, DUK is the best of the major competitors. The whole sector continues to go down. Sure glad we have low interest rates! Always thought that was supposed to help utilities."
Dec 1st $88
"It's a race to see who can lose more, in the shortest period of time GE or DUK? YTD, DUK down $9.00, GE down $6.00. One year, GE down $15.00,DUK down $12.00."
I might add a few if we reach a 4% fwd div yield..

No worries. DUK will be setting new highs and Bigger dividends. Core holding IMHOGLTA
Where are the current conversations? No one wants to know what happened 3 or 2 months ago. No help from these reactions.
"Wow guys I have to say this stock chat has to be the most well mannered group of individuals I have seen on Yahoo finance, even when you disagree you do it with class. This to me is a reflection of the seasoned intellectual investors that put their money in DUK. I'm happy to join you guys."
I think in 2008 crash Progress was selling for about book value and around 8% yield. Things get cheap and can get cheaper. I might get in if yield gets to 5% plus.
I would love to see a stock split. Two or three to one which would propel this stock much higher by bringing in new investors at a lower and more affordable price.
"Sooo since elliot management bought in at high price, how long will it be before they want a dividend cut because the snails pace of utility sector is not fast enough for them? Run along Elliott, go find some weed stocks to exploit"
Adjusted 1.03 eps meets expectations.
Can someone explain how the payout ratio is 223% and continues to be high? Are they financing the dividend? Doesn't look sustainable to me........
Wish I could Buy some more.. at this price!
any concerns about all these coal ash pits and potential lawsuits?
"Duke, Duke, Duke! Bucking the market trend as a safer haven with a nice divy."
Another great opportunity to buy. The value play will return
And here we go again..... an awesome up day on the DOW and DUK down as usual. I will take solace in the fact that I can't recall Duke ever cutting their dividends so I get more divis per quarter
"great we get the dividend but the stock is now 74.50,,,so the div is not good,,,,win on div lose on stock price,,hope for rally now"
Let's limbo....how low can you go!
Nobody wants to know current conversations. We want to know what happened one year ago or two years ago. Nothing current
The greatest company ever!
"I bought progress in last downturn, dividend went above 7%, sold before aquisition. I am no expert, but I think duke is basically a dividend payer and I value it at about $67 at that price I would hope to get a 6% return. The current price has a high growth rate in it which I don't see, but maybe they will come through."

"The real EV story is not the cars nor the batteries but who will recharge them. I am betting on the electric utilities to be the ""big oil corporations"" of the future."
I’m still bullish on this stock and a believer in this company but does anyone know what is causing these short term headwinds?
I don't understand the +4% drop in DUKH. This preferred I've had for years & it seldom drops that much with less than a month to the next div. I'm wondering if they plan to call it in. That would explain a $25 valuation.
"what day does DUK buy stock based on the DRIP program,,,that will tell me when the stock jumps up,, was it the other day when we went from 80.25 to 83 and then back down again"
"up almost 50% since march! yeah, baby!"
Nextera wants to buy Duke! Duke undervalued.
I am looking to buy around 70
5 year chart says bottom may not be until $66-67. So why add now?
"If DUK is below 90, it's a buy all day; 85 is a super buy, and 80 and below is a must-buy. This stock prints money."
"Just saw this!Duke Energy Keeps Quarterly Dividend Steady at $0.945 per Share, Pay Date March 16 For Shareholders on Feb. 14BY MT Newswires— 2:59 PM ET 01/03/2020"
Congrats to anyone that sold above $107. Appears all that happened was that a fund bought some DUK. Would seem that is no reason for the stock to have popped and current price action is bearing that out.
"If nee walked, great! Duk will be just fine as is, thank you."
"go Duke,looking ahead"
"Wow, 4.29% drop in one day on a utility stock? What is the new news?"
Great Day
Buy Duke hand over fist when the dividend yield is 5.15% !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
does anyone know that the 18 million shares that the company offered have to be held for so long... If not then DUKE screwed everyone with that deal as they all made money except the shareholder....i cant find any information on it
Duke is only stock up in my portfolio of 21 companies!
Don't investors generally buy into utilities in a down market?
Interest rates will go up in December and Duke will dive before it goes back to $90. Sold at $89 back in $85 and change.
I will be adding under $79 today.
68+ today. All Index fund selling as people are cashing out of their funds.
Premarket & aftermarket traders still trying to manipulate trading prices in electric utilities .. hang on .. electric utilities will be heading up soon.. enjoy the dividend
"I Always Buy when Duke is under $90, and when it's in the Lower $80's I Load Up..!"
i have been raking in this dividend for over 10 years. i see no reason to change now. i will keep holding and collecting
"Recently etired investor (72) fairly new to the game but learned a lot over the last two years. Looking at DUK, I like the dividend and the current PPS looks good value. The investment in renewables and what I can gather of the overall social philosophy both look like an intelligently run company but it's about the cash ain't it. What say you folks who have held a position in DUK for a few years at least? Is it a good buy in utilities?"
"OMG, a UTILITY stock that loses 10% in a month when the stock market is dealing with uncertainty? Who is driving this thing anyway? This is pitiful."
Someone here mentioned DUK reduced their dividend...so is it 4.8% still?

Duke just bought another solar farm on Georgia
Increase in dividend will be announced this Thursday . What amount do you think they will raise it to?????
if it goes down it's a Buying opportunity.. Teslas * all the EV. vehicles got to have it as well as everyone who is now @ home...
"So, if earnings are generally considered more important than revenue, and DUK beat the earnings consensus, why are we down 1.25%?"

What do you guys think about the debt?I just took a position but the debt is enormous....
Should have sold mine right before d of the year when it hit $89

Interest rate fears are way overdone. JPM said this morning that they expect the yield on the 10 year bond to be significantly lower by the end of the year than it is now.
Joestradamus predicts... all time price highs continue into ex-div in Aug....
Starting the climb into (most likely) a good earnings. This has been held back with uncertainty and possible shorts. I see this moving higher into Feb 11 and more.
"When Duke Energy hits a all-time high, you can be guaranteed your portfolio will be a near time low."
"whats running DUKE,, interest rates rise Utilities usually always fall back,,,interesting how its running,,,anyone know why"
I believe this takeover will happen Duke is holding out for a much higher offer!
did anyone get their dividend that is usually paid in late december ?
What is the difference between DUK and DUKH?
"Just an opinion, and I realize the overall market is getting crushed. I've said this before, generally utility stocks are a safe have during a market downturn. Generally when interest rates drop, utility stocks soar. So why is the utility sector down 23% in a month? Why is this market any different than past downturns? Corona virus or not, the customer base for this commodity remains the same."
Question: does Duke Energy produce and install scrubber technology as found on cap seize vessels (ticker ship look at that board for details)?. If yes then Duk has a huge potential!
I have not read the earnings reportBut we all should have known that Its a Slow down ever where because of the Virus Yes Duke will do fine But not right away Perhaps a year or so Its rise in stock price was just getting ahead of Duke recovery and the US recovery Just my opinion
One article below says NEE offered $65B for DUK. But DUK's market is $68B this morning. Does anyone have more info about the PRICE?
Wondering why in a one year time frame DUK has fallen 10.9% while the utility sector as a whole has only dropped 4.7% ?
"It seems to be useless to put a comment in on Duke. I put one comment in today, 7/7/21 and cannot find it anywhere?? Only comments are from 2 days to 8 years from today. Nothing showing for anything current?????"

Get ready for Air Conditioners to run 24/7 on full blast for the next 10 days. Electric meters will be spinning.......Duke will go Bank. :-)
"The future is bright for DUK. They have Invested 5 billion in solar energy and 4 billion in wind energy . So those saying this is going to $60 obviously doesn’t know the bright future this company has with renewable energy. I own NEE, XEL and DUK because the future is renewable energy. I will keep adding to this stock. It’s now my 3rd largest holding behind MSFT and APD"

Utilities out of favor for now. All the money is going into the high flyers. DUK just crossed below the 50 SMA and formed a head and shoulders pattern. Both short term bearish indicators. We could pull back to the lower 80's. A good buy point.

The reason more people are missing Utility bills is because they have been waitin 9 weeks to get their first unemployment check.....an Epic State Government Failure.
"Be happy to see a up tick on this stock, one of my favorites, still interest is good."
"I asked previously why is it that DUK was 91.38 on Nov 15, 2017 and now its 10 points lower. The drop seems to have been quite sudden back one year ago. As a new investor that is picking this 4% dividend up as a place to park cash I ponder as to what caused the sudden drop. Interest rates didn't jump up in November 2017 did they? At least not enough to cause a 12% drop in DUK price. My hope or expectation is that DUK is at minimum ""range bound"" at 80 - 83. If so it is a far better place to park money than most bonds or CD's. When one buys a dividend the hope is that the principle doesn't erode offsetting the dividend."

im liking Duke at 82! My concern is they will ask for another rate hike but costs are down. They can do repairs and maintenance now. My big concern is people not able to pay their bills but Govt may step in.
any chance we will see a stock split any time soon?
"Debt level is very high, cash flow is very thin, dividend is too generous for the cash flow siatuation"
DOW up big..... and Duke Energy is down. This is so predictable. I may become a day trader just because of Duke Energy.
"Just saw a good piece by Morningstar dated June 11, ""Duke Deserves a Princely Valuation"" Yahoo has it posted today, 14h ago. Very positive."
"MIKE. Has anyone considered the coal ash problem and the delays of the Atlantic pipeline as reasons for the recent drop in share price. These 2 things affect revenues im a big way, and D missed revenues in latest earnings report. It will continue for a while, and present a buying opportunity."
"The last split was a reverse, and when will the opposite take place?? It's about time to do a one for three split. Price is right and the time seems right. A lower price would bring in new investors immediately, which means a higher price."
Added at $75.80
"Yahoo just doesn't let my message go through about this opinion. You all should know if you hold this stock! Companies are not allowed to wright off dividends as an expense, then you pay taxes on dividends you receive. This is DOUBLE Taxation and it IS wrong! Tell you Senators and representatives your opinion."
Hope to see break $90 today!
The stock should move north of 85 by the end of summer. Tech stocks selling off and the sellers are looking for a safe haven....or maybe something less volatile.
"And of course whenDuke is the highest you've ever seen it, almost, our portfolios are getting hammered. GREAT HEDGE STOCK."
"Seeing Duke is around many wind turbines and in hurricane winds. My question is do they shut down the turbines, or keep them going. What winds is max go keep them in place"
Why are utilities all down today? Makes no sense with interest rates collapsing
Is this stock good for a new investor?
$100 share will be nice
"Regardless of the Coronavirus, people still have to use gas and electric; so why is the utility sector down?"
"The rise in interest rates affect utility stocks negatively as well as bond investments. This process will take years, not months.Holding DUK for the long-term and enjoying the dividends.Buy low and sell high, but don't try to catch a falling knife.Keep durations short for now."
Best investment in GREEN on the market. Dividends keep accumulating more green.
"why would anyone now want to buy DUK with a max price of $75 locked into play here,,, no one will buy the stock anymore,,"
"So the the Florida Public Service Commission will be reviewing the Duke request to recover storm related costs from Irma. I hope they turn it down or take a hard line on Duke's request to recover storm damage costs from customers. Duke is a for profit business and has a very solid balance sheet, EPS each year that increase and yet wants consumers to take all the risk. Maybe I don't understand how Utility Companies work but we've wasted billions on Nuke plants that never started up and or the permit process and each time the consumer is asked to pay the tab. In a hurricane prone area one of the risks of doing business is storm damage. Why don't they take profits and put a larger percentage aside for these costs? If you rubber stamp this maybe it's time to take a serious look at the PSC and what role you play. Do some research on DUK as a publicly traded company and see how you justify this added cost to its customers. With almost a 25% EBIT performance how justified is it to pass damage costs to consumers? Are other companies allowed to do this in such a direct manner? This seems to be a situation whereas the utilities are subsidized by the consumer, have no downside risk and then pay shareholders profits/returns via dividends. One option would be to cut the dividend from the people that can afford rather than to spread the cost to a lot of fixed income people who cannot afford it."
"OK, what just happened to cause a pop? Colonial Pipeline news?"
"So, we have a 21% drop in 5 months. Not seeing why COVID would affect a utility that much. Low interest rates should have provided a positive move upward. What happened?"
"Duke Energy Corporation ( DUK ), Moving Average bull crossover, rated buy."
Interest rates at lowest ever. A utility sectors dream; and yet DUK is down 33% in less than a month. There is NO logical rationale for this!
"A question for knowledgable DUK shareholders or observers:Is DUK planning to be in the Electric Vehicle battery business?This statement was made by the CEO of Workhorse Inc. during a conference call in reference to Duke Energy:""And finally, the Duke alliance, which we could spend a lot of time on that I'd like to talk about because it's so important to our profitability path, really enables us to, I'll say, lessen our BOM cost to our company, right, by Work -- I'm sorry, by Duke actually acquiring the components or the batteries themselves. They will continue to own the pack. We'll build the truck, put that battery pack in it. We'll keep the revenue from the sales price of the truck but will reduce our BOM cost by the amount of the battery cost upfront.""Again: the WKHS CEO states that Duke will be the buyer/owner of batteries installed in Electric Trucks built by Workhorse.Is this true?"
"Go away Next era, this isnt Dominion and you're not warren buffett. Duke prides itself on the dividend"
Over 5 year highs... selling 55% of my holding of DUK. I can wait and see if it pulls back to 85ish again.
Any news on reactor start up dates?
I picked up 1200 shares of Duke today. Very pleased with this price. :-)
"5.10.21. Somebody was buying with both fists, today, sending briefly above 107. Why? Because it is going higher."
Look people I'm not calling a bottom price here I'm saying buy when the yield is 5.15% !!!!
"Bought back in at $79.28 (market at close) I am a trader, planning for profits with and including stop losses – got stopped at $100 on 2/25/2020.From my stand point yesterday’s buyback increased my dividend income by over 25% with no additional capital and certainly better than T-Bills or MMF. On any further dips plan on adding more for a 10% position in my Income and Growth portfolio.My due diligence closed about 95% of my trading portfolio in February into bonds as recession talks started to come up again.IMHO, this correction is almost over, now that this administration is considering imposing futures and option restrictions on short and naked-short trades with hefty fines – which helped start this sell off. This may be another way to help fund new citizen checks scheduled next month, Just the Facts on the current hype - decide and act accordingly:According to the CDC, the flu remains a higher threat to U.S. public health than the new coronavirus.a. April 2009 the Swine Flu pandemic hit the US. Per the CDC with an estimated 60,900,000 cases, 173,304 hospitalized and 12,469 deaths in the US alone. b.

Long and Happy Investing!"
"Beats EPs and revenue estimates, stock down 1.51%. And I thought earnings meant something …"
"Duke is one of my favorite companies,but it seems some idiot group is forever investgating or sueing them.it raises rates to keep paying lawyers for the sorry groups causing trouble. you can't create energy with out making a little mess"
Why hasn't there been a stock split? Stock split means more investors and a growing utility. Maybe they should return the last stock split? Maybe a two for one?
You can go to sleep with this stock and not worry about much of anything.
"$648,000 in stockholder money to promote diversity. What's the matter? Can't people fill out job applications and post resumes without a babysitter?"
"Duke shutdown it’s old coal plant yesterday , on gas in Asheville now!"
"up, down, up down, I like duk when its 55 bucks a share or 97...I dont get bent out of shape trying to over think a strategy with current economic conditions and duk...I sit back, enjoy the ride and take the dividends."
Up $13.58 from this date last year.
Why is the utility sector getting beat up so bad lately?
"I held for the dividend, my account take a beating but, DUK will bounce back. Added a few more."
Duke energy has no growth in an entire year with this stock it's a shame because from 9275 back to 80 now on its way down to the mid-70s again what a joke this company is
"I like the stability and stock < 90 seems a decent buy... Not a lot of cash, but i'll buy 5 shares here and there, hoping to accumulate 200+ into Duke over the next 5 years, guess we'll see how it goes, cheers!!"
"This stock is down because it is a pure rotation in tech and the retail herd following for quick money. This is a long term stock for stable earnings and growing dividends. And as far as other utilities, its about the analyst pushing the stock of a company they are interested in. Like Sempra stock (SRE) has penalties coming related to one of its utility and the analyst don't care they keep pushing the stock, including Cramer!"
Any reason this is popping after hours?
"As the market starts to correct and people look for a safe haven for cash, this will only go up. Hold strong ladies and gentlemen."
"The media states DUK wants customers to pay for a nuclear power plant that the construction for was initiated and abandoned in the 80's, and the unfinished structures/land was bought, sold, bought back...whatnot. If the media had to pay a reasonable amount for printing unsubstantiated accusations, none of us would have to pay taxes."
"Huge loss, if you were in it for the dividend you just lost more than half of that, and closed on the low of the day. Typically in times of volatility investors move to utilities. If the market is going down and utilities are going with it then likely the market is correcting."
"Could this be the causation for this ridiculous drop again today?Analyst Actions: Wells Fargo Lowers Duke Energy's Price Target to $96 From $100, Maintains Market Perform RatingBY MT Newswires— 9:47 AM ET 11/11/2019"
"Analyst Actions: Morgan Stanley Adjusts Duke Energy's Price Target to $101 from $99, Keeps Equalweight Rating BY MT Newswires— 10:28 AM ET 03/19/2021"
DUK will be back over $81.00 next week.
"Anyone have any idea why this thing is at a 4 month low, and dropping?"
"Congratulations to Duke, they have the highest paid CEO in utilities. Hope she can write a new contract keeping her salary with a respectful 15% raise this time , feeling sorry she needs a new wardrobe to keep up her image"
"Reason duk is down and so ,d and exc are up is repositioning,selling one utility and buying another,Today the sellers willing to take less and moving on to another utility. any other ideas ??????????????????//"
DUK moves in mysterious ways. Have owned on and off over a number of years and still don't quite understand the chart. For a utility it's fairly volatile. Investment banks seem to be driving it higher. When do they pull the rug?
Dukes stock is on sale and will pop with earnings. Train will leave station soon.
"Nice rebound this morning, even with a down market today!"
Time for a split. Two for one or three for one? When is going to happen??
"well, seems SA article of singers-elliot woes with DUK won't be met . . . they really want to break DUK up . . . cramer luvs paul. me, I ain't so impressed . . . keep it together DUK, glta"
You buys these stocks for dividends. Ride the roller coaster and hold.
I've held duk about 30years and about 14 mo's back added some ppl the two are great income plus growth. this will be good to leave my children. Have a great Christmas and don't forget its Jesus birthday the real thing !
Just curious as to where today's buyers think the price is going. Seems fully valued here. Just sayin..
"Anyone know why the utility sector is getting hit so hard today. Generally as a defensive stock, when the market goes down, utility stocks go up."
As General markets dropped 1 %. Duk gains 1 %. This is a Solid company.
Today was big traders day run in run up run out and most of us sit here thinking what happen?
"Duke is fine. All these big utilities (AEP, Southern and Con Ed) are all hitting or close to their 52 week lows. Interest rates heading upward send these all downward. Investors take their money out of utilities and put them in bonds."
"Analyst Actions: Zacks Investment Research Raises Price Target for Duke Energy to $96 From $76, Maintains Neutral RatingBY MT Newswires— 1:41 PM ET 04/13/2020"
I have had duke for a number of years. I intend to keep it because duke seems to be leading the energy field into the future. I think duke is good for another ten years. I an certainly long on duke. I also think when duke hits a stable 100 it will split and possibly 3 for 1.
"Glad to see Next Era running along somewhere else! Maybe Next Era can go find something left over from Dominion. I hold Duke for the dividend stream, price can go to 55 bucks a share for all I care. It will just DRIP more. I will take .965 a share all day long. Folks, if you're real greedy or or looking for a fast buck, stay away from Duke, very seldom will you be impressed. However if you want something that plods along with a decent return every quarter, well sit back, relax and enjoy the ride."
Buy all the DUK that you can at $71.33 !!!!!!!!
"I agree with ""Lawrence"". That reverse split really hurt any chance of the stock advancing in value. Most buyers will not pay such a high price for stock. Two for one split would be good for all of the stock owners."
Buy Duke this is an amazing value... It will rebound and give nice dividends.
This thing is all over the place today!
"Don't let today full you. For the past two years, every time there's a huge pull back in the DOW, day traders flock to utilities. Check the history of the Dow and look at how many times there's been a huge up day and Duke is down"
will this stock ever hold and run without falling everytime it starts running
Buying under $78.
"After watching the action on Duke, it looks like a bottom is near. 5% dividend- it’s like a bond, but better returns."
DOW looks to be down huge tomorrow. Could be a big day for DUKE ENERGY.
Bought some $100 June puts. Looking to make some on the downside and then add to my long position.
"My first position in $DUK. Got in today at 79.06 and 79.13, hope it will hold above this level. I am planning to hold long-term. How long have you been invested in this stock?"
A lot of people in the C-suite at DUK bought a bunch of stock over the last few days.See the latest Form 4s. That is some serious money that these folks are putting into DUKhttps://www.duke-energy.com/our-company/investors/financials
Too bad ceo doesn’t have time to make $ for stock holders ! She s full time activist !
"Big DUK climbing toward a 52wk and all time high, with a div-ex coming up next month...."
Can you picture a Duke Energy charge station replacing thousands of gas stations in the next 20 years. A solar panel on top of each station. This stock should be selling at $120.
what news created the surge in utility stocks today?
What was the offer? I’d say give me $130/share and you can have it.
"Price may not be appreciating that much, but they DO raise the dividend every year, by a very respectable amount, especially for a utility. I'm keeping my shares and may buy more on the next market correction."
"No problem... I’m in for 5 years plus.... I do care about the share price, but in reality unless it goes to $150 a share, I’m not selling ...., and quite frankly￼ within reason could care less where the price goes...As long as it’s over my purchase price in five years when it’s time to sell I’m good..,, collect and drip"
"Today was an yuuuuuuuuuuuuuge up day for Ford $F, $JPM, $VLO, $DUK, $ETR (mmm smell that? fossil fuels,... I love the smell of CO2 in the morning) and a bunch of other normal profitable, non-hyped up baseless EV's that run on fossil fuels/""tech"" money losing stocks.Let's look at the chart and see how much they were up today,.. shall we?"
Duke ole boy will surely love you for it. Didn’t see 102. Remarkable. Strong play.
One way to get a significant monetary influx.https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/duke-energy-partners-with-gic-to-secure-minority-investment-in-duke-energy-indiana-increases-long-term-eps-growth-rate
"Duke has a debt of 5 million in O and M. They have cut everything. They cut out service award dinners. They cut out tools, and all sorts of stuff. Customer service etc. I'm just saying."
I own both DUK and NEE. I think DUK will win in short term but NEE will eventually own part of DUK's sections.
"Just announced ... DUK's new ""Solar Program"" - with a 60 cents per ""watt"" rebate ?Really(?), huh?, 60 cents per ""watt"" ?? ... say WATT ?? :~)Or ... how about a ""60 cents"" per KILO-WATT 'rebate'(?) ... even that sound like too much of a rebate.OK, one watt = '1 watt', and ONE ""kilo-watt""(1KW) = 1,000 watts You're billed on your electric meter by 'kilo-watt hours' = KWHI don't think I would want to DEPEND on solar for everything .. too many ""catches"" in these SOLAR 'contracts' ..not to leave out the 'Battery Banks' & the (sensitive) electronic relays (etc) in a dedicate room, which can be wiped out with ""1 flash"" of a EMP .. Plus the number of 'cloudy days' per month (yada yada yada :-) ... (Not sure if the writer really has ""Watt"" vs ""Kilo-Watt"" facts correct ?) ... But go ahead .. it's 60% on DUK's $$'s and 40% on yours :~)"
is this a good time to get some shares of duk?
"Duke will raise dividend for next quarter , thinking about 4% increase, your opinion please."
Looks like a good add at this $81 level.
"CHARLOTTE, N.C. – Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) today announced second-quarter 2021reported EPS of $0.96, prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), and adjusted EPS of $1.15. This is compared to a reported loss per share of $(1.13)and adjusted EPS of $1.08 for the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted EPS excludes the impact of certain items that are included in reported EPS. The difference between the second-quarter 2021 reported and adjusted EPS is due to workplace and workforce realignment costs and exit obligations from gas pipeline investments.Higher second-quarter 2021 adjusted results were led by growth in Electric Utilities and Infrastructure from rate case contributions, higher volumes and higher wholesale earnings. These items were partially offset by higher O&M expenses, lower Commercial Renewables earnings, the loss of ACP earnings and share dilution.“Our strong second-quarter results demonstrate the continued execution of our clean energy strategy,” said Lynn Good, Duke Energy chair, president and chief executive officer. “We recently passed 10,000 MW of renewable energy on our path to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. We’re investing in our transmission and distribution assets to strengthen grid resiliency, accommodate more renewables and support state economic development efforts. And, we’re collaborating with stakeholders and policymakers to advance supportive energy policy. We expect 2021 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $5.00 to $5.30 and expect to grow earnings 5% to 7% through 2025, based off the $5.15 midpoint."
"it""s not the individual shareholders that cause wide fluxuations in market prices. click on '' holders '' to see who the owners really are. their programs are computerized to buy and sell. if share prices go up a dollar they sell. if it goes down they buy."
"I must have missed something in the Utilities section. All the utility sticks are down big time, SO, DUK , ED, SEP, ETC. Anyone know something?"
"Well, looks like the market didn't like Duke's magnanimous ""we are totally woke"" 750K grants announcement."
"duk will be fine, no reason to overreact. it will see 78 within the month"
"Duke now has 550 acres of solar panels , clean renewable energy. My question is the many hurricanes that might go over this area, how trust worthy are they on 120+ mph winds ? I’ve asked this question when this project began, but no response"
DUK should have already announced next dividend.
Slowing economy/ fed will hold rates/ utilities will soar
"Lordy, DUK the top gainer in my 70 stock early retired IRA ports today- a ute rules..."
it's coming back a little
"wow,,,interest rates rise and duk is up,,,,i thought as interest rate rises utilities drop,,,"
"So the coronavirus affects the utility sector how? Generally, if there is a market downturn don't investors generally invest in the utility sector because of dividends and safety?"
anyone care to venture a guess at the next dividend increase? .985?
Whenwill we see a positive news story on any stock
"no way this stock is a buy here, $25 over valued"
"Has this been called?$25.33 down $1.11 on heavy volumeThis is the quote I'd expect if DUKH had been called, but I don't see anything in the news, on the company website, or SEC filings. Has this been called? Or if not, what's going on?"
Alexandra's post is not relevant to DUK
