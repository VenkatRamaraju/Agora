"Really nice run up from September in the low 80's to mid 90's right now, great job Duke, wish I had more shares, but 5-10 at a time is all I can afford!! cheers"

"Recently etired investor (72) fairly new to the game but learned a lot over the last two years. Looking at DUK, I like the dividend and the current PPS looks good value. The investment in renewables and what I can gather of the overall social philosophy both look like an intelligently run company but it's about the cash ain't it. What say you folks who have held a position in DUK for a few years at least? Is it a good buy in utilities?"
I will be adding under $79 today.
FLIGHT TO SAFETY!Always good to diversify.
Adjusted 1.03 eps meets expectations.
"It's a race to see who can lose more, in the shortest period of time GE or DUK? YTD, DUK down $9.00, GE down $6.00. One year, GE down $15.00,DUK down $12.00."
"great earnings by duk,,,how is it this stock can not break the down trend and get north of 80"
Utilities out of favor for now. All the money is going into the high flyers. DUK just crossed below the 50 SMA and formed a head and shoulders pattern. Both short term bearish indicators. We could pull back to the lower 80's. A good buy point.
but Duke has more solar panels and windmills than Dominion but they are out performing us.....i just dont understand it
Hit all time high at $99.89. Should I stay in or sell today? thumbs up stay/ thumbs down sell
I know some companies are opening up on Monday and expect business usage will rise.
"15% correction with this utility already......and most every other utility as well. Seems to be tracking the increase in the Ten Year treasury which is up about 10%. Will be interesting to see if the group starts to diverge from any further meaningful increases in the 10 year treasury. That divergence, if it occurs, might suggest that we are pretty close to fair value......."
"whats running DUKE,, interest rates rise Utilities usually always fall back,,,interesting how its running,,,anyone know why"

"$ES $NEE $DUK $POR $ED $EIX $AGR $PPL all have the current ROE below of 8,7%. Does it mean what all these companies are SELL too?"
Duke is only stock up in my portfolio of 21 companies!
"Duke now has 550 acres of solar panels , clean renewable energy. My question is the many hurricanes that might go over this area, how trust worthy are they on 120+ mph winds ? I’ve asked this question when this project began, but no response"
Hope to see break $90 today!
I know DUK will recover from its bad week. But I don't expect a fast recovery. Im looking at 3 months.
I bought more today 
As General markets dropped 1 %. Duk gains 1 %. This is a Solid company.

"MIKE. Has anyone considered the coal ash problem and the delays of the Atlantic pipeline as reasons for the recent drop in share price. These 2 things affect revenues im a big way, and D missed revenues in latest earnings report. It will continue for a while, and present a buying opportunity."
You buys these stocks for dividends. Ride the roller coaster and hold.
"Bought a little DUK, PNW, OGE, EXC today. I like buying income..."
The Duke-ster has been berry berry good to me. It’s in a good spot right now.
Just as Michael P predicted.....78+ shines on the horizon.....
"I think I got in too early at $84.15. Oh well, stocks go up and down, so I’ll hold a little bit before averaging down. The pandemic is proof that utilities are solid investment."
"This stock is down because it is a pure rotation in tech and the retail herd following for quick money. This is a long term stock for stable earnings and growing dividends. And as far as other utilities, its about the analyst pushing the stock of a company they are interested in. Like Sempra stock (SRE) has penalties coming related to one of its utility and the analyst don't care they keep pushing the stock, including Cramer!"
The greatest company ever!

Just curious as to where today's buyers think the price is going. Seems fully valued here. Just sayin..
did anyone get their dividend that is usually paid in late december ?
"kind of funny this stock has ZERO to do with virus /unemployment numbers , It is hedge funds hoping Aunt Mary sells so they can buy on the cheap ..dance puppets dance ,they will sell millions of shares at a loss to get billions of shares at a profit ...think about it"
Everybody keeps wanting electricity and my shares keep earning dividends. The big investments into green energy infrastructure should add value going forward. Seems like a good value stock to me.
"I must have missed something in the Utilities section. All the utility sticks are down big time, SO, DUK , ED, SEP, ETC. Anyone know something?"
"So the coronavirus affects the utility sector how? Generally, if there is a market downturn don't investors generally invest in the utility sector because of dividends and safety?"
Why on God's green earth would it take 20+ minutes to get through on the phone to a Customer Service Rep? There is no good reason. Just fix it or it will be a BIG issue at the shareholders meeting.
"Very long time holder, great stock just drip divy and don’t really have to worry about much"
"wow,,,interest rates rise and duk is up,,,,i thought as interest rate rises utilities drop,,,"
"Large coal ash lake flooded spills in nc river,how much will that cost us ?"
"This is a little ridiculous. Yes I know all utilities are down; and yes I realize that demand may be down, because businesses are closed. But on the positive side, residential usage is up. Although not enough to fully compensate for the business demand loss, it does compensate for a large portion of it. Other positives, interest rates are way down, fuel cost is way down; and yet DUK drops 11% in less than a month. Generally when the market is down, investors will pile into utilities, because they are supposedly more secure. I realize that this market is messed up because of the pandemic and the global economy, but everyone still has to use gas and electric or some other alternative fuel. Just an observation!"

Duke dividened... even through the Great Depression....a gift that keeps on giving...gotta love Duke!
For what its worth!https://news.duke-energy.com/releases/duke-energy-named-one-of-fortunes-worlds-most-admired-companies-for-fourth-consecutive-year
Coal ash spill must not be that severe or this would have dropped like a rock. When the news came out Friday I took a flier on some $75 puts and it never dropped.
Added at $75.80
"Hottest summer in decades and DUK down 3% in 6 days, on no news that I can find."
"Duke will raise dividend for next quarter , thinking about 4% increase, your opinion please."
"Just an opinion, and I realize the overall market is getting crushed. I've said this before, generally utility stocks are a safe have during a market downturn. Generally when interest rates drop, utility stocks soar. So why is the utility sector down 23% in a month? Why is this market any different than past downturns? Corona virus or not, the customer base for this commodity remains the same."
One article below says NEE offered $65B for DUK. But DUK's market is $68B this morning. Does anyone have more info about the PRICE?
Heading for a YEAR OVER YEAR LOW. Ouch
is this a good time to get some shares of duk?
"As the market starts to correct and people look for a safe haven for cash, this will only go up. Hold strong ladies and gentlemen."
"If DUK is below 90, it's a buy all day; 85 is a super buy, and 80 and below is a must-buy. This stock prints money."
"The rise in interest rates affect utility stocks negatively as well as bond investments. This process will take years, not months.Holding DUK for the long-term and enjoying the dividends.Buy low and sell high, but don't try to catch a falling knife.Keep durations short for now."
"Duke, Duke, Duke! Bucking the market trend as a safer haven with a nice divy."
I’m still bullish on this stock and a believer in this company but does anyone know what is causing these short term headwinds?
Looks like a good add at this $81 level.
"I agree with ""Lawrence"". That reverse split really hurt any chance of the stock advancing in value. Most buyers will not pay such a high price for stock. Two for one split would be good for all of the stock owners."
"So, we have a 21% drop in 5 months. Not seeing why COVID would affect a utility that much. Low interest rates should have provided a positive move upward. What happened?"
Starting the climb into (most likely) a good earnings. This has been held back with uncertainty and possible shorts. I see this moving higher into Feb 11 and more.
I don't understand the +4% drop in DUKH. This preferred I've had for years & it seldom drops that much with less than a month to the next div. I'm wondering if they plan to call it in. That would explain a $25 valuation.
I am buying more at this price
I've held duk about 30years and about 14 mo's back added some ppl the two are great income plus growth. this will be good to leave my children. Have a great Christmas and don't forget its Jesus birthday the real thing !
"Has this been called?$25.33 down $1.11 on heavy volumeThis is the quote I'd expect if DUKH had been called, but I don't see anything in the news, on the company website, or SEC filings. Has this been called? Or if not, what's going on?"
The stock should move north of 85 by the end of summer. Tech stocks selling off and the sellers are looking for a safe haven....or maybe something less volatile.
"Closed at all time high, passing the $100 price!!!"
"The real EV story is not the cars nor the batteries but who will recharge them. I am betting on the electric utilities to be the ""big oil corporations"" of the future."
Dukes stock is on sale and will pop with earnings. Train will leave station soon.
"So what's wrong with this picture, YTD shareholders see a 12% loss in stock value, a 17% reduction in 6 months, yet in March of this year Lynn Good gets a 55% increase in compensation."
"So, if earnings are generally considered more important than revenue, and DUK beat the earnings consensus, why are we down 1.25%?"
"Picked up more shares under 89. Waiting to add one more chunk. largest holding, I will be sitting in this for a long time."
"Wow guys I have to say this stock chat has to be the most well mannered group of individuals I have seen on Yahoo finance, even when you disagree you do it with class. This to me is a reflection of the seasoned intellectual investors that put their money in DUK. I'm happy to join you guys."
Why is the utility sector getting beat up so bad lately?
Is this stock good for a new investor?
"I asked previously why is it that DUK was 91.38 on Nov 15, 2017 and now its 10 points lower. The drop seems to have been quite sudden back one year ago. As a new investor that is picking this 4% dividend up as a place to park cash I ponder as to what caused the sudden drop. Interest rates didn't jump up in November 2017 did they? At least not enough to cause a 12% drop in DUK price. My hope or expectation is that DUK is at minimum ""range bound"" at 80 - 83. If so it is a far better place to park money than most bonds or CD's. When one buys a dividend the hope is that the principle doesn't erode offsetting the dividend."
"No problem... I’m in for 5 years plus.... I do care about the share price, but in reality unless it goes to $150 a share, I’m not selling ...., and quite frankly￼ within reason could care less where the price goes...As long as it’s over my purchase price in five years when it’s time to sell I’m good..,, collect and drip"
It's time for a split
I picked up 1200 shares of Duke today. Very pleased with this price. :-)
Any news on reactor start up dates?
i have been raking in this dividend for over 10 years. i see no reason to change now. i will keep holding and collecting
Just announced increase in dividend to $.945 per quarter

Berlin Wall comes down in 1989.America puts man on moon in 1969DUKE ENERGY STOCK HITS $100 IN 2021.
Is Duke expected to raise dividend this quarter?
"had it since 2011, before the reverse 3-1 split....I've seen it in around 65 dollar a share up to 104, I still love me some duke at any price...come on down to 65 or even 55 and I will scrape up every penny I can find to buy more! I love that dividend!"
Wondering why in a one year time frame DUK has fallen 10.9% while the utility sector as a whole has only dropped 4.7% ?
I add a couple or three every time the div yield increases >4.25%..
I believe this takeover will happen Duke is holding out for a much higher offer!
"Don't let today full you. For the past two years, every time there's a huge pull back in the DOW, day traders flock to utilities. Check the history of the Dow and look at how many times there's been a huge up day and Duke is down"
"Huge loss, if you were in it for the dividend you just lost more than half of that, and closed on the low of the day. Typically in times of volatility investors move to utilities. If the market is going down and utilities are going with it then likely the market is correcting."
"Duke Energy Corporation ( DUK ), Moving Average bull crossover, rated buy."
"Just a little article snippet.""Duke Energy customers that haven’t been able to pay their bill because of the pandemic, are running out to come up with a plan.Duke Energy customers started receiving letters Monday, warning that if they don’t start paying, they could have power disconnected as early as Sept. 3"""
im liking Duke at 82! My concern is they will ask for another rate hike but costs are down. They can do repairs and maintenance now. My big concern is people not able to pay their bills but Govt may step in.
What is up with this stock. Down very day for last 2 weeks????
Just announced a dividend increase to $.98 per share. My records show that I received a dividend of $.985 the past year. This would be a DEcrease in dividends. Am I correct?
"Yahoo just doesn't let my message go through about this opinion. You all should know if you hold this stock! Companies are not allowed to wright off dividends as an expense, then you pay taxes on dividends you receive. This is DOUBLE Taxation and it IS wrong! Tell you Senators and representatives your opinion."
Very weak of late. Guess it’s headed to $90 soon
"Beats EPs and revenue estimates, stock down 1.51%. And I thought earnings meant something …"
"Bought back in at $79.28 (market at close) I am a trader, planning for profits with and including stop losses – got stopped at $100 on 2/25/2020.From my stand point yesterday’s buyback increased my dividend income by over 25% with no additional capital and certainly better than T-Bills or MMF. On any further dips plan on adding more for a 10% position in my Income and Growth portfolio.My due diligence closed about 95% of my trading portfolio in February into bonds as recession talks started to come up again.IMHO, this correction is almost over, now that this administration is considering imposing futures and option restrictions on short and naked-short trades with hefty fines – which helped start this sell off.

What a gift. I just picked up 1800 shares.
"My first position in $DUK. Got in today at 79.06 and 79.13, hope it will hold above this level. I am planning to hold long-term. How long have you been invested in this stock?"
"I bought progress in last downturn, dividend went above 7%, sold before aquisition. I am no expert, but I think duke is basically a dividend payer and I value it at about $67 at that price I would hope to get a 6% return. The current price has a high growth rate in it which I don't see, but maybe they will come through."
"Glad to see Next Era running along somewhere else! Maybe Next Era can go find something left over from Dominion. I hold Duke for the dividend stream, price can go to 55 bucks a share for all I care. It will just DRIP more. I will take .965 a share all day long. Folks, if you're real greedy or or looking for a fast buck, stay away from Duke, very seldom will you be impressed. However if you want something that plods along with a decent return every quarter, well sit back, relax and enjoy the ride."
Why hasn't there been a stock split? Stock split means more investors and a growing utility. Maybe they should return the last stock split? Maybe a two for one?
"$648,000 in stockholder money to promote diversity. What's the matter? Can't people fill out job applications and post resumes without a babysitter?"
I have had duke for a number of years. I intend to keep it because duke seems to be leading the energy field into the future. I think duke is good for another ten years. I an certainly long on duke. I also think when duke hits a stable 100 it will split and possibly 3 for 1.
A lot of people in the C-suite at DUK bought a bunch of stock over the last few days.See the latest Form 4s. That is some serious money that these folks are putting into DUKhttps://www.duke-energy.com/our-company/investors/financials
"Price may not be appreciating that much, but they DO raise the dividend every year, by a very respectable amount, especially for a utility. I'm keeping my shares and may buy more on the next market correction."
"The last split was a reverse, and when will the opposite take place?? It's about time to do a one for three split. Price is right and the time seems right. A lower price would bring in new investors immediately, which means a higher price."
"Duke Energy Florida to invest in EV charging stations as part of clean energy plan, and raise ratesPublished: Jan. 15, 2021 at 1:45 p.m. ET. EV charging stations are being put throughout Fl. EV play at its grass roots."
Can you picture a Duke Energy charge station replacing thousands of gas stations in the next 20 years. A solar panel on top of each station. This stock should be selling at $120.
Supplier of electric vehicle power for the next century.
No matter what’s the situation is: Energy and utility companies always make money. ￼Duke has Lots more improvements going from 2021 to 2030. Stable long term stock with Good dividend. Seeing over $100 in couple month and at least above $200 by 2025
"Sooo since elliot management bought in at high price, how long will it be before they want a dividend cut because the snails pace of utility sector is not fast enough for them? Run along Elliott, go find some weed stocks to exploit"
The announcement of the sale of 2.5 Million Dollars in additional stock dilutes your value about 3%
"I Always Buy when Duke is under $90, and when it's in the Lower $80's I Load Up..!"
"I can see the price but what is the value here. I bought over a year ago at $75 for a 5% yield. Didn’t expect a 33% capital gain but I’ll take it. Q 4 had down revenues and a loss yet stock goes up making yield go down. How do you longs see this going. Hold for steady divi increase or bail at year end if cap gains rates don’t change (or my income is low enough to not change it). Every time I sell a stock to lock in a gain, I think now what the hell do I buy to replace it. Opinions welcome."
"duk will be fine, no reason to overreact. it will see 78 within the month"
The onset of electric vehicles mean MORE ELECTRICITY NEEDED.
"I see elliot management is acting like the first-rate, second-rate firm that they are....Duke energy just sent out an open letter calling thrm out on the stunts they tried too pull...thank you board of directors and thank you Lynn Good.as to elliot management...stuff it, three different ways...deep, wide and continuously"
"Not affected by tariffs, benefits from low energy prices, good dividend, a great stock to buy and own long term."
"Something I'm not familiar with on a takeover.IF IT HAPPENS.NEE Dividend is under 2%.If this deal happened, would that mean everything would be under NEE and our dividend with also be under 2%?"

When will DUK declare their next dividend?
"Duke shutdown it’s old coal plant yesterday , on gas in Asheville now!"
No worries. DUK will be setting new highs and Bigger dividends. Core holding IMHOGLTA
"And of course whenDuke is the highest you've ever seen it, almost, our portfolios are getting hammered. GREAT HEDGE STOCK."
"I can't believe this is down because of a .25% hike in interest. Ordinarily utilities are defensive stocks, that go up or hold when the market is down."
it's coming back a little
"Hi, I am thinking of investing in DUK/PRA (DUK-PA), but was informed that this cumulative preferred security is callable in 2025, at $25 per share. That gives me (you) a little over 3 years before this security is called. It originally paid a 5.75% coupon, and is still yielding over 5%. Purchasing it now would cost me $3 a share when it is called, which would be 2 years of interest. If my information is not correct, I would appreciate someone responding. Thank you."
Believe we closed at all time high today! Correct me if wrong! Go DUkE lonnnnng
"Utilities are being hammered due to rotation into riskier assets. Be patient, and if possible buy additional shares"
"Why has this dropped 10% in such a short time? Is it headed back to $85 or $72? One could say inflation fears, but many other dividend stocks are still holding or going up nicely. And gold is dropping like inflation will never happen. It did seem that the duk announcement to cut rates on hurricane areas started this continuous dump. Mgmt probably thought that would maybe buy them love from the woke crowd, but it tanked the shareholders. Won't hurt them tho, they will just award themselves more shares to make up for the drop in stock price when bonus' come EOY. Does hurt the average duk employee shareholder tho."
"Seeing Duke is around many wind turbines and in hurricane winds. My question is do they shut down the turbines, or keep them going. What winds is max go keep them in place"
Wonder why this is up 6% after hours? I have a coworker there in Finance and she wasn't sure why either.
just bought a few @90.92..... fwd div yield works for me..
Why are utilities all down today? Makes no sense with interest rates collapsing
Interest rates at lowest ever. A utility sectors dream; and yet DUK is down 33% in less than a month. There is NO logical rationale for this!
"After watching the action on Duke, it looks like a bottom is near. 5% dividend- it’s like a bond, but better returns."
"Going to get some Duke around mid Feb. I just retired and will start drawing the divy, I will leave the shares to the kid ...hopefully they will let it drip for 20 or so years then enjoy life with being a wage slave in the hamster wheel"
What was the offer? I’d say give me $130/share and you can have it.
"New shares bought today yield only 3.6%. Not so good for a utility. But, you can’t find a CD paying this rate."
"Any thoughts as to why the utility sector, and DUK specifically is down today? Generally when the market drops the utility sector picks up as a safe haven."
"Talk about a serious knee jerk reaction; beats earnings and revenues, and goes down over 3% on speculated future metrics. This is pure homogenized BS.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/duke-energy-duk-beats-q3-130501826.html"
In at 52. 00 loving it
"Anyone have any idea why this thing is at a 4 month low, and dropping?"
The reason more people are missing Utility bills is because they have been waitin 9 weeks to get their first unemployment check.....an Epic State Government Failure.
Does anyone know why the stock is down so big after hours?
What do you guys think about the debt?I just took a position but the debt is enormous....
duk is not publicly going to battle against this takeover rumor. That may mean they are quietly walking through a lot of math with the people of NEE to see if there is a number that makes both sides happy.
