"Went to Las Vegas last week and visited Main Street, California and Fremont. 777 at Main Street was great, beer is excellent. Buffet was lame and way over priced. Played some at California and Fremont also, but did not eat. Should have eaten at Tony Romas instead of gastronomical affront that is the Heart Attack Grill. Fun concept, but the burger was absolutely abysmal. Good crowds all over Fremont Street. Vegas is definitely coming back."

"Many Boyd Gaming employees are on the chopping blockBy Erik Gibbs06/01/2020calvinayre.com/2020/06/02/casino/many-boyd-gaming-employees-are-on-the-chopping-block/Like every other company that operates inside the gambling bubble, Boyd Gaming is suffering because of the coronavirus pandemic. It recently reported that its first-quarter figures were well below previous expectations, with the casino operator seeing a net loss of $18.3 million – a year earlier, it had a profit of $45.5 million. While land-based gambling losses were slightly offset by Boyd’s online initiatives, these weren’t enough to cover the entire deficit, and the continued casino outage in the US is chipping away at the company’s foundation. Despite some states allowing their casinos to come back online, the recovery process is going to be long and arduous, and Boyd isn’t convinced it will emerge unscathed. It has announced that it will need to let a number of employees go, and some properties could lose as much as 60% of their workforce.At the end of last week, Boyd announced that it was ready to get the familiar sights and sounds going again at 13 of its properties – nine of which are in Las Vegas. The other four are found in Missouri and Iowa. Las Vegas is expected to begin to see casino action this Thursday, although those plans will more than likely be altered due to the ongoing riots and protests following the death of George Floyd while being arrested by police. Nevertheless, Boyd is anxious to get things going. The relaunch will be too little too late for many company employees, though. Boyd sent a letter to some of its employees this week (which is just slightly better than leaving a voicemail) to inform them that it is going to be forced to permanently get rid of “between 25 percent and 60 percent” of employees. The rest of the employees, those fortunate enough to be selected to continue, will more than likely stay on furlough for at least six months more. The letter is reportedly dated May 22, and a copy was also sent to labor officials in Nevada. The company explains that the layoffs are necessary due to the “mandatory closures, guest limitations imposed by various regulatory authorities, and overall economic conditions” resulting from the current pandemic. Employees can expect to start receiving their pink slips anywhere from July 1 to July 14, and there may be more than 10,300 workers who will receive their notice. Boyd VP of Corporate Communications David Strow sent an email to Casino.org to help explain the situation, as well. He indicated that the company strives to be as “transparent as possible” and added, “There continues to be uncertainty surrounding opening dates for some of our properties across the country that have been closed since mid-March. In addition, it is very difficult to predict what business levels will look like as we reopen our properties, and how long it will take for business to recover to normal levels.”Boyd still expects to have 21 of its 29 properties operational within the next week, according to a previous statement at the end of last week from its president and CEO, Keith Smith."
Fun Fact: Online sports betting plays have cooled off recently. But there is one stock that is leveraging it’s actual casinos to fend off the gaming pullback: Boyd Gaming.YTD Growth$BYD: 31.48%$DKNG: 23.91%$CHDN: 14.38%$PENN: 14.08% $CZR: 10.66%$WYNN: 8.96%$LVS $GAN
AND their quarterly report is coming out on the 26th of this month... Even in this climate right now they've beaten expectations can you imagine what it would be like if there was no limitations COVID has gone away which it will eventually... people should be buying this like $0.05 apples
"BYD stock price back up with much more travel, much more eating out, much more football coming"
so boyd is trading now when most of the casinos are closed about 60% higher then it was a year ago pre covid when all the casinos were open!! makes sense...

BYD has run in parallel with PENN until PENN’s announcement with Barstool. BYD will have better 4Q 2019 earnings than PENN IMO. With better earnings BYD should be +$36 after earnings. If there was a positive surprise at earnings possibly more....of course IMO.
let's go BYD! I BOUGHT IN TO BEST! ev busses ev forklifts ev battery's best in chena firsure my 2nd best ev play!
Great earnings!!
Perhaps the reasoning behind the PPS drop after such a good track record in the past four quarters is in the transcript from the CC. My read was that there will be a share buy back and no reinstatement of dividend. Reward investors by reinstating the dividend using a portion of the beat and that would reinforce the shareholder mindset that the company actually cares about its shareholders.

"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"
