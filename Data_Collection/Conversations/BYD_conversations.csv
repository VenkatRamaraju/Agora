All the Boyd Casinos in Las Vegas has the WORST blackjack games!
some epic confirmation for you of $BYD and $IDEX possible huge future partnership with WAVE!
"Be careful, I personally witnessed BYD screw a person out of $300. Most Scandilous thing I have ever seen a casino do. Table Max $1000. Guy bets and wins $1300. BYD pays only $1000 cause it was table max, but was approved by a pit boss. They are straight sketch, his 2 buddies heard the pit boss say we rake whatever or only pay out $1000 cause that the max. I will be selling tomorrow after these shady practices witnessed. I was betting $15 a hand and this guy was betting whatever until he won. It was very sad and poorly handled by the casino. He was from out of town and I live here and will never go back. It was sad to see the house acknowledge and then welch on $300. Boyds will do it! Be careful big gamblers!"

"#BYD #D1 officially enters market, price at ¥ 151.8K (post-subsidy), previously the #EV was only sold to #Didi for its ride-hailing operations, #China media reports. Installed capacity at 400/day."
on line gaming has limited appeal. sports books make a small percent of profits. it could get bigger slowly.
Do we really need a casino? Kids these days gamble more then enough on stocks
Any thoughts on after hours share price increase tonight?
If the Zacks average price target is $81 (too conservative) I’ll take it. $85 by EOY tho.
why is no one on this board???
Right on! Added more yesterday...

Boyd Gaming is up 5.76% to 58.91
"Due to the continued closure of all revenue-generating operations, Boyd Gaming will place most of its team members on unpaid furlough effective Saturday, April 11. For furloughed team members enrolled in the Company's health care plans, Boyd Gaming will pay all insurance premiums through June 30 or their return to work, whichever is sooner. A limited number of essential team members will remain on payroll during the closure period.""This is by far the most difficult decision we have ever made,"" said Keith Smith, President and Chief Executive Officer of Boyd Gaming. ""We care deeply about the well-being of our team members, which is why we maintained full pay and benefits through April 10. Implementing furloughs was a last resort for us, but a necessary step to protect our Company, especially given the current lack of visibility regarding property re-openings.""The Company also announced that its executive leadership team will be taking significant salary reductions, while the Company's Board of Directors has agreed to suspend the Board's compensation. Additionally, all non-furloughed members of the Company's corporate and property management teams will take a salary cut.Additional cost-containment measures taken by the Company include:Following a thorough review of the Company's expenses, all non-essential spending has been postponed indefinitely.All capital projects have been suspended and will be re-evaluated by the Board of Directors.As previously announced, the Company's cash dividend program has also been suspended.""As a result of these difficult but necessary actions, we are confident Boyd Gaming will have sufficient liquidity and resources to sustain itself until we are able to re-open for business,"" Smith said. ""We will continue to carefully review our operations and expenditures during the closure period and make additional adjustments as necessary."""
Boyd Gaming is up 4.96% to 54.20
"Many Boyd Gaming employees are on the chopping blockBy Erik Gibbs06/01/2020calvinayre.com/2020/06/02/casino/many-boyd-gaming-employees-are-on-the-chopping-block/Like every other company that operates inside the gambling bubble, Boyd Gaming is suffering because of the coronavirus pandemic. It recently reported that its first-quarter figures were well below previous expectations, with the casino operator seeing a net loss of $18.3 million – a year earlier, it had a profit of $45.5 million. While land-based gambling losses were slightly offset by Boyd’s online initiatives, these weren’t enough to cover the entire deficit, and the continued casino outage in the US is chipping away at the company’s foundation. Despite some states allowing their casinos to come back online, the recovery process is going to be long and arduous, and Boyd isn’t convinced it will emerge unscathed. It has announced that it will need to let a number of employees go, and some properties could lose as much as 60% of their workforce.At the end of last week, Boyd announced that it was ready to get the familiar sights and sounds going again at 13 of its properties – nine of which are in Las Vegas. The other four are found in Missouri and Iowa. Las Vegas is expected to begin to see casino action this Thursday, although those plans will more than likely be altered due to the ongoing riots and protests following the death of George Floyd while being arrested by police. Nevertheless, Boyd is anxious to get things going. The relaunch will be too little too late for many company employees, though. Boyd sent a letter to some of its employees this week (which is just slightly better than leaving a voicemail) to inform them that it is going to be forced to permanently get rid of “between 25 percent and 60 percent” of employees. The rest of the employees, those fortunate enough to be selected to continue, will more than likely stay on furlough for at least six months more. The letter is reportedly dated May 22, and a copy was also sent to labor officials in Nevada. The company explains that the layoffs are necessary due to the “mandatory closures, guest limitations imposed by various regulatory authorities, and overall economic conditions” resulting from the current pandemic. Employees can expect to start receiving their pink slips anywhere from July 1 to July 14, and there may be more than 10,300 workers who will receive their notice. Boyd VP of Corporate Communications David Strow sent an email to Casino.org to help explain the situation, as well. He indicated that the company strives to be as “transparent as possible” and added, “There continues to be uncertainty surrounding opening dates for some of our properties across the country that have been closed since mid-March. In addition, it is very difficult to predict what business levels will look like as we reopen our properties, and how long it will take for business to recover to normal levels.”Boyd still expects to have 21 of its 29 properties operational within the next week, according to a previous statement at the end of last week from its president and CEO, Keith Smith."
Owned since last May. Earnings is generally when their is profit taking especially on low volume. Wait for it to hit a 10/20/50 day MA or the channel it’s followed the entire year then buy deep in the money calls. Rinse and repeat when it hits the channel top.
What are the chances of BYD merging with PENN? They would dominate the sports betting market in th U.S.
byd doesn't own>>>>> resorts world. but has resort fee's. the only way they save money keep main street closed no buffets. wow how people are making comments on the wrong china byd. I doubt byd makes much money off it's shuttles. in a way byd sorta like bob stupak old vegas world smoke & mirrors. maybe byd can stage a fire at the vacant mainstreet & collect $$$$. Byd riding the coat tails of resorts world opening
50 buy spring solid
CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY BYD STOCK WOULD WORTH MORE THAN LVS ? ANY ADVICE ?
BYD is up 4.90% to 35.09
revenge gambling is coming soon to your local casino. Good luck.
I think we we will see single digits as more regional properties are forced to close and / or they close some in Vegas.
Rumor is Boyd might buy Boston Harbor property from Wynn!!!
"Ohio will be next. My biggest concern less people will travel to Las Vegas once every state gets sports betting. Boyd owns casino near me but no hotel. What going to hurt the industry is I read less foreign travel to the United States. That will definitely hurt Boyd in Las Vegas. There are some articles that gaming revenue in Las Vegas is down. Probably due to fact all states have casinos now. The only thing is sure more people will drive a shorter distance to gamble but they will not stay at casino hotels due to the resort fees. For example, because Las Vegas has resort fees sometime hire then the price of hotel room less people will travel to Las Vegas. Sure people will visit their local casino but will not spend the night in the hotel. If Boyd was smart they would drop the resort fees and offer rooms at a lower price. The reasoning is if a married couple was spending the night in the hotel they would be more inclined to game more and probably eat on two different times at casino. Too much gaming revenue is being lost due to resort fees. More and more people go to a casino about on average 3 hours then drive home."
"I’m thinking of selling all my $1.20 shares and buy $BYD. At least it’s already trading OTC, it won’t get delisted anymore. Thoughts?"
All casino’s in Nevada will close at midnight March 18.

"While I am very bullish with Nio, I can say BYD is the only other Chinese EV brand to buy. It's the only sustainable Chinese EV maker. Li and Xpeng will be blown out of the dust. Kandi is actually nothing in the equation. $BYD is for stability and $NIO for big potential growth."
Should drop back to $30
Great earnings beat and the price drops ???
Two companies that I believe will benefit from legal sports gaming are BYD and NWGI.

Any news on BYD buying gaming routes in Nevada from GDEN?
so boyd is trading now when most of the casinos are closed about 60% higher then it was a year ago pre covid when all the casinos were open!! makes sense...
"Waiting to purchase gaming stocks, thing they've got another 10 to 15% to go before bottom is reached. Largest issue is which operators will try BK. Betting CZR (ERI purchase isn't going to happen now) and RRR. BYD, WYNN AND LVS are going to recover. Look at real estate as well, so.e good bargains to be had by weeks end."
I like the gaming industry but I feel like I can get it at a large discount if I'm patient. thoughts?

"Regarding additional research to be published to support, understand, make better investment decisions the for PRC EV sector including $TSLA $NIO $XPEV $LI $BYD - A reasonable guess is a lot of major IB research support should come out in January 2021 after the announcement of sales for Dec 2020. Certainly there are no guarantee they publish or even a time, but it would seem natural to support one of the more exciting sectors globally and in the PRC. The research should be quite constructive and help make better and/or more informed investment decisions.The banks which may publish and were involved in the recent capital raisings for $NIO $XPEV $LI are (in alphabetical order): BofA, CICC, Citigroup, CS, GS, JPM, MS and UBS)Anyway, make your own decisions and good luck."

"I was thinking of buy 750 shares for the long haul, good idea. I also like IRBT. My best buy in five years VKTX, 1.46 last year, 12.74 Firday + 1.21. This is a drug company, endocirne medicine playing in the huge NASH space. If interested I would go to their site, do some reading, read all the PR and Analyst rec's and decide for yourself. Speculation abounds about their PII NASH study and the valuation comparisons to MDGL. There is speculation that Pfizer, Gilead and BMS are interested in the companines and working very hard to provide treatments, where there are NONE now for NASH, better known as fatty liver disease. VKTX also has an interesting drug for non elective hip fracture patients to prevent loss of lean muscle mass, their PII study was very good and enrollment in PIII has begun. This program is called VK-5211. MDGL is worth 8X what VKTX is, has only one drug candidate and already has confirmed they are in aquisition talks. The stock was 30 a year ago, 315.00 now and makes no money. VKTX similar story, but it actually has a pipeline of the two previously mentioned programs and two more under develpment for anemia and diabetes. Key is, they are using The Thyroid and molecular agonists to achive these results, licenced from an ultra succesful company LGND.I like Boyd alot, not an expert in this area like bio, am I on to something. Thanks for the information, enjoy the recommendation, least I could do for coming on board."
"Went to Las Vegas last week and visited Main Street, California and Fremont. 777 at Main Street was great, beer is excellent. Buffet was lame and way over priced. Played some at California and Fremont also, but did not eat. Should have eaten at Tony Romas instead of gastronomical affront that is the Heart Attack Grill. Fun concept, but the burger was absolutely abysmal. Good crowds all over Fremont Street. Vegas is definitely coming back."
Why the spike? This company will go without revenue for at least a couple months I don’t see why it would spile
"Still don’t understand why Boyd has run up so high when every other casino besides CZR is down to pre pandemic levels. To me this was the weakest of the bunch? I have tothink their biz is way down, we’ll see this quarter."

"BYD slapped down like a bad dog. Listened to the conference call, beat on revenue, but missed earnings by a penny. Bought back 28 million dollars of stock. Expect big things from the Wilton tribal casino, but will not open till late 2020. Would not say much about legalized sports betting, waiting until after Sept. when more Boyd sports books open. Always on the lookout for M&A if the location is good. I'm staying long BYD. I do think that when Missouri legalizes sports betting it will be big for BYD."
Any buzz on a GDEN takeover by BYD??

"About time this horse starts to rally a bit... Wasn't sure if it was being dragged down by gaming ETFs in general or based on economic weakness as gaming stocks get hit very hard and very fast when recessions are imminent, or if it was BYD related. In any case, we are rallying a bit. I probably won't stick around long term though."
"Now that Wynn has closed, the pressure on the rest of the Casinos must be intense. Making a decision to cut your own throat, but protect the health of the people and reduce potential law suits. If they don't in the next day or so, the Gaming Commission will. Why wait guys. The sooner, the better."

Once the Wilton casino is up and running BYD stock will jump.
BYD has run in parallel with PENN until PENN’s announcement with Barstool. BYD will have better 4Q 2019 earnings than PENN IMO. With better earnings BYD should be +$36 after earnings. If there was a positive surprise at earnings possibly more....of course IMO.
I’m looking for a very good first quarter based on monthly casino results by State of Nevada.

Buy now while it’s down. There will be a merger announcement soon.
Stock price is where it was pre-pandemic. Up 30% in 3 months. Sure once a vaccine is developed some normalcy returns but talk about paying a premium at the moment.
So far I’ve been wrong... should have held. I still think this is valued too high and expect a significant drop by end of year.
"BYD stock price back up with much more travel, much more eating out, much more football coming"
"Boyd has little exposure to virus threat, but the media wags the dog"
BYD and other casino/hotel/cruise stocks are going to once again fall off a cliff in the coming days/weeks. Be forewarned and take whatever measures you can to protect yourselves. You can hedge with put options. Exit now (even if at a loss) and buy back at a much lower price (if you still are bullish long term). Short on the way down while holding your long position so that you at least get some short-term gains to offset your loss of value on your long position.
"Most of the people just wanna get rich overnight, when the price falls, they talk trash about the company. Is lucid fundamentally sounded? Did they do anything wrong for their cars?

I disagree with any casino stock benefiting from the Supreme Court decision. First the real benefit will come to all the race tracks that has horse racing. Second maybe some local casino will benefit and depending who owns the casinos. For Las Vegas as a whole this is a slow death to the Strip. So many individuals I talked to in last 24 hrs have no plans to return to Las Vegas once their favorite horse race track offers sports betting. Basically if I was a CEO especially in Las Vegas I would eliminate the resort fees. Although Boyd doesn't do that to its customers I would offer the rooms for free or very cheap rates of $15 a night. Sports betting in ever state will decrease over night stays in ever casino nationwide. Las Vegas will do well I imagine with other venues but when Super Bowl or March Madness comes less and less people will fly to this destination. Rather these same individuals will drive to nearest horse racing track or casino for few hours during the day. Say goodbye to frequent travelers who flight to place sports bets in Las Vegas. If I was to buy a stock now it be in the horse racing tracks not a casino stock.
"Now that we are at the HIGH, how do we know when it will max out?"
I decided to sell today. Overall up slightly as bought more in March. I am bullish on the sports aspect; however concerned 2021 won’t look terribly different from this year from a COVID standpoint keeping people home. I hope I’m wrong.
Starting nice run up before earnings announcement. I believe I’ve seen the same at a few other gambling stocks I follow. Let’s see what they say on Thursday after close. Would like to see +$34/share by Friday.

Over the weekend another state passed legalized sports betting. Now waiting for the Illinois Governors signature. BYD owns the Par-A-Dice Hotel and Casino in Illinois.
$29.80 is a tough hurdle to climb. Soon....IMO.....$33 before earnings.....
Well I just read through BYD presentation of results from yesterday. Well runned business. I think possibly conservative forecast especially with significant events this year in Vegas and their sports betting locations and Fanduel relationship outside of Vegas.
"I don't see anyone having an opportunity by BYD again at 6 1/2 or WYNN in the mid thirties anytime soon. When hedge funds realized where these two stocks had fallen, they bought these two and immediately we saw BYD jump-up $10 and WYNN a monumental $30 or so."

bought calls $10+ITM and $0.10 from breakeven for December...On down days look at the price of Itm calls..sellers forget to change prices to the point you can send a bid in on the ask.
"Preston had it right a few weeks ago. Be patient, good gaming stocks will be available for lower prices than what we see now. The initial reaction to the latest round of QE was trading limit down on Dow Futures Sunday night! Casinos cannot make money when customers don't show up."
"BYD, 36 by friday"

"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"
10 or 12 is golden entry point
"A retest of the lows at $7.50 is coming, probably next week. Did well with call options the first time they were 80% off their highs. Will consider what play is best WHEN they fall through the earlier lows."
"BYD has minor exposure to Virus, but the public needs to be careful if virus is present in location. testing is crucial for protecting the public."
"Fellow investors... looking at the two etfs with the largest holdings of BYD in it (PEZ and BJK), things don't look too good from a chart perspective. Fundamentally BYD is good and sports betting should be a tail wind, but the larger picture looks like investors are moving money out of the casinos because those are the first to go down hard when recession looms. PEZ is a consumer cyclical etf. The consumer in general is supposed to be good, wages slowly rising, etc, so you would think casinos, especially local ones, should be getting some investor love. Instead the opposite seems to be happening. I'll likely be looking to average down and then jump out as soon as I can. Not sure how much sports betting can turn the macro picture for the better. Maybe BYD is getting dragged down as collateral damage from these ETFs, but the question remains why, if the story is so good? Thoughts for or against are appreciated."
people must think byd owns the bellagio & resort world & the new frontier ground
why does barclays article today says target price of $8 then says target price of $32
Good stock prices for major casinos now. let's hope testing for COVID19 starts and helps stop the spread of virus.
tough sector all things considered..this will be back to the top..good time to accumulate shares at a low level not seen in a while.
"Why the big up/down volatility today?Down 4 1/2% then closed up almost1%. Was holding a significant position, glad I was busy and couldn’t do anything til 3:30 when I sold at $18.57 and took a nice gain."

"Just bought 1000 shares at 59.80, Very Bullish on BYD"
Earnings Thursday after close should be good . Heavy traffic from sports betting
"BYD should consider acquiring or investing in The Score (TSCRF), the little engine that could...18 months ago Penn signed an agreement with the Score whereby Penn provided the Score with skins to 9 states. This enables the Score to enter these states. In return Penn recevies royalties based on revenues and received ,4.7% of the Scores stock."
"According to BYD's latest 10-Q, earnings are significantly down from last year's comparable quarter. I made a mistake buying this stock. One of my stops has already kicked in. The other one will probably hit early next week, if not sooner."
Down nicely today mostly on sympathy with MGM's earnings miss. Wait a day or two for it to shake out then think about adding...
10% pre..
People must be confusing this with the chinese EV stock :D
"$78 price target, great buy here"
