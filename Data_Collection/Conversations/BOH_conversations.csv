BOH reached a 52 Week low at $64.87
"Wow, the Bank is taking it on the chin today!!!"
Can you believe what a biased opinion SIMPLY WALL ST. put out on BOH? Saying it was a poor investment because its' stock lost 30% value in past 3 years. They say BOH was lagging the general market. Yet they do not compare to other banks. They fail to say ALL of this loss is from the Covid-19 in past 5 months. All banks are getting hammered. Simple logic.... do yourself a favor and don't even bother to read anything from SIMPLY WALL ST.
Nice recovery today with a corresponding increase in the 10 year bond yield.
Unless youâ€™re day trading...your crazy for not buying this stock as its price sinks. This bank is iron clad.

"Sold Short at $57.12 on Friday afternoon as a Pure Earnings play. 1700 shares. Going big on this one because even though the stock is down a lot I do not think the full impact of the Coronavirus has been priced in. BOH has huge exposure to the economic collapse caused by the virus very specifically in Hawaii. Out of all 50 states Hawaii is the single MOST economically dependent upon travel and tourism. More than FL, CA, or NY. No tourism for 4+ months has and will devastate local hotels, restaurants, clubs, bars. And this will result in terrible earnings for BOH. I am looking for this stock to sell off tomorrow on a bad report and no or very weak guidance going forward. Looking to cover at under $50.00."
