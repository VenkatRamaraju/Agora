"I have concerns that I have tried to voice with Cumberland about the promotions around Kristalose. I am hopeful that I can come resolution soon here but after over 6 months attempting to communicate with many of their executives, I still have no resolution yet. I am hopeful that this will be solved soon. after all, it is hundreds of dollars that we are talking about for a customer that will represent a 30K+ per year spend. seems nuts right? Especially when it is what is put in writing - but the terms and conditions are not publically available- hence nothing in writing there."
