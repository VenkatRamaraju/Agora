"It happened $22 billion deal with ADA, very exciting!!Grab your ADA before it goes to new highs. Much luck to all"
"We conducted extensive in-depth study and came to conclusion, that cloud native 5G network Dish is developing, won't be materially different than what legacy Telcos are planning to make."
Massive after hours drop.
"The terminal value of Dish's content business is ZERO. The market is valuing DISH as ""assets held for sale"" E.g their spectrum assets."
"DISH is reported to be preparing for a fresh round of RFPs/RFIs, this time targeted at fiber and other support for networks. DISH's advantage and disadvantage stems from the same fact: DISH starts out building its network from the ground up. The is a momentous task requiring large up-front investments before the company's own network turns a dime. However, DISH has far fewer legacy contraints on what to build. They can use the more efficient and estimated 40% cheaper stand-alone 5G New Radio, 5G NR, approach to help bridge the gap between the mobile startup and entrenched competitors. DISH can also target the sweet spots that fit its own evolving capabilities, thus achieving more direct ROI."
SCOOP: State AGs trying to block @TMobile - @Sprint doing a deep dive into @dish's financials and ability to compete as a fourth major wireless network; will try and show $DISH to be weaker than pre-merger Sprint more now @FoxBusiness @LizClaman $S $DISH $TMUS
"Sold Short a lot of shares of DISH just before the close on Friday, at an average price of $41.98. I normally seek out seriously over-valued stocks for my Pure Earnings Short Sell plays. And DISH does not currently qualify as being over-valued. And yet...I could not pass up this play, because being a trader for decades I have a keen understanding of how technology stocks are treated by the stock market. Every technology has a life cycle. It bursts into public consciousness, gains popularity, becomes popular and is embraced. then slowly fades out as something apparently better, or at least more interesting, comes along. DISH is currently beginning a slow fade-out. There is no return once such a fade-out begins. And the stock market is very unkind to tech stocks once a consensus is reached among the general public that a specific technology is on the way out. I perceive Monday morning's ER as potentially being the ""breaking point"" by which the market as a whole decides that DISH technology has no viable medium-long term future. This could be triggered by weak EPS or Revenue numbers, or weak/no Guidance going forward. And if that happens, a 5-12% collapse in stock price is quite likely. Do I wish this puppy was more over-valued going into the trade?? Of course. But even if they modestly beat consensus EPS and Revenue estimates for this past quarter, all the warning signs going forward are still in place, and it is hard for me to envision the stock going up much, if at all. Happy to be Short on this dinosaur and eagerly awaiting the price action tomorrow. :-)"
How did DISH improve earnings with fewer subscribers? I'm interested in buying but hestitate when I read that they have lost subscribers two quarters in a row.
Dish has real challenges to its legacy business no question at all . However owning this stock for 20 years buying every year . I believe good things are coming
"Latest from CharlesWill update @LJMoynihan's scoop on Charlie Ergen vowing to launch a competitive wireless carrier on ""Day 1"" if the @TMobile - @sprint deal survives the federal court challenge to the merger by state AGs now @TeamCavuto @FoxBusiness $TMUS $DISH $S"
Forget about low margin RAN contracts. $ERIC and Samsung are low balling bids in a fight over market share. Nokia has removed themselves from such situations. The real money is going to be made upgrading network core infrastructure and providing the software to access it. Virtualization of the RAN to move computation to the cloud will remove all that heat and power traditional RAN generate. RAN processing will occur in climate controlled data centers. Huawai and ERIC edge in RAN will be reduced because of this shift. If you have no idea what I am talking about then Google Rakuten and $DISH new mobile phone service. Core hardware and software have much better margins than RAN. Margin improvement is the #1 goal of $NOK right now.
"Thinking of buying some shares, any opinions of their future?"
"Hot news just off the wires, and not good for DISH:(Reuters) - Sinclair Broadcast Group said on Monday more than hundreds of its TV stations will no longer air on Dish Network Corp's network after a carriage agreement between the companies expires on Aug. 16.""We have tried unsuccessfully to reach fair and customary terms with DISH Network for the renegotiation of our retransmission consent,"" David Gibber, Sinclair's general counsel said. The company said it was unlikely an agreement would be reached before the current one expires.In total, 112 broadcast TV stations are expected to be dropped, including ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC affiliates, Sinclair said, adding that on-demand and online access to the programming for Dish's subscribers would also be discontinued."
"DISH hopes to take advantage of building of the core 5G New Radio mobile network from the ground up. Similar to Rakuten, Japan, DiSH plans to build a 'cloud-native' network that uses edge/distributed network resources such as content and applications servers that are connected together using low-latency fiber-optic and gigabit wireless. The network is then fanned out to smallcells or 5G Home gNodeB/eNb routers and subscriber units. Rakuten is using Intel 86 architecture servers rather than the dedicated server hardware that is typically found in mobile networks. These generic type servers run 5G software based server stacks. The advantage is that this approach has the potential to reduce the cost of the base station and content/applications servers while providing longer term use since the software can be upgraded up to multiple times before hardware becomes that much better as to justify replacement. Since there is a point at which improvement of performance at the base stations becomes small compared to adding edge/distributed content and applications servers to locations closer to end users, this architectural approach shifts the performance gains closer to it being a market-driven rather than hardware upgrade driven set of priorities. That leads to reductions in deployment and operating costs estimated at between 1/4 to 2/3rds less than competitors who must deal with a large installed base of infrastructure. It also provides much greater flexibility and strategic benefits such as the ability to partner with content, gaming, social network and other applications providers. DISH might, for example, partner with NetFlix or other content provider to connect to their core network as a virtual network host that serves not just DiSH's customers but those subscribed to competitors networks. It will come down to a case-by-case ROI basis whether that makes sense for both the content/apps providers and DISH...a competition where the cost advantage of the new 5G network architecture may win in the competitive market place."
"The Cardano deal is MHUGE for DISH and ADA. Cardano gets millions of users onboarded seamlessly. Dish gets complete, secure, robust, decentralized enterprise-scale infrastructure for identity and the ability to monetize new offerings to its customers AND others across the globe, should they want to expand/scale some services that far.There is zero downside to either."
ok I'm new to the stock. Amazon will be cloud sharing with dish. Does that mean Amazon will be buying Dish
"Keep in mind: last summer, when the price tumbled this low, Charlie Ergen was buying with both fists.... and that was before final approval for Dish to operate as the nationâ€™s #4 carrier."
"Dish received upgrades at $60, up from his $50 target earlier and 49.4% higher from its closing level on Tuesday. Never bet against Charlie"
"Satellite is dead, long live streaming. SLING is hands down the best streaming service out there - fast, great user interface. They haven't done their packages properly though. They should switch to a higher granularity of a-la-carte choosing of channels.DISH is progressing towards being an Internet Service Provider and streaming over it, but this will take a year before we see any offerings for their 5G delivery, and then it will be only in major markets to start.I think DISH will survive all this, but it will be rough going over the next year. They really need to ensure 5G rollout, and they need to do something to make SLING more attractive to streamers, they got a jump start on competition and it really IS the best one out there, but they need to fix the package offerings to optimize revenue from it."
"After getting off with customer service boost mobile they told me that the highest mbps of data you can get in the city of Boston is 2mbps, they are going to crash and burn"
