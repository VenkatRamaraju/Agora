5G deployment is on schedule. 5G iPhone may be just a month delay. $DISH wireless phone business is coming. I hope they do something with SNCR. Just a personal wish.
"Hot news just off the wires, and not good for DISH:(Reuters) - Sinclair Broadcast Group said on Monday more than hundreds of its TV stations will no longer air on Dish Network Corp's network after a carriage agreement between the companies expires on Aug. 16.""We have tried unsuccessfully to reach fair and customary terms with DISH Network for the renegotiation of our retransmission consent,"" David Gibber, Sinclair's general counsel said. The company said it was unlikely an agreement would be reached before the current one expires.In total, 112 broadcast TV stations are expected to be dropped, including ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC affiliates, Sinclair said, adding that on-demand and online access to the programming for Dish's subscribers would also be discontinued."
"Keep in mind: last summer, when the price tumbled this low, Charlie Ergen was buying with both fists.... and that was before final approval for Dish to operate as the nation’s #4 carrier."
I heard about DISH the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Still under $40 ?! What a steal.Its like no one is bothering to read this company's financials.Maybe we should change name from DISH to ""Modern Networks"" or""Advanced Communications Technology"" something like that."
Towards 40. Keep going
"Looks like BlackRock has been accumulating shares, just like me.They announced accumulating 16 million shares.I have been able to accumulate a bit less shares...But when DISH price doubles, we both will double out money!"
"Taken from Tim Farrar twitterKerrisdale Capital @KerrisdaleCap 5h5 hours agoMoreIn 2014, we wrote on $GSAT. In 2015, it was $STRP. 2016 was $DISH. 2017, $VSAT. Tomorrow, we release this year’s report on satellites, spectrum and the market’s recent rocketship stock"
This stock is of alot Merger speculation. People don't merge when it overvalued. They are going to hedge loans on stock price next to build network. The light will go on that this is overhyped.
"No questions, Dish Networks will be clear winner in Xiden's universal broadband plan. It's only company who can match speed and affordability requirements."
Earnings estimates going up as well. Near term earnings & cash flow and the long term strategy are both good.
"15,000 5g towers planned.Launch Q3 of this year.Watch out Verizon and ATT!"
"Nobody wants to bid this up here in the pre-market. 8:20 AM and the best bid DISH can get is $38.39. A very ominous sign for shareholders for the regular session, in terms of likely price movement. But a very attractive indication if you happen to be Short a lot of shares. :-)"
"Ligado networks colloborate with Rakuten for open ran L-band. DISH has 75% coverage in US with 12GHZ that Elon want to use it, sure...mayby 80B like C-band auction..=)This is gona be sweet to watch, and make sure you have some of these stocks, NOK has stuff for all of them.."
DISH reached a new 52 Week Low at 44.20
the deal is amzn. is also known as a potential buyer of Dish
Charlie ‘ The Snake  ‘ Ergen’s $Dish stock hit a new 52 week high today. $Sprint down almost 4%.
Buy now on the dip so you can reap rewards in 3-4yr investment from wireless roll out.
Is the news about the merger not going through effect Dish to negative. Doesn't the merger have to happen for them to access to the network?
Will back-test 37 but smart people are saying this will double in the next couple years
SCOOP: State AGs trying to block @TMobile - @Sprint doing a deep dive into @dish's financials and ability to compete as a fourth major wireless network; will try and show $DISH to be weaker than pre-merger Sprint more now @FoxBusiness @LizClaman $S $DISH $TMUS
"""Compete at Scale""Evergreen - ""Scale As Competitive AdvantageIn some industries, scale is a distinct advantage and a clear competitive advantage. In others, scale creates unnecessary overhead and fragility that leads to larger companies being continually beaten by smaller competitors.""The wireless industry is based on acquiring licenses to spectrum and building nationwide networks to offer phone, text, broadband, media, mobile payments, automotive, medical, security, IoT, and other services. Many of these services are offered as packages. And many families, business and government organizations buy multiple services from a single or limited number of suppliers. The cost of the foundation spectrum licenses and networks ranges from about $20 billion for a new startup to hundreds of billions of dollars to establish a multiple-service platform of services across the entire nation and build a competitive level of revenue from market share. The wireless industry has a very high barrier to market entry. It has been compared to that of the largest semiconductor suppliers such as Intel: the cost of developing the technologies and skills needed to design and build state-of-the-art chips prevents new entrants from getting started and existing ones, namely AMD, from disrupting market share and revenue. Like the semiconductor industry, new technology (5G) combined with a competitive MVNO starting point in market share has the potential to create an entry into an otherwise uneconomical proposition. In semiconductors that type of market shift has occurred with the popularity of mobile devices and the rise of open operating systems, namely Google Android. That could be equated, roughly, as an MVNO entry point. If Google had done a poor job of developing Android the open device market may have developed so that just a few suppliers dominated developments circa the pre-iPhone era. ARM (now owned by SoftBank) was able to capitalize on this by selling processor cores to the majority of device manufacturers. That has caused Intel to give up on mainstream efforts to enter the mobile device market for chips. Dish has an opportunity to enter the market by capitalizing on the cost advantages and amplified capabilities of 5G and the unique deal for MVNO access on New T-Mobile's network.Compete at Scale - SprintThe AGs lawsuit suggests that Sprint can compete in the wireless market despite a history that shows they cannot. On the surface this looks obvious: Sprint tried repeatedly to lure customers away from competitors and grab a share of new mobile customers by offering lower prices and higher bandwidth than competitors. That failed because Sprint lacked scale of market share to generate enough revenue to be profitable, buy more low-band spectrum that could be used to improve coverage. Sprint's market share has declined over the past several years, from up to 19% to less than the 11% it holds now. That means Sprint spreads the cost of building networks across one out of 10 customers in the market compared to Verizon and AT&T's 1 out of 3 each. In other words, Sprint's cost of providing the service is roughly three times higher. The AGs ignore that history and baseline to claim that Sprint is needed to provide long-term competition. That is not possible.Dish's position via its market share in satellite and OTT media services is unique in the USA. The closest competitor to New Dish (Dish plus New T-Mo MVNO plus Dish’s mix of spectrum bands) is AT&T which offers the combined DTV, DSL and mobile service."
Ergen might throw out a spectrum deal announcement or update before his conference begins in about two hours. Be careful since this hard nosed poker player holds his cards close to his vest. IMO
Someone please explain to me how buying a #$%$ cell phone service that loses money with one of the highest churns in the business in a cutthroat competitive market justifies a higher stock price?
Latest from Charlie!Breaking — @JusticeATR just announced it will issue a press release on an unstated matter today. People close to @TMobile - @sprint say final paperwork is being signed. so you figure it out $TMUS $S $DISH
"DISH looks on the cusp of a new era for the company. This is not the satellite business as usual.This deal will open up very worthwhile possibilities. DISH will change from a satellite dinosaur business into fulfilling the road Charlie Ergen started on several years ago to become a major wireless plus entertainment service company. What road did Charlie set out on? The briefest way to describe it is ""the lowest cost wireless innovation company. The path to 5G fits well with Charlies aim. He has been taking side-step stabs at getting into wireless. The buying of spectrum looked well calculated as assembling the array bands needed to build 4G-Advanced & 5G networks; however, that could have been just to flip it. I have always liked the character portrayed as Charlie Ergen but doubted that he has known what to do with the spectrum. His moves were dashes, not cohesive enough to have much merit. However , one theme always showed up: it aimed to develop a lowest-cost supplier with the most innovations. Being at low cost is not a curse because it is what 5G can enable if it is better taken advantage than Fric and Frak (AT&T and Verizon) are doing. Think about the combination of devices and services DISH should be able to innovate or work with current suppliers? Think about how companies can deploy the 10x-100x more 'wireless network nodes' and the distributed 5G platform: DISH is in the business of satellite-based services which DISH installed and serviced at low cost. DISH has not had the ability to package phone services, full broadband or offer new types of devices that could help make the experience seamless.DISH also has lacked market share, particularly mobile and broadband. That has been an arm behind Ergen's back. That made it very difficult to wheel and deal or provide meaningful innovations in products.This deal has changed my opinion of Charlie Ergen: it shows the willingness to be more than the textbook CEO-Owner. He will gamble but has put his skin in the game.Respect."
"SCOOP: Some @TMobile - @sprint deal participants are so skeptical of @dish Charlie Ergen's dealing w @JusticeATR that theyre predicting/praying Charter and John Malone makes a last minute play for the divested assets/spectrum to create that elusive ""fourth carrier"" $TMUS $S $DISH"
DISH is up 5.02% to 41.46
DISH Network is up 5.20% to 38.81
"Amazon is somehow going to get wireless spectrum. They bought a small router company> They will bundle prime in to their wireless offering and will track you going to pickup pre ordered groceries from whole foods and have someone bring to your car like uber. They are seriously going to transform 5G with home automation to green water heaters all through 5g. You watch VZ, ATT and TMUS wont know what hit them."
"What does Charlie's stock buy yesterday tell us:1) He doesn't have any insider information that we don't know, otherwise he couldn't buy.2) What we know is that 5G won't be available until earliest next year.What this tells us, is that DISH will continue sub loss for sat, continue growth at less profitable SLING. 5G services won't start until maybe next year. That will be a loss for a while. In other words, same old same old for at least 1-2 years.When this hits 25, I would call it a buy because of the high risk that maybe they will turn around their shrinking market."
Time for dish to pop !
"The media continue to focus on the AG lawsuit as being a big obstacle to closing the merger. While they must overcome it, the grounds for the AG's complaint were weak and have become pathetically weaker IMO.THe DoJ ATR reached out to the 13 AG’s just days prior to the approval decision to explain why the merger and the side deal with Dish met the requirements for structural market changes needed to move forward and would be procompetitive. Five out of the 13 AG’s have withdrawn their support of the lawsuit as of Friday, the day of DoJ’s announcement. While I conjectured that DoJ would net some in their quest, I think this is a great early going given the complexity of the issues involved. While the topic has been open for review, recent changes have not. That prejudices there be time for a fresh review of the details and also of the impact on the need and viability of the lawsuit since the DoJ has joined with the FCC to approve. I think more AG’s will withdraw from the case and, if left unresolved, the DoJ ATR will join on the side of the defendants, the NewTM, New T-Mobile group. While the lawsuit can theoretically continue so long as one AG remains in support, the cards continue to stack up against it."
DISH Network is up 7.81% to 36.98
"Maybe I don't understand how value is set, but Dish's spectrum value just doubled with the latest auction. Any one who wants 5G in the future will be bidding on Dish. It would be too expensive to replica their holdings through auctions."
DISH Network is up 4.94% to 40.97
"Charlie on the call to talk about ""SPECTRUM."" Go get em, boy!"
I wouldn't recommend Dish to my worst enemy. Dish raises the monthly charge and cuts stations.
Just my opinion. Something is working or aligning to benefit dish
let's see how those 8 million boost subscribers fit in
"We conducted extensive in-depth study and came to conclusion, that cloud native 5G network Dish is developing, won't be materially different than what legacy Telcos are planning to make."
"DISH is currently undervalued.I am accumulating.This thing will be in the 60's and everyone will say they wish theyhad bought when it was depressed.Why in the 60's ?Earnings!Just watch the earnings in the next 3 quarterly reports. You will see it unfold before your very eyes.Then you'll say: I had a chance 3 months ago, but didn't act."
"DISH's latest attempt to create leverage for its obsoleted satellite business and speculation on the spectrum that it fails to live up to is to throw a wrench into the T-Mobile+Sprint merger.The arguments in the PR and interviews do not add up: DISH is not in the wireless business except for a mandated token effort that is being made so that the company does not lose their spectrum licenses. Nobody in the industry sees the narrowband IoT effort as significant competition. A few analysts have asked about it during conference calls... questions that come mostly from naive newbies. The answer is always of the ilk, 'we do not see DISH as a significant competitor.' DISH/Ergen acquired and got re-purposing rights to satellite spectrum that, on the surface, should have value. However, the spectrum shortage ended a few years ago. DISH has gone begging for partners, buyers, and leniency from the FCC so that it does not have to take the gamble of competing in mainstream wireless markets.DISH is getting more DISHperate, er Desperate:DISH's point man, Blum asserts that the merger will be anticompetitive so that it will force prices 15% higher. At the same time, he claims entrants into the filed will thus be thwarted. That makes no fundamental sense: new entry is dampened by how 'prices work lower/down'. A new entry is helped by higher prices, allowing them to gain a market foothold - to gain subscribers rather than lose them as DISH is growing accustomed. What DISH claims is disingenuous: They obviously want to force wireless players to either buy their spectrum or partner in networks and roaming. On essence, DISH wants Sprint to remain at a competitive disadvantage so that they can either buy it cheaply or force business partnership on their/Ergen's terms.That is not likely to work and may even backfire. If Sprint is forced to release some of its spectra, Verizon and AT&T would have less reason to do business with Ergen. If the company and its surrogate front organization cannot put up more salient arguments, that will focus more attention on DISH's failure to live up to the intent of the concessions and favorable licenses the FCC has granted the company over the years. The FCC has reached a point at which they have basically said. ""Cut the jive Ergen, et al, its time to put up or shut up (relinquish your spectrum or sell it off so that others will make use of it)."
Amazon or Google can easily buy out Dish and build the 5G network.
Sell dish and buy roku. Streaming is the future and it’s free
"Here we go, all it took was a bit of patience and we now have a turn to the Red side. So much risk and uncertainty going forward for DISH. Gonna be more profit-taking as the day wears on. My plan is now to stay Short through the Conference Call, and probably until at least 2 PM ET, looking for DISH to move down significantly further as the CC turns out to be a Nothingburger. :-)"
John Legere dishes on $Dish. John knows $Dish Is one of the Companies working hard to make sure the T-Mobile Sprint merger doesn’t happen...Next on “Hoarders”: @dish.

What is happening?
"DISH Network beats by $0.21, beats on revs6:13 AM ET 8/9/21 Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $1.06 per share, $0.21 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $0.85; revenues rose 40.8% year/year to $4.49 bln vs the $4.43 bln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.---------------------------------------------------Doesn't look bad, right? The question is, will the market as a whole perceive DISH as having a positive, profitable medium and long-term future ahead of her, or will traders and investors decide this is the perfect time to bail out of a sinking ship?? My bet is on the latter, which is why I chose DISH as my Pure Earnings Short Sell Play of the Day, and threw a lot of $$ into her to the Short side just before market close on Friday."
"Rakuten, the Japanese company that is building a large scale cloud-forward, Open RAN (radio access network), announced on April 8 the launch of their 5G NR network. DISH is closely modeling their efforts. The advantage of the cloud-centric approach is that it uses Open-RAN (O-RAN) standards to design the hardware of the network using general purpose servers, network routers, applications and media servers, while the software is modular, open sourced. Parts of mobile RAN are different from the IT/Internet cloud service platform. And individual operators can use different network management, billing, Big Data, and advertising software. However, because the core functionality is modular, virtualized and open, the new cloud-centric approach leads to less reliance on sole-sourced vendors and limited choices of system management and maintenance. The approach theoretically leads to a 40% lower cost compared to the multiple standards used by operators up until now. Incumbent operators must support legacy network hardware, software and back office systems and cannot take advantage of cloud-centric O-RAN without a long transition process. That gives the greenfield (clean sheet of paper) operators a competitive advantage so long as they can fill up their network to pay for it. Rakuten’s CTO says that they have seen the 40% projected lower cost of building the network. He says the cost of maintenance and management will beat the 40% expectation. The launch, which Rakuten had delayed a few months, is good news for DISH. Rakuten is going through the problems of being early to deploy O-RAN which DISH can directly benefit. DISH has not announced details on their deployments. They have indicated that many of their suppliers will be the same as Rakuten’s."
"DISH's $1 billion IoT network plan is not even a toe in the water of entry into the mobile wireless market pool. This is a clear effort to meet the letter of the law (FCC regulatory requirements) for holding onto DISH's 700 MHz spectrum. Since the investment is relatively small for any nationwide (must cover 70% of POPS) wireless network, it serves as a way to hold onto the spectrum license without risking very much capital (compared to the hypothetical value of the spectrum or the cost of building a full multi-service mobile network to compete, as a startup, with entrenched, average 1.1% churn rate, mobile operators.DISH holds spectrum that could be very useful to Verizon or AT&T. If Sprint had the funds or if Softbank did a 180 degree about face to pour mo-money in, Sprint would have a slim chance of being a candidate to buy DISH's spectra. Sprint does hold out a potential to partner with DISH but the prospects any shared network builds still looks like a very tough uphill battle on multiple fronts.DISH faces two new threats to the ambitions to sell the spectrum, build a competitive network or partner to enter the wireless space:1) Over a Gigahertz of new spectra is going to be released in the 2.7-5 GHz frequencies which are now considered to be part of the mid-band.2) 4G-Advanced and 5G/5G NR technologies combined with the additional spectrum bands provide what is needed to expand wireless broadband terrestrial networks to achieve fiber-cable replacement service capacity. Building that out will take additional time and money. The '5G Network' and applications will require much denser builds that include several times the average current density of smallcells and use of additional and new antenna systems including massive-MIMO/m-MIMO.3) The wireless market has become highly saturated. The reported growth in 'subscribers' often includes the sale of multiple subscriptions of broadband for laptops, dongles and automobiles to the same persons. This 'multiple-attach' rate of sales usually does not carry the same increase in price tag as real subscriber growth. Each of the services has their own level of market maturity and saturation. There is a potential for 5G to usher in fresh waves of new devices and applications, such as real-time multiple-player gaming and video sharing that can result in more service subscriptions. However, that new revenue will be shared with OTT and device suppliers and is very unlikely to be made totally captive.DISH does have some things going for it: Besides the spectra, DISH's business is based on the install of receivers that are placed outside of homes/buildings on roofs or standing poles. Those have the potential to be swapped out for 5G routers or for the routers to be added in addition to the existing satellite receiver. The mechanism for doing that are the same homeowner self-installs and installation crews. That can provide a high density in the critical part of the network close to consumers. The total investment needed to provide a mobile network would be daunting. DISH's best bets for sale of their spectrum without incurring losses or making a profit:1) Verizon: VZ will come under pressure by T-Mobile or New T-Mobile due to their competitive position in low-mid band spectra. DISH's holdings provide the largest array of bands available. That pressure will mount if the New T-Mobile merger is approved. However, the merger would also remove Sprint as a partner for joint-network development or other deals.2) The cable companies could do deals with DISH to buy or use its spectra, however, there has been no indication that is in the offing. The T-Mo merger might be structured in different ways to include access arrangements for cable companies. If so, that would diminish their need to build their own independent networks.The wireless industry has pushed an agenda to cause the release of large amounts of spectra in recent years. About 4X the number of spectra currently open for use will come available over the next few years. Combined with the higher density needed of the 5G network multiple-service architecture, the value of DISH's spectra is made more speculative so that it will likely depend on the strategic prerogatives of these limited number of players. Competitors have multiple spectra and partnering choices, pushing DISH's spectra into the deck of cards as only one possible outcomes."
I am in the Dish Retail business and Charlie has such a grand vision for what the spectrum will be along with dishes full bundle of related products! There are big big things cooking for the future of dish i am excited to be a share holder and a dish retailer! Once people see the speeds and the technology it will be a nation wide game changer.!
"Walt Piecyk tweet in the last hour.“After sitting through 2 weeks of court testimony, it’s hard not come to the conclusion that this deal is destined to close. "" $S $TMUS $DISH"
DISH to Build the 5G Network as designated by FCC? How?
"DISH hopes to take advantage of building of the core 5G New Radio mobile network from the ground up. Similar to Rakuten, Japan, DiSH plans to build a 'cloud-native' network that uses edge/distributed network resources such as content and applications servers that are connected together using low-latency fiber-optic and gigabit wireless. The network is then fanned out to smallcells or 5G Home gNodeB/eNb routers and subscriber units. Rakuten is using Intel 86 architecture servers rather than the dedicated server hardware that is typically found in mobile networks. These generic type servers run 5G software based server stacks. The advantage is that this approach has the potential to reduce the cost of the base station and content/applications servers while providing longer term use since the software can be upgraded up to multiple times before hardware becomes that much better as to justify replacement. Since there is a point at which improvement of performance at the base stations becomes small compared to adding edge/distributed content and applications servers to locations closer to end users, this architectural approach shifts the performance gains closer to it being a market-driven rather than hardware upgrade driven set of priorities. That leads to reductions in deployment and operating costs estimated at between 1/4 to 2/3rds less than competitors who must deal with a large installed base of infrastructure. It also provides much greater flexibility and strategic benefits such as the ability to partner with content, gaming, social network and other applications providers. DISH might, for example, partner with NetFlix or other content provider to connect to their core network as a virtual network host that serves not just DiSH's customers but those subscribed to competitors networks. It will come down to a case-by-case ROI basis whether that makes sense for both the content/apps providers and DISH...a competition where the cost advantage of the new 5G network architecture may win in the competitive market place."
"Opinion: Trial turning point in Tmus/Sprint favor. When the AG’s argued that $Dish wouldn’t/couldn’t be a viable business, couldn’t be competitive in the wireless sector. Judge Marrero had to be thinking “ where’s the evidence that predicts the future “, especially coming from a bunch of Bureaucrats that couldn’t even run a successful motor vehicle agency in most places in America￼? The merger will be approved."
"Could Comcast or Charter become acquirer's of DISH or its Spectrum or forge a network development alliance? Yes because difficult times can create 'strange bedfellows'. The DOJ and FCC appear to be nearing a decision, despite the delay caused by the government shutdown, to approve the merger between T-Mobile and Sprint. That decision pivots on whether the definition of 'the market' being used has expanded to include the hybrid fiber-cable, satellite, MVNOs, media, and mobile industry giants. That consideration would pre-dispose the DOJ and FCC to generally allow further consolidation to occur between cablecos, media, and satellite companies (to name a few)."
"Ergen has baited the shorts, and he now has them right where they should be......using this forum to talk about the merits or lack thereof of the SPECTRUM worth at least $30 Billion stand alone. Remember Clearwire--bought at a significant, unexpected premium by Softbank from The Bushwhacker Clan--because this one is that on STEROIDS as part of the 5G spectrum assets it maintains. IMO"
"Dish Losing 88,000 customers in 1 Qtr-is a negative trend ,Its debt level is 114%-Cramer says avoid to dangerous .And the space just doesnt work ,Look what AT&T did ,they bought Direct Tv for 49 Billion, now selling in for 15 Billion, Ouch -Dish going to 17-25 , in the next 30-60 days sad to say- Its a broken modelInterest on the 10 year at 1.42 % ,but when it hits 1.50 % it will trigger a sell off ,in all tech stocks, including Dish-Good luck"
"Dish received upgrades at $60, up from his $50 target earlier and 49.4% higher from its closing level on Tuesday. Never bet against Charlie"
How did DISH improve earnings with fewer subscribers? I'm interested in buying but hestitate when I read that they have lost subscribers two quarters in a row.
"Dish is playing the Russian roulette with the acquisition of boost mobile, if it doesnt take the deal soon and somebody else does, Dish stock will plummet even more."
"IMHO, DISH short term ('til 1Q 2019) will continue with the same subscriber loss on DISH, same gain on SLING, revenue will continue going down.I think 1Q 2019 is when DISH sub loss will level, but SLING sub gain will continue though. Rollout of 1st 5G internet in large metropolitan areas will see 1st subs coming onboard. Pricepoint for home 5G internet my guess will be $60/month, but maybe discount to $50 for bundle with SLING. Average new sub will be $75/month vs current $25/month. Long term, this is their gameplan to be a Verizon FIOS and Comcast killer. I also see new SLING offerings with premium Hulu competition with their OnDemand going further back than the current week in the guide.I do see further debt as they build out their 5G network, which will stagnate the stock, and possibly drive it down further (great buy opportunity!). So much potential. Their spectrum is worth way more than the current valuation. But wireless internet will be the internet delivery mechanism for the next 10 years or so until something newer comes around. DISH is looking to the future to replace outgoing tech (Dishes). If they are smart, they will roll out a new company for DISH, roll all their debt into that new business and then bankrupt it. This is what Verizon did with their yellow pages business to get rid of a dying business area along with getting rid of all their debt."
"We have been without ABC on from DISH for quite some time. I received my monthly bill with no reduction in the amount. After calling, I did receive a $5 reduction, but I should not have had to make the call. It should have been done by DISH. They are charging me for a service they are not providing. Hopefully everyone will call to request their $5 reduction."
"What’s the growth on this stock heading into mobile?Can we expect a 50% pop the first year, then 15% to 20% for the next 5 ? Any comments"
"DISH's spectrum holdings are worth approximately $18.5 billion.Market Cap right now is at $19.25 billion.DISH likely will get $500 million fine returned to them from the FCC ruling against them on Spectrum purchase.DISH could get an additional $3 billion in spectrum too as a result.Market Cap is way undervalued right now. Don't understand how it could be so undervalued, unless investors are just waiting until it gets closer to 5G roll out."
"We just secured 4,000 5G tower antenna points. DISH is becoming a 5G national cellular phone carrier!"
Do you think DISH will benefit from $65 for broadband in the infrastructure plan?
They had some interesting insights about DISH on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
DISH is a dead man walking. Satellite TV is dying and there is no way they become a meaningful player in 5g. They will have to sell to one of the big three. Anti-trust issues will be brutal. A three way deal with T and DSCA with T getting the telecom business and spectrum and DSCA (or the hedge fund that bought Directv from T) getting the satellite tv piece is possible. Would love to see it.
Long time share holder since 2002 . Just bought more yesterday. Native of Denver watched Ergen over the years . See what happens
I dont understand revenue drop and share increasing
Would. DISH. buy. Sprint????
"dish doesn't need to but direct TV, direct TV is pretty much giving their customer to dish in large quantities."
"DISH is one volatile mohmucker of a stock. It occasionally gets the rug pulled out from under it and collapses to the floor. This is one of those periods of time: DISH has reached an extreme oversold condition from which it will bounce. When? It could be tomorrow with the help of a coherent talk by Mike Spence (yea, a big surprise for the man behind the woodwork imo). The coronavirus has shaken confidence in the goldilocks economy because it was something that we do not know how the deeply intertwined world economy can deal with. A simple virus, something humanty/animals have had to deal with almost since the beginning of complex life on earth has thrown a wrench into the fabric of modern society... travel, meetings, factories, transport of goods... how do you disinfect world commerce? Wait for it to die out? Let it rip through every nation until natural immunity strikes the balance? Nasty re-emgergence of science into our thinking. The science deniers have to deal with it like everyone else.Investors who use modern trading tools have benefitted, like it or not, from the market volatility. Program traders got out early and some shorted the way down. History.What do you do now? Set up program trades to buy when upside considitions are met or complain how badly you are being treated? Your choice only."
DISH needs to buy direct TV and become a dominant player. This will happen soon
"Even though satellite TV is in the path of being overtaken by fixed-mobile wireless and OTT, DISH should benefit in holding onto that markets hare by offering mobile as part of the packages. It is feasible to grow some satellite subscribers by being a more attractive alternative to AT&T mobile packaged with DTV and offering others an alternative that will have a good future for improved service. That changes the image of the satellite service to having more longevity as an adjunct or placeholder until 5G Home Broadband and higher bandwidth mobile services are available. The expanded market is both of these: the use of what are technically called eNB or enhanced 5G eNB premises routers serve the function similar to satellite receivers in that they have high-gain antennas to boost the signals to the small cells or tower base stations. That not only helps out the consumer but it also multiplies the efficiency of the connection by achieving higher modulation efficiencies. That is commonly experienced using WiFi - having an improved signal magnifies the bandwidth, increases reliability, reduces the latency that result in better user experience. Mobile has not had a sustained bandwidth capacity to handle household and business traffic. Even though high data rates are touted. the networks are designed for there is only a small percentage of users consuming HD video and other high-demand applications. A properly deployed 5G network can deliver multiple services including sustained high-bandwidth applications. As I expected, DISH plans to use T-Mobile's network to serve customers until they build their network on a city-by-city basis. The approach may be to use a modular virtual network approach. If so, the first city or three would be test builds of the equipment, network management, and other software, and building support regimens that can then be used as the template for other locations. That has the chance of greatly reducing installation and ongoing operating costs, giving DISH the market advantage that will be needed to take mobile, media, and some satellite share from competitors."
"If you live out in the country you have no option but to go Dish. Plus it is cheaper than any of the competition. I don't understand the 52 week low, Seems like it would be a good time to buy."
"Why has DISH become a hot stock to trade and, as it shows its stuff, invest? Because Dish is going after a huge market as an outside-chance new entrant. That is an exciting story that is backed up with enough funding, spectrum, and starting point market share to make it the most extravagant story in US and world ICT. Some will think Dish is a wild shot with the cards stacked against them despite having maneuvered into an unusually leveraged situation. Others will think Dish has waited, through chance or design, probably a bit of both, until the mainstream wireless technology platform, 4G-Advanced-->5G, has advanced to make use of vast new array of spectrum to step-wise build a more creative and cost-effective ICT (mobile plus all other stuff) platform that can deliver service to customers at about a 40% lower cost than upgrades/overlay of 5G to incumbent networks.Who is right? Both could be. So much depends on execution that I can’t predict the outcome. The deep understanding of the enabling technologies and supply ecosystem show that Dish has a chance to upset the incumbents to gain a share of the huge mobile/ICT market as it expands to become the kingpin platform for computing, AI/data aggregation, media, gaming, social whatever and then some. Having a lower cost of production of corn flakes offers limited chances for market disruption. Having a lower cost and most flexible platform for delivery of wireless services and content can be a mercurial factor for market disruption but it has to be carried out with insight and no big missteps. Dish appears to be approaching this correctly: first focusing on building a 5G NR core network, then the market-driven 5G NR SAN, stand-alone network. Dish’s advantage over incumbents is that it can build the new ground-up platform without the need to plop it down on top of existing 3G-4G compatible core and WRAN. That gives Dish the ability to build the network as a virtualized, highly signaling efficient network using CRAN, centralized radio access, DRAN, distributed RAN, or a mix of the two on a best-fit bases.This very diverse set of difficulties vs. possibilities is likely to result in DISH, the stock, being more volatile than most stocks. And that is why it shoots up in the ranks as a stock for short-term and trend traders and, as the prospects get fleshed out, maybe investors."
"DISH is down almost 50% from is 12-month high and has hit a support level. The stock is short-term very oversold and due for a rebound. DISH is likely to remain highly volatile, which makes it a ‘trading vehicle’ stock. Two reasons for that is the company has entered the arena to build out its own networks and grab mobile and media-mobile market share which opens the stock up to a broader investment/trading audience. The other reason is that DISH is playing with the fire of taking on the role of a major MVNO, building networks, populating them, competing with media-satellite-mobile and mobile network home broadband which is unknown territory for the mobile startup. DISH is also pursuing the 5G cloud-centric approach to building networks. While that is what 5G was designed to deliver, it deviates from the legacy approach and has not been proven to surmount competitive obstacles. DISH is among the pioneers trying to carve out a place in a relatively mature landscape dominated by well capitalized MNOs. Churn rates have dropped in recent years to 1 or less except for Sprint which will be folded into New T-Mobile on April 1st. That means DISH must be very aggressive with their packages and prices to tear off subscribers. T-Mobile will be trying to do the same thing except they come at it from a different mix of strengths including market image and sales momentum.DISH can be used as a trading vehicle that is likely to have higher volatility than other ICT stocks."
"Now, when it's obvious that Elon & SpaceX destroyed not just their legacy biz, but otherwise promising 5G venture too, their only chance is to make 360 degree turn and try to revitalize Blockbuster brand & stores. Maybe by focus on categories which are not covered by streaming giants."
"rumor has it that amazon is buying dish, and will make the announcement on feb 14th. dish owns boost mobile, so once amazon acquires dish, they will be launching a telecommunications service that will offer 1200 streaming channels, internet, and cell service service for about $120 a month."

The longer-term prospects for building 5G networks, growing mobile and broadband services market share will challenge and costly. However, the bulk of the financial constraints because of additional capital needed and risks of venturing into the mobile and other business areas will not start until 2-3 years after the deal kicks off. In the meantime, DISH will have a good chance to ride on the coattails of NewTM."

"Amazon appears to be out of contention while Comcast and Charter have only been mentioned as having participated in talks. Comcast has said they do not want to acquire Spectrum from NewTM/Sprint. It looks like DISH is the most likely buyer of Boost and spectrum. However, this remains speculation because it is based on leaked information that remains in flux. Amazon was a less likely candidate for a deal: NewTM may have wanted them to buy Boost because the company would have been very unlikely to build its own network to compete head-to-head. And that would give NewTM a partner that would develop devices tuned to their network. The main part could be that Amazon would build Cloud5G services that place storage-servers deep into the wireless network to reduce latency and improve network throughput. The cloud services aspect of this was mostly ignored. The problem with Amazon is that it may not have been able to satisfy the DoJ's demand for change in the market structure.DISH can better satisfy the market structure requirement. The deal now appears to hinge on the details that amount to how DISH could integrate Boost/MVNO customers onto its own network and collaborate with NewTM on network build and co-use. The ideal situation would be for DISH to take over the account control and be able to sell access to the network they would build that NewTM customers use on a best-available basis. That way, DISH would be able to expand their own network into new territory more affordable. However, that scenario is unlikely to be agreed to by NewTM. Ergen must try to get as accommodating a set of customer and network control issues settled in DISH's favor as he can, pressuring NewTM with the requirement that a 4th leg competitor deal must be done to gain approval."
"DISH has moved about 65% higher than the lows of December, 2018, a worthy gain. The upward trend remains in place and shows buy-accumulate with the caveat of placing price-following stop-loss orders for protection. The chart shows swings in the price between weekly lows and highs of about 5% with rare dips of up to 11%. The stock is on the list of those impacted by the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint that include TMUS, S, SFTBY. Deutsche Telekom (DTEGY) has moved up modestly in recent weeks but the merger is less likely to impact the stock."
Does this testimony prove the case? Dish can get funding and Sprint cant? I think it helps the states case that the only reason Sprint is merging is to eliminate competition. Ergen proved their case that there is funding available for Sprint. If a startup can get funding an established player should be able to get funding. I think it hurt the case and then when the merger is not approved what happens to Dish?
"I keep reading articles about Dish's demise as though they are a subscription only satellite company with no other compelling assets yet they have a ""treasure cove"" of valuable spectrum that would make Clearwire shareholders blush even though they were taken out of the game by Sprint right before Softbank took over Sprint not that long ago. Some including myself peg the spectrum assets to be worth $35 pps so you are getting the satellite biz including its subscription free cash flows for FREE. imo"

I wouldn't even recommend Dish to my worst enemy or my ex wife. I don't know how I got into some kind of thing with them that I didn't get a copy of something that was supposed to keep my dish price the same until 2/9/22 and every month I'm getting a different bill. I want to know how I can get a better TV deal and out of this company as soon as possible. If you hate some one try and get them to get dish tv.
Someone posted on another board that AMZN is partnering with DISH (Boost) to launch a new nationwide 5G cellular phone service to compete with VZ and T.
Forget about low margin RAN contracts. $ERIC and Samsung are low balling bids in a fight over market share. Nokia has removed themselves from such situations. The real money is going to be made upgrading network core infrastructure and providing the software to access it. Virtualization of the RAN to move computation to the cloud will remove all that heat and power traditional RAN generate. RAN processing will occur in climate controlled data centers. Huawai and ERIC edge in RAN will be reduced because of this shift. If you have no idea what I am talking about then Google Rakuten and $DISH new mobile phone service. Core hardware and software have much better margins than RAN. Margin improvement is the #1 goal of $NOK right now.

"America is being told The BIG Lie by the opponents to the merger:The Biggest lie that is being perpetrated by opponents to the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint is that this works to increase prices to rural, other under-served and disadvantaged segments of the American public. They base this lie on a very simplistic understanding of the market that appeals to the ignorance of public on a very complex subject.The merger will cause the combining of market share and spectrum that lowers the cost of providing service to each individual consumer. How could that be otherwise? The BIG Lie is that when you reduce the two small operators, Sprint with 1 out of 10 customers and T-Mobile with 1 out of 6 customers, that the rural customers will see an increase in their bills. That only makes sense to those too ignorant or lazy to think about it: Sprint tried to lure customers with low prices only to dig a deeper financial money pit. T-Mobile has a large amount of low-band spectra that have more capacity already deployed than they can fill in the near term. That results in each of their 1 out of 6 customers (18% market share). spreading the cost of the duplicative. After a transition period, the two companies combined customers will achieve a higher density of about 29% (including the 9 million wholesale MVNO subs sold to Dish). That is almost 1 out of 3 mobile users in the USA. New T-Mobile will have more customers to afford to build 5G networks and services. Only wonk economists visiting from Bizarro World, (the opponents including the CWA brain trust, snicker), can compose this into the BIG Lie to spin out to the media hacks and public. The BIG Lie goes further: The economics of wireless and converged ICT communications has gone from theory to practice: For every one job within the wireless industry there are seven to 9 jobs created in companies outside of the industry. Name one business today that does not enjoy the ability for customers to find out about their products and services, find and travel to their location, buy from them, have the goods or service delivered, and have after sale support that is made by mobile service. There probably are but a few. NewTM will build a new competitive field for applications and services on 5G. The treat is that China and several other countries will create the 5G marketplace and applications-service environment that will propel the next 'Google', 'Facebook', 'Amazon' and Netflix' explosive growth opportunities outside of America unless America is among the first countries to deploy.The BIZG Lie is being told by rural wireless operators who lack scale. The rural WISPs have floundered for years unable to build the critical mass for fixed Wireless Broadband Access, WBA. As a result, the cost of fixed rural broadband is high while the coverage being provided is less than 5% of the US population. Many WISPs have gone out of business as 4G had become available because their prices were two to three times higher. If customers could get a 4G signal, it became preferable even thought they needed if an additional broadband plan. That was because those customers had mobile service regardless of whether they had a fixed wireless service. The mobile service can replace fixed service but not the other way around. Now that 5G is prepared to use a combination of mmWave to provide Gigabit wireless for cell interconnect (backhaul/front haul), the midband for high-speed video and home broadband, and low-band for pervasive coverage and high bandwidth in low-density/rural areas, the highly inefficient rural fixed wireless operators are screaming like half-dead roadkill. The opponents are spreading the BIG Lie and the politicians are clamoring on their shoulders to get into the limelight because they are about to get run over by a fast-moving train. The problem they have is that their BIG Lie campaign is obvious to those who take the time to study the issues. The impact is complex, and that is why this has taken well over a year to come to a set of agreements. The CWA has had many inputs to the FCC, DoJ, Congress and have mounted a big public relations campaign... there has been nothing like it in over 40 years. That is because the wireless industry is among the biggest unionized industries. And it is rapidly converging and becoming mature and more efficient so that fewer jobs within the industry will be needed. Sorry, but that is a fact. How do we know that? Because AT&T and Verizon have been shedding jobs as they have acquired companies. They have shed over 30,000 jobs in recent years. Sprint has also shed jobs, not because it has been on a similar acquisition spree as the Duoplists but because it has had to compete with T and VZ with only 1 out of 10 customers to spread the cost of doing business. People need to know of the BIG Lie that is being spread like manure on the American landscape. Tell your friends and associates that the American public is"
"Dish Network (Nasdaq: DISH) is entering the U.S. wireless market as the fourth nationwide network competitor, thanks to the Department of Justice officially giving its OK on a deal that cleared the way for T-Mobile and Sprint to merge. The DOJ announced on Friday morning that it and the Attorneys General for five states reached a settlement with T-Mobile (Nasdaq: TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE: S), giving its approval for that merger. The terms call for T-Mobile and Sprint to divest Sprint’s prepaid business — including Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile and Sprint prepaid — to Dish."
"DISH is looking to ditch its satellite TV business. There are no new satellites in the pipeline. That leaves their spectrum, that they will have to sell or lease - which just makes DISH a spectrum leasing company. There is no clear path for DISH, so dump it."
"Who is Going to Use the 12 GHz Band - 5G, Starlink, or Both?""Current users of the 12 GHz band are Dish and DirecTV, which use the band for their Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) television services.

Currently, Dish holds 12 GHz band licenses that cover around 75% of the U.S. population."" ""C-band that has so far raised $80.9 billion!""Yeah baby..."

"As an unhappy Dish satellite customer getting ready to cancel service, why would anyone buy this stock?"

"DISH's Sling TV finished the fourth quarter and 2020 in general with 2.47 million subscribers. Still less than the legacy satellite subscribers. However, the satellite business will have one last group of customers that will have to stay (and even pay ripoff rates): ""rural"" customers. If you're in a remote area, there is no cable (not economic to run coaxes for sparsely populated areas). If there isn't even a phone (yes I know people who live in a forest and there are NO untilities) then you have no choice, if you want TV you have to pay DISH. Maybe there are 1 or 2 million households like this? After all the other switch to internet TV (SLING) then DISH can quadruple the subscription fees for those who have no choice. We're not there yet. So meanwhile, SLING will add high profit margin subscribers, and the legacy satellite will shed low profit margin subscribers. Profits will probably stay strong and cover the expenses of building the new 5G cellular business. Meanwhile, Google and Amazon (among other giants) re waiting to see some tangible success, and could jump in with a takeover offer of $60/share."

"Sold Short a lot of shares of DISH just before the close on Friday, at an average price of $41.98. I normally seek out seriously over-valued stocks for my Pure Earnings Short Sell plays. And DISH does not currently qualify as being over-valued. And yet...I could not pass up this play, because being a trader for decades I have a keen understanding of how technology stocks are treated by the stock market. Every technology has a life cycle. It bursts into public consciousness, gains popularity, becomes popular and is embraced. then slowly fades out as something apparently better, or at least more interesting, comes along. DISH is currently beginning a slow fade-out. There is no return once such a fade-out begins. And the stock market is very unkind to tech stocks once a consensus is reached among the general public that a specific technology is on the way out. I perceive Monday morning's ER as potentially being the ""breaking point"" by which the market as a whole decides that DISH technology has no viable medium-long term future. This could be triggered by weak EPS or Revenue numbers, or weak/no Guidance going forward. And if that happens, a 5-12% collapse in stock price is quite likely. Do I wish this puppy was more over-valued going into the trade?? Of course. But even if they modestly beat consensus EPS and Revenue estimates for this past quarter, all the warning signs going forward are still in place, and it is hard for me to envision the stock going up much, if at all. Happy to be Short on this dinosaur and eagerly awaiting the price action tomorrow. :-)"

How much of Dish's spectrum is compromised by their recent deal with AT&T?
Dish is an asset play not a business play. Ergne has been hoarding spectrum for years. Satellite TV is dying and DISH will never have enough horsepower to become a player in telecom. They will have to sell out but the anti trust cops will be hot on their tail.
Dish needs to give spectrum back as they have wasted to much time
"Does anyone think DISH will use its spectrum buys to roll out 10gb 5G networks in the biggest cities, bundled with SlingTV to crush the cable/telecom industry monopolies? The satellite delivery market is shrinking, FIOS is too expensive, and compared to 5G will be slow. Figure each Verizon subscriber pays $120-$180/month, Sling probably averages $25/month per sub, they could easily price unlimited 5G for less to replace their satellite base in cities, but still retain satellite customers in rural locations.It is estimated 5G will start rolling out in 2019 and Dish gobbled up a ton of spectrum. What are people's thoughts?"
"DISH dropped precipitously over the past days from its highs. What could investors have done to lock in gains? Investors should place price-following stop-loss orders on their holdings immediately after acquiring the stock. There are various stop-loss orders: some place sell orders when a stock drops by more than a set amount, usually determined as exceeding the normal trading range. More sophisticated algorithms take into account the momentum, price x volume, and other factors. These are price-following so that as the stock price moves up the order will be triggered at a higher price level.What would have happened with the recent drop? If we look at the chart it is easy to see that the price shot up and then closed near its lows a couple days ago. The volume was about twice the norm and the range of movement far exceeded what is normal for DISH. Unless the investor set the limits absurdly wide, they have sold the holding at the 42-43 price level, locking in almost all of the profits to the high. The investor might now consider buying back at about a 10% lower price."
"The beaten down Merger List, TMUS, S, DISH, SFTBY have become short-term extremely oversold technical buys today. However, buy on the upside not the downside. Do that by using program trading algos which we also call conditional trades. Follow with conditional sell orders that trace the price to the upside and sell when the movement of price-volume to the downside has exceeded the norms. The theme remains: Buy-accumulate on dips."
The big hope for DISH is that 4G-5G broadband cable replacement mounted by New T-Mobile will force Verizon or AT&T to acquire DISH's spectra to build a network capable of nationwide service. The combination of spectra-networks that T-Mobile+Sprint plan to develop will up the ante for VZ and T to add to their low-mid band spectra.

"If Amazon acquired Boost Mobile from NewTM they should be able to operate it at a profit because that is what analysts figure the Boost unit within Sprint is doing. Boost has been a minor but among the only bright spots in Sprint's business. It reportedly gained some subscribers recently.Besides operating a low-margin retailer of mobile services, what might Amazon want with Boost Mobile? The MVNO business has lower margins, low growth, limited upside potential... it is not the worst dog at the pound but it is not going to be put to death soon. Nor is Boost destined to grow beyond its bounds of buying-in wholesale wireless service and selling it to the public as prepaid service for a modest margin. If you black-boxed the financials of the MVNOs and then diagramed the envelope of the limitations to where they might find growth in the business model, the MVNOs are sickly little puppies compared to Amazon's mainstream businesses.However, the prospects for 5G create challenges for Amazon and other broad Internet service companies that have cloud services as part of their underpinnings: 5G is a highly virtualizable, multi-dimensional network architecture that will compete against current fiber-optic-based services. The wireless carriers are expected to deploy cloud services infrastructure along with tower companies and others. The network environment has matured to a point that a shift is taking place in which the development platforms for Internet and mobile device applications has become the focus of success. If Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft, Alibaba etc. are to grow along with 5G ICT, they must deploy distributed storage-server facilities and take greater roles in the development platforms. They have recognized this which is why Amazon has been saying that they wish to take a greater role in AI software and chips, apps development environment, and infrastructure. I don't think that Amazon necessarily wants to acquire Boost Mobile but they probably feel that they must do more to become involved in 5G rollouts or else will witness carriers and other firms moving on their turf. You could say much the same for Google, however, G/Alphabet if the leading mobile phone etc. device OS and apps environment already. They have a better position to leverage.The other reason is that while Boost is not the most exciting of investments for Amazon, it won't likely become a problem and offers a way for Amazon to work more intimately with New T-Mobile in the rollout of 5G. While NewTM will have approximate parity in market scale in the mainstream retail market, it will be a minority player in enterprise, cloud service platform, advertising, AI, and Big Data. Wireless carriers are big screwups in OS and software development platforms. T-Mobile does better at that because it has had to. However, T-Mobile should welcome a deal in which Amazon would present a unified front as the go-to cloud services platform with AI and among the best Big Data resources to pull from. For those reasons, if the rumors are true that Amazon is interested in a deal with DOJ and NewTM to acquire Boost, then it can make a lot of sense."
"It looks like my previous post was removed so I'll try this one more time. I cancelled my subscription to Dish Network today, three months after they dropped the NBC Sports Bay Area Channels. I had been a Dish Network subscriber for over 20 years and think they made a big mistake in dropping the NBC Sports Bay Area channels. I complained to Dish and they said they dropped the channels because of increased costs and that most Dish subscribers didn't watch these channels anyway. I strongly disagree and had to switch to YouTubeTV to get my local sports teams: SF Giants, Golden State Warriors, and San Jose Sharks. I see that Dish lost 230,000 subscribers in the first quarter: Sling lost 100,000 and Dish Network lost 130,000. I'm betting that the lost subscribers for the second quarter will be much worse that lost in the first quarter due to the loss of the NBC Sports Bat Area channels on April 1st, 2021. I guess we will find out on August 9th when Dish reports their second quarter earning if anybody besides me was watching NBC Sports Bay Area."
Don't sign up for dish. Can't depend on getting local channels.
$40 this month?
15 Whales that control $26 Billion Held over $500 Million of DISH stock. I would be very careful investing DISH. So Far The Hedge Funds are Down over 27% this year.
"At this low PRICE..... Dish is in a position for a HOSTILE TAKE OVER....With the value in the Spectrum (Not currently being used) - this would still yeild a high price for share holders.Possible buyers: Verizon, Amazon, Disney, Netflix, Google"
Wouldn't DISH's bandwidth be a good match for either TMUS or AMZN? Those two seem to have a decent relationship with each other and with DISH...
This broad market crash has been a great opportunity to buy more dish without pushing the price above $40. Keep selling. Thanks!
"DISH is going to see lower stock prices as the business declines and no buyers of the spectrum emerge. DISH is very unlikely to receive the premium price for the spectrum it holds as many investors have come to expect. The satellite business will be the first to see steep declines in revenue that will occur over the next five years. The next to fall will be the cable operators. It is not that these alternatives to mobile broadband will evaporate, just that they will see sharp declines in revenue as has never been experienced in the past and for which there is no escape."
Big overreaction to downgrade - Dish and any other buyer would have strong leverage to get a great deal for the assets.
Any clues as to what 5G will do for Dish or Satellite radio? New birds going up next year I heard.
Dish should change their name to blockbuster. All of us millennials would be buying into this. Dish owns blockbuster bb liquidation
About to go bullish; hope you got those calls in before 40. Despite what the Gains Goblin says this morning keep an eye on this. Will fluctuate a lot in the coming days; keep an eye on the moving average relative to the S&P for added faith and let us pray.
"If Amazon buys boost mobile, they will try to buy all the spectrum they can get to setup their own carrier, I wonder who has spectrum just sitting there waiting on a buyer? Dish stock will double soon"
"Satellite is dead, long live streaming. SLING is hands down the best streaming service out there - fast, great user interface. They haven't done their packages properly though. They should switch to a higher granularity of a-la-carte choosing of channels.DISH is progressing towards being an Internet Service Provider and streaming over it, but this will take a year before we see any offerings for their 5G delivery, and then it will be only in major markets to start.I think DISH will survive all this, but it will be rough going over the next year. They really need to ensure 5G rollout, and they need to do something to make SLING more attractive to streamers, they got a jump start on competition and it really IS the best one out there, but they need to fix the package offerings to optimize revenue from it."
"I think if Ergen were Musk, his stock price would be at about $340 price per share at about this time. IMO"
This deal only make sense if Dish can partner with a FANG for buildout and marketing.
"perhaps a stretch here, but on Synacor board is Marwan Fawzeh, he is very in on Google Nest products, which also has alliance with Dish, which Synacor has, perhaps this news article is good for Synacor ?DISH introduces Google Nest Hello to the Hopper platform https://seekingalpha.com/pr/17734518?source=ansh $DISH"
DISH should double over the next 12 months if they play this right...
$Dish down almost 7% now. The market Apparently doesn’t have confidence in Dish ability as the ‘ Fourth ‘ carrier.
Wow this thing is going fall like a rock after news. The valuation is through the roof and has built nothing. The have no customers at this point and have build a whole network and priced higher than the big 3.
"Today the market crashed, but DISH is up 5%.Maybe more people are discovering our secret underpriced jewel?Also, I heard some talk about Verizon wanting to buy out DISH in order to take out the cellular phone competition and grab our valuable spectrum."
"What the media is not telling is how much Hedge Fund managers are loosing trading *short* #TSLA #AMZN #CMG #DISH #AAPL #NFLX. I know for a fact that some of these guys are sleeping over night, paying lots of money ( $500-$2000 G) for the big media like TWSJ, Bloomberg, CNBC,etc to create stories to drive the #TSLA stock down so they can cover them selves. I am not long or short here. I go with the trade ! I can not wait for the last chapter of this historic moments ! Good luck !"
"DISH looks technically oversold. The sharp sell off has pegged some indicators which sets up a rebound in the price. DISH may remain much more volatile than is normal for a while. Mid-term price prospects:DISH will be taking on additional expenses associated to gearing up for the merger. These include increased legal, staffing, outside consultants, and facilities costs that Dish will incur prior to the merger side-deal agreement with Dish. Once closed, Dish will have higher operating costs offset by higher revenues from the MVNO acquisitions. During the first two years, Dish will have $1-2 billion additional capital spending. Most of this will be on the core network that is a baseline requirement before building wireless connectivity networks. Dish must lease or build fiber optic and wireless backhaul. Operators typically do this on a site-by-site basis but may incur general outlays. Longer-termDish will need to spend $10 or more billion to build a nationwide 5G networks that fulfills agreed coverage requirements. This figure is lower than is normally spend on similar scale networks. The plan calls for using a new virtual cloud network architecture that hopes to reduce costs by 40% or more compared to conventional builds. Some savings are likely but the prospects remain unproven at this scale. Other operators around the world who have taken up the approach may provide indications of whether the cost projections are valid. Even then, those cost savings must be scale-tested in USA deployments to be valid.Given the above, the prospects for Dish will likely pivot on the two at-odds factors: higher capital spend and operating costs vs. ability to grow near and long-term revenues to compensate. The costs will impact earnings negatively until revenues and profits ramp to overtake them. The counter to that is the growth in future revenues and profits the investments are expected to generate. If successful, the company will achieve higher sales, higher profits, more diverse revenues, and ability to expand beyond the current and near-term confines. It is uncertain whether the market will accept a much higher P/E multiple over the 2-5 years following the merger that it will take."

"DISH looks technically extremely oversold, made a double-bottom, the candlesticks, three-day range narrowing, MACD, stochastic, modestly positive accumulation are bullish. The COZVID-19 influence is powerful, however, DISH looks likely to bounce off of this level unless the floor drops out on the market 'bigly'. this has a 10%-18% upside trade potential imo. Use program trades with stop-loss follow on orders."
DISH Network is up 10.58% to 25.82
"If DISH is gonna take a serious nosedive today, it will happen towards the end of the current Conference Call, or in the 1-2 ET PM hour. Staying Short with all my shares and watching to see what happens. Will move on to my next Pure Earnings Short Sell later this afternoon, and I have my pick narrowed down to either HE or NOVT. Leaning towards HE right now, that one is over-valued and overdue for a significant price dip."
What’s Ergen going to say if Amazon calls in ?
spectrum inflation yet stock less than it was 5 years ago
"DISH is reported to be preparing for a fresh round of RFPs/RFIs, this time targeted at fiber and other support for networks. DISH's advantage and disadvantage stems from the same fact: DISH starts out building its network from the ground up. The is a momentous task requiring large up-front investments before the company's own network turns a dime. However, DISH has far fewer legacy contraints on what to build. They can use the more efficient and estimated 40% cheaper stand-alone 5G New Radio, 5G NR, approach to help bridge the gap between the mobile startup and entrenched competitors. DISH can also target the sweet spots that fit its own evolving capabilities, thus achieving more direct ROI."

"Thinking of buying some shares, any opinions of their future?"
"Quote from Verizon 5G article: ""Moreover, all of its competitors face massive capital expenditures to build their networks.""AT&T and TMO are already behind Verizon, regarding 5G networks.Can DISH even hope to compete? Will DISH have the pocket$ to invest in a network.Telecomm networks require continous investment. 2G...3G...LTE...5G.... T1 lines....mircowave... Fiber....A viable competitor to: VZ, At&T, TMO must continuously invest in the network.I am not sure DISH has the know how or resources to build a viable cellular network."
"DISH is 'structure rich, capital poor':Charlie Ergen/DISH has put together spectra, media, device, and service operations 'on the cheap' compared to the incumbent mobile/ICT operators. While DISH says to have spent $21 billion for spectra and around $10 billion on other acquisitions over years, its new competitors have spent more than that in a single year just on spectra. Competitors routinely spend around $30-35 billion on network deployments and upgrades. When DISH made a spoiler bid for Sprint, the BOD threw it out as being 'insufficient'. That was partly because DISH could not afford to invest billions more into Sprint while having money left over to use its own spectra to build 4G-5G. If would have been rich in the raw strucural materials but too poor in capital to use them to good advantage. The DISH-NewTM deal will further enrich DISH's strategic asset position but will leave it with much lower marketshare, capital and cash flows needed to gain a national coverage footprint. DISH will not be able to roll out its own nationwide network in just a few years.The way DISH must approach building networks and going after marketshare is similar to the way they have gone after spectra and company acquisitions: 'tight and strategic'. DISH will have opportunities to innovate in networks, devices and services but will have to spend every dollar wisely."
I think this stock is way undervalued. This stock should sore and with all the broadband and now the cellphone business it is buying this stock will go nothing but up.

I think Dish will rise tomorrow with the merger of Spring and Tmobile. Can't help but benefit
"T-Mobile announced preliminary results for the quarter that show an increase of 1.9 million and 7 million new subscribers for the year. Meanwhile, Sprint's performance has seen sub-par growth and financial results. This widens the gap between T-Mobile and Sprint that adds to the argument that the exchange ratio should be adjusted to accommodate the shift in relative valuations of the two companies over the past 19 months. Sprint continued to consolidate its Virgin Mobile customers to the Boost Mobile brand in preparation for the court approval of the merger. DISH's Ergen gave an outline of where the company will be headed once the merger approval is finalized. I anticipate heavy promotional efforts of the new converged mobile and satellite plans soon after they announce the favorable court decision.Meanwhile, the 'merger stocks' are likely to remain in a state of limbo untill a decision is delivered or firm indications leak."
Don't count Charlie out. He is crafty and does not intend to loose money. Haven't kept up but thought Dish controlled some prime spectrum rights.
"Where is DISH headed in the near term? A lot about DISH's new business model is yet to be proven: the audacious plans to enter the capital-intensive, saturated mobile marketplace starting as an MVNO through the T-Mobile+Sprint merger deal will be challenging and must establish new precedents for use of 5G and beyond technologies to build networks more cost effectively than incumbent competitors. On paper, the rationale of the new business formula makes sense ... with the big caveat that it is executed well. The plan is fairly straight forward: use the culmination of wireless and virtualized network technologies to build DISH’s own 5G NR network at a cost that is, in theory, about 40% less expensive to build and maintain than the amalgam of legacy networks operated by competitors. If the theoretical advantages of the ‘network forward’, Open RAN approach proves to be valid within the constraints of the US geographic market, DISH should be able to take market share by offering lower prices or more for less packages of broadband-mobile-media services. There will not be much room for mistakes. The plan appears simplified because the consumers DISH needs are established. However, they are the customers of competitors - DISH must take them in a market in which churn rates have dropped to an average of about 1%. That leaves many questions: - Can DISH keep or add onto the MVNO customers they get from New T-Mobile? - Will the unexperienced DISH be able to build an O-RAN 5G NR network cost effectively?- Will lower prices be countered by competitors well enough to deter profits?There will be points at which these and other questions will be answered. That leaves room for swings in speculation until enough of the picture comes together to root the new business model on firm ground."
AMZN rumor on buying Dish and CTL to create operating system platform to compete with android and use the network to expand Alexa gadgets.
"To ""Jim"" / ""Juiceman"":My advice, cover your short now in the low 30's before you get margin called in the 60's. Because you're not getting my shares under $65/share.Meanwhile, DISH is increasing the profits riding the ""cord cutting"" wave. SLING is the best TV streaming service, and I can't wait for the end of this year when DISH 5G cellular phone service joins ATT, Verizon, and T-mobile club. Qualcomm just added DISH frequency to its radio chip. New handsets will support DISH. That's the last straw needed to break the ATT/Verizon/T-Mobile triopoly."
$Dish up 3.5% on no news.
"Dish has gone out for a broad RFI/P, request for information/Proposals for the build of its core 5G network, components, devices, etc. This is a 'let's see what you've got' open-ended request to see the best products, concepts, devices, deployment methods, future product vision, evolution of networks and business models, etc. The various parts of the supply ecosystem are likely to respond. Dish says it is looking at the experiences of incumbent and new market entrants including Rakuten which is deploying the first large-scale cloud-native 5G NR network. Dish lists Rakuten on a preliminary vendor list so we may see them develop common suppliers that would help arrive at lower costs and more participation among vendors."
any news today?
This stock was $15 in 2012. I think that this will provide strong support. Should not see it fall below $15.
"DISH's SLING is less an on-demand streaming service as it is a paid advertising side-channel service. How does SLING compare in content, ease of use, advanced features including using AI to better tailor viewing suggestions compared to OTT leaders NetFlix, Amazon Prime, HuLu etc. I think opinions largely depend on what the consumer has grown used to. If you are what used to be 'typical', a channel surfer or you often share recorded video, SLING may remain attractive. However, that denies users the full freedom to watch all content when they want it. SLING also adheres to the channel-content advertising model: DISH does not author the content and does not get to embed their own advertising or to cut out the embedded ads. DISH has a good consumer rating compared to the cable companies. New competition for streaming of channelized TV and Pay TV include YouTube TV and DirectTV. That adds to the companies primarily offering on-demand content. The company recently announced a cut in the price of its basic SLING package from $25 to $15 per month for a 3-month period, then back up to $25/month. I believe that the channel content and embedding of ads is a dinosaur. It may take several years to become a corpse, but the signs are clear. Once consumers have rural broadband options, they will flee for the greater power of OTT and fewer and shorter ads."

Whatsup with DISH? Missed earnings and still soaring up which is actually great for investors hanging on it. Whats up with the up trend....5G?
"Spectrum is only as valuable as 1. It can be sold for, or 2. the value based on ROI from building networks to use it to earn revenue. Thus far there is no network, no apparent detailed plans to build one, no partners willing to help and no buyers. This has combined with weak sales to a stock price that is near multiple-year lows.Charlie = the guy who plays poker. As every poker player knows, timing is critical. At the time Softbank acquired Sprint+Clearwire, I wrote an article that showed a dingy in the ocean with a cruise ship. The dingy had the label DISH edited onto it while the cruise ship had Sprint-Softbank. Around the dingy, I photoshopped some sharks. That image looks appropriate today with a revision showing the cruise ship headed for the dingy with the label changed to New T-Mobile.Good luck Charlie."
Dish may partner with Amazon for 5G services. Pls google it. Dish may get flight tomorrow!
"The heyday for DISH is over. Even IF they successfully roll out their 5G plans, it won't be the huge bang/driver that will make up for the decline of Satellite TV market."

This is the biggest hyped stock on the market. This about the chance to make money once they get the spectrum rights. They are valued more than Sprint which has a network and owns spectrum. If this deal goes through or not this is a short paradise play.
"Some hedge funds are actively accumulating DISH stock. The theory for the investment is two-fold: DISH will see growth as an inevitable outcome of the deal secured as the enabling ingredient to the T-Mobile+Sprint merger. The first part of the investment thesis is that DISH will see a direct financial and operational expansion stemming from the merger.That provides ‘insurance’ in that hedge funds can buy DISH on that expectation without having to justify the investment based on longer-term strategic or competition results. There is a certain amount of the growth that will come about as a matter or course: DISH will gain sales and subscribers from the acquisition of Sprint’s MVNOs and the additional leverage with existing satellite and OTT customers. This mix of customers can be cross sold services at attractive prices due to the favorable terms of the agreement. If DISH does not grow with that wind at their backs, then we must be in a world-wide depression of catastrophic proportions.The long-term prospects look reasonably favorable. This takes execution and is vulnerable to the competitive response. However, the ‘number add up’ for the plan. It is unlikely that Verizon and AT&T will convert from dividend-paying companies who treat wireless as the mature, cash-flow cow that it is to them. Investors would crucify management if they changed stripes.Correlation among technical indicators:TMUS and S both show strong relative accumulation of the stocks that has diverged from the stock prices. This supports the accumulation of stock by hedge funds and vice versa.What about market weakness and the recent stock price slide? These are factors to have considered in setting trades but are meaningless in the overall picture. These have no mid to long-term impact.."

"DISH is not dead, but Charlie's firm is wounded.DISH was behind some of the feeble opposition to the NewTM merger in hopes of having more parties to play poker with. That game has cashed out with DISH holding the losing hand until/unless the merger puts a thorn under the saddle of Verizon or AT&T to acquire spectra or otherwise put DISH's iceberg of spectra to use."
"I don’t see the appeal of Dish building out 5G. They’d be entering an extraordinarily competitive space (increasingly lower margins) with opponents with far better access to capital. The only asset Dish appears to have worth buying is spectrum. To acquire their spectrum, a company must either buy or merge with Dish. An acquisition carries a rather high premium with something like $16B in debt and a dead pay for TV platform (except sling); merging would reward shareholders very little.So what is the investment thesis here? Maybe someone can enlighten me..."

"Good morning, first post in the Dish tribe....curious on what fiber assets Dish owns? They will need it for 5G FTTT, mid-haul, and back-haul. Do they partner with someone?"
Somethings up . Dish is on the radar folks
"DISH/Ergen opposed the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. I can partly understand why: a combined company needs less spectrum and offers fewer opportunities to partner or M&A with DISH. Ergen has lost that battle and NewTM will gain the approval of the DOJ after the last round of concessions/changes to the merger agreement IMO. Now that the merger is almost assured, DISH may find that the prospects for selling off its terrestrial network spectra have improved. Verizon and AT&T, Duopolists that they are, will be more likely to be given the green light by DOJ to add spectrum to their portfolios because it will not change the competitive structure of the industry by as much in light of a stronger 3rd competitor versus the two weaker ones. Within two years NewTM should shake up the status quo enough that VZ and T divert some of the cash-cow mobile profits back to beefing up their networks."
This is not a safe investment and definetly for the gambler. The problem is not even good odds that Dish will strike a deal.
"I Craig Moffett right to change his recommendation to sell DISH? From a financial analysis point of view that focuses on a quarter-by-quarter performance basis, Moffett is more right than wrong. However, if the new DISH play book story catches on, the stock can be speculated higher because much larger market oppotunities are exposed. Everyone should understand that DISH has no current retail mobile business or networks. This is blue sky that while full of new potential is also full of a lot of wishful thinking that must be overtaken by unreasonbly great performance. Otherwise, DISH may well be trying to do the impossible - build their own network capacity and fill it in the face of an already mature, saturated market. It theoretically can be done but is a long shot.Why might Craig be overly persimistic? The PR admits that DISH may benefit from the NewTM deal but investors likely won't. That admits that investors are primarily focued on the short-mid term time periods while the company has to be focused over 5-10 year time horizons for the capital investments to work out. In the meantime, the stock will remain a speculation on future ROI. And that will depend on DISH's ability to beat the larger foxes to the hen house. DISH will need to come up with better use of 4G-5G networks and devices than the larger companies. They can do that if they are clever. DISH does not necessarily have to be smarter or have other advantages over competitors. The path to success is keeping costs lower and more tightly focused. For example, there are plenty of home routers on the market and the ability to have them modified to meet the spectrum bands and deployment goals of DISH without the need to design from the ground up. If DISH is clever, they can use them to deliver 5G Home broadband cost effectively. If they fail to understand how to get that done, the deployments can turn into losses. The new CTO looks like a reasonably good choice but as yet unproven. The point for now is investors should be treating DISH for what it will soon become, a specultaive blue sky trading vehicle and unproven as a longer-term investment. This is far from a buy and hold retirement stock for lazy investors."
