Montereyred : Let me know when the stock gets back to issue price. I have 14 shares to unload. Or now if there are any takers at that price!!
"Viatris' bottom line could improve, though, as it achieves cost synergies from the Upjohn-Mylan merger. Its sales should also pick up momentum within the next few years as it launches new products. For investors who prize both income and value, Viatris is definitely a stock to consider."
This is all related to options.7878 puts (equal to 787.800 shares) at $14.50 expire on Friday.
WOW — 150M revenue beat and raised guidance by 500M for the year. Huge top line beat .98 cents per sh v .88 consensus. Also the insulin drug genetic is us. Huge — management’s narrative is turning into reality.
Hurry sell more I need to be all in before Monday Aug 9 before the bell VTRS earnings then the ex dividend right after earnings
One giant leap.
"From Novartis’ Q2 earnings press release (numbers for the first half 2021):QUOTE— H1 sales grew +3% (cc, +7% USD) and core operating income grew +2% (cc, +6% USD)— Innovative Medicines sales grew +5 (cc,+9% USD) and core operating income +6% (cc,+10% USD)— Sandoz sales declined -5% (cc, 0% USD) and core operating income declined -19% (cc, -16% USD)UNQUOTEThe last part, Sandoz, is a close comp to VTRS, so it seems off brand/generics are not doing great currently. Sandoz also benefits from a stronger emphasis on bio similars and complex genericsExpectations for VTRS are low so hope they can buck the trend"
The most interesting part: we will be open to updating (increasing?) financial guidance at the end of Q3Apparently they are having to be dragged up by their own numbers!
Tomorrow is the settlement date for a number of options. I've been hearing that a lot of the downward pressure the S&P has seen over the last 10 days is due to an unwinding of trading strategies associated with these options.Don't know much about trading strategies. Is this plausible?
"6 year slide paying for hype is not going to change it. Even hedge funds have figured out the plan. Changing the name not that either. This is about GREED HEATHER AND COUREY GREED. Paying $153,000,000 in parachutes for bad performance. These people should be in prison. 6 years failure"
Coury sold the company out right from under the shareholder's noses!!! LOL!!!
"@Clyde It's Your money to do with what you want. but The only real question you need to ask is Are they making change to make VTRS a much better company in the future then it was ? The answer is yes and the charts and the trading action is now telling you to load up. Why because the charts not only tell the past , but most of all they tell the future . FACT 2 major things happened last week in the charts for VTRS, one was the pull back and test of the up trend line and the bounce higher on Friday which also made the reverse head and shoulders bottom , Which should make it a screaming buy. I my opinion. so you now load up on any dips Wall street wants to give you if you are not in yet."
"Healthcare largely seems to be stuck in the mud; the only exceptions seems to be those that are involved in COVID diagnostics, therapies and vaccinesNot a constructive backdrop for VTRS"
"UP we go, told you the future in the charts was telling you to load up , Why because stock price is all about the future and NEVER EVER about the past."

Dating is up - match group- viagra is therefore up so is Viatris.
"How much will VGER be down today??? Picking at least another 25 cents as it marches toward 8.00 ps!!! Where is that Pittsburgh Man of the Year, Robert Coury??? LOL!!!"
Historic Approval and VGER goes up .39% or 6 cents!!! LOL!!!
"Finally started nibbling this morning, initiative a relatively small position, at least initially. Bought OGN near recent lows and feel that both a severely mispriced."
"$18 6 months ago they say it’s cheap but reality not cheap on falling revenue. It really does seem every article is bought and paid for. Does anyone see rising revenue? No. This is a joke when you consider $154,000,000 in parachutes on very poor performance lasting 6 years. I bought on a Zacks strong buy 5 years ago."
Don't worry folks!!! Next year at this time VGER will be trading above $30.00!!! LOL!!!
VTRS goes ex dividend on Aug 23 so you need to own your shares before the Aug 23 2021 to get paid the dividend on Sept 16 2021
This stock was almost at $15 a few days ago.Wha has changed?

"Manchin must feel guilty after Heather justified Coureys $100,000,000 parachute promising the stocks dramatic recovery. Unfortunately for investors that was a lie the 6 year slide has continued to this day. My question how much was the Senates cut? As the stock slide continued Heather got her $54,000,000 parachute. This is corruption at the very top. Merged resounding it under a new name. Hype continues as the stock sputters."
VGER down under 14.50 ps!!! The game is fixed and the insiders are right with the big 3!!! LOL!!! Hey Bob where are all the ANDA's you were touting years ago!!! Pretty sure the shareholders class action lawsuit has merit or it would have been dismissed by now!!! Heather sure knew when to jump ship!!!
VGER up .98% to 14.43 ps!!! Nice trading programs used by the big three!!! Have you guys talked to Coury lately!!! LOL!!!
"A tax on exuberant CEO pay. Would that include the $154,000,000 in parachutes to Courey and Heather. Clawback"
Can you say parachutes 10 times in a row as quickly as you can? No one dirty mgmt. bonuses for very poor performance along with Heathers lies to the Senate at $34 then falling to $12. Just might go back to $12 or lower. This mgmt is worthless.
"Everyone is myopic these days, but if you would hold onto this stock, you will see a sizeable and lasting upside explosion in stock price: 2023 stock repurchase, increased divi, and end to ongoing litigation. Also, expect to see pipeline growth as more drugs come off patents."
Who owns all the debt of this company???
"They're not going to do it, but management needs to do a $1 billion buyback. They should be on track for $3+ billion in free cash flow by the end of 2022. $1 billion is nothing for them."
"Motley says this stock is undervalued. I added some and will hold. Motley claims itself to be the best, so let’s see how good they are with this one."
Looking for a close < 14.50 ps or maybe a penny above!!! LOL!!!
Greg and Jack have been manipulating VTRS for the last 6 years as their firms have worked together in the movement of VTRS . What the SEC should do is find out what firms they work for and investigate the trades the 2 firms have made over the last 6 years
"Market should be heading much lower soon!!! VGER is down .80% to 13.62 ps!!! Less than $1.00 from a new 52 week low. Market is going to create a lot of pain under 30,000!!! Where is that foul mouthed Robert Coury???"
Colleagues: How much debt does vtrs have? Is the debt a worry?
"I bet you did not know that VTRS is now trading under 1 times sales , WOW that makes it about the cheapest stock in the whole market I would bet. Oh and I have buy buying shares"
get ready for VTRS by pass 14.73 in next few days and could 16s after earning next week Monday
"VTRS equity is currently yielding 25-30% per annum; and this is not a one time return available only during a brief window of time; it is a perpetual return available to shareholders for the full duration of the company’s business setup/lifeSo common sense dictates that any discretionary cash outlays have to overcome that 25-30% return thresholdDebt is costing the company ~2% (after tax) so I am really baffled at the company’s stubborn insistence on repaying debt instead of buying back stock, which is a slam dunk in the current situationYes, rating agencies prefer deleveraging, but one can always strike a reasonable balance, ie, repay enough debt to maintain the proportion of debt and equity in the capital structure and use the remaining cash flow to buyback stock"

The story that Teva snd others will be prosecuted in NY state court for its involvement in Opioid tragedy might explain today's early SP weakness. Viatris (Mylan) has virtually no involvement with this as the company only supplied opioids to hospitals and other medical centers. It was their responsibility to dispense and monitor these drugs and needed.
VGER up 2.98% to 14.32 ps!!! LOL!!!
VGER is up .77% to 14.40 ps!!! Premarket of course!!! LOL!!!
The real and only question is are they working hard to make VTRS a better business in the future ? Yes then the price of the stock will go higher FACT. It's always about what the future holds and NEVER EVER about the past. With numbers like that I would not be selling any shares the dividend alone will be going higher in the future.
I am sensing this is gathering to rise.
They are Forecasting revenue to jump from 2.7 billion to over 4.3 billion . WOW and look at the cost cutting they have been doing . They are working hard to make VTRS a better company
Seems to be nothing but good news (with words like 'Historic' used to describe the insulin approval) and yet the stock just keeps falling. What gives?
VGER down 2.25% to 14.57 ps!!! LOL!!! Well there goes another year of dividends!!! LOL!!!
"After 6 years of declining you would think a trend change is developing I got 1% + for a 5 days up trend but the month 6 month YTD Year and 5 year all big red. Might be gaining steam or getting ready for another Parachute. Amazing though paying out $153,000,000 in parachutes for very poor performance"
"Better learn about investing Jack , Greg , Investing is NEVER EVER about the past and always about the future , Stocks trading at less than 1 times Revenue are buys when they have made changes to make the company better in the future in a bull market or bear market is does not matter VTRS will be going higher"
The only thing that might explain today’s nosedive is that they may have underwhelmed at the City’s investor’s conference.
"Malik and Naurla approaching retirement, investors now know this mgmt corporate greed exceeds no other. Company performance has 0 to do with parachutes or bonuses given to mgmt. Six years of failure. $154,000,000 of parachutes."
How long before we see analyst upgrades?
Never seen a stock react so poorly in a Bull Market -That seem to a have lot going for It
Had a limit order in at $13.95.......Went for a bowl of cereal and came back with 170 VTRS shares.
"Shoving all my dividends into this stock. I'm pretty dam bullish on it, it has huge upside potential, and ""will increase dividends in the future on an annual basis once we paydown our debt from the merger"".I'm excited to see where we go hell even $14 or $15 won't stop me. This stock is going to the moon in 4 years"
anyone get their dividend today?
Make sure you buy the dips before the shorts can cover
"We, VTRS holders, are geniuses. And like geniuses, we will be appreciated when we are dead."
"Just remember that there are 2 million more shares short today than there were a month ago. That is what brought this down. First of month new money comes into the market next week and most will go into value and dividend stocks now, plus some end of month window dressing. We should see a substantial rise in share price as shorts cover."

"I think the EpiPin gouge was all about paying for Courey and Breasch parachutes $154,000,000 for now going on 6 year slide into oblivion. It continues this last month hit by another 10% slide. Latest articles Hedge Funds are running. In my thinking all the hyped up articles are bought. Zacks has been hyping this stock for years."
"Instead of wasting time posting to this site, write to VTRS urging management to buy stock individually. I did just that."
"Sell if you want it will be your loss, because VTRS will be trading a lot higher in the future"
What is the future of Viatris? Would like to know.
Viatris is going to bump up to $20 one day and everyone who didn't buy at current prices will be sorry. Look what happened with Pfizer in the last month.
"@Prem ... Can't provide a link because of Yahoo Finance rules, but Google this 'PharmaViatris, or just Mylan with a new name? Analysts cast doubt on newco's growth path.'This is a March 12, 2031 FiercePharma article. In it, you'll see what 'professionals' think about Viatris (Mylan) management."
"With all the angst around Mr Coury, I wonder how he has managed to remain the executive chairman; does he own a lot of stock? or he is backed by a big owner?How is he able to garner the support of the institutional owners?There seem to be a lot of posters that really dislike him; rather than just berating him gratuitously, it would be informative if you all share the reasons why (other than issues around the stock price performance of Mylan or executive Comp)"
Voting against the company will cost it an $81 million dollars termination fee. In other words the small investors have no choice but to vote Yes!
I had to get 550 shares at this price.
You for sure don't get very many chances to buy a company trading under book value that is paying you around 3% to wait as they work hard to make the business even better in the future . This will be one of the great investment you can make and it all about taking advantage of some think Wall Street does not want today and in a short time after Wall Street is in they will be pounding the table what a great deal it is FACT.
good time for add some more at low price next week x dividend day 9/23/2021
"Every way I twist this thing: price/sales, free cash yield, div., etc., the valuation is stupidly compelling. Not sure who the sellers are I’ve been buying from…? Even if I’m wrong about the thing I just don’t see much downside from here. I’ll collect my div., give it a few years and see what happens."
buy...buy...buy
"ANALysts are predicting VTRS will slow down on revenue/profit projections, largely a result of governments working to reduce drug costs by implementing buying groups and maybe even starting up their own generic drug MFG. I know Canada wants to go this way. High debt load, increasing interest rates to control inflation, possible reduction in sales/profits, and potential for legal payouts. The plus is a company dramatically increasing Asian sales and launching block buster drugs for Diabetes as an example. If life were only easier."
"From a Yahoo posted article:A fundamentally healthy businessDividend investors should always look to own businesses for the long term that are steady and capable of delivering growth in the future, and pharmaceutical stock Viatris appears to be just that.Although Viatris was only recently formed last November as a result of Pfizer's spinoff of its Upjohn business to combine with Mylan, its first two quarters of operating results demonstrate a business that is holding up.For the six months ended June 30, Viatris' year-over-year combined adjusted operational revenue declined 3% to $8.96 billion. This calculation uses the combined revenue of Upjohn and Mylan from last year, before the two combined to form Viatris, as the company's starting revenue base.While the revenue decline may not sound great, it's important to note that adjusted operational revenue in the company's brands product category, which contributed 60.5% of first-half sales, was down 6% year-over-year in the first half of 2021. This decline was partially offset by 7% higher adjusted operational revenue in the complex generics/biosimilars segment (7.4% of first-half sales) and flat revenue in the generics segment (the remaining 32.1% of first-half sales). That was driven by continued revenue declines in a number of off-patent products, including Lyrica (which saw a 46% year-over-year decline in the first half, from $706 million in 2020 to $380 million in 2021) and Celebrex (down 42% year over year, from $295 million in 2020 to $171 million in 2021).Looking ahead, Viatris is in a position to stabilize its revenue as it brings new products to the market to offset sales declines in off-patent brands. The company and its partner, Indian biopharma Biocon, received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval last month to market their biosimilar insulin drug, Semglee, as an ""interchangeable biosimilar"" -- essentially an alternative to Sanofi's blockbuster insulin drug, Lantus.Viatris has 10 other biosimilar candidates in its partnership with Biocon that are in various phases of clinical trials (such as a biosimilar for Sanofi's Toujeo insulin drug), which should help the company stabilize its revenue in the near future.While Viatris does carry a significant amount of debt on its balance sheet, the company has made strong progress in deleveraging through the first half of this year. With the $1.27 billion in free cash flow (FCF) that Viatris generated in the first half of this year, it repaid $1.15 billion in long-term debt. This brought its total long-term debt down to $23.1 billion (more than the company's $18 billion market capitalization), which works out to a debt-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) ratio of 3.7 (based on its $6.3 billion in midpoint EBITDA for this year).Viatris is taking deleveraging efforts seriously. The company is currently on track to meet its goal of reducing its long-term debt by $6.5 billion by 2023, which would bring the company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio to less than 3 (assuming no growth in EBITDA in the next couple of years)."

"Sell side analysts are not particularly original or accurate but they do serve an important purpose; they act as a filter and help synthesize the investment thesis, provide a narrative, and create buzz and draw attention to the stock to active market participantsSo when the VTRS management came out with their inaugural earnings guidance in Feb that was (intentionally sandbagged, in my view) disappointing, the analyst community was surprised and felt betrayed, and promptly withdrew their support for the stockIt will take time (and a string of positive earnings surprises) for the true earnings ‘baseline’ to be reestablished, and to recover that lost sponsorship from the analysts; in the meantime, we have to endure this drama"

"Their updated revenue guidance doesn’t make any sense:They are increasing the FY2021 revenue mid point by $200 million, but the first half ‘beat’ in revenue is already a bit more than thatA more realistic interpretation is that investors should look to the top end of their revenue guidance as the likely scenario (implying a $400 million increase from the original guidance issued in Feb)And adjusted EBITDA is on track top $6.5 billion notwithstanding their protestationsI wonder how all those investors who lost money in the sharp slide in share price on the back of a sandbagged FY2021 guidance issued in Feb feel about all this"

"from CNBC today ...The land mines for the market are growing. Seasonal weakness is combining with uncertainty over the Covid-19 delta variant’s impact on consumer behavior, rising labor and material costs pushing prices higher as well as poor economic data out of China.While the S&P 500 is still about 1% from its record high, those land mines are taking their toll on large sectors of the market.“For the last several months, most stocks have declined more frequently than they have advanced--evidence of a weakening market condition,” CFRA chief investment strategist Sam Stovall said in a recent note to clients.Other strategists have noticed this divergence as well.“As the equity market reaches new highs, the divergence in the advance-decline line suggests we may be approaching a top,” Guggenheim global chief investment officer Scott Minerd said in a recent tweet. “In the past, such divergence has indicated the market is vulnerable to a sell-off.”The 20% decline club is getting largerAbout 15% of S&P 500 stocks are more than 20% below 52-week highs, but much larger swaths of the midcap and small-cap universe are down 20% or more.

However, even Lakos-Bujas admits that it is very difficult to read the economic tea leaves.“Given the unique nature and impact of the pandemic, the current cycle is more difficult to analyze compared to historical cycles,” he said in a recent note to clients. “This cycle is essentially an overlay of two intertwined cycles — a Covid cycle and a regular business cycle (incl. labor, capex, inventory).”Why do so many analysts and strategists remain bullish? It’s all based on the theory that the delta variant will prove to be a diminishing force and that earnings will not materially decline.“As the delta variant eases, we expect these concerns to fade, leading to a much stronger 4Q21 holiday season (unlike last year’s holiday season disappointment) and a pick-up in cross-border activity from still depressed levels,” Lakos-Bujas said"
"Lately, I have had to tell myself on multiple occasions that ‘at some point, the share price has to catch up to the company’s fundamentals and performance’But alas, that logic gets more tenuous by the day; my best hope now seems to be that I am right like a dead clock is right, twice a day"
"The action of Viatris in the last month reminds me of Bausch Health (it was Valeant back then but later changed it's name) in spring of 2017. I started buying it after it fell under $10 bucks a share and kept buying as it went down to $8.50 a share. Everyone on their message board was crying and I was the only one posting any positive news. Cramer came out and bashed it on his show, just like he did to the S&P last night. Guess what happened? Within a month Valeant (now BHC) was up 50% and within 3 months it doubled! It is always painful (and lonesome) when shortsellers are piling on a stock, but just hold on, and buy more if you can, because better days lie ahead. Some people think there is no catalyst here but an announcement of a lawsuit resolution sent ENDP up 35% the other day. (it was only with New York!) I expect an announcement of a major settlement here any day, which will rip the faces off shortsellers."
"So is Viatris' stock price rise today due to (in sympathy with) Teva's earnings report. Teva stock is up 13%, Viatris stock price is up 3%.Though Viatris has an insignificant connection with the opioid tragedy, Teva's statement regarding a settlement may have triggered both companies' stock price to rise. Basically, Teva's CEO stated that though his company hasn't much money, it would be willing to pay penalties by providing medications to help those poor addicted folks overcome their addictions."
Heavily Manipulated!! Look at the Huge Buys!! Held by Institutions has almost Doubled!! Upto 77% S.E.C is WORTHLESS!! S.E.C. Looks the other way.

"From a August 24, 2021 Barron's article on the 10 cheapest (by PE) S&P company shares:Viatris, a generic drugmaker spun off from Pfizer (PFE), has the lowest P/E in the S&P 500 at 3.9. Its shares recently traded below $15.J.P. Morgan analyst Chris Schott was encouraged by the company’s second-quarter earnings report, but maintained a Neutral rating as he awaits more evidence of improving financial performance after a tough 2020. The stock has a 3% yield."

"About lawsuits: The company believes they have no merit. That said, they could easily settle all of these for $200 million which is $100 million after taxes and insurance coverage. This could be spread out over 5 years or $20 million per year which is a penny and a half in earnings per year. That's why I say the lawsuits are meaningless. Plus they have done well in court lately. Here is part of article from July 27, 2021 Mylan and Pfizer have spent years defending their marketing of the popular epinephrine injector EpiPen. After a busy couple of months in court, the partners have now wiped their hands of another lawsuit.U.S. District Judge Daniel Crabtree granted Mylan's motion to dismiss an antitrust lawsuit against itself and Pfizer. Specifically, the Kansas District Court tossed out a second amended class-action complaint from KPH Healthcare Services alleging Mylan and Pfizer used anticompetitive tactics to maintain their epinephrine ""monopoly,"" forged exclusive prescribing deals and maligned the merits of an EpiPen competitor. Viatris, which was born through the combination of Mylan and Pfizer's Upjohn unit, said in a statement it's ""pleased"" with the court's decision. The company maintains that its actions were ""completely lawful and pro-competitive."" RELATED: Mylan forks over $30M to settle SEC's EpiPen accounting probe"
Im new to the board bought a few shares today on the cheap.
Didn’t we get this same bs last qtr?
Let these phones conferences pass us by before anyone gets hopeful. I thinks it’s a con. The hedge funds wouldn’t have run if it that easy
"Since the merger, does anyone know the ratio of Mylan vs. Upjohn Board (BOD) members? Curious as to the control Coury still holds (?)."
I can’t believe it went straight down like that ?!!
"VTRS can triple over time and still be under priced, Tells you the down side is very little and the upside is very big and it pays over 3% just to wait for the share price to get back to where it should be . I would not be selling any shares of VTRS so cheap."
"From Barrons:""The cheapest stocks in the S&P 500—across sectors—are a pair of recent pharma-company spinoffs: Viatris (VTRS), jettisoned from Pfizer (PFE) last year and merged with Mylan, and Organon (OGN), excised from Merck (MRK) last month. They’re both brand-new stocks with generic-sounding names that have likely kept them relatively under the radar among non-healthcare focused investors. But while analysts have been skeptical about Viatris’ long-term growth prospects, there is more to like about Organon—a recent Barron’s stock pick. The two trade for just 3.9 times and 5.3 times next year’s earnings, respectively, versus the healthcare sector’s 26.3 times.""I cannot but not note the language: 'jettisoned', 'excised'"
"Revenue up over 49% Now trading at less than 1 times sale , Management working hard at paying off debt and cutting cost . Management is sticking to the plan of making VTRS a much better business in the future"
"PFE (Pfizer) seems like way better bet given their low PE….4% yield and huge potential upside as analysts betting that Covid revenue (33B and counting) won’t continue. Sadly, think boosters are with us for years and PFE brand strength provides differentiation…..expect news on a flu vaccine soon (which they were working on with BioNTech before Covid) as well as full FDA approval. I hold VTRS but now think PFE offers far better upside with limited risk. For what it is worth -"
Whatever their plan is it’s not working this 6 year slide proves that. I feel the corruption huge parachutes for bad performance is killing any upside. Then the fear of another parachute for horrendous performance is a concern. Mgmt killed it for investors
Poor Growth and too much debt!
"A 3% yield is significant as part of my portfolio diversification and that is partly the reason I own VTRS. The merger brought together a host of brand name medications that supposedly has seen its best day! The debt load is also significant but the cash flow from operations can handle the servicing of the debt in this low interest environment. VTRS is still investing in drug development and approval so additional announcements of drug approvals will be a major plus. I got some shares from the merger and spin off from PFE and added at higher prices but have averaged down so I expect to be back in the green with a couple of good ER in 2021 and 2022. Meantime, I get paid for waiting. Thoughts. God Bless and stay well."
Has anyone gone to a dr to get these brands prescribed. Seems lock downs prevent simple interactions even if it can be done by video. Still not As much volume.
GOOD NEWS: This closed the 13.98 - 14.98 gap today from May 7 - May 10 that was created on earnings and we went slightly below at low of $13.92 and then closed almost 1% higher which is a very good sign.
A 6 year failure means whatever plans they have is not working but what is working for the mgmt nothing can stop the parachutes not even the US SENATE. Investors have had enough of the Greed
All good news here. Will beat on earnings. Let's rally!
"How's this fixed game going today??? Oh, I see VGER is down again!!! Management is right, This is quite a different health care company, isn't it??? LOL!!!"
"Agree with the poster that said the share price reaction to the insulin glargine biosimilar approval is somewhat underwhelmingThe company press release has no information on the size of the opportunity, but from a quick search, the global market for insulin glargine is around $7.5 billion (growing at 4-4.5% per annum), and even if VTRS picks up only a 5% global market share, it represents $380 million of revenue; asset values in this market are north of 3x revenues, so around $1 billion of EV; assuming VTRS is entitled to 50% of that (with the rest going to Biocon), we should have seen a $500 million pop in market cap (or a $0.4 per share increase)Perhaps management intends to quantify the size of this opportunity in the upcoming earnings call, but going by their propensity to sandbag, I am skeptical"
"I have been induced to take a small position. So watching with the rest of you, at least for awhile. Not quite sure yet whether this is a screaming bargain or a value trap."
"Could it be another $100,000,000000 parachute? The other managers want their MAYPO"
When does the 6 year failure stop?
None of the shorts will go into the weekend holding; so don't sell on Friday.
"Don’t really care short term what this stock is doing. I will just buy more if it continues down below 14. We will see. A lot of potential for earnings surprises, with lots of business optimizations being implemented. Not to mention that as they reduce their debt their dividend should rise nicely"
"Sell a 14/13 November short put spread. you make 42-44% if the stock is above 14 at expiration. I sure hope so, sold a whole lot this morning and will continue to do that for each additional penny. So far, fills as 40,41,42 and 43 cents."
"This price action is very similar to last earnings (which came out before the bell on morning of May 10) Note that numbers represent Open, High, Low, Close, and Adjusted Close (for 11 cent quarterly dividend). I expect same price action after this earnings (to be announced before bell this Monday, Aug 9). BTW - the reason VTRS dropped so much yesterday was because many people in VTRS were also in LUMN, which dropped over 9% yesterday and they were forced to sell to raise cash to protect against margin calls.

"I have studied what is left of this lawsuit and I really strongly believe Mylan did nothing wrong. That said, I am sure they are in settlement talks and will settle for $100 billion or less and it will be announced in the next few days. This stock is loaded with shorts (about 35 million by my estimates based on last couple weeks trading/price action and over 30 million as of June 30 per Nasdaq.). I expect a big pop next week when short sellers realize that settlement will not be material at around 9 cents per share. I've been a trader since 1987 and have followed many, many lawsuits over the past years. What's left of this one is very weak. Hold your shares and you will be rewarded."
"Takeaway from presentation: They are extremely focused on expanding cash flow and increasing dividend. They spoke to FDA on Botox and feel very good they will be possible #1 but certainly in top 4 ($3.7 billion drug now $5 billion by 2024). They expect to pay debt down by $6 billion over next 2 years with expanding cash flow. Cash flow currently over $2 billion annually. They will expand dividend at same time. Payout ratio is only 25%. so very comfortable. They believe they have no liability with lawsuits. (they already won many cases on price fixing). The woman from Citibank asked about possible $400 million price fixing plus $200 million additional worst case which is probably what caused sell-off, but I can tell you from my 34 years' experience that these lawsuits are meaningless. Anyways, they said they have no merit. They also talked about their many new drugs and expanding biosimilars."
"Every time I have a couple of hundred dollars, I’m putting it into Viatris. Wall Street thinks it’s just too boring, and there’s a lot of debt. They’re also waiting to see if the merger works out. But the bar is set so low that Viatris only has to do “ok”, or so-so, for this to be a winner. I’m also in this for Growing Dividend, so if the price goes down I’m thrilled."

"The touts on this message board, either for long or short positions, rarely provide any information about the actual operations of the company itself. The stock price is substantially lower than the spin-off price and almost no one provides a cogent reason why. VV posted that he/she thinks that the stock price will be 50% higher after an earnings announcement without any provenance or data. What, exactly, will cause other investors to bid up the price by such a percentage in a short period of time? What, exactly, is this company doing to merit your confidence in such a way? There's a big difference between evidence and beliefs. Once you have the former, the latter becomes moot."
"I see that no one has one stock that is better than VTRS that is trading under book value and pays you around 3% that has the upside VTRS has as they pay off debt and cut cost to make VTRS a much better company in the future , Told you all the haters are flat out liars , Tells me VTRS is going a lot higher in the future FACT."
Curious if they will raise the dividend next year... and if so by how much?
Nice way to manipulate and make money on options next week.

"Vanguard has $1.8B in VTRS, excluding the investments from their mutual funds. Balckrock has $1.3B. These firms do their homework before investing. People should smell something good here."
It is the creditability of management that is holding back the stock price.2Q results delivered as promised. Looks like PFE side of management is helping.
"Earnings are on 8/9/ 2021 before the market opens , Only gives you 4 trading days now to get your shares before earnings , Any dips they want to give you load up shares before the shorts can cover"
"I would be surprised if management didn’t take the opportunity of the upcoming conferences to increase FY2021 guidanceThey said they will consider it when announcing Q3 results but given how late after the quarter close they report, that might be too late with only about 50 days remaining in the year"
Reading the earnings report then began thinking this turd has been sliding 6 years now. I see no change but hype. Then I wonder who’s going to get the next Parachute? Then I thought not one more $1.

"Cigna (CI) announced a $2 billion ‘accelerated share repurchase’ this morning; CI has a $71 billion market cap, and upon the announcement, CI’s share price basically went up enough to keep the market cap the same as beforeASR transactions are a tool that are often used to quickly reduce the number of shares outstanding and thereby meet/exceed EPS performance, so reading between the lines, I am hypothesizing that CI (which owns express-scripts) is likely facing higher benefit expense, which I regard as good news at the margin for VTRS because CI’s costs are revenues for drug companies, to some degreeNot conclusive, but this may mean additional tailwinds for VTRS for the rest of FY2021"
Revenue up 50% and they locked in wonderful Tax write offs that VTRS will need with the DEM wits in charge . Going to be a Cash Flow machine

Nice result. Buying more.
"I have been adding to my VTRS holdings since I got some from its spinoff from PFE and merger with Mylan. It has steadily moved lower but did move up after its last ER which was quite positive and since then has slide lower. Is it the trial with the epi-pen that is holding it back currently? Possible but PFE has already settled its portion of it and the impact for VTRS hopefully is minimal with the result of the upcoming trial. Medical approvals are hard to come by and tried and true medications may be past its growth days but with the aging population in developed countries, VRTS will continue to do well. Thoughts. God Bless and stay well."
bought calls for Aug and Dec.I think this is a super deal in the market.The earning will change the course.
"I thought these dudes made generic Viagra? This should be going through the roof. They sell the stuff in Pez dispensers now. Give epi pens to kids for Halloween, this should be a winner. Dividend looks good. This is a buying opportunity! Bio simulars of everything bio. Things get better every year for this company. Hopefully they get rid of coury. He is a shareholder, stockholders worst enemy."
Now it’s more hype with HEALTHCARE CONFERENCE S. Give me a break. 6 years of failure
liability issues- status?
"Management says it is paying off debt with the free cash flow; how has that worked out so far?They must have paid off $1.5-2 billion of debt so far with free cash flow, and that should mean that equity holders have a $1.5-2 billion larger share of the enterprise, but instead the equity value of VTRS dropped by $4.1 billion (20%) since the Upjohn merger closed in NovNice job; bravo!"
Just tells you how much they are now over paying for SOFI
A few more cycles I am afraid then up in smoke
"Say OH NO that guy knows how to play and buying up all the shares LOL,LOL,LOL"
I did my dividend reinvestment today because when you get paid on 9/16 2021 the stock price will be higher
Great news tomorrow up a penny after hour market.
"From Morley Fool article (9/4/21):Another market-topping dividend stock with all the tools necessary to double investors' money by 2026 is drug company Viatris (NASDAQ:VTRS). If the name doesn't ring a bell, it's because it was formed less than a year ago from the combination of Pfizer's established medicines unit Upjohn and generic drugmaker Mylan.As a combined company, Viatris is expected to perform better and be able to do more from a growth perspective than Upjohn and Mylan would have ever been able to do as stand-alone companies. While combining forces did leave the company with about $26 billion in debt, the expectation is that a quarter of this debt ($6.5 billion) will be paid off by the end of 2023. Once debt levels dip below $20 billion, the company can consider share repurchases, and will almost certainly invest in new drug development. Something else that gets overlooked about Viatris is the key role it'll play in the generics space. Since generic medicines have considerably lower margins than brand-name drugs, volume is important. With the list prices of brand-name drugs moving higher at a precipitous pace, it seems only logical to expect the use of generics to rise over time. Patients and insurers will both be looking to cut costs, and generic-drug developers are the obvious beneficiary.Viatris is also dirt cheap, which could be a selling point for value investors. It's generated $2 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing 12 months, and it can be bought for less than four times forecasted earnings per share in 2021. Tack on a 3% yield, and you have a recipe for success."
"To those advocating for this stock simply based on its low P/E:Low P/E ratios could be an initial filter to spot value but they are not in themselves an investment thesis. Low P/Es are sometimes justified by the underlying trends such as demand stagnation, eroding margins, etc (and VTRS is not an exception in the generic pharma space; look at OGN and TEVA).The energy space is now littered with low P/E names as well (BP, Shell, Lyondell Basell, to name a few)Sometimes (but markets are generally efficient and this is relatively rare) it is possible that the P/E may be too low in relation to a company’s underlying cash flow generation; in these instances, the only way to force convergence to a stock’s true value is through enhanced shareholders distributions of such cash generation (and this is the strategy most often relied upon by activist investors); but if the board of the company does not recognize this dynamic, it is going to be an uphill battle!"
I would have anticipated a much bigger bump than 1% with the good news we just had.
"LOL,LOL Jack , you already know they are going to blow out revenue Last year 2.7 billion and this year will be over 4 billion massive up side For VTRS and the charts are yelling at you to get in LOL,LOL You want to put it on sale all the better LOL,LOL,LOL"
Why is it going down after good earnings?
"I would not sell any shares of VTRS , The Dividend by itself is more than a reason not to sell any shares this cheap . Trading so cheap that not selling and just collect the dividend is in your own best interest. VTRS can triple over time and the dividend pay out will be going higher as they work at making the company better for the future ."
Don't forget that just a month ago on August 5 this closed at 13.83 and 2 trading days later closed at 15.10 - I just bought more. Thank You!
we will be $20 soon...
Revenue up almost 50% and VTRS trading at less than 1 times sales. Sell if you want . but as Management sticks to the plan of cutting cost and paying off debt VTRS will be a lot higher in the future

"I am long VTRS (and have been for a while)So do investors still feel that this is a 'low risk' investment? when it keeps tanking on no news? while the broad market is holding steady at all time highs?We have to acknowledge when our presumptions are proven wrong by observed evidence? the price action of this security is terrible, and the company's board does not seem to careIt could be true that this stock is cheap at $14; and if the market is ignoring that, there is a simple way for the Board/Management to force the market to recognize the discount, ie, announce a share repurchase program and start to buyback stock at a 'deep discount'The VTRS board can minimize/pause all other non-time critical uses of the cash and make repurchases of its own shares a priority use for the company's cash flow; for the moment, there is no better investment opportunity for the company's cash flow than its own deeply discounted shares"
This company could really use an activist.

"Prem, this is when you make your money. The market is providing an outstanding opportunity. Doesn’t happen often (especially in an already extended market- my opinion). We can debate the best use of cash flow over the next 12-36 months but whether we reduce debt or shares the company is becoming more valuable. I own more today than last month and at current prices will own still more next month. I just don’t believe this thing trades at these levels 5 years from now."

"There is a good chance that VTRS will come out with q2 adjusted earnings that are above the analyst estimates; that is the game every company management plays, and this one, being new to that game, wants to play even more earnestly VTRS management has been unduly conservative when they gave FY2021 guidance back in Feb (I have previously commented on this extensively), and that conservatism alone is enough to expect them to beat the analyst estimates, for what it is worthQ2 has not been kind to genetic drug companies as the normalization from COVID induced slowdown in healthcare delivery has not quite panned out as expected (Sandoz and TEVA are good precedents in this respect); but the conservatism embedded in the FY2021 guidance is probably enough to still beat the estimates by a modest (4-5 cent?) marginMore interesting for investors will be the progress on the new product pipeline (future revenue declines are a big risk), and implementation of their cost restructuring program"

"As a long time (since 1996) shareholder, I continue to lament the lost opportunity that the Teva buyout would have presented.When Teva gave up ever reasoning and negotiating with Coury, the CEO of Allergan, Brent Saunders was able take advantage of Teva management's frustration by selling to them Allergan's garbage. Just a year or so after closing the deal, Teva began to write off those assets. The debt borrowed to close the deal has been Teva's 'ball and chain' ever since.IMO, none of this eould have happened if Teva had managed to convince Emporer Coury to sell. Mylan's assets were superior to the stuff that Saunders unloaded on Teva CEO Vigodman."
"Here is an important article from last month: By Paul J. Gough – Reporter, Pittsburgh Business TimesJun 24, 2021, 4:39pm EDTCanonsburg pharmaceutical giant Viatris hailed a ruling in a Kansas federal court on a class action lawsuit over predecessor company Mylan NV regarding the pricing and marketing of EpiPen.The class action lawsuit had been filed in August 2017 in U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, alleging Mylan had engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair competition that violated state and federal antitrust laws. The lawsuit alleged EpiPen, an allergy medication then owned by Mylan and now by Viatris (Nasdaq: VTRS), was being sold at a discount to schools for not buying a competitor and providing what it called exclusive and excessive rebates to insurers, pharmacy benefits and others if they didn’t reimburse for competing products.This week, the court ruled in part in favor of Mylan and in part in favor of the class action plaintiffs in the summary judgment, including whether the company violated any RICO (anti-racketeering) laws. The court said that there wasn’t enough evidence presented for some of the plaintiff’s claims. The ruling said there’s no ability under the law to make a case in court whether the exclusive rebate contacts with pharmacy benefit managers from Mylan would violate antitrust laws.All RICO claims were dismissed, which Viatris noted included claims that had been lodged regarding former Mylan CEO Heather Bresch.Another class action claim was allowed to go to trial, which is set to begin Sept. 7. That involves a patent agreement over EpiPen. Viatris said it would defend itself vigorously as it has with other claims against EpiPen and Mylan.“The company firmly believes that Mylan’s conduct was lawful and procompetitive, and that plaintiffs will have great difficulty proving damages resulting from Mylan’s actions,” Viatris said in a statement.A lawyer for the class action didn't immediately respond to a request for comment."

"If you are short you are now being given the best gift you will get to cover ,because earnings are coming"
"Clyde is right about buying the dips when they give them to you , Before the next move higher"
Thank you to all who sold to me at this wonderful price. I'm having a wonderful day since I bought ENDP yesterday. I thought it had gotten way to cheap = look at what it is doing today!!! I sold all my shares in Ebdo on this 35% bounce. VTRS will get a nice bounce when people sober up. Thank you again from the bottom of my heart!
"@ROn share repurchases:The share repurchase idea you mentioned is very relevant in the current situation; I have been pushing it for a while (including an open post to management on this board a while ago)VTRS’ debt is significant on its face but is not a real problem; the company’s cash flow generation is ample and projected debt service coverage is very comfortable (and superior to many other investment grade companies); the only reason to prioritize debt repayments when the share price is so discounted is to secure what management calls ‘strategic flexibility’, a coded phrase that big pharma uses for new product acquisitions because their own R&D efforts are inadequate; but between allocating capital towards pricey acquisitions and supporting a distressed share price, the latter choice should easily win, in my opinionThere are some commenters on this board that seem to have an old fashioned moral aversion to debt; this is not grounded in reality. Debt provides tax efficiency and reduces cost of capital, instills a degree of additional discipline in managements, and when managed prudently, debt financing can be very advantageous from a shareholders point of viewBut I also doubt if VTRS management is looking at it that way"
"manipulation, drop it, buy it, sell it"
"I am posting this to see if Yahoo will now let me post a link: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792044/000179204421000023/exhibit991-2q21earningsrel.htm Look at bottom of page to see 2020 first 6 months Mylan numbers versus 2021 combined companies' numbers, and read footnotes."
"This is a time bomb ready to explode in our favor. When Pfizer spun off Zoetis it is now over $200., a share. Stick with this company and have patience. The senior population continues to grow and medication is their lifeline."
nice earnings
"Jack and Greg both wait to panic you into sell so the can cover their short position . They have been short for a very long time and still have shares they need to cover. So what you do is beat them to the shares they are trying to cover with , Just pick up your shares when they put VTRS on sale before Jack and Greg can cover ."
VGER down .31% to 14.58 ps!!! Has anybody heard from the former Pittsburgh Man of the Year - Robert Coury lately??? LOL!!!
"The EBITDA beat alone is worth about $1.5-2 in share price, conservatively speakingI doubt if today’s reaction will be that much but hopefully at least $1It seems that no one believes this company’s potential anymore even when it does cool things like the insulin glargine interchangeable biosimilar"
"Epipen cost Pfizer $345 million. How much will VTRS have to pay?? Since it was in charge of pricing, it will probably end up being multiple of that number."
What's wrong with this company? Too much debt?
going to 17 soon - this is cheap .11$ dividends GREAT September
"' ... Viatris, a generic drugmaker spun off from Pfizer (PFE), has the lowest P/E in the S&P 500 at 3.9 ...'More importantly than the P/E ratio is the fact that Viatris is included in the S&P index. Here's why this is important in understanding the dreadful price action. As of yesterday's close, according 'Market Wrap' on Bloomberg radio, more than half of S&P stocks are down more than 10%. That is, the market of mid to large capitalization companies has had (has been) in correction mode for the last month or so. Who knows where we go from here (IMO we're near the end of the corrective phase)? Just that Viatris is not behaving badly on its own merit, but us participating in the overall negative market sentiment.@Prem, I'm pleased that management did not restate future estimates yesterday. Having owned Mylan for many years, I'd rather have Viatris management (Mylan's Coury and his lapdog Bresch were famous for volunteering guesses (to mislead???) ...) under promise and overdeliver, but in due course."
"The VTRS insulin biosimilar can be interchangeably used as a substitute for insulin glargine as well as LantusThis is meaningful for VTRS; let’s see if they will put out a press release on the size of the addressable market and what they expect to get of itThis is also not a cut price generic; it will probably be priced like their Humira biosimilar, at about 30-40% of the original branded version"
Best of all you get paid over 3% just to hold VTRS as it goes higher
"Have to wonder what is making it drop this severely, after it stabilizing and climbing to 15.20 or so. That's a near 10% drop in 2 weeks with the market near all time highs. Going to stick with selling November 14/13 short put spreads, but nervously!"

"VTRS continues to confound the believers :-)This stock now has a $16 billion market cap; if you believe the management, that is just 4-5 years worth of free cash flow; this is the essence of its ‘undervaluation’ investment thesisBut for that thesis to actually work in the marketplace, that same cash flow has to be applied towards retiring equity; if this crucial link is broken, then the share price will remain disconnected from the free cash flow generationObviously this situation can also materialize because there are a lot of sceptics around the cash flow generation capacity of the enterprise, and there is only one way to prove them wrong: show them the money and use it to put a bid under the stock"
Today News proved VTRS is sticking to their plan to make VTRS a much better company in the future. Investing is always about the future and NEVER EVER about the past.
"VTRS Future is so bright you are going to need to ware shades . LOL,LOL,LOL VTRS stock will be going higher over time and paying a bigger and bigger dividend over time . Count on the stock more than doubling maybe even a triple."
"FiercePharma (August 11, 2021):The new company impressed analysts with its second-quarter showing. Bernstein credited part of the performance to better-than-expected sales for nerve and muscle pain medicine Lyrica and blood pressure drug Norvasc in Australia and New Zealand despite their loss of exclusivity.Viatris formed last November through the merger of Mylan with Pfizer’s generic business Upjohn. Monday’s earnings report is an indication that the company’s initial growing pains may not be as pronounced as expected.While Gal has long-term worries, his team ""would argue for continued near-term strength of the business,” Gal wrote.“Altogether we are seeing the business bounce off the bottom without too much pain,"" Gal added.One factor that portends well for the future of Viatris is the launch of new biosimilars, especially Semglee, approved less than two weeks ago as the first interchangeable biosimilar insulin. As an interchangeable biosimilar, Semglee can be substituted for Sanofi’s Lantus at pharmacies without a prescription. Lantus costs more than $300 for a 10-ml supply. Viatrus didn’t reveal what it would charge for its product on Monday.“You will see some uptick in the market share around quarter four but the actual impact of interchangeability to the market share perspective and access will be seen over the next year,” Viatris president Rajiv Malik said on the call."
"Did anyone notice that Berkshire Hathaway bought a stake in the specialty generic women's heath pharmaceutical company Organon?Prem, you mentioned that this Merck spinoff has the similar financial and business trajectory as Viatris. You did mention owning shares of OGN. Any comments on Buffet's rationale and would a company like VTRS also be a possible BRK investment choice. Thanks for your comments."
"Another comment by the CFO that is meaningful for the valuation of VTRS:‘seeing base business erosion of 3-4%’This was previously mentioned to be 4-5%, and the 1% decrease in the secular base business revenue erosion is very meaningful for the P/E valuation of the companyI previously estimated a share price of around $19 based on a valuation approach that replaces the 5% annual base business revenue loss with acquisitions (with a commensurate hit to free cash flow)A 1% improvement (smaller revenue erosion) in this trend would mean $180 million of annual revenue that is not lost (and hence does not have to be replaced); in my valuation methodology, this would reduce the annual free cash flow hit by $450 million, which adds around $6 billion to the EV, or around $5 to the share priceIn summary, annual base business erosion of only 3-4% (vs the 4-5% previously estimated by management) increases the VTRS share price valuation by around $5 to $24"
$1.11 to $00.98 still falling revenue. This is going to linger for 2 more qtrs. $20 target 6 months out a big maybe.
Remember to pick up the shares when they put them on sale before the shorts can cover
"Vanguard owns to many shares to not want to take it high soon , but the company had to make the changes to make VTRS a much better company in the future to support the increase in share price"
"Catalyst for today's 3.2% pop is like yesterday's article published by The Motley Fool recommending purchase of VTRS ""hand over fist"", highlighting $1 billion of synergies by 2023 that will help reduce debt and increase dividends."
Buy and hold here with 3.2 % dividend pe 4 .5 stock discount here
Bought this from a Zacks strong buy at $35. Later I read Zacks and Cramer have a 50% picker success rate
Hear anything on the next dividend?
"VTRS is being valued by the market as if there is a high likelihood of a 4-5% annual revenue attrition (or equivalent margin loss)This assumption may be overly pessimistic and could get less negative over time, so the VTRS investment thesis could work over the long term However, how well that thesis holds up if the broad market starts to rerate to a lower P/E (from the near 30x it is currently trading at) in the face of normalizing interest rates is another matterSo, yes; there is a path to value realization but it is contingent upon the broad market holding at these levels or continuing to rise, which is the bigger questionWill persistence be rewarded? Only time will tell"
Lots of big insider buying from multiple insiders last week in the low $14 range setting the bottom; very undervalued stock here
shorts will have to cover - :)
