Both GSK and Sanofi beat their Q3 estimates and concurrently raised FY2021 guidanceThe outperformance is largely based on proprietary medicines and vaccine salesLet’s hope the center of gravity of VTRS’ drug portfolio hews in the direction of complex and specialty medicines with some pricing power
"Make sure to buy the dips , because they push it down and then they are buying it back up you will only get so many times to buy the dip before the move higher"
I have 50000 and will wait for $18 ....and %3 Divi....
"I believe semglee was already approved as a biosimilar and has been producing a modest amount of revenue for VTRS/Biocon; the recent FDA approval is adding the ‘interchangeable’ designation to it which allows a pharmacist to automatically substitute the name brand with the interchangeable drug (like they do with generic drugs)Name brand drug makers have ‘kickback’ rebate programs with pharmacy benefit managers that are tied to off take volumes; as such, PBMs have been reluctant to embrace biosimilars in order to not lose out on such rebates from drug companies, but the idea is that with the interchangeable designation, payers can exercise greater control of the formulary choices; the strategy could work over time but in the specific case of semglee, the major name brand insulin manufacturers (Novo, Eli Lilly, Sanofi) are also introducing their own generic versions at a discounted price to compete better, so time will tell what the financial contribution from semglee to VTRS is likely to be"
The question is: will it go lower?
"From Novartis’ Q3 earnings press release:(Sandoz is a close comp for VTRS; cc is constant currency stripping out the effects of FX movements)QUOTEQ3 net sales grew +5% (cc, +6% USD) Innovative Medicines grew +7% (cc, +8% USD)Sandoz declined -2% (cc, -1% USD), affected by continued pricing pressures.

VTRs is $20 stock by 2022 buy much as you can at discount price.
"We bought VTRS on Friday, my advisor recommended it…Excellent PE. High debt being addressed. R&D spending is a positive sign."
"I feel your pain! however, I think if you can be patient, you will see a steady uptick in stock price and dividend. I don't think it is ever going to happen in leaps and bounds but it may be reliable."
"After ER, back to $18."
ANYONE WORRIED ABOUT THR 25 BILLION IN DEBT WITH ONLY 750 MILLION CASH ON HAND ??
"All the old Mylan investors that cry all the time and live in the past either sell , take your loss and move on or move to the light of a new day and a brighter future , because where you are at is not good for your health . The stock is not $50 anymore it's $13 and change , So buy more or move on because it's now a bond with upside . Can't wait to see how much better the business is getting after just 3 more months"
"Over a 3% bond with upside , Buy the dips why you can soon VTRS will be higher and you will have to pay more"
"New low today!!! LOL!!! Sorry VGER holders!!! It’s all in a days work, taking other people’s money!!! LOL!!!"
"Just looked at 2Q 10Q for insight on 3Q.Loss from operations: $47.8 million.Net loss: $279.2 millionLoss per share: 23 cents.I think we can easily show a small net income from operations. Just $47.8 million more.With a lower interest expense also, 3Q net loss shouId be about $220 million.Market should like this, but.........."
"34k shares for me, no brainer"
"we will be $20 soon.....Buy as much as you can , I added some to day...."
Buying
Another parachute anyone?
"Part of a Bank of America report found in a Yahoo article:“To identify [tax-loss candidates] – stocks that may be temporarily depressed by tax loss harvesting but could outperform in subsequent months on solid fundamentals – we screened the S&P 500 for stocks with YTD price declines greater than 10% as of Oct. 22 (30 stocks), and include those which are Buy-rated by BofA (13 stocks, below),” the analysts said.Here are the stocks they found that were both down 10% and had an in-house buy rating: Global Payments (GPN), Viatris (VTRS), Lamb Weston Holdings (LW), Incyte (INCY), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Qualcomm (QCOM), Penn National Gaming (PENN), T-Mobile US (TMUS), Fidelity National Information (FIS), AT&T (T), Western Union (WU), Fedex (FDX), and Ross Stores (ROST).History’s good fortune shown to stocks that people sold as losers for tax reasons, of course, is no guarantee that it’ll be the same this year. It hasn’t always been the case every year, even if in most years this strategy works. Other things could be in play, and the paucity of this year’s crop of 30 struggling stocks — vs. the average of 127 — might complicate things. If you’re already sitting on a -10% loser year-to-date, you know successful stock picking is tough to do.Still, the S&P 500 has historically performed well between November and January since 1936, the analysts point out. There’s definitely a case for simply buying and owning the market if you’ve had a tough year.-Ethan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Writer and Chief of Staff at Yahoo Finance."
Well this is nice Cigna's pharmacy unit will be replacing a Sanofi insulin drug with one from Viatris and Biocon. They expect a sizable savings. Maybe others will soon follow . Not allowed to link to the story but it just came online
"This is a dark horse in my portfolio.I believe in the current OPERATING management because they are from PFE.If they produce as promised, this will be a $25+ Stock in late 2022. Meanwhile, the dividend rate is decent.Hold, and add on dip. Under $13.50"
The revenues are higher than the market cap. Low single digit PE. >3% dividend. What else could scream 'buy?'
"2K shares in this...great play for next year, regardless of what the market ends up doing."
Looking forward to their ER next week... A great buy at these levels.
"I am buying the dips , because the business is way better than the stock price is at. VTRS has become a cash flow machine , So I will wait and collect the over 3% on my money until Wall Street wakes up to that fact, but for sure at some point that will happen. The price of the stock has nothing to do with the business and VTRS is proving that point. Less than 1 times sales now . Less than book value , , Less than 2 times cash flow . At some point VTRS will be over priced but for sure it's not now . Yes the have debt , but they have a plan and are sticking to that plan. I think earnings will surprise again with the cost cutting then have been doing . Yes Wall Street and really it's just Vanguard now that is really mad and making everyone fill the pain for longer than they should but that is nothing knew . You can do that when you are one of the powerful few that make up the Great Wall of Wall Street . I love this game and know how it's played , So you just collect the dividends and invest for the day Wall Street takes it out of the Penalty box, I needed something paying better than bonds with upside and you will lose money even in bonds now . Just my opinion"
we will be $18 meanwhile collecting %3 divi....
Everyone that has wanted to sell has sold and anyone buying now is looking to the future not the past.The stock is not $50 it's $13 and change and pays better than a bond with some upside as they work hard at making the business better and as long as they keep working hard at making the business better sooner or later the stock price will go higher . So you either believe in the plan or you don't and if you don't then move on this stock is not right for you
Viatris released a generic form of Lantus and Levemir. I use these drugs every day in general practice. Cigna and now Express Scripts are going to prefer the Viatris generic.
we will be $18 soon .... I own over 50000 . Collecting Divi as well.......
"The push lower and the charts are now distorting the down cycle , Why because Wall Street has the earnings and wants in before earnings and it's now showing up in the charts so you buy the dips before the next up cycle starts because the next up cycle will also trigger and new med upcycle and a new long up cycle . For a nice long ride higher make sure not to sell to soon ."
Viatris Insulin Biosimilar is the leading drug on the market. Should be up $3 not .40 cents. Long.
"A general observation in support of shorts:There are folks on this board who pronounce that if you don’t like the stock you should move on (and not choose to comment); I find that view is uninformed on multiple levelsI am a long VTRS investor (and have been for a while); that said, long investors are not different than short investors; everyone that takes a position in the stock, whether long or short, risks their capital in the hope of making a return; they have their respective investment theses and a short thesis is not automatically inferior to a long thesisFrom my observation, a short thesis is generally lonelier, riskier and requires more rigorous homework (and maybe a louder megaphone) in order to be successful, so if anything, shorts are more deserving of our respect, not lessI for one have benefited on many occasions from the shared inputs of shorts, and learnt many investing lessons from them over the years"
Zacks rates this a BUY!
"Bought 5000 shares at average price of 13.48. Stock is building a base for a move much higher. Huge amount of leveraged free cash flow that is increasing as company pays down its debt. Dividend increases should be forthcoming , and stock is selling well below book. Value investor's dream!"
$20 by Christmas IMHO. 
i'm buying
I keep buying at these levels....great long term gain going to be realized next year.
"Teva 3Q21 Report:Teva Pharmaceuticals Inc. swung to a profit in the third quarter, although profit and revenue fell below Wall Street estimates. The Israeli generics company posted net income of $292 million, or 26 cents a share, for the quarter, after a loss of $4.349 billion, or $3.97 a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to 59 cents, below the 64 cents FactSet consensus. Revenue fell 2% to $3.887 billion, also missing the FactSet consensus of $4.03 billion."
The more they want to give it away the better is is for you if you have the cash to take advantage of the gift. Paying over 3% plus is like buying a long term bond with major upside
