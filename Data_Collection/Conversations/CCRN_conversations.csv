"I bought some shares below $7.30 after the investor conference where the returning founder outlined his plans for the company. It is my view, he will do what it takes to dress CCRN up for sale, in the next 2 years, for somewhere in the mid teens.On a PSR basis is much less expensive than it biggest public rival AMN, however AMN has had much better operating results. However, given AMN's results, that gives the ""market"" and CCRN a target by which they need to get to. As the process evolves, CCRN's valuation will move higher as results improve.I've invested in the this industry for many years and one of the dynamics that was true in the past is the relationship between the slowdowns in manufacturing and stronger nurse staffing companies results. Commentary by managements in the past were along the lines of ""Blue collar husbands losing jobs or getting their hours cut, meant wife nurses picked up more hours to keep family income stable. The nurse staffing industry is constrained by the ""shortage"" of nurses. So loss of mfging jobs, means increase of supply of nurses, which is good for the staffing companies being able to fulfill demand.As CCRN progresses through 2019, EPSs may have some very big upside surprises as operational improvements get magnified by increased placement because of increased supply of nurses at the margin."
