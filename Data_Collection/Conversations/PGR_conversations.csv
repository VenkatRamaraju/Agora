is this a good buy for a long term value play ?
The company will return One Billion Dollars to policy holders due to fewer claims than expected. who are these stock traders who are driving the stock price down? Manipulaters? My logic only shouts bigger profits for PGR.
Can someone please explain how this special divy effects the stock price?All things being equal does the stock price fall $4.60 on the x-divy date?
why does yahoo show earnings 12/10 .. seems too early. is this a mistake
As soon as the rest of the market goes up Progressive goes down and vice versa. Acts more like the Vix!
"PGR beats (up 39% from last year) and goes down. RLI missis, and goes up. Why???"
This stock is finally starting to move in a way that agrees with its financial statements. Go Progressive!!
"I love GAAP accounting. Price for PGR drops, sell-side firms downgrade on GAAP margin compression, despite PGR having one of their best quarters ever in terms of free cash flow. Time to pick up more shares."
"This stock is cheap at this levels if you want to be long.It was in the 60s on January of 2016 while their revenue was half and their earnings per share were three times less what they are now. Great balance sheet. Increasing revenue, increasing profit margins. Markets are a bit beaten down due to the uncertainty of the election for for next year this will correct itself to above 110."
This company only cares about stealing your money. They change policies and have different agents telling g different stories to what is on the policies
Do you guys think the earnings report will be positive
Sell sell sell ! This company is understaffed and overrated. Customer service has suffered drastically. Pgr will lose tons of customers vv soon !
Somebody say something.
"Buy in the low 90s, sell at +100.Easy money."
"With America shutting down, there should be a lot less driving over the next several weeks. Would this not benefit auto insurance companies like Progressive? Less accidents will lower loss ratio."
see this nobody on the message boards here thats institutional ownership. i love stocks that go up a little everyday without any noise. slow and steady. love this stock.
"This analyst says get out while you still can:""In our view, Progressive Insurance (NYSE:PGR) appears to be fully valued based on its current stock multiple. Our analysis of this data indicates that loss cost trends are plateauing, pricing is flat to down and repair costs are going up — partially offset by declining bodily injury costs. We might be at the peak of this cycle and results might be flattish from here. Hence, we would consider lightening up on personal-auto-predominant stocks based on valuation.""https://www.twst.com/interview/commercial-lines-among-the-most-favorable-insurance-subsectors"
"Consistent money maker, increasing profits, increasing policies,.....when us this a takeover target?"
This is the best finTech insurance app in the market. Superb ease of doing business
"Combined ratio increased by 12.6% to 96......Combined ratio is single largest factor on earnings.This would partly be explained by return to normal miles driven.Regardless, I see the drop as an over-reaction, and have taken advantage of the sale price.PGR frequently does this after earnings. If it's like the typical overreaction we will just smile in a few days.If you don't understand what Combined ratio is you need to look it up...."
If it drops today after earnings...as always...buy and hold for 8 points in 2 weeks. as constant as sun rises.
I bought car insurance through a broker and Progressive was the least expensive insurance that I could find. Hard to believe!
Earnings beat estimates by 20+% and the stock price falls. Only in PGR World.
Almost all the real insurance companies have a criminally low P/E. Meanwhile LMND hemorrhages money and is going vertical from Motley Fool articles. PGR literally prints money.
"Bought a bunch under 86 Below 200 ma, rsi on the floor. Numbers are just fine, just a small miss in revenue a few weeks ago (still increasing).I'll sell at 92-93 in two weeks."
"Put 20k into this stock today. Best balance sheet/growth/cash flow/P/E ive seen.14%yoy growth yeilding 5%, at 11p/e? Load the boat."
What’s with the big down trend these past few weeks?
Arguably the most undervalued stock in the whole market. Under $10 P/E ratio?! Banana land  let’s go to the moon folks
pgr record earnings. buy and make a fortune by next summer.
"At first glance April results look grim with $316m in GAAP earnings, down 67% y/y. But PGR received $200m in cash premiums not reported on income statement and didn’t pay out $700m in losses reported, which means FCF was $900m higher than reported earnings. Not so grim? Also policies sold up double digits across the board— seems to me to have been a great month"
I’m hoping for the best. I knew we’d go back over 90 sooner or later.
"Liberty Mutual just canceled the Laura Ingram show, wonder who Michael will be able to line up to insure his double wide?"
"Morgan Stanley downgraded $RKT 10 days ago when it was $17....it is pushing towards $20 at the moment. F MS, just started my position!"
"what is really interesting , is how Progressive is under pricing Geicoalso, watch Geico for adding coverage you already have , such as roadside , all new cars come with that"
What happened to the PGR company? big oversold on RSI.
This stock has been dead in the water for the last year! May be time to move on?
nice
Booooo...!!
RELI just had another positive earnings quarter. Both RELI and PGR should start seeing some momentum with 5 minute insure going fully online this week
Most policies written for a year....nothing will cure the lower rates/higher claims/lower margin problem except time....til rate increases and (hopefully) new policy revenues kick in over the next year...
