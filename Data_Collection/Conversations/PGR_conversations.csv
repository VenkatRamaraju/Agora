Up $2. What does that say about earnings tommorrow? Give me another dollar and you can have my shares today.
Somebody say something.
This stock is finally starting to move in a way that agrees with its financial statements. Go Progressive!!
I thought rising interest rates are a positive for insurance companies.
Terrible report...CR over 96 for quarter;over 100 for June.The CR has not been over 96 for 20 years.
Now that’s a funny dividend
"This stock is cheap at this levels if you want to be long.It was in the 60s on January of 2016 while their revenue was half and their earnings per share were three times less what they are now. Great balance sheet. Increasing revenue, increasing profit margins. Markets are a bit beaten down due to the uncertainty of the election for for next year this will correct itself to above 110."
Here we go again!
Why is this stock so volatile?

"Any truth to this being an indirect, Soros backed company?"
Progressive is going to have a serious problem with all the people dumping it. Love it!
"These Insurance companies are loaded with cash. Homes, Cars and Businesses still need to be insured, not sure why all these companies are tanking. Gotta be manipulation by the big boys."
"Analyst's have it as undervalued, a buy and they had a pretty darned good quarter. Just bought another thousand shares at a bargain!"
PGR is up 5.48% to 77.00
The Progressive is down 7.64% to 90.00
I have been in PGR for 40+ years and thru many splits. The last 3 years it has gone up but since has hit its high point and now just fluctuates between 70-80. The only way to make money now is to buy the dips and sell higher. It sucks to watch every week it go up then down consistently.
Progressive is up 5.64% to 73.55
Awesome growth vs October last year. nice boost in property policies. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/progressive-reports-october-2017-results-132802699.htmlProgressive Reports October 2017 Results

Earnings beat estimates by 20+% and the stock price falls. Only in PGR World.
pgr record earnings. buy and make a fortune by next summer.
Progressive is down 4.95% to 74.10
Will the stockholders be rewarded for putting their money into PGR? A good quarter should prod the board into raising the dividend. We deserve it.
Progressive is down 4.92% to 88.36
The company will return One Billion Dollars to policy holders due to fewer claims than expected. who are these stock traders who are driving the stock price down? Manipulaters? My logic only shouts bigger profits for PGR.
Dropped Progressive insurance today. Get into politics Reap what happens progressive.
I'm getting seasick!!
"38,000 fatal car crashes a year in the US. 4.4M additional injury crashes in the US each year. Average Auto Insurance claim is $17k. 87% drivers insured. PGR has 11% market share. Urban areas are seeing reduction in crashes somewhere between 50-75% during Covid shutdown. Imagine the savings over 2 months..."

"Hey Barnacle B, where ya at Bra? Been a little quiet lately."

"This analyst says get out while you still can:""In our view, Progressive Insurance (NYSE:PGR) appears to be fully valued based on its current stock multiple. Our analysis of this data indicates that loss cost trends are plateauing, pricing is flat to down and repair costs are going up — partially offset by declining bodily injury costs. We might be at the peak of this cycle and results might be flattish from here. Hence, we would consider lightening up on personal-auto-predominant stocks based on valuation.""https://www.twst.com/interview/commercial-lines-among-the-most-favorable-insurance-subsectors"
"ANYBODY, why for two days does this company or is it mgmt. team act so badly?????"

"PGR beats (up 39% from last year) and goes down. RLI missis, and goes up. Why???"
nice
Do they really have that much cash that the dividend is 5% and payout ratio is 4.5%?
"At first glance April results look grim with $316m in GAAP earnings, down 67% y/y. But PGR received $200m in cash premiums not reported on income statement and didn’t pay out $700m in losses reported, which means FCF was $900m higher than reported earnings. Not so grim? Also policies sold up double digits across the board— seems to me to have been a great month"
"what is really interesting , is how Progressive is under pricing Geicoalso, watch Geico for adding coverage you already have , such as roadside , all new cars come with that"

"Thank you Progressive for doing the right thing. It is never right for a news host to make fun of a 17 year old, it is small and petty.I will call on Monday and see about switching my Liberty Mutual Policies."
"1 billion hansout is exceptional idea from CEO.No we should cut costs for 1 billion including CEO Salary, so that CEO would know whose money she is handing out.."
"I have been watching the final 20 minutes of trading. The volume perked up as the last minutes of buying or selling selling before earnings are reported. I expected this flurry of activity but, I expected the price to rise. But the sellers have been active and I don't think that bodes well for the earnings report."
Progressive reached an all time high at 99.01
a raising stock. I need an airplane to fly
"Morgan Stanley downgraded $RKT 10 days ago when it was $17....it is pushing towards $20 at the moment. F MS, just started my position!"
Maybe something to do with employee pay raises
"Buy in the low 90s, sell at +100.Easy money."
Remarkable performance for a bad market day; closing near daily high on above-daily volume.....maybe we've touched bottom?
Under 95 is a discount
Sell sell sell ! This company is understaffed and overrated. Customer service has suffered drastically. Pgr will lose tons of customers vv soon !
Do you guys think the earnings report will be positive
Why does the dividen yeild say 5%? Isn't it .4%
What is wrong with this stock? Why so hated?
"With America shutting down, there should be a lot less driving over the next several weeks. Would this not benefit auto insurance companies like Progressive? Less accidents will lower loss ratio."
Progressive turned out to be more expensive then my other choices. Go figure.

Most policies written for a year....nothing will cure the lower rates/higher claims/lower margin problem except time....til rate increases and (hopefully) new policy revenues kick in over the next year...

This is the best finTech insurance app in the market. Superb ease of doing business
is this worth anything
This company only cares about stealing your money. They change policies and have different agents telling g different stories to what is on the policies
"I've been waiting for a decline in Insurance stocks and the one-two punch of Hurricanes ""Harvey"" and ""Irma"" have provided that buying opportunity. Up until this year, I would have been on the doorstep of Travelers as I (was) a customer of theirs, but after being a Travelers customer for most of this decade, I tired of their uncompetitive rate hikes for unblemished multi-policy holders, like myself. After much research and comparisons, I chose to make my insurance needs (Home & Auto) commitment, and now investment commitment with Progressive. Bought in with my initial position at yesterday's close. I think the price weakens is near the end as much of Harvey and Irma has been taken out of the stock price already. Should there be any more pullbacks, I'll just treat them as buying opportunities for my cash."
PGR is up 5.64% to 73.55
"No reason for this to continue to fall, but reason doesn't seem to be in play in the markets!!"
wildfires will have an impact
why this selloff ...? agoust report so disaster?
Class action lawsuit for Progressive on fraud
Almost all the real insurance companies have a criminally low P/E. Meanwhile LMND hemorrhages money and is going vertical from Motley Fool articles. PGR literally prints money.
As soon as the rest of the market goes up Progressive goes down and vice versa. Acts more like the Vix!
They are paying out a $4.46 a share div. and the stock price is down $4.50 robbing Peter to pay Paul.
Progressive is down 13.46% to 67.56
"Combined ratio increased by 12.6% to 96......Combined ratio is single largest factor on earnings.This would partly be explained by return to normal miles driven.Regardless, I see the drop as an over-reaction, and have taken advantage of the sale price.PGR frequently does this after earnings. If it's like the typical overreaction we will just smile in a few days.If you don't understand what Combined ratio is you need to look it up...."
"Hang in there, people. Investors will soon how undervalued this is and dump money into it"
PGR is down 5.80% to 75.85
Can someone please explain how this special divy effects the stock price?All things being equal does the stock price fall $4.60 on the x-divy date?
"Beats on earnings goes down, misses on earnings goes down, goes up when some want it to"
Most weird thing. There are no news with this stock yet is down big time on an almost record day in the markets
"Daily volume slightly below normal day after day. With earnings due next week, we should see some volume and direction. Strange."
This stock has been dead in the water for the last year! May be time to move on?
Crossing 50 day
Higher close on 5 of the last 6 days; recovering nicely.Hope some readers took advantage of the buying opportunity.

good luck longs

It would be fair that if wages are falling due to coronavirus that also progressive insurance wages would fall! Esepcially CEO. 1 billion handout...
"great numbers, so glag I didn't sell"
If it drops today after earnings...as always...buy and hold for 8 points in 2 weeks. as constant as sun rises.

Awesome buy

"Adam, I don't think many heard about the $2.25 dividend. And, the quarter had lots of positive results. They just need to control non-claim expenses. Dividend will be paid to all stockholders as of January 7. Good opportunity!!!"
PGR reached a 52 Week low at 65.51
Smiling!
"Why isn't PGR rising on fewer auto claims? People will continue to own cars in the ""new normal."" People will continue to want and pay for auto insurance. I see nothing but up!"
