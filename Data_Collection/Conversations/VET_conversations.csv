One last time for the fund managers to get in before we start our earnings two weeks. Glta! Oil will be near 100 very soon. Lack of investment could give us record prices! $BTE $OXY $CPE $RIG $OIH $SU $XOM $CVX $VET $EOG $CNQ $LPI $CLR $CDEV $CPG $ATH $CNQ $USO
"I wouldn't touch oil related stocks right now (other than long holds) -- taper tantrum coming within 2 weeks, oil correction to mid-70s to test the water, and hedge danger specific to VET on ER day."
Vermollion Reaction Tomorrow Buying Opportunity
Just as Predicted we hold the $13.25 Support and closed above $13.25 @ $13.36 after hiting a low of $13.06. Tomorrow VET will rise again. Trading Range will be $13.00 to $13.75
Suncor doubles dividend. What will vet report. Oh ya let's see.... our net debt has been reduced to 1.7B our long term debt stands at 2B. We are working hard to return to a dividend model. Executive compensation has been increased for a job well done!! Vet is a compelling investment
Cash Is King
"Oil green, VET red. Feeling more comfortable now."
hey VET team! hope everyone had a great weekend! strong start to the week. let's keep this tread going!
"On Nov 9 we will get the Q3 results, but keep in mind its the 3 months ended on Sept 30. So it will not live up to high expectations of the NG price swing and oil price increases due to hedging. We may very likely see a dip coming. Q1 and Q2 of 2022 will paint a very, very rosy picture, by then we should be at $20USD per share. Enjoy the ride and don't look at the day-to-day fluctuations."
"From fellow oil investors and the Dominator we congratulate all of you on this wicked report! It’s just the beginning as the money will begin to roll back into this sector!

So Far so good $13.35 from $14.50 although i originally sold at $14.33. bought again at $13.60 sold at $13.74 as I was expecting it to drop. This friday will be a RED DAY so wait until tomorrow to buy this will drop more patience
"Another week finished in the red, as I called it past Monday. Doubt next week will be much different..lackluster if anything. An observation. Look at the chart for VET, 1 month before the actual earnings day in August. You'll notice that 1 month before earning day, VET treaded water up until the actual date, only to then tank. Fast forward to now...past 1 month, VET, once again, is treading water identically and, ironically, earnings report is less that 2 weeks time. So, could we see another sell off a day or 2 after November 9th?? . For me, depending how VET will trade the next 5 trading days.... might be wise to sell off some shares. Especially if we see a repeat pattern as in August. Look like it tanked 20% back then. Hmmm..."
"If you're ever unsure. Just remember, -oil is up and so far steady.-debts being repaid-share price movements are the ebs and flows of investing.-Vermilion paid dividends continuously for 16 years (to my knowledge) -it is a well run company.-dividends may eventually be reinstatedIt is a good investment until the full story changes. Patience my friends."
Hundreds of Cargo ships all backed up off shore alone will bring the price of oil over 100 dollars a barrel in the near term as demand will go through the roof. There's no way of getting around it. Not to mention winter is coming. The cold air is heading south quickly. It's all common sense. VET earnings are going to be great. The extremely low P/E will be even lower. Theres no where to go but up. Glta
Added Small Position at $13.10 will add more if it drops tomorrow
"Short squeeze? Hi volume so far, interesting to follow the development during the day. I'm not selling before 20 CAD ... but not before the dividend is back!"
"Blackstone Inc. co-founder Stephen Schwarzman said the world is facing energy shortages so severe they could cause social unrest.His comments were echoed by Larry Fink, who said there’s a high probability of oil soon reaching $100 a barrel, especially with many governments and investors pushing back against investments in fossil fuels.“Inflation, we are in a new regime,” said Fink, chairman of BlackRock Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager.“There are many structural reasons for that. Short term policy related to environmentalism, in terms of restricting supply of hydrocarbons, has created energy inflation and we are going to be living with that for some time.”Several analysts have said that European countries could halt gas exports to neighbors if winter’s colder than normal and prices keep rising.$SU $CNQ $ENB $COP $BP $OXY $VET $XOM $TOT $CVX $MPC $EOG $CLR $EPD $E $KMI $PSX $HAL $PTR $SNP $WMB $BKR $EC $IMO $CQP $MMP $TRP $XOG"
Congradulations to those who added shares yesterday at low $13.00 range Vermilion should rise today as Chevron Reported positive cash flow. Will help oil stocks. $14.00 or close ton$14 is a sell and wait for pullback. Assuming its a friday if VET makes gains in morning hour will lose most of gain by mid afternoon.
"Looks like most oil companies will raise dividends, increase buybacks and pay down debt for Q3 report.What will vet probably do. Say they are paying down debt but nothing changes, string you along by saying they want to return to dividend model because.....it's the right thing to do. Keep telling you how compelling this investment is. SHOW ME THE MONEY!!"
