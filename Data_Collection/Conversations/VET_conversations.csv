"Good morning everyone.I would like to share my personal humble opinion with all of you.VET has a very diversify board. Longs like myself ,Logan etc... Shorts which include Joe , Ducky and his entourage. Retiree like Haresh and his Windsor Group etc...Let me conclude it was a very unusual time for VET board for the past six weeks.Since Aug20 low we are almost double in share price and volume !!!Some of us including me, are tempted to take some profit and buy back dips?The only problem I am having is the dips are not anymore what they use to be.The dips are shallow and the volume is much higher.IMHO typical seasonal rotation , mostly from technology and gold.OK folks let's reflect what happened so far in world.World is heading into energy crisis. With all ESG initiatives and scrutiny, all O&G companies cutting down on Capex . O&G inventories are at the lowest in years.USA is still struggles with Ida aftermath. China ordered to oil & gas company to secure as much O&G as possible at any cost for upcoming winter season. China already implements electricity restriction due to shortage of LNG ,heating oil and coal. Prices skyrocketing , LNG is up 500% comparing to the same time last year.Oct 1 (Reuters) - European wholesale gas prices rose on Friday morning amid lower Russian flows at the start of the new gas year and record high Asian prices intensifying competition for LNG supplies to fill storages as winter approaches.Fri, October 1, 2021, 6:32 AMOct 1 (Reuters) - European wholesale gas prices rose on Friday morning amid lower Russian flows at the start of the new gas year and record high Asian prices intensifying competition for LNG supplies to fill storages as winter approaches.* The November gas price at the Dutch TTF hub, a European benchmark, was up 5.97 euros at 96.47 euros per megawatt hours (MWh) by 0951 GMT.* On the ICE exchange, the contract briefly rose to 100 euros per megawatt hour on Friday morning.* The British equivalent was down 8.15 pence at 245.85 pence per therm after surging 35 pence on Thursday.* Russian gas supplies via the Yamal-Europe pipeline fell on Friday by almost 77% from Thursday, although the drop was expected with suppliers Gazprom not booking additional capacity for the new gas year, which starts on Oct. 1, after old contracts expired.* ""Low Gazprom pipe via Poland into Germany; outright heating demand growing and the combination of these two means injections [into storage] will slow at a time when they are still needed,"" an analyst said.* A rise in supply from Norway was only able to avoid higher prices rather than causing prices to come off, he added.* ""The main lever that needs to be pulled to bring prices lower is a significant year-over-year increase in Russian gas being delivered to Europe, which looks possible next year,"" analysts at Energy Aspects said in a report.* Gazprom has completed laying the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany and is awaiting certification from the German regulator, expected to take until early 2022.* Meanwhile Europe continues to face fierce competition for liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes from Asia.* Chinese buyers are seeking more LNG cargoes despite record prices, bidding above market rates as the winter season starts with the country's gas inventory low.I remember some of you like Patel Trader tried to confuse as that country like Venezuela , Libia some Africans counties will bring more production to the market. O&G infrastructures in those country are old and run down and are in investments need. Majority of O&G companies are sitting tight on theirs valets. Folks , world needs energy which is essential for our prosperity and survival.Do you remember name that person who held a huge VET shares number.He exited VET and sold everything in low CAD 8.0 to buy a beach house. How he fills now?In this environment all O&G companies will make enormous FCF and start to give back tons of money too loyal shareholders and to attract new one.At the end who will resist 10% dividends. Some of you will argue about inflation and slowing economy if prices of O&G stays high. Demand is very strong and only will get worst. I always use my personal instinct in my own comfort zone to invest wisely.I never fill so strong about ENERGY.IMPO it is energy time.At the end on matter who we are , we all have the same goal in mind to make tons of money. Luckily , I loaded up on energy companies last year when nobody wants them. The question remains if we succeed but that is completely up to us. We have to be one voice despite our differences and great united VET family.Thank you and have a wonderful and relaxing weekend."
Breaking News.Nov 09.2021 after markets close Vermilion Energy is releasing III Q results.
"Think long term people. Go for dollars and not pennies. Going out 2+ years we'll be a lot higher in share price. Commodity prices will stay solid for the next 6 months . As time goes on, Covid will ease off and more confidence will be restored within people even more. Again, at some point share buy-backs and a re0instaed divy will happen. Sell if you want but you won't get much of a great buying chance going forward like now. Obviously, we will get share price sell - offs but longer term....its a no brainer"
"Why will this price oscillate to 15 percent? Dropped from $16.40+ to $14.33 on 02/17/21 then dropped a month later to $2.26 on 03/16/20! Then less then 2 weeks later on 03/30/20 the last dividend was paid. A year later VET finally ran above $8, and like a yoyo, at least moved to the upside! So can VET hold $11 plus? So I do not see any real support showing that the price will see the $15-20 or a double. Good news, Vet is above $10.00! I hope people see more than I do and VET hits $30+. Does any one see support taking the price above $20.00?"
"i’ll buy in at $10 on Monday, sharp drop according to analysts tomorrow"
"Great news and let’s keep the momentum going: Hold/Buy Keep Shorts Buying Back Better for us because VETs low low PE; awesome book value; solid past two quarters of FCF; based on oil price should have great company report COB November 9Shorts covered 9% (Bought 750,000 shares) Short Interest (Shares Short)7,980,000Short Interest Ratio (Days To Cover)3.9Short Percent of Float5.09 %Short % Increase / Decrease-9 %Short Interest (Shares Short) - Prior8,730,000"
Lucky Ducky is having fantastic day.
"Huge gains this past couple of weeks. That said.... any decent downturn in share price.... use it as a glorious opportunity to buy. As I mentioned before here. Winter is coming and Upcoming report card should be pretty good and that should boost the price up even more as we get close to years end. There's a lot of good news surrounding VET right now so don't let the sell off scare you off. I haven't sold a share yet and don't intend too any time soon. Unless, it hits very close to $20....then I would reevaluate"
Longs will HOLD
"DO THE MATH!!!!!!!Do not forget. For every TTF $1 increase = and increase of 28MM CAD. TTF just hit 34 . Brent touching $80Q No reason VET could not see low teens.From a recent article.Vermilion also maintains exceptional torque to higher pricing as each US$1 WTI increase in oil price brings with it CAD$17 MM in extra free cash flow. More importantly, an increase in European natural gas pricing by $1/mmbtu brings an incredible CAD$28 MM in additional free cash flow. Over the last year, European natural gas inventories have declined significantly from a 1000 BCF surplus to a 250 BCF deficit when compared to the 5 year average. This points to a structural supply deficit which will put further upwards pressure on pricing as inventories draw down."
"Not a small deal: (NYSE: VET) is pleased to announce that it has achieved certification under the EO100 Standard for Responsible Energy Development (2017) from Equitable Origin for three of its natural gas production sites in west-central Alberta : Granada , Eta Lake and Carrot Creek .Vermilion is the third producer of natural gas in Canada to have achieved this rigorous certification, which is based on an independent assessment of performance targets within five Environment,"
On BNN energy sector index....WTI has rebounded but as of now posting this...only 3 are in the red and VET is one of them lol. https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/oil
Return updates for us longs.... A 5 day return --23%....a 2 month return ---65% ....a 6 month return -- 60%...yr to date return --- 151% and a 1 yr return ---327% !! Not over yet. Wait another yr until the divy comes back and dividend fund holders buy in lol. Gotta love this!!!
What's the prediction for tomorrow?
"Crude up AH despite so so API report, and NG ripping again today. It looks like many commodities (O & Gs, PMs) are breaking out or near a breakout. PM & mining stocks up solidly today during a risk on day- I haven't seen that in a while. Since Crude broke over 80 on Friday, it's retested and bounced around the 79/80 level 6 or so times. Too early to call it support, but I can smell the combustive burning of oil and gas and smelting of valuable metals as the value of the US dollar embers away in smoke. Smells like inflation to me. $CPE $LPI $SBOW $BP $WTI $VET $PBR $BCEI $DVN $KGC $FSM $BTG"
With what the commodity prices skyrocketing as of late. And today... VET should be over $14 at the very least imho. Still more room to run in my view.
"if oil indeed goes to $100 a barrel in 2023, we will see usd $35 or more for this stock."
"Now VET can be a perfect target for a take over temptation. With P/E ratio so low and high profit margin, buy VET is a better investment than to find a new oilfield or paying divident. For companies market cap 2~400 B, merging VET is nothing. Even at $ 25~30 CAN a share, VET is still a bargain."
Nice Baby Yahoo Vermilion dropping back down buying opportunity will be patient tomorrow and friday could bring vargain prices lets see how low it goes today
How much of their revenue is from natural gas? I would think their Q3 will be amazing considering natural gas and energy crisis in Europe.
"PAY DOWN THE DEBT. Excellent idea. No buybacks, no dividend.!!! Debt is what crushes oil and gas companies."
"The recent layout By Curtis Hicks gave out pretty much tells us that any red days you get with VET are a gift for us long term holders. Going out 12, 18 + months out.... we'll be greatly rewarded.. Take advantage of red days now as much as you can. Once 2022 arrives, you just know buy backs and a Divy is just around the corner so....let that sink in."
"Great pop today! Now that we are over $10 US, many more US funds are now allowed to buy Vermilion. This can only help with new money coming in. Wait till we institute the dividend, this will bring in more funds and fixed income investors."
"Goldman Sachs Hikes Oil Price Forecast To $90 end of 2021. If true, strong buy and VET’s price should increase nicely. Shorty are you listening to the experts, it is your money and you are losing it now. Just an observation."
oil up a buck vet up a dime lol lol lol
"Based on their October presentation materials, if O&G prices remain at this level - dividend comes back on in H1 next year. When that happens, there will be a lot of institutional buying (many funds can't own stocks that don't pay dividends). Things are looking up for this company in the next 1-2 years !! Long-term hold."
Congratulation to everyone who bought below $7.00 ... No doubt that we will see this stock will trade over $20.00 by next year...
This is how you make wealth!! Thank you VET family!! Long and Strong 
In United Kingdom  Petrol ️ stations run dry and prices at pump are at an eight year high ! InshaAllah I open a branch in England one day so now vet in much demand !!!
Oil is coming back up. Hopefully a good day.
I believe opec will only increase oil production marginally on Monday and leave the market in deficit. Great for oil prices and great for vet.
Can we have Raoof come and say it won't go over $13?? So it can go over 13$ 
Crude oil has started the week on a strong footing as the global power crunch continues to raise expectations for higher gas-to-oil switching demand at a time where OPEC+ maintains its modest pace of monthly oil production increases. Saudi Aramco estimates the gas shortage has already lifted oil demand by an additional 0.5m barrels/day.
She’s holding well today all things considered ! I do expect a pullback this week though. Great support here
Please welcome Gladiatoraoof to VET board.
"The U.S. is talking to OPEC+ members over energy supply and is “expressing in private our concerns,” State Department Spokesman Ned Price said on Thursday. U.S. natural gas prices have more than doubled this year, with the peak winter demand season still weeks away.“Oil consumption will continue to outpace supply until the end of this year, but it looks set to be a different story in 2022,” said Stephen Brennock, an analyst at brokerage PVM Oil Associates."
Told you yesterday red today 100%. Told you I did not trust API numbers again this week. I expect a 15% haircut. I do not see any catalysts till Congress passes both infrastructure and reconciliation bills.
"Raoof: calculate your VET gains trading in-out with ""what if I just bought the recent low and held it""... Guarantee you'd be up more if you just bought and hold that dip on the weekly."
Thank goodness I sold on Friday. Had a good run for a couple weeks.
"Lol, and now I see $12.30. Raoof, how is that possible? I'm sorry Raoof, but I hope this will finally teach you a lesson to stop making your predictions and tell others to sell. Everyone should decide for themselves what to do. Honestly, even I didn't expect this much of jump when I saw the market this morning, but I love it very much."
Congrats to everyone! Especially the dip buyers on Aug 19 and 20th!! They are up almost $3!
According to TD Security estimation VET will have 1 time FCF to debt ratio at the end of 2022.
Thank you fellow longs for holding the line while the new blood jumped in. Good company. Good future.
"@Manto you asked me about source for Suncor buying Whitecap, but I see Ryan deleted his post so you cannot see my response. I don’t have a source because I didn’t post that, it was Ryan and I asked him the same question because I couldn’t find any info. The rumor don’t seem to be true because there is no info about it and I also went back to listen what Nuttall said about Suncor and Whitecap today on BNN but no mention about that deal. Hope this helps. I always want to check when there are some rumors."
TSX open tomorrow???
European Gas Surges 60% in Two Days as EU Sounds Alarm
"My VET family, further to @Gladiator’s post below, don’t let such posts scare you in selling your positions. I know that many here are tempted to take profits and of course it’s understandable, we’re here to make money so it’s fine to lock some profits, but if you have invested in VET for the long term, especially if you have a nice low average, my suggestion is don’t sell everything, keep your core position as you may not see that price anymore. If you invested in VET for a quick gain then it’s fine. If you’re a daily trader, you’ll find your way in and out. I don’t like to tell others what to do and this my suggestion to keep your core position is only for those that are holding VET as a long term investment and I’m telling this based on my experience as a long term investor. I can say I’m very happy that I kept my core position."
Long live the VET.
Congrats we are up again
Going to be a good day for my OIL BOYS
52 weeks high today? Lots of VET peer reached it already today.
"Our VET is on fire, it has surpassed CVE, I have both, I know many here too..."
"And our Raoof said we reached the peak at $11.68...and our Raoof said we'll see low $11.40 before we see $12 .Raoof, how come I see $12.07 now? Do you see that you were wrong again."
D is for David vets biggest booster and buyer of oil wells
CIBC World Markets raised VET price target to C$15.00
"Short review...VET was $24-36 per share just a few years ago. Energy prices are back AND this is a much more focused company. I see this as a $24-36 stock, the world just doesn't realize it. Good luck longs."
""" The Natural Gas Weekly Forecasts have rallied significantly during the course of the trading week to reach towards the $6.50 level before rolling back over. At this point in time, the market is looking very exhausted, which is not a huge surprise considering that we had gotten so parabolic. At this point, I have to question whether or not we have put in the top? That is a question that remains to be seen, but at this point in time it is very likely that we will be paying close attention to the idea of whether the winter is warm or cold, and that will throw this market around quite drastically.Yes, there is a significant lack of supply at the moment, but the question is how much longer will that last? It is likely that the market may have gotten far too ahead of itself at least in the short term, so I would not be surprised at all to see the $5.00 level tested. If we break down below there then I would start looking towards the $4.50 level for support, and then eventually the $4.00 level.Historically speaking, we are heading into a bullish time of year, so I do think that it is only a matter of time before people get involved, but maybe not necessarily at the $6.00 above. That being said, if we were to break above the $6.50 level, that would lead to an even more parabolic move, but at this point one would have to wonder how many people would be willing to buy at that region?"""
"Keep holding your stocks folks, don’t sell and let the shorts cover. We are going back to 20 and above"
National Bank increases VET PT to CA$18 from CA$13.50
"18.72 is the next resistance, keep holding"
"With 7,980,000 shares short from last update, every .25 up shorts down about $2 million. I would imagine they will need to cover even more shares. Also, congrats longs who are benefiting from VET’s upward movement."
Cheers to everyone that ignored the noise ;) Vermilion is on track to hit pre Covid levels. Enjoy the ride everyone !
Great week VET fam!! Have a good weekend everyone!! Enjoy it with your loved ones! Nothing is worth your health and family. Money comes after. Take care.
"The U.S. will reopen its land borders to nonessential travel next month, ending a 19-month freeze due to the COVID-19 pandemic as the country moves to require all international visitors to be vaccinated against the coronavirus."
"According to october released, they ate expecting debt to ffo 1.9 which is caculated at 68$ USD. OMG.Feeling good with commodity prices but few doubts on their production and reserves a year ago pruducion was well over than 90000But it falled sharply to 85000 due to depletion .Wonder how their future productions would be with their low cash protecting capex.Even though stronger netbacks with lower stock prices make this stock wonderful.Goodluck peers"
Over 80 WTI tonight! The oil sector is coming back to life! Greed is really beginning to kick in! Bank earnings this week and what better way for them to be talking about investing into these spaces ;). The energy investor is going to make a ton of money over the next while. Don’t let any silly story teller tell you any differently that the demand of oil has much so succeeded the worlds supply from ore pandemic levels. It doesn’t take a scientist to understand! GLTA!

Shorting oil (/CL) until we test that $75 USD range. Scraped ~700 free shares of VET so far!
"Wow.. as they say... patience is a virtue! Like myself and others have said... red days are for loading up and green days are for happy days. Well, all those red days we had.... smoked by $10! Can't see vet going below $10 anymore, especially with nat gas surging, WTI over $70 and winter a few months away. Once we break $11...it's going higher! And we have no dividend yet! Wait until that arrives! Vet is generating so much FCF right now it isn't even funny. Yup, good days still await us. "
Up .16 after hours. Hopefully that will hold fairly steady until Monday morning and climb on the day and my Canadian friends can climb on the train on Tuesday.
With all this good news circulating around the energy sector.. it's beyond me how vet is not over 14 or $15 ...mind-boggling. Seriously.
Anyone know how/if the energy issues in Europe are going to benefit $vet over other cdn energy companies? $vet has a larger presence overseas (real analysis plz - can't handle the gifs lol)
$$MAD MONEY$$14 days ago$VET.TO conversationVET will be $20+ very soon regardless of oil price. Need your patience.
VET news: We shall have an appearance from Raoof any moment now. Stay Tuned!
Bought for the dividend years back!I know they are trying to reduce debt! Can't they do both even 1 cent a month to start? Many retired individuals own it and depend on dividends!
after the report for the third quarter VET will cost $30
"Don't know who is selling, but someone is....Almost 5 million shares today,,,, All I know is, it want me,,,, lol"
Never ever buy right out of the gate. VET pattern..... immediately climbs then within minutes...declines.. Predicted pattern. Weak start... we should be over $14! Joke!
I'm impressed stayed green most of the day! very impressed.
Vet offers a lot of torque with high oil price. It should double and triple easily.
The ENTIRE market has sold off and VET is flat/green. What does that tell you? it has strength
"VET’S PE is 2.26; So if today VET’s PE was five times what it is now it would be 11.3 and price would be fives times 9.16 so price would be $45.8 USD. CHEVRON PE is 55.49 as a comparison. VET has plenty of room to run up in price while still offering incredible value. Also, would not want to be short VET. So hold tight and enjoy the ride.Short Interest (Shares Short)7,980,000Short Interest Ratio (Days To Cover)3.9"
October is one of the most volatile months for Stock market which means you can make the most money in the up and down swings
"Raoof, stop dude. There is an entry point price for everyone. As long as it’s basically a good healthy company with a future, it’s all relative. I realize you aren’t a sit back and watch it grow kind of guy, but you might try it now and then."
"Well, we can't be too surprised with todays pull back. I mean, really. That's OK... use this to purchase a bit because this will go higher closer to November earnings day. Things are already being factored in much earlier I'm guessing."
"Good job Raoof! We might well close above the high this morning - the tide is shifting back, and the weekly chart is ready for the next leg up. Don't get trapped shorting here, there are bigger things than 4hr chart levels starting to play out."

"My comment disappeared….Lol, I commented that something happened to this board because I see that even neutral opinions would get disliked. Maybe someone who missed the ship? I will not repeat everything, only this part, that this ship will continue sailing, this is our VET. It will pass through calm seas and rough seas. We already saw a very rough sea last year but one if for sure, this ship didn’t sink last year and will not sink for many more years. It is up to everyone here to decide if they want to jump in and when they want to jump in. Maybe some here want to wait for a bigger pullback. I know that many here, including me expected a pullback (as it would usually be the case), but that didn’t happen. When it will be, at what price and whether it will be, no one can say. So if you believe in VET you stick to it, but if you are not sure about VET and you don’t have confidence in VET, there are always other options on the market."
"Great stock, can’t wait to see what this is at when crude is over $100!"
Holy Breakout Batman.
"Woo-hoo, I was away 1 hour, and now we are at $12.74?! Did VET just outperform its peers. I agree with others, maybe something else is cooking here."
Tomorrow is Friday. It may go up or it may go down. That's my prediction 
"First time in over a year, Yahoo's 'one year target price' for VET has changed (from $42.50)"
Congrats to all the longs here. I wish I was still along for the ride. But all of you that rode this and still are deserve the win.
https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/cold-winter-could-send-oil-000000510.html
VET is flying under the radar. They now have new management so 9 point ventures should no longer shun them. This stock will easily double before year end. Almost a billion in earnings in just the last 2 quarters! Easy money to be made here IMHO. She will rise from the cool ashes! . GLTA
"Natural Gas Markets have fallen a bit during the course of the trading session on Thursday to reach down towards the $5.40 level, which is an area that has been supportive in the past and now that we have turned around the way we have, I suspect that it is only a matter of time before we go higher. After all, part of the pullback was due to Vladimir Putin suggesting that Russia was going to continue pumping natural gas at a high rate to the European Union. However, natural gas markets are extraordinarily localized, so this will have minimal to no effect on the United States."
$75 + oil coming oink oink 
"AMAZING !!!! $14.28 I always believed but to see it come true is just bitter sweet. Please someone call Raoof back, his negativity fuels the VET ship ahahah"

How much of this stock is now trading on OIL/GAS price emotion vs fundamentals now? How much is that premium?
Who else rode this one down from the 30$ range ?
what do u guys think about air canada anyone own it thinking of buying it
"WTI/Brent overview .""Crude oil markets have rallied significantly to kick off the trading session on Monday, as we continue to see upward pressure on energy overall.At this point, the $75 level WTI should be supportive, and should be thought of as the “floor the market” currently. With this, I think it is more likely that buyers will come back into the market to pick up dips for value.Pullbacks at this point in time, the $80 level for Brent should be supportive, and I think that support extends down to the $77.50 level. With that in mind, I have no interest in shorting this market and I do think that dips continue to be bought. Energy markets have been extraordinarily bullish as of late, and the most recent move has been yet another example of this, kicking off a bullish flag that could measure for a move towards the $88 level before it is all said and done."""
"CEI short report hurting the sector today (its down 50%). A good thing, because we'll burn off the overbought indicators. Buy signal is Raoof saying sell."
Choppy waters in the market. Oil will stay stable..let's see what Happens ...
"Happy Thanksgiving to my Canadian VET team, and to mu US team and everyone else who is not celebrating, have a nice and very green day!"
Oil is up @ moment  Is thee best place in the world !!!
"To OPEC meeting: too dangerous to short /CL here, and certainly can't long. Best bet, avoid oil trades, but add to long stock positions if OPEC creates a dip opportunity."
Reason VET went down today was because investors saw the opportunity and sold their shares at $14.00
Just remembering:► Vermilion has significant leverage to European naturalgas prices (+C$1/mmbtu = +$28MM incremental FFO**)
"Good morning everyone, my wish from Friday has come true, green, lots of green this week. I’m back to my office every day now, but I’m still here with you, just cannot post. Good luck everyone! This is just the beginning!"
Think today was fun. Wait until 8.7 million short shares have to cover or get flamed as price rapidly rises. Short squeeze with 4.5 days to cover based on current yahoo’s August 31 numbers.
Let me guess the message from the psycho guy today- Sold the shares (that he didn't have) at the beginning of the day with a price over $13.80- Bought back more share under $13.40 (that he can't afford)Miss the guy's message.
Just how large of a natural gas producer is VET ?
The market took a correction hence we are here. Remember WTI is @ 71 and Brent @74. VET will retest $10

Raoof can you explain yourself?? Sell and it goes higher. Sell Sell Sell and it heads even higher.

Just the beginning :) congrats longs! We broke 13!
"I'm now beginning to wonder if November earnings report is already being factored in? Before, at times, stocks would move up or down a couple of days before or after the call but with VET.... seems like it's weeks before the calling. Last 2 reports the shares moved way before and sold off shortly after the call so....might be a good move take a chunk off the table ( profits only) if the stock stagnates very close to the date. Just my opinion, of course. We'll pay attention to the pattern as time goes on. This has been a down week so next week we could see the same movement."
"Perhaps this is a factor....New Line 3 pipeline ready to move oil from Canada to US: EnbridgePierre-Olivier Pineau, an energy expert at HEC Montreal business school said Line 3 ""is the first project in a long time to boost Canada's oil export capacity.""https://www.bing.com/search?q=canda+pipeline&form=ANNTH1&refig=d64f96a3d48045f4836a30b31456f3c2In turn, he said, that could help Canadian producers ""get a better price for their oil,"" which now sells at a discount because of landlocked Alberta's limited transportation access to world markets."

"A colder winter and soaring natural gas prices globally could lead to higher-than-expected oil prices at the end of this year, with the potential for oil hitting $85 per barrel in the fourth quarter, Goldman Sachs says.Goldman, which has a price forecast of $80 a barrel oil for the last quarter of 2021, believes that the natural gas crunch combined with a colder-than-usual winter in Europe and Asia could pose an upside risk of $5 a barrel to its Q4 price projection, the bank’s analysts said in a note on Sunday carried by Reuters."

We haven't even gotten started people! In 2022 VET will most likely pay $1 / shares special dividend and announce stock buybacks. In 2023 we're going to be breaking out of a 10 year pattern and start moving towards ALL TIME HIGH. This is going to happen.
Captain Raoof Has Command Vermilion to rise back from RED to Green we shall rise back patience my friends. Once Again Congrats to those who sold $14 or higher this morning
So jealous! Missed the boat
$14 coming oink oink 
So even at 10 dollars the P/E is now a whopping 2. This company is so undervalued it's nuts. Investors are now seeing this due to the revised estimates. VET is a 50 dollar stock. That will give VET a 10 P/E at this moment if est don't go up. Next year's est must go up. Est for next year have gone up to .70 cents from breakeven. Gl

High Natural Gas Prices Could Lead To 2 Million Bpd Extra Oil Demand
"Some options traders are betting that oil prices could jump to $200 a barrel by the end of next year.Call options at Brent at $200 a barrel for December 2022 traded 1,300 times on Wednesday"
"The market is likely to continue to see a lot of value hunting going forward, and quite frankly I do not see a scenario where you can short this market anytime soon. Eventually, a lot of this chaos will and, but right now is showing no real signs of doing so and it is obvious that the only trade over the last several months has been to by the dips."
"We're in a crazy pricing situation for European nat gas. Won't last forever, but could accelerate VET's debt reduction. Maybe a dividend comes sooner than we think?"

"Crude output will drop 260,000 barrels per day to 11.02 million bpd this year, and then rebound to 11.73 million bpd in 2022, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. In its previous forecast, the statistical arm of the Department of Energy had forecast a 200,000 bpd drop in 2021.I still stand by my forecast for triple-digit crude in late 2021 or early 2022 if power generators continue to demand oil instead of natural gas. I’ll admit this is still a wild-card prediction but if winter comes early to Europe, prices could rise rapidly."

"I bought Vet last year at around 6CAD, I have been selling my Vet since it was at 8.3 CAD around a month ago, my strategy is when it goes up a dollar then I sell some to lock profit. I still have some Vet left and may let it fly. But I want to remind everyone that when the market turns down this stock can go down very quickly. Do not forget lots of us here was so frustrated when it dropped from 11 CAD back to 7 CAD earlier on."

"My VET family you all know I'm long here and have a positive outlook on VET but I have to say something that may not be so positive at the moment. Since yesterday, there has been a discussion here about Nuttall buying VET and at first I believed it to be true and I was glad to hear it, but I did more research about it and now I'm not so sure. There are different information on different sources, but the up to date info is only available on the Ninepoint website (link below). If you look at all the other sources you cannot see some positions I know he holds, such as Cenovus and Whitecap. I’m sure Nuttall has position in both as I also have positions there, and both companies were one of his recent top picks. At one source (Bloomberg, link: https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SPROENEF:CN) you can see Torc Oil & Gas which was bought by Whitecap. If the info is current, this would be updated and it would not show Torc Oil. I also found a source that shows the date of his position as of Dec. 31, 2000 and it shows 1.75 mil shares (link: https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/vet) the same amount of shares as it shows on CNN as of today’s date (link: https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=VET&subView=institutional). We all know that Nuttall had a position in VET but he sold it at the beginning of this year (January or February). What may happen is that all these sources are not updated and show his old position, which he actually sold earlier this year. As I mentioned above, the current info is only available on Ninepoint website and the info is as of Aug 31 (link: https://www.ninepoint.com/funds/ninepoint-energy-fund/ ) and VET is not listed there. If Nuttall bought VET it was last week. Sorry, I don't want to spoil the party and I hope he bought it, but I have to verify this for sure. It seems we have to wait the info to be updated on Ninepoint website after today’s date, or Nuttall to be asked about VET on BNN Bloomberg, whichever comes first. In any case, I’m glad to see VET rising today, because if Nuttall didn’t buy it, at least we know the rise in the price wasn’t because of his buying, it’s just a normal movement that follows the energy sector."

"The West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil market has fallen rather hard during the trading session only to turn around and bounce drastically. This was a bit of an oversold condition after a massive move to the upside, so it is likely that we will continue to push towards the $80 level. Because of this, I am a buyer of dips and I do recognize that it is likely we will see a lot of volatility during the Friday session due to the Non-Farm Payroll figures coming out. With that in mind, I favor the upside, but I would like to see short-term pullbacks in order to take advantage of what has been a very strong uptrend. The $75 level should be a bit of a floor in the market at the moment."

"@Raoof...I can no longer be silent.I'm not a big time investor and I certainly do not know as much as many of you folks. I own 1600 shares of VET and enjoy heading over to this conversation board for any insights any of you might have. Much of it is good and helpful...unless it comes from Raoof (I'll reserve criticism of the barrage of Sesame Street gifs for another rant on another day).Raoof, you post SO often, and SO much of it is inaccurate or conflicting. And to support my claim, I'll play a game YOU TOLD US TO PLAY!!Yesterday, you posted early in the day celebrating your prediction (made on Tuesday) that there would be an early jump on Wednesday and that you timed it perfectly. And to your credit, you were right. Well done!! Then, soon after that you posted this:""Just Remember my post we aint staying above $10 for too long use the opportunity to sell and buyback cheaper. I want everyone to remember this post""You told us to remember, and so I shine a light on this post. And in this, you have been proven wrong. At this moment, one day later, the price has NOT fallen below $10 (Canadian). In fact, in pre-market prices, it is up a bit (it is 9:15 am ET as I type this).Here's my point: you can't celebrate perfect timing in one post and claim you are Nostradamus when in a later post, your timing is less than perfect. You post SO much and most of it is pure guess work. You are like the sports announcer who gives 5 pre-season predictions, each of them different from the other, and so by season's end...ONE of them is right, and the announcer then gloats to all how accurate he/she is.Please STOP. You are not helping most on this board with the opinions and guesses that you post."

"""WTI has been very bullish during the course of the week, as we have reached towards the $80 level. That being said, the market is respecting the $80 level, at least so far. Ultimately, I think this is a market that will find a reason to get above here, and when it does it becomes more of a “buy-and-hold” situation yet again. After that, the market probably looks at the $85 level for no other reason than the psychology of it. On pullbacks, I would anticipate that the $75 level offers a bit of support, as it was the previous high and a certain amount of “market memory” should come into the picture."""

Just now listening to the Vermilion Energy CEO's interview on Bloomberg news.He clearly mentioned even with current oil & natural gas prices until mid of 2022 there are unable to pay any amount of dividend. That means NO DIVIDEND until mid of next year. I'm really disappointed on this news.

"Saudi Energy Minister Dismisses Calls for Extra OPEC+ Barrels.“What we see in the oil market today is an incremental (price) increase of 29%, vis-à-vis 500% increases in (natural) gas prices, 300% increases in coal prices, 200% increases in NGLs (natural gas liquids) …,” Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told a forum in Moscow on Thursday.Asked about calls by major consumers like the United States for OPEC+ to increase production further to cool off rising oil prices, Prince Abdulaziz said: “I keep telling people we are increasing production.”He said OPEC+ would be adding 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November, and then again in the following months.The prices are being set by supply and demand. Crude oil is a volatile commodity and this time, the volatility is moving prices higher. Eighteen months ago volatility was driving prices lower.“We want to make sure that we reduce those excess capacities that we have developed as a result of COVID,” he said, adding that OPEC+ wanted to do it “in a gradual, phased-in approach."

"This stock is covered with debt which currently stops vet's dividened . Their debt ratings are BB- with interest rate with about 5.625%. You have to recognize that this stock is highly leveraged risky stock.Their recent earnings are better than other peers mainly due to vet's low hedging. Due to covid the oil has once crashed so oil sectors has hedged like 45$ wti like this but vet somehow has very little amount hedged.This means other peer groups earnings may rocket next year while vet's earnings will slightly increase. You may think this is a bit like sell report from mr.eric nuttel but here comes advantages. As you might have investigated this stock, vet has spread oil production wells all around the world like Australlia , germany ,canada,america,netherland etc..... with their plans all spread their effort and fees may seem unefficient compared to other company's volt in centralized production plan.But outcomes from nowdays may prove that they were actually right. Why? Just see the natural gas prices around the world! AECO ,DDF,NBP. This is only stock who are exposed to europe gas prices. See how europe is bleeding from their idiot green electricty plans.Their europe gas sales has stakes over quarter from their earnings eventhough their 70% gas are hedged.Their earnings will boost in current oil prices with better hedges next year! I know that there are some vet peers who are depressed with their suspended dividends while other oil stocks are hailing with incresing divideneds.But for their current status, I think it is right to pay out debts which is due to 2024 and 2025(Remember it is BB- rated and we can't sure about future oil prices).I suggest let vet to slash their 5.625 high interest debt for a while with their strengthning cash flow.Once debt problems are over vet will be a great cash givers or growing stocks for you.Glory to VET and let's give death to idiot short sellers+If you have invested in mining companys please watch out current energy prices .Energy fees are going crazy especially in europe so mining companys are withering.Their could be a higher metal prices due to hardness of production so I suggest swift to physical one. GOOD LUCK"

"""Brent continue to be bullish as well, as we have cleared the $80 level quite handily. At this point, the market then tested the $82.50 level, an area that could cause slight resistance, but as soon as we get some type of pullback it is likely that the buyers will jump back in. I anticipate that there should be a bit of a “floor the market” near the $75 level, assuming that the $80 level does not turn the market back around to the upside. There continues to be a lot of concern when it comes to the supply of petroleum, and whether or not the European Union will need to use petroleum to fire up power plants. All things been equal, there is really not much in the way to suggest that this market should fall apart anytime soon. This is a bit of a runaway trade, and I think that continues to be the case."""
Vet lags to wti passing $80. I think we all know by now that Vet is more influenced by Nat Gas price movement.
"Well, let's see if it can stay above $13 and not go below it."
