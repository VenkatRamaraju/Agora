It's important to look at the volume. Lost nearly a point on trivial volume
"Beyond Meat, Inc. (NASDAQ: BYND) (the “Company”) today announced that the Company is reducing its third quarter net revenues outlook. The Company is proceeding through its quarterly close, and based on preliminary results, the Company now expects third quarter net revenues of approximately $106 million as compared to prior guidance of $120 million to $140 million. Although the Company’s previous third quarter guidance anticipated a sequential decline in net revenues, the deceleration was larger than anticipated. Multiple factors contributed to the shortfall during the quarter."

"I get the feeling that ER pre-announcement was so that institutions could get cheap shares ahead of some positive news. What news, I don't know. Only thing that makes sense!!!"
Haven’t tried the products but a lot of my buddies like them. What’s your opinion about the meat-replacements?
"Did anyone else shop at 93? See ya at 150. I ate pizza hut beyond meat and asked about the response, they said Its great."
Why are they pushing out the ER by another week?
Just give me the gap fill and im out....

"There is no doubt that this is a great long-term investment. The demand for plant-based/vegetarian products is continually increasing. McDonald's knew that they needed to get ahead of the game in terms of meeting this demand. We've witnessed quite a dip the last could days, but we are recovering and will prosper in the long run."
"As a person who is always watching her weight I was excited about this product, at first. I think the burgers are good but there is almost just as much fat and calories in a regular hamburger and I don't even know what's in it. So what's the point? I can understand why interest is waning."

"Beef has gone up more than double in prices the past many months. I have converted my family diet more over the Beyond products such as Beyond sausages, Beyond ground beef and Beyond burger and Beyond meatball. I used Beyond ground beef to make the most delicious broccoli mushroom casserole. With California in the historical drought, we shall eat less meat as livestock has much greater water consumptions than the plants."

I am not understanding something. why are they pre-announcing revenue shortfall for 3rd Quarter when quarter is already completed and ER is approx 3 weeks away???
