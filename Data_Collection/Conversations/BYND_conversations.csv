Dreaming of a fomo situation to $150
"Beyond Meat is in McDonald’s, Walmart and Most restaurants, in a time were green is king. Ok am All chips in, amConvincedthis is Netflix 2009!"
I made a statement earlier about the Mcplant in Europe that got deleted somehow but it has launched in Austria and is near price parity with its animal counterpart it will expand to other parts in the next few months you can google this information more than 25% of Europeans have considered going on a more vegan diet in the past year I am not sure why this is not bigger news but the Mcplant in Europe alone will increase Beyonds revenue by 30 to 35%
"@ concerned citizen Soy product and byproducts are everywhere now, just like corns, inmost of the snacks, packages ready meals, and the meat you love are fed on them, and pass on to you in concreted forms. Do you think they are fed with organic soy and corn?"
BYND could Spike up anytime. Been Basing for last several days.Don't get caught short and Flat footed!BYND has a habit of spiking $10-$20 buck easily
"Gap filled up , now it will shoot up , watch out buyers and sellers ."
"Wall street is so nervously waiting for Powell's message tomorrow. Once no tapering, not yet reducing QE, then wall street will just carry on, business as usual for at least for another month, and I believe that Beyond Meat will also go much beyond tomorrow and the near future."
Starting buying a little and buy more if it does drop. Easily back to $120 in a month.
Could be the lowest volume trading day for the year (<1 Million shares) ...
"A leaf fall down because it is rotten and no longer fit, but many of us though it would smash our heads, and the shorts used the opportunity to make a wave for their own benefits. Just calm down. This is an opportunity instead"
The inability for this stock to keep a steady price range I’m sure has discouraged a lot of investors over the years
China and the European Union have barred the use of BYND's GMO soy. That is also the reason why health conscious people in the US avoid their products. Stick a fork in this one.... it's done.
Precisely the same con game!
"I haven't bought the stock yet, but I'm on this feed, because my stock got lumped iwth a company that worked with this company. I really want to buy this stock, because 1) it's a fully vegan company, 2) I've bought it before and am waiting to jump in again, 3) they're in Carl's Jr, 4) their 1lb meat has a lot less packaging than the others, 5) they're successful.I don't buy the stock because: 1) cocoa butter's expensive and doesn't really add anything (except for meat eaters who think it's most amazing), 2) yogurt not great, 3) chocolate in ice cream (we got to stop making chocolate a thing), 4) the mcdonald's fail, 5) don't have their act together (I mean they have momentum from their success and popularity, but they've been hitting bumps lately).If they get into mcdonald's - I don't care how and turn them vegan (at least one burger). I'll buy 100% again."
I have a feeling that the company will make an announcement soon. Otherwise the stock will be at 0!

Hooopppprrrrrraaayyyyyyy! Finally some good news! We have waited sooooooo long! What a beautiful morning! Hope it would lead a trend bring us too 200!
"Honestly, 20% short vs. 80% long, just the shorts' capital are more concentrated in fewer hands than us, so it is easier for them to coordinate the manipulation."
"I love this company and always add when it comes down into the teens like the other day. Solid company with so much upside. Don't just think US, think global market."
"Much as I thought this stock would go up, I have a feeling there's a bottom way below this in the 80 range. I've been wrong once, might be wrong again. I used to be good at knowing where this stock'd go and now I lost it"
"spent time on the west coast. LA area. seems to me impossible is king. Every place I have been that serves plant based has impossible meat, including disneyland. I haven't seen beyond meat on any menu"
Beyond edible
grilling out with Beyond this weekend! Yummy
"MET gala goes 100% plant-based. More and more people and events turn to plant-based diet, the trend will only go stronger and very swiftly."
all markets are down
This has to be the worst stock since the 2020 Boom. It’s done absolutely nothing.
"Something is keeping this stock above 120. I obviously have a stake in it going higher (4000 shares) and multiple put credit spreads, but I'm a realist. I'm worried that its turnaround was on thin volume today.I believe in the concept and the product so much, and an FYI, I'm not a climate hysteric. I hate the abuse animals experience in factory farming, know that meat is an expensive way to feed the world, and it is a bonus that we will cut down on methane. Despite some ignorant detractors who say this product is unhealthy, there is nothing unhealthy about it. The Stanford study (admittedly funded by BYND; but with an agreement that the study be completely hands off from the industry) suggests it might promote healthier living and weight loss"
Could be the WorldCom of the 2020s!
European population 746 million 25% of that population is open to trying vegan meats Beyond is years ahead of anyone else in Europe we are going higher
"@VeganI completely agree with your viewpoint. Shorts have no added positive value other than making a quick buckLongs are also looking for profits, however a great number are there to support a company with a vision, and help it growTherefore, Shorts are useless to anyone except themselves, whereas Longs are useful and beneficial to society at large."
Beyond uh oh
Will go up at least 10% today!!!
"RSI 22, squeeze happening soon!"
Looks like it’s making the same price movement it had from April to May in 2021 not looking good for the bulls this month
"Drifting both up and then down on trivial volume. Might not break 1 million shares today, unless some buying algos come in at the last minute"
"I believe it is a good new, the company is adjusting for the better."
wth is going on with beyond meats lately!!
Loses a ton of money. Other companies coming out with meatless products.Top management is in fiasco.Dunno. 
This stock just goes down
Volume will be huge today
"My daughter just went on holiday to Greece with a group of 20 people. Very fine resort with several restaurants. Of the 20 people, 3 are vegetarians and guess what they were offered for dinner; yes, Beyond. It is becoming a staple offering."

"I'm long (heavily invested) and believe in BYND in the long run. However, two things scare me. I still don't know why the turncoat Sanjay Shah (COO) left abruptly. He didn't even finish out the quarter (Sept 18). The response letter from BYND was beyond bizarre (I posted here). Second, I'm worried about the supply chain. I cannot find Beyond sausage patties, which I love. Any KNOWLEGEABLE ideas would be appreciated. Thanks"
Where's my $140?
Someone had posted earlier than me specificlly was a paid pumper I can assure you I am not a not a paid pumper changed my name to avoid creepy online stalkers but stalkers gonna stalk and they figured out the name change... oh well and I am a long term investor and trader in Beyond
"Hey shorts, please let the vegans live!"
"So over the king weekend, vegans will gang up and buy lots of lots of Beyond Meat as they are SO AFRAID that there will be no more meat products for them from now in! They will fomo into the long weekend. Lol!"
Amazon 2x since Sanjay Shah left. Tesla 15x since Sanjay Shah left.

"Just waiting for some positive news for this bull to charge ahead..patience is key here fellow longs …so far 114$ has been a good support..if this breaks, it will sink to 109$…enough avg volume seen to not go there for now..next stop 120$ with the backing of a positive news.."

Don't touch until the shorts are covering their positions...
Ethan is severely underperforming from a PR standpoint the past year. Wake up and start creating some buzz!
No leadership at this company. With a product that can be easily copied.Run. Imho
"The McPlant is also in all McDonalds in the Netherlands ! Why is this not mentioned??? Apparently Sweden, Austria, england and Ireland and the netherlands have the mcplant."
I see this breaking down badly.

as a long term share holder I am a paid pumper and Europe doesnt have any dogma about vegan meat like the US this will be a very big deal
"Heading to sub $100 , I am afraid!"
"By the way, there is no soy in Beyond burger, they use pea protein and rice protein"
"I see a lot of posts questioning the reason why a vegetarian would want to eat something which tastes like meat. As I replied to Cate (below) there are two things one never forgets- smell and taste. I can think back to my mother’s dishes and still taste them. Today I no longer eat meat, nor do I preach to those who do. I fondly remember family barbecues and the taste of the steaks and burgers. We’ll, Beyond Burgers bring me back the tastes and memories; I love it"
"No volume here, how does this pile of salty mush move at all?"
"We have tried the lastest version of the Beyond burger here in Belgium and it was a large improvement on the previous one. A even more tasty structure, even closer to real meat. And it was produced in the Netherlands. They are going to win big in Europe with this one. Mark my words."
"Beyond Meat became profitable much faster than Netflix and Tesla did when they first began global scale. In fact they reported negative earnings much longer. Let that sink in…McDonald’s, Walmart,Costco , and virtually every grocery/ restaurant. In a time when green is king."

Still in heavy bearish momentum huge news in their favor on the lawsuit and drops a dollar. I remember when the lawsuit first made headlines against beyond meat the stock dropped 4% +

"Of course vegans know who they are, they are heros! Not only they save countless innocent lives being slaughtered, but also contribute the best efforts any human being could contribute to fight global warming, at the same time building up their own health!"
"most of the people stop eating meat are not because they hate the taste of the meat, rather the real costs behind the piece of meat we eat. They do it for health concerns, environmental reasons, ethical choices...However many people find the switching process is challenging from a diet they use to since their childhood to a vegan diet they would like to take. Thanks to companies like beyond meat, they can still enjoy the many dishes they were fond of before."
McDonalds for the Win!
Market digesting what this means probably a bank upgrade soon takes this to the next level
"upgrades always start coming in when it gets this low especially when such great news is out there, that is probably takes us to the next level"
Bynd meat is taking way to long about the deals and products. The rate this company is innovating is so slow … I expected more when I bought into the company
mostly vegan for 3 years I feel so much healthier and I almost never get sick lots of fruits and vegetables and a Beyond burger once or twice a week as a treat not as a perfect health alternative but I like the taste just as much as animal meat
"If you hold BYND stocks, then whenever you go to a restaurant, ask if they have any Beyond products on their menu. More people asking and mentioning it will cause restaurateurs to have some menu items featuring BYND."
Bought the dip
"I'm on this site to learn REAL info. I personally don't like the shorts that simply bash the product as 'garbage'. It's a matter of taste. I don't report these like the spam that too often shows up. So, I like to share real info. The letter from BYND regarding Sanjay Shah's resignation is in the fast-edgar report below. It is WEIRD. It has 3 paragraphs that state, ""although unearned, [he] will receive the 3rd quarter bonus he would have received if he had stayed the third quarter through September 18 (if I recall the exact date)). Something is very fishy about this. I would have kicked his #$%$ to the curb. He quit effectively immediately. What would the problem been with staying another 3 weeks. I hate to say it, but what was BYND 'bribing' him for? Just a speculation, but this is bizarre. If anyone has any info, please post."
Coventry England September 29 and the rest of England next year only reason not nationwide yet is Beyonds ability to scale and meet that demand yet
only thing that will save us is a quarter with profit!
buy the future
"at solid support, only thing going to take it down lower is broader market weakness which is possible but very bullish medium to long term with covered calls"
finall mcplant is coming !!! FINALLY!!!
"Consider a relative new company, Beyond Meat has the partnerships all over the world. The alternative market is still growing in a very fast pace"
Wow hard to believe that this was at $122 10 days ago!
great bounce let's keep it going
111's in 10 minutes
"I have 100% faith in Beyond as a company, not so much the broader market at these levels"
Impossible meat is the best
"If you want to muffle the murmuring of your conscious, that is your choice, after all we have to face the consequences for our actions soon or later. I don’t want to talk about this Karma related topic anymore, because it is meaningless to talk with the people try to cover their ears. Deep in our hearts, we all know well, and Heaven knows us well."
"Early-stage growth companies depend primarily on revenue growth to increase in value over the longer term. BYND is expected to increase its revenues by about $140 million this year (34.4%) and another $290 million next year (52.9%). Most of the high-fliers this year are expected to have a noticeable decline in growth rates next year--BYND's strong increase is exceptional. Longer term, rising costs of beef production and declining cost of BYND's products as it scales up will make its products highly competitive. Concerns with health, the survival of human beings on earth and BYND's ongoing research to improve the flavor and healthiness of its products should make this industry-leader a winner."
7 billion??? this is worth maybe 3 billion. sell ... you can only issue so many PR's.. game will be over....
"BYND Admins. Can you change the algorithms so that ""newest' is an option that sticks please? I'm personally interested in the newest posts. some of the ""top"" posts are uninteresting. Also, I report spam the many times I see it. Can something more be done? Thanks"
Go Beyond go!!!
Monday McDonald’s More value for bynd
The comparison to WorldCom -- with its fraud -- is a huge allegation. Great claims need great proof. Do you have any evidence of fraud?
"Just checked their ingredients, for both burger and sausage, they list no soy, non-GMO, no gluten as well. I guess we should check things well, so we don't turn our concerns to false information, lead people quest our intentions."
I remember when the stock was moving 10& in matter of minutes with fake news regarding the mcdonald's dealNow it is certain that beyond is taking over europe with mcplant and the stock is going down
been watching this stock since the start of the year - can only see it going down and down
no thanks on the antibiotics hormones steroids and poo found in animal meat I'll go with Beyond

Loses money and will continue to lose money. Beyond losing money.Loses employees too.
"We are all paid pumpers, as well as paid dumpers too, so don't just accuse the longs, you shorts are on the same boat regarding to cheer our own side! Lol"
They had some interesting insights about BYND on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"do you guys really eat BYND meat?I saw the burgers in local supermarket,now it is gone,they no longer sell BYND meat.-no burger ,no sausage"
"What do people think about the CEO's compensation of $8,000,000 and the fact the company makes no money and his salary is so high? curious"
$130 next week
Go Beyond!
Great article in The NY Times on Sunday about the CEO and the company. Going higher today!
Once the McDonallds in China and the US start selling the McPlant this stock will really take off. Don't know why the delay. I'm sure they'll be a big seller
"Don't know where this 15 came from, but certainly will inspire me to reach it. Paid pumper is nothing to compare with a person cheer for his/her own heartfelt believe and investment from hard-earned money."

Either this will trickle its way back up to 130 by end of month or pop up to 130 within a week too much good news on beyond meat but not much movement on stock price
I went to Fuddruckers and was surprised to see this on the menu. Who goes to Fudds for a fake burger? They also need to make these things keto. I get fewer carbs in a big burger with a keto bun.
"@A ---- Watch videos like Game Changer, What the Health, Cowspiracy …so many are there for your reference. Besides, Venus Williams (Tennis), Lewis Hamilton (Formula 1), Kyrie Irving (basketball), Scott Jurek (ultramarathon runner), Patrik Baboumian (strongman), Jermain Defoe (soccer) …many many more, they are world class athletes and why they became vegans?"

"at long term support, hope it holds"
Just holding long term eventually I think this goes to $200 like it has done 3 other times eventually I think it will stay high I am using covered calls and short puts at opportune times and not stressing about temporary price action
Keeps tryna break past 110
"BYND has been a range bound stock for a very long time. The safe gravity point is $120.If you do a little tech analysis, considering the news causing the breakdown, one should go long here. I did EOD. Watch the volume at EOD and the little movement. Lots of panicky sellers an lot of buyers. This goes up Tuesday AM. Could be a gap up to 118."
I don't like these movements. Going down the entire day.
This was a mistake. Nothing else to do to hold for longer term. Still believe in their products but may take a while..
"I wrote this email to McDonalds customer service. I have been reading about a new vegetarian burger coming out called the McPlant. First off, Thank you. I can not understand why it took McDonalds so long to have a veggie option on the menu. Im not a vegetarian but I do like veggie options from time to time, and Im A huge fan of Beyond meat products. No offense but I think their burgers are awesome and taste much better than McDonalds meat. My issues are this. I would love the burger served on regular McDonalds buns and called the Beyond Big Mac. I think this would attract a lot more meat eating customers and be great for the image of the company. No offense again but with the Big Mac sauce on there in a regular bun,and I would buy it every time over the regular Big Mac. I also feel its a more powerful name than McPlant. That will instantly turn meat eaters away."
STOP spreading lies. If you are short -- fine. Say any TRUTHFUL thing you want to. BYND does NOT have GMO ingredients or soy. It is NOT banned in the EU or China
"2 years and 2 months tomorrow owning this stock, in the red.."
"not bag holding, investing in the future understanding this comes with more volatility than investing in DIA for example, I am take advantage of the volatility by selling calls against my shares"

Come on Bynd move to 125…..You can do it…….

so much fore this grand Mcplant launch in Uk and Ireland. woopdy do-- stock not even up $1!!!!!
I could never understand how BYND could be selling for over $190 per share when it has never posted a profit. I sold at $136 with a profit of $20/share. It will go lower. I closed the chapter on BYND and plant based food.
Why McDonalds doesn't start selling the McPlant worldwide baffles me. There'll be a market for them everywhere
Shorts are goners! Rip!
"this stock should be at $160 - where did the money go you ask? To the pandemic shortage being practically over. However, with the new rise in cases and beef, chicken, and other shortages (like canned goods), we should see this going up more."
Beyond is taking over Europe give it time to play out
Do you guys know that in 20 years eating meat will be seen as smoking cigarets now? Same mouvement as the electric cars... BYND is in the starting blocks
They are going to take it down below $110 next week..
Argus might as well just wrote a statement saying “we missed the bus”

"Nothing will save this now--- we are in a 10% correction, this to take out 100.. FINALLY.We have been calling this for many months. The selling will pick up as margin calls kick in. Shorts are in control.."
