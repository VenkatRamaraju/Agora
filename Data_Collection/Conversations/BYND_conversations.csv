the downgrade includes a reiterated long term buy
"Honestly, 20% short vs. 80% long, just the shorts' capital are more concentrated in fewer hands than us, so it is easier for them to coordinate the manipulation."
"@bill if the market is drying up, how come their sales so strong even during pandemic, and beat the expectation?"

Do you guys know that in 20 years eating meat will be seen as smoking cigarets now? Same mouvement as the electric cars... BYND is in the starting blocks
"Early-stage growth companies depend primarily on revenue growth to increase in value over the longer term. BYND is expected to increase its revenues by about $140 million this year (34.4%) and another $290 million next year (52.9%). Most of the high-fliers this year are expected to have a noticeable decline in growth rates next year--BYND's strong increase is exceptional. Longer term, rising costs of beef production and declining cost of BYND's products as it scales up will make its products highly competitive. Concerns with health, the survival of human beings on earth and BYND's ongoing research to improve the flavor and healthiness of its products should make this industry-leader a winner."
"Something is keeping this stock above 120. I obviously have a stake in it going higher (4000 shares) and multiple put credit spreads, but I'm a realist. I'm worried that its turnaround was on thin volume today.I believe in the concept and the product so much, and an FYI, I'm not a climate hysteric. I hate the abuse animals experience in factory farming, know that meat is an expensive way to feed the world, and it is a bonus that we will cut down on methane. Despite some ignorant detractors who say this product is unhealthy, there is nothing unhealthy about it. The Stanford study (admittedly funded by BYND; but with an agreement that the study be completely hands off from the industry) suggests it might promote healthier living and weight loss"

Argus might as well just wrote a statement saying “we missed the bus”

Beyond Milk trademark files. just wondering if this is organic line extension or future M&A about to be announced. good stuff either way!
Great article in The NY Times on Sunday about the CEO and the company. Going higher today!
"most of the people stop eating meat are not because they hate the taste of the meat, rather the real costs behind the piece of meat we eat. They do it for health concerns, environmental reasons, ethical choices...However many people find the switching process is challenging from a diet they use to since their childhood to a vegan diet they would like to take. Thanks to companies like beyond meat, they can still enjoy the many dishes they were fond of before."
Where's my $140?
Go Beyond!
No more government subsidies for meat producers = $13 beef big mac vs. $5 BYND big mac. which will you choose?

"I see a lot of posts questioning the reason why a vegetarian would want to eat something which tastes like meat. As I replied to Cate (below) there are two things one never forgets- smell and taste. I can think back to my mother’s dishes and still taste them. Today I no longer eat meat, nor do I preach to those who do. I fondly remember family barbecues and the taste of the steaks and burgers. We’ll, Beyond Burgers bring me back the tastes and memories; I love it"
"Wall street is so nervously waiting for Powell's message tomorrow. Once no tapering, not yet reducing QE, then wall street will just carry on, business as usual for at least for another month, and I believe that Beyond Meat will also go much beyond tomorrow and the near future."

"We have tried the lastest version of the Beyond burger here in Belgium and it was a large improvement on the previous one. A even more tasty structure, even closer to real meat. And it was produced in the Netherlands. They are going to win big in Europe with this one. Mark my words."
