"this should be up (which it is), because I keep dropping over $8/day for their 1lb meat slabs. Where I live the competition with Lightlife and others is gone."
Bynd meat is taking way to long about the deals and products. The rate this company is innovating is so slow … I expected more when I bought into the company

They have been taking out all levels from $160 to $110 during the past 10 weeks...
"If you hold BYND stocks, then whenever you go to a restaurant, ask if they have any Beyond products on their menu. More people asking and mentioning it will cause restaurateurs to have some menu items featuring BYND."
The future is vegan 
"always sell premium, never buy... the casino will ways win be the casino"

"spent time on the west coast. LA area. seems to me impossible is king. Every place I have been that serves plant based has impossible meat, including disneyland. I haven't seen beyond meat on any menu"
it's time for BYND to deliver on earnings front !!!!!!!
"@ concerned citizen Soy product and byproducts are everywhere now, just like corns, inmost of the snacks, packages ready meals, and the meat you love are fed on them, and pass on to you in concreted forms. Do you think they are fed with organic soy and corn?"
"I haven't bought the stock yet, but I'm on this feed, because my stock got lumped iwth a company that worked with this company. I really want to buy this stock, because 1) it's a fully vegan company, 2) I've bought it before and am waiting to jump in again, 3) they're in Carl's Jr, 4) their 1lb meat has a lot less packaging than the others, 5) they're successful.I don't buy the stock because: 1) cocoa butter's expensive and doesn't really add anything (except for meat eaters who think it's most amazing), 2) yogurt not great, 3) chocolate in ice cream (we got to stop making chocolate a thing), 4) the mcdonald's fail, 5) don't have their act together (I mean they have momentum from their success and popularity, but they've been hitting bumps lately).If they get into mcdonald's - I don't care how and turn them vegan (at least one burger). I'll buy 100% again."
"The McPlant is also in all McDonalds in the Netherlands ! Why is this not mentioned??? Apparently Sweden, Austria, england and Ireland and the netherlands have the mcplant."

Precisely the same con game!
Argus might as well just wrote a statement saying “we missed the bus”
"If you want to muffle the murmuring of your conscious, that is your choice, after all we have to face the consequences for our actions soon or later. I don’t want to talk about this Karma related topic anymore, because it is meaningless to talk with the people try to cover their ears. Deep in our hearts, we all know well, and Heaven knows us well."
I see this breaking down badly.

Coventry England September 29 and the rest of England next year only reason not nationwide yet is Beyonds ability to scale and meet that demand yet

This is Dead Meat now going forward.
mostly vegan for 3 years I feel so much healthier and I almost never get sick lots of fruits and vegetables and a Beyond burger once or twice a week as a treat not as a perfect health alternative but I like the taste just as much as animal meat
We are heading to $100 or lower... No buying interests at these levels...
Go Beyond go!!!
"2 years and 2 months tomorrow owning this stock, in the red.."
"Early-stage growth companies depend primarily on revenue growth to increase in value over the longer term. BYND is expected to increase its revenues by about $140 million this year (34.4%) and another $290 million next year (52.9%). Most of the high-fliers this year are expected to have a noticeable decline in growth rates next year--BYND's strong increase is exceptional. Longer term, rising costs of beef production and declining cost of BYND's products as it scales up will make its products highly competitive. Concerns with health, the survival of human beings on earth and BYND's ongoing research to improve the flavor and healthiness of its products should make this industry-leader a winner."
This has to be the worst stock since the 2020 Boom. It’s done absolutely nothing.
Do you guys know that in 20 years eating meat will be seen as smoking cigarets now? Same mouvement as the electric cars... BYND is in the starting blocks

"I'm long (heavily invested) and believe in BYND in the long run. However, two things scare me. I still don't know why the turncoat Sanjay Shah (COO) left abruptly. He didn't even finish out the quarter (Sept 18). The response letter from BYND was beyond bizarre (I posted here). Second, I'm worried about the supply chain. I cannot find Beyond sausage patties, which I love. Any KNOWLEGEABLE ideas would be appreciated. Thanks"
STOP spreading lies. If you are short -- fine. Say any TRUTHFUL thing you want to. BYND does NOT have GMO ingredients or soy. It is NOT banned in the EU or China

They are going to take it down below $110 next week..

"BYND has been a range bound stock for a very long time. The safe gravity point is $120.If you do a little tech analysis, considering the news causing the breakdown, one should go long here. I did EOD. Watch the volume at EOD and the little movement. Lots of panicky sellers an lot of buyers. This goes up Tuesday AM. Could be a gap up to 118."
Wow hard to believe that this was at $122 10 days ago!
Down2$ in after hours
Market digesting what this means probably a bank upgrade soon takes this to the next level
long term investor selling calls against my shares
Still in heavy bearish momentum huge news in their favor on the lawsuit and drops a dollar. I remember when the lawsuit first made headlines against beyond meat the stock dropped 4% +
Shorts are goners! Rip!
Either this will trickle its way back up to 130 by end of month or pop up to 130 within a week too much good news on beyond meat but not much movement on stock price
This company says it won't make money until 2023. That means never.
"in my town Burger King has adopted Impossible Burger and McDonalds has not answered in kind. So I have stopped going to McDonalds.While I lean to the tree hugging side, there are many people like myself who will be avoiding MD until they have Vege Burgers on their menu.And yes i am long on the stock for that reason."
We have Vegans at work. they call out 5 times a month because they have weak immune systems caused by not eating meat

Shaving off 5% almost every week... It was one of the best shorts in June..
"@VeganI completely agree with your viewpoint. Shorts have no added positive value other than making a quick buckLongs are also looking for profits, however a great number are there to support a company with a vision, and help it growTherefore, Shorts are useless to anyone except themselves, whereas Longs are useful and beneficial to society at large."
I made a statement earlier about the Mcplant in Europe that got deleted somehow but it has launched in Austria and is near price parity with its animal counterpart it will expand to other parts in the next few months you can google this information more than 25% of Europeans have considered going on a more vegan diet in the past year I am not sure why this is not bigger news but the Mcplant in Europe alone will increase Beyonds revenue by 30 to 35%
"Wall street is so nervously waiting for Powell's message tomorrow. Once no tapering, not yet reducing QE, then wall street will just carry on, business as usual for at least for another month, and I believe that Beyond Meat will also go much beyond tomorrow and the near future."

No leadership at this company. With a product that can be easily copied.Run. Imho
"I wrote this email to McDonalds customer service. I have been reading about a new vegetarian burger coming out called the McPlant. First off, Thank you. I can not understand why it took McDonalds so long to have a veggie option on the menu. Im not a vegetarian but I do like veggie options from time to time, and Im A huge fan of Beyond meat products. No offense but I think their burgers are awesome and taste much better than McDonalds meat. My issues are this. I would love the burger served on regular McDonalds buns and called the Beyond Big Mac. I think this would attract a lot more meat eating customers and be great for the image of the company. No offense again but with the Big Mac sauce on there in a regular bun,and I would buy it every time over the regular Big Mac. I also feel its a more powerful name than McPlant. That will instantly turn meat eaters away."
"Much as I thought this stock would go up, I have a feeling there's a bottom way below this in the 80 range. I've been wrong once, might be wrong again. I used to be good at knowing where this stock'd go and now I lost it"

"Sometimes I think maybe we should all leave, and let the shorts have fun with themselves. That would be a good scene to watch."
"Small dent today, it will rise. Once veganism grow even stronger trend, shorts will have no much chance, and have to go somewhere else to short"
we are headed much higher

"Don't know where this 15 came from, but certainly will inspire me to reach it. Paid pumper is nothing to compare with a person cheer for his/her own heartfelt believe and investment from hard-earned money."
"at long term support, hope it holds"
"I see a lot of posts questioning the reason why a vegetarian would want to eat something which tastes like meat. As I replied to Cate (below) there are two things one never forgets- smell and taste. I can think back to my mother’s dishes and still taste them. Today I no longer eat meat, nor do I preach to those who do. I fondly remember family barbecues and the taste of the steaks and burgers. We’ll, Beyond Burgers bring me back the tastes and memories; I love it"
"Since mid-March — as restaurants reopened, global demand accelerated and grilling season started — wholesale beef prices have shot up more than 40 percent, with certain steak cuts skyrocketing more than 70 percent, according to the Department of Agriculture.Jun 23, 2021"
"people saying Beyond could go bankrupt are comical, they could instantly be profitable if they stopped spending on R&D, new real estate and employees but I am glad they are going for rapid growth will be much higher soon it never stays below $120 for very long"
"Every day that goes by, the company is getting stronger, reaching more people and building up to profitability"
This was a mistake. Nothing else to do to hold for longer term. Still believe in their products but may take a while..

Go Beyond!
"Drifting both up and then down on trivial volume. Might not break 1 million shares today, unless some buying algos come in at the last minute"
125 Today????????
no thanks on the antibiotics hormones steroids and poo found in animal meat I'll go with Beyond
Why McDonalds doesn't start selling the McPlant worldwide baffles me. There'll be a market for them everywhere
"this stock should be at $160 - where did the money go you ask? To the pandemic shortage being practically over. However, with the new rise in cases and beef, chicken, and other shortages (like canned goods), we should see this going up more."

"buy low sell high, it may go lower but that only makes the risk/reward even better than it already is"
Monday green and new highs with McDonald’s partnership we will see how high we will go
"We have tried the lastest version of the Beyond burger here in Belgium and it was a large improvement on the previous one. A even more tasty structure, even closer to real meat. And it was produced in the Netherlands. They are going to win big in Europe with this one. Mark my words."
24% of shares is shorted !!! massive short squeeze possibility !
China and the European Union have barred the use of BYND's GMO soy. That is also the reason why health conscious people in the US avoid their products. Stick a fork in this one.... it's done.
"not bag holding, investing in the future understanding this comes with more volatility than investing in DIA for example, I am take advantage of the volatility by selling calls against my shares"
"BYND Admins. Can you change the algorithms so that ""newest' is an option that sticks please? I'm personally interested in the newest posts. some of the ""top"" posts are uninteresting. Also, I report spam the many times I see it. Can something more be done? Thanks"

Beyond uh oh
The comparison to WorldCom -- with its fraud -- is a huge allegation. Great claims need great proof. Do you have any evidence of fraud?
Beyond is taking over Europe give it time to play out
Loses a ton of money. Other companies coming out with meatless products.Top management is in fiasco.Dunno. 
They had some interesting insights about BYND on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
A fomo situation.. I really don’t feel bad foe the shorts at all!!!!
Dreaming of a fomo situation to $150
I could never understand how BYND could be selling for over $190 per share when it has never posted a profit. I sold at $136 with a profit of $20/share. It will go lower. I closed the chapter on BYND and plant based food.
"Hi all, as promised yesterday, I checked with friends in Vienna and Beyond is available in McDonalds in Austria as well as UK and Ireland. Let’s keep expanding and win over all doubters"
This fake meat stock is killing me.
"I'm on this site to learn REAL info. I personally don't like the shorts that simply bash the product as 'garbage'. It's a matter of taste. I don't report these like the spam that too often shows up. So, I like to share real info. The letter from BYND regarding Sanjay Shah's resignation is in the fast-edgar report below. It is WEIRD. It has 3 paragraphs that state, ""although unearned, [he] will receive the 3rd quarter bonus he would have received if he had stayed the third quarter through September 18 (if I recall the exact date)). Something is very fishy about this. I would have kicked his #$%$ to the curb. He quit effectively immediately. What would the problem been with staying another 3 weeks. I hate to say it, but what was BYND 'bribing' him for? Just a speculation, but this is bizarre. If anyone has any info, please post."
Because they are sold out
Great deal news for Beyond in UK and Ireland.. they are expanding their businesses worldwide green today!!!!
Beyond edible
"Saving lives are heros, doesn’t matter human lives or animal lives, and doesn’t have to be in the form of force or even violence."
Once the McDonallds in China and the US start selling the McPlant this stock will really take off. Don't know why the delay. I'm sure they'll be a big seller
Could be the lowest volume trading day for the year (<1 Million shares) ...
Shorts are also fuel for the stock when it starts moving higher! but we need a trigger so that they start shipping their pants
Beyond Being Profitable.
i missed pump and dump Monday. Can we have pump and dump Tuesday???
Looks like it’s making the same price movement it had from April to May in 2021 not looking good for the bulls this month
