another red to green day?
still same rangebound $120+ waiting on that breakout
"If you look at the 1 Day, 5 Days, 1 Month , 6 Months , YTD & 1 Year Charts of BYND, they are all RED! Only Option Sellers can make $$ from BYND 'investment'... Hard lessons.."
"Net revenues were $149.4 million, an increase of 31.8% year-over-year.Gross profit was $47.4 million, or gross margin of 31.7% of net revenues.Net loss was $19.7 million or $0.31 per common share. Net loss as a percentage of net revenues was -13.2%.Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $2.2 million, or -1.5% of net revenues."
money seems to be flowing in the upswing direction for now. I expect this to turn back up.
good luck to my long friends tonight. we shall see how the operations are and if all of these press releases translated into revenues.
I remember when everyone raved about auger free soda until they discovered it’s worse then regular sugar drinks
Do you guys know that in 20 years eating meat will be seen as smoking cigarets now? Same mouvement as the electric cars... BYND is in the starting blocks
Big news on the way for BYND.Going back $200
"2Q Revenues beat while margins missedBeyond Meat (BYND) reported 2Q21 results yesterday after market close. Overall 2Q21earnings came in below expectations driven by higher restructuring expenses andunfavorable below the line items. 2Q sales came in above estimates driven byfoodservice which benefitted from reopening and customer building inventories, timingbenefit of July 4th buy-in pulling from 3Q into 2Q helped retail. These were partiallyoffset by underlying weakness in US retail against difficult comparison. Gross marginssaw pressure related to transportation costs, higher D&A and higher fixed overheadcosts (from LT investments in capacity) partially offset by lower direct materials costper unit. In addition operating expenses were elevated driven by planned investmentrelated to the “cost down” programs and commercialization activity behind R&D,innovation, international growth and capacity."
Headed to $150 within a week
"okay, revenue beat, but at what price?based on heavy discounts to retail and b2b, draining the margin down? what will be with sales, when discounts disappear?) 5 consecutive quarters of missing EPS estimates BTW :)"

Tax my competition! That's the only way i'll survive.
To the Moon
been watching this stock since the start of the year - can only see it going down and down
"I love this company and always add when it comes down into the teens like the other day. Solid company with so much upside. Don't just think US, think global market."
will we see 150 this week ? or even higher ?
Please go ahead and short the bottom ! Actually the earning release is pretty good! revenue is 150 million dollars in one quarter! doubling in revenue in international market! this company is going for the one billion dollar revenue in couple of years
They are Rigging the shereprice to drop before $120...

Do you really think anyone who goes to McD's cares about healthy food?
"I see a lot of posts questioning the reason why a vegetarian would want to eat something which tastes like meat. As I replied to Cate (below) there are two things one never forgets- smell and taste. I can think back to my mother’s dishes and still taste them. Today I no longer eat meat, nor do I preach to those who do. I fondly remember family barbecues and the taste of the steaks and burgers. We’ll, Beyond Burgers bring me back the tastes and memories; I love it"
I will not eat anything end with version number
One does not need to be a “paid pumper”. One needs to have an investment and/or believe in this company There are more than enough “paid deflates” out there trying to do the reverse
It will break $100 in next couple of weeks.
Green is our favorite colour. Let's recover what we've lost!
"Trivial volume. K, is this what you meant by dribbling small orders to manipulate markets? Surely there must be some bullish algos that kick in as the price continues to decline"
Heavily processed food make people insulin resistant and lead to all sorts of metabolically diseases.
Nobody thinks the earnings will be good this 2nd quarter. Got to hope the growth of the company beats expectations by a wide margin or the price of the stock will plunge
seems like good support at near $116 as long as broader market doesn't crash we should be good to move higher
Buying some $120 Put options for next week would be a good hedge...
When is going to be BYND Q3? What day? Anyone can tell me?
I knew I should have sold some calls

"Out AlF @ $10, made 40%+/-. ACRX notice, up 9%, looks like ACEX got way over sold, eyeing ACRX.. $PTON $BYND adding"
Let's go above 125 today!
"When BYND was at 154, I thought it was a bargain - can't believe the slide, but then I looked at their financials and realize that they shouldn't be anything over $30 - so $90 above that's wow! They really need more money maker streams to keep and surpass this price point if not people pumping it due to momentum - but what will give it momentum these days if this stock keeps resting on its laurels?"
"up to 38 billion a year in subsidies for the meat and dairy industries, the opposite of free market"
Might be time to go big on beyond soon. Bill gates invested in this. I've made money twice buy low and selling high. But I think the lows are going away permanently this could be the last time it's below 140.

"till, booming demand for meat, especially beef, from restaurants reopening in the U.S. more than offset Tyson’s chicken woes, helping the company to beat third-quarter estimates for both sales and profits.

"in 2017, revenue was 30 million dollars. In less than 5 years, revenue is quickly approaching 500 million dollars, and the vegan revolution has not even started yet. unbelievable!! with each passing year, investments made will start paying off, cost will go down, net earnings will go up. A formula that has been followed by all succesful companies. Tesla comes to mind?"
Someone had posted earlier than me specificlly was a paid pumper I can assure you I am not a not a paid pumper changed my name to avoid creepy online stalkers but stalkers gonna stalk and they figured out the name change... oh well and I am a long term investor and trader in Beyond
They had some interesting insights about BYND on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.

"Fake meat is now and always has been a niche product. Sure, some people will eat it but the market will never be large enough to support the literally hundreds of different fake meat products that are being rolled out."

"I dont want to say I told you so but.... this was easy. You can love the product, love the idea, be a veggioe, whatever floats your boat. BUT--- Finance and stock another story. This company is a poor investment. Its a hedge fund tool to chew on and trade thats it. 130-140M Q revenues will not support an 8 billion market cap. sorry longs and pumpers. you need big revenue growth. Obviously, all these partnerships are not generating revenues. trading at 20X sales, sorry too rich... Good luck at these prices. We said 100 two months ago and we getting close"
Come on Bynd move to 125…..You can do it…….
"pump and dump press release MOnday is a day late. here is your Monday PR. big deal--- for a limited time in limited restaruants.

Beginning today, the Beyond Pepperoni Pizza will be available as a test in nearly 70 locations across five U.S. markets for a limited time, only at Pizza Hut."
Baseless downgrade!
"They are rigging the markets both ways using phantom digital shares. This has become ablatantly manipulated casino, where the privileged banksters control everything."
Just holding long term eventually I think this goes to $200 like it has done 3 other times eventually I think it will stay high I am using covered calls and short puts at opportune times and not stressing about temporary price action
"looking good, let's keep it going"
Beyond Meat reinvest heavily because they saw the potential also they have the confidence for their own future. We all know that we don't wait when customer come to our restaurant and order a tomato soup then run to the market to buy tomatoes.
"Beware of those ""Fake"" Downgrades."
I'm not surprised the shine is off this company. Also too much competition in a very limited market.
"most growth stocks with negative EPS are suffering right now but this happens in cycles they always bounce back especially the stronger ones like Beyond with 30%+ annual growth $120 has been long term support whenever it dips below it bounces back hard I see no reason it would be different now buy low, sell high"
wth is going on with beyond meats lately!!
"New trading algo drops the shareprice 5 or more days in a row, then pump up 5% or more one day. They kill most call options this way. Even when there is a short spike after many down days in a row, option buyers will lose their $$ most of the time..."
anyone know the 'whisper earnings' on BYND? I'm personally not expecting much base on Ethan's comments on the last call and the huge amount of money they have spent and continuing to spend on R&D. Great for the company; not so great for the short-term
I expect a great announcement this week....225 possible
Huge miss…yikes
Shorts: be careful...
Just bought 300 shares
Why can’t we stay over 120…….
"Think they're going to beat the growth number. Like how it finished today. There was over 100,000 shares traded the last 3 minutes of the day. Hope that's a sign the overall report will be good. Think the growth number will be significant"
why would you want to eat fake meat when you can have real meat?

REAL MEAT IS MUCH BETTER FOR OUR HEALTH THEN PROCESSED LAB CRUD.show me the science.
"last 3 times they missed earnings, why should it be different this time. Think about, since last q input prices are still at record hights, same for shipping. I don't see any reason why they should perform better than expected when it comes to profit. Yes, revenue will probably be up by a lot but I think eps will be more important for investors."
Do people actually want to eat fake meat?
"avoid the antibiotics steroids hormones and poo you are getting in your diet some people say Beyond is over processed but that process is high pressure water and ingredients you likely have eaten in the last month even if you are not a vegan and the taste is consistantly improving the newest version 3.0 tastes and has the texture of animal beef they could be profitable right now but they spend a lot of money on R&D to improve the taste and health of the product which along with new real estate I actually prefer it that way for the future growth of the company once they are able to scale they will be able to undercut the price of meats they are very close to doing that right now with beef, Beyond sales will really start to soar more than the average 138% average that have over the past 2 years once the scale occurs, some people may never change their mind on this product and that is ok but a very large % of the worlds population has an open mind about this kind of product this stock is going to go so much higher and yes I am a paid pumper as I own covered calls in the company"

They do it for health concerns, environmental reasons, ethical choices...However many people find the switching process is challenging from a diet they use to since their childhood to a vegan diet they would like to take. Thanks to companies like beyond meat, they can still enjoy the many dishes they were fond of before."

Tired of shorts and pandemia
"Honestly, 20% short vs. 80% long, just the shorts' capital are more concentrated in fewer hands than us, so it is easier for them to coordinate the manipulation."

"We have tried the lastest version of the Beyond burger here in Belgium and it was a large improvement on the previous one. A even more tasty structure, even closer to real meat. And it was produced in the Netherlands. They are going to win big in Europe with this one. Mark my words."
Down nearly 5% in after hours. What's all that about??
"@Alireza (and others). Why are we (shorts) angry?Well, I'm angry because, through all of these systematic ""partnership"" announcements, Ethan has duped MANY people into believing that this pump-and-lose stock/company (not sure it's a pump-n-dump, per se, but may be so for HIM), in particular, is the future of food, and achieved ridiculous valuations and lined his pockets as a result.Where lie the details of these deals? Do all the deals come at the expense of BYND shareholders? I believe they do. I believe they are all set such that BYND assumes essentially all the risk by offering BYND products to partners at little-risk prices, allowing BYND to pump up its stock and make timed announcement after timed announcement. I remain convinced that BYND will not have a significant future market share of ""meat"" sales. I believe that highly processed artificial foods are nasty and will never be a satisfactory substitute for real food, meat included. Remember when they told mothers that formula was better than breast milk? I am steadfast that, as the partnerships eventually dry up (as they have been doing, due to lack of genuine, long-term consumer interest) many real-folk, long-term investors, like Cate, will be left holding a very heavy bag. I believe that shareholders will all, ultimately, be diluted into oblivion (like AMCers, etc.) and that this company has a real chance of long-term bankruptcy due to it spending too much, too fast. It is pretending that the willingness of people to try (leading to high INITIAL sales, followed by plummeting repeat sales) these ""novel"" products (which are little more than fancy processing recipes that can and will be copied by others, should anyone genuinely enjoy them) implies they will have long term buyers, where this is simply untrue. US relative sales are beginning to plummet, yet much money is spent on expansion into new markets. This sort of pump-n-lose behavior, being perpetrated by MANY companies these days--but perhaps by no company more effectively than BYND--is wrong. It's a bit like Herbalife, which is a genuinely evil company, but the BYND angle is under the guise of trying to do the right thing. Shorting is the way of righting that wrong, and putting my money where my mouth is.And that says nothing of the clear price swing manipulation and band-wagoning that is occurring."
Load up the truck if the price breaks below $120 again..
Shorts are sleepless!!Next stop for bynd is $160. By next Friday.

BYND buying back shares????
I don't own shares here but as long as I've followed this company every single earnings report is a 50/50 shot of missi g bad and getting crushed or really good and soaring. There is nothing in between and it seems more often than not its crushed. Why keep playing here when there are better buys like BABYF that is heading to where this is.
This stock just goes down
"Something is keeping this stock above 120. I obviously have a stake in it going higher (4000 shares) and multiple put credit spreads, but I'm a realist. I'm worried that its turnaround was on thin volume today.I believe in the concept and the product so much, and an FYI, I'm not a climate hysteric. I hate the abuse animals experience in factory farming, know that meat is an expensive way to feed the world, and it is a bonus that we will cut down on methane. Despite some ignorant detractors who say this product is unhealthy, there is nothing unhealthy about it. The Stanford study (admittedly funded by BYND; but with an agreement that the study be completely hands off from the industry) suggests it might promote healthier living and weight loss"
"I am afraid , the management is out of any more rosy PR news, the stock can perform based on its fundamentals (earnings)... Down & Stagnant for weeks & months..."
No more government subsidies for meat producers = $13 beef big mac vs. $5 BYND big mac. which will you choose?

Why does $bynd drops when markets go up!
this time we will take support out and head for 100.
I went to Fuddruckers and was surprised to see this on the menu. Who goes to Fudds for a fake burger? They also need to make these things keto. I get fewer carbs in a big burger with a keto bun.
Go Beyond!
~3% retracement was unexpected.... Are we going back to low $120s again?
Was there any news to make Beyond to climb like it did??
Long here never sell
"No need to read between the lines. The CEO has already told us what he sees for the future of Beyond Meat.""As we scale, we'll begin to be able to underprice animal protein - if you look at our facilities, and you look at the facilities of say, some of our plant or animal-based competitors, right, we're still a very small company [but] that's going to change.”"
Likelihood of under $100 within next quarter?
"Early-stage growth companies depend primarily on revenue growth to increase in value over the longer term. BYND is expected to increase its revenues by about $140 million this year (34.4%) and another $290 million next year (52.9%). Most of the high-fliers this year are expected to have a noticeable decline in growth rates next year--BYND's strong increase is exceptional. Longer term, rising costs of beef production and declining cost of BYND's products as it scales up will make its products highly competitive. Concerns with health, the survival of human beings on earth and BYND's ongoing research to improve the flavor and healthiness of its products should make this industry-leader a winner."
"Aug 5 (Reuters) - Beyond Meat Inc forecast third-quarter revenue below estimates on Thursday, citing uncertainty related to the impact of rising COVID-19 infection rates on the fast-food restaurant sector.The company said it expects third-quarter net revenue of $120 million to $140 million, compared with analysts' estimates of $153.3 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."
Plant base milk next
Beyond Milk trademark files. just wondering if this is organic line extension or future M&A about to be announced. good stuff either way!
the two things I am focused on are 1. What is the revenue growth and 2. What is guidance on future revenue specificly curious about Beyond Chicken which could replace Beyond Beef as the cash cow of the company no pun intended

"Beyond Meat had recently also announced the launch of its new plant-based chicken tenders at numerous restaurants across the United States. The anticipated disruption to supply chains could affect the distribution of this new product, while movement controls could crimp demand for consumer spending and cause people to spend less on higher-priced food items such as plant-based meat. Furthermore, should another extended closure loom for restaurant and fast-food chains, it will adversely affect the company's lucrative foodservice division."
