"i would be happier if this co. would just go belly up, just so the people running this co. could see how poorly they were running this co.."
What’s up with the big drop? No new news is there?
Tempted at this price
Bought another 1000 shs today.....no brainer.
Criminals
OZM reached a new All Time Low at $1.17
"It would seem that this market cap is twice as much as it really is due to the class B shares, which have no economic interest and are instead used for voting."
good to see AUM increased by 400m to 32b now..nice positive tractions..
We are starting to break out here .. more likely more investors betting on good report..
What's happening here? No news on results?
I’ll have to set the day aside to ponder where to spend my 2 cent dividend! So many things you can buy with $32 bucks.
Breakout CONFIRM...!!! BOOOOOOM!!!!!!!!
OZM is up 5.88% to $1.26
SCU reached an all time high at 23.66
Citadel should buy them out and double their assets managed
In a holding pattern until year end results announced. I expect them to meet or exceed expectations. A very good bargain at today’s price.
Anybody know what’s driving this? I haven’t seen much news. They closed some additional aircraft financing business is about all.
Going buy it Monday 400 shares
Ozm broke the 50days moving average .. needed to break 2.35 before this will have a meaningful run..
Depressing
November return for OZ Master was +0.14%. On a relative basis it was not too bad. Many hedge funds are down -3% to -7% in November. AUM is level at $32.3bn as of Dec 1.
"the officers of this co. are really smart ,all the money goes to them. andy"
Bottom is here .. Loading up here .. glta
OMG! Are you taking advantage of these free trade alerts? If not there literally has to be something wrong with you. Go to the-stockdork now to sign up. .
"What is the share price commensurate with that dividend? Presently, a 10% dividend. Seems that a share price of 46 with a 5% dividend would be a fair value. Thoughts?"
Sculptor Capital is up 7.29% to 15.45
Looks like it could possibly be coming out of the woods with a close over 2.45 wishing I pulled the trigger at 215/16.
Sculptor Capital is up 7.79% to 15.09
Sculptor Capital is up 7.77% to 12.07
I could see this breaking the 52 weeks high soon ..hoping 30 bucks ..Citi upgrade to 48 bucks ..
yes
"It looks like James Levin, the second largest insider holder of OZM blew out his entire position over the past couple of weeks, killing the stock. Fortunately, he has only about 300,000 shares left. No other insiders have been selling. Good riddance, get rid of him, and then put the firm back on track."
Why didn't OZM hold the +50% rally?
Capital mismanagement. Probably a ponzi.
"NOT IN SUCH A DISTANT PAST IT WAS ""LARGE CAP STOCK"" WITH MARKET CAP OVER 6 BILLION DOLLARS.LET'S HOPE THAT AFTER REORGANIZATION IT WILL HEAD TO BEING A LARGE CAP STOCK!I JUST BOUGHT IN..."
SCU reached a 52 Week high at 25.75
"Will see what happens here in the next few days. Abrams Capital bought millions in stock in last 60 days. Did they know? If not, this would not be good news for Abrams who now owns 10% of the float that was diluted by 7%."
BLUEKIES !!! Finally....This should head to 30 bucks now..Goodluck Longs..
"This should be very good for long term it appears. We will see. In the meantime, risk should be reduced with dividend collections."
Small limit order at 2.39. If it hits I'm in
OZM is down -5.41% to 2.10
"Low float only 17 millions, these could go for a good run here !!"
It will be on a strong upward trend if report for June shows stable AUM and continued strong performance. OZM on average has been a money making machine for many years. I expect over the next 2 years they will provide a nice return.
Sculptor Capital is up 7.97% to 17.75
Little bounce off that 215 again
No news and down? OZM makes tremendous money. I say they will beat estimates for the year and declare a .07-.10 cent per share dividend.
Time for Jimmy to earn his keep. Let’s see some earnings!
"I am a long time holder of Alternative Asset Managers (FIG, BX, SCU) and hold 26,000 shares of SCU. Although I am biased, I really believe SCU is a solid long term turnaround play. As AUM start to climb as I expect they will begin in 2021 I expect the street to take notice. It was almost $30 a year ago and they are in much better shape today so I think $30-$35 by end of 2021 is very plausible."
Short sellers suck!
"the officers of this co. are doing great ,why am i not happy."
OZM reached a new All Time Low at 1.89
OZM is down 5.56% to $1.53
Up nice today only need another $25 per share to get back to even

Sculptor Capital is up 8.46% to 21.41
I think run up is due to good November report on performance and increase of 600 million in AUM.
According to their 8k they did a fantastic job for their investors. Overall they went down much less than the market.
OZM is down -6.64% to 2.53
Sculptor Capital is up 12.31% to 20.16
What's up with the insider transactions? Did a lockout period expire?

"The 3Q conference call was not so bad, though the shares went down again afterwards The company seems to be in the very early innings of a possible rebound. With all the lawsuits settled, they have been approved by a private bank for its investors, working on more, and consultants are telling institutions that it is investable again. I think if performance this year in the OZ Master Fund was better (say at least mid-single digits) they would be getting good new flows. Maybe at the start of 2019, if institutions start moving money away from equities. The performance of the credit and real estate funds has been fabulous, 12.7% and 22% annualized returns. Those businesses definitely have potential to grow."

"When the Ozm announce the performance was the best from January to June 2017 since 2009, it should GAP Up when we report...Och-Ziff Capital Management Group said its largest fund had its best performance in the January to June period since 2009,"
Breaking out now!! Head to 30 bucks !!
Hopefully SCU is doing a good job of insulating their clients investments from this downturn. This downturn could bring in massive inflows if they hedged this correctly.
Just read a post on SA that said Citi has a $48.50 price target.
What’s going to happen when OZM declares a $.20 per share dividend and all their ugly numbers cycle out?
The earnings coukd support a 50 bucks valuations here !! Still undervalued at this level !!
It’s going to be very difficult for these guys to show a good result when they overpay themselves. $20 mil per quarter accrual for bonuses alone. They need to dump some upper level dead weight!
no jlll
How is Yahoo calculating 1.39bn enterprise value? I calc'd 700mm. What am I missing here?MV: 930mmCash + US Tnotes: (430mm)Term Loan: 200mmEV: 700mm
Booooom!!! BREAKOUT!!!!
Sculptor Capital is up 8.20% to 15.71
So what is everybody’s guess on this upcoming quarterly?
This looks pretty solid to me. Should receive dividend today and then just wait for the next one. They did a nice job raising dividend this quarter and expect it to be the same next quarter which makes for a nice return.
OZM reached a new All Time Low at 1.51
SCU reached a 52 Week high at 28.38
No volume today for some reason. Is there any new news?
"So far other hedge funds which have reported reported profits or sideways results . So in these times , I think SCU won’t be too bad , might have upside or maintain"
OZM is up 4.90% to $1.07
Bx apo CG all up !! Scu part of the sector have not participated yet .. lots of Runway for take off here!!
Och should sell the company while there is still a company to Blackrock.
"According to the WSJ, OZ Master is on the JP Morgan hedge fund platform. That could drive good inflows into the hedge funds. JP Morgan is a major player in hedge fund distribution."
OZM is up 6.32% to 2.86
OZM reached a new All Time Low at $1.10
"Not sure why yahoo does not catch all of their press releases. Their next earnings conference call is May 6, 2021:https://shareholders.sculptor.com/websites/sculptor/English/0/home.html"
Ex dividend tomorrow. Good sized divvy. Hang on...watch it grow a little and collect another dividend in 3 months.
Ozm Zacks currently giving a strong buy!!!!
OZM is down 5.79% to $1.14
This is a BUY. Company is worth at least $32/share. Dividend is nice too but upside is above and beyond that
OZM is down 4.95% to $1.41
"seems that OZM goes down in ""down market"", but then in up market it goes down again."
OZM reached a new All Time Low at $1.14
"Och-Ziff Assets Under Management decreases by $0.2bn to $32.8 billion. OZ Master Return was +0.12% in September. Not lovely, but not so bad, either"

Looks like SCU finally breaking Out!!!! Boooom!!!
OZM reached a new All Time Low at 1.91
"AUM up 1,4 billion and amazing January performance. OZM may turn the corner"
OZM is down 5.83% to $0.97
OZM reached a new All Time Low at $1.07
I say it's worth $5/share within 12 months. Management has kept comp expenses in check and AuM is starting to turn the corner. The main fund has had 3 down months in the last 24. I'm concerned that effective management fee rate continues to fall but my guess is that we're at (or very near the bottom).
Reasonably priced for a 10+% dividend as well as growth which makes for a very nice return. I could see this at $28 before next dividend.
Love this POS company. Reliably red even when all else is green.
SCU is up 7.00% to 25.99
Citigroup Price target at 45 bucks lots of runway left here..Im loading up every pullback..
Wow broke thru the 200 dma n closed above it
OZM is up 7.39% to 2.47
just bought in. The dividend will make it easy to hold til capital gains kick in.
Ozm looks poised to exceed earning estimates with their performance to date. Wish I could get some money in their credit strategies funds.
Lawsuits Dismissed..BOOOOM!!! one of the dark cloud lifted...TIME TO GAP UP!!!!
OZM is down -6.55% to 2.57
What is SCU pulling back so much these last few trading days?
Do you think this thing is done selling? Showing us a buy signal now on OZM? I started receiving notifications from https://newawesomestocks.blogspot.com/ the other week and so far they have presented interesting new trade ideas.
Criminal what has happened here
Sculptor Capital is up 8.60% to 16.29
Sculptor Capital is up 7.29% to 11.78
Anyone non Jewish and without a criminal record work for this company?
Going back below 1$
It’s up almost 7%!!! Look out $5 here we come!!
"OZM share price has dropped a lot more than the AUM decline since 2015 (33% drop in AUM vs -90% in share price). What really doesn't seem to make sense is that AUM didn't really change from 3Q17 to 3Q18, staying at about $32bn with slightly less profitable mix, but the shares are down -67% in this time. The company is not headed for a default as the closest debt maturity is in 2023. So what has put the shares down this much? I can only think maybe the fixed expenses vs. AUM, or the spat that Dan Och had with Jimmy Levin had over succession in at the beginning of 2018. The share price reaction looks totally out of line with the actual decline in the business. I wish management/Dan Och would get out there and try to address what is going on."
Sculptor Capital is up 7.98% to 22.45
Officers must be exercising options and dumping? Higher volume to the down side with no news.
Got back out but will be interesting to see if it holds over 288 level
"Ahh, today is ex-dividend date. Many who bought to get the big divi are moving on. Sigh ..."
"So, the shares are down from 1.60 to 1.10 just a month ago on what did not seem to be very much new news, from an already low level. Any theories on why? There is no short interest to speak of."
This is too cheap presently compared to its peers.. This will eventually gap up as market realized the bargain play..
Looks like the employee stock bonuses hit today. I would think some of them would hold them for a while. No optimism about their own work? None of them are underpaid!
Hope the pre-market price right now is a glitch of some sort.
BLUE SKY NoW !!! Dividend of 54 cents go get yours !! Booom !!!
Two cent distribution. I can buy two bags of Starbucks beans. Thanks so much OZM.
Anyone have any idea why Weighted-average Class A Shares outstanding - diluted and Weighted-average Class A Shares outstanding - basic are so far apart?
Good earn report. Looks like the outflow is starting to stop. Assets grew into the beginning of this yr. earns are positive. Declared a .07 dividend.
OZM is up 6.12% to 2.60
Crashed below the 200dma at 2.77. Very oversold at rsi of 22. What's happening over here? Tax loss selling?
"If OZM reports any inflow into OZ Master, which is a pretty good possibility given the great YTD performance, this will fly"
this should be 26 within a couple of weeks when it is only a month left til next ex div day.
OZM reached a new All Time Low at $1.30
SCU reached a 52 Week low at 18.62
AUM stable @ $32.3 billion as of Dec 1. I think this is good news. It means redemptions for the November deadline were minimal. Anyone have more insite into this?
OZM reached a new All Time Low at 1.86
OZM reached an all time low at $0.93
Is OZM trading as an LLC yet? Or is it still an MLP?
32.5 billions in assets being managed .. eventually the sheep would be awoken !!

"Float only 24 millions and outstanding at 58 millions.. if it’s time to go this low float will propel this stock much higher .. Fundamentally strong with recent report, with dividend at 12% this is one of best dividend play out there !!!"
Sculptor Capital is down 6.03% to 24.14
I haven’t seen the September 8k I wonder if someone got a insider heads up on AUM or performance driving this sell off ???
OZM is down 5.04% to $1.32
A complete turn around heading to its strongest quarter this should run loooking for 4-5 bucks before end of the year..
Almost grade card time for OZM. I hope they are going to have a strong report. I also hope they aren’t up to their ears in tech stocks that are seriously tanking.
Back up the truck here !! Just a matter of time getting paid while waiting!!
Long
The people running this co. are dishonest at best.
You’re gonna wish you bought this one
SCU is up 11.20% to 12.01
breaking out above 50 days moving average..looks good here..
"Nice run up today !!! what would have been the reason, anybody ??"
"According to their website, they report on Aug 5th, 2021 before market opens."
No news big drop?
"I might need to throw in the towel here. When you're wrong, you're wrong. There's no way OZM can survive. Salaries + bonuses are too high and their not spending nearly enough on biz development. Business development expenses:1H 2018 $2,253,0002017 $6,685,0002016 $13,440,0002015 $15,707,0002014 $11,982,0002013 $11,223,0002012 $9,325,0002011 $7,879,0002010 $7,685,0002009 $7,606,0002008 $11,648,0002007 $9,355,000"
So some righteously indignant judge goes on a power rant and OZM drops like a rock. Does anybody think that business in African countries doesn’t require unsavory business practices? How pristine and perfect are the complainants in this case? I bet you can’t buy or sell a pack of chewing gum in Africa without bribing somebody.
SCU reached an all time high at 24.50

this one got clobbered today. Probably a good time to buy.
"Most of the volume is little day traders trying to score $20. If you have a couple thousand shares that are deep in the red (like mine), I would hang in there. What do you have to lose?"

OZM is up 6.03% to 2.11
Looks like that reverse split can’t happen soon enough. I hope all those overpaid stock jockeys are doing a good job for their clients and protecting them from this down market. If they can maintain client capital in this yo-yo market they should pick up billions in AUM.
They have 350 million of accrued but unrecognized earnings growing in their credit funds. The return on that alone would pay their 2 cent dividend. They accrue 20 mil in bonus per quarter and that isn’t enough?

OZM is up 5.67% to $1.49
$2.50 is almost here. Good volume this morning. Someone is selling out. Is this Abrams Capital? Either way this is either a smoking buy or it's in real bad shape. Market is pricing the worst....so down it goes sitting at a 52 week low / all time low.
"After 3 1/2 years of being absolutely flogged by OZM, all of a sudden it's a Superstar. Ironic."
OZM shares are completely disaster. It seems like someone has been dumping regardless of price for the past 7 weeks. Are OZ employees awarded shares at current share price and dumping? Who is selling at these levels?
OZM is down -5.45% to 1.48
SCU reached an all time high at 24.09
"It's pretty clear that this company plans on delisting IMO. The value, if you can call it that, is in the funds directly, not this stock. The employees are clearly treating their options as if worthless. I'm long and this is extremely disappointing. Does anyone disagree with this outcome?"
They outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 3%. I think that’s pretty good.
Ozm breaking OUT!!!!
Down grade on their debt. This will reach the 1's this week. This is not going anywhere soon...still no bottom. The SP will have to level out for a least 2 weeks before the bottom can be used. Anyone at OZM buying?
Buy .30 divined
Good report !! Citi 48 bucks PT shoukd come into fruition!!
SCU reached a 52 Week low at 13.49

Broke the TA resistance at 27.90 this should go now ..!!
Found this stock with the stock screener. Looks promising. Pandemics can create disaster and opportunities at the same time.
This shoukd be a least 30 bucks based on earnings.. Bx Apo hedge funds on the go .. hopefully this sectoral moves spread to scu as well !!
"This isn't a stock for short term investors. They need at least a 2 years to even begin to overcome the damage done FCPA settlement and poor return performance. I don't see any of the big money cutting and running and they have in fact been dumping in more. I wouldn't bet the farm on OZM , but if you have some money that you can live without for 5 years or allocate some DRIP to it, you could come out a big winner."

"The following 3 things need to happen immediately -1. Och needs to step down as Chairman - not wait until Q1 20192.
