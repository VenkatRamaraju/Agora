What's the scoop with the dividend pay dates and amounts? Looks like they're random? Thanks in advance for any info.
this one got clobbered today. Probably a good time to buy.
"I didn't sell. It looks like the institution has finished dumping their position or they're simply waiting for the price to move back up before they're back at it again. If you look at a three-month graph you'll see that there is a ceiling at the $28.5 price level we may have something to cheer about if the price should manage to exceed that. It'll all depend on what this quarter's dividend is and what the Assets Under Management (AMU) number comes out as. On the upside, many of the similar funds have reported earnings that exceeded expectations. Most analysts feel that SCU is a great fund.On the downside based on the historical PE ratio, SCU is simply a $26 dollar security.I'm concerned that an institution would dump its position just before earnings. Do they know something?My advice is to tighten your stop orders the morning of the 3rd and cross your fingers.If it goes to hell you can come back in and buy this back at a lower price after the crash.If it goes up then adjust your stops and pat yourself on the back. Best of luck to all of us."
Ex dividend tomorrow. Good sized divvy. Hang on...watch it grow a little and collect another dividend in 3 months.
"Three hours to go, the stock is down over 4% already have 3 times normal volume, There is an institution taking a profit. Compared to QQQ SCU does not deserve to be beaten down like this.Buying opportunity at 24.60?"
"i would be happier if this co. would just go belly up, just so the people running this co. could see how poorly they were running this co.."
just bought in. The dividend will make it easy to hold til capital gains kick in.
"BX , APO CG all are running with good report ..SCU with sectoral bull, this should go and run as well!!"
"Float only 24 millions and outstanding at 58 millions.. if it’s time to go this low float will propel this stock much higher .. Fundamentally strong with recent report, with dividend at 12% this is one of best dividend play out there !!!"
"Latest AUM have increase seems starts to attract more investors here..Levin is doing a magnificent Job here!!Oct 4 (Reuters) - Sculptor Capital Management Inc:* SCULPTOR CAPITAL MANAGEMENT INC - AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2021, ESTIMATED UNAUDITED AMOUNT OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT WAS ABOUT $36.9 BILLION"
24.88 I'm buying
Falling on heavy volume while the Market is up 1%. Based on its PE this is a $26 stock. This company is now nearing my stop loss.Without any news other than heavy selling as an earning report is about to happen I'm concerned.The number to watch for is the AMU. If this number is below the previous quarter then SCU will probably go down some more.
Heavy volume this AM and SCU is essentially flat. I would expect that after the large decline that buyers would be rushing in but they are not. The quarterly earnings report will be out the first week of November. Does someone know something that the rest of us do not?
Buy .30 divined
The hedge funds started to gap up here !! Scu with great dividends should follow Bx apo and cg .. getting paid while waiting ..
This is a BUY. Company is worth at least $32/share. Dividend is nice too but upside is above and beyond that
Breaking out now!! Head to 30 bucks !!
Good report !! Citi 48 bucks PT shoukd come into fruition!!
"This should be very good for long term it appears. We will see. In the meantime, risk should be reduced with dividend collections."
this should be 26 within a couple of weeks when it is only a month left til next ex div day.
It appears that a major player of SCU is unwinding their position. You can see that starting Aug 19th there have been several days of heavy selling. It appears that there is support at the 25.5 price level. SCU has not been able to break into any new highs. The 12 monthly avg dividend is an abberation. You can see that the 1q21 was a one-time event. The principal is pulling 33 million dollars out of this company and has brought in his son at 3.5 million a year as well. This is typical. The good news is that once the profit taking by the institution is complete we have a good shot of this turning up again. My 2 cents.
Anyone have any idea why Weighted-average Class A Shares outstanding - diluted and Weighted-average Class A Shares outstanding - basic are so far apart?
jeffery' stocks don't just go straight up. Be patient. Enjoy the dividend. Buy more here if you can.
Broke the TA resistance at 27.90 this should go now ..!!
Unfortunate to see Rob Shafir is stepping down next April. I’m expecting big movement over the next 10 months.
This looks pretty solid to me. Should receive dividend today and then just wait for the next one. They did a nice job raising dividend this quarter and expect it to be the same next quarter which makes for a nice return.
is there any information on this stock as to why it is crashing?
"OZM to convert to C-Corp, plans 1 for 10 reverse split. Announces strategic plan to complete generational transfer. Dan Och and former executive managing directors agree to reallocate significant equity."
2.35 dividend coming up ex dividend date feb 24 ..
The earnings coukd support a 50 bucks valuations here !! Still undervalued at this level !!
SCU announces results next week. Not sure why Yahoo does not pick up their PRs.https://www.sculptor.com/news/press-releases/2021-10-21-sculptor-capital-management-to-announce-2021-third-quarter-results/_res/id=Attachments/index=0/3q2021%20-%20Earnings%20Call%20Announcement%20Release.pdf
BLUEKIES !!! Finally....This should head to 30 bucks now..Goodluck Longs..
November return for OZ Master was +0.14%. On a relative basis it was not too bad. Many hedge funds are down -3% to -7% in November. AUM is level at $32.3bn as of Dec 1.
Sculptor Capital Management is up 4.91% to 25.87
"The day ended down, SCU is off by 1.2% with 1.5 normal volume. SCU to announce Q3 earnings on Nov 3rd. If Tuesday is down I'm selling my position."
"is this a smart buy at this price, or should I wait till it comes down?"
"It would seem that this market cap is twice as much as it really is due to the class B shares, which have no economic interest and are instead used for voting."
"Low float only 17 millions, these could go for a good run here !!"
I’ll have to set the day aside to ponder where to spend my 2 cent dividend! So many things you can buy with $32 bucks.
What is SCU pulling back so much these last few trading days?
