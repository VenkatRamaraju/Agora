OZM reached a new All Time Low at $1.14
is there any information on this stock as to why it is crashing?
I say it's worth $5/share within 12 months. Management has kept comp expenses in check and AuM is starting to turn the corner. The main fund has had 3 down months in the last 24. I'm concerned that effective management fee rate continues to fall but my guess is that we're at (or very near the bottom).
"After 3 1/2 years of being absolutely flogged by OZM, all of a sudden it's a Superstar. Ironic."
2.35 dividend coming up ex dividend date feb 24 ..
OZM reached a new All Time Low at 1.89
It will be on a strong upward trend if report for June shows stable AUM and continued strong performance. OZM on average has been a money making machine for many years. I expect over the next 2 years they will provide a nice return.
What's the scoop with the dividend pay dates and amounts? Looks like they're random? Thanks in advance for any info.
Broke the TA resistance at 27.90 this should go now ..!!
"Not sure why yahoo does not catch all of their press releases. Their next earnings conference call is May 6, 2021:https://shareholders.sculptor.com/websites/sculptor/English/0/home.html"
Sculptor Capital Management is up 4.95% to 26.49
Looks like the employee stock bonuses hit today. I would think some of them would hold them for a while. No optimism about their own work? None of them are underpaid!
Reasonably priced for a 10+% dividend as well as growth which makes for a very nice return. I could see this at $28 before next dividend.
OZM reached a new All Time Low at $1.10
No news and down? OZM makes tremendous money. I say they will beat estimates for the year and declare a .07-.10 cent per share dividend.
"From the recent earnings call: "" fourth-quarter 2020 distributable earnings of $342 million and a full-year distributable earnings of $279 million. Adjusted distributable earnings were $343 million for the fourth quarter and $406 million for the full-year 2020. Additionally, we have declared a cash dividend of $2.35 per Class A share.Revenues were $600 million for the fourth quarter, up 124% from the fourth quarter of 2019. And for the full-year 2020, revenues were $876 million, up 52% from 2019. Management fees were $70 million in the fourth quarter, up 11% from the previous quarter and up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2019 due to increased AUM and recovery of deferred CLO fees. Management fees were $250 million in the year 2020, 5% higher than 2019."""

"I might need to throw in the towel here. When you're wrong, you're wrong. There's no way OZM can survive. Salaries + bonuses are too high and their not spending nearly enough on biz development.

Good report !! Citi 48 bucks PT shoukd come into fruition!!
good to see AUM increased by 400m to 32b now..nice positive tractions..
OZM is up 6.12% to 2.60
$2.50 is almost here. Good volume this morning. Someone is selling out. Is this Abrams Capital? Either way this is either a smoking buy or it's in real bad shape. Market is pricing the worst....so down it goes sitting at a 52 week low / all time low.
In a holding pattern until year end results announced. I expect them to meet or exceed expectations. A very good bargain at today’s price.
Ozm breaking OUT!!!!
Sculptor Capital Management is up 5.06% to 27.63
"OZM share price has dropped a lot more than the AUM decline since 2015 (33% drop in AUM vs -90% in share price). What really doesn't seem to make sense is that AUM didn't really change from 3Q17 to 3Q18, staying at about $32bn with slightly less profitable mix, but the shares are down -67% in this time. The company is not headed for a default as the closest debt maturity is in 2023. So what has put the shares down this much? I can only think maybe the fixed expenses vs. AUM, or the spat that Dan Och had with Jimmy Levin had over succession in at the beginning of 2018. The share price reaction looks totally out of line with the actual decline in the business. I wish management/Dan Och would get out there and try to address what is going on."
Booooom!!! BREAKOUT!!!!

It’s going to be very difficult for these guys to show a good result when they overpay themselves. $20 mil per quarter accrual for bonuses alone. They need to dump some upper level dead weight!
Got back out but will be interesting to see if it holds over 288 level
Back up the truck here !! Just a matter of time getting paid while waiting!!
Sculptor Capital Management is up 4.91% to 25.87
"It would seem that this market cap is twice as much as it really is due to the class B shares, which have no economic interest and are instead used for voting."
"The 3Q conference call was not so bad, though the shares went down again afterwards The company seems to be in the very early innings of a possible rebound. With all the lawsuits settled, they have been approved by a private bank for its investors, working on more, and consultants are telling institutions that it is investable again. I think if performance this year in the OZ Master Fund was better (say at least mid-single digits) they would be getting good new flows. Maybe at the start of 2019, if institutions start moving money away from equities. The performance of the credit and real estate funds has been fabulous, 12.7% and 22% annualized returns. Those businesses definitely have potential to grow."
All the key stats on this are outdated in this app.
"OZM to convert to C-Corp, plans 1 for 10 reverse split. Announces strategic plan to complete generational transfer. Dan Och and former executive managing directors agree to reallocate significant equity."

Ex dividend tomorrow. Good sized divvy. Hang on...watch it grow a little and collect another dividend in 3 months.
"is this a smart buy at this price, or should I wait till it comes down?"
"Float only 24 millions and outstanding at 58 millions.. if it’s time to go this low float will propel this stock much higher .. Fundamentally strong with recent report, with dividend at 12% this is one of best dividend play out there !!!"

It appears that a major player of SCU is unwinding their position. You can see that starting Aug 19th there have been several days of heavy selling. It appears that there is support at the 25.5 price level. SCU has not been able to break into any new highs. The 12 monthly avg dividend is an abberation. You can see that the 1q21 was a one-time event. The principal is pulling 33 million dollars out of this company and has brought in his son at 3.5 million a year as well. This is typical. The good news is that once the profit taking by the institution is complete we have a good shot of this turning up again. My 2 cents.
This looks pretty solid to me. Should receive dividend today and then just wait for the next one. They did a nice job raising dividend this quarter and expect it to be the same next quarter which makes for a nice return.
Good earn report. Looks like the outflow is starting to stop. Assets grew into the beginning of this yr. earns are positive. Declared a .07 dividend.

Just read a post on SA that said Citi has a $48.50 price target.
Buy .30 divined
AUM stable @ $32.3 billion as of Dec 1. I think this is good news. It means redemptions for the November deadline were minimal. Anyone have more insite into this?
"Ahh, today is ex-dividend date. Many who bought to get the big divi are moving on. Sigh ..."

"The day ended down, SCU is off by 1.2% with 1.5 normal volume. SCU to announce Q3 earnings on Nov 3rd. If Tuesday is down I'm selling my position."
So some righteously indignant judge goes on a power rant and OZM drops like a rock. Does anybody think that business in African countries doesn’t require unsavory business practices? How pristine and perfect are the complainants in this case? I bet you can’t buy or sell a pack of chewing gum in Africa without bribing somebody.
"bankruptcy, bankruptcy, bankruptcy"
this should be 26 within a couple of weeks when it is only a month left til next ex div day.
"seems that OZM goes down in ""down market"", but then in up market it goes down again."
"What is the share price commensurate with that dividend? Presently, a 10% dividend. Seems that a share price of 46 with a 5% dividend would be a fair value. Thoughts?"

"I am a long time holder of Alternative Asset Managers (FIG, BX, SCU) and hold 26,000 shares of SCU. Although I am biased, I really believe SCU is a solid long term turnaround play. As AUM start to climb as I expect they will begin in 2021 I expect the street to take notice. It was almost $30 a year ago and they are in much better shape today so I think $30-$35 by end of 2021 is very plausible."

No other insiders have been selling. Good riddance, get rid of him, and then put the firm back on track."
(TTM) statistics will change dramatically with year end reporting. I don’t see a reason why this doesn’t go to $4-$5 range
Hopefully SCU is doing a good job of insulating their clients investments from this downturn. This downturn could bring in massive inflows if they hedged this correctly.

"This isn't a stock for short term investors. They need at least a 2 years to even begin to overcome the damage done FCPA settlement and poor return performance. I don't see any of the big money cutting and running and they have in fact been dumping in more. I wouldn't bet the farm on OZM , but if you have some money that you can live without for 5 years or allocate some DRIP to it, you could come out a big winner."

"So, the shares are down from 1.60 to 1.10 just a month ago on what did not seem to be very much new news, from an already low level. Any theories on why? There is no short interest to speak of."
Falling on heavy volume while the Market is up 1%. Based on its PE this is a $26 stock. This company is now nearing my stop loss.Without any news other than heavy selling as an earning report is about to happen I'm concerned.The number to watch for is the AMU. If this number is below the previous quarter then SCU will probably go down some more.

Found this stock with the stock screener. Looks promising. Pandemics can create disaster and opportunities at the same time.
Heavy volume this AM and SCU is essentially flat. I would expect that after the large decline that buyers would be rushing in but they are not. The quarterly earnings report will be out the first week of November. Does someone know something that the rest of us do not?
This is too cheap presently compared to its peers.. This will eventually gap up as market realized the bargain play..
Up nice today only need another $25 per share to get back to even

Unfortunate to see Rob Shafir is stepping down next April. I’m expecting big movement over the next 10 months.
No news big drop?
"I didn't sell. It looks like the institution has finished dumping their position or they're simply waiting for the price to move back up before they're back at it again. If you look at a three-month graph you'll see that there is a ceiling at the $28.5 price level we may have something to cheer about if the price should manage to exceed that. It'll all depend on what this quarter's dividend is and what the Assets Under Management (AMU) number comes out as. On the upside, many of the similar funds have reported earnings that exceeded expectations. Most analysts feel that SCU is a great fund.On the downside based on the historical PE ratio, SCU is simply a $26 dollar security.I'm concerned that an institution would dump its position just before earnings. Do they know something?My advice is to tighten your stop orders the morning of the 3rd and cross your fingers.If it goes to hell you can come back in and buy this back at a lower price after the crash.If it goes up then adjust your stops and pat yourself on the back. Best of luck to all of us."
This is a BUY. Company is worth at least $32/share. Dividend is nice too but upside is above and beyond that
"This company actually makes good money. Current ratio over 3, great levered free cash flow, almost $1 per share in cash on hand. Contingencies like bonuses and lawsuits are accrued. Damned if I can figure out why it’s in the $1.40’s right now."
"It's pretty clear that this company plans on delisting IMO. The value, if you can call it that, is in the funds directly, not this stock. The employees are clearly treating their options as if worthless. I'm long and this is extremely disappointing. Does anyone disagree with this outcome?"

What’s up with the big drop? No new news is there?
"the officers of this co. are doing great ,why am i not happy."
They have 350 million of accrued but unrecognized earnings growing in their credit funds. The return on that alone would pay their 2 cent dividend. They accrue 20 mil in bonus per quarter and that isn’t enough?
Capital mismanagement. Probably a ponzi.
