Why can't this break 32 again?
"Two things but number one this is a buy in point. we had all these upgrades to 120 and change. more realistic was Credit Suisse downgrades AnaptysBio (NASDAQ:ANAB) from Outperform to Neutral and slashes the price target from $137 to $79, an 18% upside. hey 57 to 79 is attainable and nice profit. we came down not on our data but in regn's in sympathy to theirs.i just bought in again and it really shouldnt go lower. totally oversold."
Buy and wait for the 20s
What has happened ???????
Ok... who sold in after hours
"now....why is this stock going up today, news?"
"GSK has no option than to buy ANAB..How much would they offer .With all the royalty that they have to pay us ,they will save money if they buy ANAB ."
This is a no brainer opportunity! Should be back to 12-13 by Monday. Oversold!
"""Johan"" - Did you noticed, ANAB has lately had late day price action fade. Starts OK, only to fade away at the market close. I might heed your advise and sell soon. The stock has stalled out in this $15 - $16 range."
What do we think the price will be at by late December?
ANAB is down -6.93% to 87.81
Holding.
"July 20, 2021Biotech company AnaptysBio (NASDAQ: ANAB) has received a takeover approach and is currently working with an investment bank to solicit interest from other potential suitors, according to a source.AnaptysBio is a clinical-stage biotechnology focused on inflammation. The company’s pipeline includes imsidolimab, its anti-IL-36R antibody, previously referred to as ANB019, for the treatment of dermatological inflammatory diseases, including generalized pustular psoriasis, or GPP, EGFRi skin toxicity, ichthyosis, hidradenitis suppurativa and acne.The company is expected to have multiple imsidolimab Phase 2 readouts over the next 18 months. In addition, imsidolimab is expected to advance into Phase 3 trials for GPP mid-year. GPP is an systemic, life-threatening inflammatory disease characterized by widespread pustules. There are no currently approved therapies or treatments for GPP and the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to imsidolimab for GPP.Earlier in the year, AnaptysBio had a setback after imsidolimab failed to meet its primary endpoint in moderate-to-severe palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP). However, it will continue to be studied in the five other immuno-dermatological indications.Further, its anti-PD-1 agonist program, ANB030, is in trials for the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases where immune checkpoint receptors are insufficiently activated. The company’s BTLA modulator program, ANB032, is broadly applicable to human inflammatory diseases associated with lymphoid and myeloid immune cell dysregulation.Also, unlike many biotech companies, AnaptysBio has commercial partnerships with GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) and is expected to report about $66 million in royalty revenue this year from JEMPERLI and Zejula. The company also has a partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY).AnaptysBio is also in a solid cash position, with $387 million in cash at the end of Q1 with a projected 2021 net cash burn of about $100 million.The average price target on ANAB is $31.83, suggesting 24% upside from current levels."
This goes down everyday with no apparent news--what gives
"Hal Barron, GSK R&D chiefOctober 26, 2020 09:20 AM EDTUpdated 09:37 AMDealsWith FDA decision looming, GSK sweetens the PD-1 pot for discovery partner AnaptysBio as Hal Barron moves to guard his oncology strategyJohn CarrollEditor & Founder￼Hamza SuriaAnaptysBio $ANAB CEO Hamza Suria is counting up the money he’s due from GlaxoSmithKline.GSK’s Hal Barron inherited a partnership with AnaptysBio when he bought out Tesaro and gained the PARP drug Zejula a couple of years ago for $5 billion. And he’s willing to pay for the right to try various checkpoint combination drugs with Zejula now that the PD-1 he also got in the deal is teed up for a likely near-term approval.What changed?advertisement￼advertisementFor one, Suria’s company filed a lawsuit against GSK saying they had violated the old Tesaro deal when they started a PD-1 combo study for Zejula using Merck’s PD-1 king Keytruda for non-small cell lung cancer. Their deal, the biotech alleged, was supposed to be exclusive. That lawsuit, scheduled to head to trial next spring, called for GSK to hand back the drug, dubbed dostarlimab. And in August they gave GSK 60 days to cure the breach.To facilitate the new deal, GSK is handing over $60 million as an added sweetener in the next month. But they’re also giving AnaptysBio, which licensed out the PD-1 (dostarlimab) to Tesaro 6 years ago — along with TIM-3 (cobolimab) and LAG-3 antibodies (GSK4069889A) — a bigger piece of the checkpoint pie.The way the deal was originally structured, AnaptysBio would get a 4%-to-8% slice of the revenue on dostarlimab. That 8% was due on sales over $1 billion a year.Now, GSK is willing to pay significantly more in royalties.Under the new arrangement, as outlined by Suria’s company, the royalties to AnaptysBio now start at 8% and heads to 25%. That’s 8% for everything below $1 billion and 12% to 25% for everything above the blockbuster line.There’s still a little more than a billion dollars in milestones in the deal, and Suria believes he’s going to pick up $75 million in the next 18 months for FDA and EMA approvals of dostarlimab as Barron hunts US approval before the end of the year for endometrial cancer. Not so well known is Barron’s plans to file for using the PD-1 to treat mismatch repair deficient cancers on a pan-tumor basis in H1 2021.Suria is counting on $165 million in sales milestones and also gets 1% of all Zejula sales. And the new money is all tied to freeing GSK to do Zejula combos with third-party molecules.GSK has had a tough time convincing analysts that the runner-up PARP behind AstraZeneca and the number 7 PD-(L)1 behind a slew of rivals have big futures.But he seems absolutely determined to prove them wrong. And he’s willing to pay for the privilege.Oncology loomed large when Barron was brought in to head up GSK’s top-15 R&D group. The pharma giant needs to score some significant successes in cancer R&D, following the approval of belantamab mafodotin a few months ago, and they shouldn’t have long to wait now."
"Wowww, again a 100.000 buy"
Sell! Sell! Sell! So I can pick up some more shares.
"3B market cap, no product. What a joke!"
AnaptysBio is up 6.37% to 26.72
"Rumors are...GKS has started buying .... Although I dont believe rumors like that....I will keep an rye on the volume....if there is every now and then a big buy (+100.000shares in 1 trade) then it means something.But 1 thing is sure....Anab will go quickly above his cash position. ( means + $17)GSK and Celgene are not small players and they made a deal with Anab. Which means, they think the drugs should work!"
This is a classic case that gives us high confidence in success at p-3. GL
"Trading volume dropping last few days. Most likely today's volume will be between 600K to 500K shares traded. l hope to see, no late day fading today. That has been the norm."
"1 month ago 2 big institution bought many million shares, they know something we do not know?"
Adding 3500 shares here in the afterhours
Short this pig this belongs no where near the price it is at
Management is the biggest joke of this company--all stole your money
Just picked up more shares today.
"""Stanford researchers pursue AnaptysBio's embattled IL-33 drug in peanut allergy""https://www.fiercebiotech.com/research/anaptysbio-s-antibody-drug-shows-early-promise-peanut-allergy"
Why is this down so much no news?????
Hold it. Monday is going to be good day.
What’s going on with the drop like a rock?
ANAB is up 7.16% to 121.97
"There is only 1 thing important now....the results of Etokimab study nasal polyps.This very quarter Anab will have the results. So 2 things possible....in worst case....bad results....which would mean that Etokimab is commercial worthless.Last time it went to $10. ( 30% below fait value)Let say those results would come in in februari....cash will be at around $14/share.Minus 30% = $9Or less because when it went to $10, there was still hope for Etokimab.Of course, on good results, the pps could double.As you can see....not easy to make the right decision today....sell, keep...buy more...."
I wonder if MM can get it beloow 15 today to wipe out the long calls. There are no puts to offset.
"Ok, reached now $11.25That was the hight of the day last friday. So now there is nobody left with a loss.From here we will only see huge buys....till around the $20But in case Celgene or GSK are buying....it wont stop at $20It will go rather quickly to +$16"
I lost approx $4000 in this stock. Bought it at $110 and had to sell at $67 yesterday. Any suggestions how do I recover the money?
Shorted 17k shares at 66
I love a clearance sale....
ANAB is down -7.56% to 70.34
"More than half million shares traded in the last hour !!!!!!!!!!! .The news is spreading .Hope that it is real news ,and if there is such news we shall hear within three days"
"DJI closes down almost -600 points today, and ANAB is up nicely. Wow!!"
"Way, overvalued with no real product. Phase 3 data due this month for peanut allergy. When something fails, stock will tank."
"Now I am buying ACPH.BRTheir drug was ok for FDA, safe and goid results in phase 3 .... but...they got CRL because the FDA checked the plant of the ingredient supplier and there were some issues.8 months later...again a CRL....for the same reason. This time, ACPH took another supplier that already successfully had some FDA inspections.(FDA did exact the same thing with POZN and a few others)In all cases, the thirth time the FDA approved the drug.So februari 26 is the date now to watch.Before the 2 CRL's, ACPH went from $ 1.5/2 to $4 in less then 2 months.There is no reason why it shouldnt do that again this time."
Guess someone knows a secret.........
"Just bought 10.000 more at $10.23Within a few days the daytraders are gone and slowly and steady fair value will be reached. $20/share, unless GSK buy them out. Then it will go higher then $20.And all those guys talking about dead cat and going to $8.....it would be like that with any other bio tech....but not with Anab. Anab is 1 of the very few who has no debt and $440m. Cash.And they burn 100 m./year.....so november 2020....Anab still has around $12/share.And that s the reason that there is a huge floor under this stock."
DID GSK made an offer ??????.Is anybody here !!!!!!!!
How's the shorters at 66? LOL
"Sold my ACPH.BR at #$%$3.52Now all my assets in cash and if Etokimab failes this quarter and the pps goes to $8 this quarter....I ll buy again. Otherwise sit on the sidelines for a while, no need to worry Iran, Virusses etc...."
"Most likely it's up because of a couple of 13-G filings on Edgar in the last couple of days. Some heavy hitters have taken some pretty large positions. Including Steven A. Cohen of Point72 Asset Management and Oleg Nodelman of EcoR1 Capital. I'm not familiar with Nodelman but Cohen is the guy the feds *attempted* to get for insider trading a few years ago. If memory serves they never could get the goods on him, however he wound up winding down his asset management firm and now trades only for himself and family members under the Point 72 moniker."
Good support in the low $10s. This should move back into the $13-$14 range in a few weeks.
"wow, why the pop today?"
Does the company has a duty to report if it was approached with a deal ????????
"(King) Edward, I believe you were referring to my post as worthless, not Jacqueline's. So, your homework is to provide to the board here, the RSI value, CCI value, and how about the Fast & Slow Stochastics values while your at it? Don't worry, I'll save you time. ALL those indicators are clearly showing ""oversold"" conditions. So, you need to learn to use a candlestick chart, not your line chart. So, what does today's Japanese candlestick pattern tell you about traders sentiment regarding AnaptysBio? Oh, that's right, no numbers, what do you do now, buy, or sell shares? Hmm...The Japanese candlesticks are the best technical tool for any trader, combine that with the above mentioned indicators, and you might have a worthy post yourself."
Is this where we can pay $81 for a $30 company?
GSK wii buy this company very soon .Why pay all that royalty every year .it will cost less to buy Anapty Bio .
"Etokimab belongs to a class of medicine that interferes with interleukin-33. IL-33 is a protein that drives the production of some immune cells. It works off the theory that eczema occurs when the immune system overreacts to a substance inside or outside the body.AnaptysBio is also trying to block another interleukin, IL-36R. In this, the biotech company is aiming to treat a form of psoriasis and another skin disorder. RBC's MacKay is more bullish on the chances for that program. But investors could begin to feel differently, he said.""In light of etokimab's failure and IL-36R outstanding questions, we anticipate increased skepticism around the value attributed to this asset,"" he said"
"I feel like ANAB was oversold today, it could be a good entry point with some obvious risk tied in. If ANAB is able to deliver well on what it has in its pipeline things could be looking on the upside. I still feel like it will have a rebound in the short-term but long-term is more risky but more risk means higher return we will just have to hope that the company is able to deliver and we could see some nice gains and revenues are up $4.8 Million up about 55% year over year so thats also a positive maybe the company will be able to make profits soon if all goes well. But I'll hold out for them and hope for the best"
"By the way, GSK is really betting big on Jemperli. The Itos collaboration is meant to increase Dostarlimab sales with Itos 's drug in a duet and/or triplet setup.Remember, Anab will get 8%/25% on worldwide sales. “For our TIGIT program, we announced a transformational strategic collaboration with GSK that will allow us to combine our resources and expand and accelerate the development program for EOS-448 through rapid evaluation of dostarlimab and triplet combinations beginning in the coming months."
why such a drop? downgrade really. omg the day I buy it :(
will this stock ever go back over 100 again?
What are the next milestones here for the next pump?
Book Value $16.60 -- Cash $15.60 ..Partnerships with GSK & Celgene ...late stage programs in Endometrial & Ovarian cancer both partnered with GSK ..and there is a lot more in the pipeline ...
This pig is dropping hard.
Good to sell ANAB at $16 or hold for more progress??
Buy now before it gets to 20+ soon

"""Johan"", hopefully AnaptysBio continues this nice pps recovery. I saw you bought back in today again. Did you see SAVA today? it was up 60%+. I should have reacted to the ""insider buying"" I saw last week. It seems like a nice rotation into biotech is occurring the last two weeks. GLTA."

ANAB is down -7.01% to 70.21
ANAB is down 7.62% to 66.30
Can this be shorted yet? Classic double top. It's over. Down it will go.
Great... futures are down and there is someone asking to sell at $10.20 and no buyers.
Wow 30% discount to cash....Overvalued. Why U ask? Most biotech with P2 failures trade 50% discount to cash and low as 30% cash value. That will put ANAB around 5-8 and it trading over 50-100% of typical trading PPS. Is it a one trick pony. Hard to say. Then agian would the drug suceed with current data. Hard to say. Risk and reward at play...Target price around 7...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always...
The trend is every day it will close at around ~ +2.30% ever since the big drop. This is very healthy for all long term investments situation. It will keep doing till they have next quarter result which will have big jump again given they are expecting strong quarter.

The Yahoo Finance MB has given us a support level of $10.00 a share. I believe the good volume and more buyers than sellers keeps us above $10.50?

The failure ""to disclose any numbers related to the primary endpoint does not provide any insights into the study's failure and we think shareholders deserve this information, and also deserved a conference call to discuss the data,"" they wrote. ""For full disclosure, [management] previously stated both p-values and the treatment effect would be provided when the data are announced.""The Anaptysbio press release noted that it anticipates top-line data from an interim analysis of its phase II ECLIPSE trial in the first quarter of 2020 and that rubbed Jefferies analysts the wrong way, too, as they wrote that ""the type of analysis has changed from final to an interim analysis. Even if positive, we don't think it would be commercially promising.""ECLIPSE is testing the drug in about 100 adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.

"I asked several brokers why this stock has been range bound for 5 trading days after dropping 71%. Well, ANAB still hasn't revealed the endpoint studies after its failed ATLAS Phase 2B Clinical Trial. This is highly unusual that a company cancels the trial going forward but won't reveal how bad the end-points are. So, we can presume it is extremely bad. This is why the main share holders dumped and ran for the hills and their is no large institutional buyer moving it up. This is dead in the water until any new news."
