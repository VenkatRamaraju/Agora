"More than half million shares traded in the last hour !!!!!!!!!!! .The news is spreading .Hope that it is real news ,and if there is such news we shall hear within three days"
Over 2 million shares traded showing there are still day traders swapping for 2 % more. This is good. I see $12 in 5-10 trading days with the selling and buying back and forth.
ANAB is down -7.56% to 70.34
Why it is up #.00 A H ?
"Almost all shares seems like owned by institutionals (Nasdaq website).I've looked at pipeline, oncoming results of a phase 3 and enough cash.(What not to like?)I'm thinking to buy some shares.Bullish and bearish sentiment appreciated, thx"
"let;s go AH ,let;s keep buying and force the news out .This year we have not seen many B.O. in the BIO .When they come ,they come in bunches ,we are waiting ."
Wow 30% discount to cash....Overvalued. Why U ask? Most biotech with P2 failures trade 50% discount to cash and low as 30% cash value. That will put ANAB around 5-8 and it trading over 50-100% of typical trading PPS. Is it a one trick pony. Hard to say. Then agian would the drug suceed with current data. Hard to say. Risk and reward at play...Target price around 7...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always...
Anyone have any insight why we’re down almost 10%???
Ok... who sold in after hours
Ouch... I almost bought this 2 weeks ago at $110 cuz it was eating re-shyt-erons lunch. But I got cold feet. If I'd have gotten out yesterday on the 120 spike I'd have been happy though... glad I listened to my feet...

Does anyone have access to the Sumzero pitch about $anab from today?
"10 million shares traded in just 2 hours....while there are less then 30 million....and a lot of them not free to trade....means only 1 thing....daytraders are selling and buying to eachother. They always do that on any stock when news like this comes out.It takes them 2 days, then they are gone and within a week, the pps will go to normal.Normal means cash + pipeline.Should be minimum $25.....let see what happens next week."
not sure about anabbut there are a lot of biotech bubbles like cbio and innt

Going out of business lmfao!! Notify berstein law
"1 month ago 2 big institution bought many million shares, they know something we do not know?"
will this stock ever go back over 100 again?
"""DavidM"", How does a business retain only 28% its value in one trading day? How ridiculous was the price action here on Friday. So, investors with no ""stop loss"" just crashed as bad as one possibly can. I don't follow this stock...my question is how did they get $420+ million in available cash? Total debt is only $7 million. I don't see any revenue growth. This stock will continue it's down trend...there is no value $0.00 for a ""support level"". Did you see the Stoo Loss value recommendation by YF?"
Well.... It hit 100 and it sold.... Bye.... Not don't go too high and make me feel bad... Good luck Robert!
Thanks dad

It's never easy is it? Looks like we open up around $10. NO buyers this morning.

"Etokimab belongs to a class of medicine that interferes with interleukin-33. IL-33 is a protein that drives the production of some immune cells. It works off the theory that eczema occurs when the immune system overreacts to a substance inside or outside the body.AnaptysBio is also trying to block another interleukin, IL-36R. In this, the biotech company is aiming to treat a form of psoriasis and another skin disorder. RBC's MacKay is more bullish on the chances for that program. But investors could begin to feel differently, he said.""In light of etokimab's failure and IL-36R outstanding questions, we anticipate increased skepticism around the value attributed to this asset,"" he said"

"I feel like ANAB was oversold today, it could be a good entry point with some obvious risk tied in. If ANAB is able to deliver well on what it has in its pipeline things could be looking on the upside. I still feel like it will have a rebound in the short-term but long-term is more risky but more risk means higher return we will just have to hope that the company is able to deliver and we could see some nice gains and revenues are up $4.8 Million up about 55% year over year so thats also a positive maybe the company will be able to make profits soon if all goes well. But I'll hold out for them and hope for the best"
I’m all in
Going to reopen under 2$ a share
Short this pig this belongs no where near the price it is at

"There is only 1 thing important now....the results of Etokimab study nasal polyps.This very quarter Anab will have the results. So 2 things possible....in worst case....bad results....which would mean that Etokimab is commercial worthless.Last time it went to $10. ( 30% below fait value)Let say those results would come in in februari....cash will be at around $14/share.Minus 30% = $9Or less because when it went to $10, there was still hope for Etokimab.Of course, on good results, the pps could double.As you can see....not easy to make the right decision today....sell, keep...buy more...."

Incredible short squeeze starting in CLVS fun to watch
The trend is every day it will close at around ~ +2.30% ever since the big drop. This is very healthy for all long term investments situation. It will keep doing till they have next quarter result which will have big jump again given they are expecting strong quarter.
"Rumors are...GKS has started buying .... Although I dont believe rumors like that....I will keep an rye on the volume....if there is every now and then a big buy (+100.000shares in 1 trade) then it means something.But 1 thing is sure....Anab will go quickly above his cash position.

Sell all your shares now. Bad news coming.
Maybe they just chose the wrong dose. Effectiveness drops off precipitously if not in linear area of PD curve. It is not as if their entire approach to antibody development is a sham. Is it?
"It's worse than you all think as they did not have a conference call and did not reveal how bad the failure of the drug testing as that affects the pipeline using the drug for other tests._____________________________________________""We're surprised by this outright failure as well as the lack of an investor call to discuss the most significant development in the history of the company,"" they wrote, adding that they anticipated ""increased skepticism around the value attributed to this asset.""It wasn't just the silence on the phone that didn't sit well with the analysts over at Jefferies on Friday. The failure ""to disclose any numbers related to the primary endpoint does not provide any insights into the study's failure and we think shareholders deserve this information, and also deserved a conference call to discuss the data,"" they wrote. ""For full disclosure, [management] previously stated both p-values and the treatment effect would be provided when the data are announced.""The Anaptysbio press release noted that it anticipates top-line data from an interim analysis of its phase II ECLIPSE trial in the first quarter of 2020 and that rubbed Jefferies analysts the wrong way, too, as they wrote that ""the type of analysis has changed from final to an interim analysis. Even if positive, we don't think it would be commercially promising.""ECLIPSE is testing the drug in about 100 adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Patients are being treated with two multidosing frequencies of subcutaneously administered etokimab or placebo, each in combination with mometasone furoate nasal spray as background therapy."

"Incredible to read the assortment of naysayers going way back on this thread. Doesn't add much to the credibility of many posters.Have been in this since the IPO of 16 not so long ago.Recent comments by many of the new ""all time highs"", certainly dwarf the many that were calling for a downfall many dollars ago...Dwarf in accuracy and quality....

What are the next milestones here for the next pump?
"DJI closes down almost -600 points today, and ANAB is up nicely. Wow!!"
Ouch
Guess someone knows a secret.........
"(King) Edward, I believe you were referring to my post as worthless, not Jacqueline's. So, your homework is to provide to the board here, the RSI value, CCI value, and how about the Fast & Slow Stochastics values while your at it? Don't worry, I'll save you time. ALL those indicators are clearly showing ""oversold"" conditions. So, you need to learn to use a candlestick chart, not your line chart. So, what does today's Japanese candlestick pattern tell you about traders sentiment regarding AnaptysBio? Oh, that's right, no numbers, what do you do now, buy, or sell shares? Hmm...The Japanese candlesticks are the best technical tool for any trader, combine that with the above mentioned indicators, and you might have a worthy post yourself."

Had to buy 10k shares today @10.20 for a rainy day. Panic selling makes me rich.
"I asked several brokers why this stock has been range bound for 5 trading days after dropping 71%. Well, ANAB still hasn't revealed the endpoint studies after its failed ATLAS Phase 2B Clinical Trial. This is highly unusual that a company cancels the trial going forward but won't reveal how bad the end-points are. So, we can presume it is extremely bad. This is why the main share holders dumped and ran for the hills and their is no large institutional buyer moving it up. This is dead in the water until any new news."
My 15k investment is now worth 1500.not sure if i can add more and average down at this point .
i will Buy ANAB with the bottom line. my guess Bottom line between 4 to 5..let see am i right?
One year target 142 or 42
I know something. The trails have bad results.
"Even after I delete all the robot spam, I do not see anything about why the drop today. Maybe the report,but nobody picking it apart for reasons for the down draft. Heck, do I have to do my own work?"

"The daytraders tried to get it under the $10 level to catch the stop loss orders.They failed 2 times today. So the 10.17 level is the minimum.We probably will end the day around $11.

How's the shorters at 66? LOL

Abandon ship.
"Up $31 just on proof of concept study thats absolute insane that doesnt mean the drug works , they need to conduct very large clinical trials (Phase 2b + 2x Phase3 ) which takes minimum 7-9 years to complete IF ever but this bubble fraud is valued like the drug getting tomorrow on market lololol .Dont let these criminal Banksters and Management steal your money thats why they promoted this pure GARBAGE ."

"July 20, 2021Biotech company AnaptysBio (NASDAQ: ANAB) has received a takeover approach and is currently working with an investment bank to solicit interest from other potential suitors, according to a source.AnaptysBio is a clinical-stage biotechnology focused on inflammation. The company’s pipeline includes imsidolimab, its anti-IL-36R antibody, previously referred to as ANB019, for the treatment of dermatological inflammatory diseases, including generalized pustular psoriasis, or GPP, EGFRi skin toxicity, ichthyosis, hidradenitis suppurativa and acne.The company is expected to have multiple imsidolimab Phase 2 readouts over the next 18 months. In addition, imsidolimab is expected to advance into Phase 3 trials for GPP mid-year. GPP is an systemic, life-threatening inflammatory disease characterized by widespread pustules. There are no currently approved therapies or treatments for GPP and the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to imsidolimab for GPP.Earlier in the year, AnaptysBio had a setback after imsidolimab failed to meet its primary endpoint in moderate-to-severe palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP). However, it will continue to be studied in the five other immuno-dermatological indications.Further, its anti-PD-1 agonist program, ANB030, is in trials for the treatment of certain autoimmune diseases where immune checkpoint receptors are insufficiently activated. The company’s BTLA modulator program, ANB032, is broadly applicable to human inflammatory diseases associated with lymphoid and myeloid immune cell dysregulation.Also, unlike many biotech companies, AnaptysBio has commercial partnerships with GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) and is expected to report about $66 million in royalty revenue this year from JEMPERLI and Zejula. The company also has a partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY).AnaptysBio is also in a solid cash position, with $387 million in cash at the end of Q1 with a projected 2021 net cash burn of about $100 million.The average price target on ANAB is $31.83, suggesting 24% upside from current levels."
DID GSK made an offer ??????.Is anybody here !!!!!!!!
Would be a great complimentary pickup for Glaxo.

"this company is burning through $100 million a year in cash and that is set to accelerate in the coming years. If they can't get a blockbuster product out over the next 2 years, then this company goes the way of the dodo biurd. that being said, there will always be pops and flops based on some newsworthy events like positive early stage trials and the like, whether or not they have any merit.

"I believe that if an offer to buy the company was made ,we should hear by Friday .i also believe that GSK can not afford to have anyone buy the company .They are entangled up to the neck the two of them .GSK is trying to buy on the cheap that is the problem ,but ,have to pay the price if someother company is involved ."
GSK wii buy this company very soon .Why pay all that royalty every year .it will cost less to buy Anapty Bio .
kind of looks like this stock wants to go to 100 again...

Last december about 3 trials ended. Be sure they know the (bad) results by now!!! But they wait to tell you so all (friends) funds has the time to sell their shares. Then they HAVE to bring out the bad news. And now it will go way lower then last time. Ceo is a #$%$. A rich #$%$.Their only hope is that GSK will succeed.

ANAB is up 7.19% to $81.41
"Most likely it's up because of a couple of 13-G filings on Edgar in the last couple of days. Some heavy hitters have taken some pretty large positions. Including Steven A. Cohen of Point72 Asset Management and Oleg Nodelman of EcoR1 Capital. I'm not familiar with Nodelman but Cohen is the guy the feds *attempted* to get for insider trading a few years ago. If memory serves they never could get the goods on him, however he wound up winding down his asset management firm and now trades only for himself and family members under the Point 72 moniker."
This is a classic case that gives us high confidence in success at p-3. GL

"Ceo of Anab is not capable.Etokimab was proven to be good for peanutallergy. He choose not to do trials. He choose exzema stuff...and lost.While he was wasting time and money....other bio techs succeeded in peanutallergy::DBV TECHNOLOGIE/S ADR (NASDAQ: DBVT) announced positive results for the three-year, open-label extension study of the Phase 3 PEPITES trial that evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of its investigational Viaskin Peanut in peanut-allergic children ages 4-11. ""The results demonstrate long-term clinical benefit as shown by an increase in eliciting dose, which may decrease the chance of reacting to an accidental peanut exposure,"" the company said.The stock was trading 21% higher at $13.70 at the time of publication. And some other info....the results of failing Etokimab study was known long before he informed you. Or did you really think that he is obligated to inform you the same day that he knows the results???? He s not!!!Thats why he did it together with the q3 results. Means he is a coward and/or lazy. And considering the other 3 trials.....all 3 should have been finished in december! So he must have at least inside how far we stand....but...no news. In bio tech world....when they keep the news ....probably bad news. I would not be surprised to hear the bad news during the next company results....and without a q&a. He also said to file IND in december. Means he also doesn t know the word ""respect""I am moving further. In case of bad news....and it goes below $8/9 next month.....yea....maybe I buy back. But only because I know that Celgene and GSK still doing the trials, which means....so far so good. Otherwise they would already stopped.My thinking is....when Etokimab can not cure ""skin bubbles"".....it probably also can not cure ""nose bubbles"". Hamza knows this as well. But he earns huge amount of money....with salary and free shares...and maybe other stuff as well.Now I am buying ACPH.BRFebruari 26 is the FDA date....Bought NVUS as well. And remember...making money in the stockmarket....to earn money...it has little to do what you buy....but everything to do with...to know when to sell!And take in mind....we are not perfect...so we can only sell....too soon....or too late!

"$AIMT their peanut allergy medication is better tolerated, tested for 300 600 and 1000 mg, has more participants, and also finished with phase 3. Clearly the winner"
Adding 3500 shares here in the afterhours
AnaptysBio is up 8.20% to 27.84
Zacks had this as a momentum buy on 10/31.Is Zacks tied with Crammer for bad calls?
Is this finished??
For a stock that is going up every day this is a very quiet board.
Good to sell ANAB at $16 or hold for more progress??
"Hal Barron, GSK R&D chiefOctober 26, 2020 09:20 AM EDTUpdated 09:37 AMDealsWith FDA decision looming, GSK sweetens the PD-1 pot for discovery partner AnaptysBio as Hal Barron moves to guard his oncology strategyJohn CarrollEditor & Founder￼Hamza SuriaAnaptysBio $ANAB CEO Hamza Suria is counting up the money he’s due from GlaxoSmithKline.GSK’s Hal Barron inherited a partnership with AnaptysBio when he bought out Tesaro and gained the PARP drug Zejula a couple of years ago for $5 billion. And he’s willing to pay for the right to try various checkpoint combination drugs with Zejula now that the PD-1 he also got in the deal is teed up for a likely near-term approval.What changed?advertisement￼advertisementFor one, Suria’s company filed a lawsuit against GSK saying they had violated the old Tesaro deal when they started a PD-1 combo study for Zejula using Merck’s PD-1 king Keytruda for non-small cell lung cancer. Their deal, the biotech alleged, was supposed to be exclusive. That lawsuit, scheduled to head to trial next spring, called for GSK to hand back the drug, dubbed dostarlimab. And in August they gave GSK 60 days to cure the breach.To facilitate the new deal, GSK is handing over $60 million as an added sweetener in the next month. But they’re also giving AnaptysBio, which licensed out the PD-1 (dostarlimab) to Tesaro 6 years ago — along with TIM-3 (cobolimab) and LAG-3 antibodies (GSK4069889A) — a bigger piece of the checkpoint pie.The way the deal was originally structured, AnaptysBio would get a 4%-to-8% slice of the revenue on dostarlimab. That 8% was due on sales over $1 billion a year.Now, GSK is willing to pay significantly more in royalties.Under the new arrangement, as outlined by Suria’s company, the royalties to AnaptysBio now start at 8% and heads to 25%. That’s 8% for everything below $1 billion and 12% to 25% for everything above the blockbuster line.There’s still a little more than a billion dollars in milestones in the deal, and Suria believes he’s going to pick up $75 million in the next 18 months for FDA and EMA approvals of dostarlimab as Barron hunts US approval before the end of the year for endometrial cancer. Not so well known is Barron’s plans to file for using the PD-1 to treat mismatch repair deficient cancers on a pan-tumor basis in H1 2021.Suria is counting on $165 million in sales milestones and also gets 1% of all Zejula sales. And the new money is all tied to freeing GSK to do Zejula combos with third-party molecules.GSK has had a tough time convincing analysts that the runner-up PARP behind AstraZeneca and the number 7 PD-(L)1 behind a slew of rivals have big futures.But he seems absolutely determined to prove them wrong. And he’s willing to pay for the privilege.Oncology loomed large when Barron was brought in to head up GSK’s top-15 R&D group. The pharma giant needs to score some significant successes in cancer R&D, following the approval of belantamab mafodotin a few months ago, and they shouldn’t have long to wait now."
Just got a hot tip from (http://stocktip.xyz)
It is time for the company to say yes or no !!!!!!!!
$11.54 now
Buy and wait for the 20s
"Ok, reached now $11.25That was the hight of the day last friday. So now there is nobody left with a loss.From here we will only see huge buys....till around the $20But in case Celgene or GSK are buying....it wont stop at $20It will go rather quickly to +$16"
Buy! Buy! Buy!
It has been steady for the last few days.
This Co seems utterly untrustworthy. The ceo is constantly selling shares. He acquired shares for 1$ and sold for a millions. Not a great sign.
nice
Anyone knows why this is dropping -20% today?
ABANDON SHIP!
This goes down everyday with no apparent news--what gives
"What dose cumulative mean here? If it’s 50mg every day for ten days, it’s very different from a 500mg dose"
ANAB reached a new All Time High at 118.32
Insiders dumped their shares last June in the 70's... Gotta watch the insiders
No news and down this much
Buy order in at 11.11
"By the way, GSK is really betting big on Jemperli. The Itos collaboration is meant to increase Dostarlimab sales with Itos 's drug in a duet and/or triplet setup.Remember, Anab will get 8%/25% on worldwide sales. “For our TIGIT program, we announced a transformational strategic collaboration with GSK that will allow us to combine our resources and expand and accelerate the development program for EOS-448 through rapid evaluation of dostarlimab and triplet combinations beginning in the coming months."
Just picked up more shares today.
Great... futures are down and there is someone asking to sell at $10.20 and no buyers.
What’s going on?
David B -& others . What good is $15 a share in cash if the Co is going to burn it all up while trying to figure out if it’s premiere drug asset does anything other than burn up cash in phase 2 trials ? Asking for a friend .
$444m cash on hand
What is the Total Available Market of the PPP indication vs all of the other compounds in development? If it is 40% then the move is warranted. What is the revenue opportunity of the pipeline in a JV with the two large pharma partners ? This should guide your risk vs reward over the long term
Let us hope that GSK does not do to us what i believe did to HGSI in 2012 .
"Can't decide it taking on a position at $10.40 today was a good move or not... Even with all the bad news, this seems vastly undervalued.... Guess I'll sweat it out for a minute."
"Stock is moving in the right direction. Any opinions on it holding an upward trend, or is this a one week move on eps"
"The last 2 months the trend has been up,a few moments where it was down 3-4 days,tomorrow is the 5th day,if it doesn’t go up tomorrow I think it’s time to abandon the ship.tommorrow is key.!"
Looks like it opens up around $9.50
ANAB is down -5.81% to 113.07
It is up nicely today.
Look at the graphic... it’s just a correction before it goes to 20+
What's with this stock?
"Just bought 10.000 more at $10.23Within a few days the daytraders are gone and slowly and steady fair value will be reached. $20/share, unless GSK buy them out. Then it will go higher then $20.And all those guys talking about dead cat and going to $8.....it would be like that with any other bio tech....but not with Anab. Anab is 1 of the very few who has no debt and $440m. Cash.And they burn 100 m./year.....so november 2020....Anab still has around $12/share.And that s the reason that there is a huge floor under this stock."
"In 2019 and 2018, the CEO, Chief Medical Officer, CFO, and a Director sold ANAB from $70 - $86. Now that the stock has fallen to 1/7th of what they sold the stock for, no insider has purchased ANAB. What does this tell you that they won't touch the stock of the company they are controlling and where they see all the test valuations before you do. See the link below for their insider sales.https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1370053.htm"
"Way, overvalued with no real product. Phase 3 data due this month for peanut allergy. When something fails, stock will tank."
$ANAB last day to file to recover funds https://www.glancylaw.com/news-faqs/anab-case-urgent-may-26-2020-deadline-to-file-lead-plaintiff-motion-in-anaptysbio-inc-anab-class-action-lawsuit/
Good news coming soon.
What will they do with $444 m cash?
"Now I am buying ACPH.BRTheir drug was ok for FDA, safe and goid results in phase 3 .... but...they got CRL because the FDA checked the plant of the ingredient supplier and there were some issues.8 months later...again a CRL....for the same reason. This time, ACPH took another supplier that already successfully had some FDA inspections.(FDA did exact the same thing with POZN and a few others)In all cases, the thirth time the FDA approved the drug.So februari 26 is the date now to watch.Before the 2 CRL's, ACPH went from $ 1.5/2 to $4 in less then 2 months.There is no reason why it shouldnt do that again this time."
It will fall by 90% when it collides with reality. Keep buying.
Bought 10 dec 30 calls for 10.45 and 10 nov 25 put for 0.65. End up making 5k. Amazing
"$MRNS $CARA $AUPH $SGMO $CNAT $CALA $MNKD $ANAB $MRTX $NLNK ALL THOSE biotech SCAMS will end up like $DCTH. Their chart will be down by 99% soon. Some in a year, some sooner some later. Remember 99% US small biotech companies are scams."
"now....why is this stock going up today, news?"

Thanks all the day traders for selling.

"wow, why the pop today?"
"Long here with AnaptysBio. It will be slow growth...one doji or spinning top candle at a time. This is no SAVA. Been waiting 5-weeks now for a gap up, or as the Japanese say, a ""raised window""."
Wednesday is conference for ANAB and they are selling now...what do they know?
Market Cap only $277 Million / Cash $ 422 Million ..Look at their pipeline and you will know why now its A MONSTER BUYING OPP https://www.anaptysbio.com/pipeline/overview/
This will go higher.
Any chart enthusiasts out there? Top of narrow Bollinger Band saying to sell and Elliot Wave signal saying to triple down. What more negative news could be out there. I only see blue skys but paranoid.
ANAB is up 7.09% to 94.00
