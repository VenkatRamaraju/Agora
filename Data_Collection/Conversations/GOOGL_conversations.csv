I'm new to the stock and I bought class C shares GOOG and am seeing that class A is higher after hours. I unknowingly did it but it seems to me there shouldn't be much of a difference. your thought? Thanks
GOOGL heading to $3000. Not too late to buy in 
"Superb, indomitable investment!"
"U.S. senators aim to stop vaccine misinformation by going after tech's legal immunityWASHINGTON, July 22 (Reuters) - Two Democratic U.S. senators on Thursday will add to the stack of bills going after Section 230 - a law that protects tech companies from being sued over content posted by users - making such platforms responsible for health-related misinformation.The legislation introduced by Amy Klobuchar and Ben Ray Lujan requires internet platforms such as Facebook to take down health and vaccine-related misinformation during public health emergencies or be held liable for that failure.It also directs the Department of Health & Human Services to issue guidelines on what constitutes health misinformation.""These are some of the biggest, richest companies in the world and they must do more to prevent the spread of deadly vaccine misinformation,"" Klobuchar said.The bill quotes a study from the Center for Countering Digital Hate that found social media platforms failed to act on 95% of coronavirus-related disinformation reported to them.Kevin Martin, a vice president of public policy at Facebook, said the company supports reforming Section 230.""We believe clarification on the difficult and urgent questions about health related misinformation would be helpful and look forward to working with Congress and the industry as we consider options for reform.""The Health Misinformation Act is not the first bill targeting tech firms' liability shield from Senator Klobuchar, who chairs the Senate antitrust subcommittee.Earlier this year, she co-sponsored another bill called the Safe Tech Act with two fellow Democrats. It aims to make social media companies more accountable for enabling cyber-stalking, targeted harassment and discrimination on their platforms."
WHAT A SURPRISE! ANOTHER NEW HIGH! Like clockwork 
"Biden to tap Google foe Jonathan #$%$er to head DOJ's antitrust divisionPresident Joe Biden plans to name lawyer Jonathan #$%$er as the Justice Department's antitrust chief, the White House announced Tuesday. #$%$er has been described as a foe of Google GOOG, +2.02% GOOGL, 1.85%, representing companies that have pushed enforcers to sue the search giant, according to Bloomberg. The position requires Senate confirmation."
The sun rises again today over GOOG.
Is it can close over 2750 today?
2900 today
Going gangbusters!
Ad revenue appears to be going through the roof these days from all the. amor players. Should bode very well for GOOG considering their top 2 most profitable lines of business are AdWords/Search Advertising and AdSense Network.
Can you get through a day without Google?
"On all of these patent infringement cases, I predict Google pays nominal upfront licensing fees. Instead they will negotiate ongoing deals that give a cut of the revenue pie to the alleged infringed. Out of court win-win settlements. I continue holding my 500$890 shares. GLTA"
Every quarter GOOG shows its still a growth company.... yet every quarter naysayers say its not.... time to increase those PE alogos here
"jmho....but the price differential between the g and the gl was significant recently....those purchasing the gl on those days obviously bought at a discount which today is reflected in the prices, quite similar ....... I am wondering if that price differential was intentional, granting preference to major holders or sophisticated market knowledgeable people knowing the earnings report would be bullish and buying the gl at the expense of those buying the g on those days."
"No more conspiracy theories anymore, its all fact. All the people that have been banned on the big tech platforms have been proven right as what they predicted has happened. Big tech removed them because they didn't want people to see what they predicted actually happening because then it's not incompetency it is a plan."
"LIKE CLOCKWORK, ANOTHER NEW HIGH LOL. BULLETPROOF "

"Bank of England eyes power of Amazon, Microsoft and Google in financeThe Bank of England is worried about the growing power of cloud computing in finance, calling for new regulations to govern the use of services like Amazon (AMZN) Web Services and Microsoft (MSFT) Azure in fields like banking and insurance.The central bank flagged the growth of cloud computing as a key area of concern in its bi-annual Financial Stability Report, which looks at risks to the UK's financial stability and how prepared firms. Members of the Financial Policy Committee said: ""Additional policy measures to mitigate financial stability risks in this area are needed.""""Cloud service providers are an increasingly integral part of the infrastructure of the financial system,"" Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey told journalists. ""There's many good reasons for that — it is a model that works. But as they become more integral, obviously the risks to the system increase, the systemic risks increase, and it becomes much more an area of focus.""Bailey said the Bank of England was concerned about the security of new cloud systems, many of which are guarded by secrecy.""The model has been developed in quite an opaque and closed fashion,"" he said. ""I understand part of the reason for that — obviously, we don't want people publishing how this thing works in great detail so hackers get the guidebook as it were. But as regulators, as people interested in financial stability, we have to get more assurance that they are meeting the levels of resilience that we need.""Policymakers also have concerns about the relative lack of competition in the market. ""As the market becomes more concentrated on a small number of suppliers, those suppliers can exercise market power, not only in price but also of the terms,"" Bailey said. ""That is where we do have a concern and do have to look carefully because that concentrated power on terms can manifest itself in the form of secrecy, opacity, not providing customers with the information they need to be able to monitor the risk in the service. We have seen some of that going on. Frankly we'll have to roll some of that back."""

No point in selling your shares unless u really need money
What a beautiful day for GOOGL!! Love it! Good job
"Market is tanking AH. Even $GOOGL is only up 1% from yesterday's close on supposedly blowout earnings. This bull market is very old, running on FED fumes."
"All if these inflationistas are hilarious. They’ll read one headline and run with it! Think for yourself guys, good luck betting against Google."
Only $600 spread between GOOG and AMZN now. I think GOOG will overtake it soon.
"GOOG bounced $55/share from its low of the day. Quite an impressive recovery today, closing in the green."
STRONG BUY
And up nicely after hours...who could ask for more?
TIME TO BUY!!!!!
Folks reversion to the mean will happen soon. SOLD my GOOG today as I believe Jackson Hole and interest rates will rise hurting the growth stocks in the shorter term. Prepare for pullback to the 200DMA at $2200.
Let’s be honest here. Are you really buying google here at this price? Of course it’s worth more but overextended much? No dips? What’s the next catalyst to bring this lower? Will it even touch the 20 sma? Or the 50 sma? Things are looking desperate and tired out here. Since I sold at $3750 it’s been there twice and sold off. Are you gonna let the whales bring this lower while you wait to reach new highs?
—This is the one stock I’ll probably own for another 5-10 years…
My 5 shares I bought at $900 are doing well - LOL
Buy buy more GOOGL and GOOG tomorrow. Tomorrow all day long should be beautiful green

incredible bull run this week goog! thank you!
A very nice serious buying pop with volume there towards the end of trading.
Alphabet board authorized repurchase of Class A (in additon to existing class C authorization). look for GOOG and GOOGL to reach parity real soon! A free 3% gain for those that took advantage of the GOOG vs GOOGL arbitrage... only free if in a tax deferred account...
"Pull up any GOOGL chart you want. 6 mos, 1 yr, 5 yr. That's an arc of beauty. Do people think this company will ever stop printing money from ad revenue? Long term hold."
I am just really impressed by Alphabet’s numbers. This is just incredible…The stock deserves a huge re-rating!

Hello Alphabet Inc 
GOOG/GOOGL LONGS
What is the diff between goog and googl
LONGS profits on auto-pilot. JUST SIT BACK AND RELAX
"The share repurchase program has been modified. See the quarterly report. (Search Edgar SEC filings.) Google can now purchase both Class A shares (GOOGL), as well as Class C shares (GOOG). I don't see any real reason why the price discrepancy should persist, between those two share classes. In the overnight trading, the price discrepancy (over $100 yesterday) has already shrunk 60% and now sits at only $40. If you own Google Class C shares (GOOG), and if you are nimble, and can get a trade on EARLY EARLY EARLY, then sell those shares and buy the Class A instead. You may make $20 or so without any effort. From the quarterly report...In July 2020, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $28.0 billion of its Class C capital stock, which was completed during the second quarter of 2021. In April 2021, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional $50.0 billion of its Class C capital stock. In July 2021, the Alphabet board approved an amendment to the April 2021 authorization, permitting the company to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. As of June 30, 2021, $43.5 billion remains available for repurchase. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date."
"EVEN WITH TODAY’S MOVE UP, THOSE AUGUST 20th & SEPTEMBER 17th CALLS ARE STILL ON DISCOUNT. I Was hoping for another dip to add to what I have, but I knew those calls would cost a lot more today."
Say hello to $3000 Bby next earnings and then $3500 before EOY
Would it be smart to buy some shares before earnings or wait until afterwards?
When will this stock split next?
Yeesh... Both Call and Put buyers going to get hammered tomorrow at this rate
If a company beats earnings a straight year expect a rising & beat price target as well OBVIOUSLY! GOOGL TO THE MOON!
Fulfilling your promise today in spades!
So shouldn't GOOGL be higher with both buyback and voting rights? or they buyback more GOOG shares?

"Google is the world's largest surveillance company. Just because they got away with their shady business practices the last decade doesn't mean they can continue for another decade. Just trade, DON'T own it!"
Patience is required for the share price to reflect the blowout earnings but longs know that.
"Morgan Stanley reported on their 13/F a 3,000,000 + shares entry into GOOGL in the past 10 days !!!!!!"
"Of course google has been an incredible investment over the long-term, but where does it go from here? The company is worth nearly 2 trillion dollars, to double again it would be worth $4 trillion. I wonder at what point the total valuation of the company becomes a hindrance to additional appreciation? If Google doubled 2 more times over the next decade it would be worth $8T which is 1/3 our current GDP."
Googl to the moon!
Why this up 3% and other Google is barely up
Only a $400 gap between GOOG and AMZN...it used to be $800..shows GOOG's strength
GOOG may surpass AMZN..AMZN missed earnings and guidance and was down 175 after hours
ATH knocking at the door
Changing lawyers in midstream doesn’t bid well for google. That’s pretty obvious. They should just cut their losses and move on. We’re talking about the highest patent infringement payout of all time here.

"Google profiting from bitcoin scams using fake newspaper adverts, campaigners sayGoogle has been accused of failing to act for months against cryptocurrency scams using fake articles purporting to be published by a national newspaper.Campaigners said the search giant had not stopped fraudsters from advertising non-existent investments in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, despite repeated warnings about the scams.One advert, which showed up at the top of the page when users search Google for investment-related queries, links to a fake Daily Mirror article, claiming to be an interview with Britain's youngest millionaire detailing how he made his fortune.The headline reads: ""Brit shocked everyone by revealing the app which makes him £23k a month."" When users click though they are taken to a site which promises they can earn millions by using an algorithm that automatically trades crypto markets.The ad uses a screenshot of Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby conducting an interview on This Morning.Celebrity images are routinely being used by scammers to attempt to give unsuspecting consumers false reassurance that adverts can be trusted.Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, has issued warnings after his face was used in fake adverts on Facebook claiming to offer risky binary trading, PPI reclaim services and bitcoin.BBC consumer finance journalist Paul Lewis tweeted last month that he had seen his face in fake news articles about cryptocurrencies which appeared on Yahoo search results.He wrote: ""I have never bought cryptocurrency and advise everyone against doing so. You can lose all your money.""Mark Taber, a campaigner against online fraud, said he had repeatedly reported the Mirror fake scam to Google.He has also reported hundreds of other scams to the Financial Conduct Authority so far this year but says the regulator has only acted to warn consumers in a small minority of cases and when it has done so it has acted too late.""This fake Mirror article bitcoin scam using Holly Willoughby has been ever present on Google Ads for months,” Mr Taber said.""I have reported it repeatedly but no effective action has been taken to stop it from reappearing time after time. This suggests Google is unwilling to enforce its own policies."""

"Extremely Point by Point Video Well I will also say this here, Most people don't understand the concept of ""buying the dip"" just has the current markets is down. Holding is great, although trading is far more profitable. I was able to grasp the knowledge of trading crypto assets early enough, but I was still limited due to my lack of technical under standing of how to analyze the digital market, all that changed when I encountered Mrs Mellisa_scott services, I must confess it was easier to understand with the assistance of Mellisa_scott , she is always one step ahead of other traders, she fully monitored all my trades to avoid making me mistakes and losing my funds. My earnings has increased from 2 BTC to 19 BTC in just 11 weeks and some days. I have full confidence in her trading abilities, Mrs mellisa_scott can be reached the On Telegram (@ Mellisa_scott) be guided."

Which to buy? GOOG or GOOGL?
"As is well known on this board, Google management has approved the buyback for Class A in addition to the Class C shares. Google now has the right to purchase either depending on the ""best interests of the company"". It is impossible to say what ""in the best interests of the company"" means. Class C shares are settling in a bit higher than the Class A shares. I think this is correct. Google will continue to favor Class C shares, at least a little bit. They pay their employees using Class C shares. It will take some time to determine the new ""proper"" spread between the two share classes. Management, of course, won't give us a lot of details. Mr Market has to figure it out the hard way based on buying pressure on each share class."

"I've invested in GOOG for the last 15 years or so - usually expressed through options but also via the common at times. I loved their ""do no evil"" motto. Wow, those days are long gone. The company is now more powerful than the robber barons of 100 years ago, but that by itself isn't a ""problem"". The problem is that Google has now clearly become evil. Never in all of history have the censors and book-burners been the ""good guys"". They probably truly believe they aren't being evil --- but they ARE now evil. Shutting down opinions of actual Doctors and scientists that don't happen agree with the establishment is unfathomable. Diversity of opinions is the way the scientific method and a free society hashing through ideas is supposed to work. The youTube approach is the height of arrogance. So I'm done - even if I happen to leave money on the table, I'll sleep better not being invested in evil. Facebook and Amazon are also now off limits for me. Apple is getting close. Sigh."

"Google Is Protecting Its Financial StakesSince Google has a direct financial interest in AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 “vaccine,” is it any wonder that its subsidiaries, like YouTube, are censoring information that threatens the future profitability of these products? I would think not.More broadly, Silicon Valley has been pushing to transform the health care system as a whole into a system based on telemedicine and artificial intelligence (AI). Essentially, they’re looking to replace doctors with AI-driven apps and the like.“They’ve started to sort of reimagine health care as a way of taking control over people's lives, telling them it's for the benefit of the public, the collective, and also their personal health, whereas it's really a way to implement these transhumanist or technocratic technologies under the guise of that being a health-related venture,” Webb says.Google, of course, is intimately involved in all of this. They’re also partnered directly with the U.S. military. “So, the fact that they're censoring stuff that goes against the narrative that they want to put forth on matters relating to public health … really shouldn't surprise anyone,” Webb says."

"It appears that investors are eating up Google shares, all time highs."
"Google accused in suit of fixing ad rates with a Facebook dealNEW YORK (BLOOMBERG) - Alphabet Inc's Google is accused in an anti-trust lawsuit of giving itself the edge in online advertising by cutting a cosy deal with Facebook that gives the social network an advantage in virtual auctions that determine whose ads appear where.The deal has allowed Google to retain its dominance in online advertising, while keeping other advertisers on the sidelines and limiting revenue for online publishers, two Massachusetts companies claimed in a proposed class-action lawsuit.A so-called header bidding system devised in 2014 enabled publishers to direct a user's browser to solicit real-time bids from multiple exchanges, not just Google's, according to the complaint.Facebook initially embraced the system, but as part of a 2018 deal with Google, it agreed to limit its programme in return for preferential treatment in Google's ad business, the Massachusetts companies claimed in the complaint, filed on Tuesday (Aug 3) in San Francisco federal court.""When Google's market power was threatened, it cut off innovation and competition through an agreement with Facebook,"" the companies said.Their agreement ""restricted the innovation of header bidding to their benefit and in direct hindrance of competition"" and violates federal anti-trust law, according to the complaint.Google is responsible for all damages advertisers suffered, the Massachusetts companies said."

"Google has TTM EPS of $92.17, which brings their current P/E ratio to 29.7.This is an excellent earnings report and Google has a long way to run upwards over the next 3-5 years!"
"France slapped Google with a big fine over news copyright rowFrance's competition watchdog on Tuesday slapped Google with a 500-million-euro ($593-million) fine for failing to negotiate ""in good faith"" with media companies over the use of their content under EU copyright rules.It is ""the biggest ever fine"" imposed by the Competition Authority for a company's failure to adhere to one of its rulings, the agency's chief Isabelle De Silva told reporters, saying the decision was intended to ""reflect the gravity"" of Google's shortcomings.The regulator also ordered Google to present media publishers with ""an offer of renumeration for the current use of their copyrighted content"", or risk paying additional damages of up to 900,000 euros a day.The long-running legal battle has centred on claims that Google has been showing articles, pictures and videos produced by media outlets when displaying search results without adequate compensation, despite the seismic shift of global advertising revenues towards the search giant.In April 2020, the French competition authority ordered Google to negotiate ""in good faith"" with media groups after it refused to comply with a 2019 EU law governing digital copyright.The so-called ""neighbouring rights"" aim to ensure that news publishers are compensated when their work is shown on websites, search engines and social media platforms.While Google insists it has made progress on the issue, the French regulator said the company's behaviour ""indicates a deliberate, elaborate and systematic lack of respect"" for its order to negotiate in good faith.In particular, the Competition Authority rebuked Google for having failed to ""have a specific discussion"" with media companies about neighbouring rights during negotiations over its Google Showcase news service, which launched late last year.Tuesday's ruling had been keenly anticipated by news outlets across Europe, as the first decision of its kind by a regulator over the EU's neighbouring rights policy.Google is coming under increasing pressure from regulators around the world as concerns grow that media outlets will find it increasingly difficult to hold those in power to account faced with such chronic underfunding.Australia has taken one of the most aggressive positions, demanding that Google and Facebook pay media organisations when their platforms host their content or face millions of dollars in fines.The landmark legislation resulted in Google and Facebook signing deals worth millions of dollars to Australian media companies."

"The crypto market is at present encountering a bull run and a great deal of novices consider this to be an opportunity to get in on the activity, I think I'll allow others to hold the pack.

When something moons like this, grieved, you are past the point of no return. My exhort in case you are wanting to go in the crypto market is you should exchange with a savvy approach as opposed to purchasing Crypto, holding it to cause gain and afterward to get frustrated by an unavoidable accident in half a month. Over the previous year I have had the option to make more than 8.5BTC adhering to the guidelines and signs from genuine invesmentory Signal . they run program for financial backers/amateurs who need understanding on how exchanging Bitcoin functions, to assist them with using the instability of the crypto market and furthermore stack up more crypto.

"Another 52 week high. Thank you Google for making my retirement that much better not to mention my e-mail account the maps on my Pixel phone and let us not forget the search engine. Love you, Kol"
The ideal point is dropping to around $2700.Tomorrow could drive to $3000 hitting 10%+
Just YouTube's revenue is almost more than Netflix now  
a google stock split would be great
"Strong, with $50B buyback of GOOGL shares this will continue the small but steady incline into next earnings."
Which is more productive: bashing or profiting?
"If the bears on here think Sonos winning a lawsuit against GOOGL means the beginning of the end, somebody is going to have to explain why the stock price has continued to rally higher, not lower. There's a simple answer...it is going to take a lot more than one lawsuit to bring down GOOGL. The bears on here are betting on all the dominos falling when the truth is most of the lawsuits are years away from being settled and GOOGL has high powered lawyers fighting in its favor. GOOGL has an undeniable moat, is the best search engine out there, owns Youtube, Google maps is by far and away the best navigation system to use, and that's only scratching the surface. When one looks at the amount of cash, free cash flow, return on assets, return on equity, and return on invested capital, and the very small percentage of debt, and the fact they likely will ramp up share repurchases with their enormous cash pile, somebody like SONOS is nothing more than a fly. So I expect to get thumbs downed like usual but one thing is apparent. All these FAANG haters are just mad they didn't get in when they had the chance like I did in 2013, and their hopes of making serious money and talking this stock down to try and scare away new investors is smoke and mirrors. You can hate GOOGL for ethical reasons, but to hate it as an investment requires a hatred of getting rich. I have yet to meet one person in my life that doesn't want more money."
Lots of room for growth: they can easily cram 5-10 more advertisements in a 8 minute YouTube video
Fantastic stock .I'll say no more.
I like it when Google goes up and up. They're powered by Netlist and soon will be writing a LARGE check to them for their technology that was never paid for. Go Google.
"Should easily see $3500-$4000, then we should get another stock split, IF NOT SOONER "

Volume difference between googl and goog today very large. Googl is the stronger buy
Blowout earnings will propel GOOG to 2800 shortly.
"Google vs Netlist: Well over a 10 year period of litigations seem to be coming to a close. A judge has put next July as the date where a jury will say a veredict. Interested parties are calculating an earlier friendly settlement btw both parties but if an agreement was not possible, the caluculations of a settlement could be huge from $10b. to 100billion."
When Alphabet formed the different classes they promised they would trade very closely in proximity one to the other. I can’t remember the exact formula but it is probably somewhere in the prospectus. Class A being the voting shares and Class C being non-voting shares. There is also a Class B which does not trade publicly but retained by the owners. I think what occurred today is that management leveled the playing field and actually trimmed it allocation of GOOG shares to put it within a few dollars of GOOGL shares by EOD to fulfill its promise. At least that’s one theory as to why we sold off.
GOOGL flying 1st class today.
"Wow, i thought beating earnings by 10 % would be huge, but beating earnings by more than 41% i am speechless, this is crushing the estimates like no one else did. And more important the outlook also excellent."

Google is undervalued anywhere under $3000
"Samsung’s App Store Led to Antitrust Lawsuit Against GoogleGoogle used anticompetitive practices in an attempt to “preemptively quash” Samsung’s Galaxy Store, and prevent it from becoming a viable competitor to its own Play Store. That’s according to an antitrust lawsuit filed by a coalition of three dozen state attorney general, which accuses Google of illegally attempting to control app distribution on Android. The suit also alleges Google paid off app developers to stop them circumventing its store.The allegations challenge one of Google’s core defenses of its policies, which is that unlike Apple’s iOS rules, Android allows both competing app stores and side-loading apps directly. The lawsuit is effectively claiming that this openness is a facade, because while customers technically have the choice of where to get their apps from, Google’s business practices have prevented a viable app store competitor from emerging.“Google felt deeply threatened when Samsung began to revamp its own app store”“Google felt deeply threatened when Samsung began to revamp its own app store, the Samsung Galaxy Store,” the suit says, and describes Google’s approach to the competing store as “a threat it needed to preemptively quash.”The suit outlines a range of tactics Google allegedly used to prevent Samsung’s store from becoming a viable competitor. It claims Google used revenue share agreements with Android phone manufacturers that “outright prohibited” pre-installing some other app stores, and that it made “a direct attempt to pay Samsung to abandon relationships with top developers and scale back competition through the Samsung Galaxy Store.”As well as attempting to nullify Samsung’s store directly, the attorneys general claim that Google worked with app developers to encourage them not to distribute their apps outside of the Play Store, effectively paying them off while imposing restrictions about how they distribute their apps. In a heavily redacted section of the filing, the AGs argue that much of Google’s response came “as a direct consequence” of Epic Games choosing to distribute Fortnite outside of the Google Play Store. “To Google, competition in app distribution is a virus to be eliminated,” the suit says."

"Right after the opening, Google in a constant trend drifting down. It even has lost over 5 points in after hour trading. This does not show usual strength but rather weakness."
cloud growth accelerated to 53% WOW
$2800 this week possible..
Googl should announce a special $100 dividend so those of us that want to buy more shares can do so. They don’t even need 10% of the money that they have on the books.
Let's hope for a nice rebound this week. We have a great company behind us.

"Norway urging EU and US to ban Google and Facebook’s surveillance based advertisingThe Norwegian Consumer Council published a report calling for a ban on surveillance-based ads. In solidarity, we the undersigned have sent the following letter on Wednesday, July 7th, to EU and US regulators to encourage them to take action during legislative sessions and any relevant privacy discussions.TIME TO BAN SURVEILLANCE-BASED ADVERTISINGSurveillance-based advertising permeates the internet today, creating a number of highly problematic issues for both consumers and businesses. On June 23, a broad coalition of consumer rights organizations, civil rights groups, NGOs, as well as academics, researchers, privacy experts, and enthusiasts – all concerned individuals – called on regulators to stop the invasive and privacy-hostile practices related to surveillance-based advertising.In the EU, they urged regulators to consider a ban on surveillance-based advertising as a part of the Digital Services Act. In the U.S., they urged legislators to enact comprehensive privacy legislation. We are a group of businesses who write to you today to show our support to this initiative. We represent small, medium, and large businesses who all believe – and demonstrate on a daily basis – that it is possible to run profitable companies without exploiting the privacy of individuals.In addition to the clear privacy issues caused by surveillance-based advertising, it is also detrimental to the business landscape.In the surveillance-based advertising model, a few actors can obtain competitive advantages by collecting data from across websites and services and dominant platform actors can abuse their positions by giving preference to their own services.These practices seriously undermine competition and take revenue away from content creators. Anti-competitive behavior and effects serve to entrench dominant actors’ positions while complex supply chains and ineffective technologies lead to lost revenues for advertisers and publishers.It is also difficult for consumers to distinguish between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ actors in the digital sphere, which means that legitimate actors, amongst them many small and medium-sized enterprises, are directly affected by the actions of unscrupulous companies.This harms consumers and businesses and can undermine the cornerstones of democracy. Although we recognize that advertising is an important source of revenue for content creators and publishers online, this does not justify the massive commercial surveillance systems set up in attempts to “show the right ad to the right people”.Other forms of advertising technologies exist, which do not depend on spying on consumers, and alternative models can be implemented without significantly affecting revenue. On the contrary – and that we can attest to – businesses can thrive without privacy-invasive practices.We encourage you to take a stand and ban surveillance-based advertising."
"Looks like inflation is indeed transitory. That's very good news for mega cap growth stocks, and GOOGL has the most compelling valuation among FAAMG, may hit 2760 and beyond today. We'll see. JMHO"

I usually avoid too many eggs in one basket, but am violating the basic rules of diversification. Long-timers, Opinions or your own current approach based on this amazing runup? Thanks"
GOOG resting after a great week and poised for another one.
BUYING THE GOOG/GOOGL DIPS is like receiving free money lol!JUST TOO EASY!
Its the share buyback that Im excited about. It will narrow the price difference between GOOG and GOOGL.Share buybacks are the most tax efficient way to give shareholders a dividend by decreasing the number of outstanding shares. I really should not be surprised that Alphabet knows what it's doing.
the last red candle was from 2920. to 2900. someone got out on a hurry. bought some puts right after that.
This has been quite the run since the beginning of 2020 :)
ABSOLUTELY NO FEAR ON DIPS 
"When the news is good and the stock reaction isn't, you know the bull market is ending."
Cut through all the negativity here and track GOOG's progress instead.
I'm laying out my Google prayer rug and giving thanks to the all mighty Google.....again.
First time buyer.. 10% of my portfolio. I’m LONG. I’m just hoping to get 15% per year.

Plus from before earnings hughs to after earnings rn the price is only up by like 45 dollars. Not much from the great earnings can see this hit 2800 eow and push higher next week
"guys this earnings season is such a manipulated sell off no matter what stop getting excited for tomorrow when google beats earnings, it's set for long term not tomorrow lmao."
"EU Orders Google To Come Clean On How It's Ranking Your Flight And Hotel Search ResultsGoogle is once again in hot water with the European Union (EU). This time around, the United States-based search giant has run afoul of the EU's consumer protection and antitrust regulations with regards to how it present search results for hotels and airline flightsAt the heart of the issues are search results for Google Flight and Google Hotels. According to EU regulatory bodies, Google does not do enough to allow consumers to make informed decisions on travel arrangements. More specifically, Google leaves out details such as any applicable taxes or fees, which could substantially raise the cost of flights or lodging. Google has the ability to display this information in its search results, which is why the EU is pouncing at this time.""EU consumers cannot be misled when using search engines to plan their holidays. We need to empower consumers to make their choices based on transparent and unbiased information,"" said EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders, according to Reuters.Google could be subject to sanctions and other penalties if it does not comply with EU guidelines, which the company is already very familiar with these days. For example, antitrust regulators in France smacked Google with a $593 million fine earlier this month for not reaching an agreement on news aggregation for local publishers.The search giant hasn't been able to escape scrutiny here at home either. Google is facing a lawsuit from Epic Games over its Play Store policies. In addition, Google was accused of conspiring with Facebook on the digital advertising front using a backroom deal codenamed Jedi Blue.Perhaps most troubling for Google is the antitrust lawsuit filed against the company in October by the U.S. Department of Justice. The lawsuit alleges that Google ""stifled competition"" with its online search and advertising businesses. At the time, then-Attorney General William Barr said that ""competition in this industry is vitally important"" and that ""this lawsuit strikes at the heart of Google's grip over the internet for millions of American consumers, advertisers, small businesses and entrepreneurs beholden to an unlawful monopolist."""

"White House sees YouTube, Facebook as 'Judge, Jury & Executioner' on vaccine misinformationWASHINGTON, July 23 (Reuters) - The White House has YouTube, not just Facebook, on its list of social media platforms officials say are responsible for an alarming spread of misinformation about COVID vaccines and are not doing enough to stop it, sources familiar with the administration's thinking said.The criticism comes just a week after called Facebook and other social media companies ""killers"" for failing to slow the spread of misinformation about vaccines.A senior administration official said one of the key problems is ""inconsistent enforcement."" YouTube - a unit of Alphabet Inc's Google - and Facebook get to decide what qualifies as misinformation on their platforms. But the results have left the White House unhappy.""Facebook and YouTube... are the judge, the jury and the executioner when it comes to what is going on in their platforms,"" an administration official said, describing their approach to COVID misinformation. ""They get to grade their own homework.""Social media companies have come under fire recently from President, his press secretary, Jen Psaki, and Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, who have all said the spread of lies about vaccines is making it harder to fight the pandemic and save lives.A recent report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), which has also been highlighted by the White House, showed 12 anti-vaccine accounts are spreading nearly two-thirds of anti-vaccine misinformation online. Six of those accounts are still posting on YouTube.The fight against vaccine misinformation has become a top priority for the White House at a time when the pace of vaccinations has slowed considerably despite the risk posed by the Delta variant, with people in many parts of the country hostile to being vaccinated.The requests to Facebook and YouTube come after the White House reached out to Facebook, Twitter and Google in February about clamping down on COVID misinformation, seeking their help to stop it from going viral, another senior administration official said then.""Facebook is the 800-pound gorilla in the room when it comes to vaccine misinformation... but Google has a lot to answer for and somehow manages to get away with it always because people forget they own YouTube,"" said Imran Ahmed, CCDH founder and chief executive.The senior administration official cited four issues on which the administration has asked Facebook to provide specific data, but the company has been reticent to comply.These include how much vaccine misinformation exists on its platform, who is seeing the inaccurate claims, what the company is doing to reach out to them and how does Facebook know the steps it is taking are working.The White House’s broad concern is that the platforms are ""either lying to us and hiding the ball, or they're not taking it seriously and there isn't a deep analysis of what's going on in their platforms,"" the official said."

"It appears google may have conspired with Samsung and the other big semiconductor conpanies to drive Netlist, an American semiconductor out of business.
