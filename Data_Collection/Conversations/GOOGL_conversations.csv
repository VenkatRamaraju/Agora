LONGS profits on auto-pilot. JUST SIT BACK AND RELAX

Headed to $3000 today…
"I just wanted to let you GOOGL shareholders know what $2900 tastes like; It's incredible - creamy, decadent, oh so nice. One day soon you will have a taste!"
holding forever the stock that always gives back
$400 gap between GOOG and AMZN and closing fast..good going GOOG!
Profiting as we speak: thanks GOOG!
Only a $400 gap between GOOG and AMZN...it used to be $800..shows GOOG's strength
"Of course google has been an incredible investment over the long-term, but where does it go from here? The company is worth nearly 2 trillion dollars, to double again it would be worth $4 trillion. I wonder at what point the total valuation of the company becomes a hindrance to additional appreciation? If Google doubled 2 more times over the next decade it would be worth $8T which is 1/3 our current GDP."
People keep saying that Google steals everything and has nothing original yet has a huge stock value. Is there anything they own that isn't stolen?
BUYING THE GOOG/GOOGL DIPS is like receiving free money lol!JUST TOO EASY!
"Right after the opening, Google in a constant trend drifting down. It even has lost over 5 points in after hour trading. This does not show usual strength but rather weakness."

"What will happen to GOOG stock when Pixel phones, speakers and other home products get banned from market for ripping off Sonos?"
"Google vs Netlist: Well over a 10 year period of litigations seem to be coming to a close. A judge has put next July as the date where a jury will say a veredict. Interested parties are calculating an earlier friendly settlement btw both parties but if an agreement was not possible, the caluculations of a settlement could be huge from $10b. to 100billion."
This stock is just a 'winner'. With its on-line power in advertising this stock will just keep going higher andhigher. The FAANG stocks should be in everyone's portfolio. They are all SUPER stocks!
UP 160% from the 2020 low...WOW! Going much higher. Will challenge AAPL mkt. cap soon.
"Morgan Stanley reported buying on their 13/F a number of 3,000,000 + shares into GOOGL in the past 10 days !!!!!! Go check out Fintel."
"Long since $890. Any of you long-timer Google shareholders taken any chips off the table yet? $3,000-$3,200 seems prudent, but I thought the same back at $2,000 and am still holding 100%. I usually avoid too many eggs in one basket, but am violating the basic rules of diversification. Long-timers, Opinions or your own current approach based on this amazing runup? Thanks"
GOOG/GOOGL LONGS
That escalated quickly
Fantastic stock .I'll say no more.
"If the bears on here think Sonos winning a lawsuit against GOOGL means the beginning of the end, somebody is going to have to explain why the stock price has continued to rally higher, not lower. There's a simple answer...it is going to take a lot more than one lawsuit to bring down GOOGL. The bears on here are betting on all the dominos falling when the truth is most of the lawsuits are years away from being settled and GOOGL has high powered lawyers fighting in its favor. GOOGL has an undeniable moat, is the best search engine out there, owns Youtube, Google maps is by far and away the best navigation system to use, and that's only scratching the surface. When one looks at the amount of cash, free cash flow, return on assets, return on equity, and return on invested capital, and the very small percentage of debt, and the fact they likely will ramp up share repurchases with their enormous cash pile, somebody like SONOS is nothing more than a fly. So I expect to get thumbs downed like usual but one thing is apparent. All these FAANG haters are just mad they didn't get in when they had the chance like I did in 2013, and their hopes of making serious money and talking this stock down to try and scare away new investors is smoke and mirrors. You can hate GOOGL for ethical reasons, but to hate it as an investment requires a hatred of getting rich. I have yet to meet one person in my life that doesn't want more money."
Congratulations to all long-time shareholders of Google common stock.
"Just getting out my Google prayer rug, point it to the north east (Google campus) and thanking the Google gods for another record high. uhmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"
"3,000 this week? it's possible!"
Is anyone concerned about this article from Forbes?“Why You Suddenly Need To Delete Google Chrome”
Folks reversion to the mean will happen soon. SOLD my GOOG today as I believe Jackson Hole and interest rates will rise hurting the growth stocks in the shorter term. Prepare for pullback to the 200DMA at $2200.
When it gets to 3500$ then we can talk about it being expensive at this price FWD PE IS 27 that’s not bad considering this is still a growth behemoth.
Does Google require NVDA anymore or is Google manufacturing their own chips for the future?
Close/Open in the green or in the red. Doesn’t matter to longs. Weak dips do nothing. GOOG/GOOGL will continue higher. 
"Superb, indomitable investment!"
