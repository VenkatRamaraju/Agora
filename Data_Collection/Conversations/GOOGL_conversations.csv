You are dealing with a world-class company that has no real competition. Time will be kind to GOOG holders.
I am thinking about investing in Alphabet/GOOG but wanted to know if they have stolen any good ideas from other companies to make the stock go up?
"Hugh Barnard, new target price of $3700.00per share for GOOG!"
"Brad Cox, has target price of$3,300.00 per share of GOOG!"
Started my position on this today. Good discount.
HAHA money managers can't hold anymore they need to lock in gains. See you $1000 points down at $1800
"Don't buy GOOG, buy GOOGL. This is good like the other FAANGS"
Has GOOG every paid a dividend ?
Stock split and earnings beat coming up. Cresting $3000 before EOY.
looks like looking at another dip...i wonder if people will bail in large enough numbers here...seems overdone
Republican or Democrat or Independent: we all want a robust stock market with minimal financial or societal disruption. Time to stop the bickering and vote for consensus-building politicians.
"AMEN! $4,800 price target!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-alphabet-inc-nasdaq-122102180.html"
GOOG and MSFT: your home run ticket.
Next target: 2850
"Realistically by what date will GOOG surpass $3,000/share?"
Moody's says stock market will flash crash 33% if Congress fails to raise debt limit and allows America to go into default. They are playing insane politics with fire.
At what price you'll sell google?
"CNBC guest warned this afternoon of upcoming 7 years of negative returns in the USA stock market. Long GOOG, getting hammered."

Think forward: where will GOOG be at year's end? over 3000
"Google, YouTube will benefit from Facebook Exodus, Record Add Growth for YouTube"
Why did it go up?? It was down to 2830…
Next stop: GOOG entering quantum technology to prevent hacking will liaise with govt in this effort.

"Google, MSFT, Apple and Amazon will all be $10 Trillion companies in 10 to 15 years......."
this looks like it just wants to go to 3000 already but just being shy about it
Long-timer GOOG shareholder here. Got to love these Netlist type investors/posters who post on the Google stock message boards proclaiming to have achieved millionaire status by investing in companies that file lawsuits against Google. They should be thanking Google's existence for making them $$$. I am always thankful to Google regardless of the stock market ups and downs. Long 500 shares heading into another quarterly earnings beat.
"$100 oil and 2% interest rates will destroy the stock market. Too much, too fast. Fed chairman Powell will be the fall guy as the Administration will pretend their policies had nothing to do with inflation."
Only need $210/share to get back to where we were one month ago. 
Up  or Down  Close today for GOOG ? Opinions appreciated as well.
Hold it forever and leave to my grandsons
No news at all but still it’s declining for days
Many interesting prospects coming up yet this is getting clobbered. Victim of a broader level sell off
"Australian regulator aims to rein in Google's advertising powerSYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's antitrust regulator said on Tuesday it needed more powers to combat significant competition concerns in advertising technology, a market dominated by Alphabet Inc unit Google.The stance could set up another clash between policymakers and the U.S. search engine leader after the same regulator helped design reforms implemented this year to force tech giants to pay for media content displayed on their platforms.Advertising technology, or ad tech, refers to services that facilitate transactions to buy and sell online advertising space and that determine which ads are shown to consumers.They involve the automated use of algorithms that result in an image or video - including banners and pop-ups - appearing with online content.Businesses rely on those services to reach prospective customers while news publishers use ad tech to generate revenue and fund their online content.MARKET DOMINANCEThe report found that Google has a dominant position in the ad tech supply chain in Australia and estimates that more than 90% of ad clicks passed through at least one Google service in 2020.The ACCC also found that Google used its market position to preference its own services and protect them from competition.For example, Google prevents rival ad tech services accessing ads on its popular video streaming service YouTube, the regulator said.The inefficient industry is likely harming publishers, advertisers and consumers, the regulator said, via higher ad tech fees and, ultimately, higher costs to customers.TRANSPARENCY CONCERNSThe regulator said Google accesses large volumes of data through its customer-facing services, such as its search engine and map service. It said it was unclear the extent to which Google uses this data to help its ad tech businesses, creating a transparency issue.The ACCC found that ad tech pricing was also unclear and it said the complexity of the supply chain made it difficult for advertisers and publishers to detect misconduct.NEXT STEPSThe ACCC wants Google to make it clear how it uses its data to sell its services. It also recommends rules be considered to manage conflicts of interest, prevent self-preferencing, and ensure rival ad tech providers can compete.It has recommended the industry publish average ad tech fees to help customers compare costs.The Australian government said it would now consider the report's findings.The mechanisms required to reform the sector, including potential new powers for the regulator, will be considered as part of a broader ACCC report due in Sept. 2022. Consultations with Google and others are set to start early next year.The regulator said it was also in contact with its international counterparts. European and U.S. regulators are also scrutinizing Google's advertising business."
"Dems push for federal probe of alleged ad collusion between Google and FacebookFour Democratic members of Congress are calling for an investigation into whether an alleged secret 2018 agreement between Google and Facebook concerning digital advertising violated federal antitrust law. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) and Mondaire Jones (D-NY) wrote a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and Acting US Attorney General Nicholas Ganjei of Texas asking them to determine whether federal charges might be warranted.“If the reports are accurate, the behavior appears to be a clear violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act (Sherman Act), which criminalizes “mak[ing] any contract” “in restraint of trade or commerce,” the letter states.Attorneys General in ten states filed suit against Google in December over a program reportedly nicknamed “Jedi Blue,” according to an unredacted draft version viewed by the Wall Street Journal. The Texas attorney general’s office led the suit, alleging that Facebook and Google worked to sabotage “header bidding,” which allows advertisers, including competitors, to bypass Google’s ad auctions. Google “repeatedly used its monopolistic power to control pricing,” according to the complaint.The Jedi Blue agreement allegedly guaranteed that Facebook would receive a fixed percentage of advertising bids on Google. In return, Facebook agreed to curtail its involvement with header bidding in ad auctions, the complaint states.In February, the parent company of a West Virginia newspaper chain filed an antitrust suit against the two companies, alleging that they were siphoning digital ad revenue away from news organizations. HD Media alleged in its complaint that the Jedi Blue agreement was an illegal quid pro quo.Now the members of Congress want the Justice Department to investigate whether Google and Facebook should be subject to sanctions, including possible criminal penalties.The Jedi Blue deal amounts to bid rigging, the letter suggests, in violation of the Sherman Act which states that a “contract … or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce … is declared to be illegal.” Criminal penalties could range up to $100 million for a company found in violation and up to $1 million in fines and ten years in prison if an individual is found guilty."
I am down $200 a share! This is so depressing!
GOOG/GOOGL IS THE BEST. Time to enjoy the weekend

I think it’ll keep correcting or stay flat for a bit as it’s run very high very fast"
DISCOUNT CALL BUYERS CONTINUE TO CELEBRATE 
Is this the dip I have been waiting to get back in?

"Finally a real market dip worth adding to positions of $GOOG, $AMZN, $MSFT, and $NVDA."
all I'm waiting for is for a stock split
"I think goog is one of the safest investments out there. However for the first time in a while they have a legit headwind due to supply chain issues. AdAge just ran a feature on this. Basically, companies don't have enough product to sell right now so doesn't make sense to spend on advertisement. So upcoming holiday season will not be what it normally is. So if you make widgets and you normally spend a lot this time of year to promote your products and drive sales during busy retail time of year, there isn't as much incentive to spend on ads sales when you already know you are going to sell everything you have in inventory anyways. With inventories so limited there is no reason to spend on ad sales. Makes sense. will hurt FB and other online advertisers too."
Localzz Network - The next search and browse site for businesses?
still waiting for that stock split
"Looks like funds may dump all stocks today to trigger a chain reaction cliff fall, so they can buy in at lower prices."
GOOG is a great stock: look at its historical price trajectory.
"135 billion cash Huge potential Market leaderHigh analyst PTSimply, Google is the best investment for now!"
I bought years ago @ $400. Alphabet is solid. And has continued and will continue to be. If you buy now it is likely to be worth more in five years. Patience.
"To many, knowing when to buy and dump stocks is a superpower. They can’t help but to follow speculations and emotions. The thing is, there are too many strategies out there and one gets confused which really works.

"With Dr Dementia as president, it’s amazing we’re not down 40%."
In the earnings date google will pass the 3300. Termination of shorts will be like this
Do you guys think this stock is still a good dca for the long term starting at these prices? Thinking like 10-15 years
Bought more today and will continue to do so on any weakness. Many will run to the safety of these quality names when they see their portfolios cratering thanks to heavy investment in spec stocks.
Isn't Google inflation proof? Why is it tanking?
ALL THE DOCUMENT TELLS ME IS THAT NETLIST IS BACK PEDDLING CHANGING THEIR STATEMENTS FOR THE COURTS WHILE $googl is not..... that’s how it looks anyway and after so much time??? They must be losing the battle cuz this to me is similar like recanting a statement but instead using the word “amend” if they are only amending something early into the case than this case couldLonger on for several more years! Have fun holding that bag! Am I wrong change my mind
"For the next leg up or down, the key question is whether or not Google will beat revenue and net earnings estimates and provide strong forward guidance."
GOOG haters: find another investment and do yourselves a favor!
"Management should initiate aShare Buy Back Program.Warren Grange, the economist hasa valuation of $3400.00 per shareat current EPS."
Great to have more analysts making sense on the rating of google.
not a bad day to pick up a few shares
3500 soon
$SPY here's my question for shorts. U thought $GOOGL $AMZN $FB $MSFT could all close an average of almost 4% & not BOUNCE the very next day?
"Netlist message board pump posters claim their stock is going from $5/share to $1,000/share after cleaning out Google from infringement litigation. Reality is the largest infringement settlement was $5Billion on a much stronger lawsuit case. Those same posters continue showing up on this board out of envy and jealousy. .... I bought a few of their shares for fun, but they won't buy our winner Google. They simply hang around and bash Google and its appreciative rewarded shareholders."
September is a good month to add shares of GOOGL
"Serious question, but why would a Chinese asset sell-off affect Google (and, say, Facebook) at all? If anything, I could see a ""rebalancing"" INTO these names, after the air/money clears."
"Just remember, the faster the fall, the quicker the bounce back! Great time to pick up the hard hit like $GOOG, $AMZN, $MSFT, $NVDA, $SHOP, $ADBE, $ASML, $PYPL, $LRCX, $KLAC."
YouTube has slightly less revenue than all of Netflix … if you break down the sun of parts there a legitimate argument to say this thing is a value play.

"Report: How surveillance giant Google tracks its employeesGoogle keeps a close eye on its employees through a number of tracking mechanisms when they engage in certain online activities, according to a new report.The tech giant zeroes in on employees who might be considering leaving out of fear they might access or leak sensitive material, according to reporting by The Information. Company security flags those workers by checking who has researched the cost of COBRA health insurance, drafted resignation letters, or searched for an internal checklist for those wanting to leave the company.Most unusually, Google's security staff has raised alarms when employees take screenshots on their work devices when running an encrypted messaging platform at the same time or use non-Google online storage services, according to the report.Google has been sued in the past year by an employee who claimed the tech giant has secretly viewed his online communications and is using it against him, and earlier this year, it terminated employees who allegedly accessed highly confidential company information.Google also captures and exploits user data in hidden and complicated methods, according to the report.Some of Google's user data even makes it into the hands of law enforcement through a database called “SensorVault,” which stores detailed user location data indefinitely. The data is so precise that one deputy police chief told the Electronic Frontier Foundation that it “shows the whole pattern of life.”"
Google had a tear In 2020.. compared to 2019 huge difference. That being said I’m being cautious here because of two reasons... rising interest rates and their issues with antitrust lawsuits.. I know they will appeal and it will takeMore time like apple but I’ve read about how googles case for a monopoly are stronger than those for apple and it’s still a “looming” issue... not saying the price targets for 3100-3400 are wrong but I don’t see it getting there until next year because of myPrevious comments... just my opinion good luck.

"Warren urges federal watchdog to investigate Google over advertising 'manipulation'Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), one of the first and most outspoken advocates for breaking up Silicon Valley giants, is calling for a federal watchdog group to investigate Google over allegations of abusive manipulations of the online ad market.Warren wrote to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) urging the investigation into Google over allegations of the company's secret program that allegedly gave its own advertising an edge over rivals by gathering bid data through its ad exchange. The allegations surrounding the program, known as ""Project Bernanke,"" were reported earlier this year based on court documents in a Texas-led antitrust case.""Given the power of a company like Google to unilaterally manipulate the online advertising market, it is critical that the CFTC ensures these new digital commodities are traded fairly and without harmful manipulation,"" Warren wrote, according to a copy of the letter shared by her office on Wednesday.It stems from a report published by The Wall Street Journal in April about Project Bernanke. The Journal's report was from documents filed in the Texas-led antitrust lawsuit that were not properly redacted when uploaded to the public docket, and a judge later let Google refile under seal.Warren said in her letter that the allegations in the reported court documents call for additional investigation from the CFTC even as state and federal regulators investigate Google over potentially anticompetitive behavior.""The activity raises additional concerns that I believe may be within the CFTC's jurisdiction and warrant close scrutiny,"" she wrote.Warren's push to involve the CFTC comes as Google faces scrutiny on many fronts.In addition to the Texas-led effort that focuses on allegations of Google stifling competition in the advertising technology market, the company is facing challenges from the Department of Justice and state attorneys general on its search market power."

How much more is googl falling? Bought at thr highest point at 2910. Its burning
GOOG has turned evil. The chutzpah to think they know better than lifelong medical professionals and decide to censor them. Never in history have the censors and book burners been the good people. They are evil.That is all.
GOOG is a forever hold...we have come to expect turbulence in the market with so much external chaos and dysfunction.

"GOOG stock started this year at a price of about 1750.00. Then interest rates ran all the way up to about 1.74% from 1.00% at the start of the year. What do you think GOOG did during that run up in rates? GOOG's stock price went to nearly 2100.00. Will it be different this time when rates go from 1.54 to 1.74 which would be a double top?, I don't think so. Rates have a lot of room to run higher before it becomes a headwind."

"S.Korea fines Google $177 mln for blocking Android customizationSEOUL, Sept 14 (Reuters) - South Korea's antitrust regulator has fined Alphabet Inc's Google 207 billion won ($176.64 million) for blocking customized versions of its Android operating system (OS), in the U.S. technology giant's second setback in the country in less than a month.The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) said on Tuesday Google's contract terms with device makers amounted to an abuse of its dominant market position that restricted competition in the mobile OS market.""The Korea Fair Trade Commission's decision is meaningful in a way that it provides an opportunity to restore future competitive pressure in the mobile OS and app market markets,"" KFTC Chairperson Joh Sung-wook said in a statement.The antitrust regulator said this could be the ninth-biggest fine it has ever imposed.KFTC said Google hampered competition by making device producers abide by an ""anti-fragmentation agreement (AFA)"" when signing key contracts with it regarding app store licenses.Under the AFA, manufacturers could not equip their handsets with modified versions of Android, known as ""Android forks"". That has helped Google cement its market dominance in the mobile OS market, the KFTC said.Under the ruling, Google is banned from forcing device makers to sign AFA contracts, allowing manufacturers to adopt modified versions of Android OS on their devices.In one instance, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd launched a smartwatch with a customized OS in 2013 but switched to a different OS after Google regarded the move as an AFA violation, KFTC said. Samsung Electronics declined to comment.The fine comes on the day that an amendment to South Korea's Telecommunications Business Act - popularly dubbed the ""anti-Google law"" - came into effect.The bill was passed in late August and it bans app store operators such as Google from requiring software developers to use their payment systems. The requirement had effectively stopped developers from charging commission on in-app purchases.Last year, India's antitrust body ordered an investigation into allegations that Google was abusing its market position to promote its payments app as well as forcing app developers to use its in-app payment system."
"Google suing India antitrust watchdog for investigation report leakNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google on Thursday said it was suing the Competition Commission of India (CCI) following the leak of a confidential CCI report into an antitrust investigation of the U.S. tech giant.The Times of India newspaper, and then Reuters, reported on Saturday that a CCI investigation had found Google abused the dominant position of its Android operating system in India, using its ""huge financial muscle"" to illegally hurt competitors.Google said last week it looked forward to working with the CCI to ""demonstrate how Android has led to more competition and innovation, not less.""In Thursday's statement the company said it had filed a legal challenge against the CCI at the Delhi High Court ""to prevent any further unlawful disclosures of confidential findings.""Google said it was ""protesting against the breach of confidence which impairs Google's ability to defend itself and harms Google and its partners.""""We cooperated fully and maintained confidentiality throughout the investigative process, and we hope and expect the same level of confidentiality from the institutions we engage with,"" its statement added.India's antitrust authority ordered a probe in 2019, saying Google appeared to have leveraged its dominance to reduce device makers' ability to opt for alternate versions of its mobile operating system and force them to pre-install Google apps.Its 750-page report subsequently found the mandatory pre-installation of apps ""amounts to imposition of unfair condition on the device manufacturers"" in violation of India's competition law.The report, which has been seen by Reuters but which is not public, also found the company leveraged the position of its Play Store app store to protect its dominance."

Quit your complaining. This is up 80% 1 year to date. Any pull back is an opportunity
Interest rates hurt the bottom line... period... when u are borrowing at the level Google does and doesn’t touch their cash on hand borrowing at almost 0 interest was the right move but with that came higher stock prices... now the inverse is happening.. 2400-2500 will be a true area to pullback to that is logical
"Just came out on Netflix: Billion Dollar Code. True story about google stealing l. P. from a start up company in Germany in the early 1990's and used the pifferaged technology to create google Earth.Check it out!google is pure evil. And WILL be stopped!Some of the profit I made on my shares of NETLIST stock have allowed me to purchase a lakefront home here in Michigan for cash two weeks ago!And the remaining shares of NETLIST will make me a millionaire, most likely a couple of times over, in the next couple months. Or years!Sell some of your google trash stocks and buy Netlist stock. They are about to go parabolic!Google is pure evil. They WILL be stopped. Our federal government, as well as other governments are beginning to call google out on their uncompetitive practices globally. Funny how you can ""google"" how Google is in the PENALTY PHASE of an over decades long lawsuit with NETLIST.Hey google management team, your day of fun in the sun is about to be greatly shadowed!!"

"Just wondering why selling off on good volume. Only reason is becouse there is some profit taking before earnings season, after good YTD run. Apple/Msft YTD performance is not good as GOOG/GOOGL so volume is lower (no profit taking?). Any thoughs?"
"NLST and WIMI are the most pumped hyped stocks on this Google message board. GOOG receives less positive posts on its own chat board. Google gets bashed daily and constantly sued and targeted. The American government targets Google. JB and Congress wants a big chunk of Google's ongoing income, so they can play Robinhood and fully implement $3.5T of socialism. If everyone would leave the Google innovation and leadership teams alone, this would become a $5,000 stock."
target raised to $3500
"RBC Capital initiated coverage with an Outstanding rating and $3,400 price target."

"Considering we are in the midst of a stock market correction, GOOG stock price held up nicely today. Let's hope this strength can continue in spite of the current ongoing political climate that is not friendly toward big business. ."
"around since 1998, and still no common stock dividend...what's that tell you??"
Businesses have no choice but to use Google Until someone else comes along they can just raise their advertising cost every year.What about YouTube? How many of us have become handymen because of it. Just think how much Home Depot is paying them every year. And then there is AI. Just buy it until the facts change
