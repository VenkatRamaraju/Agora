"I like this ER and not interested in AH reaction. The comments and the tone are positives. Frankly that is a nice surprise, and appreciate these strong numbers, especially after a less upbeat ER from Facebook. « Sales from the company’s cloud division rose to $4.99 billion, missing Wall Street expectations of $5.04 billion. While the unit has gained some market share under Thomas Kurian, it still lags far behind leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp.“It was modestly off of the street’s estimate, but we feel very good with the momentum,” Porat said on a call with reporters. “We are very pleased with the ongoing progress across the board, the product innovation, the buildout of our teams and the strength across verticals.”Alphabet also repurchased $12.6 billion in shares last quarter, and said it had added nearly 18,000 full-time staff during the period, up to 150,028. »"
"According to Ruth the apple.changes won't have a significant impact since google been working on that for a while in advance.Google services and cloud will be the area of focus in Q4, bigger than usual expenses in capex mainly for servers and infrastructure.As for the Google play fee cut won't have meaningfull impact.One thing that caught my attention was the expected ramp up in hardware sales (Fitbit and pixel 6 phone mainly)and YouTube subscriptions for Q4(Xmas)"
Sundar Pinchai is a great under-the-radar CEO..the results speak for themselves
Now Alphabet $GOOGL will have to front run $FB for $VUZI Augmented Reality.
"Looks like GOOGL is the best pick among FAAMG. It's the cheapest with a forward PE of only 26, not to mention that Waymo is about to come online. Not surprised to see 3000 very soon. JMHO"
"If supply chain issues are *allegedly* supposed to plague Google going forward, why was UPS and Ebay up so much on Friday? And why didn't other companies who produce physical goods drop as well? I'm starting to think this was just FUD being spread by the financial news complex to scare us out of our shares and calls."
"I've been constantly surprised at how GOOG seems to be ignored by talking heads and the so-called analysts in the mainstream media (including Bloomberg, which I regret subscribing to this year). It seems those people have a hard time understanding the persistent monetization power of a transformative, scalable business model. On top of that, they are pretty much at a loss about a firm not producing tangible goods but influencing people's daily lives with free apps.Congrats to wise, long-term investors who know that the 2nd wave of digital transformation (i.e., AI on the edge) is just beginning."
"This week learned us that Google is not Snap, nor is it Apple, Amazon, Facebook, ...Google (Alphabet) is Google, navigating its own course with an endless amount of assets (to name a few: Google, Youtube, Music, AI, cloud, Waymo, SpaceX shares, ...).Waymo alone has the potential to become the ""Android"" of the selfdriving market.Let's see what the future brings to Google and what Google brings to the future..."
GOOG is catching its breathe from yesterday.....$3000+ coming very very soon....
Amazon & Apple badly missing should be a strong indicator of just how great Google’s quarter was.
"Highest target $3660===no downgrades, all upgrades,...Aggressively buy any weakness!Monness Crespi analyst Brian White raised the firm's price target on Alphabet to $3,660 from $3,500 and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. The company's Q3 results were ""enviable,"" with the company managing to sidestep the digital ad pitfalls experienced by leading social media platforms, White tells investors in a research note. While the analyst believes Alphabet is well-positioned to capitalize on the strong secular trend to digital advertising and experience further momentum in the cloud, he expects that the digital ad market will remain volatile in the near-term and antitrust investigations will carry on."
"Alphabet (GOOGL) PT Raised to $3,450 at Credit Suisse"
Unfortunately I didn’t buy GOOG earlier this year. Is it too late to buy now?? Is the stock price likely to increase significantly over the next 1-2 years?
"""Do not confuse the after-hours action following the earnings report for something that it is not. Alphabet delivered a beat that simply may not have been big enough with the stock already up 60% year to date and trading nearly 5% away from its all-time high. Alphabet still has a very bright future ahead with continued growth from YouTube, Google Cloud, and digital shopping experiences leading the way."""
"Sell Amazon, BUY GOOGL. The best company on the planet"
Terrific financial results for Q3. Shows the Apple privacy isn't hurting Google at all. I am a performance marketing manager and I'm a huge believer in the workarounds Google have on user privacy.
"Giants, Michael, and other Netlist posters who bash Google daily - learn to appreciate Google and its success. Without that tremendous Google success, the netlist case would have little potential value. Google is a multi-faceted juggernaut. Netlist contentions are only a small component part of what has built Google's huge revenues sources business model."
3000 by friday. . and thats conservative Cramer said best tech stock out there
"I remember how back in 2004 I missed the $85 offering price. I then refused to buy GOOGL a week later since it price has climbed to a tad over a rich $100. ""Too expensive"" I thought. Should'a, would'a, could'a loaded up back then. Ha ha."
So is FAANG stocks called MAANG now?
This is a must own stock for the next decade. The only mistake I made in buying stock was that I did not buy more!
"Next week will surely be our week to hit the milestone of 3,000 with a century of growth ahead."
"Now that all FAANG stocks have reported, it appears GOOG is the safest to own of the group. Also wise to own Microsoft and Tesla. JMHO"

"Ignore Mr. Market. Great quarter, great company. The perfect long term hold."
"Gene Munster said on CNBC that AAPL’s new policy will hurt FB, TWTR, and SNAP but not GOOGL."
Why down today?
"When I bought at $890, Google was the analysts least favored FAANG. At $1,300s and $1,400s, same story. Now everyone wants to own. Looking forward to whenever we surpass $3,000 and never look back."
"The stock consolidated from mid Aug to mid November....technicals are now all aligned for an extended run into low $3000's... most likely $3200 before consolidating again....big, big problem here for shorts..MACD / RSI with plenty of room to the upside....today's move has pushed the MACD just over the zero line and the RSI is only sitting at 61 ...and that is with today's action....the pps has broken above the 50 day MA for the first time in almost a month ..all very bullish...look for a follow on day tomorrow of another 2%-3% and a break and hold over $3000 by Thanksgiving....it's all good"
whomever sold puts and calls on any strike price making money
"Determined to be $4000 by 2022, Load up big time."
"From TD Ameritrade News Stream, published 10/22/21 07:03PM:Earnings: Analysts on average expect Google to report earnings of 23.73 a share, up from 16.40 a share a year ago. They were expecting 20.05 a share at the end of June.Above is quoted verbatim from Jon Swarts on the TD Ameritrade News Feed. TD Ameritrade is awesome and I'd suggest anyone use it as their trading platform and news source! Unquoted Commentary:Further reading suggests Google will not be hit hard by Apple's privacy settings. As Google has made adjustments and uses a different technology than Snap. Possible headwinds to consider are a potential for lackluster holiday spending and potential anti-trust issues pushed by the US Senate. Where Google has already, willingly decreased app store cost to developers making its digital store more accessible to developers.Thank you TD Ameritrade and Jon Swartz for the awesome write up heading into earnings next week!"
