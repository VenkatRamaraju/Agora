"I love this stock.It just keeps chugging away, half a percent one day, two percent the next.No volitility, just consistent gains with a modest dividend."
Where is this after earnings?
This is a solid company. Its stores are flourishing in my area. I see more customers at them all the time and they are increasing the variety of their product line.
"Don't engage policy.......................I had a friend, who does security for where I live, tell me this story. Had 4 juveniles take their shoes off, go in and out of the store filling them with candy and soda each time. The 4th time they left because he told BOTH employees what was going on and they did NOTHING.................The guy delivering one type of soda saw it all and told him they Don't care, he sees it a lot at DG. Shrink is a BIG problem for any retail business, this is 1 of 14000 stores................ how big is the shrink corporate wide? I have NO position in this company, but I want those that do to know about this............... start asking questions why this is. I kinda understand the don't engage policy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, but there is 911 to get the police there and let them take care of it, not just let them walk out of the store with merchandise......................."
Nothing but a bump in the road ..DG is a solid investment overall...
This stock went up 60% in the crash of 2008. Great stock to own.
"Yahoo deleted all of my DG messages because i mentioned how they turned off comments on their propaganda articles during the election. You can try to censor me, but you cant take away my shares of this beautiful stock. 2021 will be a good year for Dollar general."
I lost a good paying job back in 2006. A friend recommended that I go to DG to save some money. I was embarrassed that someone would see me there. I’ve been back at work since 2008 and continue to this day to go to DG. How can you not. The savings are great. I don’t buy food there but definitely toiletries and Greeting cards and dishwater. I think this unemployment surge will bring DG long term customers
yes DG is located in some low income neighborhoods but it is also located in some great ones also ..I personally would rather run into a DG than fight the crowd in a dirty Walmart
thought it was going to be so much worse based on earnings. AMZN hasn't had any bad news and it's been painful.

"Dg opening new stores ...20 by this year..its called Pop stop or something..they will sell home goods,cleaning supplies all for under $5... good job DG"
"This will probably see $150 now. Not only did they miss earnings, but they also have weak guidance. Not good."
I in for >200 shares so this is self serving statement but I cannot imagine why the multiple is at a 25% discount to the likes of TGT and WMT DLTR but with a lower PEG and greater same store sales growth. I realize DG has run up significantly over the last year but the earning are definitive and the macro picture and inflation expectations support discounted retailers. Only a matter of time before 240-250 level IMO

"Of 15 analysts following Dollar General, only one is now saying sell. Their average price target is 15% above its current price."
"Boy, that was a delayed reaction on the earnings. I guess better late than never ."
Strong company with good earnings and sustainable business model. Even if wages go up they will go up in stages over 4-5 years. The costs will get passed on to customers no matter what as they should be. A stronger customer base only adds to their upside.
Why’s it dropping?
I’m waiting for it to go green PM. I’m like am I missing something? Finally green
"I grew up in a very small town. On the ""main strip"" we have only one traffic light, two restaurants, a gas station. Also, we have two Dollar Generals in the area, and they do great in both spots. It's impressive the areas that Dollar General can thrive in that no other store can. Walmart, Target, Costco would go broke quickly in areas like these due to their high operating costs and the need for large populations. DG, on the other hand, can afford to dominate the suburban, and even rural areas. On my way home from work, if I need a few items, I'm heading to DG. Could I find them in Walmart, Target, etc? Absolutely, but walking in those stores is a 20 minute trip at the minimum, and that's if you know exactly where you're going. If not, you can easily be stuck in there an hour trying to navigate through the hundreds of aisles trying to find what you're looking for. On top of that, you're stuck parking the car at the back of the lot, a hundred yards away from the doors. DG, on the other hand, I can be in and out within 5 minutes and can park my car right next to the store.DG even has the luxury of marking up prices on items, and people will pay for it based upon the convenience of shopping quickly and in areas where there are no other options. DG is going to be a powerhouse and will dominate the growing suburbs for decades. LOAD UP."
Dollar General reached an all time high at 186.87
Why is going Down
"Yikes, I deeper dip than I anticipated. Anyways, no worries here, long term this thing will go up. That's why I only buy stock in large cap stable companies and industries. When mishaps like this happen you just have to wait a little longer(and it spits out a little div.)"
DG:Top 3 Dividend Growth Stocks For 2021 released on Seeking Alpha over this weekend
I don’t like to buy falling stocks but I saw funds are loading when it went down 6%. I think the risk reward was good for the institutions!
Can't wait to buy the dip! :)
Growing Revenue and Growing Earnings in a strong Growth industry.Great Buying opportunity!
"This Morning, Motley Fool has an article comparing Costco and DG and which is best investment for 2021. DG was the winner. Check it out."
"at this point to invest which is a better DLTR , DG or FIVE all discount stores"
Was way overpriced at $239.00 . A nice $20.00 to $30.00 drop would price it correctly.
interesting to see how this will perform over the next week or so. Possible double down today?
"Not only am I a fan and stock owner of DG with a hefty gain, I'm also a regular customer at their stores. Their prices are lower than just about anyone. I am looking forward to more gains as this stock goes to 200 and beyond. They will do well in good and bad times. Long and strong."
"A rising tide lifts all boats, indeed. Love it when Zacks gets poetic. Time to get into the #DG boat. Positive fundamentals and consistent performance continue. Sometimes it's just about capital preservation and sustainable growth. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-dollar-general-dg-stock-123312557.htmlhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-dollar-general-dg-stock-123312557.html"
"has anyone here walked into a Dollar General before? its expensive, crowded, a mess, and has 2 employees. why would anyone shop there????"
Wonder what the thief percentage at Dollar General is? It has to be tremendous. Both customers and workers.
"I need some cash, so of all my choices I choose to place a sell limit at 238. Hopefully sells this week as the price of fuel is tough. Works for me!"
They have been expanding so rapidly. Just in my small town there is 4 of then all with in 15/20 mins of each other. All located in more rural cheaper areas but on heavily traveled routes. Need toothpaste cat food or what ever... Conviniant store for the needed daily goods ... Just talked to my family and back home two more are getting put up. These stores will be more abundant then 711 s...
If you chose to invest in DG instead of DLTR you made the right decision. DG on a chart has dramatically outperformed DLTR over the past year. I think their business model and marketing strategies are superior as well. I also think it's a better growth story. This is definitely one of the better investment decisions of my career.
"Earning call coming out today, should I buy the dip?"
Dollar General the great money machine! $$$$$$$
Big rig last few months .. long term bullish but will correct after and then continue
Quarterly earnings report coming up later this month. Looks like DG is going to blow it out based on reports of high level of store activity. Buy before earning report?
What in the name of Sam Hill is going on? What more does a company have to do? Good grief....
Great article about Dollar General in today's Wall Street Journal.
https://go.trade-ideas.com/SHAP
If we had a PE ratio of 30 we'd be at $200. Why are we stuck with such a low PE ratio when DG is GROWING!
crankin today! i got into DG end of 2016 around $70....better than walmart the parking lot of these stores are always filled.
Unfortunately purchased at $207 - no worries- this to shall pass - plan on holding multiple years - great company
"Business is picking up going into the Holidays:HALLOWEEN,THANKSGIVING ,CHRISTMAS,NEW YEAR'S!!!!"
"Tonight, Jim Cramer named three stocks that makes sense in a slowing economy as the pandemic continues on and he mentioned Dollar General as one of the three along with Lowe’s and Home Depot hopefully will get a little bit of a pop tomorrow on that but there is definitely some talk of going back to a little bit more of the pandemic type stocks and away from the value stocks that were being played just a few weeks ago it’s amazing how the market sentiment can change very quickly but with the stimulus and the lockdown in Europe and the variation of COVID-19 that may be mutating Cramer is back mentioning Dollar General as one of his stocks to go to."
Finally sold some of my DG stock. Not all but just enough to get my initial investment back. Now I’m playing with the houses money.
I don't know about the rest of you but I always check the stock conversations to make by buying and selling decisions because you guys are soooo smart and insightful.
"It's tough not to be bullish after those earnings, but it may take a couple days. Best I can tell the softness today is due to the potential reduction in federal food aid. Once that becomes a little more clear, the big investors will jump in to drive the price. DG didn't sound overly concerned about any changes, but the food market as a whole seems to be selling today. DLTR KR even FIVE all pretty much moving like DG"
Rising food costs will cause more and more people to flee the main grocers and head to discount ones like DG and WMT.
"From what I took away from the conference call, there was a lot more to like than dislike. The negatives were that SG&A expenses ramped up. The positives were that now this marks seven straight quarters where gross margins have increased, and operating profit also increased. In additions, inclement weather limited consumer traffic to below normal levels. 2021 guidance failed to please the street too, but IMO this shouldn't have come as a surprise to anyone as stuff like sales would've experienced a slight decrease upon economic reopening as well. Earnings came in below expectations too. Overall I'm not concerned and think the dip should be bought. DG has huge loyalty amongst their customers and their low prices will continue to attract more and more customers. I became a regular customer last year. Temporary bump in the road IMO. This will go back above $200 once the rate scare is over. Long."
Goldman Sachs upgrades Dollar General today! $$$$$$
Am trying so hard not to liquidate all of my oil gains into DG right now...if it gets to $170 below a 15 forward PE my logic and conviction in this stock will be forced to.
Wouldn't you think that Dollar Tree's good report drag DG higher as well?
So oversold today. Loaded up on fresh shares at 173. What a bargain. This company prints money and can run a box with 4 employees! Will be taking dividends from this golden goose for years.
They just opened another store in my area. Good location for an underserved populace.
rocket tomorrow
"This question is for corporate...RE: Seeds and an expiration date.A few days ago, I stopped in to DG for a thing of Tide detergent. As I was walking in, I noticed a display with seeds, for planting. After going through the entire display, I realized the seeds expired two days prior to my visit. I asked the cashier for a discount and she said she would have to call the manager. After speaking with the manager, she told me they could not sell the seeds to me now because they were expired. I was taken back and very unsettled. If ur throwing them into a trash can that will end up who knows where, why couldn’t DG just offer these to the public for free. Or even for research to a local school? My question for you...Do you suppose DG could offer expired seeds to the public at no cost or possibly donate for research, especially here in Cowpens, SC? Anything planted in this ground is a plus. Yes, weeds too! DG could state the company would not be held liable. Liability would be on the consumer.Just a suggestion, God said it may help on ur stock. @sowingseedsforheaven"
The profit takers have left!!! Look at DG rally now!!! GO DG GO!!!
Talked to a DG store manager today. They are getting a remodel. That isn't big news because all the local stores have done this. What's interesting is she said they are going to get more into bulk selling like a Costco but on a smaller scale. It will be interesting to see what happens. This particular store is only two years old. They have several box trailers parked outside with the remodeling stuff inside.
"Great results. No new (upped) guidance though, which is always a killer. Hoping for a bounce."
We aren't up by much at the moment. Will good guidance during the conference call push us higher?
$200 would be a nice entry point.
Short Squeeze has people shorting DG beginning at 225 and some were still shorting at 188.. This is becoming worrisome.. Down 6.5 bucks today on twice the normal volume.. I'm open for suggestions . Thanks
remember dg has a gap at $141 all companies fill there gaps
"Both DG's stock price and the prices at their stores put a smile on my face. I always invest in companies who solve problems, in this case, the problem the lower class faces at expensive mom and pop consumer stores. DG has stellar management and is doing all the right things for both its customers and its investors. All of this taken into account only someone with a peanut sized brain wouldn't be hit with Cupid's arrow. As both an investor and a customer I expect to see this company trade at $300 a share. DLTR on the other hand I can't get nearly as excited about."
New 52-week high today! $$$ Great long term hold with exponential growth! $$$$!
"Backed up the truck today. DG is down for no good reason from the 220s. Long term price target remains 250. People aren't going to like discount retailers any less whether the economy is closed or open, and rising food costs right now work to DG's advantage as people will abandon the mom and pop grocers for the discount ones like DG and WMT. DG's business model is virtually bullet proof."
"Populations are leaving the big city traffic, taxes, and high cost of living.DG is following them into the burbs. Just saw a new one in a small coastal town, Port Aransas, Texas. The nearest Wally is over 25 miles away. The lot was full on a Saturday afternoon. With the adaption of Zoom employment/services, all DG lacks is a home delivery service, which is in the works."
Just nervous about the tariffs on DG's bottom line in future.
Now I'm hoping for $100. I don't know if it will make that. Definitely will sell it it makes triple digits.
Seeking alpha article saying WISH is similar to dollar store $DG BUT ONLINE so it should be greater than them
Beyond belief. Good report and a 1000 new stores. Why work so hard. ???
"This will hit $200 before earnings, and perhaps $215-220 after."
loaded my cart with DG at 219. good for me
I absolutely love Dollar General. they are opening 1000 new stores next year! 1000 stores in 1 year! what other retailers are opening stores these days instead of closing them!!!
This is a great Co. and look at all stats will be 180.00 soon !!! Sorry to all selling.
The positive trajectory of DG is more certain today than it was yesterday or the day before. Screaming buy. Will be $250/share in no time.
Wells Fargo just posted BUY Dollar General and $118.00 target. I am IN. ER will be a beat tomorrow for SURE!!
Heard it again today They’re in talks with someone. This has to be the Co that can afford a $48 price takeover. The two new directors want something to happen for shareholders. I hold both. BIG keeps climbing. Patience
"For 2021, Dollar General has 2,900 real estate projects in the pipeline, with plans to open 1,050 new stores, remodel 1,750 stores and relocate 100 stores. That includes two new prototypes that build on the Dollar General Plus (DGP) and Dollar General Traditional Plus (DGTP) format, which is larger than traditional Dollar General stores to accommodate more coolers and freezers for food and beverages.https://www.supermarketnews.com/retail-financial/dollar-general-hatches-big-plans-store-expansion?NL=SN-02&Issue=SN-02_20210319_SN-02_841&sfvc4enews=42&cl=article_3&utm_rid=CPG06000001673681&utm_campaign=44955&utm_medium=email&elq2=7e124f5bb90f428c9824825b8e5a4cdd"
with all the upgrades etc. what institutions/who would exit this stock & especially if we are going to go into a recession 2nd half 2019 dollar stores are the place to be wouldn't you think?
https://go.trade-ideas.com/SHAV
"So many people were complaining about this stock being stuck in the $190s range and were giving up on it...if you don't have patience, you will never make money in the market. I held on and now DG is breaking out. Absolutely love shopping at their stores and love their prices. Anyone with a bear case on this stock is very uneducated. This stock is a rock in hard times and good. Long and strong forever."
If the economy turns down $DG will go up.
There's a run on toilet paper again. $COST has shortages and sold out in many places. You wonder what this does for the tissue business of RFP. Also does anyone know what brands RFP produces? I believe they produce some for $DG
external environment factors having a short term impact on a great company with solid business model. this is a buy here. 250 in 6 months
Buy the dip
"Took a drive through VT, MA, CT, NY this weekend through some fairly depressed rural areas. Saturation of DG was really impressive, looked like the only market around with only an occasional small deli nearby. Consistent decades-long performer, solid growth and a reasonable balance sheet, P/E in line with similar in sector. Low beta, a plus in today's market, makes it an attractive buy and hold for the long term. If there are darker days ahead, folks will still need the basics. Long yesterday at $US188, much pricier than my usual comfort level but will look to amp up returns with some option writing. Feeling good about this one, seem to be on the side of analyst consensus as well."
"DG will do well regardless of a virus panic. low cost, local stores, food choices.Ed"
just remember the number one rule for investing: Patience is a virtue and patience always rewards it's investors.
Congrats Longs! This is hot market $DG $FIVE
"@Rob, nothing wrong with $DG, but with a P/E of 23.66, it's kinda expensive. If $BIG had the same P/E with it's current earnings, $BIG share price would be $147..... AND ....- In the past 12 months $BIG has more that doubled (up +125%), $DG is up only 37%- $BIG pays a dividend of 2.26%, $DG only 0.66%$BIG may stay under valued and $DG over valued, but my bet is that they won't. $BIG share price could DOUBLE from it's current level and still be less expensive than $DG. For the Risk/Reward I'm a buyer of $BIG. Added more to my position under $52 on the dip. Buy the dips IMHO. GLTY"
"Here comes the increase in fuel and labor costs. It will settle down after earnings and outlook. Hang in, but the slope up is going to be at bit tougher to maintain. Looking forward to this upcoming report. Again, hang in there!"
"Bought into a fair size position today after watching for a few months. Seems like a solid long term, recession-proof and profitable hold."
"This is a great company! Still putting up new stores in my area., store number 4 in under 2 years in a 30 mile radius! This one opens next month"
first time to see a stock getting punished for destroying their earnings....
Was a hold at Zacks before ER and now it’s a buy.
DG has been preparing themselves for years by expanding & updating all of their stores with improved chilled sections & fresh food. Every camper all summer long is gonna hammer those stores over & over
"EPS of $10.10/sh. yet only a $1.44/yr. dividend.Seems rather low ,doesn't it?"
If you sold during the last selloff of earnings you have to be sick looking a DG going up every day. Probably will be a pullback but DG's goal for the coming years is to double the number of stores. DLTR has the same goals.
"As I stated before earnings, transportation and manpower costs are climbing. I surmise that we will continue a slow slope up. Worth having in what I expect to be a few tough years coming up. We did pick up a new customer base with COVID. With child checks and increased food stamps, some will come this way.This company could use a good process transformation at the individual store level. Across the street from me in Sarasota, FL a new store in what's becoming a high cost of living area. The store often has no more than two employees working at once (shoplifters dream). Product in all the isles that should be on the shelf. Only two carts available for customers, the others are full of mixed product in the isles.Another store I shop at is on the edge of the Everglades. That store is dirty, product everywhere but where it should be. Sometimes only one employee working. I stop in the get beer on the way to fish camp and find they can't be consistent with what they carry."
I took my holdings up to 700 shares today as I believe a reversal has started. This type of sell off has occurred before followed by a big move up. Fundamentals have not changed on DG
Backed up the truck today and loaded. DG dirt cheap in the 170s. Rates won't be able to hold this company back forever. The business model is still sound...all the companies with good business models are being punished right now. Take advantage...the 200s will be back.
I'm upgrading to $125.00
The > 10% spanking she took over the last two months is going to take some time to wear off!
"Guys, PEG ratio is 10-12% better than the sector and this company is still growing. Trans and Labor costs are going up everywhere; prices will rise ST but will be more than offset with market share creation and gains. LT deflationary pressures increase USD strength (great for domestic firms like DG not so much for MNCs). Plus just look at the operating efficiency of this company; ROIC of 14-18% versus single digits of competition. Oh, and if you like Dividends how about at current payout ratio that is under 20% which will more than triple in the coming decades. Haven't even discussed the multiple expansion aspect of valuation; PE is currently 20 with a growth rate of 8+% = Pay me now or pay me later :)"
Manipulation at its best. $207 to $202 lol. I’m not selling my shares. $240 by years end.
"07:47 AM EDT, 08/27/2020 (MT Newswires) -- Dollar General (DG) reported Thursday a fiscal Q2 adjusted net income of $3.12 per diluted share, up from $1.74 a year earlier.Analysts had expected an adjusted diluted EPS of $2.47, according to the Capital IQ poll.Net sales for the quarter ended July 31 for the store chain were $8.68 billion, a year-over-year increase from $6.98 billion. The Capital IQ consensus estimate was for $8.35 billion. Same-store sales grew 18.8%."
Why is the stock down so much today? Earnings were good and forecast was not bad at all!
I guess that my brother and I are the only individual investors in this company besides big banks and brokerage firms making huge profits here? $$$$$$$$$$$
Huge PT upgrades from several analysts yet it drops  just he patient and this thing will take off like it did last quarter. it took a couple down days last quarter and then began it's hike up the mountain. I'm 100% confident this stock rebounds very strong.
Turned a quick 75% profit on some 9/18 $220 calls I purchased yesterday. Got out at EOD for fear of being too greedy. Stock will definitely be up 4% tomorrow.
"Great earnings call. In an environment awash with bad and sad, DG continues to rise above it all, literally and metaphorically. As emphasized in the call, their market presence is dominant in the sector, with 16K stores within a 5 mile radius of 75% of the population. YoY EPS up 73%. Little doubt in my mind they are well positioned to carry shareholders through the turbulent times ahead.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/edited-transcript-dg-earnings-conference-205307314.html"
I am seeing many new dollar general stores in my area. at least 5 new stores just in my area. growth or saturation? I like dollar tree better because everything is a dollar but dg seems to be more aggressive
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-dollar-general-stock-walmart-230311907.htmlThe biggest difference between #DG , Target and Walmart? Geographic market saturation. Last stat I saw was 16K+ stores within a five mile radius of SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT of the population. A number worth shouting about. Sadly, as the pool of local Mom&Pops continues to shrink in the absence of SBA federal support or a moratorium on lease payments, Dollar General is the winner by default."
Look at DG rally!!! GO DG GO!!!
largest drop since March pandemic.. grab dip.. $DG only down 4%
We are sitting right on the 50. Do we bounce here or head lower? Anyone adding?
Sold my Jan 230 contracts once I saw 236 was the current resistance. Thanks DG for the sweet tendies. Price will drop and I will get back in on some new contracts after October for sure!!!
"Good buy gone bye. I have enough of this so I'm OK. Hang in there, it'll be fine."
"Anyone else think this should be $160.00? Maybe I wasn't listening to the same CC, but I thought 1000 new stores would excite investors."
"If DG had the smae p/e multiple as TGT the shares would be $215...if it had the same multiple as WMT, the shares would be $294.....loose hands got shook out yesterday by men in pin striped suits....this is a $220-$250 stock all day long...I think we make a new 52 wk high in the second quarter. A permanent and growing underclass will keep feeding DG coffers. CC was quite good. Higher pandemic related costs reduced profits to .10 lower than consensus expectations. Margins improved. I felt they were being a bit coy lowering guidance to benefit their stock buyback program and create a lower bar going forward. Billions of stimulus dollars will flow to DG cash registers. G.L."
Profit takers. That’s all I can see. Part of the game. Stay long. Great company and great stores. Saved me from going 7 miles for an ingredient yesterday. Happens all the time.
"Why would you open 1K locations if there wasn't opportunity? Clearly they have a successful niche market. Negatives from the market will eventually dissipate over time that they prove they are immune from the Amazon effect and as they keep increasing investment in their business and prove they can grow sustainably over time the market will be forced to give them the multiple they deserve for a growth company which is what they are. Who else in retail is increasing sales at +10%? This is an investment, not a trade for me."
"Say what you want about the people who go to DG, bottom line is this company helped a lot of Americans out during the pandemic"
"Earnings beat was solid great top and bottom line numbers. Conference call was great, outlining big plans going forward. This should be moving Mich higher!!"
I bought a few shares at 188.70 thinking it reached its bottom today so hopefully tomorrow this goes back up
"At least it's moving up, next hurdle is the jobs report in the morning, good report the market will soar!"
"Earnings looked ok, lowered guidance is the cause of the share price drop...but typical of companies to lower the bar to make comps easier going forward.......good buying opp right here....21 p/e is reasonable relative to the other retail stock universe....several retail etf's are up 50% this year...DG as a laggard is where I want to be...+ a div....G.L."
"Market red DG green, Market Green DG green... BEST STOCK!"
"This is the $DG of online commerce. Show me the money! 42,000 for the long haul. Not selling till $40"
"Buy the dip folks. DG will be a $250 stock soon. The reasons it’s lost steam are because of the general market, nothing to do with the company itself. They still have the best prices on their items and are eating the lunch of other stores."
that's how it goes these days lol. PT increases causes a selloff and drops the stock to what it was before their strong earnings and positive guidance in future rollouts. Makes so much sense.
I live in Texas Big State. There are a lot off rule areas. And I travel all over Texas. And there is a Dollar General being build in theses rule areas. This company is growing leaps and bound. You can not go wrong on this stock.
"With hard economic times, a store like dollar general that sells reasonably priced essentials is likely to do well"
"01:40 PM EST, 12/06/2019 (MT Newswires) -- Dollar General (DG) has an average buy rating among analysts with a $163 average price target."
"Raised to outperform by several analysts today, price target $US 225."
One of the best stores to hit small town America. Prices are as good or better than Walmart and local grocery chains. They are saving small communities that are losing their retail. I no longer have to go to the bigger towns to get many items. Went their this morning in a bad Midwest storm that kept me home. Buy as their future is bright in my opinion. Go DG.
"All good news being published about DG, with huge upside projected. Most investment houses rating it a buy or strong buy. approx. 97% owned by big institutions, so small John Doe traders like me don't affect it much, day to day. I just take the crumbs they throw out and laugh all the way to the bank. This stock does not move up or down with the markets (low BETA), as much as many. It takes patience to get the major gains. Good trading to all!"
"I'm not detracting, just asking....Why buy a company near its 52 week high that pays a very small dividend?"
"DG is a credible viable company as I have analyzed it’s financial position, and placement with it’s competition, ratings, etc. I think the market is overreacting. We will see this in the upcoming release of its financial results. The stock should be trading around $225 to $250."
Tough one here. Fuel and drivers labor costs gonna hurt!
"Yesterday's CDC chatter considering DGs as vax locations seems to have hit today. With exceptional saturation (locations within 75% of the US population, beating big box) this would be a brilliant choice . And obviously a terrific driver of foot traffic. Win/win."
"In small town America, you can walk to DG safely.Many are escaping big cities and super stores. DG is a refuge for all."
$95 tomorrow on great earnings!
Another FYI ! Moody's Rating Service gave DG a very positive short-term and longer term rating.
Ouch! Share price keeps dropping. Where’s the bottom? 210? 200? Or back to $174?
Downward movement to set up earnings bounce back to where is was imho
"On analyst out of 11 down grade and the stock pulls back. 8 have it as a buy. Cost of food, gas - everything going up. That makes DG more valuable."
Hopefully this stock is consolidating at the $93-$95 level. Getting ready to go to $100.
I believe that the threat of a $15 minimum wage has been weighing on DG and today the Senate Parliamentarian ruled that it cannot be part of the Covid Relief Bill. I see DG up in the next few days as a result and I feel some of the stimulus money will be headed DG's way. I went from a nice gain on 700 shares to a $5800 loss.
"As long as people would rather spend less on products than more, there is no long term bear case to be made for DG. I advised people to buy the latest earnings dip. Those that listened are sitting pretty. Rising rates may be a headwind but not long term, and they certainly haven't been able to stop the rise in the stock price as of recently. DG is going to continue to do well whether the economy is shut down or fully open. People aren't going to like cheap consumer prices any less than before."
WellsFargo dropped rating on DG? I dropped my rating of WF's credibility to zero five years ago.
I bet earnings will be great but stock will drop like all other companies who have reported well.
Hitting another all time high today! $162.72! Great company! Let's keep it rolling!$$$$$
"Everybody is recommending this stock as a Buy. However, we are still waiting for the lemmings to wake up from their long winter's nap and buy a good, growing, solid stock."
Why would BofA downgrade the stock 3 days before ER? Don't you hate manipulation?
"Dollar general buying up parcels to make full on DG grocery stores with fresh food. No matter how much of a lockdown the commies try to push with covid, this stock will continue to rise. A remarkable position to hold long term."
It's ok guys it's just a temporary hiccup as the price of goods catch up to labor costs.
Is this a $130 stock in November after the Red wave?
"Well I bailed on this. Somethings wrong. With the market flying today, great numbers with DG, and its flopping around like a fish out of water?"
"Surprised yahoo hasn't closed this comment section down too. They really hate differing points of view on their propaganda articles, however DG looks like its closing in on 200$ wont be long before were looking for 300. They are an efficient store and keep the shelves stocked well with limited workers."
Dollar General gets post-earnings price target hike from Telsey Advisory Group https://seekingalpha.com/news/3609690
Too many good things ahead for Dollar General. Bullish AF
i was in DG and got out to go cash.. back in because everywhere you go there is a quick trip store... some people just dont realize they are becoming a nice store and not just for welfare folks..
"15,370 DG stores throughout the United States and still growing! $$$$"
"Trying to pinpoint where, exactly to get into this. I doubt it goes under $100 but if it does, I'm going to pounce. I love these companies that plan on attacking the suburban and small town markets. $DASH $DG $GO are three great examples. Not every company can operate in these markets, but the ones that can will dominate in the future with the suburban revolution. I drive for DASH in my spare time. I hardly ever see an UberEats or GrubHub order in my market. DASH completely dominates."
Pulled 5k out of AAPL yesterday and threw it all into DG once it dipped below 200. Easiest decision I’ve made this week.
"Fundamentals are good and solid , great support at $205 , RSI & Moving average are uptrend. It can easily hit $220 by this or next week."
DG had a nice article today in Seeking Alpha that was very detailed and painted a nice picture for us in 2021. I’m very bullish.
"Continued great long action this morning. Volume feels a little thin, but comfortable. So much C19 surge news this weekend, nice to see and feel the optimism but thinking maybe a good time to reposition for the second wave which looks to be deeper and broader in scope than spring 20. Staying long DG, hard to write options against such a winner. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dollar-general-dg-displays-solid-140802850.htmlhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/dollar-general-dg-displays-solid-140802850.html"
"DG is doing everything right currently. They are consistently growing gross margins and operating margins, opening new stores by the boatload, and introducing stuff like fresh produce into their foods section to make them more competitive with the mainline grocers, all while being able to maintain some of the lowest consumer prices. It's no wonder so many like this stock. And it doesn't have the problems with freight costs that its most direct competitor, DLTR has. DG is among my favorite of the discount retailers, and of retailers in general. This company deserves a premium valuation compared to where it currently trades."
Bought May 180 calls for cheap
"Getting into pharmacy, DG should be buying Rite Aid. 2500 locations, distribution and PBM with 24B in revenue and for sale"
Long and Strong - Full Bull DG. Slow and Steady best ROIC in the biz and continuing to Grow YoY. Payout ratio is like 18% as this company matures Payout Ratio will double and could make you a millionaire if you're investment horizon is longer than 10 years.
"Just got off the earnings call. I honestly have to laugh at michael who told me I was going to be broke and homeless owning this company. What a moron. This was a fantastic quarter. Gross margin expanded yet again, marking 2 full years of expansion in that category. In addition operating margins expanded. The primary driver of gross margin expansion was DG Fresh. In addition to that DG opened 260 new stores, with plans to open over 1000 more in the near future. They continue to buy back a large amount of shares. Headwinds include tough year over year comp sales due to the economic shutdown last year. In addition to that DG is putting self checkout in all their stores as well as produce. Any decline in same store sales will be temporary. EPS growth was impressive as well. Compound annual growth rates in all categories were phenomenal. SG&A expenses rose but they are so far being outpaced by revenue growth. Inflation appears to have failed to dent gross margins. Now after all this Michael, do you really want to bet the farm this company is going to 0?"
"Well stocks are rising today because the Demorats got their slush fund passed without Repubs and I am sure DG will benefit from the $1400 give away. I think I will invest mine in a new tractor, lol."
going to pop at earnings hopefully to at least 220s .. everyone is trying to cut corners going to these types of stores...
"Dg has moved quite a way, from a few weeks ago of big drop. On path to keep the upward climb, with some profit-taking pullbacks. Just my opinion, but all stores near us, shopping is staying consistent and a couple of new stores are being added to areas that really need them (many more than these two being added, but these two are out in country, where availability to shop is non-existent. Both should do very well, as they are in high traffic areas, on major state roads."
"Steady up, that what counts for me. I needed some cash, so of all my choices I chose to sell some today at 231.75. Works for me!"
Gotta wait for the upgrades and higher price targets over the coming days to move on up a lot higher from here.
Too bad they don't make Electric Cars and not make any money....then it would be up 20%
"Company philosophy hasn't changed. Moving forward, opening new stores, daily. Stock begin driven down again, on negative (fake news) for big buyers to step in. Long term, a great, steady growing company, with great leadership. JMO"
"robinhooders/reddit/wallstreetbets have rattled the mkts...nothing more going on....DG is a big fat gift right here, right now ....... today is an abberation"
https://go.trade-ideas.com/SHAQ
Everything indicates that the next financial report is going to be highly positive without a doubt. There is nothing else to expect but a sudden rise soon ...
"All good news for the longer term. Company continues to execute their plans in great fashion. Figures show mgt. is doing a good job. Why do people fell the need to buy DLTR, a dying company, when this company has been consistent with it's growth, stock price, and earnings? Guess it takes the DLTR buyer sot make everyone else money. Just a thought. Everyone has them. Hang with DG for more gains."
I have been long on DG for years and have been adding more to my position on any weakness. $$$$$$Great stores! Great prices! Great Management! $$$$$$$
Been noticing that my local DG has many more cars in the parking lot latelyWho wants to stand in line outside walmart for 15 minutesI am in Illinois
"$DG purchases are typically the ""hey, I need a quick set of jumper cables... loaf of bread... pack of bottled water... but I don't feel like driving all the way to $TGT or $WMT"". The ""big city"" guys don't understand the Dollar General shopper -- they're not competing with $AMZN in any way whatsoever compared to the likes of Walmart and Target. I'm not afraid of Walmart's numbers... to some extent, I can see Dollar General doing even better in a down economy. This is a good company with a great future. It owns rural America and the forgotten side of the city."
"There was an article in Barron’s comparing DG to DLTR. DG had strong earnings, while DLTR incurred higher freight costs. There is also no doubt from an investment standpoint that DG has put a lot more money in investors’ pockets over the last year than DLTR, and outperforms it on a chart. Bottom line, I am very glad I chose to park my money in DG over DLTR. Superior management, etc. I think you should be buying DG hand over fist right now at these prices. There was very little to dislike about the most recent quarter."
"Since when has the analysts ever been right? They are moving the bar lower which could set up an earnings surprise... DG is everywhere, thrives in poorer areas, and should see some higher revs with ppl looking for cheaper prices during inflation...thanks to Joe B. and the Dems"
RGC downgraded DG. Bet they sold at 220+ and want back in at way lower price. Manipulators.
I have found a safe haven￼ in DG stock. The trend not to mention the Divs rest me assured that my portfolio is well balanced.
