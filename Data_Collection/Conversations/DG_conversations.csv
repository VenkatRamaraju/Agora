Buy the dip
"Guys, PEG ratio is 10-12% better than the sector and this company is still growing. Trans and Labor costs are going up everywhere; prices will rise ST but will be more than offset with market share creation and gains. LT deflationary pressures increase USD strength (great for domestic firms like DG not so much for MNCs). Plus just look at the operating efficiency of this company; ROIC of 14-18% versus single digits of competition. Oh, and if you like Dividends how about at current payout ratio that is under 20% which will more than triple in the coming decades. Haven't even discussed the multiple expansion aspect of valuation; PE is currently 20 with a growth rate of 8+% = Pay me now or pay me later :)"
"Earning call coming out today, should I buy the dip?"
There's a run on toilet paper again. $COST has shortages and sold out in many places. You wonder what this does for the tissue business of RFP. Also does anyone know what brands RFP produces? I believe they produce some for $DG
"As I stated before earnings, transportation and manpower costs are climbing. I surmise that we will continue a slow slope up. Worth having in what I expect to be a few tough years coming up. We did pick up a new customer base with COVID. With child checks and increased food stamps, some will come this way.This company could use a good process transformation at the individual store level. Across the street from me in Sarasota, FL a new store in what's becoming a high cost of living area. The store often has no more than two employees working at once (shoplifters dream). Product in all the isles that should be on the shelf. Only two carts available for customers, the others are full of mixed product in the isles.Another store I shop at is on the edge of the Everglades. That store is dirty, product everywhere but where it should be. Sometimes only one employee working. I stop in the get beer on the way to fish camp and find they can't be consistent with what they carry."
DG looks like it is about to drop. Be careful guys. I have been reading http://the-alphatrader.com/ and their stocks have been doing way better.
Sold my Jan 230 contracts once I saw 236 was the current resistance. Thanks DG for the sweet tendies. Price will drop and I will get back in on some new contracts after October for sure!!!
Can't wait to buy the dip! :)
largest drop since March pandemic.. grab dip.. $DG only down 4%
"This is the $DG of online commerce. Show me the money! 42,000 for the long haul. Not selling till $40"

external environment factors having a short term impact on a great company with solid business model. this is a buy here. 250 in 6 months
It's ok guys it's just a temporary hiccup as the price of goods catch up to labor costs.
"Yikes, I deeper dip than I anticipated. Anyways, no worries here, long term this thing will go up. That's why I only buy stock in large cap stable companies and industries. When mishaps like this happen you just have to wait a little longer(and it spits out a little div.)"
Too many good things ahead for Dollar General. Bullish AF
"Earnings looked ok, lowered guidance is the cause of the share price drop...but typical of companies to lower the bar to make comps easier going forward.......good buying opp right here....21 p/e is reasonable relative to the other retail stock universe....several retail etf's are up 50% this year...DG as a laggard is where I want to be...+ a div....G.L."
Ouch! Share price keeps dropping. Whereâ€™s the bottom? 210? 200? Or back to $174?
"Here comes the increase in fuel and labor costs. It will settle down after earnings and outlook. Hang in, but the slope up is going to be at bit tougher to maintain. Looking forward to this upcoming report. Again, hang in there!"
Tough one here. Fuel and drivers labor costs gonna hurt!
"There is speculation on the Rite Aid conversations board that DG will buy RAD. It makes sense since the size of the stores and its customers would love to buy DG merchandise and the liquor store and the pharmacy plus Elixir Insurance and PBM would be extra assets and already profitable. Only the front of the stores with poor merchandising is making RAD lose money. DG merchandise would solve that problem! DG can spinoff the Elixir to pay off the debt! If DG does not buy RAD, Dollar Tree will buy it and DG will fall way behind."
