"$PRT has really been piquing my interest lately. They’re developing technology that is convenient, efficient and gives people peace of mind, like scanners that eliminate the need to remove footwear at the airport. Or imaging innovation that detects if someone is carrying weapons… like this is futuristic next-level stuff imo! Their services can be used to serve government, military, police, rescue… or for information gathering in harsh conditions, inspection of facilities and pipelines, and much more. The company prides itself on providing safety for our generation in a way that has not been done before. They actually have people’s wellbeing as their #1 priority, and I think they’re at the forefront of some really new, unique and beneficial technologies that can help serve us all.Plymouth Rock Technology up at $.28 today, market cap $14.78m!"
