"MVO LOOKS GOOD. Paying out quarterly distributions., good yield."
PRT has declared a dividend already - 35 cents a share.http://www.permrock.com/news-releases/press-release-details/2018/PermRock-Royalty-Trust-Declares-Cash-Distribution/default.aspx?availablepressyears=2018
"Plymouth Rock Technologies Inc. ( $PRT.C , $PLRTF ) is a threat detection and unmanned technologies company.A few days ago they announced that they completed a non-brokered private placement.In this placement they solid 5,750,000 units at a price of $0.40 for aggregate gross proceeds of $2.3M.The units comprised of a common share and a purchase warrant for buying a share in the future for the price of $0.50 $PRT is going to use the proceeds from this placement for Tetra Drones acquisition cost, ongoing research and development and for the commercialization of PRT's technologies, and for working general capital.For anyone invested in $PRT or thinking of investing, what do you think about this move? There seems to be some mixed feeling online but personally, I think that having this extra money is really going to serve the company (and therefore shareholders) a lot. Especially when you consider that a lot of their products are in the development phase, they need money from investors to be able to cover the costs of developing them into something that can be sold for profit. Price is currently $0.345 with an $18.31M MC Full article here:https://www.plyrotech.com/press/press-release-august9-2021/"

I truly believe that the Yahoo statistics page is really off base and needs a redo. The EPS and analysts haven't done an update in a year. This should be at 10 or more per share and their 2 dollar price target is just plain stupid. Oil is at it's highest in 4 years.
Up some today maybe tomorrow will be a better day
PRT is down 6.16% to 5.79
PermRock Royalty Trust is up 7.85% to 2.06
Why the sudden drop in price? Can't seem to fin any bad news. Looks like I picked a bad time to start to add this to my investments.
PRT is up 5.57% to 7.50
Guess everyone leaving prt but I'm still in maybe my bad
What's happening? ?

"OVERPRICED?Based on the most recent 10K, it looks like buyers are paying about nine bucks a barrel for proved reserves.Now, there have been some field extensions and discoveries over the past couple years, but there have also been some negative revisions, as well. And disappointingly, the PV10/market cap ratio is pretty weak. We're looking at 1.5x on proved developed, 3x total, and that's on $55/bbl WTI which we have not hit yet. There will be an increase in distributions due to an increase in oil prices, but I don't expect a lot. Maybe PRT will see five cents per month. I would be a buyer at $1.50, but I'm skeptical of PRT at these levels. Simply put there are better deals out there."
PRT reached a 52 Week low at 4.68
These oil trust are nothing but pump and dump ponzi schemes. The stock price will tank and the dividend will to. I have lost money every time. Beware!
A week it seems until the next announcement - Anyone half as bullish as me that we may get a 50% bump in the distribution?
8 times normal volume with time still on the clock. Up over 10% as next dist is going to be higher and that is going to keep happening for months with current oil prices.
Is PRT still pumping during the storm?
I may be wrong bought 2500 shares 2.35 see what happens good luck to all
"Bad buy now. Last February, price here was $4.35/unit. Newbies here already missed the boat. Not for me now. Phart"

The Permian basin in west Texas will have another major pipeline added by ExxonMobil and it’s business partners per announcement today.
BASED UPON THE PRICE OF OIL - I BELIEVE THAT THE MAY - JUNE & JULY 2021 DIVIDENDS WILL BE OVER 7 CENTS.
the world is awash in oil. USA is pumping at record levels and full to the brim. oversupplied. prices have nowhere to go but down. PRT will feel this as time marches on. oil is the new coal.
This will soon sell for less than $3.
Bullish
"Was waiting for this, the WSJ printed the increased distribution in today's paper. That it doubled is no longer a secret though they still have the yield as a puny 2.5% - maybe that's a daily rate? LOL. Additional bonus is that all the other monthly paying energy trusts listed in the WSJ today decreased their payouts. 8Xs normal volume so far today! Far out man!!"

"I just came across this article that highlights the benefits in investing in Drone related stocks: https://financial-news-now.com/the-future-looks-very-hot-for-investors-entering-drone-stocks/The article highlights this sector's rapid growth and the praise it has received from major institutions like Goldman Sachs. From deliveries to the battlefield, drones tech will be utilized more and more in the future. My Drone company pick is Plymouth Rock Technologies ( $PRT.c $PLRTF ) as I feel it is highly undervalued at $0.275 $PRT develops threat detection & drone tech that is used by the military, police, and more. They have been making huge strides recently:- opening 3 UK facilities - achieving the International Organization for Standardization's ISO 9001: 2015 qualification - And expanding their team with 8 new hiresSo, is everyone feeling as excited about drones as I am?"
"You guys may want to take a look at MVO, crunch the mumbers looks like the distribution may be more than doubling, sending unit prices up for nice gains.Just don't say nobody told you."

The company has an expected earnings growth rate of 25.2% for the current year per Zack’s analysts today.
PermRock is popping again! I think this is just the beginning as sleepy Joe is destroying oil sovereignty in America.

"Now, this is just a speculation of mine, but with the Taliban once again in control of Afghanistan, domestic security spending (specifically in western countries involved in the decades-long war) will increase. Domestic security equipment is exactly what $PRT provides in addition to their drones."
Is PRT going bankrupt? Kind of looks like it by their stock.

"Plymouth Rock Technologies just announced completion of UK Company ISO9001 which is a significant accreditation milestone speaking to the quality of the team, process and service quality. Coinciding with this update are 8 new hires which bode well for its growth.

"$PRT.C $PLRTF Drone company who works with the US military for weapons detection is back on my radar as the Taliban and Afghanistan situation heats up. Trading back on support too. Thoughts?""The North America and NATO alliance has some the best and brightest government prime contract companies serving them. We know this because we have worked with these organizations and continue to supply to them. They build some of the best defense and space hardware in existence. These companies are set up for multi-billion dollar contract cycles and building hardware for known situations.""https://www.plyrotech.com/what/"
"In case you missed it, $PRT $PRT.CN recently announced a new contract with Survey-AR that sees them selling custom drones to deliver a drone swarm test capability. The project will further review market validation/value of identified segments as well as take advantage of critical feedback to further evolve drone swarming capabilities.""Drone swarms are, in every sense, transformational technology,"" stated Carl Cagliarini, Chief Strategy Officer of $PRT. ""They can substitute humans in dangerous or hostile environments, from the front line of a warzone, through to the detection of commercial gases.” Great to see $PRT land a contract like this, another step in the right direction!https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/95199"
"This looks like an interesting play and is suffering from lack of good investor education at this time. The company has a 100% of production hedged with $60 per barrel put options, but stock is being hammered by investors focused on oil falling to $50 and the fact that Permian has issues getting oil out of area, however pipelines are coming to the area and should alleviate this and transportation costs will begin to fall. Time to follow Seth Klarman’s advice of using your ability to extend your time horizon to capture the advantages this stock has, which is the fact the transportation issues will be solved within 12 to 18 months with new pipelines, and the production is already hedged at 100% at 60 for 2018 and 76% at 60 for 2019."
Pay Day... Next months dividend will be over a nickel. Maybe even .06. A barrel of Oil has been strong the last 3 months.
6.65 this stock is dirt cheap with a new oil well next month dividend and in this quarter 2 more oil well excited to be drilled I think 9/10 dollars by January 1
The .04 dividend was based on 51.00 oil price we are now up in the 60's. when oil hits 75.00 what will we be getting as a monthly dividend? Any guess?
$5.41 and over 14% dividend. Like to see 30% dividend.
"Unit price too low. Based on today's distribution, with new well coming on line, PRT worth $8.90. As oil continues to ascend over the summer this is a no brainer. Steady cash and low float...just watch and see."
PRT reached a 52 Week low at 2.38
"okay Louis, did you do any home work man? what do the reserves look like, who's the operator, how many wells?"
"Wow! The volatility is excessive for a dividend play. I was thinking of jumping in, but after this I'm going to wait and see how it behaves between now and January."
Has the bleeding stopped?

Finally an up day. Love to see this get back to 6.00. Leveraged down from 7.71 to 6.90 over last few months.
"Don't understand this stock should have announced dividend payment today,???????"
Nice move today.My big concern is how sustainable are their reserves? Can we expect similar production over next 20 yrs?happy new year.
PRT is up 6.04% to 9.23
"Should oil hit $70. in Texas, I would not be surprised to see pps @ $7-8. If GS is right with $80.+ this coming summer, pps may get to $10. if payout substantiates the price. For whatever reason, nothing stays around long enough now days."
Holy Steal. 500 more added
Dog with flease
PRT is up 5.12% to 6.57
Buying 5000 at 1.50 if I can get it LoL
How does a 7% increase to receipts combined with decreases to all reported expenses and a $40k return of prior reserved funds equate to a decreased distribution?
Hello....anybody home ????
"Plymouth Rock deserves more attention as a military-grade drone company. From a regulatory standpoint, GovCan approved commencement of BVLOS flights acting as a strong catalyst for this industry, and from a company standpoint $PRT.C are industry leaders with their tech and R&D exceeding the world record for unmanned delivery. With an extremely tight MC and criminal undervaluation of $20M, $PRT.C is a solid entry into this promising sector. https://dronelife.com/2021/06/16/bvlos-flight-in-canada-volatus-granted-sfoc-to-fly-across-the-country/"

Today four banks initiated a buy rating for PRT. What's interesting here is that all four were involved in the IPO. Who knows but maybe they still have stock to sell.
A interesting bit of information that I always like to do is divide the total production per day by the number of wells to get the average production per well per day. In this case the average daily production is 1952 barrels and the number of wells is 429. This gives a average per well per day of 4.55 barrels. The plus side of this is that a problem with one well will not affect the distributions by much. Of course there are also a lot of negatives.

"Found this article on the medical usefulness of drones. I think that drones are slowly going to take over a lot of tasks in various industries.

PRT has been strong the last few days so I do not think that the WSJ had that much to do with it . What is impressive is the volume and price action today in one of the worst down days in the oil sector in a while. I hope that the buyer(s) know something that we don't. I cant imagine a 4 cent dividend got a whole bunch of retail investors excited.
Up over 100% since January of this year. Increased dividends and will continue to increase throughout the year. Any profit taking is normal and a gift to those wanting to add more shares.
