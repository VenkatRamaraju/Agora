"A Royalty Trust is a financial vehicle that allows natural gas, coal, and oil companies to return a portion of their capital as dividends to investors. The dividends will vary based upon production sales and production cost. More information is available on line. List in your search engine, the words “royalty trust” for your search."
How does a 7% increase to receipts combined with decreases to all reported expenses and a $40k return of prior reserved funds equate to a decreased distribution?
"Found this article on the medical usefulness of drones. I think that drones are slowly going to take over a lot of tasks in various industries. For instance, I think that we could see $PRT 's tech really revolutionizing the law-enforcement industry. I'm not worried about short term dips as I really see this as a long term investment. https://dronedj.com/2021/08/27/swedish-drone-trial-rushes-defibrillators-to-heart-attack-victims-faster/?fbclid=IwAR0hGGH_A0za0W1Kke_09rkWDYcku-AMMn9V9M5pEo8nTe4GmgMxhbtFfds"

"Love seeing Plymouth Rock Technologies ($PRT $PRT.c $PLRTF) on its way back up in the CSE!Plus, $PRT has had consistent strong starts in Germany with tons of buying and an increase in activity every day.Found this great article on why $PRT has been doing so well, attributes the drive up to their partnership with the UK Civil Aviation Authority & NBEC! https://fostersleader.com/2021/10/07/what-drove-plymouth-rock-plrtf-stock-up-19-in-last-session/$PRT also participated in the DroneX Trade Show last week and was featured on Geekswana's youtube channel, starting at the 15 minute mark!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U31niWzAN6E"

"I just came across this article that highlights the benefits in investing in Drone related stocks: https://financial-news-now.com/the-future-looks-very-hot-for-investors-entering-drone-stocks/The article highlights this sector's rapid growth and the praise it has received from major institutions like Goldman Sachs. From deliveries to the battlefield, drones tech will be utilized more and more in the future. My Drone company pick is Plymouth Rock Technologies ( $PRT.c $PLRTF ) as I feel it is highly undervalued at $0.275 $PRT develops threat detection & drone tech that is used by the military, police, and more. They have been making huge strides recently:- opening 3 UK facilities - achieving the International Organization for Standardization's ISO 9001: 2015 qualification - And expanding their team with 8 new hiresSo, is everyone feeling as excited about drones as I am?"

"This looks like an interesting play and is suffering from lack of good investor education at this time. The company has a 100% of production hedged with $60 per barrel put options, but stock is being hammered by investors focused on oil falling to $50 and the fact that Permian has issues getting oil out of area, however pipelines are coming to the area and should alleviate this and transportation costs will begin to fall. Time to follow Seth Klarman’s advice of using your ability to extend your time horizon to capture the advantages this stock has, which is the fact the transportation issues will be solved within 12 to 18 months with new pipelines, and the production is already hedged at 100% at 60 for 2018 and 76% at 60 for 2019."

"Plymouth Rock Technologies Inc. ( $PRT.C , $PLRTF ) is a threat detection and unmanned technologies company.A few days ago they announced that they completed a non-brokered private placement.In this placement they solid 5,750,000 units at a price of $0.40 for aggregate gross proceeds of $2.3M.The units comprised of a common share and a purchase warrant for buying a share in the future for the price of $0.50 $PRT is going to use the proceeds from this placement for Tetra Drones acquisition cost, ongoing research and development and for the commercialization of PRT's technologies, and for working general capital.For anyone invested in $PRT or thinking of investing, what do you think about this move? There seems to be some mixed feeling online but personally, I think that having this extra money is really going to serve the company (and therefore shareholders) a lot. Especially when you consider that a lot of their products are in the development phase, they need money from investors to be able to cover the costs of developing them into something that can be sold for profit. Price is currently $0.345 with an $18.31M MC Full article here:https://www.plyrotech.com/press/press-release-august9-2021/"

""They can substitute humans in dangerous or hostile environments, from the front line of a warzone, through to the detection of commercial gases.” Great to see $PRT land a contract like this, another step in the right direction!https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/95199"

The .04 dividend was based on 51.00 oil price we are now up in the 60's. when oil hits 75.00 what will we be getting as a monthly dividend? Any guess?
Guessing down bigtime tomorrow....
"Plymouth Rock Technologies is getting some coverage!$PRT was participating in the DroneX Trade Show this week and was interviewed for Geekswana's YouTube channel.Ben, $PRT's head of R&D had the opportunity to talk about their specialties, their clients, the different industries they create UAV systems for, and what their drones are capable of.Ben also had the chance to highlight what makes them unique- their ability to design and manufacture bespoke systems specifically tailored for their client's requirements- which blew away the interviewee, understandably! The hosts called them very serious company and said their drones are ""incredible, frankly!"" imo, huge deal to get that level of praise. v cool that theyre getting on peoples radars.Up today at $.44 with a market cap of $23.22M$PRT featured starting at 15:07 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U31niWzAN6E]"

Is PRT going bankrupt? Kind of looks like it by their stock.
The Permian basin in west Texas will have another major pipeline added by ExxonMobil and it’s business partners per announcement today.
A interesting bit of information that I always like to do is divide the total production per day by the number of wells to get the average production per well per day. In this case the average daily production is 1952 barrels and the number of wells is 429. This gives a average per well per day of 4.55 barrels. The plus side of this is that a problem with one well will not affect the distributions by much. Of course there are also a lot of negatives.
"OVERPRICED?Based on the most recent 10K, it looks like buyers are paying about nine bucks a barrel for proved reserves.Now, there have been some field extensions and discoveries over the past couple years, but there have also been some negative revisions, as well. And disappointingly, the PV10/market cap ratio is pretty weak. We're looking at 1.5x on proved developed, 3x total, and that's on $55/bbl WTI which we have not hit yet. There will be an increase in distributions due to an increase in oil prices, but I don't expect a lot. Maybe PRT will see five cents per month. I would be a buyer at $1.50, but I'm skeptical of PRT at these levels. Simply put there are better deals out there."
"Nice to see EARNINGS jump from 5.7% in March to 7.6% in April, just as the company said it would... Now, May's dividend likely to jump back to the 10% range, as March saw a huge rise in the oil price... About time for an analyst UPGRADE, imo."

"Was waiting for this, the WSJ printed the increased distribution in today's paper. That it doubled is no longer a secret though they still have the yield as a puny 2.5% - maybe that's a daily rate?

Their services can be used to serve government, military, police, rescue… or for information gathering in harsh conditions, inspection of facilities and pipelines, and much more. The company prides itself on providing safety for our generation in a way that has not been done before.

PermRock Royalty Trust is up 9.44% to 1.97
I truly believe that the Yahoo statistics page is really off base and needs a redo. The EPS and analysts haven't done an update in a year. This should be at 10 or more per share and their 2 dollar price target is just plain stupid. Oil is at it's highest in 4 years.
The company has an expected earnings growth rate of 25.2% for the current year per Zack’s analysts today.
$PRT $PRT.c dipping today but if you're familiar with their drones it's really just a day to stock up.I found this interview with the head of R and D for $PRT from last week at the Drone X event in London.It discusses- Background of $PRT- Designing and manufacturing in-house- $PRT ‘s XV drone (was on display)Really loved the talk about designing and manufacturing in house which I think is such a key thing especially as they scale up it will be critical.

I'll guess .078 distribution.
"Should oil hit $70. in Texas, I would not be surprised to see pps @ $7-8. If GS is right with $80.+ this coming summer, pps may get to $10. if payout substantiates the price. For whatever reason, nothing stays around long enough now days."

I cant imagine a 4 cent dividend got a whole bunch of retail investors excited.
"You guys may want to take a look at MVO, crunch the mumbers looks like the distribution may be more than doubling, sending unit prices up for nice gains.Just don't say nobody told you."
