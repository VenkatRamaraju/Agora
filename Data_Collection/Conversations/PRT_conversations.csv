"Great to see Plymouth Rock Technologies ($PRT $PRT.c $PLRTF) in the green today!Not surprising after such a news filled September.As the industry's market value is projected to reaching 119B by 2022, $PRT is a super affordable stock in a massive market. Their UAS technology can be used in a variety of industries, such as law enforcement, military operations, surveillance, and search & rescue missions.I'd recommend checking out their corporate presentation to learn more:https://www.plyrotech.com/wp-content/uploads/PRT_Corp_Presentation.pdf"
"Big news for Plymouth Rock Technologies ( $PRT.C $PLRTF )....Yesterday they announced that Aardvark LLP have issued a purchase order for a PRT unmanned aircraft to perform security and environmental operations in remote locations.In light of this news $PRT's CSO said that this order will take their revenue, ""to Aardvark close to a quarter of a million USD for 2021 and further cements them as a significant client.""Additionally, $PRT announced that they have started an awareness campaign with 3 seperate marketing firms in Vancouver, Burnsville and Huntington Beach.Both of these announcements are really exciting and bode well for $PRT More here : https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/99370/Plymouth-Rock-Technologies-Announces-Followup-Order-for-Oil-and-Gas-Pipeline-Monitoring-and-Environmental-Operations"
$PRT $PRT.c dipping today but if you're familiar with their drones it's really just a day to stock up.I found this interview with the head of R and D for $PRT from last week at the Drone X event in London.It discusses- Background of $PRT- Designing and manufacturing in-house- $PRT ‘s XV drone (was on display)Really loved the talk about designing and manufacturing in house which I think is such a key thing especially as they scale up it will be critical. And with $PRT sitting at 47c rn it’s the time to buy as I do not expect it to last for very long.https://www.facebook.com/watch/?extid=NS-UNK-UNK-UNK-IOS_GK0T-GK1C&v=597088554652062

"Nice to see EARNINGS jump from 5.7% in March to 7.6% in April, just as the company said it would... Now, May's dividend likely to jump back to the 10% range, as March saw a huge rise in the oil price... About time for an analyst UPGRADE, imo."

"OVERPRICED?Based on the most recent 10K, it looks like buyers are paying about nine bucks a barrel for proved reserves.Now, there have been some field extensions and discoveries over the past couple years, but there have also been some negative revisions, as well. And disappointingly, the PV10/market cap ratio is pretty weak. We're looking at 1.5x on proved developed, 3x total, and that's on $55/bbl WTI which we have not hit yet. There will be an increase in distributions due to an increase in oil prices, but I don't expect a lot. Maybe PRT will see five cents per month. I would be a buyer at $1.50, but I'm skeptical of PRT at these levels. Simply put there are better deals out there."

Has the bleeding stopped?
"Now, this is just a speculation of mine, but with the Taliban once again in control of Afghanistan, domestic security spending (specifically in western countries involved in the decades-long war) will increase. Domestic security equipment is exactly what $PRT provides in addition to their drones."

PRT has been strong the last few days so I do not think that the WSJ had that much to do with it . What is impressive is the volume and price action today in one of the worst down days in the oil sector in a while. I hope that the buyer(s) know something that we don't. I cant imagine a 4 cent dividend got a whole bunch of retail investors excited.
These oil trust are nothing but pump and dump ponzi schemes. The stock price will tank and the dividend will to. I have lost money every time. Beware!

"Was waiting for this, the WSJ printed the increased distribution in today's paper. That it doubled is no longer a secret though they still have the yield as a puny 2.5% - maybe that's a daily rate?

$5.41 and over 14% dividend. Like to see 30% dividend.
"$PRT has really been piquing my interest lately. They’re developing technology that is convenient, efficient and gives people peace of mind, like scanners that eliminate the need to remove footwear at the airport. Or imaging innovation that detects if someone is carrying weapons… like this is futuristic next-level stuff imo! Their services can be used to serve government, military, police, rescue… or for information gathering in harsh conditions, inspection of facilities and pipelines, and much more. The company prides itself on providing safety for our generation in a way that has not been done before. They actually have people’s wellbeing as their #1 priority, and I think they’re at the forefront of some really new, unique and beneficial technologies that can help serve us all.Plymouth Rock Technology up at $.28 today, market cap $14.78m!"
"This looks like an interesting play and is suffering from lack of good investor education at this time. The company has a 100% of production hedged with $60 per barrel put options, but stock is being hammered by investors focused on oil falling to $50 and the fact that Permian has issues getting oil out of area, however pipelines are coming to the area and should alleviate this and transportation costs will begin to fall. Time to follow Seth Klarman’s advice of using your ability to extend your time horizon to capture the advantages this stock has, which is the fact the transportation issues will be solved within 12 to 18 months with new pipelines, and the production is already hedged at 100% at 60 for 2018 and 76% at 60 for 2019."

"Going under 4. Oil will be $30 a barrel any day now,"
A interesting bit of information that I always like to do is divide the total production per day by the number of wells to get the average production per well per day. In this case the average daily production is 1952 barrels and the number of wells is 429. This gives a average per well per day of 4.55 barrels. The plus side of this is that a problem with one well will not affect the distributions by much. Of course there are also a lot of negatives.
"You guys may want to take a look at MVO, crunch the mumbers looks like the distribution may be more than doubling, sending unit prices up for nice gains.Just don't say nobody told you."
The .04 dividend was based on 51.00 oil price we are now up in the 60's. when oil hits 75.00 what will we be getting as a monthly dividend? Any guess?
A week it seems until the next announcement - Anyone half as bullish as me that we may get a 50% bump in the distribution?

There seems to be some mixed feeling online but personally, I think that having this extra money is really going to serve the company (and therefore shareholders) a lot.
