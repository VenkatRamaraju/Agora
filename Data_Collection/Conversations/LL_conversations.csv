The way I read the data there has been exactly 1 single insider purchase in the last year. Great vote of confidence by the company leadership?
"9:35 AM ET 09/06/2019 - ComtexThe Lumber Liquidators Value Committee, (""LLVC"" or ""the Investor Group"") led by activist investor Mario Rizzi, announces that it strongly supports company founder, Thomas D. Sullivan's recent actions and his announced intentions to reform management and to explore strategic alternatives for Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc. (NYSE: LL) (""Lumber Liquidators,"" or the ""Company""). LLVC members are deemed to beneficially own, in the aggregate, 5.7% of Lumber Liquidators' outstanding common stock.Management Errors and FailuresOver the last three years, leadership at Lumber Liquidators has made countless errors in the company's marketing and sourcing strategies and has failed at basic retail execution. Current management's brand positioning and self-proclaimed high-low retail strategy was a deviation from the company's core value proposition and has proven to be a complete failure. Board members lack retail, sourcing and turnaround experience and this has led to weak oversight and is a fundamental impediment to serving shareholder interests. Our group has tried tirelessly to engage with company leadership, however, every suggestion or proposed change we have put forward, including the appointment of an industry expert to the board, has been rejected. Meanwhile, the company persistently loses money, merchandise sales and customer traffic continue to fall and expenses have ballooned. Shareholders have suffered tremendously as shares have plunged, recently descending to an all time low.The inaction by the board is troubling and the insistence of management to persist with strategies which are clearly not showing progress and are not even being properly executed is indefensible.Time for ChangeThe Investor Group believes the magnitude of value destruction and the board's failure to hold itself and management accountable necessitate dramatic change at the company. We believe that Mr. Sullivan and his team have the knowledge and experience to conduct a comprehensive reform of company operations, management and governance leading to the substantial, positive changes necessary to realign the company's focus and strategy. We support the exploration of strategic options to ensure the future viability of the company and its return to a position of growth, profits and competitive leadership within the home improvement industry.More information about LLVC can be found at http://rebuildll.rizzicapital.com/View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190906005218/en/SOURCE: Lumber Liquidators Value CommitteeMario RizziMario@RizziCapital.comTel: 514-967-9827Copyright Business Wire 2019"

"I looked on the Edelman site. I could not find anything to corroborate the idea that Edelman has ""a specific focus on M&A, shareholder activism, and special situation circumstances,"" as Derek mentioned earlier today. I'm not saying it's not there... but I didn't see it. What I did see is that Edelman tries to improve brand performance and has talent with experience dealing with identity and crisis management. On this subject, I have just spoken with a person who works with LL, in the eastern division. Higher than store level, but not exec level. There is a lot of space there, and I won't get into detail. Concerning the earnings date, he has no idea. But according to this guy, the company has made some moves on the re-brand. From what he knows, the company is likely to re-brand as LL, rather than Lumber Liquidators (I know, it's not a big move). They hired a new agency to help with this (I assume this is Edelman). The idea seems similar to what RH did and what WW did more recently. My source specifically sent me a link to this page and he said that management has been talking about doing the same thing with LL. From what he knows, as of last week, it was not set in stone, but specific advertising for ""Lumber Liquidators"" such as print ads and banners has been limited to immediate promos and no more blanket banners are being printed, in anticipation that they will not be used in the future.Read into this what you will. To me, it makes sense. It's positive. Mildly so, for now, but it's not bad news. It's not blow-the-doors-off good news, but hey...small steps.https://www.prweek.com/article/1492944/weight-watchers-turns-edelman-handle-global-consumer-pr"
"It’s time for management to beat the drum of profitability and maximize shareholder value! How hard would it be for management to correct the inaccurate reporting? With our problems behind us, and numbers consistently getting stronger...how hard would it have been to forecast a solid year ahead? Does anyone doubt that numbers will be better than last year? How hard would it be for management to put out an enthusiastic report of profitability and growth? How many companies can boast a plan for strong growth (opening stores) at relatively low cost, while showing profits? Is all this too much to ask for? I like this management...but let’s shift gears and focus on shareholder value. This might just get us some positive analyst coverage. It is long overdue!"
"Pulling this out of reactions, as I am interested in this board's reaction to these thoughts: Thank you James for calling out the increasingly weak performance of this management team. It has been 1.5 years since Knowless was shown the gate. The numbers are theirs now...and have been for a while. Management appear to be getting beaten to the punch on sourcing and it is increasingly hard to ignore as sales lag competition. Clinging to justification to avoid offering any guidance (what a relief for them!). Losing share to FND et al on product side. PRO a long fuse initiative by their own admission. No compelling value proposition or strategy there. SGA still WAY too high. Board too relieved (and complacent) to be out of the fire from past sins to spur real action. Short interest climbing steadily, new YTD highs at each publication.This is still a good core operating model. Not that hard to add a $1 EPS and get multiple back up to 15x. Potential for a $45 share price, but not like this...new management team appears to be fumbling the ball"
It's amazing how many idiots are in the market just buying and selling stocks by looking at historical trends and the shape of a curve on a chart instead of looking at fundamentals. It's crazy.
"Searching on our name looking for news, I found this scrappy Canadian upstart. At least their IR page offers a glimmer of a rationale for investing in their stock. I also note that all of our PR drivel is released through a contractor called ""one simple plan. I wonder whether they leak our upcoming news events to the street. That'd be one simple plan for shorts to manage news risk. https://ir.builddirect.com/why-invest/default.aspx"
They finally fixed the earnings for the 4th qtr of 2020 as $1.06 on the Summary page of yahoo. Shows a beat of 56 cents instead of a miss of 10 cents. Where might the price of the stock have been if they had posted the correct data.
"IR page revamped -- New neutral colors. HTML links no longer open to whole document but to outline view. meh.Here's a tip and a fact from Ooh's almanac -- It'll take a lot more than that to improve investor sentiment. And if every page we ""redecorate"" loses some of its functionality, it'll be a real drag on web-based sales for weeks if not quarters. But hey, if it gets rid of Tom Sullivan's signature yellow, it'll be worth it -- that is, to our ad agency, and our marketing interns trying to write their resumes.Separately, checking options this morning after nearly a week, I note over 1500 contracts changed hands yesterday, with an atypically high third of that in out-of-money puts expiring in the next ten days. If it's true that puts expire worthless because most of their volume is sold by people in the know, then the next week or so should show no further drops in price. Free advice worth every penny ..."
"Dedicated longs, April 30th might just be our turning point. Recent price action is pointing that way."
James?? what do your charts say. 1mm+ shares and a close toward the high seems awesome??
"LL really needs to make an announcement here, some decisive moves. Expanded store hours, new sales compensation plan to boost sales, announcement of closing a few dog locations, something. My guy feel is new CFO Nancy is making an impact. This is a good thing if she is engaged, which I think she is. Time will tell but I'm hoping this is the beginning of many steps in the right direction."
"Should test the ~20.40 mark -- if it doesn't break, it should be a good short-term buy."
"LL launches online floor visualizer tool for consumers to see how LL flooring will look in their homes . . . Nice! Also, seeing lots of ads for LL on TV right now, promoting annual (40% off) April flooring sale. Slowly it turns . . ."

"LL outperformed FND and TTSH this quarter and they have a fraction of the PE.They are in a win-win situation. The economy opens up, they have better in home services, economy closes down, they have more DIY renovation purchases. Pro sells grew faster than DIY did this quarter."

fewest number of shares traded on Friday than ever before at least for the last year
"What if the big players aren't even able to get in. Say someone buys or sells 100,000 shares for 2 mill at a time. they would have to buy much smaller lots as even a 10,000 purchase causes the price to jump with so few shares being traded. A set price would also stick out as suddenly the price would stick to say 20.22 and not go lower but might start jumping up. I'm just not that knowledgeable of how the big players put in their buy orders. My guess is with no news they ignore the likes of poor little LL."
"Over 100,000 shares traded in the last 5 minutes"
"Last quarter, we crushed everything it it went down. We now have a P/E of under 10.... The market is simply wrong here."
"Apparently on Monday Judge Rhonda found in our favor that our case should go forward rather than be dismissed. Of course the company can't find the time to share that fact with shareholders, letting us instead trade in the dark. The way this management deliberately conceals facts from shareholders until the last possible minute is one of the biggest reasons they need to be removed. But I'm sure they have no problem discussing the unknown-to-the-public public information with their analyst friends who feed it all to the shorts.

"Today's options review. While the open interest leans toward puts, 24896 calls to 43092 puts, this imbalance is mostly due to the one mega position of 16306 August 16 $14 puts. Still, today's volume ran almost three to one toward the calls, 2051 to 774. The trading in calls was not concentrated on any single strike, suggesting either several buyers/writers or a more limited number of buyers/writers spreading their trades opportunistically around the strike prices. Three quarters of the call volume was in either the August 9 or August 16 expirations. Not sure what it all means, but for buyers of the calls, it's a way to limit their exposures to price spikes if short, and if naked, it's a way to buy LL at a discount if the price increases. For sellers of the calls, it could be an attempt to fund a larger share purchase by scalping an option premium for a sale at a guaranteed gain. But what do I know?"
@James. What are your thoughts?
"In case, anyone is breathing easy, here's another way for Knowles to screw up and for shareholders to get screwed.We all know the tariffs are usually billed as ""across the board"". But when you go to the trade representative's site, you find long lists of excluded products, usually with incredibly specific descriptions. I'm sure that nothing in the official description would say so but I believe these exclusions are favors being granted to specific industries and companies. The art of the deal is to get an exception granted for the product you sell, but to word the exception so that your competition has to go on paying the tariff or redesign their product to match yours. E.g., ""(10) Inflatable kayaks and canoes, with over 20 gauge polyvinyl chloride (PVC), each valued at $500 or less and weighing not over 22 kg (described in statistical reporting number 8903.10.0060)”"" It's a sure bet that the company that requested this exception, imports kayaks over 20 gauge, weighing under 22 kg, and likes the price point of $500. But what's less obvious is whether their competitor's kayaks are under 20 gauge, over 22 kg, and sell for $600.What all this has to do with LL is this. We need our crack team of lawyers to follow this and make sure we aren't cut out of any relief on tariffs. That assumes of course they can find the time after their more important duties. Between writing up generous offers after the close of each quarter that just happen to be of an amount that neatly eliminates any earnings left after Dennis picks out new office furniture, and the yoga lessons for the flexibility needed to bow, scrape and low-crawl into and out of the courtroom, I'm sure Reeves is very busy. I guess he will decide to hire more lawyers."
Any chance of HD buying this?
"Meanwhile, up in Dane County, Wisconson the wheels of justice continue to grind slowly, and presumably finely. In today's court record, another out of state attorney, Timothy H Wright, has been granted pro hac vice privileges.

Tim advises clients on making coverage determinations, drafting coverage position letters and litigating coverage actions. He addresses coverage issues for underlying claims, ranging from mass torts and pollution losses to actions against nursing care facilities and managed care organizations. His practice includes advising insurers on claims arising under various liability insurance policies, including commercial general liability, excess, professional and pollution liability. """
Slowing comps and no direct guidance. Gross margin down. Should see ~15 this week.

"So. After years of trailing FND's big box store model with its warehouse efficiency at the expense of massive headcount per store, LL has decided to match up with FND by ... ? A. Introducing our own large format stores, to provide a head to head comparable shopping experience with local logistic support for current smaller stores, and maximum selection and inventory for pros, all targeted toward markets that FND currently relies on?B. An improved version of its Altamonte store format, leveraging whatever we learned from that two year experiment?C. A program to increase our share of distribution by linking up with top independent flooring retailers through alternative business models like franchising, licensing, supplying our Bellawood brand, and similar arrangements?D. Returning to our pre-Knowles reliance on sales promotion to move off-trend product, and regular ads promising the great savings our small store network is designed for? Or is it ...?E. Renting tiny expensive storefronts to be staffed by the same number of associates without inventory where shoppers can use the same online tools as their phones have? You can't make this stuff up ..."
"And finally, because Yahole is too ""safe and engaging"" to let anyone say anything about the Kabul evacuation anywhere but here in the finance pages, one has to wonder why our cavernous cargo planes are evacuating some 600 to 800 people sitting on the floor, when they could easily load them with one or two levels of empty shipping containers and thereby haul nearly twice or three times as many passengers."
I thought to sell at $37…but did not think there was a better valued stock to move my money to. What are your targets? End of year? 1 yr? 3yrs?
"A few points from the earnings call that really hammered home their progress:1. Pro sales blew up this quarter and management seems optimistic about future development of their pro sales pilot project. Many annoying shorts repeatedly claimed the company needed pro sales, believing that only pro sale dollars are worth a dollar and DIY is not. We can put to bed the pro sales stagnation story.2. Installation services were significantly up due to people willing to have contractors in the home. This is a nice counterbalance to the reopening.3. While supply chains are a nightmare, gross margins were down only 90 basis points and operating margins were up. This mostly eliminates supply chain fears. 4. Revenues not only smashed YoY, but even demolished Q1 figures. Shorts always yammering about needing top line growth, well here you go.I think we also must be pleased with the balance sheet, they sliced off an incredible amount of debt this quarter. Nice job management!"
"I'm a manager at an LL in New York. The city is on lock down, but we consider ourselves to be an essential service, so we are completely open and I can tell you, there are lineups out the door. I have heard reports that some locations are actually running out of stock and have temporarily shut down and papered over their showroom windows as they await a restock. This lock-down period has certainly been busy for LL. Also, a new development is that some locations (mine included) have started to sell carpet. It just made sense to introduce this product line since we basically cornered the market for every other type of flooring and this was a natural progression. I have seen a good ramp in carpet sales this week. My location still has only a limited number of carpet SKUs but the best sellers so far are in the plush, wood look category. As has been mentioned, the April sale is a go and with guidance from corporate we actually think it might be the best April on record. All in all, I couldn't ask for anything more."
Great play for Tom Sullivan --- he lines himself up with some private capital and makes a serious play for the company. If he succeeds and gets control he can take it private (and eventually cash out when they sell to another party) -- alternatively there are other bidders interested and the price goes up and he makes out on his initial investment --- either way he wins
I think it is time for Dennis Knowles to go. His appointment didn't excite investors the least bit and for good reason. Now after 3-4 years on the job and the stock price still languishing at $11. LL need to poach a top Home Depot executive or someone who is a superstar or a rising star in the home improvement sector. I don't know who that person is but we need new leadership.

"If you're a new investor looking at LL for the first time today, you really need to do your homework. Before you buy, go to the Lumber Liquidators Value Committee site to read about the mistakes that have been made by this management, and the plan to get things back on track. Then, if you decide to buy, be sure to join. This company will be driven into bankruptcy in two years or less if management doesn't change. And that can't happen unless the Board changes sides and begins to represent shareholders.http://rebuildll.rizzicapital.com/"

"The CEO and staff continue to deliver really solid earning. They have repaired the balance sheet, have positive cash flow and earning, are opening new stores. I find all your negativity somewhat misguided. Many times a companies value is not reflective of the current stock price, in my eyes thats called opportunity. Eventually if management continues to deliveer the stock price will catch up and reflect the valur of the business."
"Oppenheimer's Brian Nagel maintains an Outperform rating on Lumber Liquidators' stock with an unchanged $43 price target. Shares of Lumber Liquidators were under heavy selling pressure Monday after Wedbush downgraded the stock from Outperform to Neutral ahead of its fourth-quarter report Feb. 27 — a call which Oppenheimer disagrees with.Lumber Liquidators could report a ""lackluster"" earnings report later this month, but Nagel said in a Tuesday note he would be ""hard-pressed"" to conclude that the company's recovery is derailed. Three factors support the stance, the analyst said:Commentary on the third-quarter conference call made it clear the underlying operational and financial structure of Lumber Liquidators' supply chain improved significantly.Management guided a mid-to-upper single digit comp gain in Q4.The overall flooring sector continues to see solid demand, as evidenced by outsized growth in the carpet and other floor coverings category.Lumber Liquidators could offer a guidance outlook for 2018 that would give Nagel the opportunity to ""better reassess our call on the shares from here,"" he said."
"Norma totally disappeared after the last earnings - would be nice to hear from her. I haven't been on for a while, but I did speak with the closes LL to me in Colorado a couple weeks ago and they had been having some issues with getting product - actually what appeared to me as pretty significant issues. I tried to buy 3 different kinds of wood for a high end condo I have in a ski town and they couldn't get any for a number of months. I use this property as an investment property and since this is the off season, I had to go with a different source. Based on the price action, I surmize that I am not the only one with this issue and also that analysts have figured that out as well. They did say it looked like things were picking back up again but they definitely had delivery issues in the 1st quarter."
"Join our movement to change things at Lumber Liquidators. We are the only game in town. At this point, LL management doesn't even care about shareholders, as can be evidenced by their complete silence as the share price dropped 35% in the last 12 days.

"About breaking even. It's worth remembering that getting your money back, without interest, is an insult. (Matthew 25:14-30) Wall Street likes to brag about 8% returns over the long term even though their most docile, compliant investors who buy and hold long term only achieve about half that. The reason why is hidden in the very fact they misleadingly use as an argument for staying fully invested - that if you missed just the ten best days for the Dow during your lifetime of investing, you would have zero or negative returns. Note that they never make the corresponding argument that by missing the ten worst days, you could double that 8% to 16%, which is just as much a fact. The hidden reason those days are the key to returns for Wall Street but not for investors is that those days occur at the worst time for investors (but not for Wall Street). The market leaps when investors are tapped out. And it dives when we're all in. Wall Street ridicules market timers, even though their market timing against investors is the core of their business model. So, unless you have a job that pays you more during a recession, and less during boom times, you're never going to get ahead of the market by dollar-cost averaging your paychecks. You're going to have to make the most of the times you're winning, and minimize your losses, and you can't get a clear idea what's going on unless you calculate your gains after interest. Suppose you think that for all you've been through with LL you should dare to earn that fabled 8% annualized, probably to make up for other investments that do worse than LL. (And yes, it's very possible) Then you'd need to multiply your ""cost"" by 1.08 for every year you've been holding LL. (Sure, if you bought $1000 worth in 2013, and another $1000 in 2020, then your ""average"" number of years would only be 3.5, (7+0)/2.) So if your cost was $14.25 and you'd been holding for that 3.5 years, then you'd need 1.309 times that $14.25, or $18.66. (1.08^3.5 = 1.309) I don't know how long it will take to reach the $18's, or if it will even ever happen. But It's important not misunderstand and sell at a loss, thinking you're gaining ground when you're really not."

On 12/3 this stock traded at $8.45 and moved up to $11.18 by 12/12 based on the new tariff news. Nothing else has changed since that time frame. One analyst with a negative rating shouldn't be able to manipulate the stock this much. This is clearly over sold.
"Today's search for news finds the following local news story out of Charlotte, NC, that I think calls into question the wisdom of settling groundless lawsuits as class actions.It seems that members of the class settlement are disappointed that the amounts they've been awarded is less than the cost of their floors. Now, even though this was mathematically obvious as soon as the settlement amount was agreed to by the plaintiffs lawyers, it still comes back as a criticism of LL. Sure, we settled for peanuts and bigged up the dollar amount by throwing in generous amounts for vouchers. But our legal team's too-clever-by-half strategery didn't keep our settlement out to the news when we first penned the deal, when plaintiffs disputed the amount going to their lawyers, or now when the meager checks arrive. What is also interesting is the video's flooring defects don't seem to have to do with the flooring itself but with gaps in the shoe molding and some weird caulking on what appears to be either T-molding or an end cap. The floor is still in use so they must not hate it that much. A savvy local store manager would send a team out there to renail and recaulk the trim and thereby win the news cycle. But I'm sure the hip young millennials we hire don't watch local news.

"The shorts on here try to add a lot od noise. The moral of the story is that they arr growing in revenues and free cash flow. This is where the value of a business stands. They've done so in the face of a pandemic, tarifs, and increased shipping costs. These expenses will revert to the mean over time. However, CAGR for hard flooring products is predicted to grow around 8% in this market. They've crawled out of legal entanglements, and in time their PE multiple should return to the sector average. James is upset because he's shorted the stock when it's gone up 186% YoY. James, my heart goes out to you and your friends."

"I could post this as a reply to any of a dozen messages from last week cheering the uptick in price. Many are saying that we will be seeing higher prices from now on. I know they think that. But I don't think anyone knows that.I only make the counterargument so that no one gets drawn into a quick trade that doesn't work out and so longs don't fixate on seeing the rally that began last week as ""one last chance"" for LL. I once commented that LL has always been a drama queen equity swinging more than necessary even before the Formaldehype, and that it would like continue swinging more than necessary. I wish I had listened to my advice.But, about the volumes and the options and the roughly 15% price swing last week. I assume that the institutions who short stocks have to report on the same quarterly basis other businesses do and that the end of year collapse LL saw would have been booked as a gain for the short side. After the tariff war didn't become a shooting war, the earnings call swoon was the chance for them to cover the position they booked at year end, but that was a little overdone and probably more of a attempt to cover the long short from way back when. Remember, the short position is not covered when shorts dump shares on each other to beat the price down. It's only covered when longs sell at the bottom. And while I can't speak for everyone, the annual call was really more of the same. The Bamboo deal was overpriced, but water over the dam and a long awaited resolution, however expensive. Which left the possibility of an insurance settlement and a tariff agreement as upsides. So I don't think any real money was made on the short side in March. With a month's advance notice on LLVC's ""open"" letter, an inside position at the Wisconsin district court, and the ability to time Whitney Tilson's errand of dramatically (no offense) switching teams (oops, did it again), it would be an easy thing for the short team to adjust their positions and their options on a holiday- shortened end of week session when individual investors are paying attention to family and other real-world concerns. So last week's action could be the big shorts resetting their basis while we were distracted, and setting up their next big push to the downside. If that is what happens, expect it to be supported by news events that no one but the most connected people could have known. And also know that when shorts start dumping shares on each other and the price goes down that doesn't mean that longs have lost or that the short position has been covered. That only happens when enough longs sell to let someone own enough LL to make it worth their while to start the pump higher. As the longest long, I should root for the rest of you to give up, so that my recovery can start. But like the squirrels the attic in the ad for Buffett's GEICO, it's personal this time. I don't want any longs to lose a dollar because that's a dollar earned by the shorts.And the best way for longs to make money is to getti rid of this slow-moving, check-writing, no-growth management team someone installed to make sure the MDLs and the shorts would get paid off. VOTE NO ON EVERYTHING!!!"
Let's see if they make me take assignment on the $18 puts I wrote on 9/23 for $0.26 credit.
"Oh, boy! The Culture part of the call!!!"
"No time for an extended rant -- gotta be brief. If any new investor thinks the last seven day's new heights and volumes behind plunging day-traders are hinky, welcome to the elementary school of hard knocks. The previous seven weeks' beatdown over the name and lack of volume behind tariff relief was the setup and is your high school curriculum. The previous seven month's swings behind malware, Sullivan, the tariff terror, and legal fake-news/old news is a college course. And that means the past seven years -- the post-IPO cuddling, the buy-back pay-back for early investors, Sullivan's hubris to ruin someone's carve-up of TTS by threatening to buy it after earlier threatening to run for president, the following media and regulatory (and later judicial) takedown, the creation of a home-improvement ETF for side-bets, the financial immaculation-coronation-ascension of FND -- all that is PhD rocket science.As far as the conference call, I only listened to it once, although I plan to listen again while reading and editing the transcript. But I don't recall ever hearing the chairman of the board sit in -- that signals change. And I haven't heard the suits effusively praise the sales team since Tom's final conference call when he said ""Sell more wood!"". I didn't feel the earth move. But I think I felt a tingle up my leg. Fingers crossed.Finally, I spent a little time on the website checking out the Floor-finder. Starting out playacting as someone at the earliest planning phase, I found the detail lacking but judged it a good intro into the subject for someone not yet ready to get into the weeds. I was disappointed that the level of detail and information was the same regardless of my level of project commitment. I'd rate it a baby step in the right direction. Tirerack, IMO, sets the standard for balancing basic, minimal info for casual buyers and unlimited detail for enthusiasts. There's a lot of work to be done. It's a target rich environment for improvements to our business. No need to despair, just now. All in my opinion, of course. GLTAL! EEFOAD!"
Who cares about fundamentals…classic fishhook dongle upswing angular pattern…shorts are running scared!
"Lumber Liquidators stock price target raised to $14 from $10 at Raymond James7:13 am ET September 13, 2019 (MarketWatch)"
"Obviously something is not right fundamentally either. If you were to break this down on a per store valuation, each store is worth less than $1.5mm, which means that if it were privately valued each store would have to make say more or less $300k at a 5 multiple and that would be about $120mm per year which is not happening"
"Shares of flooring name Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc (NYSE:LL) are up 5.2% at $13.91 this morning, after being handed no fewer than three bull notes right out of the gate. Loop Capital reiterated its ""hold"" rating on the stock, and lifted its price target to $11 from $10, citing modestly better-than expected results and potential long-term growth as its catalyst. Meanwhile, Raymond James upgraded to ""outperform"" from ""market perform"" alongside a $16 price target, and Stifel tacked on $3 to its former $9 price target. This upbeat analyst buzz comes one day after Lumber Liquidators reported a first-quarter loss that was wider than expected.Analyst outlook was tepid coming into today, as all 12 firms covering LL sported ""hold"" ratings. Today's bull notes may have been well overdue, however, as the equity's average 12-month price target of $11.73 represents 15.6% downside to current levels.Digging deeper, short-term LL options traders have been showing a preference for puts. The security's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of 4.09 sits in the 98th percentile of its annual range, meaning short-term option players have rarely been more put-heavy during the past year.Echoing this sentiment is the stock's 10-day put/call volume ratio at the International Securities Exchange (ISE), Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and NASDAQ OMX PHLX (PHLX), which comes in at 1.96. This shows almost two puts have been purchased for every call in the past 10 days.Lumber Liquidators is just off a long-term downtrend, turning higher just after hitting a 10-year low of $8.80 on March 18. In fact, following today's surge LL shares are on track to close above the 200-day moving average for the first time since January 2018."
Here is a short candidate… up 8% today. Due for a 50% correction. My gift to you. $LL.
"So the delay in announcing earnings, coupled with the recent price action, really has me curious. No idea, but good luck longs!"
Anyone compare LL and FND price to book value? I was shocked to see LL's P/B was 1/5 that of FND's.
Wow. We did go over 1mm - 5th time this year. Interesting that the stock is up 15% on only 1.6mm shares. Let's hope the news is good.
"Between 2009 thru 2014 the annual reports include comments from the ceo of LL listed below. LL hit over $100 a share in September of 2013 on annual earnings in 2012 of $1.68 per share and in 2013 of $2.77 per share. Can LL get to $100 per share again. I sure hope so.2009 Financial HighlightsIn 2009, through our powerful store model and the coordinated efforts of our entire organization, we continued to gain market share in the highly fragmented wood flooring market and realized notable financial achievements. Specifically, we are proud of the following financial accomplishments for the full year:• Net sales growth of 12.9% to $544.6 million;• Increase in our calculation of the number of customers invoiced at our comparable stores of 12.4%;• Gross margin expansion of 90 basis points to 35.7%;• Operating margin expansion of 30 basis points to 8.0%; and• Fully-diluted earnings per share of $0.97 2010 Financial Highlights In 2010, as consumers continued to face weak economic conditions, customers continued to seek value,including a lower retail price point. We tailored our marketing programs throughout the year and were pleased to serve a greater number of these customers in our comparable stores during the year. Our low-cost store model in which new stores quickly become profitable allowed us to achieve our expansion goals for the year, as we opened 37 new stores. Specifically, we achieved:• Net sales growth of 13.9% to $620.3 million;• Comparable store net sales increase of 2.1%;• Increase in our calculation of the number of customers invoiced at our comparable stores of 4.5%;• Gross margin of 34.8%;• Operating margin of 6.8%; and• Fully-diluted earnings per share of $0.932011 Financial HighlightsDuring 2011, our strategic initiatives, including those in sourcing, drove an expansion in our second half operating margin. While the macroeconomic environment remained challenging with consumers continuing to be cautious and price sensitive with regard to large-ticket discretionary purchases, we drove positive traffic throughout the year, and in the fourth quarter of 2011, traffic was positive at comparable stores. Further, we continued to gain market share in our highly fragmented wood flooring market, primarily through new store openings. Specifically, for the full year we reported:• Net sales growth of 9.9% to $681.6 million;• Gross margin expansion of 50 basis points to 35.3%;• Operating margin of 6.2%; and• Fully diluted earnings per share of $0.932012 Financial HighlightsIn 2012, we built a strong foundation upon which we can generate sustainable growth. For the full year, we achieved:• Net sales growth of 19.3% to $813.3 million;• Comparable store net sales growth of 11.4%;• Gross margin expansion of 270 basis points to 38.0%;• Operating margin expansion of 340 basis points to 9.6%; and• Net income increase of 79% to $47.1 million, or $1.68 per diluted share.2013 Financial Highlights The strong support infrastructure that we have built over the past several years through ongoing investment in our value proposition of price, selection, quality, availability and the expertise of our people enabled our motivated sales team to deliver outstanding results. In what we consider a truly special year for Lumber Liquidators, we delivered: - Net sales growth of 23.0% to $1.0 billion; - Comparable store net sales growth of 15.8%; - Gross margin expansion of 310 basis points to a record 41.1%; - Operating margin expansion of 300 basis points to a record 12.6%; - and Net income increase of 64.4% to $77.4 million, or $2.77 per diluted share. 2014 Financial Highlights In 2014, we focused on infrastructure investment, enhanced customer perception and store expansion, all of which will help propel growth. Despite the headwinds of 2014, our team delivered a solid year: - Net sales growth of 4.7% to $1.05 billion; - 34 new stores, bringing our total to 352 stores in 46 states and Canada; and - Fully diluted earnings per share of $2.31"
"I was wondering if someone might join me in a hypothetical. Let's assume they are awarded the full 14M in the lawsuit that was recently listed as ""dismissed"". That is about 20% of their trailing twelve month income of 70M. What affect would that have, if any, if they in fact are on track for a declining forward PE (1.4 vs 2.3 of last year)?"
"And finally, I'll repost another even more sanitized version of my post pointing out that LL's earnings multiple is a reflection of deeply negative sentiment toward the stock. And our management has to own that sentiment, even if Doug Moore chooses not to own the stock on whose board he sits.I'll post it serial style so we can figure out what so alarms the Ya-hole censors."

The pattern is easier to see when looking at the percent of total shares across the different outcomes.% of outstanding year for against abstain broker sum 2021 66% 2.2% 0.1% 17% 85%2020 33% 6.0% 4.5% 42% 85%2019 38% 9.9% 2.5% 41% 91%2018 46% 2.1% 0.2% 44% 93%2017 38% 4.8% 0.2% 49% 92%2016 35% 5.7% 0.6% 44% 85%2015 50% 1.6% 1.9% 29% 82%2014 87% 1.3% 0.1% 8% 96%2013 82% 0.2% 0.2% 13% 96%2012 79% 0.3% 1.9% 13% 95%2011 86% 0.3% 0.0% 7% 93%Such a large change could be due to either a doubling of support among a stable group of ongoing investors, a massive turnover of investors with half toward more favorable ones, or a massive change in voting procedure, rules or communication with investors about the vote. As it turns out, what changed mostly was number of broker non-votes (shares whose owners did not indicate voting wishes before the counting). That and the increased turnout of voters broke heavily toward supporting management and toward say on pay. Subtracting each previous year's percents to focus on the change to and from each answer choice shows this clearly.Change in % from prev year. year for against abstain broker sum 2021 33% -3.8% -4.4% -25% 0%2020 -5% -3.9% 2.0% 1% -6%2019 -8% 7.8% 2.3% -3% -2%2018 8% -2.7% 0.0% -5% 1%2017 3% -0.9% -0.4% 5% 7%2016 -15% 4.1% -1.3% 15% 3%2015 -37% 0.3% 1.8% 21% -14%2014 5% 1.1% -0.1% -5% 0%2013 3% -0.1% -1.7% 0% 1%2012 -7% 0.0% 1.9% 6% 2%The big change was the collapse in the recorded number of ""broker non-votes"", on the magnitude of 25% of all shares. This, when added to the declines in ""No"" votes (against) and abstentions (submitted proxies with a deliberate absence of a vote on the pay-say issue) both equalling 4% of shares, gives a never-before-seen increase in support for management pay of 33%, equal to one-third of outstanding shares. Such a large change in voting behavior must have been driven by something, and I need to check FND and a few other companies' annual meeting voter patterns versus previous years, before concluding that this only happened to LL voting. After all, Covid's virtual meetings and the new generation of Robinhooders should drive some differences across all companies. But I'd think increased turnout of 25% and pay approval increases of 33% across even a third of companies would get noticed by the media. (Or should.)FWIW, the change in the past six year's percent for vs. against say on pay for LL is roughly half explained by the change in share price from roughly 500 trading days before the vote. But that still doesn't explain the decline in broker non-votes.-- Continued in replies --"
Anyone know where they list the percent interest they were paying on that 101M credit line they just payed off? I'm really interested to find out?
"Not sure if anybody has noticed, but the LL website landing page (front page) has been redesigned lately and it looks great. Use the internet archive to see what the page looked like last year, 6 months ago and a month ago, and compare it to what it looks like today. It's a complete difference and it's 100% better.Before, the front page was used to advertise specific deals and flooring products. The new page advertises general promotions and flooring categories. It's not just semantics. It's a completely different approach and it makes a lot more sense.I love the idea of the Top Categories being front an center. The photos are larger and the images are properly adjusted to be appealing. And it makes so much more sense to advertise a general sale (President's Day sale) rather than just 49 cent laminates, etc.I won't say it's a breakthrough. A web designer could have made the modification in a few hours. But I think in terms of flow and click appeal, it will have an impact. The digital catalog is also right at the top of the page instead of being buried at the bottom like before. They are even integrating instagram photos. This is basic stuff these days, but it is also stuff that was seriously missing on the LL site before. And now we seem to have a web team which is making changes and trying. There is definitely more to do, but at least there is progress. Think about it this way, the website and marketing approach was stagnant for a decade. Now there is movement. Very late, but still. I didn't want to bury this point, but I would like to note that from my research, calling stores and speaking with a few managers, it seems that the install services in the northeast are booked well into March. The regional sales manager is supposedly hiring extra subcontractors to take on the workload. I don't know how the rest of the regions are doing, but the northeast is strong."
"One of the most surprising quarters I have seen from LL. Incredible top line growth and margins. They actually beat Q1! I was planning on holding through earnings when I should have been selling puts. I think we all need to reasses their strategy. Their biggest concern moving forward was supply chain, but I honestly feel like that will be less of an issue in the second half, at least in Q4. When is the last time this company didn't beat expectations? I haven't had a chance to dive into the actual earnings report, but I bet this will be a good one."
"When catalina marketing estimates the hard surface flooring market increased at 11% and LL's material sales comped below 5% I would not exactly call it a great quarter. FND is grabbing share massively. As they indicated in the call their market share is well over 30% in mature markets. Now some of LL's problems are self-imposed: poor inventory management, too cautious during COVID but not entirely management's fault as they were in a precarious financial position at the start of the pandemic, brand change in the middle of the hottest market in decades (completely management's fault), and market pricing mistakes that makes them uncompetitive vs big box and FND.the good news is the balance sheet is finally fixed, and now LL just needs to replenish its inventory. Unfortunately, the moved out of China too quickly as container shortages are even more acute in SE Asia vs China. This should be resolved in the next couple of quarters, but they may surrender a lot more share to FND. Once LL gets its inventory back to normal, pays off its legacy debt and its term loan, it will be out of cash, but can then begin to recapture lost market share. Hopefully, the COVID boom is still chugging along!Good luck"
Suspect supply chain issues will devastate this stock at earnings announcements
Cannot figure out how this can move so much on almost no volume?

"My local edition of the LL homepage has upped the sale ante to 25% off for the fall sale and has dropped the appeal for new employees, formerly at the bottom just before the IR link.That doesn't seem like a company with its supply chain disrupted.

"This pop to $17 is nice. But Laura Champine in particular, and Loop Capital in general, are such lightweights that their upgrade is an excuse for a move that needed to happen, not the cause for one. The real catalysts; an insurance settlement, an M&A deal to erase debt, or a reorg to cut Knowles's overhead, -- those are still only blowing in the wind. No SEC filings. The only news announced in Wisconsin is St. Paul's supplemental Brief on Choice of Law, which looks routine. So it looks like today we are no closer to any of the possible improvements to the fundamentals. Today feels like a return to the stock's previous gyrations, or even a setup raising expectations for earnings, to be followed by disappointment. I aim to make a lot more money than today's $3.50. So I'm looking to roll today's gains into more shares, if it breaks that way. But it would be really odd, for this stock, to have good news announced by an analyst that led to a lasting increase in price. It's never that simple, or that kind to investors. GLTAL!"
I will again plead for calm and reason. it's easy to submit to fear when shares are battered. but facts are still facts. the reduction/elimination of legal and associated fees makes LL much more profitable.
"Stock WILL be single digits by EOY. If they continue to beat earnings, and the price still goes down; well then there's nothing that's gonna help!!!SHORT!!!!!"
"In other news, Joy Reid has called out the inherent racism of the Gabby Petito coverage as ""missing white woman syndrome"".

"Hmm amazing this #$%$ has retraced this far. Geez they have over $100mm in cash and a $9.00 book value - one would think a group could use the company cash in a takeover bid. I wonder if fundamentally going forward, things are really that bad. The fact we have no institutional interest even at these levels is concerning."
We can attribute their gains today to their disdain for hiring white males. Their commitment to hiring based on traits born innately and superfluous to their ability to sell flooring is a clear path to success.
"James, it is hanging above the moving average with no volume. What is your take? Cheers."
The company has a price to free cash flow of less than 5. None of the other stocks in my portfolio come close to that.
"Yesterday I shut up, and LL shot up. But I also shut up Friday when it tanked. So at the risk of jinxing more gains, I wonder if anyone has any hypotheses about our moving higher when the marker driving news of the day is the prospect of higher interest rates denting the growth heavy Nasdaq. The news of higher rates must not signal a particular risk for flooring or FND would be trending with us. And if increasing rates are affecting the more indebted stocks, that doesn't explain the resilience in the oil patch.So is the link between LL's price and the time value of money due to that money having been bet against LL and presumably having to unwind those bets when ZIRP ends?Or is yesterday's bounce for LL just the front half of one of the market's regular pump and dump stunts before bad news?Or maybe the second half of the opposite scam of smash and grab before good news? After all we've taken quite a dip in the week or two leading up to yesterday. And we know that a major lawsuit settled ..."
Anybody notice how good value stocks have done this last little while. My portfolio has beefed up quite a bit lately

Pretty wild dip today. I don't know what's driving this. My local store is very busy. We should see good quarterly results and guidance. NYT talks about a strong economic rebound with vaccinations rolling out at a good pace. Most people with professional jobs will be able to work from home (at least partially) going forward. If anything commercial office space will tank. But homes - that should remain a stronghold for the foreseeable future.
"Remember small, cheap stocks? Hardly anyone else does, either. And yet, they're sparking a huge rally after being dead money for years.Don't worry, you didn't miss out. Eight stocks including consumer discretionary companies Lumber Liquidators (LL), GameStop (GME), MarineMax (HZO) and Tupperware Brands (TUP), driving huge gains, are still in the S&P SmallCap 600 Value index.All these are still in the index for small, cheap stocks even after doubling, or more, this year and rising more than 5% in November alone, says an Investor's Business Daily analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence and MarketSmith.Looking at the small, cheap stocks with the top gains shows some important trends. Many are taking on leadership positions in the market.Six of the eight S&P SmallCap 600 Value stocks up more than 100% this year and 5% this month sport IBD Composite Ratings of 90 or higher. This means their stock appreciation and fundamentals outperform 90% of all other stocks. They've all of these relatively cheap stocks been outperforming, even though their asset class (small value) has suffered.Take Lumber Liquidators. This is a $900 million-in-market-value stock that's up 204% in 2020 so far. The company is benefiting from strong demand for new homes. And just this month, the stock is up 34%. Plus, analysts think the company's profit will jump this year. All this explains Lumber Liquidator's strong 96 IBD Composite Rating, out of 99."
"In reviewing FND's pre-announcement for 'Q4, it's hard for me to fathom how Lumber Liquidators doesn't crush sales estimates. Floor and Decor announced revenue of approximately 388MM, up almost 13% over the prior quarter and 24.4% comp sales growth from prior year. Earnings estimates were 0.44. While LL's growth rate is slower (mid-to-high single digits for comp sales growth, its sales estimates are $264 million, just slightly higher than the third quarter's 257MM. Clearly, the industry had a great quarter in the fourth quarter, as the hurricanes, which hurt 'Q3 numbers will boost 'Q4 and the current quarter. If we get just a 5% bump in sales from the prior quarter, we will well exceed revenue estimates. Expenses should be more in line with 'Q2, and any one-time legal costs would have been disclosed already. It seems likely that, just as the analysts failed to consider 1) the impact of the hurricane and 2) a one-time legal settlement in the last earnings report, they should fail to see how 'Q4 would benefit on a comparable basis. Its my opinion that 'Q3 was the last money losing quarter for a long time, unless we have another one-time legal settlement. In 'Q2 we made 0.16 in earnings, versus current quarter estimates of 0.09. Let's all cross our fingers, but LL can't miss this quarter."

If Knowles was doing a good job, or showing progress, or even if the company was still performing badly but the stock was up, I would be relatively happy. But the fact of the matter is that it will soon be 4 years since Knowles started working at LL (March 2016), and not only has company performance been pathetic, but the stock price is near an all time low. We can go into all sorts of nuance to make excuses for the poor financials, but the bottom line is that quarter after quarter, Knowles has stated that his turnaround strategy is moving forward and taking hold, but nothing positive has ever come from it. 4 years now, and we have nothing to see but continued loses and a single digit stock price. And does anybody know that the turnaround strategy really is? Every quarter it is something different. Can anybody tell me two or three points from the strategy that Knowles speaks of? Supposedly we were to get news during the analyst day, but the geniuses in IR cancelled it (Great job Paul).So here were are, as shareholders, with 4 years of lost growth. 4 years of loses (over $200 million). 4 years of terrible stock returns. 4 years when our largest competitor, FND, has executed flawlessly and become almost twice as large as LL (and is now worth 20 times as much with 1/4 of the stores). 4 years of turnaround promises. And 4 years of turnaround failure. And these 4 years coincide with Dennis Knowles coming to the company. At what point should shareholders say, maybe it's time for a new CEO? At what point should shareholders say, Dennis, you're a nice guy and it's been a wild ride, but it's just not working?Do we give Knowles another 3 months? Can we be generous and say, if you cannot deliver positive comps in the 3% range for Q1 2020, then you have to leave? At some point, we have to call it, right?"
"I predicted earnings of $0.39, and they exceeded by expectations at $0.41. This company continues to deliver solid cash-flow in just about every environment. And, they have virtually no debt!If we had a normal multiple, we would be in the 40s."

"It needs to be said again, since LL management refuses to say so, that we have apparently reached a settlement in our lawsuit with our product liability insurers who refused to pay five years ago.This ought to be in the eight figure range, at least, and if so will add between $.30 and $3 a share as a settlement. It also should lead to lower overhead expense for legal costs.""08-11-2021 Letters/correspondence Additional text: from Atty Jacobs in RE - Parties have stipulated.

"When I complain about this stock, the other side of the argument seems to be ""It's not that easy to run a business"" or ""How could they have done any better?""My regular searches for some glimmer of news or the merest mirror-fogging sign of life discovered yet another competitor - BestLaminate. To read their webpage, which also has our floor visualizer capability BTW, becoming a pretty significant player in flooring is as easy as throwing a few pallets of flooring into the family shipping container during a move from Europe, selling those fast enough to justify renting a space, moving that project online, and promising to match anyone's price. Now, I'm sure some newer longs are wondering why our Richmond brain trust hasn't tried that yet. But older longs will remember when that's exactly what we did and exactly how we built this business, with sales growth and store growth etc. before Tom Sullivan was forced out. And since he got cancelled for formaldehyde, the current management has to do the opposite and undo everything they inherited. (Deja vu, much?)But somebody, somewhere, with a few pallets of flooring is willing to do what it takes to grow. Like the old saying that while you're resting, someone on the other team is training, and when you meet it won't be fun if they're in better shape than you are."
"Wow. We're almost back to a PE of 8 and a price sales ratio of 0.5. Great job, Richmond!"
"The chances of listening in to yesterday's annual meeting are not looking good this morning. Going to virtualshareholdermeeting, ours is listed under past meetings, but only says ""Broadcast has ended, thanks for watching!"" It appears LL IR may have chosen to seal the meeting for rebroadcast, which is an option apparently that many companies choose. For example, for these May 18 meetings: Old Second Bancorp offers an ""event summary"" of the May 18 meeting, with registration; Sealed Air chose to say ""Thank you for joining. The meeting has now concluded""; and Chipotle has a 28 minute video, slide show, and meeting materials. A quick look at meetings from a week earlier shows the same mix of replay options.So I guess it's up in the air. We may have to write our own transcript as best we can from memory.Off hand, I recall 85% of shares voting. Everyone seemed prepared for the questions. Charles was forthright, but not to the point of stubborn or dogged, responding to an antagonistically worded, but paraphrased, question on PE valuation relative to peers. I think he stated generically to the effect that the strategy of improving sales, margin, etc. would improve earnings. The question challenging marketing generally, and advertising, lack of large format stores, and FND response specifically was answered similarly to the effect of continually monitoring and improving, etc. Board Chair Nancy was able to quickly recite the special project pay of $20,000 a month for her, and $2000 per meeting for the two or three directors working the project(s). (I forgot their names.) She stammered briefly, only one third as long as last year, and it wasn't over any particular awkward point she was making. I have to give her the benefit of the doubt that she may just have a very intermittent stutter/speech thingie. The question on our earnings being misreported by half, was answered by CFO Nancy, who said that it apparently came about due to some taxed adjusted number being misused, and that they have asked that it be corrected. I know we won't get back those three months of having our lamp under a bushel, but management must now know investors look for more than just the SEC filings to be correct.I'm a little embarrassed to have not written down my questions. And I'm surprised that little or no recording or replay of annual meetings is so prevalent after the past year's leaps in video conferencing. Like the open records of the Wisconsin Court, the annual meetings are public, but not so much as you'd notice.If anyone can find or create a recording or transcript to share, it would help investors judge what's going on in Richmond and decide whether to buy, sell or hold this long-troubled stock."
"While LL may absolutely suck at stock valuation, earnings per share, store growth, cost control, staying out of court in the first place, once there staying in court long enough so the plaintiffs attorney don't get dizzy from the revolving courthouse door, writing on-strategy copy, writing humorous copy, writing informative copy, buying media to reach potential rather than former customers, sourcing from outside China, etc. etc. -- we do apparently excel at touching all the bags, diversity wise. I was especially intrigued by our closing statement. ""At LL Flooring, we are committed to bringing diverse, talented individuals to a place they want to turn their job into a career."" So does that mean we just pay them more and more for less and less until they decide to stay? Because that seems to be how things work in Richmond ...https://www.learn4good.com/jobs/dallas/texas/hr_and_recruitment/588310984/e/"
wow. smallest number of shares traded today in 5 years. Probably means nothing - just an observation. The smallest number of shares in a week over at least 2 years (and I think 5) was the last week of July at 1.16mm shares.
"The PlanOperating a company like Lumber Liquidators is relatively straight forward. There is no research and development, no patents, no highly skilled labor. The company buys flooring from large manufacturers and resells it at a markup in retail stores. The company sells over $1.1 billion dollars of flooring per year and has 415 stores across the USA. Yet, the company loses money. Or, to be clear, shareholders lose money. Management makes millions. The board of directors make millions. The flooring suppliers make millions. The company advertisers make millions. But Lumber Liquidators shareholders lose millions.Over the last 4 years, the company has helped millions of Americans purchase and install beautiful flooring in their homes, and the company has not made 1 dollar in profit. Lumber Liquidators is effectively being managed like a flooring charity. Obviously, a change is needed."
"Rewatched Shaun Of The Dead last night. Still the funniest, feel-good Zombie movie. This morning I'm struck by the movie's take on the the well-known stages of zombification -- being bitten, feeling sick, saying goodbye to loved ones, dying then reanimating, briefly staring confusedly at one's friends and family before trying to eat them.I wonder which stage the overall market is at today. Are we still fighting the good fight against long odds, but still uninfected? Or at some further stage. Historians of the stock market and zombie movies both know that there's a resolution at the end of the story, with some characters gone and the world looking forward to starting over. And the greatest tragedy is the last good guy to die before the situation somehow stabilizes. There's no reason per se that the market couldn't stabilize here. But then again, nothing in America (and hence, the world) is moving toward stabilization. Let's be careful out there."
"Short position increase to 10,000,000 (5/15) shares from 8,000,000 (4/30).Pps hit a recent high coming out of April, but The halt in progress in china trade talks (4/30-5/1) served as a catalyst for shorts, who shorted LL down. Imagine had the inverse taken place, pps would be closer to $20. That day will come.Both sides have tested each other in these talks, with each expecting a different response. Back to the drawing board as pressure builds from both sides to get a deal done. 25% tariffs are going to ripple through the consumer goods world like a bowling ball. Every outlet is going to get slammed. China will get hit harder and has every incentive to come to an agreement. In the long run, they will be stronger conceding to the US than not.Once again the shorts have put themselves in an odd position. Any news on trade talk progress will send the LL stock higher. Buy more here.As well, we might expect further news on the m&a front. 1.2B in sales and a national footprint are tempting teasers for acquirers who want to build out their product lines and leverage distribution. LL in its current state should not remain independent and hopefully is board of directors is recognizing that. End of the daily rant."
"Big misprint.I reported yesterday that the short position was unchanged. The report i use had the correct dates, but the info was from last period.Happy to report that SHORT INTEREST DROPPED BY 900,000 shares from 1/15 to 1/31. Short position is now 5,100,000. Sorry for the confuddlement."
"Most of the people shorting the company now are deeply misinformed. Ask yourself, where will LL be in 10 years?The company is adding roughly 25 new stores per year and in 10 years, that means they will have almost 800. I think many of these stores will be the larger format style. So we will have almost 800 large stores, each probably doing $4 million in revenue. That's a 3.2 billion dollar business. If we can get to a 10% operating margin, which is not out of the question, then that is almost $320 million per year. That's more than twice the value of the whole company right now. The magic of compounding, my friends.The company has made some corporate hiring errors in the past. But in 10 years, most of these people will be gone (retired or virus related departures) and we will have a fresh executive team with good ideas. The same goes for the company directors, although this might take a slightly longer time. A lot of these guys are already in their 60s and in 10 to 15 years, they will be gone or have a lot more experience.Concerning margins, you have to realize that even at 2% inflation over the next 10 years, it would be a mathematical certainty that prices will be at least 25% higher. That's all profit. Basically, the company must remain focused on doing what it has been doing all along. Keep the store count rising and let inflation and time fix margins and management. It's an easy formula. And it's actually what made Warren Buffet so rich."
Favorable ruling yesterday affecting one of the last holdouts in the MDL. Excludes most of a substitute expert opinion. Should encourage them to take a deal before they get dismissed with more than their fair share of prejudice. The end of these legal issues drops directly to the bottom line (I hope).
LL seems to be stuck in the mud. The only news is a few hundred shares issued to management. Not any significant share dilution. Can a little more than a thousand shares really trigger an algorithmic sell off?

Somebody knows something based on yesterday and early action today.
"I guess the following news item from last Thursday, 9/9/2, may be the explanation for last week's drop below $20.I wonder what the big boys have teed up to knock it below $19? Or $18?

And it don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing, right?https://www.classaction.org/news/lumber-liquidators-faces-another-class-action-over-alleged-defects-in-morning-star-strand-bamboo-flooring"
"I didn't realize how many people read this forum until I saw how many downvotes manbysea got. Gave me a good chuckle.Today was a fruitful day. I guess I'm growing sentimental of my shares, because I only peeled away a couple covered calls today."
"A shareholder friendly management would have it Investor Relations department put together some kind of statement concerning the drop last week. If it's tricky to do so legally, they should have dragged Legal into the office this weekend to help them say whatever is legal. And if it's somehow illegal to give an explanation, they should issue a notice that they cannot give an explanation. But we'll see today whether Knowles once again leaves investors twisting in the wind, the last ones to find out any news."
"LL knocked it out of the Park!Net income rose to $15.5 million, or 53 cents a share, from $1.05 million, or 4 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share grew to 67 cents from 7 cents, above the FactSet consensus of 26 cents. Sales increased 12.1% to $295.8 million, beating the FactSet consensus of $275.6 million, as same-store sales growth of 10.9% topped expectations of a 3.5%"
"One final post for the night. If you look at today's options, there were two big positions opened. First, there was the roughly 1400 August 9, $10 calls that traded for $1.35. For some short, that trade locks in a covering purchase at a cost of $8.65 if LL closes above $10 on August 9. Meanwhile, there was another trade for 1400 calls -- January 17, 2020 $7 calls between $2.7 and $2.65, which gives the owner a cost of $9.80 to acquire shares. Assuming these two trades were initiated by a single person, the put trade appears to be a short seller buying the chance to cover against any price spike on August 9. The call trade could be a purchase: buying a call at a $.90 premium to today's price is a hard way to cover a short, but combined with the above put it does supply the shares needed to close a short position in January if LL closes above $10 in August and the puts can't be exercised. If sold by the same short that bought the puts, the promise to sell at $7 in six months presumes that they will risk buying 140,000 shares twice(!) first to cover the August puts if it closes above $10 (unless they let it ride) and again in January unless the calls fail because the expirations closes below $7. It's hard for me to plumb the depths of the options market and the shorts who rely on it. My tentative analysis is that today someone covered their short position in the near-term with puts, and in the long term with calls. But that may be my interpretation because if I were short, I'd be looking to to just that. I'm open to other explanations. But if some short acted today to limit their exposure, that would suggest that even shorts think there's very little downside near-term from here."
"As many of you have noticed, LL issued a press release stating that comps fell 1% in Q1. I think the company purposefully sandbagged the revenue estimate and will actually beat when they report. I don't exactly understand Tyson's logic for low-balling, but likely it is a case of under-promise, over-deliver. We have seen this for the last 3 years, but now it should actually work.Given the trends I am seeing, it would not surprise me if revenue was actually up over 10% last quarter. And concerning current revenue, while we had a couple of slower days in April, namely over the Easter weekend, most of my sales were double last year. And we accomplished this with only a skeleton warehouse crew and no functioning showroom. Dennisa, I agree wholeheartedly with your analysis. The drop in LL shares today was entirely due to low oil prices. And that is another market which makes no sense. I was purchasing oil all day, and the more I purchased, the more cash appeared in my account. The negative prices make no sense, but I certainly took advantage. I used some of my proceeds to buy 50k LL shares today. I actually think that considering the dislocations in the market, LL might get a negative price at some time in the future. Which would be great. If LL went to negative $5 or even lower, I would load up. At those prices, you actually get paid to buy shares. I can't explain this phenomenon, but I know a deal when I see one. I am looking to get my average cost below zero and then just ride this up to the $50 range by Christmas. GLTA."

"I told you so! Here is my post from yesterday morning. This proves that markets are not that efficient. Why didn't the analysts raise their estimates? They are lazy and so is the market. In fairness, I have been wrong on LL more than I've been right but winning is much better!I just analyzed the expected numbers on Tuesday, and I am estimating that LL will beat earnings estimates. The analysis is pretty simple. All you need to do is go back to their 12/12/19 guidance, which they re-affirmed earlier this month. Their guidance for the full-year 2019 stated flat-to-slightly positive revenue growth (I used 0.5%), and adjusted operating margin of between 2.1 - 2.4% (I used 2.25%).Their adjusted operating margin excludes legal and one-time expenses, which is about $2.6MM average through the first three quarters. Using a revenue figure of $273MM, we get adjusted operating income of $19.2MM. Remove their add backs and you get $16.5MM net income before tax. Figure a tax rate of 15% (should be less than 21% as they lost money for the first 3 quarters), and my net income figure is $14.06MM, or 0.49 cents per share.Analyst estimates are $0.15. Unless there is some other one-time expense (I'm already accounting for normal legal and professional fees), the company is telling us both their revenue figure and their adjusted operating margin. Thoughts?I'm happy to email anyone my spreadsheet."
"Tilson last night on ValueWalk:“3) I’ve been getting some questions about how the jump in tariffs might affect Lumber Liquidators (LL), which I recommended in the first issue of the Empire Investment Report last month. It’s complicated… In the short run, it will crimp margins, though not as much as you might think. And in the long run, it may actually benefit the company (and the stock).I’ll be sharing my full analysis with my subscribers in the second monthly issue,”"
"All, LL had the same sort of price action today that Trek and FND had after posting strong quarters. But, it is far better to have a sell-off after a great quarter than a sell-off from a bad report. With only one analyst with a buy rating and two of the three on the call saying some form of congratulations, we are likely to see this stock continue to go higher. It went up so dramatically after Wedbushs upgrade that it got ahead of itself. But the turnaround is impressive. I remember posts on this board that suggested they would do almost zero revenue in the second quarter!"
This morning we are treated to Richmond's devastating comeback to yesterday's continued beatdown of the stock price.And the pre-market response is to drop another 2%.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ll-flooring-partners-nfcap-help-102800966.html

His tired, STD-ravaged ball-sack. (To keep this PG rated, I left it at STD-ravaged, and didn't say Hillary-humping, Flowers-deflowering, Jones-jonesing, or Lewinsky-licked.

"Updated D/E = 0.35Will decline further as stock climbs.Management states cash flows for H2 will be used for reupping inventories. I know people have been screaming at management for more stores, but keep in mind that have like 70M in accounts payable and massively depleted inventory. Building new stores before reigning in their checkbook and inventory would be placing the carriage before the horse. Some, especially the shorts,, want everything all at once, but one must realize they are limited by their balance sheet. Management has really shown great fiscal discipline. If you look back, at the restructuring I am impressed.:1 2020 Close unproductive stores. 2. 2021 12-15 new stores, increase cash3. Build out online and pros market4. replenish inventory.4.

The assets - total debt + free cash flow is the same value as the market cap. That is quite a convincing argument of it being worth more than it is currently valued.
I have held a long position in LL for a long time --- today is interesting -- on the one hand good overall performance in Q2 --- on the other hand no effort by management to set any positive expectations around future business -- they projected only doubt and uncertainty. Clearly a number of investors are bailing -- and if I were a relative new comer to to LL I would be inclined to do the same --- but alas -- I am going to hold on -- we will see this move up as the day progresses as the traders that bet long drop out.
"In the first 2 weeks of November 2018, short interest jumped by over 1 million shares. This is also the time when MS reported an increase in their ownership of LL by 1 million shares.Now, as of the last short report, short interest drops by 1 million shares. Is it a coincidence that yesterday MS also announced it had decreased its ownership position in LL by 1 million shares?MS increased their position in LL in Nov 2018 in order to lend out the shares to the shorts. Legally they are obliged to have the shares on hand if they are lending them out. Looking at the October chart, it is possible that MS purchased their 1 million shares in the low 12$ range, maybe high 11$ range. They sold this position over the last weeks, at about the same price. You can clearly see volume spikes over the last 10 days which would have been the selling days. In the meanwhile, they pocketed the lending fee and would have profited off any run higher.All said, MS retains ownership of a small base position. Overall short interest has dropped and checking the availability of shares to short today, they were rather low (under 300 000 on Interactive Brokers). This may prove to be an inflection point. I don't know. But all this seems too much to be simple coincidence, in my opinion."
"K, thanks for posting the investor presentation. I winced reading it. Maybe Mr. Sullivan will buy more shares - and a clue for this management team while he is at it. Expense is unconscionable. SGA has grown 30% faster than sales in DK tenure. Non-existent comp growth. Product comp negative. Margins flat. High margin categories either shrinking (accessories) or threatened by tariffs (manufactured / vinyl plank). Unable to find the right combination of advertising / staffing / occupancy / labor to deliver acceptable profit (operating margin >5%). STRUCTURALLY UNPROFITABLE. This is not that hard of a riddle. PLEASE REDUCE YOUR BLOATED SGA by 10% - you will deliver ~$1.35 in EPS to your shareholders. This alone gets stock back above $20. Dennis, all that stuff you think you need - because that's the way it was at Lowes - trust me, you don't need it. THIS IS A DIFFERENT GAME AND YOU ARE LOSING. Badly."
"A message to the overpaid officers of LL, either get the job done of raising shareholder value or leave."
"I made a yahoo account just to comment on this board. I’m an 18 year old kid that’s worked hard and wants an investment future. I though I saw the end of litigation in 2017 and began loading up shares. To this day I own over 2500 at a $16.00 strike price. I’ve been accepting of everything up until this point. This man, Tom Sullivan, was sued by lumber Liquidators in March for 10 million in damages related to selling a comparable product to laminate flooring. That being said I GUARANTEE you that this man manipulated this stock in a spiteful move and made slightly less than 5 million dollars in the process. I don’t have anything else to say."
"I'm calling BS on yesterday afternoon's price action and especially this morning's. All the news is good. Proceeding in Wisconsin, large and growing $14 put position the same as we saw before TS's announcement, positive movement on tariffs this morning, and a new ad airing the past few days that's significant not for the ad but for being a sign that Knowles has finally realized that increasing sales is part of our solution.And meanwhile, the stock craters in the premarket where the volume is light and the trading more easily manipulated.We should see $14 this week. My only concern is that no puts have been written above $14 yet. But the writer gets all the action he needs with near the money options, and if he's in the loop on an eventual offer, he has no reason to telegraph his bid price by buying at that exact strike."
"Reading through old issues of Floor Covering to find the industry stats, I noticed the recurring theme of independents fearing national competitors in general and the fastest growing, most similarly sized store chain, Lumber Liquidators, in particular.Well, it's 2019, and there's a bigger national chain making a play to become the Walmart of flooring putting everyone smaller out of business and setting off a price war among the big boxes. Never mind that the money raised for that chain's IPO was part of a pool of ""investors"" who agreed up front to not sell shares below certain prices and who prefer to hold the guaranteed debt rather than the equity. No, regardless of this would-be behemoth's shady financing, they going to build out a network of big stores and be a player in the industry until they either pay back or run out of someone else's money. Independent floor chains need to ask themselves, ""Is Lumber Liquidators still the boogy-man?"" Sure, they have to resent someone doing the small store thing better than they can, and FND seems more like the big boxes which are such a fact of life that there's no point in worrying about them. But if FND is staying close to the big boxes (ala Ho Chi Minh's ""holding on to the belts"" of our troops to avoid air strikes), it seems like independents need to be more similar to LL. But how can they emulate our sales success when they have smaller internet presence, higher distribution costs, no advertising efficiencies, and apparently very limited in-stock inventory? It's hard to make up those disadvantages with only local knowledge, design skills, and well-known locations. At the same time, while we have very good prospects as far as continuing as a profitable business, compared to the coming repeated decimations of the indies, many of them will survive at a lower standard of living and as a publicly traded company we need sales and profit growth every year. So the Indies' jobs and incomes are threatened by FND, while LL's survival as an equity is threatened. The solution is simple, we offer the Indie's what they need and want, in exchange for what we need and want. We could triple our network in a year, and gain a permanent advantage in installers, designers, and locations. Indies can get the national support they need, while maintaining the independence and flexibility to run their own business. In a way, it's no different than agreeing to be a distributor for Armstrong, etc. But our C-Suite can't think out of the box. And so they should be fired."
And here we go! See you in the 30s.
It's hard to have faith in a management team that doesn't have faith in itself.
"LL has now posted 6 straight quarters of earnings and 7 out of 8 quarters with earnings. Last year the highest EPS forecast was $1.86 and they actually had EPS of $2.27. LL announced they will open 12-15 stores this year, still a growth story. Possible lawsuit money from insurance companies to come if they win their case. PE ratio of 14.86 v FND’s 50.42LL had sales of over $300M in one quarter and the current market is $687MFND had annul sales of 2.4B and current market cap is almost 9BWe still have another quarter of COVID meaning people will stay home and still remodel plus the spring time is the busiest building time of the year. Why don’t I have $50k laying around? I could be on the verge of an early retirement with this stock once the manipulation stops."
"LL Sep 2017: $40/sh. - unresolved class action, - bamboo suits, - uninspired CEO, - debt build, - excessive overhead spend, - growing legal expenses,... LL Jul 2020: $22/sh. - none of the above, - potential windfall on insurance claim, - high market lumber prices, - strong home improvement demand, - highest store count, - record Revenues expected, - fresh / effective marketing, ..."

"You'd never know it from either Yahoo's ""news"" articles about LL or our own IR page, but Wednesday, the day after tomorrow, will be LL's annual meeting. It will be a virtual event like last year, and if it's run like last year, you will get a chance to vote your proxies at the beginning of the meeting, without any discussion of the issues, and after the website to vote is read out, you will have less than two minutes to log on and vote. So you will vote beforehand if you want to have your vote recorded. Last year's meeting had the lowest voter participation % for individual investors in years; I believe the fact that investors for the first time could listen in live caused many of us to not vote, for waiting to hear the arguments and decide justly. Bag that! If you wait, you will likely not vote. Just the way management wants.Wait! Why would I say management wants to reduce individual investor participation? Because, as I said above, there is no mention of the annual meeting except in out SEC filings. Even worst, when you click on the IR FAQs, the second item is ""When is Lumber Liquidators' next annual meeting of stockholders scheduled to take place?"" followed by ""You may find this information on the Events page."" Now, there is no mention of the annual meeting on the Events page, so I guess that the information provided depends on the meaning of the word ""may"" (or ""you"" or ""on"" or ""find ...). I supposed providing contradictory incorrect information on your IR page on the eve of an annual meeting doesn't rise to the level of a shareholder lawsuit. But I would happily, joyfully participate in such a suit, even to the point of being an identified representative of the injured ""class"". But beyond whether or not you get to vote, I'd like to ask how you plan to vote. Is there anything mgt. could say at this point that could change your mind? I will not change my vote; it is based on the past year which cannot be changed. But it would be welcome news to hear of any plan to resume growth, compete with FND, or at a minimum put a positive upbeat spin on events by resuming guidance, etc. Really, I'd settle for anything that refutes the simplest, most obvious explanation for management behavior which is that since they changed their incentive bonus to be based on three year improvement, they will now do as little as possible to support the stock until two and three quarter years have elapsed.But I expect the usual beatdown of long investors. The big boys have already made their side bets to hedge whatever dump they plan to take; there is no news or event to attract new money and new longs so it's up to all of us to suffer another vicious dip and hold. If enough of us give up and sell then the side bets will pay off and the price will be off to the races like a thoroughbred that's thrown its jockey at the gate. But if we stay in the saddle, he'll stroll around the infield eating daisies and poison ivy in a passive aggressive attempt to destroy us.VOTE NO!!!!!"

Now, as clear an idea as that can't survive, even for the father of the delightful Jill Townsend. So the zeitgeist replaced that with Say Anything's line about young man unwilling to make or sell or repair anything, ""as a career"". So I get that for a job to be FUN and EXCITING, there can't be any real work involve. But what does it say about our HR functionaries that they don't even find their work intriguing enough to edit the ""FUN and EXCITING"" boilerplate? I guess that's why they didn't use it for the HR Systems Administrator listing."
"So ... What do you bet that Charles and the Nancies are working on a way to load in as much bad news as possible this quarter to offset whatever we got from the lawsuit. That will let the BBSC (big baller shot caller) continue covering/profiting from upfront news (or knowing there will be no news). With enough mental gymnastics, they can justify it as ""setting a stable more comparable earnings flow that won't be misunderstood"" by muppets like us. It would also be a ""more prudent quarterly number in time of uncertainty that can be more reliably comped in future"". Blah - blah - blah. It all still comes down to making investors hold the bag in case of bad news while enjoying none of the upside from good news (like when sales surprisingly increased during a pandemic). And we also haven't forgotten that LL management and the board of directors get more shares for their incentive awards when the stock price is suppressed. What do you think this stock would do if Tom Sullivan took another run at it? It's not so far relative to inflation and the overall market from when he made his last feint. What do you think a reorganization plan would do? Or an announcement about aggressive store growth? (Stores with actual product, that is.) How much market cap would a change at the top be worth, if Charles or the big Nancy left? If FND wants to double their footprint and utilize their big-box warehouses to supply newly bought LL stores, while letting the BBSC close his short at this ridiculous evaluation, this might be the optimal time while the Congressional Floor-play is too preoccupied to look askance at a monopolistic merger. What do you think that'd be worth?"
How long until this board's discussion focuses away from the settlement of the past legal issues and now on est. 2Q19 Revenues to set a LL quarter's record of over $290 million?
"Lumber Liquidators (LL) - A massive turnaround play - The short dated calls will likely double after earnings. I have 25,000 shares + calls and will buy more. Position screenshots included.Position ScreenshotLumber Liquidators (LL) stock has been beaten down for years but the company is actually making a turnaround. They had issues in the past with product quality, but they have 420 stores across the USA. These stores are small (like 5000sq.ft) and they only have 2 employees per store, but the average store does $2.6 million in revenue per year. It's one of the highest sales per sq.ft in all of retail.Here is where it gets interesting. The stock used to trade at over $100, but has since fallen to $7. Housing and renovation stocks took a bath in 2018 and 2019, but in 2020 housing is staging a huge turnaround due to tight supply and low interest rates. The housing and renovation indexes ITB and XHB are now at all time highs. LL has been lagging, but the same store sales comps going forward are super easy because the company had a terrible 2019. They should be able to post comps in 2020 of 5%.Also, the company will receive $25 million from the government because they overpaid on tariffs last year. They are literally getting a check from the gov for $25 million.And in December, the company upped their guidance for 2019. And they will announce earning next week. This was their December press release.I have 25,000 shares this morning and plan to buy more. I also have 140 calls for Jan 15, 2021. I really do believe in the company and I see it as a much safer bet than some of the tech stuff which it trading at massive valuations.The best way to play this is with call options. The close term Feb 28, $8 calls are trading at $0.50. I think this stock will see a huge bump on earnings day (Feb 25) and these could easily be worth $2. (I plan to buy 100 of these calls).Also, for a longer term play, the Jan 2021 $13 calls are trading at $0.60. I am thinking the stock should easily reach at least $15 by the end of the year, so these should be $2. It's a triple and you have a whole year to get there. And if it can get to $20, (it was at $26 less than 2 years ago) you will more than 10x your money. (I have 140 of these calls).ALSO The short interest in LL shares is almost 40%. When this stock starts running there will be an epic short squeeze, even worse than what happened with TSLA. It will go up by dollars at a time. And volume is pretty tight and just last week there were filings by Blackrock (owns 16%), Vanguard (owns 6.4%), Neil Gagnon (owns 4.8%) and T. ROWE PRICE (owns 5.7%). So, over 30% is owned by these 4 firms, plus in total almost 80% is owned by institutions. The 40% short interest will be difficult for shorts to unwind given the light volume. Any covering will send shares much higher on any good news.Remember, LL shares doubled in 2 weeks last August when the founder tried to buy back the company - This thing has legs"

"So ... I don't like being bullied. And when I type something critical of the LB IR department Richmond, only to see it taken down immediately, possible due to complaints from the same, I try to make sure that they don't get their way. Sure, I'll try to guess what the problem was and reword it. But I don't believe in letting anonymous snitches bury ""my truth"". What so offended whomever was a comment that the upcoming earnings call would likely be announced next week, maybe on a Thursday like last year. And it might take place on the first Monday of November, like last year. All good. The problem was probably that I followed that by posting a likely cut and paste job of last quarter's announcement, with my estimated dates filled in. That, of course, misinformation (!) no matter how clearly one points out the that this is not the official announcement. My point was to prove that after three beers, while watching TV, I could do one fourth of the IR department's entire year's workload. Because they do not answer the phone, or return calls, as we know. I did not expect to also prove that IR is so petty as to resent others' proving how easy their job is. That was a bonus.(Actually, now that I think about it, it could not have been the IR department that complained. You see I posted it last night, and it was taken down before 8:45am. And we all know that LL's IR team doesn't work hard enough to even think about the company and its investors before 9am at the earliest.)"
down 4% on 60k shares - what gives?
"What has changed, fundamentally, in the past 36 hours? Surely nothing to warrant a 12+% drop. This is almost the same change that we saw when the tariff reversal/refund news came out (albeit in the opposite direction). And what happened there? We gave up every single penny in the ensuing weeks on zero news.What does this all mean IMO?1. The stock is heavily manipulated2. The market is basically zero confidence in management3. The stock is heavily manipulated, made easy because the market has zero confidence in managementSure, there are still many things wrong with LL, but how else can you justify losing all those gains gained from tariff relief, and then crashing another 12% on some loser analyst report? Why haven't we heard anything from management? (spoiler: we never do)"
"I chatted today with someone who has conversed personally with TS. It should be quite plain to everyone that TS cares about TS, not LL or investors in LL. He gave up on LL with a pleasing profit rather than go through the hard work of restoring its reputation. He originally built LL but is not as committed to ongoing hard work as you might like to believe.In 2019, TS made about $7 million from stock and options from what amounts to totally legal SP manipulation made possible by his reputation as the founder of LL. He may have made about $500k per hour on that caper. Nice work if you can get it.He may have continued to buy stock if the SP had not gone up to $13 because he likes to buy at cheap prices. Not unusual. Of course, it should have been predictable that the SP would increase once significant buying by a person of his profile was public knowledge. So what were his real intentions? His stated current thinking is to let the CEO of LL continue to run LL into the ground and then buy back in at a BK fire sale level, lower than what he paid in 2019. He would get control again at a bargain price. TS is not on your side. Only a naive long wants TS back. A short position would agree with his stance."
"The long rumored ""game"" of putting all of one's shares under sell orders in order to prevent the market maker from loaning shares to shores never seems to work out, at least not for little long investors. No good deed ....But -- today might be the day to put that strategy to the test. Just don't be surprised if you have to sell in the $14's or $15's today. I'm putting all my shares up for sale, at prices higher than we've seen in a year or more....GLTAL!!!"
"Lumber Liquidators Announces Fourth Quarter And Full Year 2019 Financial ResultsPR NewswireRICHMOND, Va., Feb. 25, 2020RICHMOND, Va., Feb. 25, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Lumber Liquidators (NYSE: LL), a leading specialty retailer of hard-surface flooring in North America, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2019.(PRNewsfoto/Lumber Liquidators)""During the quarter, we made continued progress implementing our transformational plan designed to reinvigorate our brand and position us to deliver exceptional value in the hard-surface flooring marketplace,"" said Interim President and Chief Customer Experience Officer Charles Tyson. ""Comparable store sales grew slightly in the quarter, and profitability improved significantly, in large part due to the tariff exclusions announced by the U.S. Trade Representative in November.""""Reflecting on the full year, 2019 was especially dynamic with an ever-changing tariff environment,"" Tyson continued. ""Our tariff mitigation efforts in 2019, coupled with the exclusions announced in November, allowed us to substantially improve gross margins while remaining focused on delivering value to customers. As we enter 2020, we remain focused on three key areas – delivering enhanced profitability, driving traffic to our stores and online, and improving the customer experience.""Fourth Quarter ResultsNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased $4.9 million, or 1.8%, to $274 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Comparable store sales increased 0.4% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 driven by sales growth in the vinyl plank category offset, in part, by weakness in bamboo and laminate. The Company opened two new stores and closed two stores in the fourth quarter of 2019.Gross profit increased 17% in the fourth quarter of 2019 to $112 million as compared to $96 million in the comparable period in 2018. Gross margin expanded to 40.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019 from 35.7% in the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily due to the retroactive exclusion of tariffs on certain flooring products imported from China discussed under ""Tariff Recovery"" below. The fourth quarter of 2019 was unfavorably impacted by countervailing duty rate changes and the fourth quarter of 2018 was favorably impacted by classification adjustments related to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (""HTS""). Excluding these items as shown on the table that follows, Adjusted Gross Profit (a non-GAAP measure) increased by $18 million and Adjusted Gross Margin (a non-GAAP measure) improved to 41% this quarter from 35.1% in the fourth quarter of 2018. As noted, the margin increase was primarily driven by the retroactive tariff exclusions. The period was also favorably impacted by a larger mix of higher-margin manufactured products, reduced discounting in the stores, merchandising cost-out efforts, and selective retail price increases earlier in 2019. See ""Non-GAAP and Other Information"" below for a discussion of our use of non-GAAP items and a reconciliation of non-GAAP results.Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses decreased 39% in the fourth quarter of 2019 to $93 million from $151 million in the comparable period in 2018. SG&A in both quarters included incremental legal as well as other costs and credits related to lawsuits, investigations and certain other legal matters, with the most substantial being $61 million in accruals related to legal settlements recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. Adjusted SG&A (a non-GAAP measure) increased $5.4 million to 33.9% as a percentage of sales, 130 basis points higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to higher advertising, additional costs related to six net new stores compared to the fourth quarter a year ago, higher year-over-year incentive compensation and equity accruals, and costs related to the corporate headquarters relocation that occurred in fourth quarter of 2019.Operating income was $19 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to an operating loss of $55 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. Adjusted Operating Income (a non-GAAP measure) was $19 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to $6.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. The most significant driver of the increase was the impact on Adjusted Gross Margin from the retroactive exclusion of tariff on certain flooring products as well as additional efforts to enhance gross profit, partially offset by an increase in Adjusted SG&A.Income tax expense was $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to income tax expense of $0.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase was driven by higher taxable income leading to the complete depletion of the Company's Federal net operating losses.Net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $16 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $57 million, or $1.99 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter"
"Laura Champine's upgrade (Loop Capital) and commentaryThis was nice to see. Have no idea if it has impacted the stock positively, but pleased to see the run higher, whatever the cause. Some color on Ms. Champine, with who I have spent time. Smart analyst who has long followed LL - wherever her career has taken her. She's spent time digging in on this company as much as any analyst out there. What she knows - and what all should remember - is the fundamental simplicity and profit generating power of the store operating model Tom Sullivan created. It can still be a profit-generator if guided by the right leadership. D Knowles showed himself to be incapable of understanding this model and playing to its strengths. It is a sales model. DK treated it like a big box operation, not a sales organization. He also layered on WAY too much overhead, which IMO, was unnecessary and damaging to the company - hampering its turnaround. Thankfully, DK is now out of the picture. Current leader comes from Autozone and was ushered in by a principled and smart board member who made his career there also (Mr. Wade). There will be some transition friction (i.e., shedding some of DK's assistant coaches, while new leader brings in his team). This is normal and to be expected. Trust that this will happen as quickly and efficiently as possible. I have been so down on this stock for the last 3 years, but do have some hope now. New leadership doesn't even have to be very good to get this company turning a consistent profit - they can merely be competent and good things should follow. So far, they have shown themselves to be a whole shot more competent than the failed DK show. Eager to see what can be done here, but $2 / share profit IS ATTAINABLE and at 15x would give us $30 share price...."
does anyone think these kiosks are a good idea at all? And who the heck is gonna buy flooring from a kiosk and they are counting them as stores. Am I being cynical or is there an argument for this?
Long and strong!
"Private equity or strategic partner?So there has been some discussion on the LLVC forum as well as some offline that LL was being cued up for a private equity transaction. I concede the thought but disagree.Private equity likes to run after dustressed assets, picking them off very cheaply and offering support to an otherwise untenable situation. By way of example, look at Sycamore Partners various acquisitions. All were deeply troubled retail operations nearing bankruptcy. As such, Sycamore never paid more than .3x sales. PE players are financial buyers who rely on heavy upfront discounts to make profit 3-5 years later. They do make operational changes, but these are not as impactful due to lack of expertise and more emphasis on cash-on-cash returns. So Sycamore would buy big names at deep discounts.What LL needs is a strategic buyer with a presence in the building materials space, with existing delivery ( inhouse trucking), backroom, and promo operations. LL is a big-little-national with very expensive freight to store, wildly expensive advert and promo, and out of control admin costs. LL operates in a very narrow, non-diverse category which has been long-ago outmoded. LL is in a box. Due to store size and operating costs its difficult to diversify.A number of these weaknesses goes away with a sale to an existing building materials operation with trucking, promo, and backroom in place. There are at least 700-1000 bps in savings in those areas that a financial buyer would not be able to leverage.Our discussion of pricing and margin is all but moot in the presence of tariffs and what i believe will become secular changes in the competitive landscape in the floooring category. LL can no longer compete on price, as price is not the issue. The issue is traffic. The issue is also spending. LL cannot afford a heavy promo budget while at the same time lowering pricing. There is a balance between traditional ad spending and the return from increased traffic.Lets hope that management sees it this way and elects to sell this thing."
"12 Grand Openings scheduled for Jan 26, 2019 - I am not sure if these are all brand new stores, or ones which have been open already a few weeks. My guess is that some of these stores (6) were opened in December, but are having their official grand opening this weekend. (The company said that they were opening 6 new stores in Q4.) And that the balance of the 12 grand openings are brand new in Q1 2019. So that would mean that the company has already opened 6 new stores so far in 2019. Not a bad pace to start the year. I am trying not to read too much into this, but it is encouraging to see the store base grow by 3% in the span of a month.https://www.facebook.com/pg/lumberliquidators/events/"
"As many of you know, I bought 100k shares at $4 two weeks ago. I confirm that yesterday, at the high of the day, I sold everything. I still think the company is undervalued. And I still work at the company, so I am still dependent on LL for my livelihood. However, I have recently identified an even better investment than LL, and I am plowing all my profits into JCP. At 23 cents, they are an even better deal than LL. You could basically buy the whole JCP company right now for under $75 million. Lumber Liquidators could probably buy the company with the cash they generate this quarter alone (plus their tariff refund). And I actually believe that LL might be interested in JCP. During the last managers call with corporate, one manager actually asked Mr. Tyson if the company was considering acquisition targets in order to grow faster. And Charles mentioned that while he could not divulge much info, he thought that JCP, or a similar department store company might fit well with the organization. Perhaps not the whole company, but some of the JCP real estate??? Just imagine if LL actually purchased JCP and converted all the stores to extra large format flooring warehouses. Hard surface, tile, carpet, vinyl, linoleum and parquet. It would be a real game changer. If LL could move fast and perhaps take over JCP in the next few weeks, even at a small premium to the current share price (say 50 cents total - double my money), Tyson and his team could liquidate JCP inventory over the summer and likely could have each JCP store retrofitted and stocked with flooring by the fall, just in time for the next coronavirus sales boost. I don't promise anything, and it is just as likely that another flooring company snaps up JCP before LL, but it is something really interesting to consider. Either way I will double my money on my JCP, so I'm happy. Good luck to you and I will keep you informed on all new developments at LL."

"Browsing through our home page, I note we've bit hard on some kind of European cork floor that's supposed to be waterproof. While I'm sure it wins some EU seal of approval for sustainability, you can bet it will disappoint Americans as much as other green foreign floors have. Remember bamboo? So while Hydro-cork may be woke enough not to be sold, processed, repaired, or ultimately bought, it will be litigated to death. Maybe that's why we're the sole North American distributor. But why worry? We all know what tigers our legal team can be.Drilling down further into the online style catalog, I am concerned about the lack of diversity. Sure, we've checked the boxes as far as skin color, but all the images reflect a mono-cultural bourgeois Western prosperity. And I don't think just adding someone in wheelchair will do, that's just a white supremacist dog-whistle. Obviously. What we need is real diversity -- androgynous K-pop stars, the sherpa who climbed with Hillary, that slave with all the scars, the Afghan girl from the Nat Geo cover, some of the cancer survivors from the quit smoking ads, and a fly-covered Bangladeshi baby. And, just to be fair, add a real fat American guy just one sausage biscuit away from a coronary. But put him in tie-dye and throwing a frisbee. Gotta show progress is possible, right?"
"-9 months ago Tilson announces he's back in LL and recommends people load up all the way to $14.

One or more of these events coming together at the same time could be a massive short covering with a double or triple of the stock price in a very short amount of time."
"Ya gotta love the analyst writing for Zacks, if the price beats expectations the stock will go up but if they miss it might go lower, WOW, I'd have never known that, thanks Zacks for that insight."
"Continuing to survey our competitors I find Icork Floor, one of the few whose website doesn't mimic our visualizer tool. It's an interesting contrast between the way their site tries to inform and manage expectations for their cork product's degree of water-resistance and the way ours shows an over-the-top puddle of rainwater splashing on our floors. Given that our water-proof cork products are linked to that poorly chosen graphic, and that our product isn't magically superior to Icork's, one of us must be lying. An investor would think that a management being continually dragged into court for warranty claims would dial back their ad agency's exaggerated artwork. But Richmond seems to feel the legalese in our warranties is as air-tight as our ad agency's depiction of our products is water-tight. But they never seem to try to win those self-inflicted warranty lawsuits, do they? It's almost as if the company was being run by lawyers, for the sake of generating billable hours. https://www.icorkfloor.com/water-resistant-flooring-cork-flooring/"
"Wow, under a million shares traded today. Did no one notice it was earnings day? That is like a normal day from 2019."
"Lumber Liquidators Holdings LL, -18.37% said it swung to a fourth-quarter profit of $16.4 million, or 57 cents a share, as sales rose to $273.9 million from $268.9 million. The retailer of hard-surface flooring said comparable-store sales rose 0.4% as adjusted EPS was 56 cents. Analysts polled by FactSet expected earnings of 23 cents on sales of $272 million. Lumber Liquidators issued a 2020 outlook that excluded the possible supply-chain disruptions from coronavirus, as it also expects the continuation of Section 301 tariffs at 25% on currently tariffed Chinese imports while also assuming tariff exclusions granted in 2019 on vinyl and engineered ""click"" product remain in effect for all of 2020 despite a currently proposed August 2020 expiration. The outlook calls for low-single-digit growth in comparable-store sales and an adjusted operating margin between 2.7% to 3.5%, compared to the 2019 adjusted operating margin of 2.3%."
Zacks apparently did a pump and dump for it's shareholders however it couldn't have worked out that well as it didn't go up and it's not dropping that much. This analysists are nothing but con men.
"Earnings week boys. Last year they made a penny per share. This year EPS estimates are 0.24. Last quarter they made 0.34. Costs per sale have certainly risen. Sales have probably dropped, but they had an incredible backlog. For example,, payables sitting on the books at the end of Q1 was the highest it's been since end of Q3 2020. I honestly would be surprised if they exceed expectations."
"I was quite worried about margins for Q1. However, after their report came out I became much more competent. My concern was that with tariffs reinstated and having worked through their inventory, supply chains were damaged, and shipping costs were through the roof, we would possibly be seeing devastating results. This turned out not being the case and their earnings had major a major positive surprise. The next fudster argument is that they can't compete with the big stores. The flooring market is tremendously fragmented. Take a moment and search for flooring stores. Most of you will see quite a variety. Yes, I feel like a lot of smaller businesses will fall prey to consolidation. However, LL is one of the big fish in the sea, as stores close their piece of the pie will grow and not shrink. I don't see one company capturing 100% of the sales from a ma-and-pa shop closing down. This hasn't been the case yet, and I don't see it happening tomorrow."
Lumber Liquidators is up 5.16% to 21.62
I have reached out to IR about a press release regarding the LL v WBIC et al settlement. I will keep you all in the loop if they decide to respond.
"LL++ Whitney Tilson makes his first and new buy recommendation from his new firm EmpireFinancialResearch.com last nights seminar had almost 100,000 subscribers he thinks shares will triple from current levels. Recommends buying up to $14 . One of only 5 times in his career that he's reversed his position resulting in gains of 100% 200% 1500% and 5000% and now this one"
The LL analysts need to start raising their target prices. I’m especially looking at you Morgan Stanley with a less than half target price of his peers still sitting at an undervalue rating and at $14. Morgan Stanley needs to put a new analyst on this stock with a fresh set of eyes!
Lumber Liquidators is up 5.12% to 20.11
"The LL pattern has been consistent for a few cycles - sell off up to a few days before reporting - then, reasonable appreciation - reporting crushes expectations - yet, unexplained sell off - then, up significantly the month following."
$14-$15 coming.
I've always maintained that I'm a tiny fish as in tiny investor in a big pond but if I sold it would be close to 10% of the daily volume so far. This is crazy how few shares are being traded.
Volume seems really light this morning. Does that mean I should go to Chili's? Am I a hater just for asking? I know there's no website to tell me what to do. But maybe someone's tik-tok account I can follow?
This thing is just going to trade sideways here at the bottom until a favorable CEO is named and another earnings proves consistency on improved margins. The big money needed here is in no mood for speculation.
Another $1.06 quarter should do the trick on this one. LL has done an amazing job at turning around this company. They will now be earning aywhere from $2-3.5 a share annually going forward. Stock price hs been surpressed way too long IMO.
Another two stores open on June 28th. More revenue coming.

"Thoughts on earnings? I'm modeling a similar increase from Q1 to Q2, which gets you to $307MM in revenue. With margins at 38.5%, SG&A of $103K, that translates to $0.39."
"This coming quarter may prove difficult to meet expectations. Cost/sale has probably risen slightly, while I'm guessing demand is about the same as the previous quarter. Meanwhile the analyst ave EPS prediction is the same as last quarter."
First time we've traded $1MM shares since May 5!
"Another zero news day. While new longs might take relief that nothing stupid was announced today, older longs should be furious that our do-nothing management continues to sit around this otherwise profitable company like Melissa McCarthy riding a little girl's Barbie Power Wheels."
"Since a few of you asked how I could be up total portfolio today of over 1% while taking a beating in ZM (and buying more ZM this morning!!) - my 4 losers today were #ZM #AAPL #COIN and #ME - my winners were #SDC #LL #HOTH #CNK #BABA #F #PRVB #VAL #GE #DAL #DD #MRNA and #DEN Ironically, I like, most of the time, to keep the PEG around 1… last week I was almost all in and needed to free up some cash, so I sold all the stocks outside of near 1 PEG or below… EXCEPT ZOOM!

"I wonder why Nancy left Pier One? It appears her leaving was not a calm parting of the ways.Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.On April 17, 2019, Pier 1 Imports, Inc.

On May 10, 2019, as required by the Executive Severance Agreement entered into between the Company and Ms. Walsh, dated January 25, 2018 (the “Walsh Agreement”), Ms. Walsh executed a general release and waiver of claims, which release will become effective by its terms on May 18th if not revoked by Ms. Walsh within the seven-day period following her execution of the release. Pursuant to the terms of the Walsh Agreement, the Company will continue to pay Ms. Walsh’s base salary, which was $615,000 as of the Separation Date, in substantially equal installments on each regular salary payroll date for a period of twelve months following the Separation Date, in addition to outplacement benefits in the amount of $15,000.

In addition, pursuant to a Letter Agreement regarding Executive Severance Agreement between Pier 1 Services Company and Ms. Walsh (the “Letter Agreement”), the Company agreed to modify the Walsh Agreement to include the following:●The Company agreed to waive the non-competition provisions set forth in the Walsh Agreement and any related non-competition provision by and between the Company and Ms. Walsh.●The Company agreed to modify the non-disparagement provision set forth in the Walsh Agreement such that the Company will have the same duty as Ms. Walsh with respect to non-disparagement.●The Company will not require Ms. Walsh to repay any portion of the retention award paid pursuant to that certain First Amended and Restated Retention Award Agreement dated January 8, 2019, by and between Ms. Walsh and the Company.●The Company will not require Ms. Walsh to repay any amounts previously paid to Ms. Walsh or on her behalf in connection with her relocation to Texas in 2018.The foregoing summary of the provisions of the Walsh Agreement and the amounts to be paid to Ms. Walsh thereunder is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Walsh Agreement, which was attached as Exhibit 10.2 to the Current Report on Form 8‑K filed by the Company on January 31, 2018, and which is incorporated herein by reference, and the Letter Agreement, executed by Ms. Walsh on May 10, 2019, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and which is incorporated herein by reference."
"Tilson’s Latest Reasoning:“He says Lumber Liquidators is a buy for a number of reasons: 1 The executives responsible for the scandal have left the company. 2 Lumber Liquidators recently settled its remaining lawsuits related to the scandal. 3 It has a great business. 4 He sees margins tripling over the next three years.Tilson says the company's share price, which is now near $11, is out of whack with the fundamentals. He notes that operating margins were only 1.9% in 2018 because of the high legal costs related to the scandal. Now that the scandal is in the rear-view mirror, Tilson says operating margins could reach 6% over the next two years, causing shares to double or even triple.”"
"I am a long time long but I now see LL as an abbreviation for Low Luster but the shine may yet come back to this stock. By the way, have others received a phone call asking that you support the proxy propositions management has proposed and the shareholder protesters oppose? I am leaning toward the protest side of the fence and the person who called me was very polite but hoped I would change my mind."
Maybe the reason management doesn't want to share the details of the settlement is because they don't want us to know they only got one magic bean instead of three.
"So, our dear friends at Wedbush have stepped up just prior to earnings to pull a stunt and acquire (cover). Basham must feel particularly concerned, so much so he could not wait for actual earnings (and a chance to query management) and then write his hit piece. Wedbush wants in before earnings and they made that very obvious today. There are a few sign in the PR from Wedbush that cue us into the fact that they were attempting to cobble together a rationale for their play. In fact, almost every line is cut from whole cloth:""""Basham said he is also concerned that sales gains driven by inventory growth and a ""healthy assortment"" are slowing""""Comment: someone tell this guy that sale gains do not come from inventory growth. Also, cue him into the fact that product mix changes over time as it need to.""""interest rates are rising, transportation costs are increasing """"Comment: LL has very little debt. Rates could double and the impact on LL would be negligible. """"benefits of installation services to same-store sales wane""""Comment: The install sales are still on an upside of the curve. Bashams comments are simply unfounded. The install program is still growing and will continue to increase margin dollars from current customers, but will also attract new customers."" increasing margin pressures and limited visibility to comps pacing with the industry""""Comment: margin pressure has always been the norm in this space. Always. That is what drives LL traffic.This last sentence is essentially page-filler.In short, Wedbush efforts are very transparent here. They want LL shares and will do anything to get them. Why release a hit-piece when earnings are just a few days away?"
I think it is time to start covering…LL is now trading near 52 week lows instead of mid range. This stock is a huge value play. The long investors will rewarded greatly if patient.
"Yesterday, the LL Board of Directors hired a proxy firm to solicit shareholders to vote for their proposals. Specifically, the company seems to be having trouble getting shareholder support for Proposal 4, which would increase the amount of stock the company can issue for equity compensation. Knowles and the Board really want the stock options gravy train to continue. Due to the way votes are tabulated for this proposal, we have a chance of getting it rejected. For Proposal 4, any shares which are not voted, are deemed to have voted against the proposal. Of the shares that do vote, the company needs 67% to vote in favor, in order to get it passed. Please encourage all shareholders you know to vote against the proposals. Let's do this. http://rebuildll.rizzicapital.com/"
Lumber Liquidators is up 4.96% to 20.12
A little bit of a selloff after earnings is expected --- the fact that LL over performed expectations and now we see good support after mild profit taking is a good indication of where we are headed.--- i am feeling pretty bullish about my holdings at the moment.
"Couldn't break the $20 support. Trades too far below fair market value with too many tailwinds in the CAGR of hard flooring market, which was already high before the COVID bump came along. They've diversified heavily out of China. With tarrifs out od the way, they only need production ramped up. It will come. Manufacturing takes time to ramp. This company is a multi-bagger without a doubt. As it has consolidated I'm a new investor in LL, this is my majority holding, and I cannot see selling this one. Once they have 2021 cash flows under their belt, this will be irresistible stock. Value investors are hungry for good deals like this one. Luckily, I can see it coming many quarters in advance. The shorts here cannot deny with a straight face that each quarter will have good earnings and cash flows this year."
"If this breaks the 50 day hard, I'll buy some shares! But that's asking a lot."
Why is LL ROIC so bad?
How long before Dennis issues a Press Release taking credit for the stock price increase?
Broke the $10.50 barrier. earnings surprise beat by $273% versus the $0.15 estimate. I think the bottom is in for us longs Thank God I need a double to break even it's been a long time.
"210,894 shares traded Friday, as compared to an Avg. Volume of 402,968. Of that last Friday volume, 106,400 worth of call contracts for this Friday's 8/20 expiration traded. I know even less about options than I do about fundamentals or technicals. But it seems significant that a light volume day right after an apparent news event (unannounced) and near-term peak in price and volume should have such a high proportion of its volume matched in the options market and that only on those options that expire in a week. Is that call volume due to new positions? Or to closing out existing ones possibly opened earlier in the week? Are those calls being traded between a roughly equal number of buyers and sellers? Or is it relatively few sellers distributing to many buyers, as opposed to a few buyers acquiring from many sellers? A few major counterparties, or possibly only one, is more likely to know something and have a tradable thesis than the collective assortment of individual traders willing to take the other side of the big boys' one week trade.And finally, is the trading of that big player (if there even is one) based on a short or long expectation? Buying calls is an apparently long decision, but can also be a way to coerce some counter party into buying the stock to hold for a week (as they try to reap the premium of the call they sold). And selling calls into the bid, can convince a long-minded counterparty to forgo buying the stock and settle for a quick buck one week trade, leaving more room for the call-seller to acquire shares and longer dated calls."
"LL is the last standalone building materials retail company in the US. Not counting HD Lowes or Menards, virtually every other building products company has been rolled up by strategic or financial buyers. There is a reason for that: margins are increasingly compressed and operating costs are rising. Building products companies run on a strong and efficient backroom, distribution, and promo platform. LL has none of that and is struggling as a 'big-little-national' using common carriers, expensive promo over a wide footprint, and having no connections to otherwise lever in a massive space called building materials. Its not easy being cheesy. Its not cheap, either.So the fight for market share goes on. FnD is going right after HD and Lowes by installing stores within their locales. HD and Low sells $7b and $4b in flooring each year, and FnD wants a big bite out of that. To be honest, its easy to steal share from a mass merchandiser with just marginally better service and selection. While LL is likely not a direct FnD target, they tend to suffer the most as the pricing and promo fight heats up between the big boxes. Its like the fox and the rabbit (LL being the rabbit). The rabbit is running for its life, while the fox is running for its next meal.Its no wat to operate a company. LL has a shaggy balance sheet and virtually no cash. Of course they have borrowing power, but that isn't strength, it just might serve as a hangmans noose if they start borrowing to expand stores. LL should keep its small format. They aren't going to compete with FnD, but will ruin themselves trying.Eventually, FnD will begin to have decreasing returns as they run out of ideal markets.The pitch is this: i dont think LL can achieve an acceptable return on $1B in sales due to the competitive environment. They need to partner up, ie sell to a stronger player who will leverage costs."
There's a big fish swimming in our pond today.
"Hello. Unfortunately I am still here - a quarter mil in the hole ave cost 25. The way I read this is that on a go forward basis we add a little over 1% to margins (someone else pointed this out). A one time event is not that big of a deal but 1% is about $11m, which is about .40 cents a share to the recurring bottom line. If I am right, then that is substantial (especially when they can't eek out a few percentage points on over $1B in sales. While they certainly may find a way to blow that 40 cents, this does seem like some slightly good news."
"FND reports tomorrow after the close and LL investors should brace themselves for another ritual flogging to improve our morale on the logic that we are just like a company that sells tile out of gigantic footprint stores with 50 employees per store. But if the logic appeals to you that we are somehow similar to FND consider this. Their market cap is five times (500%) their annual sales, while our market cap is a third less than our sales (67%). So if our businesses are so similar that their earnings predict ours, then we should be priced 7.5X higher than today (500%/.67). So when you see the long-time short try to snatch LL's price down this Friday, think about how much of a discount we're at already. I'm not saying we'll hit $187.5 this year. They're more overpriced than we are underpriced. But if our ""national flooring retailer"" sector combines for 3.2B in sales and 10.95B in market cap, for a Price/Sales ratio of 3.4. If our price reached just half that ratio we be 2.5 times higher than today or around $63.I doubt that will ever happen because the market never gives a sucker an even break. But I could easily see our being acquired when the stimulus money starts getting used to retire other bigger companies' debts, and our management has scarfed up enough shares for themselves to start to want to see LL's price go up. I think we'd sell about halfway to $63, at around $44. That'd let the big boys churn it all the way to $187, and we muppets could brag forever about our ""ten-bagger"" from the 2020 lows. Meh."
Let your profits run
Wow. Just two analysts on the call? Or was it three?
All those puts I sold yesterday have aged well.
"Boom, boom, boom…"
I thought for sure this was going to be the moment that this stock was going to take off and get a reasonable valuation. I guess we will be waiting for one more quarter. 4800 shares at avg cost of $15. My call is for $58 by year end.
"Some people have said that the lawsuit is settled - is that actually accurate and if so, I would think they would have to announce something? My guess is that it actually is not settled as though I am not sure, they would be required to announce if it were."
"I just analyzed the expected numbers on Tuesday, and I am estimating that LL will beat earnings estimates. The analysis is pretty simple. All you need to do is go back to their 12/12/19 guidance, which they re-affirmed earlier this month. Their guidance for the full-year 2019 stated flat-to-slightly positive revenue growth (I used 0.5%), and adjusted operating margin of between 2.1 - 2.4% (I used 2.25%).Their adjusted operating margin excludes legal and one-time expenses, which is about $2.6MM average through the first three quarters. Using a revenue figure of $273MM, we get adjusted operating income of $19.2MM. Remove their add backs and you get $16.5MM net income before tax. Figure a tax rate of 15% (should be less than 21% as they lost money for the first 3 quarters), and my net income figure is $14.06MM, or 0.49 cents per share.Analyst estimates are $0.15. Unless there is some other one-time expense (I'm already accounting for normal legal and professional fees), the company is telling us both their revenue figure and their adjusted operating margin. Thoughts?I'm happy to email anyone my spreadsheet."
"I'd put money on the fact it's the same big boy playing in our sandbox. A roughly 60K purchase yesterday morning shot up the price and the same size of buy today with the same result. Oh, I guess as a long I already have money on LL going up. Hahaa"
"On LL website:“We are pleased to have reached resolution with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, and are committed to our customers, compliance, transparency, and accountability across our organization and from our vendors. Lumber Liquidators has undergone a complete transformation in recent years and today is a new company led by an entirely new management team. We continue focusing on providing quality products, services and experiences for our valued customers and stakeholders.”UPDATE ON DISCLOSURE MATTERSThe Company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to resolve its charge of securities fraud in connection with the Company’s Form 8-K filing in March 2015. The agreement with the DOJ stated the charges are deferred and will be dismissed after three years provided that the Company meets certain obligations, many of which are already implemented.The Company entered into a settlement of an administrative proceeding with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and applicable rules. Notably, neither the DOJ nor the SEC made any findings regarding the safety or quality of the Company’s laminate flooring previously sourced from China.As a result, Lumber Liquidators has agreed to pay a fine in the amount of $19.1 million, and restitution of $13.9 million, of which up to $6.1 million will be paid to the SEC in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. As part of its relevant considerations, the DOJ noted that Lumber Liquidators’ “employees involved in wrongdoing either were terminated or resigned from the Company, and the Company replaced its executive management team with experienced executives who have displayed a commitment to building an ethical corporate culture.”In the lead-up to these agreements, Lumber Liquidators has incorporated extensive remedial measures that include the implementation and enforcement of a comprehensive compliance, ethics, and reporting program, as well as training and guidance on relevant policies and procedures.These resolutions are an acknowledgment of our good faith and relentless efforts to transform our company and demonstrate our commitment to our customers, compliance, transparency and accountability across our organization and from our vendors.DEMONSTRATING COMMITMENT TO INTEGRITY AND COMPLIANCELumber Liquidators has invested significantly in improvements to our compliance policies and procedures and related remediation efforts, and undergone a complete management transformation since the spring of 2015. • The Board moved aggressively to bring in a new and highly experienced leadership team that would emphasize a culture of sound business practices, honesty, integrity and accountability for what we sell and what we say. • The new management team has taken steps to broaden and integrate integrity and compliance throughout our operations, including driving improvements to, and oversight of, Lumber Liquidators’ vendor relationships. • We retained outside subject matter experts to evaluate and make recommendations concerning our policies, procedures and practices, including compliance issues related to U.S. California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). • Our Integrity Hotline is consistently monitored and available to employees, vendors, and third-party partners.ENSURING SAFETY OF OUR PRODUCTSThe U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission closed its investigation of Lumber Liquidators’ Chinese-sourced laminate products without issuing a product recall. We believe this is validation that the formaldehyde levels met requirements and demonstrates the products were safe. • Lumber Liquidators voluntarily removed the product from the market to allay customer concerns, and the company no longer sells this product. • The Company has instituted strong quality and compliance programs to provide assurance that, no matter where products are sourced, we are confident that compliance, quality and safety requirements have been met. • We have developed a rigorous on-boarding process for vendors. This vetting process includes due diligence, onsite audits, and testing of product. • We have an audit program which validates that vendors that meet our requirements. Internal and external experts vet and approve new vendors, audit and gauge their compliance with our requirements and the law, and assist the Company in following up with vendors to ensure each one takes appropriate action to address findings. • We invested in an expansive and voluntary home air testing program. These third-party tests showed that no floor samples exceeded World Health Organization (WHO) emissions levels and that test results looked statistically similar to prior studies of normal households."
"The month of May will prove to be somewhat interesting as the PUT seller has taken rather large positions on the 5/17 strikes between $11 and $13.50.The PUTS were sold rather recently that indicates that perhaps more in the line of news is coming perhaps from TILSON, who I believe has originated the PUT position and wants to keep the premiums.....Just sayin. All I know is watch the action when there is so much at stake. The PUT seller has much on the line here with 1,628,200 shares that could go against him:Strike May 17$11.00 #2,888 Contracts$12.00 #8,728 Contracts$13.00 #3,408 Contracts$13.50 #1,258 ContractsWe could be over $13.50 by May 17.The PUT buyer has only the premium on the line. and likely made a timeline/event bet along with a long position on the stock. I sense the players are anticipating something here with the PUT seller anticipating stable or increasing prices, and someone taking long positions and buying puts in the event something falls through.I have gotten calls from several LL holders who apparently abstained from voting, and have been getting ROBO-CALLS from the consulting firm hired by LL to try to turn the vote. Anyone else get any calls???"
Any chance that FND would ever purchase LL? Seems like the models are too different and LL model has a lot more risk with lower ROI. Just asking
Surprised no one has mentioned this yet. CEO Charles Tyson purchases another $50k worth using his own money and another director purchased $100k worth with their own money.
the problem here is that I am not sure when you bread this down that each store is worth $1.5mm - thoughts?
We seem to be stuck in a situation where big players can't get in because there isn't the volume available. Very few are willing to sell in the 20's so any larger buy orders cause the price to spike. The same can be said for selling. This is just my humble opinion but the lack of volume is hurting us.
"Get on the train, it's leaving the station!"
Watch for sudden drop !
"Gagnon Securities. Not an index fund.Our approach to investing is different. As a group, we share a core belief that thoughtful and persistent research coupled with disciplined risk-taking will yield outsized returns over a long period of time.We believe that proprietary research yields a competitive advantage. Broadly defined, our interests lie within smaller companies and special situations. Our investment premise is that the universe of lesser-known companies is largely inefficient. Often, the companies that we find attractive are not widely followed by the investment community. Our work, therefore, must be both pioneering and perceptive, grounded in carefully measured assumptions.We spend our time studying companies, and our client portfolios reflect the best opportunities we find, assembled stock by stock. We meet with management teams and travel to companies’ headquarters and facilities to better evaluate businesses, plans for growth and incentives. We augment these visits by conducting further conversations with employees, suppliers, partners and competitors. We attend trade shows, conferences, read industry-specific publications and speak to numerous analysts to build an information mosaic around the companies we follow. Our craft is to understand the microeconomics of a business, and then synthesize information about the competitive, economic, and internal factors to determine which issues represent opportunities or potential dangers. The ability to capitalize on these opportunities and respond quickly requires intensive focus and timing can prove crucial."
"Anyone who has held onto a long position in LL over the years knows that this stock will swing wildly based on day trading activity --- the good news is that mid to long term this stock is rising --- new management have their act together, the housing and home renovation markets are strong and strengthening, all signs point upward and to the right ---- I expect that we will see $40 within the next six months -- that is a great return from where the stock is today.Mark my words"
Peaking over $27. Now is it going to get pushed back down again? Sure seems like that has been the plan the past couple months.
#$%$ company now at $ 20 plus per share
"I don't want to put on my tin-foil hat, but the focus on one-time earnings adjustments seems to miss the forest for the trees. Are there not always one-time adjustments to every balance sheet? By making this appear to have missed the consensus earnings number it's focusing on the only glaring thread of negativity in the earnings report and missing an entire quilt pattern of positive news."
