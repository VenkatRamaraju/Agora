"Some causes for concern going into earnings:- INVENTORY - was already low before macro supply chain constriction accelerated and widened. Don't have confidence in LL ability to navigate (mgmt track record / weak balance sheet relative to competition / poor competitive position with suppliers relative to competition - weaker players served last in tough times). This one is huge and scary for this company short term. Heard CEO of Stanley say inventory currently stuck in supply chain at ~6% of annual sales. Scary, and they are well run. Very m,uch hope they handle well, but not confident- INFLATION - would expect HD, LOW, even FND to do better fighting off c / mitigating cost increases from suppliers and transportation providers. Expect LL to lose pricing power, gross margin as a result - OVERHEAD - not doing enough to trim the fat slapped on by Know less, current team adding own- MANAGEMENT - seem oddly focused on re-creating the wheel, instead of getting back to basic execution of a sound business model based on low overhead and focus on sales. The (low overhead) model levers very well. Look back to better times and you see this clearly.Current CEO has essentially been in place since 2019. Though Know less fired in early '20, I believe he would have been gone earlier had it not been for CFO departure. Believe that Charlies was brought in to replace him within 6 months of arrival. So, we're 2+ years in and the market isn't saying this management team is on the right track. Looks increasingly like a (twice) failed turnaround. Understand times are tough, but results just not looking near good enough for me. Maybe one can make $ here on the short side (5.6% of float) but not my game. So much patience needed on this one - which is especially tough given the plentiful, lucrative opportunities in this market."
"Lo! and Be-hucking Fold!!!News out of the Madison Wisconsin court where out lawsuit against our insurers was to be tried someday once the Mideast freezes over.""Court recordDate Event10-25-2021 Letters/correspondence Additional text: from Atty Jacobs in RE - Parties have settled.""I won't comment on the judge, the court, or the system. Only that, as investors, we've been kept in the dark for over two months and the timing of our agreeing seems contrived to be close to our earnings call next week. Whether they've settled for peanuts or a meaningful sum is in the eye of the beholder, but it is a fact that whenever this case was brought up on this message board, the possibility of winning anything was completely dismissed. So a price drop on ""disappointing settlement news"" is wildly dishonest and unrealistic - like the efficient market theory itself.I expect this is another in a long series of earnings manipulating decisions made after the quarter. And the pattern for years now has been to smooth away any positive surprises in sales or margins and thereby create more cushion for hiring friends, trying daring new marketing concepts (stores without products!), and generally doing anything to put off running Tom Sullivan's business like Tom Sullivan did. So if settling is a positive piece of news, you can bet that there's bad news to go with it -- either an actual sales and margin disappointment, or whining about supply and dread recession, or some ludicrous idea like closing brick and mortar, becoming a lifestyle house, or changing the name again. And you can never rule out dilution with these guys. In a way, they are like the great socialist tyrants whose mass killings were caused by a certainty that socialism could be made to work and that anyone saying otherwise deserved the worst. Stubbornness, not stupidity, is their Achilles heel.https://wcca.wicourts.gov/caseDetail.html?caseNo=2015CV001089&countyNo=13&index=0#records"
"Let's Go, Tyson!"
"If this stock just had Mgmt as strong as FNDâ€™s Mgmt, it would rock!!!"
"Long time share holder that is now a bag holder. I did buy a lot sub $10 but got greedy and was slaughtered and should have sold it all at $30+, counted my blessings and moved on. Look at that YTD chart $30 and heading to sbu $18. SHOULD I just sell it all (all long term) and just move on and learn the lesson of what happens to the greedy pig. Thoughts?"
"They(Chuckie and Nancy) are laughing at us, they don't care. The stock is about to go under $18."
Going back under $10..............::shaking my head::.
"LL's business model is intact. More small stores with fewer, better paid people and national credibility from advertising and internet is still ""right things right"". That combination outflanks big boxes on service, independents on credibility, FND on cost, and Empire on DIY.But this management has shoehorned the wrong consumer model into this otherwise successful business model.The right consumer model is based on the one unchanging truth of flooring -- that it lasts a long time. Because of that, the people who use flooring everyday also almost never have to buy flooring. And so they are unfamiliar -- with how it's installed, how much it costs, and how long it should last. Most people have never bought a floor and so take them totally for granted. (Landlords attest to this.) And practically no one buys a floor until the previous one is obviously damaged either by abuse or some disaster -- natural or remodeling.So, mathematically some 80% of each year's customers buy about 20% of the square footage. They only buy one time for a home they own, and in smaller amounts per purchase than pros. These infrequent buyers know next to nothing. They don't want to get ripped off, but they really don't know what that means in terms of price or durability. They might DIY if they knew it was easy and goof-proof. And because they'll pay for what they want, this 20% of floors from 80% of buyers generates probably 50% of flooring profits (2.5x the average profit per sq ft).Empire depends almost entirely on these first time/one time buyers, promising them cheap and easy new floors. FND dazzles them with overhead and pallets of inventory, while promising price and selection. HD and Lowes lets such people DIY if they can figure it out but prefers them to use their installers. Flooring is always a big-box afterthought; they don't care if you don't know what you're buying. Indies vary wildly from interior design gals to guys selling flooring ""from the back of a trucking yard in Massachusetts"".And for that 80% of buyers, LL at one time was the only convenient store with a national name where you could find out what floors would work in your house, see all the floors with your own eyes, and often get an unbeatable price offer. With tools available for DIYs and installers for DIFMs, and a website that gushed with advice, we were a perfect fit for them.And not only that, back when we only helped buyers hook up with independent installers, we were a go-to place for contractors and installers whose customers wanted to look at different floors before making a decision. We likely got half of our business through this symbiotic relationship with pros -- before we cut them out with our own dedicated installers.Meanwhile, the other 80% of floors are bought by the other 20% of customers -- flippers, landlords, contractors, realtors looking to make a sale, etc. They buy floors often so they know what flooring costs. They care more about the money they can make on the job than how long it lasts, except for landlords interested in the lowest cost long-term (durability, ease of repairs). No one in this group cares about style beyond what's safe and popular. And their value focus means that profits are lower, maybe 63% of category average.These frequent buyers know Empire hides their higher price somewhere, but realtors know a fast new floor can save a sale. Lowes, HD and FND are equally convenient. Designer indies are irrelevant, but a guy with a truck, or an outlet, etc is worth the price for some. And LL was a price competitive choice for these people as well, when we still competed on price.The above understanding of the consumer and purchaser explains why personal explanations will always matter for the side of the business that doesn't buy often. And why price will always matter for the other side.Today we have a bunch of elites from business schools padding their resumes with business changes to impress their friends who might hire them someday. We let blue-collar Knowles give us nationwide dedicated installers, and thereby slap 90% of local pros in the face. We let Nancy Walsh skimp on store growth for her financial resume. And Charles Tyson gets rid of the price focused advertising directed at everyone that still seems to work for Empire. Instead, he creates tasteful, quiet ads about loving utilitarian taken-for-granted floors to stimulate category demand. But then he runs it on the cheap no-reach HGTV to people already so category-involved that they watch a 24/7 home rehab channel. (And by the way, if anyone in Richmond has watched those channels lately, the story line is no longer about how to refresh a room with a floor, but how to flip a $1.2M foreclosure by doubling the floor space. Does that sound any the customers described above?)Net, there's nothing wrong here that a return to basics couldn't fix. But Richmond can't admit any mistake. So here we are, and there you go."
"So ... What do you bet that Charles and the Nancies are working on a way to load in as much bad news as possible this quarter to offset whatever we got from the lawsuit. That will let the BBSC (big baller shot caller) continue covering/profiting from upfront news (or knowing there will be no news). With enough mental gymnastics, they can justify it as ""setting a stable more comparable earnings flow that won't be misunderstood"" by muppets like us. It would also be a ""more prudent quarterly number in time of uncertainty that can be more reliably comped in future"". Blah - blah - blah. It all still comes down to making investors hold the bag in case of bad news while enjoying none of the upside from good news (like when sales surprisingly increased during a pandemic). And we also haven't forgotten that LL management and the board of directors get more shares for their incentive awards when the stock price is suppressed. What do you think this stock would do if Tom Sullivan took another run at it? It's not so far relative to inflation and the overall market from when he made his last feint. What do you think a reorganization plan would do? Or an announcement about aggressive store growth? (Stores with actual product, that is.) How much market cap would a change at the top be worth, if Charles or the big Nancy left? If FND wants to double their footprint and utilize their big-box warehouses to supply newly bought LL stores, while letting the BBSC close his short at this ridiculous evaluation, this might be the optimal time while the Congressional Floor-play is too preoccupied to look askance at a monopolistic merger. What do you think that'd be worth?"
"So ... I don't like being bullied. And when I type something critical of the LB IR department Richmond, only to see it taken down immediately, possible due to complaints from the same, I try to make sure that they don't get their way. Sure, I'll try to guess what the problem was and reword it. But I don't believe in letting anonymous snitches bury ""my truth"". What so offended whomever was a comment that the upcoming earnings call would likely be announced next week, maybe on a Thursday like last year. And it might take place on the first Monday of November, like last year. All good. The problem was probably that I followed that by posting a likely cut and paste job of last quarter's announcement, with my estimated dates filled in. That, of course, misinformation (!) no matter how clearly one points out the that this is not the official announcement. My point was to prove that after three beers, while watching TV, I could do one fourth of the IR department's entire year's workload. Because they do not answer the phone, or return calls, as we know. I did not expect to also prove that IR is so petty as to resent others' proving how easy their job is. That was a bonus.(Actually, now that I think about it, it could not have been the IR department that complained. You see I posted it last night, and it was taken down before 8:45am. And we all know that LL's IR team doesn't work hard enough to even think about the company and its investors before 9am at the earliest.)"
"Wow. We're almost back to a PE of 8 and a price sales ratio of 0.5. Great job, Richmond!"
"Some people have said that the lawsuit is settled - is that actually accurate and if so, I would think they would have to announce something? My guess is that it actually is not settled as though I am not sure, they would be required to announce if it were."
"A week from today Nancy and Chuckie will once again blunder the call and drive our shares, think almost a year ago we were in the mid 30's. Good Job guys, we get screw and you guys get over a million dollars to do it."
"Separately, I don't speak the language of technical analysis and I haven't heard of any ""pairs"" type chart work looking at two stocks at once. But I find it interesting that since our September 9 announcement of ""showroom"" stores without inventory, we are down 3.6%. Meanwhile, since FND's October 13 announcement of electric vehicle charging stations, their stock is up 15.2%. Now, maybe those press releases are just that bad and good, respectively. But what are the odds that this is some news-supported setup for a swing in the relative valuation of both stocks? FND reports first, and personnel might be a problem with 50 employees per store, given its euphoria-forever valuation. And FND's hiring issues would, of course be a tremendous hit to LL with its, what?, four employees per store? Then we report the following week, 10 weeks after reaching an agreement with our insurersthat somehow just couldn't quite get finalized before earnings, there'd be a perfect setup for good news from the Land of Cheese courtroom.But of course, you can't bet on anything when it comes to LL. Our ace in the hole legal team (the #$%$) might not finalize things for another month. And if bickering over a comma here or a split infinitive there means LL's valuation collapses on meh earnings before a glorious melt-up in December after the muppets have been shaken hard one last time, that's no concern of Charles Tyson's, is it? That's what he said in the last annual meeting, after all. Not ""in so many words"" but almost verbatim. But try getting a transcript of that from Investor Relations. But it's funny how quickly our legal team can concede when they get the signal. Marvin used to refer to this as ""catching a plane"". The real question is who decides when LL makes bad news, and how much money does he make on that news."
"Its almost noon and just a little over 36,000 shares traded on a volatile day. I hope $LL can deliver because I don't think you can buy much of this stock without moving the markets on it. I might buy at the money puts and calls for earnings because I'm having a hard time figuring out if supply chains are going to kill their margins or if they mitigated it. I feel like a big uppy day or downy day is coming soon enough."
Suspect supply chain issues will devastate this stock at earnings announcements
"When I complain about this stock, the other side of the argument seems to be ""It's not that easy to run a business"" or ""How could they have done any better?""My regular searches for some glimmer of news or the merest mirror-fogging sign of life discovered yet another competitor - BestLaminate. To read their webpage, which also has our floor visualizer capability BTW, becoming a pretty significant player in flooring is as easy as throwing a few pallets of flooring into the family shipping container during a move from Europe, selling those fast enough to justify renting a space, moving that project online, and promising to match anyone's price. Now, I'm sure some newer longs are wondering why our Richmond brain trust hasn't tried that yet. But older longs will remember when that's exactly what we did and exactly how we built this business, with sales growth and store growth etc. before Tom Sullivan was forced out. And since he got cancelled for formaldehyde, the current management has to do the opposite and undo everything they inherited. (Deja vu, much?)But somebody, somewhere, with a few pallets of flooring is willing to do what it takes to grow. Like the old saying that while you're resting, someone on the other team is training, and when you meet it won't be fun if they're in better shape than you are."
"Ok, so they have $100mm in cash - market cap is $500mm; who can quantify how much an acquiring company would save in costs after the acquisition - that I don't know but they certainly could use the $100mm toward the purchase. Unless this company is truly falling apart, demand is huge and not likely to subside anytime soon, so granted, management sucks but does anyone think this would fit for another company or perhaps to go private? If so, please give your 2 cents - especially on the savings that would occur after being sold."
"And, in other news not specifically related to LL, Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero has written a piece that inadvertently strayed out of her lane dangerously close to the center line. Since Yahoo's censors have judged it too edgy for ""safe and engaging"" conversation, I'll meekly recount that it quotes numerous onsite workers at the west coast ports blaming the slowdown on union and regulatory decisions, apparently arbitrary. So if your investment thesis is shortages forever and inflation to the moon, you may want to hedge your bitcoin exposure. But the alternative truth of an expanding middle-class and an excess of goods chasing the currency of the world's last respected superpower leading to transitory inflation, and possible recession, seems unlikely as well. The only way out may be if the cure for high prices is high prices, as they say in the oil patch.https://news.yahoo.com/as-supply-crisis-worsens-truckers-and-dock-workers-all-say-dont-blame-us-125007621.html"
"Most investors either look through fundamentals or analyze historic patterns of price and volume to spot hidden risk and reward. But a few use specific numbers like Fibonacci as a hidden key like the DaVinci code. I even remember a Kurt Vonnegut story where a wino chose stock symbols based on first words of the bible, (INTerstate Helicopter, Everlasting Buggywhip, Excelsior Grain International, Nylon Notions Incorporated, etc). I'm open to anything that could describe what LL investors have been through and maybe suggest where it's headed. Here's what I have so far.If you watch Young Frankenstein backwards, it would begin with Teri Garr bursting into song over Gene Wilder's ""prowess"". That was LL's IPO and buyback blowoff to the $140's, orchestrated by financial masterminds behind the scenes.The next scene has the Monster tiring of Madeline Kahn's insatiable demands. That'd be the Tom Sullivan's sparring with Wall Street and the media, fighting with his brother, and being like the hundredth SAP customer to miss a beat on earnings.Then Monster and Doctor transfer all their brains into the doctor, reducing his ""prowess"". The professional managers took over the back office decisions, while Tom's role as the revenue rainmaker increases as he becomes more erratic, suggesting he might buy The Tile Shop or run against Obama on Varney. Then you have the villagers take to the streets with pitchforks, led by an half-blind one-armed Aryan (Tilson).Then the monster does a song and dance to show he's not evil. And the villagers throw tomatoes.So the doc straps down the monster and ends his life. The henchman substitutes the brain of a moron into the carcass, but instead of the pun ""Abby Normal"", he's called ""Know-less"".And finally, the professor/professional is giving lectures in front of a blackboard, without prowess but secure in his mastery of the topic. Still he is angered by students making fun of his name and country of origin. (Chawls, from England. I presume.)Unfortunately, there's nothing before that in the movie to indicate what the stock will do next. Maybe something in the opening credits? Or an earlier Mel Brooks movie?"
