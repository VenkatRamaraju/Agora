"Another zero news day. While new longs might take relief that nothing stupid was announced today, older longs should be furious that our do-nothing management continues to sit around this otherwise profitable company like Melissa McCarthy riding a little girl's Barbie Power Wheels."
"IR page revamped -- New neutral colors. HTML links no longer open to whole document but to outline view. meh.Here's a tip and a fact from Ooh's almanac -- It'll take a lot more than that to improve investor sentiment. And if every page we ""redecorate"" loses some of its functionality, it'll be a real drag on web-based sales for weeks if not quarters. But hey, if it gets rid of Tom Sullivan's signature yellow, it'll be worth it -- that is, to our ad agency, and our marketing interns trying to write their resumes.Separately, checking options this morning after nearly a week, I note over 1500 contracts changed hands yesterday, with an atypically high third of that in out-of-money puts expiring in the next ten days. If it's true that puts expire worthless because most of their volume is sold by people in the know, then the next week or so should show no further drops in price. Free advice worth every penny ..."
"Some causes for concern going into earnings:- INVENTORY - was already low before macro supply chain constriction accelerated and widened. Don't have confidence in LL ability to navigate (mgmt track record / weak balance sheet relative to competition / poor competitive position with suppliers relative to competition - weaker players served last in tough times). This one is huge and scary for this company short term. Heard CEO of Stanley say inventory currently stuck in supply chain at ~6% of annual sales. Scary, and they are well run. Very m,uch hope they handle well, but not confident- INFLATION - would expect HD, LOW, even FND to do better fighting off c / mitigating cost increases from suppliers and transportation providers. Expect LL to lose pricing power, gross margin as a result - OVERHEAD - not doing enough to trim the fat slapped on by Know less, current team adding own- MANAGEMENT - seem oddly focused on re-creating the wheel, instead of getting back to basic execution of a sound business model based on low overhead and focus on sales. The (low overhead) model levers very well. Look back to better times and you see this clearly.Current CEO has essentially been in place since 2019. Though Know less fired in early '20, I believe he would have been gone earlier had it not been for CFO departure. Believe that Charlies was brought in to replace him within 6 months of arrival. So, we're 2+ years in and the market isn't saying this management team is on the right track. Looks increasingly like a (twice) failed turnaround. Understand times are tough, but results just not looking near good enough for me. Maybe one can make $ here on the short side (5.6% of float) but not my game. So much patience needed on this one - which is especially tough given the plentiful, lucrative opportunities in this market."
"Up 0.31%, their diversity pillar is finally pouring in the money."
"And finally, because Yahole is too ""safe and engaging"" to let anyone say anything about the Kabul evacuation anywhere but here in the finance pages, one has to wonder why our cavernous cargo planes are evacuating some 600 to 800 people sitting on the floor, when they could easily load them with one or two levels of empty shipping containers and thereby haul nearly twice or three times as many passengers."
Maybe the reason management doesn't want to share the details of the settlement is because they don't want us to know they only got one magic bean instead of three.
"Since a few of you asked how I could be up total portfolio today of over 1% while taking a beating in ZM (and buying more ZM this morning!!) - my 4 losers today were #ZM #AAPL #COIN and #ME - my winners were #SDC #LL #HOTH #CNK #BABA #F #PRVB #VAL #GE #DAL #DD #MRNA and #DEN Ironically, I like, most of the time, to keep the PEG around 1… last week I was almost all in and needed to free up some cash, so I sold all the stocks outside of near 1 PEG or below… EXCEPT ZOOM! Oh well, I’m still a believer at these levels!!"
"Lo! and Be-hucking Fold!!!News out of the Madison Wisconsin court where out lawsuit against our insurers was to be tried someday once the Mideast freezes over.""Court recordDate Event10-25-2021 Letters/correspondence Additional text: from Atty Jacobs in RE - Parties have settled.""I won't comment on the judge, the court, or the system. Only that, as investors, we've been kept in the dark for over two months and the timing of our agreeing seems contrived to be close to our earnings call next week. Whether they've settled for peanuts or a meaningful sum is in the eye of the beholder, but it is a fact that whenever this case was brought up on this message board, the possibility of winning anything was completely dismissed. So a price drop on ""disappointing settlement news"" is wildly dishonest and unrealistic - like the efficient market theory itself.I expect this is another in a long series of earnings manipulating decisions made after the quarter. And the pattern for years now has been to smooth away any positive surprises in sales or margins and thereby create more cushion for hiring friends, trying daring new marketing concepts (stores without products!), and generally doing anything to put off running Tom Sullivan's business like Tom Sullivan did. So if settling is a positive piece of news, you can bet that there's bad news to go with it -- either an actual sales and margin disappointment, or whining about supply and dread recession, or some ludicrous idea like closing brick and mortar, becoming a lifestyle house, or changing the name again. And you can never rule out dilution with these guys. In a way, they are like the great socialist tyrants whose mass killings were caused by a certainty that socialism could be made to work and that anyone saying otherwise deserved the worst. Stubbornness, not stupidity, is their Achilles heel.https://wcca.wicourts.gov/caseDetail.html?caseNo=2015CV001089&countyNo=13&index=0#records"

"The chances of listening in to yesterday's annual meeting are not looking good this morning. Going to virtualshareholdermeeting, ours is listed under past meetings, but only says ""Broadcast has ended, thanks for watching!"" It appears LL IR may have chosen to seal the meeting for rebroadcast, which is an option apparently that many companies choose. For example, for these May 18 meetings: Old Second Bancorp offers an ""event summary"" of the May 18 meeting, with registration; Sealed Air chose to say ""Thank you for joining. The meeting has now concluded""; and Chipotle has a 28 minute video, slide show, and meeting materials. A quick look at meetings from a week earlier shows the same mix of replay options.So I guess it's up in the air. We may have to write our own transcript as best we can from memory.Off hand, I recall 85% of shares voting. Everyone seemed prepared for the questions. Charles was forthright, but not to the point of stubborn or dogged, responding to an antagonistically worded, but paraphrased, question on PE valuation relative to peers. I think he stated generically to the effect that the strategy of improving sales, margin, etc. would improve earnings. The question challenging marketing generally, and advertising, lack of large format stores, and FND response specifically was answered similarly to the effect of continually monitoring and improving, etc. Board Chair Nancy was able to quickly recite the special project pay of $20,000 a month for her, and $2000 per meeting for the two or three directors working the project(s). (I forgot their names.) She stammered briefly, only one third as long as last year, and it wasn't over any particular awkward point she was making. I have to give her the benefit of the doubt that she may just have a very intermittent stutter/speech thingie. The question on our earnings being misreported by half, was answered by CFO Nancy, who said that it apparently came about due to some taxed adjusted number being misused, and that they have asked that it be corrected. I know we won't get back those three months of having our lamp under a bushel, but management must now know investors look for more than just the SEC filings to be correct.I'm a little embarrassed to have not written down my questions. And I'm surprised that little or no recording or replay of annual meetings is so prevalent after the past year's leaps in video conferencing. Like the open records of the Wisconsin Court, the annual meetings are public, but not so much as you'd notice.If anyone can find or create a recording or transcript to share, it would help investors judge what's going on in Richmond and decide whether to buy, sell or hold this long-troubled stock."
"Remember small, cheap stocks? Hardly anyone else does, either. And yet, they're sparking a huge rally after being dead money for years.Don't worry, you didn't miss out. Eight stocks including consumer discretionary companies Lumber Liquidators (LL), GameStop (GME), MarineMax (HZO) and Tupperware Brands (TUP), driving huge gains, are still in the S&P SmallCap 600 Value index.All these are still in the index for small, cheap stocks even after doubling, or more, this year and rising more than 5% in November alone, says an Investor's Business Daily analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence and MarketSmith.Looking at the small, cheap stocks with the top gains shows some important trends. Many are taking on leadership positions in the market.Six of the eight S&P SmallCap 600 Value stocks up more than 100% this year and 5% this month sport IBD Composite Ratings of 90 or higher. This means their stock appreciation and fundamentals outperform 90% of all other stocks. They've all of these relatively cheap stocks been outperforming, even though their asset class (small value) has suffered.Take Lumber Liquidators. This is a $900 million-in-market-value stock that's up 204% in 2020 so far. The company is benefiting from strong demand for new homes. And just this month, the stock is up 34%. Plus, analysts think the company's profit will jump this year. All this explains Lumber Liquidator's strong 96 IBD Composite Rating, out of 99."
Anybody notice how good value stocks have done this last little while. My portfolio has beefed up quite a bit lately
I've always maintained that I'm a tiny fish as in tiny investor in a big pond but if I sold it would be close to 10% of the daily volume so far. This is crazy how few shares are being traded.
Any chance that FND would ever purchase LL? Seems like the models are too different and LL model has a lot more risk with lower ROI. Just asking
"9:35 AM ET 09/06/2019 - ComtexThe Lumber Liquidators Value Committee, (""LLVC"" or ""the Investor Group"") led by activist investor Mario Rizzi, announces that it strongly supports company founder, Thomas D. Sullivan's recent actions and his announced intentions to reform management and to explore strategic alternatives for Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc. (NYSE: LL) (""Lumber Liquidators,"" or the ""Company""). LLVC members are deemed to beneficially own, in the aggregate, 5.7% of Lumber Liquidators' outstanding common stock.Management Errors and FailuresOver the last three years, leadership at Lumber Liquidators has made countless errors in the company's marketing and sourcing strategies and has failed at basic retail execution. Current management's brand positioning and self-proclaimed high-low retail strategy was a deviation from the company's core value proposition and has proven to be a complete failure. Board members lack retail, sourcing and turnaround experience and this has led to weak oversight and is a fundamental impediment to serving shareholder interests. Our group has tried tirelessly to engage with company leadership, however, every suggestion or proposed change we have put forward, including the appointment of an industry expert to the board, has been rejected. Meanwhile, the company persistently loses money, merchandise sales and customer traffic continue to fall and expenses have ballooned. Shareholders have suffered tremendously as shares have plunged, recently descending to an all time low.The inaction by the board is troubling and the insistence of management to persist with strategies which are clearly not showing progress and are not even being properly executed is indefensible.Time for ChangeThe Investor Group believes the magnitude of value destruction and the board's failure to hold itself and management accountable necessitate dramatic change at the company. We believe that Mr. Sullivan and his team have the knowledge and experience to conduct a comprehensive reform of company operations, management and governance leading to the substantial, positive changes necessary to realign the company's focus and strategy. We support the exploration of strategic options to ensure the future viability of the company and its return to a position of growth, profits and competitive leadership within the home improvement industry.More information about LLVC can be found at http://rebuildll.rizzicapital.com/View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190906005218/en/SOURCE: Lumber Liquidators Value CommitteeMario RizziMario@RizziCapital.comTel: 514-967-9827Copyright Business Wire 2019"
"Between 2009 thru 2014 the annual reports include comments from the ceo of LL listed below. LL hit over $100 a share in September of 2013 on annual earnings in 2012 of $1.68 per share and in 2013 of $2.77 per share. Can LL get to $100 per share again. I sure hope so.2009 Financial HighlightsIn 2009, through our powerful store model and the coordinated efforts of our entire organization, we continued to gain market share in the highly fragmented wood flooring market and realized notable financial achievements. Specifically, we are proud of the following financial accomplishments for the full year:• Net sales growth of 12.9% to $544.6 million;• Increase in our calculation of the number of customers invoiced at our comparable stores of 12.4%;• Gross margin expansion of 90 basis points to 35.7%;• Operating margin expansion of 30 basis points to 8.0%; and• Fully-diluted earnings per share of $0.97 2010 Financial Highlights In 2010, as consumers continued to face weak economic conditions, customers continued to seek value,including a lower retail price point. We tailored our marketing programs throughout the year and were pleased to serve a greater number of these customers in our comparable stores during the year. Our low-cost store model in which new stores quickly become profitable allowed us to achieve our expansion goals for the year, as we opened 37 new stores. Specifically, we achieved:• Net sales growth of 13.9% to $620.3 million;• Comparable store net sales increase of 2.1%;• Increase in our calculation of the number of customers invoiced at our comparable stores of 4.5%;• Gross margin of 34.8%;• Operating margin of 6.8%; and• Fully-diluted earnings per share of $0.932011 Financial HighlightsDuring 2011, our strategic initiatives, including those in sourcing, drove an expansion in our second half operating margin. While the macroeconomic environment remained challenging with consumers continuing to be cautious and price sensitive with regard to large-ticket discretionary purchases, we drove positive traffic throughout the year, and in the fourth quarter of 2011, traffic was positive at comparable stores. Further, we continued to gain market share in our highly fragmented wood flooring market, primarily through new store openings. Specifically, for the full year we reported:• Net sales growth of 9.9% to $681.6 million;• Gross margin expansion of 50 basis points to 35.3%;• Operating margin of 6.2%; and• Fully diluted earnings per share of $0.932012 Financial HighlightsIn 2012, we built a strong foundation upon which we can generate sustainable growth. For the full year, we achieved:• Net sales growth of 19.3% to $813.3 million;• Comparable store net sales growth of 11.4%;• Gross margin expansion of 270 basis points to 38.0%;• Operating margin expansion of 340 basis points to 9.6%; and• Net income increase of 79% to $47.1 million, or $1.68 per diluted share.2013 Financial Highlights The strong support infrastructure that we have built over the past several years through ongoing investment in our value proposition of price, selection, quality, availability and the expertise of our people enabled our motivated sales team to deliver outstanding results. In what we consider a truly special year for Lumber Liquidators, we delivered: - Net sales growth of 23.0% to $1.0 billion; - Comparable store net sales growth of 15.8%; - Gross margin expansion of 310 basis points to a record 41.1%; - Operating margin expansion of 300 basis points to a record 12.6%; - and Net income increase of 64.4% to $77.4 million, or $2.77 per diluted share. 2014 Financial Highlights In 2014, we focused on infrastructure investment, enhanced customer perception and store expansion, all of which will help propel growth. Despite the headwinds of 2014, our team delivered a solid year: - Net sales growth of 4.7% to $1.05 billion; - 34 new stores, bringing our total to 352 stores in 46 states and Canada; and - Fully diluted earnings per share of $2.31"
"I predicted earnings of $0.39, and they exceeded by expectations at $0.41. This company continues to deliver solid cash-flow in just about every environment. And, they have virtually no debt!If we had a normal multiple, we would be in the 40s."
the problem here is that I am not sure when you bread this down that each store is worth $1.5mm - thoughts?

"Over 100,000 shares traded in the last 5 minutes"
Wow. We did go over 1mm - 5th time this year. Interesting that the stock is up 15% on only 1.6mm shares. Let's hope the news is good.
nice trajectory this morning.
"In the first 2 weeks of November 2018, short interest jumped by over 1 million shares. This is also the time when MS reported an increase in their ownership of LL by 1 million shares.Now, as of the last short report, short interest drops by 1 million shares. Is it a coincidence that yesterday MS also announced it had decreased its ownership position in LL by 1 million shares?MS increased their position in LL in Nov 2018 in order to lend out the shares to the shorts. Legally they are obliged to have the shares on hand if they are lending them out. Looking at the October chart, it is possible that MS purchased their 1 million shares in the low 12$ range, maybe high 11$ range. They sold this position over the last weeks, at about the same price. You can clearly see volume spikes over the last 10 days which would have been the selling days. In the meanwhile, they pocketed the lending fee and would have profited off any run higher.All said, MS retains ownership of a small base position. Overall short interest has dropped and checking the availability of shares to short today, they were rather low (under 300 000 on Interactive Brokers). This may prove to be an inflection point. I don't know. But all this seems too much to be simple coincidence, in my opinion."

Somebody knows something based on yesterday and early action today.
"The PlanOperating a company like Lumber Liquidators is relatively straight forward. There is no research and development, no patents, no highly skilled labor. The company buys flooring from large manufacturers and resells it at a markup in retail stores. The company sells over $1.1 billion dollars of flooring per year and has 415 stores across the USA. Yet, the company loses money. Or, to be clear, shareholders lose money. Management makes millions. The board of directors make millions. The flooring suppliers make millions. The company advertisers make millions. But Lumber Liquidators shareholders lose millions.Over the last 4 years, the company has helped millions of Americans purchase and install beautiful flooring in their homes, and the company has not made 1 dollar in profit. Lumber Liquidators is effectively being managed like a flooring charity. Obviously, a change is needed."
Watch for sudden drop !
Another $1.06 quarter should do the trick on this one. LL has done an amazing job at turning around this company. They will now be earning aywhere from $2-3.5 a share annually going forward. Stock price hs been surpressed way too long IMO.
I thought for sure this was going to be the moment that this stock was going to take off and get a reasonable valuation. I guess we will be waiting for one more quarter. 4800 shares at avg cost of $15. My call is for $58 by year end.
looks like over 300k shares right at the end of the day?? That si weird. Any ideas as to why?
"Insider buy - May 30 - Charles Tyson, Chief Cust. Experience Officer, bought 4,000 shares $9.90. Good Start."
"So. After years of trailing FND's big box store model with its warehouse efficiency at the expense of massive headcount per store, LL has decided to match up with FND by ... ? A. Introducing our own large format stores, to provide a head to head comparable shopping experience with local logistic support for current smaller stores, and maximum selection and inventory for pros, all targeted toward markets that FND currently relies on?B. An improved version of its Altamonte store format, leveraging whatever we learned from that two year experiment?C. A program to increase our share of distribution by linking up with top independent flooring retailers through alternative business models like franchising, licensing, supplying our Bellawood brand, and similar arrangements?D. Returning to our pre-Knowles reliance on sales promotion to move off-trend product, and regular ads promising the great savings our small store network is designed for? Or is it ...?E. Renting tiny expensive storefronts to be staffed by the same number of associates without inventory where shoppers can use the same online tools as their phones have?

"Continuing to survey our competitors I find Icork Floor, one of the few whose website doesn't mimic our visualizer tool. It's an interesting contrast between the way their site tries to inform and manage expectations for their cork product's degree of water-resistance and the way ours shows an over-the-top puddle of rainwater splashing on our floors. Given that our water-proof cork products are linked to that poorly chosen graphic, and that our product isn't magically superior to Icork's, one of us must be lying. An investor would think that a management being continually dragged into court for warranty claims would dial back their ad agency's exaggerated artwork. But Richmond seems to feel the legalese in our warranties is as air-tight as our ad agency's depiction of our products is water-tight. But they never seem to try to win those self-inflicted warranty lawsuits, do they? It's almost as if the company was being run by lawyers, for the sake of generating billable hours. https://www.icorkfloor.com/water-resistant-flooring-cork-flooring/"
"I was wondering if someone might join me in a hypothetical. Let's assume they are awarded the full 14M in the lawsuit that was recently listed as ""dismissed"". That is about 20% of their trailing twelve month income of 70M. What affect would that have, if any, if they in fact are on track for a declining forward PE (1.4 vs 2.3 of last year)?"
"Obviously something is not right fundamentally either. If you were to break this down on a per store valuation, each store is worth less than $1.5mm, which means that if it were privately valued each store would have to make say more or less $300k at a 5 multiple and that would be about $120mm per year which is not happening"
"While LL may absolutely suck at stock valuation, earnings per share, store growth, cost control, staying out of court in the first place, once there staying in court long enough so the plaintiffs attorney don't get dizzy from the revolving courthouse door, writing on-strategy copy, writing humorous copy, writing informative copy, buying media to reach potential rather than former customers, sourcing from outside China, etc. etc. -- we do apparently excel at touching all the bags, diversity wise. I was especially intrigued by our closing statement. ""At LL Flooring, we are committed to bringing diverse, talented individuals to a place they want to turn their job into a career."" So does that mean we just pay them more and more for less and less until they decide to stay? Because that seems to be how things work in Richmond ...https://www.learn4good.com/jobs/dallas/texas/hr_and_recruitment/588310984/e/"
Volume is HUGE so far!
I think it is time to start covering…LL is now trading near 52 week lows instead of mid range. This stock is a huge value play. The long investors will rewarded greatly if patient.
"And, in other news not specifically related to LL, Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero has written a piece that inadvertently strayed out of her lane dangerously close to the center line. Since Yahoo's censors have judged it too edgy for ""safe and engaging"" conversation, I'll meekly recount that it quotes numerous onsite workers at the west coast ports blaming the slowdown on union and regulatory decisions, apparently arbitrary. So if your investment thesis is shortages forever and inflation to the moon, you may want to hedge your bitcoin exposure. But the alternative truth of an expanding middle-class and an excess of goods chasing the currency of the world's last respected superpower leading to transitory inflation, and possible recession, seems unlikely as well. The only way out may be if the cure for high prices is high prices, as they say in the oil patch.https://news.yahoo.com/as-supply-crisis-worsens-truckers-and-dock-workers-all-say-dont-blame-us-125007621.html"
"I'm calling BS on yesterday afternoon's price action and especially this morning's. All the news is good. Proceeding in Wisconsin, large and growing $14 put position the same as we saw before TS's announcement, positive movement on tariffs this morning, and a new ad airing the past few days that's significant not for the ad but for being a sign that Knowles has finally realized that increasing sales is part of our solution.And meanwhile, the stock craters in the premarket where the volume is light and the trading more easily manipulated.We should see $14 this week. My only concern is that no puts have been written above $14 yet. But the writer gets all the action he needs with near the money options, and if he's in the loop on an eventual offer, he has no reason to telegraph his bid price by buying at that exact strike."
"On LL website:“We are pleased to have reached resolution with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, and are committed to our customers, compliance, transparency, and accountability across our organization and from our vendors. Lumber Liquidators has undergone a complete transformation in recent years and today is a new company led by an entirely new management team. We continue focusing on providing quality products, services and experiences for our valued customers and stakeholders.”UPDATE ON DISCLOSURE MATTERSThe Company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to resolve its charge of securities fraud in connection with the Company’s Form 8-K filing in March 2015. The agreement with the DOJ stated the charges are deferred and will be dismissed after three years provided that the Company meets certain obligations, many of which are already implemented.The Company entered into a settlement of an administrative proceeding with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and applicable rules. Notably, neither the DOJ nor the SEC made any findings regarding the safety or quality of the Company’s laminate flooring previously sourced from China.As a result, Lumber Liquidators has agreed to pay a fine in the amount of $19.1 million, and restitution of $13.9 million, of which up to $6.1 million will be paid to the SEC in disgorgement and prejudgment interest. As part of its relevant considerations, the DOJ noted that Lumber Liquidators’ “employees involved in wrongdoing either were terminated or resigned from the Company, and the Company replaced its executive management team with experienced executives who have displayed a commitment to building an ethical corporate culture.”In the lead-up to these agreements, Lumber Liquidators has incorporated extensive remedial measures that include the implementation and enforcement of a comprehensive compliance, ethics, and reporting program, as well as training and guidance on relevant policies and procedures.These resolutions are an acknowledgment of our good faith and relentless efforts to transform our company and demonstrate our commitment to our customers, compliance, transparency and accountability across our organization and from our vendors.DEMONSTRATING COMMITMENT TO INTEGRITY AND COMPLIANCELumber Liquidators has invested significantly in improvements to our compliance policies and procedures and related remediation efforts, and undergone a complete management transformation since the spring of 2015. • The Board moved aggressively to bring in a new and highly experienced leadership team that would emphasize a culture of sound business practices, honesty, integrity and accountability for what we sell and what we say. • The new management team has taken steps to broaden and integrate integrity and compliance throughout our operations, including driving improvements to, and oversight of, Lumber Liquidators’ vendor relationships. • We retained outside subject matter experts to evaluate and make recommendations concerning our policies, procedures and practices, including compliance issues related to U.S. California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). • Our Integrity Hotline is consistently monitored and available to employees, vendors, and third-party partners.ENSURING SAFETY OF OUR PRODUCTSThe U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission closed its investigation of Lumber Liquidators’ Chinese-sourced laminate products without issuing a product recall. We believe this is validation that the formaldehyde levels met requirements and demonstrates the products were safe. • Lumber Liquidators voluntarily removed the product from the market to allay customer concerns, and the company no longer sells this product. • The Company has instituted strong quality and compliance programs to provide assurance that, no matter where products are sourced, we are confident that compliance, quality and safety requirements have been met. • We have developed a rigorous on-boarding process for vendors. This vetting process includes due diligence, onsite audits, and testing of product. • We have an audit program which validates that vendors that meet our requirements. Internal and external experts vet and approve new vendors, audit and gauge their compliance with our requirements and the law, and assist the Company in following up with vendors to ensure each one takes appropriate action to address findings. • We invested in an expansive and voluntary home air testing program. These third-party tests showed that no floor samples exceeded World Health Organization (WHO) emissions levels and that test results looked statistically similar to prior studies of normal households."
"When catalina marketing estimates the hard surface flooring market increased at 11% and LL's material sales comped below 5% I would not exactly call it a great quarter. FND is grabbing share massively. As they indicated in the call their market share is well over 30% in mature markets. Now some of LL's problems are self-imposed: poor inventory management, too cautious during COVID but not entirely management's fault as they were in a precarious financial position at the start of the pandemic, brand change in the middle of the hottest market in decades (completely management's fault), and market pricing mistakes that makes them uncompetitive vs big box and FND.the good news is the balance sheet is finally fixed, and now LL just needs to replenish its inventory. Unfortunately, the moved out of China too quickly as container shortages are even more acute in SE Asia vs China. This should be resolved in the next couple of quarters, but they may surrender a lot more share to FND. Once LL gets its inventory back to normal, pays off its legacy debt and its term loan, it will be out of cash, but can then begin to recapture lost market share. Hopefully, the COVID boom is still chugging along!Good luck"
"They(Chuckie and Nancy) are laughing at us, they don't care. The stock is about to go under $18."
"Yesterday I shut up, and LL shot up. But I also shut up Friday when it tanked. So at the risk of jinxing more gains, I wonder if anyone has any hypotheses about our moving higher when the marker driving news of the day is the prospect of higher interest rates denting the growth heavy Nasdaq. The news of higher rates must not signal a particular risk for flooring or FND would be trending with us. And if increasing rates are affecting the more indebted stocks, that doesn't explain the resilience in the oil patch.So is the link between LL's price and the time value of money due to that money having been bet against LL and presumably having to unwind those bets when ZIRP ends?Or is yesterday's bounce for LL just the front half of one of the market's regular pump and dump stunts before bad news?Or maybe the second half of the opposite scam of smash and grab before good news? After all we've taken quite a dip in the week or two leading up to yesterday. And we know that a major lawsuit settled ..."
Any chance of HD buying this?
"James, it is hanging above the moving average with no volume. What is your take? Cheers."
"Lumber Liquidators Holdings LL, -18.37% said it swung to a fourth-quarter profit of $16.4 million, or 57 cents a share, as sales rose to $273.9 million from $268.9 million. The retailer of hard-surface flooring said comparable-store sales rose 0.4% as adjusted EPS was 56 cents. Analysts polled by FactSet expected earnings of 23 cents on sales of $272 million. Lumber Liquidators issued a 2020 outlook that excluded the possible supply-chain disruptions from coronavirus, as it also expects the continuation of Section 301 tariffs at 25% on currently tariffed Chinese imports while also assuming tariff exclusions granted in 2019 on vinyl and engineered ""click"" product remain in effect for all of 2020 despite a currently proposed August 2020 expiration. The outlook calls for low-single-digit growth in comparable-store sales and an adjusted operating margin between 2.7% to 3.5%, compared to the 2019 adjusted operating margin of 2.3%."
"Tilson’s Latest Reasoning:“He says Lumber Liquidators is a buy for a number of reasons: 1 The executives responsible for the scandal have left the company. 2 Lumber Liquidators recently settled its remaining lawsuits related to the scandal. 3 It has a great business. 4 He sees margins tripling over the next three years.Tilson says the company's share price, which is now near $11, is out of whack with the fundamentals. He notes that operating margins were only 1.9% in 2018 because of the high legal costs related to the scandal. Now that the scandal is in the rear-view mirror, Tilson says operating margins could reach 6% over the next two years, causing shares to double or even triple.”"
"In case, anyone is breathing easy, here's another way for Knowles to screw up and for shareholders to get screwed.We all know the tariffs are usually billed as ""across the board"". But when you go to the trade representative's site, you find long lists of excluded products, usually with incredibly specific descriptions. I'm sure that nothing in the official description would say so but I believe these exclusions are favors being granted to specific industries and companies. The art of the deal is to get an exception granted for the product you sell, but to word the exception so that your competition has to go on paying the tariff or redesign their product to match yours. E.g., ""(10) Inflatable kayaks and canoes, with over 20 gauge polyvinyl chloride (PVC), each valued at $500 or less and weighing not over 22 kg (described in statistical reporting number 8903.10.0060)”"" It's a sure bet that the company that requested this exception, imports kayaks over 20 gauge, weighing under 22 kg, and likes the price point of $500. But what's less obvious is whether their competitor's kayaks are under 20 gauge, over 22 kg, and sell for $600.What all this has to do with LL is this. We need our crack team of lawyers to follow this and make sure we aren't cut out of any relief on tariffs. That assumes of course they can find the time after their more important duties. Between writing up generous offers after the close of each quarter that just happen to be of an amount that neatly eliminates any earnings left after Dennis picks out new office furniture, and the yoga lessons for the flexibility needed to bow, scrape and low-crawl into and out of the courtroom, I'm sure Reeves is very busy. I guess he will decide to hire more lawyers."

Now, as clear an idea as that can't survive, even for the father of the delightful Jill Townsend. So the zeitgeist replaced that with Say Anything's line about young man unwilling to make or sell or repair anything, ""as a career"". So I get that for a job to be FUN and EXCITING, there can't be any real work involve. But what does it say about our HR functionaries that they don't even find their work intriguing enough to edit the ""FUN and EXCITING"" boilerplate? I guess that's why they didn't use it for the HR Systems Administrator listing."
"Lumber Liquidators Announces Fourth Quarter And Full Year 2019 Financial ResultsPR NewswireRICHMOND, Va., Feb. 25, 2020RICHMOND, Va., Feb. 25, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Lumber Liquidators (NYSE: LL), a leading specialty retailer of hard-surface flooring in North America, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2019.(PRNewsfoto/Lumber Liquidators)""During the quarter, we made continued progress implementing our transformational plan designed to reinvigorate our brand and position us to deliver exceptional value in the hard-surface flooring marketplace,"" said Interim President and Chief Customer Experience Officer Charles Tyson. ""Comparable store sales grew slightly in the quarter, and profitability improved significantly, in large part due to the tariff exclusions announced by the U.S. Trade Representative in November.""""Reflecting on the full year, 2019 was especially dynamic with an ever-changing tariff environment,"" Tyson continued. ""Our tariff mitigation efforts in 2019, coupled with the exclusions announced in November, allowed us to substantially improve gross margins while remaining focused on delivering value to customers. As we enter 2020, we remain focused on three key areas – delivering enhanced profitability, driving traffic to our stores and online, and improving the customer experience.""Fourth Quarter ResultsNet sales for the fourth quarter of 2019 increased $4.9 million, or 1.8%, to $274 million as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. Comparable store sales increased 0.4% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 driven by sales growth in the vinyl plank category offset, in part, by weakness in bamboo and laminate. The Company opened two new stores and closed two stores in the fourth quarter of 2019.Gross profit increased 17% in the fourth quarter of 2019 to $112 million as compared to $96 million in the comparable period in 2018. Gross margin expanded to 40.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019 from 35.7% in the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily due to the retroactive exclusion of tariffs on certain flooring products imported from China discussed under ""Tariff Recovery"" below. The fourth quarter of 2019 was unfavorably impacted by countervailing duty rate changes and the fourth quarter of 2018 was favorably impacted by classification adjustments related to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (""HTS""). Excluding these items as shown on the table that follows, Adjusted Gross Profit (a non-GAAP measure) increased by $18 million and Adjusted Gross Margin (a non-GAAP measure) improved to 41% this quarter from 35.1% in the fourth quarter of 2018. As noted, the margin increase was primarily driven by the retroactive tariff exclusions. The period was also favorably impacted by a larger mix of higher-margin manufactured products, reduced discounting in the stores, merchandising cost-out efforts, and selective retail price increases earlier in 2019. See ""Non-GAAP and Other Information"" below for a discussion of our use of non-GAAP items and a reconciliation of non-GAAP results.Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses decreased 39% in the fourth quarter of 2019 to $93 million from $151 million in the comparable period in 2018. SG&A in both quarters included incremental legal as well as other costs and credits related to lawsuits, investigations and certain other legal matters, with the most substantial being $61 million in accruals related to legal settlements recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018. Adjusted SG&A (a non-GAAP measure) increased $5.4 million to 33.9% as a percentage of sales, 130 basis points higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to higher advertising, additional costs related to six net new stores compared to the fourth quarter a year ago, higher year-over-year incentive compensation and equity accruals, and costs related to the corporate headquarters relocation that occurred in fourth quarter of 2019.Operating income was $19 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to an operating loss of $55 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. Adjusted Operating Income (a non-GAAP measure) was $19 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to $6.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. The most significant driver of the increase was the impact on Adjusted Gross Margin from the retroactive exclusion of tariff on certain flooring products as well as additional efforts to enhance gross profit, partially offset by an increase in Adjusted SG&A.Income tax expense was $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to income tax expense of $0.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase was driven by higher taxable income leading to the complete depletion of the Company's Federal net operating losses.Net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $16 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $57 million, or $1.99 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter"
We can attribute their gains today to their disdain for hiring white males. Their commitment to hiring based on traits born innately and superfluous to their ability to sell flooring is a clear path to success.
"Some people have said that the lawsuit is settled - is that actually accurate and if so, I would think they would have to announce something? My guess is that it actually is not settled as though I am not sure, they would be required to announce if it were."
"Private equity or strategic partner?So there has been some discussion on the LLVC forum as well as some offline that LL was being cued up for a private equity transaction. I concede the thought but disagree.Private equity likes to run after dustressed assets, picking them off very cheaply and offering support to an otherwise untenable situation. By way of example, look at Sycamore Partners various acquisitions. All were deeply troubled retail operations nearing bankruptcy. As such, Sycamore never paid more than .3x sales. PE players are financial buyers who rely on heavy upfront discounts to make profit 3-5 years later. They do make operational changes, but these are not as impactful due to lack of expertise and more emphasis on cash-on-cash returns. So Sycamore would buy big names at deep discounts.What LL needs is a strategic buyer with a presence in the building materials space, with existing delivery ( inhouse trucking), backroom, and promo operations. LL is a big-little-national with very expensive freight to store, wildly expensive advert and promo, and out of control admin costs. LL operates in a very narrow, non-diverse category which has been long-ago outmoded. LL is in a box. Due to store size and operating costs its difficult to diversify.A number of these weaknesses goes away with a sale to an existing building materials operation with trucking, promo, and backroom in place. There are at least 700-1000 bps in savings in those areas that a financial buyer would not be able to leverage.Our discussion of pricing and margin is all but moot in the presence of tariffs and what i believe will become secular changes in the competitive landscape in the floooring category. LL can no longer compete on price, as price is not the issue. The issue is traffic. The issue is also spending. LL cannot afford a heavy promo budget while at the same time lowering pricing. There is a balance between traditional ad spending and the return from increased traffic.Lets hope that management sees it this way and elects to sell this thing."
"Separately, I don't speak the language of technical analysis and I haven't heard of any ""pairs"" type chart work looking at two stocks at once. But I find it interesting that since our September 9 announcement of ""showroom"" stores without inventory, we are down 3.6%. Meanwhile, since FND's October 13 announcement of electric vehicle charging stations, their stock is up 15.2%. Now, maybe those press releases are just that bad and good, respectively. But what are the odds that this is some news-supported setup for a swing in the relative valuation of both stocks? FND reports first, and personnel might be a problem with 50 employees per store, given its euphoria-forever valuation. And FND's hiring issues would, of course be a tremendous hit to LL with its, what?, four employees per store? Then we report the following week, 10 weeks after reaching an agreement with our insurersthat somehow just couldn't quite get finalized before earnings, there'd be a perfect setup for good news from the Land of Cheese courtroom.But of course, you can't bet on anything when it comes to LL. Our ace in the hole legal team (the #$%$) might not finalize things for another month. And if bickering over a comma here or a split infinitive there means LL's valuation collapses on meh earnings before a glorious melt-up in December after the muppets have been shaken hard one last time, that's no concern of Charles Tyson's, is it? That's what he said in the last annual meeting, after all. Not ""in so many words"" but almost verbatim. But try getting a transcript of that from Investor Relations. But it's funny how quickly our legal team can concede when they get the signal. Marvin used to refer to this as ""catching a plane"". The real question is who decides when LL makes bad news, and how much money does he make on that news."

Tim advises clients on making coverage determinations, drafting coverage position letters and litigating coverage actions. He addresses coverage issues for underlying claims, ranging from mass torts and pollution losses to actions against nursing care facilities and managed care organizations. His practice includes advising insurers on claims arising under various liability insurance policies, including commercial general liability, excess, professional and pollution liability. """
"LL has now posted 6 straight quarters of earnings and 7 out of 8 quarters with earnings. Last year the highest EPS forecast was $1.86 and they actually had EPS of $2.27. LL announced they will open 12-15 stores this year, still a growth story. Possible lawsuit money from insurance companies to come if they win their case. PE ratio of 14.86 v FND’s 50.42LL had sales of over $300M in one quarter and the current market is $687MFND had annul sales of 2.4B and current market cap is almost 9BWe still have another quarter of COVID meaning people will stay home and still remodel plus the spring time is the busiest building time of the year. Why don’t I have $50k laying around? I could be on the verge of an early retirement with this stock once the manipulation stops."
"Searching on our name looking for news, I found this scrappy Canadian upstart. At least their IR page offers a glimmer of a rationale for investing in their stock. I also note that all of our PR drivel is released through a contractor called ""one simple plan. I wonder whether they leak our upcoming news events to the street. That'd be one simple plan for shorts to manage news risk. https://ir.builddirect.com/why-invest/default.aspx"
"A shareholder friendly management would have it Investor Relations department put together some kind of statement concerning the drop last week. If it's tricky to do so legally, they should have dragged Legal into the office this weekend to help them say whatever is legal. And if it's somehow illegal to give an explanation, they should issue a notice that they cannot give an explanation. But we'll see today whether Knowles once again leaves investors twisting in the wind, the last ones to find out any news."
"This pop to $17 is nice. But Laura Champine in particular, and Loop Capital in general, are such lightweights that their upgrade is an excuse for a move that needed to happen, not the cause for one. The real catalysts; an insurance settlement, an M&A deal to erase debt, or a reorg to cut Knowles's overhead, -- those are still only blowing in the wind. No SEC filings. The only news announced in Wisconsin is St. Paul's supplemental Brief on Choice of Law, which looks routine. So it looks like today we are no closer to any of the possible improvements to the fundamentals. Today feels like a return to the stock's previous gyrations, or even a setup raising expectations for earnings, to be followed by disappointment. I aim to make a lot more money than today's $3.50. So I'm looking to roll today's gains into more shares, if it breaks that way. But it would be really odd, for this stock, to have good news announced by an analyst that led to a lasting increase in price. It's never that simple, or that kind to investors. GLTAL!"
"If this breaks the 50 day hard, I'll buy some shares! But that's asking a lot."
"Updated D/E = 0.35Will decline further as stock climbs.Management states cash flows for H2 will be used for reupping inventories. I know people have been screaming at management for more stores, but keep in mind that have like 70M in accounts payable and massively depleted inventory. Building new stores before reigning in their checkbook and inventory would be placing the carriage before the horse. Some, especially the shorts,, want everything all at once, but one must realize they are limited by their balance sheet. Management has really shown great fiscal discipline. If you look back, at the restructuring I am impressed.:1 2020 Close unproductive stores. 2. 2021 12-15 new stores, increase cash3. Build out online and pros market4. replenish inventory.4. Build new stores."
"Hmm amazing this #$%$ has retraced this far. Geez they have over $100mm in cash and a $9.00 book value - one would think a group could use the company cash in a takeover bid. I wonder if fundamentally going forward, things are really that bad. The fact we have no institutional interest even at these levels is concerning."
Surprised no one has mentioned this yet. CEO Charles Tyson purchases another $50k worth using his own money and another director purchased $100k worth with their own money.
"In other news, Bill Clinton has been admitted to the hospital for a non-covid infection. Now, I don't know Bill Clinton, but I have a very successful cousin whose friends surely include someone who knows Bill Clinton. So I'm pretty sure the infection must in his ball-sack. His tired, STD-ravaged ball-sack. (To keep this PG rated, I left it at STD-ravaged, and didn't say Hillary-humping, Flowers-deflowering, Jones-jonesing, or Lewinsky-licked. And I only included the contacts he admits to, not the several credible accusations of rape.) But I'm waiting for Nicky Minaj to confirm my diagnosis, and The View to deny it. Then we'll know for sure."
"Long time share holder that is now a bag holder. I did buy a lot sub $10 but got greedy and was slaughtered and should have sold it all at $30+, counted my blessings and moved on. Look at that YTD chart $30 and heading to sbu $18. SHOULD I just sell it all (all long term) and just move on and learn the lesson of what happens to the greedy pig. Thoughts?"
"Tilson last night on ValueWalk:“3) I’ve been getting some questions about how the jump in tariffs might affect Lumber Liquidators (LL), which I recommended in the first issue of the Empire Investment Report last month. It’s complicated… In the short run, it will crimp margins, though not as much as you might think. And in the long run, it may actually benefit the company (and the stock).I’ll be sharing my full analysis with my subscribers in the second monthly issue,”"
"I was quite worried about margins for Q1. However, after their report came out I became much more competent. My concern was that with tariffs reinstated and having worked through their inventory, supply chains were damaged, and shipping costs were through the roof, we would possibly be seeing devastating results. This turned out not being the case and their earnings had major a major positive surprise. The next fudster argument is that they can't compete with the big stores. The flooring market is tremendously fragmented. Take a moment and search for flooring stores. Most of you will see quite a variety. Yes, I feel like a lot of smaller businesses will fall prey to consolidation. However, LL is one of the big fish in the sea, as stores close their piece of the pie will grow and not shrink. I don't see one company capturing 100% of the sales from a ma-and-pa shop closing down. This hasn't been the case yet, and I don't see it happening tomorrow."
James?? what do your charts say. 1mm+ shares and a close toward the high seems awesome??
This thing is just going to trade sideways here at the bottom until a favorable CEO is named and another earnings proves consistency on improved margins. The big money needed here is in no mood for speculation.
"good grief, how can this thing be down almost 3$ on 40k shares? James, still holding the 50. Still bullish?"
"I didn't realize how many people read this forum until I saw how many downvotes manbysea got. Gave me a good chuckle.Today was a fruitful day. I guess I'm growing sentimental of my shares, because I only peeled away a couple covered calls today."
"LL's business model is intact. More small stores with fewer, better paid people and national credibility from advertising and internet is still ""right things right"". That combination outflanks big boxes on service, independents on credibility, FND on cost, and Empire on DIY.But this management has shoehorned the wrong consumer model into this otherwise successful business model.The right consumer model is based on the one unchanging truth of flooring -- that it lasts a long time. Because of that, the people who use flooring everyday also almost never have to buy flooring. And so they are unfamiliar -- with how it's installed, how much it costs, and how long it should last. Most people have never bought a floor and so take them totally for granted. (Landlords attest to this.) And practically no one buys a floor until the previous one is obviously damaged either by abuse or some disaster -- natural or remodeling.So, mathematically some 80% of each year's customers buy about 20% of the square footage. They only buy one time for a home they own, and in smaller amounts per purchase than pros. These infrequent buyers know next to nothing. They don't want to get ripped off, but they really don't know what that means in terms of price or durability. They might DIY if they knew it was easy and goof-proof. And because they'll pay for what they want, this 20% of floors from 80% of buyers generates probably 50% of flooring profits (2.5x the average profit per sq ft).Empire depends almost entirely on these first time/one time buyers, promising them cheap and easy new floors. FND dazzles them with overhead and pallets of inventory, while promising price and selection. HD and Lowes lets such people DIY if they can figure it out but prefers them to use their installers. Flooring is always a big-box afterthought; they don't care if you don't know what you're buying. Indies vary wildly from interior design gals to guys selling flooring ""from the back of a trucking yard in Massachusetts"".And for that 80% of buyers, LL at one time was the only convenient store with a national name where you could find out what floors would work in your house, see all the floors with your own eyes, and often get an unbeatable price offer. With tools available for DIYs and installers for DIFMs, and a website that gushed with advice, we were a perfect fit for them.And not only that, back when we only helped buyers hook up with independent installers, we were a go-to place for contractors and installers whose customers wanted to look at different floors before making a decision. We likely got half of our business through this symbiotic relationship with pros -- before we cut them out with our own dedicated installers.Meanwhile, the other 80% of floors are bought by the other 20% of customers -- flippers, landlords, contractors, realtors looking to make a sale, etc. They buy floors often so they know what flooring costs. They care more about the money they can make on the job than how long it lasts, except for landlords interested in the lowest cost long-term (durability, ease of repairs). No one in this group cares about style beyond what's safe and popular. And their value focus means that profits are lower, maybe 63% of category average.These frequent buyers know Empire hides their higher price somewhere, but realtors know a fast new floor can save a sale. Lowes, HD and FND are equally convenient. Designer indies are irrelevant, but a guy with a truck, or an outlet, etc is worth the price for some. And LL was a price competitive choice for these people as well, when we still competed on price.The above understanding of the consumer and purchaser explains why personal explanations will always matter for the side of the business that doesn't buy often. And why price will always matter for the other side.Today we have a bunch of elites from business schools padding their resumes with business changes to impress their friends who might hire them someday. We let blue-collar Knowles give us nationwide dedicated installers, and thereby slap 90% of local pros in the face. We let Nancy Walsh skimp on store growth for her financial resume. And Charles Tyson gets rid of the price focused advertising directed at everyone that still seems to work for Empire. Instead, he creates tasteful, quiet ads about loving utilitarian taken-for-granted floors to stimulate category demand. But then he runs it on the cheap no-reach HGTV to people already so category-involved that they watch a 24/7 home rehab channel. (And by the way, if anyone in Richmond has watched those channels lately, the story line is no longer about how to refresh a room with a floor, but how to flip a $1.2M foreclosure by doubling the floor space. Does that sound any the customers described above?)Net, there's nothing wrong here that a return to basics couldn't fix. But Richmond can't admit any mistake. So here we are, and there you go."
"Interline BrandsAn interesting purchase by Home Depot. They paid about 1x sales for this barely profitable, levered company. The company had similar financing arrangements, ie, asset based lender. The company resolved significant legal problems just prior to the merger announcement.An easy read. It demonstrates what will be paid by huge companies. HD was pursuing the pro customer, as is Lowes at the moment....https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1292900/000129290015000036/ibi-10qxfy15xq2.htm"
Cannot figure out how this can move so much on almost no volume?
"LL is the last standalone building materials retail company in the US. Not counting HD Lowes or Menards, virtually every other building products company has been rolled up by strategic or financial buyers. There is a reason for that: margins are increasingly compressed and operating costs are rising. Building products companies run on a strong and efficient backroom, distribution, and promo platform. LL has none of that and is struggling as a 'big-little-national' using common carriers, expensive promo over a wide footprint, and having no connections to otherwise lever in a massive space called building materials. Its not easy being cheesy. Its not cheap, either.So the fight for market share goes on. FnD is going right after HD and Lowes by installing stores within their locales. HD and Low sells $7b and $4b in flooring each year, and FnD wants a big bite out of that. To be honest, its easy to steal share from a mass merchandiser with just marginally better service and selection. While LL is likely not a direct FnD target, they tend to suffer the most as the pricing and promo fight heats up between the big boxes. Its like the fox and the rabbit (LL being the rabbit). The rabbit is running for its life, while the fox is running for its next meal.Its no wat to operate a company. LL has a shaggy balance sheet and virtually no cash. Of course they have borrowing power, but that isn't strength, it just might serve as a hangmans noose if they start borrowing to expand stores. LL should keep its small format. They aren't going to compete with FnD, but will ruin themselves trying.Eventually, FnD will begin to have decreasing returns as they run out of ideal markets.The pitch is this: i dont think LL can achieve an acceptable return on $1B in sales due to the competitive environment. They need to partner up, ie sell to a stronger player who will leverage costs."
Why is LL ROIC so bad?
"When I complain about this stock, the other side of the argument seems to be ""It's not that easy to run a business"" or ""How could they have done any better?""My regular searches for some glimmer of news or the merest mirror-fogging sign of life discovered yet another competitor - BestLaminate. To read their webpage, which also has our floor visualizer capability BTW, becoming a pretty significant player in flooring is as easy as throwing a few pallets of flooring into the family shipping container during a move from Europe, selling those fast enough to justify renting a space, moving that project online, and promising to match anyone's price. Now, I'm sure some newer longs are wondering why our Richmond brain trust hasn't tried that yet. But older longs will remember when that's exactly what we did and exactly how we built this business, with sales growth and store growth etc. before Tom Sullivan was forced out. And since he got cancelled for formaldehyde, the current management has to do the opposite and undo everything they inherited. (Deja vu, much?)But somebody, somewhere, with a few pallets of flooring is willing to do what it takes to grow. Like the old saying that while you're resting, someone on the other team is training, and when you meet it won't be fun if they're in better shape than you are."
"You'd never know it from either Yahoo's ""news"" articles about LL or our own IR page, but Wednesday, the day after tomorrow, will be LL's annual meeting. It will be a virtual event like last year, and if it's run like last year, you will get a chance to vote your proxies at the beginning of the meeting, without any discussion of the issues, and after the website to vote is read out, you will have less than two minutes to log on and vote. So you will vote beforehand if you want to have your vote recorded. Last year's meeting had the lowest voter participation % for individual investors in years; I believe the fact that investors for the first time could listen in live caused many of us to not vote, for waiting to hear the arguments and decide justly. Bag that! If you wait, you will likely not vote. Just the way management wants.Wait! Why would I say management wants to reduce individual investor participation? Because, as I said above, there is no mention of the annual meeting except in out SEC filings. Even worst, when you click on the IR FAQs, the second item is ""When is Lumber Liquidators' next annual meeting of stockholders scheduled to take place?"" followed by ""You may find this information on the Events page."" Now, there is no mention of the annual meeting on the Events page, so I guess that the information provided depends on the meaning of the word ""may"" (or ""you"" or ""on"" or ""find ...). I supposed providing contradictory incorrect information on your IR page on the eve of an annual meeting doesn't rise to the level of a shareholder lawsuit. But I would happily, joyfully participate in such a suit, even to the point of being an identified representative of the injured ""class"". But beyond whether or not you get to vote, I'd like to ask how you plan to vote. Is there anything mgt. could say at this point that could change your mind? I will not change my vote; it is based on the past year which cannot be changed. But it would be welcome news to hear of any plan to resume growth, compete with FND, or at a minimum put a positive upbeat spin on events by resuming guidance, etc. Really, I'd settle for anything that refutes the simplest, most obvious explanation for management behavior which is that since they changed their incentive bonus to be based on three year improvement, they will now do as little as possible to support the stock until two and three quarter years have elapsed.But I expect the usual beatdown of long investors. The big boys have already made their side bets to hedge whatever dump they plan to take; there is no news or event to attract new money and new longs so it's up to all of us to suffer another vicious dip and hold. If enough of us give up and sell then the side bets will pay off and the price will be off to the races like a thoroughbred that's thrown its jockey at the gate. But if we stay in the saddle, he'll stroll around the infield eating daisies and poison ivy in a passive aggressive attempt to destroy us.VOTE NO!!!!!"
"Let's Go, Tyson!"
does anyone think these kiosks are a good idea at all? And who the heck is gonna buy flooring from a kiosk and they are counting them as stores. Am I being cynical or is there an argument for this?
"It's not exactly LL related, and 20-20 hindsight is easy at the end of 35 years of success in flooring, but I found this interview insightful. https://www.floordaily.net/floorfocus/focus-on-leadership-jeff-hamar-talks-about-his-journey-to-becoming-head-of-one-of-the-indust"

"-9 months ago Tilson announces he's back in LL and recommends people load up all the way to $14. Is he still accumulating at these low levels?-5 months ago TS says he's buying up shares and looking to purchase company, stock price rises to $13 in just a few days-Insurance settlements have taken place-tariffs have been eliminated-upcoming quarterly/yearly announcement due out soon-near highest level of short interest at this momentI sure as heck wouldn't want to be short at this point in the game. One or more of these events coming together at the same time could be a massive short covering with a double or triple of the stock price in a very short amount of time."
"Browsing through our home page, I note we've bit hard on some kind of European cork floor that's supposed to be waterproof. While I'm sure it wins some EU seal of approval for sustainability, you can bet it will disappoint Americans as much as other green foreign floors have. Remember bamboo? So while Hydro-cork may be woke enough not to be sold, processed, repaired, or ultimately bought, it will be litigated to death. Maybe that's why we're the sole North American distributor. But why worry? We all know what tigers our legal team can be.Drilling down further into the online style catalog, I am concerned about the lack of diversity. Sure, we've checked the boxes as far as skin color, but all the images reflect a mono-cultural bourgeois Western prosperity. And I don't think just adding someone in wheelchair will do, that's just a white supremacist dog-whistle. Obviously. What we need is real diversity -- androgynous K-pop stars, the sherpa who climbed with Hillary, that slave with all the scars, the Afghan girl from the Nat Geo cover, some of the cancer survivors from the quit smoking ads, and a fly-covered Bangladeshi baby. And, just to be fair, add a real fat American guy just one sausage biscuit away from a coronary. But put him in tie-dye and throwing a frisbee. Gotta show progress is possible, right?"
"No time for an extended rant -- gotta be brief. If any new investor thinks the last seven day's new heights and volumes behind plunging day-traders are hinky, welcome to the elementary school of hard knocks. The previous seven weeks' beatdown over the name and lack of volume behind tariff relief was the setup and is your high school curriculum. The previous seven month's swings behind malware, Sullivan, the tariff terror, and legal fake-news/old news is a college course. And that means the past seven years -- the post-IPO cuddling, the buy-back pay-back for early investors, Sullivan's hubris to ruin someone's carve-up of TTS by threatening to buy it after earlier threatening to run for president, the following media and regulatory (and later judicial) takedown, the creation of a home-improvement ETF for side-bets, the financial immaculation-coronation-ascension of FND -- all that is PhD rocket science.As far as the conference call, I only listened to it once, although I plan to listen again while reading and editing the transcript. But I don't recall ever hearing the chairman of the board sit in -- that signals change. And I haven't heard the suits effusively praise the sales team since Tom's final conference call when he said ""Sell more wood!"". I didn't feel the earth move. But I think I felt a tingle up my leg. Fingers crossed.Finally, I spent a little time on the website checking out the Floor-finder. Starting out playacting as someone at the earliest planning phase, I found the detail lacking but judged it a good intro into the subject for someone not yet ready to get into the weeds. I was disappointed that the level of detail and information was the same regardless of my level of project commitment. I'd rate it a baby step in the right direction. Tirerack, IMO, sets the standard for balancing basic, minimal info for casual buyers and unlimited detail for enthusiasts. There's a lot of work to be done. It's a target rich environment for improvements to our business. No need to despair, just now. All in my opinion, of course. GLTAL! EEFOAD!"
"In other news, Joy Reid has called out the inherent racism of the Gabby Petito coverage as ""missing white woman syndrome"". If that phrase describes white viewers' bias toward stories about white woman's presumed loss of life, then what does ""Nicky Minaj's cousin's friend's ball-sack syndrome"" say about black viewers' biases and interests?"
"I told you so! Here is my post from yesterday morning. This proves that markets are not that efficient. Why didn't the analysts raise their estimates? They are lazy and so is the market. In fairness, I have been wrong on LL more than I've been right but winning is much better!I just analyzed the expected numbers on Tuesday, and I am estimating that LL will beat earnings estimates. The analysis is pretty simple. All you need to do is go back to their 12/12/19 guidance, which they re-affirmed earlier this month. Their guidance for the full-year 2019 stated flat-to-slightly positive revenue growth (I used 0.5%), and adjusted operating margin of between 2.1 - 2.4% (I used 2.25%).Their adjusted operating margin excludes legal and one-time expenses, which is about $2.6MM average through the first three quarters. Using a revenue figure of $273MM, we get adjusted operating income of $19.2MM. Remove their add backs and you get $16.5MM net income before tax. Figure a tax rate of 15% (should be less than 21% as they lost money for the first 3 quarters), and my net income figure is $14.06MM, or 0.49 cents per share.Analyst estimates are $0.15. Unless there is some other one-time expense (I'm already accounting for normal legal and professional fees), the company is telling us both their revenue figure and their adjusted operating margin. Thoughts?I'm happy to email anyone my spreadsheet."
I think it is time for Dennis Knowles to go. His appointment didn't excite investors the least bit and for good reason. Now after 3-4 years on the job and the stock price still languishing at $11. LL need to poach a top Home Depot executive or someone who is a superstar or a rising star in the home improvement sector. I don't know who that person is but we need new leadership.
First time we've traded $1MM shares since May 5!
LL seems to be stuck in the mud. The only news is a few hundred shares issued to management. Not any significant share dilution. Can a little more than a thousand shares really trigger an algorithmic sell off?
fewest number of shares traded on Friday than ever before at least for the last year
Going back under $10..............::shaking my head::.
"I'm a manager at an LL in New York. The city is on lock down, but we consider ourselves to be an essential service, so we are completely open and I can tell you, there are lineups out the door. I have heard reports that some locations are actually running out of stock and have temporarily shut down and papered over their showroom windows as they await a restock. This lock-down period has certainly been busy for LL. Also, a new development is that some locations (mine included) have started to sell carpet. It just made sense to introduce this product line since we basically cornered the market for every other type of flooring and this was a natural progression. I have seen a good ramp in carpet sales this week. My location still has only a limited number of carpet SKUs but the best sellers so far are in the plush, wood look category. As has been mentioned, the April sale is a go and with guidance from corporate we actually think it might be the best April on record. All in all, I couldn't ask for anything more."
I thought to sell at $37…but did not think there was a better valued stock to move my money to. What are your targets? End of year? 1 yr? 3yrs?
"Today's search for news finds the following local news story out of Charlotte, NC, that I think calls into question the wisdom of settling groundless lawsuits as class actions.It seems that members of the class settlement are disappointed that the amounts they've been awarded is less than the cost of their floors. Now, even though this was mathematically obvious as soon as the settlement amount was agreed to by the plaintiffs lawyers, it still comes back as a criticism of LL. Sure, we settled for peanuts and bigged up the dollar amount by throwing in generous amounts for vouchers. But our legal team's too-clever-by-half strategery didn't keep our settlement out to the news when we first penned the deal, when plaintiffs disputed the amount going to their lawyers, or now when the meager checks arrive. What is also interesting is the video's flooring defects don't seem to have to do with the flooring itself but with gaps in the shoe molding and some weird caulking on what appears to be either T-molding or an end cap. The floor is still in use so they must not hate it that much. A savvy local store manager would send a team out there to renail and recaulk the trim and thereby win the news cycle. But I'm sure the hip young millennials we hire don't watch local news. (Or own a home either, but the vast majority of flooring buyers do.) https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/customers-disappointed-with-lumber-liquidators-settlement-payments/DYEDGGGBY5AZHIPQEDOIKL33MY/"
"LL outperformed FND and TTSH this quarter and they have a fraction of the PE.They are in a win-win situation. The economy opens up, they have better in home services, economy closes down, they have more DIY renovation purchases. Pro sells grew faster than DIY did this quarter."
"What if the big players aren't even able to get in. Say someone buys or sells 100,000 shares for 2 mill at a time. they would have to buy much smaller lots as even a 10,000 purchase causes the price to jump with so few shares being traded. A set price would also stick out as suddenly the price would stick to say 20.22 and not go lower but might start jumping up. I'm just not that knowledgeable of how the big players put in their buy orders. My guess is with no news they ignore the likes of poor little LL."

This morning we are treated to Richmond's devastating comeback to yesterday's continued beatdown of the stock price.And the pre-market response is to drop another 2%.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ll-flooring-partners-nfcap-help-102800966.html
wow. smallest number of shares traded today in 5 years. Probably means nothing - just an observation. The smallest number of shares in a week over at least 2 years (and I think 5) was the last week of July at 1.16mm shares.
"The LL pattern has been consistent for a few cycles - sell off up to a few days before reporting - then, reasonable appreciation - reporting crushes expectations - yet, unexplained sell off - then, up significantly the month following."
"210,894 shares traded Friday, as compared to an Avg. Volume of 402,968. Of that last Friday volume, 106,400 worth of call contracts for this Friday's 8/20 expiration traded. I know even less about options than I do about fundamentals or technicals. But it seems significant that a light volume day right after an apparent news event (unannounced) and near-term peak in price and volume should have such a high proportion of its volume matched in the options market and that only on those options that expire in a week. Is that call volume due to new positions? Or to closing out existing ones possibly opened earlier in the week? Are those calls being traded between a roughly equal number of buyers and sellers? Or is it relatively few sellers distributing to many buyers, as opposed to a few buyers acquiring from many sellers? A few major counterparties, or possibly only one, is more likely to know something and have a tradable thesis than the collective assortment of individual traders willing to take the other side of the big boys' one week trade.And finally, is the trading of that big player (if there even is one) based on a short or long expectation? Buying calls is an apparently long decision, but can also be a way to coerce some counter party into buying the stock to hold for a week (as they try to reap the premium of the call they sold). And selling calls into the bid, can convince a long-minded counterparty to forgo buying the stock and settle for a quick buck one week trade, leaving more room for the call-seller to acquire shares and longer dated calls."

@James. What are your thoughts?
Zacks apparently did a pump and dump for it's shareholders however it couldn't have worked out that well as it didn't go up and it's not dropping that much. This analysists are nothing but con men.
Anyone compare LL and FND price to book value? I was shocked to see LL's P/B was 1/5 that of FND's.
"So ... What do you bet that Charles and the Nancies are working on a way to load in as much bad news as possible this quarter to offset whatever we got from the lawsuit. That will let the BBSC (big baller shot caller) continue covering/profiting from upfront news (or knowing there will be no news). With enough mental gymnastics, they can justify it as ""setting a stable more comparable earnings flow that won't be misunderstood"" by muppets like us. It would also be a ""more prudent quarterly number in time of uncertainty that can be more reliably comped in future"". Blah - blah - blah. It all still comes down to making investors hold the bag in case of bad news while enjoying none of the upside from good news (like when sales surprisingly increased during a pandemic). And we also haven't forgotten that LL management and the board of directors get more shares for their incentive awards when the stock price is suppressed. What do you think this stock would do if Tom Sullivan took another run at it? It's not so far relative to inflation and the overall market from when he made his last feint. What do you think a reorganization plan would do? Or an announcement about aggressive store growth? (Stores with actual product, that is.) How much market cap would a change at the top be worth, if Charles or the big Nancy left? If FND wants to double their footprint and utilize their big-box warehouses to supply newly bought LL stores, while letting the BBSC close his short at this ridiculous evaluation, this might be the optimal time while the Congressional Floor-play is too preoccupied to look askance at a monopolistic merger. What do you think that'd be worth?"
"As many of you have noticed, LL issued a press release stating that comps fell 1% in Q1. I think the company purposefully sandbagged the revenue estimate and will actually beat when they report. I don't exactly understand Tyson's logic for low-balling, but likely it is a case of under-promise, over-deliver. We have seen this for the last 3 years, but now it should actually work.Given the trends I am seeing, it would not surprise me if revenue was actually up over 10% last quarter. And concerning current revenue, while we had a couple of slower days in April, namely over the Easter weekend, most of my sales were double last year. And we accomplished this with only a skeleton warehouse crew and no functioning showroom. Dennisa, I agree wholeheartedly with your analysis. The drop in LL shares today was entirely due to low oil prices. And that is another market which makes no sense. I was purchasing oil all day, and the more I purchased, the more cash appeared in my account. The negative prices make no sense, but I certainly took advantage. I used some of my proceeds to buy 50k LL shares today. I actually think that considering the dislocations in the market, LL might get a negative price at some time in the future. Which would be great. If LL went to negative $5 or even lower, I would load up. At those prices, you actually get paid to buy shares. I can't explain this phenomenon, but I know a deal when I see one. I am looking to get my average cost below zero and then just ride this up to the $50 range by Christmas. GLTA."
Long and strong!
"If you're a new investor looking at LL for the first time today, you really need to do your homework. Before you buy, go to the Lumber Liquidators Value Committee site to read about the mistakes that have been made by this management, and the plan to get things back on track. Then, if you decide to buy, be sure to join. This company will be driven into bankruptcy in two years or less if management doesn't change. And that can't happen unless the Board changes sides and begins to represent shareholders.http://rebuildll.rizzicapital.com/"

Suspect supply chain issues will devastate this stock at earnings announcements
"K, thanks for posting the investor presentation. I winced reading it. Maybe Mr. Sullivan will buy more shares - and a clue for this management team while he is at it. Expense is unconscionable. SGA has grown 30% faster than sales in DK tenure. Non-existent comp growth. Product comp negative. Margins flat. High margin categories either shrinking (accessories) or threatened by tariffs (manufactured / vinyl plank). Unable to find the right combination of advertising / staffing / occupancy / labor to deliver acceptable profit (operating margin >5%). STRUCTURALLY UNPROFITABLE. This is not that hard of a riddle. PLEASE REDUCE YOUR BLOATED SGA by 10% - you will deliver ~$1.35 in EPS to your shareholders. This alone gets stock back above $20. Dennis, all that stuff you think you need - because that's the way it was at Lowes - trust me, you don't need it. THIS IS A DIFFERENT GAME AND YOU ARE LOSING. Badly."
"Its almost noon and just a little over 36,000 shares traded on a volatile day. I hope $LL can deliver because I don't think you can buy much of this stock without moving the markets on it. I might buy at the money puts and calls for earnings because I'm having a hard time figuring out if supply chains are going to kill their margins or if they mitigated it. I feel like a big uppy day or downy day is coming soon enough."

"So ... I don't like being bullied. And when I type something critical of the LB IR department Richmond, only to see it taken down immediately, possible due to complaints from the same, I try to make sure that they don't get their way. Sure, I'll try to guess what the problem was and reword it. But I don't believe in letting anonymous snitches bury ""my truth"". What so offended whomever was a comment that the upcoming earnings call would likely be announced next week, maybe on a Thursday like last year. And it might take place on the first Monday of November, like last year. All good. The problem was probably that I followed that by posting a likely cut and paste job of last quarter's announcement, with my estimated dates filled in. That, of course, misinformation (!) no matter how clearly one points out the that this is not the official announcement. My point was to prove that after three beers, while watching TV, I could do one fourth of the IR department's entire year's workload. Because they do not answer the phone, or return calls, as we know. I did not expect to also prove that IR is so petty as to resent others' proving how easy their job is. That was a bonus.(Actually, now that I think about it, it could not have been the IR department that complained. You see I posted it last night, and it was taken down before 8:45am. And we all know that LL's IR team doesn't work hard enough to even think about the company and its investors before 9am at the earliest.)"
"Gagnon Securities. Not an index fund.Our approach to investing is different. As a group, we share a core belief that thoughtful and persistent research coupled with disciplined risk-taking will yield outsized returns over a long period of time.We believe that proprietary research yields a competitive advantage. Broadly defined, our interests lie within smaller companies and special situations. Our investment premise is that the universe of lesser-known companies is largely inefficient. Often, the companies that we find attractive are not widely followed by the investment community. Our work, therefore, must be both pioneering and perceptive, grounded in carefully measured assumptions.We spend our time studying companies, and our client portfolios reflect the best opportunities we find, assembled stock by stock. We meet with management teams and travel to companies’ headquarters and facilities to better evaluate businesses, plans for growth and incentives. We augment these visits by conducting further conversations with employees, suppliers, partners and competitors. We attend trade shows, conferences, read industry-specific publications and speak to numerous analysts to build an information mosaic around the companies we follow. Our craft is to understand the microeconomics of a business, and then synthesize information about the competitive, economic, and internal factors to determine which issues represent opportunities or potential dangers. The ability to capitalize on these opportunities and respond quickly requires intensive focus and timing can prove crucial."
"Ok, so they have $100mm in cash - market cap is $500mm; who can quantify how much an acquiring company would save in costs after the acquisition - that I don't know but they certainly could use the $100mm toward the purchase. Unless this company is truly falling apart, demand is huge and not likely to subside anytime soon, so granted, management sucks but does anyone think this would fit for another company or perhaps to go private? If so, please give your 2 cents - especially on the savings that would occur after being sold."
"Most investors either look through fundamentals or analyze historic patterns of price and volume to spot hidden risk and reward. But a few use specific numbers like Fibonacci as a hidden key like the DaVinci code. I even remember a Kurt Vonnegut story where a wino chose stock symbols based on first words of the bible, (INTerstate Helicopter, Everlasting Buggywhip, Excelsior Grain International, Nylon Notions Incorporated, etc). I'm open to anything that could describe what LL investors have been through and maybe suggest where it's headed. Here's what I have so far.If you watch Young Frankenstein backwards, it would begin with Teri Garr bursting into song over Gene Wilder's ""prowess"". That was LL's IPO and buyback blowoff to the $140's, orchestrated by financial masterminds behind the scenes.The next scene has the Monster tiring of Madeline Kahn's insatiable demands. That'd be the Tom Sullivan's sparring with Wall Street and the media, fighting with his brother, and being like the hundredth SAP customer to miss a beat on earnings.Then Monster and Doctor transfer all their brains into the doctor, reducing his ""prowess"". The professional managers took over the back office decisions, while Tom's role as the revenue rainmaker increases as he becomes more erratic, suggesting he might buy The Tile Shop or run against Obama on Varney. Then you have the villagers take to the streets with pitchforks, led by an half-blind one-armed Aryan (Tilson).Then the monster does a song and dance to show he's not evil. And the villagers throw tomatoes.So the doc straps down the monster and ends his life. The henchman substitutes the brain of a moron into the carcass, but instead of the pun ""Abby Normal"", he's called ""Know-less"".And finally, the professor/professional is giving lectures in front of a blackboard, without prowess but secure in his mastery of the topic. Still he is angered by students making fun of his name and country of origin. (Chawls, from England. I presume.)Unfortunately, there's nothing before that in the movie to indicate what the stock will do next. Maybe something in the opening credits? Or an earlier Mel Brooks movie?"
"Today's options review. While the open interest leans toward puts, 24896 calls to 43092 puts, this imbalance is mostly due to the one mega position of 16306 August 16 $14 puts. Still, today's volume ran almost three to one toward the calls, 2051 to 774. The trading in calls was not concentrated on any single strike, suggesting either several buyers/writers or a more limited number of buyers/writers spreading their trades opportunistically around the strike prices. Three quarters of the call volume was in either the August 9 or August 16 expirations. Not sure what it all means, but for buyers of the calls, it's a way to limit their exposures to price spikes if short, and if naked, it's a way to buy LL at a discount if the price increases. For sellers of the calls, it could be an attempt to fund a larger share purchase by scalping an option premium for a sale at a guaranteed gain. But what do I know?"

"Hello. Unfortunately I am still here - a quarter mil in the hole ave cost 25. The way I read this is that on a go forward basis we add a little over 1% to margins (someone else pointed this out). A one time event is not that big of a deal but 1% is about $11m, which is about .40 cents a share to the recurring bottom line. If I am right, then that is substantial (especially when they can't eek out a few percentage points on over $1B in sales. While they certainly may find a way to blow that 40 cents, this does seem like some slightly good news."
"It’s time for management to beat the drum of profitability and maximize shareholder value! How hard would it be for management to correct the inaccurate reporting? With our problems behind us, and numbers consistently getting stronger...how hard would it have been to forecast a solid year ahead? Does anyone doubt that numbers will be better than last year? How hard would it be for management to put out an enthusiastic report of profitability and growth? How many companies can boast a plan for strong growth (opening stores) at relatively low cost, while showing profits? Is all this too much to ask for? I like this management...but let’s shift gears and focus on shareholder value. This might just get us some positive analyst coverage. It is long overdue!"
"As usual LL failed to credit Nancy A. Walsh properly in the announcement because they probably didn’t want to scare us with her stint at Pier One.She went in to an already dying company and has only been there since 2018. (From 2015-2018 she was with Bon-Ton) This might be a better resume from 2015 (Bon-Ton is part of VF Corp):Bon-Ton ropes in Nancy Walsh as Executive VP and CFOWritten by Prachi Singh on November 04 2015 • bon-ton • nancy walshBon-Ton Stores has appointed of Nancy A. Walsh to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the company, effective November 9, 2015.

Happy to see they did share buybacks instead of a dividend. Nice job management!
"And finally, I'll repost another even more sanitized version of my post pointing out that LL's earnings multiple is a reflection of deeply negative sentiment toward the stock. And our management has to own that sentiment, even if Doug Moore chooses not to own the stock on whose board he sits.I'll post it serial style so we can figure out what so alarms the Ya-hole censors."
"Not sure if anybody has noticed, but the LL website landing page (front page) has been redesigned lately and it looks great. Use the internet archive to see what the page looked like last year, 6 months ago and a month ago, and compare it to what it looks like today. It's a complete difference and it's 100% better.Before, the front page was used to advertise specific deals and flooring products. The new page advertises general promotions and flooring categories. It's not just semantics. It's a completely different approach and it makes a lot more sense.I love the idea of the Top Categories being front an center. The photos are larger and the images are properly adjusted to be appealing. And it makes so much more sense to advertise a general sale (President's Day sale) rather than just 49 cent laminates, etc.I won't say it's a breakthrough. A web designer could have made the modification in a few hours. But I think in terms of flow and click appeal, it will have an impact. The digital catalog is also right at the top of the page instead of being buried at the bottom like before. They are even integrating instagram photos. This is basic stuff these days, but it is also stuff that was seriously missing on the LL site before. And now we seem to have a web team which is making changes and trying. There is definitely more to do, but at least there is progress. Think about it this way, the website and marketing approach was stagnant for a decade. Now there is movement. Very late, but still. I didn't want to bury this point, but I would like to note that from my research, calling stores and speaking with a few managers, it seems that the install services in the northeast are booked well into March. The regional sales manager is supposedly hiring extra subcontractors to take on the workload. I don't know how the rest of the regions are doing, but the northeast is strong."
"Big misprint.I reported yesterday that the short position was unchanged. The report i use had the correct dates, but the info was from last period.Happy to report that SHORT INTEREST DROPPED BY 900,000 shares from 1/15 to 1/31. Short position is now 5,100,000. Sorry for the confuddlement."
"SMH, there really is no love for this company. FND, on the other hand, is still flying high"
"I'd put money on the fact it's the same big boy playing in our sandbox. A roughly 60K purchase yesterday morning shot up the price and the same size of buy today with the same result. Oh, I guess as a long I already have money on LL going up. Hahaa"
down 4% on 60k shares - what gives?
They finally fixed the earnings for the 4th qtr of 2020 as $1.06 on the Summary page of yahoo. Shows a beat of 56 cents instead of a miss of 10 cents. Where might the price of the stock have been if they had posted the correct data.
"My local edition of the LL homepage has upped the sale ante to 25% off for the fall sale and has dropped the appeal for new employees, formerly at the bottom just before the IR link.That doesn't seem like a company with its supply chain disrupted. But I'm sure Tyson will still complain enough to hold the stock down on earnings day, if not about supply then something else ..."
Pretty wild dip today. I don't know what's driving this. My local store is very busy. We should see good quarterly results and guidance. NYT talks about a strong economic rebound with vaccinations rolling out at a good pace. Most people with professional jobs will be able to work from home (at least partially) going forward. If anything commercial office space will tank. But homes - that should remain a stronghold for the foreseeable future.
"I don't like being deleted so I'll paraphrase my previous post into ""Woke-lish"" to get past the Yahole censors -- The greatest president in the entire universe, El Jefe himself, is set to give a speech this afternoon. Although the market often dips when he talks, only a hater would say so and sell before the close.(Does that meet with your approval, O merciful regulators of all things safe and engaging?)"

Great play for Tom Sullivan --- he lines himself up with some private capital and makes a serious play for the company. If he succeeds and gets control he can take it private (and eventually cash out when they sell to another party) -- alternatively there are other bidders interested and the price goes up and he makes out on his initial investment --- either way he wins
"Wow. We're almost back to a PE of 8 and a price sales ratio of 0.5. Great job, Richmond!"
We seem to be stuck in a situation where big players can't get in because there isn't the volume available. Very few are willing to sell in the 20's so any larger buy orders cause the price to spike. The same can be said for selling. This is just my humble opinion but the lack of volume is hurting us.
"If it breaks the 18 handle, you're looking at a test toward $13. Thought this had a nice consolidation pattern to the upside, but I was wrong."
"Join our movement to change things at Lumber Liquidators. We are the only game in town. At this point, LL management doesn't even care about shareholders, as can be evidenced by their complete silence as the share price dropped 35% in the last 12 days. Let's take back our company and fix this thing, before it drops to zero."
