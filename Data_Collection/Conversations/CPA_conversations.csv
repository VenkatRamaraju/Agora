The Company said before that they were doing very well on all comps. just a little while ago.... And now they've release quarterly results and things are not so great. What happened within the 2-3 weeks from when they put out those statistics showing great numbers?????
How is this trading at $48. The airline is not flying till atleast May 15. Doesn't make any sense
copa seems to be locked in a trading range between 37 and 52 over past few weeks in spite of a spike in selling 4-27. as shorty has pointed out government of panama can hardly give economic support in the current situation given the governments economic and other problems. at least not on the books.that doesnt mean that copa is not supported. something is keeping the stock price up certainly not the operations they are not expected to have significant passenger revenue for an extended period of time. it seems to me that the stock price is being supported not buy current profits but future expectations. i have no doubt that sometime in reasonable future copa will soar again. if i get a chance to buy more stock i intend to and if copa is able to return to flying in the U.S. i hope to hop aboard.
Difficult to believe that the stock price can maintain at current level when the company has suspended most if its flights. Practically all airlines got or are seeking government aids. Which government will aid Copa?
"Doubled by calls! Unbelievable Opportunity offered by computer/algo trading!No coronavirus exposure!This should be trading at 120 just based on record earnings, earnings beat after beat! red hot routes, stellar balance sheet. unbelievable valuation."
Price of cpa is what it was TEN years ago and airlines are beginning to open back up. I think there's good growth potential here.
Here we go again - trading well above Book Value when all it's flights are grounded... Does not make much sense. Here comes the sell-off...
GOL is up 10% today and it loses money. CPA should be up at least 10%.
copa resuming flights from central fl to panama city both tampa and orlando
hard to see how copa share price remains this high over the next couple of years with projected annual earnings less than 2.00 on a smaller airline than last year.
"Stock has been in decline, yet passenger traffic is accellerating. A some point investors are going to realize how powerful a growth story we have with CPA. It seems to power through all kinds of issues such as turmoil in South America, rising oil prices etc."
Q2 report just in. Negative (-9.08) EPS. They need to start flying soon...

"flew copa last week, was concerned about flying an airline I never heard of. my experience was great with the people of copa as well as the equipment. in a short lay over at panama I realized copa is by far the dominant player in the area. there must have been at least 5 times as many copa 737s in and out of panama as all the outher airlines serving panama combined. the area may be an emerging economy but copa is no beginner. current price of shares are beat down but not because copa is not well managed/dominant player in the area"
analysts est dont give much reason to be positive on copa . still i am slightly bullish due to history of company to overcome.
"sold 5,000 tickets to pay 450,000 fine that looks like 90 per violation of tickets sold even less when compared to 15,000 passengers transported looks like a reasonable risk. should have been avoided but oh well"
"COPA has basically monopoly, they fly only one type of aircrafts (737's -> benefits are self evident), more and more corporate regional HQ's are moving to Panama (and they fly business), COPA can reach with they 737's Santiago de Chile (south) all the way to Toronto (north), new airport will open soon (supply to meet demand), ticket prices are insanely high and plane are full (due to monopoly and high demand), COPA owns the airport (and politicians) so can and will keep the competition out."
United should buy them out to expand into Latin/South America.
I like this company so much I wrote a song about it:Una copa masTe brindo al despedirnosUna copa masQue nos hara olvidarUna copa masTal vez un poco amargaPor nuestro gran carinoQue nunca volveraUna copa masEs la ley de la vidaEl nacer y morirNuestro amor fue tan grandeY dejo de existirUna copa masTal vez un poco amargaPor nuestro gran carinoQue nunca volveraUna copa mas
