Looks like TMO will break $600 soon and it is marching towards to my target $777. Great Company and the best in the life science sector. Covid pushed this baby from $250 to $550 within past 18 month!
love this stock.long term holding.
Have you guys ever heard of http://alert-sounds.com/? The picks on there are way better than TMO
Thermo Fisher Scientific reached an all time high at 625.00
"Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) announces that it has authorized the repurchase of $3B of shares.The authorization has no expiration date.The program replaces the company's existing repurchase authorization, of which $500M was remaining."
.17% div. Hell they should buy back a lot of shares .
Adjusted EPS. No wonder. Very nice! And this is not only covid related. Profits for TMO are here to stay and will only increase since the biotech industry is getting hotter which is fully deserved. Lots of positive catalyst for the years to come.
Buy the dips!$ 670 stock
And once again I sold too soon. What is with these stocks?Can't a short manipulate the price or something? LOL...
TMO - $600 is history now.$777 seems a lot closer :-)
700 soon.
"Thermo Fisher is raising its 2021 revenue and earnings guidance. The company is raising its revenue guidance by $1.2 billion to $37.1 billion; this would result in 15% revenue growth over 2020. The company is raising its adjusted EPS guidance by $1.30 to $23.37, which would represent 20% growth year over year."
why this stock doesn't go anywhere. can't go beyond 585
Why the TMO bloodbath this morning?
"I bought TMO 36 years ago (back then it was Thermo Electron) for $4.58 a share. Thru the 1990's, the stock had three 3 for 2 stock splits. I never had a thought about selling any of my TMO holdings. My original reason was simple: demographics (Americans were aging which requires more medical attention). Due to tax consequences, This stock will be part of my estate when I pass. My advise: Choose wisely and stay long. :))"
Breaking Thermo Scientific news ~ saliva-based CV-19 test gets FDA emergency use authorization. Not too shabby.
I love the way this stock trades. Steady higher lows and higher highs. Sleep well.
Guidance above estimates. FY22 sales and EPS.Follow a professional to know what’s going on :)
any chances of splitting?
