next leg down under 2 is preparing
Seems like a good entry point at 10.30.....
Nice move today....keep it going.
"well it looks like there are looking at expanding there rentable space, that is a good thing.per:http://archive.fast-edgar.com/20210805/AWZZQG2COC22PZ9P22262ZZ26U56Z22IZE32 Filed on: August 5, 2021"
"Ok, annual meeting over, Sonic didnt succeed. What now?"
Was 16.60 and now at $8 the data is much better than anticipated. Regeneron has $10 billion a year Eyelea franchise and will make a bid to protect it. market cap is only $400 million facing a many multibillion market. This is a pure proprietary play and will get a bid with a premium to the old high of $16.75 a share it looks like
Pivotal trial starts 2021 with multiple other trials ongoing..Clinical hold lifted..Company has lots of cash to move this forward with its recent cash raise..

"Please see what Zacks said on June 25 when ADVM was $3.82. ""Adverum Biotechnologies (ADVM) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices."" OMG, dropped to $2.26 today (-69%) in just 0ne month"
One-month high 
It’s doing the limbo now
im getting in with my reddit friends. just waiting for timing
Started a position today and placing these shares on ice for 18 months. GLTA
I don't think there is an inflammation issue at the lower dose but I think those extreme salaries are insulting to me as a shareholder. Sonic would have sold out of their position if they thought there was a an issue that couldn't be fixed. I also think the stock pops if Sonic gets there way. Im voting Sonic.
"What a manipulation. Read the news:One of the most extreme valuations belongs to Adverum Biotechnologies Inc. (NASDAQ:ADVM) of Redwood City, California, which is working on several forms of gene therapy for ocular and rare diseases. It sells for more than 3,000 times revenue.According to its website, Adverum has one drug in Phase 1 clinical trials and two drugs in preclinical trials (animal testing).For the moment, annual revenue is about $320,000 while the stock's market value is about $1 billion."
Ugggg.....New data release Saturday looks fantastic. No inflammation issues....Looks like longs got clocked on Thursday and Friday and now shorts are going to get fried on Monday and Tuesday...Still don't see PPS rebounding to above 10 rather best case scenario is 8-9. If it does get above 10 it would be due to short squeeze...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always...
"$advm has $400M, but the stock is trading at $340M. Can someone takeover the company for 20% profit?"
i definitely understand why longs previously invested are angry. but i cant see any real reason to change opinions about this stock. seems like a great entry point and long term investment
Again a couple of days closer to restart phase2
Sit tight and let it ride and don;t let gyrations or drops scare you!Long term data on wet AMD was fantastic and this alone will make it worthwhile stock to buy. Diabetic Macular edema is not dead. Considering that it took a person nearly 30 weeks to report the issue is high suspicious. People usually report it as soon as it starts to get worse!Sooner later the voting machine will weigh in and PPS will properly reflect the value of the company!Odds are about to turn against the house in coming weeks and months!GLTA in stock casino!
Game over... Kind of. Reduction in trial breadth to eliminate high dosage part so low to low dosage only....Things are looking pretty bad even with PPS down so much...I see only dead drugs in my dream. May be time to load with all the despair. Nah this will drag on for long time until good news comes out. Just fair news will not do anything at this point and selling will continue in 3Q...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always...
"AMD effects 100 million people worldwide. Macular degeneration is the leading cause of vision loss among older Americans, and due to the aging of the U.S. population and the number of people affected by AMD is expected to increase significantly in the years ahead. I believe Editas (EDIT), a partner with Adverum, is saving for themselves the AMD market once they can prove the concept with the first 5 joint CRISPR ocular trials with Allergan."
"Regeneron is proposed buyer, Novartis may initiate bidding war"
This stock in worth 30$ long term hold
"Folks... this is a straight ""SET and FORGET"" play. Easy $6, but it's not gonna be tmwr!!!"
regeneron talked bout gene therapy and ADVM in CC. making terrific progress here and investment
The script is obvious - at some point in next few months the study will reveal that advm treatment did not cause blindness (the fact that only 1 out of thousand did speaks volumes...) and the stock will skyrocket back over 10 where it was prior to the issue...
100 million public offering at how much a share I see this go both ways opion is it a good or bad thing.
Any news Mr. Market?
Lets goooo!! It's too easy to see how much potential this stock has - To the moon $ADVM :). Good luck trading everyone
"very interested in todays ceo keynote in Boston, should be a great week for advm investors."
"Company has no sales channel, operates under NOL every year, can only raise capital by diluting shares/raising debt, has 3 years of cash left with no product, and is about to dilute its shareholders by over $6/share and people are buying it? So bizarre."
crashing today..... going to Bankruptcy with this speed lol
"Cash on hand is very good, trading below cash value which is another opportunity to fly. One good news will make $advm to fly beyond 10. Just hold on to it."
CONFIRMED: The blind patient was faking it to buy the dip. absolute genius!
"AKBA was at the same price as ADVM last week, now is $4.14. Hope ADVM will see $4+ soon."
What did Gene Editing do- took away the sails of several Gene Therapy Drug Companies with Hudred M to over Billion dollar pipelines- Why? Ask this before you sell your stock at a lower price than what you bought for- taking profits is fine with me: 2021 so far been quite bad year for trad gene tx..-from 52 week high (VYGR ADVM both -EV)$VYGR -72%$ADVM -85%$QURE -43%$BLUE -54%$avro -57%$PASG -56%$GBIO -53%$SRPT -59%
"Any thoughts on Sonic? Sonic focuses on a long-term value investing strategy based on buying companies at a discount to their intrinsic value. While Sonic sometimes engages with management teams to effect positive change, we rarely push for board changes. In the case of Adverum, however, we feel board changes are absolutely necessary to unlock the value we believe is trapped at the Company. Are they interested in getting ADVM sold ? Why don't they just buy ADVM ?"
Editas (EDIT) is using Adverums AAV's in their own CRISPR ocular trials with a 3 month readout coming soon. I own both.
"If they won’t use that DME anymore, means they take care of patients health. They should be up, not down."
reasonable price: about $9
In essence the market for the gene therapy drug is 500% bigger than anticipated. It improves vision and gives us just one injection for life instead of 16 a year.
No exp staff would join if there’s anything’ll lto loose. Must be matter of time
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adverum-biotechnologies-advm-moves-buy-160004907.html
looking at this stock. Is there any news expected the next few weeks. The option premium is crazy
"On a CE zoom meeting tonight with a local Retinal group, discussing AMD etc.Will ask about ADVM/outlook ......and competitors like Port delivery systems from NVS & Roche.Port tech seems moot if gene therapy works.Will report back & probably buy more if get good feedback from those MDs in the trenches."
Per largest shareholder - The situation at Adverum is clearly critical. Only immediate intervention by stockholders to improve the quality and independence of directors can counteract the undue dominance of the Chair who has now overseen three instances of wholesale stock price destruction that continually punish Adverum stockholders
"Don't sell now, wait for a good green day to sell. Close your trading account and enjoy your day."
"If there is buyout potential, then one of the lead candidates must be Regeneron. They already treat age related macular degeneration and this company would be a good fit. Any thoughts?"
The gene therapy giant Regeneron (REGN) with market cap of $55B owns 10% of ADVM . Smart people will understand what I mean!
"The beauty is not much people know about this stock. Look how ""DEAD"" this message board is . Therefore, here is the OPPORTUNITY "
Way to go the second offering and diluting stock so far this year. Just like the first offering was not enough and now another $200 millions. I guess the name of the game is let’s see how we can screw the shares holders and giving ourselves higher salaries and bounces.
Opening a Phase 2 for DME. This indication seems a no- BrainerWhy is the stock suffering?
$advm is able to hold nicely today. Hopefully it is going to fly in a day or two.
"So much great potential here. With some good news coming, should see this jump quickly."
"at almost one year, 100% of patients were injection-free. This means the ADVM drug saved them 12-14 Painful eye injections directly into the eyes. Also it will save the health care system an average of 240 injections is each patient life assuming each patient received 10-15 more years of injections."
"State street Corp just bought 9,5 mil shares, Vanguard has increased amount by 250,00Blackrock by 750,000"
"The potential of the company is there, in the financial statements and the news. Just sit and wait!"
"I understand why people wish to day trade, but day trading $ADVM is likely to result in minimal gains. I'm betting that once their positive results are released to the public, this is going to be primetime to HOLD. Even if $ADVM increases by 100% (where it was last week = $8), we still have about +300% to go until reattaining the 2021 high = $26. The most recent drop was due to investor fright after something that is totally normal in well run trials. This is too easy, see y'all in a few months. Good luck everyone, and trade on :)."
ADVM - LONGTERM OUTPERFORMER - PT 390 USDI am recommending ADVM as longterm outperformer.My last recommendation above 20 USD was a sell - after a buy rating 4 years ago.Now I am recommending ADVM as Longterm sector outperformer with a PT at 390 USDThis estimate is based on the product portolio and its longterm prospects.Do your own due dilligence.M.
news coming?
$advm is going back to $9 by next week. Lets not sell until $9.
"80,000 at 4.16 a shr avg..........why sell @ 9........ I have till end of yr"
"i am totally convinced that the stock is down far too much, because Sonic wants to put pressure on stockowners to vote on their candidates, annual meeting on may 12. Big things will happen, no matter what the outcome, in a positive way. Also, there will come a conclusion on the patient with worsened sight in one of the trials. There is 16 % shorted in this company. So there is a lot of triggers for this rocket to take of."
stunning chart. going back to $16 where it belongs. Regeneron is rumored to pay $23-25 as it is better to join them
"18% of company shares is short and ADVM has the cure for treating wet AMD and Diabetic retinopathy which addresses a market of 9-11 million Americans. At $50,000-$100,000 per patient, the market is profits in the billions for this tiny co. Most shorts will cover at 13-17 unless the acquisition bid by regeneron or Novartis is announced before open of market. Bid would probably be 50 % higher than highest price in last 6 pos which is $24-$27"
Hope ADVM will be sold to other biotech company.
This company will most likely be acquired by Regeneron. It is big threat to 10 billion Eyelea franchise and can be acquired for 1 Billion++ and has $3 a share in its own cash. I predict $19-23 a share with this data
"Adverum Biotechnologies to Present Data at Upcoming Conferences-- OPTIC Phase 1 Data for ADVM-022 in Wet AMD for First Cohort to be Presented at Retina Society Annual Meeting in September 2019“We have shared previously that we have seen a robust preliminary anatomical response, with no serious adverse events, from the first cohort of patients in the OPTIC Phase 1 clinical trial,” said Leone Patterson, chief executive officer of Adverum Biotechnologies(ADVM). “We are excited to share the 24-week data from the first cohort of patients with wet AMD treated with a single intravitreal injection of our novel gene therapy ADVM-022.”"
Zacks just increased rating advm
"So frustrating to see that it is just irrationally to have these prices.... i am not an experienced investor, but ADVM:1. felt down from 10 to 4 in APR because of the bad side effects of the DME treatment;2. has 400M cash and 40M debt only; at burn rate of 100M per year - 4years ahead are safe;3. has only 100M shares, i.e. cash per share is 4$ today;4. the 3y low is just under 3$; seems like now, at 2.3$ we are now at a ATL price;5. they still have a working product 022, in progress; they also have a sold licence (see pipeline on their web).What do I miss ladies and gentlemen? I got tired of averaging down..."
This is a big bounce on Phase 1 data. Maybe BP is looking at Adverum to get a piece of the Eylea market.
"Novartis Beuvo Wet AMD Safety concerns:On 23 February 2020, the American Society of Retina Specialists reported side effects of the drug, specifically in 14 cases of retinal vasculitis reported in Beovu patients, 11 of the cases were occlusive retinal vasculitis (that can lead to vision loss). Novartis responded with a statement standing behind the efficacy of Beovu.On 11 June 2020, the FDA approved an updated Beovu label, that included additional safety information specifically including the characterization of adverse events, retinal vasculitis and retinal vascular occlusion, as part of the spectrum of intraocular inflammation observed in HAWK and HARRIER clinical trials and noted in the original prescribing information.""However, Beuvo was approved by FDA, and peak annual revenue is expected to reach $4B.""ADVM is back to $24. (Do your own DD)"
"Could it be that ADVM management purposely released the bad news shortly before the annual meeting to cause a huge amount of shares to change hands in order to win the Proxy fight with Sonic? People who bought shares after the recent crash did not receive the Proxy to vote, and people who dumped the shares would not bother to vote. I read Sonic's presentation and cross-checked the facts with ADVM website. I tend to agree with Sonic that a change of the top management is warranted."
5 tomorrow???
share offering. no details yet
"this is one for your buy & hodl, set n forget portion of your portfolio. just a matter of time. #willing2wait"
Merge $ADVM with $AGTC to save stock holders.
"Does anyone ever have a company that you're really bullish on for absolutely no reason? For me Adverum is that, maybe it's because their products would have benefited now deceased family, but who knows. Hope you're all doing well!"
Writers of those calls made A LOT of money
"Sold 20,000 shares today @14.00. Will buy it back around $8.10 soon. Good luck!!!"
"Great news! Buy more!!! Bio ETF just loaded with 3,5 mill more shares"
"At this point, with these 100% results, I do not think they would take under $23-25 a share, as recent high was $16"
"ADVM will be over $9 tomorrow, what a great find."
"why would shorts , short a company that stops the progression of loss of sight by reducing frequency of injections by 100%-needing only 2 injections, not 200"
Cash - about 350 million. Debt - 130 million. Net cash - 220 million. Market cap - 204 million. Stock is trading below net cash value. Meaning one can buy this company whole for 204 million and make a profit of 16 million instantly.
if you like this over 10$ ypu must love it under 4$ nothing is proven that the dude got blind from the study... this can go to 7$ right away
"Again, this stock is a hidden gem. Simply, NO one knows about it ! So much beaten down. Current SP is sitting now at 80% less than its IPO price. Cash on hand is more than its market cap. Great technology and very advanced pipeline. Annual market size is over $10B. All of this major discount is because one patient had a side-effect that is not sure if it is from the drug or from something else. Any little good news and it will triple. WAKE-UP guys !"
There is tremendous interest in this drug by Regeneron. They already are shareholder and it is in best interests for nuyout at about 1.5 x highest sp in last 6 months or 1.5x $16.66+ $29-30. Sounds good as Regeneron needs to protect their 10 Billion a year Eyelea franchise and medicine is moving to gene therapy as cure. ADVM has 100 % results at week 42 already on Clinicalgovtrials website. Rare to get second chance down here.
"Genetherapy of the eye and multiresistant bacteriaIt is neccessary to reduce the numbers of intravitreal injections in future in order to avoid devasting endophthalmitis / panuveitis caused by multresistant bacteria.The treatment of wet age related maculadegeneration is in danger, when we further need every 4 weeks an injection of the eye in order to treat macular edema. In the upcoming epoche am Multidrugresistant bacteria a reduction of injections (IVOMs) is necessary in order to reduce the risk of endoophthalmitis or even of late on set Uveitis caused by bacterial infections of multiresistant strains.Genetherapy of the eye with longlasting effects is able to combat wet AMD and other ocular diseases in the age of increasing AMR-resistance to our antibiotics.Do your own due dilligence.M."

"yes yes this will have ascaryscary crash below $2, theworst is yet to come,not a good sign when one patient loss vision and got worst vision after treatment then the company went and unmask the other 36 patient to see if their are losing thier vision also in other word guess that mean mean cancel treatiment for the rest of the 36 other patient , look like probably a bigbig fail test in all 36 patient could be coming , yes this willl crash below $2"
Why this stock doesn’t keep its gains? :-)
"Due to Mr. Market's marketing on other boards (LOL), I researched ADVM and love what I see here. Lots of potential for this to become the next SAVA. Bought 4.5K shares for starters. Will add more over the next week.."
I want to know how many people day traded this today. Stocks might not be for you if you can’t handle being red for even a few hours.

"Holding a position of 75,261 shares @ $3.51. I am even thinking to double it at this cheap SP. Mr. Buffett said : buy when people are crying and sell when people are laughing "

Will surge 1000% like ORPH and GBS any day!
"If you are thinking about playing the bounce, just check out these other bio stocks which also got FDA rejection: $AKBA, $ITRM, $ARDX, $ADVM"
"The volume exploded in the last 15 min. More than doubled my position to 10,800 shares today by buying small lots all day! Might add more in AH or early next week."
Do you know what? Today I'll buy more. Much more.
Don't understand proposed mechanism for hypotony ? Single patient in high risk group several months past last dose ?
"79 million shares are owned by institutions, but who owns the remaining 20 million shares?"
"researching this stock - like the fact that there were a lot of insider purchases at around $10 earlier this year, before the hold"
I added more after seeing PR thinking that it will fly to 9 or higher. I have 16K with an average price of 3.9. Lets hope $advm flies when dust settles.

Buying high and selling low. Let the professionals handle it and go look at other stocks....Use 3 week - 3 months rule and you will have better luck. Although by then, PPS should have settled and interest would have waned in buying...3-day rule is dangerous since ST fluctuations are for MMs (market Manipulators)...Looks like June will be interesting month if mgmt has good grip on the issues...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always..."
PHIO issued only 2.1m shares with 1/2 of the stock price and stock dropped over 55%
Does Zacks article has any value?
There is no competition now for ADVM-022 drug for wet amd and Diabetic retinopathy. Any compettitors are falling apart on clinical holds. This is why Regeneron is backing ADVM. Massive short squeeze will be starting soon to propel stock to a teenager before it is bought out by either Regeneron or Novartis for $23-$27 a share which is 50% premium to year high of $16.66
1.65 will deep

"My buy price on this is below 2...Sorry, Just don;t see any positive other than hedge fund interest in buying ADVM ad shorting CRSP since ADVM is down over 85% while CRSP is down 15% from peaks. CRSP is not immune from fly in the ointment event as with other pharma...Good LUck to all and do your due diligence always..."
"No product, no revenue, no approved drug, company should be valued at 2-3$"
ADVM … I know you will triple soon 
This is criminally undervalued right now.
"For ppl making the net cash per share argument, look at $GLPG. GLPG has net cash of like $90 or $2.5 billion and the stock is $55. And GLPG has $500 million in revenue. These biotech companies can trade well under cash levels as the companies spend all of the cash trying to get FDA approvals and if the products don’t ever work, the shareholders are left with zero. This is probably why institutions are still selling ADVM and why short interest is so high, despite the stock trading well below cash. Each Q, the cash balance and stock usually falls and stock strength towards its cash value will likely be sold as investors are still trying to exit. If stock falls below $1, it’s worth a shot that a drug might work. It would be nice if Mgmt understood their drug sucks and spent the money on new products with actual potential or just returned the cash the shareholders and dissolved the company so that the money could be invested in other things. May be if they announce they bought some Bitcoin or doge coin, the stock could briefly rally. It’s really infuriating that these Mgmt teams keep dying companies alive seemingly just to collect bloated paychecks, when it’s apparent their drugs won’t get approval."
"On yahoo news ,read a medical article this a.m. study out of UK .Macular degeneration and dementia are closely related. 25 % higher chance of developing dementia if you have ophthalmology issues ( glaucoma not related to dementia ) ADVM would skyrocket if this can help stop dementia from taking hold.Company should look at current patient data and see if it is already happening or add it to the study now ."
"$advm's 52 week high is 26.98, so there is a big room for growth. Short term target is $9 and my long term target is $30. Lets create a squeeze and spread the word. Tomorrow is going to be a big day."
I too owned Edit for a few years from the 20 s until just a week ago. Beam from low 20 sSaw you EDIT for a few years your words pretty much hit the nail on head.I am out of EDIT as of a couple weeks ago got in a few years ago so it ended well. ADVM has product that should be available in a couple few years. I watched this at $ 4 and $ 7 and missed my chance for easy money .But I think if they have 85% long term therapy success with either shot on goal it will be a multi billion annual sales. I think I am still in early enough to reap huge rewards.Would like to see more chatter on board to know it is being followed.
"No matter what, ADVM is absolutely undervalued. Market value ($331m) is lower than cash in hand ($404m). Stock price ($3.16) is lower than book value ($4.26). ADVM-22 is under investigating but this may not be a bad thing. I bought more and hold."
I believe today's reaction is not related to the over all market. Allergan's Wet AMD NDA is rejected by FDA. This is perhaps a reaction that ADVM might also face a tough challenge. Eventually I see this as good news as one competition less. Good Luck all longs.

Market cap is 6X sales which will be about $6 Billion. This means SP will reach $62. You see the huge upside potential now? what a bargain at $3.6 "
" What has happened for the SP to jump from $0.7 to $2.1 was a typical quick short covering by hedge funds. But the real ""Blood bath"" will take place on next week after everyone reads the CRL carefully and know that FDA requires at lease 2 years of new trails, manufacturing efforts, and more money to be spent. New stock offering with 50% discount and dilution are for sure on the way. The SP will be under $1 for sure in a couple of weeks. This company was trading at $0.3 sometime ago. Back to basis.

read Saturday company news release 6 for 6 at average 82 weeks . No injections . This is a group that had many dozens a year and now none at 82 weeks that is showing durability .If this is a cure for millions and they can price in correctly so medicare/medicaid and insurance will pay this is a multi billion dollar therapy. Do not want to hype but really the media should be looking at this . It is gonna be great if they repeat in a pivotal large study .
"With these results of 100% patients requiring no more injections , this is game changing.Treating only 10% of patients will generate billions in revenue and save a few million patients painful injections every 8-10 weeks. This is the most proprietary gene therapy company with biggest revenue potential of many billions with best results to market cap co. ,I have ever seen in 40 years"
"The report was great news, this will head up quickly to beyond 10"
NTLA is a gene-therapy company.ADVM is a gene-therapy company.Regeneron owns stake in both companies.NTLA will explode tomorrow (read today’s news).ADVM will EXPLODE soon.

ADVM - new first line therapy of age related macular degenerationI think that the treatment of wet AMD by ADVM products is able to make a revolution in the field of ophthalmology in the treatment of wet AMD.If patients only need one or two injections for a successful treamtent of neovascularisation than this company wiil be a multibillion USD Company with high presumability generating billions of revenues eacht year.Do your own due dilligence.M.
#genomeediting take the wind out of the sails of some of these gene therapy names?$ADVM was harmed by the eye data2021 so far been quite bad year for trad gene tx..-from 52 week high (VYGR ADVM both -EV)$VYGR -72%$ADVM -85%$QURE -43%$BLUE -54%$avro -57%$PASG -56%$GBIO -53%$SRPT -59%
ADVM - LONGTERM OUTPERFORMER - PT 236 USDI am recommending ADVM as longterm outperformer with a PT at 236 USD per share.This estimate is based on the innovative therapy against wet AMD in future.I think this stock is able to introduce the wet AMD gene therapy as a blockbuster - leading to less frequenc of intravitreal injections in the treated patient population and improvement of visual acuity.Do your own due dilligence.M.
Oh boy...
Latest from T S Amer is that institutions hold 77% and short interest is 19%. GLTA
Does somebody know how is the investigation about VDAM-022 ?
"OMG. Here to go another bio-tech paper company. Going to follow $FBRX, $ADVM, $ARDX. Stay away or short. Don't catch falling knife."
Buckle up. We are 
"Really good data out. Skeptics got the increase in BCVA they wanted to see (nice, of course, though not the point). Drops + higher dose will likely be the way forward. Not gonna happen, but would be nice to see the approval process speeded up to help with this new covidworld order..."
"Knock down shares need to be covered in coming weeks... Probably in two weeks or so,,,Don;t miss the pop at end of May when knock down shares are being covered...."
"Looking at recent exec changes, anyone know why this co. needs a chief marketing officer?"
Only 3% higher than 52 wks low. ADVM has kept in $3.4 - $3.8 level for 2 months. Is there any news about AVDM-22 investigation? Is it time for ADVM to bounce back to $7?
"Loading, loading! Common lads, market cap= $360 mln. Cash more then $400 mln. It’s like you’re buying a house with $300k but in that house you can find a bag with $350k "
management changes today. no good. bad sign ?
This board is super quite for a stock thats gone up 100% in a month. Its daily trend looks consistent and short volume is below 2%. I don't think this will stop rising come Monday
I upgrade this to buy even strong buy at this level. I added 20k shares at 4$.
"sold all remaining of my shares, 15000, at a massive loss. I am convinced this stock is a dead end probably joining the penny club by EE."
something is up premarket . looks like open will be up 6% or so. Hang on this stock is going to run up as soon as the retail guys see it is a gene therapy that has a productwith potential for several billion in sales annually . I can not be the only one who can see the value of this company.
"Once management announces that ADVM-022 has nothing to do with the severe side effect case, this stock will fly to a double-digit. Beovu from Novartis had similar cases, however, the drug was approved by FDA. This is no-brainer opportunity to double investment. Price/Book is just 0.82 "
"$advm will go 3.49 or below before moving forward. Any price below 4 is good, however market condition and recent PR will bring down the price. Buy now and sell after a week for profit."
This is bs
it was at a b now its not where did the money go
like getting 1/6 of entire company through a pinhole to cover shorts. regeneron has increased partnership with 7 new partnered programs with ADVERUM. Updated on website
Picked up another 1800 shares this morning. Will stick to my slow and steady accumulation plan unless I see another mysterious volume explosion like last Friday.
Institutional accumulation pattern on yesterday's buys with million dollar purchase at the bell
"Awesome, an ideal ""set and forget "" just picked a boatload, thank you very much"
"Only 1 patient has side effect and they are not sure if it's due to the drug. Also, they will announce effecacy data soon.. if nothing related to the drug, then this stock will go back up to 7-8 bucks. Just load and hold for news"
this name has been forgotten and left to drift lowerfirst hint of good news and we wake up over $4
"Just one patient and there may be some other reason than the drug itself.Incisions may cause leakage, which temporarily lowers pressure until the wound is completely healedIf there is no obvious insult to the affected eye, retinal detachment may be occurring. Likewise, there’s a chance the eye is inflamed – from internal injuries, infection or other sources."
$6 today ???
"load up good here, soon this will  skyhigh ... buy buy buy"
This is highest quality gene therapy company nearest commercial results. Regeneron is buyer to protect its $10 billion a year Eyelea franchise.They dont want to be like the camera before i- phones took pictures. I added shares today
great results >No patient required another injection after the initial gene therapy injection . At 34 weeks no injection needed by any patient. Amazing 9 letter improvement. Regeneron is stakeholder. Shares will at least double short term and be bought by Regeneron in my opinion at $23-25
Love the opportunity this presents here in the near future for everyone holding. Congrats in advance :)
I couldn’t’ resist to the temptation: just bought 1.000 shares. See you at 25$/share
Wow Target raised to $21 by multiple multiple analysts . warning you I wouldn't go for short
"This is the only stock goes up on public offering news,I am sure it will tank when the naive buyers understand the meaning of public offering,very ripe for a short."
"hehe..this is the most easy moneyA solid 100,000 i bought..is just I need a new house..etc.."
"Inching up slowly and slowly. At lease it is trudging in the right direction, for now. GO ADVM!!!"
Tomorrow is going to be a great day 
Something is up
ADVM - LT Strong Buy - PT 1746 USDI am further recommending ADVM as a Longinvestment and Longterm outperformer.Fundamentalscand Chart patterns are indicating a Longterm price target of 1746 USD per Share.Do your own due dilligence.
No inflammation issues on long term data. I think advm will skyrocket on Monday.
$ADVM why insiders started to sell since last week? Do they know anything about the blind patient`s investigation progress or pre results?
