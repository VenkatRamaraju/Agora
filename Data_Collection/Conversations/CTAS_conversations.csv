Cintas is up 4.92% to 355.06
this stock is Great! Solid uptick all the way through the year.
"Absurd valuation on this stock that has just lost tons of business. Schools closed, stores closed, restaurants, too many places....and a bloated P/E of 26 and forward 31 P/E is not sustainable....next earnings are hoped to be half of year over year....this will see $180 before it ever sees $240"
CTAS is down 4.90% to 258.97
CTAS is up 4.91% to 285.73
Big mistake!!! Don’t sell they want your share
PE of 30x. Very frothy! Looks like more downside than upside in this stock.
CTAS is down 17.00% to 173.57
"100 dma now gone along with the 20, 50 and 200 dma.....next stop, around 170 where there is a shelf of support......probably 2 years before it ever sees a new high again."
CTAS reported great earnings yesterday and the stock tanked.Today it's up nearly 16!!The market makes no sense anymore.
"Company is valued at 43X to 2020 earnings ratio, that’s way overpriced for a uniform business, the 2nd bearish point is, the net margins to total revenue is around 11% only and it has been for many years"
"In my view, this is a 20 PE stock x $6/share = $120 PPS....seems richly valued here."
CTAS will end up paying several hundred million for their errors in reporting quarterlies. A bunch of law firms are piling on and they have CTAS dead to rights and certainly can prove many of their claims. Probably won't effect this qtr earnings but certainly will end up costing a bunch going forward. I'm out of here for now as the p/e multiple is getting ridiculous.

The 50 day moving average rose from 105.81 on 8/15 all the way up to 114.25 today the big recent run-up in price caused a very fast move upward and with the the price of the stock being fairly close to it all the was needed was some computerized selling pressure to break the 50ma.

"This is why the stock market is so perplexing. CTAS beats big, offers positive guidance for the rest of the year yet the stock sells off. Guess it's just another case of buying on the rumor, selling on the news."
"Dead board here This stock is being manipulated. Implied volatility was 56% yesterday vs roughly 24%...something was going down, nothing in the news....Stock dropped approx. $2 yesterday, then another $5 and change after hours on 11K shares, now down $2 and change at the open on over 100K shares on no news....crime going on here...."
Not sure what’s up with AH price
Cintas is up 4.94% to 263.22
What a scam! Below $20 in 2009 to over $200!! If this isn’t a sign that equities are overpriced I don’t know what is!
It is a beat
And the reason for this hit today is what?
"Let me get this right, a hedge-fund guy, Axler, short CTAS; then Insider Monkey publishes a summary (or course touting their great expertise in the column), and the author of the column takes a short position as well. In the navy we used to call this a cluster (something or the other). CTAS finishes GREEN today, folks. This is almost laughable. I have never seen more blatant manipulation. (It's the same old record.)"

"More and more law firms are piling on. There is no doubt that they can substantiate some of their claims. For every law firm suing, they will be demanding tons of documents for discovery. This will cost CTAS a bag full of millions. The question is how much will CTAS be shaken down for and how much that impacts earnings. CTAS can't deny the fact that it's ""sales experts"" that it's fire inspectors were not certified, including the cases where there were deaths from fires in buildings that CTAS serviced."
The world always steps aside for people who know where they’re going. http://dataunion.tistory.com/10244 I don't think of the past. The only thing that matters is the everlasting present.

Is there a split for Cintas in the near future?
Dump dump
"Spruce Point, a NYC short shop did a hit piece on CTAS yesterday and it's being distributed today. Having read the whole report, I see it largely as a stretch. The good news is that of all the other shorts the douche bags and liars, (read Hebe Max Aldler) at Spruce Capital, their reports do virtually no damage to any stocks they try to destroy. Max Adler is essentially a criminal I doubt they let him come to the synagogue. these kind of predators are no better than child molesters as they destroy the value of working peoples investments. they should be held liable."
Cintas is down 7.36% to 231.98
Loss for the day cut in half. The clowns that made the down grade scared the hell out of supposed Wall Street pros. It's like when traders either buy or sell on earnings headline news before the hearing the conference call.
It’s going back up end of day watch!!
CTAS is up 7.68% to 176.84
because it doesn't. your statement is simply incorrect!

"CTAS has already seen many new growth opportunities from the pandemic. Their hygiene/facility services has already been a nice growth driver over the last few years.Approximately 10% of CTAS revenues come from the hygiene business.Sure, CTAS is mainly known for their uniform rentals, but have spent the past decade trying to diversify the business and 2020 has given them a platform to really push some other aspects of the company. I expect good things this quarter and lots of continued growth. Sure, 41 P/E is a little price but in the last 3 months CTAS has trailed the industry only increasing 12% vs the industry’s 13%. CTAS also has big earnings surprises the last few quarters.Nothing bearish here"

CTAS has lost the 20 dma and the 50dma.....today it blew through the 100 dma at 196...next stop may be the 200dma at about 183...there is some support along $190...hopefully it recovers the 100 dma at $196 tomorrow as the volume has been decreasing daily since earnings.....and buyers return.....

CTAS - can we get a santa rally in CTAS after earnings? Looks attractive at this levels.
"Cintas Stock is up 1,278% over the last 10 years, crushing the S&P 500's performance during this time period. It is one of the best Industrial dividend growth stocks according to https://dividendscholar.com/xli-industrials-dividend-stocks/Having raised dividends for 35 consecutive years, investors are rewarding this with a high valuation in terms of forward price to earnings ratio. Huge opportunities lie ahead to capture the 16 million small business market in the United States and expand abroad as well. Uniforms is a boring business but boy this business is making investors a ton of money!!"
"It's not that hard to rIse the dividend when it was practically nothing to begin with. If the minimum wage goes to $15/hr, CTAS will fall at least 40%. There will be a huge loss if hourly workers wearing uniforms. say what you want about diversifying, but this is still primarily a rental uniform company. Time to buy more puts"

"unfortunately this well run company will be cut in half....maybe in 1-2 years it will make a comeback, maybe."
Don't think so George. Very well run company!!
I wonder if anyone here can explain to me why this company is trading at 191 dollars a share when it literally has a negative net worth of over a billion dollars?
CTAS reached an all time high at 240.00
I really don’t understand people who complain about the dividend. With ROIC currently over 15% management is smart to use excess capital to grow the business.
