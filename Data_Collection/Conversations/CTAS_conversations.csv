take over / merger coming?
Any talk of when CTAS will force vax on their employees?
"This is why the stock market is so perplexing. CTAS beats big, offers positive guidance for the rest of the year yet the stock sells off. Guess it's just another case of buying on the rumor, selling on the news."
Blowout numbers coming for quarterly results. Stock may go as high as 275!

Hello? Anyone else besides me holding CTAS? Ghost town here.
"Absurd valuation on this stock that has just lost tons of business. Schools closed, stores closed, restaurants, too many places....and a bloated P/E of 26 and forward 31 P/E is not sustainable....next earnings are hoped to be half of year over year....this will see $180 before it ever sees $240"
big money snatching profits. this is going back up and will soon be pushing 170
Up up and away! Great earnings report!!
"""Due to the uncertainty, including the severity and duration of the pandemic, we are not providing guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 at this time and withdrawing our full fiscal year guidance. Although our visibility to near-term financial results is currently diminished, we remain focused on the safety and well-being of our employee-partners and the care of our customers."""
"Spruce Point, a NYC short shop did a hit piece on CTAS yesterday and it's being distributed today. Having read the whole report, I see it largely as a stretch. The good news is that of all the other shorts the douche bags and liars, (read Hebe Max Aldler) at Spruce Capital, their reports do virtually no damage to any stocks they try to destroy. Max Adler is essentially a criminal I doubt they let him come to the synagogue. these kind of predators are no better than child molesters as they destroy the value of working peoples investments. they should be held liable."
"CTAS has already seen many new growth opportunities from the pandemic. Their hygiene/facility services has already been a nice growth driver over the last few years.Approximately 10% of CTAS revenues come from the hygiene business.Sure, CTAS is mainly known for their uniform rentals, but have spent the past decade trying to diversify the business and 2020 has given them a platform to really push some other aspects of the company. I expect good things this quarter and lots of continued growth. Sure, 41 P/E is a little price but in the last 3 months CTAS has trailed the industry only increasing 12% vs the industry’s 13%. CTAS also has big earnings surprises the last few quarters.Nothing bearish here"
CTAS reported great earnings yesterday and the stock tanked.Today it's up nearly 16!!The market makes no sense anymore.
"Dead board here This stock is being manipulated. Implied volatility was 56% yesterday vs roughly 24%...something was going down, nothing in the news....Stock dropped approx. $2 yesterday, then another $5 and change after hours on 11K shares, now down $2 and change at the open on over 100K shares on no news....crime going on here...."
This ones heading for a split
what makes this stock worth 40x earnings?
"Company is valued at 43X to 2020 earnings ratio, that’s way overpriced for a uniform business, the 2nd bearish point is, the net margins to total revenue is around 11% only and it has been for many years"
Good jobs report=more uniforms
"Cintas Stock is up 1,278% over the last 10 years, crushing the S&P 500's performance during this time period. It is one of the best Industrial dividend growth stocks according to https://dividendscholar.com/xli-industrials-dividend-stocks/Having raised dividends for 35 consecutive years, investors are rewarding this with a high valuation in terms of forward price to earnings ratio. Huge opportunities lie ahead to capture the 16 million small business market in the United States and expand abroad as well. Uniforms is a boring business but boy this business is making investors a ton of money!!"
