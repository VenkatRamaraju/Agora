moved 1% TSLA to FSR
This is the price point that I bought in after the merger with the spaq...oh my!
I want to see a frog leap in the ask
"Got 2000 more shares at $13.87, long position baby!!! 13560 shares total"
Interesting.... a good move up on small volume with a .08 gap?
"BOB the BUILDER.....""Spud's on the job!"", ""Oh, yes, yes, yessity yes!"
"Here’s a post of mine from 3 months ago—- LOL LOL LOL :))) -- Anyone who asks that question, and believes that anyone here -Or for that matter, anywhere, can give you a definitive answer, that in turn would lead you to make or not make an investment... Shouldn't be an investor period... :)))) --You've have to due your own due diligence, and then ANY investment is a ""leap of faith, balanced by risk.."" Welcome to the Markets :)))""Honest Opinion"" : I like this stock. I like it's product, and I like its creator/engineer/founder. He's a car engineer. He's a ""Car Guy."" He was ahead of the curve on EV tech years before the others, and I owned his past car. (I loved it btw --Yes, it did have battery issues, and the company alas did founder... However, much of that car's demise was not coup-able to his innovate designs and ideas...) Fast Forward: The entire industry is now mobilizing to storm the field of EV, and in some ways still catching up to engineering this man had laid out years before. Now, once again he has designed a truly magnificent car, and from my research, he is tackling the ""business side"" of manufacturing and fulfillment with innovative partnerships and execution... --My opinion: The Fisker Ocean will be a very successful addition to an ever growing EV market, and will distinguish itself with a unique product, at a great ""value"" entry point, and business model that will lead to financial success. -So, to answer your question, YES, I buy the stock, and I'm taking that ""leap of faith with risk""; believing that I'll be owning part of a successful company in the future. --Full disclosure: I've filled the position I was looking to have in this company by selling puts as it started to fall from 15 two months ago. I now own 50,000 shares at an average of $13 (+-) a share (less if I amortize the money I collected for the put contracts) And I'm not looking to average down if it goes lower, or sell it in the short term if it should shoot back to 20+ ( I might sell some way out of the money covered calls to push some cash out of the position, but this is going into ""my investment drawer"" until the company goes online, and the cars start rolling off the production line --At that time my gut, and due diligence puts the value of the company at approx 40 (+-) a share... --But I'm no prophet :))) But that's my ""Honest Opinion"" --For what it's worth, and it's not worth squat :)))) Good luck to all, hoping everyone wins!!! :))"
Just out 10 mins ago. Fisker to participate in Canaccord Genuity 41st Annual Growth Conference on Wed. Aug.11th at 2pm
"Fisker end-of-year price targets:2021: $402022: $802023: $1602024: $3202025: $640These are very conservative price targets, as it assumes Fisker will be worth only one-quarter of the market cap of Tesla in 2025 and selling 500,000 units per year and 2k net profit per unit. Fisker is currently approximately three-quarters of one percent market cap of Tesla."
That's my girl. She (FSR) likes wearing green.

I sold at 18.5$ and bought back today- will hold until the cars are released! I might be a bit early but I think long term FSR will do very well
41.2% institutional ownership and 22.92% short interest. This is at the very least is a sound wager on another short squeeze.
T minus 46 minutes
Yo John…guess what’s coming next?!
"lcid expects to do $2.2b revs in 2022 with market cap of $36b, so selling at 16x that rev estimate. Assume fsr sells 50k vehicles in 2023 at avg price of $37,500 equals $1.875b (hopefully they sell a lot more) and assign a 5x to that is a double in the stock price from here. Using lcid's 16x equals $30b market cap, or 6x current price = $84. Makes fsr much more compelling than lcid at this point imo."
I will be buying a good chunk at 12.50.... there will be a intra low or close there next week! Good luck!
Bought about 6K shares around 13.90.
Good product. Vice President speech about clean energy deals internationally. EV and green companies are gonna make me rich
company borrowing nomey now because interest it in low if u guys heard mr Powell last Thursday the interest going higher by end of the year not next year whT he project it earlier this year guys know that when the fed raise the interest the stock going down
Vacuuming up those 13.75 shares like...
Rivian is getting an 80 billion valuation. I bet Fisker will have higher revenue and sell many more vehicles in 2024.
"In usual Bought Deal financing, participants get to buy in at a discount. Dilution is immediate and the SP usually tracks down to the Bought Deal pricing. This is not a Bought Deal. There is no immediate dilution. The price to participate is at a premium not discount to current SP.This should track back to 19.70. Future dilution from any conversions will be well above 19.70 per share."
Interesting action here...total standoff at 14.55
"Brilliant move - best time to raise some cash is when you have no bad news. Its a convertible debt so everyone chill. Stocking up on cash in a low interest rate environment is a good thing to do. With $1.5B in the bank and a $500M burn rate annually, it gives FSR 3-4 years of runaway (until 2025) before they need more issue more convertibles. It accelerates PEAR time to market and allows them to bring out the remaining two models. No car company in history has raised under $2 billion and put out 4 models within a timeframe of 5 years. Relax longs and remember it is a public Unicorn and this debt offering is like the next round and the fair value is $20 - the $10 plus or minus is because it is tradeable. I think this will attract more big funds to come in and the stock will trend towards its fair value. Longs should only worry about them not executing on their business plan. Raising cash without any bad news means they exceeding their milestones (PEAR sales being pulled in) - Henrik and team are under promising and over delivering!"
im a long my average of all my buys is 16.40 i would like to see it at least stay at 14 for a while eventually buy next summer if they are still on schedule with the vehicles we should be seeing 25 and rising until the vehicles are ready for sale
Long and strong.
"CALMDOWN …..copy n pasted - Specifically, Tesla used mostly convertible debt, or bonds that could later be converted into common stock if the stock price appreciates enough. It issued $600 million of convertible bonds in 2013, $2 billion worth in 2014, $850 million worth in 2017, and an additional $1.6 billion worth in 2019.Oct. 2, 2020"
With Rsi still sitting at 41.... 12.34 is coming!
"Saw the new ev mustang suv today in front of the office —great looking car —And the ocean too is a great looking car kinda with a Range Rover shape —but with technology that dwarfs the Ford — the truth here is that to think Tesla has this market is insane — Ford will be a winner and so will fsr’s ocean —-And others that bring style and innovation to this sector—And Fisker’s gonna win as a hip boutique player with a great product and innovative business model —Tesla gets props for being first, but this is certainly not going to be a one horse race … And the upside and growth possibilities is very exciting— I’d rather be investing my money here than any other sector —including blockchain … good luck to the longs "
"FSR deserves this beating and the beating doesnt look like it will stop soon, looks like it will test teh $12.42 support level. My opinion, is we will see this in the $11's shortly and when the market corrects within the next couple/few months FSR will see $9's/$10's once again.So no rush tp buy at all here."
Next week as I see myself will be a good strong green week for FSR!
adding 10% fsr
"Its a now cash-rich public Unicorn - fair value will be $20 the moment they hit their most important milestone - pre-production OCEAN SUVs arriving soon for the LA auto show - launch is about 10 weeks away and they will be on US soil for prep in a month or so. It is slightly undervalued at below $15 right now. But it ain't crashing or going to the moon anytime soon - if it does it wont last for more than a couple of days and it will be back in the middle of its $10 to $20 range. Longs relax and sleep well knowing the team is executing well. Pre-production cars will be another major milestone (provided they hold their shipping date of late next year), any acceleration of PEAR project milestones will be a bonus and announcement of a third vehicle the cherry on top - I am expecting all three before end of this year they will separate FSR for good from the rest of the sputtering SPAC deals. The wait had been long because it is the nature of the beast - taking a new vehicle from concept to productions is long but worth it as the growth built on hitting those milestones will be phenomenal. Hang in there!BTW along with hitting one of those above milestones, I expect them announcing a battery packaging facility - which Foxconn would probably do - and FSR will pay from the $600M raised! All good and needed to sell 50K cars in 2024 and a $100+ stock price."
FISKER. MAJOR RISE COMING BY END OF NEXT WEEK. 15-20% BOOST. WATCH THE MAGIC UNFOLD!
When do all the shorts cover? Has to be 25% of the float or more.
If good news will come early tomorrow... then we will see a big green day tomorrow too... good luck to everyone!
FISKER mkt cap at $4 Bn... RIVIAN valued at $80 Bn.. Getting ready for FSR to soar atleast to $8 Bn
Really hard to imagine longs selling at $13xx so I'm assuming shorts were up to their old tricks all day long.
"Why Fisker raised money..... even being a light asset company, its a money pit to start and the expenditures are massive. The more expenditures you offload to a 3rd party... generally the less profit you will have! I believe the expenditure are going to be heavy in 3rd Q.... that will be offset by the company meeting milestones raising the stock price! They will not be able to afford any misteps going into production! I am hopeful, but I do see more dilution (probably stock) in 2022! Its not always a bad thing... but it will be a opportunity to re grip for sure! This is going to be a long process..."
is this really up 2$ in after hours?
News is about to come out. They will state 300k PEAR cara per year at the disclosed site and SP will pop for a few days
Are you ready for the next leg up?
Who’s handling Fisker’s convertible bond offering? Morgan Stanley?
At this price how do you not add more
added 5% FSR
The convertible debt deal is exceptional for Fisker. With a conversion at 19.70 and 2.5 % interest this is a home run
Project UFO with Magnaanyone else miss the 3rd vehicle is also going to be produced by Magna in 2024. The FSR investor presentation has a lot of good info.
"Happy Monday Fisker faithful. The risk reward profile is now looking real good for longs. Let's see if we can get a sustained bounce from these levels on some positive developments: Foxconn-Wisconsin plant, battery supplier, adding more vehicles, analyst upgrades, etc."
"Don’t give away your shares. Just hold and relax. One year later, you will probably read articles like this- “Here’s how much money you would have today if you invested $1000 in FSR in 2021”."

"Charliehorse you are about 3/10 or 30% calling things on this stock,not very good for a sad sack of hot wind like yourself.PS YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR EITHER 9.98 OR 12.50 FOR THE LAST 4 WEEKS EVERY SINGLE DAY??? FINALLY YOUR SO CALLED DEATH CROSS IS NIL?"
"Morgan Stanley upgraded to $40, sees $80 upside, lol"
"Following on from my comments yesterday, I have put my money where my mouth is and added to my position, since it has dropped another 5%. Is this near the bottom? Who knows, but FSR is now in oversold territory and lower prior to the MS upgrade. More upside than down with the infrastructure and now additional funding secured."
Bonds to be due 2026Long term this is the best form for shareholders as this option limits dilution to minuscule scale and this funds their PEAR PROJECT I’m assuming.Golden. You sell I buy. I’m not a big buyer I don’t have funds to constantly but I do accumulate and buy under 15 and far under.
".09 better than expected. Seems like a win to me, but I've held the stock at $8.96 and $31 and didn't sell either time. Good or bad I'm in through 2023."
"In terms of production capacity, Liu said Hon Hai plans to establish EV plants in the U.S. and Thailand and begin mass production in 2023.The U.S. plant will produce 150,000 electric cars that year with Fisker Automotive, and gradually increase output to 300,000-500,000 units annually, he said.In Thailand, the company plans to produce 150,000-200,000 electric cars per year, first focusing on local markets and then expanding to other countries in Southeast Asia."
"With 14.5 bases, 30% short at the end of July, shorts will start cover after a breakout from a few good news coming before the auto show..."

Morgan Stanley knew how to unload to the public. All’s fair in the stock market game of manipulation.LOL
"OK, someone name another former spac that could even dream of borrowing over $600 million and at only 2 and 1/2% interest."
Someone bought 168K shares at 3:58 pm. Got in just before the bell on a Friday. Hmmmh?
"Fisker is just a dream that can certainly become reality( us $ 1,6 bl fund raized), at present we are all speculators, some long others short....Market goes up Longs will be happy.. reversal Shorts will be happy.there will be a time results will count and prestectives aswell, till then I'm for Longs...."
Morgan Stanley bought the 600M worth of notes / Class A stock!!
CEO interview on CNBC later.
Nice block trades the last 10 minutes... Big blocks...Kept adding today too...
Green convertible notes offering is a great move. It is not a dilution of shares ~ it is an offering to finance operations at a lower interest rate. Are you really that dim?
"Tesla makes their shareholders very rich, in return many can afford to buy a Tesla. This is the type of cycle FSR need to start doing! Make your shareholders happy and the money will follow!"

Are we going to see 13.29 gap fill this morning.
19.70 conversion price.
My order filled at $13.49 - thank you for the additional shares.
Are you buying here? Seems a decent risk play.
Another low volume day. Looks like a few got out above $14. Good move
"""Starting 2023, Foxconn's capacity in the US will produce around 150,000 EVs a year for Fisker, with the production volumes set to rise every year to reach up to 300,000-500,000 units a year."""

Could Apple acquire FSR ? looks good match
It would be simply amazing if Apple announced that they are partnering with Fisker for their Apple car. Fiskers SP would double in my opinion. Does anyone have any insights into when Apple is going to announce?
Made first Fisker buy today. Im bullish longterm. Hard to imadgine that this would not cost more next year
"if we successfully build up the base at 14.5, then we can see flowers all the way to the auto show..."
"Boy, I say Boy....DO NOT buy this DIP Boy,,,,,We ain't here to make money son,,,,,We here to call lows & highs.......That's how you go about it boy.......We gonna be market timers......This old timer been around son..."
Still firmly believe FSR sees $12 before $15.25....this has always been weak but now with potential 20% dilution about to hit shareholders in due time it cant sustain anything over $14.50
Morgan Stanley made plenty of money here lately I see ??
I saw the Munro video that discussed the mach-e uses the same Magna motor as the planned Fisker Ocean. Also batteries. Is that good?
"3.30 Million shares in Afterhours is a lot of shares and a big move up. Looks like shorts covering, they seem scared."
"Over 1.5 million shares stop-loss changed hands, easy money for the sharks... whoever gets smart showing their back is getting burn hard...Keep buying FSR... shorted 5% Sofi."
Bought more at $13.50. In it for the long haul.
$26 is the new $12! Foghorn confirms!
"I went to Laughlin for an overnight getaway. When went on a dinner cruise on the river saw a good local band play at one of casinos. I put $20 in one of the machines I can’t believe what happened next, I had $20 less in my pocket. FSR has been more rewarding."
Here we go!
Congrats to all longs on todays move! This is going to be a process and a long one. Good luck!
I dont know who it is.... but he has the 6 million dollar question... how much cost and profit per car? We will not know until results from production. They are sharing profits in order to keep cost down... hopefully it will help the margins with that formula... that is what we are hoping!
Couldn’t help myself and added twice today. Will it go down? Who knows but there is no way this is going to stay this low. It’s oversold now and will climb. For longs this was a blessing of a discount.Monday we should go back up!!!
I will be holding my shares until November 2025. Then I will retire. Simple as that.
Next real support is 15.50!!!! Then 14.65! We got a gap of 15.07 up!
"What could possibly turn this stock around? Henrik has put his best ideas forward and yet it keeps falling. Is it the styling too similar to the Evoque? The components. Components already used in the ipace, Mach e, etc. the whole project at the mercy of suppliers? What is it?"
FSR strategy emphasize in distinctive design and solid quality engineering with outsource manufacturing could be the winner in EV. EV is not the traditional automobile.
This positive news
State of Wisconsin bought 200k shares of Fisker and have a bill in the works to allow direct sales for evs now.
Richard and followers… how is that Sofi working out for you after hours. Lolol. Have some humble pie!
Is there any possible way this could equal or pass Tesla someday?
Easy $2K profit today.
Morgan Stanley upgrades FSR with a 40 dollar price target while adding focus to the longer term price target they further project @90 dollars.......source:Rev Shark at Real Money Website
Its all about TA now! Good luck!
Shortts are worried As they should be!Stock is down approx 30% from last tuesday and they want more LOOOOOOOLLLL
Hopefully some golden nuggets during the fireside chat in 3 hours
Not worry about it. Loans is better that sell shares. The same like Tesla and NIO at the start as new companies.
Fsr will be OK.... we are going to go through a rough patch here!
"Since 2013, Tesla has financed its expansion and growth using convertible debt, or bonds that could be later converted into common stock if the stock price appreciates enough. As I explained back in September:“It issued $600 million dollars of convertible bonds in 2013, $2 billion dollars’ worth in 2014, $850 million worth in 2017, and an additional $1.6 billion worth in 2019. What is behind Tesla’s obsession with convertible debt? Well, it turns out that Tesla is almost the poster child of convertible bonds issuers. The typical convertible issuer is a non-investment grade, high growth company that isn’t a traditional straight debt issuer. And Tesla falls precisely into the category of a speculative grade technology company. In fact, when Tesla issued its first convertible bond back in 2013 it was not even rated by one of the major credit rating agencies. …By issuing convertible bonds Tesla was able to get away with offering its investors a very low coupon—that is, the annual interest rate paid until the bond reaches maturity. For example, its 7-year convertible bond issued in February 2014 that is maturing on March-1st 2021 offered investors a coupon of 1.25%, while its 5-year convertible offering in 2014 was able to attract investors with a coupon as low as 0.25%!"

If anyone has ever read my past posts they would know I haven't sold a share of FSR yet. I am a long term investor. But a little research showed we have 22.7% short interest in this stock. The Reddit Boys say they only look at stocks with 25% short interest and over (their latest victim stock had 60% short). Can a few of you haters man up and short another 3% the stock? A quick roller coaster ride with a two day high of $80-$100 would be ok with me.
Are we rid of all the weak hands yet? Although the 20% short position is still problematgic ~ at least until it isn't.

This is the most undervalued EV it should be at 20.00.
Sold all Canoo and buying $FSR today. Canoo moonboys are delusional and can't take the criticism. They are thinking they would be getting Apple partnership and spreading false partnership news. If Apple partners with that is Fisker with Foxconn deal.
"You realize that there are zero bad news with REE right? keep signing deals, keep making progress, no delays in plans. This is a huge manipulation in the SP. This is actually a great EV play backed up by many patents. Lots of cash to keep going. Great opportunity imo. $NKLA $HYLN $FSR"

"Foghorn Richard had all you guys running for the fences saying that the bondholder got FSR at maybe a SP of 10 or 12. Wrong, it was for a SP of 15 and it was a great opportunity for Fisker to get the necessary capital to fund PEAR. with all uncertainty removed about funding of PEAR, Fisker is well positioned to move higher."
Hi all. There appears to be an anomaly going on today. FSR is up. Strange indeed.
To all of the know-it-all shorts. I have a notion that the folks who added Fisker to the Russell 3000 have a bit more knowledge of the company's prospects than you do.
This board should not miss the boat!

Morgan Stanley's base case 12 month target is $40. Let that sink in for a minute or two.
The silence lately is deafening. FSR has declined fifty percent over the last 6 months (check the chart) . The market is showing the lack of confidence by leaving. Dead money until the cash runs out. Henriks new house is beautiful though.
I invested into FSR last year knowing that this company won’t have a car out for a least a yr or two. It’s a new company and with that said comes with its risk. I accepted the risk and will patiently wait to see the outcome. I don’t get caught up with all the negative noise or day to day stock price. Know the risk. Holding long.. 
I wish I had more money
"Please read my previous message if you don't want lost your money on FISKER. Welcome to LOW $13's. See you at $12 soon, then single digit. Market MUST correct at least 10%. FISKER MUST single digit."

"Fisker issuing notes due in 2026. 600million. This looks like the money needed to move ont othe Pear Project, as Geeta mentioned the cash on hand is enough for the Ocean. Much better than issuing equity. Although this news will tip the scales down for the time being. Long term I don't see this as an issue since it is clearly for a longer time horizon in production, which is why I'm assuming this is their strategy to develop the PEAR."

"$600,000,000 Green Convertible Notes Offering --- UNDERSTANDING IT ---Please help me understand as my knowledge related to these notes is limited. I was under the impression that this would be essentially $600M in loans that Fisker would have to pay interest on every 6 months as well as the loan amount back at the end of the 5 years. Fisker has the RIGHT to pay the $600M loans off EARLY (before 5 years), or at the end of the five years, and they can pay off the loans in cash OR stock, it is 100% FISKER’s CHOICE. So, if Fisker sells enough cars to have the $600M in cash on hand, or if they floated another note, they could pay off the $600M with NO additional shares and NO dilution. If they are wise with their money I don’t see a problem paying it off early with their profits.As for the additional $90M in options (my understanding is, help me if I am wrong), these are an incentives for funding their loan and would be issued on a 15% of investment basis. As an example if someone gave Fisker $1M in loans they would get $150K in additional option value that they could ALSO PURCHASE. They have to decide to purchase the additional $150K in options within 13 days of funding the $1M loan. I would imagine the options would have a price to purchase them now and a future strike price that is in line with Morgan Stanley’s assessment of the value of Fisker (but I am not sure here). In my mind the options could cost something like $20 each (a $1M investor would be allowed to buy 7,500 options) and they would have a strike price in Sept 2026 of $50 (these are all hypothetical numbers). The entire round of funding would raise $690M for Fisker. The announcement also has indicated that Fisker will use a small part of the $90M to purchase capped calls to protect against dilution of the $90M in options. If the price of the options were $20 that would mean approximately 4.5M more shares which is a fairly small quantity when there are currently 295.41M implied shares outstanding.As I indicated I am not sure I got this all correct. Is there someone who is more knowledgeable that can correct where I am wrong and confirm where I am right? Please put in simple terms that all can understand. Many thanks!"
"Ask yourself how many start-ups can borrow $625M at 2.5%. There is STRONG institutional belief in Fisker or this debt deal doesn't get done. Fisker has every possible incentive to pay off the debt by the maturity date, in which case there's NO dilution."

"I sold all of my other stocks! 100% with fisker now! Listened to some podcasts about fisker and checked out his car, the connections alone are super good!"
"went ahead and pulled the trigger on a starter position this morning.5 day chart is looking like it could finish out with a smile today, so I think this is at least a temporary bottom and its a good initial position place IMO.I will add more if it drops into the 12s, but I think its gonna take a market melt to get there. FSR has secured a strong position with the notes and the hit from the news seems now to have been priced into the stock."
"Massive inflows into the market? Wait, the financial news has promote the end of the world is coming for the stock market and the biggest losses in history (Harry S Dent). So, the financial press interviewing hedge fund guys about what's coming, these guys have an agenda and want to depress stock prices and control the up/down movement, so they might be disingenuous in their statements?Nah...https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-stock-funds-attract-biggest-100046539.html"
"auto expo is coming , where we will hear lots of new things from fsr. it's very easy money. hold it and enjoy it "
It’s all about that base! John Najarian said this and other EV’s such as LCID will be moving up shortly…. On CNBC this morning.
"Good post from the Reddit boardPosted byu/funnyg9869 hours agoWholesomeA few takes from FSR SEC filing today about the $625M note offeringFSR SEC filing about the $625M note offering out. A few takesNote holders can't convert before 2026 unless (a) the share price is above $25.6 for 20/30 days or (b) change of control. This means the convertible note dilution won't happen unless FSR trades above $25.6 for 20 days in any 30 days. Currently, FSR trades at $14.Capped call will be in money for $FSR once share price is higher than $19.7 before 2026. This means (a) if FSR price > $19.7 in 2026, it equivalently pushes the conversion price higher and up to $30 (minus the cost of the option call). (b) if FSR price < $19.7 in 2026, the capped call is worthless.If FSR price < $15.15 in 2026, the conversion price would be capped at $15.15 per share, which is still higher than current PPS of $14.Hope it helps."
FYI... Gap from 15.07-17.25! The question is.... when will it fill? Will it run 1st? I think it will fill sooner than later! These are very difficult decisions... that always seem easy after the fact.... Good luck
"If you are a long-term investor of FSR, anything under $100 is a bargain."
"This makes it obvious that the Ocean will not fund the Pear! They crunched numbers and realized money might be easier to obtain than in the future.... raising rates and all! I hope you all scored a goal on the 5 on 3 power play.... cause this is going way lower now! You can thank Mr, Anonomous, and all the other guys that do not know what stage FSR is in right now.... on the road to show a profit! Good luck to all!"
FSR will do well in the future.
"During the earnings conference call Henrik said they were planning on 5K cars per month (60k / year) but that they were being given Magma’s large assembly line that had the capacity to produce 100,000 / year. So what volumes would one anticipate the Ocean generating so we can come up with annual revenue estimates? My thoughts are that Magma believes Fisker will be successful enough to do more than the 5K cars / month. The reason I say that is simple business sense and deductive reasoning. Magma would never give their largest assembly line to a vehicle that they thought would not come close to maximizing its volume and revenue for Magma. Meaning, if Magma thought Fisker would not be able to sell 100K / Ocean cars per year they would have put it on a smaller, less capable, assembly line and put a larger volume vehicle on their largest assembly line. It is possible, but NOT likely, that the Ocean is on Magma’s largest assembly line at Fisker's request. But, I say it is not likely because if Magna didn't believe Fisker would sell the 100,000 cars and use the capacity, they would almost certainly require upfront cash from Fisker for their belief that they would be under-utilizing Magma’s largest assembly line / revenue stream. The fact that during the earnings conference call Henrik said they were getting better deals and pricing from their partners, and that there were not huge cash outlays for capacity reservations I am inclined to believe that Magma thought the Ocean would sell 100,000 units per year. I believe putting the Fisker Ocean on their largest assembly line was Magma’s recommendation and risk due to their belief in the vehicle. With the Ocean priced between $37,500 and $55,000, I will use a $45,000 average sales price.($45,000/car) x (100,000 sold) = $4.5B in revenue for Fisker by the end of 2023, with a second car, the PEAR, beginning sales at the end of 2023. Based on Foxconn’s interest in the PEAR and building a factory for it, I would also assume they believe it is going to be successful (However at this time I put less credence in Foxconn’s assessment, than Magma’s, due to their being new to the industry.). I believe Fisker’s asset light business model, with miniscule headcount, will yield much higher multiples for their valuation than many are even dreaming. With ~260 employees today, Fisker has already designed the Ocean (on the earnings conference call Henrik said Design and specs are now “locked”), done significant work on the next car (PEAR), and during the conference call he said they had already begun design work on the next two vehicles. They will need to staff marketing and other positions over the next year but they could end up with under 2,000 employees and $4.5 Billion in sales, which would be ~$2.25M in Sales per Employee. For reference, Tesla’s Revenue / Employee is $0.6M, and among tech companies, Netflix is currently #1 in Revenue/Employee with $2.34M, and Apple is second, with $1.9M / employee (Both are also “asset light”.). (---Google ""highest tech company revenue /employee 2019"")I do see incredible things for Fisker as a company so long as they execute on their timeline. In full transparency, as much as I am impressed with what the leadership team has accomplished, and I hope that they accomplish in the future, there are some executive actions / decisions that cause pause / concern. Hopefully I am inappropriately assessing their situations."
accumulation technique is a good one for Fsr and swing shorting is a great method for sofi at this time. shorted 5% sofi
I would not be here if I did not like this stock!
Keep buying FSR when it is under $17
12 is close…wow.
"People, stop complaining of price decreases if you believe long term. You want to accumulate before they execute/rest of the world finding out about their strategy. Imo we haven't seen bottom based on what's going on in the world. Still...average in. Buy when it's red, not green!"
"""Foxconn and Magna, they will get all the equipment they need,"" They have the capital. They have the reputation. We are not here to set up our own factory in the desert,"" said Fisker. """
I hope we aren't using LG for batteries. Henrik said its a top 5 supplier. But LG and GE having tons of issues with the batteries right now...would be slightly worrisome if that's the case.
Amazon-backed Rivian seeks $70-80 bln valuation in IPOMore power to them - Lucid and Rivian will help us get into double digit billions (valuation) soon - as soon as pre-production cars are shown to the press. If I were Henrik I would let them ride it at the LA auto show.
MS probably shorted the stock at $19 .
I believe in Fisker design. I believe in the FSR business model. 3 months to LA auto show which is likely to create a buzz. Next year I expect to see the Ocean on the road and the Pear at the LA auto show. This is a long term winner. Tesla is stale. It’s time for some new EVs.
Always expect the unexpected. Wouldn't surprise me after a 7% haircut to see a 10-15% pop tomorrow on Foxconn-Wisconsin factory news. Let's gooooooooo!!!!!!!
Love this stock. Huge future. Only have a couple of shares. I will continue to build future wealth through FSR. Great news for FSR traders
What are the charts saying for a good entry point? Any expert advice?
Long and strong 
"If you aren't long on $FSR, then you are missing out. Best to not look at the stock price if you get white-knuckled. Check back in 3yrs for the true payout. But do as you like."
$19 to $13 in a blink of an eye. Definitely accumulation time again. A lot of people waiting for the low $12s...but low $13s was unexpected.
"I've lost faith in this company, they said no share dilution in 2021, and they did the opposite."
"uh oh, Richard and his clonies are in trouble. I'm seeing a momentum switch into stocks like Fisker that should go on for awhile."
Just initiated a position in FSR.This company could turn out as the 2nd Tesla!
"They are loaded with cash and investing it. The model will work...patience. Frankly, I can't wait to get my hands on an Ocean...or a Pear."
"I originally pre-ordered the Ocean suv for my wife. Now, my dad is also interested in getting one after getting disappointed in his test-drive of Tesla's Model Y with the sloping hatchback which reduces interior room for putting big items in the back when you need all the seats for passengers.I am also waiting for the specs of the performance model of the Ocean. If its performance can compare similarly or favorably to the specs of the Performance Model Y, I may also switch to the Performance Ocean model.Also the Tesla Model Y has a bland interior and there is no hooks/nets for securing items in the back truck. We test-drove the regular Model Y, we purposely put our backpacks, hats in the middle, at the end of our drive, they were all over in the truck area."

"For those that dont know, all 625M raised. US Bank and JP Morgan bought them, funded in 3 business days at 2.5% rate."
"Price predictions are just that....predictions. GE was near $5 and everyone, and I mean absolutely everyone, said don't go near it.It more than doubled in price shortly thereafter when the CEO said they'd be cash flow positive.Look at the full picture, strong execution, market strength and don't get weighed down by short term thinking."
"Interesting block trades went off a bit ago... Looks like over 690k shares in total...Hmm, glad 2 of my orders filled..."
I am readying myself for the 12.65 bounce! If you look at the chart... this level is standing on one leg... not very study!
"Fisker today announced it is joining forces with renowned racing driver, Abbie Eaton. One of 18 drivers competing in the 2021 W Series Championship, Abbie will work closely with Fisker’s engineering and product development team, focusing on chassis and vehicle dynamics on the Fisker Ocean SUV program and other vehicles to follow"
"Have they fixed the conversion price at $19.70? If so, nobody should be deflating or manipulating the price anymore! Why still falling like a rock? Unless they plan to use today's closing price? Anyone knows?"
you can tell no one read the entire release. They can buy the calls. very smart. it's a playbook I have seen before. I wonder where.
$40 by December 2021
"With FSR's 20% short interest, it may get real interesting real quickly In Fisker-land. Big blocks on the bid pretty consistently throughout today's post-market session. We shall see what's under the hood tomorrow."

"Always expect the unexpected. Many now think Fisker drops to 12,10,8 and it seems put buying has increased. The contrarian in me thinks we pop this week. Maybe Foxconn factory news, analyst upgrades (GS?), battery supplier announcement, new vehicles..... There are quite a few catalysts. Staying long and strong!!!!"
