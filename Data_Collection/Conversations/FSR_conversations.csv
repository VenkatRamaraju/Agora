Made first Fisker buy today. Im bullish longterm. Hard to imadgine that this would not cost more next year
FISKER mkt cap at $4 Bn... RIVIAN valued at $80 Bn.. Getting ready for FSR to soar atleast to $8 Bn
I sold at 18.5$ and bought back today- will hold until the cars are released! I might be a bit early but I think long term FSR will do very well
$40 by December 2021
im a long my average of all my buys is 16.40 i would like to see it at least stay at 14 for a while eventually buy next summer if they are still on schedule with the vehicles we should be seeing 25 and rising until the vehicles are ready for sale
"Its a now cash-rich public Unicorn - fair value will be $20 the moment they hit their most important milestone - pre-production OCEAN SUVs arriving soon for the LA auto show - launch is about 10 weeks away and they will be on US soil for prep in a month or so. It is slightly undervalued at below $15 right now. But it ain't crashing or going to the moon anytime soon - if it does it wont last for more than a couple of days and it will be back in the middle of its $10 to $20 range. Longs relax and sleep well knowing the team is executing well. Pre-production cars will be another major milestone (provided they hold their shipping date of late next year), any acceleration of PEAR project milestones will be a bonus and announcement of a third vehicle the cherry on top - I am expecting all three before end of this year they will separate FSR for good from the rest of the sputtering SPAC deals. The wait had been long because it is the nature of the beast - taking a new vehicle from concept to productions is long but worth it as the growth built on hitting those milestones will be phenomenal. Hang in there!BTW along with hitting one of those above milestones, I expect them announcing a battery packaging facility - which Foxconn would probably do - and FSR will pay from the $600M raised! All good and needed to sell 50K cars in 2024 and a $100+ stock price."
If anyone has ever read my past posts they would know I haven't sold a share of FSR yet. I am a long term investor. But a little research showed we have 22.7% short interest in this stock. The Reddit Boys say they only look at stocks with 25% short interest and over (their latest victim stock had 60% short). Can a few of you haters man up and short another 3% the stock? A quick roller coaster ride with a two day high of $80-$100 would be ok with me.
Amazon-backed Rivian seeks $70-80 bln valuation in IPOMore power to them - Lucid and Rivian will help us get into double digit billions (valuation) soon - as soon as pre-production cars are shown to the press. If I were Henrik I would let them ride it at the LA auto show.
It would be simply amazing if Apple announced that they are partnering with Fisker for their Apple car. Fiskers SP would double in my opinion. Does anyone have any insights into when Apple is going to announce?
RIP Charlie Watts.
"I've lost faith in this company, they said no share dilution in 2021, and they did the opposite."
State of Wisconsin bought 200k shares of Fisker and have a bill in the works to allow direct sales for evs now.
Someone bought 168K shares at 3:58 pm. Got in just before the bell on a Friday. Hmmmh?
"I went to Laughlin for an overnight getaway. When went on a dinner cruise on the river saw a good local band play at one of casinos. I put $20 in one of the machines I can’t believe what happened next, I had $20 less in my pocket. FSR has been more rewarding."
Good product. Vice President speech about clean energy deals internationally. EV and green companies are gonna make me rich
"On CNBC, Jon Najarian just said he expects the EV stocks launch as Lucid, Fisker to explode higher FWIW."
moved 1% of TSLA to FSR

This is the most undervalued EV it should be at 20.00.
