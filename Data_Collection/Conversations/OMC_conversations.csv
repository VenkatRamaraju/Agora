"LOL. Ok. Enough is enough. I mean #$%$Bought a big chunk of this into the close.Under-valuation here is ridiculous, almost absurd - and dividend is just too juicy to pass up at this point.I know this isn't a car company run by a con man, but come on guys, how much lower can it go?This is one position I'm willing to oversize, cos I just don't believe even today's investors are st00pid enough to not take advantage of that dividend as it grows bigger and bigger."

"Let me see if I have this right. OMC, at today’s price of $68.00 is paying a very secure 4% dividend. By secure I mean not only did OMC not stop or even reduce their dividend in 2020 but they increased it 7% in 2021 while covid was still a major concern. Dividends have tripled over the last ten years. Plus, historically OMC buys back 2% to 3% of its outstanding shares each year. In 2003 OMC had 380 million shares outstanding. In 2021? Looks like about 212 million and falling. So, between the dividend and the buybacks you’re pretty much guaranteed a 6% return. Meanwhile earnings per share are beating forecasts every quarter, and OMC is priced at a historically low P/E ratio of 10. With all that in mind, I guess I can hold my OMC shares and wait for the institutions to realize that old school advertising agencies aren’t going out of business in the digital age. When that finally happens OMC’s P/E should go back to 15 or 16 and the stock’s price will reach $100.00+."

Can you advise which is better: DISCA or OMC? DISCA has some revenue growth pre pandemic whereas OMC has stayed the same over years with a dividend but higher debt?

"Great stock, steady management, dividend yielding and decent growth without the risk. Recession will impact this industry less than most."
Any news? This stock hasnt had a 1 day 8% gain/loss in a decade
Omnicom is a solid and safe long term investment with a great dividend. Omnicon has transitioned to a digital company better than any of the big conglomerates. They have the best in class advertising houses and a practical and knowledgeable management team that manages funds very well. The dividend is rock solid and the stock is cheap in a world of expensive tech stocks this is a growth company without the risk. I have been invested since 2001 and its a perfect stock for this risk off environment.
"Omnicom Group (OMC) moved this week from #11 to #10 Advertising And Marketing stock, passing Interpublic Group Of Cos Inc (IPG) Mffais Flow$ -457,721.533 (K)"
