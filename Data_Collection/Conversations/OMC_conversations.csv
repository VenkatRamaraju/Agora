OMC is down -6.39% to 73.11
Never fails....company reports blow away numbers and the stock craters. Happens pretty much on every stock these days. We're down 3.2 % and still falling.
anyone getting in prior to tues earning
Can you advise which is better: DISCA or OMC? DISCA has some revenue growth pre pandemic whereas OMC has stayed the same over years with a dividend but higher debt?
"This could be a value stock, with PE @ 12. Ex-Dividend date is 9.20.2021, and lets see what happens this week. Good luck, guys."

"Bought in today at 70.14, this should go up to about 73-74 then should be bearish. I’m gonna hold till it hits my target"
Omnicom is down 7.19% to 52.91
looking at the charts it should test its highs . It might be a breakout . Not sure but adding here just incase .
https://gookenhaim.blogspot.com/2019/06/i-recommend-this-stock-omnicom-group.html has some growth prediction as to the value
OMC is down -4.93% to 66.85
OMC has been showing support at 75.62 and resistance at 79.14. Positive technical buying signal.
"Let me see if I have this right. OMC, at today’s price of $68.00 is paying a very secure 4% dividend. By secure I mean not only did OMC not stop or even reduce their dividend in 2020 but they increased it 7% in 2021 while covid was still a major concern. Dividends have tripled over the last ten years. Plus, historically OMC buys back 2% to 3% of its outstanding shares each year. In 2003 OMC had 380 million shares outstanding. In 2021? Looks like about 212 million and falling. So, between the dividend and the buybacks you’re pretty much guaranteed a 6% return. Meanwhile earnings per share are beating forecasts every quarter, and OMC is priced at a historically low P/E ratio of 10. With all that in mind, I guess I can hold my OMC shares and wait for the institutions to realize that old school advertising agencies aren’t going out of business in the digital age. When that finally happens OMC’s P/E should go back to 15 or 16 and the stock’s price will reach $100.00+."
Omnicom is a solid and safe long term investment with a great dividend. Omnicon has transitioned to a digital company better than any of the big conglomerates. They have the best in class advertising houses and a practical and knowledgeable management team that manages funds very well. The dividend is rock solid and the stock is cheap in a world of expensive tech stocks this is a growth company without the risk. I have been invested since 2001 and its a perfect stock for this risk off environment.
I like
