This company was founded in 1777? Wow!
"Sad that I had to cancel our big European trip. Refunds from the airline took about 3 weeks. Canceling my IHG hotel online was actually easy. Thought everything with the refund would be smooth. I had several hotels thru Hotwire, which is almost impossible to get a cancellation or refund. All 3 cancelled after about 3 weeks, refunded 14 days later. Train tickets also canceled and refunded. But here I am, 45 days later, still having to call IHG on a weekly basis, getting a cruddy phone connection to a 3rd world country. phone reps that have a hard time with English, reading from a script. I have been promised a refund ""in 14 days"" about 3 times. Still haven't seen anything. Today's response was 'when that specific hotel opens, then we will begin to process your refund, so 21 days after they re-open"". What a lovely way to guarantee I never choose an IHG hotel again. So I have chosen to comment here, on my fb and insta pages. IHG, you need to do better as a company."

"'Great article. I am a disabled vet - 100% - heart valves problems caused by Agent Orange exposure. Short of breath and weakness in my legs. Well, at a hotel the handicapped spots were taken by unauthorized vehicles. A lady came out and ordered me not to walk around looking at those cars. She was an employee who had a habit of parking there while unauthorized to do so. She went inside and amplified the situation to her 2 female co-workers. They called the police. I don't know what scenario they concocted or dramatized, but 3 Officers knocked on my door leaning forward with hands on their still holstered weapons. I was told to be out by noon or I would be arrested for trespassing. Not exactly a good experience at a hospitality business. Also, i read the reviews and this happened at other locations. This one was in Troy, Michigan. Candlewood Suites. I still cringe at the sound of their name.'"
