"With all of the US based call centers closing, in November, I wasn't sure what the stock would do. The calls, in addition to bring routed to the Philippines, will be going to Santo Domingo. In July, an additional call center will open in Jamaica. I think I'll book online more now."

"Sad that I had to cancel our big European trip. Refunds from the airline took about 3 weeks. Canceling my IHG hotel online was actually easy. Thought everything with the refund would be smooth. I had several hotels thru Hotwire, which is almost impossible to get a cancellation or refund. All 3 cancelled after about 3 weeks, refunded 14 days later. Train tickets also canceled and refunded. But here I am, 45 days later, still having to call IHG on a weekly basis, getting a cruddy phone connection to a 3rd world country. phone reps that have a hard time with English, reading from a script. I have been promised a refund ""in 14 days"" about 3 times. Still haven't seen anything. Today's response was 'when that specific hotel opens, then we will begin to process your refund, so 21 days after they re-open"". What a lovely way to guarantee I never choose an IHG hotel again. So I have chosen to comment here, on my fb and insta pages. IHG, you need to do better as a company."
