"Wells Fargo upgrades Hartford from Equal weight to Overweight.PT to 50 dollars.Average analyst rating is a Buy and average PT is 63 dollars.We might not be trading on any/all analyst ratings for a period of time but their opinions are still worthwhile, IMO from a fundamental viewpoint.Cheers."

"Few thoughts:One. With our recent past, present and hopefully continuing great earning results the institutions (that for the most part control our Sp) will add and initiate to their positions in HIG. IMO we should be viewed as one of the ""better of the breed"" as long as Swift was both honest and exact in his analysis. We have already had far higher price targets by an assortment of good analysts, that many institutions follow. Downside of course, we are still a part of small and large ETF's and other mutual funds that will detract from Sp progress in a sell off.Two. The headwinds I believe will be a very low interest rate environment for a longer time, an ensuing recession, larger overall market retracement and natural disasters (fire, floods, hurricaines); that appear to be recurring with more detriment and frequency. So far, so good, as HIG has ""navigated"" (no pun intended) these troubles excellent.Three. A minor detail but there is a gap in the chart from our recent move upwards and because it is closer numerical proximity, I expect it to be filled on a down day or period. Four. NAVG might very well be an ace in the hole for future quarterly earning results and in hindsight might be viewed as a very smart purchase--regardless of it's exorbitant price tag.Five. Great results yesterday IMO that hopefully will be followed by further upgrades if the analysts desire to be ahead of the curve.Six. IF, overall things continue positive I still expect a dividend increase in the next quarter to two. Cheers to all longs and please add more ideas."

Good thing CB did not get Hig for $70. We are higher than that price now!
Must have been fat thumb trade at 9:36 AM. Fidelity shows $78.15 was hit while yahoo shows $77.50.Someone hit the panic button to cover their short?
"We broke 60 dollars/share, a small milestone for the Hartford today since the financial crisis. No guarantee of course we hold above this level but it is still a sign of good progress by management from the melt down days, IMO. Next of the agenda, IF quarterly results are good, the general market stays coherent and their catastrophe losses are in alignment, I am hoping for a slight dividend increase. Cheers to all longs!"
Hig got beat down over $4. I bought more near low of day. Hig shows this pattern over and over again.

Great quarterly results with EPS at .78 which is a 20% surprise.The 1 billion dollar share repurchase program is what have desired and needed at these Sp levels.Remodeling of the business structure with NAVG on board is a good idea and necessary for the maximum productivity.Cheers to all longs.

Hig crushed earnings. Beat by .41 cents. Revenue beat by 440 million. Earnings of 5.69 billion up 10.1%. How about a 10% dividend increase!
"A nice home run for this quarter's results:GAAP EPS of 1.36, beats by .54.Revenue of 5.69 billion, beats by 440 million.Increase of the common dividend by 10% or .385 per quarter.Third quarter written premiums were up 15% this quarter compared to the third quarter of 2020.Combined ratio was 5.3 points higher from the previous.Cheers to all longs."

"Quarterly results for the Hartford appear excellent, including a 23% increase in BV to 43.13. NAVG is still a work in progress but appears to be integrating wellWe have purchased 90 million in common share with 910 million still to follow. That is encouraging and will be helpful IMO for future Sp stability and quarterly results.Cheers for positive gains in the coming days."

"Looking fairly well as to the recovery in Sp, IMO.We broke ahead of our short term intermediary high at 43.18 from back in April.We are well above the EMA (34) and the SMA (50).Next challenge is the SMA (200) which hovers at about 52.30. There are also some gaps in Sp in this latest ascent to reach that value. The MM will want those gaps filled.Money flow has been steadily improving in value of CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) and OBV (On Balance Volume) designating institutional support for this price increase.I would expect a partial retrace fairly soon in Sp from our present ascent. Normal trading and a good short term buying opportunity.Cheers to all longs."
"KBW cuts PT to 67 dollars from 70 dollars.These PT reductions appears to be a trend by many analysts in HIG and other companies in the sector.Valuations/earnings are the main reasons but keeping it simple, these companies appear to be taking a break in the rise in Sp from their previous and extended ascent. Period of consolidation. The analysts are calling what is evident and present, IMO.In total, IMO they are still overall bullish on HIG from a longer term time horizon. Perform and outperform ratings with most having higher PT's.Cheers to all longs."
"UBS raises Hartford price target to 65 dollars, from 61 dollars.Reiterates a Buy Rating.Average rating among analysts is a price target of 59 dollars with a Buy Rating."
"What we are live time witnessing today is a money flow driven algorithm short trade. They walked Sp down from 31 to 19 dollars on only about 4 million shares, by both buying and selling shares and controlling the bid/ask and uptick.Facilitated of course, by a extreme downdraft market and lack of big buyers.Basically to a level in Sp not seen since 2012. CMF money flow spiked up as they started to cover, when the algorithm computer sensed no more selling.Were there long term sell-stops in place and easily observed on the journey down? Absolutely, and they were triggered and accumulated.HIG had tremendous volatility and Sp collapse during and after the financial crisis which makes this type of short trade far more successful than some of their peers like ALL, CB and TRV. They too have taken a great hit but no where near the 40% in one day.Actually, quite impressive that computer software can have this type of control but obviously depressing at the same time.Positive note, it is just a moment in time. The company itself is firing on all cylinders and longer term I expect to achieve new highs. Few observations, FWIW for any interested.Cheers to all longs."
