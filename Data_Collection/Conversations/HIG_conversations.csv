Very nice move upwards today on healthy volume. No news I can find but no complaints. Perhaps a hopeful good results rise from the TRV beat.Cheers to all longs!
"Thinking about 2950 on the SPX, should get going well tomorrow to the downside. News will follow the move.HIG is in their first leg down, followed by a small up B wave, then completed by a big C wave down to finish the retrace.Perhaps near the SMA(50)."
"Based on my research, receiving a bid price of $85 is only fair for HIG. I won't be surprise to see the stock to speculate over $90."
"Quarterly results for the Hartford appear excellent, including a 23% increase in BV to 43.13. NAVG is still a work in progress but appears to be integrating wellWe have purchased 90 million in common share with 910 million still to follow. That is encouraging and will be helpful IMO for future Sp stability and quarterly results.Cheers for positive gains in the coming days."
"Time will tell on the new HIG purchase of Y-Risk, as to their longer term profitability potential with comparison to their peers.A far as present Sp valuations, HIG is in similar falling metrics as to many of the heavy hitters in the insurance sector. Compare a one year chart with the following and they also have lost 20 to 30 percent of their market cap: PRU MET ALL AIG LNC.As far as the P/C sub sector IMO, TRV and CB are the gold standards and even though they have faired better than HIG are still down about 15 percent. No one is happy.FWIW, I do believe the market did not look favorably on their NAVG purchase and at these Sp levels a common share buy back program would be considered share holder friendly.Cheers to all longs."
Democrats say if they win in November mid term elections they will Repeal and replace the Trump tax cuts. If you want High Taxes vote for Democrats.
"HIG 52 week high today. Difficult market, though. Insurance is a safe haven."
I’m hoping for a buyout above 80 dollars a shareIt looks like the all time high for HIG was about 100 dollars a share.It’s a solid company with a stable earning history!
with Pifzer vaccine 90% effective Hartford should continue to move higher.. Trump fast tracking vaccine manufacture brilliant. Moving past hurricane season.
"Strange today as this is not a MEME stock and the last spike was before the CB offers....did someone see a person Chubb from walk into HIG office at 12:50PM, only to recognize this person was not aperson from CB, at 1PM?? :-)"
CFRA maintains buy. Raises PT to $58.
"Another 52 week high, which is also multi-year."

Another day of DH HIG management having acted on “shareholders” behalf! What’s for breakfast on the house before workouts for management?
"take out price has to factor in the cost savings from consolidation from reductions in force and operations. Plus, there is $9.61 of cash per share. $80 is very reasonable"
RBC Capital raises Hartford price target to 61 dollars from 58 dollars.Maintains Outperform Rating.
hig sold today maybe $70 final.Redit says OPY (Oppenheimer)next at $70!
Buckingham Research lifts price terry on Hartford to 63 dollars from 60 dollars.Maintains Buy Rating.FWIW they also downgraded TRV from Buy to Neutral.
"Seven months ago HIG was at a 52 week low. Let's hope mgmt will exceed projections, benefiting all the longs, especially HIG retirees."
Wells Fargo raises HIG price target to 61 dollars and market perform.
"Anyone invested this stock is loosing a lot of money right now. ALL down as well. Is there any hope this stock will return to prior PPS if and when the economy recovers? This stock seems to be going down more than the markets, not proportional to them."
"ALL reported today, revenue was up by 5.8% but net income was down by 5.6%. Trend appears to be holding."
"Buckingham Research downgrades Hartford from Buy to Neutral.Price target 63 dollars.Overall from what I have been observing in recent ratings, HIG is taking more hits to a neutral rating (as yesterday with Citigroup and the present today from Buckingham) while in comparison, many others in this sub sector have had more sell ratings and actual far lower price targets. Valuations for these companies are high, as also is the general market flirting with new tops frequently. From my reading most believe HIG's present business model. earnings potential and management are positive going forward. If the negative plays out in the sector however, we will definitely feel the downward trade pressure from this group, IMO.Chaikin recently has HIG as a Neutral rating, primarily because of poorer CMF money flow and more neutral ratings from analysts. Very strong rating however with HIG's fundamentals in financial's and earnings.Schwab has HIG as an A rating their highest. Only weakness, IMO being ""price momentum"". Primarily they are on the same page as Chaikin and many others who view HIG's financials and earning potentials as positive but technicals and analysts as neutral.Overall, price targets are higher on HIG, even with these neutral ratings. Perhaps a sideways trade with influence from the overall market in the near term, IMO. Cheers."
It is not a direct comparison but TRV had good earning results this morning with an increase in their quarterly dividend.We are catching some of their wind in our Sp sails but hopefully bodes well for HIG results this quarter.Time will tell.
"What we are live time witnessing today is a money flow driven algorithm short trade. They walked Sp down from 31 to 19 dollars on only about 4 million shares, by both buying and selling shares and controlling the bid/ask and uptick.Facilitated of course, by a extreme downdraft market and lack of big buyers.Basically to a level in Sp not seen since 2012. CMF money flow spiked up as they started to cover, when the algorithm computer sensed no more selling.Were there long term sell-stops in place and easily observed on the journey down? Absolutely, and they were triggered and accumulated.HIG had tremendous volatility and Sp collapse during and after the financial crisis which makes this type of short trade far more successful than some of their peers like ALL, CB and TRV. They too have taken a great hit but no where near the 40% in one day.Actually, quite impressive that computer software can have this type of control but obviously depressing at the same time.Positive note, it is just a moment in time. The company itself is firing on all cylinders and longer term I expect to achieve new highs. Few observations, FWIW for any interested.Cheers to all longs."
The overpaid management said the offer not in the best interests of shareholders. What they really meant was we can’t keep our cushy high paying jobs!
Premarket move higher is very encouraging Despite no merger newsI figure that due to the holiday weekend the merger may not be announced until a later weekend
"So far looks like the results could have been far worse than anticipated. Pre tax loss from Coronavirus at 50 million. Suspension of stock buybacks but appears the dividend is still planning on being paid, for now anyway.Slight hit to BV.CC call will be interesting. Key on the table will be future liability estimates,"
Travelers has a good run up today.
"Randall, it appears that some institution read your post and is buying HIG. Stock has bounced $5 from the low in the last 30 minutes. (HIG could be buying?)"
"Nice earnings report DH Management-not! Now go get your free breakfast, childcare and say something about reducing carbon and increasing diversity-you work hard to earn your millions!"
Chubb up 186....hig dn...
"If they're willing to pay %70, they're willing to pay $80"
"Hartford upgraded to Buy from Neutral by B. Riley FBR.Price target raised to 60 dollars from 55 dollars.Upgrade based upon increased projected earnings from the NAVG purchase. They consider HIG shares (presently down -10% YTD) a low risk investment with a possible 21% all-in return potential.MT NewswireTime will tell of course, IMO but good press and upgrades never hurt.Cheers to all longs."
"Where are all the Yahoo stories telling you that higher taxes, lawlessness and crime and buying our own avalanche of US debt and higher rates are all good for the US stock market ...seems to be a daily occurrence."
KBW reduces HIG price target from 68 dollars to 64 dollars.Not that we are even close.
RBC raises PT on HIG to 68 dollars from 61 dollars.Maintains: Outperform Rating.
Wow Chubb had stellar earnings....Hig management better perform!
"Three factors, IMO that has led this decline---regardless of any/all upgrades: The NAVG purchase which was a disappointment to institutions.Hurricane Michael had significant losses for TRV (in their CC) and most likely will be for HIG.A bear overall market for a period and many or most insurance companies are getting hammerred.We traded in the thirties in 2016, I wouldn't be surprised to revisit those lows."
Chubb is 181 a share now. Hig barely moves and is still dn.
RBC raises PT to 70 dollars from 68 dollars.Maintains Outperform Rating.
Nice work Hartford management and thanks for the 20% increase in the dividend.Very appreciated!Cheers to all longs!
"Hig management hurts investors with purchases and sale of assets, especially to Warren Buffet who is laughing all the way to the bank."
Good thing CB did not get Hig for $70. We are higher than that price now!
"Forget Chubb.....The Hartford should seek a partnership with Berkshire Hathaway if selling! Berkshire Hathaway would use The Hartford to finally sell Homeowner's Insurance to go along with their successful Geico Auto Insurance operations. If that doesn't work out, The Hartford should partner with Travelers and leave Chubb's Greenberg with egg all over his face from the failed unsolicited buyout offer and poor negotiations!"
"This has been in the sock drawer for a very long time. M&A was always the exit plan. If not this time, another."
Another 52 week high and cross over into 55 handle. This has to be my most boring stock. And it's one of the best performing.
"Idk what’s sup with zacks, their expectations are negative yet the financials look ok."
RBC reduced price target to 58 dollar from 63 dollars.Reiterated Outperform Rating.Getting to be comical.
A very good print and hopefully a steady run back to $50+. Any thoughts?
my charts do not indicate any resistance under $60. Anyone have more reliable data. Please include 50 and 200 day moving averages. I can't trust my data links today...think there is a system malfunction. Thank you in advance. GLTA
Good news for HIG today regarding non-liability for business interruption. Nice pop.
"Every time these bumps make a purchase the market crushes share price. What are we down 30% from high and analysts predictions?Need new management, sell this company..."
Thanks again management for the new low.
CHUBB has a 13.5 PE to next year earnings and if you value HIG at a 13 PE that price would be $81 and still would be accretive to CHUBB
Buyout news on CC day? Apr 29th AH
Is Randall the only one who posts here?
HGH reached a new 52 Week Low at 28.78
"The Credit Swiss analyst Andrew Kligerman believes that the Hartford is undervalued and that there will be renewed interest in a buyout/merger between their peers,. Activists could see a 50% return premium if sold in entirety. The Group benefits being a particular gem.He raises the PT on the Hartford to 93 dollars from 82 dollars.Maintains their Outperform Rating.Cheers to all longs!."
Just noticed Chubb has PE of 20 while hig is 14. To be evenly priced hig pe needs to increase 50%.
"Dn,dn,dn almost $20 from yearly high. We need new management, not empire builders....."
So we got another offer of $70 ps and rejected. Chubb must increase to more than $80 ps to enter the fair value zone. Let's see what's the next offer
Citigroup initiates Hartford as a Neutral Rating.Price Target at 67 dollars.
"Few thoughts:One. With our recent past, present and hopefully continuing great earning results the institutions (that for the most part control our Sp) will add and initiate to their positions in HIG. IMO we should be viewed as one of the ""better of the breed"" as long as Swift was both honest and exact in his analysis. We have already had far higher price targets by an assortment of good analysts, that many institutions follow. Downside of course, we are still a part of small and large ETF's and other mutual funds that will detract from Sp progress in a sell off.Two. The headwinds I believe will be a very low interest rate environment for a longer time, an ensuing recession, larger overall market retracement and natural disasters (fire, floods, hurricaines); that appear to be recurring with more detriment and frequency. So far, so good, as HIG has ""navigated"" (no pun intended) these troubles excellent.Three. A minor detail but there is a gap in the chart from our recent move upwards and because it is closer numerical proximity, I expect it to be filled on a down day or period. Four. NAVG might very well be an ace in the hole for future quarterly earning results and in hindsight might be viewed as a very smart purchase--regardless of it's exorbitant price tag.Five. Great results yesterday IMO that hopefully will be followed by further upgrades if the analysts desire to be ahead of the curve.Six. IF, overall things continue positive I still expect a dividend increase in the next quarter to two. Cheers to all longs and please add more ideas."
HIG continues to struggle to even get to 40pps when the stock market is up. Formerly at 58pps and even higher. Most who invested this stock over a year ago have suffered a huge financial loss. Is there any hope for this stock prior to the Second Coming?
"Goldman Sachs raise Hartford from a NEUTRAL to a BUY Rating.They expect a modest earnings lift from the NAVG acquisition and stable margins in their legacy Personal and Commercial business segments.Also believes HIG's NTM price to earnings ratio is at a substantial discount to it's peers Chubb, Travelers. Says this discount is ""overstated"".Reuters"
Chubb in earnings call still looking to buy a P&C insurer. They are disappointed HIG refused their $70 a share offer.
Chubb buying Cigna health and life insurance.
Sold most of my shares. Any company that promotes a political science and Spanish major to chief investment office just because of gender and who turns down business because they produce coal is just to far left leaving profit motive and shareholders behind in their comfy little offices! Gone!
I hope we get shares of CB rather than cash.
Share price crushed because of talc exposure? Mgmt danced around that question.
Morgan Stanley upgrades Hartford to Overweight from EqualweightPrice Target to 48 dollars from 46 dollars.Deutsch Bank keeps a Buy RatingReduces PT to 63 dollars from 65 dollars.Average Composite Analyst HIG Rating:Buy Rating PT at 59 dollars.
Typical pre weekend rally expecting a possible merger news over the weekend!Looking good pals!Hope we wake up to good news on Monday morning.I’m still optimistic for a price both of 90 dollars.
"Might be a rough couple of days in the sub sector, as TRV missed by .92 though revenue was up.Higher asbestos claims."
This is one sleepy board. Anybody awake out there know why HIG is up $2 today?
Evercore ISI cuts Hartford price target to 70 dollars from 71 dollars.
Need to sell this company and/or get new management.
"Earnings disclosure, Chubb makes two new buyout offers that were rejected by Hig board."
"On a separate note, why is it that every time a hedge fund gets into trouble, the regulators are behind the curve and the tax payers and regular investors take the hit?"
Any news or reason for the 2% HIG move today?
"This is one of the oldest insurance companies in the nation, but the least transparent in business transactions. When I obtained the auto and home policy from them, they applied what is called a ""bundling rate discount"" and the last page of the policy declarations on discounts, just stated ""HIG Auto Policy."" When I took my auto policy elsewhere, guess what penalty they imposed on me? After 8 month they charged my escrow account around 24 percent for taking my auto policy somewhere else. They arbitrarily assign penalty amounts, no industry standard regarding this issue ever applies to them. Hartford's failure to conduct business ethically will only invite more scrutiny from regulators and as a result punish good insurers in the industry. If you think business ethics are irrelevant for guiding shareholders' investment behavior, keep buying their stock, I would abstain."
Reuters article similar to my post from yesterday. $80 minimum
"Earnings (beat of .10---6.7% surprise)) and revenue (5.298 billion) both look great and are being followed in the media as a ""beat of analyst expectations"" on both accounts.8% common dividend increase is very welcome for longer term investors.As of tonight, commentary all looks positive.Cheers for a good CC tomorrow."
Nice upgrade that IMO I agree completely---and will get some attention today:Janney Montgomery Scott after 10 years as a Neutral Rating upgraded Hartford to a Investment Grade Buy.They believe the weakness (both from the NAVG purchase as opposed to the share buy back and over weighting in workman comp) is overdone. HIG has one of the lowest price to earnings in the property casualty space (nine times) despite having very respectable return on equity of 11.6%. They believe they are well managed and positioned.Yes another good upgrade but CMF money flow value is now positive on the continued stagnant falling price. There has been great stealth buying by institutions already.Staying long and strong (no cover calls) and have been adding to my position. All iMO.Cheers to all longs.
Hig needs stellar earnings report with stellar guidance going forward!
"Management owns less than 1/3 of 1% of the company. They are happy to milk out shareholder equity in salaries, perks and flying on corporate jets."
This preferred will most likely be called at $25 on 4/2022.
JPM raises the price target on the Hartford to 63 dollars from 57 dollars.
Hig makes 1.33 and all we get is .35 cents! Doesn't seem fair.
"CB pe is 21HIG earnings are $4.76Without any premium at all, to be at parity, conservative price for HIG (20 x $4.76) would be at $95.75. Discount the offer by 10% and HIG is still worth $85.7. Mayne CB isn't willing to pay up, but someone will"
"KBW cuts PT to 67 dollars from 70 dollars.These PT reductions appears to be a trend by many analysts in HIG and other companies in the sector.Valuations/earnings are the main reasons but keeping it simple, these companies appear to be taking a break in the rise in Sp from their previous and extended ascent. Period of consolidation. The analysts are calling what is evident and present, IMO.In total, IMO they are still overall bullish on HIG from a longer term time horizon. Perform and outperform ratings with most having higher PT's.Cheers to all longs."
"as soon as they're done funding their deferred comp plan, they will sell"
Warren would like the HIG!
Would not be surprised to see offers that use stock and cash versus all cash offers.
CB will come with a better offer. Management can't stand in the way if offer is good

Bloomberg reports Allianz is interested in hig but does not want to get in a bidding war with Chubb.
The stock price on this company does not recovery well when hit by a market drop. We have been hearing target prices of 59 and 60 but the stock continues to drop--now as low as 46.55. What is this company doing to change that if anything?
"Should be an interesting earnings report next week:Option 59.50 straddle prices reflect a 4 percent potential move in either direction in price.CMF money flow has been improving, suggesting accumulation before results.Overall market appears on shaky ground, yet is holding up.HIG management has delivered positive earning results as of recent quarterly reports.Staying long."
"Talcott Sale Finalized: More financial flexibility, possible sale of all of HIG, possible dividend increase."
"ACE paid a 30% premium to buy out CHUBB in 2015 - there is no way that HIG would be bought out at 21B, which means no premium. Take out price must be $78 +"
Looks like hig is in a trading range moving up and dn around 1.50 a share.
Chubb is 184.24...hig shareholders could of had shares and cash.....but greedy hig mgmt did not want to loose their jobs!
"FWIW: Schwab increased their rating of HIG to a level ""A"", their highest. Chaikin Power Gauge also has HIG as Very Bullish, in every category (Financials, Earnings, Technicals and Expert) their highest rating."
"If CB was really walking away, their stock would be back up closer to where it was before the offer - $180. Assumption is they will be back with a sweetened offer"
"Even when the markets are up this stock is down, with no resistance to further decline. What an under-performing stock this is. Hopefully another carrier will buy HIG and turn this around."
Surprised Hig not bought out. To many P&C companies. Hartford and Trv a very good combo.Always thought Allianz would buy them.
We can expect a competitive process if HIG chooses to sell with Allianz and Zurich joining the process ... fair value is at least 80
Huge earnings beet of $2.33 per share versus $1.33 expected.
"As an ""insider"", I know that the executive leadership team just doesn't have the experience to lead a growth strategy. If they truly want to maximize shareholder value, it's time to sell."

No guarantee of course we hold above this level but it is still a sign of good progress by management from the melt down days, IMO. Next of the agenda, IF quarterly results are good, the general market stays coherent and their catastrophe losses are in alignment, I am hoping for a slight dividend increase. Cheers to all longs!"

CB offer was really cheap. What would they expect? Good thing it had trigerred the interest of others. If they don't up their offer...
Great quarterly results with EPS at .78 which is a 20% surprise.The 1 billion dollar share repurchase program is what have desired and needed at these Sp levels.Remodeling of the business structure with NAVG on board is a good idea and necessary for the maximum productivity.Cheers to all longs.

Amazing upgrades but daily hig falls. When have we seen an up day or week. Nearing 52 week low.
Upgrade Credit Suise.
"Chaikin Money Flow is now slightly positive and has increased on falling Sp price from -.3 to a positive.008. A good sign IMO that the institutions have been buying this longer term dip in Sp while keeping price low. IF the overall market/sector stays compatible, IMO we should be ready to begin a rebound in price. These positive divergences are usually helpful. Time will tell.Cheers to all longs."
CEO bought $500k of HIG stock on the open market on January 10. It's his first open market purchase ever. A director also bought shares in December.
"Interesting end of day trade. Huge spike in both volume and CMF money flow in the last half hour of trading today for the end of a rather otherwise boring day.Total daily volume is at approximately 4,400,00. or over double the average for 6 months.TRV ALL CB and others were all positive but not the increased volume.Some positive news, time will tell."

Barclays raises the PT on the Hartford to 76 dollars from 73 dollars.
Barclays cuts target price on Hartford to 59 dollars from 64 dollars.Seems irrelevant.
"Looking fairly well as to the recovery in Sp, IMO.We broke ahead of our short term intermediary high at 43.18 from back in April.We are well above the EMA (34) and the SMA (50).Next challenge is the SMA (200) which hovers at about 52.30. There are also some gaps in Sp in this latest ascent to reach that value. The MM will want those gaps filled.Money flow has been steadily improving in value of CMF (Chaikin Money Flow) and OBV (On Balance Volume) designating institutional support for this price increase.I would expect a partial retrace fairly soon in Sp from our present ascent. Normal trading and a good short term buying opportunity.Cheers to all longs."
Barclay's lifts price target on Hartford to 70 dollars from 62 dollars.Maintains Outperform Rating.

"If HIG truly cared about shareholder value, they would work to sell the company. They don't know how to grow the company and are stuck in internal political B.S."
Still on the top buyout candidates list. Will Chubb offer a more reasonable price? It's really a bargain even at $80 ps IMO...
"HIG has performed well since earnings. Some of it is due to positive results, and some is because of an upward trending stock market."
Just read Chubb's earnings transcript. What I read was Chubb was moving on from their $70 per share offer. They do not look back. Does this open the door for Allianz or others? Does this mean a new higher proposal is in the works? Hig will be ok either way!

"Navigators go shop period ends this week. I don't expect higher offers, although I would be delighted to see someone outbid HiG and have HIG walk away. It funny to see the usual ambulance chasers put up PRs saying that they are investigating. Navigators is getting a good deal. That said, NAVG is trading at the buyout price, which indicates that shareholders think they'll get more."
Randall?? You've been quiet.
"Merger and Acquisition is in the air this morning.XL was bought by AXA, at a 33% premium over the last closing price.AXA is now the world's leading Global PC Insurance Provider.Cheers that this stimulates or motivates other major insurance PC providers---as they need to compete with AXA. A HIG buy out would be a good endeavor, as they have streamlined their business with the Talcott sale recently, IMO.Good for the acquirer (perhaps TRV, AIG or another), good for the Hartford, good for the CEO and management (massive multi million bonuses) and good for us shareholders.If nothing else, good to see the Sp rise on a down day.Cheers to all longs."
Randall. Buyers and sellers don't pay attention to what or how often you post. I hope you have eggs in more than 1 basket and I wish you well.
"Look back at what happened with TIF, KSU, COHR, WORK, etc. Initial offer is always a lowball starting point. CB CEO wants this deal. It is accretive and with CB stock at all time high, they can use stock plus cash to make it even more synergistic. Using weakness to accumulate shares with a target in high $70's for ultimate buyout"
"An amount of the run up in share price these past couple of years has partially been to the anticipation of a buy out of HIG from a larger player, at least IMO. Selling Talcott, debt etc. However, they seem to be presently charting a different path (with their own past and potential future) acquisitions to improve and bolster earnings. If the price was right there are certainly great perks for management to sell or merge the Hartford but my guess they are fine tuning their existing structure and adding businesses for increased profitability.Time will tell but in the interim we might expect doldrums and some stagnation in Sp appreciation, regardless of earnings as those institutions who bought for a buy out, move on.Staying long and strong, management is top notch and have also rewarded share holders with good dividend increases. Always disappointing to have a large down day after a good quarterly beat.Cheers."
A nice beat on both quarterly earnings and revenue.Looks better than expected from what the analysts desired.Cheers that we get a good follow through in the CC.
"This carnage of all the PC and entire insurance sector, let alone of the entire market, is far overdone, IMO. We are not alone if one looks at the charts of ALL, TRV, CB, AIG, PRU, MET and many others. The banking industry stocks have also been hit hard. Overall fundamentals and analyst ratings are immaterial. What is prevailing and completely controlling the trade is short positions and media driven fear and panic with selling.Liability of lost income and business interruption etc from businesses; interest rate reduction and an existing ensuing recession are all reasons but their impact is far from known, let alone the duration of the challenges.Only slight positive (saying tongue in cheek) management should be able to repurchase double the amount of shares with their buy back program.Overall IMO, this risk off trade is similar to the financial crisis, albeit for different reasons of the fear and panic. It will pass, necessity is the mother of invention. Coronavirus treatments are already developing and a vaccine will be on the horizon. The fed is providing ample liquidity to the banking system and economy.We can all go on and on but the carnage still prevails, regardless of excuses and reasons.Feel free to add to the list. FWIW--- PRU, TRV and ALL appear to be holding a bottom for the present."
