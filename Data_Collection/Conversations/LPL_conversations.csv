Digital Trends: LG’s 88-inch 8K OLED TV makes public debut at IFA 2018. Here’s why that matters.https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/lg-88-inch-8k-oled-tv-introduced-ifa2018/Short squeeze!
If I see a number of screens for the first order we can maybe make a estimate of what potential we’re looking at but before that happens I’m staying away still- seems to be dropping persistently-
"If the price is judged by technology, LPL is grossly undervalued."
I totally agree with Mark regarding Zack’s advice on LPL
"High dividend, future contract with Apple. Seems like a no brainer for the long term."
Earnings report today?
Import tariffs?
"I was wondering why we went up today and after-hours........wellllll.......again, this is heresay but more contracts look to be on the way.We may be getting ready to go up another level next week boys and gals.....https://www.neowin.net/news/lg-display-may-be-planning-to-produce-foldable-displays-in-2019"
"LG has no hope in the OLED race. they are been beating by Chinese LCD manufacturer in price. It seems that LPL is trying to shift the production towards OLED to maintain it's margin. However, if you look at the manufacturers in both China and Taiwan, you will find the production shifting as well. There are two major manufacturers in China had just finished their OLED production facilities build up. Taiwan foxconn is doing the same in Taiwan and Wisconsin, expecting mass production starting in 2019, which is about a year from now. Meanwhile, there are Apple people showed up at Chinese OELD production factories in Chengdu, so there is a clue that Apple can select the Chinese in future for its OLED screen. LPL may have a turn around for profit for 1 or 2 quarters, but they will be in same margin pressure position again within a year."
"Samsung, LGD ramping up OLED panels for small- to medium-size applications, Digitimes Research saysChiawen Chang, DIGITIMES Research, TaipeiFriday 18 December 2020Combined sales of OLED panels by Samsung Display and LG Display (LGD) for small- to medium-size applications are expected to reach KRW9.6 trillion (US$9.4 billion) in the fourth quarter of 2020, up 46.2% sequentially and 31.2% on year, according to an estimate by Digitimes Research.The optimistic prospects come after both firms experienced increased revenues and shipments for small- to medium-size OLED panels in the previous quarter, driven by growing demand from the smartphone and wearable sectors.Demand for OLED panels from the smartphone sector has rebounded as the pandemic-induced impacts on the handset supply chain have eased, while the launch of Apple's all OLED iPhone 12 lineup has encouraged other handset brands to also adopt OLED panels for their mid-range to high-end models, Digitimes Research said.In 2021, OLED-based models are expected to account for 40% of global smartphone shipments, said Digitimes Research. Besides, demand for OLED panels for Apple Watch devices is likely to double in the coming year.To cash in on increasing demand, both LGD and Japan Display (JDI) have accelerated their expansion projects for ramping up OLED panels."

and trade at $10
"You better load up LPL before the partnership with Apple become a reality. We all know Apple hate Samsung, they would jump ship to LG the moment LG can meet the supply demand of Apple's products."
hope we close at 9 today...allllllllmost
Imagine if this stock recovered the short squeeze could be quite dramatic
"Might see a bit of upside tomorrow given that LG was discovered to supply the Pixel 3’s display, which had stunning reviews. It appears they are at a level where they can compete with Samsung display, which is very encouraging news."
"On April 26, 2019 Zacks Investment Research, Inc. upgraded LG DISPLAY CO LTD ( LPL Loading...Loading...) from HOLD to BUY."
They had some interesting insights abou LPL on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
the price keeps getting better
"Is future PE of 8 and 5-year PEG of .19 accurate? If so, why isn’t this a $50 stock? Beaten down too much the past few years?"

Good to see a much needed bounce back today.
"nice Volume today, steady climbing ahead"
LPL is down -4.94% to 9.05
Next stop $10. Crazy undervalued still. Just bought more. Apple will bring this to the moon!
I'm adding more as it goes down.
"Huge volume, hopefully the beginnings of a short squeeze."
is this closing green? 
"Their Q3 earnings transcript says that they estimate 4.2M-4.5M OLED TV panels for 2020, and 7M-8M OLED TV panels for 2021. That's an increase of 3.25M OLED panels for 2021. If you apply an average cost of $700 per panel to manufacture, this would equate to an $2.3B of additional revenue. I don't see this increase in the analyst estimate, and I don't believe it has already been factored into the current share price. If I factor in these numbers, I can conservatively see the increase in share price of $3-$4 per share. I hope a nice pop will happen soon."
"With Korean economy stumbling, not sure it will recover soon"
"Samsung and LG clash over the 46 trillion won small and medium-sized OLED market'Catch the 46 trillion won in the future food market'As the small and medium-sized organic light emitting diode (OLED) panel market is gradually growing, Samsung and LG are competing fiercely with differentiated technologies centering on small and medium-sized panels.According to industry sources on the 7th, Samsung Display and LG Display are intensifying investment competition as their small and medium-sized OLED market, which was centered on smartphones, has recently expanded to laptops and tablets.Accordingly, Samsung Display decided to start mass production of QD (quantum dot) OLED panels for TVs from the fourth quarter of this year, and LG Display announced that it would significantly increase investment in small and medium-sized OLED panels to become the strongest player in small and medium-sized OLED panels following large ones.The outlook for the small and medium-sized OLED market is bright.According to the Korea Display Industry Association, the small and medium-sized OLED market last year was $26 billion (about 30.5 trillion won), which is more than six times larger than the large OLED ($4.2 billion) and accounts for 86.1% of the total OLED market.In particular, the small and medium-sized OLED market is expected to grow to $39 billion (about 45.87 trillion won) in 2024 due to a surge in demand for mounting OLED panels in displays for mobile, tablet, and automotive electronic equipment (electronic devices).LG Display invests 3.3 trillion won in small and medium-sized OLEDsSamsung Display to increase production of small and medium-sized OLED laptops and tabletsSource: news.g-enews"
it's going to 8:50 and I'm getting in because it's going on higher after that
Most overlooked stock in history. Why isn't this trending?

"Omdia: 3,000 rollable TVs to ship in 2022 and 672,000 in 2027As LG Electronics is launching its 65"" rollable TV (65RX OLED) globally, market researchers from Omdia estimate that shipments of rollable TVs will be around 3,000 next year. The market will grow to 74,000 units in 2024 and 672,000 units in 2027.This is fast growth, but numbers will still be very limited, it seems as Omdia does not expect mass market adoption for rollable TVs.The first hurdle that LG will have to overcome is the price - currently the 65"" model costs £99,999 in the UK - or around $137,000. The price in Korea is around $87,000."
Shaking the tree?
Tomorrow
Big day tomorrow.....expect GREAT outlook with the Apple contract that hasn't been made public( for whatever reason) and with Pixel and OLED sales.....not kidding....if projections are what I think they'll be...we go to 10 tomorrow!If they miss......and weak sales....look out below.but imo....all indications are we are at garage sale right now.
Current P/E of 65. Buy? I don't think so.
per Zacks this is supposed to see 357% earnings growth this year. This should be moving up not down.
"TV / Monitor sales up at least +50% y/y, expecting a significant boost for the remainder of 2020. https://i.imgur.com/OA7h9qZ.png"

Slow and steady come back.
"As an expert in Korean companies, This is a gem in the mud, going to $ 10 soon. Good luck guys"
OLED 4% gainer again. 400 point up day on DOW will let LPL eke out a 1 or2% gain - on negligible volume.
"LPL is a strong buy/hold. Book value: $18.62/share, Revenue: $36.00/share. OLED TV and OLED supplier for Apple will be the catalysts and give LPL the momentum to outperform. I sold a small position in VIPS today to buy into LPL. Long LPL and VIPS."
"Has anybody done the numbers on LG? First question: Why when you calculate the price of this ADR does it equal TWICE the US/KW exchange rate?Second question: The PE is shown at about 5 yet when you calculate the PE from a reasonable estimate of annual earnings on the Korean side, it equals ~25. Considering the 2x price on LG (exchange) this PE could be 50!"
Will LG put OLED screen on their future Appliances?
Likely another good opportunity to day trade LG
LPL is down -5.05% to 10.71
"Price to sales of 0.29! Come on now this is some value, hard to find in today’s market"
Early Bottom?Maybe the bottoming has begun.
"LG Display was considering converting its E5 production line at its Gumi factory to produce OLED panels for iPhones, TheElec has learned.E5 currently produces OLED panels for automobile and wearable applications.Currently, LG Display uses its E6 line at its factory in Paju to produce OLED panels for Apple for use in iPhones.The conversion of E5 is done for the company to supply more OLED panels for iPhones.LG Display is aiming to supply at least 40 million OLED panels for iPhones next year, sources within the company said. It is hoping to supply up to 50 million units if possible, they said.To reach that goal, E6-1 and E6-2 lines won’t be sufficient. The lines each have a production capacity of 15,000 substrates per month. This allows LG Display to execute 30,000 substrates per month, and with a yield rate of 80%, this means it can produce around 36 million units of 6-inch OLED panels a year.LG Display is planning to build another line, called E6-3, but back-end equipment for this line will be put in around September 2021, which means commercial production will likely begin in 2022 at the earliest.E5 also has a production capacity of 15,000 substrates per month. LG Display is planning to use half of that, or around 7,500, for iPhone OLED panels.LG Display has sent its line conversion plan to Apple. Cupertino is reviewing the matter but is yet to give the go-ahead.Converting E5 will save LG Display cost and allow it to increase panel production within a couple months. The South Korean display panel maker will secure a production capacity of 37,500 substrates per month. This will allow it to produce up to 45 million OLED panels a year.LG Display shipped 20 million units of OLED panels for Apple this year. Both LG Display and Samsung Display have set high targets for their OLED panel shipment for iPhones next year."
End of June is when we heard this as a rumor. It is still a rumor now. We need the official announcement to skyrocket....even though earnings should see a significant pop without this announcement.
OLED (Universal Display Corporation) Beats Earnings! Good For LG Display!!!!
"LG Electronics announced that it is partnering with door solutions developer Assa Abloy Entrance Systems to commercialize automatic sliding doors with transparent OLED panels.According to Prescient & Strategic Intelligence, the transparent display market is expected to grow on average 46 percent per year, which should translate into annual sales of around $5 billion by 2024. Samsung has mostly given up on making transparent displays, with reports of the company having ceased production in 2016. This gives LG an opportunity to capture a big share of that market, although we do know Samsung is at least toying with the idea of transparent displays for smartphones."
"[Exclusive] Samsung Electronics finally joined hands with LGD... OLED panel annual supply contract of 3 million sheetsSamsung Electronics will receive organic light emitting diode (OLED) panels from LG Display and enter the OLED TV market in earnest. As Chinese companies control the supply of liquid crystal display (LCD) panels and the prices continue to rise and LCD TV profitability gradually deteriorates, it is interpreted that they have joined hands with rival LG Display.According to the financial investment industry and the display industry on the 21st, Samsung Electronics is planning to sign a contract with LG Display to supply 2 million to 3 million OLED panels per year from next year to 2024. It is known that as early as this week, Han Jong-hee, head of Samsung Electronics' video display (VD) business division, will make an announcement directly. According to market research firm Omdia last month, the average price of an OLED panel in the first quarter of this year based on a 55-inch general-purpose product is $510 (about 580,000 won). Taking this into consideration, a simple calculation would estimate the contract size to exceed 5 trillion won.Accordingly, Samsung Electronics, which has not yet released an OLED TV, is expected to enter the market in earnest. While the OLED TV market is growing rapidly, it is determined that it will be difficult to keep pace with the market growth rate with the large OLED panel 'QD OLED' being developed by its subsidiary Samsung Display. Although there is a forecast that Samsung Display will mass-produce QD OLED within this year, it takes considerable time for yield stabilization in the initial stage of production. For this reason, it is predicted that it will be difficult to exceed 1 million shipments next year by only supplying itself.Cooperation between Samsung Electronics and LG Display has been discussed several times in the past, but has been canceled due to various circumstances such as security. However, with the recent surge in LCD demand due to COVID-19 and Chinese companies such as BOE raising prices, it is no longer possible to guarantee profitability with LCD TV alone. In the OLED TV market, which is considered to be the future food of the future, some analysts say that the two companies have joined hands by winning over concerns that the future of the domestic display industry will be uncertain if they do not secure cost competitiveness from Chinese companies.An industry official said, ""As the price bargaining power with Chinese display companies is low, they are trying to change the plate to OLED while holding hands with LG Display, which is in competition with its subsidiaries."" ""In particular, the Chinese display industry is at a serious level for domestic companies. It seems that the two companies have decided to cooperate with each other for the protection and development of the domestic display ecosystem in the face of threats.”"
Apple will give all their business to LG once LG gets rolling with the small OLED screens. Apple does not want to continue giving the business so they’re competitor Samsung . Also for people who don’t know LG supplies all the panels to Sony whether it’s LED or OLED. So the next time you buy Sony you’re actually buying an LG panel with Sony processors .
Go LG!!!
"LG Display expands OLED facilities in Vietnam... 830 billion additional investmentFirst Entry 2021-02-08 11:36:59BigsmallIt is reported that LG Display has decided to significantly expand organic light-emitting diode (OLED) facilities by investing an additional KRW 830 billion in a module assembly plant in Hai Phong city in northern Vietnam.According to local media such as Vietnam News Agency (VNA) on the 8th, Hai Phong City granted an additional investment of $750 million (about 838.8 billion won) to LG Display the day before.As a result, LG Display's total investment in Vietnam will increase to 3.25 billion dollars (about 3.63 trillion won).It is known that LG Display will significantly expand its OLED production facilities in its existing module assembly plant as early as next month.In addition, it is reported that it will select an additional 5,000 local employees by next year.A local source said, ""I know that LG Display has decided to expand production facilities in its existing factory, seeing that the OLED display market will grow."""

"LG to increase 48-inch OLED TV panel production to 1 million units in 2021According to a new report from Korea, LG Display is enjoying high demand for its 48-inch OLED TV panels, especially from gamers, and the company aims to expand its production of such panels.LGD currently produces the panels at its new Guangzhou OLED TV fab, in which it uses one 8.5-Gen glass plate to produce two 77-inch panels and two 48-inch panels. It now plans to start making 48-inch displays in its Paju OLED TV fab, where it will cut one 8.5-Gen plate to 8 48-inch panels.It is estimated that LGD will ship over one million 48-inch panels this year, up from 220,000 in 2020.Interestingly, the high demand for 48-inch panels caused an unusual situation where sometimes 55-inch OLED TVs cost less than a 48-inch OLED TV of the same model - because TV makers are offering discounts for the 55-inch models but not the 48-inch ones.Source: Chosun"
LG needs to be really careful with this new factory they're planning to build in China.https://www.theepochtimes.com/chinese-regime-threatens-technology-transfer-in-order-for-south-korean-firm-lgd-to-open-chinese-factory_2566158.html
what is going on?? this is the lowest price in the last 5 years on no news ??? its way oversold. Now the question is stop loss or wait for the bounce back (if is ever going to happen)
"Gotta love OLED, rolling upward nicely. LPL is dead stock and losing money, missing reduced expectations quarter after quarter with no end in sight."
These articles are not explaining things correctly! The 2.7 billion investment reduction will be towarda LCD panels for mobile phones and televisions etc.
I've been talking with a number of folks about LG's customer service. Feedback is not good - sounds like they are not willing to stand behind their products and that quality is decreasing. Just my local observation but this does not give me confidence in the company.
$10 this week. $12 next. Buckle up. Especially when apple gets on board
10 dollar barrier already behind ??? We need more volume !!!!
"June 2018:Apple warns suppliers of 20% drop in new iPhone parts orders,” published by Nikkei Asian Review back on June 8. In the report, the authors stated that Apple had “asked its supply chain to prepare around 20% fewer components for iPhones debuting in the latter half of 2018,” so it looks like their information was spot-on once again."
So I got back in today; too early it turns out. I suspect today's drop is more about the news hype than anything else. Volume was low. See what tonight brings.
"LG Display, 2Q operating profit of 701.1 billion 'surprise performance'... maximum in 4 yearsLG Display recorded 'surprising results' (earnings surprise) thanks to the display boom in the second quarter of this year. It is the first time in four years since the second quarter of 2017 that LG Display's operating profit exceeded 700 billion won. Sales also achieved the highest performance in the second quarter of the year. Sales growth in the TV division, including OLED, and solid performance in IT led to overall profit improvement.LG Display announced on the 28th that it recorded 6.96 trillion won in sales and 701.1 billion won in operating profit in the second quarter of this year.Compared to the previous quarter, sales increased by 1% and operating profit increased by 34%. Compared to the same period last year, sales increased by 31% and operating profit improved by more than 1 trillion won. The operating profit margin in the second quarter was 10%, recovering to double digits for the first time in 16 quarters.The EBITDA profit rate was 25.4% (EBITDA of 1.77 trillion won), the highest level since the third quarter of 2009, and the net profit was 423.8 billion won.Major financial indicators showed continuous improvement, with a debt ratio of 164%, a current ratio of 96%, and a net debt ratio of 69%.In terms of sales by product, IT panel accounted for the largest share at 39%, while the proportion of TV panel, which increased by 7% QoQ, and mobile panel, accounted for 23%.By major business division, OLED TV shipments in the first half were 3.5 million units, which already exceeded 80% of last year's annual shipments.LG Display plans to continuously strengthen the position of OLED TVs in the ultra-large market in the second half of the year and further expand the mid-size premium market. At the same time, we plan to discover and nurture high-margin, high-growth fields that can realize the unique value of OLED."
"LCD pulls forward and OLED pushes back... LG Display forecasts sales of 7 trillion won in the first quarterLG Display's sales in the first quarter of this year are expected to exceed 7 trillion won. The rise in liquid crystal display (LCD) panel prices and strong organic light-emitting diode (OLED) sales are considered to be the reasons for the strong performance.According to the securities industry on the 22nd, Shinhan Investment Corp. expected LG Display's sales in the first quarter of this year to KRW 7.2 trillion. This is a 48.2% increase from 4.72 trillion won in the first quarter of last year. Kiwoom Securities and Mirae Asset Daewoo also predicted that LG Display will generate sales of 7.34 trillion won and 7.34 trillion won, respectively, in the first quarter of this year.In 2015, LG Display's first quarter sales exceeded 7 trillion won is the only one. At the time, LG Display recorded sales of 7,223 trillion won thanks to the strong sales of large LCDs used in TVs. As expected in the first quarter of this year, if LG Display achieves KRW 7 trillion in sales, it will record KRW 7 trillion in sales in the first quarter after six years. In the first quater of 2015 LPL was trading above $12 per share.The dominant evaluation is that the increase in the price of LCD panels for TVs has driven sales growth. According to market researcher Omdia, the price of 32-65-inch LCD panels rose 4-5% last month compared to the previous month. The 55-inch 4K LCD panel with the most shipments last month's price was $191 (about 218,000 won), up 73% from $110 in March last year. The 65-inch 4K LCD panel price also jumped 42% from 170 dollars (about 194,000 won) to 242 dollars (about 276,000 won) during the same period."
It seems like LG has made the right decision to move out of LCD panels and to focus 100 % on manufacturing of OLED panels. OLED is the future. It might be a bumpy road but in the long run I can see this stock double in a year.

LG display is working on folding display for Apple ?
Like watching paint dry...
The price is down ~10% in premarket but with only 11k shares traded.
This in not a turn.
I have to believe yesterday was the bottom. Rumors of Apple using LG for their screens was enough to make the bleeding stop.Now we need the actual contract announcement to move us forward. This just became a huge buying opportunity and a dream investment for the pros. LG has half its market cap in cash and they make 4X their market cap in Revenues. As a plus they also pay a decent dividend....what's not to love?I just jumped into the cold pool but the heater just kicked in.
"LG Display details how OLED TV production is more environmentally friendly than LCD productionLG Display says that OLED TV production is more environmentally friendly than LCD TV production. A 65-inch LCD requires around 5.2 Kg of plastic, while a similarly-sized OLED uses only 0.43 Kg of plastics.LG Display says that in Q1 2021 alone its plastic consumption was lower by 71,550 tons compared to what it would have been if it produced LCD TVs instead of OLED TVs.According to LG's analysis, OLED TV panels reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds by more than 50 percent compared to LCD TV panels. This makes OLED TVs also easier to recycle - according to LGD the product recycling rate of OLED TV panels is 92.2%, higher than that of LCD TVs (<72%). LGD uses recyclable iron as materials for OLED panel parts.LGD also updates that in 2020, the company reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 39% compared to 2014.Source: Business Korea"
"LG Display reports solid Q1 2021 results, will decide on OLED TV capacity expansion by Q3 2021LG Display announced its financial results for Q1 2021. The company reported sales of $6.2 billion, an operating income of $469.5 million and net profit of $238 million. Sales were lower (by 8%) compared to Q4 2020, but higher by 46% from Q4 2020. LGD remained profitable for the third consecutive quarter.LGD reported strong OLED TV sales, despite the seasonality - 1.6 million OLED TV panels shipped in the quarter, similar to Q4 2020 (which represents a peak season). LGD is on track to ship 8 million OLED TV panels in 2021. Mobile OLED panel shipments were lower than Q4 2020.LGD says that its current view on the OLED TV market is positive, but it is not ready yet to commit to capacity expansion. LGD's management says that in Q2 or Q3 2021 it will likely to make a decision whether to increase capacity or not. For mobile OLEDs, its current plan is to maximize its productivity from its existing capacity (30,000 monthly substrates in its Paju fab, and 15,000 in Kumi). It has no immediate plans to expand mobile OLED production.An interesting remark was made on the IT market. LGD sees OLED adoption increasing - in laptops and monitors. It is looking at the market, and plans to enter this market in the future, when it has technological advantages over other companies.Source: oled-info"

"First time posting on this LPL Board. 29K Shares purchased this morning (Bullish/Long). Looking for LPL to have a great year (We'll see). I'm a 10 year+ mercedes owner and I will say that owning a vehicle with a Full Span Digitally Integrated Dash is an absolute game changer. The interiors are gorgeous, with super clean lines, lit up amazing at night, and most importantly super fricken easy to clean! I simply feel strongly that the we are smack dab in the middle of all autos at every price point having this look and feel. Its got to be much easier long term on the assembly line as well (plug n play vs individual instrumentation parts)."
There have been a few supports around $8 since 2004. With the Apple deal this is a strong buy in my book.
"I like LPL products... However I see LOTS and LOTS of TV's left over from black Friday and I thought that the inventory would be gone by Christmas, but No, there are still quite a few at Wal*Mart and Best Buy. If LPL accounts for the TVs shipped to the stores as sold, I see a good upside on earnings, however lots of inventory indicates that sale in the first quarter will be non-existent. Plus one of the largest buyers of computer screens is shut down (US Government). In addition, I do not see many of the 800,000 Govt workers up dating to new i-phones at $1300 a pop. - or their family members. but Hey that's just the US market. Hopefully the rest of the world is doing better. I will remain hopefully cautious on LPL."

Wait and see what’s in store .... good luck to all the shareholders
A few days of churn then a 5% plummet. We're due for another nice haircut. Nothing at this point after Apple to stop the negative trajectory. Fundamentals are not good

"Mercedes' upcoming EVs to use a 56-inch flexible OLED displayMercedes announced that its upcoming EQS electric vehicle will adopt a large curved front display, 56-inch in size, called the MBUX Hyperscreen.This is a flexible OLED display, that will stretch over the entire width of the car. Note that the OLED itself is not 56-inch in size, this display embeds what seems to be 3 different OLED displays. The 56-inch glass also includes holes for the air-vents which are integrated into the display. The whole system is powered by 8 CPU cores, 24 GB of RAM and AI software that learns your habits.Mercedes did not yet unveil the EQS or detail its pricing and availability, but it should be announced later in 2021.Mercedes is likely to be using LG Display's OLEDs, as the two companies have been working together since around 2016.Source: OLED-info"

LG Display reached a 52 Week high at 11.18
any have info on divided ex date? can't seem to find it.
LG has signed a deal with Apple to supply both LCD and OLED panels for Apples 2018 range of iPhones. The contract will see LG ship around 20 million LCD smartphone panels to Apple and 3-4 million OLED panels.
First time in China OLED price hike in many years. This is just a sign that factories can't keep up with the demand. Yesterday Chinese Electronic Manufacturer Association released a report indicating the price in large screen fabrication has increased over 12% in sales side. They are expecting 2-3% more increase this month. It is a good sign for the supply side because the OLED price has been going down in past few years with the added capacity as well more mature technology. Now the price trend is completely reversed first time in several years. This price hike trend will definitely translate to profit increase in the next quarter report and thereafter. Time to buy and hold now! LPL finally will take off!
"LG Display to supply more OLED panels to Apple for iPhones this yearByJeetApple has started using OLED display panels for the entire smartphone lineup with the iPhone 12 series and is expected to continue doing so with the upcoming iPhone 13 series. A report from Omdia claims that around 169 million units of iPhone OLED panels will be shipped this year.In comparison, the expected shipments are 47.6 percent higher than the 114.5 million units shipped last year. It is said that LG Display will be shipping more units of OLED panels this year to Apple.The Omdia report estimates that Samsung Display will be shipping 110 million units of OLED panels for iPhone while LG Display will be shipping 50 million units and BOE will be shipping 9 million units.Last year, Samsung Display had shipped 89.6 million units while LG Display had shipped 25 million units. When compared year-on-year, shipments from these companies increased 22.8 percent and 100 percent respectively.In the year 2020, the market share of Samsung Display for iPhone OLED panels was 78.3 percent, which will drop to 65.1 percent this year, if the new estimates from Omdia turn out to be true. On the other hand, the share of LG Display will increase from 21.8 percent to 29.6 percent while China-based BOE‘s share will be 5.3 percent.Based on the estimates, Apple will be the largest procure of smartphone OLED panels this year, followed by Samsung Electronics and Xiaomi.As per the report, 584.5 million units of OLED panels are expected to get shipped this year, representing an increase of 28 percent compared to 2020.

LG main focus moving forward will be towards OLED panels for both mobile phones and televisions etc. Theae articles are very misleading for the investors and should be cleared up. The overstock and increased competition in LCD panels were already priced in the to stock and was the reason LG stock was down almost 40 percent for the year. They are planting their seeds correctly and should be profitable again by the end of the year.

"Short term not good, long term much better. We can expect further downside in the short term as old products near the end of their product life cycles. However, there are unlimited applications for the new OLED technology with its paper thin flexible displays. Applications will no longer be limited to TVs, iPhones and watches. Car dashboards, advertising, virtual reality, lighting, etc., etc. The financial and technological barriers to entry will limit this enormous market opportunity to just a few suppliers with LPL being one of them."

"LG Display invests 3.3 trillion won in small and medium-sized OLED... The reason for the increase in investment is 1.3 trillion wonThe existing 2 trillion won standard is calculated as LTPS type.This time, LTPO + two-stack layer technology will be used.LG Display will additionally invest in small and medium-sized OLED (organic light-emitting diode) production lines. This is a response to the recent increase in the use of OLED for IT displays such as laptops and tablet PCs.LG Display held a board meeting on the 13th and announced on the 17th that it has decided to invest 3.3 trillion won in the small and medium-sized OLED field. Currently, LG Display is producing small and medium-sized OLEDs at E5 in Gumi, Gyeongsangbuk-do and E6 in Paju, Gyeonggi-do. Currently, the E5 has a production capacity of 15,000 sheets per month based on the 6th generation (1500mm X 1850mm) raw plate input, and the E6 has a production capacity of 30,000 sheets. The additional investment to be made this time is estimated to be at the level of 15,000 sheets per month. Considering that it usually takes 2 trillion won to invest 15,000 sheets of 6th generation OLED, the investment is about 1.3 trillion won, which is larger. This is because the calculation of the existing 2 trillion won investment is based on the selection of LTPS (Low Temperature Polysilicon) as TFT (Thin Film Transistor), which is the switch of the display. This time, LG Display's investment is expected to include LTPO (Low Temperature Polysilicon Oxide) technology and integrated touch screen technology as all the latest construction methods are mobilized. Since both LTPO and all-in-one touch screen technologies use photo processes, the amount of equipment required for deposition (CVD), exposure, and etching is also increased. In addition, the evaporation line, which accounts for 30-40% of the investment, is also expected to be equipped with a 'two-stack layer'. Two-stack layer refers to a technology that stacks two sub-pixel layers that emit red, green, and blue light in OLED. If two red, green, and blue layers overlap each other, bright light can be emitted without passing a large current to each layer. It's like using two lights at the right brightness for a longer period of time than using one light at full brightness. By reducing the load applied to each subpixel, the device lifespan is increased.This is an essential technology for IT OLED panels that are vulnerable to pixel burn-in and have a long replacement cycle. According to information presented by LG Display at the Information Display Society (IMID) in 2018, when two-stack layer technology is applied, the luminous efficiency increases by 1.5 to 2 times and the device lifespan by more than 4 times.However, the number of chambers required for the deposition line increases in that the red, green, and blue layers need to be doubled. It is estimated that about 100 chambers are usually required for one 6th generation line, but it is known that about 150 chambers are needed when investing in a two-stack method.An executive of a display equipment company said, “The initial investment planned by LG Display was to add 7,500 sheets to 15,000 sheets.

"Will Samsung Electronics start using LGD's OLED TV panels?According to an interesting report from Korea, Samsung Electronics is discussing a potential supply agreement with LG Display for WOLED TV panels. Samsung is aiming, according to the report, to buy 1 million OLED TV panels in 2021, and 4 million (around 50% of LGD's capacity!) in 2022.Back in 2013, SDC started to produce OLED TV panels, using an RGB architecture (similar to the company's mobile OLEDs). Samsung Electronics's first (and only) OLED TV was the S9C curved OLED TV that was released in 2013 - but Samsung never followed up with newer models and actually stopped OLED TV production and marketing.Samsung concentrated its efforts on its QD-enhanced LCD line (QLED, as the company confusingly calls these TVs). For its next generation panels, the company is looking for MicroLED technology, and a hybrid QD-OLED technology - which is entering production but is still not ready for mass production.As LCD prices are increasing, Samsung is under pressure to release high-end premium TVs to compete with OLEDs and other TVs - which is the main reason for the company's reported agreement with LGD. It could be that Samsung aims to fill the gap in the next 1-2 years until QD-OLED or MicroLED technology is commercialized.In past years Samsung has been actively criticizing LG's OLED TV technology (mostly concentrating on the burn-in problems). This deal, if it materialized, will be a (well deserved?) admission by Samsung that it made a serious mistake back in 2013 when it chose the wrong technology for its OLED TV production. And an admission that its major local rival, LG, has been right all along.Source: MTN"

"Apple confirms OLED adoption for iPads... Expected to invest in small and medium-sized OLEDsApple has confirmed the installation of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) in the iPad. The small and medium-sized OLED market is expected to enter the second growth period. Apple is the No. 1 company in the tablet market, and with the iPad OLED conversion, the small and medium-sized OLED market, which has grown centered on smartphones, has laid a new foothold for growth. Investment in small and medium-sized OLEDs, which has been suspended for a while, is expected to resume in earnest, so the vitalization of downstream industries such as materials, parts, and equipment (minister manager) is also drawing attention. According to the industry on the 31st, Apple decided to apply OLED instead of liquid crystal display (LCD) starting with some iPad models in 2022. Apple and display makers are known to have agreed to production and delivery.For iPad OLED, Samsung Display and LG Display are likely to supply it. The two companies are supplying OLEDs to Apple iPhones and have been developing OLEDs iPads. This is the first time that Apple introduces OLED to the iPad. Apple has been using LCDs for a while. It is interpreted that the decision to switch to OLED was decided when OLED surpasses LCD in terms of image quality, weight, and design due to technological development.Earlier, Apple also changed the iPhone from LCD to OLED. For iPhone, OLED was first applied to one model in 2017 and then expanded to all models. The iPad is also expected to be applied in earnest from 2023 after some models are installed next year.Apple's iPad OLED conversion is expected to stimulate the expansion and investment in the small and medium-sized OLED market. The iPad is the world's best-selling tablet. According to market research companies, about 50 million units are sold annually. Compared to the iPhone, which sells 200 million units every year, it seems small, but the display size of the iPad is 11 to 13 inches. Since medium-sized OLEDs that are 3 to 4 times larger than those for smartphones are applied, it is expected to result in expanding the small and medium-sized OLED market.Arithmetic, assuming 50 million iPads are all converted to OLED, there is a new demand equivalent to 150 million to 200 million iPhone OLEDs.Apple's iPad OLED application is expected to trigger investment in the display industry. As the demand for OLED panels increases as the size increases, facility investment to increase production is expected to occur. In fact, it was found that a specific company is establishing detailed investment plans.In order for display companies to mass-produce OLED panels in 2023, they need to have facilities next year, or investment, should start this year.Investment in small and medium-sized OLED expansion has disappeared in recent years due to the saturation of the smartphone market, but there are signs that it will resume with Apple's iPad, it is also expected to induce the revitalization of the display small business industry.Kim Ki-hyeon, director of Stone Partners said, ""Like Apple introduced OLED to all iPhone models, starting with iPhone X (ten), it is expected that iPad will also expand its installation after applying some models. Samsung Display and LG Display are the only places that can supply it, so domestic companies are expected to benefit.source: etnews reporter: Gun-il Yoon"
So LG hasn't been able to produce the displays Apple wants. They underestimated the power of China in their rapid spool up of their own brand. Display prices continue to fall. Profit is zero. Any comments about where LG is going in the near future?
"A report to clients from analysts at South Korea’s Shinhan Investment Corp sys that LG Display’s Chinese OLED production lines will increase output in 2021 to a forecast 71.7 percent increase year-over-year and to about 7.87 million units.The analysts say they expect to see a sharp rise in sales of high-margin panels used in 48-inch OLED TVs equipped with gaming Graphics Processing Units.POLEDs (Plastic substrate OLEDs) will also generate impressive growth. “POLED panel production should surge 86.7 per cent Y-o-Y to 51.67 million units in 2021 on the adoption of in-cell touch technology. We thus project OLED TV and POLED panel operations to break even on operating profit next year,” says Shinhan."
"LGD working hard on smartphone OLED… 1.6 trillion won attack investment in Vietnam factoryLG Display will invest more than 1.6 trillion won to expand the organic light emitting diode (OLED) module factory in Hai Phong industrial complex in Vietnam by 40%.According to Reuters and the Vietnamese government on the 31st, the Hai Phong City People's Committee approved LG Display's $1.4 billion (about 1.6 trillion won) investment plan. Through this investment, LG Display is expected to increase its factory facilities in Hai Phong Industrial Complex by 30-40% compared to the previous one. The People's Committee predicted that once LG Display completes the investment, the production of OLED modules at the Hai Phong plant, which was about 9-10 million units per month, will increase to 13 to 14 million units.LG Display's Haiphong plant is a base that makes modules by attaching various parts to OLED panels produced at the Paju and Gumi plants in Korea and the Guangzhou plants in China. It evenly assembles large OLED modules mounted on TVs and small and medium-sized OLED modules used in smartphones. The Hai Phong plant started construction in 2016 and started operation in 2017. If we add $1.4 billion to this time, LG Display's accumulated investment in Haiphong will increase to $4.6 billion. The company also invested 840 billion won in the Hai Phong plant in February.The OLED market is showing explosive growth regardless of large and small-sized panels. The global sales of large OLED panels exclusively produced by LG Display are expected to exceed 8 million units this year from 4.5 million units last year and 10 million units next year. Worldwide smartphone shipments using OLED displays will also exceed 500 million units this year, increasing by more than 30% compared to the previous year. In this regard, LG Display announced in mid-August that it would spend 3.3 trillion won to build a new production line for small and medium-sized 6th generation OLED panels in Paju.

An industry insider said, ""Most of the panel supply from LG Display's new Paju production base will be supplied to Apple.""Source: news.naver"

"LG Display reports stronger profit on iPhone demand, rising panel prices4:37am ET, 01/27/2021 - Reuters* LG Display reports highest quarterly profit since 2017* Panel shipments for Apple's iPhone rise in Q4* LCD panel prices increase on stay-at-home TV demand (Adds earnings call comment on domestic LCD business)By Joyce Lee and Heekyong YangSEOUL, Jan 27 (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Display Co Ltd reported its highest quarterly profit in over three years on Wednesday, with help from increased shipments of Apple Inc's new iPhones.The Apple supplier posted an operating profit of 685 billion won ($622 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with a loss of 422 billion won in the same period a year earlier.It was the display panel firm's highest quarterly profit since the second quarter of 2017, and soundly ahead of market expectations for a 286 billion won profit, according to a Refinitiv SmartEstimate derived from 12 analyst estimates.""As the global work-from-home situation continued in the fourth quarter, demand for TV and IT products remained strong,"" LG Display said in a statement.Shipments and prices of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels rose for both TVs and smartphones, while the strong earnings were helped by full-scale production at its Guangzhou OLED plant, the company said.Analysts highlighted increased shipments of OLED panels for Apple Inc's new iPhone 12 and higher prices for liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels. LCD prices rose on the back of growing demand for TVs from global consumers stuck at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Apple's iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter were likely up 21% on-year due to the strong performance of the iPhone 12, according to Counterpoint data.Stronger iPhone sales should spill over into LG Display's first quarter result, analysts said.""The first half of the year is usually a seasonal down-cycle, but this year is different. It will continue to swing to profit, as iPhone 12 sales are expected to increase panel shipments by 1.5 to two times the amount a year earlier,"" said Kim Kwang-jin, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea.LCD panel prices should also remain high in the first quarter, he said.LG Display, which had previously said it planed to halt domestic production of LCD TV panels by 2020, said in an earnings call on Wednesday that it will be flexible on domestic production based on market conditions this year.A power outage in Nippon Electric Glass' (NEG) Japan-based glass manufacturing facility in December may affect LG Display's first-quarter shipments, as about 80% of its glass came from NEG in the first half of 2020, analysts said.But the lower supply of large-sized glass could further lift panel prices in the first quarter, offsetting the impact of any fall in shipments, they added.Revenue rose 16% to 7.5 trillion won, LG Display said in a regulatory filing.Its shares fell 5% on Wednesday compared with a 0.6% drop in the wider market, which analysts put down to profit-taking. The stock has still gained some 63% since the start of November.($1 = 1,101.0000 won) (Reporting by Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang; Editing by Chris Reese, Richard Pullin and Kim Coghill)"

"LGD's new panels have new emitting materials and an additional ""layer"" to increase efficiency. Hopefully, one of the AV sites will find out what the new layer means.LG Display’s new 77-inch OLED display shows significant progress in picture quality through newly developed and highly efficient materials as well as the addition of a layer to the display, thereby improving its efficiency by around 20%. Higher efficiency means that the display improves its brightness to realize more vivid images."

"LG Electronics Decides to Release LG Rollable, LG Rainbow, and LG Q83 in the First Half of 2021Dec 14, 2020LG Electronics has decided on LG Rollable (tentative name), Rainbow, and LG Q83 to be part of the smartphone lineup for the first half of 2021. Its strategy is to take the leadership in next-generation smartphone form factors by becoming the first smartphone manufacturer to apply rollable display and also secure practical interests through premium and budget smartphones.In March of 2021, the company plans to release its flagship smartphone “LG Rainbow” in South Korea. It will also introduce LG Rollable and LG Q83, which is a budget smartphone, in the first half as well.“LG Rollable”, which will be the second product of the company’s Explorer Project, can be stretched out to 7.4 inches from 6.8 inches. Field tests by South Korean telecommunications companies will take place at the end of this month or early next month. LG Electronics will decide on the release date of “LG Rainbow” depending on results from field tests.Thinness and light weight are the main advantages of LG Rollable over foldable smartphones. LG Rollable also does not leave any wrinkle on the screen that has negative effect on immersive experience. One high-ranking official from a telecommunications company said on December 13 that both the feeling of holding LG Rollable and the product’s usability when the screen is stretched out feel better than that of foldable smartphones and that it is a plus that the product does not cause any wrinkle or deformation on the display.LG Rollable is an important product that will determine LG Electronics’ smartphone business’s fate in the future. Although a Chinese brand introduced a prototype for rollable smartphone before LG Electronics, LG Electronics is seen to be at the top when it comes to knowhow in production process and level of completion as it has been working on the technology for a long time.""LG Rainbow”, which is the first flagship smartphone for the company’s Universal Line and is based on a bar-type smartphone design, is a model designated to help the company’s market share. It is the successor to LG Velvet and succeeds the V series such as LG V50 ThinQ and it will carry on the company’s lineage of premium smartphones. It is reported that LG Rainbow provides high-performance specifications due to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 and is also based on LG Velvet’s design. It is also expected to create a new competition when it comes to the writing input field as it comes with Wacom’s AES (Active Electrostatic) stylus pen."

"LG Display dominance in auto display widens as mobility goes connectedSouth Korea?s LG Display Co. is cementing leadership in the fast growing automotive display market amid mobility shift into electric vehicles and autonomous cars.LG Display claimed a 25.9 percent share in the 10-inch or larger automotive display market by revenue in the first quarter, keeping to the top place for the 11th consecutive quarter, according to display market financial data tracker Omdia on Monday.In the automotive OLED display market, the company commanded the lion?s share of 91 percent.Global automotive OLED display shipments are estimated to balloon to $264 million in 2023 and $601 million in 2025 from $50 million last year, according to Omdia.LG Display chose the automotive display business as one of the future growth engines and focuses its investment and development.

"LG Display's OLED panel wins eye protection certificationBy YonhapPublished : Jan 5, 2021 - 13:48 Updated : Jan 5, 2021 - 13:48LG Display Co., the world's leading large size OLED panel maker, said Tuesday its organic light-emitting diode (OLED) TV panel has received an eye protection certification for low blue light emission.Its OLED display became the industry's first TV panel to win an accreditation from Eyesafe, a US-based eye protection certification agency, according to LG Display.Eyesafe developed standards for eye protection in cooperation with TUV Rheinland AG, a German technical test service and certification organization. It measures blue light, which can cause sore eyes and even sleep disorders when people are excessively exposed to it.The certification requirements state that the proportion of harmful blue light out of a product's total blue light emissions must be less than 50 percent.LG Display said its 65-inch OLED TV panel meets the standards with the portion of harmful blue light standing at only 34 percent, the lowest among TV panels and about half of that of liquid crystal display (LCD) TV panels.Unlike LCD, OLED does not require a backlight unit since it uses self-lighting pixels.LG Display said it plans to showcase OLED display solutions that highlight protection to users' eyes and health at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2021 that will be held online next week."
