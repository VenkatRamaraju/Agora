This is a head scratcher...should be a $20+ stock
"the only reason this isn't a $100 stock is because nobody on YouTube is talking about it. Every time I bring it up, I get ignored."
"LGD working hard on smartphone OLED… 1.6 trillion won attack investment in Vietnam factoryLG Display will invest more than 1.6 trillion won to expand the organic light emitting diode (OLED) module factory in Hai Phong industrial complex in Vietnam by 40%.According to Reuters and the Vietnamese government on the 31st, the Hai Phong City People's Committee approved LG Display's $1.4 billion (about 1.6 trillion won) investment plan. Through this investment, LG Display is expected to increase its factory facilities in Hai Phong Industrial Complex by 30-40% compared to the previous one. The People's Committee predicted that once LG Display completes the investment, the production of OLED modules at the Hai Phong plant, which was about 9-10 million units per month, will increase to 13 to 14 million units.LG Display's Haiphong plant is a base that makes modules by attaching various parts to OLED panels produced at the Paju and Gumi plants in Korea and the Guangzhou plants in China. It evenly assembles large OLED modules mounted on TVs and small and medium-sized OLED modules used in smartphones. The Hai Phong plant started construction in 2016 and started operation in 2017. If we add $1.4 billion to this time, LG Display's accumulated investment in Haiphong will increase to $4.6 billion. The company also invested 840 billion won in the Hai Phong plant in February.The OLED market is showing explosive growth regardless of large and small-sized panels. The global sales of large OLED panels exclusively produced by LG Display are expected to exceed 8 million units this year from 4.5 million units last year and 10 million units next year. Worldwide smartphone shipments using OLED displays will also exceed 500 million units this year, increasing by more than 30% compared to the previous year. In this regard, LG Display announced in mid-August that it would spend 3.3 trillion won to build a new production line for small and medium-sized 6th generation OLED panels in Paju. LG Display plans to double the production of OLED panels at the Paju plant, which is currently 30,000 sheets per month, to 60,000 sheets by starting the new facility in 2024.In the display industry, there are many observations that Apple has significantly increased the order quantity of OLED modules to be installed in flagship products such as new iPhones and iPads for LG Display. An industry insider said, ""Most of the panel supply from LG Display's new Paju production base will be supplied to Apple.""Source: news.naver"
$0.63/share.
"The report analyzed that LG Display also confirmed the investment in the 6G line in Paju to secure the OLED market for IT. The OLED TV market is rapidly expanding beyond imagination. In the first half of last year, shipments were 1.26 million units, but in the first half of this year, it is recording 3.4 million units. In the second half of the year, there is Black Friday, so shipments are expected to increase more than in the first half."
"LG Display invests 3.3 trillion won in small and medium-sized OLED... The reason for the increase in investment is 1.3 trillion wonThe existing 2 trillion won standard is calculated as LTPS type.This time, LTPO + two-stack layer technology will be used.LG Display will additionally invest in small and medium-sized OLED (organic light-emitting diode) production lines. This is a response to the recent increase in the use of OLED for IT displays such as laptops and tablet PCs.LG Display held a board meeting on the 13th and announced on the 17th that it has decided to invest 3.3 trillion won in the small and medium-sized OLED field. Currently, LG Display is producing small and medium-sized OLEDs at E5 in Gumi, Gyeongsangbuk-do and E6 in Paju, Gyeonggi-do. Currently, the E5 has a production capacity of 15,000 sheets per month based on the 6th generation (1500mm X 1850mm) raw plate input, and the E6 has a production capacity of 30,000 sheets. The additional investment to be made this time is estimated to be at the level of 15,000 sheets per month. Considering that it usually takes 2 trillion won to invest 15,000 sheets of 6th generation OLED, the investment is about 1.3 trillion won, which is larger. This is because the calculation of the existing 2 trillion won investment is based on the selection of LTPS (Low Temperature Polysilicon) as TFT (Thin Film Transistor), which is the switch of the display. This time, LG Display's investment is expected to include LTPO (Low Temperature Polysilicon Oxide) technology and integrated touch screen technology as all the latest construction methods are mobilized. Since both LTPO and all-in-one touch screen technologies use photo processes, the amount of equipment required for deposition (CVD), exposure, and etching is also increased. In addition, the evaporation line, which accounts for 30-40% of the investment, is also expected to be equipped with a 'two-stack layer'. Two-stack layer refers to a technology that stacks two sub-pixel layers that emit red, green, and blue light in OLED. If two red, green, and blue layers overlap each other, bright light can be emitted without passing a large current to each layer. It's like using two lights at the right brightness for a longer period of time than using one light at full brightness. By reducing the load applied to each subpixel, the device lifespan is increased.This is an essential technology for IT OLED panels that are vulnerable to pixel burn-in and have a long replacement cycle. According to information presented by LG Display at the Information Display Society (IMID) in 2018, when two-stack layer technology is applied, the luminous efficiency increases by 1.5 to 2 times and the device lifespan by more than 4 times.However, the number of chambers required for the deposition line increases in that the red, green, and blue layers need to be doubled. It is estimated that about 100 chambers are usually required for one 6th generation line, but it is known that about 150 chambers are needed when investing in a two-stack method.An executive of a display equipment company said, “The initial investment planned by LG Display was to add 7,500 sheets to 15,000 sheets.

"Samsung Dislpay, LG Display, Magnachip Semiconductor, are all in front of a tremendous demand for OLED displays, as from $AAPL to $NTDOY, all tech leaders are going to fully adopt OLED. This is not an estimate or speculation, these are the news and the announced plans. The only problem these companies are facing is the well known shortage...But always these shortages ease and the revenues of the aforementioned company will be boosted. The Chinese peers of the U.S. techs know this, that is why the Chinese try to acquire Magnachip even with a 100% premium. The U.S. authorities try to stop them from buying Magnachip, but if the company close its U.S. offices, then they can't do that."
Go baby go!!
"By: Kim Hyun-binLG Display expects to see OLED TV sales increase further despite a contraction in the mainstream TV market.""Demand for OLED panels showed 90 percent growth year-on-year despite lower demand in the TV sector,"" an LG Display official said during the company's conference after the release of third quarter earnings, Wednesday.The recent production capacity increase at LG Display's Guangzhou OLED plant helped sales increase.""With the a capacity addition of 30 thousand panels at the Gangzhou plant that started operation in Q3, we will increase OLED production to 10 million a year and further drive growth in the OLED business,"" the LG Display official said,LG Display saw third-quarter sales increase 7 percent year-on-year to 7.22 trillion won, while operating profit surged 222 percent to 528.9 billion won.The huge increase in operating profit was lower than expected. Analysts initially predicted an 800 billion won operating profit for the third quarter, but slashed the estimate to around 600 billion won after LCD TV panel prices continued to drop starting in July. Since last year, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused LCD panel prices to double.""Operating profit was hit by LCD TV panel price declines and other component supply issues,"" LG Display said.According to market research firm Witsview, the average price of 32-inch LCD panels in the second half of September dropped 18.8 percent to $56 compared to the first half of September and fell 9.7 percent compared to the second quarter.Screens of other sizes also saw a drop in prices with 43-inch LCD panels dropping 10.5 percent to $111, while 55-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch panel prices fell 8 percent, 6.8 percent and 5.1 percent to $195, $260 and $373, respectively.The company expects LCD panel prices to continue to drop in the fourth quarter. But the decline will be offset by an increase in OLED sales that quarter."
"LG Display to supply 'Cadillac EV' POLED... GM Trade ExpansionLG Display's automotive display business is cruising. The first electric vehicle (EV) of Cadillac, a premium brand of General Motors (GM) in the US, will also be equipped with plastic organic light emitting diodes (POLEDs).According to the industry on the 24th, LG Display is planning to supply 33-inch POLEDs to the Cadillac EV ‘Lyric’.Previously, LG Display supplied 38-inch POLEDs to Cadillac’s large sports utility vehicle (SUV) ‘Escalade’. The central instrument cluster consists of 14-inch, 7-inch and 17-inch panels.The electric SUV Lyric was unveiled last April. It is based on GM's modular electric vehicle platform Ultium Powertrain. There are 12 modules. It will be equipped with nickel, cobalt, manganese, aluminum (NCMA) batteries produced by Ultium Cells, a joint venture between GM and LG Energy Solutions (JV). The battery has a capacity of 100 kilowatt-hours (kWh) and a driving range of 300 miles (about 483 km) when fully charged.In the case of Lyric, the market response is so positive that all of the prepared volumes were signed within 10 minutes of starting the pre-order on the 18th (local time).GM plans to begin production of lyric at its Tennessee plant in the US in the first quarter of next year. Shipping is expected to begin in the first half of the year. LG Display is also expected to provide POLEDs on schedule.LG Display is a strong player in the automotive display field. According to market research firm Omdia, LG Display accounted for 25.9% (based on sales) in the market share of high-value-added displays for vehicles over 10 inches in the first quarter. 1 in the industry for 11 consecutive quarters. If it is limited to OLED for electric use, it is a de facto monopoly system with more than 90%.The secret is to dominate the market. In the process of expanding the business area from large OLEDs to small and medium-sized OLEDs, they started targeting the battlefield, which was a blue ocean. Due to the nature of the auto industry, which requires high reliability, it does not change partners well. This is a favorable condition for LG Display, which has dominated the market. This means that there is a high possibility that the transaction will continue with major customers such as GM, BMW, and Benz.Until now, POLED has been used only for premium cars, and most of them have been applied to LCD. POLED has the advantage of being light and having high power efficiency. As it is self-luminous, it is advantageous in terms of visibility (easy identification). The use of POLED in EVs and autonomous vehicles is expected to increase in the future. This Lyric contract is the result of the same thing.An official from the display industry said, “The size of the automotive display market has already grown to a level that is not small at more than 10 trillion won. As it has high growth potential in the future, it will have a positive impact on LG Display’s performance.”Meanwhile, the alliance between LG Group and GM is expanding. Focusing on the battery JV, ?LG Magna (powertrain) ?LG Display (POLED), LG Innotek (converter), etc. are increasing their transactions with GM.Source: ddaily"
"Samsung Disply stops Apple iPad OLED development… LGD to expand supply to Apple?It is known that the development of an organic light-emitting diode (OLED)-applied iPad that Samsung Display and Apple have been working on has failed. It is analyzed that the reason for the suspension of development is the disagreement over the method of applying the OLED structure. There are also observations that LG Display, which has recently invested in small and medium-sized OLEDs, will enter Apple's supply chain faster.According to IT media and industries such as Sam Mobile on the 30th, Samsung Display and Apple's 10.86-inch OLED iPad development project has recently been suspended. Apple has requested related development from Samsung Display and LG Display to apply OLED to the iPad to be released in 2022 at the end of last year.Apple and Samsung Display seem to have continued to disagree over OLED panel technology to be applied to the iPad. Apple has requested the application of '2 Stack Tandem' OLED panel technology from suppliers such as Samsung Display. In the two-stack method, the light emitting layers of the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) elements are applied in two layers, so that the brightness can be doubled and the panel lifespan can be increased by 4 times or more compared to the conventional method.Samsung Display is known to have proposed applying the single stack structure used in the existing mobile OLED production to the iPad. It is analyzed that the cost burden of changing the manufacturing line for a two-stack structure is the cause. According to the industry, Samsung Display There is no case in which a display has delivered a product by applying a two-stack structure, but technically, mass production through a two-stack implementation is not expected to be difficult.There is also a possibility that LG Display and other companies will advance into Apple's supply chain. According to what was initially known to the industry, it was expected that Samsung Display would first supply iPad OLED next year, and LG Display would start supplying iPad OLED panel with the goal of 2023.In particular, although LG Display's IT device OLED panel production capacity is still limited, the fact that it has experience mass-producing the two-stack OLED panel required by Apple for vehicles is also considered a variable.The possibility of Apple seeking to diversify its small and medium-sized OLED supply chain with the iPad OLED supply as an opportunity is also being raised steadily. According to Omdia, Samsung Display is expected to supply 65% ??of Apple's small and medium-sized OLED shipments this year. Although LG Display's market share is around 30%, it is making related investments, such as expanding small and medium-sized OLED facilities assuming the delivery of iPhones and iPads. In fact, last month, LG Display also announced an investment decision worth 3.3 trillion won to expand small and medium-sized OLED production facilities.An industry official said, “In the case of LG Display, it is expanding its investment in the production of medium-sized OLED panels such as iPads. In this case, the integration of LG Display, which has experience in two-stack mass production, into the supply chain can be accelerated.""Source: viva100"
