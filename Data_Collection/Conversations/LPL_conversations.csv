"I told you guys 3 days ago to load up on LPL due to apple oled supplier, news is out: AppleInsider: LG Display secures orders to supply OLED and LCD screens for 2018 iPhones.https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/07/13/lg-display-secures-orders-to-supply-oled-and-lcd-screens-for-2018-iphonesand if you are wondering why the price haven't moved, it's because the PPS is kept down for institution to accumulate so they can sell it to the retail at much higher price, say $30/share a year from now"
I see value in the stock I don't think they're going to go bankrupt. but there's definitely value and it's been beat up by the market.
After November 16th this will break out. That’s my opinion.
"LGD surpasses OLED sales LCD for the first time… First fruit in 7 years of mass productionReporter Lee Jung-hyuk2020.12.18. 05:30 MoneyToday LGD surpasses OLED sales LCD for the first time… First fruit in 7 years of mass production LG Display surpassed LCD (liquid crystal display) sales for the first time in 7 years after starting mass production of large OLED (organic light emitting diode) panels. As the Guangzhou plant in China is fully operational and global premium TV demand increases in the aftermath of COVID-19, the'OLED trend' is expected to accelerate.LGD, 3Q OLED sales 54%… Leading to surpass 60% next yearAccording to market researcher Omdia on the 17th, LG Display's large OLED panel sales share in the third quarter of this year was 53.9%, exceeding 43.1% of LCD. This is the first time since OLED mass production at the Paju plant started in 2013.The percentage of total panel sales this year is also expected to record 53.4% ??for OLED and 46.6% for LCD. This is the effect that the Guangzhou plant with a capacity of 60,000 sheets per month started operating in earnest from July. The proportion of large OLED sales next year is expected to exceed '60%' from 57.1% in 1Q to 57.2% in 2Q and 61.6% in 3Q. During the same period, the proportion of LCDs is expected to drop to 42.9%, 42.8%, and 38.4%."
Nice to see some of that 3 billion in cash being put to good use in creating more revenue. Their productivity will more than double. We may not even need the Apple deal for this baby to recover.Be nice though.
"the only reason this isn't a $100 stock is because nobody on YouTube is talking about it. Every time I bring it up, I get ignored."
How do Americans buy stock in LG Electronics?
Is lg good to buy?
There have been a few supports around $8 since 2004. With the Apple deal this is a strong buy in my book.
"Ubank Mobile App And LG Agree On A Pre-Installation DealLG and Ubank have come to an agreement. New LG’s mobile phones will in the future come with Ubank’s mobile payment app already pre-installed. Initially, the project will kick off in the South Korean market which is where the LG electronics firm is located. Later they will expand the project to other markets slowly. Samsung already sells smartphones that have the Ubank application inbuilt in about 10 different countries. Fly is also another smartphone manufacturer whose phones come inbuilt with the Ubank mobile payment app. In addition to being capable of making payments, the pre-installed app on LG smartphones will also have the Ubcoin market. It is a blockchain technology system that resembles the one by eBay. It will allow users to buy goods using digital coins.

"Samsung, LGD ramping up OLED panels for small- to medium-size applications, Digitimes Research saysChiawen Chang, DIGITIMES Research, TaipeiFriday 18 December 2020Combined sales of OLED panels by Samsung Display and LG Display (LGD) for small- to medium-size applications are expected to reach KRW9.6 trillion (US$9.4 billion) in the fourth quarter of 2020, up 46.2% sequentially and 31.2% on year, according to an estimate by Digitimes Research.The optimistic prospects come after both firms experienced increased revenues and shipments for small- to medium-size OLED panels in the previous quarter, driven by growing demand from the smartphone and wearable sectors.Demand for OLED panels from the smartphone sector has rebounded as the pandemic-induced impacts on the handset supply chain have eased, while the launch of Apple's all OLED iPhone 12 lineup has encouraged other handset brands to also adopt OLED panels for their mid-range to high-end models, Digitimes Research said.In 2021, OLED-based models are expected to account for 40% of global smartphone shipments, said Digitimes Research. Besides, demand for OLED panels for Apple Watch devices is likely to double in the coming year.To cash in on increasing demand, both LGD and Japan Display (JDI) have accelerated their expansion projects for ramping up OLED panels."
"The report analyzed that LG Display also confirmed the investment in the 6G line in Paju to secure the OLED market for IT. The OLED TV market is rapidly expanding beyond imagination. In the first half of last year, shipments were 1.26 million units, but in the first half of this year, it is recording 3.4 million units. In the second half of the year, there is Black Friday, so shipments are expected to increase more than in the first half."
"Got my new LG 83 inch OLED delivered Wednesday, WOW. Bought more stock on the dip and I thinkLPL was my only positive stock today. Get yourself one, buy stock and get your money back, that’s the ticket.Happy InvestingJohn"
Ever since Apple said they were changing from LCD/OLED screens on Iphones stock has taken a beating. money flow has weakened and investors moving elsewhere.
why is this at P/E 5.6?
This thing is an absolute steal as this level .. it will be up 1-1.5 this week or next
LG Display is up 7.78% to 10.80
This a joke LG display at $7 it has not hit this low in over 5 years! I bought more today as I am in the Audio/Video business and LG OLED TV's are growing in popularity. OLED is the future and will be a standard for flat panels/ mobile phones / auto displays. You need to have patience here this is a great opportunity to buy in or add. I have been buying on all the dips as it has been taking beating this year.

Now we just need the official announcement...which will be after all the insiders buy their shares
"By: Kim Hyun-binLG Display expects to see OLED TV sales increase further despite a contraction in the mainstream TV market.""Demand for OLED panels showed 90 percent growth year-on-year despite lower demand in the TV sector,"" an LG Display official said during the company's conference after the release of third quarter earnings, Wednesday.The recent production capacity increase at LG Display's Guangzhou OLED plant helped sales increase.""With the a capacity addition of 30 thousand panels at the Gangzhou plant that started operation in Q3, we will increase OLED production to 10 million a year and further drive growth in the OLED business,"" the LG Display official said,LG Display saw third-quarter sales increase 7 percent year-on-year to 7.22 trillion won, while operating profit surged 222 percent to 528.9 billion won.The huge increase in operating profit was lower than expected. Analysts initially predicted an 800 billion won operating profit for the third quarter, but slashed the estimate to around 600 billion won after LCD TV panel prices continued to drop starting in July. Since last year, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused LCD panel prices to double.""Operating profit was hit by LCD TV panel price declines and other component supply issues,"" LG Display said.According to market research firm Witsview, the average price of 32-inch LCD panels in the second half of September dropped 18.8 percent to $56 compared to the first half of September and fell 9.7 percent compared to the second quarter.Screens of other sizes also saw a drop in prices with 43-inch LCD panels dropping 10.5 percent to $111, while 55-inch, 65-inch and 75-inch panel prices fell 8 percent, 6.8 percent and 5.1 percent to $195, $260 and $373, respectively.The company expects LCD panel prices to continue to drop in the fourth quarter. But the decline will be offset by an increase in OLED sales that quarter."

"Samsung Disply stops Apple iPad OLED development… LGD to expand supply to Apple?It is known that the development of an organic light-emitting diode (OLED)-applied iPad that Samsung Display and Apple have been working on has failed. It is analyzed that the reason for the suspension of development is the disagreement over the method of applying the OLED structure. There are also observations that LG Display, which has recently invested in small and medium-sized OLEDs, will enter Apple's supply chain faster.According to IT media and industries such as Sam Mobile on the 30th, Samsung Display and Apple's 10.86-inch OLED iPad development project has recently been suspended. Apple has requested related development from Samsung Display and LG Display to apply OLED to the iPad to be released in 2022 at the end of last year.Apple and Samsung Display seem to have continued to disagree over OLED panel technology to be applied to the iPad. Apple has requested the application of '2 Stack Tandem' OLED panel technology from suppliers such as Samsung Display. In the two-stack method, the light emitting layers of the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) elements are applied in two layers, so that the brightness can be doubled and the panel lifespan can be increased by 4 times or more compared to the conventional method.Samsung Display is known to have proposed applying the single stack structure used in the existing mobile OLED production to the iPad. It is analyzed that the cost burden of changing the manufacturing line for a two-stack structure is the cause. According to the industry, Samsung Display There is no case in which a display has delivered a product by applying a two-stack structure, but technically, mass production through a two-stack implementation is not expected to be difficult.There is also a possibility that LG Display and other companies will advance into Apple's supply chain. According to what was initially known to the industry, it was expected that Samsung Display would first supply iPad OLED next year, and LG Display would start supplying iPad OLED panel with the goal of 2023.In particular, although LG Display's IT device OLED panel production capacity is still limited, the fact that it has experience mass-producing the two-stack OLED panel required by Apple for vehicles is also considered a variable.The possibility of Apple seeking to diversify its small and medium-sized OLED supply chain with the iPad OLED supply as an opportunity is also being raised steadily. According to Omdia, Samsung Display is expected to supply 65% ??of Apple's small and medium-sized OLED shipments this year. Although LG Display's market share is around 30%, it is making related investments, such as expanding small and medium-sized OLED facilities assuming the delivery of iPhones and iPads. In fact, last month, LG Display also announced an investment decision worth 3.3 trillion won to expand small and medium-sized OLED production facilities.An industry official said, “In the case of LG Display, it is expanding its investment in the production of medium-sized OLED panels such as iPads. In this case, the integration of LG Display, which has experience in two-stack mass production, into the supply chain can be accelerated.""Source: viva100"

"LG Display reports solid Q1 2021 results, will decide on OLED TV capacity expansion by Q3 2021LG Display announced its financial results for Q1 2021. The company reported sales of $6.2 billion, an operating income of $469.5 million and net profit of $238 million. Sales were lower (by 8%) compared to Q4 2020, but higher by 46% from Q4 2020. LGD remained profitable for the third consecutive quarter.LGD reported strong OLED TV sales, despite the seasonality - 1.6 million OLED TV panels shipped in the quarter, similar to Q4 2020 (which represents a peak season). LGD is on track to ship 8 million OLED TV panels in 2021. Mobile OLED panel shipments were lower than Q4 2020.LGD says that its current view on the OLED TV market is positive, but it is not ready yet to commit to capacity expansion. LGD's management says that in Q2 or Q3 2021 it will likely to make a decision whether to increase capacity or not. For mobile OLEDs, its current plan is to maximize its productivity from its existing capacity (30,000 monthly substrates in its Paju fab, and 15,000 in Kumi). It has no immediate plans to expand mobile OLED production.An interesting remark was made on the IT market. LGD sees OLED adoption increasing - in laptops and monitors. It is looking at the market, and plans to enter this market in the future, when it has technological advantages over other companies.Source: oled-info"

"LG Display Co. is struggling to make profits this year with its focus on expanding its OLED business, its chief said Tuesday.The panel maker posted an operating loss of 29.1 billion won ($25 million) in 2020, sharply narrowing from a loss of 714.5 billion won a year earlier, while sales increased 3.2 percent on-year to 24.23 trillion won, apparently benefiting from increased demand for displays amid the pandemic-induced trends of remote working and distance learning.""This year, we will achieve complete normalization of our business and make a great leap forward,"" Jeong Ho-young said in a shareholders meeting.To achieve its goal, Jeong said the company will bolster its OLED business. LG Display is the world's largest supplier of large-size OLED panels.""With expanded OLED product lineup and customer base, we will concentrate to expand our market share and enhance profitability,"" he said. ""In addition to TVs, we will actively explore areas that need our products.""Jeong said LG Display will also seek strategic partnerships with others, adding that the company is looking for a ""radical change"" for sustainable growth.""We will reinforce our partnerships with our existing partners and cooperate with those in other industry sectors to better develop our business and system,"" he said.

"Apple confirms OLED adoption for iPads... Expected to invest in small and medium-sized OLEDsApple has confirmed the installation of organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) in the iPad. The small and medium-sized OLED market is expected to enter the second growth period. Apple is the No. 1 company in the tablet market, and with the iPad OLED conversion, the small and medium-sized OLED market, which has grown centered on smartphones, has laid a new foothold for growth. Investment in small and medium-sized OLEDs, which has been suspended for a while, is expected to resume in earnest, so the vitalization of downstream industries such as materials, parts, and equipment (minister manager) is also drawing attention. According to the industry on the 31st, Apple decided to apply OLED instead of liquid crystal display (LCD) starting with some iPad models in 2022. Apple and display makers are known to have agreed to production and delivery.For iPad OLED, Samsung Display and LG Display are likely to supply it. The two companies are supplying OLEDs to Apple iPhones and have been developing OLEDs iPads. This is the first time that Apple introduces OLED to the iPad. Apple has been using LCDs for a while. It is interpreted that the decision to switch to OLED was decided when OLED surpasses LCD in terms of image quality, weight, and design due to technological development.Earlier, Apple also changed the iPhone from LCD to OLED. For iPhone, OLED was first applied to one model in 2017 and then expanded to all models. The iPad is also expected to be applied in earnest from 2023 after some models are installed next year.Apple's iPad OLED conversion is expected to stimulate the expansion and investment in the small and medium-sized OLED market. The iPad is the world's best-selling tablet. According to market research companies, about 50 million units are sold annually. Compared to the iPhone, which sells 200 million units every year, it seems small, but the display size of the iPad is 11 to 13 inches. Since medium-sized OLEDs that are 3 to 4 times larger than those for smartphones are applied, it is expected to result in expanding the small and medium-sized OLED market.Arithmetic, assuming 50 million iPads are all converted to OLED, there is a new demand equivalent to 150 million to 200 million iPhone OLEDs.Apple's iPad OLED application is expected to trigger investment in the display industry. As the demand for OLED panels increases as the size increases, facility investment to increase production is expected to occur. In fact, it was found that a specific company is establishing detailed investment plans.In order for display companies to mass-produce OLED panels in 2023, they need to have facilities next year, or investment, should start this year.Investment in small and medium-sized OLED expansion has disappeared in recent years due to the saturation of the smartphone market, but there are signs that it will resume with Apple's iPad, it is also expected to induce the revitalization of the display small business industry.Kim Ki-hyeon, director of Stone Partners said, ""Like Apple introduced OLED to all iPhone models, starting with iPhone X (ten), it is expected that iPad will also expand its installation after applying some models. Samsung Display and LG Display are the only places that can supply it, so domestic companies are expected to benefit.source: etnews reporter: Gun-il Yoon"
"Omdia: 3,000 rollable TVs to ship in 2022 and 672,000 in 2027As LG Electronics is launching its 65"" rollable TV (65RX OLED) globally, market researchers from Omdia estimate that shipments of rollable TVs will be around 3,000 next year. The market will grow to 74,000 units in 2024 and 672,000 units in 2027.This is fast growth, but numbers will still be very limited, it seems as Omdia does not expect mass market adoption for rollable TVs.The first hurdle that LG will have to overcome is the price - currently the 65"" model costs £99,999 in the UK - or around $137,000. The price in Korea is around $87,000."

"whats the deal here, why the slow decline over the past couple weeks?"
First time in China OLED price hike in many years. This is just a sign that factories can't keep up with the demand. Yesterday Chinese Electronic Manufacturer Association released a report indicating the price in large screen fabrication has increased over 12% in sales side. They are expecting 2-3% more increase this month. It is a good sign for the supply side because the OLED price has been going down in past few years with the added capacity as well more mature technology. Now the price trend is completely reversed first time in several years. This price hike trend will definitely translate to profit increase in the next quarter report and thereafter. Time to buy and hold now! LPL finally will take off!

Great Earnings report everyone.Operating profit expectation was 79 Billion won expecting a loss of 7 cents.....Actual was 140 Billion won with a PROFIT of 123 million US $. Reuters trying to downplay the #s though.....have to be a big day tomorrow
I have to believe yesterday was the bottom. Rumors of Apple using LG for their screens was enough to make the bleeding stop.Now we need the actual contract announcement to move us forward. This just became a huge buying opportunity and a dream investment for the pros. LG has half its market cap in cash and they make 4X their market cap in Revenues. As a plus they also pay a decent dividend....what's not to love?I just jumped into the cold pool but the heater just kicked in.
Makes no sense!! Down 6% for what?

"LG Display reports stronger profit on iPhone demand, rising panel prices4:37am ET, 01/27/2021 - Reuters* LG Display reports highest quarterly profit since 2017* Panel shipments for Apple's iPhone rise in Q4* LCD panel prices increase on stay-at-home TV demand (Adds earnings call comment on domestic LCD business)By Joyce Lee and Heekyong YangSEOUL, Jan 27 (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Display Co Ltd reported its highest quarterly profit in over three years on Wednesday, with help from increased shipments of Apple Inc's new iPhones.The Apple supplier posted an operating profit of 685 billion won ($622 million) in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with a loss of 422 billion won in the same period a year earlier.It was the display panel firm's highest quarterly profit since the second quarter of 2017, and soundly ahead of market expectations for a 286 billion won profit, according to a Refinitiv SmartEstimate derived from 12 analyst estimates.""As the global work-from-home situation continued in the fourth quarter, demand for TV and IT products remained strong,"" LG Display said in a statement.Shipments and prices of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels rose for both TVs and smartphones, while the strong earnings were helped by full-scale production at its Guangzhou OLED plant, the company said.Analysts highlighted increased shipments of OLED panels for Apple Inc's new iPhone 12 and higher prices for liquid-crystal display (LCD) panels. LCD prices rose on the back of growing demand for TVs from global consumers stuck at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Apple's iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter were likely up 21% on-year due to the strong performance of the iPhone 12, according to Counterpoint data.Stronger iPhone sales should spill over into LG Display's first quarter result, analysts said.""The first half of the year is usually a seasonal down-cycle, but this year is different. It will continue to swing to profit, as iPhone 12 sales are expected to increase panel shipments by 1.5 to two times the amount a year earlier,"" said Kim Kwang-jin, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea.LCD panel prices should also remain high in the first quarter, he said.LG Display, which had previously said it planed to halt domestic production of LCD TV panels by 2020, said in an earnings call on Wednesday that it will be flexible on domestic production based on market conditions this year.A power outage in Nippon Electric Glass' (NEG) Japan-based glass manufacturing facility in December may affect LG Display's first-quarter shipments, as about 80% of its glass came from NEG in the first half of 2020, analysts said.But the lower supply of large-sized glass could further lift panel prices in the first quarter, offsetting the impact of any fall in shipments, they added.Revenue rose 16% to 7.5 trillion won, LG Display said in a regulatory filing.Its shares fell 5% on Wednesday compared with a 0.6% drop in the wider market, which analysts put down to profit-taking. The stock has still gained some 63% since the start of November.($1 = 1,101.0000 won) (Reporting by Joyce Lee and Heekyong Yang; Editing by Chris Reese, Richard Pullin and Kim Coghill)"

"Might see a bit of upside tomorrow given that LG was discovered to supply the Pixel 3’s display, which had stunning reviews. It appears they are at a level where they can compete with Samsung display, which is very encouraging news."
This stock is way undervalued. For those with bucks and guts this one I would recommend to accumulate and wait for the break out.
"Huge volume, hopefully the beginnings of a short squeeze."
We will see a big jump in LPL shortly . I absolutely love the displays. I recently purchased an LG V30 to play around with at home and compare to my iPhone and other androids . Nothing compared to that screen. I’m so happy I finally bought the device for myself and made my own judgement on the product. Now that LCDs are cut . Wait and see what’s in store .... good luck to all the shareholders
$0.63/share.
LG main focus moving forward will be towards OLED panels for both mobile phones and televisions etc. Theae articles are very misleading for the investors and should be cleared up. The overstock and increased competition in LCD panels were already priced in the to stock and was the reason LG stock was down almost 40 percent for the year. They are planting their seeds correctly and should be profitable again by the end of the year.
You dont build a NEW Oled factory in China if you're not planning to fill orders.Tomorrow will begin our journey back to $16 for mid year 2019
Apple will give all their business to LG once LG gets rolling with the small OLED screens. Apple does not want to continue giving the business so they’re competitor Samsung . Also for people who don’t know LG supplies all the panels to Sony whether it’s LED or OLED. So the next time you buy Sony you’re actually buying an LG panel with Sony processors .
"LG Display expands OLED facilities in Vietnam... 830 billion additional investmentFirst Entry 2021-02-08 11:36:59BigsmallIt is reported that LG Display has decided to significantly expand organic light-emitting diode (OLED) facilities by investing an additional KRW 830 billion in a module assembly plant in Hai Phong city in northern Vietnam.According to local media such as Vietnam News Agency (VNA) on the 8th, Hai Phong City granted an additional investment of $750 million (about 838.8 billion won) to LG Display the day before.As a result, LG Display's total investment in Vietnam will increase to 3.25 billion dollars (about 3.63 trillion won).It is known that LG Display will significantly expand its OLED production facilities in its existing module assembly plant as early as next month.In addition, it is reported that it will select an additional 5,000 local employees by next year.A local source said, ""I know that LG Display has decided to expand production facilities in its existing factory, seeing that the OLED display market will grow."""
"LCD pulls forward and OLED pushes back... LG Display forecasts sales of 7 trillion won in the first quarterLG Display's sales in the first quarter of this year are expected to exceed 7 trillion won. The rise in liquid crystal display (LCD) panel prices and strong organic light-emitting diode (OLED) sales are considered to be the reasons for the strong performance.According to the securities industry on the 22nd, Shinhan Investment Corp. expected LG Display's sales in the first quarter of this year to KRW 7.2 trillion. This is a 48.2% increase from 4.72 trillion won in the first quarter of last year. Kiwoom Securities and Mirae Asset Daewoo also predicted that LG Display will generate sales of 7.34 trillion won and 7.34 trillion won, respectively, in the first quarter of this year.In 2015, LG Display's first quarter sales exceeded 7 trillion won is the only one. At the time, LG Display recorded sales of 7,223 trillion won thanks to the strong sales of large LCDs used in TVs. As expected in the first quarter of this year, if LG Display achieves KRW 7 trillion in sales, it will record KRW 7 trillion in sales in the first quarter after six years. In the first quater of 2015 LPL was trading above $12 per share.The dominant evaluation is that the increase in the price of LCD panels for TVs has driven sales growth. According to market researcher Omdia, the price of 32-65-inch LCD panels rose 4-5% last month compared to the previous month. The 55-inch 4K LCD panel with the most shipments last month's price was $191 (about 218,000 won), up 73% from $110 in March last year. The 65-inch 4K LCD panel price also jumped 42% from 170 dollars (about 194,000 won) to 242 dollars (about 276,000 won) during the same period."

"LGD to supply OLED panels to Samsung Electronics... first transactionSamsung Electronics decided to supply OLED from LG Display. As LCD prices, which have surpassed the dominance of Chinese companies, surge, they are jumping into the premium product line OLED TV to secure profitability. This is the first time that Samsung Electronics has been supplied with OLED panels from LG. Reporter Park Ji-eun reports exclusively."
LG has signed a deal with Apple to supply both LCD and OLED panels for Apples 2018 range of iPhones. The contract will see LG ship around 20 million LCD smartphone panels to Apple and 3-4 million OLED panels.
That new factory will be put to good use: https://www.phonearena.com/news/LG-foldable-phone-display_id107327
We all played and lost. I can't see the way to go up again.
"LG Display is a supplier of all luxury car brands. The 2020 Q3, Q4 sales were increased. And I heard they signed up with many automotive companies to supply large-size display P-OLED. You can buy LG Display from the Korean market and Nasdaq. Who are the customers of LG Display? VW group(VW, Audi, Porsche etc.), Daimler Group(Mercedes Benz, Ferrari), Tesla, Honda, BMW ^^ Today LG Display is the lowest price from today. Don't focus on TV, if you are a real investor. Automotive would be the main market from 2020.Just imagine how many cars are manufactured every year and how LED panel in the CAR (minimum 2 ~ luxury line car has 4~5 panel)This is my youtube channel, you can get some information. You didn't know.^^https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0lMxsO2owtkJ315LbvvfvQ"
"Their Q3 earnings transcript says that they estimate 4.2M-4.5M OLED TV panels for 2020, and 7M-8M OLED TV panels for 2021. That's an increase of 3.25M OLED panels for 2021. If you apply an average cost of $700 per panel to manufacture, this would equate to an $2.3B of additional revenue. I don't see this increase in the analyst estimate, and I don't believe it has already been factored into the current share price. If I factor in these numbers, I can conservatively see the increase in share price of $3-$4 per share. I hope a nice pop will happen soon."
"LG Display to supply more OLED panels to Apple for iPhones this yearByJeetApple has started using OLED display panels for the entire smartphone lineup with the iPhone 12 series and is expected to continue doing so with the upcoming iPhone 13 series. A report from Omdia claims that around 169 million units of iPhone OLED panels will be shipped this year.In comparison, the expected shipments are 47.6 percent higher than the 114.5 million units shipped last year. It is said that LG Display will be shipping more units of OLED panels this year to Apple.The Omdia report estimates that Samsung Display will be shipping 110 million units of OLED panels for iPhone while LG Display will be shipping 50 million units and BOE will be shipping 9 million units.Last year, Samsung Display had shipped 89.6 million units while LG Display had shipped 25 million units. When compared year-on-year, shipments from these companies increased 22.8 percent and 100 percent respectively.In the year 2020, the market share of Samsung Display for iPhone OLED panels was 78.3 percent, which will drop to 65.1 percent this year, if the new estimates from Omdia turn out to be true. On the other hand, the share of LG Display will increase from 21.8 percent to 29.6 percent while China-based BOE‘s share will be 5.3 percent.Based on the estimates, Apple will be the largest procure of smartphone OLED panels this year, followed by Samsung Electronics and Xiaomi.As per the report, 584.5 million units of OLED panels are expected to get shipped this year, representing an increase of 28 percent compared to 2020. Out of them, around 335.5 million units will account for Flexible OLED panels while rigid OLED panels will make up to 249 million units"

"Will Samsung Electronics start using LGD's OLED TV panels?According to an interesting report from Korea, Samsung Electronics is discussing a potential supply agreement with LG Display for WOLED TV panels. Samsung is aiming, according to the report, to buy 1 million OLED TV panels in 2021, and 4 million (around 50% of LGD's capacity!) in 2022.Back in 2013, SDC started to produce OLED TV panels, using an RGB architecture (similar to the company's mobile OLEDs). Samsung Electronics's first (and only) OLED TV was the S9C curved OLED TV that was released in 2013 - but Samsung never followed up with newer models and actually stopped OLED TV production and marketing.Samsung concentrated its efforts on its QD-enhanced LCD line (QLED, as the company confusingly calls these TVs). For its next generation panels, the company is looking for MicroLED technology, and a hybrid QD-OLED technology - which is entering production but is still not ready for mass production.As LCD prices are increasing, Samsung is under pressure to release high-end premium TVs to compete with OLEDs and other TVs - which is the main reason for the company's reported agreement with LGD. It could be that Samsung aims to fill the gap in the next 1-2 years until QD-OLED or MicroLED technology is commercialized.In past years Samsung has been actively criticizing LG's OLED TV technology (mostly concentrating on the burn-in problems). This deal, if it materialized, will be a (well deserved?) admission by Samsung that it made a serious mistake back in 2013 when it chose the wrong technology for its OLED TV production. And an admission that its major local rival, LG, has been right all along.Source: MTN"

LG needs to be really careful with this new factory they're planning to build in China.https://www.theepochtimes.com/chinese-regime-threatens-technology-transfer-in-order-for-south-korean-firm-lgd-to-open-chinese-factory_2566158.html
"LG Display was considering converting its E5 production line at its Gumi factory to produce OLED panels for iPhones, TheElec has learned.E5 currently produces OLED panels for automobile and wearable applications.Currently, LG Display uses its E6 line at its factory in Paju to produce OLED panels for Apple for use in iPhones.The conversion of E5 is done for the company to supply more OLED panels for iPhones.LG Display is aiming to supply at least 40 million OLED panels for iPhones next year, sources within the company said. It is hoping to supply up to 50 million units if possible, they said.To reach that goal, E6-1 and E6-2 lines won’t be sufficient. The lines each have a production capacity of 15,000 substrates per month. This allows LG Display to execute 30,000 substrates per month, and with a yield rate of 80%, this means it can produce around 36 million units of 6-inch OLED panels a year.LG Display is planning to build another line, called E6-3, but back-end equipment for this line will be put in around September 2021, which means commercial production will likely begin in 2022 at the earliest.E5 also has a production capacity of 15,000 substrates per month. LG Display is planning to use half of that, or around 7,500, for iPhone OLED panels.LG Display has sent its line conversion plan to Apple. Cupertino is reviewing the matter but is yet to give the go-ahead.Converting E5 will save LG Display cost and allow it to increase panel production within a couple months. The South Korean display panel maker will secure a production capacity of 37,500 substrates per month. This will allow it to produce up to 45 million OLED panels a year.LG Display shipped 20 million units of OLED panels for Apple this year. Both LG Display and Samsung Display have set high targets for their OLED panel shipment for iPhones next year."

"LG Electronics Decides to Release LG Rollable, LG Rainbow, and LG Q83 in the First Half of 2021Dec 14, 2020LG Electronics has decided on LG Rollable (tentative name), Rainbow, and LG Q83 to be part of the smartphone lineup for the first half of 2021. Its strategy is to take the leadership in next-generation smartphone form factors by becoming the first smartphone manufacturer to apply rollable display and also secure practical interests through premium and budget smartphones.In March of 2021, the company plans to release its flagship smartphone “LG Rainbow” in South Korea. It will also introduce LG Rollable and LG Q83, which is a budget smartphone, in the first half as well.“LG Rollable”, which will be the second product of the company’s Explorer Project, can be stretched out to 7.4 inches from 6.8 inches. Field tests by South Korean telecommunications companies will take place at the end of this month or early next month. LG Electronics will decide on the release date of “LG Rainbow” depending on results from field tests.Thinness and light weight are the main advantages of LG Rollable over foldable smartphones. LG Rollable also does not leave any wrinkle on the screen that has negative effect on immersive experience. One high-ranking official from a telecommunications company said on December 13 that both the feeling of holding LG Rollable and the product’s usability when the screen is stretched out feel better than that of foldable smartphones and that it is a plus that the product does not cause any wrinkle or deformation on the display.LG Rollable is an important product that will determine LG Electronics’ smartphone business’s fate in the future. Although a Chinese brand introduced a prototype for rollable smartphone before LG Electronics, LG Electronics is seen to be at the top when it comes to knowhow in production process and level of completion as it has been working on the technology for a long time.""LG Rainbow”, which is the first flagship smartphone for the company’s Universal Line and is based on a bar-type smartphone design, is a model designated to help the company’s market share. It is the successor to LG Velvet and succeeds the V series such as LG V50 ThinQ and it will carry on the company’s lineage of premium smartphones. It is reported that LG Rainbow provides high-performance specifications due to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 and is also based on LG Velvet’s design. It is also expected to create a new competition when it comes to the writing input field as it comes with Wacom’s AES (Active Electrostatic) stylus pen."
"LG Electronics announced that it is partnering with door solutions developer Assa Abloy Entrance Systems to commercialize automatic sliding doors with transparent OLED panels.According to Prescient & Strategic Intelligence, the transparent display market is expected to grow on average 46 percent per year, which should translate into annual sales of around $5 billion by 2024. Samsung has mostly given up on making transparent displays, with reports of the company having ceased production in 2016. This gives LG an opportunity to capture a big share of that market, although we do know Samsung is at least toying with the idea of transparent displays for smartphones."
Finally! Some positive movement...long overdue!
"[Exclusive] Samsung Electronics finally joined hands with LGD... OLED panel annual supply contract of 3 million sheetsSamsung Electronics will receive organic light emitting diode (OLED) panels from LG Display and enter the OLED TV market in earnest. As Chinese companies control the supply of liquid crystal display (LCD) panels and the prices continue to rise and LCD TV profitability gradually deteriorates, it is interpreted that they have joined hands with rival LG Display.According to the financial investment industry and the display industry on the 21st, Samsung Electronics is planning to sign a contract with LG Display to supply 2 million to 3 million OLED panels per year from next year to 2024. It is known that as early as this week, Han Jong-hee, head of Samsung Electronics' video display (VD) business division, will make an announcement directly. According to market research firm Omdia last month, the average price of an OLED panel in the first quarter of this year based on a 55-inch general-purpose product is $510 (about 580,000 won). Taking this into consideration, a simple calculation would estimate the contract size to exceed 5 trillion won.Accordingly, Samsung Electronics, which has not yet released an OLED TV, is expected to enter the market in earnest. While the OLED TV market is growing rapidly, it is determined that it will be difficult to keep pace with the market growth rate with the large OLED panel 'QD OLED' being developed by its subsidiary Samsung Display. Although there is a forecast that Samsung Display will mass-produce QD OLED within this year, it takes considerable time for yield stabilization in the initial stage of production. For this reason, it is predicted that it will be difficult to exceed 1 million shipments next year by only supplying itself.Cooperation between Samsung Electronics and LG Display has been discussed several times in the past, but has been canceled due to various circumstances such as security. However, with the recent surge in LCD demand due to COVID-19 and Chinese companies such as BOE raising prices, it is no longer possible to guarantee profitability with LCD TV alone. In the OLED TV market, which is considered to be the future food of the future, some analysts say that the two companies have joined hands by winning over concerns that the future of the domestic display industry will be uncertain if they do not secure cost competitiveness from Chinese companies.An industry official said, ""As the price bargaining power with Chinese display companies is low, they are trying to change the plate to OLED while holding hands with LG Display, which is in competition with its subsidiaries."" ""In particular, the Chinese display industry is at a serious level for domestic companies. It seems that the two companies have decided to cooperate with each other for the protection and development of the domestic display ecosystem in the face of threats.”"
"If the price is judged by technology, LPL is grossly undervalued."

"LPL has been showing support at 7.68 and resistance at 8.20. Both technical and fundamental look good, according to stoxline."
Betting LCD TVs will drop in price on bigger models which will drive up demand. Everyone’s going to want an 80 to 100 inch tv.
"LG Display invests 3.3 trillion won in small and medium-sized OLED... The reason for the increase in investment is 1.3 trillion wonThe existing 2 trillion won standard is calculated as LTPS type.This time, LTPO + two-stack layer technology will be used.LG Display will additionally invest in small and medium-sized OLED (organic light-emitting diode) production lines. This is a response to the recent increase in the use of OLED for IT displays such as laptops and tablet PCs.LG Display held a board meeting on the 13th and announced on the 17th that it has decided to invest 3.3 trillion won in the small and medium-sized OLED field. Currently, LG Display is producing small and medium-sized OLEDs at E5 in Gumi, Gyeongsangbuk-do and E6 in Paju, Gyeonggi-do. Currently, the E5 has a production capacity of 15,000 sheets per month based on the 6th generation (1500mm X 1850mm) raw plate input, and the E6 has a production capacity of 30,000 sheets. The additional investment to be made this time is estimated to be at the level of 15,000 sheets per month. Considering that it usually takes 2 trillion won to invest 15,000 sheets of 6th generation OLED, the investment is about 1.3 trillion won, which is larger. This is because the calculation of the existing 2 trillion won investment is based on the selection of LTPS (Low Temperature Polysilicon) as TFT (Thin Film Transistor), which is the switch of the display. This time, LG Display's investment is expected to include LTPO (Low Temperature Polysilicon Oxide) technology and integrated touch screen technology as all the latest construction methods are mobilized. Since both LTPO and all-in-one touch screen technologies use photo processes, the amount of equipment required for deposition (CVD), exposure, and etching is also increased. In addition, the evaporation line, which accounts for 30-40% of the investment, is also expected to be equipped with a 'two-stack layer'. Two-stack layer refers to a technology that stacks two sub-pixel layers that emit red, green, and blue light in OLED. If two red, green, and blue layers overlap each other, bright light can be emitted without passing a large current to each layer. It's like using two lights at the right brightness for a longer period of time than using one light at full brightness. By reducing the load applied to each subpixel, the device lifespan is increased.This is an essential technology for IT OLED panels that are vulnerable to pixel burn-in and have a long replacement cycle. According to information presented by LG Display at the Information Display Society (IMID) in 2018, when two-stack layer technology is applied, the luminous efficiency increases by 1.5 to 2 times and the device lifespan by more than 4 times.However, the number of chambers required for the deposition line increases in that the red, green, and blue layers need to be doubled. It is estimated that about 100 chambers are usually required for one 6th generation line, but it is known that about 150 chambers are needed when investing in a two-stack method.An executive of a display equipment company said, “The initial investment planned by LG Display was to add 7,500 sheets to 15,000 sheets.

"A report to clients from analysts at South Korea’s Shinhan Investment Corp sys that LG Display’s Chinese OLED production lines will increase output in 2021 to a forecast 71.7 percent increase year-over-year and to about 7.87 million units.The analysts say they expect to see a sharp rise in sales of high-margin panels used in 48-inch OLED TVs equipped with gaming Graphics Processing Units.POLEDs (Plastic substrate OLEDs) will also generate impressive growth. “POLED panel production should surge 86.7 per cent Y-o-Y to 51.67 million units in 2021 on the adoption of in-cell touch technology. We thus project OLED TV and POLED panel operations to break even on operating profit next year,” says Shinhan."
"LGD's new panels have new emitting materials and an additional ""layer"" to increase efficiency. Hopefully, one of the AV sites will find out what the new layer means.LG Display’s new 77-inch OLED display shows significant progress in picture quality through newly developed and highly efficient materials as well as the addition of a layer to the display, thereby improving its efficiency by around 20%. Higher efficiency means that the display improves its brightness to realize more vivid images."

"LG Display to supply 'Cadillac EV' POLED... GM Trade ExpansionLG Display's automotive display business is cruising. The first electric vehicle (EV) of Cadillac, a premium brand of General Motors (GM) in the US, will also be equipped with plastic organic light emitting diodes (POLEDs).According to the industry on the 24th, LG Display is planning to supply 33-inch POLEDs to the Cadillac EV ‘Lyric’.Previously, LG Display supplied 38-inch POLEDs to Cadillac’s large sports utility vehicle (SUV) ‘Escalade’. The central instrument cluster consists of 14-inch, 7-inch and 17-inch panels.The electric SUV Lyric was unveiled last April. It is based on GM's modular electric vehicle platform Ultium Powertrain. There are 12 modules. It will be equipped with nickel, cobalt, manganese, aluminum (NCMA) batteries produced by Ultium Cells, a joint venture between GM and LG Energy Solutions (JV). The battery has a capacity of 100 kilowatt-hours (kWh) and a driving range of 300 miles (about 483 km) when fully charged.In the case of Lyric, the market response is so positive that all of the prepared volumes were signed within 10 minutes of starting the pre-order on the 18th (local time).GM plans to begin production of lyric at its Tennessee plant in the US in the first quarter of next year. Shipping is expected to begin in the first half of the year. LG Display is also expected to provide POLEDs on schedule.LG Display is a strong player in the automotive display field. According to market research firm Omdia, LG Display accounted for 25.9% (based on sales) in the market share of high-value-added displays for vehicles over 10 inches in the first quarter. 1 in the industry for 11 consecutive quarters. If it is limited to OLED for electric use, it is a de facto monopoly system with more than 90%.The secret is to dominate the market. In the process of expanding the business area from large OLEDs to small and medium-sized OLEDs, they started targeting the battlefield, which was a blue ocean. Due to the nature of the auto industry, which requires high reliability, it does not change partners well. This is a favorable condition for LG Display, which has dominated the market. This means that there is a high possibility that the transaction will continue with major customers such as GM, BMW, and Benz.Until now, POLED has been used only for premium cars, and most of them have been applied to LCD. POLED has the advantage of being light and having high power efficiency. As it is self-luminous, it is advantageous in terms of visibility (easy identification). The use of POLED in EVs and autonomous vehicles is expected to increase in the future. This Lyric contract is the result of the same thing.An official from the display industry said, “The size of the automotive display market has already grown to a level that is not small at more than 10 trillion won. As it has high growth potential in the future, it will have a positive impact on LG Display’s performance.”Meanwhile, the alliance between LG Group and GM is expanding. Focusing on the battery JV, ?LG Magna (powertrain) ?LG Display (POLED), LG Innotek (converter), etc. are increasing their transactions with GM.Source: ddaily"
"LGD working hard on smartphone OLED… 1.6 trillion won attack investment in Vietnam factoryLG Display will invest more than 1.6 trillion won to expand the organic light emitting diode (OLED) module factory in Hai Phong industrial complex in Vietnam by 40%.According to Reuters and the Vietnamese government on the 31st, the Hai Phong City People's Committee approved LG Display's $1.4 billion (about 1.6 trillion won) investment plan. Through this investment, LG Display is expected to increase its factory facilities in Hai Phong Industrial Complex by 30-40% compared to the previous one. The People's Committee predicted that once LG Display completes the investment, the production of OLED modules at the Hai Phong plant, which was about 9-10 million units per month, will increase to 13 to 14 million units.LG Display's Haiphong plant is a base that makes modules by attaching various parts to OLED panels produced at the Paju and Gumi plants in Korea and the Guangzhou plants in China. It evenly assembles large OLED modules mounted on TVs and small and medium-sized OLED modules used in smartphones. The Hai Phong plant started construction in 2016 and started operation in 2017. If we add $1.4 billion to this time, LG Display's accumulated investment in Haiphong will increase to $4.6 billion. The company also invested 840 billion won in the Hai Phong plant in February.The OLED market is showing explosive growth regardless of large and small-sized panels. The global sales of large OLED panels exclusively produced by LG Display are expected to exceed 8 million units this year from 4.5 million units last year and 10 million units next year. Worldwide smartphone shipments using OLED displays will also exceed 500 million units this year, increasing by more than 30% compared to the previous year. In this regard, LG Display announced in mid-August that it would spend 3.3 trillion won to build a new production line for small and medium-sized 6th generation OLED panels in Paju. LG Display plans to double the production of OLED panels at the Paju plant, which is currently 30,000 sheets per month, to 60,000 sheets by starting the new facility in 2024.In the display industry, there are many observations that Apple has significantly increased the order quantity of OLED modules to be installed in flagship products such as new iPhones and iPads for LG Display. An industry insider said, ""Most of the panel supply from LG Display's new Paju production base will be supplied to Apple.""Source: news.naver"

"Samsung Dislpay, LG Display, Magnachip Semiconductor, are all in front of a tremendous demand for OLED displays, as from $AAPL to $NTDOY, all tech leaders are going to fully adopt OLED. This is not an estimate or speculation, these are the news and the announced plans. The only problem these companies are facing is the well known shortage...But always these shortages ease and the revenues of the aforementioned company will be boosted. The Chinese peers of the U.S. techs know this, that is why the Chinese try to acquire Magnachip even with a 100% premium. The U.S. authorities try to stop them from buying Magnachip, but if the company close its U.S. offices, then they can't do that."

"LG Display details how OLED TV production is more environmentally friendly than LCD productionLG Display says that OLED TV production is more environmentally friendly than LCD TV production. A 65-inch LCD requires around 5.2 Kg of plastic, while a similarly-sized OLED uses only 0.43 Kg of plastics.LG Display says that in Q1 2021 alone its plastic consumption was lower by 71,550 tons compared to what it would have been if it produced LCD TVs instead of OLED TVs.According to LG's analysis, OLED TV panels reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds by more than 50 percent compared to LCD TV panels. This makes OLED TVs also easier to recycle - according to LGD the product recycling rate of OLED TV panels is 92.2%, higher than that of LCD TVs (<72%). LGD uses recyclable iron as materials for OLED panel parts.LGD also updates that in 2020, the company reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 39% compared to 2014.Source: Business Korea"

Less loss than was expected but LG is increasing capacity for a reason. Still waiting on the Apple announcement but the future definitely looks better for LG and their longs. Expect some profit taking in a.m. but I'm waiting on a drop to load up some more...fattening up for the winter
A few days of churn then a 5% plummet. We're due for another nice haircut. Nothing at this point after Apple to stop the negative trajectory. Fundamentals are not good
