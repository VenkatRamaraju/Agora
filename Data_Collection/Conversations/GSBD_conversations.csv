When does GSBD pay next dividend ?
Anybody hanging out on this thread???
For anyone who hangs out hereThis fund pays .45 per quarter + .05 special div = .50 x 4 qts for 2.00 for the yearBuying today @ 19.65 would result in over a 10% Div for the year......Since Covid is under control small and mid cap business may be looking to expand So there might be some capital appreciation along with that 10% div I welcome your thoughts guys ???
Love this dividend stock
durrr.....interest rate go up....I hold dividend stonk....cos SMATR! I AM SMATR!

Nice rise of .24 cents today on less than average volumeFirst quarter results will post May 6th
I am very happy with the the recovery of this stock post pandemic. I am invested in a bunch of reits and bdcs. This is one of my best recovery stocks. solid.
"interesting but I think at the moment its too high , near $20 somewhere its worth another look."
"New to owning the stock, have some of their Corporate Bonds. When I realized the 9+% dividend, and their PE ratio is only 4.5 (well below most in the sector), had to buy the stock. Earnings out today after the close were pretty much as anticipated. I guess we will see how it trades tomorrow. Just seems weird, undervalued based on their peers, affiliated with Goldman Sachs, almost 10% dividend with the extra .05 special divvy, am I missing something? I always believe the adage if it seems to good to be true...Feeling optimistic for stock price appreciation plus absurd dividend, looking for those who know more than I do to burst my bubble! Appreciate replies based on analysis. Thanks and best of luck to those who found this before me!!"
It must be true that GSBD uses leverage in order to pay ~ 10% div. But since their business is also to lend money perhaps they will be little affected by rising interest rates. Or do they make money by other means then providing loans? I want to buy for the div. but I'd like to know how they manage to do it.
This merger with another GS affiliate looks only positive for GSBD. What am I missing?
"Still desperate. This thing is almost in free fall compared to other BDCs I feel like I was tricked because I bought it a few months ago, now there seems to be some sort of insider info. Probably ""friends of Goldman"" or something like that."
You got to love this steady climb with the nice dividend kicker...
Why is this stock sinking????
GSBD is up 15.94% to 15.78
GSBD reached a new 52 Week Low at 18.92
GSBD reached a new 52 Week Low at 19.90
I bought into GSBD @ 12.20 It’s still holding strong. Not worried. This stock will rise.
what's up here? almost 5% in a session? and no news!
"Just invested in this BDC yesterday. Added to my list that includes MAIN, PSEC, SAR, GLAD, and ARCC. Also holding positions in REITS, including WPC, STAG, O, NLY, and BRMK. I'm intrigued by the special dividends and very steady regular dividends offered by GSBD (also own GS)."
just keep paying!
What are the chances that GSBD would ever increase its regular dividend payouts?
Are those special dividends 0.05usd additional dividends beside quarter dividends of 0.45usd?08/13/2021 08/16/2021 11/04/2020 09/15/2021 0.05 Special05/13/2021 05/14/2021 11/04/2020 06/15/2021 0.05 Special03/30/2021 03/31/2021 02/24/2021 04/27/2021 0.45 Quarterly02/12/2021 02/15/2021 11/04/2020 03/15/2021 0.05 Special
I don't understand ot either. the dividend appears to be very safe with a special dividend declared. I think the stock is flying so much under the rader and suffers from low liquidity. if o had cash I would have bought some more at this lower price.

GSBD is up 14.99% to 10.92
Can not even depend on goldman...
Correct me if im wrong this is the ultimate dividend stock.
I guess I’m the number 1 fan here
"Someone has been desperate to sell their shares, in size, today. Starting to look interesting again."
I have read recently that after the merger GSBD will be trading at a discounted NAV of 20%.
"What a smooth ride down! 9.45% yield, but nobody cares, it seems. It must be that GSBD's ability to earn 0.45 per quarter is being questioned, but it is unclear where the danger would come from. Portfolio defaults perhaps?"
Got to be happy with today. Heading back to $19+
I just checked on my last dividend GSBD and it was .05 cent a share. I thought it was Supposed to be .45 cent. Can anyone explain this? Thanks for any help
big and probably safe dividend trading down because of rising interest rate..probably oversold..but ovrreall market is shaking down
Anybody have an opinion why this is lower? Insight into safety of the divi?
"Was there always an options chain for this? I've owned it in the past a couple of times but never noticed options available for it. FYI, I'm not playing options on this but wanted to know if it could be manipulated via that means."
Goldman Sachs BDC is up 6.96% to 16.45
getting close to a buy...dividend coming in may..around.8.9%....analyst say it safe
