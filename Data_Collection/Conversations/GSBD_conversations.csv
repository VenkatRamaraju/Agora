"What a smooth ride down! 9.45% yield, but nobody cares, it seems. It must be that GSBD's ability to earn 0.45 per quarter is being questioned, but it is unclear where the danger would come from. Portfolio defaults perhaps?"

"Someone has been desperate to sell their shares, in size, today. Starting to look interesting again."
does anybody know anything why the 8% rise in aftermarket trade?
Goldman Sachs BDC is down 5.36% to 15.18
I just noticed that Goldman Sacks has declined just over 10% from it's recent high and GSBD has declined just over 8% in the same time frame. Since GSBD reported expected earnings & div. I have not been able to find any reason for it's decline except it's relation to GS. Does anyone else have any info on GSBD?

yes separate in addition to regular dividends
I don't understand ot either. the dividend appears to be very safe with a special dividend declared. I think the stock is flying so much under the rader and suffers from low liquidity. if o had cash I would have bought some more at this lower price.

"Just invested in this BDC yesterday. Added to my list that includes MAIN, PSEC, SAR, GLAD, and ARCC. Also holding positions in REITS, including WPC, STAG, O, NLY, and BRMK. I'm intrigued by the special dividends and very steady regular dividends offered by GSBD (also own GS)."
Any thoughts? (I am a GSBD investor..)https://seekingalpha.com/article/4350951-bizd-i-got-memo-and-said-burn-reading
I just checked on my last dividend GSBD and it was .05 cent a share. I thought it was Supposed to be .45 cent. Can anyone explain this? Thanks for any help
GSBD is up 15.94% to 15.78
GSBD reached a 52 Week low at $18.55
For anyone who hangs out hereThis fund pays .45 per quarter + .05 special div = .50 x 4 qts for 2.00 for the yearBuying today @ 19.65 would result in over a 10% Div for the year......Since Covid is under control small and mid cap business may be looking to expand So there might be some capital appreciation along with that 10% div I welcome your thoughts guys ???
GSBD is down 14.67% to 11.09
is this p/e correct at 58.70 ? real danger number it would seem!
What are the chances that GSBD would ever increase its regular dividend payouts?
I am concerned with the decline in the stock. The earnings met expectations and covered the dividend. What happened? Have I missed something?
You got to love this steady climb with the nice dividend kicker...
GSBD reached an all time low at 16.06
"Still desperate. This thing is almost in free fall compared to other BDCs I feel like I was tricked because I bought it a few months ago, now there seems to be some sort of insider info. Probably ""friends of Goldman"" or something like that."
Why is this stock sinking????
GSBD is down 14.09% to 12.50

Zaimoglu leaving. Might now improve. 
Nice rise of .24 cents today on less than average volumeFirst quarter results will post May 6th
big and probably safe dividend trading down because of rising interest rate..probably oversold..but ovrreall market is shaking down
Goldman Sachs BDC is up 4.94% to 19.12

Tanking after hours. Minus 8%
I bought into GSBD @ 12.20 It’s still holding strong. Not worried. This stock will rise.
"Why is it languishing like this? Dividends are being paid, merger went through...what gives?"
GSBD reached an all time low at 10.37
When does GSBD pay next dividend ?
Goldman Sachs BDC is down 5.07% to 19.30
"Does today’s closing sp have anything to do with Turkey? Ah , the country not the fowl."
Is this dropping twice the market drop due to problems at GS? Kind of separate aren’t they?
GS problems are not = to GSBD problems. Buy the dip. :-) IMHO
Why is this yielding 9% when junk bonds are 4%?
About the merger... It looks like MMLC holders are getting a big payday. What do GSBD shareholders get out of this?
Can not even depend on goldman...
GSBD is up 43.44% to 21.00
This merger with another GS affiliate looks only positive for GSBD. What am I missing?
just keep paying!
PEs too high in this environment
GSBD reached a new 52 Week Low at 18.92
The one thing I don't like about owning GSBD is it has the same name as GS. Any news about GSBD is overwhelmed from GS news....
GSBD reached a new 52 Week Low at 19.90
"New to owning the stock, have some of their Corporate Bonds. When I realized the 9+% dividend, and their PE ratio is only 4.5 (well below most in the sector), had to buy the stock. Earnings out today after the close were pretty much as anticipated. I guess we will see how it trades tomorrow. Just seems weird, undervalued based on their peers, affiliated with Goldman Sachs, almost 10% dividend with the extra .05 special divvy, am I missing something? I always believe the adage if it seems to good to be true...Feeling optimistic for stock price appreciation plus absurd dividend, looking for those who know more than I do to burst my bubble! Appreciate replies based on analysis. Thanks and best of luck to those who found this before me!!"
This crooked firm once stated crude oil would reach $200 per barrel. Pumped so they could sold their holdings.
im in pre-mrkt 8.87% divy... target for my retirement
"Was there always an options chain for this? I've owned it in the past a couple of times but never noticed options available for it. FYI, I'm not playing options on this but wanted to know if it could be manipulated via that means."
