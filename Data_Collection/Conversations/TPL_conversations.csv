I’d rather be Jimbo Fisher.
The biggest problem I see with TPL right now is valuation. The market cap and PE ratios are very highand I believe they will go higher but this is not the same as when the PE was around its historic lows of15. Should Shell Oil and CVX both sell off their Permian assets I would that somewhat troubling as well.Now is not the time for management to be buying back stock and certainly the cash it holds could be usedto acquire some accretive high quality assets and remain debt free! ARLP is a coal mining company thathas established an oil and gas royalty division as a diversification measure. That part of their businessis not properly valued by the market and they look at it as being fully valued if it traded at 10X earnings!My point is that management here should use cash to do deals that would be accretive to earnings as longas doing a particular deal offers a much better payback than buying back TPL stock (at this level) would be.
"Tried to post to Make a case to to go back to original mission. Our fossil fuel industry is being destroyed as we look. Today the White House (Biden Puppetmasters) responded to a cry from the industry to loosen up the shut downs so the lesees can get back to work and we at TPL can project how to make money in this environment. The answer was a clear NO. We are gonna see $107 oil by the winter for Permian and with freezes in leases and new well openings, it is mighty tough to figure out how to make a clean dollar, How long will this last? Now Russia is selling to us and Europe and China is only getting a little from us. They are building new coal plants. My best hope would be the C-Corp see the futility of this and how long it will happen while oil and gas well skills find work elsewhere. They are even talking about cleaning out the strategic energy reserve. That is crazy. No, let's start drawing down shares and trying to get this baby close to $2000/shae and shut down or sell to an optimist with lots of money in this alternate junk. Long term C-Corp as the Blog below describes is naieve. If this turns around, earliest will be like 2026 with a new administration in DC, A new Congress has to go through the remainder in the White House. It takes 66% votes to overthrow a Veto."
"U.S. drillers have not ramped up production this year, operating conservatively and taking a wait and see attitude. With oil firmly in the $70 area for an extended period of time, it is soon to be expected that North American drillers will start to dip their toes in the water, the Permian being top on the list. Mergers and acquisitions will also heat up, which brings me to the point that I don't see TPL remaining independent much longer. Prime acreage, strong cash flows, and no debt that the purchaser would have to assume is a big factor. We now have a board of directors that have no allegiance to the old TPL, a more desirable corporate structure, At this price and number of shares, a major or even a mid-tier could easily goggle this up. The question is at what price? We as retail investors have little say in the final outcome, as HK and Co. have a dominant position. I only hope this ride will be worth it in the end."
So we will know more with the 10Q but on the surface it seems that a couple of things happened that were outside the overall environment in the Permian at this time. I was of the belief that the 3Q and beyond under the current market conditions was dependent for growth of CVR and APC. CVR's production on the Permianwas up 26% for 3Q. TPLs O&G was up 22% for the QTR. The smaller companies laid down their rigs or reduced starting in the 3Q as they have run out of capital and are being pressured by stockholders to rationalized capital and costs. This will continue until profitability improves. The second thing was $8 million increase in easements for pipelines. This is amazing totally not understood (one of those unknown variables) with much of this being recurring. Although Water was up it was not the big driver. Bottom line much of any new growth will be dependent on the majors and water will become less and less valuable for TPL (Majors have their own or will).
"if you’re curious about the HK webinar, if they had enough assets they wouldn’t mind owning 100% of TPL. It wouldn’t be unreasonable for TPL to have over $50 yearly earnings in 3 yrs. time. That as more and more co. Get into the royalty biz the p/e should increase and comparing TPL to the gold royalty co. That is if TPL had half the p/e level of the gold royalty cos. TPL p/e would get a significant increase.They cited a study that gas and oil usage will increase to at least 2040 but I wouldn’t rely on that. Most importantly, why TPL because they don’t have financial risk-no debt and they don’t have operational risk. They also believe since debt is out of control govts will print money like candy inflation will flourish and commodities will go upFinally, they said nyet to William as trustee,suggesting he had a Russian accent in his writings."
"ADAM asked a good question about the amount of recoverable oil in the Permian Basin. That number is based upontechnology and economics, both of which change over time. Given what the super-majors are planning my guess isthat oil production will double over the next 5 years or sooner. What will the price of oil be? I do not know. Shell andChevron both have clamed that their ""new wells"" in the Permian are profitable at $20 oil. ( I hope they don't have toprove that thesis.) My guess is that the new Permian wells are the most economic in the US so they will be the lastones to ever see a cutback in production. Personally, I think oil prices may fall to $35-$40 a barrel. So how much recoverable oil is in the Permian? Enough for us to not have to worry about. What should we worry about? The price of oil."
"What an erratic year for TPL in 2018, but still nearly an 18% increase for the year. Not too shabby, all things considered, and a very interesting year shaping up in 2019 as we learn answers to questions such as: 1.) what was the strategy behind the $100mm land sale/swap? 2.) what ""special"" dividend may await shareholders in March/April? 3.) what impact will there be on oil prices from OPEC's production cut starting in January, and what effect will that have on production in the Permian (and, specifically on TPL lands? 4.) and how much growth will we see with the water business to justify the capital expenditures on the build out? I really enjoy the thoughtful discussion on this board (as well as Seeking Alpha and the tpltblog.com page) and wish everyone a Happy New Year! What is your biggest question for 2019?"
Q2 rev $73.8 EPS $6.73. WOW.
"I am not an oil & gas guy, mostly invest in tech but liked this company for some diversification. So I have a few questions: How big a problem is the infrastructure bottleneck for the Permian Basin? How long is it expected to last? and How will it affect TPL's income streams from royalties and the new water business? Appreciate any insight. thanks"
"Gary, you asked Glenn and Whelan for their 2 cents on voting. I've watched this board for a long time, especially posts from those two, you, and a few others, starting back when there were only a few others. I'm lucky enough to have held TPL for many years longer than that. I get the frustration with TPL needing to be more transparent. I still don't understand the recent land exchange, for example, and I think it's outrageous that management doesn't explain their vision. Of course, I have long respected the fact that there is very little overhead here, and that means fewer bells and whistles. I saw a post that the new trustees upped their pay to $2M. Is that true? HZN also complains about lack of transparency, but as I see it their letter suffers the same flaw. I have to say the HZN lost credibility with that letter. It lacks any substantive plan. It reads like they only want to add overhead. I also have concern with bitcoin gamblers running TPL, which has tangible assets. That said, HZN has skin in the game.All of the change makes me concerned that individuals could work with the Chevrons out there to benefit themselves and not shareholders. What is your view Gary? Texas vernacular response encouraged."
"Gentlemen, am I right in assuming that if TPL continues to retire stock they are effectively increasing the percentage of ownership of all shareholders which gets HK as the largest shareholder closer to controlling interest?"
INF may be the first ETF to own TPL but there could be rush later this year for energy related ETFs and indices to load up on TPL. It will only take research report from Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley to cause a stampede and take TPL 50% higher from here especially with increased transparency coming.
"All have noticed how TPL declines before earnings. Recent information indicates this is a result of them stopping stock buybacks before release of earnings to stop any hint of insider trading issue. This makes sense to me and would indicate the month after, in this case, November will be a strong month for the stock. Your thoughts?"
"all is good in the TPL world - after hours trading does not mean much unless there is a massive amount of volume, as I understand it."
Position doubled at $648....if you aren’t loading at these prices you aren’t doing it right. Long term holder. Not a trader
"Lurker here....sitting on a 30+ bagger now with all shares in either my 401(k) and an HSA account. About five years from retirement so with 50% of my two retirement accounts in TPL, I am concerned, albeit in a shorter term than most, probably ten years at the maximum before I will start liquidating, shorter if TPL is bought out.With that in mind, I would rather TPL just keep chugging along, not bothering anybody and making us all richer with time. Selling a share or two a month six to ten years from now will be preferable to getting a lump sum if we are bought out, so I have taken an about-face on my stance over the past day or so - I voted my shares out of my HSA for Oliver but the bulk of my shares in the 401 will probably be for the company's suggestion IF I do not find compelling reason to do otherwise. The slow growth (relatively speaking) is much better for me than a 20-40% jump that we will get with a buyout. The argument that Bizaritrino has made got me thinking - why would Oliver and HK keep TPL intact the way we are going when they could accumulate enough shares for a BOD takeover and either keep it for themselves or sell? Even the most patient investors get impatient.Even if Oliver gains his seat, the other two directors will keep him in check and keep the status quo. As for the other two and their high bonuses, I want to share with you a story that happened ten years ago.We (my business partner and I) build a new office building, and, during the process, we got a large amount of tax credits that were sold and offset the price of the building substantially. The CPA and the attorney that handled the process were well versed in the game and made a bunch of money off of the sale also. At closing, I walked in and looked at the CPA and the attorney and said ""we are paying you and you too much money, but since I am also making a lot of money, I really don't care"". They all got a laugh and it broke the seriousness of the closing down a few steps. The two remaining directors are making me a lot of money, so I really don't care that they are getting to reap the benefits of TPL doing well.Comments welcome."
"I noticed TPL's trading volume has been up the last several days. I also noticed TheStreet, Inc., Jim Cramer's financial news website has a ""Buy"" position on TPL. I perfer, ""We few, we happy few"". I worry about day traders and swing traders as more people discover TPL. This can lead to pps manipulation. Jimmy Cramer might have more out reach than any Wall Street analyst."
"IMHO the TPL ""bus"" is headed to $2,500 per share provided WTI goes up to about $80 a barrel, which if it happens as it appears that the world economy continues to improve is likely to result in reported profits of at least $60 per share per year, perhaps higher, so that the PE when $2,500 per share would be about 40. Those who get off the TPL bus, even if the ride can be a little bit bumpy at times, I believe are shortsighted because the TPL share price trend IMHO is definitely higher in price. Best regards to all TPL longs, especially the long-term longs."
Credit Suisse initiates TPL coverage today with $800 price target. 27 page report is the first EVER from a major energy analyst. Sees significant slowdown on key metrics. Might scare the recent ETF holders to sell.
Can somebody please explain... at 330pm the volume was around 135k and the closing volume was 600k but the price didn’t move in that 30 minute window? Thx
"Looks like we're in a solid run. Up for the day, week, month, and 3 months. About flat from 6 months ago, and still down from the 52 week peak before COVID. We're facing a tailwind in the markets today, but TPL is still up. There is a vaccine on the horizon and many parts of the economy should be returning to normal this spring. Add to that HQ getting their act together at some point (knock on mesquite wood), and things look really good."
How much free cash do we have on the balance sheet now? I ask that for the posters advocating a lot of buybacks. We now have much more annual operating expenditure due to raises in compensation and number of front office staff to manage the receipt of revenues (are there many of the leasers pumping right now?) Same question for the water operation.Why the higher compensation if revenues are down??? Just asking.
"TPL just filed an 8k announcing the sale of 14k Surface Acres for $100,000,000."
"Ok, somethings up with TPL...thank goodness I added almost 800 shares yesterday am at 882.What's the story ??? Someone is accumulating shares as volume is 2x normal the last few daysWho's the big bad wolf ?"
"This was the body of the filing - please see the entire filingMarch 28, 2019Texas Pacific Land Trust1700 Pacific Avenue, Suite 2770Dallas, Texas 75201Attention:David E. Barry, Co-Chairman of the TrusteesJohn R. Norris III, Co-Chairman of the Trustees Dear David and John,I received this morning via e-mail a request from one of the two law firms representing Texas Pacific Land Trust to complete a 66-page “Trustee Questionnaire.” I attach it to this letter in case you have not had a chance to previously review it. Your advisors appear to be confused or misinformed.As you both know, following the resignation of Maurice Meyer III as trustee on February 26, 2019, Allan Tessler immediately contacted you to discuss my potential nomination as trustee to fill the vacancy. The only information you requested from me at that time was a short bio, which I promptly delivered to you on February 28, 2019.You did not ask for any questionnaire then, nor did you extend the courtesy of an interview before your decision to reject my nomination. Instead, you publicly announced four days later, on March 4, 2019, your decision to nominate Preston Young to fill the newly-created vacancy.Upon your March 4, 2019 announcement, I requested additional information about the process that you had followed to nominate someone to a life-tenured position as trustee of TPL. My request was simply ignored.Given this record, I am confused as to why you would now — after previously summarily rejecting my candidacy in less than four days — want to try to re-write history by having your lawyers send to me the attached questionnaire. You already made a decision regarding my nomination and your intent to oppose it. In fact, your own advisors’ statements to the press over the last few days, including their statements to have been hired to run a “proxy contest,” further confirm this point.Rest assured, I will directly provide to TPL investors all information they need from me in order to make an informed decision at the special meeting regarding my nomination. Similarly, I hope that you make all proper disclosures regarding Mr. Young.I also take this opportunity to question the wisdom of hiring two law firms, an investment bank and a public relations firm, in addition to a proxy solicitor, to mount an attack on three long-term investors that collectively own over 25% of TPL’s shares. While your advisors seem quite eager to get their name in the press, I suggest that you explain to them the fact that we have had an ongoing dialogue for over a decade: I have beneficially owned Shares since 2004, and Horizon since 1994.I can understand the appeal in this day and age of trying to construct a narrative in which Horizon, Mr. Tessler and myself are portrayed as “activists” looking for a short term profit. But let me suggest that such approach is undermined by the basic facts of our situation. I believe TPL investors deserve better.Instead, I hope we can have a measured dialogue in which both sides can explain their view as to who will make for a better trustee and the substantive ideas underlying our respective platforms. I also invite that we continue a direct dialogue, as we have in the past, instead of having to go through your multiple outside advisors.Sincerely,/s/ Eric OliverSoftVest Advisors, L.L.C.By: SoftVest Advisors Holdings, L.L.C.By: Eric L. Oliver, President and Managing Member"
"In the past, the price has remained essentially flat following extraordinarily positive earnings reports. I haven't gone back to verify the numbers, but my recollection was that we saw price increases on the order of 2% the day after a report in which several yoy numbers were triple digits. That was disconcerting, but we seem to have had a sufficient correction since then.I am gratified this morning to see a nice bump in price following a report of gains *merely* in the dozens of percent. To me, that indicates that shares are now fairly or even undervalued. Once the organizational issues are settled, and buy-backs return, I expect a major uptick. It may take time, but the underlying business model is still solid. Perhaps we will be up another 100% from here ($629) by Q2 2021?"
"The last time crude oil was at this high a price was around August 1, 2021, TPL was near $1,500 per share at that time. If crude oil stays at this level for at least a few days, I suspect we'll be marching up to $1,400 a share in short order."
It was stated in the January TPL Special Committee transparency announcement that the Commitee would extend it's term through February 29th. Since no other declaration of extension has been made we should assume that participants are released from their vows of secrecy. Should anticipate the dissidents are free to openly express and discuss they're views on the possibilities of upcoming changes to the structure of the business or will they remain forever silent on the topic... now that adequate monetary rewards have now been divvied-up & prepared for disbursement...
"Chevron (CVR) is investing $4 billion into the Permian in 2020 for ""unconventional."" This is why TPL is so attractive as aninvestment. As Chevron expands the scope of their operations in the Permian, some of that investment will result in moremoney flooding into TPL coffers. Of course, the same holds true for operators like Shell Oil, and Occidental. TPL for energyhas what NYC has for real estate...location, location, location. I do wonder if Chevron will acquire TPL. Sooner or later I thinksomeone will, especially if TPL gets away from the ""shrinking trust"" model. The key question now is will TPL's special committee put into place competent management to run TPL as a C corp. Good management will be the key to unlockingvalue from TPL's massive asset base. Poor management, will destroy it."
"Hey everyone, I corresponded with TPL's investor relations and was informed that we should expect earnings towards the end of the month. With the new C-corp, earnings releases require board approval and they will be releasing earnings closer to the filing of the 10-K's and 10-Q's to allow sufficient time for approval. In the meantime, here's to $1k TPL!"
Here go out here and look at CVX guidance. What do you think this will do to TPL? Now apply it times 2 to all the others. Until oil turns around like $50-$60 business will be in the doldrums. Now what do you think TPL should be selling? I say maybe $350-$400. They will be profitable and they will have underlying value but don't expect $800. Besides they still have the same management.https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/243/58243/slides/11.jpg?1596196185
TPL now up over $180 from the low of a few weeks ago! TPL always has sharp rebounds after falling.Anyone brave enough to estimate 2019 EPS for TPL?
Just got off the phone with Mr. Packer. TPL will defer taxes on the land sale through a 1031 exchange.They will be purchasing properties in certain areas and the intent is to ultimately add valueby increasing cash-flows. So the money from the land sales may be used to buy propertiesthat should enhance operations such as water. From my brief conversation it sounds TPL willfurther grow their water operations. All in all this just affirms what most of us thought. The landsales proceeds will have to be used in the purchase of like properties within 60 days from whenthe deal closes (in the 1st quarter of 2019.) So that gives them time to be on the prowl forbargains right now.
"Looks like some entity is selling some significant sized blocks of TPL stock today, including over 6000 shares just before noon Eastern time. This quite likely explains the price weakness of TPL today, despite the price of crude being up."
"TPL now trades at at a PE closer to historic highs. Index fund buying could well push the stock price higherwith the sector on fire these days. Buybacks are great if they are done at appropriate times when PE ratios are low and sentiment is in the toilet. My advise here would be to sell on spikes, but be prepared to havesome stock to sell up to perhaps $1400. Does TPL deserve the PE ratio it has now? Maybe! To me it islike a gold royalty trust FNV which has traded at PE's of over 100 at times! TPL has a historically low PE of 15 at someday may trade there again. Right now management is not showing its hand as to whetherthey will use high value stock to acquire high(er) return assets. Perhaps they never will. For those whostayed in here I offer a huge Congrats! Keep in mind this could easily fall to 600 just as easily as a moveup to 1800. Both are possible. TPL is an exceedingly high quality asset today and its share price reflectsthat. My best ""guess"" is it goes higher from here...but that will not last forever."
"Both XOM &CVX announced huge expansion plans for oil production from the Permian. CVX plans todouble production from current levels by 2023. CVX claims they do not have to pay royalties on their production. (At this point I'm not at all certain how much TPL is collecting from CVX in royalties.) Regardless, growth in thePermian will continue for at least the next 4 years. As a simplistic view of TPL I believe at some point $50 EPS isdoable within a few years, and a PE of 30X is likely, so $1500 is a target. Thus, anyone buying TPL at less than $750has a shot at a double...and anyone who buys at under $1000 has a shot at a 50% gain. TPL at this stage is a safe,solid way to play Permian growth."
"I am new to this board, which is probably the best source of information about TPL to be found anywhere on such an under-the-radar stock. What an incredible ride this stock has been over the 20+ years I've owned it. To my mind, the most (of many) appealing aspects of this stock is the mandated buyback of the shares. One question I've always wondered about is whether or not the price per share at any given time dictates the volume of the yearly buybacks? In other words, has the dramatic run up in price the last few years scaled back the buybacks, or does the board just chug ahead at a steady rate no matter what the price? Any insight from the veterans on this site would be greatly appreciated."
"I'm interested in what others think. 1) Do you hope TPL spins off the water business? 2) If you are long on TPL, and they do spin off the water business, assuming prices don't change radically in the short term, would you keep both, sell both, or sell only one if they do split? 3) If they do split, should water rights stay with TPL or go with the water business? 4) Regardless of what you wish would happen, what do you think will happen?"
Here is what I cannot figure out - somebody is acquiring shares at any price? Look at the daily volume the last three weeks plus. Thoughts????
"The fact that oil producers are not increasing their production is not the fault of our Board or the fact that we converted to a ""C"" Corp. We are just a royalty company. We don't decide when to drill, where to drill, or how much. The fact that we converted to a corp is independent from the fact that oil majors are not increasing production. They are paying down debt, increasing dividends and reducing shares instead. Often burned in the Boom or Bust cycle, they are now playing it conservatively. Can't say that I blame them, but sooner or later they will have to increase exploration and production. Royalty companies are trailing indicators, not leading indicators. But at least get those DUC's (drilled-uncomlpeted) online. The next quarter should give us some more insight, at least if there is a legitimate management discussion of the results. As a royalty co. we have little say in the direction of the drillers, but also no risks."
Good lord baby Jesus that meeting started out HOT. A TPL lawyer was there and it seemed like people were going to start throwing punches. Overwhelming support for Eric Oliver in the room with 1 or 2 outcasts - and they were just in the middle on the issue. Where do we go from here? The TPL gods only know that. Expect a press release later today from both sides. Hold on to your chairs. PLEASE ask any questions about the meetings on this thread and I will answer as I endured the whole thing.
"Headline this morning ""Chevron to buy Anadarko for $33 billion in shale push"", Permian basin mentioned front and center. We should get some share price lift today from this news."
"Regardless of the Proxy outcome I think it will be all over for TPL management. What investors in TPLneed is a change in the management team and it may take a vote to determine if TPL remains a trustor becomes a corporation. TPL needs professional, ethical, and experienced management that willreturn investor phone calls, provide frequent updates, work for the shareholders best interests andnot against them. I hope such a transition goes smoothly and quickly, when it occurs."
"I bought in January after asking a few question on this board and got some good responses, giving bear and bull arguments. Thank you. I think this is a first for a Yahoo Finance board."
"Sorry, this this. Amazing info on Tpl. https://horizonkinetics.com/whats-new/#1st-quarter-2021-commentary"
"My take on the recent price action is that institutions are buying TPL ahead of the C Corp official announcement. Still not enoughinformation to make an informed decision as to how this will play out. The real KEY to unlocking the value of TPL will reside ina competent management team and structure. Who it will be and what it will look like I don't know. Perhaps whomever orwhatever was buying TPL shares this week does know. As a C Corp maybe TPL will be more vulnerable to a takeout downthe road. I still do not know what the two interested oil & gas companies last year had proposed. My hope is for greatertransparency and a management that is not greedy. Much will depend on the pricing of oil & gas, but reasonable pricesand a solid operating plan should get TPL to $1200 next year. Friday's price action was certainly encouraging."
"So TPL hit a new all time high today. This shows me noone really wants to sell, even around the $700 area. My view is that this goes over $1000 before year end. We may see $1500 within 2 years and $3000 within 3-5 years. Hope everyonesaw the Fortune (June 1) article on the Permian. Even mentions Loving County. Not worth selling at 24 X 2018 expectedearnings...maybe at 50 X $30, but by then we may be into 2019's expected earnings."
Some days I just love TPL. Here's a screenshot of the performance today of each item in my portfolio. https://imgur.com/a/3HMbrj3 Guess which one is the green one...
Feeling pretty good about the one share I bought back in the mid-80s for $20. It's now five shares which are currently worth over $7500. And I have a neat sub-share certificate on the wall I've been able to enjoy for about 35 years too.
"Key points for me -- 1) EPS of $5.77 beat projection of $4.54. 2) Plus a quarterly dividend pay-out of $2.75 2) Share buybacks starting up again! 4) Operating expenses cut by $6 million (did not expect that).Revenues seriously dinged by lockdown and energy price drop, but all heading back up now.DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Texas Pacific Land Corporation (NYSE: TPL) (the “Company” or ""TPL"") today announced its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2020.Conversion of the TrustAs previously announced, on January 11, 2021, we completed our reorganization from a business trust, Texas Pacific Land Trust, into Texas Pacific Land Corporation (the “Corporate Reorganization”), a corporation formed and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

"yeah Otis, it does seem that the conversion news was the trigger for this most recent dramatic rise in price. I guess signaling the end of shareholder against trustee saga. I assumed that the powers that be would have/will announced a stock split as well. I think this because conversion to a corporation would seem to support that the goal is no longer the eventually dissolution of the entity (if it ever really was). AND.....increased liquidity would likely benefit shareholders. Anyone with insights on 1) if a stock split is in likely, 2) if conversion from one legal entity to another is normally completed first prior to announcing any split?"
The long awaited Q4 earnings is out! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-pacific-land-trust-announces-213000952.html
"The Gen. Cook Q&A is out, and he seems like a nice guy, not a dynamo but also not a used car salesman. He answers the questions vaguely, but I guess that's all you can do at this point. He'll push to have management buy shares (but he shouldn't have to), better communications, more open governance. All this is good, and I feel better going forward, but where was this stuff a month ago before HK/Oliver started raising holy hell?"
"I have been a shareholder for the last 35 years. In my opinion, management has made most of the right moves that have made long term shareholders lots of money. It is my opinion that we should stick with this management and vigorously support them. That annual report is fantastic. Good luck to all."
"Craig Hodges and Murray Stahl are indeed great additions to the discussion. Their expertise is in analyzing companies. They must look at 100 prospects before investing in 1, so they know what comprises a good company. Hopefully this will now turn out OK. But only 50,000 shares less than a year ago this time? Come on! Wondering how changing to a C corp would affect the Trusts mandate to be self-liquidating? Can a corporations goal be to put itself out of business?"
"Something I read as a comment to an article about shale oil production in the Permian stated thatlonger laterals and the use of new propants are rejuvinating old wells leading to higher productionlevels. Perhaps that is why companies such as Chevron are able to increase their production . Theperson who made the claim about the longer laterals also added that the longer laterals....togetherwith the huge number of DUCs, mean that the Permian is still years away from its peak production.Just my own speculation, but assuming those DUCs may be more productive than what was intendedwhen they were drilled. Perhaps this will increase the need for water services which TPL provides.Not that any of this is new information, but it helps me to determine what is may be going on with TPL."
"XOM plans to invest $50 billion in the US over 5 years. This will include increasing oil production in the Permian in TX and NM. With all of the planned oil production increases for the Permian, that should result in more easement income for TPL and morepotential water sales. As more production is planned the demand for additional water sources should increase. I hope wewill learn more about TPL's plans for building a ""full service"" water business. Time will tell."
"So I'm going to assume the December 2020 special dividend was the last one and that we're going smaller quarterly dividends and buybacks in place of the special divs. Are you all reading this the same way? I enjoyed those March special Divs, but will gladly take buybacks in it's place. Seems a good result."
"Top 15 Energy ETFs seem to hold a total of $55 Billion of energy stocks. TPL market cap is $8.5 BillionIf top 15 energy ETFs (let alone the top 65 ) wanted to hold a 1% position in TPL now that is a C corporation they would need to buy $5. 5 billion or 64% of TPL shares. Murry Stahl, Horizon Kinetics and other activist shareholders will before year-end own as much as 30%. Float after this 94% is small.The old Trustees own zilch. I am not selling mine."
"The TPL November presentation is very informative. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/97517/000121390019023336/f8k111419ex99-1_texas.htm If I wasn't in this for 30 years already, I'd be sold. There are still unanswered questions, like why certain acreage was sold or bought? From an institutional standpoint, this all looks like manna from heaven. Very few companies have this financial pedigree, and I can see money managers saying to themselves, ""Why didn't I know about this before?"" Once we do the Credit Suisse roadshow, I can see this stock launching into the stratosphere."
"I could not resist so I just added another 100 shares of TPL today June 29 at around 702/shr to buy in before the upcoming earnings announcement. . I have 1,600 shares TPL bought in 2013 and 2014 at 80-90 (mostly) up to 150/shr, and 100 other shares bought about 1 year ago at 360. I believe TPL is quite undervalued, and we could very well see $1,200 a share with one year. Best regards to all fellow TPL very long-term holders."
"Stock staying above $800 for the retrace from NHOY was pleasant surprise. New raft of institutional buyers (who weren't able to buy when it was a trust) providing a bit of a safety net it seems. That said, I don't think earnings report this week will affect things too much despite WTI heading back up. (Happy to be pleasantly surprised again though.) Most of the gas uptick probably baked in for now. But I do think the proposed stock split will liven things up -- will mean lot more liquidity and wider range of buyers with shares are priced at, say, ~ $80 or $40 depending on ratio.I wonder if they will announce a earnings call too. That would be one for the history books.Gas sector currently has few conflicting good news/bad news scenarios while potential fracking bans are decided. Only benefits TPL in the long run as gas sector consolidates."
Wowzer. Now trading above $1300. That $1700 target price by BWS Analyst not looking so far-fetched.
"There are only 7.75 million shares of TPL because when they were a trust, their duty was to keep buying back shares until there were none left. Horizon Kinetics, which is now up to about 21% ownership in the company, was instrumental in TPL's trustees changing to a C corporation and then the trustees get to keep their jobs. Horizon Kinetics keeps buying shares, 12 here, 44 there, as few as 1 or three shares at a time since there are no commissions. I can't see TPL continuing to operate as C corporation with only 7.75 million shares so the next thing to come will be a stock split, maybe as soon as they announce their third Q earnings or in March when they pay their yearly dividend. They own 900,000 acres of land in Texas so some funds that own GLD and SLV also own TPL as a hedge against inflation, whenever that happens. I keep waiting for it to go down some to lower my price per share but if Horizon Kinetics keeps buying it at almost any price, I don't know if that ever happens until a split."
"A lot of people quested whether management needs to own shares in the Trust. Well, they just got a $1.8 million dollar bonus and I assume that it all wasn't needed to live on. Where do you park the balance? If they thought hat TPL was a good investment they would have jumped in, but not one purchased shares. They hardly bought any shares for the trust when it fell to $409. Also I just read the WPX quarterly management review and they were ecstatic over the $100mil land purchase from TPL. Said it gave them a runway for water into New Mex, and acted as if it was the greatest move they ever made. That tells me it was probably not so good for us. Stealing candy from a baby!"
Unfortunately the Credit Suisse analyst is quite experienced and the 27 page report is quite thorough. Take a look at how company overhead has grown from a few to more than 100 and the move into new very expensive headquarters. Op expenses grew $40 million over 2 years?? They seem to be doing exactly the opposite of what Murry Stahl and Horizon Kinetics were pushing for?? Some of the energy funds that bought into TPL just after it converted to CCOrp probbaly taking some profit. I sold half my position. Would buy it back under $900.
"It appears there are some TPL buyers today that have some knowledge about TPL that likely makes TPL significantly more valuable,, that the common TPL shareholder such as myself do not have access to. TPL is now up 2.5%, while the price of crude oil is getting hammered, with the loss today in the price of crude oil right now being more than 4%. This price action is indeed quite unexpected."
"Always good to have more transparency in operations and management oversight. Not always good if done through activist investors. A self liquidating trust is great. Not so if mixed up with business ventures, initiatives and adventures.....Stay in you lane....."
DanaMcGinnis (Mission) scooped up 100 additional shares Wednesday ($1342) and another 100 yesterday ($1405). BOD members/leadership with skin in the game adding to their positions at these prices means there’s plenty of room for this run.
"So I got lucky (all luck too many varables) the sale of royalty interest put it on the high side of $27 EPS. Great earnings we be going higher. Like the old Sly and the Family Stone song (Take me Higher). This is 2019 projection""$380-410M in revenueEPS of $34-#37.50""This was 2018 projection from way back.""So a quick view of 3Q tells me as I was concerned that there was some on here that were getting off the rails with projecting earnings. My projection some time ago was $25 to $27 EPS for the year. I think we will hit it. Also projected $900-$1000 on the share price. We will see. I see very good growth in the water and O&G which are more in line with growth in drilling and completing. The easement and Sundry are lumpy and are much more difficult to project. I see no issues with the report and seem to be in line with reality and reasonable expectations."""
TPL is on a path to earn $220M plus in net earnings this year. Even with the investment in water and buy backs there will be lots of cash. They will need to increase buy backs and/or increase the dividend. I think they need to pay a special dividend mid year and at the end of the year to manage the cash. We could see $8 - $12 in special dividend this year.
"March 16th, 2020 this was $353/share. In a 1 year period this has appreciated over 400%. Not bad for an unknown stock in an unloved industry, and it's not even a tech stock. You would be hard pressed to find a safer stock with a better record."
"Unbelievable rise in share price. Longtime holder of TPL and bull, even bought more through the pandemic drop in oil price. I sold those recent purchases into this bull market, but I am still holding my longer-term positions (think taxes here). I think it is difficult for even the most optimistic bulls to have predicted this meteoric rise in market cap. Any concerns that, well everything growthy and pricey is still rising in this market? It is hard to believe that reality won’t reassert itself some day and we will realize we are back in a 2% GDP world and valuations will revert to more historical levels. Or do people believe that production cuts in oil are here to stay, and exploration slowdowns will lead to diminished oils supply and higher prices going forward? If TPL was worth $850ish per share in 2018 with $70bbl oil, why is it now worth $1300per share with 2 years less of $60 oil in the ground?"
"Somebody please explain why expenses were not included in the quarterly results.. Revenues went up but net income is down, that means expenses went up massively, but you're not letting shareholders see your expenses?? Isn't it a SEC requirement that expenses be disclosed? I'm beside myself with frustration over this."
$TPL stock has experienced recent insider buying and is up -1.67%YT
"Still not clear why some are still expecting better things after C conversion. The Trust is a far better structure for an asset rich no debt operation with no margin for self interest activists. The trust protects shareholders equity the big and small assets much better. But with a C corp well why not borrow, leverage and dilute when everyone is doing it and you have minority activists to appease..... Transparency goooood luck...... IMHO"
"Hey everyone, I pitched Josh Brown and Jason Raznick on TPL in their clubhouse room on Friday. There was an article posted that gave some of the highlights of my pitch (see below). I was pretty nervous, but think I did our beloved TPL justice considering Josh said it’s one of the best pitches they’ve heard! Anyways, if you see TPL mentioned on CNBC, now you know why :) https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/21/03/20264576/the-boiler-room-stock-pitch-recap-texas-pacific-land-corp-stoneco-virgin-galactic-and-mo"
"Here is what I regard as the salient detail in today's earnings report ""Crude oil and gas production subject to the Trust’s royalty interests increased 58.5% and 119.6%, respectively, in the first quarter ended March 31, 2019 compared to the first quarter ended March 31, 2018."" TPL is clearly running on all cylinders."
"I have been a shareholder since 2012 and this is the best investment I have made - I got lucky and so did TPL. I only bought it because they had no debt and the massive amount of what I though was land worth 500 per acre as scrubland.Then the fracking revolution occurred and we were sitting on a goldmine almost for free. The current guys have not mismanaged it and the water venture was a smart move. However, I think HK needs a bigger voice since they have been in the stock since 1995.The buybacks need to step back up to the historical rate of about 2-3% and the trustees should use personal funds to buy more stock to further align their interests with the shareholders. I do not feel that the General would be bad for the trust but I think Mr. Oliver is a better pick."
"On our way to Stifel's $900 plus target. Imagine the annual meeting, conference calls and quarterly analyst presentations possible after the old Trustees are gone later this year. Stock split, more analyst coverage. attendance at energy conferences, articles in Barrons and Investor Business Daily and institutional analyst visits by Goldman and Merrill analysts...$2000."
"CONGRATS TO ALL WHO HELD THIS! With the recent price gains in energy this will continue to do well.Fracking will continue to lower the cost of production so breakeven points for producers will fall further.Eventually, pipeline capacity will become restrained again and new pipelines may be much more difficult to build. Hope management keeps this debt free and continues to reduce the outstanding share countexcept of course for stock splits. Right now this looks to ""breakout"" further to the upside. Never hurtsto take some off the table after such major moves up."
"Breaking the trend I noticed for over a year regardingthe TPL share price generally moving in the same direction with the price of oil, I noticed WTI is currently down over 3% today, and TPL is currently up over 1.5% today. TPL was also up in pricerecently on days oil was down as well. This is good TPL share performance during adverse oil price conditions is very welcome news. Perhaps buybacks are happening again, or HK is again buying TPL stock. Any thoughts from others?"
Earnings out! Stunning!!!
"I have copied an excerpt below from a Dec. 8, 2019 insider monkey article entitled ""Another Hedge Fund Bites The Dust: $350 Million in Sales Coming"" that should be of interest to TPL shareholders""White Elm's top 3 positions were Transdigm (TDG), Visa (V), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). These are all liquid stocks. For example Mastercard Incorporated's daily average volume is around $1 billion, so selling a $21 million position over a few days won't put any noticeable pressure on the stock's price. On the other hand, White Elm's fifth largest position is Texas Pacific Land Trust (NYSE:TPL) which trades an average of 15,000 shares a day. We may definitely see some price pressure on TPL shares towards the end of this year as White Elm winds down its 27,100 share position which was worth $17.6 million at the end of September.""TPL has apparently held up quite well in share price so far likely enduring some of the winding down of Elm's 27,100 shares,which translates to about 2 days of TPL's current average trading volume."
"Second attempt to briefly summarize HK’s 4th qtr. update after yahoo chewed up and spit out my first attempt. HK transcript now available on their website. 23.4% of portfolio cash, 12.4% TPL. Not entirely sure what date this refers to-could be 11/30,12/7, 12/10 or 12/31. HK blames most of TPLDecember tailspin on wasteful tax loss selling. After complying with wash sale rules people who bought back TPL are worse off than if they followed any of the Kardashians due to subsequent sharp increase in TPL price. HK indirectly tore apart Michael Boyd’s superficial Seeking Alpha article:TL/TR here. HK expects TPL to receive more money from land including easements and water than oil royalties. Even if oil price stays flat HK figures TPL will do better this year because oily co. Will net $15 more per barrel-lower transportation costs, greater pipeline availability and oil treated as Brent not WTI because being shipped to different location."
Buffet junior team visit last week???
How about today’s volume. Especially in the last hour
"TPL is trading around 27X my expected earnings of $30.00 for 2018. Historically, this trades at a PE range of 18-63...let'sround that off to 20-60. All that means is the stock could trade at a range of between $600-$1800 a share. That'sa wide range so what is a fair PE for TPL? I like to use 40 because a fair range might be 30-50. Using my 40 a fairprice for TPL would be $1200. I do think we will achieve that within a year. $1500 is doable within 2 years and $3000within 3-5 years. Going over some info on Anadarko (TPL's largest revenue producer) it seems they are still buildingout their infrastructure...which will allow them to grow their production further. Much of Anadarco's plans are in areaswhere TPL has its' lands. All other companies on TPL's lands are in the same position...building out infrastructureto further increase production. This process will go on fot at least several years. To hit my target of $3000 TPL willhave to have a PE of 50 with $60 EPS or earnings of $75 with a PE of 40. All scenarios are plausable. One factor that may be important is the future price of natural gas. This has been depressed for many yearsbut the heat waves throughout the world (more so in the US) should boost gas fired peaker plants to boostdemand...and hopefully raise the price of natural gas which is long overdue. Apache will have a large amount ofnatural gas production once their takeaway capacity comes onstream. Oil prices which I thought would fall to under $60 may end up moving even higher than they are today. My belief is the Permian will prove to be thelowest cost oil producer in the US if not the world which means production should continue to grow for at leastthe next 5 years. Could it grow even more beyond that? Will drilling efficiency improve further over time?So far my answer would be yes...but the further out one goes in time, the more difficult it is to predict. One lastthought. TPL can use its profits to buy back stock and/or pay dividends....I prefer stock buybacks over dividends!Anyone who reads this and feels strongly about it should contact Mr. Packer to let him know your opinion. They dolisten and they do take shareholder comments seriously."

"Has anyone else noticed this. A couple of things seem similar to me about patterns of stock price/volume so far this year.Since the start of the year (Jan 1, 2021) TPL has had three periods of rapid increase, all occurring over the first two weeks of the month. The first was Jan 1-15 when the stock rose from roughly 725 to 850ish, the second Feb 1-15 when the stock rose from roughly 800 to 1100 and the third was March 1-15 when the stock went from 1100 to over 1600+ dollars per share. In each case, the following two weeks (last two weeks of each month) the stock subsequently traded roughly flat or with a slight declining trend.Volume patterns were similar. All bi-weekly periods of rapid price appreciation (Since Jan 1) were accompanied by a rough doubling of the number of shares traded relative to the prior two-week period. In the February 1-15 event, volume rose from averaging maybe 20K (in January) to maybe 45k during that first two weeks of February. Similarly, the March event volume rose from averaging maybe 40K shares (last two weeks of February) to over 80K shares as the stock appreciated.Is it this pattern of appreciation at the start of each month plus larger volume during uptrends and dwindling volume as the stock subsequently trades flat or negatively biased for the next two weeks the reason people feel that it is institutions driving the share price appreciation and not individual investors?FWIW, i don't really care as I am more of a fundamental guy, but this short pattern since conversion seems indicative of something. Of course that something could always be randomness........"
"Concerning price action, I'm hoping for a buyout from Murray Stahl or maybe inclusion into the S & P 500 if we can increase the daily trading volume a little higher.For all I care, I hope everyone is also piling in because ETF's and mutual funds need to buy. Momentum traders are equally welcome."
"Five days ago “Frank” posted ""no one wants to see the entire Trust sold off in one fell swoop."" And I replied; “Frank, that's likely just what is going to happen within a couple years of converting to a C Corp.” And I promised to write a little more about my opinion. Below is my viewpoint on the subject of TPL being bought out following its conversion to a C Corp.I find it perplexing if not bothersome that most of the posters here are focusing on “Oliver vs Cook” and ignoring the more significant issue of Oliver’s patron (HK, etal) of aggressively pursuing converting TPL from its current Trust format to that of a C Corporation.To cut to the chase for those who don’t want to read details, I believe that should TPL be forced to convert from its existing Trust to a C Corp, the clock will immediately start ticking on its buyout: likely to happen within 18 months, if not sooner. You may think that’s a Good Thing, but you may be dismayed not only at the purchase price, but at your loss of voice in the matter. While TPL remains a Trust and has at least two loyal Trustees to its existing charter, it can prove very difficult to “divide and conquer.” And personally, I believe this is THE Good Thing.Those who look to HK and its partners as some sort of ally in the current affairs should be reminded that HK is acting in the best interests of its own investors, and not necessarily the current investors in TPL. The fact that HK has been rebuffed twice in recent months by TPL regarding buying out TPL and continues to pursue gaining control of it should really be a red-flag warning to other shareholders in the company. HK currently owns ~25% of the outstanding shares. If you look at their ownership record (available for viewing in the “White Proxy”) it is easy to see that they have a well-established practice of day-trading TPL at times as high as approaching 50% of daily volume. The fact that HK is continuing to aggressively pursue TPL should be considered de facto proof that, in their own model, they see TPL having some large future value. Let’s assume just for the sake of the argument that this is $4000 per share five years from now.TPL investors should also note that in a C Corp, the Board of Directors, although ostensibly representing the interests of all shareholders, in truth typically represents the interests of the major shareholders who got them the position. It’s just the Golden Rule (i.e. whoever has the gold, rules…). One should definitely keep in mind that, should TPL be forced to convert to a C Corporation, the BOD will likely vote with the major shareholders.Let’s consider one likely scenario if TPL is somehow forced to convert to a C Corp. Let’s assume that HK, etal continues to own 25% at this moment. And let’s also assume that there are two other HK allies who are interested parties (A & B) and who just happen to own slightly less than the 5% limit for reporting. Now there are 35% of the shares that can be expected to vote as one entity. Who are A&B? Well, who were A&B this past winter?By accumulating shares at the rate of only 20% of the average daily volume, HK can achieve 51% ownership (i.e. controlling interest) of the shares outstanding in just 344 trading days (about 18 calendar months). During this interval, one would expect the share price to increase due to increased demand, but probably not dramatically. The time interval to achieve controlling interest could be even shorter if HK attracts another ally or two who are currently block owners of TPL stock.HK then forms a consortium. We’ll call it “TCFAB Enterprises” or just TCFAB for short. TCFAB goes to an investment bank and secures a loan sufficient to purchase the remaining 49% of the TPL stock. Let’s say the agreed upon price is $1200 per share which is a 10% premium over the then current share price. That would be roughly $4.5 B.TCFAB approaches the TPL BOD with the offer, and since they already represent 51% of the shares outstanding, the other shareholders have zero say in the matter. The BOD rubberstamps the proposal and the TPL Inc. is absorbed by TCFAB. Even if the “minority shareholders” attempt to take legal action, they have essentially no recourse because the 10% premium over current would moot any “usurping a corporate opportunity” arguments that the minority shareholders would attempt.And here’s the kicker: if HK can pack the BOD with enough pro-HK members, they don’t even need controlling interest to pull off the acquisition: just a firm majority vote.Two years hence, old TPL shareholders may find that the asset value of the now extinct TPL would be somewhere in the $4000 per share range. The shareholders of HK are shouting Huzzahs over the brilliance of their business acumen. And old shareholders of TPL can look themselves in the mirror, and with their best Foghorn Leghorn drawl declare: “Boy Howdy, wuz ah evah Schnookered!”Just be very careful with what you think you’re voting"
"Welp, chair 1 and chair 2 are back in their home court of the midwestern. After a long 24 hours, I can say that I desperately need to take a chair. When all is said and done, the meeting looked like a second grade classroom after someone tells the kids they can’t go out to recess and barbecue. Horizon says they won. TPL calls BS. But the only voice who matters from here on out is the court. The only IMPORTANT question is: Was that meeting legal? If Yes - Eric Oliver is your trustee. If No, hold on to your chairs because it will open up a new fight. To reference the great Charlie Daniels, Ain’t no cowboy hat in Dallas if this TPL thing does not blow up in someone’s face. As shareholders we want this to be resolved ASAP because guess whose money their using? I can tell you it for sure isn’t Danny Glover’s money: it’s our money. Let’s hope this can be done as civil as possible and we all make some money!"
"Sometimes stocks overshoot our expectations on both the upside as well as downside.This is what happened with TPL in early June with its move to $708. I must admit I amfearful of a further stock market decline here. When the world's economy does reboundoil prices should rebound and that, in combination with the massive number of DUC wells(WHEN THEY GET COMPLETED) along with the water needs to accomplish that ... should bequite interesting. My advise to serious TPL investors is to follow what CVX is doing in thePermian, and extrapolate that to TPL. Takeaway capacity should be much better goingforward than it was in the past. Big events that could happen to impact TPL may includea stock split (long overdue) and option trading (which the big institutions benefit from.)TPL my be a good trading stock going forward, especially once option trading wouldallow a holder to sell covered calls. TPL is financially safe, but only so long as theystay free of debt. Time will tell on that. Given the very long term uncertainty overthe use of fossil fuels as well the potential for management to create new sharesto reward themselves with, this should be for trade. Maybe management willsurprise with shareholder friendly policies down the road...but I would not holdmy breath for that. TPL still has unique assets and a good management woulduse them to unlock shareholder value. My best advice remains to accumulateon the sharp drops in price, and always plan to buy even lower when thosedeclines manifest. (PS...with regard to COVID-19 consider taking Vitamin Dsupplements...and getting enough Selenium through Brazil nuts, organ meats,and mushrooms...but do your own research as to why.)"
Bought 2600 shares in 2001 at $4 per share. My financial advisor in 2002 told me to keep it forever because it will keep going up as the land is sold off. He died a year later and other financial advisors that I have worked with don't understand this stock. Half of the shares went to my wife when I divorced. Sold half of my 1300 shares at $225 and kept the rest. My remaining 650 shares just crossed $1milliom today. OMG Will hold for now.
"Murray just mentioned his new actively managed ETF (INFL) The Horizon Kinetics Inflation Beneficiaries ETF. The product went live January 12th and holds 8.21% TPL.... I believe it's the only HK ETF. I see this as a very positive development, could be playing a big role in the increased institutional and retail investment."
"I note that we are down over $100 per share today on a volume of only about 16,000 shares, so no need to worry in my opinion. Although I did not read the credit Suisse report, I suspect the writer of the report failed to consider the value of the unencumbered land held by TPL amounting to almost 900,000 acres, a substantial part of which is in the Permian basin, and is thus quite valuable."
"What is being missed by many posters here is the motivation(s) of each side:Horizon Kinetics owns a huge number of shares. They quite literally have a vast fortune at stake here andare very concerned that the future prospects of this vast treasure may be ""spoiled"" by management. Whywould they think that? Simple, a lack of skin in the game by management and no recourse for bad actions.TPL management, does not want anyone disruptive to their situation. For management they sit atop a vastfortune that is not theirs, but they have all the power over it as an owner would have, My question is this. Ifyou were in their position what would you do? One threat is that if they become a corporation they could bevoted out. They do not want their very lucrative jobs to be threatened or come to an end. Sadly, there is nocorporate governance in place and they can abuse their powers if thy choose, such as selling off lands forperhaps a dubious reason.Right now a lot of dirty laundry is being aired in public. Perhaps this is a good thing because it opens anarrow window into how the Trust operates. I pray that all shareholders here will take the time to look atthe arguments of both sides before coming to a decision. It is, after all YOUR property."
"Just for some perspective for those on this board to evidence the relative strength of TPL in the oil and gas sector, I note that large oil and gas companies such as XOM and, CVX (which I am a significant shareholder, besides my much larger $ investment currently in TPL which has grown considerably over the years that first got in in 2013) and BP, to name a few, are at 52-week lows, some at five year low too such as CVX. TPL is a true beast of a stock, being nowhere close to 52-week low, and with a five-year return in excess of 400%. Best regards to all TPL shareholders."
"A Very Bullish Report From Shell! Shell will invest $3 billion per year for the next 5 years. They increased productionto 250,000 BOD in December, an increase of 100,000 BOD for the year. Shell claims the Permian will provide themwith 30 years of tier 1 drilling locations. Some years ago I read that Shell had new wells drilled around Mentone, TXthat would be profitable even at $20 oil. Guess what county Mentone is in? The recent Shell report is further confirmationthat the Big Boys, i.e. Chevron, Shell, and Anadarko (Oxy) are in this for decades to come...3 decades apparently.This answers one question for me regarding buybacks...Yes! TPL should re-establish share buybacks to build value.One caveat by Shell is that there is a need for more infrastructure, especially takeaway capacity. (But I'm sure thereis need for more roads, power transmission lines, and water lines.) Imagine what returns will trickle in to TPL fromthe $15 billion that Shell will invest in the Permian both directly and indirectly. To find the Shell story it is a newsitem on Yahoo. Read it! If you understand what it means, it means a lot."
The C Corp deal not looking so hot. I hoped for the best but preferred keeping the self liquidating trust albeit with better management. There was certainty in increased value with progression of the liquidation (regardless of how long it took) - I have been on this train for 2 decades. Will stay on it but suspect this will end up being sold to an oil and gas company and probably no where close to what was predicted.
"Two things stand out on this release. With a $20 million allocated for stock repurchases, there was only $2.5 repurchased in the first six months Do they not see $1500 as a good price? Also the average price received per barrel was in the vicinity of $40. When the price crashed, some producers must have locked in future contracts at that price. When those contracts runoff, we should hope to see price received closer to $70/bbl which should be a big boost to earnings. Maybe the conference call will clarify some issues, but look for 3rd quarter to show healthy growth"
"Would like to hear what others on this board feel the value of TPL is worth.....based on the recent 15,000 acres sale and your feeling of the intrinsic value is......."
"My very rough guess for 2018 TPL earnings per share is $20-$24. At $20 we are selling at 20 X my 2018 low end estimate.The estimate assumes that the 20% corporate tax rate takes affect in 2018. It also assumes that any deferred revenues areincome in 2018. Water may be the big wild card as we do not know when the ""full service water business"" will begin. Over the past 10 years the stock has always traded at a PE ratio higher than 15. Going forward, I believe a PE ratio of 40 would bereasonable and it would allow for an average buyback of around 2.5% per year. Over 10 years time that would bring the sharesoutstanding down by around 25% which would leave TPL with less than 6 million shares outstanding. Of course, there may be stock splits from time to time. (But you get the idea!) Not surprised by today's decline as oil prices were down today. My way to look at TPL's recent price of $400 is one should be able to return a 100% profit for each year held. If one simply bought thestock here one should get $4400 (at some point) within the next 10 years."

We need a positive press release about new committee and the resumption of buybacks.
"It seems clear to me institutions are buying TPL. I say this because several of the trades each day for the last month or so have been more than 1,000 shares, likely all being buys, and simple mathematics. At a price of let's say 1,500 per share, a thousand shares of TPL cost $1.5 million dollars, and 4,000 shares cost $6 million dollars. It's hard for me to imagine more than a few individual investor spending over million dollars on a single stock position.Best regards to all TPL longs. I've been a shareholder since 2013, and do not expect to be selling any of my shares anytime soon regardless of the share price."
"Some thoughts from going over the 10-Q:1. $19.42 million was used as a capital expenditure on water. That's around $2.49 per share.2. A total of 15,916 shares were bought back. Works out to $1.33 per share.3. Net working capital is being kept at a healthy or high level. (money that could go to buybacks, dividends, or water.) My best guess here is that TPL is planning to place more cash into further capital expenditures int the water business. Why? Because that is where future growth will come from. Now is the time to get situated for this solid revenue stream. (Pun intended.)"
"Looks like last few times TPL held over $800 > crude prices were grounded in tha mid-$60 range... recent volumes indicate new flow$ coming in to moi... mebbee some roll-over from Permian stocks that have lost their investor appeal related to debt; or simply higher TPL profile due to Stifel and/or anticipation of C Corp conversion... doe remain curious about the 4Q land swap & it's purpose... but doubt all thangs will be revealed sooner r later... it's always been a ""read between the lines"" fer moi... but then Iz feels tha same way 'bout mah XOM & EOG holdings... geaux TPL..."
"Today April 15 oil is under $20. TPL closed at 535.53 yesterday. Right now I think TPLwill hit 300 before it hits 600. Of course, it only an opinion. If I was able to take a profitI would do so here. If I was looking to buy I'd wait. I feel very skittish here about TPL,the price of oil, and the stock market. I would not be surprised if the markets retestedtheir lows. Just my honest opinion and I could end up totally wrong."
"To understand TPL (without any analyst coverage) one must look at those companies that operate on or around TPL lands.The most significant is Chevron which operates in Culberson County...they will invest over $3 billion in Permian Shale with much of it in that area. Apache, of course is famous for the ""Alpine High"" play in Reeves County, where APA has assembleda monster land position. What struck me about APA recently is that some analysts think it is a takeover play with both OXYand APA being interested (or at least have been in the past.) Why is that of interest? Anadarko (APA) operates in Loving and Reeves Counties where they were partnered with Shell Oil. Obviously, if they are interested in APA they have reason to believetheir Reeves County land holdings will be productive. Keep in mind that these 3 counties are key to TPL as they own significantpercentages of the surface lands of those 3 counties not to mention royalty acreage. These are not only areas that will producefor decades to come but they will be responsable for the US becoming the largest producer of oil in the world. Right now a lot of this is still in a set-up phase. The oil is there, they know how to extract it profitably, they plan t do so at a 30%(my estimate) production growth rate for perhaps the next 3-5 years. All of this will present growth for TPL in easement androyalty income. The big wil card will remain water as TPL may decide to begin operations of its ""full service water business""which is not yet in operation. Yes, TPL is selling (brackish) water used in fracking and that is growing...but it is not yet a full service water business which would include water recycling and disposal. The demnd for water will increase as production ofoil goes higher. NOONE HAS YET DETERMINED WHAT THE SCOPE OF THE FULL SERVICE WATER OPERATIONS WOULD MEAN FOR TPL. Honestly, noone knows what the implications will be from the increase in oil & gas production either.All of this bodes well for TPL earnings over the next few decades. Could $5000 be possible within 10 years? Figure a buybackof at least 2% per year we would be around 6.24 million shares outstanding X $5000= $31.2 bilion market cap. T support thatwe would need around $200 million in net income per quarter. Sooner or later that may be doable, much may depend on thelong term price of energy which we cannot predict."
"Another great quarter by TPL due to its great assets! Once again, very disappointing to see absolutely zero shares repurchased by management. I'm really not shocked at this point as each share that is repurchased is more power for Horizon Kinetics (buying shares pretty much daily) /Oliver Group, and all of us (the shareholders). Obviously, this is a risk to the management team (which hold very few shares) and their future multi-million dollar paychecks at the shareholders expense. With this said, I really don't expect to see any repurchases at all going forward with this current management team/Board which is terribly disappointing. It's very upsetting especially with $300mm of cash currently on the balance sheet and the $16.4mm the management team blew on legal expenses this past year. We could have repurchased approximately 400,000 shares at $700 per share the past 12 months for instance and still have cash left over for a decent dividend. That alone would have erased 5% of shares. TPL should easily be over $1,000 per share if the status quo was just followed like previous years. Our EPS would have been so much more beautiful and we would be soaring to new heights right now and going forward. The assets are elite and the majors are only increasing activity. The best is yet to come...I just hope management doesn't implode it."
No changes proposed in proxy filed today. Stock seems headed down to Credit Suisse $800 target
"I've only had this stock for a few months and I still can't believe it's not talked about more or brought up in other investing circles around the internet. I don't know if the lack of talk is good or bad, but as long is it keeps doing what it's doing then I can't complain."
Anybody worried about earthquakes in the Permian being blamed on fracking? How will this affect TPL’s ESG score? Will this scare off big institutional investors like Blackrock who promote these sorts if things? Seems like there is something holding TPL back?
"Thanks, all for your thoughtful responses to my last question. Here's another one... Over the weekend a friend speculated that a couple of Big Players would like to buy TPL in its entirety. I don't have a lot of experience with mergers and acquisitions. If someone scoops it up in the next few months, would the average investor end up getting stock/cash worth 1) about today's price of $670, 2) less than today's price, or 3) more than today's price. Another way of putting it: if you knew for a fact that TPL would get scooped up soon, would you buy, sell, or hold?"
"Today's announcement could lead to $1,500 in a year?""In consultation with the Trust’s advisors, the Committee unanimously recognized compelling reasons to move to a corporate structure. The Committee will continue to work with the advisors to make a final recommendation to the Trustees as to the structure of such conversion or reorganization. """
"$451.90 bid after hours immediately after market closes. Yes...Bid. WTH is going on here? Something deep and focused is at play for sure. Your thoughts, Glenn?"
From chair 1 and 2 Merry Christmas and a Happy New year my brothers!! TPL closing out the year strong and with positive updates from conversion committee. God Bless America and God Bless TPL !!
This stock has turned into a sh!tshow ...peaked at 1700 when oil was 60-ish and now at 1150 when oil is at 80ish
"To me it looks like the trustee issues will be settled in the court system. I still would not be surprised if someone orsomething decided to make a takeover attempt to take advantage of the management distraction. The offer thatTPL management made to H-K seems disingenuous and looks to me like a smokescreen to prevent a focus on thereal issues which is who are to be the legal trustees. Imagine if the court would decide to have new elections for2 trustee positions! Put yourself in the courts position and ask yourself how they should determine who are thelegal trustees? With 2 trustee elections possibly tainted the court may call for a new election for both. MaybeChevron will make a move? Perhaps some billionaire could accumulate a stake. In any case, any declines inTPL shares do not seem to last very long or drop very far. One ""tell"" will be to watch the volume."
So a quick view of 3Q tells me as I was concerned that there was some on here that were getting off the rails with projecting earnings. My projection some time ago was $25 to $27 EPS for the year. I think we will hit it. Also projected $900-$1000 on the share price. We will see. I see very good growth in the water and O&G which are more in line with growth in drilling and completing. The easement and Sundry are lumpy and are much more difficult to project. I see no issues with the report and seem to be in line with reality and reasonable expectations.
"If TPL wants to put some of that accumulated cash flow to work, a nice fit would be buying a smaller royalty company like Freehold Royalties (FRHLF) who have producing royalties in Alberta and are expanding their Permian portfolio. Smaller, growing rapidly and has a nice 6.5% dividend. That would be sticking with what they know, royalties"
"Yep. Great time. If you got in at $5.00If you bought in at $1,700 well...maybe not so much."
"Monthly Report due this week (Friday I guess)... will it be another Turkey or are we going to get some details on this road show? I'm guessing we start to get some detail, 3 months in and I think it's fair to get more info on what's being discussed in the board meetings as well as the approach to potential shareholders. Thoughts?"
"The price chart of TPL has almost the same shape today as crude oil, except that the moment TPL is down a somewhat higher percentage. I suspect if the price oil at least stabilizes in the near term, TPL will promptly move back over $900/shr in fairly short order."
"Volume has been above average since low of $409. Clearly buyers finally got a bargain including myself, been here for 4 years. I would not be surprised if we break all time high within a few months."
"Existing TPL trustees talk about increased transparency. Well, explain the purchase of the Beech King Air E90 turbo-prop aircraft by TPL Holdings, LLC in 2018. Neither the aircraft purchase nor the existence of TPL Holdings, LLC was disclosed in the 2018 annual report. Also, why does Hutchison Oil & Gas Corp use TPL’s address as its address? What is TPL’s relationship to Hutchison Oil & Gas Corp?"
"I completely understand the frustration with the volatility in share price, including many of the probable causes of the recent share price decline. Volatility with a thinly traded stock impacted by commodity prices is almost a given. However, IMO the larger issue is the management of the underlying value of the trust holdings, which is largely determined by the amount of recoverable oil that remains in the ground. For every drop of oil (and NG) removed (where the Trust takes its royalty/earning) the underlying value of the Trusts holdings declines. The price per share of the sub cert may still go up as the rate of asset depletion goes up…but only for a while because the real assets of the Trust are declining. This makes management of those “earnings” more important that say earning from Microsoft or Amazon where earnings do not equate to assets depleted. A dollar (unit of oil) squandered on lawsuits or airplanes can’t be made up again with a new product line. The Trust doesn't really control the rate of asset depletion or price paid for per unit of depletion. It does control deployment of earnings be it buybacks (owner own more of a declining asset), dividends (owners are paid like most Royalty trusts), buying other lands (increasing assets) or capitalizing a water business (develop additional sources of earnings). This needs to be done with more consideration than I believe we are currently seeing. Good management might use share price relative to recoverable oil (and other things) to determine if buyback is the right choice. When current share price is above per share value in recoverable oil then dividend might be more appropriate. (no idea about the water side or land buys…...) I see no evidence that the current trustees care to put forward this little an effort or communicate their strategy to owners. The devil you know is still a devil (pitchforks included)."
Why is this going down so much? Is it time to sell?
"Here are my thoughts on oil prices. Given all of the demand destruction, can production be curtailed longenough to finally stop sub-par energy developments? Will these boom and bust oil cycles continue? I donot know, but I see TPL as the safest oil stock on the planet. My advice is for investors here to hold someTPL for the long term just in case oil prices spike from some unexpected event. By all means have a tradestrategy in place to take advantage of the volatility. Right now I believe we will see 300 before we see 600.If one can buy TPL during the sharp declines...at 20, 50, or even 100 dollar intervals...great! Sell some ofthose on the way back up. I may not be able to guess the highs and the lows but with a simple plan in placeone can make money on the ups and downs if one is patient. I still am waiting for management to give ustheir game plan going forward."
What a great stock!!!
"What might drive this up further? My theory:1. Investors Business Daily (IBD) uses a ranking system for stocks in its paper with 1 the lowest and 99 the highest.2. The rankings are for earnings, relative strenght, and a composite score.3. TPL scores 98 for EPS, 97 for relative strengh, and a 99 for composite. These are fantastic numbers!4. IBD does not always highlight the stock because of its low trading volume. A stock split would correct this.5. TPL's IBD numbers will continue to improve and should become a 99-99-99. (And may stay there for a long time to come.)6. With solid earnings gains going forward this ""run"" may continue for years to come.7. Is it too late to buy TPL because the price is too high? No! (Especially if you can hold it for over a year.)8. My best advice, buy more (if you think you should) on pullbacks."
Guessin recent price drop more related to ‘21 Capital Gains tax rate benefit as compared to anticipated increase in ‘22 tax… just takin some chips off tha table… expect rebound down tha road in Jan… geaux TPLC
"TPL followed oil down and will eventually follow it back up again. How low might this go? A record low PEwould be around 15. To hit that PE the price would have to hit $390 this year. I doubt this goes below $400.Next year TPL's EPS will get a boost from the $100 million sale of land (if done with 1031 exchange) couldadd up to $11.90 in EPS for 2019. While I can't predict 2019's EPS, having that $11.90 from a land sale willbe a very nice boost. TPL has zero debt and receives royalty and easement income without any out of pocketcosts. Water Services may be expanded further and in time may provide revenues greater than easement andoil & gas royalties. Given the quality of the companies providing the greatest revenues to TPL and ""their"" developmentplans, oil & gas volumes net to TPL should continue to increase. What prices oil & gas will sell for one cannot predict.At some point, prices will recover and so will the price of TPL shares. Unlike many E&P companies around with debtit is comforting to know that TPL remains debt free and cash rich. Ultimately, TPL's share price will hit new record highsas the Permian produces record output year after year. For those who thought TPL was too rich to buy, now may beyour chance to load up...always mindful of the volatility inherent to a thinly traded stock like TPL."
"Today' Bloomberg article notes caution for TPL at the end of the article with the wording "" Warning SignsStill, there are warning signs: At current prices, TPL is trading at a price to earnings ratio of 46.41, higher than Apple Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google’s parent, Alphabet Inc., and resembling valuations seen during the dot-com bubble.""What a poor comparison of TPL particularly to Apple (mostly hardware, so quite misplaced), but also Facebook and Google (both mostly software) which unlike TPL have significant staffs and other overhead."
"I saw an article this morning about electricity in Europe, and they are needing to shift to coal and gas to cover shortages in wind. They mentioned importing LNG from the US. Anyone know if gas from West TX makes it all the way to Europe? Even if not, it will put pressure on the price which should bode well for holders of TPL."
"so who is nosing around here? Daily volume explodes, steady buying each hour.will be interesting to see what unfolds, but bigger money now is arrivingsince they changed to a common stock"
Any reader of this message board that has interest in knowing more about TPL and the field in which it operates should subscribe to the blog: https://tpltblog.com/. It is a wealth of information and probably the best independent resource out there. Kudos to whoever is running it
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/texas-pacific-land-corporation-releases-110000968.html
Any speculation about the effect that changing policies on Alaska National Wildlife Refuge and/or Keystone XL pipeline projects would have on the value of TPL? Seems like limited supply from other sources would only raise the price on West Texas oil. Good for TPL.
"I appreciate the research being done by others on this board. I did spend a little time on the blogsite and I too am concerned with the current direction being ""planned out for us."" I really do not want TPL to turn into a C corp. I very much want it to continue as a Trust. I would support the idea of a subsidiary C corp being spun off, either wholly owned or partly owned for additional business ventures. I also don't believe that, just because HK owns 25% of TPL, they should dictate future business organization. There should be recourse to all the shareholders and the current Trust board members should act on that. So, I guess the next thing to do is to start writing TPL. I've talked with Bob Packer before, and perhaps this is where to start: write him a letter. Although I could sell my shares and move on, personally, I'd like to keep them and have this resolved favorably."
No entry until 1100.00
Nice to see TPL up $130 from its low earlier this week...hope this up trend continues into next week.
Can anyone share any resource(s) for someone who really wants to understand how this business operates? I'm talking beyond just surface level.

added 1b today. finally some guys realized that this is the best company on earth
Could pick up in late days volume mean the company is finally buying back shares?Very bullish use of excess cash flow?
"Horizon Kinetics just released their 1st Qtr commentary (20% of their funds are in TPL) and they believe that the growth in well completion will accelerate from the current 50% growth. A lot of DUC - drilled but uncompleted will come online as soon as there is pipeline takeaway availability. That wildcard could be dramatic. They also say that the water company is 13% of revenues but 64% of profits, so capital will be allocated to this venture going forward with big upside. The takeaway that most amazed me is that they say that the company will soon make so much net profits that there will not be enough shares out there to repurchase (only ~17,00 shares/day), hence the special dividend. Going forward they feel that dividends will have to be increased to the point people will take notice of TPL as a ""dividend"" stock. No place else to put the money"
"At $800 a share which I see now TPL is that now, we are now up 29.4% year to date. Assuming we hold around $800 per share through the close on Tuesday, December 31, we should have about a 30% gain for this calendar year, beating all the major indices.Congratulations to all TPL holders."
TPL went up $27 today? Time for a barbecue my brother!!! Watermelon  included and everything. I’m working on a summary of the best moments from the TPL meeting. Figuring out how to post the link here. Get ready everyone.
"329 million in cash. If I was running this company, I would make a massive buy back over the next 3 months. At least 50 million or 42000 shares. That is by far the best use of cash right now."
"I just saw that TPL is being added to the Russel 3000. How do you expect that will affect the share price and/or volatility? I would expect that any impact would be minor, but it can't hurt. Maybe increased demand through inclusion in index-linked ETFs?"
"Because buybacks have slowed recently, I would recommend that shareholders give Mr. Packer a call at 214-969-5531and/or leave a message with his secretary telling the trust that you would like to see increased buyback activity. Personally, I'm not too worried with current management yet but I will start to be skeptical if we don't see buybacks excellerated during this price correction in the q4 earnings report. Let's hope water sales keep increasing and so do buybacks! Cheers folks!And I always enjoy reading the comments from other shareholders in this forum. Much more interesting than the comments in the Amazon, or Facebook forums!"
"This exemplifies the problem with TPL management. The special committee is supposed to give monthlyupdates. So far there is no November update that I can see. If management does not keep its commitmentsto its shareholders (owners,) then why would anyone trust anything else they say in the future? TPL managementpays itself ""Big Boy"" pay...and they behave like ""little boy"" poor management. Has anyone here had a conversationyet with the new IR guy? I challenge any TPL investors to call him up and see if they are allowed to talk to him.Please ask if buybacks are active and if they will put out a November update for 2019?"
Frankly speakin… would be enlightenin to know what %s of revenue r crude… nat gas… & ngls… fer sure producers r hedged as required by their debt structure & lenders… think OXY (#2 largest TPL producer)… mah guess is that nat gas production outweighs crude by a large margin… & those hedges won’t adjust till mid ‘22… but that’s jes mah guess… 2Q lookt bahueno to moi… sorta what Iz expectin… appears that tha movin parts have stabilized ah bit… that all being said… average crude price didn’t look ta be as affected by hedgin as nat gas… think CVX… c’est le guerre & geaux TPL Corp…

"link below to a CNN article today re the Permian basin.

Just out.....our TPL management spent $9 Million on legal expenses for the quarter. Those expenses where to maintain there position. And lofty salary.Very very sad
"S in ESG continues to hurt energy stocks. Far left Baloney!! I hate to be a repeating Parrot, but I just heard a brief discussion on Fox Business Charles Payne Program with a Woman analyst making positive projections about the overall market but having concerns about the impact that energy places on the ""social"" aspects of the market. My take is that these considerations are mostly subjective assessments based on political PR related to the latest political take on Climate Change. The U.S. has done more for improvments in the reduction of particulate matter in our environment and safe handling in energy products than any other country in the world. The so called ""consensus"" on carbon is, at best, ""Unsettled"" as set forth by Prof Steve Koonin in his latest very well received book by the same name. Too much money and light density alternative energy chasing a very unsettled cause. If it's warming, then the best studies say if we cool down this planet, thousands of people die and there is no strategy to turn that ship around. Economic impact of Greenies is poor get much poorer. We need to either change the current policy in the U.S. back to an independent satisfiier of our projected needs and selling some to friendly countries or change the way we market TPL with some creative way to say ESG is best served by highlighting on what we do best and we do that extremely well as posters here have pointed out or take this baby back again. I hope that is not the best option. I have thought TPL was growing it's way to a $2,000-$2500 close down price with only a few units left than this silly market with energy companies now telling little lies about what a great ESG companies they are (like XOM has done.....helping the march towards alternative energy and making big donations to far left progressive causes and non-profit property killers in the name of the most recent Chicago shotgun victim.) We need to get serious about this, else what presents itself as productive and freedom enhancing capitalism is Marxism in sheep's clothing."
"The TPL bus/train has left the 'station' again. Yet again, more 'passengers' want to board, as compared to 'passengers' who are willing to get off the bus/train even at the higher prices offered to get off. What a great company and stock.

"ESG rules confired by Guest on CNBCIn a post below I mentioned the issues of ESG being required in corporate listings now on the exchanges and this negatively being taken into account by some analytical firms now, like Credit Suisse and a lot of comanies now kow towing to the far left politicos, so that they support Climate Change and Critical Race Theories, etc in their public statements and contributions to folks like BLM and other radicals. We energy gas and oil companies are not being suported by many analysts so that they look good like many other like Coke, Procter and Gamble, some banks, etc. We need to get to our board of Directors and ask them to complain about this ESG method as doing us negatively bad and financially as well. You might want to surf the internet looking for something like ESG having negative impact on stocks. JMHO"
"least for now, there appears to be almost no selling pressure, with just a little bit of buying, as evidenced by the very low share volume today. If a few buyer step in, and the selling pressure stays abated, we could see a pretty fast run-up in share price for TPL.Best regards to all fellow TPL longs."
"My gut is telling me the share price is way ahead of itself. Oil prices and the 1Q report are saying toughtimes are ahead. I honestly am not certain why TPL is as high as it is right now, is there something goingon that I am not aware of?!? A number of energy stocks are behaving the same way. My advise rightnow would be to cash in some chips here. Just an opinion but this climb seems counter to what I seeas a severe pullback in the Permian. I still think we see 300 before 600. (Just an opinion.)I would not be a buyer here, for sure."
"Eeehaw... all y'all informative folks make for very intetesting reading & Iz shares yewr enthusiasm for TPL... couple of notes: approx. 50% of production comes from their ORRI in the Chevron, Anadarko & EOG wells... good news > Anadarko & EOG aren't much hedged into 2018... bahueno & in addition... the prospects for completion of the DUC wells is favorable... close to 150 of them have been identified by TPL & the conditions are supportive for the operators to go ahead & bring them in... an observation : over 1500 DUC wells currently exist in the shales... geaux figure that the drilling rig coint is ""to ah certain degree"" disconnected from the steady rise in production... it is mah opiniones that the high count of DUC wells is directly related to the lessors need to perpetuate the lease acreage by adhering to the continuous drilling clause in their contracts... n any case it strikes me that a more direct way to gauge the future levels of production at this stage of the boom would be to focus on active fracking set-ups than drilling rigs... > & too > the old guard is on the way out & the young Turks are in place... fer sure they will interpret their responsibilities to include maximizing the monetary potential from the TPL water resources... so that more sub-shares may be retired... ketch 22."
Sorry for not posting very often here (Bemo.) Looks like TPL may make it to 20X EPS of $26. (Not the $30 I predicted.)All time low was 16X EPS so we need $420 or so to get there. What it might take is a flash crash or a major marketsell-off. Natural gas prices are now much higher and that should impact EPS nicely. If we get a super cold Winterwe may have gas prices elevated through next year. If the PE stays under 20 I would hope management buy backstock exclusively at under that level. Having around 310 DUC wells is a giant increase...at some point that will openup a lot of production and produce outstanding earnings...when? I do not now. Ideally when prices of oil&gas areway up. Anyone buying this between $420 and $520 wil do well over the next 2-5 years. Nice to see all the new posters and the intelligent comments.
"as tha moving parts that impact upcoming 1Q earnings are weighed > to incl. decreased Permian activity... lower O&G prices... administrative & carry costs of water biz... corp conversion costs... it must be assumed that land sales ( big part of 4Q '19) ""will not"" be ah part... uh, thereof... mah point being that 1Q earnings geaux back to single digits... thru 4Q '20..."
Texas Pacific Land Price Target Raised to $2000.00/Share From $1700.00 by BWS Financial
"TPL is not widely known, not followed by any wall street analysts and will get a lot more attention going into 2020 as the Permian gets all sorts of press about gas, shale and water usage supporting the U.S. becoming the largest energy exporter in the world. Chenier ""LNG"" recent presentations on global LNG demand and exports are educating investors. Comments by GLOP and USAC managments in this quarter's presentations are also causing some to spread out and look for additional investment plays such as TPL."
"Once TPL is a C corp I wonder if options will trade on it. Options can allow for investors to sell puts in order to get paid tobuy TPL stock at a discount and to sell calls to take advantage of sharp upside moves if one does not mind losing their shares.I doubt if TPL will be the same TPL that many of us were able to appreciate...a debt free, low cost, cash generating, shareretiring machine. Hope what replaces it will keep the positive attributes in place. (I doubt it will.) Quality of the TPL managementwill tell the tale."
"What strikes me is that after a big jump in oil prices from a year ago, the production hasn't ramped up as fast as in the past. Oil analysts have noticed that an increase in drilling have not happened as in the past following big recoveries in oil prices. Looks to me that the majors are taking a wait and see attitude, since the recovery in price has been driven by artificial hold-backs from OPEC+. Once the over supply is burned off and COVID recedes, we will see a resumption of volume growth. This quarters numbers confirm as of now, the hesitancy of the majors."
"Welcome to $1000, friends. For years, this stock had a very solid floor. It would jump up quickly, then level off for a while. It almost never dropped. I suspect that this was because HK would ""buy the dips,"" turning them into plateaus instead of dips. We have seen some corrections recently, and I suspect that HK had put the brakes on their buys. With the reorganization, I hope we're back to the ""pause-then-jump"" without the dips."
"Pre-Corona virus, a review of the price of WTI leading up to the virus shows a barrel of WTI was at least $50 a barrel. WTI is currently now at about $45 a barrel. If we get this 10% move in WTI to at least $50 about, I suspect the TPL share price will then be over $700 per share.Best regards to all long-term TPL holders."
"I'm hoping for a big increase in water sales and another big increase in oil and gas revenues. Any month over month increase would be welcome.$7.50 per share would be manna from heaven.Anything above that we should clear one thousand per share within days of the announcement, if there is any justice in the world."
TPL looks to be ready for another new all time high. Given the price of oil being higher nowthan it was in the 2nd quarter. With higher expected production volumes by Anadarko andothers the 3rd quarter EPS should be a record (just my opinion) and help TPL to get to afull year 2018 EPS of $30.00! (Or so I hope!) I still think we see $1500 in 2019...and $3000by 2023!!! (Maybe 2024)
Wow! Strong up move today! I have no idea why.Maybe it is something we are not aware of.Anyone here know something? I'm at a loss.
"Good to see our acreage being put to use with solar farm leases. Most of our 900,000 acres do not support oil drilling, but wind farms and solar are clean with the average contract running 20 years. A great way to put to use otherwise useless land,, with minimum impact or environmental concerns"
"TPL should allow for a solar powered bitcoin miner to get their business set up on some of that heavenly West Texas Farm Land and accept rent payments in BTC and then park that asset on the balance sheet. The short term marketing benefit alone would make it worth it, then of course the long term value potential of the bitcoin... which would cost them close to nothing to acquire."
How does Credit Suisse see significant slowdown in key metrics with oil and gas prices this high and rig counts going up? $800 that’s pretty drastic is there something else going on?
"Does everyone here realize that TPL received a takeover proposal backin November, and then a second company expressed interest in January?This is in the TPL Proxy filing. Management does not to disclose suchinterest, yet they have now with the filing. Maybe management does notfeel it worthwhile to keep shareholders informed of such trivial matters.Upon doing some research here my guess is Mr. Oliver will win the Proxyvote. TPL management should understand that and move to settle priorto the vote being taken. I'm not sure what to make of the takeover interestexcept to say that it reconfirms our belief that the value of TPL is notfully reflected in the share price.Here is why a certain company (think Chevron) would want to acquire TPL:Being a huge player with TPL holding many surface acres of land in theirarea, one would believe they would want that land for greater control.One huge advantage a major player in the area would have is that theycould negotiate deals to use TPL assets to trade, barter, or sell certain keyproperties. Thus, to the acquirer, they are at a significant advantage forthemselves as well as over their adversaries. So their would be a synergy ofsorts for an acquirer. What is unknown to us are the reserves of both hydrocarbonsas well as water itself. Having no way for us (shareholders) to know any of this wecould never have an accurate idea of what TPL is worth. Quite obviously the 2 oil & gascompanies who submitted offers do have an idea of what TPL is worth (at least to them.)So what does all of this mean? Well, to me it means that management should be more investorfriendly and do presentations/conference calls. Management should define its long term strategyand inform the owners what exactly it is! Management has done an outstanding job building valuehowever I see many things they should have done but did not. One would think that because TPLdoes not have annual meetings, at least they could do an annual ""investors day"" where shareholdersor interested parties could hear from management and ask questions. One thought struck me aboutthe proxy battle (not my thought but someone elses) they would rather be represented by someone who has real skin in the game, not someone who just does it for a regular paycheck."
"I'm predicting ah 7 for 1 stock split prior to 3rd Qtr earnings report in Oct... but, perhaps as soon as the end of next week..."
"For those that do not know, a 'barrel' of oil is 42 gallons. With WTI now trading at about $45 a barrel, that calculates to just a little over a dollar per gallon of oil. This sure looks to me to be an unsustainable low level with the price of oil, which if it holds, or God forbid gets worse, may induce revolutions in the Arab world. I suggest holding tight to this gem of the stock, and adding shares if possible."
"Since it's inception in 1888, this trust has been basically running on auto-pilot. What is going on now is the first attempt to maximize value. What comes out of this committee, whether you agree with it or not, will be to unlock any untapped potential we have. I'm sure Credit Suisse has gone over all the numbers, including the profitability and risk of the water co., modern governance, and even the correct way to buyback shares efficiently. The outcome should be interesting, but I wonder just how much we'll be told. That is managements job to keep the shareholders abreast, and they haven't been too forthcoming in the past."
Investment banks like Credit Suisse (not to be confused with James Bond or the Sopranos) make the residents of Sodom and Gomorrah appear as bastions of honesty.
And TPL continues to sink like the proverbial rock. I rather expected this when switching to a C-corp. The current crop of executives need to be booted out.
"For the newcomers to this board, your thoughtful opinions and observations are welcome, but please know that we are used to a level of civility rarely found on the internet. All the drama aside, it has been a great few days for TPL. $880 is the *fourth* time this one has doubled for me. I know many of you have been in for a couple of doubles before that, too. This is also the first stock in my portfolio to push through its previous high from last fall. And I was half expecting it to be my index-matching ETF... Wish I could make it to the the Great State of Texas to shake your hands at the meeting, but unfortunately, I don't own enough shares to make that worthwhile."
My guess... today's earnings @ 6.75...
Wow is it time to get out of this? Please give you best honest answer.
"Macquarie Group Ltd. purchased a new stake in shares of Texas Pacific Land Trust (NYSE:TPL) in the second quarter, according to the company in its most recent 13F filing with the SEC. The fund purchased 500 shares of the financial services provider’s stock, valued at approximately $393,000."
Are Anadarko and Chevron TPL largest customers? Both earnings calls stated major ramp ups in Reeves and Loving counties. Looking good for the future as these really get going including Midstream.
"I've been seeing chatter on twitter and other places with some folks wondering if TPL will be bought out. Personally, I strongly oppose any outright sale of TPL and hope the majority of shareholders would as well. Even if there was an offer Monday for $1500 per share (which in my opinion is below what it's really worth at this moment based on comps etc) I would be nervous that the majority of shareholders would approve the transaction. To be honest, we will never see another combination of structure and assets like we have with TPL. The structure in itself is one of a kind and the assets are clearly one of a kind. This asset has the ability to generate returns into the not so distant future of $3,000, $5,000, $10,000+ per share with a growing dividend in the future if it is managed properly (without wasteful spending, greed, short term profit motives, etc). I just want other shareholders to grasp exactly what is going on here. We have a huge amount of acreage (400k to 500k+ net acres in Reeves, Loving, & Culberson) in the absolute core of arguably the most prolific oil field in the world. We are only in the very early innings too which is extremely exciting. There is a ton of growth ahead and a ton of returns to be had by all shareholders. Like most here I m absolutely appalled and horrified by what we have seen recently by the current management and Trustees. The lack of ownership in the company is sickening and the wasteful spending on ads is beyond reckless and appalling. It really makes you think what the current management team and current Trustees are capable of doing to sabotage TPL from seeing Mr. Oliver elected and losing control (their jobs etc). So i'm very concerned with the motives of the current management team since I have not seen a plan for the future from them. It's obvious Mr. Meyer was the glue that kept this thing together and was the perfect steward before he passed away. I like what I've been seeing from HK and Mr. Oliver recently except for one thing. Mr. Oliver discussed that he brought to TPL a couple of companies to potentially purchase TPL. In all fairness to HK and Mr. Oliver an outright sale soon is probably in their best interest with their holdings since they have a lot of exposure. They own collectively 25%+ of an illiquid stock and probably want to liquidate and retire. I do agree that a water spinoff would be nice in the next few years to buyback more shares and remove the only operational risk we have right now. As I mentioned earlier, it would be very unfortunate to see an early termination of this once in a lifetime investment. I just hope other shareholders see how unique and valuable TPL really is and to safeguard our future returns from an early termination. We just need someone that is going to be a great steward for the long haul, that is going to maximize buying back shares especially in downturns, and maintain a stable efficient operation. It doesn't take a ton of talent to manage TPL with it's structure, asset base, and passive approach but it does take a lot to screw this up. Let's keep a great thing going by being smart and continuing to question and do the proper research as shareholders. Congrats to everyone on the last decade of success. Let's keep it going into the next decade!"
This is the stock I wish my granddad bought (in addition to Berkshire Hathaway).
"Major article in WSJ today re"" Companies See Gold in Fracking Wastewater"" has a chart of the top Permian water producers. TPL not listed, but they may have missed it. Page B1. Title as I stated above. Otherwise subscriber article"
"There is a lot of speculation out there about who wants to sell out the Trust. I have followed Horizon Kinetics and Murray Stahl for many years and have read their quarterly commentary for at least 16 quarters. He is a level-headed stand up guy who more than anyone else understands the long term value of TPL. He repeatedly said that selling off the Trust would be the worst thing that could happen, and when the price was $300 he sid he would not sell for 10X that number. Now.... Oliver and Tessler are another story, but nothing happens without HK being on board. This whole thing with the dissident nominee wouldn't have happened if HK wasn't supportive. So I don't think a sale is in the works whoever wins, it just comes down to who is more qualified. I know of no other public business that appoints Trustees/directors for LIFE."
"Special Div $10 per share... Ex Date Dec 11th, payable Dec 17th. Form 10 Submitted to SEC."

"The CS price projection is a kick in the teeth. Solely based on earnings a $800 price would put us at about a P/E of 28. That's reasonable, but no debt; huge cash hoard; rising energy prices; unexplored potential. This might just be a one-off low ball prediction. A good quarterly earnings report could put that to rest. So could other major investment houses coming in with higher projections. In the long run, the fundamentals will always eventually drive the price of the stock. It's time for the numbers to show what it's worth."
Recent article on Seeking Alpha projects a 50% upside based on DCF (Distributabe Cash Flow) @ 5% . Sounds good to mehttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4298162-texas-pacific-land-trust-greatly-undervalued-dcf-basis
"Given the recent strength of oil, seems like TPL share price should be doing better? What affect, if any does Royal Dutch selling all its Permian assets to Conoco Phillips have on TPL?"
"I just keep thinking if we had bought back 10% of the outstanding float when this was $250 instead of the dividend payout, we'd be sitting close to $2000 a share now. Thoughts? No complaints though..Congrats to all those in under $100 a share! Speaking of which, who on here has the lowest basis! I'm sure there's a few sitting on $3.00 shares!"
"Waiting on the conversion was like sitting on a coiled spring. Anybody that thought that a conversion would be the death knell for this stock just has to look at the volume and price action yesterday. People were waiting for it, and are willing to pay almost $900 to get in. A split announcement would juice this stock, as would a good earnings report or a dividend increase. Murray Stahl of Horizon Kinetics in one of his quarterly updates stated that he feels that TPL is headed to $3,000 and would not exit before then. Sounds good to me"
I think the oil and gas revenue is a lagging indicator given the backlog of wells to be fracked. The leading indicator is the increase in water and easements. Point is that the oil and gas revenue given price increases and production growth related to frac catchup will start to be the big growth engine. Water sales will execrate with increase frac activity. 4q was about 20% of yearly total water sales an verses 25% in 2016 4q to full year. Reduced tax expense will have a major impact on profitability and will see that in 1Q. This is a cash generating machine and we could see $18-$20 per share earnings in 2018.
If the Kinetics Horizon and affiliates shareholder block does not use its ownership to force change and keeps the old trustees in control TPL could drop back to $800?
"I do not know whether anyone else noticed, but we have a new all-time high for TPL. What a great stock! I have been deep into the stock since 2013, and have been rewarded amazingly."

Excellent quarter but nobody mentioned the weakness: water sales declined Q/Q from 18.2 M to 16.5 M. As I previously pointed out there are signs some companies in the Permian are moving to capital preservation and reducing drilling. The reduction water sales may be indicative of that. I sure hope they know what they are doing buying $ 100M in land related to water business.
Are they buying back? How often do you think you will be able buy a share of TPL for <$1400?
"TPL for the past two months has been coiled up like a spring around $700 a share. When the 2nd Quarter ER comes out around July 31th, shareholders will see the next big move up, IMHO."
"Hey follow TPL shareholders, It's been a while since I've commented but I haven't sold or added any TPL shares since December of 2017. I was wondering, do any of you know anything about wind or solar energy activity on TPL lands? I notice they've added solar and wind in their company logo. Solar and wind energy would make sense on TPL lands due to the intense power grid which already exists in the region and the lack of cloudy days in that region. I've messaged the trust with this question and haven't heard anything back. Also, unlike some of you, I'm not overly bearish on the trust. I'm not trading the stock and am here for the long-term. My only concern is I'd like to see the majority of FCF go to buybacks over dividends. Cheers, Adam"
This article answered a question of mine. TLP in in the Alpine High area is and has been leased by first Texaco and now Chevron. It is not part of the Apache lease mass. Good article.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-07/was-chevron-smart-or-just-lucky-in-the-permian-basin
"Hope my price prediction turns out wrong! Looks now like TPL will hit $600.What happened to that fleet of Saudi crude that was supposed to hit US shores?I know for certain that I cannot predict oil prices. The Permian has vastly expandedits takeaway capacity which will now be able to handle expanded hydrocarbon production.From memory I think TPL has 697(?) DUC wells...should go a long way to boost productionas well as use a massive amount of water to get those wells up and running. Still don't knowwho management will be nor the composition of the BOD. Oil prices have rebounded much fasterthan I would have thought possible. Management SHOULD be doing quarterly conference callsand SHOULD be planning a road show to re-introduce TPL to the stock market. Given cash on handand likely earnings over the next year or so, I estimate that TPL ""could"" buy and retire up to 10% ofits shares outstanding. Of course, they will not. I wonder when management will inform us of theirstrategic focus going forward. The assets TPL owns are superb! Will the new TPL be able to intelligently exploit them for the benefit of shareholders is the question. I honestly do not haveenough information to know the answer. (So far I am wrong about the market retesting the low.)The one maxim on TPL that has proven correct once again is that the very sharp declines havebeen met with very sharp advances. Something to keep in mind for when the next sharp declinehappens. All the best to the TPL faithful."
"Horizon Kinetics and their subsidiaries keep buying TPL at any price, including yesterday according to the SEC filings. This has gone on for months and months, I'm guessing because TPL only has about 7 million shares outstanding and in order to operate as a corporation instead of a trust they are going to have to split, likely in the next couple months. As a trust, their purpose was to keep buying back shares until there were none left and sell off the land and close the trust. With the conversion to a corporation, 7 million shares isn't enough."
"Checking the Edgar's only HK and Mission are the only reporting institutions buying. It may be the amounts they are accumulating are small but it seems there are a lot of ""small"" lot investors picking this up. HK has a value of $3K per share. Concern with price was when oil was $150 TPL was $800. Was in the belly of the beast last week south of Carlsbad, Orla and Wink which is prime TPL holdings. Sand trucks everywhere. Two of the sand plants on 115 east of Kermit have started back up. Lots of activity off TX 302 from Kermit to Mentone and both sides of Orla. Heading down to Pecos next week and will get to see the southern TPL holdings."

"Speculative Question: With Chevron likely to walk away from APC, might Chevron consider a bid for TPL?Why? So Chevron would be in a better position to trade off properties with the other players. One couldargue that properties are like patents...in the right hands they could have optimal value...in the wrong handslittle value. I am not suggesting this as a proposal of any kind. I offer this as speculation only. Would TPL'sassets have greater value if held by a massive Permian player? What if an EOG or XOM came in to buy sothat they would leverage against Chevron, APC, OXY, etc. The mistake TPL management may have made is having sold off any TPL assets as the value is far greater if it is held ""intact."""
"Great find Karl!! It looks like the Beech King Air E90 turbo-prop aircraft was purchased by the TPL Holdings LLC out of Texas and without the comma. Looks like TPL Holdings, LLC with the comma is out of Pakistan. Looks like there are five subsidiaries of Texas Pacific Land Trust. Texas Pacific Water Resources LLC; TPL Holdings LLC; Texas Eagle Ranches, LLC, Texas Pacific Royalty Acquisitions, LLC; and Riverton Holdings, LLC. If anyone could find more information on Riverton Holdings, LLC and Texas Eagle Ranches, LLC that would be great. I have attached a link to Riverton Holdings, LLC below that shows it was created in September 2018 and addressed to a location in Austin TX.

"Getting close to my potential target price of 1,500. I would like to see a stock split (5-1?) in the meantime. which would open up TPL to many retail investors..I'm also on board for buy-backs. Don't really care about dividends, never have. Good luck to all current investors."

"More confirmations:1. The Permian Basin will continue to produce for decades. 2. TPL's water rights are ""grandfathered"" in because they date before 1895. I do not know the details on this except that it them an advantage over other landholders.3. TPL is only in the first innings. Last quarter there wer no land sales...this shows that the land is believed to have more value if it is used for easements and other uses.4. Caliche is being sold by TPL. This is a product that can be used for roads, drilling pad beds, and may be used in the disposal of produced water and sand.5. TPL stock may hit $3,000 within 5 years. One may want to think of TPL this way. If one were to buy TPL at $500...the potential return may be !00% return for each year held. 5 years X $500 = $2500 + your original $500 = $3,000.6. Very telling was a public statement by Chevron that their Permian wells now have an IRR (Internal rate of return) of over 30%. Understand that is an astounding number. My guess is Shell Oil may have similar numbers7. There are more drilling rigs operating in the Permian Basin today than in the entire Middle-East."
"Just my own take on earnings, they were OK. Until the BOD is officially seated after conversion,we will not know what company has planned for its strategic focus and the use of its excess cash.My belief is that management should have begun conference calls with quarterly earnings. My viewis that ""fracking"" costs will be further reduced keeping the economics in the Permian acceptable formost producers. If higher natural gas prices are maintained that would bode well for future earnings.Stock is tradable while in the $400's ...doubt it dips below that level. Using stock for acquisitionswhich are accretive to earnings while using cash to pay off debts of such acquisitions may make sense. The key will be to keep the balance sheet pristine."

"Nice to see a small rebound today. Would anybody know if any of the large institutional investors in TPL would be considered ""hedge funds""? I ask because a finance buddy of mine has a theory that much of the recent volatility and selling could be due to one or more hedge funds selling aggressively to lock in their gains. Unlike regular mutual funds, hedge funds managers typically have a fee structure that awards them 20-25% commissions on the gains they make for their investors (I was astounded to learn that). Think about it, the huge run-up of TPL over the last two years means little to these hedge fund managers on paper. It is only when they sell do they reap their massive commissions. Could possibly explain a lot of the recent selloff and large volumes because it seems unlikely that individual investors and HK would selling into this downturn."
