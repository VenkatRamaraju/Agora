I heard from a very reliable source that AVGO is going to announce a large div increase. This is not spam or bogus info. Im a shareholder of the company
Broadcom reached an all time high at 529.80
Any news driving this up recently? Kind of surprise!
What is your guess on the next dividend bump? I think we are going to be between 1.6 to 2 dollars per share.
Any thoughts on swapping AVGO for AVGOP which a conversion rate to 3.0303-3.5422 of common per preferred. Higher yield too
Just added right at low of day and will add more if drops. Ex-div tomorrow.
volume 2x ave. 30 day and just under 2x ave. 10 day. Upgrades prevailed today. Will be interesting to see how this great company ends the year. Unless Bidie & cabal completely unravel I predict this stock will close at or near ALL TIME HIGHS.

What a great stock to ADD on these sell-offs. Rebounds HUGE every time. And it should! It's a cheap stock with a HUGE dividend and in the explosive tech areas like 5G.
"Investors realizing the potential of this great company. Stock making intra-day ALL TIME HIGHS.And (compared to peers) it's still a cheap stock. Early December a divi hike will be announced and earnings should be dynamic. This will lead to more upside. Company in great businesses and 5G should be explosive.Of course, crazy things can happen. But today this is a great company in which to be invested."

"The entire semiconductor sector appears to be under fire from so called ""analysts"" that are actually jack-of-all-trades but masters of NONE. Their archaic thinking in traditional cyclical rotations of the semiconductor industry is forcing stocks prices lower. Even when most chip and equipment companies are crushing earnings, are producing at max capacity, increasing prices, and raising guidance. Global demand would be high regardless of any shortage. 5G, AI, EV, crypto, data centers, cloud tech, gaming, eSports were already ensuring this growth and demand. Now add the new infrastructure spending and the global ""arms race"" that's taking place. We are in the beginning of a super cycle like never seen, likely lasting many years. Semiconductors are the new #1 global resource....the new oil.(Fabless) companies like $NVDA, $AMD, $MRVL, $AVGO, $QCOM design the most advanced and sought after semiconductors in the world. (Fab-owning) companies like $TSM, $TXN, $ADI, $QRVO manufacture the chips. Companies like $AMAT, $ASML, $LRCX, $KLAC, $UCTT, $ICHR make all the equipment and materials used by those chip manufacturers. High tide raises all boats! .....and many of these companies are already currently undervalued. GLTA"
I couldn't be more please with the performance with AVGO and this CEO. Truly a diamond in the rough!

Lovely company…
"This stock is cheap vs. its peers. Just compare it to TXN, another great company. Today, AVGO makes another ALL TIME HIGH and it's going higher. It's a 'cheap' stock that has excessive free cash flow to use towards increased dividends, buying back stock, and acquisitions. And part of its business is in the explosive 5G.Hock Tan says level of cash is $6-8 BILLION 'above' where he'd like to see. That's means its going to go toward more divi's, more share buybacks or more acquisitions. Sweet!"
A couple months ago one of the SA writers said that AVGO could become a 100 bagger. Hoping this is the first leg of that journey.
Why is Broadcom down with Market up? Any news that we may have been missing here? Thank you
Closing at all time high today boys and girls. And it is only the beginning. Wait until the dividend increase and earnings report.
Avgo upgraded by Goldman to a buy tonight.That is why the stock shot up today as research is always released in house before the street.
Another all time high? Looks like it.
This stock is finally getting its due.
"Well, that fake chip shortage news at Apple sure didn’t last long. See ya at $500."
Sirens? This one is on fire.
dividend increase should be announced soon. I'm guessing 11.1% increase to $16.00.
"Goldman Sachs AVGO to buy and increases target price from $527 to $589. Cites outsize exposure to cloud/enterprise/telecom spending, pricing power AND FCF generation will drive a relative re0rating in the stock. That means FREE CASH FLOW will spark more dividend increases, buy backs and even acquisitions.Last few days great opportunities to have initiated or added to positions which many did. Stock given away in the low 480's just hours ago on that 'exaggerated' AAPL news."
3% yield is $480-550 based on current and forward yield. There’s your range.
Great grpwth stock and dividend and great products - should be lot higher
Hope it can hope the gain to the end of today
All time record high at the close!
"When will AVGO split the stock....been a long time and all the big chip companies are buying, merging and splitting their stocks...Whats wrong with Hock Tan??!!..."
"Expect strong quarter earnings and dividend raise, should take us to $550 range."

"Sold position in AAPL and added to AVGO, GOOGL, MSFT, TDOC, and NVDA at open."
Another 'fresh' ALL TIME HIGH just crossed....
$550 very soon..
"Took a break yesterday which, personally I like to see. I can't see how this stock is not going to be over 550 by the end of the year. Also something that people don't realize. The chip shortage will be resolved eventually. Demand not only will increase but there will also be pent-up demand from the shortage that I believe no one is accounting for. So when the shortage is resolved we will move very quickly over 600 and beyond."
