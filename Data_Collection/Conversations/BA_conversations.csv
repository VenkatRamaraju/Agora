No way Boeing can get to $300 a share this year Unless covid magically disappears tomorrow Stop dreaming and be realistic
"I believe that American ingenuity and our capitalist system that is the envy of the world. But to have one of TWO companies in the world that make product as critical as this being mis-managed is not only affecting the stock market, its down right embarrassing"
"Is CNBC (Lebow...) a shill for naked shorts scam. CNBC said cutting flights due to decreasing demand. However SW and others previously said they can't staff the flights, so reducing number of flights - more passenger demand than they can support with current staffing levels. When will SEC/DOJ do their job regarding stopping naked shorts (selling fake shares - stock fraud).An online site listed Susquehanna International Group LLP with over 10 million BA shares shorted on prior report and with over 8 million on 11 Aug. It listed Citadel Adv LLC with over 7 million shares shorted on both reports, but doesn't say if naked shorts or not. Citadel has been listed as a market maker, so can legally sell naked short (license to steal from retail investors?)."
"I don't want to see since my cost basis is so low but please I need some logical person and not shorts or day traders to convince me to hold this and in a year it will be back up to 300 ? If I can hold a year and this goe to 300 I would be thrilled. Just seems like the headwinds are killing it every time it goes up, it fall down harder. The YTD trend is still negative ?????? I'm feeling very bearish on this stock right now with 1800 shares."
"Not looking good when Cramer is saying ""dump the reopening story stocks"""
BA gonna touch at least 240 this week. Guaranteed
Delta Air Lines to add $200 monthly health insurance charge for unvaccinated staff
"The failure at 223 for 4 straight days was the kiss of death.Hen today no buyers even at 218. So who was buying Friday?No one,It was fake. They didn’t want to pay the puts bellow 220"
"Every little bit helps!!!Virgin Australia to add 9 planes to fleet ahead of expected travel reboundBY Reuters— 9:40 PM ET 08/26/2021SYDNEY (Reuters) - Virgin Australia said on Friday it would add nine Boeing Co 737-800 planes to its fleet from October in preparation for an expected increase in domestic travel as vaccination rates rise and state borders reopen.The airline said the increased capacity would bring its fleet to 77 planes and help it meet its target of gaining a one-third share of the domestic market, where it competes against Qantas Airways Ltd"
there is no reason why ba shouldn't be at 260 and heading higher
"BA will rise $20 this week. Yu heard it right here. $241.75, minimum."
"Stock closing at lowest point of the day, look for a gap down tomorrow. another 4 to 5$ drop tomorrow."
Upward movement through $265.
"One thing we can count on with Boeing is explosive earnings growth every quarter for the next 2 years…. China will soon be forced to recertify Boeing, because Boeing has airplanes ready to go and with supply chains the way they are… also explosive revenue growth from services, space and defense sectors of this business…."
"I've never seen a company this big with zero good press in like 2 months. I'm not selling, and have been a long holder. Just expressing frustration at the lack of information and guidance from this company. I remain with a long position that I believe will turn out well in the end."
"BA F-15 Saint Louis has added 500 people in the last two years. An article from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch noted yesterday. Dignitaries from the USAF and foreign militaries were “crowded a hanger” to see the latest Qatar version roll out. It says last July a contract for 8 USAF F-15EXs was signed, $1.8 billion. A budget was passed in December for 12 more, and the USAF expects to buy 144 in total. Possibly 200!Foreign sales will jump…"
probably end up closing positive today...230+ this week

"waiting to see how bad this upcoming covid winter is going to be. wondering how BA along with the other travel stocks will be doing in a few months. But that trend already started, didn't it? folks waiting on china news still, lol. Can't make this up. here ill give you your china news, add $10-15 to the stock price then you wait for the next earnings date for the next catalyst. It wont get you out of the range its been in for many, many months now!!!!"
"For those wondering what TODAY'S drop could be based on: report earlier today by Phil Lebeaux on CNBC that the airlines are reducing their flights this fall by 20% to 30% in an attempt to adjust for slower travel season. I'm not suggesting this is a valid or only reason for the stock to drop, but it could be contributing"
"People forget Boeing is not just passenger airline travel company: for instance their defense sector which is growing every quarter, and now it turns out a lot of that Afghanistan money is going to be going to Boeing… also, their satellites and space sector…."
Need new management. This is clear. Nonstop problem for years.
"MM's use BA to bring down DOW and dont bother to lift it when market recovers, if BA can be removed out of DOW ,that would reduce this manipulation. Now they short BA at the open with around 100K+ shares and keep it depressed so that DOW falls ."
I just realized today that Gail is a billionaire
"Dr. Jin Dak plans on buying another 50 shares. China recertification, India's PO for 80 jets, return of air travel, opening of countries/airports, return of dividend, strong earnings reports, diminishing inventory, expenses written off 2 years ago, cash in hand for every et, etc. It never ends.There will also be a looming crisis in the fall when airplanes are on back order. Hold on folks, this is going to be a great 2nd half of the year for BA! longs are going to make a lot of money off of this stock."
"MS analyst made a strange comment on Fox Business News last night that he’s wasn’t sure if Boeing knew how to handle the good news, let alone bad ones. He was commenting on India’s approval of Max 737 which strangely saw stock nosedive. He agreed with Cramer that current management didn’t know how to execute strategy and might have lost 20% of the new orders since last year to Airbus."
What stock price impact on BA if they announce a deal to sell MAX 737 airplanes to China? Yesterday they announced positive news on India and the stock sold off. Future sales to China already built into the stock price? Opinions please.

"Q3 is shaping up to be another beat, now is the time to load up! Deliveries are up, India approval, China approval imminent. Orders are increasing every week. BA is a screaming buy…."
"SpiceJet Ltd, India's second-largest airline by market share and the only one in the country to fly the 737 MAX aircraft, said earlier in the day it had signed a settlement with lessor Avolon on leases for the aircraft.SpiceJet has more than 100 737 MAX planes on order.Around 175 countries have allowed the 737 MAX to return to service following a safety ban, with 30 airlines already restarting their MAX aircraft services.China is now the only major market where regulators are yet to give the MAX a go-ahead. Boeing earlier this month conducted a test flight of the 737 MAX plane in China."
I don’t understand how the cases reaching 200k even after vaccination. It’s holding up Boeing stock. I don’t care about politics but USA is doing worst in terms of cases and deaths.
"Cramer ""Boeing needs to re-establish trust with FAA for sustained prosperity of the company and resolve issues amicably. It's never pays off to be in a stand off with regulatory authority"""
""" Boeing officials already have said that the MAX’s long grounding and all the costs associated with it probably shaved $9 billion or $10 billion. But some analysts have suggested that when all the legal, manufacturing and sales damage eventually is totaled up, the 737 MAX program’s loss could push $20 billion."" - FORBES"
"BOEING is about to embark on a journey to the $300s and then $400s. There are so many positives. Do your homework, but this s the best investment I see with travel returning. Covid is sensationalized and the shock lessens every day."
"India yesterday, china very soon,300 is coming let's get on board BA is back in business."
fundamentals look promising for BA. would like management to stay more on top of any safety/quality issues. safe to buy here as this stock will go up. World will not stop flying.
"buy BA now, wait for ramp up order next year when covid is under control."
I think the constant churn is coming to an end. Boeing has finally bottomed. We are spring loaded and heading to a new 52 week high. BUY NOW!!!
Reuters didn’t publish Max flying again in India. Wonder why? Print and television media is doing favors for the hedge funds and market generally. If Boeing were 300 the Dow would be 480 points higher. It’s a scam. Gotta be long - Boeing is worth 5x 100B
