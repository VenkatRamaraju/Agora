Bought some BA (bank of america in 1999) @ 40 both went up 4 points in a day
"Ba negative cash flow was only 507 millions, vs 5.08 billions a year ago. there are about 100 787 Dreamliner already built, just selling those will bring Ba well into positive cash flow, add the 737 and the Dreamliner being built and this stock will reach the moon in early 2022... Add China and there will be a 50% jump. Dod. If there is one stock to make some serious money, Ba is it."

"""Every single year for the past 5 years the airlines ETF Jets and other airline companies have ran up in November. This time there's also a massive catalyst on November 8th as the International travel ban is lifted in the US. Warning sent."" https://twitter.com/expandingmatter/status/1453883632838402139?s=20$JETS $DAL $UAL $AAL $LUV $BA $ALK"
"I think the combination of the lifting of the travel ban, internal travel by college students, and holiday travel will lead to a sharp turnaround. I expect this to begin on Nov 8th when the ban is lifted and continue through Christmas. My price target for BA come new years is $230. Let me know if you agree!"
"What a shame. My family worked for Boeing for 3 generations to watch it be destroyed in 3 years. What was a proud company is now a shell of its former self.. If the BoD is not held accountable you are sending the wrong message to the employees, suppliers, and the market as a whole.. This BoD is getting paid/compensated in the millions to basically communicate nothing."
"I know that hope is not a strategy but I have to think that we have bottomed out. It might drop to 205 or maybe even 200 but at these prices, there is such upward pressure to keep the bears at bay."
"The 21 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Boeing Co have a median target of 267.00, with a high estimate of 306.00 and a low estimate of 169.70. The median estimate represents a +29.37% increase from the last price of 206.39."
"the bottom sellers/bashers don't like to see ba heading back up after disappointing earnings, but ba was oversold months ago, moral of the story is, don't be a buy high sell low trader, it doesn't pay off.. ba is probably a buy here, it's bound to reach 300+ in 2022"
"Ill pay $3000. oo \\rid 3 cats = +shipping and handling11/21/2/33 cats for the price of 1yours, totally free"
Bought 200 shares Friday. Looking to triple my money in less than 4 years.
"ba is almost depleted of sellers, been oversold for weeks, months, ba will soon start to head back up"
"Calhoun was not positive on future China sales, which really is the only driver of this stock. He indicated on CNBC that he was ""hoping"" China would not close trade with the United States. Stocks don't trade on prayers......"
"The manipulation of this stock is very obvious, the big wigs in cahoot with the media can't say anything positive about this great company, it reminds me of when it was driven down to $89 a share, at that time it was almost impossible to find a comment that wasn't at least a month old. An order comes in for 100 planes and the headlines say that it was terrible because it should had been 101. Boeing has fallen of the map, the so called experts don't even mention it anymore. Ba is ramping up production from 19 to 31 planes a month, it is happening as of now and this so important news is not touched.... First quarter of 22 will be great. Well over 300 Max and over 100 Dreamliner are ready to be delivered, that is cash sitting there. Dod, bought another 15 today. Very healthy and profitable days ahead is my wish for all."
"U.S, Australia and the world are removing international travel ban by NOV so BA RCL NCLH ALK UAL LUV SAVE DAL start to benefit greatly."
"The risk to reward for airlines at these levels is amazing, incoming catalysts below:- Massive influx of demand on November 8th as international travel ban is lifted by the US- Holiday season demand will be higher than usual as many weren't able to travel last holiday season- Oil prices have peaked short-term and is beginning to downtrend a bit- As demand increases pricing power of ticket prices will combat elevated oil costs.$DAL $UAL $AAL $LUV $JETS $BA"
Boing is now “Earmarked” for “Disposal”... it will go down more on down days and up less on up days as large stakeholders unwind billions in shares to naive retailers who think stocks only go up forever... The smartest thing you could do is to sell now on large stakeholders nickel and escape relatively unscathed but most retail investors have been conditioned by years of fed money printing to buy any dips as bargains... Boing missed huge on revenues and it has much more debt now and will likely never make enough earnings to justify its current price.. 206.27 as I write this I will refer to this post in a few weeks when Ba. is down much lower to prove to you I know what I am talking about..Even todays big dow rally is being done to enable big money to sell more BA shares at higher prices.. can you feel it ? Imagine what will happen when the dow drops...
"In 5 years, BA will double, so that's 20% gain/year."
"Given the way this stock has traded recently, I was terrified going into earnings. I am fine with the results. If the market really looks forward and backwards, the stock can do well from here. 787 issues will get resolved and 737 MAX production sounds like it will be heading higher. The hatred and loathing of this stock just sets it up well going forward. Let’s see what they say on CC. Shorting it at $270 was a good call. Congrats to anyone who profited from doing so. I’m not a day trader and I’ve lost money on my stock position, partially offset by sold calls. But now I’m fine with just being long with no hedges and holding until, let’s say, the end of 2022. People may be liking this a lot more by then."
When will the share holders demand Calhoun’s resignation?
