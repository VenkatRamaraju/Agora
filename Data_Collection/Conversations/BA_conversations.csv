Upward movement through $265.
"One thing we can count on with Boeing is explosive earnings growth every quarter for the next 2 years…. China will soon be forced to recertify Boeing, because Boeing has airplanes ready to go and with supply chains the way they are… also explosive revenue growth from services, space and defense sectors of this business…."
"there's only one answer and its: we get your money whether BA goes up or down. you're going to need another way to get out of debt for your expensive meaningless english degree or history degree that you wasted 4, no 5 years on. lol."
"When China says yes, up 5%. When India says yes, up 5%. When orders flow in from US, India, China, up 10% each. Looking at 40% rise this quarter."
What the odds this is up 10 tomorrow?About .05%

"Boeing is one of the most important companies this country has to offer. It will double again, just be patient."
"The world needs planes to get around, so we are golden. Still has so much upside in stock price."
This  had a decent day going for about 10 minutes. The lost half it’s gain the last hour.This isn’t even close to being a good stock.Not even close.
Shorts like Urmoney and (.) Are really nervous right now. They just can't accept that Boeing is a turn around play. Rear view thinking is not going to work on this stock. If next quarter show another good earnings report this bird is going to fly.
"SpiceJet Ltd, India's second-largest airline by market share and the only one in the country to fly the 737 MAX aircraft, said earlier in the day it had signed a settlement with lessor Avolon on leases for the aircraft.SpiceJet has more than 100 737 MAX planes on order.Around 175 countries have allowed the 737 MAX to return to service following a safety ban, with 30 airlines already restarting their MAX aircraft services.China is now the only major market where regulators are yet to give the MAX a go-ahead. Boeing earlier this month conducted a test flight of the 737 MAX plane in China."
Something tells me we are about to see one of Boeing's most bullish months since 2019.
I dare this Train wreck to be up 2.00 at the open......GD dare it.I will buy puts again.

"Yup, they are talking about risk on, everything is going higher rally. BA is still way undervalued as coronavirus wave will collapse even faster than the previous one!"
Is calhoung the greatest CEO in Boeing history? Thumb up is yes
"Aug 31 (Reuters) - British airline and holiday group Jet2 unveiled a deal to buy dozens of Airbus jets worth $4.9 billion at list prices on Tuesday, switching loyalties from U.S. planemaker Boeing. However Ryanair CEO says he could buy 250 737 Maxx jets if the price was low enough. They do not expect a deal in 2021 though."
Nice volume today and hope to see $230-240 this week!
I own the stock. I am holding on $130 entry. Patience is a virtue in this instance. The stock will surge once this covid issue is settled. And travel open.
"BOEING is about to embark on a journey to the $300s and then $400s. There are so many positives. Do your homework, but this s the best investment I see with travel returning. Covid is sensationalized and the shock lessens every day."
"Red market day, no biggie. BA will gap up again soon."
"The chart is looking excellent. Slow stochastic is high, RIS climbing but still has a lot of room to run. I don't think it's unreasonable to maybe see $245 this week and a return to the $260-$270 area in the next few weeks."
"The airline, Akasa, backed by billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, has also held discussions with Airbus for its best-selling A320neo jets, but that model isn’t available for delivery until several years down the track, tilting the equation in Boeing’s favor, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential.The talks aren’t finalized and could still fall apart, the people said. Akasa, which is seeking initial approval from India’s aviation ministry, plans to use sale-and-leaseback deals to finance the planes, one of the people said. This would allow the new airline to receive cash from leasing firms as it takes possession of the jets.Jhunjhunwala’s new airline is looking at operating a fleet of 70 aircraft in four years, the businessman said in a Bloomberg Television interview last month. An order for 70 units of 737 Max-8 jets -- the most popular model -- would be valued at $8.5 billion at sticker prices, although discounts are common in large plane orders."
"Relax people... BA is building the planes as we speak. Nothing has changed since yesterday - still working thru the big backlog they have ...today , tomorrow and in 5 yrs from now"
Is this really necessary from WSJ? United jets with engines involved in Denver incident may not fly until next year -
Looks like we gonna see some green tomorrow BA will probably gain 0.01% lol
"Online story indicates new SEC rule (153c...) limiting some of the naked short selling stealing is taking effect 23/24 Aug. It should be a big boost to Boeing (Gamestop, etc.) stock if market makers aren't allowed to steal as much (depress prices) as they have been doing since Jun. It seems strange CNBC won't cover a major story with very positive upside to retail investors."
"Q3 is shaping up to be another beat, now is the time to load up! Deliveries are up, India approval, China approval imminent. Orders are increasing every week. BA is a screaming buy…."

"mountain of 225 options being bought up today expiring friday, lol. gl with that."
Would you fly on a 737 max ? Thumps up for yes
see they have to make you think 219.50 is some sort of resistance and try and get you to sell your calls and buy puts here.Then tomorrow its 225. Sure buy a few puts........as long as they are just hedging to allow you to stay comfortable in your long shares or calls
This is all fixable stuff and exaggeration to cause oversold i for one am glad we are holding them to a high standard and investors aren’t putting up with bad management from now on there shall be little miss management tolerance.
I just realized today that Gail is a billionaire
BA is a minimum $345 stock selling for $220 and change.

So here we are again 1/2 way back from 240 crash. Thumbs up for 230 before 210 again or thumbs down for 210 before 230. I’m long by the way …

Back the truck up. Cramer said to buy Boeing.
All travel stocks were down today. Covid is going away. Better days ahead. Like $350.
"Nice to see BA gaining premarket traction again, 5 days in a row. Trends mean everything. It won'y be long before BA is $400 again."

not sure why anyone keeps this except to day trade and trade options. no real long-term value here.
What stock price impact on BA if they announce a deal to sell MAX 737 airplanes to China? Yesterday they announced positive news on India and the stock sold off. Future sales to China already built into the stock price? Opinions please.
$500 stock next year.
These little 3-4 moves is just to sell calls.So o sell the calls also and buy puts.

"Wall street will continue to manipulate Boeing stock price to below $200 a share, then they will buy back. They will wait until China approves 737 Max to fly back, then they will jack up the stock price to $300 a share. That is a way that wall street makes money.We are the normal stock holders, we have to calm down, and do not get panicked due to the stock situation this week. Otherwise, we will become the victims of wall street.Remember, wall street has no mercy to anybody."

With pent up demand building daily there is no way travel stocks stay here much longer.
$233 by 4pm EAST Friday.
"waiting to see how bad this upcoming covid winter is going to be. wondering how BA along with the other travel stocks will be doing in a few months. But that trend already started, didn't it? folks waiting on china news still, lol. Can't make this up. here ill give you your china news, add $10-15 to the stock price then you wait for the next earnings date for the next catalyst. It wont get you out of the range its been in for many, many months now!!!!"
I’m seeing a lot of shorts desperately trying to bring BA down.
I am enjoying the opportunity to add at these prices. A Merry Christmas it will be!
Nice Apache Helicopter deal. Another 487 million dollar contract landed.
Shorts consider this a gift so you can cover. BA will close in the green today so you better act now.
BA wants to be higher. The DOW is holding it back.
India's MAX planes will be in the skies soon; they just approved.
I have yet to know what Boeing’s management and board cares about.It’s certainly not safety.It’s also not profit.Seems like they only care about conspiring with the shorts.
When I’m wrong I own up and say I’m wrong.I thought 219.50 was the top today. I sold all my call bought at yesterday’s close as a hedge at 219.41 and added a few 220 puts. I could have gotten so so much more for my 215 and 217.50 calls. And my 217.50 puts are worthless.
I expect $230 this week on the India news.
Soon enough the desired trade will be long BA at these grossly oversold levels. Buy now before that time gets here.
"Qatar Airways has confirmed that it has grounded 13 Airbus A350s over what it described as an issue whereby the fuselage is “degrading at an accelerated rate” in the long-range aircraft. In its statement, Qatar Airways said it had been monitoring the degradation beneath the paint on the fuselage of the aircraft for some time. It described the issue as a “significant condition”, without elaborating.“Following the explicit written instruction of its regulator, 13 aircraft have now been grounded, effectively removing them from service until such time as the root cause can be established and a satisfactory solution made available to permanently correct the underlying condition” the airline said in its statement.Qatar Airways has a fleet of 53 Airbus A350s in both its 1000 and 900 series. It was the launch customer of both aircraft types. The airline has another on order with the Toulouse, France-based aeroplane manufacturer, making its total order of 76 aircraft — the most of any airline worldwide. In June, Qatar Airways said it wouldn’t take any more A350s unless the problem was resolved."

"Susquehanna & Citadel Hedge Funds have shorted almost 20 Million shares , look for 197 in a few days . When such a huge number of shares remain short and negative news printed all over media and TV, there is no way BA can go above 200 .

Who followed my lead at 221.20?Wow I’m good
The (.) period dot indicator is starting to pop. Almost time to buy the dip. Better then RSI !

hahahahahahaha is the time to buy buy buy?.. Since First positive earning.....
"get ready, ba is close to rebounding back to 230, and it'll reach 300 at some point, probably in the not-so-distant future, maybe even before the end of the year.. now is the time to buy, not sell"
Please be up 2.00 at the open but 3.00 would be best. That why the puts I buy will have nice stop area at 223.25Perfect set up.

I think the constant churn is coming to an end. Boeing has finally bottomed. We are spring loaded and heading to a new 52 week high. BUY NOW!!!
Good time to buy more Whenever there is a panic situation that's the time to buy.

LOVE THIS STOCK. $230 this week
looks to me like last week ba began the process of heading back up

It is beginning to appear from the charts that breakout is only a matter of time.
"Alaskan Airline talking about the max. “We’re extremely pleased with the operational, financial and environmental performance of the aircraft,” Nat Pieper, the airline’s vice president of fleet, finances and alliances, said in a news release. “The planes are exceeding our expectations—from how quiet the engines run to the greater range they provide—and our guests love them.”"

222.3 will reject again U will see
Dude Eric. can you please stop spamming this board.
Going has ran out of true buyers and sellers.All you’re seeing is some day traders and the computers. Mostly the computers
I don’t understand how the cases reaching 200k even after vaccination. It’s holding up Boeing stock. I don’t care about politics but USA is doing worst in terms of cases and deaths.
The FAA looking into how Boeing handles safety related communications. These guys are nonstop with the negative news articles. I wonder if the head of the FAA is short BA stock. Still ended up green anyway. China should be due to recertify the 737 Max anytime now.
"A positive thought on another hit day on Boeing stock, the RICO act allows triple damages in a lawsuit against price fixing by market makers, big brokerages, hedge funds, etc. using illegal naked shorting, etc., to manipulate Boeing stock this summer. If a good financial analyst/lawyer team can track back millions of shares shorted (and document fake shares/illegal trades and the businesses involved), then the damages could be in the billions - times three.. The Boeing stock manipulation (down on multiple good news days) was suggested to be looked at to a lawyer with a track record of ""getting the bad guys"" doing naked short selling, but not sure if he is available/interested. However the $59 point drop since about 15 March covers over $30 billion decline, which might interest a lot of lawyers and whistleblowers..."

$225 today.
The slight drop makes is senseless today but the end result will be the same. You will see $300 soon. This stock was $147 just 8 months ago. All indications are it is heading in the right direction.

"Is CNBC (Lebow...) a shill for naked shorts scam. CNBC said cutting flights due to decreasing demand. However SW and others previously said they can't staff the flights, so reducing number of flights - more passenger demand than they can support with current staffing levels. When will SEC/DOJ do their job regarding stopping naked shorts (selling fake shares - stock fraud).An online site listed Susquehanna International Group LLP with over 10 million BA shares shorted on prior report and with over 8 million on 11 Aug. It listed Citadel Adv LLC with over 7 million shares shorted on both reports, but doesn't say if naked shorts or not.

"In terms of total backlog, Airbus has a 62% market share vs. Boeing's 38% share. This includes all single- and twin-aisle aircraft. It also includes freighters and air force tankers."
there is no reason why ba shouldn't be at 260 and heading higher
I said right here on Friday that one should have come into today with 217.50 and 222.50 calls and no puts.I also said a break of 210.94 to the downside was bearish and a break above Friday’s high of 212.74 was bullish.I can copy and paste for those that prefer to lie about what I said
$230 close today have a great weekend
China needs to get the 737 into service! This will be certified in short order...Huge for Boeing! Heard the 737 line is ramping up...they can go from zero to 52 ap's a month in lighting speed depending on supply chain and can easily go to 60 a month. China is one of ...if not...the largest 737 customers. I believe we will continue up to 320 a share in near term if all goes well with certification.
Well I’m up to 25 240 calls they are .04And I loaded up on 50 235 calls. They were .07And I bought 4 222.50 calls for 1.01That 950 including what I bought earlier.

If I can hold a year and this goe to 300 I would be thrilled. Just seems like the headwinds are killing it every time it goes up, it fall down harder. The YTD trend is still negative ?????? I'm feeling very bearish on this stock right now with 1800 shares."
dont worry about all the ups and downs that what trading around the core allows. My core is the 222.50 calls bought dirt cheap friday. then sold the 217.50 on the opening rip and added 3 217.50 puts.bought back the 217.50 calls on the morning dip. so now my core is the 217.50 calls and the 222.50 calls. with 3 217.50 puts as a little hedge in case......who knows what curve ball they throw. of if this runs above 221.00 today of course id sell the 217.50s and just hold the 222.50.this is how you benefit from the ups and downs.
So we are exactly where we were a month ago - of course the stock was $20 higher during that time before it was crashed by algos . What fun and games are in store - the stock moves not on any fundamentals making g it hard for new investors to have any conviction .
"BA F-15 Saint Louis has added 500 people in the last two years. An article from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch noted yesterday. Dignitaries from the USAF and foreign militaries were “crowded a hanger” to see the latest Qatar version roll out. It says last July a contract for 8 USAF F-15EXs was signed, $1.8 billion. A budget was passed in December for 12 more, and the USAF expects to buy 144 in total. Possibly 200!Foreign sales will jump…"
"Look, Boeing isn't going anywhere in the next 50 years, stop all the naysaying. It is part of a worldwide duopoly of aircraft, but also a space, military and logistical provider to the US and other countries. Sure, the price is low, with all the hit articles, covid restrictions, MM short selling, etc...but I believe that is so insiders can buy shares at a low and volatile price as the rest of the economy is inflating. Take advantage, Boeing will be there in the future, people will need to visit their loved ones in other countries, and it will go back to $432 (when I bought my very 1st share a week before the 2nd flight crash) and continue going higher as will the US economy."
"MM's use BA to bring down DOW and dont bother to lift it when market recovers, if BA can be removed out of DOW ,that would reduce this manipulation. Now they short BA at the open with around 100K+ shares and keep it depressed so that DOW falls ."
"Prior to the 2 MAX 737 crashes, BA traded in a channel range of $330 - $380, before eventually breaking out to $440. Then came the crashes and Covid. More recent times, the trading range channel has become $220 to $250."
"Good to see Boeing shaking things up lately on the board, adding more engineers…. Boeing is one of the last few big industrial companies that has the potential to completely reinvent itself…."
Boeing Stock Higher as China 737 MAX Test Flight Raises Certification Hopeshttps://www.thestreet.com/investing/boeing-stock-higher-china-737-max-test-lifts-certification-hopes
India has recertified the 737 Max. I am surprised we are not up more than 50 cents.
September will be awesome for travel again! Get ready for Boeing to see the $250s very quickly.
China certification for the 737 MAX coming!!!
"Accordingly, the aerospace major expects a fast-paced traffic recovery on domestic routes followed by overseas ones.“In the commercial market, while near term pressure due to Covid-19 remains, the recovery is accelerating and many of the key long-term fundamentals remain intact,” said Boeing India President Salil Gupte said.“The pace of recovery is uneven. In the near term, we expect the environment will remain very challenged for many of our airline customers and the industry as a whole as they adapt to this rapidly evolving travel demand.” “In India, domestic traffic is leading the recovery. We’re seeing double-digit monthly improvements in operations as vaccine rates improve and travel restrictions begin to loosen.” According to Gupte, passenger traffic is expected to return to 2019 levels in 2023 to 2024 and a few years beyond that to return to a long-term growth trend.“We still see recovery in three phases. First, domestic, then regional markets such as intra-Asia, intra-Europe, intra-Americas, and finally long haul, international routes.” “Therefore, we expect demand for single-aisle airplanes to strengthen near-term as evidenced by our year-to-date orders for the 737 families, and demand for widebody aircraft as international borders open.” “Additionally, we see the demand for India domiciled aircraft to grow ‘4x’ over the next 20 years.”"
I wonder if period will delete his posts again today ? Rofl
$300 in a matter of short time.
Gertrude pretty bitter I called that top at 221.20
"higher highs and higher lows for ba now, probably 230 this week, 300 by end of the year"
"ba back to 240 from here, then 265+, now is not the time to bash, now is the time to buy"
"Dr. Jin Dak plans on buying another 50 shares. China recertification, India's PO for 80 jets, return of air travel, opening of countries/airports, return of dividend, strong earnings reports, diminishing inventory, expenses written off 2 years ago, cash in hand for every et, etc. It never ends.There will also be a looming crisis in the fall when airplanes are on back order. Hold on folks, this is going to be a great 2nd half of the year for BA! longs are going to make a lot of money off of this stock."
so when does this go red ?
Perma Bear Stock.. Shorts will have it easy for another year or 2
buy buy buy best day for today
"WOW this last week, I have flown from Los Vegas to Nashville on board a Boeing 737 MAX, first time, this is one awesome airplane interior very modern very quiet and very fast, love it."
Market will be up tomorrow. Just hold
$241-$253 by Labor Day! You heard it here.
This has become very easy at this point. Don’t do anything until it breaks 223.25 on volume.
No way Boeing can get to $300 a share this year Unless covid magically disappears tomorrow Stop dreaming and be realistic
"Alaska Air Group Inc. said Monday it is exercising options early on 12 Boeing Co. 737-9 aircraft, bringing total firm commitments to 93 737-9 aircraft. Of that total, five aircraft are currently in service."
Easy 276 by December 31
$221 today. $230 by Friday.
"People forget Boeing is not just passenger airline travel company: for instance their defense sector which is growing every quarter, and now it turns out a lot of that Afghanistan money is going to be going to Boeing… also, their satellites and space sector…."
I remember when this was a $450 stock
People are wrong about China. It was well-documented that China had several things that needed to be completed prior to approval for the max to return to service. Not just the test flight was required. After the test flight Boeing had to get new approval of training for the pilots which had to be submitted and then reviewed after the test flighr. There was also a third criteria that I forgot exactly what it was but if you Google it it was well-documented that it was not going to go as quickly as you guys are presenting. So nothing is wrong with the current approval process.
big jump all trading weeks.......due to oversold recovering
I think this board is bad karma. And I’m allowing it to distract me. I don’t post much the first hour or so each day because that the high time for volitility but I will be posting less going forward.Good luck
Can someone please convince me why I should keep my 1800 shares in this stock while everything keeps going up and up and this has done really noting for year. Will it ever go anywhere ?
"Breaking ""Boeing Foresees Fast-Paced Recovery in Air Traffic as Govt Eases Travel Restrictions"""
I moved to NVAX last week and now I have more BA shares guys!
"MM's have milked the Tech & Ship stocks maximum, there is nothing to be made short term from there, now they are turning to BA and other Industrials stocks to bring it down as much as possible before adding them huge. With 737 MAx, the best fuel efficent and safest plane and selling big, BA is on the right path to recovery. Soon the 748 will also be back in a few months."
"On the daily chart , bearish ABCD pattern is getting formed for a target for 197 , thats a 10% fall from todays closing price."

"Aug 12 (Reuters) - India is set to allow Boeing Co's 737 MAX jets to resume flights in the country within days, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing a person familiar with the matter.The country has been satisfied with the plane's performance since it was un-grounded in the United States, Europe and a number of other markets, and Boeing has met India's own requirements, which included setting up a MAX simulator, according to the report https://bloom.bg/3fYInyy.Boeing said in a statement it continues to work with global regulators to safely return the 737-8 MAX and 737-9 MAX to service worldwide, and deferred the timeline to India's air safety regulator.If the U.S. plane manufacturer gets the go-ahead in India it would end a nearly two-and-a-half-year regulatory grounding of the model in a key travel market.India's SpiceJet Ltd has more than 100 737 MAX planes on firm order.India's second-largest airline by market share, SpiceJet currently has 13 737 MAX planes grounded and is in talks with Boeing for compensation towards costs and losses it has suffered."
Gonna be very green today it looks like
Long-haul startup Norse Atlantic Airways has revealed details of its plans as it moves towards launching operations in 2022. The LCC believes that demand for transatlantic travel will return by late Q1 or early Q2 next year and anticipates that all 15 of its Boeing 787s will be flying passengers...
fundamentals look promising for BA. would like management to stay more on top of any safety/quality issues. safe to buy here as this stock will go up. World will not stop flying.
""" Boeing officials already have said that the MAX’s long grounding and all the costs associated with it probably shaved $9 billion or $10 billion. But some analysts have suggested that when all the legal, manufacturing and sales damage eventually is totaled up, the 737 MAX program’s loss could push $20 billion."" - FORBES"
Boeing stock dilution will bring the price down to 180Just a heads up
"Buy and forget about it, This is the backbone of the US government."
Longs better hope they don’t get any more orders tomorrow. Boeing has been dropping on every order.Remember it dropped 35 after the United announcement. This stock has it backwards.Good news drops it and bad news drops it less. And no news mean sit had a 50/50 chance.
"Lol with covid cases skyrocketing in the US, imagine what the price of Boeing shares are gonna be if we go into another lockdown. Ez 150$?"

"Overall, Boeing delivered 184 jetliners for the year through July, according to the latest data made available by the planemaker.Boeing said it received orders in July for 31 aircraft, including 19 of its 737 MAX jets, and 12 of its larger widebodies."
"BA will rise $20 this week. Yu heard it right here. $241.75, minimum."
Reuters didn’t publish Max flying again in India. Wonder why? Print and television media is doing favors for the hedge funds and market generally. If Boeing were 300 the Dow would be 480 points higher. It’s a scam. Gotta be long - Boeing is worth 5x 100B
"BA usually takes 5 sessions below the lower BBs before it bottoms. at the same time it generally bounces to retest the 10 SMA 7-8 days after it breaks below it.which one wins out????? if 210.94 hold for the low and boeing closes above 214.73, then im trading for a move to 224.if on the other hand it breaks that 210.94 then Im playing 3 more days down and a move to 205."
hope you have puts for tomorrow. if so learn from my mistake and only sell half when its down 3.00 at the open.odds are it will be down 6.00 later.only saving thing i did today was I did add puts at 216 and again on that bounce to 215 and the bounce to 213.still selling my deep in the money puts at 215.75 then selling a few more around 217.00 was a huge mistake.
Need new management. This is clear. Nonstop problem for years.

"Calhoooooon is CEO till 2028, BA stays between $190-245. Opportunity cost anyone ? If you are long and plan to be long, sell some covered calls instead of dreaming of $300-$400. Premium is your dividend."

Chart says it is time to buy not sell the low of the trough.
"BA is dangerous for the shorts, since good news can come any hour. They can't ""put themselves out"" although some will. This is why they borrow and remain poor as you invest and gain wealth.Boeing Good: $500 will cone sooner than you think."
Patience! Planes and airports are still packed. The vaccines are working and the uneducated are finally getting their shots. Q3 results are on par with Q2.
This stock will bust wide open soon. September is the month. It won't stay this low for very long. Too much going on to sit here.
The pumpers (insiders) always disappear DURING market hours.We can look forward after the close for 300 to 1400 price target pumps.Thanks Jin
