"My wife is a former employee who invested her entire 401k in ABC stock. With dividend reinvestment her pps is @ $20.45 giving her a 7.85% dividend (great vacation money for us). It’s one of her best investments. SQ, AAPL, DMLP (over 11% dividend) are mine. As long as ABC maintains its current dividend or stock drops down to 60’s, this baby is a long for us. GLTA."

"Teva Pharma, Johnson & Johnson, McKesson, Cardinal Health, Purdue Pharma, AmerisourceBergen, doctors, FDA, judges, National Association of Attorneys General, State Attorney Generals and all the healthcare industry are preparing for a reckoning with the U.S. epidemic of opioid addiction. The TEVA’s shares tumbled after it set aside $646 million to help pay legal expenses related to its alleged role in the abuse of the addictive painkillers linked to tens of thousands American deaths annually. U.S. authorities are seeking steep damages from Teva and a handful of other prominent pharmaceutical companies -- three drug distributors offered $10 billion to settle a range of state lawsuits against them. Ws massive legal fees rose and concerns for human welfare in the crisis continued to intensify, the opioid reckoning is still in its early stages. The nearly 2,000 cities and counties; 34,000 towns, cities and counties; and all the states have hold them accountable for the epidemic in light of troves of new documents made public. Ironically, states that criminalize weed have the highest opioid addicts and deaths.Sooner or later, drugmakers, distributors and retailers will likely have to pay up in a big way. There’s no quick fix to the opioid crisis, and there’s no easy way out for the companies who allegedly helped spur it.McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen propose paying $10 billion to settle state lawsuits over their role. The states countered with a $45 billion demand — as if investors needed another reminder of the issue’s scale and complexity.McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen, along with other distributors, shipped a total of 76 billion pain pills over a six-year period starting in 2006-2012 alone, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency. U.S. DEA and FDA are snakes guarding the hen house.Although DEA maintains the comprehensive ARCOS database of all opioid orders, its contents were historically sealed and unavailable to anyone except the DEA. This means that while the data is now available for media and the public to analyze in hindsight, it was not available at the time to distributors while they were attempting to make decisions about how to fulfill their regulatory duties.The DEA had it the whole time, as the information was provided by distributors. But only now are distributors also getting the opportunity to review and analyze it.In addition to DEA’s role in regulating the distributors, there are several other safeguards in place to ensure a safe supply chain. For example, only licensed physicians are able to prescribe FDA-approved medications, which are then delivered to patients by state-licensed pharmacies. Given the level of federal and state oversight required for a drug to travel from a factory to a patient, you might assume that these government agencies would accept some responsibility for the current opioid epidemic.Instead, the blame has been placed squarely on the supply chain — manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies — without regard for what federal and state involvement or oversight have been. In addition, all large members of the supply chain are falsely painted with the same brush of misleading mathematics. While espousing rumors of corporate greed and negligence may sell newspapers, it quite simply misses the mark.“We deny liability and will continue to vigorously defend ourselves,” Teva said. “We maintain our defenses while also exploring responsible and comprehensive alternatives.”Revenue fell 8% to $4.34 billion mainly due to generic competition to its multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone and lower revenues from cholesterol treatment Treanda.Teva's debt load is about $30 billion by the end of August and investors are concerned over the ability to pay it down. The cost of refinancing its debt to go up because of a lower credit rating, TEVA Chief Financial Officer Michael McClellan stepping down this week."
ABC and CVS are up. And they both made the top 20 healthcare list by revenue. CVS came in #1.

$ABC Barclays raises targetwww.stocktargetadvisor.com/blog/barclays-capital-raised-their-target-on-amerisourcebergen-corporationabcnye-to-130/
AmerisourceBergen Reported Quarter of Strong Revenue and Adjusted Diluted EPS Growthhttps://www.sectorreports.com.au/landing-page/?symbol=ABC
"OAKVILLE, Ontario – Innomar Strategies, a part of AmerisourceBergen, has reached an agreement with the Government of Canada to support the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines across Canada. The agreement was announced today by the Honourable Anita Anand, Minister of Public Services and Procurement and the Honourable Patty Hajdu, Minister of Health."
"With many health care companies being acquired for $50 billion each, the low price on ABC could attract a health insurance company or hospital company to try to grab ABC for a 10% - 15% premium and take it out. Market cap appears low for acquirers using stock to buy companies in the health care area."
AmerisourceBergen is up 5.24% to 118.50
To the one bashing the CGC deal: don’t be simple & stupid! Only 300M is tied up with this agreement the rest of CGC’s 4 Billion is not locked up from now till US Legalization. So CGC can still grow with that huge sum of money and pay cash to buy & expand as opposed to Diluting & Expanding. US Legalization will take at least a year or two from now and when that happens CGC has the right to buy one of the biggest and most influential US MSOs at a pre-US Legalization premium with a combination of cash & Loans and be the king of both countries. Capisce!? $ABC $CGC
This is why Black Market doesn’t matter to companies with heavy focus on Medical “Spectrum Cannabis and the Arthritis Society Team Up to Launch Arthritis Talks”$CGC $TCNNF $CRLBF $ABC
"word of mouth, but a friend that works for this company for the last year said they were being awarded ""National Distribution of Vaccinations"". They have yet to announce their award yet. Bought in at 102"
"Truth is if $ABC falls below 8.60 we are in trouble until announcement or ER...needs to hold above or going down to mid-high 7s. It already lost all the gains from Peltz announcement in just 11 sessions. Extremely bullish, should see green tomorrow? Hold, this will be a $50+."
What's not to like on the earnings call?
Yahoo still did not move the conversation option to new page for $ABC... I was wondering where everyone went-lol
Are there any real ABC investors on this YMB? Interested to get any insights as after my own DD have picked up some shares.
