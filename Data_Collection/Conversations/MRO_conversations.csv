looks like big boys want to add oil for the new quarter.
"OK THAT'S BETTER! Sitting on 7,000 shares cost of 11.40 wondering if time to take some off but this looks to be start of bigger move north. Maybe buy more?"
"Finally, MRO showing promise. I had bought 6,000 shares at $12.27 and 6,500 shares at $13.86. My break-even is about $13.10. But I plan to hold until early January. MRO seems headed in positive direction over the next several months following their debt reduction, buyback plans, increased dividend -- and, most of all, the skyrocketing price of a barrel of oil. Let's make some money. Enjoy the ride."
"Oct 12, 2021 · Marathon Oil had its price target increased by stock analysts at Wells Fargo & Company from $18.00 to $19.00 in a note issued to investors on Tuesday, Benzinga reports."
"Overall Market is down, but Brent and WTI are in the green. Today's just showing us higher lows which is what we want instead of collapsing because the overall Market is down. Winter is coming. Natural Gas has spiked. We are in good straits 6 weeks out from the next earnings reports ... We're going up as long as supply is constrained and when children 5 -12 can get vaccinated, which will push the USA towards herd immunity, the market is going to jump."

"MRO longs, just relax and chill, Happy Friday and have a good weekend!"
Navarre55 How about u give an upcoming estimated earnings report. I would appreciate it. I am staying in MRO til then.
"Think I might bail on OGs and the entire market for a week or two. This whole infrastructure and debt ceiling fight ain't gonna be helpful. Haven't done it yet, maybe tomorrow. I always end up kicking myself later when I don't trust my instincts."
"""Why the Factors Driving Today’s High Gas Prices Are Likely to Stick Around""The high price of natural gas overseas has led many Asian and European consumers to find ways to switch to oil and in some cases, even shut down. The amount of natural-gas to oil switching may result in additional winter oil demand of 500,000 to 1 million barrels per day, which pressures oil prices higher. Governments around the world are concerned. The United States has been selling crude oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve all year. China began to sell oil to temper the rise of prices. It has not worked. India is considering the same course of action.Which means that gasoline prices, which are at an eight-year high, are not likely to fall dramatically any time soon. The world wants more oil, they want it today, and it’s not there, at least not yet. Low oil prices were cured by reducing supplies. High oil prices will be cured as that supply returns. https://www.barrons.com/articles/whats-going-on-with-energy-oil-gas-prices-what-you-need-to-know-51634233197"
"Like to remind MRO holders, what you have in your hand are black GOLD! We have the momentum now, high oil price will be even higher, increasing demand vs limited supply and supply chain constraints, infrastructure projects, cold winter and high ng price, more money in the stock market...Do not fight the trend and sell yourself short! HOLD for BIGGGGGGER gains! Patience pays. Once of lifetime opportunity for this super cycle phenomena! $20 is within reasonable reach!"
***IMPORTANT***. MRO LONGS……this is just the beginning….shorts are starting to get toasted…STILL TO COME…. A BLOWOUT QUARTER WHERE SHAREHOLDERS WILL BE GREATLY REWARDED….MRO HAS EVOLVED INTO A CASH MACHINE with ZERO reason to sell…..THEN ANOTHER BLOWOUT QUARTER AFTER THIS ONE……BIG FISH MAY SWALLOW MRO UP ??? Good luck VERY LONG VERY STRONG !!!
Coldest October day in 8 years today in Seattle.

I could see it has a very reasonable chance to reach $18, $20 or more.Your patience will be rewarded. HOLD and let the good time roll!"
Very SOLID hold for MRO! Congrats! Next two weeks will be exciting before the earnings!All aboard MRO train to $20 or more land!
Going green today ?

MRO is going to report more than 400m in free cash flow. you be the judge if its a $15 stock.
MRO…first stop zig zag to 21-23…..after 23 watch out above soooo many tailwinds ahead to easily get there…..ZERO reason to sell…..we will zig zag increasing dollar by dollar to reach company record highs!Watch and see !!
What a great day my friends. Now is not the time to not have dry powder. The wall street lake ice we are on is not solid but very thin. Just like dominoes a strong wind on wall street could cause a great fall. That wind is all most upon us. Seize the day my friends.
Bill fails. I bet market recovers somewhat tomorrow.
14.27 was the high mikey 14.24 was my exit yes dear mikey 25k shares
A BIG milestone just reached! $16! Congrats!
"I placed an order for more MRO (and more REI) at market open. At the moment, it appears that was a a dork move...I was warned and I know better. However you know how we pups jump when we're happy. And how when there's an itch, we GOTTA' scratch it. Lucy and Charlie Brown warned me, they couldnt stop me. I placed a market order last night. I woke up today to discover I paid 16.47 at market open for MRO. LOL! First I barked at my computer. Then I put on my Red Baron fighting helmet and decided I was a smarter dog than this. So I just bought more shares of MRO @ 15.97. I still have a few bones left to buy more. Just waiting to see how the day plays out. I havent sold a single share since I first bought in the single digits. That 15.97 is the most I ever paid for MRO and it still feels like chump change to me. Good luck to all on this fine board today. Tomorrow WILL be better. Banks are open then."

MRO Longs: Pay day for shareholders is looming ….shareholders will be rewarded….the best thing about the next quarter after this is going to be even better ….HANG TIGHT TO YOUR SHARES AS THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING!!! Long and very strong !!
Last week I said buy BABA at $140. Hope you did. Tech stocks hot again in China and president XI now concentrating on Taiwan. I like BABA and DIDI.
"Longs here is my next pick after ALLO. I bought JWN-Nordstrom. JWN just hit $27. I see JWN at $35 by end of year and I am being conservative. Today most ports in US started working 24/7 to expedite release of goods coming from China. JWN customers sitting on a ton of cash and ready to spend for the holidays. Get in. Again my picks lately are ALLO, BABA, FB and JWN. Have a great evening all. Your friend Glad always here to help you make money. Seafood tonight sounds good"
Thinking about investing in a Hunter B painting. I bet it will be worth a ton 50 years from now. He uses an amazing combination of colors. What an artist. And all paintings painted and signed in the basement of the white house
L love BABA next 4 months. I say BABA at $225. Sleepy Joe to meet XI soon and compromise on trade. Get in. I also bought DIDI. Time to diversify and I am starting to like Chinese stocks again. BABA and DIDI.

It took 5 weeks for MRO to go from $10.44 (Aug 19) to $13.72 today. My question is how long it will take to go to $16? then to $18? By Thanksgiving or Christmas or New Years!
"well it happened, break out of $14. Can it get to $18-$19 by end of the year? fingers crossed it looks promising."
The oil patch doesn't need oil any higher. They are crappin cash even with oil at 65 and NG at 4.25. Oil in the 80's is just icing on the cake. Unbelievable MRO is at 16.
Easy fix for Glad. I just muted him and won’t see anymore of his bashing posts now that he sold. What a snake. Do the same$lpi $MRO $CDEV
"MRO chart is a clear triple top, Bearish I’m out guys Not gonna chance it"
"Sold, I'll buy back in when it gets back in the 11's."
"Why after OPEC meeting oil is going higher??? No deal with Iran. Iran cannot add to the 1.2 million barrels, US shale cut CAPEX by at least 30% and not looking into expanding, instead they are giving the money back to shareholders and demand is outpacing supply. I say oil at $90 in weeks. Earnings will be huge this quarter for oil companies"

"Fyi all ....MRO is taking out the July 1st high on lower volume...as of now the move has higher price, but we need to overcome the vol of july 1....otherwise it is just a higher price...which says it can go higher...The best technical pic is for the volume to go over the july 1st vol and that would confirm a SUPREME tech breakout"
"This will trade over $25 by Dec 25Oil/ NG is not going anywhere, regardless what the Greenies say. It will take decades to transition over. Hold on the energy stocks for the next 2-3 years and retire early."

"APA has been a laggard during this oil updraft. If you layout a 2 yr chart and compare with similar companies you will see that the only worse performer is OXY. My opinion is that there is a lot more upside for APA. Not only does it need to catch up to the price of oil, it needs to catch up to its peers. Many oilers have made moves that might leave little upside but APA could still be a double... My position in APA is about the same as MRO but MRO has out performed. Many here have made great calls trading smaller cap oilers. My question is anybody buying laggards in the oil patch???"
No cigar for 15.00 bucks today...I bet we get there by Wednesday. sad to see this but the Dow and oil prices coming down from the top got us.

"What is the reason for the sector wide sell off, market up oil up, oil stocks red."
What a day. Sold my AMPY again. Sorry to hear Snoopy bought MRO at $16.47 and $15.97. Don`t worry. Just read my new book. Up a tree without a ladder or the whole set starting at living with squirrels. Yes my friends you should have listen to one on this board who said Greed kills. Sorry I did not say that. Remember I am old Noah 10th generation twice removed on my fathers side. I know about water . When the tide goes out make sure your on dry land. If not grab hold of a anchor because that sucking sound around you will be your money. Have fun waiting for the oil storage results but we already know them. This is not rocket science. And remember my friends you never can go wrong with profit but you can when you get stuck up a tree thinking oil is going to $150. Then again you can ride that tree down just get someone with a chainsaw or axe.
MRO is currently UP .10 in after hours.
The only reason to sell an energy stock right now is to to buy a better one!
Nov 19 2021 18s options traded as low as .25 ...trading at .33 now still ther are some bargains there....earnings early nov...think it is the 4th
Yahoo finance summery says that MRO says that 3q to be relatively flat in the 3 quarter . Are they smoking crack ? Why would they give it a raiting of 45 out of 90 . Who ever is in charge must be a tree hugger or invested in Tesla .
Remember $23+ just three years ago? MRO is in much better shape all around now. $18 before the end of the year. 
"This is my favorite energy pickwith oil at 80 and NG at 5-6, they are going to generate insane FCF, like 25% of marketcap !!Get it !!!"
"I first bought MRO shortly after the planned -demic collapseAT $4 bucks, am 6 for 6 trading MRO, among other oil and gas plays. I’m telling you the open interest is Small tomorrow it may rally first part of the day and into the close , Cause they will lift MRO higher and sell into the illusion of strength. By the end of next week it will be below $15. The short interest has spiked, since last disclosure date. And It will revisit 13-13.50 within 1-3 weeks. I will cover and buy back Long at 13-13:50526 X PE Ratio. LOL ya ok."

"Note to self. Sell in the morning, re-buy in the afternoon. Everyday."
Today looks like the best laid plans of Mice and Men. Volume is not that high so shorts don`t really want to waste money . Glad has made his case. Will oil fall by $3? I for one have gotten so use to being up this tree. I really don`t care what it does.I know Marathon is undervalued. I know oil is a house of cards. Oil traders can park 100`s of tankers off our coast and buy and sell pushing oil up or down. Several years ago I went to Victoria Island in B.C. I took a ferry across Puget Sound. The tankers were parked for miles. Now Marathon oil is in the best shape it has ever been. Debt of only $4.03 billion. This 4th quarter we have a chance to get in on the action with our 40 percent over $60 a barrel. I am looking forward to them buying some of that $1.3 billion stock buyback. So don`t come on this board and tell us the sky is falling . It is just rain my friends and in life there is always a storm. Just be ready with dry powder because if day traders and shorts want to throw in a winning hand be ready to break their hand getting those cheap shares. I did yesterday. I thought $13.46 was a steal. Two days in a row we hit $13.45. Hey shorts I am waiting for you again and remember I wont turn you over to the butt police.
"WOOF! I just bought more. On the downtick ths time, LOL. "" Marathon Oil ( MRO) has an average investment rating of outperform among analysts polled by Capital IQ, with a price target range of $7 to $22."""
Holding MRO but watching APA breakout. Hopefully MRO will soon follow.
Will MRO hit $20 this year. I say
Just in. No wait for it. I will let Glad give you the numbers. Look out below! WoW!
"Time to rotate to tech. I like AMZN, FB and JWN going into the holidays. Oil stocks overbought in my opinion."
"Dingmann expects several oil companies to benefit from this phenomenon. Majors like Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell ( RDS/A ) don't tend to hedge their gas production, so they'll see large benefits from the price increase. Others like Continental Resources (CLR) have kept their hedges light too, Dingmann notes. Continental's production is 52% oil and 48% gas, and only an estimated 5% of its gas production was hedged in 2022, according to Dingmann. He also expects Marathon Oil ( MRO ) to benefit, as 49% of its production is gas."
"MRO will form a higher base before next rally to the earnings and maybe special dividend/buyback, then holiday season/new year rally, 4th quarter result, cold winter, infrastructure bills, adding all these catalysts, not a stretch to say MRO could touch $18/$20 or higher.Almost there after such long journey. Be patient, especially NOW. HOLD!"
Best performing oil stock last 3 weeks. $20 coming by end of year
Captain Kirk in space. Love it. Next should be sleepy Joe
………MRO is going to make a bundle on Natural gas alone…If you haven’t noticed the stock behavior has changed and it just keeps on grinding up not down like a month ago when it hit 10.60….. So BUY NOW it’s a good price now that the Saudi’s only raised it 400k the agreed amount.This is a huge development with the environment where in…It paves the way to $90-100 oil by year end…
"Hello……Wells Fargo Maintains Overweight on Marathon Oil, Raises Price Target to $19………HELLO…..Buy now!!!"
Dear investors. For the last two days I have been cut off because of a person which I know on this board said I was in violation of TOS at Yahoo. The same thing I did everyone does it on this board at times.I want to thank Yahoo for reinstating me and I will promise to only post what I think instead of using cut and paste at times. This person I believe did not like my call when I said we would go over $13.44 one day and then $14. They must have lost a lot of money. I also posted my ideas about what could stop this rally and most of my post were pulled for over a week. Just as one post about oil being released from our reserves I posted it only to see it removed Sunday. The $1.5 Trillion bill had 42 million barrels being sold. I believe this $3.5 billion aka $6.5 billion bill may have as much as 100 million to cost zero to Tax payers.Think about this. If you are anti oil why keep our oil reserves. In Illinois they have signed a deal to get out of all oil use . Now think about that since oil is still being pumped from Illinois. In fact during WWII Illinois was a major source of oil for the war effort. Best wishes to all . I don`t know how long I can post till I get attacked again by this person. Buy or sell only after you do your on DD. In the past I have tried to look at Marathon with a fine tooth comb. Beware there is a wolf pack on this board who will do anything to set up their trade. Even getting you kicked off the board. Thanks Navarre55

"U.S. home heating bills expected to surge this winter, EIA saysScott DiSavino: Wed, October 13, 2021, 8:53 AMHERE IT COMES!(Reuters) -U.S. consumers will spend more to heat their homes this winter than last year due to surging energy prices, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected in its winter fuels outlook on Wednesday.Energy prices have risen sharply worldwide, causing power crunches in large economies like China and India.The United States has so far not seen the same effect, even though prices of fuels from natural gas to heating oil have risen to multiyear highs and will hit household finances as the weather turns colder.“As we have moved beyond what we expect to be the deepest part of the pandemic-related economic downturn, growth in energy demand has generally outpaced growth in supply,” EIA Acting Administrator Steve Nalley said in the release.""These dynamics are raising energy prices around the world.""Nearly half of U.S. households rely on natural gas for heat, with the average cost for those homes expected to rise by 30% to $746 for the October-to-March period from the same time a year earlier, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy said.The average cost for a home with natural gas last winter was $573, far cheaper than other major sources of heat. Natural gas prices have risen sharply in recent months due to shortages in places like China and Europe, where demand has rebounded from the pandemic. The United States can only export a small portion of its natural gas supply due to limited terminal space for liquefied natural gas (LNG) export.Electricity is the primary heating source for about 40% of homes. It is more expensive than natural gas at an estimated $1,268 per household this coming winter - but that represents a more modest 6% increase from last winter.Less than 12 million American households rely on heating oil or propane - about 9% of the roughly 129 million U.S. households - but they will see the biggest hit. Those costs are expected to rise by 54% and 43% respectively, the EIA said, from last winter.Changes in prices of heating oil and propane pass through much more quickly to consumers. Homes that rely on heating oil are concentrated in the U.S. Northeast, and the biggest users of propane are in the upper Midwest and northern Plains states.Last year energy prices plunged to multi-year lows due to coronavirus demand destruction, particularly natural gas, the most popular U.S. heating fuel, which hit a 25-year-low.Depending where people live, the EIA said residential costs will rise to about $11-$14 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) for natural gas, about $2.50-$3.50 per gallon for propane, and $3.39 per gallon for heating oil.That compares with last winter's residential costs of around $8-$12 per mcf for natural gas, $1.50-$2.50 per gallon for propane, and $2.55 per gallon for heating oil.(Reporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by Andrew Heavens, Jonathan Oatis, Marguerita Choy, Aurora Ellis and Jan Harvey) $CDEV $LPI $MRO"

WTI on fire again. Loading the truck with CPE and LPI. Both oversold
Counterpoint to all the recent oil bullishness. The oil rally may not last as long everybody currently thinks. There are 2 elephants in the room: 1. Rapid auto industry transformation to exclusive EV production and sales.2. Remote work for majority of office professionals worldwide. These 2 alone will dent oil consumption considerably and I'm surprised Wall St talking heads have been mum on this. At some point they they will...once they squeezed all the juice they can from these stocks and then go Short.
"Is the EIA report today or tomorrow, usually its Wednesday around 11:00 EST , but I believe I saw that its not being released until tomorrow ????"
Just bought Facebook. Cheap in my opinion. FB always bounces back after a crisis. What are people thinking. FB should be protecting kids. Isn't that the role of parents???
"***** HUGE PAYDAY IMMINENT*****MRO…produces 383,000bbl PER DAY or roughly 34,800,000 bbl/ Qt…do the simple math if oil averaged $72 bbl….anything over $60 bbl the will give back to shareholders AT MINIMUM 40%..that would be $12bbl X .40= $4.80 / bbl RETURNED BACK TO THE SHAREHOLDERS…My guess is they would do a stock buyback/increase normal Dividend/P some type of HEALTHY variable dividend combo……My gut feeling is they will raise the normal Dividend and they will buy backstock first because let’s face it next quarter’s gonna be better so they will earn money on the stock they buy back￼….So this quarter will be set up for next quarter to be a investors once in a lifetime tremendous pay back to SHAREHOLDERS….with no end in sight for the quarters beyond that!!!"
WTI sure looks like it wants to test $80 this week. Stay tuned....
J thanks my friend for REI tip. Sold today. UP close to 20% today made 60% since. I will wait and see what API/EIA does then rethink my strategy again.
"Honestly I do not see MRO going much higher. Market volatile, China not supplying US with goods, supply chain disrupted and DC in crises mode. I say next 2 weeks will be bumpy. I do not see any catalyst that can help market go higher in October. We have no choice but to wait for Democrats to agree on infrastructure and reconciliation. Till then sit back and relax"
Sorry crude stockpiles were 6mm more then estimate . Either US consumers used much less oil then expected or oil companies ramped up supply MUCH more then anticipated or the Saudi’s are dumping oil on our markets .Any of the above or combo of the above spells pullback include oil Prices now
What caused the increase in oil inventories last week???? US and China released barrels from the strategic reserve. It is called manipulation and OPEC knows it. I guess they will buy back at higher oil prices. OPEC source today. OPEC will stick to November increases despite oil at $80. OPEC not change course and adding more than the planned 400K. Means oil going higher.
"DOHA/LONDON (Reuters) - Qatar, the world's largest seller of liquefied natural gas (LNG), told consumers it was powerless to cool energy prices prices as British steelmakers said they could be forced to halt output in the face of soaring costs."
API oil inventory up by almost a million barrels and gasoline up by 3.6 million barrels. Expect a red day tomorrow. And please do not panic. Just a bump on the road
2 more weeks to the earning! KaChing! HOLD!
MRO is just printing money right now.
Ok what is going on with this stock. on July first this was at 14.33 oil was at 76.40. Natural gas was at 3.69. Now oil is only slightly lower at 74.20 but natural gas is at 5.09 these prices have be well above the companies guidance for some time. yet this stock refuses to move up with either oil or gas. Since this company is a 50/50 mix of oil and Gas can some please explain why this stock is not responding?
It seems there is always a small pull back after oil jumps $3 in a week . It is exasperated . MRO is still a cash cow
Truist Securities increased Marathon Oil price target from $20 to $22. The firm currently has a buy rating on MRO.
$80 oil tomorrow?
Get past 15$ and then you are off to the races. Congrats longs make the shorts pay.
"With WTI over $81 question is why are oil stocks falling behind oil price. At current oil price MRO is a $20 stock, CPE is a $70 stock and LPI well over a $100 by now. What kind of mathematical algorithms is Wall St using?? Seriously. Makes 0 sense. Will oil stock catch up with oil price soon???? I really hope so"
Price performance of these oil stocks in relation to crude oil prices are so disconnected. When the heck is the market going to give these stocks their proper valuation? The share prices are lagging so far behind oil prices it doesn't make sense.
"well we are in uncharted territory now... if we can get to $18 by the end of the month, OMG simply an amazing run. how high do you think it will get by year end?"
If MRO ….decides to give a variable dividend back to shareholders this quarter…it could be about .51 per share !! If I did my rough math correct.
Its crazy to think i was able to buy shares in this @$3.11 .... All my energy stocks have been very good to me since the start of the pandemic.
"$LPI $CPE $OXY $MROScientists of the future will discover a new, innovative battery that will store energy in liquid form and will automatically empty itself of the liquid as the energy gets consumed. This battery will offer super fast charging of 100% capacity in only 5 minutes, and range will be over 500 miles. The liquid used in this battery will be eco friendly, and recycled from organic matter found in nature."
It looks like WTI will open UP $1.70 and above $81. Highest price since October 2014 when MRO was trading in the $30s. Crazy world we live in.
"Big shout out to Navarre and Glad. Because of them I made massive gains on MRO. They both said small cap oil stocks would outperform the majors. I sold my position in XOM in November 2020 and went 75% MRO and 25% CPE. I appreciate the daily commentary. Although I disagree with you at times, I always enjoyed your enthusiasm.

Still swimming.Those share purchased at $3.80 looking pretty good this week.GLTA
Nav55 panicked and sold at $15. Now he wants MRO back to $13 so he can buy cheap. Sorry my friend MRO will hit $20 before it hits $13. Oil is on fire and colder winter is approaching and La Nina is back. Means colder winter
"For all MRO longs, you might have seen people sold too earlier and have regrets. Please donot repeat by selling too early while many factors in the big picture are favoring more rally into $20: OPEC+'s steady control, demand (infra bills will be passed, cold winter, etc), increase in both NG and oil prices, MRO's return equity to shareholders, etc.Please donot try to time the market by trying to save a couple of dollars while missing the big boat!Used to think $18 was a good target, now I say let's go $20 which is very reasonable based on momentum what I see these days!BUY AND HOLD for bigger gains!"

"""Oil industry needs $500 billion to avoid future supply crises, says Moody’s.""What I noticed at recent conventions is a reluctance to spend money replacing reserves.For the most part, people are exploiting their existing fields (because of the environmental and political risks).

"Sorry, but I am very disappointed today.........."
MRO…Long Shareholders….The time has come this week or next week!! Pay Day for shareholders !!!!! MRO management wants to be best of breed…Variable Dividend and/ or significant stock buyback…There is zero reason to sell this stock….patience’s will be rewarded….just think this is just the beginning as MRO has evolved into a CASH MACHINE……A big fish will swallow them up not a matter of “if” rather “ when” !!…..Shorts are in trouble….woohooo
Thank you again REI and LPI
It is possible that oil repeats the 2011 - 2014 cycle. See what MRO's price was then at $90 - $100 oil price.
15.39 there. May have been a buy .
"""Those outside the bloc have seen such arguments as an attempt to squeeze prices higher to refill state coffers that were hit hard by last year's price collapse.""OPEC+ may try to keep the oil price float above $80, but maybe not over $90 or $100 which could backfire.Maintaining in the $80 ball park will provide stability, good for MRO!$20!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crude-oil-flat-market-waits-113717262.html"
"Is it true that if I place a sell order at let's say $30 they will not be able to lent out my shares, which ultimately stops short selling? If true, wouldn't be wise for long term stock holders to do that?"
"You see; this is when you've got to be really patient and not panic on a down day.You can get too euphoric on the ""up days"" and bipolar on the down days. Understand what you own;.......tangible oil and gas reserves. It's kinda like a house with a good foundation. WTI may decisively blast through $80 next week, maybe sooner."
Will MRO hold $12 this time??? Good question. Based on bullish news for oil and GS saying oil at $90 in winter it should. There is no reason why MRO cannot close at $16 by end of year
Once again this morning you all had a chance to get the 16 options for multiple exzpiri dates at a large discount.
"MRO …all time high 5 years ago $42….Today $15 and just think…..it is 10 times better of a company as back then.,…soooooo undervalued. today….MRO has evolved into a cash gusher.. and has becomeBEST OF BREED….Management is committed to make this happen and REWARD SHAREHOLDERS GREATLY !!!

Lost seven post last night. Markets in Europe down. Markets in U.S. down. Good luck to those that jumped back in. Remember my new book. Living with squirrels. Made of soft paper so as you read it you can use it for TP paper . Should be a best seller with the Marathon crowd. Getting back to nature now is the way to go. Corn Popp said Tremors in the market. You have not seen nothing yet. Wait until the earthquake comes. I want you to know I have moved away from the cliff. I think it could give way. Glad I am not on the west coast. Going to be a bumpy ride. Take care my friends. Time to go have hot coffee and breakfast. As I posted many times only to have them removed. Don`t chase this up. Those that do will be up a limb.

You all your chance to buy the options into April 2022 this morning at a nicely discounted price. I capitalized on it and am already on all trades. GO MRO! go green baby!
Have a great weekend all. In my opinion oil stocks ready to have a big rally next 2 months. At least till earnings.
Let's try to hold 15 today and push 20 by Christmas!
Shorts are trying to scare us during the NY lunch hour ..... WTI still above 79 and Brent close to 83 .... No news on extra supply ...... Hold for Higher !

After hrs trading was up down up down up down up down . You got the idea . Anything can happen over the weekend !!!
Up here on the limb I have a better view than you. What has changed? Nothing. Today is the last day of the quarter. Marathon knocked it out of the park. If options expire today it is the same old dance routine. Make sure they don`t make money on the options.People this is Ground Hog Day because they did this 3 months ago. George Patton knew history because he lived it. You and I lived this 3 months ago. Now as George said Americans like a battle. Do not run away. Tear into those shorts. Make them spill their money.In 4th quarters we have got Dividends coming from this quarter and free cash flow in 4th quarter is going to be better so get up to the line and push forward. I will call in the big guns to counter their attack . I need everyone to pull off this pincer movement. I feel sorry for them because it is only going to get colder this winter and Marathon sells oil not bathing suit. Marathon oil and gas will keep America moving and the heat on. As George said That is all!
WOW!!! MRO up $.26 in pre-market!
"Nav if it holds true to form get back in tomorrow morning. We will not leave you stuck in that tree. We got you down before we will get you out again, if needed. Just get a small position. I have learned my lesson will never put over half of my portfolio in one stock, no matter how good I think it is. MRO will climb. I hope."
I'm at yet another Geoscientist convention this week. Pretty bullish. Some oil companies actually have budgets. I still think that $90 WTI by Q1 is not out of the question.
Dementia/DF/J and Snoopy. BlackRock reports earnings tomorrow. BLK is the symbol. BLK always goes up after earnings. Bought some today for a trade
Crude oil now $80.78!!! Wow! I say MRO $18 around earning time!
BABA outperforming all my oil stocks since I bought. I like that. I see BABA at $250 in 3 months. Jack Ma investing a ton in rural areas and making president XI one happy man.

Pre market looks good! $16.45! TGIF! Let's ride MRO train to $20 and over!
Couldn't stand it. Just placed an order for market open (which i never do on OTC stocks) because I dont care about a few pennies. And I care more about getting more MRO mas rapido. I think maybe it wont open so sky high because it did close down in after hours. I just don't wanna chance missing the oil strike and the gains ahead. And I want to sleep in tomorrow morning without worrying about executing a trade here. Sweet dreams and good luck to all on this fine board.
3 weeks until Earnings !!!! Can’t wait
Both API/EIA reported an increase in oil and gasoline supply last 2 weeks. Becoming a trend. Be careful
The chart master just on CNBC is gloomy on oil. Is our main man Navarre really Carter Worth?
"Been a while since I've posted on here since I sold my holdings back in February when we it hit $12 taking a very nice profit. Have been back in since end of August and again doing very well with this run up lately. I have all my investing money focused solely on MRO given it is a extremely well run company and a cash machine with current oil and gas prices, and based on fundamentals expect oil and gas prices to continue to climb.Did some rough estimates on increased revenue for 3rd quarter vs second and came up with an increase of $182 million with the higher avg price of oil and natural gas (calcs below). They will generate much more cash in 3rd quarter and will no doubt have very positive guidance for future quarters, and the have already exceeded their debt reduction goals for the year and stated they are shifting to return of equity to share holders, so where will all this cash go towards? Expect this to go towards stock buy backs or increased or ""special"" dividends, or combination of both. Expect an announcement later this month, which should give stock price a pop.2nd Quarter: 56% % of production that is oil 124,000 daily BOE equivalent nat gas production 159,000 daily barrels of crude oil production 744,000,000 daily cubic ft nat gas production 744,000 daily cubic ft nat gas production / 1000 to get Mcf $2.89 avg price per MMBtu $3.00 convert price to per Mcf $2,229,716 daily nat gas rev at current price $65.00 avg crude oil price $10,335,000 daily crude oil rev at current price $1,130,824,433 gross revenue for quarter3rd Quarter: 56% % of production that is oil 124,000 daily BOE equivalent nat gas production 159,000 daily barrels of crude oil production 744,000,000 daily cubic ft nat gas production 744,000 daily cubic ft nat gas production / 1000 to get Mcf $4.28 avg price per MMBtu $4.44 convert price to per Mcf $3,302,140 daily nat gas rev at current price $71.00 avg crude oil price $11,289,000 daily crude oil rev at current price $1,313,202,586 gross revenue for quarter $182,378,153 increase in revenue this quarter"
after next week's opex then we look forward to earnings bros.....MRO will blow out the doors....my guess is 19 by the end of NOV.
Folks remember 2nd quarter 2020 Marathon reported and then booked a Tax refund in 3rd quarter. I think this refund will be bigger than last year which should have helped with our debt reduction. Don`t let Glad and others fake you out. Hold the line and watch MRO go up. No need to take a tax loss and have to wait while MRO jumps big. If you buy back before time your tax loss becomes a wash sell. I have made a profit but still ahead on the buys near $14. Those dividends coming and special dividends or buy backs are going to help big. Let Glad and others sell. One rumor of a buy out or special dividend or stock buyback and his guys can wave as our boat sails away.
"Just read this on CNBC Jeffrey Halley, analyst at brokerage OANDA, said both crude contracts looked overbought based on a widely followed technical indicator, the relative strength index.“That may signal some daily pullbacks this week but does not change the underlying bullish case for oil,” he said."
MRO longs I say congratulations. I just upgraded MRO to outperform with a PT of $20. Again congratulations
Oil going higher puts JB administration in a panic mode. Hope they do not make a mistake by releasing barrels from strategic reserves. If they do it will have an impact for a couple of days and oil will rally again. Looking at the WTI chart i see the next target for WTI is $92. Oil stocks falling way behind oil price. In my opinion they will catch up next 2 months.
Longs I agree 100% with my friend Dementia. In my opinion oil stocks have peaked and are due for a pull back. Usually oil stocks peak before oil does. MRO doing better than most. Good sign. API numbers today. If numbers are similar to last 2 weeks I say we have a trend means oil and oil stocks have peaked. Seriously I do not want to see you lose all your gains again. Please pay attention to both API/EIA and act accordingly. Your friend Glad always here to help and make sure you make $$$$$.
"The American Petroleum Institute reported late Wednesday that U.S. crude supplies rose by 5.2 million barrels for the week ended Oct. 8, according to sources. The API, which released its report a day later than usual because of Monday's Columbus Day holiday, also reportedly showed inventory declines of 4.6 million barrels for gasoline and 2.7 million barrels for distillates. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Okla., storage hub, meanwhile, edged down by 2.3 million barrels for the week, sources said."
"Head fake going on, we've been going down for the past 2 hours since the highs of earlier while Brent is at 84 and WTI is over 81 ..... We'll be going back up after lunch time on Wall Street is over ....."
MRO looking solid. I like that. MRO longs comes December
Longs I say congratulations. I sold and made a huge mistake. LPI up over $5 today. I will wait and see if API/EIA give me a chance to get back in. Again congratulations all
"Nav, Lang, Snoopy, Gerald, Sharpstik, titusbythesea, Titus, Steve, and the rest of the gang. I sold my remaking 25k shares @ 14.98$. I hated to but have been holding for over a year started buying @ 5.50 and kept chasing it down to 3.55$ accumulated 405,000 shares @ avg. 4.99$. Sold 75k shares last year @ 7.50$ then another 50k @ 10.25$ bought back 50k shares a few months ago between 13.75 and 13. 10$. Sold 330,000 shares today from 14.60 to 14.98. I really hope I sold to low. I’m 69 years old and have made enough and to put to risk any more would be foolish for me. I’ve enjoyed all the dialect we’ve shared. If it comes down ( I hope for you all it doesn’t ) I will buy back in smaller quantities. Good luck to all longs, it will continue to climb."
"Not trying to shill up th feed but, I sold mine. May be a bit more upside, but oil has been on a 2 week rip. Feels like big money is pushing it to dump. Stinks don't only go up. Just feels like red week incoming. If you are still in GLTY! I hope for you I made a mistake. If it drops though I will re buy in a midwest 2nd. Great stock."
Thought of the day. Marathon sounds like a Sci Fi. movie. We have gone from a ant hill to a mountain. Just remember a lot of those mountains in the ocean were volcanoes. Now and then they blow up and sink beneath the waves. Being I was on a limb so long I had time to think. How many times have we seen oil traders screw the price of WTI which screws the price of Marathon oil. I tell you I may have missed a little profit at $15.03 but at the end of the day my balance is real. I don`t trust the price of WTI and I don`t trust the stock market now. It is a house of cards so be careful when you shut the door so the wind does not crater your house of cards. Hey Sharpstick I will bring the cheese to your whine party. You will look back and say I am glad I cashed in when I did. I never had millions like you and Mike. I am like Joe Kennedy . He saw the crash and sold before the crash and I did too. Wonder when it happens this month? Maybe history will repeat on Oct 29 again.

Is there a real energy crisis??? Or the Algorithms manipulating oil and natgas prices??? We saw last 2 weeks both API/EIA release increase in both oil and gasoline supply.

"Institutions already own over 76% of the existing 780 outstanding shares. So if MRO gets on a ""run"" the obvious potential shortage of shares to buy could create an interesting upward ""squeeze""..! This could get very interesting, very quickly..!"
13.33....needs to hold ...then 14.17 ( when it clears ) 14.17 hopefully on hi volume.......excellent buy point !
"Marathon Oil Just took profits , owned since 4, added at $6 bucks a share I would Sell now but ur call - good luck to all , MRO Profit taking about to slam It 2-3 points lower . We’ve Been buying This since 4-6 bucks . PE ratio is 526X earnings Time to sell ,If you just bought I would cut your loss take profit or get out break even and buy it back at 13. In a week or 2-3 weeks. Be smart !!Before you Hold it and regret it !!"
"Hold ontight now. And when you can, buy on the downtick today. MRO is a tight pair of pants ready to rip. I'm in all the way from single digit to OVER $16! LOL! I am on a higher limb than @Navarre was. Only I got a ladder I climb up and down, or a vine i can swing on. Because I am up 300% on all my other shares. Being Snoopy and I got super smell powers. And I sniff something very sweet coming our way from MRO.. No BS. Just fields of green. The MM's job is to hold us back as long as they can. They know MRO is NO day trade.

"Considering that the market was down, MRO is doing great.Furthermore, if OPEC does increase production by 400k per day, THAT is NOTHING compared to increased consumption worldwide. That increased supply is a ""non-event"" and is not enough to stop oil from going to $90 by Q1 2022."

"sorry folks but there are at least 10,000 + contracts out for MRO at 16 and 16.50 combined...I do not believe we will see it close above that until late tomorrow or monday. market makers will rob you on the options...that is why you sell when you have yourself a profit in options."

"WOOF! More MRO news. ""Surging Earnings Estimates Signal Upside for Marathon Oil (MRO) Stock""Thu, October 14, 2021, 9:20 AM - Zak's Equity Research""Marathon Oil (MRO) could be a solid choice for investors given the company's remarkably improving earnings outlook. While the stock has been a strong performer lately, this trend might continue since analysts are still raising their earnings estimates for the company.The rising trend in estimate revisions, which is a result of growing analyst optimism on the earnings prospects of this energy company, should get reflected in its stock price. After all, empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. Our stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- has this insight at its core.The five-grade Zacks Rank system, which ranges from a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record of outperformance, with Zacks #1 Ranked stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 2008.For Marathon Oil, strong agreement among the covering analysts in revising earnings estimates upward has resulted in meaningful improvement in consensus estimates for the next quarter and full year.The chart below shows the evolution of forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimate:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/surging-earnings-estimates-signal-upside-162004844.html"

"Well, here we go, another struggle to hold a threshold, now it is $15. With WTI over $78 and Natural Gas up over 5% today one has to wonder what MRO is going to do with all of that cash... Maybe change their stock symbol to ""MORE"".Saw an interesting article on Oilprice this morning about commodity traders in trouble over the short positions in the energy market. Apparently the brokerage houses want them to deposit millions more into their accounts to cover the risk of being short energy. So sad to hear this, poor bustards!"
With bond market closed today these oilers were slow. This could have been a good time to buy some of these. Time will tell. I expect tomorrow to be up across the board. Oil is over 80!! The energy story is solid!!

Guess what sector has proven to out perform during high consumer prices.. alias inflation? Yep. Energy. Stay put
"High Natural Gas Prices Could Lead To 2 Million Bpd Extra Oil Demand""With the global energy market remaining on fire, natural gas prices are increasingly impacting crude oil as well, with consumers looking for cheaper fuels to substitute. Indeed, a major anomaly has now emerged: Power producers are doing an about-face by switching from costly natural gas to oil, a reversal from the decade-long trend of transitioning from costly oil to cheaper and cleaner natural gas.It's a budding but rapidly growing trend that could boost global crude demand by a good 2 million b/d in the space of just a few years.To put the current elevated prices into perspective, experts are saying that gas prices are now trading at the equivalent of more than $200 per barrel of oil, with Europe and Asia the hardest hit, making oil look dirt-cheap in comparison despite its own impressive rally.But with the likes of JP Morgan recently saying that the economy can handle $150 oil, other analysts saying hyperinflation will see oil prices hit $180/barrel by the end of 2022 and OPEC+ clearly willing to defend higher prices, it will be interesting to see how far this oil bull will run.""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/high-natural-gas-prices-could-230000670.html"
I still don't see the API report. Has it been released?$lpi $mro $cdev
From InvestorBrandNetwork - Marathon Oil Corporation has a potential upside of 161.8% based on a current price of $14.61 and analysts’ consensus price target of $38.25.
"WTI at $75 per barrel adjusted for inflation is the equivalent to $63 per barrel 7 years ago. Back then oil was at $102 per barrel, which would be $118 per barrel today (+15.6% inflation since 2014). So even $90 oil ($76 adjusted for inflation from 2014) is still cheap people!"

"Been in here since the 3.90 days. Accumulated a good bit of shares. If this retraces back 15.00 I'm out. Off to work so good luck to all, hopefully the the stop loss won't hit. Just can't watch my profit disappear again."

"Risk takers, Last Friday at close I bought ALLO. A Pharma developing new cancer drug. They had 1 case of abnormality and FDA temporary stopped trials. Happens all time with Pharma. I bought at close Friday. Worth taking a risk on well managed company. Upward potential is huge. Seriously. Stock was down by 46% when I bought. Take a look. I like to take risks and gamble as long as odds are on my side."
When are they going to raise the target price to low 20's. They are going to blow away this quarters earnings

"When I read posts saying holding MRO Till $100.I know it’s time to sell, as the New shareholders seem pretty green. Any weakness they will bail on the way down. Prices to steep for me . Things don’t keep going higher forever . Just when you think something is definitely going toKeep going up , the big boys dumpMark my words been doing A long long time folks. Be careful out there"
Roll it again!
"It's been a wild ride - 40% up in 3 weeks! So what do you guys predict for next 3 weeks? One would think a pullback is due, but with the likely great earnings coming in 3 weeks ...?"
Shorts have left the room . This stock should now respond.
Talking corpse met with oil executives and discussed the possibility to produce more oil and gasoline. hahahaha. He does not realize that demand is soaring and these companies do not have the capacity to add more oil. Most cut CAPEX by at least 30%. During the campaign he tried to destroy them and now he begging for more oil. Unbelievable
80 dollars -35 dollars = big profits. umm.
"Chart like anything else is not perfect, But I've found its the near the best considering 70% of the trade are now driven by Algo's. The other side is big picture, just get the trend right and have the conviction to stay with your trade."
"The easy money has been made on this one. Those who were savvy enough to buy large blocks of shares between $3-$5 during the pandemic have bagged 3 to 5 times their money. One of the best decisions you've probably ever made. You are now living on easy street and deserve every penny you made for taking the risk and holding! Hopefully many of you can retire from gains like that. From here though, there's only enough upside left in MRO to possibly double your money again, if everything goes perfect for the industry in the next year or two. The risk of holding a 6-7 figure position here is far greater than it was at $5-$11. Hold carefully above $15!"
"Not bad at all. Oil went from no exposure to now all over the TV. Hope we see some new money in, and get proper follow thru"
$20 coming by end of year whether Jim Cramer likes it or not.
"Oil has now blown past the highest price since 2014. In 2018, oil hit a high of $77. Shortly after that MRO hit a high stock price of $23. Because of the pandemic, MRO tightened up operating expenses last year so we are better off now than in 2018. We are underpriced by 40% give or take. There is still huge run left in this. Check the past charts and hold firm. You'll be sorry if you don't."
50% gains in 3 weeks for many oilers. Looking for a pullback to add to positions again. Seems like its due. Its been a joy ride!
I should have bought at 4...5...6....7....8....9....10....11....12.....13....14.....15. !!!!!!!
"Yeaahhh, if we could just settle at 16.50 today, That'd be greaaaattt..."
"Out of all the trading I've done for 25 years commodity have burnt me the most. It's the greed that will kill you every time. Oil and gold, silver, mining stocks are like Compulsive gambling problems. It comes so big so fast it's hard to let go. These new young traders are going to get wiped out by this when they find it."
Seriously antifa glad? Everything Chinese with you now? Everyone knew for 2 years you hated America but this seems to be too much now. Follow those politicians blindly

some profit takers today but I am holding out till 18s
"All, it is well known that MRO will blow off the doors on earnings; I know this is typical of wall street to ebb and flow a stock to get weak hands out. with high ownership by institutions, MRO will rise, but there will be a lot of this back and forth...remember that the goal is to frustrate and get people to sell...many have large profits and most peolpe get afraid when the stock swings 5-6 percent so they sell to keep most of waht they got rationalizing that the profit is good enough. I am bullish on oil equities and have been for a long time to my own detriment in some cases, but I do be;lieve we are going to 80 on oil before OCT 30 and over 100 next year."
"***must read….MRO …highest share price ever was just under $42 Sept 2014.Today we are scraping between $11.50and $14…TODAY……MRO has established record results with no end in sight….MRO Has evolved into a cash machine…..The are soooo much more of a company as compared to Sept. 2014…….MRO can easily double as it gets more noticed and catches on fire……shorts selling, variable healthy dividend, stock buy back, stimulus bill, buyout candidate….are all in our back pocket !!!! Enjoy the ride as the wait is almost over….Good Luck Longs!!!"
Good morning been gone. Glad to see MRO up but how long. If supply and demand are the factors why did last week show crude oil storage up and gasoline storage up? I tell you this is a oil traders rally and when the powers to be stop oil exports again and release from our oil storage you will see how quick you can get stuck up a tree. Good luck to all. I do not own any oil stocks now. I see the writing on the wall. Old Noah called for a flood. Looks mighty dry at the moment but I see tears coming . I will hold my dry powder for that day.
