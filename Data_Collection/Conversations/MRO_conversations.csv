I see that Marathon Oil Corporation has now paid off 1.4 billion in debt obligations thru the year 2025. This is all very good news to see it. With that said I'm hoping the company now turns the attention to the shareholders and we see a moderate buyback of shares and or a dividend increase. Would be terrific to see them double the dividend payout from where its at now.
All this talk about the quarter report. Chevron just reported beat the street by a wide margin. Best results for them in 8 years or more. The price of the stock is up only 1.14%. So why hold it any longer. Take the money and run Steve Miller.
"It pretty probable that this will be the last time to buy MRO under 17. Next week will be the beginning of an oil patch rally. Keep in mind that although this Q will be unprecedented for oil earnings, realized oil prices were around 65-72. Q4 will be another $5+ higher . NG I cant keep up with but remains crazy high>"
CVX reports highest free cash flow on record during Q3. 2.96 EPS and revenue jumped 80% yoy to 44.7B. street estimate was 2.21 EPS and 40.52B rev..
MIke I said buy X below $22. IT hit $25 yesterday before shorts sold off to $23.32. I bought 7000 more shares because I think X is going to knock it out of the park. Having been around many of the mines and mills I like what price action I am seeing. In Asia and Europe they don`t have enough NG and coal to go around. This means their mills are not running very long. U.S. Steel is booked and double booked for orders. So you watch a stock like DWAC go higher and say do I buy? You Don`t and it goes higher. X will be that stock by close tomorrow if not Friday.
"US Oil Demand Surges, Depleting Oklahoma Storage Hub“Storage at Cushing alone has the potential to really rally the market to the moon,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.Stephanie Kelly, ReutersWed, 10/27/2021 - 08:10 AMCrude oil tanks at the Cushing, Oklahoma storage hub are more depleted than they have been in the last three years, and prices of further dated oil contracts suggest they will stay lower for months.U.S. demand for crude among refiners making gasoline and diesel has surged as the economy has recovered from the worst of the pandemic. Demand across the globe means other countries have looked to the United States for crude barrels, also boosting draws out of Cushing.Analysts expect the draw on inventories to continue in the short-term, which could further boost U.S. crude prices that have already climbed by about 25% in the last two months. The discount on U.S. crude futures to the international Brent benchmark should stay narrow."
BUY…MRO…by end of day Friday as the start of next week other oil stocks report Monday and Tuesday…it is going to get a little exciting…very long very strong….buy while it is on sale
Note to self......Selling this MRO position while oil is firmly been holding above $80bbl would be an extremely poor decision based on the looming energy shortages that are sure to come.
I see Petrobras of Brazil just posted earnings smashing profit and margin estimates across the board. That company is worth incredible amounts of money with a Market Cap of 383b. The dividend is at 3.22 (10.99%)..Lets listen to the earnings call to see what MRO has planned for investors. IMO the dividend needs some work to at least to get it up to where its keeping up with inflation. Right now for example if the stock would remain at 16 dollars all next year you would be loosing money keeping it because of the low dividend..My price target for 2022 is at 22 dollars..Only the best to all of you.
Monday world oil shortage demand up. Tuesday huge demand inventories lower. Wednesday panic not enough oil Europe is desperate for natural Gas. Thursday China is going back to coal can't get oil etc.Friday Problem solved we are all good in 24 Hrs. This is great get out the popcorn.
"Bloomberg- Energy Squeeze Will Trigger Unrest, Says Blackstone’s Schwarzman- Tue, October 26, 2021, (Bloomberg) -- Blackstone Inc. co-founder Stephen Schwarzman said the world is facing energy shortages so severe they could cause social unrest.“We’re going to end up with a real shortage of energy,” he said at a conference in Saudi Arabia. “And when you have a shortage it’s just going to cost more and it’s probably going to cost a lot more. And when that happens you’re going to get very unhappy people around the world, in the emerging markets in particular.”His comments were echoed by Larry Fink, who said there’s a high probability of oil soon reaching $100 a barrel, especially with many governments and investors pushing back against investments in fossil fuels.“Inflation, we are in a new regime,” said Fink, chairman of BlackRock Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager. “There are many structural reasons for that. Short term policy related to environmentalism, in terms of restricting supply of hydrocarbons, has created energy inflation and we are going to be living with that for some time.”"
Everyone is focused on the 2% decline in oil and not paying any attention to the 2% increase in natural gas prices. 49% of MRO's production is in Natural Gas. So how much did this on time decline in oil really cost MRO? This decline in price is a buying opportunity. Yesterday we got a price target increase to $23 from $17 from Mizuho Securities.
"Glad is getting political, we knew he would. Look at LPI and Baba today"
Get Real…MRO Regular dividend is exactly what needed to happen as that is the normal long term right thing to do. THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING….shorts are looking for any reason to bash ….Next week is payday back to shareholders as promised with deep commitment from Top Management to make it happen!! The pause in oil stock prices was necessary as stock turns over and will continue towards record highs…..the only risk begins if oil goes below $40 a barrel….what are the chances of that? VERY VERY LONG AND VERY VERY LONG…….patience will be rewarded GREATLY !! Watch and see!!

"Hope all in MRO had a wonderful day. Me and my posse had a great day in X land. We fought the gang of shorts and won returning with bags of money to return to the bank. It was a great day for such a short investment period. Maybe instead of posse I should call it Navarre`s raiders. You see I believe you get in and get out. Let the other guy fall in love with his stock. I tell you I learned a lot being up that limb without a ladder. Know the stock you invest in . That means doing DD and find which way the wind is blowing in the stock market. I have done this from Boeing to NCLH and many more. It is one thing to say buy this stock. It is another when they have skin in the game and tell people when to get in and when to get out. Timing no. Getting a feel for the market and jumping in when you see the wave is coming . Will my friends we rode the wave today and come next year Uncle Sam will love me . Because I bought at $21,75 and sold at $26.80. Not bad. Not bad at all. Have a great weekend ! Oh and it was a lot of shares."
Opec reduces oil deficit projections to 300k boe/day from 1.1m. This will justify them NOT increasing or adjusting their plan to gradually increase as demand increases. Sorry Joe. Opec+ meeting and earning next week will be the next catalyst higher. Stay tuned and don't give em up.
Low volume today across the patch. Meaningless day. Great day to add to your positions.
"One more update on Suncor as I hope that something similar could happen with MRO. Suncor Energy (SU) misses Q3 earnings and revenue estimates, BAD NEWS right? Look at their chart, yesterday they were at $22.89, now after hours, $26.19. They DID announce a strong dividend, yet they missed earnings. Also the Board approved an increase to the company’s share repurchase program to approximately 7% of Suncor’s public float."
"AMZN, SBUX, AAPL all missed earnings. Time to sell that stuff and move into the cash cows in the oil patch!"
