AEE and other utilities are way overpriced. I am not selling though. Just not buying. My basis is in the low to mid 40's from 07 and 08. PE is in the clouds.
Wow what a dive this has been taking

AEE is up 4.92% to 55.18
I've owned AEE for decades. This run is almost unbelievable. I know utilities are up but this is overly so. Anyone have any clues why? Bout ready to take some off the table.
Ameren is up 5.47% to 76.36
"Dividend increases inches closer to 2008 dividend of 63 cents quarterly. For long term investors who reinvested dividends, this has produced many shares."
AEE reached an all time high at 77.43
AEE is down 4.94% to 77.54
"They increased the dividend 5.77% to 0.55, payable 3/31/2021, record 3/10/2021. That's an increase on the previous dividend paid 12/31/2020 of 0.515, which was an increase over the 9/30/2020 dividend of 0.495. Very strange."

"only buy in the money, the out of the money is very true you will be out of money. they will take an ask price with a bid then the stock drops 1 penny and your done check mate no bid"

Why don't they split this stock the price is too high for people to buy it and the dividend to low
"At this price, AEE is not an investment stock. I have owned it since the early 70's, and the dividend is now at a point that no investor should buy. I will wait to add to my portfolio until this stock pulls back quite a bit."
