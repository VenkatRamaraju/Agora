AEE and other utilities are way overpriced. I am not selling though. Just not buying. My basis is in the low to mid 40's from 07 and 08. PE is in the clouds.
AEE is up 6.53% to 65.38
"Dividend increases inches closer to 2008 dividend of 63 cents quarterly. For long term investors who reinvested dividends, this has produced many shares."
AEE is down 4.94% to 81.80
"They increased the dividend 5.77% to 0.55, payable 3/31/2021, record 3/10/2021. That's an increase on the previous dividend paid 12/31/2020 of 0.515, which was an increase over the 9/30/2020 dividend of 0.495. Very strange."
AEE is up 4.99% to 69.24
I've owned AEE for decades. This run is almost unbelievable. I know utilities are up but this is overly so. Anyone have any clues why? Bout ready to take some off the table.
AEE is down 6.01% to 71.57
AEE is up 4.92% to 55.18

Why don't they split this stock the price is too high for people to buy it and the dividend to low
"At this price, AEE is not an investment stock. I have owned it since the early 70's, and the dividend is now at a point that no investor should buy. I will wait to add to my portfolio until this stock pulls back quite a bit."
AEE reached a new All Time High at $68.19
