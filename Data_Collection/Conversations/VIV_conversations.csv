I want to buy but is the dividend distributed?
"Again at the year's low and close to a 5 year low. Analysts average target is over 50% higher than the current price. How much of it do you think is because of the strong dollar? At the current PE, it doesn't have to grow but is it losing business to competitors and in danger of declining revenue. Nothing says that's the case. Huge dividend. Last analyst revision is an upgrade from Morgan Stanley to overweight. Add more?"

"Is there a foreign tax withholding on VIV dividends? I was under the impression there was not, but my broker still withholds the tax. My VIV stocks are in my IRA, if that makes a difference."

What a stock price disaster (for me). I’d normally average down however I can’t get any information regarding the directreason for the decline. SMH
Why the gap? 
VIV reached a new 52 Week High at 17.23
Anyone know why this stock keeps dropping? Earnings and PE look ok.
Has had a number of positive comments from analysts. Should continue heading up.
"There is news about an upcoming distribution on the Company website. Unfortunately I do not read Portuguese, so take the following with a grain of salt. I believe that holders of record on September 30 will be entitled to receive a distribution in the approximate amount of 30 Brazilian centavos per share representing ""interest on capital."" This amount is after deducting a 15% withholding tax. Based on current exchange rates a centavo is worth about $0.0019 U.S.If I'm correct, that translates to about 5.7 U.S. cents for each VIV share. The payment date is to be fixed by the Board, and it could be as late as July 22 of next year. While that may sound crazy, my broker shows a record date of April 16 for a dividend to be paid on October 12. Here is a link to the notice - https://ri.telefonica.com.br/pt/documentos/2403-Aviso-aos-Acionistas-Deliberacao-de-JSCP-16-SETEMBRO-2021.pdf"

What's up with VIVs dividend payments? I've owned VIV since Sept 2018 and haven't gotten any dividend payments yet. I checked VIVs official website releases and they said it would pay the 9/05/18 dividend today (8/20/19) but nothing was posted to my account. Has anyone else gotten dividends over the past year?
