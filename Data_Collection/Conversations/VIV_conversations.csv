"The pandemic is ravaging Brazil, so VIV will unlikely do much until the country is stabilize. The country and the stock trended the wrong direction in the last 10+ years."
Only thing I can think of is the political unrest in Brazil otherwise looks like an undervalued stock?
"Guys, check out http://the-alphatrader.com/. They have been crushing it lately while VIV barley does anything at all."
Technical indicators are looking bullish. A break of 12.58 could move it up to 14.69 in short term. http://www.stoxline.com/stock_chart/VIV.gif
VIV reached a new 52 Week Low at 12.54
"Is there a foreign tax withholding on VIV dividends? I was under the impression there was not, but my broker still withholds the tax. My VIV stocks are in my IRA, if that makes a difference."
Apparently no one really wants to talk about VIV :) Anyone?
This baby going back to $19 per share

TRADFING HALTED?
"i don t understand the ex div date in October. Yahoo says 1 Oct, IBKR 18 Oct."

What's up with VIVs dividend payments? I've owned VIV since Sept 2018 and haven't gotten any dividend payments yet. I checked VIVs official website releases and they said it would pay the 9/05/18 dividend today (8/20/19) but nothing was posted to my account. Has anyone else gotten dividends over the past year?
Easy buy. Massive discount. Great long-term hold.
I am amazed how well my buy indicator works. When I sell everyone should buy. Sold at 7.75. Started going up immediately....
Does anyone know when the dividend date is on this?
Bought a small block today. Looks very undervalued right here.
"Nice day today, this company should be at $14 by first quarter of next year"

Tried to get info from IR on the dividend payout date. Can anyone out there help? Frustrated and ready to sell.
VIV reached a new 52 Week High at 17.23
Up 4% today. Any news?
"Anyone out there? This stock is up 3.4% today, I can't find any news on VIV, and the Brazilian Real has not moved that much. However, there is a news worthy SPAC with William Ackman’s Pershing Square Tontine Holdings (PSTH.N) is doing a deal with Vivend (symbol VIV.PA)Maybe a confusion trade?? It wouldn't be the first."
What a stock price disaster (for me). I’d normally average down however I can’t get any information regarding the directreason for the decline. SMH
"When is ex dividend date? In some places I read April 16, but it’s not listed on Yahoo."
Anyone know why this stock keeps dropping? Earnings and PE look ok.
VIV reached a new 52 Week Low at 9.62
VIV is down -4.92% to 11.21
I don't understand why people are selling shares of this company at this price.
"Per Yahoo the div is 9%+, is that correct? Picked up a few shares for my dividend portfolio."
Added today. Why the fall-off before ex date?
"There is news about an upcoming distribution on the Company website. Unfortunately I do not read Portuguese, so take the following with a grain of salt. I believe that holders of record on September 30 will be entitled to receive a distribution in the approximate amount of 30 Brazilian centavos per share representing ""interest on capital."" This amount is after deducting a 15% withholding tax. Based on current exchange rates a centavo is worth about $0.0019 U.S.If I'm correct, that translates to about 5.7 U.S. cents for each VIV share. The payment date is to be fixed by the Board, and it could be as late as July 22 of next year. While that may sound crazy, my broker shows a record date of April 16 for a dividend to be paid on October 12. Here is a link to the notice - https://ri.telefonica.com.br/pt/documentos/2403-Aviso-aos-Acionistas-Deliberacao-de-JSCP-16-SETEMBRO-2021.pdf"
Great dividend and will increase earnings going forward.
what s happening?
"Again at the year's low and close to a 5 year low. Analysts average target is over 50% higher than the current price. How much of it do you think is because of the strong dollar? At the current PE, it doesn't have to grow but is it losing business to competitors and in danger of declining revenue. Nothing says that's the case. Huge dividend. Last analyst revision is an upgrade from Morgan Stanley to overweight. Add more?"

the next dividend is OCT5th...is that correct?
this company has great fundamentals... likely to boost sales due to the better quality fiber installs... parent company Telefonica is huge.
high volume today finally getting the recognition it deserves
