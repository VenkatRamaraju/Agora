Anyone’s shares get tendered?
So the WSJ got it first: Merck made a bid for 11bn buy out
according to bloomberg BMY is going to tender their shares. They own 11.5 percent so this goes a long way to getting this deal done.
BMY and insiders alone hold over 23% of XLRN shares. Over 50% of shares should easily be tendered! 1 1/2 mil shares short still working so hard to get your shares. Not much time left and difficult with this low vol!
"It's a crazy market if XLRN does not jump close to $180 soon. Where do you find a solid return these days? The market is probably heading south buy XLRN is giving you a 3% return in a short time, probably less than 2 months which is analyzed to be 18%."
"Merck Launches Tender Offer to Buy Acceleron Pharma at $180 Per ShareBY M-T N-e-w-s-w-i-r-e-sMerck ( MRK) said Tuesday it is launching a cash tender offer to buy all of Acceleron Pharma's ( XLRN) common shares.Once the tender offer is completed, stockholders of Acceleron will receive $180 in cash for each Acceleron validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the offer.The deal is expected to close in Q4. Upon closing, Acceleron will become a subsidiary of Merck ( MRK).The tender offer will expire at 5:00 p.m. ET on Nov. 10, according to a statement."
AdtxThe magnificent one
"(B-l-o-o-m-b-e-r-g) ---- Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. is planning to tender its shares in Acceleron Pharma Inc. after Merck & Co. agreed to buy the biotechnology company for $11.5 billion, according to people with knowledge of the matter."
Takeover by Merck? At what price?
"So is there a vote, or do they just get to take the shares?"
"Some are working hard to get every last share, esp hoping the little guy will give up theirs!"
I find it crazy that no one comments on this board. A nearly 20% jump in the last 5 days alone! And higher volumes. Wow
If Merck is buying this Company at 180 a share why would the stock fall?
"Come on people, just tender your shares so we can close this deal out!"
Any one can tell closing date of this deal? TIA
i think xlrn will pop this week big time !!!!! pipline about mrk and others...last chance before hiting 250$
"Since acquisition announcement, over 29m shares of XLRN have been traded. Also, over 8m shares were traded based on rumor before the deal announcement.Who is buying/selling these shares? Of course, MRK or some funds working for MRK are buying these shares at a discount. Not a bad deal for MRK. When MRK see enough share in its pocket then it can tender offer the rest."
you're either gonna get 180 dollars or more. Unlikely this falls through since both parties want this. A couple of funds think its too low but they only hold less than 10 percent of the shares and all they need is 50 percent plus a share so this is easy money IMO
So far I’m only seeing Avoro Capital and Halocine Investors which each own about 7% of XLRN as hold outs on tendering their shares. Anyone see any others with over 5% not tendering?
"40 points. no news. Gee, you think there might be something illegal going on ? Who's buying ???"
