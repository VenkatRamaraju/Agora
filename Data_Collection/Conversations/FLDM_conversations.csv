Any buyers for this company ? IMO this company will be bought by a big one soon.
CODX had no issues during COVID they are making $$$. There is problem with this CEO & BOD loosing money every year since going public 2011. Get someone that can run profitable company or just sell it.
Infrastructure bill will trigger many hospitals/health care to buy enhanced diagnostics to future proof against pandemics and quickly separate variants from common flu etc…..at $200k a pop more money to health care infrastructure has to help this business in next 12 months.
"Market up, FLDM down big. Not good."
Lot of action on the 7.50 August and September strikes looks like somebody expects a big move upward! YES!!!!!
I am sensing #FLDM will have a buyer this weekend.
I sold rode it up and rode it down and broke even. I came to conclusion that it was good tech but they don’t have scale to be profitable….will be good acquisition for a bigger company but not worth the risk to wait….and shouldn’t sell for more than a 30% premium to market price so more downside than upside….my two cents. Pfizer is a better (and safer) bet.
No reason to sell.
OUCH
"Down 10% on no news, looks like fund manager just dumped 480K shares , guess had enough with FLDM."
"Hot off the stocktwits presses:Well...yahoo finance is not allowing me to cut and paste from stocktwits (apparently, they have an anti-stocktwits police force on duty)...so let me reiterate the message if not the exact words.BTIG analyst Sung Ji Nam, who has multiple life sciences (biology, etc.) undergraduate degrees and a Harvard MBA, just released her updated research report on Fluidigm, as follows:https://research.btig.com/reports/264ab533-0b3c-4c94-b2b9-78a6b07ad6ff/You'll need to log in, and log in may require a corporate or university email, and not a yahoo, google, aol, hotmail, etc. email.If you can't get in, just know that she reiterates her BUY and $12 price target.She highlights in the title of the report the ""Strong Recovery for the Base Business"" and that Fluidigm is ""Well-Positioned for Accelerated Growth Ahead with the Upcoming New Product Launches Across Mass Cytometry and Microfluidics"".I hope my cutting and pasting the excerpts from the report title will not cause the stocktwits police to spring into action. :)"
Assuming health care conference didn’t go so good.
Any thoughts on why moving 4% higher….link to options price rise in September…..something brewing?
It kind of looks like COVID is sticking around into winter. Stock sure seems like it can head higher any day now. so few sellers
"Any thoughts if they will be acquired, what the stock price would be?"
This stock got Covid.
These days I am hoping this company will be bought by some big company and hanging. I didn’t sell even when it went up to $7.50 levels. Now I need to think what value we are going to get holding this for a long time. Any one have any idea about this or any suggestions?
I think management totally sand bagged their Covid testing declines….governments and health care around world will continue to invest in testing especially Fluidigm that can identify new variants and viruses…..it will take several months but fully expect them to continue to grow this segment until at least mid 2022….
Fluidigms science is incredibly strong (family member works in research at hospital) - machine always in high demand. Demand will increase as world looks for next variants and for role in DNA mapping….the future of health care. Only weak spot with this company is scale…..they will be bought by one of the leading diagnostics companies…..I continue to believe this will be 15 before end of year.
Good to go against the trend. All major indexes are down. FLDM when up 21cents.
