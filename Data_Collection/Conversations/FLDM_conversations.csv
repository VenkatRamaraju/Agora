Fluidigms science is incredibly strong (family member works in research at hospital) - machine always in high demand. Demand will increase as world looks for next variants and for role in DNA mapping….the future of health care. Only weak spot with this company is scale…..they will be bought by one of the leading diagnostics companies…..I continue to believe this will be 15 before end of year.
What happened to earnings release before market opened? Did someone forget to post it???
"Shorts stepped in bigtime and broke the momentum- annoying, but kind of impressive as they bought a short term reprieve. won't last. Would be nice if the analysts would step in and defend the stock, but they're likely too busy adding- UBS Group AG reports 522.98% increase in ownership of FLDM / Fluidigm Corp.July 31, 2020 - UBS Group AG has filed a 13F-HR form disclosing ownership of 953,414 shares of Fluidigm Corp. (US:FLDM) with total holdings valued at $3,823,000 USD as of June 30, 2020. UBS Group AG had filed a previous 13F-HR on May 01, 2020 disclosing 153,042 shares of Fluidigm Corp. at a value of $389,000 USD. This represents a change in shares of 522.98 percent and a change in value of 882.78 percent during the quarter.UBS Group AG has a history of taking positions in derivatives of the underlying security (FLDM) in the form of stock options.Other investors with positions similar to UBS Group AG include Connor, Clark & Lunn Investment Management Ltd., Tiaa Cref Investment Management Llc, California Public Employees Retirement System, Intellectus Partners, LLC, QS Investors, LLC, and Squarepoint Ops LLC."
Total speculation but with delta variant spreading quickly I bet testing revenues will be revised again but this time to the upside
"Today's news from HHS was about introducing Fluidigm's testing at Waco, TX based surge testing only, but HHS has been maintaining 21 such localities in 10 states.As per HHS, saliva based testing will be introduced in all surge test locations.. more to come for Fluidigm..Sky is the limit..---“Saliva tests are easy to perform, and many people may find them more comfortable than nasal swab tests,” said ADM Brett Giroir, M.D., HHS assistant secretary for health. “Our goal is to build our nation’s capacity for reliable, accurate and timely testing so that every American who needs a COVID-19 test -- including those who do not have symptoms -- can get one. Offering different types of tests helps us meet this goal.”Since the surge testing site program launched in July, 362,000 tests have been conducted at surge testing sites in 10 states and 21 localities.----"
"Not sure how widely known this stock is, but with how the company is expanding its partnerings and contracts, both domestic and abroad, it’s sure to be getting more attention in short order."
Why does FLDM have a higher market cap then CODX... CODX is already on market with a highly profitable product line for a limited duration pandemic...? FLDM just now coming to market and loses money
"$FLDM is mentioned here,https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-delivering-new-covid-19-testing-technologies-meet-us-demand"
"For all those posting about how this stock should go down, why? Please explain this to me.It had a tremendous Q3 of $40 million with positive cash flow. Plus $11 million in NIH grant money. It had its all time record Q4 with $44 million in revenues PLUS approx. $15 million in grants via more milestones met. So how is this a ""dog"" or a ""looser"" (sic)?Why is this going down when other companies have 20, 30, 40, 100 (PACB) price to sales ratio and this has a 2.5 price to sales ratio? Why is this company the dog when companies like Sorrento, around since 2009, just reported $40 million in revenues during all of 2020, a $298 plus million dollar loss during 2020, and had to issue 100 million shares of stock during 2020 just to survive (it has a 3 billion market cap)?What is it about this company that makes it THE target of shorts? I'd really like to know."
CODX had no issues during COVID they are making $$$. There is problem with this CEO & BOD loosing money every year since going public 2011. Get someone that can run profitable company or just sell it.
"FLDM is expected to beat the Q4 estimate of -$0.07 easily. Let’s assume the worst scenario and see what can happen. In Q3, FLDM served 0.795M tests and sold 30 PCR machines. In Q4, the number of PCR machines activated for Covid test increased from 12 to 41 and the manufacturing capacity increased from 2M to 6M tests. Roughly speaking, there is a ratio of 3. As a result, the worst scenario is that FLDM would serve only 0.795M x 3 = 2.4M for a revenue of $18M. As for the PCR machines, the worst scenario is to sell only 15 units for a revenue of $3M. The total Covid test revenue would become $21M, which is about $11M more than $10M in Q3. The additional earning would be $5.5M for a contribution of $0.07 per share. Assume all other activities remain unchanged. The earning was -$0.08 in Q3, so the worst earning would be -$0.01 in Q4. This -$0.01 is much better than -$0.07 estimated by analysts. Again, it is based on the worst-case analysis. As posted before, the real earnings are expected to be much better."
If you build it they will come. FLDM has built the tools and reagents that will be in high demand across growing areas of research that will better lives. Data proves the products and tests are of superior quality and hands-off scale. Instruments are becoming the gold standard of the industry and FLDM is gaining more exposure through this Covid crisis. This is only the tip of the iceberg. FLDM's future is very bright and the current stock price will prove to be a 10 bagger in the long-run.
Infrastructure bill will trigger many hospitals/health care to buy enhanced diagnostics to future proof against pandemics and quickly separate variants from common flu etc…..at $200k a pop more money to health care infrastructure has to help this business in next 12 months.
"easy answer, no need to keep guessing. schools are going to be covid testing in NY, fldm provides the lab kits.....that'll be happening more and more IMHO....so rev's should keep perking up"
"People still don't understand what this stock is about. It's not about the Oklahoma test awaiting FDA approval, it's about the DARPA/Princeton/Duke/Mt. Sinai super test that last we heard is still being validated. That's where an explosion could happen. I'm very curious when the institutional investors hopped on. I haven't seen institutional holdings this high."

Fldm is directly inline with saliva direct. Pro sports and college sports will most likely adopt machines to use tests with saliva which are less invasive. 24 hr results is more than efficient enough for practical reasons. Just because you have a 30 min result isn’t practical because you need reagents which cost extra money and other byproducts like cotton swabs and chemicals which can be in low supply and will require to be stocked up. Not practice at all and doesn’t make business sense in long run
Anyone think shorts a little nervous right now:)))?
Any thoughts on if they discuss the sale at the earnings call
What just happened and why? 
Nice little update on fluidgm's Twitter. Holding a presser tomorrow afternoon about the new diagnostic test and probably give some insight as to how fda approval is coming along.
"The governor said on Sept. 30 Missouri purchased four saliva-based testing machines to be placed in four regions around the state.Kelli Jones, spokeswoman for the governor's office, said the state used CARES Act funding for the purchase.Documents from the governor's office said nearly $800,000 was spent on the machines from Fluidigm. The company worked with Washington University in St. Louis to develop the saliva-based tests.The documents included a little more than $200,000 was spent on warranties, installation, training services and support services.Machines will be placed in each of Missouri's southwest, southeast, central and Kansas City regions.It's unclear when the testing machines will go online and when the saliva tests will become available for the general public.Education / Governor of Missouri / Jefferson City Video / Missouri / News / Top Stories / University of Missouri / Video"
I have studied Yale's paper on its Saliva Direct method one more time. Its approach is indeed complementary with FLDM. Its samples collected have to be sent to labs for PCR analysis. FLDM sells PCR machines. Here is its paper: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.03.20167791v1.
"Regarding the Piper Sandler conference:""Fluidigm Corporation (Nasdaq:FLDM), an innovative biotechnology tools provider with a vision to improve life through comprehensive health insight, today announced that the company’s management will participate in the Piper Sandler 32nd Annual Virtual Healthcare Conference on Tuesday, December 1, and Wednesday, December 2.In advance of the virtual conference and investor meetings, a pre-recorded fireside chat with Chris Linthwaite, President and CEO, will be made available, Tuesday, November 24, at 10:00 am ET. During the fireside chat, the company will present updates regarding Fluidigm’s business strategy and financial performance.""Excellent. Fluidigm's CEO does great giving presentations but time limitations and/or limited questions may not allow him to tell the whole story. There's too much to say in short periods of time. He truly shines in fireside chat formats.This coming Tuesday at 10 AM ET."
"The market reaction to the FLDM’s good news was quite different from my expectation. One possibility was that they saw the significant discount to universities as a result of poor market penetration. They might expect a poor earning report. Based on my own rough estimate posted before, the earning can be increased from $13M loss (-$0.18 per share) in Q2 to $6M loss (-$0.08 per share) in Q3 due to what we know about FLDM Covid test activities in September (one month only). This $0.08 loss is well above $0.20 loss estimated by analysts. When I derived that number, I did not consider the four new machines to be delivered to Missouri and U Penn’s test initiative mentioned in the news release yesterday. I do not see the discount program as an indication of poor market penetration. I see this new program is to expand the market share quickly and effectively while supporting campus re-opening activities. It is a great program and FLDM’s durability is enhanced substantially with a larger market share in the PCR business."
"FLDM Q4 is expected to be much better than Q3. How about 2021? Is FLDM’s PCR revenue going to be affected by the Abbott’s at-home $25 test announced yesterday? Of course, there is an effect. However, this effect is expected to be similar to Abbott’s current $5 test. I believe FLDM PCR revenue in 2021 should be higher than 2020. Here is my analysis: 1) The respiratory and Covid test revenue in 2021 is expected to be 2X of that in 2020. The respiratory test evaluating Covid, Flu A&B is not covered by Abbott’s antigen test.2) All lab-based diagnostic tests are PCR tests. FLDM’s stock price dropped substantially after the announcement of Abbott’s $5 rapid test in August. However, FLDM sold 30 new PCR machines after that announcement. Labs offering 1000’s of tests per day are not affected by the labor-intensive antigen test.3) Abbott’s test is proven not effective. A visible example is the guests got infected in the White House activities after such antigen tests.4) Saliva-based PCR is the best option for the surveillance test offered to protect college campuses, international flights, cruises, sports events and other similar activities. Saliva samples are collected by individuals without a long line. 1000’s of tests can be conducted per day. Abbott’s $25 per test is too expensive and too labor-intensive. FLDM charges only $5 per test for college’s surveillance test. Other costs associated with machines and labors are very small since these costs are shared by 1000’s of tests conducted per day. FLDM’s PCR test is the best among different saliva-based testing approaches. You can gain more insight into a saliva-based Covid test at https://www.colorado.edu/covid-19-ready-dashboard."
"I'm a recent Fluidigm investor (and I'm very happy to say that) so perhaps others already know this but DARPA's website highlights its Covid programs...and who do you think is on the top of the page?""As part of DARPA’s ongoing web series highlighting the agency’s active programs focused on COVID-19 medical countermeasures, this week we are focusing on supported research in the area of disease diagnosis.DARPA has four current programs engaged in rapidly detecting COVID-19 exposure and/or infection in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals:Epigenetic CHaracterization and Observation (ECHO) - The Epigenetic CHaracterization and Observation (ECHO) program aims to build a point of service device that analyzes an individual’s epigenetic “fingerprint” to potentially reveal a detailed history of that individual’s exposure to pathogens, chemicals, or even weapons of mass destruction. DARPA envisions that the same technology could provide rapid diagnostics for individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19, providing a timely signal to apply effective medical countermeasures.ECHO performer Fluidigm recently announced that a consortium of medical schools led by the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is utilizing the Fluidigm Biomark HD microfluidics system and technology to create an epigenetic test for early detection of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. This technology has significant potential to increase the speed and capacity of screening efforts, as microfluidics technology generates more data and uses a fraction of expensive testing reagents per precious sample as compared with more traditional, microwell plate-based PCR technology.The consortium is developing a test using real-time PCR detection for host detection assays targeting epigenome and viral RNA for early-stage host monitoring of potentially infected individuals. Labs will be able to generate more than 6,000 test results per day, with a single system supporting more than 2 million annual tests.""During the earnings call (which is available via transcript) the CEO said they couldn't say too much about what Fluidigm was doing for DARPA. But it's nice to know that DARPA may update us about DARPA. :-)"
Any news on revenues from india and china partnerships? This thing is poised to break into double digits or back down to five dollars. Need some big news to push us to massive uptrend. Hopefully blow off top earnings report.
"Are these potential buyers? In comparing Fluidigm Corporation (FLDM)’s stock with other industry players reveals that stock’s current price change of 11.81% and that of 29.56% over the past 12 months is in competing position with that of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO) which saw its stock price fall by -0.38% in the last trading and went through an increase of 29.68% in past 12-month trading. Industry’s another major player Pacific Biosciences of California Inc. (PACB) has rise 5.00% up in previous session, but over the past year has faced a rise of 735.81%, while Illumina Inc. (ILMN) was also up 1.23% however its price remained floating in the green at 27.71% over the same period."
"There is a possibility that FLDM’s Q4 earnings can become positive for the first time. In Q3, FLDM generated a Covid revenue of about $12M with 0.795M tests ($6M assuming $7.5 per test) and 30 PCR machines ($6M assuming $200K per machine). In Q4, the manufacturing capacity was about 6M tests for a possible revenue ranging from $22.5 to $45M (3M to 6M tests and $7.5 per test). It should be noted that FLDM served 0.795M tests for the 2M manufacturing capacity with 12 PCR machines activated for Covid tests in Q3. The percentage should be much higher since 41 PCR machines were activated for Covid tests in Q4. For PCR machines, there is no reason the revenue would drop since the Covid test market in 2021 was expected to be 2X higher than that in 2020. Let’s assume a range of $3M to $6M. The total of Covid revenue would range from $25.5 to 51M. It would generate additional revenue of $13.5-39M compared with that ($12M) in Q3. The earning is about 50% of the revenue, so the Covid earning in Q4 would be $6.75-19.5M higher than that in Q3. The contribution of the Covid test to FLDM earnings would gain about $0.09-0.26 per share (for 74M shares). No reason other revenues would drop in Q4. The FLDM earning of Q3 was -0.08 per share. The FLDM’s earning in Q4 can be $0.01-0.18 (positive) per share! Look forward to the FLDM earnings report in 11 days."
basically broke even sold everything going strong into btc mara bitf etc
"I am never at a loss of amazement at the manipulation of the mms and controlling interests that can take a stock down to shake weak hands prior to the public announcement of positive news. This manipulation of asymmetrical info is why the rich will continue to become even richer playing the market. As for FLDM , see you at double digits shortly..."
"On Sunday, October 28, Fluidigm investors found an article in the Tennessean about Phase2 Labs creating a lab in which they planned on running 36,000 Fluidigm tests per day. Please recall that labs must pay Fluidigm somewhere between $12 and $17 per test if they're making use of Fluidigm's EUA-configured product.On that day, investors had to pay the Tennessean $5 for a three month introductory subscription in order to access that article. But it now appears on the Phase2 Labs website:https://www.phase2laboratories.com/news/coronavirus-testing-without-the-brain-ticklernbspswabs"
Fluidigm is up 8.61% to 6.94
"See CVS. Hiring 15,00 new employees to handle expected covid surge. With US govt buying product, how can this not go back to the $12.00 high, soon?"
"Ok. So I’ve been doing my homework on this and I really want to go long and be part of the recovery to us just being normal again.I get that being able to “shut down” people that have an early immune response before they can spread it is a great idea. I love it. Let’s get back to work people!That being said, I can’t figure out how a blood test that possibly have early detection of those infected before they have symptoms but also while before they can spread it to others works? Are we supposed to blood test every person on earth every day?, every week? And then if they test positive put them in a cage? How can we test 400 million Americans every week? What if, like some friends of mine who had it and were fine (like most people who had it) test positive for the mRNA response? Do they go in a cage too?"
"It really gets me angry to see the implication for the company when shorts gleefully attack this company.Let's highlight just Fluidigm's mass cytometry line:In December 2017, the Analytical Scientist counted down from 15 to 1 on what they considered to be the most innovative new inventions from 2017. Who do you think was #1? The Hyperion imaging equipment was deemed to be ""truly disruptive"":https://theanalyticalscientist.com/techniques-tools/intense-innovationSeptember 2019, was awarded 2019's Science and Technology Award for the cyTOF mass cytometry technology:https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/09/18/1917362/0/en/CyTOF-Inventors-Receive-Prestigious-Science-and-Technology-Award-from-the-Human-Proteome-Organization-HUPO.htmlDecember 2019 awarded the Life Science Industry award for the Maxpar:https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/12/09/1957896/0/en/Fluidigm-Receives-Life-Science-Industry-Award-for-the-Maxpar-Direct-Immune-Profiling-System.htmlA post from Sweden:http://cytof.scilifelab.se/As of last fall, this outstanding company, a worldwide technological leader, was shorted to such an extent that their R&D was no doubt constrained by their inability to access the capital markets in a meaningful way. So ironically it's Covid that allows them to now breathe."
This stock got Covid.
"Yes. Q4 didn't meet Wall Street's (the company's three analysts) and long investors' hopes. But those hopes involved thinking that a tiny market cap company would do many tens of millions of testing through their many testing clients.In that pursuit, Fluidigm did everything right. They sold those Biomarks, built up their manufacturing capacity for IFCs to the max courtesy of the NIH $34 million grant (of which they got another 14 or so million during Q4 which is NOT accounted for in revenues but is added to their cash on their balance sheet), and waited for their many clients to do enormous amounts of testing.But the commercial labs did not do enormous amounts of testing. Fluidigm got paid for ""only"" 1.2 million tests in Q4 which was a small fraction of overall revenues.Still, that represented a nice addition to their core multi-omics (genomics, proteomics, etc.) lab research equipment such that they achieved a total $44 million in revenues (again, not including the $14 plus million NIH payment). And that Covid testing, although lower levels than we would have thought, will continue to be a net add to quarterly revenues."
"It is a turbulent period. Let’s estimate a potential earning report, so we know what we should do. Feel free to correct my estimates on FLDM Covid testing activities in September.Washington Univ and Oklahoma Univ’s OMRF conducted tests for the entire September. ImmunoGenomics and Vero Diagnostics conducted tests for about 15 days. However, they bought two PCR machines with about $250K each. The State of Missouri bought 4 PCR machines with about $200K each. The minimum total Covid test revenue in September is $10 x 3000 x (30+30+15+15) = $2.7M for test and $1.3M for PCR machines. With the NIH’s grant of $12M (see news on Sept. 8), the additional total revenue resulting from the Covid test is $16M. The corresponding profit is about 50% of the revenue, so it is $8M. The revenue in Q3 should be higher than $42M (=26.06M + $16M). The $26.06M was the Q2 revenue of (see report on August 6). More importantly, the earning can be increased from $13M loss (-$0.18 per share) in Q2 to $5M loss (-$0.067 per share) in Q3 since additional expenses for the Covid test were covered by the NIH grant. This $0.067 loss is well above $0.20 loss estimated. This estimate is the minimum increase since I consider FLDM Covid test activities in September only. The reference using Q2 numbers is not accurate since Q2 was the worst quarter. Also, FLDM’s top product Cytof is very important to Covid related research activities. Anyway, with such a conservative estimate, I expect to see an impressive earning report on November 5."
seems like good news for the long run. more comprehensive testing is right up our alley
"FLDM is said saw their shares move by double-digit percentages in August, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Moreover, brace yourself as these companies could give you the latest Cobalt and EV batteries trends right away! Know how: http://psce.pw/HugeCobaltDemandTeslaPotential"
"It's time to start thinking seriously about Q3 income to try to estimate just how powerfully the FLDM stock price will increase after Q3 earnings come out.We know that Fluidigm earns money multiple ways and in multiple countries worldwide.First, and of particular importance to those who think that the most interesting aspect of this company is that it's a Covid stock, it sells its own Covid saliva tests. Vero Diagnostics in Research Triangle, NC: 3000 tests per day. Immunogenomics in Houston, TX: 3000 tests per day. But then there's the Motley Fool article that interviewed a Fluidigm officer who stated that those two were only ""representative"" of far more testing clients.And then there's the fact that Fluidigm is also intimately involved in other companies' or universities' testing. For example, Rutgers, which has its own saliva test, has its RUCDR labs and its website has a rotating set of pictures. In one, a bank of multiple Fluidigm Biomarks can be seen. The University of Oklahoma ""borrowed"" Fluidigm Biomarks from multiple Oklahoma sources to set up its own CLIA lab to process its own tests. The company issued a news release featuring a Spanish lab that was using Fluidigm Biomarks to process Covid nasopharyngeal tests. There's a company in Singapore called Mirxes that does 500,000 test per week (!!!) and August 17 Mirxes and Fluidigm tweets indicated that those two companies had entered into a sales and marketing partnership whereby Mirxes tests would be run on Biomarks andFluidigm and Mirxes would jointly go on sales calls with prospective clients, etc.Fluidigm earns money from those kinds of relationships not only from machine sales but also sales of ""consumables"" like reagents used in the processing.And then there's its relationship with Wash U in St. Louis, Missouri. The state of Missouri just PR'd the fact that it had just purchased four Biomarks from Fluidigm.NIH grant of $34 million to not only do manufacturing buildout but also to develop its barcoding system (ask me to explain if you don't know what that's about). Objective: to allow Fluidigm to do one million tests per day during Q1 2021. DARPA work in its ECO program to epigenetically detect the virus arising out of a program whereby exposure to chemical or biological weapons might be identified (again, if you need a link, just ask).In fact, it appears to me that Fluidigm may very well be among the top companies in the world doing battle with Covid.And then there's the research-oriented lab equipment sales in general, Covid-related and non-related. Every major piece of equipment Fluidigm sells has received recognition via a variety of prestigious awards. And the list of buyers includes everyone who's anyone in the world of scientific and medical research. If anyone asks for ten links for labs with Fluidigm's cyTOF mass cytometry equipment, no problem to find them in no time. Yale, Stanford, UMinnesota, UTexas Anderson Cancer Center, Dana-Faber Cancer Institute, UMaryland, and a long list of foreign entities. Governmental, university, and private labs.Again, more reagent sales. More lab equipment sales. More service contracts.Foreign, domestic. Covid-related and non-Covid related. Always characterized by excellence. Truly a firm that offers a unique value to investors as well as to its clients.Again, if you'd like to see links, please don't hesitate to ask."
"FLDM's microfluidic technology is not just for PCR. Its microfluidic chip is the leading solution to collect and analyze single cells. The market value of FLDM does not include the potential business in single-cell diagnostics. However, most of bio companies know FLDM's strength in microfluidic chip. Yes, it is a good approach to sell its microfluidic business unit to a major bio company. $1B is a reasonable price tag."
FLDM has the best saliva test somes labs says they have more accuracy that Swab test!!! I won't be suprise with a NFL/NBA deal.
"In preparation for this change, CDC recommends clinical laboratories and testing sites that have been using the CDC 2019-nCoV RT-PCR assay select and begin their transition to another FDA-authorized COVID-19 test. CDC encourages laboratories to consider adoption of a multiplexed method that can facilitate detection and differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses. Such assays can facilitate continued testing for both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 and can save both time and resources as we head into influenza season. Laboratories and testing sites should validate and verify their selected assay within their facility before beginning clinical testing."
"In a note to investors on Monday, Piper Sandler's Steven Mah wrote that ""given that ... HHS has traditionally provided nasal swab testing to surge testing sites (which still remain a choice for community officials), we consider this an encouraging in-road into wider adoption of Fluidigm's saliva-based test, which provides an easier sampling alternative, as it is less invasive and does not require swabs or special collection devices. We continue to believe COVID-19 testing is durable, and that the marketplace is large enough for multiple players."" Accordingly, Piper Sandler reiterated its Overweight rating on the stock with a $12 price target."
"Apparently, this has plunged to the depths because of the Abbot Labs test. I don't see that test being a threat to Fluidigm but, instead, enhancing Fluidigm's overall business opportunities. Why? See my analysis below.The Abbot Labs test is very exciting. Walk into a clinic, a nurse's office, a pharmacy, allow someone to stick a swab into your nose, and leave. Within fifteen minutes thereafter, you get the ""positive"" or ""negative"" result sent to your cell phone. You can the show that cell phone result to anyone who needs to see it: at the airport, at the courthouse, at the ballgame perhaps, maybe you can have the tests done in your junior high or high school. Anyplace where you might need the result RIGHT AWAY.But that's with relatively small population groups. If you want to monitor your entire 80,000 or so university community at the University of Alabama, for example, you need (1) a completely unintrusive saliva test and (2) processing onsite in your own labs or perhaps offsite to get your results tomorrow. You just want to identify positive results so you can do the appropriate quarantining, not necessarily try to do the impossible and all-of-a-sudden test for immediate results for that huge population.If it's an urban commuter school, on the other hand, perhaps those students can avail themselves of the countless pharmacies in their home neighborhoods to get that day's test. But you'd need the combined processing capability of countless pharmacies to pull that off. On campus living, large population universities, no way to do it and you don't really need to do it.So where does that leave Fluidigm? They were NEVER a candidate to provide immediate tests for air travel, courthouses, etc. They were always best suited to do large population overnight processing. Their test or Yale's test (perhaps run on Fluidigm's equipment?) is optimal for those types of tests. And the Abbot test is no competition for those huge, on campus (or any small geographic space) processing jobs.But remember last earnings call. The company had suffered in that many of their lab customers had either altogether shut down or partially shut down due to the virus. But now all of the labs' employees can go to their local pharmacies (or wherever) to get the Abbot test and confidently proceed to work after testing ""negative"". Expect those labs to be running full speed and Fluidigm meeting the backlogged demand for their technological marvel lab equipment. :)"
"FLDM machine can deliver 190 tests in 45 minutes. FLDM used to claim its Covid test could be completed in 2.5-3 hours. However, they also claim to deliver 6,000 tests per day per machine. It requires about 32 PCR runs (190 tests per run) to achieve 6,000 tests in 24 hours. As a result, FLDM can in fact complete 190 tests in 45 minutes. Now, I understand why FLDM CEO has not talked about 2.5-3 hours to complete a test anymore. He is using 30 minutes for a PCR run as a reference. For an airport check-in application, FLDM’s solution offers 190 tests in 45 minutes; it is much better than Abbott’s solution that requires 15-minutes for a single test run by a professional health care worker."
"Here is a case study for us to gain an insight into the Covid-19 test in a college campus. During the week of 9/14-18, CU-Boulder conducted 6,826 monitoring tests, i.e. surveillance tests, using PCR on saliva samples in its own labs. Students living in a residence hall are required to take the test (2 minutes for sampling) once per week. 537 students were referred to further PCR diagnostic tests. 1,670 students including these referred and others with symptoms or advised by contact tracing took the PCR diagnostic tests in a medical center. The number of positive results were 457 out of 1,670. CU-Boulder plans to offer more surveillance tests for off-campus students.What do we learn from this case? The surveillance test can be conducted by almost any organization with labs with substantially reduced costs. Such tests are not reported in the national statistics. Its number can be very large. For a college campus, the number can reach over 1,000 tests per day, and PCR is the best approach due to its throughput and low-cost. For a comparison, a health care worker can conduct only 32 Abbott point-of-care tests per day. Each student has to spend at least 15 minutes for an Abbott test instead of 2 minutes for saliva sampling for PCR.The PCR test with saliva samples developed by the CU-Boulder lab is not very accurate, and further testing is needed. For another campus with FLDM PCR machines installed, I am sure they will conduct the accurate, one-step surveillance test using the FLDM solution. There are about 400 such PCR machines already installed in the US. FLDM won the $37M NIH RADx grant for a good reason. You can study this case by yourself through this link: https://www.colorado.edu/covid-19-ready-dashboard."
"Broke through a pretty significant moving average this morning. The 60-day VMA @$6.75 was my indicator to move in - 15,000 shares this morning. The next move up to $7.90 and $9.20 should take place yet this month. Watch and see..."
"FLDM: $12/hour and Abbott: $17.5/hour. Here is my conservative estimate for the cost per test using FLDM’s PCR machine. The new machine costs around $250K, and labor cost assumed is $50/hour. So, the cost per test using a new FLDM machine with 3,000 tests per day for 5 months is: Machine: $250,000/(3000 x 30 x 5) = $0.6 per test; Labor: $50 x 24/3000 = $0.4 per test; and FLDM’s material is about $10 per test. Assume the funnel tube costs about $1 each. The cost per test is about $12 per test.For Abbott, one health care worker can handle maximum 32 tests per day. So, the labor cost is around $50 x 8/32 = $12.5 per test. Its material cost is $5, so the cost per Abbott test is about $17.5 per test.Keep in mind FLDM serves lab-based tests and Abbott serves point-of-care tests. These are two different test markets. Abbott is used as a reference for us to visualize the cost competitiveness of the FLDM test solution. The labor and facility costs for a test could go much higher, and FLDM’s cost advantage would become more impressive."
Quarterly loss of $0.09 per share in line with the Zacks Consensus EstimateThis is an extreme overeaction. It makes no sense.
"In 3000 @ 6.80. I feel like our earnings report will be interesting, if not a blowout. Estimates are already nearly 30 percent down from last quarter. We already saw some nice news in prior press releases. Several analysts rate FLDM as a strong buy/buy. Implied volatility as per options is around 30 percent!!! It has historically moved on average 15 percent. Similar companies reported strong surprises during this period. Pacific Biosciences of California is namely an example. Some other competitors reporting around this period include Illumina (today) and Agilent -- BOTH have estimates with a lower revenue decline. And we will need to see COVID news impact guidance and possibly even the earnings report today. Price targets are set near $10 by several analysts. We will also need to look out for an improvement in Asia-Pacific revenues, which declined 48 percent Y/Y last quarter, and an improvement in cash on hand.People appear to anticipate bad news, but we will need to see. I see now as an incredible buying opportunity. Today's report could be a massive turnaround for FLDM during the pandemic. It's crucial, explaining the options activity. Please comment your ideas below!!!"
"2M tests per month by the end of December was the number reported in a long article on saliva tests. With 43 PCR machines enabled for Covid tests now, it is clear that this number is reachable. Assume 1M in October, 1.5M in November and 2M in December, we expect to have 4.5M tests in Q4. For academic users, FLDM charges $5 for a test. For industrial users, FLDM charges $7 to $20 per test. To be conservative, assume $7.5 per test. FLDM will generate a $33M revenue for only reagents for Covid test in Q4."
Yep... FLDM superior test according to Grogan on CNBC 20 minutes ago
"I took a trip down memory lane (scrolling down to 4 months ago on this Yahoo! Finance page) to check out analyst opinions about Fluidigm last July. This July 9 Tip Ranks posting about the company was pre-Covid test and just focused on the company's cutting edge lab equipment:Fluidigm Corporation (FLDM)With a market cap of $401.6 million, Fluidigm provides multi-omic solutions developed using its patented CyTOF and microfluidics technologies to study cancer, inflammatory diseases and immunotherapies. Currently going for $5.68 apiece, BTIG believes the stock is cheap relative to its potential value.Representing the firm, 5-star analyst Sung Ji Nam breaks down FLDM’s offerings into two distinct categories. These include “the legacy microfluidics business (~40% of revenue) that has been shrinking over the last several years and the mass cytometry business (~60% of revenue) which is differentially positioned in one of the fastest growing areas within life sciences research.”Nam added, “We continue to view FLDM's mass cytometry business as highly differentiated and with strong LT growth potential beyond the COVID pandemic, and are also encouraged by the recent InstruNor acquisition and TIS launch, which should strengthen the technology adoption longer-term.”That being said, the analyst cites the former as being a key component of his bullish thesis. “Looking ahead, we are more optimistic about FLDM's microfluidics business, given the recent progress with finding broader and durable applications for the technology platform including the potential significant opportunities in COVID-19 diagnostics and other infectious disease applications in the future,” he explained.Speaking to its efforts to combat COVID-19, FLDM is working to launch two highly differentiated approaches for COVID-19 diagnostics, in addition to its immune system profiling/monitoring capabilities that enable vaccine and therapeutic developments. It boasts a viral nucleic acid testing capability “that could process 6,000 tests per day (2mm a year) using one Biomark/ June combination using 1,000x less reagents vs. RT-PCR platforms currently being used for COVID testing.” The other is an epigenetic test using FLDM's microfluidics platform that’s being developed as part of a collaboration with Mount Sinai and the DoD, with it potentially able to detect a COVID infection earlier than conventional PCR platforms.Everything that the company has going for it keeps Nam on the bulls’ side. To this end, the analyst rates FLDM a Buy alongside a $12 price target. This figure suggests shares could climb 111% higher in the next year. (To watch Nam’s track record, click here) FLDM has kept a relatively low profile so far, with its Moderate Buy consensus rating breaking down into 2 Buys and no Holds or Sells. At $10.50, the average price target indicates 85% upside potential.""So, yes, the analyst (who's a ""she"", by the way, and not a ""he"") mentioned this company's lab equipment as having a role to play in the Covid battle, but said nothing about an as yet highly uncertain Covid test. And still expected the share price to increase from $5.68 at the time to $12.That's the scientific equipment side of the business. And now we know not only about an approved EUA but also huge sales of Covid tests to the state of Missouri and to Vero Diagnostics.I'd say we're due."
"Fldm incorporated more than 10yrs ago for their machines and IFCs for many illness. The shares at Feb 2015 before Trump and Covid was $42+. With Covid they had new found opportunity, and will shoot up revenue. Found reliable info from a source. Fldm is expanding by adding 2 more production lines to current 1 line. By Q1 end to Q2 then it can run full 3 lines production. However current Revenue will be better than every previous Qtr.Their production management team had requested all raw materials suppliers to support their new forecasts.Shorts still have a small but risky window to play. Next Q4,1-2 Qtrs can't see big jump in revenues.They sold lots of equipment last 2 qtrs, but revenues constrainted by consumables Production. These consumables are important revenues churning qtrly.Good sign for mid to long term investment, and a target for M&A as they have patented their eqpt and technology."
Heading wrong direction pre-market 
"Ironically, this stock was way up pre-market even before there was any PR announcement. This enormously favorable news apparently got the shorts to en masse go on the attack in order to survive for at least another day.But earnings are coming very soon. :)"
"The stars of aligning!When grilled at his last CC, the ceo said they were focused on submission. When we submit, as we are working lock step with the fda and darpa, we will have fast approval.When asked about production, the ceo made it clear, “we will tackle that when we get there. Right now our focus is on perfecting the test.”Submission happens, now antibody supply locked down.I’m telling you, $14+ by mid August.I’m excited"
"I keep reading these ""it takes 3 to 5 days"" comments. No. The test can be done in less than 3 hours. But it's up to the lab that runs it.My link posting doesn't seem to work so go to Fluidigm's website, go to ""investors"", look for its Investor Presentation, and go to page 15. Run time less than 3 hours.And it's not a ""one at a time"" type test. But one where the lab runs thousands per day. Like at a surge testing center. Or at Truman Medical Center in Kansas City (60,000 emergency room visits per year) that announced it was adopting Fluidigm's test last Thrsday."
"I hope you guys realize that FLDM could pop +300% in price on Monday in a buying frenzy. All the wind is blowing in their direction; increased infection rate, 2/3rds faster result speeds vs ABT, great accuracy, and competitive in price per test. Just WOW...... I'm so glad I'm in at $6.00."
"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/sars-cov-2-reference-panel-comparative-data Tagging on to the dialogue posted earlier today, does anyone, preferably someone with expertise in interpreting the data, have some additional observations regarding Fluidigm's LoD result of 54000?"
"The truth is:1.most people are traders in bio med, not investors which means very little patience and high volatility 2. covid is still a big deal, Just on the back burner for most folks right now. It is surging in many parts of the world and, unfortunately, we will all feel the second wave3. Testing will be needed in all state, federal, military, academic, and private industries. Hundreds of millions of tests each week4. Fldm has direct connection with our military and darpa finding is coming. We learned 16 days ago that they had not yet applied for eua because they want to make sure when submitted “it’s a go”I believe this submission is coming in the next 14 days, likely next week. I got out at 4.7 after hearing that news. Now I’m back. If you can afford it, this is an amazing entry point! I don’t know what the lowIs but I know what willHappen upon the news that is coming.Look over the notes or listen to the CC from 16 Days ago and you to will be very comfy hopping in at this price point."
"The spike will be fueled by the B.1.1.7 variant, first spotted in the United Kingdom, and will come over the next six to 14 weeks, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.""Four weeks ago, the B.1.1.7 variant made up about 1 to 4% of the virus that we were seeing in communities across the country. Today, it's up to 30 to 40%,"" Osterholm told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""What we've seen in Europe, when we hit that 50% mark, you see cases surge,"" he said."
"Looking forward to when Fluidigim's earnings call which will clear up a lot of doubts about the company. They've been relatively silent until today. I see big revenue numbers being reported and hopefully strong forward guidance for 2021. Stock is totally oversold, should be a least $10 right now and $20 if earnings are good, maybe $30. Most manipulated stock on the market."
"Great news about Fluidigm’s partnership with MiRXES. I have learned more about MiRXES. By April, MiRXES was producing 100,000 Covid-19 test kits each week. In one month, they had managed to ramp up production capacity to 500,000 tests a week. I am sure their current production rate is much higher. This partner can work with Fluidigm to reach 100,000 tests/day quickly and 1M tests/day in a few months. You can learn more about this important partner from https://vulcanpost.com/701141/mirxes-covid-19-test-kit-manufacturer-singapore/."
If they sell company they can get easily $15 to $20 per share.
"I just realized after re-reading the post I just posted that I did not include the ""volume"" response to the analyst who was asking about the Covid 19 EUA testing product. The CEO answered the pricing question and allowed his CFO to answer the volume question, as follows:""There's a big shortage of tests right now in the United States. There is a supply chain issue with many of the tests that are currently being offered in the market because of the solution that we are presenting that is based on saliva. So therefore, it does not include swabs, and also it does not depend on RNA extraction reagents. So we believe our solution offers a very attractive alternative value proposition here that solves some of the supply chain issues and also we believe could increase testing compliance on the part of the patients because saliva is such a -- much easier sample to give compared to nasopharyngeal swabs.So in summary, I would say, we perceive a large market opportunity and a large revenue potential in the second half of this year. The timing is based on a variety of factors, including the timing of the authorization of the various EUAs from the FDA as well as the product development that we have alluded to from the point of view of starting with a singleplex product, then moving on to multiplex and then moving on further to panels...."""
"If you hit ""holders"" on this Fluidigm Yahoo Finance page, you'll see that Fluidigm is 95% institution-owned. While most are buy and hold long term investors, some are hedge funds. And hedge funds may have a substantial long term hold position, but may also have a short term trading component for any particular company.Hedge funds are interesting entities, in that they're all about ""painting pictures"" to affect the share price short term. Listen to the below link and hear Jim Cramer talk about his hedge fund trading, and how they both bought and sold in an effort to paint pictures to provoke a psychological reaction, as well as outright fabricated information disseminated to others. As he put it, eventually ""the market"" will know what's true and what's not, but short term one can make a lot of money.Creating panic and causing a cascade of stop losses are of course part and parcel of a short trade.So if you've done your DD, and you further know that only a small percentage of this company's overall outstanding shares trade, do you really care what any particular day's intraday or closing price will be? Right now, Jim Cramer hedge fund tactics are feasting upon the new retail investors who bought solely on having heard about the granting of the EUA. They're easy to panic. But, as Cramer himself suggested, you can keep the con going for a while but reality will eventually intrude. Again, eventually ""the market"" will know what's true and what's not.At some point, those newbies will regrettably be gone and it will be a bit more difficult to manipulate remaining knowledgeable investors."
"Down 10% on no news, looks like fund manager just dumped 480K shares , guess had enough with FLDM."
"As stated previously, the connected and priviledged know that the US Government was working on evaluation and distribution of FLDM products. It amazes me how mms took weaks holders out from the whole week. Your only clue was the low volume and no major blocks being sold. Classic game and sad for our markets when I see how effectively they can draw down share prices. On the flip side, there are now sucker shorts, of which I would not want to be. Biomarks and reagents are going to be produced max capacity for this effort. If given the choice, I as a doctor, will not want my nasal cavity violated any more than necessary. If Biden wins, testing will only accelerate and peds, schools, offices, etc will select the saliva test and for it to really matter, it will have to be PCR. At this point, investor confidence is more assured. As for share price, double digits is coming very shortly with significant earnings and upgrades. The only thing I would keep my eye on is QDEL for a competitive picture and the high possibility that this would make a wonderful acquisition for a company like DHR or TMO."
"The Q4 poor earnings report was a surprise. It is clear that FLDM knows how to sell machines. The Covid market is to be over soon. Is there any potential for an explosive market for its PCR machines? Should they consider the market that installs one PCR machine in each cruise? In addition to cruise, I expect to see several other applications associated with the world wide infrastructure on diagnostics. FLDM's new desktop PCR machines and bar-coding technology should keep its leadership in the machine development. There is no reason for a PCR machine to deliver results after hours of operation. It is possible to reduce the cycle time to one hour. Such a new market opportunity is what I hope to get out of CEO's talk on February 18. It is clear that he failed to support his customers to penetrate into the Covid test market. Hope he knows how to sell FLDM machines to support the new diagnostic infrastructure being established."
"Based on the analyst discussion yesterday, sometime within the next month this company will be coming to the market with two significantly differentiated Covid diagnostics, one of which is truly a ""game changer"".The first is a saliva test for Covid that will offer the same specificity and sensitivity as current PCR swab tests, which are much less convenient to run.The second is the DARPA/Mt Sinai Echo collaboration test that will be able to determine Covid exposure prior to symptom onset. Truly a game changer.To market for both, relative to the company's current business, will be significant. Assuming they can ramp up production fast enough, the second half of the year is going to be huge."
"Anyone reading this who has missed the boat for CODX , now you have a chance to get on the next train of FLDM. No company is large enough for all the required testing and this testing is ongoing for some professionals like healthcare professionals needs to be tested 2 times a week in New York and will be the same in other states, BUY , BUY and hold"
"With its ease to conduct tests (use of saliva), more accuracy, quick process time and huge daily volume of 6000 over the usual 2000, its FDA approval is to be expected. Additionally its technology and equipments are used for the research conducted by a group of leading hospitals including Harvard, Yale, Stanford to UC San Francisco. This speaks to the credibility of its product and processes. It is so under-priced. Once discovered with news out, double digits share price is expected."
"FLDM: 2M tests per month by the end of December. This number is reported in a long article: How one university built a COVID-19 screening system, Campus testing at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign holds important lessons about the strengths and limitations of routine testing regimen. I cannot post the link. You can find it through Google."
"My argument for FLDM to be trading at $40. Of all the seven mentioned biotech comapanies, I will pick on Mesa and Quidel. MLAB is trading at $236 but the revenues are similar to FLDM even float is 10 times less. Based on that general info 236/10 = $23 for FLDM comparing banana vs banana. Quidel earnings are 4 times more than Fluidigm's, but the float is the same. QDEL is trading at $280. Thus 282/5 = $56. Take the sum of both QDEL and MLAB and divide by 2. Thus (23+56)/2 = $39.50"
This stock will be range bound 5 to 7.50 for at least one year.Unless you are hoping in long term like 3 to 5 years will be in $20’s or higher. Better places to make $$$. Just my opinion. I’m out after march 5th from this stock (long term capital gains) . Good luck
"At about 6:15 AM, someone named 'helioft"" posted on Stocktwits a screenshot of the following message:From ""Maggie A. Pax, Vice President, Strategy and Innovation at Thermo Fisher ScientificCongrats Chris Linthwaite and Colin McCracken. Great to add saliva-based testing to the fight to control COVID.""Don't think that the heavyweights (like $166.4 billion market cap Thermo Fisher Scientific) aren't completely impressed with what tiny $599.1 million market cap Fluidigm is able to do."
"Andreas, a question for you.What do you make of the announcement that Roche is buying GenMark for a > 40% premium to its price immediately before rumors spread in February, and a 29% price jump today? Additionally, why is Luminex the subject of buyout rumors and Fluidigm is not? Any further thoughts on this? I confess that I am stumped."
10x Genomics would be the PERFECT buyer for Fluidigm
With or without a sale this company's core business is growing.
"Looks like 20,000 tests per day. Not bad for starters. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.auroraadvertiser.net/news/20200829/williams-missouri-goal-is-for-covid-19-saliva-test-by-end-of-september%3ftemplate=ampart"
What’s with the after hours price tonight???
"CNBC just interviewed Joe Grogan, former White House task force member. He was commenting on the recent covid outbreak at the WH and said they should ditch the Abbott test, as it is now outdated and there are better tests on the market, and then he mentioned Fluidigm by name as one of the superior tests they should consider going to!"
Anyone shorting this thing is out of their mind

"The important intermediate info on this stock is guidance for Q4. Q3 did not have enough time with new products/partners to have a big eps effect. Analysis still shows average of loss for Q4 and FY2021. With strong prognosis, these will both go positive, hopefully to a significant degree. Saliva is key driver."
"Few days back I sold most of my position and bought TNXP at .67 and sold it at $2.18 , and I left a 1000 shares position just in case approval comes in , I know most of you get offended when I question the communication from the company but it's ok , some stocks are to hold for long long term"
"I am looking to get in here, but I see almost no revenue growth for the last 4 years. What's the theory justifying going long here? Thanks"
"Here's my post from two days ago regarding newly discovered Neogenomics:---------------------------------""Wednesday's iGLS webinar flashed a short list of a few highlighted firms that are running Covid tests on Fluidigm equipment (either Fluidigm's EUA-approved test or a lab developed test).One of the firms that I hadn't heard about before was Neogenomics. Locations across the US as well as multiple international locations. Multibillion dollar PUBLIC company traded on the stock market (stock symbol GEO).Here's an interesting section from NEO's Q3 10-Q:""NeoGenomics reported record revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in Quarter Three as we rebounded strongly from a very challenging second quarter.Revenue grew 44% sequentially, and 20% year-over-year, to $125 million...........COVID-19 PCR testing revenue added 16% to revenue growth during the quarter as we worked around the clock to develop and provide high-quality COVID testing to help with the shortage of U.S. capacity in July and August.""To summarize, 16% revenue growth due to Covid testing to help attain record revenues of $125 million. And they just started getting going during Q3. But they'll be firing on all cylinders during Q4. :)In fact, just think that Fluidigm got its Emergency Use Authorization approval for its Covid test on August 25. That left only about a month during Q3 for all of the Fluidigm-affiliated labs to ""sell"" Fluidigm's test.But those ""Q3"" Fluidigm-affiliated labs be firing on all cylinders for ALL of Q4. So I think we can reasonably assume that Fluidigm's Q4's revenues will be a multiple of its Q3.""-------------------------Then, Paul responded with:---------------------------Yes, there are 30 new PCR machines delivered and additional 13 old PCR machines for Covid test. The total capacity is 258,000 tests per day. Amazing!--------------------------43 Biomarks times 6000 tests per Biomark per day does indeed equal 258,000 tests per day.Remember also that the company charges $7 to $12 per saliva sample/per test for a client that is utilizing a test assay other than Fluidigm's EUA assay.However, if they're using Fluidigm's EUA assay, they pay $12 to $17 per test.I'll use the $12 intersection of both methodologies as an estimate of the weighted average from all clients.And I won't use 258,000 tests but cut that in half to ""only"" 129,000 tests per day. Truly, I don't think they'd buy the Biomark and have it run at half capacity all day, but that's my analytical assumption anyway.129,000 tests per day times a weighted average of $12 per test times a quarter's 90 days equals $139,320,000.It seems outrageously high but look at my assumptions and it's easy to see that estimate, just for Covid testing and just for Covid testing involving just today's existing clients, may be very much on the low side."
It's mandatory for healthcare employees to get tested on weekly basis which test you rather use one with early detection from FLDM or the other test with no early detection. I think answer clearly favors 6he FLDM early test
C'mon Linthwaite tell me something good today!
Assuming health care conference didn’t go so good.
Fluidigm (FLDM) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.09 per share in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This compares to loss of $0.38 per share a year ago. A 60% shave in share price... really?
You know. This website is going a bit too far in preventing users from posting links. I just tried to post a link to Yahoo! Finance's own post about Dante Labs. And it got rejected. Just like all the others I attempted earlier.So go to summary and scroll down and find today's Dante Labs article.
"Surveillance tests are critical to support back-to-normal activities. In fact, 1000’s of Covid tests are being conducted in almost every college campus. The saliva test is the most effective approach to serve such a community since every student would take only 2 minutes to collect his/her own sample, and they do not have to wait in line. With 43 PCR machines enabled for Covid tests, FLDM’s campus program will make a visible impact soon. More importantly, the saliva-based surveillance tests can be conducted to support many other activities: air travel, church services, restaurants and other in-door activities. The capacity of 43 PCR machines is about 250,000 tests per day, which can become 1M tests per day when the bar-coding and other sample mixing approaches are introduced. The number of PCR machines enabled for Covid tests can reach 100 in Q4. FLDM is given an opportunity to support the society while making money until summer 2021. After Covid-19, such an infrastructure will be critical to single cell diagnostics for genome-specific health care. The PCR market was predicted to reach $4.9B by 2026 in a report issued in 2019. I am sure this market size will increase by at least 2X to reach $10B/year resulting from the cost reduction accomplished by the Covid testing infrastructure."
"Just be aware that Fluidigm not only has a superior Covid test, but also sells its matchless processing equipment to many others who have their own tests (saliva tests, nasopharygeal tests, whatever). Check out this webpage from Rutgers University, which has its own saliva test. The upper right corner has a set of rotating pictures that pop up, disappear, and is then replaced by another (you may have to wait a few seconds for the rotation to start). One of those pictures has a bank of processing technology with a familiar name on it:https://www.rucdr.org/"
"Shorters. Like I said before, max you can gain from shorting is $5.++/shares. Now you have to cover back at $10/share soon. We will join you guys to short at $60/share."
FDA approval of home testing kit....a bit of good news for us longs! :)
"Just a Human wrote, ""The best sign of hope is that Andreas has stopped pumping ( Lost faith in leadership )""Once again, you're dead wrong as you're wrong about everything involving this company. I have sold all of the shares of every company in my well diversified portfolio during the past week or so (finally getting done yesterday) with the exception of my Fluidigm holdings. So I'm now all cash plus Fluidigm.And I've been significantly increasing my Fluidgm ownership today. If I have you to thnak for these low prices, thank you, you predatory piece of .The nice thing about earnings is not only that the company will demonstrate how much business they've been generating, but also that ""the market"" will be able to clearly see finally who Covid heavyweight superstars are and who the pretenders are. Fluidigm is in the latter category in case you couldn't figure out what I envision.The CEO has been doing great. It's a shame that the company's employees have shipped such high quality product to the most prestigious labs worldwide but have the shorts destroying their share's value.But that will soon come to an end."
"FLDM will receive a major announcement this week when it gets approval from FDA to market its saliva test. See former FDA commissioner Gotleibs comments in my post below. Stock with triple by end of week. Load up now, before the news hits."

Will the deal happen this weekend ? Anyone knows anything about the sale and who is the bidder ?
"If this thing not $8 range after earnings, nothing will move this stock, I will cash my chips & move on."
"Nice to see them making mention of Phase2 Labs in today's press release. Anyone that visits the Phase2 website will find the October 25 Tennessean article and see that Phase2 Labs will be ramping up to 36,000 tests per day. Just that one lab will do more daily tests than the BTIG analyst assumed for ALL of the twenty or so KNOWN Fluidigm testing clients (she assumed for her newest analysis 28,889 tests per day or 2,600,000 TOTAL per quarter).Will they soon reveal NeoGenomics, multi-billion public firm with labs in numerous US cities and one in Rolle, Switzerland and one in Singapore? NeoGenomics validated their equipment during July and August so they were operational in September and for sure fully operational for ALL of Q4."

Surprising a company can miss estimates by $1mm and get $175mm shaved off their market cap- guidance wasn’t that bad either. Not enough to justify this kind of reaction
"CEO of FLDM just gave an excellent presentation at the Stifel Virtual Healthcare Conference. He gave a clear guidance: 6M tests in Q4 and much more tests in 1H2021. With a consideration of vaccines, the Covid test market is still expected to be 2X higher in 2021. I do not know why he did not give such a guidance during the earning report. I guess he did not want to get more lawsuits."
It kind of looks like COVID is sticking around into winter. Stock sure seems like it can head higher any day now. so few sellers
Next earnings release will be huge just as street realizes that government spending going to more testing and vaccine roll out.....clear Covid will be morphing so need to track which strains in circulation will be with us for years......$jnj should buy $fldm and be leader in both vaccine and diagnostics! Crazy low market cap given the foundational nature of this DNA and Virus mapping tech.
"FLDM is expected to have an excellent Q4 earnings report that will beat the estimate easily. Hope it will report a positive earnings number for the first time. The key question we have to guess is what the reasonable price per share is? The 1 yr target estimate is about $13, which has been increasing recently. In one of the conference presentations, the CEO of FLDM projected the respiratory and Covid-19 molecular diagnostic market opportunities in the US and Europe as: $9-13B in 2020, $23-27B in 2021, and $10-14B in 2022. The recent virus mutants are more contagious, so it seems that Covid will not go away quickly. In fact, as predicted by scientists, the virus mutants are expected to come back next year. The market opportunities projected by the CEO seem to be reasonable. The analysts are aware of these market opportunities mentioned in one of CEO’s presentations. As a result, I believe their estimates based on FLDM’s current capabilities are reasonable. However, I do expect to see exciting innovations. FLDM is expected to deliver a desk-top PCR machine this year; such a portable machine can be used in cruises, airports, campuses for surveillance tests. In addition, FLDM is expected to deliver another bar-coding technology that will increase the throughput from 6,000 to over 25,000 tests per day for each PCR machine. With these two innovations, I expect FLDM to become a leading member in the national anti-virus infrastructure to be established by the government. Such an infrastructure was mentioned in another CEO’s conference presentation. With such innovations, FLDM’s 1 yr target estimate should be well over $13."
"Just keep one little FACT in mind before buying or selling , $75 billion are in the stimulus for testing and tracing , FLDM is in top 10 names of the govt. list and even 2% of that money will be around $150 millions and that will be a game changer for FLDM"
company is contemplating a sale
"The question for all the covid testing stocks has always been ""What's next?"". The mink variant outbreak in London has just answered that question. Sunday morning experts have expressed questions as to whether current vaccines will immunize against the new strain while acknowledging that is appears to be even more contagious. As a result, high testing levels will extend into 2022 in all likelihood. Cash flows and high earnings will continue for at least another 18 months. In this environment, FLDM could well triple to $20.00."
"I got on this board early this morning and spent all manner of time trying to post. But no matter how hard I tried to link to even one source, I couldn't do it.Yahoo! Finance is not what it once was.Suffice to say that Fluidigm is firing on all conceivable cylinders this Q4...and we'll only have to wait a short period of time to see it.I'd rather link to stuff than just make ""zero evidence"" claims like others always seem to do but it's just not possible most times."
"It seems to me that we have to figure out FLDM financials by ourselves. Here is my estimate. We know at least four Covid test service providers using FLDM PCR machines. Washington Univ and Oklahoma Univ’s OMRF represent the academic labs to provide community testing capability. With an Advisory Team formed to establish these labs, I expect to see at least additional 4 service labs out of 400 labs with FLDM PCR machines already installed. We may have at least 6 academic labs. ImmunoGenomics and Vero Diagnostics represent private CLIA labs. Similar to the academic labs, it is realistic to expect at least 6 such CLIA labs. It is a conservative estimate considering a reference case: RUCDR’s project in Minnesota is to provide 30,000 tests per day by October. RUCDR posts the FLDM PCR as one of its web site’s five banner images.Each lab is conducting about 3,000 tests per day today. Assume it is the throughput of each lab, we will have $10 per test x 3,000 per lab x 12 (labs) x 30 days = $10M per month.Can each lab increase the throughput to 6000 tests per day? Using Wash U and OMRF as examples, they are serving their entire states. For the surveillance test, a good reference is to provide at least 1,000 tests per day for each College campus. Therefore, each test service lab is expected to reach the maximum capacity quickly. Therefore, the FLDM revenue in the Covid test can reach $20M per month.Durability? According to Redfield, even with the vaccine, the pandemic will not be over until spring or summer. There will be a national infrastructure to protect us from future pandemic. FLDM’s Cytof is in fact its top product. Considering all of these factors, I would take the average of $15M per month for $180M per year as the durable revenue resulting from this Covid pandemic. With the revenue of $120M before the pandemic, the total revenue can reach $300M per year."
"Every 17, 18, or 19 year old college freshman taking Finance 101 knows how to compute a present value of future cash flows. You take a look at the future cash flow stream and ""present value"" each component of future cash flows to arrive at a present value.Hence, a cash flow stream of 10,10,10,1,1,1, will have a higher present value than a cash flow stream of 1,1,1,10,10,10 because the earlier cash flows will have more present value ""power"" than later cash flows, even though each cash flow stream totals 33.That's basically the theory of stock market valuation. You estimate the future cash flows and present value them back at a market rate of interest and...voila...you identify the value of the company, otherwise known as ""market cap"" or ""enterprise value"". But it's obviously not so easy to determine the future but that's your job as an analyst.That being said, Covid plays are particularly difficult because you don't know, as the CEO said during his foreside chat, what the ""duration"" of Covid may be. But recognize that it's particularly critical for companies that have no core business aside from Covid.For example, CODX's Q2 revenues were only 67 thousand (not a mistype). Even if their Q2, Q3, and Q4 revenues might be 100 million, what might an analytical valuation of the company be if that's it. It will essentially be zero thereafter (unless they've fundamentally changed their core non-Covid business since last year).That's why FLDM is such a screaming buy. They did 40 million Q3. I think they'll do 150 million Q4 (I really do). And then even if it fades to 100 Q1, 50 Q2, etc...their core mass cytomtry and microfluidics line takes over and brings THAT to ever greater heights.Present value those cash flows.That's why it's far more clear to see"
"to the terms of the definitive contract, the funding for the project was increased by approximately $22.0 million, for a total contract value of up to approximately $34.0 million upon the achievement of milestones"
AH trades + .20 with 637K volume $3.90We could easily open in the 4’s tmrw morning and I believe we’ve started a big run to the upside. Folks this is going nowhere but up ... we will touch highs reached during the pandemic run-up even BEFORE the SARS CoV2 saliva diagnostic test receives EUA approval from the FDA between now and at the latest mid July. The second wave ... is it upon us ? Who knows but the numbers are going in the wrong direction and more trouble is around the corner. Expect a second effort by govt agencies to get this under control. Testing needs to ramp up with a quicker more accurate test. THIS IS THAT. Read some posts to see the advantages of the test that is a GAME CHANGER
Wow. Almost $40 million in revenues. Huge increase from Q2. POSITIVE CASH FLOW!!!! Non-GAAP net income! Superb. And that's just scratching the surface of what Q4 will be.
"I have wondered why the stock is trading in single digits given what is going to happen over the next few months. I think people are seeing headlines about the SalivaDirect offering from Yale, or the complete hype coming out of SRNE, and thinking that diminishes the future potential for FLDM. But they don't. The SalivaDirect method offers a way for labs to cobble together an inexpensive Covid test that they could use if they want to. There will always be labs interested in doing that for many reasons. Where FLDM is differentiating themselves is by offering a kitted solution to labs that want to massively scale-up their testing capacity. The barcoding solution they have referred to will really enable significant increases in throughput. This massive capacity is desired by the government (RADx) to support population-wide screening efforts. The kind of testing that will support things like school/university openings, etc. The EUA is coming soon, after which FLDM will be in a position to provide more color on how this is going to roll out. Until that time, they aren't going to hype this like SNRE. They are much more reputable than that. Creates an amazing opportunity for those who still want to get in."
Jerry just read on SA that they are exploring a sale ! Article discussed 14% short interest & activist owning 11% of stock pushing for sale! Any thoughts on a potential sale price?
"FLDM, Must have a position in the stock before closing today , 95% owned by institutional owned 2% insider only 3% float available to the public and big player in Covid testing EUA approval imminent for saliva test before JULY 15th"
"Simple calculations. Total shares outstanding 71.23M, and institutions +insiders held about 97%. Only 3% or 2.14M shares are free market.Shorts can sell now happily, but once FLDM good news are out, they will scramble to cover back. So u want to play short or long... Accumulated few Ks at average of price of $7+/shares. Will sell to shorts at $13-15/shares. It should yield better than keeping in banks."
I am reading that in Europe airports are making obligatory the CV_19 test before boarding to provide 4 hours later to the arrival airport the results...........................and our FLDM in 2 hours can make it feasible to have results BEFORE boarding..................HUGE MARKET potential...!!!!
"Directly from FLDM website:The FDA recently approved 5-minute testing for COVID-19 detection from Abbott. How do these systems compare? One of the big advantages of microfluidics technology is the capacity of throughput. The IFC structure can process up to 192 samples at once. Combined with a 2-hour run-time, it is can analyze thousands of samples in a day. In contrast to the Abbott point-of-care test, the microfluidics workflows are high-throughput and high-capacity. A direct comparison of the two platforms demonstrates that in a 4-hour span, the Biomark HD system can test 192 samples where a point-of-care test, such as the Abbott system, can process 48 samples."
Good to go against the trend. All major indexes are down. FLDM when up 21cents.
At under 600 million market cap with a product in demand the chances of being bought are excellent. The company crushed earnings and the high short interest can be the making of a nice run up.
I've personally never seen anything like this. A high growth company that has a patent portfolio of 670 patents whose Q3 revenues are about to explode is selling with a price/annualized Q3 revenues ratio of a little over 2. When direct medical and diagnostic competitors like Thermo Fisher Scientific are over 7 and Nano-String is over 13. And they don't have the Covid portfolio! It's hard to believe.($500 million market cap) divided by (likely Q3 revenues of $50 million times 4) equals 2.5
"Let’s sum up the failures:1. Reduced NIH contract touted as an “increase”,2. CEO stating at CC they had secured non-dilutive funding in 2019, yet failing to mention the non-dilutive funding was at $2.80. What an insult to investor intelligence.3. FLDM PR over 6 months ago about partners intending to file FDA EUA for DARPA test, yet no EUA has yet been filed. When asked at CC the CEO diverted the question to the website of the partners for updates, yet I saw no updates on the website.4. The long delayed FDA EUA for the COVID assay took way too long, even after being given Govt priority by NIH. The FDA appeared to have requested additional validation, indicating the initial filing was inadequate.5. FLDM refused to provide guidance at CC and said they will update in time. It is the last day of the quarter and no guidance.The only positive action I see from mgmt was securing the initial contract from NIH. They could have blown that but they didn’t. The bottom line is the lack of timely actions has allowed our competitors to get in front of us. Many got FDA EUA approval before we even filed. I think FLDM management failed to recognize and execute timely actions to maximize the value of the technologies the company holds.Yes our revenues will increase significantly but if they had gotten things done timely, the outlook could have been much better.The CEO has not earned his compensation and a management change is needed."
"overreaction IMHO. Any vaccine doesn't eliminate the need for testing, right? I think ee's were good, rev's up and the run rate should get better. IMHO the pfe sample size was very small.....but it's still good news for sure. Guess pfe has a hard-on for the donald....they waited to release this after election so he couldn't claim success on their backs! LOL"
"I expect a solid CEO report tomorrow (Wednesday). I also expect to see a tweet about FLDM and RUCDR soon. Keep in mind that RUCDR is establishing a new saliva lab will be capable of processing as many as 30,000 samples a day in Minnesota. Minnesota is only an example of a State. How about Missouri and other states? More importantly, the need is driven by the surveillance test, which can be conducted by almost any organization. Every college needs a surveillance test in order to keep its campus open. Based on CEO's interview, any organization requiring over 1000 tests per day would appreciate FLDM solution. Be patient. News are to be released."
"Fludigm ON 11/20/2020 CEO Christopher Linthwaite sold 84,820 shares at $6.06 for $514,009. On 11/24/2020, four days later, at the Piper Sandler 32nd Annual Virtual Health conference, he stated the two Fludigm franchises were under-valued for various reasons. My question... If FLDM is undervalued and the tech is disruptive, why not buy FLDM instead of dumping over a half-million in stock? Chris put your money where your mouth is. Buy your stock instead of dumping it. Give this post a thumbs up if you agree."
"Hot off the stocktwits presses:Well...yahoo finance is not allowing me to cut and paste from stocktwits (apparently, they have an anti-stocktwits police force on duty)...so let me reiterate the message if not the exact words.BTIG analyst Sung Ji Nam, who has multiple life sciences (biology, etc.) undergraduate degrees and a Harvard MBA, just released her updated research report on Fluidigm, as follows:https://research.btig.com/reports/264ab533-0b3c-4c94-b2b9-78a6b07ad6ff/You'll need to log in, and log in may require a corporate or university email, and not a yahoo, google, aol, hotmail, etc. email.If you can't get in, just know that she reiterates her BUY and $12 price target.She highlights in the title of the report the ""Strong Recovery for the Base Business"" and that Fluidigm is ""Well-Positioned for Accelerated Growth Ahead with the Upcoming New Product Launches Across Mass Cytometry and Microfluidics"".I hope my cutting and pasting the excerpts from the report title will not cause the stocktwits police to spring into action. :)"
Lot of action on the 7.50 August and September strikes looks like somebody expects a big move upward! YES!!!!!
"SRNE is the major competitor in the Covid-19 test using saliva. Its market cap was similar to FLDM in March, and its cap is around $3.5B now. Its saliva test solution was licensed from Columbia University on July 29; this solution needs to be developed further for mass production. Also, no EUA application is even mentioned. In addition, its LAMP -based solution is good for test only. FLDM's RT-PCR is the standard Covid-19 testing solution improved to test saliva samples. It has received a major contract from NIH with EUA expected to be approved. More importantly, FLDM RT-PCR can be used for many applications including single cell tests. FLDM's solution is much more sustainable after Covid-19. I expect FLDM's market cap to reach at least $3.5B."
So if I read this correctly EUA is no longer needed. FLDM can begin testing their sales thresholds. Q3 #’s should explode! https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/testing/recission-guidances-informal-issuances-premarket-review-lab-tests/index.html

"I wanted to find the information about how much money Fluidigm gets if a client runs a test using its equipment and its coding on the integrated fluidic circuits, etc. From the Q2 earnings call:""The next question is from Dan Brennan from UBS. Your line is open.Hi, this is Nathan on for Dan. How are you? ....is it fair to assume like a $10 to $15 ASP range for the test?Chris Linthwaite... So we've given some indication of where our range of pricing is for the emergency use configuration of our product. That product is approximately in the $17 to $22 range. And so it just depends on volumes, supply contract agreements, et cetera, et cetera. And the laboratory developed test version or configuration of our product is generally at a little bit lower price point, but it's not dramatically lower. So generally, those fall within the $7 to $12 range...""As we know, Fluidigm has signed up multiple new customers just recently, most notably Phase2 labs which had started training personnel weeks ago to run Fluidigm tests and plan to ultimately do 36,000 tests per day. By the way, 36,000 tests per day times even the lowest end of the ""Fluidigm EUA"" configuration, is 36,000 times $12 times 90 equals $38,880,000 per 90 day quarter.If you haven't yet read the article, and don't mind subscribing to the Tennesean for $5 for ninety days, just do a search for ""phase2 tennesean fluidigm covid testing"".But that's possibly Q3 business as to the Biomarks, reagent, and integrated fluidic circuit cartridges they must have purchased to do the training. But, otherwise, it's Q4 and beyond business as Fluidigm gears up to deliver the NIH's objective of one million tests per day as of sometime in Q1 2021 (and do the math on THAT).AS to Q3, recognize that Fluidigm got its EUA as of August 25, 2020. It started signing up Fluidigm EUA ($12 to $17) clients immediately. So companies like Vero Diagnostics (3000 tests per day as of mid-September) and Immunogenomics (3000 tests per day as of mid-September) will be part of Q3 both in terms of per sample testing as well as newly purchased Biomarks.But don't forget the many lab developed tests (LDT) clients. Clients like Lab24 (started in April), the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma Medical Center consortium (started in April), etc., etc. They processed LDT-configuration (non-Fluidigm EUA as they had their own EUA) tests for each of the months of Q3. Also, foreign labs like iGLS (see company's PR dated June) and Mirxes of Singapore.So don't believe the snakelike deceivers and their claims that Fluidigm has not successfully signed up MULTIPLE Covid testing clients."
In case you didn't see that this was part of the last post about Spain:https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/24/2052732/0/en/Integrated-Genetics-Lab-Services-Conducting-COVID-19-Testing-in-Spain-Utilizing-Fluidigm-Biomark-HD-Platform.html
"I'm a new investor in Fluidigm, having become very impressed by the NIH RadX initiative video. Since then, I've seen Admiral Brett Giroir's tweet in which he revealed that he would be conducting a webinar for the nation's universities on Covid testing in which he would be joined by Fluidigm. The more confirmation, the better.But I've also done exhaustive DD, including a review of several past quarters' 10-Qs and the associated earnings call transcripts. Those earnings call presentations are very impressive, and I'm struck by how conservative everybody is in their communication of information. No hype, no nonsense. Perhaps when you REALLY have something of value, rather than having to create an illusion of value, you can be conservative while others have to pump stock price to sell shares to stay in business.Speaking of share sales, I'm pleased to read that the CEO said during the Q2 earnings call that he had secured ""non-dilutive"" sources of funds. After having been an owner in my younger days of companies whose only line of business seems to have been hyping and then selling their own shares, it's a refreshing change. I'm not sure what these sources of funds may be, but they likely include funds associated with their ongoing ""epigenetic testing"" collaboration with DARPA (which the CEO couldn't talk about as he said DARPA would be responsible for any and all news releases as they saw fit) as well as the $37 million NIH award.I'm not going to write a multi-page analysis of the company as a whole but I thought I'd just focus on just two news releases that we might see in August. As everybody knows, we're waiting to hear about the EUA. Here are some tidbits from the Q2 earnings call:From the CEO's beginning comments: ""The second spoke is commercializing a Fluidigm-designed singleplex COVID-19 test kit. We filed our Advanta Dx SARS-CoV-2 test for emergency use authorization on June 12, as previously announced. Our collaboration with Washington University accelerated development of a novel extraction-free saliva test, combining their access to clinical samples with our technology, producing a full EUA submission package in a matter of weeks. We remain in close communication with the FDA, and given our pioneering technology and extraction-free saliva test, we are pleased with the level of engagement we have received from the FDA as they complete their review. We are prepared for immediate commercialization and ramp up upon authorization. In addition, we are positioned to service the emerging population screening market.""When asked by an analyst about the EUA submission, the CEO responded by saying, ""with regards to our current singleplex emergency use authorization submission. I think we're very comfortable with the tone and tenor of the dialogue that's occurring as they enter the final stages of review.""Then this question from the UBS analyst:So my first question would be on what type of COVID testing volume do you envision in the second half and then going into 2021? And then I guess, is it fair to assume like a $10 to $15 ASP range for the test?Response:So we've given some indication of where our range of pricing is for the emergency use configuration of our product. That product is approximately in the $17 to $22 range. And so it just depends on volumes, supply contract agreements, et cetera, et cetera. And the laboratory developed test version or configuration of our product is generally at a little bit lower price point, but it's not dramatically lower. So generally, those fall within the $7 to $12 range on a blended basis.As to the NIH $37 million award, that's going to be paid out upon Fluidigm meeting certain thresholds. And the first threshold should be met in August, as follows:""Last Friday, we announced a letter contract with the NIH, Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics program, or RADx. We were among 7 companies to be selected under this $1.5 billion program funded through the CARES Act. Fluidigm was awarded an up to $37 million project under the NIH RADx initiative. An initial $12 million is available upon achievement of milestones under the existing letter contract, and the remaining funds are linked to performance targets in the definitive contract, a process called definitization in government parlance....We have kicked off the project and anticipate initial funding in August, pending achievement of a validation milestone. I look forward to providing updates as we meet major project milestones, and I anticipate adding testing capacity throughout the next 6 months.""Sounds good to me. :)"
hello fellow shareholder. i just got in today. good luck to you all
"The professional analysts were predicting an average of 32.46 million and the company attained 39.9 million plus. PLUS (and I'm not sure I understand this...I'll have to contact the company) we were all expecting $12 million NIH payment to be included in revenue and it was NOT. Why not? Would have brought it to $51.9 million.But 39.9 million from operations PLUS the $12 million not appearing in revenue for whatever reason still led to POSITIVE CASH FLOW.Not too shabby.I wanted to ask why they didn't issue a press release for 36,000 tests per day out of Phase2 Labs (just uncovered in Tennessee's online newspaper The Tennessean). Also, Neo genomics (stock symbol:NEO) which wrote in their Q3 about starting Fluidigm testing.Are they about to issue those press releases to smash the shorts to smithereens? Let's hope.I'll be contacting IR and, if no response, calling company HQ and at least leaving a message for Chris Linthwaite. If no response, a snail mail letter. But then I'll come visit during my upcoming trip to Cali."

Like TBIO my feeling is this will be acquired soon and good time for any company to buy this at the current discounted price
Will this company sold this weekend ? There is no updates or any kind of PR from the company what’s going on with their sales and business prospects. Did anyone attended earnings call? If so what is their answer in selling the company incase if someone asked this question?
"To give you an idea of this company's short interest, just do a search for ""FLDM short interest"". There rea two websites that will be of interest.Fintel's will tell you short volume.

That tells us, for any particular day's trading, what the relative sales were broken down by sales from longs and sales by shorts.Obviously, the shorts are HUGELY helped by those kind investors who join them in selling and even allow them to easily cover by the end of the day.However, they don't all cover.

"What I hope to find out from the Piper Sandler fireside chat tomorrow is what the CEO means by ""capacity increasing to 6 million tests during Q4"".Why the confusion? Because via the earnings call and the press release that came out just before the earnings call we learned that the company had ""enabled"" 43 Biomarks for Covid testing as of November 5. And we know from our long list of about twenty Fluidigm testing clients that most were up and running prior to October 1 (i.e., prior to entering Q4).Which of the twenty or so known clients were NOT testing as of October 1? Dante Labs, Phase2 Labs (about which we learned from the October 25 Tennessean article and now their website had already been training for weeks and anticipated getting up to 36,000 tests per day), the four new Biomarks delivered to Missouri (Truman Medical Center, Cox Health, and the other two not known), and that's about it that I can think of at this moment.So....43 Biomarks with a 6000 per day capacity is 6000 times 43 equals 258,000 tests per day CAPACITY. And that's the word used by the CEO for his 6 million CAPACITY for Q4. But 258,000 tests per day times 90 days equals 23.22 million quarterly capacity, not 6 million.And even if we assume ZERO tests prior to October 1, 258,000 times 60 for just the months of November and December equals 15.48 million.So...I'm thinking that the 6 million capacity is the average MONTHLY capacity for each of the three months of Q4. Something like 5 million October, 6 million November, 7 million December.18 million tests times an average sales price of $10 per test equals $180 million.Just speculation on my part but how to understand 43 BIOMARKS ENABLED (!!!) as of November 5?"
"Anybody catch this mornings webinar? I just invested after reading about the saliva test and all the collaborations with great medical schools etc, got me pumped up that this could be a great investment in the near/short term.

Believe testing increase across covid variants will be significant tail wind. Governments around world will increase virus testing capability....especially for next year or two to ensure vaccine working. Fluidigm equipment also used for mapping cancers. This is foundational diagnostic tech. Buy the low market cap. I believe this stock is fundamentally misunderstood.
"DJ. You provided the following informtion:Negative PCR tests 126,859,171TOTAL test results 155,357,748And then you said, ""Since the US does 1,350,000 test per day (Note: it's actually 1.6 million (far too little) but makes no difference), and since PCR tests can't be more than 10% of the total, you can't do more than 135,000 tests per day.Why on earth would you conclude, based upon the information YOU provided above as to Negative PCR tests and TOTAL PCR tests, that PCR tests are 10% of the total?"

"Here is an old news. Good for most of us to know though. Medical Technology Firm Fluidigm Is Said to Explore Sale. By Manuel Baigorri , Dinesh Nair , and Michelle F Davis; July 27, 2021, 4:02 PM MDT. Updated on July 28, 2021, 5:40 AM MDTU.S. medical technology company Fluidigm Corp. is exploring a sale, people with knowledge of the matter said. The company is working with an adviser to field interest from potential acquirers, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Fluidigm could attract other health-care companies as well as private equity firms, the people said. Deliberations are ongoing, and there’s no certainty they will lead to a transaction, the people said. A representative for Fluidigm declined to comment.Shares of Fluidigm have gained 5.8% this year, giving the South San Francisco-based company a market value of about $476 million. The shares jumped 7.2% in pre-market U.S. trading Wednesday. Fluidigm’s laboratory equipment helps researchers analyze cells and genomes to target conditions like cancer and immune dysfunction. The company released a Covid-19 saliva test that received emergency use authorization last August from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Mergers and acquisitions involving health-care companies have nearly tripled this year to $350.7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Medical diagnostics and equipment companies have been in strong demand, with Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. making a failed attempt last year to acquire European rival Qiagen NV."
"IMO FLDM is going to be bought up in very near future, too much potential and the price is depressed, we are lower then CODX and SRNE and that's way undervalued !"
"Fluidigm (NASDAQ:FLDM) had its price target hoisted by investment analysts at Piper Sandler from $9.00 to $12.00 in a research report issued to clients and investors on Friday, The Fly reports. The brokerage presently has an overweight rating on the medical research companys stock. https://thefly.com/news.php?symbol=FLDM"
"There were 56 millions flu cases in the US last year. Good to know this announcement from CODX on the durability of PCR tests. ""Due to the similarity in symptoms between the common cold, the flu, and COVID-19, even vaccinated patients exhibiting any of these related symptoms will still require testing for differentiation. For this reason, the Company believes a durable market will persist for its ABC test long after a COVID-19 vaccine is widely available, and that the test marks the Company's entrance into the high-demand upper respiratory diagnostic space, independent of COVID-19."""
nothing yet..its coming typicqlly 30 days from application. what people don't realize is fldm is only one of 7 companies out of 600 that applied and got to phase 2 NIN grant program..fda qpproval sends them into phase 3 where monies with be granted to help manufacturer the test..that is huge. I would say we have about a week to hear back from fda. staying in as long as it takes.
"The hope of vaccines dominates the current market, and Covid-19 test companies such as FLDM is considered to be negatively affected. I have studied the earnings report, two conference presentations and CODX’s argument on the durability of the Covid-19 test market. I expect to see FLDM’s Q4 to be better than Q3, and the earnings in 2021 to be better than that in 2020. As for the stock price before the next earning report in February 2021, I have no ideas."

"AMAZING FROM ADM Brett GiroirAnother positive result of tight collaboration by developers at #SalivaDirect with @US_FDA. I have had extensive discussions with the developers, and will have a national technical webinar this week targeted to higher ed for #SalivaDirect, with @fluidigm and @thermofisher"
The price-book ratio is 1.01 compared to the industry median of 3.65 and the price-sales ratio is 1.13 versus the industry median of 3.41. The 14-day relative strength index of 19 suggests the stock is oversold. Wall Street issued an overweight recommendation rating with an average target price of $8.30. I like the calls may get more from this sleeper.
Why can't this company make a profit? it seems to have good products and talent. I read the CC call transcripts and can't understand why the Analysts did not push this issue?
"""This is a different world from the one we knew a few months ago,” said Chris Linthwaite, Fluidigm President and CEO. “While the pandemic has created near-term headwinds, it has also delivered new opportunities. Our extremely high-throughput Biomark system enables labs to process up to 6,000 samples per day and is being employed in the global build-out of COVID-19 testing infrastructure. Our mass cytometry platform is measuring immune response in experimental new treatments and for characterization of COVID-19 induced immune response in the infected population. As a market leader in immune monitoring we are uniquely well-positioned to support testing of investigational new vaccines and therapeutics. I am impressed by our organization’s ability to adapt to the rapidly changing landscape."

"One of the most puzzling aspects of Fluidigm is its tiny price to sales ratio.Forget about Covid play companies. Let's just take a look at life sciences lab equipment manufacturers. I think FLDM is the king of all of those companies, particularly in the small cap realm, because of its world leading mass cytometry line. One award after another, placements in the world's leading research institutions, Stanford U administering the cyTOF (Fluidigm trademarked term) Forum or cytoforum by which the world's researchers ""meet"" and discuss methodologies and publications involving Fluidigm's mass cytometer.And yet, look at life sciences equipment manufacturers Nanostring and Pacific Bio:NSTG Price/Sales of 11.62PACB 24.33And yet FLDM is at 4.18 (as reported in ""Statistics"" in Yahoo! Finance).So why is Fluidigm the one that is relentlessly attacked by shorts? FLDM is the only one of the three that is involved in Covid (and all the revenues that will be generated from it).Yesterday, a ballpark 25% of the shares that were sold were sold by shorts according to Fintel (do a search for short interest and look for Fintel's site). Care to reveal why THIS is the company you're targeting, shorts?Why Fluidigm when Fluidigm has extraordinary merit and is dirt cheap relative to market-wide unbelievably inflated price to sales ratio stocks?"
"We have all seen Citron give scathing analyses of companies whose products, financials, management, etc., are suspect, and Citron has backed up their observations with short positions in those companies. Well, the fact that they LIKE Fluidigm is reason in itself to go long, which I did this afternoon, in addition of course to having done my own DD."
Hope someone buy this company in the weekend
No reason to sell.
"I have been bashing the CEO about lack of being shareholder friendly and failing to provide material updates or guidance. To his credit he has come out from under his rock and provided some updates, however, he has still failed to provide revenue guidance which is what the street needs. Last week competitor QDEL provided guidance and that stock has been up almost everyday. With FLDM we are left guessing on revenues.IMO the recent PR actually exposes FLDM’s weakness, which is the cost of the Biomark. As I posted many months ago the material win for FLDM would be the sales of Biomarks not only for the equipment revenue, but for the future recurring revenue they would generate. I had hoped the NIH grant was to place Biomarks, but it appears so far to be to subsidize tests for use at Universities which already have Biomarks. That raises the possibility of no new Biomark sales from NIH contract, and also means that since the Biomarks are being utilized for COVID testing, then they aren’t being used for research which means reduced revs from research. Don’t get me wrong revs will be up big, there will be increased Biomark sales, and I think the stock is undervalued at 8 going into earnings, but my hope to really move the stock was for Biomark sales to large commercial labs and I haven’t seen that in any PR."
"the BEST quarter in the history of this company, which is understandable. However, this looks like it's just the beginning. The campus testing piece looks really really promising."
I have been pondering the competition effect of Abbot's test. I believe that people will choose the saliva test over the swab test 10 out of 10 times. I also believe that people would pay a reasonable premium if given a choice between the two. If FLDM can prove reproducible quality and reliability of supply and at a price between $5- and $10- they have a big advantage.
"Here's another interesting discussion from the CEO during the Q2 earnings call:""...the third spoke in our wheel is a constructive partnership with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, within the Department of Defense, and Mount Sinai's Icahn School of Medicine. Our previously announced partnership focuses on an Epigenetic Characterization and Observation, or ECHO, program, and includes financial support for development of pathogen detection solutions based on our technology.The ECHO program progressed in Q2, and consortium members have provided updates to government stakeholders and regulators. Communication details are being coordinated by DARPA. This program is independent of our other EUA programs. However, the assay will run on our Biomark platform and represents a future menu expansion. We are grateful for this partnership and excited about the future.""Management was unable to be more forthcoming about this program, but one analyst's questions coaxed a tiny bit more information about the program:Nathan Treybeck, UBSOkay. Great. Thank you for that. In terms of the DARPA ECHO program, can you provide an update where that stands? I believe press reports back in April said that DARPA is expected to file an EUA in 2Q, and that obviously hasn't happened. So like, can you provide just an update on where that program is right now?Chris Linthwaite, CEOSure, Nathan. I'd love to be able to elaborate in greater context beyond what I shared in the prepared remarks. I think the Department of Defense has been posting updates on their website as things progress. And so unfortunately, that organization owns the primary communication to the markets, but we continue to provide all updates to all stakeholders involved and are pleased with the progress....Later:""Okay. And if I could just ask one more. This kind of goes back to the DARPA program and the epigenetic testing. I believe the uniqueness of this approach is about – to detect the virus on day one. Recently, we've done some diligence, and I don't – we haven't run it completely, but some diligence suggests that individuals that don't become contagious until around day three, which we think could limit the opportunity for this test. Is that your understanding? Or are we just not looking at this correctly?""Chris Linthwaite""I can't comment on that particular question that you're asking. I can only say that what we seem to know about COVID changes virtually every day. So I don't know how to respond in that regard. I think that as we've kind of reinforced all the elements, I think we're proposing and we are delivering a whole continuum of different molecular testing technologies that – and tests that are designed to answer different questions, address different use cases, different prevalence rates in different communities and potentially adapt around emerging strains and changes – basically new markers as we learn more about the virus. So I think that one of the powers of our platform is that there's a – it's very flexible and rapidly adaptable to as we learn new information. And we continue to learn new things every day. So I think with that, we're probably going to have to wrap up the line, but really appreciate the questions.""Clearly, there is a lot we don't as yet know about what Fluidigm and DARPA are doing."
"Seems to me those selling are not willing to read or do math. We know how much each test costs, and can extrapolate some conservative estimates for tests per day. I believe each quarter going forward we will see revenue looking more like their current market cap."
"FLDM’s Mass Cytometry is its main product with annual revenues of $46.1M (2017), $59.1M (2018), $72.8M (2019) and $61.6M (2020). The world is moving back to normal, and we expect to see excellent revenues in the coming years. In particular, the new Cytof XT announced today will assure a significant growth. FLDM is excellent in this Mass Cytometry market. Its microfluidics business unit is very strong in technologies, but a good owner is needed for commercialization. Time to sell microfluidics unit while growing mass cytometry."
Any buyers for this company ? IMO this company will be bought by a big one soon.
I am sensing #FLDM will have a buyer this weekend.
"It's a bit difficult to understand why our resident shorts Canudigm and Just a human!, want to continually bash this company.Let's see. Company's award winning lab equipment flying off the shelves, Covid-related and non-Covid-related.$11 million NIH payment received and $22 million now no longer ""proposed"" but now the subject of a signed contract.Covid tests being adopted by commercial labs, Wash U, the state of Missouri, and many other as yet unidentified testing clients (although the categories mentioned in the Motley Fool article pretty much ran the gamut of all possibilities, schools, county health agencies, etc).Company's lab equipment, reagents, etc. ""enabling"" many hundreds of thousands of other company's tests across the country and beyond. The company in its Covid FAQ made mention of having enabled 100,000 tests during the entirety of the 2nd quarter (April, May, June) but having exceeded the Q2 sales of reagents, etc. during just July.DARPA work arising out of detecting bioweapons/chemical weapons now being used to epigenetically detect Covid. EUA may have already been submitted...or maybe not (that would be a DARPA submission). But you can be sure that Fluidigm will continue to develop methodologies for DARPA. DARPA chose them to develop the necessary processing equipment for a reason: they're the recognized leaders in the necessary scientific and engineering prowess to get whatever needs to be done along these lines.The company is developing its barcoding technology which will allow for a quantum leap in throughput per machine. Right now, the state of the art, the absolute cutting edge, in enhancing processing throughput is ""pooling"". Pooling allows a lab to place multiple samples into one testing well in an array of multiple testing wells. Then you process all wells and you can identify which wells may have to least one positive sample! Woohoo! Again, amazing, state of the art, absolute cutting edge. You can process so many more samples at once and just have to go back and run the individual wells that had at least one positive. In other words, if the well had a positive sample among its eight samples, you'd run those eight again to determine which one was positive.Fluidigm is developing barcoding by which it can ""DNA tag"" each individual sample. Multiple samples can indeed be pooled within a single well in an array of multiple wells. But, with barcoding, you don't just identify the wells with positive samples, and then have to rerun all of those wells' samples to identify the positive(s). You immediately identify the individual positive! That's science fiction stuff when done at that scale.And Fluidigm will submit its EUA for that when it's ready. They said they expect to have the EUA approved during Q1 2021 so I would suspect they will actually apply within the next few months.Just that application will be an eye opener for the entire scientific (and investing) community.Remember the CEO's response to the BTIG analyst who said during September 1's ""fireside chat"" that ""your EUA was approved only a week ago but it seems a lot longer than that"". He laughed and said, ""Every Covid day has felt like a year"". They're all working hard like never before. Leading to success after success.I'm looking forward to analyst upgrades/updates Right now, the analysts (well, I know of only the BTIG analyst myself) are all predicting that Q3 will be about what Q2 was. And Q2 had all the country's university labs shut down due to Covid. I'd say that Q3 will be ""slightly"" better than Q2 and, therefore, I expect target prices to increase from the $16 or so where they are now."
Just heard that FLDM got alerted at https://shr.link/Beststockalerts. I hope it pushes us higher!
These days I am hoping this company will be bought by some big company and hanging. I didn’t sell even when it went up to $7.50 levels. Now I need to think what value we are going to get holding this for a long time. Any one have any idea about this or any suggestions?
"Phase 2 Labs about to start processing up to 36,000 tests a day on Fluidigm.Full article link on Stocktwits"
Revenue growth in line. Good to see non Covid revenue perform well. Slight earnings miss….do think this will make a good plug in acquisition for larger pharma or diagnostics company. Personally think they are sandbagging the Covid numbers - given vax hesitancy I believe Covid will be with us for years and testing for variants as well as preparedness for other pandemics will increase not decrease. They may be under calling Covid as a hedge for base growth. I am less confident than 6 months ago but still think there platform is market leading based on family members who work in this space. Good luck longs - expect to see us down over next few days…..hopefully they will give some good commercial guidance on call!

"Biden invests $1.6 billion in COVID-19 tests, genomic sequencingAriel Cohen 3 hrs agoThe Biden administration plans to invest $1.6 billion toward improving COVID-19 testing and genomic sequencing of the coronavirus while it waits for lawmakers to approve more funds through the congressional COVID-19 relief package.The new investments are designed to expand COVID-19 testing in schools and underserved communities, ramp up domestic manufacturing of testing supplies and raw materials to address shortages and rapidly increase genomic sequencing of the virus to better track COVID-19 variants and mutations, national testing coordinator Carole Johnson told reporters Wednesday. Public health officials said the increase in testing would help Americans safely return to work and school and the investment in variant tracking could help prevent the spread of mutations.“To be clear, these resources are a significant help in the short term but they are far from what’s necessary to meet the needs for community testing across the country. They are merely a bridge until Congress passes the American Rescue Plan,” Johnson said, referring to Biden’s proposal.Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package includes $49 billion for COVID-19 testing and $1.8 billion for genomic sequencing.The Department of Health and Human Services will partner with the Department of Defense to make a $650 million investment to expand testing in K-8 schools and congregate settings, such as homeless shelters. The departments will help create testing hubs that partner with laboratories across the country and expect to perform an additional 25 million tests per month. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci said it would be impractical to require all teachers to get vaccinated before returning to in-person learning but encouraged states to make teachers a vaccination group priority. The Biden administration has said it wants to get kids back in schools, but safety measures should be taken, such as distancing, mask-wearing and proper ventilation. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s school reopening plan does not require that all teachers be vaccinated.CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said it’s important to see a decrease in community spread of the virus before returning to in-person learning. Last week, 90 percent of U.S. schools were in the highest level red zone of community spread, but this week just 75 percent of schools are in a red zone.HHS and DOD will also make an $815 million investment in increasing domestic manufacturing of testing supplies and raw materials, including filter pipette tips, nitrocellulose used in antigen point-of-care tests and specific injected molded plastics needed to house testing reagents.Finally, the CDC will increase genomic sequencing of the virus with a $200 million investment in expanding sequencing capabilities including bioinformatics, reporting and modeling. This funding surge will provide a three-fold increase in the CDC’s sequencing capacity and should allow it to scale up to 20,000 samples per week. The CDC expects to leverage commercial laboratories, academic and research institutions and other laboratories across the country to increase sequencing. This investment is particularly important as more COVID-19 variants arise across the country. Virus variants from the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil have already made landfall in the United States. In a new study released Sunday, scientists reported seven additional mutations of COVID-19 that originated in the U.S. All seven variants are evolving from the same mutation, Q677. Scientists are still unsure if these new variants are more contagious or deadly.Fauci said scientists are closely tracking whether vaccinated people can transmit the virus, and while more research is needed, early studies suggest positive trends. Scientific studies have been able to prove that there is a direct correlation between viral load and transmissibility, which suggests that vaccines can reduce transmissibility.Fauci pointed to Israel, which has seen a decrease in community spread after vaccinating much of its population, as an indicator that vaccines slow transmissibility. The National Institutes of Health and Moderna are currently conducting more research on this, as is Pfizer.Do you think this is good news for Fluidigm, especially since the HHS has already selected Fluidigm?:https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/FLUIDIGM-CORPORATION-7331311/news/Fluidigm-HHS-Trump-Administration-Provides-Saliva-Test-at-Surge-Testing-Site-in-Waco-TX-31567100/"

"###:Yale intends to provide the SalivaDirect protocol to interested laboratories as an “open source” protocol, meaning that designated laboratories could follow the protocol to obtain the required components and perform the test in their lab according to Yale’s instructions for use. Because this test does not rely on any proprietary equipment from Yale and can use a variety of commercially available testing components, it can be assembled and used in high-complexity labs throughout the country, provided they comply with the conditions of authorization in the EUA.This is the fifth test that the FDA has authorized that uses saliva as a sample for testing. Testing saliva eliminates the need for nasopharyngeal swabs, which have also been prone to shortages, and alleviates the patient discomfort associated with these swabs. Since the saliva sample is self-collected under the observation of a healthcare professional, it could also potentially lower the risk posed to healthcare workers responsible for sample collection. While FDA has seen variable performance in tests using saliva, Yale School of Public Health submitted data with its EUA request from which the FDA determined that Yale’s test meets the criteria for emergency authorization when used to test saliva samples for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 infection.:###https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-issues-emergency-use-authorization-yale-school-public-health"

"FLDM-U.S. military scientists design new early COVID-19 test, Guardian saysScientists working for the U.S. military have designed a new coronavirus test that could possibly identify carriers of the virus before they become infectious and spread the virus, The Guardian's Giles Tremlett reports. Project coordinators are hoping that the blood-based test will be able to detect the virus' presence as soon as 24 hours after infection, Tremlett says. The test could open up the possibility of isolating pre-infectious cases and shutting down transmission claims, the author says, noting that it could also dramatically lower quarantine periods for those exposed to COVID-19 spreaders. ""It could have exceptional demand,"" said Fluidigm CEO Chris Linthwaite, who believes frequent testing can help manage workforces as they return to places of business. Fluidigm is part of the testing project, according to The Guardian."

Due to eqpt and facilities lead time, the new cap only in place in Q2 this year.Their equipment is selling like hot cakes, IFC, an important consumer chips is limited by capacity constraints.So 2020 will be very good year. But my guess is 2021 will be excellent year.I held many k shares at $6.5 to $9.9. But will still hold even after their FY2020 ER. This Company is not only for COVID-19, but Covid makes FLDM famous. Many hospitals and specialists now already heard of them... Good other analysis like Cancer...etc.The up and down now is with Short, Don't just listen to me check it out yrself."
"I'm surprised we haven't seen analyst upgrades as yet. Maybe we'll see some soon.For those who can access the BTIG web page (I registered using my university email account), you'll see that analyst Sung Ji Nam has a price target of $14 and a ""buy"" rating (the highest at BTIG). She updated as of September 1 when the company had just been granted their EUA, had no Covid testing clients as yet (at least publicly announced), and hadn't received anything from the NIH.So her revenue projections were as follows, all lab-equipment-related as it appears to me:Q2 2020 actual 26.06 millionQ3 forecast 26.94Q4 33.43Q1 2021 forecast 39.12Q2 40.95Q3 41.91Q4 44.78So, with the benefit of new news, I kinda question her numbers. Q3 2020 same as Q2 (???!!!) when Q2 was very bad due to most labs closing, no hint of the NIH payment, no hint of new Covid testing clients, and still (as to Q3) apparently a very pessimistic view of labs reopening.Just the $12 million NIH payment slated to be paid ""by the end of Q3"" should alone skyrocket Q3 revenues."
Citron Research priced at $30 a couple of months ago. $22 is achievable this year
"That was an embarrasing presentation that gave investors not a whiff of how much money they were making off of Covid. Have to assume it ain't much, then. That's the way it goes."
"EQUIPMENT POST #1SAM asked, "" Can you research more on their production ? They have 2 types of manufacturing lines. Equipment and a special consumable chip.” Hi SAM. AS I suggested earlier, a good place to start would be to check out the Investor Presentation which can be found on the Fluidigm website. https://investors.fluidigm.com/static-files/c777bfb8-1c4b-44df-a65b-392633c968da On page 31, you can see that Fluidigm breaks down its revenues in many ways. One way is by market and you can see that Fluidigm’s revenues are from approximately 48% microfluidics and 52% mass cytometry. Let’s start with microfluidics. That type of lab equipment can be used to process multiple samples simultaneously. As a result, nowadays it’s being used not only for scientific and medical research, but also to process Covid tests. If you want to get a look at what a microfluidics machine looks like, and specifically a Fluidigm Biomark microfluidics machine, check out this picture: https://mobile.twitter.com/fluidigm/status/1296191842497658881?lang=en By the way, the prior picture was accompanied by August 19 tweets from a Singapore company named Mirxes and Fluidigm by which a partnership was announced. Mirxes as of last May was doing 500,000 tests per week (!!!) and they want Biomarks to run those tests. Each Biomark can amazingly process 6000 tests per day but they’ll still need a bunch more $250,000 Biomarks! https://vulcanpost.com/701141/mirxes-covid-19-test-kit-manufacturer-singapore/ So what about that “chip” to which you refer? This Youtube video announced the first set of seven winners of the NIH’s “shark tank” competition by which Fluidigm’s microfluidics capabilities so impressed the NIH that they won an NIH grant which turned out to be $34 million dollars. The Fluidigm portion begins at about 15:00: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uewWk85XQU&t=1082s So that chip is not really a consumable as you suggest...but an integral part of the hardware. It's what can be ""programmed"", so to speak, to search for whatever you want to find from among the samples. If it's Covid, for example, the chip says to look for Covid. If it's influenza, the chip says to look for influenza. In fact, a Fluidigm Biomark can simultaneously look for up to 24 total pathogens in a single processing run. It's almost science fiction.What are ""consumables"" If I could make an analogy, think about printer ink for a computer printer. The computer printer is the hardware and the printer ink is what's ""consumed"" during every printing ""run"". So, too, are chemical reagents used when doing a Fluidigm lab equipment processing run.And, by the way, that's only one of many consumables of a long list of consumables that are utilized depending on what machine is used and how it is being used. Another thing to remember about consumables is that they're extraordinarily profitable for Fluidigm. Looking at that page 31 of the Investor Presentation again, you'll notice that 34% of Q2 revenues were consumables. That's about $7 million of the $21 million total. And that was during a quarter when most labs were closed and were not running Fluidigm equipment. At the very least, we know that university labs were closed as universities were shit down altogether. Q3's consumable revenues should be higher just because labs have now been reopened. I've got more to say about microfluidics, as well as the other major category, mass cytometry, but that will have to wait for my next post. :)"
"The company has had three pretty good days. Wednesday, we learned that the Greek petroleum company had donated two $300,000 Fluidigm Biomarks and 50,000 reagents to two Greek hospitals. Yesterday, we found out that the Truman Medical Center in Kansas City, Missouri (60,000 emergency room visits per year) had chosen Fluidigm for all its Covid tests. And today this. Not too shabby."
Could be an announcement for the Next Gen Biomark HD instrument or even a big COVID testing grant from the government coming soon? Tomorrow morning will be interesting!
"With the Abbot’ novel testing device, it is good to be conservative. Here is my estimate on FLDM’s revenue and the market cap. Assume FLDM can reach only 50,000 tests per day, which is 1/20 of the NIH RADx’ goal to reach 1M tests per day. It is the additional revenue resulting from the COVID test:50,000 x $10 x 365 = $182M. The total revenue including FLDM’s current products ($130M) would be around $300M. The enterprise value is 6X of the revenue, so it is $1,800M. With 71M shares, the target price is $25 per share. Not bad even from such a very conservative estimate."
