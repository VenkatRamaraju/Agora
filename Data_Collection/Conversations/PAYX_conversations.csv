Got my dividend!!!
"The earnings miss is bad because the price was rather inflated already. I've always liked this company, but it's overvalued, it's PE too high based on potential earnings. I'd buy more at $60, but think of it as a hold at this high price. About all you can get from it at this price is the dividend until its earnings catch up to this lofty valuation. It holds little value for new investments."
"Great week for PAYX, up to all time high to end the trading week."
"Patients will receive an initial 12 weekly intravenous doses of study drug; additional weekly dosing can be administered for partial responders and relapsers. The primary endpoint, which could suffice for full approval, is reduction in proteinuria at 24 weeks after the start of dosing. The trial will employ an adaptive design that will allow intra-trial adjustment in sample size. For purposes of safety and efficacy assessments, the initial sample size for the proteinuria endpoint is estimated at 140 patients in each of the treatment and placebo groups. This will include a subset of patients with high levels of proteinuria (i.e., equal to or greater than 2 g/day) at baseline, and full approval could also be obtained if a substantial improvement is seen at 24 weeks in this subset of patients alone. The trial design will allow assessment for either full or accelerated approval at 24 weeks based on proteinuria results either (1) across the general population of study patients or (2) in the high-proteinuria subset of patients. In the event that the primary endpoint at 24 weeks results in accelerated approval from FDA, change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) will be assessed at approximately three years after the start of dosing. The initial sample size estimate for the eGFR endpoint is approximately 160 patients per group and also will be adjustable under the study’s adaptive design.Love PAYX but OMER will explode this week."
"PAYX could be a buyout candidate, but I hope not. Better in it's own. Workday, or Buffet may want to buy. Don't give in!!"
"Not that it matters, other than physiologically, but I think they could announce a split soon."
Employment soaring! Interest rates climbing and will continue to climb. Both extremely positive for Paychex
expensive but very well managed
Almost guaranteed a rate increase in Dec. that means MORE money for the Paychex!!!
PAYX reached a new All Time High at 71.11
Market up over 100 and this stock is up only 5 cents... any opinions??!
This was a big unforeseen reversal after this morning. Something bad on the conference call? Hopefully a minor sell off before a push above $100.
"unfortunately I sold after the div and bought Boeing for another div payment. $15,369 total for last qtr. $60k in div not sure why I waited so long to invest in div."
"Sidelined, but impressed. My bad. Congrats to longs."
great timing off to the races by May this will be
Anyone adding at these levels just under $57?
PAYX reached an all time high at 86.04
Come on split! $100+ today...sweeeeeet!
10% over valued. i am selling
This IMO will be the most awesome stock to buy when we see some light at the end of the tunnel. Awesome dividend now but if it hits the 5% plus market it will be the buy of the century.
$826M to $866M what am I missing?
i sold 300 shares
What No dividend in May ??????
"Reports and beats, no mention on CNBC? Higher interest rates = more money. Investment income up 25%. More hikes to come."
"If this beats tomorrow and they announce dividend increase plus stock split, this thing could jump 5%-10% in a hurry."
"Soldout prior to last quarterly report at $80.01, after years of holding. Missed out on the entire (overvalued?) runup to $88. To those of you who cashed in after me for $83-$88, congratulations. I'm prepared to repurchase, as I still like PAYX, but believe it is NOT a bargain buy in the $80s. I'll stick with my valuation convictions and consider a repurchase when this falls back down below $75/share. JMHO"
Came 1 penny away from hitting all time high. hopefully we do that next week.
Do I hear $110?
added to Valuelines Div Portfolio sometime ago. I would add if BA wasn't so good.
Any predictions for earnings?
"Based on the 1 year chart, it's been consolidating since May. forming a cup, just needs the handle. I expect a major breakout soon."
Great quarter. Trump could derail this with his push for lower interest rates. Jobs slowing because his trade war.
do u think this will ever split again ????????????
Will this stock stay above $90 if we go back to a full lockdown ?
Let's get back over $100 and stay there for good.
My guess is that PAYX is due for a pullback in the short-run. the other week awesomeSTO-CKS alerted this company i think. google them .
consolidation is happening. U6 unemployment rates topping off. keep an eye for topping off of the stock.
$20 off its high
Should open at another 52 week high.
Do not let minor price fluctuations deter you from staying long on the this great American company. No debt + rising interest rates + diversified product offer + 3% dividend yield = Excellent long term investment.
Valuelines #1 pick in their Dividend Portfolio along with WM
Wondering when the next 3 for 2 split is coming or even 2 for 1?
dividends sure add up quickly
"Both ADP and PAYX falling hard together. The street believes this segment of business, payroll and employee management, is going to suffer worse than most other areas."
Hold the $100 line!!
Anyone catch the Cramer interview with our CEO tonight?
was the conference call bad? how can this be down?
Some may recall I called for a pause of the dividend about 2 years ago to buy back stock with the promise of a special dividend at the end. We would be at $150 right now.
What impact on Paychex small business customer base resulting from nationwide $15/hour minimum wage?
Jay you're not an expert in anything
Paychex is up 5.95% to 93.26
sure glad I sold and bought more Boeing
holding up pretty well
Anybody playing earnings??
Don’t understand beat expectation and up early on but down at the end of the day
"This company has a good record for beating ERs, not that it means much. What do you guys think the ER will look like? Just curious"
Anyone go to the Shareholder meeting this year? Anything to share? I didn't get any info on this. Thanks!
i started following Valueline as a retiree I buy the Dividend Portfolio also the Income and appreciation. its a S/W program critiqued over the years. Amazes me how much rolls over to my BECU account every qtr.
can we get to $80?
As I said one month ago PAYX is basing at $90. And it’s did it. Now fighting for all time high.
Still like it even up here
Another 52 week high!!! Reminds me of the glorious 90's with this stock.
.53 eps year ago to .62 eps next qtr. BAC dwn grade concensus falling while jobs report great. target fell to 63 while its trading higher. Makes one think the market is being manipulated by the Left.
this is going upppppp
we need a new target
"PAYX is an excellent stock for the value dividend growth investor. No long term debt, diversified product offering, excellent management, prudent acquisition strategy, and great dividend that yields north of 3%. Stay long on this great American company."
Is it true that paychecks is dropping dividends for shareholders?
i sold this to buy up and comers not saying expect the target to move above 69
wheres an upgrade? one would think 12% rise in div
Why can’t this stock go over 73?
Are they reporting earnings after the bell???
I started listening ULTIMATSTOKC ALERTS and their suggestions are incredible .
Div raised to .62/Q
Why isn’t it holding the high it reached today?Profit taking???
My hometown company 
Layoffs?
"2.28.2020 -- Kupferberg said Paychex’s valuation is a bit extended given the company’s lackluster fundamentals. After a big 2019, Paychex shares now trade at a significant premium PEG multiple relative to peers. In addition, he's concerned about competition, particularly in the company’s core payrolls business. The stock is down 8.7% this year, but Kupferberg said the stock’s 3.2% dividend should provide a bit of downside protection for the stock at some point. Bank of America has an Underperform rating and $82 price target for PAYX stock."
$90 to $75 inside the last 10 trading days.
"MZOR : After blow out earnings, MZOR hits another 52 week high. This could be another ISRG !!!RESULTS OF 13 POPULAR ANALYTICSOverall Average: 100% Strong Buy"
I think PAYX might have reached its upward limit and that a pullback may be possible. Do you guys find it difficult to know when to buy or sell something? I prefer to get my stocks from awe-someSTOCKS.
"Stock price $60+ / Book Value $5.48 / EPS $2.32 / Dividend $2.00Several key officers more than taken care of, rather highly compensated With that combination, best thing for a retail shareholder is a sellout."
"A “bear market” is when stocks see a 20 percent decline or more from a recent high — but they’re also marked by overall pessimism on Wall Street. Since World War II, bear markets have lasted, on average, 13 months while stock markets tend to lose 30.4 percent of their value.-------Not sure when this bear started, but if around Oct 4th, then we've got approximately 10 more months to go to reach 13 months."
a dividend play
thinking of selling expecting a dip despite all the hype
c
"Let's have a pullback before dividend, then a surge. I just want a good price on my Divi reinvestment."
It's killing it!!!? Let's get to $90...
Any day is the first day of the rest of your life!
"With small businesses destroyed by the coronavirus (CV), the crux of Paycheck revenues are dropping rather dramatically. Further, with interest rates at 0%, Paychex ""float income"" goes to $0. This one-two punch explains why PAYX will remain way down on stock price until after the CV subsides across America. At that point in time, $50s will be viewed as a steal."
great performance
We kissed $100. Good earnings we blow way through it. I also think they announce a split with earnings.
add here 4 div
7% qtrly revenue growth
Will add at $90 if we get there
tax cuts this qtr
This stock will be down for awhile mostly deals with small businesses which are being hit hard.Maybe a good time to buy more shares?
We received a 6% increase in dividends from $.62 to $.66 per quarter I'm A very happy stockholder!
"If a recession is caused by the Kung-flu, with low interest rates, this will not a good thing at all for us."
PAYX reached a 52 Week low at 57.01
Why is this stock down on an up day?
"If we get negative interest rates, it will cost payx big time. Vote Trump out! He's pushing for it."
PAYX reached a 52 Week low at 63.61

"Quit posting nonsense. A stock that earns $3 isn't worth $100. Closer to $50. Nice company, but overpriced, like most are."
New this stock not sure if I should hold or sell... any ideas on how this stock will fair next year?
Way to Buck the trend on a bad day! Go Paychex!
I hope the dividend reinvest happens at the end of the day....
Will we see $80 this week???
Beat top and bottom line...raised guidance..and it’s down...tough market
Let's march up and take out our 52 week high.... Let's get over $100. I think at least a 2-1 split announced next month. Perhaps a 3-1. The announcement would also get us some great attention.
Hit new 52 week high today
DIVIDEND ANNOUNCEMENT??
Do I hear $80? I would think we'll get a 2 for 1 split over $90.
"The problem with Paychex is the model for customers is very annoying. We use Paychex, have approximately 200 employees and rather than build all standard reporting into the baseline cost, everything is an adder. For example, every company in the US has to do Workers Comp reporting; this worker's comp report is an ADDED FEE. That is the approach with everything. Now everyone knows, once the report is created by Paychex, they just keep rolling it out at no additional cost to Paychex. This is a huge mistake that smaller payroll companies are seizing upon. This is why after 15 years with Paychex we are exploring other companies and it is not ADP. It appears the secondary processors have outsmarted the two majors.unfortunate because changing payroll processors is a hassle."
#1 in the Valueline div portfolio
Next week $90???
Will the job numbers on Friday effect this stock?
.53 to .63 eps yoy very high expectations but why 3.0 concensus? I don't get this but remains in the Valueline Div Portfolio.
Awesome timing announcing $400M stock repurchase along with the dividend. Paychex leadership team rocks! CEO - agree?
"Congrats everyone, It's dividend day!!!! I saw a commercial on ESPN yesterday for Paychex's baby cash cow company. Let#$%$ $100..."
"Next quarter will be even better!!! Maybe another raise in the prime, which means more profit, win win for the stockholders !"
Where is that dividend ?
"For the short term, the technical indicators such as the MACD and the 20 and 40 day exponential moving average have been pointing to a price decrease for some time. It appears that the technical indicators have won out at least for the short term."
very hard to get a dispersal from the co. at some time the poor customer service will reflect neg. on the share price.
Can this stock go above $90???
New all time high!!!
Will paychex buy another company here? Do they get bought out? Interesting. No one knows where this is going.
"Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare syndrome of hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and renal insufficiency. Genetic mutations in the alternate pathway of complement are well recognized as the cause in more than 60% of patients affected by this thrombotic microangiopathy. The identification of aHUS as a disease of the alternate pathway of complement enables directed therapeutic intervention both in the acute and chronic setting and may include one or all of the following: plasma therapy, complement blockade, and liver transplantation. Because aHUS shares many of the presenting characteristics of the other thrombotic microangiopathies, and confirmatory genetic results are not available at the time of presentation, the diagnosis relies heavily on the recognition of a clinical syndrome consistent with the diagnosis in the absence of signs of an alternate cause of thrombotic microangiopathy. Limited understanding of the epidemiology, genetics, and clinical features of aHUS has the potential to delay diagnosis and treatment. To advance our understanding, a more complete characterization of the unique phenotypical features of aHUS is needed. Further studies to identify additional genetic loci for aHUS and more robust biomarkers of both active and quiescent disease are required. Advances in these areas will undoubtedly improve the care of patients with aHUS."
up on low volume
"Breakout, New 52 well High!!!! Let#$%$ 80!!!"
Uh oh....down in the morning $6.00. Could go back up this afternoon.
"split pls? like the old days when I worked there!!! :) Great company, great product, great people..."
Slowing
"I still hold 1k shares of steady dividend paying PAYX. But with small business America declining due to COVID, what is driving Paychex toward its previous $90 high?"
Is this likely to beat earnings??
New 52 week high today. Congrats fellow Longs!!!
"with all these layoffs, who expect this stock to go up?"
"Big job numbers, higher interest rates. Why is this down? They need to buyback more shares or raise the dividend."
Let's take out $100 today!!!
Any chance this stock will increase its dividend?
"We did it! Congrats Longs! All time high! First time ever crossing $100! Thank you Galisano for staying this company. You're a great philanthropist, and I thank you for that as well. Have a great weekend everyone!"
"I note others make my same assessment..Great company, but overpriced stock. They are saying it's worth $58. That sounds about right. I'd love to own it, but not at this price! Almost guaranteed not to make money on it at this price. By the time earnings catch up to its price (over a year), the economy will have a hiccup, and you lost your investment. I see lots if stocks like that today. It's nothing like the 1990's bubble, but the pickings are slim for those looking for decent value. And with interest rates rising, other investment choices besides stocks loom on the horizon."
Hit over $80. Just needs to close above now.
Must be up on the dividend reinvest.
target fell to 63
Xdiv 5/14 - .62. First time in a long time that they haven’t done an annual dividend increase. Not a good sign. But at least it’s not a cut. 3.7 yield ain’t so bad.
Paychex reached an all time high at 93.26
"Great numbers. Congrats once again, Longs. Let's take out that $100 level and make that the floor. I believe they always announced their splits in Feb/March in the past if I remember correctly. 3/2 will not cut it this time, too high. I'm thinking a 3 for 1."
Moving closer to that $120 level...All time highs along the way. Congrats Longs! Dividend dropping soon.
"$85 - very impressive pricing power, especially considering insiders have been selling option shares."
remains on the Valueline Div portfolio
"Also, so far no coverage on cnbc. No news. Not on early movers. Nothing. Where is the respect and recognition? It was released on Yahoo 20 minutes ago?"
It always jumps right before the dividend payout.
Are we going to $90?
Paychex reached an all time high at 99.50
ALT Immune mrna ino all move off 60 min spce swav just because

Why can’t this stock go above 86?
looking at Valueline Div portfolio this is rated as high as Boeing WM MCD and MRK but the highest pe of the lot at 29.

"Smart acquisitions, firing on all cylinders. Great dividend for a growth company. Secret can't stay hidden for long. This should be paying just over a 1% dividend.... at a price of $130+ next year."
"IMO, good buy at $65"
Dividend raise should be included in conference call.
WAY TO GO PAYCHEX !! NICE INCREASE!
Paychex will hit $100 this year and announce a 3 for 1 split.

"Repurchased some of the prior sold $80.01 shares at $79.00 today. May start short-term trading PAYX rather than buy/hold at these high levels. Appears PAYX has begun channeling, which makes for a good swing trading stock."
https://finance.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ%3AMZOR&ei=HcjxWYLiCcWz2AawmbuwDw
what's going on here going to have a good earnings report we should be at 61 or 62?
This company has gotten a little ahead of itself. Should return back to mid 60's
PAYX is down -100.00% to 0.00
8.9% rev gwth concensus fell to 3.0 pe fell to 24 so Iam thinking a buy opportunity lurks.
"52 Week High! Congrats longs. I still can't believe it in this environment, but I love it! $100 SOON!!!"
Will payx buy applied underwriters?
Acquisition of HROI smart move. PEO is a rapidly growing space. Love this company. Great dividends!
"Not I don't feel bad taking a little off the table at $80. I did at first when it kept climbing. However, I did turn back on my dividend reinvest. Just thought it got ahead of itself. Still love it long term."
"Not sure I am an ""expert in CNS diseases"" as you say, but one of my past students is a Chair in Neurology at a major midwest medical school and my bud Cliff Saper is the top Neurology Act at the Harvard Teaching Hospitals. If I cannot be an expert, at least I can give the experts a call. Now I am more of a 'jack of all trades' than an expert in any specific area. That's the dilemma of a broad-based small molecule pharmaceutical efforts. I recently re-invested in OMER, and have a small position. I am in it for the complement related nephropathy and allied efforts with OMS721. I am a big fan of this complement approach, and the data that I have seen publicly. I have been a critic of the company in the past, and I do agree there is great potential. The stock price certainly has not run away from me. I also understand that OMER needs to be more that a 1 or 2 trick pony (Omridia and the 721 efforts), and as they sometimes say in the industry ""the need to feed the [discovery and development] beast"". People with specialties need to keep working on important research areas, but this is costly. It is easy for me to be a quick critic without seeing the company's white paper and data set on the PDE7 inhibitor. I do know that PFE experts had concerns. I generally have a tough time with addictive disorders, as over eating is one such disorder and I got burned on that in a few different ways in the past. But I do know one can get burned on these addictive disorder approaches with issues as diverse as selectivity of compounds, selectivity of the precise approach without a solid understanding of the pathways/neurons involved, unexpected CNS side effects, and ultimately, the ability to have successful approvable trials for registration. This is a very tough area. I can say some of the same for Parkinson's disorders, but in addition there are some exciting clinical approaches on metabotropic glutamate receptors, so always new innovation ongoing. So, I have reason to be quite cautious, smitty, maybe overly so."
i sold this to buy more Boeing
"Very unusual high volume (>10,000) in PAYX Jul 19 calls. Stock is even and this call is up about 30%."
Buyout ?
Is the ex-date 2/14/19? Zacks and Morningstar have last Ex date of 1/31/19. Even Nasdax shows January 31 not Feb 14. Total is showing wrong ex date on Yahoo. Be warned. Need to double check these dates before purchase.
"Great company but stock is priced too high. With interest rates rising, multiples will decline across the entire market..PAYX has exceptionally high multiples for this type of business. So, it will get hit a bit harder. To make decent money, it needs to be priced below $57, preferably $55 or less instead the current $61. Otherwise it's dead money over the next 12+ months. Hold, but don't buy."
Why is PAYX all of a sudden taking on debt? They never had debt before. Interest rate hikes starting today should increase profitability big time.
"PAYX needs to start thinking of a total package with small businesses. They could have easily been Square. One stop shop. Fintech, payments, etc. Long term holder since the 90's. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon reinvented themselves and created new products with the times. I can actually see this getting acquired by someone like Buffet. I would rather have them roll out profitable me products and have a larger market cap."
"Wow, blasted through $82"
How low do we go? I'm thinking of buying somewhere between $80-82
"Analysts aren't being overly generous, stating already fully valued, contributing to selling pressure."
90 in 4mos?
"With the pandemic slowing down and more ate getting their vaccines, the employment will raise and payroll will increase with it. A win win for Paycheck. Dividend increase is very possible this fall."
"Revenues and EPS - slight beat, steady growth company, solid leadership, nice dividends"
revenue was huge .02 miss is that right?
Another record high...
Isn’t it about time for them to announce the dividend? Last xdiv was 1/31. They are due for a bump. Maybe up to $.68 I should think. Maybe less if the outlook is weak. This might be a tell on what they think employment is going to look like this year. .68 might signal a v shaped recovery.
"You really have to evaluate the company based on total market cap possibilities. Currently valued at $1.2 Billion. I see a quick move to $5 Billion once the new products are approved which will happen sometime this year, perhaps in the next 30 days on 721. Then once the market opportunity of that offering and the others in the pipeline it will double from there at $10 Billion. That would put the stock price at over $200. So the answer to your question is yes.... Really don't see how this does not happen. The short position will cause a very sharp move quickly and then things well settle out and move based on normal fundamentals. There is no short story anymore. I would not want to be in a short position on this stock. The shorts have 19.45 % of the float sold short, while IBD has changed OMER's rank in it's group to 76th place. This is down from 164th and 90 until recently. OMER is worth a look."
"Interest rates heading higher. 10 year going to 1.5% short term. 2% by early summer. Positive for Payx. Jobs coming back, positive. Let's hope for north of $100 by April/may."
Higher rates = more money for Paychex.
"PAYCHEX, if you're listening, I hope you can find the missing dividend announcement."
"Why is this down after the private job number release, coming off earnings beat? no love"
split split split....like the good ol' days!!
PAYX price target raised by Deutsche Bank from $81 to $98
73 to 61 how does that happen
seems lower unemployment means mo $ for Paycheck
performing beyond my expectations
Moved way up in Valuelines dividend port
I got out this week. Payx was 1 of my 1st DRIP stocks. Invested $2100 in the late 90's and early 00's. Sold all shares for 15k.
"Well, now that we have the $2B federal bill it should give small and medium small businesses the ability to stay open and keep paying their employees. New tracking will be needed to prove that these companies have kept employees on the payroll in order to get forgiveness for the federal assistance. So, in comes PAYX. It should actually be up today. It is taking a beating and should not be getting it."
over target ready to push higher
PAYX reached a 52 Week low at 53.90
target 60
"A break of 70.39 could move it up to 82.22 in short term. Chart looks solid, according to foxchart."
"Classic pattern. Run up to dividend, pay the dividend and then sell off."
PAYX is down 11.11% to 63.61
We did receive a 12% increase of $.06 per quarter. Great news!!!!!
sure would be nice if they would split like olden days. give smaller investor's a chance to buy in.
will this ever split again?

are we going to see a dividend?
how was their earning report ??
What’s up with the after hours profit taking ?
"Low price, great dividend and steady as she goes = good stock to buy and hold."
Has to be a buy at these levels now. Nice pullback!
PAYX reached a 52 Week low at 72.36
Why is this stock down today???
PAYX reached a 52 Week low at 68.71
Let's take out the 52 week high.... over $110 by end of July!
What No dividend in May ?
adding on any correction..tax bill is going to drive this up
Let's best earnings and push this over $100. I would guess a 3 for 1 stock split gets announced at some point soon if we go over $100.
"what is the all time closing high? Did we just hit that? If so, very positive. Should also increase the dividend for the next payout after this one on the 15th."
"After further analysis, today's quarterly number were a small beat, not blowout numbers. PE ratio is still high compared to the growth rates. Any stock price decline toward $80 should be viewed as a trading opportunity. Paychex is a solid steady growth company, with good dividends. All IMHO"
"If the robots will take all the jobs, who are they make a paycheck for ?"
"This is my largest holding at 6.6% of my equity portfolio. Bought it in 2013. There are only two equities I have held longer. Prior to this year there were others, but they were sold into the rampaging bull market. This one is a steady Eddie."
Up nice a day before earnings. Hopefully a beat is in store.
PAYX reached an all time high at 83.47
Another 52 week high!!!
Record high!
Another all time high. let's get over $115!!!! I'm guessing split announcement at the annual meeting in October.
As states open up and people get back to work especially small business this stock should climb
Gearing up to take a run at $100. We could break through at earnings coming up and not look back to the double digits unless a split happens.
Interest rates hikes + corporate tax cuts = increased profits
"After multi-year hold, soldout $80.01 at today's close, as PAYX finally reached my price target. I was married to the stock, hurt badly to sell, plus now a bunch of income taxes. Tomorrow morning I will likely regret this decision. Good luck to each of you."
"Could someone explain why PAYX has recovered from $59 to $68 in such a brief timeline? I'm aware of the recent dividend increase, but Revenues and EPS aren't rising very dramatically. Several analyst price targets have been exceeded at $68. Explanations appreciated, TIA."
73 to 63 in less then 3 months
Looks like basing around $90 levels. Holding great in this pandemic time.
let's push through and closer above 90.
"Rather than an acquirer, could Paychex become a buyout target ?"

we have not yet achieve full employment by powellwhy does this stock trading at almost ath?
full employment past PAYX so where is the growth for this company?
12% to 25%
how about splitting so that the common people can buy this great company. like you did when you first started out.
"Congratulations to each of you who held. In hindsight, after many years of holding, I should not have bailed at $80.01. I believed the stock price had peaked. Plus, capital gains taxes definitely makes you take a serious step backwards, especially when you get nailed for that ridiculous unfair ObamaCare 'investment tax' add-on. .Again, best of financial success to all, always. For now, I'm dropping off this message board. Thanks everyone for excellent shared information over the past."
"Splits adjusted, PAYX traded at 10 pennies in 1985 with a dividend under 1 penny. Would it be safe to say Paychex has a history of long-term growth success? It is getting close to that time for another 3:2 stock split. Thank you Paychex management and employees across America! "
New inter day high for year today
"I think they are going to announce a 2 for 1 split at the October shareholders meeting. they used to do 3 for 2, but I don't think this every got this high."
"These boards are FULL of spammers, with their links to hottip, otc, and all the rest. YAHOO STOP THIS GARBAGE!"
"Wow!! Blowout earnings. Earnings up over 10% for every segment. This company is a growth company again. Strong buy. I'm turning on my drip again. This is turning into Microsoft. Didn't do anything for 10 years, paid a great dividend, and is now a growth company again. $100 stock by April/May. Congrats longs!!"
"Not a good reaction to earnings. Not surprising, nothing really positive, or negative for that matter Had a nice run up. Normal sell off. Should have announced a split, would have been green. Hopefully a good conference call. Higher rates and higher employment will all be positive going forward."
"I just Chuckle, article on Paycom in the WSJ on their CEO being highest paid, goes on to talk about ADP and Paycom and how Great they are. No mention of Paychex and their Amazing Growth Rate over the years til the Covid interruption. Fine with me I'll keep my PAYX and it's Great Growth and Dividend resuming again!"
PAYX is down 6.19% to 70.06
"One month ago on this chat board, I stated my price targets for my 2 largest holdings - PAYX $80 BA $450 Awesome - definitely now within striking distance! GLTA"
What's with the 5% tank on PAYX the past few days. Just a week a go it hit its record high. (Or did I just answer my own question? )
"Wondering if I should turn on dividend reinvestment again here, or take that money and invest in a total stock market ETF? It's up there in price, but beating earnings again and growing. Any thoughts?"
