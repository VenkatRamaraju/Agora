We kissed $100. Good earnings we blow way through it. I also think they announce a split with earnings.
"With the pandemic slowing down and more ate getting their vaccines, the employment will raise and payroll will increase with it. A win win for Paycheck. Dividend increase is very possible this fall."
"PAYCHEX, if you're listening, I hope you can find the missing dividend announcement."
Nice breakout over $120. Congrats Longs! Dividend next month.
"PAYX needs to start thinking of a total package with small businesses. They could have easily been Square. One stop shop. Fintech, payments, etc. Long term holder since the 90's. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon reinvented themselves and created new products with the times. I can actually see this getting acquired by someone like Buffet. I would rather have them roll out profitable me products and have a larger market cap."
Do not let minor price fluctuations deter you from staying long on the this great American company. No debt + rising interest rates + diversified product offer + 3% dividend yield = Excellent long term investment.
Solid management team proves themselves once again.
"Revenues and EPS - slight beat, steady growth company, solid leadership, nice dividends"

"I just Chuckle, article on Paycom in the WSJ on their CEO being highest paid, goes on to talk about ADP and Paycom and how Great they are. No mention of Paychex and their Amazing Growth Rate over the years til the Covid interruption. Fine with me I'll keep my PAYX and it's Great Growth and Dividend resuming again!"
Paychex reached an all time high at 123.75
Beat top and bottom line...raised guidance..and it’s down...tough market
Another all time high. let's get over $115!!!! I'm guessing split announcement at the annual meeting in October.
"Could someone explain why PAYX has recovered from $59 to $68 in such a brief timeline? I'm aware of the recent dividend increase, but Revenues and EPS aren't rising very dramatically. Several analyst price targets have been exceeded at $68. Explanations appreciated, TIA."
"Interest rates heading higher. 10 year going to 1.5% short term. 2% by early summer. Positive for Payx. Jobs coming back, positive. Let's hope for north of $100 by April/may."
"Splits adjusted, PAYX traded at 10 pennies in 1985 with a dividend under 1 penny. Would it be safe to say Paychex has a history of long-term growth success? It is getting close to that time for another 3:2 stock split. Thank you Paychex management and employees across America! "
"If this beats tomorrow and they announce dividend increase plus stock split, this thing could jump 5%-10% in a hurry."
As states open up and people get back to work especially small business this stock should climb
Boom! Great earnings…..higher interest rates also bode well on payroll funds held
We received a 6% increase in dividends from $.62 to $.66 per quarter I'm A very happy stockholder!
"Paychex Inc. acquired Oasis Outsourcing Acquisition Corp. for $1.2 billion in cash. The deal expands PAYX footprint in HR outsourcing. Oasis, which is closely held, provides human-resources and employee-benefits services for small to medium-size firms."
"Great numbers. Congrats once again, Longs. Let's take out that $100 level and make that the floor. I believe they always announced their splits in Feb/March in the past if I remember correctly. 3/2 will not cut it this time, too high. I'm thinking a 3 for 1."
New 52 week high! Congrats Longs!
Paychex reached an all time high at 121.43

Moving closer to that $120 level...All time highs along the way. Congrats Longs! Dividend dropping soon.
Should I buy this before earning for short gain?..any advise
"This is my largest holding at 6.6% of my equity portfolio. Bought it in 2013. There are only two equities I have held longer. Prior to this year there were others, but they were sold into the rampaging bull market. This one is a steady Eddie."
New 52 week high today. Congrats fellow Longs!!!
Owned this company for years - only wish I owed much more- years after year reinvesting dividends - my holdings and value consistently increasing - ONE OF THE BEST stocks I’ve owned in 3o yrs of investing.GL
Is the ex-date 2/14/19? Zacks and Morningstar have last Ex date of 1/31/19. Even Nasdax shows January 31 not Feb 14. Total is showing wrong ex date on Yahoo. Be warned. Need to double check these dates before purchase.
Let's best earnings and push this over $100. I would guess a 3 for 1 stock split gets announced at some point soon if we go over $100.
"One month ago on this chat board, I stated my price targets for my 2 largest holdings - PAYX $80 BA $450 Awesome - definitely now within striking distance! GLTA"
dropping for weeks. where are the posts?
"After multi-year hold, soldout $80.01 at today's close, as PAYX finally reached my price target. I was married to the stock, hurt badly to sell, plus now a bunch of income taxes. Tomorrow morning I will likely regret this decision. Good luck to each of you."
Where's our dividend statement???
"Soldout prior to last quarterly report at $80.01, after years of holding. Missed out on the entire (overvalued?) runup to $88. To those of you who cashed in after me for $83-$88, congratulations. I'm prepared to repurchase, as I still like PAYX, but believe it is NOT a bargain buy in the $80s. I'll stick with my valuation convictions and consider a repurchase when this falls back down below $75/share. JMHO"
I got out this week. Payx was 1 of my 1st DRIP stocks. Invested $2100 in the late 90's and early 00's. Sold all shares for 15k.
"PAYX is an excellent stock for the value dividend growth investor. No long term debt, diversified product offering, excellent management, prudent acquisition strategy, and great dividend that yields north of 3%. Stay long on this great American company."
will this ever split again?
