great timing off to the races by May this will be
holding up pretty well
"Classic pattern. Run up to dividend, pay the dividend and then sell off."
We kissed $100. Good earnings we blow way through it. I also think they announce a split with earnings.
PAYX is down -100.00% to 0.00
"If this beats tomorrow and they announce dividend increase plus stock split, this thing could jump 5%-10% in a hurry."
Anybody playing earnings??
Beat top and bottom line...raised guidance..and it’s down...tough market
are we going to see a dividend?
dropping for weeks. where are the posts?
"With the pandemic slowing down and more ate getting their vaccines, the employment will raise and payroll will increase with it. A win win for Paycheck. Dividend increase is very possible this fall."
"Not a good reaction to earnings. Not surprising, nothing really positive, or negative for that matter Had a nice run up. Normal sell off. Should have announced a split, would have been green. Hopefully a good conference call. Higher rates and higher employment will all be positive going forward."
added to Valuelines Div Portfolio sometime ago. I would add if BA wasn't so good.
I hope the dividend reinvest happens at the end of the day....
"Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare syndrome of hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and renal insufficiency. Genetic mutations in the alternate pathway of complement are well recognized as the cause in more than 60% of patients affected by this thrombotic microangiopathy. The identification of aHUS as a disease of the alternate pathway of complement enables directed therapeutic intervention both in the acute and chronic setting and may include one or all of the following: plasma therapy, complement blockade, and liver transplantation. Because aHUS shares many of the presenting characteristics of the other thrombotic microangiopathies, and confirmatory genetic results are not available at the time of presentation, the diagnosis relies heavily on the recognition of a clinical syndrome consistent with the diagnosis in the absence of signs of an alternate cause of thrombotic microangiopathy. Limited understanding of the epidemiology, genetics, and clinical features of aHUS has the potential to delay diagnosis and treatment. To advance our understanding, a more complete characterization of the unique phenotypical features of aHUS is needed. Further studies to identify additional genetic loci for aHUS and more robust biomarkers of both active and quiescent disease are required. Advances in these areas will undoubtedly improve the care of patients with aHUS."
"This is my largest holding at 6.6% of my equity portfolio. Bought it in 2013. There are only two equities I have held longer. Prior to this year there were others, but they were sold into the rampaging bull market. This one is a steady Eddie."
"Very unusual high volume (>10,000) in PAYX Jul 19 calls. Stock is even and this call is up about 30%."
full employment past PAYX so where is the growth for this company?
"PAYX needs to start thinking of a total package with small businesses. They could have easily been Square. One stop shop. Fintech, payments, etc. Long term holder since the 90's. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon reinvented themselves and created new products with the times. I can actually see this getting acquired by someone like Buffet. I would rather have them roll out profitable me products and have a larger market cap."
73 to 61 how does that happen

Owned this company for years - only wish I owed much more- years after year reinvesting dividends - my holdings and value consistently increasing - ONE OF THE BEST stocks I’ve owned in 3o yrs of investing.GL
we need a new target
"Great numbers. Congrats once again, Longs. Let's take out that $100 level and make that the floor. I believe they always announced their splits in Feb/March in the past if I remember correctly. 3/2 will not cut it this time, too high. I'm thinking a 3 for 1."
wheres an upgrade? one would think 12% rise in div
"The earnings miss is bad because the price was rather inflated already. I've always liked this company, but it's overvalued, it's PE too high based on potential earnings. I'd buy more at $60, but think of it as a hold at this high price. About all you can get from it at this price is the dividend until its earnings catch up to this lofty valuation. It holds little value for new investments."
"52 Week High! Congrats longs. I still can't believe it in this environment, but I love it! $100 SOON!!!"
"$85 - very impressive pricing power, especially considering insiders have been selling option shares."
Any chance this stock will increase its dividend?
Why can’t this stock go over 73?
looking at Valueline Div portfolio this is rated as high as Boeing WM MCD and MRK but the highest pe of the lot at 29.
Boom! Great earnings…..higher interest rates also bode well on payroll funds held
Div raised to .62/Q

Awesome timing announcing $400M stock repurchase along with the dividend. Paychex leadership team rocks! CEO - agree?
"Congratulations to each of you who held. In hindsight, after many years of holding, I should not have bailed at $80.01. I believed the stock price had peaked. Plus, capital gains taxes definitely makes you take a serious step backwards, especially when you get nailed for that ridiculous unfair ObamaCare 'investment tax' add-on. .Again, best of financial success to all, always. For now, I'm dropping off this message board. Thanks everyone for excellent shared information over the past."
Great quarter. Trump could derail this with his push for lower interest rates. Jobs slowing because his trade war.
Must be up on the dividend reinvest.
"Revenues and EPS - slight beat, steady growth company, solid leadership, nice dividends"
"After further analysis, today's quarterly number were a small beat, not blowout numbers. PE ratio is still high compared to the growth rates. Any stock price decline toward $80 should be viewed as a trading opportunity. Paychex is a solid steady growth company, with good dividends. All IMHO"

how about splitting so that the common people can buy this great company. like you did when you first started out.
Still like it even up here
We received a 6% increase in dividends from $.62 to $.66 per quarter I'm A very happy stockholder!
"Big job numbers, higher interest rates. Why is this down? They need to buyback more shares or raise the dividend."
"Well, now that we have the $2B federal bill it should give small and medium small businesses the ability to stay open and keep paying their employees. New tracking will be needed to prove that these companies have kept employees on the payroll in order to get forgiveness for the federal assistance. So, in comes PAYX. It should actually be up today. It is taking a beating and should not be getting it."
Up nice a day before earnings. Hopefully a beat is in store.
"These boards are FULL of spammers, with their links to hottip, otc, and all the rest. YAHOO STOP THIS GARBAGE!"
Don’t understand beat expectation and up early on but down at the end of the day
"Smart acquisitions, firing on all cylinders. Great dividend for a growth company. Secret can't stay hidden for long. This should be paying just over a 1% dividend.... at a price of $130+ next year."
New 52 week high today. Congrats fellow Longs!!!
Got my dividend!!!
Moving closer to that $120 level...All time highs along the way. Congrats Longs! Dividend dropping soon.
7% qtrly revenue growth
"Soldout prior to last quarterly report at $80.01, after years of holding. Missed out on the entire (overvalued?) runup to $88. To those of you who cashed in after me for $83-$88, congratulations. I'm prepared to repurchase, as I still like PAYX, but believe it is NOT a bargain buy in the $80s. I'll stick with my valuation convictions and consider a repurchase when this falls back down below $75/share. JMHO"
Interest rates hikes + corporate tax cuts = increased profits
As I said one month ago PAYX is basing at $90. And it’s did it. Now fighting for all time high.
"Let's have a pullback before dividend, then a surge. I just want a good price on my Divi reinvestment."
Why isn’t it holding the high it reached today?Profit taking???
I got out this week. Payx was 1 of my 1st DRIP stocks. Invested $2100 in the late 90's and early 00's. Sold all shares for 15k.
how was their earning report ??
Are we going to $90?

"Reports and beats, no mention on CNBC? Higher interest rates = more money. Investment income up 25%. More hikes to come."
Xdiv 5/14 - .62. First time in a long time that they haven’t done an annual dividend increase. Not a good sign. But at least it’s not a cut. 3.7 yield ain’t so bad.
Anyone go to the Shareholder meeting this year? Anything to share? I didn't get any info on this. Thanks!
"For the short term, the technical indicators such as the MACD and the 20 and 40 day exponential moving average have been pointing to a price decrease for some time. It appears that the technical indicators have won out at least for the short term."
Some may recall I called for a pause of the dividend about 2 years ago to buy back stock with the promise of a special dividend at the end. We would be at $150 right now.
I started listening ULTIMATSTOKC ALERTS and their suggestions are incredible .
"Not sure I am an ""expert in CNS diseases"" as you say, but one of my past students is a Chair in Neurology at a major midwest medical school and my bud Cliff Saper is the top Neurology Act at the Harvard Teaching Hospitals. If I cannot be an expert, at least I can give the experts a call. Now I am more of a 'jack of all trades' than an expert in any specific area. That's the dilemma of a broad-based small molecule pharmaceutical efforts. I recently re-invested in OMER, and have a small position. I am in it for the complement related nephropathy and allied efforts with OMS721. I am a big fan of this complement approach, and the data that I have seen publicly. I have been a critic of the company in the past, and I do agree there is great potential. The stock price certainly has not run away from me. I also understand that OMER needs to be more that a 1 or 2 trick pony (Omridia and the 721 efforts), and as they sometimes say in the industry ""the need to feed the [discovery and development] beast"". People with specialties need to keep working on important research areas, but this is costly. It is easy for me to be a quick critic without seeing the company's white paper and data set on the PDE7 inhibitor. I do know that PFE experts had concerns. I generally have a tough time with addictive disorders, as over eating is one such disorder and I got burned on that in a few different ways in the past. But I do know one can get burned on these addictive disorder approaches with issues as diverse as selectivity of compounds, selectivity of the precise approach without a solid understanding of the pathways/neurons involved, unexpected CNS side effects, and ultimately, the ability to have successful approvable trials for registration. This is a very tough area. I can say some of the same for Parkinson's disorders, but in addition there are some exciting clinical approaches on metabotropic glutamate receptors, so always new innovation ongoing. So, I have reason to be quite cautious, smitty, maybe overly so."
Is this likely to beat earnings??
can we get to $80?
WAY TO GO PAYCHEX !! NICE INCREASE!
Let's best earnings and push this over $100. I would guess a 3 for 1 stock split gets announced at some point soon if we go over $100.
Hold the $100 line!!
"how is this down in a day like today? market is on fire, this should have taken out it's high."
Another all time high. let's get over $115!!!! I'm guessing split announcement at the annual meeting in October.
New 52 week high! Congrats Longs!
"Repurchased some of the prior sold $80.01 shares at $79.00 today. May start short-term trading PAYX rather than buy/hold at these high levels. Appears PAYX has begun channeling, which makes for a good swing trading stock."
Isn’t it about time for them to announce the dividend? Last xdiv was 1/31. They are due for a bump. Maybe up to $.68 I should think. Maybe less if the outlook is weak. This might be a tell on what they think employment is going to look like this year. .68 might signal a v shaped recovery.
"Sidelined, but impressed. My bad. Congrats to longs."
Another record high...
"Based on the 1 year chart, it's been consolidating since May. forming a cup, just needs the handle. I expect a major breakout soon."
Let's march up and take out our 52 week high.... Let's get over $100. I think at least a 2-1 split announced next month. Perhaps a 3-1. The announcement would also get us some great attention.
This was a big unforeseen reversal after this morning. Something bad on the conference call? Hopefully a minor sell off before a push above $100.
Where's our dividend statement???

seems lower unemployment means mo $ for Paycheck

.53 eps year ago to .62 eps next qtr. BAC dwn grade concensus falling while jobs report great. target fell to 63 while its trading higher. Makes one think the market is being manipulated by the Left.
Will we see $80 this week???

We did receive a 12% increase of $.06 per quarter. Great news!!!!!
Wondering when the next 3 for 2 split is coming or even 2 for 1?
"Rather than an acquirer, could Paychex become a buyout target ?"
"Next quarter will be even better!!! Maybe another raise in the prime, which means more profit, win win for the stockholders !"
"IMO, good buy at $65"
This company has gotten a little ahead of itself. Should return back to mid 60's
Is the ex-date 2/14/19? Zacks and Morningstar have last Ex date of 1/31/19. Even Nasdax shows January 31 not Feb 14. Total is showing wrong ex date on Yahoo. Be warned. Need to double check these dates before purchase.
"Breakout, New 52 well High!!!! Let#$%$ 80!!!"
As states open up and people get back to work especially small business this stock should climb
"We did it! Congrats Longs! All time high! First time ever crossing $100! Thank you Galisano for staying this company. You're a great philanthropist, and I thank you for that as well. Have a great weekend everyone!"
Another 52 week high!!! Reminds me of the glorious 90's with this stock.
"what is the all time closing high? Did we just hit that? If so, very positive. Should also increase the dividend for the next payout after this one on the 15th."
expensive but very well managed
Let's take out $100 today!!!
performing beyond my expectations
"PAYX is an excellent stock for the value dividend growth investor. No long term debt, diversified product offering, excellent management, prudent acquisition strategy, and great dividend that yields north of 3%. Stay long on this great American company."
"Analysts aren't being overly generous, stating already fully valued, contributing to selling pressure."
Do not let minor price fluctuations deter you from staying long on the this great American company. No debt + rising interest rates + diversified product offer + 3% dividend yield = Excellent long term investment.
"Splits adjusted, PAYX traded at 10 pennies in 1985 with a dividend under 1 penny. Would it be safe to say Paychex has a history of long-term growth success? It is getting close to that time for another 3:2 stock split. Thank you Paychex management and employees across America! "

"Patients will receive an initial 12 weekly intravenous doses of study drug; additional weekly dosing can be administered for partial responders and relapsers. The primary endpoint, which could suffice for full approval, is reduction in proteinuria at 24 weeks after the start of dosing. The trial will employ an adaptive design that will allow intra-trial adjustment in sample size. For purposes of safety and efficacy assessments, the initial sample size for the proteinuria endpoint is estimated at 140 patients in each of the treatment and placebo groups. This will include a subset of patients with high levels of proteinuria (i.e., equal to or greater than 2 g/day) at baseline, and full approval could also be obtained if a substantial improvement is seen at 24 weeks in this subset of patients alone. The trial design will allow assessment for either full or accelerated approval at 24 weeks based on proteinuria results either (1) across the general population of study patients or (2) in the high-proteinuria subset of patients. In the event that the primary endpoint at 24 weeks results in accelerated approval from FDA, change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) will be assessed at approximately three years after the start of dosing. The initial sample size estimate for the eGFR endpoint is approximately 160 patients per group and also will be adjustable under the study’s adaptive design.Love PAYX but OMER will explode this week."
"Not I don't feel bad taking a little off the table at $80. I did at first when it kept climbing. However, I did turn back on my dividend reinvest. Just thought it got ahead of itself. Still love it long term."
8.9% rev gwth concensus fell to 3.0 pe fell to 24 so Iam thinking a buy opportunity lurks.
Is it true that paychecks is dropping dividends for shareholders?
"Could someone explain why PAYX has recovered from $59 to $68 in such a brief timeline? I'm aware of the recent dividend increase, but Revenues and EPS aren't rising very dramatically. Several analyst price targets have been exceeded at $68. Explanations appreciated, TIA."
Anyone adding at these levels just under $57?
Do I hear $110?
Paychex reached an all time high at 99.50
Why can’t this stock go above 86?
we have not yet achieve full employment by powellwhy does this stock trading at almost ath?
"Wow!! Blowout earnings. Earnings up over 10% for every segment. This company is a growth company again. Strong buy. I'm turning on my drip again. This is turning into Microsoft. Didn't do anything for 10 years, paid a great dividend, and is now a growth company again. $100 stock by April/May. Congrats longs!!"
"If the robots will take all the jobs, who are they make a paycheck for ?"
will this ever split again?
Will add at $90 if we get there
"The problem with Paychex is the model for customers is very annoying. We use Paychex, have approximately 200 employees and rather than build all standard reporting into the baseline cost, everything is an adder. For example, every company in the US has to do Workers Comp reporting; this worker's comp report is an ADDED FEE. That is the approach with everything. Now everyone knows, once the report is created by Paychex, they just keep rolling it out at no additional cost to Paychex. This is a huge mistake that smaller payroll companies are seizing upon. This is why after 15 years with Paychex we are exploring other companies and it is not ADP. It appears the secondary processors have outsmarted the two majors.unfortunate because changing payroll processors is a hassle."
"I still hold 1k shares of steady dividend paying PAYX. But with small business America declining due to COVID, what is driving Paychex toward its previous $90 high?"
was the conference call bad? how can this be down?
Dividend raise should be included in conference call.
What's with the 5% tank on PAYX the past few days. Just a week a go it hit its record high. (Or did I just answer my own question? )
.53 to .63 eps yoy very high expectations but why 3.0 concensus? I don't get this but remains in the Valueline Div Portfolio.
$20 off its high
Paychex reached an all time high at 96.71
Let's get back over $100 and stay there for good.
Will the job numbers on Friday effect this stock?
New all time high!!!
Came 1 penny away from hitting all time high. hopefully we do that next week.

revenue was huge .02 miss is that right?
Gearing up to take a run at $100. We could break through at earnings coming up and not look back to the double digits unless a split happens.
sure would be nice if they would split like olden days. give smaller investor's a chance to buy in.
Solid management team proves themselves once again.

"A “bear market” is when stocks see a 20 percent decline or more from a recent high — but they’re also marked by overall pessimism on Wall Street. Since World War II, bear markets have lasted, on average, 13 months while stock markets tend to lose 30.4 percent of their value.-------Not sure when this bear started, but if around Oct 4th, then we've got approximately 10 more months to go to reach 13 months."
What No dividend in May ??????
split split split....like the good ol' days!!
It always jumps right before the dividend payout.
"I just Chuckle, article on Paycom in the WSJ on their CEO being highest paid, goes on to talk about ADP and Paycom and how Great they are. No mention of Paychex and their Amazing Growth Rate over the years til the Covid interruption. Fine with me I'll keep my PAYX and it's Great Growth and Dividend resuming again!"
"With small businesses destroyed by the coronavirus (CV), the crux of Paycheck revenues are dropping rather dramatically. Further, with interest rates at 0%, Paychex ""float income"" goes to $0. This one-two punch explains why PAYX will remain way down on stock price until after the CV subsides across America. At that point in time, $50s will be viewed as a steal."
Looks like basing around $90 levels. Holding great in this pandemic time.
This IMO will be the most awesome stock to buy when we see some light at the end of the tunnel. Awesome dividend now but if it hits the 5% plus market it will be the buy of the century.
Employment soaring! Interest rates climbing and will continue to climb. Both extremely positive for Paychex
Way to Buck the trend on a bad day! Go Paychex!
Where is that dividend ?
"Wondering if I should turn on dividend reinvestment again here, or take that money and invest in a total stock market ETF? It's up there in price, but beating earnings again and growing. Any thoughts?"

In addition, he's concerned about competition, particularly in the company’s core payrolls business. The stock is down 8.7% this year, but Kupferberg said the stock’s 3.2% dividend should provide a bit of downside protection for the stock at some point.
