Idk just walked through the city. It’s a ghost town. I went to a CEOs office he’s clearing out of a floor (31k a month rent) and he showed me empty floor after empty floor all in midtown....
"Will ""work at home"" kill us?"
Repurchase? The numbers don't mke sense to me. They increased their repurchase authorization to $3.5 Billion. The entire market cap of the company now is about $4 Billion. How can this be?
Not much commentary about SLG. I wanted to own a piece of the Big Apple but this REIT has not been performing too well.
SL Green Realty is down 6.51% to 40.63
Reading the earnings call transcript Marc seems to be stressed out ranting about how work from home isn’t good for him. I think he see the work from home technology tsunami and scared $hitless
Just pulled the trigger on 250 shares. A bet against SLG is a bet against NYC. Buying SLG is like buying NYC office buildings for 1/3 of market value. Good luck!
Manhattan in 2 yrs will be back to normal. Lock in this awesome dividend and get the appreciation as well. All mass transit in NY is designed to take employees in and out of Manhattan. Companies in the suburbs would not be able to efficiently get employees. This is classic Buffett example of buying low when a stock is out of favor.

"SLG had a nice bounce from 45 to 55 after 1Q earnings. SLG's mgmt was confident in their ability to collect +86% of rents in April and May which presumably would be the most challenging months they reiterated keeping their monthly dividend $0.296 - now yielding almost 10%. Companies won't move out to the suburbs to be closer to employees, because most likely employees live in Bronx, NYC, Long Island, NJ, White Plains, CT, etc. Plus, if you understand the business the avg office lease term is 10 years. I see 36 for SLG as an incredible buy with the stable monthly dividend and marquee locations."

I bought more last week as it dipped into 60’s. I look forward to buying more as it trades to low 60’sDon’t forget one Vanderbilt is now delivering $ to bottom line. SLG has reduced debt service by transitioning 1Vanderbilt from construction loan % to lower mortgage %. Sometimes we over analysis and look gift horse in mouth missing the potential. I believe this is one of those times. Heck even if it stalls here fir a year we receive monthly checks.
Manhattan usually comes back. They just need to get rid of DeBlasio.

Manhattan always seems to come back. Will the solution to Covid -19 be to cramp more personnel in to smaller office space? Is there an advantage to having people.work from an office? Good Qs.
"SLG is a bargain, nyc will come back soon, big companies are renting office space. Slg will rebound to 80 USd minimum."
Benzinga article mentions SLG has no dividend yield??? Thats untrue and maybe why the slump in SP??
I am adding to my position of SLG. SLG has a great portfolio of commercial properties in Manhattan. Be a part of the Big Apple. Buy SLG and ED. With ED you will be in the bizness of lighting up the big city.
A bit disappointed it couldn't hold 62. Going to see 55 before 62 again.
SLG is paying out $3.64 with earnings of $4.87 - this is only 74.7%... seems like a divy payout increase is required to maintain REIT status?

Irrational exuberance. Office space may simply not be in demand the way it used to be in the coming quarters. Continued rent collection is one thing and continued rental agreements another.

Will demand for office space in Manhattan change after COVID-19? I hear a lot of bankers are planning to continue to work remotely after all this passes. Any thoughts?
O realty is another good reit to consider
The answer to Coronavirus is bigger office space so employees can have distance from each other. NOT work from home where family members contaminate each other with the Virus. The Big Apple always comes back. Remember downtown Manhattan got bombed out? Everyone thought it was finished. Then it came back booming in lightning speed!
too difficult to determine NYC office much less 1 company...And Im intimately knowledgable aout the Manhattan commercial property markets!
100k invested today. After some research I decided to go long n get the divy  pile up. Seeking alpha is supper bullish which might not be a good thing but letssss gooo!!! Shout out the Chat baby!!
Wow is this ever a hated stock. Price implies a 50% cut in dividend. Maybe that is so in the short term. But price doesn’t reflect a dividend cut If it happens won’t be permanent.

Insiders selling this month. My guess is they held off all last year and needed some honey.
"Guys, I don't think the bail out is coming with this many Republicans in congress. I don't really see how the mortgages can not go into default at this point. Biden will try, but will eventually fail. I am afraid that the bottom will fall out next year even if things open up."

"SLG...interesting play. With the shamdemic now an obvious money grab boxed in public health concerns, it is fun to play the 'who wins' game. During the AIDS upstart, NYC was re-ordered to benefit starbucks and the Gap and all the other sanitary corporate muck that poisons my life. With the panicporn, who wins as commercial real estate starts its steep decline? As usual, the guys holding the most cash to buy and either redevelop or reappropriate. My money is someone is going to angle to 'return' to the 70's and 80's but in a series of controlled red districts where corporations can now increase vice profits. It's time party again kids."

so cheap!
The smart people are buying SLG at these prices. Own a piece of the Rock. Own Manhattan Office Buildings. Be a Player.
Don't just buy SLG. Buy ED too. Light up the City.
SLG is 90 usd minimum worth. New York is the most favorable place for office space. For me a absolute strong aggressive buyer. I am adding.
It is a pearl and Manhattan always will be a good place for companies to work.For me clearly a strong buy.
How often are they paying dividends now?
"I’m in the business. Historically, re trailed the stock market by 10-12 months - good news or bad. CRE will get hit hard for the next two years, but yes nyc will come back. Also, MIDTOWN, where SLG has most of its assets, has a big lease roll over happening over the next few years, this was an issue before COVID. SLG had also been signing short term, stripped out leases with tenants to maintain cash flow, something they NEVER did. I’d hold off before getting into any nyc centric reit stock."

"I really want to invest in SLG, but I see a possible red flag with the special dividend (which I missed), boosted forward div, and the reverse split (usually done by co’s in hardship) which is due to take place on 20 Jan. Specifically, I’ll be watching of a lower forward yield if the (recently boosted) div is not adjusted in sync with the reverse split. They’re already taking the special dividend back via removing shares from the marketplace, what’s to stop them from recovering some of the boosted yield by short-changing stockholders via less payout per share after the split.I’ve learn enough being in the market 10+ yrs and this doesn’t look positive from the onset. I’m going to sit on the sidelines for now and see how the cards play out. Good Luck!"

CNBC ran an article yesterday saying SLG is a shorting opportunity.
"Is SLG just riding the cheetah's undercarriage here or is it sprinting on its own merritt? I was checking apartment prices and they are dropping only fractionally.

"I just reread SLG annual and most recent quarterly reports. Sure seems they have a handle on their business. Plans for another $600 million +/_ share buyback this year = 12% of outstandings shares. One Vanderbilt is now producing revenue V being a expense. Also, refinancing construction loans to mortgages with lower interest rates. Together, these actions reduce costs increase revenues/profits. While we are all concerned about covid & Delta, SLG is managing their premier properties pretty darn well all things considered. Sure, bumps along the way. BUT while many investors are apprehensive of NYC commercial real estate and future of cities SLG is disposing of less premier properties, refinancing, buying back shares, increasing revenue of existing properties, maximizing collections while being good citizens and supporting lots of NYC efforts.So, let others dismiss future of NYC while we benefit from this lower entry point."
