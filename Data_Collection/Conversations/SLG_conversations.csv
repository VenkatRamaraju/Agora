"Forbes: ""SLG has a 40% Upside"" https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sl-green-realty-stock-has-a-40-upside-2021-09-09"
I bought more last week as it dipped into 60’s. I look forward to buying more as it trades to low 60’sDon’t forget one Vanderbilt is now delivering $ to bottom line. SLG has reduced debt service by transitioning 1Vanderbilt from construction loan % to lower mortgage %. Sometimes we over analysis and look gift horse in mouth missing the potential. I believe this is one of those times. Heck even if it stalls here fir a year we receive monthly checks.
SLG has 40% upside- love it!Interesting article made no mention of aggressive stock buyback. That alone has potential of increasing our value. My only lament is not buying a decade ago at $12 a share.
"I really want to invest in SLG, but I see a possible red flag with the special dividend (which I missed), boosted forward div, and the reverse split (usually done by co’s in hardship) which is due to take place on 20 Jan. Specifically, I’ll be watching of a lower forward yield if the (recently boosted) div is not adjusted in sync with the reverse split. They’re already taking the special dividend back via removing shares from the marketplace, what’s to stop them from recovering some of the boosted yield by short-changing stockholders via less payout per share after the split.I’ve learn enough being in the market 10+ yrs and this doesn’t look positive from the onset. I’m going to sit on the sidelines for now and see how the cards play out. Good Luck!"
Such an annoying stock to own
"I just reread SLG annual and most recent quarterly reports. Sure seems they have a handle on their business. Plans for another $600 million +/_ share buyback this year = 12% of outstandings shares. One Vanderbilt is now producing revenue V being a expense. Also, refinancing construction loans to mortgages with lower interest rates. Together, these actions reduce costs increase revenues/profits. While we are all concerned about covid & Delta, SLG is managing their premier properties pretty darn well all things considered. Sure, bumps along the way. BUT while many investors are apprehensive of NYC commercial real estate and future of cities SLG is disposing of less premier properties, refinancing, buying back shares, increasing revenue of existing properties, maximizing collections while being good citizens and supporting lots of NYC efforts.So, let others dismiss future of NYC while we benefit from this lower entry point."
"Seeking Alpha has a new article on Sunday morning, ""2 REITs with a Definitive and Indisputable Margin of Safety"", concluding ""...we believe that the high quality of SLG’s portfolio, the eventual bounce-back of NYC’s economy, and the deep relative value that current multiples present make SLG a 'Strong Buy'."""
"THIS IS GREAT. So little conversation or coverage. SLG will continue to march forward, reducing debt, paying monthly dividends, buying back shares and leasing up all of their top tier properties. While this happens a brilliant time to increase position. I predict a year from now many will be touting SLG as a contrarian underdog that EXPLODED to the upside and has room still to run. HOWEVER, with our insight we were smart to load up now.Buy now and be rewarded every month."

"TipRanks now rates SLG a 9, on a scale of 1 to 10 (10 is the highest)."
"barring a further correction, SLG is gravitating higher. Love the divi and the game plan."
I struggle to understand why this stock is always in red
"One-hour Slow Stochastic is now down to 3.41, the lowest (i.e. most oversold) level since July 19."

New covid cases are apparently on the decline in NYC: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page#daily
I jut read this; it's pretty fair and reasonable view of SLGhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-hold-sl-green-132601763.html

"There ain't no place like NYC.The world comes to NYC for way too many reasons.The death of NYC has been reported way too many times in my life. It always comes back - stronger, grander, more dynamic; it is a unique visitor destination, biz center, and residential hub. Sure bumps along the way, but that is everywhere and with everything . However, NYC future will be fine. So, grab a 5.3% div, paid monthly while the proverbial dust settles."
Why this stock is red every day?
"SLG had a nice bounce from 45 to 55 after 1Q earnings. SLG's mgmt was confident in their ability to collect +86% of rents in April and May which presumably would be the most challenging months they reiterated keeping their monthly dividend $0.296 - now yielding almost 10%. Companies won't move out to the suburbs to be closer to employees, because most likely employees live in Bronx, NYC, Long Island, NJ, White Plains, CT, etc. Plus, if you understand the business the avg office lease term is 10 years. I see 36 for SLG as an incredible buy with the stable monthly dividend and marquee locations."
