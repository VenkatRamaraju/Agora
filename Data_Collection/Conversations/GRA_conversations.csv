"Not exactly fast moving forum here. I am an ALB investor, Grace just bought the Fine Chemistry Services division of ALB for $300M in cash and ""$270 million funded through the issuance to Albemarle of non-participating preferred equity of a newly created Grace subsidiary"".Anybody know what this ""Newly created Grace subsidiary"" is? That kind of thing doesn't normally just pop up overnight. And ALB and Grace are direct competitors in the Catalyst market, so it is somewhat interesting that they are working together on something - it must not be a core part of either's business or they wouldn't share to such a close competitor. My guess is some kind of ESG activity, like a recycling venture or such..."
Why was this 1.50 back in 2000 or so?

This company is a joke! They have changed the name of their Technical Center to Process Innovation Center for the past two years and haven't done anything innovative so far....the leader of the innovative Center does nothing but talk a good talk. He has no clue about Innovation. This company is stuck in the mud!

"It is time for Hudson LaForce to leave Grace. I went to high school with this guy at Westchester Sr. High in Houston, TX and when I met him at his meet and greet when he joined Grace and he pretended to not not remember me. Well I am the person who stole your girlfriend. Well. you have been ripping off Grace for so long, hit the road Jack everyone at Grace things you are one goofy person. The previous employment contracts of upper management that paid big bucks for bolt on acquisition that increased top line growth without increase if profitability were horrible. Greg Poling had such of a contract and he was the biggest jerk I ever worked for. He used people and threw them away when they could not help him anymore. I had another job when I left Grace and with the package I bought a new BMW. There are still a lot of good people at Grace and I hope the new management recognizes the talent that they still have."

"Brown Elizabeth C, Sr. VP and CHRO of W R GRACE & CO bought 2000 shares on 2020-05-11. https://formwhispers.com/s?t=GRA"
What nonsense is going on here. This is BULLISH $cdxc and BEARISH EH. I wouldn’t be surprised if their advisory board starts walking away. This validated that $cdxc owns the IP for NAD+ and that $GRA owns the IP to manufacture it for $CDXC. This suit is likely going to put EH out of business which will likely increase $CDXC’s customer base and therefore their revs. The biggest non-obvious benefit to $CDXC is that $GRA is doing this for a reason. Their current profits along with their future growth beliefs has them willing to pay million of dollars to protect their IP. $CDXC is going to the moon. Not only will EH go bust but all the people they have told to short the stock will be screwed.

The guys who oversaw a halving of the stock price say $60 is inadequate. They just want to keep their bloated comp packages safe.

Does anyone believe the BOD and execs will take this offer to the shareholders? They’re all sitting around with big paychecks for running it into the ground. Doubt they’re giving those up
