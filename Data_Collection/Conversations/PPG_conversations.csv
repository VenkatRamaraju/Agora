"A six percent dividend increase, not bad. Payable 11 Sep, record 10 Aug."
"Surprised with upward move this morning, doubt it lasting"
Just shorted 300 shares @ 172. This is too much need to come down to $ 165 will cover at $ 165 than go long.
PPG is up 5.38% to $103.04
$134-$135 next?
It’s now time for McGarry to show some leadership and address PPG’s reaction to its market collapse that’s far in excess of the overall market and SHW.
Does anybody feel PPG is over paying for Tikkurila. Their current bid is around 40% higher than the original bid. I believe it’s at a higher valuation than current PPG stock ( price/sales)
Bad luck or bad management . Stock was just downgraded at Jeffries citing supply chain pricing squeeze and out of favor financial engineering per share growth tactics. IMHO Major issues since McGarry took over: Failed bid for Akzo Nobel; loss of Lowes distribution; and internal accounting issues. Why has he been given outsized compensation advancements could be an indication of an ineffective BOD. Time for leadership and the BOD to right the ship or find folks who can. Also IMHO If they fail to significantly raise the dividend next quarter McGarry and the management team should receive no bonuses this year and perhaps have their 2017 bonuses clawed back. Lastly perhaps all RSUs programs should be suspended until the stock performs in the top quintile relative to the S&P 500. Starting from the time McGarry became CEO!
PPG is down -4.92% to 100.89
PPG is down 8.72% to $100.02
Thinking PPG needs to raise their dividend between 10-14% to be aligned with the comp increase given McGarry. This will demonstrate the organization is aligned with shareholders and not simply a vehicle to enrich senior management . I'd be willing to wager comp and benefits overall to employees was less that the % given the CEO. As stated in the 2018 proxy the stock performance ranked at about the 31st percentile relative to the S&P 500. When I went to school 30% was considered an F and would likely be told to change majors. Wonder when McGarry will next visit Cramer!
"This will fly today, Mark my words!"
Does PPG have any scheduled presentations before their next earnings call?
$200 by EOY
"Can anyone explain why this company has sales and administrative (SGA) expenses that are 24% of revenue? That is the highest percentage that I have seen in any manufacturing company. Most chemical/material firms have SGA expenses in the 10% range. What do these guys do that requires so much SGA expense. Just seems to me that this company isn't run very efficiently, but maybe I am missing something."
Has Q3 been even worse than currently expected ?
"going to 60""sssssssssssssssssssss"
Nice 6% dividend increase. I won’t complain about that.
Anyone have an opinion why this company has so dramatically underperformed SHW. Is it a leadership or vision issue ?
The stock is now in bear territory . My suspicion is that the relentless selling will continue until the end of the quarter. Institutions may not want this stock on their end of quarter portfolios. Come October it may reach its bottom unless McGarry makes some type of positive statement before then .
this stock gave such a dismal projection it won't surprise me if it goes down to 50. thanks to the CEO guidance.
Stock getting pricey with unemployment still a major problem for a V recovery?
Nice presentation published September. Unfortunately next to zero current or near term future financials. Path to commercialization and economic expectations sorely missing. Hope they present more future near term financial expectations at the earnings call.
Let’s hope all ppg senior management bonuses go to ZERO this year.
Anyone here think the current management is under pressure to take aggressive action due to extreme underperformance ( relative to the overall market) since McGarry became CEO. Is Trian looking for board representation?
PPG is up 5.72% to 146.70
"Have to own the stock August 6th to get the new, increased dividend."
Almost in bear territory from recent high.
PPG is off about 20% from its high and SHW off about 5% from its high. Does McGarry have an explanation for this discrepancy?
Seems at there is another law firm commenting on class action against this company every couple of hours. Wonder if this is triggering algorithmic trading as the stock price also seems to negatively react each time there's a news release plus Cramer slammed the company due to this issue after recently touting it. On the other hand it could simply be little confidence in the current management team to deliver financial results. McGarry should comment on the overall response to all these lawsuits as well as raise the dividend this week as many are expecting.
Looks like Liebert walked into a hornets nest at PPG automotive finishes. It will be interesting to see if she can fix the problems inherited from her predecessors at PPG. She’ll need to react much more quickly than the glacial pace of the past several years.
"If McGarry were smart he’d bring back Bunch in a direct report executive consulting role coupled with a seat on the board. Also he should offer up an additional seat or two to Trian providing line of sight to internal activities and challenges. I understand the need to investigate non performance the past three years but not the idea of breaking up the company. Trian needs to provide some detailed, non pixie dust, analysis that proves this is good for shareholders. Too many synergies exist between all the current operations as well as Moody’s debt downgrade at a time of rising interest rates. That said McGarry has not done a good job, moving much too slowly to address their business issues as well as an ill advised and distracting takeover attempt of Akzo. Not to mention loss of accounting control."
figure im safe buying ppg and it drop 4% in one day no buyers 53.5 to 47 straight down but i think it will go back up before earnings i watch people dump ppg and i wonder why why why
McGarry needs to open his mouth and describe the immediate steps he’s taking to address the inability of his team to understand their customers and suppliers. I imagine his phone is ringing off the hook with institutional stock holders not happy with his leadership.
This company has been mentioned in the financial news more in the past two days than in the past 2 years. Did Bunch just leave at an opportune time or is McGarry in over his head. IMHO recent management issues:Failed Akzo takeoverLoss of Lowes businessAccounting misstepsMajor earnings misses What has McGarry accomplished since he became CEO?
"Bought 500 more shares today.Added to my GPK, position too."
PPG stock will be in bear territory if it hit $146 & change. Does anyone thinks it hits this level?
"Well, I figure it's a 9.26% bump, but I'll allow a touch of hyperbole:PPG announced that its board has approved an increase in its quarterly shareholder dividend by 10% or 5 cents per share. This brings the quarterly dividend payout to 59 cents per share from the prior figure of 54 cents. The increased dividend will be payable on Sep 10, 2021, to shareholders of record as of Aug 10, 2021."
PPG is up 4.99% to 120.21
Is this a broken stock or company. It's massively underperformed the major indices the past 3 years while outperforming the previous ~7 years. Is this simply a regression to the mean or something in their ability to keep up with the economy.
Anybody think McGarry should announce a stock buy back. Seems the selling in this name is relentless.
Hopefully today marks the quarter end and the relentless selling of this stock with the institutions that may be reducing / eliminating their positions finished. Also hoping McGarry can provide positive commentary at the company’s next public communication. It’s been a long while since his comments have been a net plus.
Seems SHW is growing sales at a far faster rate than PPG. Has anybody asked McGarry why PPG lags SHW’s growth.
5 year chart seems to be coiling like DIS earlier last month. What's the bullish catalyst for PPG on the horizon?
PPG going bankrupt.. https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/pge-says-on-track-for-bankruptcy-court-confirmation-of-reorganization-plan-2020-05-01
Bringing in Rebecca Liebert is great news. Her record at Honeywell was very strong.
"bit expensive, low dividend, good cash management tho"
Still thinking the selling will continue through the end of the quarter. Institutional holders may not want this poor performer in their end of Q portfolios. The past several communications from management have been negative starting with the Q2 earnings report . I think management needs to better explain their inability to raise prices concurrent with rising input costs. If they lack this ability the company may be poorly situated in the supply chain of their end product.
Looks to me like things are just fine at PPG. Going to hold my shares. Haven’t been to a shareholder meeting in a few years since Bunch was CEO. Maybe I’ll go this year. They had a pretty good spread laid out last time!
Is it time for McGarry to open his mouth and comment on the coronavirus’ impact on PPG operations ?
Anybody else here think it’s time for McGarry to provide an update on the accounting issues facing the company. At least provide an expected time line for quantifying and/or resolving this.
"Internal controls review is now complete without any major undesirable findings. Now the management team needs to deliver on increasing profits not debt. Debt was up about 1 Billion Q1 2018 over Q1 2017 ( +~ 25%) and earnings were flat , below GDP growth. Q2 performance will now be key to understanding the capabilities of the current management. The underlying GDP is strong and so should PPG’s earnings or the management team needs to be adjusted not just talk about “right sizing” headcount of the “worker bees”"
Interesting exercise: Overlay S&P 500 average with PPG stock since McGarry became CEO. Not a pretty picture for PGG stockholders. Why do you think this has happened?
Raised dividend. Raising prices.
Is something wrong with the company or just the stock. Wondering if the August closing was disappointing.
Looks like McGarry has screwed up another M&A attempt.

Doesn’t seem the market is enthralled with PPG’s current spending spree.
Train dumped shares for a reason.
Seems as if the market doesn’t consider the Tikkurila purchase a positive. Time for McGarry to make the case ( with numbers) in front of shareholders.
PPG reached a new All Time High at 121.14
Thinking McGarry needs to massively improve investor relations. True underlying volume growth seems to be sub world-wide GDP. Stock performance since he has been running the ship has been sub average. This accounting issue needs to be addressed and a time frame for doing so must be communicated to shareholders.
Shares under much pressure this AM in the face of an overall major market updraft. Is this an indication of some leaked problem with Q2 or an algorithmic end of quarter trading attack. Still think McGarry needs to raise the dividend. Also the upcoming Mexican elections could place PPG’s COMEX assets at risk.
Looks like an activist is becoming McGarry's newest problem.
"Due to a substantial surge in destruction of property(over $2B in Minneapolis alone) cause by George Floyd riots, PPG and other Restoration, Glass manufactures, hardware suppliers, Etc. will benefit greatly. I predict PPG to rise another 15 to 20 percent by the end of the month."
Is it time for McGarry to go? He’s done nothing since becoming CEO.
Cramer selling today......................
After hours is up 66%
Are we at a buy point?
Volume coming in. Bullish indication at stoxline. Looking for breakout at 108.73 for a run up to 126.99.
Anybody else here feel McGarry is clone of Vince Sarni. Remember the move into Ag chemicals and medical.
It appears we will have to wait until October 20th to see the damage. Note the stock price has now declined year to date … not the case with SHW. Hope McGarry has some answers.
"Wonder if announcing ,at this time, the construction of an R&D center in China is the wisest move considering current trade tensions."
"Does anyone else here believe McGarry needs to comment on the poor ,relative to its peers , stock performance . Are institutional investors applying any pressure. Thinking more corporate communication is called for between quarterly calls."
Did I understand correctly PPG borrowed money at about 3.6% to buy back stock that paid about 1.7% dividend? All in the name of engineering increased EPS. Seems the market at the moment strongly disagrees PPG’s business fundamentals. Every even little tick up in share price is met with immediate selling pressure. Looks like many want out and are looking for any opportunity to sell. Continually taking charges to cut costs isn’t a sustainable path to business success .
Is the current uptick coming from PPG Treasury buyback activity?
PPG reached a new 52 Week Low at $99.35
Stock market crash starts today......Biden will take it to new LOWS.......
3 for 2 split ????
Why has PPG stock massively underperformed SHW since McGarry became CEO? Perhaps they’re a little too Woke and have taken their eye of the ball .
