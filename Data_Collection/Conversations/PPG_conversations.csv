PPG stock will be in bear territory if it hit $146 & change. Does anyone thinks it hits this level?
Hopefully today marks the quarter end and the relentless selling of this stock with the institutions that may be reducing / eliminating their positions finished. Also hoping McGarry can provide positive commentary at the company’s next public communication. It’s been a long while since his comments have been a net plus.
Does PPG have any scheduled presentations before their next earnings call?
Anybody else here feel McGarry is clone of Vince Sarni. Remember the move into Ag chemicals and medical.
Is something wrong with the company or just the stock. Wondering if the August closing was disappointing.
It appears we will have to wait until October 20th to see the damage. Note the stock price has now declined year to date … not the case with SHW. Hope McGarry has some answers.
Anybody think McGarry should announce a stock buy back. Seems the selling in this name is relentless.
Let’s hope all ppg senior management bonuses go to ZERO this year.
Nice 6% dividend increase. I won’t complain about that.

Still thinking the selling will continue through the end of the quarter. Institutional holders may not want this poor performer in their end of Q portfolios. The past several communications from management have been negative starting with the Q2 earnings report . I think management needs to better explain their inability to raise prices concurrent with rising input costs. If they lack this ability the company may be poorly situated in the supply chain of their end product.
$134-$135 next?
Why has PPG stock massively underperformed SHW since McGarry became CEO? Perhaps they’re a little too Woke and have taken their eye of the ball .
McGarry needs to open his mouth and describe the immediate steps he’s taking to address the inability of his team to understand their customers and suppliers. I imagine his phone is ringing off the hook with institutional stock holders not happy with his leadership.
The stock is now in bear territory . My suspicion is that the relentless selling will continue until the end of the quarter. Institutions may not want this stock on their end of quarter portfolios. Come October it may reach its bottom unless McGarry makes some type of positive statement before then .
At least McGarry announced the resumption of stock buy backs recognizing their underperformance the past year .
Looks like massive unrelentingly selling hit this stock around midday. Perhaps McGarry’s appearance on CNBC wasn’t well received.
More bad news from McGarry.Hope he has something positive to say during the conference call.
PPG is off about 20% from its high and SHW off about 5% from its high. Does McGarry have an explanation for this discrepancy?
Nice presentation published September. Unfortunately next to zero current or near term future financials. Path to commercialization and economic expectations sorely missing. Hope they present more future near term financial expectations at the earnings call.
