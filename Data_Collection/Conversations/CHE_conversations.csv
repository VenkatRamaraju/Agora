Chemed has moved up on better than average volume--I wonder what is going on? I think it is time for Chemed to split. What do you think about it?
"Hmmm, numbers don't look great. Also don't like that they ended the quarter with only $9 million in cash."

"Not a great quarter. 9 cents short of earnings estimates on revenues 4m short of consensus. Full year guidance is still in line, but overall I expect the market to be disappointed."

Solid Q3 results.

The short covering this morning was merely a dress rehearsal for the 8k which announces the DOJ settlement

"So - so numbers for Q4 but at least no missteps. I'll be looking to see how much Medicare Cap exposure will be sandbagged into 2017 guidance. More importantly, the DOJ arbitration may now fall under one of the perverse Trump plays...provide a catalyst for the short covering which still is almost 10%. The continued stock buyback is the best use of capital so let's hope Cinci doesn't get any bright ideas. BTW the standard response of Cinci regarding a spin-off of RR is the adverse tax consequences. Perhaps another potential Trump play next year?"
Chemed is up 5.18% to 470.15
The recent sell off in CHE was attributable mostly to the COVID virus limiting new applicants to nursing home enrollment. That should change very soon!
Will this stock suffer under Democratic President?

"Well it appears that we've got the classical street over-reaction to a de minimis revenue blip. The demand for hospice and plumbing services is fundamentally inelastic, thus justifying a PE similar to consumer non-cyclical. Revenue is not tied to the Fed rate, China tariffs, nor politics since hospice rates are set for the not-for-profits who will not survive any serious budget cuts....a perfect moat. I do worry when the brainiacs in Cinci decide to do an acquisition, but a Roto Rooter franchise over-valuation isn't fatal...at least they stopped buying deadbeat hospices and now only buy CHE. So for long-term investors we might be seeing a good post earnings buying opportunity right now. Remember that management always wants to get more personal shares off and so share repurchase is likely to uptick at these price levels."
"OK, can somebody tell me why this stock fell off the face of the earth in September? I cannot find anything to correlate with an 8.5% drop, seemingly overnight ($470-430 today)"
$150m buyback authorized by the Board is 5.4 days of average volume. Should support price nicely.Very happy long term holder.

Stock is moving nicely; why aren’t investors paying attention?
I still don't understand how the Board can fulfill its governance responsibilities while allowing the CEO to sell 14% of his holdings ($6mm plus) after June 20th. Way too late in the quarter...may be criminal behavior! Revenue for both segments are baked in providing way too much insider information to trade on. Other insiders selling late in the quarter led to a crowded trough which institutionalizes this pattern of late trades with insider info being available. The trading window should be closed a couple of weeks following the release of quarterly results ie. early May.

"Love it! More people staying in their homes during the pandemic, making heavier usage of their drainage systems at home: Roto-Rooter revenue rose to $175 million, an increase of 8.6%. Net Income due to Roto-Rooter (as more calls are made for sewer unclogging) climbed strongly to $32.0 million, an increase of 16.5% !"
