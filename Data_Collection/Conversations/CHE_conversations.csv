CHE reached a new All Time High at 306.59
CHE is up 4.96% to 306.59
Some days this stock makes everyone look smart ... shorts excepted
Management announced a large share buyback. This will rocket in the near future.
$150m buyback authorized by the Board is 5.4 days of average volume. Should support price nicely.Very happy long term holder.
The recent sell off in CHE was attributable mostly to the COVID virus limiting new applicants to nursing home enrollment. That should change very soon!
What is with the bearish behavior?
"OK, can somebody tell me why this stock fell off the face of the earth in September? I cannot find anything to correlate with an 8.5% drop, seemingly overnight ($470-430 today)"
"Well it appears that we've got the classical street over-reaction to a de minimis revenue blip. The demand for hospice and plumbing services is fundamentally inelastic, thus justifying a PE similar to consumer non-cyclical. Revenue is not tied to the Fed rate, China tariffs, nor politics since hospice rates are set for the not-for-profits who will not survive any serious budget cuts....a perfect moat. I do worry when the brainiacs in Cinci decide to do an acquisition, but a Roto Rooter franchise over-valuation isn't fatal...at least they stopped buying deadbeat hospices and now only buy CHE. So for long-term investors we might be seeing a good post earnings buying opportunity right now. Remember that management always wants to get more personal shares off and so share repurchase is likely to uptick at these price levels."

Solid Q3 results.

Chemed has moved up on better than average volume--I wonder what is going on? I think it is time for Chemed to split. What do you think about it?
This is the quarter that we might see earnings helped along with a recapture of CAP reserves ... time to think about adding pre conference call
"Love it! More people staying in their homes during the pandemic, making heavier usage of their drainage systems at home: Roto-Rooter revenue rose to $175 million, an increase of 8.6%. Net Income due to Roto-Rooter (as more calls are made for sewer unclogging) climbed strongly to $32.0 million, an increase of 16.5% !"

I still don't understand how the Board can fulfill its governance responsibilities while allowing the CEO to sell 14% of his holdings ($6mm plus) after June 20th. Way too late in the quarter...may be criminal behavior! Revenue for both segments are baked in providing way too much insider information to trade on. Other insiders selling late in the quarter led to a crowded trough which institutionalizes this pattern of late trades with insider info being available. The trading window should be closed a couple of weeks following the release of quarterly results ie. early May.
Looks like a great quarter just reported. $2.72 adj EPS vs $2.36 consensus. Revenues $20m above estimates.
