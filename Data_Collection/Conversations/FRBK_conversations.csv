"I hope Vermon knows what he is doing here. All this money invested in brick and mortar stores when the millenials do their entire lives on their phones. Vermon and Harry need to get more in tune with the online banking. The online banks are offering a better rate of return on their money markets, and this attracts depositors. What do I know, I never worked in a bank."
Looking at the charts this is priming for a large move based on the increased volume and declining volatility. Only problem is this could go either way when it finally resolves. Bullish over $4.07 and bearish under $3.86
Not a big fan of management here but if this falls under $2.86 I think it is a good short term buy. At that point it is trading at cash value as of Dec 31st and you get the business for free. Normally this doesn’t happen but during markets like we have now it could easily happen. I may put some bids in around $2.80 and let them sit there.
"It is taking longer than i thought, but as i had said last year this will be a $3 Stock. Madonna, Logue, and Hill need to go! This ship is rudderless and all they'll get in NY are the crumbs dropped by the real banks. VOTE THEM ALL OUT!"
Anything new here? Saw the preferred offering and would have been great to be in on that. They get 7% interest quarterly and converts to common at $3 so they also get the upside if the shares start moving. Interesting that it was a private placement as well. Got out a while back but try to check in to see if anything has changed. Best of luck.
"We might see this stock under 2 bucks in the near future. These losers at Republic have had nothing to say to date. They taking any steps to increase services during this time, or are they just sitting on their #$%$? WalMart and Costco are taking steps to increase their business. Doing shipping and curbside pickups. They are at least working hard to ensure there is cashflow. What is republic doing? Why don't these tired out second hand lions retire and let new blood move the company forward?"
"Company is having a stock buyback and the stock takes another 10% haircut. Vernon, you think we can buy your stock for a buck and a half? Since you have taken no action to stabilize the stock we might get it down at that level."
Anyone buying at $3?
"as I thought...this will become a 3 dollar stock. management is old and tired, they are giving away jumbo and commercial portfolio money when they don't have to and they are not in wealth management. time to have a few retirement parties..."
"Vernon, Harry, and Frank, you can't even buy a bottle of two buck chuck with a share of this stock. I guess giving yourselves and your friends the dividend paying preferred stock didn't help the share value too much. But, don't worry because you guys will make money."
Vernon being investigated in the UK will make the regulators uncomfortable here. It will go below 4 and then maybe I’ll buy more.
It just doesn't pay any longer to buy and hold stocks. The traders have capitalized on the market and no stock is safe.
I was going to buy toilet paper but it may be cheaper to just request the stock certificates.
Have some more orders in at $6 and $5.85. Hoping to grab some more shares this week.Have about 8 more buys that I would like to get in at some point. Taking it slow due to the low volume and potential for swings in the price.
Call went as expected and was happy to hear that they do not need to raise capital to continue the expansion. Next yr they will look at different funding options if it is need but seem to lean more toward preferred shares or debt rather than common.
"Listened to the call and everything is going to plan as far as the expansion with the ""Power of Red is Back"" campaign. They opened 4 locations in 2018 and are opening 7+ locations in 2019 and that will include the 3 in New York. They are still growing deposits at a really fast rate 16% and seem like they are taking share locally."
"When Harry, Vernon, and Frank invest in their own stock they lost money. It's a good thing they draw a massive salary because they can use it to offset their failures with the company."
Looks like the breakout to the upside is happening today based on volume and price.
Go figure
Doing my part keeping this up today. We will see if this pays off but I think the price is starting to stabilize here. Famous last words...
Year end tax selling !
Book value now at $4.27 share as of 6/30 and I will be buying again if this goes below that mark. Going to take a while for this to get going but should be worth it for those that can hold out.
Book value continues to increase with no real debt on the books the shares will eventually stabilize around book value $4.26. I will be a buyer again if this can hold the prior low of $3.86. Otherwise keeping the powder dry for lower prices. No hurry on this one.
"THE POWER OF RED, but I didn't think they meant financially. I thought they were talking about the old red from the Commerce chain that TD bought out. Now I realize they mean in our brokerage accounts."
Load the boat under $3
Vernon Hill the guy that blew up Commerce Bank into a force !!!
Interesting side note is that the founder had a non compete for 10 yrs after the sale of commerce to TD bank in 2007. Almost like clockwork is when the growth plan for Republic took off. The founder wasn’t exactly sitting back while the non-compete was in effect here in the US. He started another bank in the UK and it is called Metro Bank. Take a look at the Metro bank stores in the UK online and they are identical to the new Republic bank sites. Also nice to note is that Metro bank has traded between a $1.5-$4.5 billion market cap(swings are Brexit related). Pretty sure Republic will get to the billion $ club as well in due time. Final thought is he knows how to run and grow banks.
"What a way to start the new year. The low volume invites traders to push this stock around. Good thing I have other investments. I still think this is a safe haven but Vernon, Harry, and Frank need to produce more than a penny earnings."
What is the deal with Republic Bank? The stock flat flatlined.. when are they opening up in New York? I know I heard during the summer but what is the latest?
"Anyone see this article in the Inquirer?He’s always been a real estate man at heart. But is bank-builder Vernon W. Hill finally slowing down?As chairman of Philadelphia-based Republic First Bancorp, the founder of the former Commerce Bank and England’s MetroBank Plc, Hill continued to champion spotless, glass-walled “stores” for a decade after rivals all but gave up adding neighborhood locations, as customers moved online and onto mobile phone financial apps.Related storiesThis week, Hill said he was putting Republic’s outpost campaign on pause, too.Sidestepping a direct question from Frank Schiraldi, veteran bank analyst at the Wall Street investment bank now known as Piper Sandler, Hill said, “We like stores, but the world is different than it was in the days when we’re building one new store each week.”Hill added, “We’re certainly going to slow the store growth down."" To be sure, “stores are an important part of building a brand."" But almost completely outside the company’s Philadelphia and South Jersey branch network and its New York outpost, federally funded, forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loans have created a big population of new small-business Republic customers. They have less demand for branches, Hill and his team told investors.Even with its new business in federally funded loans, Republic warned that it faces a charge for credit losses early next year. Shares were down as much as 10% in midday trading, though still above last spring’s coronavirus-shutdown lows. The shares closed at $2.72, down 16 cents, or 5.6%.The Inquirer Business Weekly NewsletterOne-quarter of the 100,000 bank branches that operated in the U.S. in 2008 are gone, with more closing weekly.While a few national lenders, notably JPMorgan Chase & Co., continue opening what retail bankers call “stores” in new markets such as metro Philadelphia, multistate lenders such as Wells Fargo (which has the nation’s largest branch network) and PNC, and Pennsylvania banks such as Fulton and Univest, have announced branch shutdowns and consolidations, accelerating amid the virus restrictions."
"Great, republic enters the NY market just when the democrats are destroying the city and state. People are fleeing there and we are investing in banks there. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/republic-bank-hires-carol-hasenstab-130000621.html"
I think frbk did a good job with the ppp loans. I’m hoping some of that loan work will translate into better earnings. We will see.
So they found a way to lose $0.04 and decrease book value by 3 cents per share during the quarter. Going to be on the call and only question I have is what is the run rate on the non-interest expense side. They note that salaries are increasing during the expansion and that is fine but those are not going away when the expansion is completed.
Looks like they are going to be a bit more forth coming with expenses when they release the 10k in a few weeks. They are also looking at issuing more detailed break-even analysis by stores. They had nothing to add specifically at the time of my question on the call related to splitting out growth vs. run rate expenses other than the aforementioned. The one big takeaway from the call was that they will be doing a raise of either common equity or a combination of common and convertible debt in the 2nd or 3rd quarters to increase the percentage of tangible common equity to ensure it stays above 7%. They are slowing the growth of expenses quarter over quarter but I really need to see the breakdown of run rate expense vs growth related expense before I get back in this for anything other than a trade.

"Great job there FRANK., You guys able to balance your own checkbooks?"
"There is no question that Vernon Hill is regarded as visionary banker. Folks love him or hate him, but there is no dispute that he build Commerce Bank into a powerhouse. I banked with Commerce and I have a have a small checking account with FRBK (which I use very little). I bought shares in FRBK because I have confidence that Vernon will build this into a powerhouse. Unfortunately, it seems like the FRBK recipe is identical to the Commerce recipe. This recipe worked great back in the 80's and 90's when the big banks would close at 3pm daily, be closed on weekends and their branches looked like they did in 1950. Today most area bank branches are attractive, their open on Saturdays and they are competitive on rates. Most old Commerce customers are still with TD despite not really liking them.Commerce did ""wow"" people with free pens, coin counters, great hours etc while not competing on rates, FRBK is following the same identical model. Unfortunately, people make far fewer trips to banks, due to direct deposit, credit card purchases and the declining use of cash and the internet. Point being is Vernon was able to build Commerce using some great gimmicks. Its time for new gimmicks. The Commerce model was evolutionary, and FRBK model seems stationary. FRBK needs to be more creative and innovative.As mentioned I am long and I think at some point FRBK will either up its game and become at least a 10.00 stock or JP Morgan will come along and buy them out. Vernon is not going to let this fail."
"i think the growth plans are being viewed as overly aggressive given where the economy is currently headed. Their residential unit is not managed well and is antiquated. Small banks cannot handle much margin pressure and that will hit all of the little guys in every area of the bank. I am down considerably on this stock and not happy. I do not think there is any manipulation or illegal trading, but I think there needs to be some changes."
This is absurd
Blow out earnings report and the stock moves lower?
