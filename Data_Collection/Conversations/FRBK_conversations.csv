"What a sad stock, such a sad stock from two worn out and sad leaders. First they get caught with their hand in the cookie jar and lose Commerce to TD, then the fiasco with Metro in England, and now the stock here cut in half. Vernon and Harry need to understand their reputation follows them. I own the stock and like the expansion plans, but these guys seem to think the future is in brick and mortar."
2 more republic bank locations about to be finished I saw them today. Buy now..
"The news is tricky today because the report is that insiders are buying, but in reality it was the scam they just pulled to give themselves preferred shares that pay a 7% dividend. You guys are tricky but we are watching what you are doing. We know what you did at Commerce, Vernon."
Never thought I would see this stock ready to dip under $4. At least a little good news today:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-buying-republic-first-bancorp-194151359.html
What is the deal with Republic Bank? The stock flat flatlined.. when are they opening up in New York? I know I heard during the summer but what is the latest?
Vernon is in the news again. Did the branches in NYC open yet? I didn't see anything in the news feed. These folks cannot even get the press releases out there. https://finance.yahoo.com/m/c71b758a-6879-38ef-9478-948b5fbbf5c8/vernon-hill-settles-petplan.html
All you do is complain. Sell already
So they found a way to lose $0.04 and decrease book value by 3 cents per share during the quarter. Going to be on the call and only question I have is what is the run rate on the non-interest expense side. They note that salaries are increasing during the expansion and that is fine but those are not going away when the expansion is completed.
"Talk about manipulation, this thing is making somebody a boatload of money."
Here we go again.
Have some more orders in at $6 and $5.85. Hoping to grab some more shares this week.Have about 8 more buys that I would like to get in at some point. Taking it slow due to the low volume and potential for swings in the price.
Looks like they are going to be a bit more forth coming with expenses when they release the 10k in a few weeks. They are also looking at issuing more detailed break-even analysis by stores. They had nothing to add specifically at the time of my question on the call related to splitting out growth vs. run rate expenses other than the aforementioned. The one big takeaway from the call was that they will be doing a raise of either common equity or a combination of common and convertible debt in the 2nd or 3rd quarters to increase the percentage of tangible common equity to ensure it stays above 7%. They are slowing the growth of expenses quarter over quarter but I really need to see the breakdown of run rate expense vs growth related expense before I get back in this for anything other than a trade.

"Iberia bank, a relatively little known chain. They are trading at $76.29 with a one year projection of $89."
"Wow, how low can it go Frank? You folks over there at Republic have anything to say about it? Plan to take any action to restore shareholder value? What is Vernon doing all day, petting that yorkie?"
With so many banks steering away from brick and mortar Republic Bank needs to make sure they don’t over build. Instead focus on technology and expanding services. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/america-s-brick-and-mortar-banks-are-vanishing-185956584.html

Doing my part keeping this up today. We will see if this pays off but I think the price is starting to stabilize here. Famous last words...
"Here we go again, total manipulation by the traders. The folks running the company? Don't much care about it I guess."

Makes no sense. DOW has another record day and this stock sells off .15 Is there something going on we don't know about? Earnings and growth seem steady and predictable. Perhaps it's just scoundrels playing the stock since its so thinly traded.
Volume still extremely high for this company and still in a big volatility squeeze. When this ends up resolving one way or another the move will be very large.
Price has my attention now...4.92 - i'm a buyer at 4.50

This is good but I'm not sure those NYC stores were wise when the democrats are trying to destroy the city. If the democrts succeed there will be continued mass exodus from the city. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/republic-bank-hires-regional-vice-151900676.html
Here we go again. These guys are making a bundle.
"Here we go again, total manipulation on this stock. Somebody is making a great deal of money here."
you are going the wrong way!!!
I was going to buy toilet paper but it may be cheaper to just request the stock certificates.
Vernon Hill the guy that blew up Commerce Bank into a force !!!
Interesting side note is that the founder had a non compete for 10 yrs after the sale of commerce to TD bank in 2007. Almost like clockwork is when the growth plan for Republic took off. The founder wasn’t exactly sitting back while the non-compete was in effect here in the US. He started another bank in the UK and it is called Metro Bank. Take a look at the Metro bank stores in the UK online and they are identical to the new Republic bank sites. Also nice to note is that Metro bank has traded between a $1.5-$4.5 billion market cap(swings are Brexit related). Pretty sure Republic will get to the billion $ club as well in due time. Final thought is he knows how to run and grow banks.
This bank is a wasted investment...Vernon is passe...put your money to better use!
Big money is playing this thing like a fiddle.

"Anyone see this article in the Inquirer?He’s always been a real estate man at heart. But is bank-builder Vernon W. Hill finally slowing down?As chairman of Philadelphia-based Republic First Bancorp, the founder of the former Commerce Bank and England’s MetroBank Plc, Hill continued to champion spotless, glass-walled “stores” for a decade after rivals all but gave up adding neighborhood locations, as customers moved online and onto mobile phone financial apps.Related storiesThis week, Hill said he was putting Republic’s outpost campaign on pause, too.Sidestepping a direct question from Frank Schiraldi, veteran bank analyst at the Wall Street investment bank now known as Piper Sandler, Hill said, “We like stores, but the world is different than it was in the days when we’re building one new store each week.”Hill added, “We’re certainly going to slow the store growth down."" To be sure, “stores are an important part of building a brand."" But almost completely outside the company’s Philadelphia and South Jersey branch network and its New York outpost, federally funded, forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loans have created a big population of new small-business Republic customers. They have less demand for branches, Hill and his team told investors.Even with its new business in federally funded loans, Republic warned that it faces a charge for credit losses early next year. Shares were down as much as 10% in midday trading, though still above last spring’s coronavirus-shutdown lows. The shares closed at $2.72, down 16 cents, or 5.6%.The Inquirer Business Weekly NewsletterOne-quarter of the 100,000 bank branches that operated in the U.S. in 2008 are gone, with more closing weekly.While a few national lenders, notably JPMorgan Chase & Co., continue opening what retail bankers call “stores” in new markets such as metro Philadelphia, multistate lenders such as Wells Fargo (which has the nation’s largest branch network) and PNC, and Pennsylvania banks such as Fulton and Univest, have announced branch shutdowns and consolidations, accelerating amid the virus restrictions."
Any word on when the other location in NYC opens?
"It was good to see that Harry took at $100K haircut on his salary. They will make it up to him on stock options I'm sure. Hey Vernon, can we earn a penny next quarter?"
Republic First Bancorp is up 9.59% to 2.40
"Not much from republic on the covid19. They have a little message on their home page that says pretty much nothing at all. They don't even say they are sanitizing the bank lobbies and atm machines to help keep people safe. They don't say that they will increase the drive up service so people don't need to go in the lobby. That things sent through the vacuum tubes are being disinfected. Hey guys, want me to stop over and help you out here a little?"
FRBK reached a 52 Week low at 2.94
NYC here we come.
"Quite a bit of power of red today, Harry. I guess some of what's going on might be tax loss selling as you have devastated the shareholders."
Amazing
2.50 here we come!
No pop. No volume. Unbelievable
"The POWER OF RED, a 3 cent loss."
"I come back here each day to talk to myself. This is such a sad stock in such a sad company that the stock is hardly traded, and hardly anyone ever bothers to post anything here. Some daytraders control the stock and move it around each day, and that's about it. The company doesn't care the stock is being manipulated, they likely do not even report it."
FRBK reached a 52 Week low at 3.70
Perhaps this is just big money doing what it does. The stock is thinly traded and can be manipulated in this way. I don't see anything going on to justify driving the stock down like it has. I guess maybe we find out at next earnings.
FRBK reached a 52 Week low at 2.23
How many times have I told Vernon and Harry about the importance of virtual banking? Do they see it yet? Is it registering in their caviar laden brains?
Looks like whoever knocked this down trying to get out in the last two days is done considering volume has fallen off a cliff today. Only 18k shares traded halfway through the day.

Would be nice if the company had something to say about it.

"Insiders have been buying shares, this is a very good sign. Looks like it may be time to add a few myself."
"One should look at the old history of Commerce bank . Look at the chart if you can dig it up. the growth , the splits and to me its a safe bet . I own it for free with no down side . Bought it at 3.5 and sold half my position at 9 when Vickers exposed insiders selling. Buy it on dips and sell offs. Anyone smell a split with that high PE . Lots of ETF and MF' s with serious institutional investors."
Republic First Bancorp is up 5.91% to 2.72
Bought my first set of shares today at $6.23. Not looking for anything amazing just was impressed with the rate of growth.
"This gang keeps opening banks in NJ, but NJ is going down the tubes. People are fleeing the oppression, taxes and criminality of the Dem control. They are moving to states where some freedoms remain, and people are not taxed to death. If the money is moving to Florida why isn't Republic?"
It's a long way to Tipperrary and it's a long way back home.

Year end tax selling !
Another new store opened. I guess a reason for the stock to be down again.
"It is taking longer than i thought, but as i had said last year this will be a $3 Stock. Madonna, Logue, and Hill need to go! This ship is rudderless and all they'll get in NY are the crumbs dropped by the real banks. VOTE THEM ALL OUT!"
"Frank, Frank, no volume on the stock, Frank. Nobody seems to care about your bank, or investment in such. You're doing a bang up job."
If this can finish strong to day I may buy some more at the close.
1.50 here we come!
"Tredinnick is from the original Commerce, so he knows how to grow a banking chain. He should be a good addition, and a key player in the NYC market coming this year. The buildout continues, but the market is not pricing it into the stock. Still seems like a good buy and hold."
"Frank, Frank, are the NYC stores open yet? How about a press release about their status? I know it's Friday morning and you are likely gone for the weekend but you should be able to do it from the golf course."
Republic First Bancorp reached a 52 Week low at 2.51
Anything new here? Saw the preferred offering and would have been great to be in on that. They get 7% interest quarterly and converts to common at $3 so they also get the upside if the shares start moving. Interesting that it was a private placement as well. Got out a while back but try to check in to see if anything has changed. Best of luck.
Dow is up another 200 pts and this stock is down again.
Very low volume on the drop to the 50day. Then big buying at the low. Today will be very telling about where the stock is headed in the near term depending on how the day finishes.
The POWER of RED
Go figure
"When Harry, Vernon, and Frank invest in their own stock they lost money. It's a good thing they draw a massive salary because they can use it to offset their failures with the company."
"Mobil banking, Vernon, just ask the Yorkie. You need a virtual bank subsidiary of Republic. Do you know this? Harry likely does not, Frank should, and you need to look into this. We can't crank start these banks any longer we have electric starters. While you may like cranking the peeps are not having it."

Blow out earnings report and the stock moves lower?
residential mortgage division is a joke!
"as I thought...this will become a 3 dollar stock. management is old and tired, they are giving away jumbo and commercial portfolio money when they don't have to and they are not in wealth management. time to have a few retirement parties..."
"Virtual Bank, Vernon, just ask the Yorkie. Please start working on this now before you spend all the money on cement."
"This bank in major growth cycle, opening many new branches, proven management in chargeLow risk keystone trade"
So much for that upgrade.
Did Republics Punxsutawney Phil see his shadow yet?
Here we go again. Anybody watching what is being done here?
"I wonder if Vernon, Harry and Frank are embarrassed that their stock is in the tank. I guess if you are getting rich you don't feel embarrassed about your failures as a banker."
"What a way to start the new year. The low volume invites traders to push this stock around. Good thing I have other investments. I still think this is a safe haven but Vernon, Harry, and Frank need to produce more than a penny earnings."

I have a nickname for this stock and company but it would not pass muster her on the message board.

Here we go again
"Vernon, Harry, and Frank, you can't even buy a bottle of two buck chuck with a share of this stock. I guess giving yourselves and your friends the dividend paying preferred stock didn't help the share value too much. But, don't worry because you guys will make money."
Finally broke out today and should see $4.50ish again real soon. Actually looking to get back to $6 at some point in the next couple months.
FRBK reached a 52 Week low at 5.62
More of the same here at the moment. I think $5 should provide some support if it gets there. Book value was $4.17 at year end and should be steadily increasing all year. If this gets into the $4 range it will be time to go all in
Vernon looks quite happy with his little Yorkie. I wish that Yorkie held stock in Republic.

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/republic-first-bancorp-inc-beat-123248081.html
Good to finally see some upside on this mess of a stock. Was hoping to get some down around a buck and a half but that didn't happen.

Day traders had a field day today.
At 2:32pm today someone sold 3.15 million shares and knocked the price all the way to $3 trying to get out of the position. Well now since it has been hit once that is the new target for shares to eventually trade and retest.
Would be nice to know what's going on here. Silence is golden when it comes to this stock.
If a stock can be boring it is this one.
Anyone buying at $3?
"There is no question that Vernon Hill is regarded as visionary banker. Folks love him or hate him, but there is no dispute that he build Commerce Bank into a powerhouse. I banked with Commerce and I have a have a small checking account with FRBK (which I use very little). I bought shares in FRBK because I have confidence that Vernon will build this into a powerhouse. Unfortunately, it seems like the FRBK recipe is identical to the Commerce recipe. This recipe worked great back in the 80's and 90's when the big banks would close at 3pm daily, be closed on weekends and their branches looked like they did in 1950. Today most area bank branches are attractive, their open on Saturdays and they are competitive on rates. Most old Commerce customers are still with TD despite not really liking them.Commerce did ""wow"" people with free pens, coin counters, great hours etc while not competing on rates, FRBK is following the same identical model. Unfortunately, people make far fewer trips to banks, due to direct deposit, credit card purchases and the declining use of cash and the internet. Point being is Vernon was able to build Commerce using some great gimmicks. Its time for new gimmicks. The Commerce model was evolutionary, and FRBK model seems stationary. FRBK needs to be more creative and innovative.As mentioned I am long and I think at some point FRBK will either up its game and become at least a 10.00 stock or JP Morgan will come along and buy them out. Vernon is not going to let this fail."
"This stock gets manipulated big time. A safe stock like this that is thinly traded is a prime target for manipulation. Oh well, I hold the stock for the long term so I'm not real concerned about it. Just wish they would build branches in my area."
My big issue right now even though it is cheap and trading under cash is that there has been no insider buying. If they don’t want to buy when this is trading under cash that makes me think they are really going to dilute the shares with more common and don’t want to take the loss. If I saw one of them put $1 million into an at the market purchase I would load up right now. Instead I’ve been buying other beaten down names and just watching this.
FRBK reached a 52 Week low at 4.14
"Needed to take a tax loss here to offset gains I had elsewhere. Thanks to Vernon Hill and his gang for doing some good with the power of red. Thanks Harry, I used your useless stock to offset gains in some real stocks. I hold some of the shares in case you end up selling the bank to a larger more successful bank that can pay a premium on the shares."
"It's good to see Vernon is bringing in some help, someone to advise him on the direction that bank needs to take. I wonder if he ever heard about virtual banking."
Why the 20% haircut on this stock when the market has been so strong lately?
Republic First Bancorp is up 5.08% to 2.48
Republic First Bancorp reached a 52 Week low at 2.86
"Vernon, are you and Harry pleased with your $2 stock? The banking industry has changed over the years, online virtual banking is here to stay. People were not going into the bank lobbies before the pandemic, and sure are not going in there now. Brick and mortar is important but a big footprint in the virtual world is more important now. I prefer to deal with someone in a real bank but the millenials don't seem to want that."

"Seems impossible to get any traction with this stock. daytraders are killing it but people that are holding the stock have gotten killed. The stock is so thinly traded, and the fearful leaders haven't helped the situation. I guess they are so rich it just doesn't matter much to them."
Call went as expected and was happy to hear that they do not need to raise capital to continue the expansion. Next yr they will look at different funding options if it is need but seem to lean more toward preferred shares or debt rather than common.
FRBK is up 5.26% to 8.00
FRBK is up 10.83% to $7.15
Book value now at $4.27 share as of 6/30 and I will be buying again if this goes below that mark. Going to take a while for this to get going but should be worth it for those that can hold out.
This is absurd
The Power of Red is back again today.
FRBK reached a 52 Week low at 4.95
"Frank, Frank, are you going to report more than a penny on the 28th?"
It just doesn't pay any longer to buy and hold stocks. The traders have capitalized on the market and no stock is safe.

FRBK is up 6.57% to 2.11
Load the boat under $3
Take a real shellacking here today. The daytraders have found themselves a stock they can really manipulate. They move it around so easily.
Here we go again. This one gets played like a fiddle.
"i think the growth plans are being viewed as overly aggressive given where the economy is currently headed. Their residential unit is not managed well and is antiquated. Small banks cannot handle much margin pressure and that will hit all of the little guys in every area of the bank. I am down considerably on this stock and not happy. I do not think there is any manipulation or illegal trading, but I think there needs to be some changes."
"We might see this stock under 2 bucks in the near future. These losers at Republic have had nothing to say to date. They taking any steps to increase services during this time, or are they just sitting on their #$%$? WalMart and Costco are taking steps to increase their business. Doing shipping and curbside pickups. They are at least working hard to ensure there is cashflow. What is republic doing? Why don't these tired out second hand lions retire and let new blood move the company forward?"
Buy buy buy republic is going to be an empire
$5 in the next few weeks
I think frbk did a good job with the ppp loans. I’m hoping some of that loan work will translate into better earnings. We will see.
This stock is even down on a day the Dow is up 700 points.
How low will they drop it this time before the run back up? Somebody is making a lot of money on this.
Stock sells off a couple of bucks and the company has nothing to say??? I guess it does not affect their paychecks.
Bought this stock years ago as a long term hold. Vernon Hill and Harry Madonna should be ashamed of themselves.
FRBK reached a 52 Week low at 2.65
"THE POWER OF RED, but I didn't think they meant financially. I thought they were talking about the old red from the Commerce chain that TD bought out. Now I realize they mean in our brokerage accounts."
The growth continues
"Got stopped out earlier this week but will keep watch to see if there is ever a capitulation moment. Will be watching to see how the low holds when it is tested again,"

"I hope Vermon knows what he is doing here. All this money invested in brick and mortar stores when the millenials do their entire lives on their phones. Vermon and Harry need to get more in tune with the online banking. The online banks are offering a better rate of return on their money markets, and this attracts depositors. What do I know, I never worked in a bank."
"Frank, Frank, what are you guys doing? I told you those NYC stores were going to cost a fortune. Where is the virtual bank arm of republic? That's what you should be working on, that is the future."
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz wake me up in a year. :)
Any thoughts on what the insurrections means to banking stocks?
Here comes earnings on the 27th. What does Frank have in store for us? Another quarter of disappointments Frank?
"What a sad little stock. Investors hardly touch it, there is very little volume. You don't even see messages here about the company. The company hardly ever releases any real news, maybe when a new store opens if that. The stock is half what it was a year or so ago. There are some daytraders doing ok with it. Maybe Vernon and Harry are over the hill."

FRBK reached a 52 Week low at 2.31
The growth continues :)
Where is the bottom here? Would be nice if the company would release a few more positive press releases and rehash how the expansion is moving along. The market needs frequent reminders. Since the stock is thinly traded the manipulators are doing their damage. They sure do get rich in the process.
Looks like the breakout to the upside is happening today based on volume and price.
"The Power of Red is back Frank, the stock is in the red pretty much everyday. Fine job you guys are doing, mighty fine job."
"Does anyone want this stock besides daytraders? Vernon, you will need a new angle this time around."
"Another day of losses for the power of red. Now I know why they call it the power of red, the stock is always in the red."
"Vernon, you and Harry reached a new 52 week low again. How low can you go?"
This is the craziest stock. I would like to know who pushes it around like this.
FRBK is down 5.38% to $6.99
thought this stock would jump as of January 20th
"Republic celebrates the opening of its 30th bank, and the stock tanks. I have watched the stock of local banks with just a few branches do better than this stock. I continue to hold the stock because it seems undervalued. Harry, Frank and Vernon are terrible at getting the message out to investors."
What a sad stock Harry Madonna. Four and a half bucks? How many years has it been now? You better get into the virtual banking game because brick and mortar is not working out for us.
FRBK reached a 52 Week low at 5.72
Revenue and earnings continue to grow. Looks as though there is value here going forward. If the Vernon Hill game plan continues to play out we should be in good shape.
Nice day so far probably has a bit to do with buffet touting bank valuations being attractive if you have a longer time horizon
"Company is having a stock buyback and the stock takes another 10% haircut. Vernon, you think we can buy your stock for a buck and a half? Since you have taken no action to stabilize the stock we might get it down at that level."
Vernon being investigated in the UK will make the regulators uncomfortable here. It will go below 4 and then maybe I’ll buy more.
Seems earnings and growth don't translate into higher stock price. Very strange indeed.
"There you go Frank, the power of RED."
played like a fiddle
2mil volume today??
FRBK is down 10.45% to 2.40
So far I like what I see regarding the earnings and revenue growth before taxes. Looks like loan losses are also trending in the right direction. Expansion plans are working and can’t wait to hear the call this morning.
Republic First Bancorp is up 6.46% to 3.79
"Vernon, you have the worst bank stock in the country."
Looking at the charts this is priming for a large move based on the increased volume and declining volatility. Only problem is this could go either way when it finally resolves. Bullish over $4.07 and bearish under $3.86
Worth investing here? Thoughts?
FRBK is up 5.08% to 2.48

They opened 4 locations in 2018 and are opening 7+ locations in 2019 and that will include the 3 in New York. They are still growing deposits at a really fast rate 16% and seem like they are taking share locally."
I think earnings should be a better that last quarter based on the changes to the 2 and 10 year yield curve. Also forward guidance should improve based on the same rationale. At the end of 3Q the yield curve dipped negative and finished basically at zero. Now it is closing in on .3% which is a huge improvement.
Agreed.....sell the bank
"Green, green, green...............finally!!"
With everything going on does this poor excuse for a management team have anything to say?
Not a big fan of management here but if this falls under $2.86 I think it is a good short term buy. At that point it is trading at cash value as of Dec 31st and you get the business for free. Normally this doesn’t happen but during markets like we have now it could easily happen. I may put some bids in around $2.80 and let them sit there.
The Power of RED. That's what people see next to FRBK in their brokerage accounts.
New location being built on the Deptford Mall parking lot !
I think there is an outside chance this may see $5 over the coming weeks. I am going to view that as a gift and will continue buying along the way.
Trading for $0.48 under cash now as of the last report

Anyone hear the conference call this morning? I can't imagine is was too great since the stock is down yet again. ARE YOU LISTENING HARRY??
"Like I said, those NYC branches were and are very expensive. They are just now realizing they are losing money and need to rethink their strategy? How do these guys not understand the pressure from online banking? The Millenials want to do everything from their smart phone, they do not want to drive to the bank. Many don't have cars and find it a waste of time driving to a bank and talking to a real person when they could be texting their friends. Vernon and Harry need to understand this mentality and adjust their business plan accordingly. Cash is disappearing and everything is becoming electronic debits and credits. You can do that from anywhere, even apply for a home mortgage on your smart phone. Vernon and Harry should have spent more time investigating this market, understanding it, and adapting to it. The lobby of my bank is usually like a ghost town now, what does that tell us? Build more lobbies?"

Some people just don't like to see other people succeed I guess. Bank and Stock are growing at a very nice pace. I don't think there is 1 shareholder that isn't excited they bought this stock.
THE POWER OF RED
Republic First Bancorp is up 6.03% to 3.08
"What a great stock for the manipulators, so thinly traded they can move it around easily."
"What seems to be the problem here? Anybody? I know earnings are not the greatest, but this is because of the rapid expansion of the bank and the building of new branches. These branches cost money, and the new branches in Manhattan won't be cheap. But, the bank is growing in leaps and bounds."
Anybody out there? Anybody know what's behind the tanking of this stock?
Republic First Bancorp is up 10.96% to 2.43

"Perhaps Cruiser is correct, perhaps Vernon Hill and Harry Madonna are passe, over the hill, irrelevant."
FRBK reached a 52 Week low at 4.85
Book value continues to increase with no real debt on the books the shares will eventually stabilize around book value $4.26. I will be a buyer again if this can hold the prior low of $3.86. Otherwise keeping the powder dry for lower prices. No hurry on this one.
Republic First Bancorp is up 6.10% to 3.05
"Here we have Vernon Hill and Harry Madonna touting the POWER OF RED as we are losing money. We are in the red, but not the red these jokers are talking about. These banker bozo's are lining their own pocket and throwing the shareholders under the bus. That's why the stock is less than half of what it was a year ago. Great job banker bums."
"Have the NY, NJ, and PA stores that were slated for opening in 2019 opened yet? Any status update on those. Maybe if these guys spent less time on the golf course they would have time for some press releases."
FRBK is about 2 years ahead of schedule on where I thought their stock would be.
