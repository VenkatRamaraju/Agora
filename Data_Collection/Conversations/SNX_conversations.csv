This was phenomenal earnings guys! + buyback and good guidance. Couldn’t have asked for better than this!
"Out SNX at $145.82 for a very, very, VERY nice Pure Earnings Winning Trade. Made back all the $ I lost on SMPL, plus went Green by a few thousand! This one worked out very well. This is how I play the Pure Earnings game. If a play fails, I get out, I don't care how big the loss is, and I immediately move on to the next one. No reason to be a ""bagholder"", just take the loss, because there are always new opportunities to recoup most or all of your loss within the next day or two or three. :-) I never feel like I am ""stuck"", I just take the loss and move to the next one, and as long as you do a LOT of research and Due Diligence, you should be able to have more winners than losers and come out Green for most weeks, most months, etc... :-) Now, time to spend at least 6 hours this weekend researching what to do next week. :-) Best Wishes to All! :-)"
SNX has a PE in the lower teens and a long term growth rate just under 10 percent. That tells me 2 things: the stock is still greatly undervalued at these levels and it represents growth at a reasonable price. Honestly an intrinsic value in the lower 200s sounds reasonable to me at this point. At the rate it’s going I would say that’s even being conservative.
"How is it possible that I had 70% annualised profit on SNX before and looking at my portfolio now, SNX loss + CNXC gain does not equal to my overall 70% gain before (huge difference)??"
As I wrote 2 months ago. SNX (+CNXC) is my best investment. Completely undervalued companies. Look at that p/s ratio & beating estimates. It's hidden gem
"Does anyone else find it crazy that this company employs a quarter of a million people, 24 billion in revenue (2020) and has a market cap of just 6 billion? SNX is way, way undervalued, even during a time when the market has overvalued many much more widely known companies. SNX (and its former partner CNXC) are sleeping giants and I am much more comfortable holding them than any of these 'hype' stocks that the novice investors cheerish."
"This name is undervalued still. Price to sales well below 1, free cash flow yield above 18%, EV/EBITDA well under 10, very low PE. All the hallmarks of a cheap stock. And it's performance has been excellent and I don't see why this name won't trade well above 100 in the future."
"Gonna place a $150.00 All Day, including pre-market, Limit Sell order at 7 AM tomorrow. Not expecting any hit, but if it goes that high, I am immediately out. Otherwise, will give the stock plenty of freedom in the morning hours, willing to lose my paper profit if she turns down, but not expecting that to happen. At 2:00 PM ET, I will evaluate current price, high of day, low of day, chart, and decide whether there is good upside potential for the final 2 hours. If not, I'll cash out with (hopefully) a nice profit. Otherwise will hold to 3:45 PM maximum, and go flat for the weekend. Still liking INFO as my next play, to the Short side. Company is profitable, but still seriously overvalued. They missed the consensus revenue estimate for the past FOUR consecutive quarters. Not by big amounts, but still, a miss is a miss. INFO just looks poised to go down on Earnings Release, unless the numbers are very good, and I just don't see that happening. Still no final decision, but it looks good as a Short Pure Earnings play, to me."
"Great Guidance!!!! Institutions funds are waiting for tomorrow, don’t even sell single share. Our share counts are nothing when hedge starts the action. I would expect good firework for next few days"
"Keep in mind, this is NOT a heavily traded stock. Typical volume is only 250,000 shares per day. This could really move tomorrow on an influx of buyers and much heavier than normal volume, IMO."
"Looking to get back into SNX at $145.00 as a post-earnings day-trade. Not gonna chase, but I think lots of traders took profits on Friday, which could give this an opportunity to pop back up to $148+ today. All the news on this one is good, there is no real reason for any significant sell-off today. Therefore, at $145.00, upside potential is decent, downside risk is limited, and I feel most comfortable daytrading this one because I like to trade on concrete news like an ER. Was looking at BYND which is up already in the early PM, but no, this Baby already gave me many thousands in profit Friday, and she still looks fine this morning, so I feel safer and more comfortable playing this one again because there are concrete reasons why this SHOULD still go up more today, IMO."
morning Max how are you Max good just watching this stock SNX along with a whopping oh wait still just me....
"I am hoping snx reports strong er and defensive investor jump in. snx should be shielded from the china trade war and is a tech value play. I am long regardless, the key here is to buy at 90 and trim at 108. I have made a lot of money doing this"
SNX is remarkably stable due to its cheap valuation. Owning it since several years ago has been nothing short of a joyride. There is a long runway of growth ahead for this name assuming it doesn't get bought out. Either way it's a win for longs.
Tanking for no reason. Buying this dip steadily
Incredibly undervalued based on fundamentals. Tiny float (41M shares). No idea how this is only a $6.5B MC. Should be $10B minimum. Sitting on over $1B cash so their balance sheet is effectively clean. Is it because they are very unsexy... a distributor as opposed to a disruptor? Someone please explain
"Actually there may have been one trade at the $129 level, crazy AH swings, but everything looks good to me for the stock to hold here and rally higher tomorrow. just my opinion. It is ALWAYS smart to take profits when you have them!"
"$64 to 100, nope!!"
"ER out now, GREAT beat on EPS, and very, very good Guidance, much better than expected! :-)"
"Massive revenue beat by 900 million $$ and so far a *yawn* from the street. I wouldn't be surprised if it repeats what CNXC did today, so the fraud institutions can load up at a lower price before the next liftoff"
"I'm debating whether SNX will have any decent momentum as a daytrade for Monday...On Friday she hit her High of Day AND a brand-new 52 week high, early, a little after 10:00 AM, then sold off just a bit, and basically traded in a flat, fairly tight range for the rest of the day. Stock is already up huge on the great ER. This does not suggest great momentum for Monday. BUT, lets consider a few things: 1: The overall market was down on Friday, not helping SNX. 2: The very fact it was Friday may have made traders nervous and eager to go flat for the weekend, not helping SNX. 3: The stock is still VERY fairly valued, despite the surge in price on Friday. You have to factor in both the great numbers delivered on EPS and Revenue, and the higher Guidance going forward. It was not expensive before the earnings release, and it is still not expensive right now, at $145.56. Perhaps this fact will become clearer to traders and investors on Monday, while on Friday they could only focus on the jump in share price 4: Friday saw a bunch of Analyst upgrades and PT increases. Two analysts raised their PT to $175.00, giving the stock 20% upside potential. There may be more traders focusing on these upgrades and universally bullish analyst comments, On Monday. All of these factors suggest the stock could still trend up tomorrow. Not by a huge number, I don't think. But maybe back up the $148+ level. I am strongly tempted to try to get in early as a daytrade, before doing my Pure Earnings INFO Short Sell later in the day."
"I’m in. Even after today, and with another pop maybe coming, hugely undervalued. It should trading at a P/E similar to other solars. Or at least half them. All the panels to be installed and other stuff needs connections and wiring. SNX has better growth prospects than 75% of big name stocks, and a lower P/E than almost 99% of them. May not be lightning, in a bottle, but this feels like safety in a worst case scenario."
"Expected: $0.49 per share, $5.12 billionReported: $1.83 per share, $5.53 billion"
"Long 640 shares of SNX at $128.25. This is a Pure Earnings play. SNX reports earnings in about 25 minutes, and I am expecting excellent numbers on EPS and Revenue, along with positive Guidance, to drive this Baby up through the middle and upper $130's, hopefully all the way to $140+ tomorrow. I sure hope I am right, because I just lost over 6k on a failed Pure Earnings play on SMPL. I took a LIcking, but I keep on Ticking! :-) Best of Luck to all and let's see what happens!"
This company is making my dreams come true. Have close to a 135 percent return on initial investment. Company is rapidly rising to intrinsic value. Still a ways away from being fairly valued so hop on board the train before it's too late. SNX has plenty of gas left in the tank to continue roaring higher.
"I'm with you Ryan & Robert, Definitely undervalued- 10/50 day Moving Averages positive, Growth rate to P/E attractive, Price to Cash low comparable, Market Cap. to Operating Cashflow excellent, Price to Sales a bargain, Zack Rank's = A+, great Corporate Governance, MACD up, Insiders & 13F filers positive outlook on positions, short term Fair Value of $134 (Yahoo Premium)- mid term, 95% undervalued $253 (SimplyWall.st).

"Very stable (+7-9 percent in afterhours) ... I think this will open at +6 or 7 percent, then it will continue to climb until close at between +15 and 20 percent. Excellent for long term."
"In fact, POSITIVE GROWTH year over year, and guidance implies it for next quarter too. excellent!"
"torn on this stock seems so under the radar but within their space they're doing well and have been for years relatively new shareholder here days like today remind me this stock still has a pulse, if anyone has some insight would love to hear it."
outstanding beat. $6.47 billion versus $5.7 billion estimates. $3.33 versus $2.26 wow
"SYNNEX Corp. (SNX) will be discussing their earnings results in their 2020 Second Quarter Earnings call to be held on June 25, 2020 at 5:00 PM Eastern Time."
"Question... does any feel as though this $IBM EPS beat will have a big impact on $AMD, tomorrow...$TSM had great EPS recently too... and $SNX as well...Instills a feeling of even more confidence going into $AMD’s EPS."
"Investor call today was kind of nebulous. They are going through with the spinoff which is a good thing (should release some untapped value. And Q2 sounds like will have a potential one time influx of extra business from converting to Work at home, but offset by reduced staffing. There was a discussion on a return to normalcy in Q4 but the magnitude of it all is still up in the air. At risk was the Travel segment (~$300MM in revenues, of which 75% was essentially at risk). So expect a hit of at least $225MM but the only other segment mentioned that was hit was financial services and only slighty. Anyone have any other more intelligent thoughts on the call? (overall, management went the route of ""less is more"" and ""avoid any projections"" since the market is somewhat tumultous right now)."
Buying opportunity?
Beat!Synnex (NYSE:SNX): Q2 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.83 beats by $1.34; GAAP EPS of $1.10 beats by $1.42.Revenue of $5.53B (-3.3% Y/Y) beats by $360M.
"Look at that SNX chart for today, a thing of beauty! Stock making another High of Day right now as it closes in on $151!"
any insight on the move today?
Here you go... it is well expected result. What an awesome result. Kudos longs... I would not surprise if we see 200 in few weeks.
Bought in this morning under $100. Looks like a shining star when they report earnings next week.
"My next Pure Earnings play, barring any terrible geopolitical news or a huge pop-up in the stock price early tomorrow, is going to be SNX. I plan to go Long with a large chunk of my capital tomorrow, sometime in the afternoon, ahead of this Baby's AH Earnings Report. I am very bullish on SNX, I see an extremely well-managed tech company, with very good financials, fairly valued with plenty of upside potential, and I see the likelihood of a very good earnings report tomorrow that could lift this stock all the way to the upper $130's. One of the biggest positives for me on this one, is the Earnings History of SNX. Do your own Due Diligence and check every earnings report going back 14 quarters. Yes, FOURTEEN quarters. How many times have they beaten EPS consensus estimates?? Fourteen! :-) And how many times have they beaten Revenue consensus estimates?? 12 of 14. And the two misses were both TINY, one was -0.1, the other -0.8. Of course the past does not predict the future, but the fair valuation price of the Baby just puts it over the top for me, making the risk/reward ratio extremely good, IMO. Please do your own research, because I am sometimes completely and totally wrong. But hopefully not THIS time. :-)"
