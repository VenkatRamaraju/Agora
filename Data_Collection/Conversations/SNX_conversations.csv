Do you guys have shares or calls?
"Wait for the call at 5pm EST. This will move higher, and into the AM."
Can SNX break 120?
"Bid is now up to $137, Yes! :-)"

"NIO is up a LOT here in the PM on heavy volume already, bid is at $3.73 after closing Friday at $3.51. Japan government announced a delay in getting rid of their EV purchase incentive program. Definitely looks like a good stock for daytrading today, but...already up a lot right now, and she turns around fast and unpredictably. I'm still looking to do SNX."
SNX Q3 Results Exceed Expectations. Looks manipulation. Will go green tomorrow.
Just doubled my position in both companies. Let’s see how this goes
"they beat, i don't know or somethings wrong in the guidance"
Synnex reached an all time high at 86.43
"Yes, this Baby just keeps on making higher highs! Tiny pullbacks then strong moves up! Keep on going baby, break that magical $150 number! :-)"
"Great financials, undervalued cheap stock. Gotta love it"
when splitting off... of course they hung onto the majority of the established profitability... proof will be in the pudding
Agree just wondering if we can get to the 140 today after hours
Does anybody know how the spin off will work?
"earnings are out read them yourselves, great quarter, next quarter expecting more of the same, dividend on july30th and watching the tape turn red in the AH. lol more bullish than ever about the long term but you might as well flip a coin on earnings day"
Should I buy this stock?
Robot tradingBuy more
SNX is down -4.93% to 133.77
Synnex is down 5.79% to 125.19
Carnivore Trading will be putting out a buy on SNX on Monday. Heads up. Those guys move markets.
Incredibly undervalued based on fundamentals. Tiny float (41M shares). No idea how this is only a $6.5B MC. Should be $10B minimum. Sitting on over $1B cash so their balance sheet is effectively clean. Is it because they are very unsexy... a distributor as opposed to a disruptor? Someone please explain
SNX is still a good buy
boom ?
"Finally jumped into SNX at $148.35. Paid way more than I was planning early this morning, but this Baby ran up right at the open and just refused to pull back. I had a Limit Buy at $145, then raised it to $146.00, but no fill. The good news is, the stock is acting very solid and strong all morning long. I lowered my share purchase from a planned 600 down to 500, because I am guilty of chasing this one, and if she turns down I want to at least slightly limit my loss. So, lets see if this upward trend can continue. Would be nice to make another 1k on this play. :-) Still gonna do INFO as a Short Sell before the close today, but she is up right now so there is no rush, I don't mind waiting until 3:30 ET to sell this and do my Short. Let them BOTH go up for the rest of the day. :-) Hope you guys are in at a better price than me! :-)"
"This is a great long-term hold, still has upside.. analysts may be pricing in a slight decline, but the accumulation signs are bullish."
"Very impressed with how this stock has acted today. Nothing too fast, but absolutely rock-steady moves up in a continuous trend all morning long. Small pullbacks for consolidation, as with every momentum-moving stock, but everything right now looks very good for the afternoon session. :-)"
"$cnxc reported a good quarter and its down 7%; any interpretations of that reaction? was it already baked into the stock, and people just taking profits (makes me wonder about an entry point actually lol, i digress) in short are we in for a similar reaction with $snx ? Or do we fill the gap from $130 and march upwards? bullish but Im looking for others insight as to how the next 24hrs plays out, crystal ball anyone?"
I would buy ah - I bought some
When is this thing going to bounce ? Thoughts ?
Why would you need this company in a blockchain environment?
shorted 1k shares.
SNX reached a new 52 Week Low at $71.94
SNX reached a new 52 Week Low at 94.95
Expecting an upgrade hopefully Monday if not sometimes this week!
Looks like guided lower......
"SNX Sale of 349,000 shares at $130.30 per share by Beneficial Owner Peer Developments Ltd on 01/17"
It should be traded above 150. Bullish on this. It will take off very shortly.
Massively undervalued
"News out, splitting into two companies, stock bid up, still no ER release...."
good morning fellow longs i've come to comment before this thing hopefully gears up for another all time high get some life back in this thing...some volume...anything maybe just a comment or two
time to short
Here you go... it is well expected result. What an awesome result. Kudos longs... I would not surprise if we see 200 in few weeks.
"Actually there may have been one trade at the $129 level, crazy AH swings, but everything looks good to me for the stock to hold here and rally higher tomorrow. just my opinion. It is ALWAYS smart to take profits when you have them!"
Another day in the red after a short run up and stellar earnings report. This is in need (and deserving) of another bullish analyst upgrade.
sold at 147 haha
SNX is remarkably stable due to its cheap valuation. Owning it since several years ago has been nothing short of a joyride. There is a long runway of growth ahead for this name assuming it doesn't get bought out. Either way it's a win for longs.
Can anyone explain the drop in book value? from $80-something to $40-something?
is it out?
Tanking for no reason. Buying this dip steadily
Glad no one is talking about this value gem so I can keep accumulating..
this is a $200 stock right now....the earnings and revenue growth were amazing.......the spin off will unlock hidden value in the companies now that they are separate. I am in till at least 200.....
Seem to have leveled off at 138
No good
Bought this to hold through earnings! So undervalued!
This is undervalued. It should trading on 300s
SNX may be a compelling opportunity. Ive been struggling with this stock lately. Some of my other trades have been from awesom-eSTOCKS which are working out pretty well.
"Come on Baby, one more pop up to the $150+ level, please. I'm gonna give you 10 more minutes to impress me. :-)"
Stock is circa $10 down yet forcast this Q was up when will it move ?
Synnex is up 5.42% to 108.79
"Not much volume at all here in the AH session. But I see no reason for this to go anywhere but up. Earnings were great and the planned company split later this year, while somewhat rare, does not seem to carry any immediately negative implications or dangers, at least not as far as I can figure out."
"Investor call today was kind of nebulous. They are going through with the spinoff which is a good thing (should release some untapped value. And Q2 sounds like will have a potential one time influx of extra business from converting to Work at home, but offset by reduced staffing. There was a discussion on a return to normalcy in Q4 but the magnitude of it all is still up in the air. At risk was the Travel segment (~$300MM in revenues, of which 75% was essentially at risk). So expect a hit of at least $225MM but the only other segment mentioned that was hit was financial services and only slighty. Anyone have any other more intelligent thoughts on the call? (overall, management went the route of ""less is more"" and ""avoid any projections"" since the market is somewhat tumultous right now)."
Synnex reached an all time high at 90.80
Synnex is down 10.27% to 97.92
"This baby is trying to push up again. Still looks fine to me. I put a $149.35 Stop Sell on her, just to guarantee myself a minimum $500 profit on the play. Not expecting it to hit, and want to stay in to try to ride this up even higher, until 3:30 ET or so..."
Synnex reached an all time high at 161.26
Even with this brutal tech correction this held up strongly - undervalued based on p/e and sales/book value..
Fire work starts️
SNX reached a new 52 Week Low at 89.60
this is starting to creep back.. not saying it will happen but why would i net be shocked if this pops over 85 by Friday
"Should be right around 4:15 ET, the Release. Few more minutes. Anticipation and adrenaline rush for me. :-)"
"She is running away, but without me! :-( Looks strong and solid, I raised my limit Buy to $146.00, but no fill."
SNX reached a 52 Week low at 76.26
SNX has a PE in the lower teens and a long term growth rate just under 10 percent. That tells me 2 things: the stock is still greatly undervalued at these levels and it represents growth at a reasonable price. Honestly an intrinsic value in the lower 200s sounds reasonable to me at this point. At the rate it’s going I would say that’s even being conservative.
Synnex is up 5.09% to 154.99
I mean buy now b4 earnings ah
SNX reached a 52 Week high at 110.77
I expect a nice 10 percent surge
"Out SNX at $149.90 for a nice gain on 500 shares. And, just Sold Short 1100 shares of INFO at $79.90. Very happy with this fill price, stock went up today which only increases the chances that my Short will work out well for tomorrow. :-) Best of Luck to All! :-)"
"Market open almost here. Would be nice to see strong volume right at the open, stock price jumping around enough to allow for a fill at $145.00, then pushing up to $146+ and holding above that level. Will it happen?? I dunno...But we WILL know in about 3 minutes! :-)"
SNX reached a 52 Week low at 77.57
1st Target achieved (100). Next will be 130.
"$7.6 billion merger deal with Tech Data, one of the world's largest technology distributors. The deal is expected to boost earnings by 25%. Short term Fair Value of $134 (Yahoo Premium)- mid term, 95% undervalued $253 (SimplyWall.st)."
SNX is down -5.80% to 100.55
SNX reached a new All Time High at 139.87
Synnex is up 5.02% to 93.64
"Out SNX at $145.82 for a very, very, VERY nice Pure Earnings Winning Trade. Made back all the $ I lost on SMPL, plus went Green by a few thousand! This one worked out very well. This is how I play the Pure Earnings game. If a play fails, I get out, I don't care how big the loss is, and I immediately move on to the next one. No reason to be a ""bagholder"", just take the loss, because there are always new opportunities to recoup most or all of your loss within the next day or two or three. :-) I never feel like I am ""stuck"", I just take the loss and move to the next one, and as long as you do a LOT of research and Due Diligence, you should be able to have more winners than losers and come out Green for most weeks, most months, etc... :-) Now, time to spend at least 6 hours this weekend researching what to do next week. :-) Best Wishes to All! :-)"
Boom! Love a good trade! Stop loss set for SNX. Can't lose! Next trade = ROKU! Target $220 without HBO Max deal. $250 with HBO Max deal!
Did they miss bad?
If this thing drops tomorrow on God like earnings tomorrow I am buying the dip just like Concentrix
what time is earings?
"torn on this stock seems so under the radar but within their space they're doing well and have been for years relatively new shareholder here days like today remind me this stock still has a pulse, if anyone has some insight would love to hear it."
congrats
Their estimate for next quarter was $2.52 - analysts wanted $2.56 - so here come the computer sell programs.
"In fact, POSITIVE GROWTH year over year, and guidance implies it for next quarter too. excellent!"
this will boom today!!
better wait conference call i 30 minutes
"Earnings play out. I got in at $128.06, and out at $147 (used a market order too). It looked like it took SNX a couple of minutes before it finally opened. Market would give me the exit until 9:33am. I do still have a 135/140 call spread I bought at $125. The spread on that right now is wild, and midpoint is only $3.70. I put an order to exit at $4.75. Probably won't happen until next week."
falling Part at close
"Long 640 shares of SNX at $128.25. This is a Pure Earnings play. SNX reports earnings in about 25 minutes, and I am expecting excellent numbers on EPS and Revenue, along with positive Guidance, to drive this Baby up through the middle and upper $130's, hopefully all the way to $140+ tomorrow. I sure hope I am right, because I just lost over 6k on a failed Pure Earnings play on SMPL. I took a LIcking, but I keep on Ticking! :-) Best of Luck to all and let's see what happens!"
Out look looks good for coming quarter. The current consensus EPS estimate is $3.06 on $5.36 billion in revenues for the coming quarter. Currently 52 week low. Good entry point. Guess will end green.
Starting to regret moving a small portion of my stake of SNX over to LOW. This deserves a much higher valuation
What about SNX now? Still hopping to go up.
SNX reached a new 52 Week Low at $78.32
SNX reached an all time high at 150.15
Charles you are the mail thank you for the heads up. You are 5 for 6 Great job great research
"Great Guidance!!!! Institutions funds are waiting for tomorrow, don’t even sell single share. Our share counts are nothing when hedge starts the action. I would expect good firework for next few days"
SNX is up 4.94% to 121.22
Snx going up after earnings or down??
is it rumor that SNX will be acquired?
"How is it possible that I had 70% annualised profit on SNX before and looking at my portfolio now, SNX loss + CNXC gain does not equal to my overall 70% gain before (huge difference)??"
Anyone know why this stock has fallen off a cliff the last three trading days?
I feel it’s fairly priced at $120...believe there is still some upside
A nice award from HP to boot! Distributor of the Year!
who is long on this stock? who think that this evening will be good?
Spinning off today look for shares of the company 1 for 1
Why is synnex down 50% today?
Glad I got in at the 80$'s. Ceiling is only getting higher!
"Is there 20% upside after ER? Looking at the low P/E and healthy EPS, I would think so."
"well, ok"
"SNX is at High of Day price right now, needs to push through $150. Two different analysts just raised their PT to $175, so no reason she can't push through $150 and keep going higher today. You CAN do it, Baby! :-)"
whats up?
"Sales are booming but earnings are not keeping up. Serious margin contraction is driving this stock lower. All the same, they are managing the balance sheet well."
"Massive revenue beat by 900 million $$ and so far a *yawn* from the street. I wouldn't be surprised if it repeats what CNXC did today, so the fraud institutions can load up at a lower price before the next liftoff"
"Keep in mind, this is NOT a heavily traded stock. Typical volume is only 250,000 shares per day. This could really move tomorrow on an influx of buyers and much heavier than normal volume, IMO."
This was phenomenal earnings guys! + buyback and good guidance. Couldn’t have asked for better than this!
"stock market conditions sometimes gives you gifts, take advantage of it, as I have over 35 years experience"
"I’m in. Even after today, and with another pop maybe coming, hugely undervalued. It should trading at a P/E similar to other solars. Or at least half them. All the panels to be installed and other stuff needs connections and wiring. SNX has better growth prospects than 75% of big name stocks, and a lower P/E than almost 99% of them. May not be lightning, in a bottle, but this feels like safety in a worst case scenario."
"They beat big on Revenue too. The consensus estimate was exactly 6.00 Billion. They came in at 6.58 Billion. That is NOT Chump change! Very impressive numbers on both EPS and Revenue, I would call it a blowout of the consensus estimates, for both EPS and Revenue. :-)"
Seems a good fit - algorithm push down will be temporary.
+8% good job guys!!!

SNX reached a new 52 Week Low at $74.95
Sitting on this bored
"Just made 1k on a NIO daytrade, now looking again to get back into SNX at $145.00. To be a good daytrader, you have to recognize and jump on opportunities. I could see NIO was actively trading and had momentum, while at the same time SNX had no PM trades and normally does not trade much if at all, PM. So, I made my decision, jumped in at a fair price, and already sold to be up nicely on the day, and meanwhile SNX still has no trades in the PM. I could have just waited on SNX, but when you see an opportunity and have your capital free, jump on it! Be Bold! Just my opinion/suggestion... :-)"
any insight on the move today?
#$%$ is happening?
"Heading strong into next weeks earnings. I'll bet they beat, again"
Call bad?
Charles you are right again well done
SNX is down 10.25% to 72.75
A whopping p/e of......12. I'm continuing to load up before earnings.
Gonna slowly blast. just wait and watch.
"Last trade at $139.75, I think she will break $140 in this session. :-) But, I am holding out for $150, tomorrow. :-)"
SNX is up 4.94% to $78.92
boommmm
Here it goes at 3pm up up and away
As I wrote 2 months ago. SNX (+CNXC) is my best investment. Completely undervalued companies. Look at that p/s ratio & beating estimates. It's hidden gem
I would say $160 is our YE price target
Is it time to make a move on SNX? Not sure how awesomeS-TOCKS finds all these incredible trade ideas but im happy.
Crazy growth still to be had here. I’m thinking 150 by eow and 180 - 200 by end of October. Put some respek on SNX. 
"Per Updated guidance, why did this miss the train in the upside?"
"Does anyone else find it crazy that this company employs a quarter of a million people, 24 billion in revenue (2020) and has a market cap of just 6 billion? SNX is way, way undervalued, even during a time when the market has overvalued many much more widely known companies. SNX (and its former partner CNXC) are sleeping giants and I am much more comfortable holding them than any of these 'hype' stocks that the novice investors cheerish."
"Shorts better be careful, the market will overcome any shorting manipulations given that this company’s ER just beat EPS AND revenue. EPS was estimated at $2.69 and they came in at $2.79! Revenue est. at $4.5B and they came in over $5B! But thanks to shorts, I got some shares at a discount price from all the panic sellers : )"
"bad earning, outlook and market. ti will down to under $100."
"Conference Call is coming up at 5:00 ET, should be a lot of discussion about the breaking news that the company is splitting into 2 separate companies. Stock could move quite a lot, during the call. But, which direction?? Impossible to know. That is why taking this nice profit before 5:00 PM, is smart, IMO. So, maybe I am a dummy for not taking the profit now, but...I want more and I think the ER is good enough to push this up into and through the $140's tomorrow.... But of course I could be completely WRONG."
Monster Beat!
"$150+, nice job my Sweet Stock. Here's a cookie reward!"

"$SNX is going to file a press to announce its annual performance on January 9th, 2020. A company may report high earnings but actually have low cash flows，see: http://www.financial-education-hub.com/accrual-introduction/SNX. To estimate the quality of $SNX’s earnings to be released, see: http://www.financial-education-hub.com/accrual-method/SNX."
This company is making my dreams come true. Have close to a 135 percent return on initial investment. Company is rapidly rising to intrinsic value. Still a ways away from being fairly valued so hop on board the train before it's too late. SNX has plenty of gas left in the tank to continue roaring higher.
Dropped to a $100 back in April then ran back up $15. patience.
"resistance at 113.if break it, SNX will be heading 115 then 120let do it"
I love this company but the stock price doesn't make sense.
SNX reached a new 52 Week Low at 92.25

"I am hoping snx reports strong er and defensive investor jump in. snx should be shielded from the china trade war and is a tech value play. I am long regardless, the key here is to buy at 90 and trim at 108. I have made a lot of money doing this"
Nice report! I'm in @ $74.95
10 tomorrow. it is 1+4=5. I owe you 5 omly. pps is over 95 tomorrow
"Gonna place a $150.00 All Day, including pre-market, Limit Sell order at 7 AM tomorrow. Not expecting any hit, but if it goes that high, I am immediately out. Otherwise, will give the stock plenty of freedom in the morning hours, willing to lose my paper profit if she turns down, but not expecting that to happen. At 2:00 PM ET, I will evaluate current price, high of day, low of day, chart, and decide whether there is good upside potential for the final 2 hours. If not, I'll cash out with (hopefully) a nice profit. Otherwise will hold to 3:45 PM maximum, and go flat for the weekend. Still liking INFO as my next play, to the Short side. Company is profitable, but still seriously overvalued. They missed the consensus revenue estimate for the past FOUR consecutive quarters. Not by big amounts, but still, a miss is a miss. INFO just looks poised to go down on Earnings Release, unless the numbers are very good, and I just don't see that happening. Still no final decision, but it looks good as a Short Pure Earnings play, to me."
When is ex div ?
"SYNNEX Corp. (SNX) will be discussing their earnings results in their 2020 Second Quarter Earnings call to be held on June 25, 2020 at 5:00 PM Eastern Time."
Change my mindShort more
SNX reached a 52 Week low at 67.65
Why down?
what stock is at your choice it might be waiting for a request I tried a request and It work
Why buy this when you can buy Apple cheaper??
This is just like Adobe stock. Great report and price falls. All shorts and options expire and then the stock will rise
"Trying to decipher why this one is down, down, down, since 6/15/18. Was it earnings driven? Appears earnings are ok, but not great. Slight beat last few announcements. Is it merger and dilution driven? CVG merger should be adding $75 M in synergies. Lawsuit driven? There are several to worry about. Seeking either to block the merger, or to be compensated for perceived losses. Is it tariff and Trade War driven? This would be my guess for highest % reason for selloff. Dividend stayed the same. SNX and CVG both announcing earnings tomorrow, and I believe shareholder vote tomorrow. At any rate, chart looks oversold. I think it's being shorted like crazy. 1.32M shares short, and only 299K traded per day? That is a 4 day short squeeze if it happens. Any thoughts on this?"
"Conference Call about to begin, stock could move in the next 45 minutes. Would be nice to see her break above $140... :-)"
I got several thousand yesterday morning. ALL 4 stock screeners I use had it at strong buy and they are usually right.
Stock is too cheap
outstanding beat. $6.47 billion versus $5.7 billion estimates. $3.33 versus $2.26 wow
"Look at that SNX chart for today, a thing of beauty! Stock making another High of Day right now as it closes in on $151!"
Does this stock do anything other than go up? So beautiful.
Only down a small fraction...smells like a beat tomorrow after the bell.
I think it’s out. Pricing activity is a bit higher. Haven’t seen the numbers yet.
"SNX Sale of 451,000 shares at $130.30 per share by Beneficial Owner Silver Star Developments Ltd on 01/17"
morning Max how are you Max good just watching this stock SNX along with a whopping oh wait still just me....
"Market needs time to digest the implications of SNX separating into two publicly traded companies. I am unsure of the implications, if any, for the stock price, need to do research to get a better grasp on it... But stock looks fine, I am holding my shares, just put a $150 Limit Sell order in for the rest of the AG session, just in case things get crazy... Can't hurt to place the order... :-)"
P/S & P/E ratios are soooo small in comparison with peers. LOL
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS STOCK (SNX) ??
"Looking to get back into SNX at $145.00 as a post-earnings day-trade. Not gonna chase, but I think lots of traders took profits on Friday, which could give this an opportunity to pop back up to $148+ today. All the news on this one is good, there is no real reason for any significant sell-off today. Therefore, at $145.00, upside potential is decent, downside risk is limited, and I feel most comfortable daytrading this one because I like to trade on concrete news like an ER. Was looking at BYND which is up already in the early PM, but no, this Baby already gave me many thousands in profit Friday, and she still looks fine this morning, so I feel safer and more comfortable playing this one again because there are concrete reasons why this SHOULD still go up more today, IMO."
"My next Pure Earnings play, barring any terrible geopolitical news or a huge pop-up in the stock price early tomorrow, is going to be SNX. I plan to go Long with a large chunk of my capital tomorrow, sometime in the afternoon, ahead of this Baby's AH Earnings Report. I am very bullish on SNX, I see an extremely well-managed tech company, with very good financials, fairly valued with plenty of upside potential, and I see the likelihood of a very good earnings report tomorrow that could lift this stock all the way to the upper $130's. One of the biggest positives for me on this one, is the Earnings History of SNX. Do your own Due Diligence and check every earnings report going back 14 quarters. Yes, FOURTEEN quarters. How many times have they beaten EPS consensus estimates?? Fourteen! :-) And how many times have they beaten Revenue consensus estimates?? 12 of 14. And the two misses were both TINY, one was -0.1, the other -0.8. Of course the past does not predict the future, but the fair valuation price of the Baby just puts it over the top for me, making the risk/reward ratio extremely good, IMO. Please do your own research, because I am sometimes completely and totally wrong. But hopefully not THIS time. :-)"
"Look at the market caps on NTEC and NBRV before everyone else notices how cheap they are.Both each have something, pill technology that has to do with absorption times and frequencies and antibiotic pills for when regular antibiotics don't work.

"wacky, i saw this thing go from the opening down a point to two points and so on finally over -5% set up a trade to add some additional shares, didn't get in at the very low thus far today but close. not sure what to make of it but after the beat...hoping im right its rebounded since but only the first hour of trading hold on tight i guess"
SNX is down -4.93% to 113.85

Where are the results?

"My broker indicates exactly 218 shares have traded so far in the PM, stock is up just a fraction. I have a Limit Buy order back in at $145.00. Not going to raise it in the PM session, and not expecting any fill until the regular session. I really do not want to pay more than that, considering how much she has climbed since the Thursday AH earnings release."

I’ve held this for a year and am glad to see it regain its former glory! Looking for good guidance going forward on the 9 th.

SNX is available at mouth watering price. Anytime it will take off to 100 in near term. Still it’s worth to go up to 150 by end of this year if no crash on market sentiment

Bought in this morning under $100. Looks like a shining star when they report earnings next week.
Merger announcement in the AM. Earnings call in the PM. SNX will soar this week!! Completely undervalued and underappreciated
"SNX is Bullish, as per Thompson Reuters. Price target $114."
It would end above $120 today
Hopefully some consolidation before the power hour and into ER! Good luck to All!
beat earnings by 80%... *crickets*
"I'm debating whether SNX will have any decent momentum as a daytrade for Monday...On Friday she hit her High of Day AND a brand-new 52 week high, early, a little after 10:00 AM, then sold off just a bit, and basically traded in a flat, fairly tight range for the rest of the day. Stock is already up huge on the great ER. This does not suggest great momentum for Monday. BUT, lets consider a few things: 1: The overall market was down on Friday, not helping SNX. 2: The very fact it was Friday may have made traders nervous and eager to go flat for the weekend, not helping SNX. 3: The stock is still VERY fairly valued, despite the surge in price on Friday. You have to factor in both the great numbers delivered on EPS and Revenue, and the higher Guidance going forward. It was not expensive before the earnings release, and it is still not expensive right now, at $145.56. Perhaps this fact will become clearer to traders and investors on Monday, while on Friday they could only focus on the jump in share price 4: Friday saw a bunch of Analyst upgrades and PT increases. Two analysts raised their PT to $175.00, giving the stock 20% upside potential. There may be more traders focusing on these upgrades and universally bullish analyst comments, On Monday. All of these factors suggest the stock could still trend up tomorrow. Not by a huge number, I don't think. But maybe back up the $148+ level. I am strongly tempted to try to get in early as a daytrade, before doing my Pure Earnings INFO Short Sell later in the day."
"Just hit $140! :-) Doesn't really mean much, volume is anemic. But just symbolically, it's cool to hit $140 in this session. :-)"
"This name is undervalued still. Price to sales well below 1, free cash flow yield above 18%, EV/EBITDA well under 10, very low PE. All the hallmarks of a cheap stock. And it's performance has been excellent and I don't see why this name won't trade well above 100 in the future."
Beat!Synnex (NYSE:SNX): Q2 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.83 beats by $1.34; GAAP EPS of $1.10 beats by $1.42.Revenue of $5.53B (-3.3% Y/Y) beats by $360M.
Guys! What's your price target for this stock according to DCF this year? Like 200?
man I am stuck with those shares I bought after-hours no one is buying
Synnex is down 4.99% to 80.36
It is worth holding pass today?
"Hey all, I’ve traded $TER over the years. IMO, I felt this was recently, going into EPS , I started to accumulate Call options over the past few days .... been getting back into EPS PLAYS ... a good bet on this, like $SNX EPS. Wish I had purchased more call options today. Given the EXCELLENT fwd guidance, debating adding some OTM CALLS/JAN 21 LEAPS , using some of the profits."
SNX is up 4.97% to $79.77
It is worth loading into SNX or CNXC shares now?
Spectacular quarter and merger news...this stock is still cheap here...hopefully the new company that arises out of the merger still trades cheaply on fundamentals the way SNX does...this stock is absolute gold...a value stock that behaves like a growth stock. Very rare combination.
Don’t trust Pre market. Tomorrow it will be super high! Hold it for long term. Company has plan to break two public company soon.
great recent run and still VERY CHEAP! love this company
SNX reached a new 52 Week Low at $84.72
I love this company! Market does not bother but taking into consideration the current valuation I will probably add more
"Question... does any feel as though this $IBM EPS beat will have a big impact on $AMD, tomorrow...$TSM had great EPS recently too... and $SNX as well...Instills a feeling of even more confidence going into $AMD’s EPS."
Yes we make it woooo
great day! still lots of upside IMO
