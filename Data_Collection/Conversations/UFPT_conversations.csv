"Pre-tax earnings weren't that great (op income up 4.3%) - I wonder what people were expecting. It sure would be nice if they had a conference call, or at least comment more on the big shifts in revenue by customer industry. I tried to smooth out benefits of increased R&D tax credit, assuming benefits were earned ever since the Dialectric acquisition. I got for the first 3 quarters of this year: $.52, $.65, $.61"
"Good talk today with CFO. Acquisition seems to fit well. Dielectrics is basically a fabricator of plastic parts used in the medical space--some disposables and some into equipment. Will be a really big deal if adds $0.35-0.45 to EPS as management anticipates. The company may take this occasion to initiate a more visible presence with investors. I think this would be a plus since there is minimal research coverage. However, since this is a micro mini cap company probably not too many institutions will be interested."
"I listened to the presentation today. Bailey did a good job, but nothing really new. He simultaneously talked about losing old business and barriers to losing business. They are trying to establish a low cost overseas presence. Interestingly, their longer term goal is to bring medical to 80% of revenue. He stills sees medical improvement as taking place by Q4 of the fiscal year, which seems conservative to me: if I needed an elective procedure, I would get it now that I am vaccinated. They get exclusive use of some unique plastics, in return for promoting their use, and I think he said paying a premium price."
"New acquisition (not yet consummated) would increase sales by 10% or more. Of course, unstated is what they will be paying. Not much reaction to the announcement."
"Strange that a company doing well should be totally disinterested in communicating with its shareholders--no quarterly conference calls and bare minimum required in written communications. Info on Dialectics acquisition--which adds some 30% to revenues is in 8-K filed with the SEC. Key is that they paid $60MM for the stock AND ANOTHER $20MM FOR A 5 YEAR NONCOMPETE AGREEMENT. As I understand the new tax law, and depending on appraisals, most or all of the $60 MM will immediately be written off for tax purposes so no cash taxes are likely to be paid for several years. Reported earnings will not be reduced but cash flow will be greatly enhanced. Not sure about the treatment of the $20MM paid for the noncompete. Since this is an intangible asset I think that the writeoff will flow through the P&L and will reduce reported earnings. If so analysts and investors should probably ignore it. My accounting courses were a long time ago so would appreciate it if anyone could clarify the reporting treatment. Thanks"

"UFPT has $7/shr of excess cash and no debt. If they deploy that cash for a acquistion along with $30MM of debt, it could add $1/shr to earnings. In addition, the plant consolidations are almost finished resulting in better gross margins. The medical business is approaching 50% of sales with good rowth rates. UFPT is almost ready to break out. Strong buy."
"UFPT does not have $7 per share of excess cash. Their total cash is about $4.35. The ""excess "" is probably something like $3 per share. Yes they are finishing a plant consolidation which could be helpful and they could lever up and make a good acquisition. However, the problem is that they aren't very profitable. In 2016 they made only about a 7.2% return on average net worth. And that is before adjusting reported earnings for the approximately 17% which came from a contract settlement. Even if you deduct the ""excess"" cash from the net worth they made only about a 9% return. I have liked this stock and have owned it for the reasons given by Stkpikr, but to support this relatively high PER for a microcap stock some significant improvement is needed--and soon."
"UFPT is generating about $25MM in free cash after capex. That is $3.30/shr that could go to dividends. If not, it adds 8.3% in cash accumulation on the balance sheet each year. They paid off all debt. 50% of earnings from medical packaging. Nice comnpnay that made a great acquisition 2 years ago."

"T0pMarketGaIners.c0m is one of the best “alerts” services I have found. Just sign up and watch from the sidelines, you will see!"
I have been preaching on UFPT for 10 years. They finally made a major acquisition and earnings are taking off as is cash flow. Thye have little capex needed so dividends will be coming as soon as dept is paid down. The real outcome is when they sell the whole company.NWIN is my second cheapest stock . See the conversation board.
33% tax rate. New estimate $2.15/shr. Excess cash $7.20/shr. PE 10x-- stock should be $38.
I'm absolutely mlnd-blown by the lncredible pr0flt opp0rtunities provlded by PennySt0ck lOl.org... you need to check them out now!
I hold this stock and like it but can't see how the two analysts with estimates on Yahoo for 2021 come up with a 50% earnings gain this year.
"I contacted investor relations to get access to the Ideas Conference virtual presentation, but I never received a response. Admittedly, my contact was made late in the day of Aug. 25, but it is also true that the announcement of the virtual presentation could have been made days earlier."
Trying to punch through a triple top. If it can move up to 28 on volume chartreaders would put the next move to the 32 area.
$7.50/shr in excess current assets. An acquistion would add $.75/shr to earnings. They have a powerhouse BS. Stock will get a higher multiple as they grow the medical segment and diversify away from autos. It is a plugger and we love it.
finally some decent eps results
This sizable acquisition adds some 30% to revenues. It is hard to understand how they decide not to post info re price paid. Would have been helpful to know what the acquired company does--is there any tech there or just plastic disposables? We have all been waiting for them to make better use of their cash and balance sheet. Hope this works out. More info should be forthcoming when they file 8-K with SEC in ~10 days.
"Gee, I thought results were good today. It is true that tax rate was around 14% which I imagine is below their run rate."
"I notice they blame part of the rev. shortfall on customer build up of safety stocks in Q2, but they made no such mention in Q2 earnings release. From past experience, be sure to look out for the occasional surprise in the 10-Q."
Careful. The market maker is a #$%$. Use limit orders
"The stock price sure is volatile. I wonder why? Often has sizable bid/ask spreads, but that does not explain some of the price swings this week."
"Not much info on Dialectics readily available on the internet. They have a web page which is totally noninformative except that they make something from plastic and apparently sell some to medical products manufacturers. Some places say founded in late 1990's, other say 2003. Supposedly sales ~45MM. Some 21 people at headquarters. Some 250 overall. Locations of plants not given. Head man appears to be in late 60's--perhaps reson for sale. One site had 2 people saying it was a terrible place to work and 1 saying it was great--posts a couple of years old. They are defendant in some sort of lawsuit--info on this available but I didn't want to pay for it. Very small footprint on the web."
This stock decline is a great buying opportunity. They are earning $2.65 in 2019 and have another dollar/shr in depreciation for a total of $3.65/shr. We are selling at 7.6x cash flow. The stock sold off because index funds dump all packaging stocks and they went with them. Their 50% of sales from medical packaging is growing at 6% and is recession resistant. They have paid off $15mm of debt in the last 3 quarters down to $33million. TBV has grown to $17/shr. I think they will declare a long awaited divdend in 2019.
