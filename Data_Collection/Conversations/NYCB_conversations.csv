Is the buyout chatter over? What do we have to indicate capital growth in this stock?
95 percent of loan deferrals returned to payment status and there was respectable loan growth this quarter.Of course we want to hear what Joe & Tom have to say on the call but it looks like things are stabilizing. When we eventually get a stimulus package and a vaccine for Covid-19 this stock will take off. I can see it going near 12 by years end and definitely in the mid teens next year!
What a coincident arrangement tmr! Double good news for NYCB! Beating earnings  Fed raising rates on the horizon = great future guidance for NYCBexceeding 12 to gap up first!
"What are you all hoping to hear at the quarterly review? Here are the points that I would hope to hear: 1. Explain the impact of the new rent laws to NYCB business model and how it will effect future earnings. 2. At the shareholder meeting in June, Joe discussed the share price issue and that they are very keen in improving it. What steps have been taken to stabilize and improve the value of the stock. Also, at the meeting they all strongly believed that the new rent laws would not pass or at worst they would be a compromise. WRONG!! How do they justify their assessment? 3. Please do not talk about how the stock has increased since the IPO, who cares? 4. Some hint of an acquisition. 5. I hope the analysts will begin to put some heat on management and not throw Joe and Tom softball questions. Just my thoughts. Please add your opinion/wish list. ThanksHave a Happy 4th!!!!"
What a strong recovery in NYCB this morning!! from low of $13.55 right back up to $13.75. yey!
"2021 prediction for NYCB: Price range $10.25-$11.75. Relatively flat price, continued dividend, average growth as it has been in the past, in other words nothing new!!! The caveat here is Tom's ability to begin transforming the company, business model, new management blood and of course the BOD. If he can do this in the 6-9 months, I can see a $16-$18 range. Just my thoughts, look forward to your views. Happy New Year to all of you!!!"
Go NYCB Go.
"NYCB has just signed a deal to change core processing systems to a FiServ system from an FSI system. Thery were not paying much to FSI before. In my view only reason to do this would not to be acquired in the short term, but to be around a good while. These bank conversions of mainframe systems can take from 2 to 3 years at best"
"NYCB & Blockchain Technology?What do you think about NYCB's initiative to collaborate on Blockchain Initiatives using Provenance Blockchain?NYCB will become an investor in Figure Technologies, Inc. & JAM Fintop Blockchain, LP along with 65 other community banks.Is anyone on this message board familiar with these firms and the potential of the investment to grow exponentially?Hopefully it will bear more fruit than the taxi medallion investment made a decade ago!"
"Excerpt from today’s American Banker:Why New York Community-Flagstar could be a good fitWeb-Only SourceApril 26, 2021 | American Banker: Web Edition Articles (USA)Author: Jim Dobbs“This represents a lot of progress all at once,” Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Chris Marinac said. “It’s a timely, strategic deal that makes a lot of sense.”Three-fourths of New York Community’s loan book is concentrated in multifamily, while relatively expensive CDs make up a fifth of its deposits. Its total cost of funds approaches 0.9%, and it also has a high loan-to-deposit ratio of 126%.With the acquisition of the $29.4 billion-asset Flagstar — slated to be completed in the fourth quarter — New York Community would obtain a sizable national mortgage warehouse business and some residential mortgages. Those additions would lower New York Community’s concentration in multifamily to 56% of the combined company’s total portfolio.On the other side of the balance sheet, New York Community worried about its interest-rate exposure once rates eventually rise in the coming years. Higher rates on CDs and wholesale funding would drive up funding costs.Under the deal, CDs would make up 15% of combined deposits, and the total cost of funds would fall to 0.7%. The loan-to-deposit ratio would decline to about 108%, according to a deal presentation. Non-interest-bearing deposits would more than double to 21% of deposits….However, the mortgage business is volatile. Following a prolonged period of prosperity amid low rates, it is bound to lose momentum in coming years, Winter said. Because of this, he predicted New York Community is likely to pursue further business-line diversity — and potentially more deals — after it digests Flagstar.Cangemi vowed to pursue acquisitions when he was promoted from finance chief to CEO in January, putting New York Community back in the M&A arena after a decade-long hiatus."
"Well I was buying a few days ago and it was going up and now this ,below $10. You would think there would be some word from management about what is happening or some action but nothing."
"yes in nyc, you will see all old HSBC branches/ATMs are becoming NYCB’s territory. Flagstar is adding global digital wings/wallets onto NYCB!"
"From yesterday’s American Banker, data on NYCB’s attempt to move away from the Ficalora model:‘The bank has made headway on the liability side of its balance sheet. At the end of June, CDs made up 26% of its deposit base, down from 32% at the end of December.Progress on the asset side has been slower. Commercial real estate loans accounted for 16% of the company’s loan book at June 30, while commercial and industrial loans comprised 9%. Those percentages were largely unchanged from the start of the year.’"
On a positive note today Wedbush raises their price target from 10.5 to 11.5. NYCB is caught in the downdraft with other regionals today.
is that Sal?
"Cramer said dividend is nice for NYCB, but he prefers growth"
"From Alyssa Kline in American Banker:If the deal closes as expected in the fourth quarter, it would be New York Community’s first bank acquisition in more than a decade.During the company’s second-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, New York Community Chairman and CEO Thomas Cangemi talked up the growth opportunities in deposits, loans and fee income, and ways that New York Community plans to tap into Flagstar’s legacy businesses to help remix its funding base and accelerate its shift to more of a full-service commercial bank.“This, in my opinion, is not a traditional merger,” Cangemi told analysts. “It is an alliance where we are taking the best of both companies and forming a much stronger, better positioned organization and creating significant value for everyone. The more time I spend looking at the two companies becoming one, the more excited I become about the combination.”Shareholders of both companies are scheduled to vote on the proposed deal on Aug. 4.For decades, the $57.5 billion-asset New York Community has focused on two products: multifamily loans and certificates of deposit. In the fourth quarter of 2020, multifamily lending made up 75% of the loan portfolio while higher-cost CDs made up 32% of total deposits.But under Cangemi, who was promoted to chief executive six months ago after the abrupt retirement of longtime CEO Joseph Ficalora, the company is changing its strategy by diversifying its loan book to include more commercial lending while simultaneously turning to its multifamily and commercial borrowers to drive more core deposit growth.By acquiring Flagstar, which operates the second-largest mortgage warehousing business in the country behind JPMorgan Chase, Cangemi expects to make significant progress on both fronts.The key will be cross-selling products and services, he said. That includes encouraging Flagstar’s warehouse customers to take out commercial loans and keep their lower-cost deposits with New York Community.Flagstar has “some very strong relationships … and we believe we can hold that and grow it very nicely,” Cangemi said. “It’s a very low-risk business model, if managed well.”In addition, the deal offers “a lot of liquidity regarding escrow opportunities inside that business model and there are going to be some opportunities” to gain deposits from warehouse clients, Cangemi said. Flagstar “turn[s] away deposits, they have so much liquidity. We will accept [them].”At the same time, New York Community hopes to draw more deposits by enhancing its digital banking capabilities. Last week, in a memo to employees about the post-merger leadership team, the company announced a new role — chief digital and banking-as-a-service officer — that will report to Cangemi and oversee the bank’s digital transformation.“This is going to build up to a nice line of business for us as we focus on getting our fair share of the payment space over time and trying to catch up on the technology side,” Cangemi said."
2 million out of the 7.5 million shares again traded in the last 10 minutes today. During the stocks uptrend we are consistently closing at the high of the day!
NYCB released their end of Novemb thiser update on loan deferrals this morning. Much improved. Outstanding loan deferrals down to approx $265 million - .65% of total loans.
This new management team will do well it would not surprise me if they did something with Bitcoin and that kind of platform in the future.
So where’s silent Sal the IRO. Back under his desk??
Is the acquisition to be completed at the end of this month??
"Can someone explain why this stock is down $4% with no news. I know financials are also down, but not in these percentages. Your thoughts?"
"Looks like some investment group increased its position quite a bit. I don't know what the market is making of it, but it looks good to me. At the least, the group thinks it is undervalued. At the best, it may be looking to take control or to push for a buyout. I just bought a few extra shares around $12, so this is making my gamble look good. Good luck."
Bringing the Bank to the 21st century I think this new CEO and his team will do great things I'm very confident in their ability to get the job done.
It appears that last week's drop/volume increase may be due to a fund or funds selling out of NYCB(for whatever reason). We are all waiting for next week's earnings and what the future prospects for the bank are.
Fed signaling that no further rate increases for the forseeable future. Yield curve is actually starting to steepen. Hopefully NYCB will receive some positive reports from the analysts which will propel the stock even more.A transaction with another institution maybe just around the corner. Ready for takeoff!
"Commenting on the merger, President and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph R. Ficalora stated, ""We are pleased to receive full regulatory approval for the merger of our two subsidiary banks. The merger should provide the Company with additional organizational and capital flexibility and afford us with further operational efficiencies by eliminating certain redundancies. We also expect the merger to be seamless to our customers and to our employees""........and in doing so we have earned our extravagant pay packages and excessive bonuses all the while doing nothing as far as stabilizing the common share price or actually creating value for the shareholders."
"Could NYCB's decline this week be as a result of Cangemi doing more of the same, meaning NYCB will be selling FlagStar's mortgage origination and servicing?Ficalora was notorious for doing this and we all know that Cangemi was 2nd in command during many of those years. Could this be in the works?It could entail the sale of the entire mortgage operations to a major player in exchange for cash, or part ownership in that entity!Just a thought as it could explain the pop after the announcement with the recent decline this week!Maybe NYCB can sell that division to Rocket Mortgage, or the company we sold the AMTrust operations to a while back for cash, or an investment in their business that can later be sold for a nice profit?"
I like the new CEO's plan for growth. Former management was stuck in the past. Expecting dividend increasesto match growth as they do more M&A and get lower costs for deposits. Price of stock seems reasonable as an entry point
"If they get bought out, more than likely will be M&T bank at around $16-18/share. Don't forget, they hold $2B in cash and that can add another a few more to the price. All the best to all of us shareholders."
Shorts squeeze happening breaking out today. About time
"I wouldn't be surprised if we beat the 30 cent estimate for the quarter. What they say about future earnings, loan and deposit trends for them and Flagstar as well as the merger will be what really matters."
Nice div. Great company.
The rise in the 10 yr. rate is expected tp reach 2% by year end which will push up home loans from 3% to 3.5% as well as long term rates for car loans . This will be good for all banks according to the Kiplinger report. Position yourself in interest sensitive stocks to get a jump on the action by year end.
I believe NYCB with merger with Flagstar behind it will raise the dividend by 2 cents quarterly starting in the 2nd quarter of 2022. I don't know if they will buy back shares but most likely will try to buy other lines of business to improve their revenue yield and mix!
"It appears as though the market is already pricing an expensive acquisition into NYCB's stock price after the announcement of the Webster and Sterling Bank combination at a hefty valuation. Perhaps the market believes that Sterling Bank should have been acquired by NYCB instead of Webster and as such it is punishing the stock for management's failure to do that deal, especially when one considers the fact that NYCB was obviously interested as Sterling ended up acquiring Astoria back in 2016 after NYCB couldn't get that deal approved!"
"B. Riley Raises New York Community Bancorp's PT to $19 from $16 After News of Flagstar Bancorp Purchase, Keeps Buy RatingThis is the highest price target upgrade so far!"
"Recently in last half hour of trading the volume has been unusually high and this indicates interest by the big boys. Some of you have mentioned merger news is coming and I agree that something is in the works. My potential candidates as takers are M&T Bank, TD Bank or similar banks with no footprint in the tri-state market. Or, as some of you suggested, merger of equals such as Bank United, Peoples Bank, etc. Anyway, I like the heavy volume and the 3-4% price increase in last few trading sessions."
I don't know if this really effects the share price but tomorrow will be a lot of dividends reinvested.
"I am a retired Anchor Savings Bank manager (remember ASB, before WM eviscerated us?) I have 5k shares NYCB down about $2. Enjoy the dividend every few months I must admit. Just wanted to mention how I enjoy the regulars cogent and friendly discussions here. It's a pleasure to come by and read every couple weeks."
woah look at those earnings!
Today (8/3/21) is the last day to vote your shares in the proposed acquisition of FlagStar Bank
"Do you believe that NYCB will announce major layoffs at FlagStar soon since the deal has already received shareholder approval from both companies?MTB recently announced its intention to layoff approximately 750 employees at PBCT Headquarters in Bridgeport, CT and it is not going over very well in Connecticut as politicians putting the pressure on M&T Bank.There was a recent article in American Banker regarding this situation. If anyone has access to American Banker, please post it here to determine if NYCB could be in line for the same type of pressure as M&T Bank."
"NYCB Q3 earnings report was decent, not great. Met EPS number, slight miss on revenue, loan growth, NIM slight increase, loan deferrals much improved but still not great. Same challenges as always remain. Next dividend payment of .17/share was announced, ex-div date of 11/6 & payable on 11/17. I'm surprised the stock price is so weak at 1:00 PM EST."
"The latest NYCB tangible book value is $9.20/share, so NYCB current share price is a 3%-5% discount to TBV.For those posters in the NYC metro area, can someone explain/clarify the rent regulation situation in NY?My understanding is that the NY Housing Authority controls the rent $$$ that landlords can charge in about 50% of the housing. A very small percentage is rent-controlled, the balance is rent stabilized. The rent $$$ are merely set, the NY government does not guarantee the payment, like in Title 19 rent funding. So if a tenant in a rent regulated apartment doesn't pay their rent, the landlord gets stiffed. Is this correct?"
"Was there a downgrade of NYCB today or just a reaction to the lower than expected housing numbers? This is after dividend was paid yesterday so who knows if this is related.Also, it may be that some fund is selling which is bringing the price down!"
Looking for another financial stock. Already have NYCB and PFS and very happy with both. Had PBCT and sold at the announcement of their merger. Anyone have another suggestion? Dividend is important to me at this point
"For the life if me, I can't figure why the price is tanking. Thet are profitable enough to continue paying their dividend. Interest rates are holding steady so their 5.73% dividend is reasonably attractive. Why has it been crashing the past week with absolutely no new news out there that I can find?"
Why would they cut the price target to $9.50. Even if they are short 10 cents to cover the dividend they would never cut it. That would drop the stock to $5
"NYCB (a/k/a ""The Best Bank in the USA) is stuck in a trading range. Doesn't like to be below 11 or above 13.Probably need to wait for next quarter's earnings to see if there has been further progress on NYCB/FCB performance. FED wraps up their meeting this morning & chairman Powell speaks at 10 AM EST. His comments can move interest rates & the markets, especially financial stocks. Stay tuned..."
"NYCB Q3 earnings will be released tomorrow morning before market opens. earnings estimates are .23/share avg, .19/share low, .25/share high.revenue estimate is approx $297.6M. Since NYCB management hasn't issued any business updates since Q2 reporting, we can only guess what the Q3 results will be. Of course, the status of the loan deferrals/defaults is key, as well as loan growth, NIM, NII, and expense management.Many other regional banks that have already reported share a similar pattern: Hit/Beat Q3 EPS numbers. Q3 Revenue a little light. Q3 loan deferrals much improved over Q2. NIM slightly less than Q2, due to lower interest rates. Still not providing Q4 forward guidance, due to economic uncertainty.Remember that the Q3 results are in the past. It is important to hit the estimates, but the current state of the business & forward guidance will move the stock price. To obtain a clearer picture of NYCB, download the Q3 earnings presentation from the website & listen to that 8:30 AM conference call, especially the Q&A section. Good Luck to all."
"I’m not a pumper by a long shot but I just think this is one of the best dividend generating stocks in it’s sector, in fact I sold my GE holdings yesterday and bought NYCB !"
We should be approaching 13 soon. 15-16 at least by years end. The market may finally starting to believe in the future of NYCB!
Looks like they sold me 2000 shares $10. Still have a buy for 8000 more. They will have a tough time shorting through those shares. Even if they do so I get 10000 more shares @$10. Works for me!
The Huge volume Robert mentioned is a very good sign as once again 4 million shares traded all day until the last few minutes when smart money came in and bought 10 million shares. 14 million on the day is twice the daily average.Any news or a JPM upgrade and we pop $1
"As it relates to management capitulation it involves both parties to an agreement not just NYCB's management. Both parties have to have similar goals and ideas for the combined companies going forward which can be difficult. They both have to relent for the good of their shareholders.Joe is at a stage where he will probably want to retire in the not so distant future. However, he wants to make sure he is comfortable with the financials of the other company as well as the ability for the other company's management to have a good. working relationship with NYCB's management. Agreeing on management positions and dividend payout etc are things that are worked out in the deal book.As they say banks are sold not bought."
"Alot of information to digest this morning as I was expecting NYCB earnings to be released on Wednesday 4/28, not this morning. Plus I see that NYCB has finally announced an acquisition so even more information process as I am definitely not familiar with FlagStar Bank."
"KBW named 16 banks they think will outperform. No NYC-area banks were on the list except SBNY. They do see the whole banking sector doing well though, but NYCB’s quasi-rival SBNY — not NYCB — is a top pick. MS analysts now rate NYCB shares equal-weight with an $11.50 PT."
Traditionally NYCB has acquired banks/assets to fund their niche lending strategy. As we have seen in the past NYCB has growth stunted when there is a short term interest rate raising cycle combined with their lack of loan diversification. Going forward NYCB should pivot to combine with another institution that isn't liability sensitive like they are and has a more diversified income stream. I know the Fed may be on hold raising short term rates but rates may go up sooner than anticipated and then NYCB is again exposed to lower earnings and the cycle begins again unfortunately.If NYCB does combine with such a stated institution I'm hoping that they could maintain their strong dividend yield.
If only my girlfriend loved me as much as this guy Sol loves NYCB stock...
Shorts are sweating  now. Lol 
"@Scott Eranger - Here is my take on the current NYCB situation:NYCB & all regional banks depressed currently due to low FED interest rates, high unemployment, high small/medium business failures. In the past few weeks, the 7/31 expiration of the stimulus package & FED keeping interest rates low even if some inflation occurs have put additional downward pressure on banks.NYCB is primarily owned by institutions/mutual funds (approx 63%) & these institutions have been selling off NYCB shares. The largest ones own millions of shares. As I've said previously, The $6 billion in loan deferrals with only a $18 million loan loss reserve is a huge exposure that makes it difficult to invest in NYCB now.As usual, NYCB investors are not provided any information as to the business status of Q3. They will need to wait approx 2 months for the next earnings report.Daily traded share volume for NYCB has been higher than average for a while now. Maybe someone is accumulating, hard to tell. There is more sellers than buyers.Here is a link that has information on top NYCB institutional/mutual fund holders with additions/reductions;https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=NYCB&subView=institutional"
As expected we beat estimates by 2 cents. NIM was better than expected and the loans should start to reaccelerate going forward. Lets hear more clarity from Joe & #$%$ the conference call!
Something is very wrong here with the relationship with Wall Street. This has under performed the market during a bull run never seen before. Until changes are made this goes nowhere regardless of market conditions.
There really trying there best not to let this get above $12.80 constant shares on the ask every time it gets near there. Merger arbitrage I guess and not much volume for such a strong day in the markets. with 10 year t bill at 1.40% and up 5.77% on the day
"Scott,I have been involved with NYCB for 12-15 years and I have traded this stock on average 10-15 times a year for this many years increments of 300-1000 shares each time I have collected dividends on 350 shares that I have held since 2008. I have another 150 shares I purchased in 2017 at a much lower price. Anyway, this stock moves up and down, .10-.30 cents a day. Sometimes, in a week or two weeks, it will be up $1-2. There were a few times where I owned between 5,000-10000 shares at a time. Never lost money yet and lately I do not buy and sell as many shares as before. Currently, I am long about 1,350 shares. If it drops below 9.25 or so, I will purchase another lot of 500-1000 shares. They have a niche market, coop buildings with tenants and they are not in the single family mortgage area, do not have to worry about FX, do not have to worry about tariffs and interest rates are in a good spot. Now, the main issue for me is their management. Are they going do do something that is bad for the company? I do not know. There have been rumors of a potential buy out by another bank, hearsay or truth, I do not know. Pays a nice dividend which was much better five years ago at $1.00 and now only .68 cents a share, earnings barely cover the dividend by .10-.15 a year. I think relative to many other companies and stocks out there, fairly safe, but one never knows."
"I see they got the $ 300 million loan. Not a great rate. They are paying more than they charge for loans they make. and a 4 million dollar fee for the loan, I know it is a different type of loan but they are sitting on cash they stated they are earning 1.99%. I am no banker but something seems off. I guess the street is right and the stock price reflects mgmts decisions."
"Yes, UBS downgraded NYCB this morning, from BUY to NEUTRAL & adjusted price target to $11 from $13. Analyst just stated the obvious, not a significant bail-out downgrade. Lots of volatility with banks today - the 10-year TBill yields are fluctuating significantly & NYCB is coming off of ex-dividend date yesterday.IMO, NYCB will be in limbo until T Cangemi comes up with a strategy for transforming the bank. He's only been CEO for a little over a month, so give him a break. He'll need time. NYCB annual investors meeting is usually in early June. He better have a strategy by then."
It may be funds have been selling NYCB because they believe the Fed will be forced to raise rates as soon as the fall. Hopefully this increase in inflation is transitory and recedes in the coming months.Though the Flagstar merger doesn't totally eliminate NYCB's susceptibility to increased short term rates it does as expressed by the bank's presentation adds more core deposits and less wholesale funding.If I can remember it was expressed that the increase in short term rates would increase interest income based on Flagstar's products/loan portfolio.I would like to hear management's comment regarding the affect on higher short term rates for the combined companies on the virtual annual meeting.
Director Rosenfeld buys another 20000 shares
I Feel very confident about the future of this company going forward.
I'm a small investor in NYCB for the past 2 years and have never seen a stock so manipulated. No reason for the price drop and volume today without any public news. Someone knows something (inside info) or they are trying to manipulate people out of their positions.
"Just received my proxy, and voted out the entire board."
What a beautiful stock!
What will it take to get new leadership here. Time for a change long overdue.
Great news for a Monday morning; a merger and increased earnings!
Merger approved by the shareholders as expected. I presume the same from Flagstar's shareholders!
"In addition to NYCB Q2 earnings tomorrow, overall market should be volatile this week with all the large cap Q2 earnings coming out this week. FED chairman Powell will be speaking tomorrow at 2PM EST. If he even hints at raising interest rates or curtailing their bond repurchase program, markets will react. Raising rates will be good for banks."
Probably till the middle of October this market is going to get destroyed.
This is the reason for weakness for NYCB today.Also for some reason Joe did not conduct presentation today in London. Hoping his health is ok. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nyc-exposed-banks-fall-wedbush-153416014.html
This Covid vaccine news from Moderna this morning should further serve to solidify NYCB's move to engage in merger/acquisition discussions. But NYCB might have to wait until their stock increases to give it a better currency to make an outright takeover of another bank. Or they may prefer to do a merger of equals with another bank. Either way the deal will have to accretive to tangible book and earnings to make sense.The fog is lifting and it is only a matter of time before NYCB makes a move. Lets move the needle guys and get this stock on an sustained upward move!
When a shareholder receives additional shares as part of a dividend reinvestment plan do these shares add to the total share count of a company? If so wouldn't it be dilutive to EPS?

The review was conducted through a portfolio review discussion held on 2 February 2021 in which Moody's reassessed the appropriateness of the ratings in the context of the relevant principal methodology(ies), recent developments, and a comparison of the financial and operating profile to similarly rated peers. The review did not involve a rating committee. Since 1 January 2019, Moody's practice has been to issue a press release following each periodic review to announce its completion.This publication does not announce a credit rating action and is not an indication of whether or not a credit rating action is likely in the near future. Credit ratings and outlook/review status cannot be changed in a portfolio review and hence are not impacted by this announcement. For any credit ratings referenced in this publication, please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com for the most updated credit rating action information and rating history.Key rating considerations are summarized below.New York Community Bancorp, Inc.'s (NYCB) long term issuer and subordinate debt ratings of Baa3 and New York Community Bank's A3 long-term deposit rating reflect the bank's baa2 Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA) and the application of Moody's advanced loss given failure analysis to its assumed liabilities at failure.The bank's BCA of baa2 incorporates NYCB's most significant credit challenge of its large commercial real estate (CRE) exposure, which is primarily multi-family lending and constitutes the vast majority of its loans. NYCB's CRE concentration, which equaled almost 10 times its tangible common equity as of 30 September 2020, is the highest among US rated banks. A mitigant is that most of the bank's CRE is NYCB's multifamily mortgage lending, which is collateralized by primarily rent-regulated properties that have supported good asset quality performance through economic cycles. Moody's does not expect that the 2019 New York rent regulation changes or the more recent coronavirus-related downturn will materially damage NYCB's credit performance. NYCB's annual net charge-offs (NCOs) peaked at 0.35% in 2011, which was well below US peers. For the subsequent years through 2020, it had minimal net charge-offs. Since the increase in the systemically important financial institution (SIFI) asset-size threshold in 2018, NYCB's organic growth has accelerated and we expect that NYCB may also consider bank acquisitions.This document summarizes Moody's view as of the publication date and will not be updated until the next periodic review announcement, which will incorporate material changes in credit circumstances (if any) during the intervening period.The principal methodology used for this review was Banks Methodology published in November 2019. Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.This announcement applies only to EU rated, UK rated, EU endorsed and UK endorsed ratings. Non EU rated, non UK rated, non EU endorsed and non UK endorsed ratings may be referenced above to the extent necessary, if they are part of the same analytical unit.This publication does not announce a credit rating action.

ISBC announced a small transaction last night whereby they acquired branches that will be accretive to earnings but be slightly dilutive to tangible book. I know NYCB doesn't like to make acquisitions that dilute tangible book but Tom Cangemi said it was possible the bank would possibly consider it.ISBC's latest move may be the start of the unthawing of local regional bank transaction activity. This may be another catalyst to move these bank shares higher and in particular NYCB's.
"Investors Bank is getting bought out by Citizens Bank in a cash & stock deal so it looks like the interest in the NY banks is heating up. As you may recall, Citizens was the eventual winner in HSBC's sale of numerous branches/deposits that many thought NYCB would partake in."
Looks like a solid 2nd quarter earnings report. Ex merger related charges & NYS tax change they would have beat at 33 cents so I don't know if this was modeled into the analyst numbers.Looking forward to hear what Tom & Co. have to say about future financial metrics and the merger with Flagstar!
WOW where is the bottom?
"Rising rates, merger completion and short squeeze will push NYCB to high teens shortly. Hold on for nice ride."
Hard to believe this bank could be bought out at 5 billion.
"Bank Q4 earnings season starts tomorrow 1/15 with some large banks reporting - JPM, C, WFC, PNC. NYCB reports 2020 Q4 earnings on Wed 1/27. Average consensus is approx .26/share earnings & $301 million revenue. While 4Q earnings numbers are important to hit, it is in the past. The forward guidance & loan loss status needs to be positive news also to support the huge run-up in share price recently. Any changes to the business model would be nice, but I believe that T Cangemi may wait until the annual shareholders meeting in May/June to announce these types of changes."
"Best month for NYCB shareholders in a long, long time.Earnings report will tell us all we need to know for 2019.Everything pointing to meeting estimates, it would be great to beat by a penny!"
"A few observations and comments about the shareholder meeting this morning:1. There was a lengthy discussion and questions concerning the rent control legislature that will terminate on June 15. Joe F. pointed out that, based on their feedback from Albany and their lobbyists, the law will not pass or at worst, there will be a compromise. Management analysis is that, either way, NYCB will be benefit from this situation because NYCB has a more conservative multi family lending model than the other banks in the same business. (To be honest, I understood Joe’s explanation, but I am not able to properly explain it here without create confusion.) If this legislature passes or there is a compromise, management believes that other banks will be hurt by this and benefit NYCB by the increased share in the multi family apartment market. All in all, management is very confident either way, but admitted that there could be a perception or a misunderstanding by the Street on the impact of the new legislature. 2. There is a strong desire to do an acquisition and sounded that something is in the pipeline. 3. Someone asked about Joe retiring and said that he has not set a date, however, the BOD sets that.4. Most of BOD members were there and I estimate that the average age is about late seventies, early eighties. Some of them flew in from their retirement enclave at our cost, but who is counting!!5. Joe and the management team is keenly aware of the decrease in shareholder value and no one is pleased with it and said that it is their duty and responsibility to reverse the negative trend. He believes that the acquisition route will help increase shareholder value. 6. As a final observation, this was the same message that was given at the quarterly reviews, except for the rent control update…..financials are blah, blah, share market blah, blah, efficiency ratio better than peers, blah etc, etc. My opinion is that management is making a lot of money, BOD is fat and happy and don’t want to rock the boat, so until new blood comes in, this will be the same. Just my thoughts and observations"
"This says it all regarding the pace of merger activity coming soon. It is only a matter of time for NYCB to be a participant!Banking M&A Headed for Big Bounce, Say AnalystsCarpenter Wellington PLLCCarpenter Wellington PLLC logoUSA November 17 2020There’s going to be a dramatic increase in merger and acquisition activity in the American banking sector, according to a recent report from investment manager FJ Capital.Research shows that community and regional bank M&A has already recovered more rapidly than anticipated, says FJ Capital. The investment manager expects recovery will improve further as the broader economy heals from the impact of the pandemic.A continued period of bank M&A activity could result in a drop in the the total number of banks in the United States. The drop could be as much as 50% over the next 10-15 years, the report says. The total value and number of banking M&A deals in 2020 is at its lowest point since 2009, FJ Capital’s research showed. This nadir comes on the heels of last year’s combined M&A deal value of roughly $60 billion—the highest since 2007.The investment firm notes that it expected a fall in deals because it’s typical in recessionary periods; however, the company also predicted a subsequent rebound as the economy starts to once again gain ground. It also found that extremely low interest rates were beginning to reduce the profit margins of smaller banks in particular.“Our expectations are that activity will begin to pick up in the first half of 2021 and accelerate through the year and continue to be robust over the next 3-5 years,” FJ Capital said. They believe that the banking industry has reached a turning point in the credit cycle and is hitting a “positive inflection point” in community and regional banks."
"Anybody watching the price spread between NYCB and FBC?According to the merger specifications, FBC shareholders are to receive 4.0151 shares of NYCB, and presently, FBC share price seems to be lagging slightly, which seems a little odd. Might be a risk free chance to make a little money trading back and forth for big shareholders."
"Mortgage Bankers Association reported that 24% of the 3.4 million households it has in forbearance have made payments. That’s some good news. In bad news, GNMA still has 9.2% of loans in forbearance now, down from 11.8%, and its only down because other servicers bought the loans at issue. Seems to me like we’ll only resolve this issue plaguing banks by creating jobs. I look forward to NYCB explaining their numbers in greater detail. Right now we just have the whopper than loan to value is unchanged even as NYC real estate craters. So, hopefully bulls and bears alike get more clarity."
"Traded down the 0.17 cents we get paid at the end of the month, yesterday. (Ex date).Made that back today. Showing strength after years of a floundering stock price.Strategy to increase NIM and make an acquisition make it a lot easier to park money here than it has been in the past number of years."
What a beautiful dividend stock
"I have been a long investor at NYCB for over 20 years and finally this past week I pulled the plug!!!. With Apple (AAPL) splitting 4:1 a/o 8/28/20, with the sale of NYCB, I bought AAPL. In selling NYCB, I took a loss (I can use some capital losses this year), but buying AAPL I believe it has a greater chance in increasing in value than continuing owning NYCB. As a matter of fact, in just one week I have reduced some of the NYCB losses already. I expected NYCB to make a run, but with the NYC economy falling apart, I can’t see NYCB coming back. NYCB management and Board have been unable to reposition the bank and able to change a business model that maybe it had its best days. They have made promises upon promises about increasing shareholder value, but my value for the past 20 years has gone down, even with a decent dividend. Also, if they sell out, I cannot see them getting no more than a 10% premium on their share price because its business niche (multifamily apartments in the NYC market) is decaying. Whatever premium they may get is from the fact that they have the NY/NJ foot print, once a premium market, but no more now and for the foreseeable future. I believe that it will take a long time for the NY/NJ economy to get back to its hay days (only 6 months ago!!!). With the state of the economy, the loan losses anticipated as a result of businesses going under, low rates for the next 4-6 quarters, I can’t see banks risking investing in mergers and acquisitions, so I see NYCB being a dead duck.I wish everyone the best of luck and hope something good will come out of this!!!!...All the best!!"
Did I tell you guys here yesterday? Who missed out this rocket up today? LOL
The march upwards should continue through DRIP day which is on 17th/18th.
"Have a look at the 5 year chart. Makes me nauseous. Like all CEO's, Joe says he's creating ""long term shareholder value."" What's long term Joe? Ten years? Twenty years? I'll be in an urn by then."
Still trading below book value $12.83Jan. 2019 a month to remember
With a price/book of .92 some of the 48.68 million shorts would be wise to cover.
Just bought NYCB shares today.
Can someone tell me what this means ? Thank You New York Community Bank Provides Real-Time Payment Processing Utilizing The Provenance Blockchain For Figure Technologies Inc. Secondary Trading
"Even if the proposed NYCB deal to acquire FlagStar gets shareholder approval, do you believe that it will receive regulatory approval?I don't like to get political, but we have already witnessed a major $30 billion insurance broker deal get scrapped due to Biden's tough stance of mergers and acquisitions, especially in banking.What do you think?"
"Now that the Fiserv conversion is scheduled to be completed for the end of August (8/24/20 precisely), I am more optimistic that an acquisition/merger will be announced soon after. I am sure that they already have a list of potential acquisitions, merger of equals, large and small banks including multiple acquisitions. Just my opinion....your thoughts"
"Buyback should result in purchasing aprox. 33 million shares at today's price. Should help support the stock and maybe push it back toward $10. The buyback should also save NYCB aprox $20 million in dividend costs minus whatever their costs are to fund the buyback. With all the banks getting crushed, it seems to me that NYCB should go shopping. Buying a bank like VLY would increase its footprint and give it a more varied business model. NYCB has been a big disappoint these past couple of years. Let's hope things start to turn around."
"BoAML reiterated a BUY w a price target of 12.50 yesterday. On a separate note, I was watching the print yesterday and w 10 minutes left in the day NYCB stock saw almost 3 million shares traded. This pushed the price up another .05 cents. Tells me the pros are buying it."
Could we see NYCB at $25-26 if this blockchain affiliation and unique business opportunity take off?Signature Bank plays in the cryptocurrency and blockchain world and they presently have a P/E Ratio of 20! NYCB's P/E currently sits just above 10 meaning that this stock could be seriously undervalued if the business opportunity takes off!What do you think! Feel free to share your insights on the cryptocurrency and blockchain business opportunities!
Wondering which institution NYCB is in current discussions with. I believe they would like to acquire lower costing funding deposits and sell off the loan portfolio if it doesn't fit their needs. The bank doesn't have to be in the local NY market area for it to work.They could also do an in market deal(merger of equals) but determining management teams and control is always problematic. If Joe and the board have to give up control it would have to be an outright sale. The only way they would feel comfortable with this if the dividend rate were maintained and the other bank had great prospects.
Should be interesting to hear what Tom says tomorrow at the virtual annual meeting!
In at 8.80 since the day after Christmas. Plan is to just pick up shares quarterly on dividends.
Ever who in China .
Piper Sandler just upgraded NYCB with a price target of 12.50. I'm sure there will be more upgrades to come!With an increasing price NYCB's currency becomes that more attractive to other potential targets. If they can pull off an accretive transaction this will really put a charge into the stock!
Bought today on a strong recommendation from a friend! This one was hiding from me! Hopefully a Good entry point today!
"Any idea why it is tanking today. No news, earnings are announced next week, volume is unusually heavy so early in the day...does someone know something (negative) that we don't know?"
"Recently retired. Looking to build a retirement portfolio of stocks with high dividend yield. I see NYCB paid a consistent one dollar per share annual payout from 2004 thru 2016. After the merger with Astoria fell through the dividend was slashed to 68 cents annually and has remained at 68 cents annually . I am trying to get a better handle as to why the merger with Astoria fell through; apparently they did not receive regulatory approval. Did the merger falling through cause financial harm to NYCB?........why was the NYCB divvy slashed after the merger fell through?...........also, could we expect regulatory issues if NYCB tries to go after another NYC metro regional bank like FFIC or DCOM? Thanks for keeping me in the loop."
same pattern as yesterday. Selling off near the close.
"Cangemi named as chairman of the board; Levine retires ‘for personal reasons’. Purely from the perspective of preserving one’s own power, this seems to reduce the chance that Cangemi would self-demote himself in a tie-up; I think NYCB is much more likely to be an acquirer than acquired."
What are the board's thought initial acquisition of Flagstar Bank? It appears to be savings bank but hoping it can add new products and services for varied income streams and improve their funding profile.Lets see what Tom has to say on the CC!
"New York Community sets sights on M&ABy Allissa KlineJanuary 27, 2021, 4:00 p.m. ESTNew York Community Bancorp is hunting for merger partners in an effort to remix its deposit funding base and transform itself into a full-service commercial bank.With a new CEO for the first time in 28 years, the Westbury, N.Y., company intends to focus on multifamily lending but says it is considering myriad ways to attract lower-cost deposits, including adding more products and services that would lead to stickier relationships and hiring teams of bankers from rival firms.But the real shift will happen by merging with or acquiring another bank, President and CEO Thomas Cangemi said.Building a future ready financial enterpriseGet the latest news, analysis and resources on the future of digital banking, and the potential of an integrated banking enterprise.Speaking to analysts in an earnings call Wednesday, Cangemi said the company is committed to diversifying its balance sheet “over time” and is not interested in building a business line “from scratch.”“We’re going to partner [because] partnerships will get it done a lot quicker and will make rational sense,” he said.Cangemi took over as CEO of the $56.3 billion-asset New York Community just four weeks ago after longtime CEO Joseph Ficalora abruptly retired at the end of December. Industry watchers have been curious about how Cangemi, previously the company’s chief financial officer, might diversify the funding mix, which for years has been heavily skewed toward higher-cost certificates of deposit.At the end of 2020, CDs accounted for nearly a third of New York Community’s $32.4 billion deposit book, according to the company’s latest quarterly presentation. The Federal Reserve’s interest-rate reduction in March gave the company a chance to start repricing CDs at lower costs, but analysts have said that making a traditional bank deal would be the fastest way to cut deposit costs and, in turn, generate more profit.New York Community hasn’t completed an acquisition since March 2010. A bid to acquire Astoria Financial in Lake Success, N.Y., fell through in December 2016, more than a year after it was announced.One of its key challenges in finding a merger partner is the value of its shares. New York Community’s stock has generally underperformed in recent years and now trades at 80% of its book value. Shares were trading at $10.69 late Wednesday, down 2.5% from Tuesday’s closing price.As it waits for the right deal to come along, the company is focusing on making better use of its 236-office branch network, which is spread across five states but predominantly in the New York metropolitan area.That means tapping those branches to deepen relationships and bring in core deposits, Cangemi said.“I’ve been saying this for years: The low-lying fruit of the full relationship lending is out there,” he said. “If you have a very wealthy family who is looking for a line of credit — and we tend not to service lines of credit — that’s an easy exercise for us. We know the customer. We know the opportunity.”There’s also a focus on acquiring banking teams from other companies that could help the company move into new business lines. New York Community built its specialty financing this way and as of Dec. 31 that segment accounted for about 7% of its loan portfolio, with $3.2 billion of outstanding loans and $4.8 billion in commitments.“We’re looking at all unique things in the marketplace and we’re very comfortable, like we did with specialty finance, bringing in a team of people from the outside, management left out,” Cangemi said.The new strategy was met Wednesday with approval by some of those who follow the company.Mark Fitzgibbon, an analyst at Piper Sandler, said in a note to clients that management appears to be “focused on finding a value-creating M&A opportunity to help speed the transformation of the company” and expects it “will be disciplined on pricing” for any such deal.“In short we have confidence in management’s ability to grow earnings, smartly evolve the mix of business...and do prudent M&A,” Fitzgibbon wrote.The company's fourth-quarter net income rose 87% from a year earlier, to $189.7 million. Earnings per share were 39 cents, beating the consensus estimate of 26 cents from analysts surveyed by FactSet Research Systems.The spike in earnings is tied to a one-time income tax benefit of $55.3 million and a double-digit increase in the net interest margin driven by lower funding costs, including a decrease in the average cost of CDs.Credit-wise, nearly all of the $5.9 billion of multifamily and commercial real estate loans deferred as of June 30 have returned to making payments, leaving $80 million in deferral status, the company reported."
"Some interesting events have occurred in the past couple of days. - CDC announced that all US States should be prepared for covid-19 vaccine distribution by 11/1/2020. - Unemployment numbers were better than expected, although still bad. - There is a news story about how weak the NYC real estate market was in August - Most regional banks finished up slightly yesterday after being weak in the morning. More importantly, there was a lot of buying after 2 PM when the institutions trade. This hasn't happened in weeks. - Large Cap growth & tech stocks have been amazingly strong for a while. Yesterday saw some profit taking in these stocks. That money needs to go somewhere, maybe a sector rotation to bank stocks if vaccine news is good & economy improves .Might be a good time to start new positions in regional bank stocks. Whether or not NYCB is a good candidate or other regionals are better choices is for the investors/traders to decide."
They beat by 1 cent. It’s a miracle. Should close above 12 today.
Aug and Sept were great months to add shares of this stock with over 5% dividend. Buying the dips will bring you back to cash positive within a year adding the 4 quarterly dividends. Feb. ex date coming up so buyers will return for the next payout. 25 million coming back on the books. Will they buy out a smaller financial institution or have a special one time dividend for all shareholders in 2018?
RKT is getting destroyed today on news that their closed mortgage originations are dropping and that they expect this to persist into Q2. That could explain the bad market reaction to NYCB buying a big mortgagee.
"Just hold on here. Kahn added 184,448 shares of NYCB and Deutsche Bank raised the price target to $15.00 a share. Also Morgan Stanley raised the price target from 13 to $14.00. Read the news May 11th that these funds all added to NYCB 1st Trust-Guggenheim-Emerald Mutual Fund-Credit Suisse and Nisa Investment Advisors. Next earnings report won't be until Aug. 4th, 2021."
"As I commented earlier in the week, the upward movement continues both in volume and price, indicating that something is in the works and investors (big boys) want to get in. My opinion has been and still believe that this stock is worth $17-19/share."
What an absolutely beautiful stock!
Few years ago Flagstar took over Wells Fargo in the Mid EastLooking like Flagstar is getting stronger......Now with NYCB
"I listened to the conference call this morning and they sound very bullish. They feel that the new regulation relief will impact, in a positive way, both operating earnings as well as M&A....meanwhile they are sitting on a $2B in cash. Why is this stock tanking? If you listened, I would like to hear your take on the call. Thanks"
"It appears we are heading for at least one more rate cut and maybe two by year end -this is in NYCB's wheelhouse. As discussed on the conference call NIM may start to be positive starting in the third quarter and continue going forward. This means increased ROA, ROI, and thus earnings.This momentum will push the stock price upward and almost certainly begin NYCB's acquisition movement. Be patient folks good things are to come!"
"The Webster-Sterling deal is an acquisition, not a merger of equals. WBS paid a hefty price for STL - about 1.9X tangible book value. It is unknown at this point to know if it will be immediately accretive. They are saying there will be cost savings & synergies with the combined banks, but nothing specific yet. This deal might be driven more by the MTB-PBCT acquisition, WBS will be in a better position to handle the increased competition from MTB-PBCT ."
Awesome dividend stock on its way to being bought out by a major
Could NYCB be talking to Bank United and old friend John Kanas about a merger of equals. I have a feeling that they are close to doing a transaction with another bank. I'm sure they won't do anything that isn't accretive to tangible book and earnings.
So they haven't even bought back any shares yet. They just completed the offering. Which is good. Last week when the stock went up I thought they were buying stock. However I didn't like what I read about the offering. They said they would buy back shares among other things. Other things? Like money for the directors pickets and golf trips?
"Wouldn't normally NYCB be up on a normal trading day like today when the 10 year Treasury is down about 1% as it gives NYCB the opportunity to renew expiring CDs at a lower rate, thus reducing funding costs for rent-controlled loans?Are we down because of the pending marriage with FlagStar Bank as they are interest rate sensitive and thus down on a day like today?If anyone can shed more light on this, it would greatly be appreciated."
I have fears we lose the dividend with the merger. Zero faith in this BOD they always seem to do the unexpected.
"NYCB in Barron’s today, in a story on high-yielding mid-caps:New York Community Bancorp, whose shares are down 25% this year, to around $9, tops the list with a 6.8% yield. The stock has been hit by concerns about its exposure to the tough New York City real estate market. The company is a leading lender to owners of rent-regulated apartment buildings. Credit quality, however, has remained strong, and the bank is conservative in its lending standards.KBW analyst Collyn Gilbert has an Outperform rating and $13.50 price target on the stock, arguing in a recent note that the bank’s high returns and position as “one of the leading multifamily lenders in the country” merit a premium valuation."
New York Community to Issue 4.0151 Shares for Each Flagstar Share >NYCB FBC
joe leak something that is financial not biological
Some of the 47.56 million shorts must be seriously thinking about covering today.
NYCB vs AMZNCangemi & Pinto have NYCB firing on all cylinders since taking over as part of the major management change at NYCB!YTD3.5% return for AMZN vs 25.1% return for NYCB 1 YEAR 8.9% return for AMZN vs 60.5% return for NYCB DON'T LOOK AT THE 5 YEAR FIGURES!
All my regional banks have been on a roll lately. Paying good dividends to boot.
"Cangemi, Pinto and Wann should be looking at the bank's next acquisition. I wonder how much input Sandro, the new Chairman of the combined entity will have over merger and acquisition matters. I predict that they will go after NBT Bancorp out of New York to squeeze out some efficiencies via the branch network in New York, while at the same time expanding into different states including Pennsylvania, Vermont, Massachusetts, Maine, Connecticut and New Hampshire for geographical diversification. The deal would only require about half of what will be spent on FlagStar Bank, but give it an instant presence in New England and the opportunity for more Commercial and Industrial Loans along with agricultural loan exposure to diversify the bank's loan book."
Looking forward to the close of the merger sometime from the mid to late October. It is upward and onward from there!
Silent Sal the IR dunce promoted to EVP and Chief of Staff. The Peter Principle in action. His Italian heritage had nothing to do with it. Thank you Dom Cangemi!!
Earnings call sounded great.
Seems like the market is quite neutral about this change based on the volume and flat price. The problem is the business model!!!
"Still undervalued at current level with the pending acquisition of FlagStar Bank and transformation of the business model!YTD and over the last 12 months, NYCB is outperforming AMZN!"
I think the vaccine news today is a turning point for NYCB. With the possibility on some form of stimulus and a vaccine on the near horizon this puts a floor on NYCB's operations. Now they must again turn to an accretive merger/acquisition that can move the needle. What I'd like to see them do is combine with another institution that brings a more diversified income stream and be less liability sensitive then NYCB is currently.Hopefully this can happen within the next four months or so!
Dividend is a beautiful thing
When is next dividend ?
What is the deal this is suppose to be a value stock with a dividend but acts like a tech stock on a sell off day. It’s the upside down world at NYCB.
"K, Dividend percentage is based on what price you pay for the stock, not where it is trading. If you buy it at a that the dividend per share equates to 7%, then it will always be 7% for you, unless the dollar amount paid per share changes. Others may get a higher or lower percentage return, depending how much they pay per share."
As usual earnings Exactly matched zacks estimates just like the previous 4 quarters reports. I'm glad we are still inside the upward trend since 20-June. We are on the way up to hit the year-high level that we hit in march at $12.51. Watching it very closely and also having this biotech company on my Radar as well https://emergingstocks.market/9sncl
Looks like the initial pop after the news of Joe retiring was due to the market thinking a merger was not too far away. It then reversed course with the help of analyst opinions that Tom will try to enhance shareholder value by adding more specialty finance and accretive acquisitions which isn't too far off of what NYCB's current strategy is. What I would like to see is NYCB acquire finance companies that add more reoccurring fee income.
Bank mergers begin BBT and Sun trust deal will shine a light on NYCB!
"Q3 earnings reporting season starts tomorrow for banks. For regionals, first to report are FRC on 10/13 & USB, PNC on 10/14. These regionals are some of the larger, best managed banks, their earnings reports/forward guidance can be an indication of the other regionals Q3 performance. Not all the regionals have the same risks - different loan portfolio make-up & geographic risks.Large banks also report this week - JPM, GS, C, BAC, MS, BK, & WFC.NYCB doesn't report until 10/28 & has been weak throughout Q3. It is approx 65% owned by institutions & they have obviously been dumping NYCB. The largest holder of NYCB is Barrow Hanley Mewhinney & Strauss LLC with over 53 million shares (11.47% of outstanding shares). If I were them, I would be putting serious pressure on management to do something to get my investment's performance significantly improved.NYCB also has a significant amount of shares short - over 6% of float. If Q3 report is positive, there could be a quick, sharp short-covering rise in the share price.Remember that quarterly earnings reports are more than last quarter's EPS - that is in the past.The forward guidance is more important to overall stock direction."
"NYCB & all banks can'e even give guidance for Q3 2020 let alone year-end guidance. Any prediction of 2020 year-end share price is just a wild guess for entertainment purposes only. My wild guess is $9.00.The next large challenge for NYCB will be in OCT/NOV when the $6 billion 180-day loan deferrals will become due. There is a document on the NYCB website in the INVESTOR RELATIONS section called ""Second Quarter 2020 Investor Presentation"". Every NYCB shareholder should read it, but page 17 summarizes NYCB exposure to potential loan losses. NYCB has approx $38 billion in multi-family/CRE loans outstanding & approx $6 billion are in 180 day payment deferral. 15.5%of total loans. That is a huge exposure."
"Breach of Fiduciary Duty by Board of Directors. Since Oct 28 2015 (the Astoria decision which many shareholders opposed) NYCB has been on a nice downward slope. Stock is now trading 48% lower than at that date and dividend has dropped 32%. No reduction, much less no commensurate reduction, in compensation of Joe and the other officers, responsible for this debacle. By what metrics does the Board of Directors evaluate their performance? Has the Board of Directors breached its fiduciary duty to shareholders by not requiring, after 4 years failure to correct this mess, a commensurate reduction in executive compensation?"
Net Interest Margin improvement should be reflected in fourth quarter earnings. Also of importance is the loan volume and a reversal of last quarters loan refinancing lost to the GSES. If we can see positive indications from the loan volume and refinancing this stock can begin a sustained upward trajectory. If they are somehow able to do an accretive transaction then we will be off to the races - we can only hope!
Next stop 13 for NYCB. By years end we should be between 15-16 if not higher.
Why the selling today - is it just profit taking or was there a news story out?
"Between flagstar and nycb, i think stocking up with nycb is more practical"
"Still Undervalued at today's levels, but great to see the stock climb over $12 on the 2nd quarter earnings report and outlook with FlagStar Bank.Would love to see NYCB go after BankUnited out of Florida after the FlagStar acquisition gets full regulatory approvals if BankUnited hasn't already made a deal. Bank United would provide growth and make the AMTrust branch network more efficient in Florida. Investors Bank out of New Jersey just announced a deal with Citizens Bank so that takes them out of the equation in regards to a future partner to squeeze out savings via a more efficient branch network. Could Valley Bank be another opportunity for NYCB?"
"FED released the results of their 2nd Bank Stress Tests after market close today. Results were very good, banks are generally well capitalized to withstand any loan defaults. The restriction on Bank share buybacks was lifted but buyback amount cannot exceed trailing 12 month earnings. Great news for banks, especially those with solid earnings. Most banks up big in after-hours trading.Not sure if NYCB would consider a buyback to increase EPS and share price."
"The best bank in the US?New York Community Bank (the ""Bank"") was named the number one bank in the country for best overall customer experience based on a survey conducted by American Banker and creative experience firm Monigle. American Banker and Monigle collaborated to survey 8,500 U.S. consumers aged 18 and older, who evaluated financial institutions on the primary factors believed to drive satisfaction. The study included a variety of institutions including retail banks, online banks, and challenger banks."
Good morning BobbyNSomething right going on here. Congratulations My Jab stock has done well also. PFE
"Since I have been following this stock and also own it, this has been by far, the best quarter I have ever seen. I admit and thought that they were going to miss and see a 10% drop, but they proved me wrong!!!... and now is up almost 10%. I listened to the conference call and despite COVID19 issues, they remain very positive and strongly believe that they will gain market share as the competition retreats from the multi family lending business. My sincerest best wishes to them (from one that has been very critical in the past) and hope that this is the beginning of consecutive positive quarters!!"
Changes to the 1031 tax exchange process will not be touched as per the House Ways and Means Committeein negotiations regarding the 3.5 trillion dollar bill!
C-BAC-WFC all up. This is a stable sector in a recession.
$16 is coming its in the chart year end either from good news or a buyout
"Let’s see, hmmm, the supposed “Best Bank” for whom? I would argue that the Best Bank for customers is likely to be the worst bank for investors. I believe that NYCB has proven this thesis.What say you, Silent Sal, the IRO hiding under his desk!"
Stock should take off . Maybe after one more good quarter
imo the negativity surrounding the new york city rental market and the deferrals until october or november is keeping the stock down even though earnings and tangible book value have remained in tact . hopefully this earnings report and the conference call will be reassuring. even banks and hedge funds are starting to upgrade and accumulate
In Credit Suisse's latest note on NYCB they are seeing a pick up in CRE loans from in the fourth quarter through Nov. 15th. Hopefully this trend will continue!
"Holding 5k shares under $9. No worries, will not sell till $15."
"I am assuming those who answer my posts are shareholders in this company. I would be shocked if anyone had a profit, but I know there are long-time shareholders out there. Since the market has plummeted, I have sold nothing, I have probably 60 stocks in my portfolio. I feel compelled however, to look at each stock far more closely now. I have wrestled with nycb for a long time. there are no catalysts that I can see. the dividend is nice, but I see nothing attractive about the company any longer. When they report, how can anyone expect anything positive? at some price, this might be ""bargain, ""but I think we see $3.00 before $10.00. Why are people holding? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated?"
April jobs report came out this morning & the job growth figure missed badly. 10 year treasuries reacted by going down over 5% to 1.49% yield. Banks are initially down in pre-market because of this.We may be in for a volatile trading day....
"Overreaction on an article by Peter Winter who should be sued by NYCB and looked at by the SECNYCB is a dividend play, with the highest yield in the KBW index, so the only question is whether any legislative changes will reduce earnings to the point where a cut is justified. Rent control is not a major issue for the NY properties that NYCB is involved. Refi activity may dip slightly, but multi family building will continue to boom outside the city - as well as in NJ, AZ, FL and OH where they also operate. Huge overreactio"
"Many on this board seems to think that NYCB is going to be acquired in the near future. Current NYCB tangible book value is $9.29/share. An acquiring bank would never value NYCB at an approx 65% premium over TBV, as some suggest. I don't believe that NYCB wants to sell out at $10 -$13, which seems more realistic based upon today's price & TBV.IMO, NYCB has to clean up its current balance sheet & deferred loan problems in order to get its stock price up to justify a higher buyout valuation. This may take some time.Remember that an acquiring bank needs to get the buyout approved by their board of directors. PNC bank was the regional bank with a boatload of cash for acquisitions & they just announced a $11.6 billion acquisition of the USA assets of BBVA, so that money is now off the table."
With the projected 16 percent accretion to earnings in 2022 upon the completion of the merger with FlagstarI don't see why NYCB can't increase the dividend 4 cents a next year and every year after(this is a conservative amount).

"I simply am at a loss on what to do on this investment. we all know the obvious. Since earnings, we have dropped from $11.00 to $9.12, and will not go up, even on decent days in the market.While they certainly haven't blown away earnings, this downward trend has be a bit uneasy. If we break $9.00 (and it looks like we will), what then.Anyone have any rational thoughts on this company? I need $12.00 to be whole. No including all the dividends I've received."
I hope that we aren't having a problem with regulators or the lawsuits in getting this deal through!
"If Wells Fargo is broken up, do you believe that NYCB could be a beneficiary by picking up more branches and lines of business in the West Coast?As you may recall, NYCB will be picking up 4-6 branches and mortgage origination offices in California as a result of the FlagStar Bank acquisition, if my memory serves me well.It may be a long shot, but I can see the government regulators agreeing to dismantle this behemoth as a result of the multiple brazen scandals over the last 2-3 years, which include opening accounts without authorization, closing accounts in an effort to drive up inactivity fees, discriminatory lending, illegal foreclosures, etc.If there is ever a case to break up a bank, this is it as they are big enough to create a major financial meltdown and obviously cannot be trusted by anyone!What do you think? Would NYCB benefit under this scenario?"
"NYCB 2020 Q4 earnings report was positive, they slightly beat both avg earnings & revenue estimates.Not a good day to announce earnings, with the market selling off and the 10-year treasuries weakening further. Negatives that I saw were that Cangemi would not give 2021 forward guidance & there was no definitive plan to change NYCB business model. Cangemi said that NYCB will not start new product lines from scratch, but will merge/acquire other banks. Finding a bank that will expand product lines, add income, and be accretive to TBV is easier said than done. It will be very difficult. On the conference call, Cangemi seemed committed to straightening out the current issues. IMO, he needs to be given a chance - it will take a few quarters minimum."
"Solid Q2 earnings report from NYCB. Still haven't listened to the conference call for future guidance. I think we may have a short-covering rally here. As of July 15, there were over 47 million NYCB shares short - approx 12% of float. Still don't understand why it was so high, but after good Q2 earnings reports from both NYCB and FBC, there is bound to be some short covering."
the new CEO and his vision will get this company out of the stone age.
We are starting to see upgrades with the highest target at 13.50 by KBW. Subsequent positive earnings reports will help move the stock but a merger/acquisition or buyout is what will really move this stock.Under the current conditions I don't see this happening. Probably when the economy re-opens in conjunction with durable effective treatments for COVID-19 will we see business transactions.Until then quarterly financial metrics will have to do!
Ex div Thurs.
Nice article in Barrons with Collyn Gilbert from KBW having a $13.50 price target on NYCB. Upward and onward!
"Bofo, while I am impressed by your banking expertise, I think you tremendously underestimate others. For example, I am a former bank CFO. I totally disagree with your assessment of NYCB’s real estate risk. Their position in rent-controlled assets insulates them from such exposure. Also, while I agree that Key could be a target, there are banks out there with the right retail footprint whom they should acquire. IMHO, NYCB is one of them and also Joe (God bless him) is getting a little long in the tooth. So while I respect your intelligence, I would not discount the knowledge of others by referencing how complicated banking can be. Many of us have more expertise than you, sir!"
"10 year treasuries very strong again today. Opening yield today is approx 1.26%, the highest level since pre-pandemic last year. This will be generally good for bank stocks today.I was looking at NYCB 2020 Q4 financials over the weekend & noticed that NYCB TBV increased from $8.20/share to $8.43/share . A baby step in the right direction."
"With a market breaking every record this year, why is this stock not able to return a decent roi? This management has not been able to create any additional value for us shareholder. For the new year, I am hoping and praying for a shakeup of this management team either by a merger of equal and retain the newer management or a full takeover. It is time that Joe and this management team/BOD are replaced!!! Happy New Year"
$0.17 dividend. Ex date 8/05.
For the first time in a few years I’m optimistic about NYCB. New management and rising interest rates will move this stock much higher. Bargain price right now
