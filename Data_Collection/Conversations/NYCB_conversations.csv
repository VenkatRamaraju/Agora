When the Fed stops buying mortgage backed securities will NYCB crash. I have been a bag holder @$12 for years I don't want to ride it down again. Any thoughts ?
"Value buying below 13, I would not be surprised if we are back to 14 in the short term"
"New York Community Bancorp, Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2021 Diluted EPS Of $0.30 Up 30%, And $0.31 On A Non-GAAP Basis, Up 35% Compared To The Year-Ago Quarter On Good Loan Growth, Higher PPNR, A Stable Net Interest Margin, And Strong Deposit Growth, Continued Double Digit EPS Growth (This is from Yahoo Finance)"
There are significant opportunities with NYCB as the new management is putting a new operating modelin place that will deliver significant benefits for shareholders. A cultural shift from the old hide-bound priormanagement stuck with high cost funding and a fixed and inflexible business structure. To be fair the old management was also constrained by growth limits that are now relaxed. But current management is aggressive and the coming leverage with the interest rate curve will produce spectacular profits for thepatient investor. Short term jitter should be used to accumulate cheaper shares. I plan on adding more sharesto my entry position especially during market jitters. Banks are inflation hedges. I especially like the technology moves.

Just added at $12.40 bringing cost basis up to eleven. Should the price fall under 12 I’ll add more. Thank you Mr Market. Looking to hold for the next five years. Play the long game ladies and gents.

Looking for another financial stock. Already have NYCB and PFS and very happy with both. Had PBCT and sold at the announcement of their merger. Anyone have another suggestion? Dividend is important to me at this point
FLAGSTAR EARNINGS AND REVENUES SURPASS ESTIMATES.Too bad we are still saddled with the merger with NYCB.I never thought it was a good idea to begin with.
Why hasn't yahoo finance posted that NYCB declared a .17c div. as it was reported everywhere else yesterday?? Can you say agenda??
"Not a good Q3 for NYCB. Missed on both earnings & revenue. FBC merger won't close in 2021, are there any regulatory issues? Initial market reaction is bad- NYCB is down $1.25/share. I did not get a chance to listen to the conference call - that will be key. On a positive note, FBC Q3 earnings were very good."
"Bought the dip. NYCB is going to get its deal approved. A slight delay is not unusual. I own TRIL which is being bought by PFE. That deal had a slight delay too, and the stock rebounded nicely. NYCB will benefit on higher rates which seem destined to come. It expansion will help it diversify and get it into new opportunities. The dividend helps a little too.Good luck!"
"A few days ago, should you buy NYCB before earnings. Given that NYCB has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for New York Community, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report"
What a strong recovery in NYCB this morning!! from low of $13.55 right back up to $13.75. yey!
"I haven't had the opportunity to review the quarterly earnings report for NYCB and FlagStar Bank yet, but wondering if today's 10% decline has anything to do with NYCB shareholders bailing out and taking their $2 per share profit and simply moving on to another investment. I heard that the FlagStar deal isn't expected to close by the end of 2021 so this might be what is scaring NYCB as they fear the same results that took place when NYCB tried to buy Astoria and the deal didn't win over regulatory approval before Astoria decided to seek a new partner. The deal might not be getting done in time as there have been many bank mergers and acquisitions that have taken place since the beginning of 2021 so the regulators might be swamped, especially in this Covid-19 work from home environment so the normal slow approval process is obviously going to take much longer than anticipated with all of the inefficiencies related to the pandemic. If the deal takes too long to get approved, FlagStar might get approached with a better offer from another bank that can squeeze out more efficiencies out of the acquisition so that's definitely a risk and it appears as though NYCB is presently being valued as if no deal is taking place.Cangemi's relationship with Sandro from FlagStar will be what determines how patient FlagStar Bank will be before seeking another deal. I don't anticipate the deal falling apart as a new suitor for FlagStar Bank would still have to go through the same process meaning slow approval of the deal plus NYCB's dividend payout is definitely what long-term FlagStar shareholders want!Does anyone know if FlagStar has paid out the remaining balance of the fine imposed by the regulators. I believe they needed to make one more payment as part of their reduced negotiated deal with the regulators. That could be what is holding up the deal plus the fact that each state has to grant regulatory approval so that means, NY, NJ, OH, FL, AZ, MI, WI, CA, etc.The deal could require each state's approval since FlagStar Bank originates mortgages nationwide!"
"On the details of the report, loans 1-3 months past due shot up from $35 mil to $447 mil. Not a good sign. Non-performance declined overall. In terms of hopes for FBC, that wasn’t too pretty either. Net gain on loan sales down over 50%. Things are looking less rosy for NYCB."
"Flagstar Bancorp, Inc. (NYSE: FBC), the holding company for Flagstar Bank, FSB, today announced its board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per share on its common stock. The dividend will be payable November 16, 2021, to shareholders of record at the close of business November 6, 2021."
we are on the cusp of a new base here at 14 once we established that base then north it is gents .I believe in this Team and the new CEO.
"No more taxi medallion loans!Even though the market for these loans is recovering somewhat and there's the potential for the government to pay off, or make the banks write off some of the balances on the taxi medallion portfolio as part of a huge settlement to save the taxi industry, NYCB needs to simply completely write off, or let those loans run off the books and take the appropriate tax write off and put this chapter behind them. The FlagStar Bank acquisition should close by the end of November if all goes well and FlagStar Bank takes care of the outstanding balance that they must pay as part of a settlement with the government for certain mortgage practices that they accidentally overlooked. I expect FlagStar Bank to take care of this fine and disclose such payment as part of their 3rd quarter earnings report. We are touching 52 week highs, but we should be at $15 per share so NYCB is still undervalued, especially when you consider the above-average quarterly dividend which will have more room to grow once the pending deal closes and synergies/cost saves are squeezed out!"
"News Alert!!!!! NYCB 5 year return is now in the green, meaning a positive return over the last 5 years!Cangemi and Pinto plus Sandro DiNello from FlagStar are well on their way to build a nationwide empire!Nationwide Sales Platform to originate mortgage, business and consumer loans, plus the most recent blockchain investment should yield growth and income via NYCB's strong dividend payout and potential for further increases once they squeeze out the synergies from the FlagStar enterprise!"
