Why the huge drop? Can't find anything other than advertisement with Saban.
AFL is up 7.05% to 27.50
Love ya blue got 10 shares NFL not for long AFL??? you bet
Aflac reached a 52 Week low at 30.00
Aflac is increasing their dividend in 2021 from $0.28 per quarter to $0.33
Horrible customer service for an ancillary insurance provider heard co-workers from two different companies complain about getting payments if they filed claims. Their executive leadership seems to have joined the GA boycott on the voting law change as well. I wonder if I can sign up for and then receive a short term disability payout on an Aflac insurance policy without proper identification? Hypocrites......
zacks down graded it to a hold.
AFL is up 9.67% to 35.54
AFL is down 7.63% to 37.67
Absolutely murdered earnings and revenue. So happy to have 15% of my entire portfolio in this stock.
I wonder if the company is buying with both hands today
I just read that Zack's upgraded AFL to a buy rating. Funny thing that the stock has trended lower the last month. Any comments guys?
AFL reached an all time high at 54.56
"Any thoughts on the Japan Post deal? Apparently if they buy about 8% of shares, they will get 20% voting rights w/in 4 yrs (?!). Does anyone think this might be more than just another channel which to sell AFL products through in Japan? Thx."
AFL reached a 52 Week low at 37.84
"OK. Earnings not great, but considering the Covid-19 impact, not bad. Adjusted earnings $1.23 was above estimates of $1.10. Back to $45 over the next few weeks as the Covid-19 panic fades."
They recruit as many agents as they can regardless if they are suitable for a career in the insurance business. You have to be determined and hard nosed to make it. With that being said I've personally seen recruiters tell agents they have unlimited earning potential and realistically they will never make it and they know that. A lot of people have contracted under false hope and lost a lot of money and truly it's very sad and manipulative on the recruiters part. I believe justice should be served
"This very well might the most boring stock ever, and in turn, the most boring chat board."
"I agree, this has become a badly mismanaged company; stock up 45% in 5 years in a great bull market !"
Solid earnings as always! Non-GAAP beat by $0.32. Revenue beat by $340M
Company came out with a statement. 10 people...really?! All contractors. Its BS.
What’s the problem with the Europe division? Is it really that bad? Can it be corrected? How long before growth again?
"Even though it’s not the best value here, I bought some more shares to celebrate another good quarter of earnings. Cost basis is now $36. My only regret is not backing up the truck last year."
52 week high. Aflac going strong even in the volatile market.

Nice buy here on weakness.
AFL reached a 52 Week low at 36.38
Non-GAAP EPS beats by $0.31. GAAP EPS beats by $0.37. Revenue beats by $190M and revenue up +2.8% Y/Y. Buying more to celebrate this great company.

"AFL is an insurance company, and should not be seriously affected by Covid-19 and the business disruptions. I do not see any big claims coming to AFL due to Covid-19. On the other hand, investments by AFL might have a temporary hit on paper. AFL back to $50 by November is most likely. The business is a bit conservative, and the $4 per year profit will likely repeat in the coming years. Recent acquisition should boost revenue and profits."
AFL is down 5.07% to 39.47
Nice rebound today. Should be back to $88 by weeks end.
AFL reached a 52 Week low at 39.80
"If AFL was trading at just its average PE of 10, we'd easily have a $75+ stock ..."

"Tempted to add more here...I have a cost basis of under $11 a share, split-adjusted."
"Picked up more shares at this low price , hasn’t been this low since 2016Low term buy and hold!"
Started a small position today. Kinda excited lol
Why are we down $3 today? I dont see any news!
Any issues in Japan unit? Europe seems to have problems but heard a Japan also? Is this correct? Anyone out there for input?
The AFLAC duck became really #$%$ when he learned the top brass has been coaching his workers to engage in fraudulent financial acts.
"The reason that this is trading so low is that when interest rates rise again a lot of aflacs bonds will be devaluedAlthough, Aflac is still at a wonder ful valuation regardless and I’m still bullish on an increase in cash that will give them greater profits from the new bond that they will buy at those higher interest rates"
Will go up plenty in the next 3 months. Stock is cheap considering all the cash that comes in. Its why they will buy back stock.See you at 50 after thanksgiving
I love Aflac ! Aflac has made a lot of people rich over the last 50 years. Buy Aflac and hold on to it while reinvest the dividends !
going above 50

Next target: 35.04 today
Aflac is down 13.53% to 30.00
AFL reached a new All Time High at 90.75
I never had a position but it is the way to build wealth over ten twenty years
If it goes below 37.10 today.... next stop is 36.14. If the Algos break 36.14... watch out below.
Is this a good stock that you think is gonna rise in monday (like= yes dislike= no )
Anyone buying in now is likely buying someone else’s gain. I’m trimming this one like anyone else should up a large %. Whole market is in the same boat .
new 52 week high today. Pulled back a bit. $90 within reach
"trailing p/e ratio seems to be lower than other insurance companies, I assume that means this company is pretty undervalued"
A great and reliable 3% yield with a payout ratio of <30%. Solid earnings report. Adding more to my position.
they should raise the dividend significantly
Looking forward to this earnings call tomorrow!
SOLID EARNINGS. Stock should be in the high 30's tomorrow. Hopefully 40 before the end of the week.
AFL is down 4.92% to 37.29

Caution to Nick Saban: Do not quit your job at Alabama or you will drown by the AFLAC Crimson Tide!
"Afl, You can do it. I want to see this stock @100.00 a share"
This thing has diverged from the S&P. I predict 34.81 by the end of today
Been with AFL since 1976. Love there stock.
A stock split means very little except you have 2 times as many shares each worth half as much!
"see i told u not to buy it yet it has broken support level, it is not a time to buy it is a time to wait."
Back again after my correct prediction from 3 months ago. This will hit $50 within a month after earnings.
4-2-2020 - SHARE $32 - 45 WITHIN A MONTH! read my lips sarah
This is a great company and pays great dividend. Aflac CEO is there for long time and he is the second CEO in fortune 500 company after Warren Buffet who has been holding position of CEO for years.

sort of undervalued .target price : 45
Aflac is up 4.92% to 35.62
"Afl is up less than 1/2 the S&P over the past 5 years. Is it undervalued? Is it a screaming buy? No it is not, because sales are waaaaaaayyyyyy off, they are hemorrhaging sales management, and have officially slid into the ""woke"" column of corporate America. The only thing keeping this dog#### stock on anyone's radar is the dividend...so give a shout out to the CFO for managing the capital pool efficiently."

Aflac is down 4.92% to 35.94
"Young investors put your money into stocks like AFL. Do it thru a DRIP. You can put in small amounts, large amounts then let ride reinvesting the dividends. You will be very happy in about 25 yrs. I got into afl in 1988 as well as home depot. Go long with drip plans"
Aflac reached a 52 Week low at 33.49

no movement wow
Don’t know about you but I’m excited about the split. I’m a brand new investor and this is my first split. Win or lose I’m ready for the learning experience. And excited to see what happens Friday. I only have a few shares but I’ll be happy with a few dollars. I’m just trying learn how you pros do it. Best luck 2 every1
lol why is this chat so dead ahaha. Such a solid company but people don't even know of it LOL
added some at $49.70
"There is nothing underneath in terms of support for this. The machines will sell this to $30.44 before the week is out, if not sooner. Sell when you can."
AFL is one of my favorite dividend growth stocks. I talk about dividend growth stocks on my youtube channel. The channel is really focused on new and beginner investors looking to invest in dividend growth stocks and ETFs. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrg6IDPf4a7pUKTN90n6syg
"Let me tell you about this stock. Aflac has made 10 people that I know of very rich people.I live in a city of about 50,000 people The word kinda got around about Aflac. I have put together almost 1,000 shares myself and I am not a person who is well off. I would love to say I have 10,000 shares because I would quit everything and relax. I did this all by the DRIP plan. Drip plans are great if you buy and hold."
"Mark my words from my previous posts. Sell if you can. If this goes past 34.81 today, next stop is 33.20"
Aflac reached a 52 Week low at 36.38
Today’s target: 35.38. If the Algos take it down below 35.28. It will test into 35.02 tomorrow.... then the 38.2 retracement level of 34.81. Get out while you still can!

Share price crash to 2017 levels !!!!! 3 years value erased
"Amos indicated the goal is to increase the dividend at a rate similar to operating earnings. Dividend up 4.9%, operating earning for the nine month period up 8+%. Come on Mr. Amos stop buying shares for option grants and pay the owners of the company according."
"Crippled industries that are seeing 30,40,50,60% less revenue like hotels and airlines sometimes recover up to 80% of their value in dumb rallies for no reason (an airline announces they will add more peanuts to some flights) but an insurance company like Afflac that swims in cash gets punished like if it was American Airlines for getting 1.5% less revenue lolAnything in the 30s is a steal if you have the time to hold. This will go back to normal and if your average price is in the 30s it will beat any gains the SP500 can give you."
Anyone have an idea when we hould see a stock split
How was the earnings ? What can we expect to see tomorrow ?
AFL is down 8.53% to 33.79

"THERE ARE APPARENTLY 2 CASES: GEORGIA AND NEW YORK. THE NEW YORK COURT IS PRESENTLY CONSIDERING WHETHER AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE IN A CONTRACT BETWEEN AFLAC AND THE SALES PEOPLE IS ENFORCEABLE AGAINST A CLAIM BY THE SALES PEOPLE THAT THE CLAUSE IS ""UNCONSCIONABLE"". THE GEORGIA COURT DECIDED THE SAME ISSUE ON JANUARY 3 IN FAVOR OF AFLAC AND TOLD THE PARTIES THEY WOULD HAVE TO ARBITRATE THE CLAIMS. THERE IS LITTLE REASON, IMO, TO EXPECT THE NEW YORK COURT TO DECIDE IT DIFFERENTLY. THIS IS LIKELY A TEMPEST IN A TEAPOT AND I WILL BE VERY HAPPY THAT I BOUGHT 85.00 CALLS, DATE OF 1/19....WE SHALL SEE...."

"AFL is below its 200, 50, 20 day moving averages. It is also under its 38.2% fib retracement level. The Algos will now punish this stock. My target: 30.44."
How about a dividend increase?

"I started with AFLAC before anyone knew what AFLAC ment (1976) Was proud to be a district manager. That's what we were called before coordinators. When I started with the company you just went out and sold direct, (No groups) we used to cold call on farmers at night. After 40 years I hung it up but I saved my Aflac stock and over the years it has treated me well. Just want to say thank you too Aflac, Russ and most important J.K."
This is for Bobthebuilder. I added 7 K in mid March. You will be sorry you were bashing AFL instead of buying. I have owned the stock for 30 years. AFL is a winner.

"Wow, financials are fantastic. How is this trading so low right now?"
"The only thing going for this dog#### stock is the dividend. Management is clueless, and has ruined the sales culture from what I can tell. Combine this with the ongoing business climate created by government shutdowns, and my short term outlook is negative."
"which stock is better AFL, chubbs limited or All state to invest at this time?"
Not certain if this is a buyer's opportunity?
"Aflac ( AFL ) was up more than 1%. The insurance group said that it expects sales from its postal channel in Japan to decline by as much as 50% for the year from 2018 levels after media reports said that Japan Post may have improperly sold 104,000 Aflac policies. 8/22/19"
"fcf ttm is high, dividend cud be improved a lil"

Bumping up against 52 week highs. Long term holder here. May buy for the breakout.
