"Q4 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.07 (beat by $0.03), GAAP EPS of $1.35 (beat by $0.31). Revenue of $5.9B (beat by $400M), up 5.4% Y/Y. Great company."
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on What*sapp>>>>>>> +447901191306 or Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"

It looks like a split coming soon for AFL
C'mon AFL break through that double top of $57.50ish and hit $60.00!!!
I love Aflac ! Aflac has made a lot of people rich over the last 50 years. Buy Aflac and hold on to it while reinvest the dividends !
I never had a position but it is the way to build wealth over ten twenty years
"I started with AFLAC before anyone knew what AFLAC ment (1976) Was proud to be a district manager. That's what we were called before coordinators. When I started with the company you just went out and sold direct, (No groups) we used to cold call on farmers at night. After 40 years I hung it up but I saved my Aflac stock and over the years it has treated me well. Just want to say thank you too Aflac, Russ and most important J.K."
"OK. Earnings not great, but considering the Covid-19 impact, not bad. Adjusted earnings $1.23 was above estimates of $1.10. Back to $45 over the next few weeks as the Covid-19 panic fades."
"Afl is up less than 1/2 the S&P over the past 5 years. Is it undervalued? Is it a screaming buy? No it is not, because sales are waaaaaaayyyyyy off, they are hemorrhaging sales management, and have officially slid into the ""woke"" column of corporate America. The only thing keeping this dog#### stock on anyone's radar is the dividend...so give a shout out to the CFO for managing the capital pool efficiently."
52 week high. Aflac going strong even in the volatile market.
This is a great company and pays great dividend. Aflac CEO is there for long time and he is the second CEO in fortune 500 company after Warren Buffet who has been holding position of CEO for years.

Aflac is increasing their dividend in 2021 from $0.28 per quarter to $0.33
"trailing p/e ratio seems to be lower than other insurance companies, I assume that means this company is pretty undervalued"
Don’t know about you but I’m excited about the split. I’m a brand new investor and this is my first split. Win or lose I’m ready for the learning experience. And excited to see what happens Friday. I only have a few shares but I’ll be happy with a few dollars. I’m just trying learn how you pros do it. Best luck 2 every1
Solid earnings as always! Non-GAAP beat by $0.32. Revenue beat by $340M
Please STOP buying your own shares and invest in some growth assets. Maybe it's time to separate this company from the Amos family?
"If AFL was trading at just its average PE of 10, we'd easily have a $75+ stock ..."
Back again after my correct prediction from 3 months ago. This will hit $50 within a month after earnings.
