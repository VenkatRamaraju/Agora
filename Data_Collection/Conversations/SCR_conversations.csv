Where does the sp go from here?
What’s the news of this and $SCR together?
I was wondering if I should sell my Score shares and buy Penn before the Special Meeting to move up the date of take over. Was waiting for the Score Bet App to be launched in Canada but it doesn't look like it will before merger.
Why are people selling??
Canada August 27th single game betting becomes legal
"I copied this from the sedar site:More specifically, we intend to use the net proceeds of any sale of Securities to fund growth and expansion of theScore Bet in New Jersey, Colorado and Indiana, and in additional jurisdictions where we have market access and where we intend to pursue market access or direct licensing (subject in each case to the enactment of enabling state gaming laws and regulations and the receipt of relevant licenses and approvals).Our growth plan contemplates continued investment in product development to enhance the features and functionality of theScore Bet’s mobile sports betting platform, including the extension of the platform to support online gaming,additional integrations with our sports media app, investments in technology, operations, infrastructure and systems to support the multi-jurisdictional deployment and operation of theScore Bet, and investments in marketing to support user acquisition and retention.As additional jurisdictions in the United States and Canada enact enabling legislation for mobile sports betting, onlinegaming, or both, we plan to enter into further market access agreements or pursue operating licenses issued by stateor provincial gaming authorities, as applicable. The cost of market access agreements and direct licenses will vary byjurisdiction, depending on the size of the jurisdiction, the nature of the enabling legislation and the number of availablemarket access partners, licenses, or both."
"To confirm, those of us who are still holding, we won't get less than around $42 CDN on this once the deal closes?"
Does it make more sense at this point to buy SCR or PENN?
"The special resolution, the full text of which is set forth in Appendix ""B"" to the accompanying management information circular (the ""Circular"") of the Company dated September 10, 2021, to approve a plan of arrangement pursuant to Division 5 of Part 9 of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) involving the Company, Penn National Gaming, Inc. and 1317774 B.C. Ltd., all as more particularly described in the Circular."
Is it a 50% share and cash deak nowvor the original terms buying penn with cash part...its the 18thfor closing will know the answer soon. I think you could play now options for Penn National
"It's been a hell of a ride since my initial purchase at $0.70, thanks for the good times... and the bad but I am officially taking my money and running. Good luck to all going forwards!"
Shares get converted by eod?
Comon hit $56
Got the cash and my shares converted. Numbers look off for penn tho but in a good way lol
Is everyone on the Penn chat board? Like for yes thanks
"you can only lose money now by holding. if you sell and buy penn then you are still investing in scr but if you sell and buy penn and the deal falls through scr will plummet but penn will have saved 2 billion. i just dont see any logic in holding scr its capped now, unless your average is under 17 and you are a hibernating bear."
got out after 6-7 years holding this....500% return. thank you scr.
You all really think this thing can hold $30+ for the next 6+ months or so until acquisition is finalized?
Anybody have their shares convert yet? Must take a few days hoping by end of week?
I would take the 80%+ secured gain and buy back in when it drops a bit lower from current levels. There's about 6 months left before the deal goes through (so long as it does). Anything could happen to the share price and the market as a whole over the next 6 months for people to be 100% certain it's gonna stay above $30!
I bought at $54…. What do I do? lol
On august 27th what's the first legal bet you're going to place?
"So this Penn acquisition, is it good news or bad news? Especially for like me who’s small time investor only but the money I’ve put in, I consider it as my retirement later.."
To the geniuses that think SCR will crash. The daily volume is about 1 million shares. Over 27 million shares traded the day of the acquisition announcement. You need a market crash to induce that much volume of selling at this point. Ain’t happening. All stocks are rallying into the new year.
FLY BABY FLY!! Hit $56
"I received this in the mail:Score Media and Gaming Inc. has entered into a merger agreement with Penn National Gaming, Inc. that provides for score Media and Gaming Inc. to become a subsidiary of Penn National Gaming, inc. Pursuant to the agreement, you may elect to receive one of the following Options for each Score Media and Gaming Inc. common share you hold: ( The other options were for Canadians ) 2- USD Mixed Settlement - To receive $17.00 USD Cash and 0.2398 of a share of Penn National common stock. This is the default.Can I do anything or is this the only option ?"
What happens to SCR TSX shares?How much $ and PENN shares do I get?
With the difference in price isn't there currently about 1.25 a share sitting on the table if people grab Score shares?
Good time to buy shares? Or should i wait a little?
Why my SCR shares on WealthSimple says it's been delisted??
"Lol RobFans and Jak sold SCR at $14 after buying it at $50, now they are bag holding FANS, hilarious"
I think the Fall schedule will be very kind to $PENN $DKNG $SCR $GENI . Holding PENN thru 200.
What time does the meeting start? I thought it was at 11:00 AM
"If I’m not mistaken, the SP is worth $43C at buyout based on Penn’s current SP. if so, why are people selling given the upside?? I can see selling if Penn drops but things are looking up over there."
We hit jackpot
Anyone else got there shares converted ?
if scr goes down below the penn share ratio it will be bought back up to it in 5 seconds...Its a free money situation. anyone who bought above the scr penn deal day price ratio of 68$ penn or about 32$ is stuck now with scr unless you believe penn will be crashing and even still your gaurenteed 17$ so you wont get wiped out...its a very restrictive situation but a great one if your average is below 17 u.s
JUST A THOUGHT - position of $PENN $DKNG $SCR $GENI going into the fall is a winning strategy. Pullbacks will likely be shallow and few through year's end.
"Once again patience paid off! sold at $44.50 I am out, made more profit then i would've day trading every day for the last 6 months, time for some R&R :-)"
Is the start of the NFL season a catalyst for this stock? Or not really?
"$44 a share , Great Canadian Gaming is a better buy than SCR."
can't believe how much this chat died! anyone know when the transfer to Penn happens?
Good time to get in on this stock?
Go Jays
So I received a large book of this special meeting. How they didn't summarize this on 3 pages I really don't understand. can anyone break it down before I make the call to find out the just of it. are we getting screwed or not with this buyout...
"just sold my shares, $44.19"
Penn up over 10 per cent lately while score is only around 5 percent. Not hard to understand that you should sell this and buy penn
when merger going to happen?
This stock has just been tracking PENN. why the divergence today?
Time to sell?
Well just sold my shares and used it to buy direct into PENN. Hopefully a nice surge over the next couple weeks with NFL. It was fun!
"I have Score USD and Score .TO , in equal shares, trying to figure out to sell USD and buy Penn. If Penn hits $100 the results will be $41. Which is only $6 off its current value. Why would I hold to gain just $6??? Advice Please!!!"
"I was earning earlier prior to the switch to Penn, I never think of selling. Very much surprised when I opened my portfolio thru my bank, I’m loosing more than half. What’s going on?"
What is happening!?
PENN tomorrow
What if the the deal gets broken before then?
Wow maybe shouldn’t have sold at $40  Happy for all you longs 
"Daaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrreeeen AKA ""fake doctor"" come and eat your Kraft dinner and Hot Dogs"
What’s going to happened??
Anyone know what time today they are announcing the start date of single game betting in Canada?cant find it online
Any good portfolio manager knows to have a full position of $PENN $DKNG $SCR $GENI going into the fall. Pullbacks will likely be shallow and few through year's end.
anyone elses shares turn into Penn today? i thought this wasnt supposed to happen until the spring
was so busy with work did not pay attention and got screwed big time... should have have sold my SCR shares....it hurts....
I also own $SCR $DKNG $GENI adding to all on dips. gl2a.
Sale going through October 19th. We get .2398 if PENN plus $17/ share
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cantechletter.com/2021/08/take-the-deal-says-eight-capital-to-score-media-shareholders/amp/
What are the chances this stock will drop again before the buyout is concluded?seems unlikely it'll leave the $40-$41 range since we know what we will get come first quarter next year
50$ is very likely now and Penn continues going up also this is a gold mine
"I think many are looking at the potential betting as the only revenue here. SO WRONG! The Score APP is a platform that will reap the rewards of massive advertisement revenue state to state and province to province. Not only do they have millions of followers who use the app on an every day basis, think of AI (artificial intelligence), Algorithmic marketing tools, now gambling on top of that. Potentially Parabolic boys and girls!!THE BIG PICTURE.."
I wonder what the score will be at if PENN hits 105 USD
Anyone has any idea when the SCR shares will be converted to PENN?
"So, for those who cashed out portions of the SCR gains, what did you move your funds into?"
Still holding. There’s still a decent difference in the Scr price and what you’d get from the pen deal.
No clue why people are not selling this and just buying PENN or pENN options. This has more room to go down than up
can anyone explain what shareholders will be getting. is it still 17/share plus our stock converted to Penn stock. I can't make sense of this book. its been my washroom material for two weeks now. its like I'm reading ancient Greek or something
"My previous comment vanished! :( but I will state again as a UK resident what a huge opportunity I believe this to be. I’ve watched the online betting boom of the past 10-15 years first hand and seen the way it has changed the gambling landscape, bricks and mortar bookmakers are becoming less and less profitable due to the online options more and more of the major high street bookies are closing hundreds of shops a year and focussing online only. Football (Soccer) is the most bet on event now ahead of horse racing I can only imagine the amount that will be gambled across the pond on NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB and MLS there is essentially non stop sports all year round to wager on. SKYBET is the second most used online app behind bet 365, similarly to the Score Skybet is part of the sky network and sky sports is a household name/brand in and the transition to online wagering was seamless. Online casinos especially roulette Are a goldmine although they may soon be the subject of tighter regulation. In short when 90% of states and Canada are onboard the growth of this market is hard to fathom I truly believe it is being massively underestimated and that includes the likes of Penn and DKING at current prices.GLA"
Quick question is Penn paying $17.00 Canadian or $17.00 American per share ???Clarification on this would be much appreciated
"Satisfied with the profit, I’m out "
"Great day everyone!! We staved off the panic selling, all of the uncertainties of the RS and even managed a beautiful 8.5%. Starting tonight, (if you all approve and desire it) I will be reinstating something that I haven’t done since before Christmas. It was originally coined “Barry’s Market Minute”It’s a quick (or sometimes long) wrap up post on how the day went and some future forecasts etc etc. With your approval and blessing, I will put forth the effort to make this happen. I will either post after market in the evening, or pre market around 8-8:30 est (depending on what has happened news wise etc) But this time I will also open it to questions etc. So if this is something that would interest you and would find value in, give a thumbs up or a follow and I’ll start tonight. If it’s a no, give me a thumbs down and snotty msg haha. Either way, my feelings won’t be hurt, I promise. Great day today everyone. The horizons are vast, the bounty is plentiful and it’s all within reach."
I am so tired of SCR.TO doing nothing all day. Can you move??? I have been reading http://alert-sounds.com/ for a month now and the stocks there actually go!
Anyone else waiting for the share conversion? I’m still waiting
"Some of the posts may suggest what may happen to SCR after Q2 ER or in the next few days or weeks. However, I think if you have invested in SCR, you should have some degrees of understanding at the opportunity being open by C-218 and SCR is equipped with some good tools to capitalize this one-of-a-life time opportunity.If you are looking to take profit in few days or few weeks, I guess SCR may not be the stock you should consider and you may want to move on. WIth this opportunity, I believe the right mindset is to accumulate during this consolidation phase and establish your target position. After that, just stay back and see what is going to happen in the next few quarters. It is so obvious that the upcoming quarters will be full of positive updates as well as a strong anticipated revenue. There is no need to time when is the lowest point for initiate or up your position because in one year, any entry point during this phase is considered to be a very low point.I have used the same strategy when I identify CTS, SLS, and WELL. I did have some small loss at the beginning phase after initiating my position but with patience, I am extremely happy with my current rewards. SCR is my next GEM that I like its chance over its risk. I believe with the same patience I had with CTS, SLS, and WELL, things will move in the projected path in the upcoming months and years.I wish all the investors the best luck. NOTE 1: Try to invest in a high quality or high potential stock and avoid being emotion during the daily fluctuation. This will increase your chance to have rewards instead of loss.NOTE 2: Remember to mute some of the noise on this board and your day will become more peaceful."
"The higher PENN goes, the higher the premium we get. Let’s hope it gets to $80. That’ll put us around $36 usd"
Just hold this diamond
Anyone got the SCR shares converted to PENN yet?
"Reading all the comments on this board today is so entertaining. Honestly, the logic and the math are very simple. It's definitely not rocket science. There are a number of facts that real investors should know:(1) Is SCR at a better position after yesterday or before yesterday? I guess the answer is too obvious. :D(2) Using UK's data for extrapolation, Canada online gaming market is 4.3 billions. Using New Jersey's data, it is 5.4 billions. Ontario itself will be projected to be 1.7 to 2.1 billions. With the well established users of SCR app in Canada and North America, together with their active social media exposure, it is easy to expect SCR will capture a major stack of the share (easily 20% or above) in this new market being opened by the passing of the legalization. Comparing with the 2020 SCR revenue, I guess anyone can tell the expected revenue growth rate in the next few years will be mouthwatering.(3) Credit Suisse on Tuesday reiterated its outperform rating on the shares of Score Media and Gaming (SCR.TO) with a US$50.00 target price. Some simple FACTS about this: DraftKings is rating at 6 times 2026 estimated sales while SCR it still trading at 1.5 times 2026 sales estimates. The potential is clear.(4) SCR's media app and bet app are both ready, putting it in a position to immediately capitalize on the market newly opened by the passing of the legislation.(5) If you doo read news articles, you can easily see provinces are keen on getting all these implemented asap after the completion of the royal assent (expected to be very short turn-around time). This will range from as soon as this summer to Fall this year. It is easy to understand that the provincial governments are waiting for the mouth washing tax income to support all the covid-related spending in the past while and upcoming future.(6) All the above are just about the Canada's potential, I have not even mentioned the US market that SCR has already entered and continue to expand..... There are endless points that can easily be added on and on ...In brief, some potential fluctuations will still happen; HOWEVER, these fluctuations are meaningless if your vision is for long-term rewards. Look at the last run-up to ATH and any investor can easily identify the normal up and down while the SP followed a strong uptrend momentum all the way to CAN $56.70. Will there be risk to invest in SCR? Definitely as this is called investment. However, the potential rewards significantly outweigh the risk. Plain and simple.I am just happy and will enjoy the nice and long runway peacefully without concerning these so-called fluctuation."
Hold till $50 CAD or just transfer it all over to PENN??
"Come trading time today, what’s the price per share in Canadian dollars?"
"Canadian Sports Betting Bill C-218 Enjoys Second Reading, Set For Vote Feb. 17February 5, 2021By Tom NightingaleOne of the two bills aimed at legalizing single-event sports betting in Canada, Bill C-218, had a ""successful"" second reading in parliament on Friday, February 5. It will go to a vote on February 17.Conservative MP Kevin Waugh introduced the Private Members Bill back in February 2020. In recent months, it has progressed from PMB to a federal government bill after being adopted for parliament debate back in November.The bill received further cross-party support at its second reading, receiving full advocacy from the Conservatives, the NDP, and Bloc Quebecois, and partial support from the Liberals.Waugh confirmed that if the bill passes at the Feb. 17 vote, it will go to the justice committee. If it doesn’t pass, the bill is dead.RELATED: Canadian Sports Betting Bill C-13 On Hold Again in HouseIt's not the only hope for Canadian singles betting, though.Bill C-13, an alternative bill introduced by federal Justice Minister David Lametti, was recently delayed again after coming within a single opposing vote of being fast-tracked in the Commons. Further readings are still to come.Lametti has said the goal of single-event sports betting legislation is ""to bring a common practice out of the shadows and into the open. To make it legal, regulated and safe.""RELATED: “Tremendous” Interest in Sports Betting Offers Canadian Gaming a Huge OpportunityWhen it comes to sports betting in Canada, there is important context in the U.S. Since legislation was introduced south of the border in 2018, sports betting has exploded in the states, becoming a roaring success in numerous states. In the fall election, several more states took steps forward in introducing sports betting.Since then, more steps have been taken. Another significant advancement came last week, when Google announced it would begin welcoming real-money gambling and daily fantasy mobile apps directly through its Play Store in 15 more countries including both the U.S. and Canada.Key Canadian advocates of single-event sports betting legislation, including Waugh and CGA President Paul Burns, have been emphatic about the benefits the legislation would bring. Burns has cited it as a key move in attracting customers back to legal and responsible gambling and in supporting the local and federal gaming industries that have suffered so much during COVID-19."
Will the shares automatically convert or do we shareholders have to do something
$45 lets go
Leafs win opener 2-1
Do we get shares in PENN after the merger?

Hopefully news and a gap up over $40 US shortly
wow down so much
"Per Motley Fool...theScore stock detailsPennsylvania-based casino giant Penn National Gaming reached out to theScore with a buyout offer yesterday. The deal is worth US$2 billion, or CA$2.5 billion — much higher than what theScore stock was worth just a few days ago.However, the deal isn’t all cash. This means investors and stockholders need to take a closer look at the fine print to figure out how to maximize gains. The deal offers US$17 (CA$21.33) in cash per share and 0.2398 shares of Penn’s common stock for each theScore share.When the deal is completed, theScore stock will be delisted. Shareholders will be given the cash and Penn stock as planned. However, Penn stock has already jumped because of the announcement. It’s now trading for US$72, which means 0.2398 is worth roughly CA$21.7 in cash. Put simply, the combined value of the deal is $43 per share currently.However, theScore stock is currently trading for just $40.8 at the time of writing. That means shareholders have little more room for upside. It could also be an opportunity for traders to make a quick buck via arbitrage."
"Goooood morning everyone. It’s great to be back! I had plans to write a novel this morning but unfortunately I won’t have time to say everything I want to say. So point for it is. - Ok so RS... yes normally known to be used when companies are failing as a bail out to maintain index listing. However; I don’t think that is the case here obviously haha. The Score is a roaring. I do think the 1:10 is aggressive and would’ve liked to a more modest ratio (1:3 or even 1:5). But believe me when I say this, this process doesn’t happen overnight. My senses tell me that they had this idea in the works for awhile now when the stock was much cheaper ($2-$2.50) ish would be my guess. But these changes take time. Drafting documents, legalities, meetings with underwriters etc etc. I think their intentions were good but the stock price continued to soar and to change the ratio would be a time delay and a costly venture. SO, I think the decision to carry on with it was a contingency. - I’m gonna skip over the whole market vs stock price stuff because there’s some brilliant people here that have already touched down on that and hopefully cleared that up for everyone. - Future projections leading into split/vote... I think it’s full steam ahead leading up to the vote. FOMO, last chance additions etc will take place. If votes are in favour, split will occur likely right after. Up listing to US index is yet to be known (I think). - Although I am extremely long in this and have been coined as an “OG” by some lol, I think there is still a lot of confusion, uncertainty, worry out there amongst shareholders. Welcome to heavy reverse splits! Again, normally the worry is due to a sinking ship. But this isn’t one of them. For anyone fearing the future or upset about the decision I GET IT! BELIEVE ME, I do. I’ve been through many. Some for good reasons, some to plug holes in the hull haha. But I do think we will still see some turmoil this week, next week and beyond. A lot of people will have a hard time wrapping themselves around the new stock price and comparing it to the likes of bigger US companies. And that’s ok! Just remember, stock price does NOT hold near the weight as Market Cap does when evaluating a company. It does enter into the equation, but not the heavy hitter. - I’m not going to tell investors here what to do because at the end of the day, we all have different opinions, different goals, different entry points and different ideas on what the future holds. Myself, I will continue to add to my position up to the vote (if it’s viable). And take it from there. I’m not looking too far ahead because there a few very short term hurdles that need to addressed before I span the horizon. I’m not too concerned with the reverse split. I don’t find it to be incredibly bullish OR bearish. I do feel that there will be dilution which YES will drive price down, but will likely be a good thing in the long term. It does create a new entry point for some, and a point of addition for others. - I’m going to be in and out today (got a foot of snow that needs to be dealt with). If anyone has questions, comments or want to tell me I’m an idiot and I know nothing, post it on the board and I’ll reply as quick as I can. Again just remember,The decision to split has always been there. Sure hindsight says they could’ve grown organically and not needed it, but at the time of the decision we weren’t even close to where we are today! To me THAT is extremely bullish. Keep the faith that the ship is maintaining course and we’ll get through the choppy waters together. Happy Tuesday everyone. Great to be back and thank you for all the warm welcome messages. Really means a lot."
so basically score will never go below 41 and above 42 until Penn acquires and converts the shares?

"I have some insights I'd like to share for anyone who doesn't know just how big the potential here is: First, the federal government has tabled a bill (C-13) to make single event betting legal in Canada. They went into recess before Christmas, and reconvene on the 18th, and I'd expect them to pass the bill in February. Once they do that, each province has to pass their own bill but Doug Ford has already talked about how big it all is so I think they'll get on it pretty quickly. TheScore helped write the legislation, so I think they'll be ready to launch pretty quickly after it's legal. They have 4 million active users in Ontario, and the illegal betting industry is worth 14-billion. That's a lot of legal revenue to tap. Secondly, they're in 4 US States and just going to keep expanding, They were the second sportsbook ever to open in Indiana, where March Madness is going to be held. That's money in the bank imo. John Levy, the CEO, has already said that the bubble being in Indiana is huge.New York State announced yesterday that they are crafting their own legislation to rival New Jersey and legalize mobile sports betting. Its huge. Biggest sports betting market in the US.Lastly, their earning next week are going to be huge quarter over quarter. The last two quarters have sucked hard because of the pandemic. But this quarter is from September to December. That's the NFL, NHL & NBA bubbles, 2 major golf championships and MLB postseason worth of betting numbers. I honestly believe that in 2-3 years, theScore will be worth $30 if they do everything they say they're going to do."
Too all you longs who had the Kajonas to stay put. Keep going I am rooting for ya...
"Credit Suisse $50 price targetCredit Suisse Keeps Outperform, US$50 TP on Score Media MT NEWSWIRES 1:25 PM ET 7/14/2021 01:25 PM EDT, 07/14/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Credit Suisse has kept its Outperform and US$50 TP on Score Media, noting that it has been an eventful few months for SCR, starting with their US stock listing and ending with the passage of C-218, which legalized single game sports betting in Canada. ""We think SCR's future is very bright, and expect them to be a market leader in Canada, with \~20% of Canadian sports fans being SCR users."" Management also expect to be ready to launch both OSB and iGaming as soon as Ontario opens to private operators, which is expected by December 2020. SCR continues to work on integrating its technology, with the player account management and promotion engine being fully deployed next month, and full integration expected in the next 12 months. Credit Suisse thinks there are two takeaways from SCR being vertically integrated: (1) lower COGS as they can remove some revenue share agreements, and more importantly (2) a more dynamic player account management and promotion engine. ""Essentially, we think SCR is in a unique position in terms of the amount of data they have on their customers (via the sports media and social media business) and thus have an opportunity to target and acquire customers, as well as generate incremental betting from existing players,"" CS said. CS is now forecasting 21/22 EPS of US$-1.00/$0.18."
Where did everyone go? It used to be hundreds of posts a day and not there are a handful. Where is Rusty?
Will be sad seeing this ticket disappear. Score treated me good maybe I’ll hop in PENN one of these days 
Has anyone shares converted yet?
FANS FUNFF on the move! It’s turn.
"For the new CNBC watchers who newly found this stock: this company has an app with 3.9 million average monthly active users in Q1. As gambling laws ease across North America, they can literally flick on a switch to allow their users to GAMBLE on said app. Each of those users already uses the app an average of 116 times per month. This is why theScore is in an extremely advantageous position, because they are a Media company FIRST with a devout userbase and the ability to add a seamless transition to a their betting side. This is without mentioning their impressive social media and e-sports presence which they can further leverage. Buy, hold and look in your account 5 years later with a 10-bagger. DYODD."
I bought score at $20cad. Does it make sense to sell now?
"Hi g, It happens to mine too. Anyone knows how this conversion actually works. Thx"
Bought this at $55. Let’s goooo SCR!!!
$fans $scr $luck.v all gonna take off. I'm all of them balls deep.
"I kind of feel like this is a no brainer to hold at this point unless your basis is super high and you just want to get out. The Penn deal backstops you at $17 USD a share, not including Penn Shares. The Penn Shares likely will go up in value as NFL season progresses - and even if they don’t, you’re at around $34 a share value currently."
"Just so everyone understands: Those shares that were issued at 1.40 hit the market today. The final short-form prospectus has been filed and now those shares are free to flow through sales and buys. The preliminary short-form prospectus makes it clear: ""A copy of this preliminary short form prospectus has been filed with the securities regulatory authorities in each of the provinces of Canada, except Québec, but has not yet become final for the purpose of the sale of securities. Information contained in this preliminary short form prospectus may not be complete and may have to be amended. The securities may not be sold until a receipt for the short form prospectus is obtained from the securities regulatory authorities.""The final short-form prospectus was submitted today at 3:31 pm (submitted to Sedar). You're welcome...no need to speculate as to why there was a huge dip."
Does anyone know when the sale will be finalized and SCR will stop trading under this ticker?
