Too all you longs who had the Kajonas to stay put. Keep going I am rooting for ya...
"So, for those who cashed out portions of the SCR gains, what did you move your funds into?"
Does it make more sense at this point to buy SCR or PENN?
Can anyone confirm that The Score Holders are guaranteed to take home at least $42 CDN when the dust settles on this? Or can it be less than $42? In what scenario would be be less that $42 or more than $42?
Penn up over 10 per cent lately while score is only around 5 percent. Not hard to understand that you should sell this and buy penn
"$44 a share , Great Canadian Gaming is a better buy than SCR."
"Can someone please give a lengthy breakdown on the Canadian Side of things? What happensto SCR.TO. As well, I see people are saying PENN valued at 34USD but in the article it says 17USD. Any clarification?"
Anyone know what time today they are announcing the start date of single game betting in Canada?cant find it online
I bought score at $20cad. Does it make sense to sell now?
"Has anyone experienced a buyout in wealthsimple trade before? Since I hold scr.to and that will be converted to a usd stock (penn) when the buyout happens, does that mean I have to pay for the conversion fees if I decide to hold?"
PENN has Bought This Stock... Will Be Reaching $ 40 Today.. Bought 5000 Shares... GOOD LUCK YA ALL !!
I wonder what the score will be at if PENN hits 105 USD
Penn has a lot of room to run up so I’m not selling my shares of SCR.TO yet. Gonna see if we hit $50
"Thoughts on another company doing a hostile takeover and outbidding? Say CZR, MGM or even DKNG proposing 3B or smth?"
What are the chances this stock will drop again before the buyout is concluded?seems unlikely it'll leave the $40-$41 range since we know what we will get come first quarter next year
Time to sell?
"New to trading here - so if you were to hold on to your current shares, once the buyout is completed in Q1 2022, we will receive $17USD + 0.2398 shares of PENN per share of SCR? Will that be completed automatically? Are we able to hold fractions of shares on platforms such as questrade or wealthsimple?"
"Not bad deal , 40 + cad , realistic it’s would have taken atleast 1.5 yrs to touch this price point, so celebrate "
Is this for today only or it will continue to go up tomorrow and for a couple of days?
SCR.TO is up 10.21% to 21.48
not selling this until Penn hits 100 or Score hits 60
Nothing wrong with taking profit but the upside is huge with penn. current 52 week high is 142 and we’re sitting at roughly half plus the cash payout. I’m holding a big chunk until this closes in Q1 I think we may see a substantial increase with the appreciation of penn
"Nothing wrong with taking profit, BUT this still looks like it has plenty of runway in the days and months and even years ahead if you have the time..."
"Good volume once again today, nice. NFL season right around the corner"
Well that was a cool ride.... bought in at 30$...managed to average down to just under 20. I didn't make as much as some of you but still happy with my earnings.
so basically score will never go below 41 and above 42 until Penn acquires and converts the shares?
"nice open today, lets hope it stays that way"
So I received a large book of this special meeting. How they didn't summarize this on 3 pages I really don't understand. can anyone break it down before I make the call to find out the just of it. are we getting screwed or not with this buyout...
"BUY OUT IS COMING FOR SURE....I am guessing one of the BIG BOYS will announce it in their earnings reports. DRAFTKINGS or PENN, FINGERS CROSSED. I honestly think it will be draftkings since they are making the media push."
when merger going to happen?
$fans $scr $luck.v all gonna take off. I'm all of them balls deep.
"Score Media and Gaming announced Thursday a one-year partnership with Canlan Sports, owners of arenas and sports complexes across North America."
wait what happens to our shares after buyout? do we get shares in Penn?
To the geniuses that think SCR will crash. The daily volume is about 1 million shares. Over 27 million shares traded the day of the acquisition announcement. You need a market crash to induce that much volume of selling at this point. Ain’t happening. All stocks are rallying into the new year.
we are 5 weeks away from placing our first bets in canada. this stock will be mid 30s by September
"I did the math and if I am right, here is what I have come up to for two situations (short and longs):Short term: Sell. you will have money in the bank now.Long: Hold because.... With the money you earn from the accusation plus the shares of Penn you gain, you will be in a better place in time as Penn price should increase. They are a strategic company and most people don't realize how big they are compared to their competitive. I am in this for a while as I planned to sell when Canadian single event wagering was in play and I think I will hold and see where Penn takes me. Their future looks bright and they are making the right moves. Here is my math on this......*$17 USD per share + .2398 of penn per share (Penn at 72 x .2398=*$17USD) . That totals to around $42 Canadian (today; I say today as the Penn price changes, this changes also).*17USD to CAD = 21.25 therefore, 21x2=$42Please comment and let me know if I have missed anything here and what I have missed if anything."
What’s the news of this and $SCR together?
"To confirm, those of us who are still holding, we won't get less than around $42 CDN on this once the deal closes?"
(Penn share price x 0.2398) +17 usd
Shorts when they heard Penn buyout
"All I know is my own habits and behaviors. I love the score app, it’s been my go to for sports for years now. I’m not a big better, a couple sports select tickets a year but I hate having to bet on three games. Once score has betting through its app I will 100% try it out. Plus it’s Canadian. Buy shares of companies you know and use."
"glad i didn't sell it all, only sold some for lightspeed and that one is also up... no complaint =D"
Wow maybe shouldn’t have sold at $40  Happy for all you longs 
Comon hit $56
Where did everyone go? It used to be hundreds of posts a day and not there are a handful. Where is Rusty?
Do we get shares in PENN after the merger?
Good luck to all the diamond hand longs here. i sold all mine for a ten thousand dollar profit. i might buy back at a later date. Good luck..Positive vibes everyone.
Leafs win opener 2-1
"If I’m not mistaken, the SP is worth $43C at buyout based on Penn’s current SP. if so, why are people selling given the upside?? I can see selling if Penn drops but things are looking up over there."
will this go to 42 canadian? have only 30 shares i might just cash in
Why are people selling???
Anyone know how the exchange of shares go?Will PENN take over the SCR ticker on the TSX or will all shares be US stocks?
You all really think this thing can hold $30+ for the next 6+ months or so until acquisition is finalized?
Who's next on the buyout list? GMBL?......ELYS? Both producing greater revenues than SCR and are much much smaller than SCR in market caps. By a factor of 10-20X in fact.........Kel
"There is only 13.70 million shares float 10% of that short 79% institution holding, $ljpc is just getting noticed, we need little more shorts, Iam charging only10% per annum$arpo $bysi $fvrr $scr"
Should I sell today or can the stock still have potential to go up even after the 60-70% raise today
50$ is very likely now and Penn continues going up also this is a gold mine
Still holding. There’s still a decent difference in the Scr price and what you’d get from the pen deal.
Penn to buy Score at 34 USD/Share. That is about 43 CAD/Share. Congrats to ALL. We should see higher than 43$ Today. We may see a better offer in the coming days.
Hopefully news and a gap up over $40 US shortly
"Thank you SCR for the $15,000 profit :)"
"Shareholders will get approximately $34 in Penn stock and cash, $17 per share. How does this work? Penn stock is worth $66 right now. Why would we only get $34 in Pen stock?"
People selling at discount. Retail makes me laugh.
got out after 6-7 years holding this....500% return. thank you scr.
"Not selling (right now). What could go wrong?? Penn had a great earning report, their SP is down from highs, we might be stuck inside more due to the variant and more apt to bet on sports and governments are regulating sports gambling more and more. What could go wrong I ask?? Feel free to rip it apart!!"
"Sold 2k Score, thank you Mr. Levy - true Canadian icon (did it twice)! Now time for Brag stock and Eglx!"
"The special resolution, the full text of which is set forth in Appendix ""B"" to the accompanying management information circular (the ""Circular"") of the Company dated September 10, 2021, to approve a plan of arrangement pursuant to Division 5 of Part 9 of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) involving the Company, Penn National Gaming, Inc. and 1317774 B.C. Ltd., all as more particularly described in the Circular."
PENN will buy us out or at the very least increase their ownership. They need SCR
What does this mean for score shareholders in Canada (tsx)? Explain it to me like I’m 5
JUST A THOUGHT - position of $PENN $DKNG $SCR $GENI going into the fall is a winning strategy. Pullbacks will likely be shallow and few through year's end.
"Is it the 5 day weighted average from July 30th forward, July 25-30? Holding 231 at $14 and curious about how many PENN I’ll accumulate if I hold."
anyone seen rusty today?
RobFans and Rusty are officially homeless. Even Denny’s won’t let them eat out of their dumpsters now. That’s gotta be rock bottom.
PENN @ $72 = approx $17 + $17 = $34 U.S. currently ...... PENN @ $100 = approx $24 + $17 = $41 U.S. dollars. If you don't think PENN will be $100 U.S. + as NFL ramps up I don't think you are paying attention.
"love reading the comments, acting like the company is going under. $scr.to was falling for months until today it popped up 80%"
Lol at anyone who sold under $35 cad today
"Sold everything at $41, made a lot on SCR, its been a fun ride! Good luck to all! Been holding this for nearly 2 years now and its finally paid off."
"Bought at $17.65 CAD last month, sold at $40 CAD today. Love it."
Congrats to all that held through the tough times :)
We hit jackpot
I also own $SCR $DKNG $GENI adding to all on dips. gl2a.

"Pre Market on the CA side tomorrow should be a frenzy. People will be trying to add, get in & back in.Get your fingers on the buy buttons.DYODD"
"Someone check in on RobFANS, he sold SCR at a a huge loss last month to buy BRAG, Now he’s also down big on BRAG. LOL"
Ottawa announcing single sports betting rules on Thursday.
wow down so much
I bought at $54…. What do I do? lol
So if this reaches $40-45 CAD today would it be a better decision for someone with the SCR.TO to sell as a pose to taking the settlement buyout and small chunk of PENN shares? New to investing never been part of a buyout. Any and all help is appreciated
Am I missing something here?? Why would it be trading at a higher level than what will be paid out?
"Sold for now , thank you almost held this for 1.5 yrs"
can't believe how much this chat died! anyone know when the transfer to Penn happens?
"you can only lose money now by holding. if you sell and buy penn then you are still investing in scr but if you sell and buy penn and the deal falls through scr will plummet but penn will have saved 2 billion. i just dont see any logic in holding scr its capped now, unless your average is under 17 and you are a hibernating bear."
Congrats and good luck everyone. Sold at 41. Started at 31.5 cents. Nice to have spoken to all of you over the last 3 years
"Should be closer to $45 Canadian when considering PENN current rise. And now with PENN $ backing and SCORE's potential footprint PENN looking like a good deal when compared to peers. Think I will hold for a while yet, this is just the beginning."
Bought this at $55. Let’s goooo SCR!!!
"I received this in the mail:Score Media and Gaming Inc. has entered into a merger agreement with Penn National Gaming, Inc. that provides for score Media and Gaming Inc. to become a subsidiary of Penn National Gaming, inc. Pursuant to the agreement, you may elect to receive one of the following Options for each Score Media and Gaming Inc. common share you hold: ( The other options were for Canadians ) 2- USD Mixed Settlement - To receive $17.00 USD Cash and 0.2398 of a share of Penn National common stock. This is the default.Can I do anything or is this the only option ?"
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
Quick question is Penn paying $17.00 Canadian or $17.00 American per share ???Clarification on this would be much appreciated
I would take the 80%+ secured gain and buy back in when it drops a bit lower from current levels. There's about 6 months left before the deal goes through (so long as it does). Anything could happen to the share price and the market as a whole over the next 6 months for people to be 100% certain it's gonna stay above $30!
"You have got to be kidding me ,sold 200 shares yesterday to buy paysafe"
"What a great day longs, lots of cash made today. I made a lot, kind of embarrassed to say how much.I hope those that went short can manage their losses and those that sold a day or two early will have better fortunes next time."
anyone elses shares turn into Penn today? i thought this wasnt supposed to happen until the spring
"Sold all my SCR positions today. Went balls deep in it with 80% of my portfolio and came out with over 110% returns since January… all in my TFSA.. now putting it back into XAW, TEC, and XIC. No more single stocks for me. Hopefully retire could years earlier but also might die couple years earlier with all the stress this caused me"
Over 50.00 tomorrow
"Scr was Top Gainer yesterday.Nice, just the beginning for scr as single game on line sports betting now legal.Next step, execution.Low floatHuge potential DYODD"
And thus concludes the end of an era. Sold @$40. Made a nice 370% Return. Wish you all the best of luck!
Why are people selling??
Sold all shares today @ $40. I'm ok taking profit even though there may be more upside.
Great day so far
Does anyone know when the sale will be finalized and SCR will stop trading under this ticker?
"I sold all 1,300 shares at market between $41.47 and $47.50 a few minutes ago. To be honest I believe it will likely fill the gap to $45.50 before cooling off, but I'm not 100% sure obviously, so I'm out for now. GLTA"
"Can someone give me a rundown on the company’s outlook, is this still a long term hold? Or sell everything and buy PENN? Genuinely curious."
Aye yall hold or sell! Type in comments and answer why
"Up 11.24% with no news or announcements yet.Imagine when there is news.Huge potential, hold.Bullish DYODD"
"The higher PENN goes, the higher the premium we get. Let’s hope it gets to $80. That’ll put us around $36 usd"
"just sold my shares, $44.19"
Fair value of the buyout is currently $42.89 cad per share. If you sell below that you’re missing out but you never know what will happen
Anybody willing to throw a bet on tomorrow? What’s it going to be ?
Is the start of the NFL season a catalyst for this stock? Or not really?
"Sold half my share, leaving the other half to see whats going to happened tomorrow :O"
On august 27th what's the first legal bet you're going to place?
Just hold this diamond
"Satisfied with the profit, I’m out "
Can anyone clarify? I just read for each share we own we will get 0.2398 shares if Penn? So if one holds 100 shares they will get 23.89 Penn shares?
Any chance we hit $40 again this year?
Is everyone on the Penn chat board? Like for yes thanks
Sold everything! Too speculative for me. But will enter when this comes back to $27 range
just put sell order for 41 can at TD
Where does the sp go from here?
I am so happy i made profits SCR. Now im gonna buy more AMC. I love you all gamers. muwah <3
can anyone explain what shareholders will be getting. is it still 17/share plus our stock converted to Penn stock. I can't make sense of this book. its been my washroom material for two weeks now. its like I'm reading ancient Greek or something
i would love to give some logical advice but i know what real discussion gets on this board. life changing profit for me today and i plan on increasing it with my brain not my heart. do some research on what happens *usually when a company puts out 2 billion dollars for an aquisition when the smoke clears. i hope it goes back over 120 for everyone. long term its a no brainer but short term these revenue streams take time to materialize. good luck
"A transfer of wealth. Buy millions of dollars of $SCR, get your parent company to buy them out, cash out of $SCR when it goes up 75%. Good way to clean money for Dave, just wonder if the SEC agrees."
I hold SCR on the Nasdaq in US funds. Is the maxiumn based on $34 US per share?? Or is there another calulation I should be looking at??
Will this include single fights for mma ?Anyone
34USD= 42.47CAD! We still lower than what's going to be guaranteed.... why are people selling? makes no sense this resistance at a lower price than just announced for the buyout..
Shorts after last week
"Per Motley Fool...theScore stock detailsPennsylvania-based casino giant Penn National Gaming reached out to theScore with a buyout offer yesterday. The deal is worth US$2 billion, or CA$2.5 billion — much higher than what theScore stock was worth just a few days ago.However, the deal isn’t all cash. This means investors and stockholders need to take a closer look at the fine print to figure out how to maximize gains. The deal offers US$17 (CA$21.33) in cash per share and 0.2398 shares of Penn’s common stock for each theScore share.When the deal is completed, theScore stock will be delisted. Shareholders will be given the cash and Penn stock as planned. However, Penn stock has already jumped because of the announcement. It’s now trading for US$72, which means 0.2398 is worth roughly CA$21.7 in cash. Put simply, the combined value of the deal is $43 per share currently.However, theScore stock is currently trading for just $40.8 at the time of writing. That means shareholders have little more room for upside. It could also be an opportunity for traders to make a quick buck via arbitrage."
Go Jays
I was wondering if I should sell my Score shares and buy Penn before the Special Meeting to move up the date of take over. Was waiting for the Score Bet App to be launched in Canada but it doesn't look like it will before merger.
Between the SCR deal and oncology news IDK where to look today but prospects seem interesting https://capitalmarket.exchange/bgxsq3
Do you sell or wait to January? I own 850 shares of SCR and 4500 shares of PENN. I'm strictly a Sports Betting Investor.
Well just sold my shares and used it to buy direct into PENN. Hopefully a nice surge over the next couple weeks with NFL. It was fun!
"I kind of feel like this is a no brainer to hold at this point unless your basis is super high and you just want to get out. The Penn deal backstops you at $17 USD a share, not including Penn Shares. The Penn Shares likely will go up in value as NFL season progresses - and even if they don’t, you’re at around $34 a share value currently."
Hold till $50 CAD or just transfer it all over to PENN??
congratulations to all longs!
Food for thought from a newbie. PENN acquired SCR for 2B which puts its SP evaluation at $37USDFor the shareholders the conversion is $17USD/share plus 0.2398PENN/1SCR and at current PENN pricing that would be about $14USD/1SCR Totaling $31USD/1SCR. YES there will be profit takers once the market opens but DIP or No DIP this is a really good deal for longs holding or selling.
$45 lets go
Steady climb until Ontario introduces its betting rules then …. To the moon
This stock has just been tracking PENN. why the divergence today?
What is happening!?
What if the the deal gets broken before then?
Where yall going after?
No clue why people are not selling this and just buying PENN or pENN options. This has more room to go down than up
FML!! I sold at a loss yesterday 
"It's been a hell of a ride since my initial purchase at $0.70, thanks for the good times... and the bad but I am officially taking my money and running. Good luck to all going forwards!"
Canada August 27th single game betting becomes legal
Told my hubby to put on a smile this morning before I broke the news to him. Can't wipe his grin off since. Bought in 2015 at $.58CAD/share. Cashed out a chunk today. Will hold onto the rest of my position to see how Penn does in the future. All the best to those that just bought in.
Why would anyone sell under $34?!Btw I called the buyout....CHECK THE HISTORY
Still holding… why sell for less than the price penn will pay??Performance of both companies great
Is it a 50% share and cash deak nowvor the original terms buying penn with cash part...its the 18thfor closing will know the answer soon. I think you could play now options for Penn National
I think the Fall schedule will be very kind to $PENN $DKNG $SCR $GENI . Holding PENN thru 200.
someone wanna give some options tell me what they are doing. to I wait and take the PENN or sell if it reaches a certain price. what are others doing and when does buyout happen?
"Anyone have insight on what happens to Canadian stock holders with the buy out news?is it the exact same offer converted into CAD ?First time being part of a buyout, not really sure what happens here, but all I can say is Wooooooooooooooooooo"
"This is going places folks ! Not only is it a safe investment because sportsbetting is currently going on illegally in Canada, but it is answering an economic need: the government enacted the legislation allowing it because it needs to recuperate losses on the parallel economy created by leaving it as an illegal practice, and the losses resulting from the emptied stadiums, and closed casinos during the pandemic. The rocket is launched folks! GLTA !!!"
With the difference in price isn't there currently about 1.25 a share sitting on the table if people grab Score shares?
Finally! Might break even after the 10:1 split lol. Sheesh
"Once again patience paid off! sold at $44.50 I am out, made more profit then i would've day trading every day for the last 6 months, time for some R&R :-)"
Any good portfolio manager knows to have a full position of $PENN $DKNG $SCR $GENI going into the fall. Pullbacks will likely be shallow and few through year's end.
Why is everyone selling at any price below $37CDN? You are almost guaranteed for $32US.
if scr goes down below the penn share ratio it will be bought back up to it in 5 seconds...Its a free money situation. anyone who bought above the scr penn deal day price ratio of 68$ penn or about 32$ is stuck now with scr unless you believe penn will be crashing and even still your gaurenteed 17$ so you wont get wiped out...its a very restrictive situation but a great one if your average is below 17 u.s
I have 20 shares for 47$ average and was down 75% until yesterday today it shoot up about 50% what you guys suggest hold or sell it today?
So for 100 shares would SCR holders get 1700 usd and 24 shares of penn stock?
A 63% gain is still not close to 2 billion market cap who’s holding whose selling ?
"Don’t be the person selling at $40, it’s going up!!!"
"$BRAG should hit $60-$100 to catch up to the same P/S such as $SCR $GNOG, $GAN, $DKNG"
I think it would be interesting to see how the SCR deal influences other tech and even esports like these https://capitalmarket.exchange/z9rh5k
"Under the terms of the agreement, theScore shareholders will receive US$17.00 in cash and 0.2398 shares of Penn National common stock for each theScore share, which implies a total purchase consideration of US$34.00 per theScore share based on Penn National’s 5-day volume weighted average trading price as of July 30, 2021"
Sale going through October 19th. We get .2398 if PENN plus $17/ share
"Lol RobFans and Jak sold SCR at $14 after buying it at $50, now they are bag holding FANS, hilarious"
