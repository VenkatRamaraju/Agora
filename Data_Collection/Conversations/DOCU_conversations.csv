"Worth $50 BB! Sure, no thanks"
This is a little crazy. Pretty well known company and almost nothing posted in here. I just got it a couple days ago and am enjoying the 3% uptick today. Nice to meet all three of you! ;)
Can tell this is a great stock by lack of posts 
"zoom dragging DocuSign down today. Now the key is zoom gave weaker then expected guidance. I believe this will not be the case with Docusign. I think Docusign will give stronger guidance. We shall see. I am seeing more and more docusign agreements in my daily dealings and it has nothing to do with Covid. Its just easier, efficient reduces time and cost."
"Going back to 300 soon,400 next year, 2031 will be $3000"
"Wow, very inactive board. Soon, people will realize the value here and DOCU will lose it's monicker as a ""work from home stock"". NO successful business would EVER go back to physical signature after utilizing an eSign service. And DOCU offers a slew of other products."
Docusign puzzles me. They have a dominant position in a fast growing market (digital documents and contracts)yet they flutter. I believe it is only a matter of time before this stock doubles in value. The growth rate is too high and the TAM is also massive.
wow just filled an order at 251.20 for 5k shares didn't believe it would really fill 3 weeks ago when I put it in
"If you’re a true DOCU investor it doesnt matter if the price is 200 or 400, im not selling. Huge potential. Would actually love to add shares again in low 200’s or lower but i doubt we’ll get the chance again.. maybe"

$280 incoming
Time to buy some DOCU or buy some more boys and girls! I just doubled my position for the ride back up to $300. Good luck all!
Earnings were great and future looks very bright! I feel this is a great buy on the pullback today.
"Z and $ZG own Dotloop, which is the equivalent of $DOCU. With DOCU having a $54B market cap and Z half that you have to wonder what a sum of the parts of Z and ZG might be worth. Seems like a lot more value in Z and ZG plus you get the #1 web site, all their rental platform, mortgage company, iBuyer platform. Seems like a lot of room for Z to run"
"Zacks has a sell rating on DOCU so that means DOCU will go up.Have you noticed that, in the short term, Zacks is pretty much always wrong?"
"Some companies with a larger market cap than Affirm's $38B: Coca Cola $KO, Starbucks $SBUX, TJMaxx $TJX, Docusign $DOCU, Ross Stores $ROST. Affirm is scaling their volume by about 2 X per year without purchasing inventory or real estate or fulfillment centers. Own Quality."
Same happened recently for $DOCU after earnings next day it was up more than $30. Hope the same will happen tomorrow with $ADBE
regardless of drop DocuSign blew out numbers raised guidance and has a huge market to go after. Analysts overwhelmingly raised guidance. So unless the market tanks they are a great long term play.
