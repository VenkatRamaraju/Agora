nice rebound the last couple of weeks from 4$ low...let's see if it can make one more jump above 10$ in the next year. would love to go out on 2x my entry price
Building back better...LOLz
"There is no crystal ball in cancer biotech research to let you know what will work and what won't. No question its probably the riskiest place to invest your money in the stock market. To those who bought at much higher prices, what can you say, you picked a bad time to buy shares AND THAT IS ON YOU. Our chart looks no different then that of Puma, Blue Bird, Intercept, the list goes on and on. Each of these rocketed to unsustainable levels based on promise, each has gotten crushed based on reality. So many on this board are living in the past, dwelling on their stupidity and then blaming someone else as if they are incapable of making a bad investment. It takes 7-10 YEARS to move a cancer drug through the testing process and nearly a billion dollars, a lot can go wrong in that timeframe. You are literally looking at preclinical data and making a decision on whether to put the drug in human trials. Was Pat supposed to know that we'd have two big pharma competitors with similardrugs competing against us? How much was big pharma going to pay to market Rubraca with this type of competition? We have limited resources, you can't go toe to toe with the big pharma marketing machine AND advance your pipeline. Innovate or die applies to all businesses so in my opinion Pat chose wisely to advance the pipeline. 2022 will determine the fate of CLVS, will we be absorbed into a big pharma or will we be regulated to languishing in bio-tech he!! with endless dilution and a falling share price? One thing is for sure, it won't be boring."
Will Pat the serial diluter cut a deal with 2021 note holders and swap the debt payment for 15 million shares? This move would not be beneath him and would further prove his willingness to LIE directly to shareholders.
i feel bad for all the institution that bought CLVS. they lost tons of money so far.
Guess those limos weren’t for Pat?
WTH: Rubraca CURES PANCREATIC CANCER!!! CLVS should be at $5 Billion valuation yesterday!!!Investors are bound to wake up soon!!!
"Would love a surprised news release of FAP 2286 update.....if positive, this thing will go through the roof. if negative...well, can't get much lower."
Some morning we’ll all wake up and either CLVS will be bankrupt or bought. Hoping the later.
"There is only One WAY OUT Mahaffyy. SELL your company ASAP. If not, more pain awaits you."
"I will come back a year after.... no BO, no read out, no revenue increase,...."
ATM stop selling at the moment should be moving.
"yhoo keeps deleting my posts now. Lame program and people monitoring it. I read the Q2 report (see below). It says the 75MM (75.2MM) was done/closed. So the 125MM must be new. $36.8M in Rubraca (rucaparib) global net product revenues for Q2 2021, down 8% vs. Q2 2020, due to continuing impact of COVID-19Phase 1/2 LuMIERE clinical study of FAP-2286 open for enrollment, first peptide-targeted radionuclide therapeutic candidate targeting FAP in clinical developmentThree top-line Phase 3 data read-outs for Rubraca anticipated over the next six to 18 months with potential to address larger ovarian and prostate cancerpatient populations in earlier lines of therapy$72.5M in net proceeds raised through “at-the-market” equity offering program in Q2 2021$230.2M in cash and cash equivalents and $48.1M in available funding under the ATHENA financing at June 30, 2021$33.1M or 30% reduction in R&D and SG&A expense and 22% reduction in net cash used in operating activities compared to Q2 2020"
"The thing about radio ligand therapy, with Novartis so far anyway, is that it is much more effective when its used in untreated patients. Think about the implications of that if you have a multi billion dollar cancerfranchise and FAP-2286 w/ radiation becomes a very viable option for oncologists. Are you going to wait until it becomes that or are you going to bring it in house early? The Novartis CEO is a big fan of this ""new frontier"" and why shouldn't he be? We know radiation kills cancer cells, it kills all cells. If you can deliver it on target you can minimize the damage to healthy cells and, the best you can, limit the side effects that accompanies radiation therapy. I like our FAP target, I'm sure Novartis doestoo. Can we target the cancer ? Answer that and you will know the future of CLVS."
News out on FAP. Nice!
Nice data on Lynparza+Abiriterone in Prostate.
"Management slashing the sales force was a tell for me regarding where they thought the future of the company was. You slash the sales force for one reason, to reduce cash burn, but why would you do that if youneed sales folk to compete and grow scripts of your ""flagship drug""? If you connect the dots they lead directly to FAP-2286, something at the time of the announcement, was in preclinical testing. What did they see that early in the process where they basically said F it to script growth to preserve cash and why didn't management just partner out the drug? Fast forward to January and the Novartis trial results and the extremely bullish comments by the CEO regarding Radio Ligand Therapy and I felt like I had the definitive answer about why CLVS management did what they did (and the reason they didn't partner out their drug was because that would only complicate theeventual buyout and reduce the value of the company once they had proof of concept in hand). CLVS may start PII trials with FAP-2286 but they will not finish them. IMO, management's end game is to sell the company after PI data, if successful. This radio ligand therapy is not a cure for cancer and does not come without side effects but it appears to bea very viable treatment for shrinking tumors. The thing that has to scare the daylights out of big pharma isthat it could quickly become a first choice therapy. Why? because we know radiation shrinks tumors and it appears that this therapy works best in UNTREATED PATIENTS and only shows marginal benefit at best in treated patients. That gives the oncologist a choice, forgo RL therapy for whatever, or start treatment with RL therapy and see if it works. If it doesn't give the desired result you can switch therapy's, the problem for the oncologist is it doesn't work the other way around and RL can't be the second or third choiceWhat's $5 or $6 billion to a big Pharma company who has their cash cow cancer therapies in the crosshairs ofRadio Ligand Therapy? I would again reference the Novartis' CEO comments about this being a new frontierin cancer therapy."
Real CEOs who believe in their company step up and buy a lot of stock in the open market. Pat?
"Clovis is FOR SALE… make us an offer with the highest bid … kick the CEO out, fire all sale staff and BP get Rubraca"
"Chevy, Dew Master,Robert, Morgan or Sharon. Can you summarize what that 9KD trial means? What would one want to hear Dr. Petrylak say Sunday in the mini oral presentation? Finally, what could a positive take away from that presentation be worth for helping Clovis ? Thanks ….."
where do we go from here?
This Might be the start of the short squeeze
"Read below, this excerpt defines the role split between the Clovis CEO and the board chair and how USELESS the board chair's position really is: ""The CEOis responsible for setting our strategic direction, day-to-day leadership and performance, while the Chair of the board of directors provides guidance to the Chief Executive Officer and presides over meetings of the full board of directors."" Basically Ginger Graham is a simple meeting scribe and a rubber stamper. In legitimate companies the board of directors set the corporate strategy and evaluate their CEO's ability to meet financial, strategic or operational targets. But none of that happens here, they have a multi year track record to prove this disfunctional arrangement. LAWSUITS WILL BE COMING!"
I could not have picked a worse investment if I tried...seriously try to pick a worse performer then this.... you can't.....CEO is a scammer ... fraud
"there is. no way you can bid ATM, CLVS. will stay low for the next month or so till they reach $125M"
"Fewer retail folks around on MB's, seems more like getting out rather than delay inevitable results from many trials many moons from NOW. CheckMate cohort speaker this evening on Ruca combo's..solid tumors..Is it parpi savior or sink and swim. If no cc, or PR..we sink........Body slam on Monday. Mahaffy can do what he does best AND sell more ATM in meantime."
"onclusionThe ATHENA trial was intended to assess the safety of oliceridine in a broad-based group of adult patients experiencing moderate to severe pain following surgical procedures or non-surgical medical conditions. Although the study was not powered for safety or efficacy, oliceridine IV was generally safe and well tolerated in this heterogeneous population of patients with moderate to severe acute pain for whom a parenteral opioid was warranted. Most of the patients enrolled in the ATHENA trial received oliceridine for the management of moderate to severe post-surgical acute pain. Thus, the findings in the patients with non-surgical medical conditions are limited to the patients characterized in this study and not generalizable to larger non-surgical populations. The low incidence of respiratory AEs, and PONV, along with rapid and sustained analgesia allowed for titration to a dose that provided analgesia and favorable tolerability. Oliceridine, a novel centrally acting G-protein pathway-selective µ-opioid receptor agonist may represent a potential new treatment option for patients requiring IV opioid therapy."

"Major disappointment in ceo clown and his TEAM.. NOTHING in near/mid term to hang your hat. LOTS of room for all short shenanigan's to depress clovis stock to multi year lows..MORE of the same, as last 4-5 years. WHY do instructional managers keep with inept leaders like Pat mahaffy? If tuts have to report to shareholders, how many times do you give stakeholders a sour face with losses galore in their portfolio?"
Bought more @4.68...now averaging $4.73...will buy more in the low 4s.
the XBI and IBB are just dusting their heels ~~~ expect a huge year-end rally that often times extends itself into the new year.....with clovis ditto ditto ditto.....enjoy the ride!!
For all of those who cried loud - if you not willing to hold and be patient - you shouldn't buy it to begin with
"Edward White from HC Wainwright was so disgusted in Pat Mahaffy's performance this past year that he didn't extend an invite to him for the 22nd Annual HC Waingwright Global Investment conference (held last week).

"very strong volume, somethingis up"
"For those who think I sold at the bottom, I did not. I sold in phases heading down. Avg sales were around $5 ish. Bottom line, every time I sold I immediately bought another stock which has been doing really well. Glad I sold and diversified into another firm. Don't ask me which stock - the last thing I need is to bring this voodoo karma from CLVS lol!"
Earnings Report + Pat speaking...
"Shorty hasn't had his say....wait for it....oooohh, ooooooppppss that is your ceo Mahaffy and his ATM's..what a brilliant move on any pps increase!"
"Don't get your hopes up, just look at ceo Mahaffy (nightmare) and chart of pps for any time frame. Nough said. Everything must be kept in perspective with shorts looking over shoulder BOD and CEO"
"Shorts forced to cover? What gives? The massive short interest has R- A-P-E -D the shareholders of clvs for years. A nice slow rise in pps is fine with most short sellers, as the GAINS will sustain shorty for years to come. All thanks to your wonderful CEO."
Pay the $64M due today Pat. Use cash like you said you would you miscreant excuse for a CEO.
"Clvs has only one major problem, Mahaffy. He has killed this company"
"what drivel on this board, day after day. bashing the CEO is done to erode confidence so folks sell their sharesand the bashers / shorts make money. heck of a way to make money if you ask me. Anyway, nothing is happening around here until we see the results of the FAP-2286 P1 trial sometime next year so tuning out the noise will be necessary. NVS is moving full stream ahead with their radio ligand therapy program, you can go on their website and see exactly what they are doing. I think CLVS has one of the holygrail targets for this therapy and NOVARTIS will be keenly interested in our results. Game on if this works."
Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess - if you sell they get your. $$ if you hold you will get your $$. x back
"9/9 Targeted Onc: Oncologist explains rationale for using Rucaparib over other PARPi as maintenance therapy:""Considerations for Selecting PARP Inhibitor Maintenance TherapySeptember 9, 2021Dr Ramez Eskander shares his insights on considerations for selecting appropriate PARP inhibitor therapy for patients based on molecular testing and other factors.Ramez Eskander, MD: With the evolution of PARP inhibitors as a treatment strategy in the ovarian cancer space, we’ve realized that we’ve made significant gains and have various treatment options in the setting, and it’s important to note that this patient in this clinical scenario was counseled and was treated with maintenance rucaparib in the platinum-sensitive response. Again, this patient had received maintenance bevacizumab monotherapy in the front line after initial completion of chemotherapy. It is a patient who is PARP inhibitor naïve specifically. And that’s important to remember. We know the data regarding rucaparib, the ARIEL3 clinical trial supporting the efficacy, the safety, and the tolerability of this drug, which was again given until disease progression or unacceptable adverse events. There was also an interesting abstract that was presented that compared real-world data among PARP inhibitors. There are other options for PARP maintenance in the platinum-sensitive setting in a patient who is PARP naïve. And what we saw was that rucaparib and olaparib appeared to be better tolerated than niraparib when it came to dose interruptions or dose reductions. We don’t have any head-to-head data the way that we want it, but they are data that help us contextualize potentially the treatment-related tolerability or adverse effects that may be experienced on therapy. The other important thing to note is that niraparib has an individualized starting dose, a dose that’s dependent on baseline weight and platelet count. If you have a patient who has struggled with thrombocytopenia, understanding that may guide you away potentially from one PARP inhibitor to consider another PARP inhibitor such as rucaparib for maintenance strategy. Analogously, a patient who has poorly controlled hypertension may not tolerate niraparib as well, and you might want to consider others.There are nuances here when making this decision. We know that there are multiple agents that are approved in this setting, but the patient clinical case may help inform and guide treatment choices. And again, rucaparib is dosed at 600 mg twice a day. You have multiple opportunities for dose reduction to help keep a patient on treatment, which again is the most important component to drive efficacy in this setting. I have used all PARP inhibitors in clinical practice. I’ve used them in the front line as maintenance treatment strategies. I’ve used them in the platinum-sensitive recurrent setting. I’ve used them as treatment monotherapy in the later-line setting previously. It’s important to know, the take-home message here is all of these drugs can be given. They’re given orally. You want to be thoughtful about treatment-related adverse effects, but almost universally patients can stay on treatment as long as they’re benefitting from therapy. And it’s uncommon to have to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects. And I empower you when you’re using these medications to be proactive about adverse-event mitigation strategies, dose reductions and interruptions, with a goal for continuing treatment for as long as possible. And rucaparib can be used in a setting just like this. I have many patients who are treated with rucaparib in a platinum-sensitive maintenance strategy, some with many years of benefit. I have patients treated with rucaparib as a treatment strategy.That pivots nicely into review of the ARIEL4 clinical trial. And ARIEL4 is a study that looked at rucaparib vs chemotherapy in patients with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer who were also found to have a deleterious BRCA mutation. This may not be as relevant in the future. Why? Because now we know that patients who have a BRCA mutation in the front line should be all receiving maintenance PARP in the frontline setting. When they recur, there are no data for PARP rechallenge after prior PARP yet. Those are emerging data and we’re learning more about it. But as it exists right now, it’s limited. But the ARIEL4 clinical trial looked specifically at BRCA-mutated patients, looking at rucaparib vs chemotherapy. patients were randomized to rucaparib 2:1, 600 mg orally twice daily vs physician’s choice chemotherapy. And their progression-free intervals were defined. And what we saw was a benefit when you looked at rucaparib vs chemotherapy. Patients with relapsed BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer who received rucaparib based on the ARIEL4 clinical trial had a significant improvement in progression-free survival vs standard of care chemotherapy. ..."""

"Could Trillium Fall Below $10 in 2021?A decline in the stock price plus positive clinical data equals opportunity.Jason Hawthorne(Tmfbonefish)Dec 16, 2020 at 7:57PMTrillium's journey started last year with a new CEO and a doubling down on a potential treatment for blood cancers. The focus paid off. Early results from a phase 1 study in January showed the company's two drug candidates, TTI-621 and TTI-622, demonstrated the ability to block the signal that nearly all cancer cells use to cloak themselves from the immune system. That was enough to get Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) attention. The drug giant invested $25 million into Trillium in September. Investors have plenty of reason to be excited. Another company developing a drug to block cancer's cloaking defense is Forty Seven, which Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) bought in March for $4.9 billion. Unlike Forty Seven's drug, magrolimab, which works in combination with other treatments, Trillium's drug has shown the ability to work by itself.Anything can happenOf course, in investing almost anything could happen. So, yes, Trillium shares could fall below $10. Investors should be asking themselves if it matters. With a string of positive results and a market capitalization less than one-fourth the buyout price of a peer, any significant decline appears to be a buying opportunity for those with patience."

CLVS won't be filing 5 earnings reports if FAP-2286 works
"In this palliative use setting, FAP-2286 was administered on a named-patient basis to 11 patients with progressive and metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, breast, rectum, and ovary after prior confirmation of FAP expression. According to the authors, administration of 177Lu-FAP-2286 demonstrated high uptake and long retention in primary and metastatic tumor lesions and an acceptable toxicity profile. The report concludes that the data warrant further investigation of 177Lu-FAP-2286 in clinical studies to systematically evaluate its safety and efficacy, and to define the patient population who would benefit most from treatment."

"Thank you Box Fan for your words of wisdom. I hope some of our serial Pat bashers take your advise and leave this stock.In case you all haven't figured this out yet, investing in CLVS is ALL about FAP-2286. Everything else is justnoise and Bolshevik. Pat has basically gone all in on FAP-2286 and the stock will bounce around until we know if FAP-2286 works or not. If it works the company will be sold before the end of 2022, if it doesn't then wall st will crush this stock."

"I spent a little time to compare the Novartis NVS FDA approved radioligand therapy to treat prostate cancer Novartis uses 177LU-prostate specific membrane antigen in their Program. PSMA is present in 80% of advanced prostate cases and is a cell surface marker in these adenoca prostate patients. The study that was FDA approved first started recruiting patients in May 2017 so it took three plus years from start to approval date. Now by contrast CLVS uses FAP-2286 which is fibroblast activating protein and is increased in many solid adeno tumors including but not limited to the prostate in their study with adeno ca. So they can be used in colon cancer and pancreatic cancer to name two. FAP increases the more aggressive a tumor becomes and this is a phenomenon of nature that Clvs is using to target and exploit in these cancers in a novel way. Drew master just sited an article on the first message board page where FAP was being combined with 177Lu, the radioisotope used by Novartis with their FDA approved drug. So Fap's market should ultimately expand to include multiple adeno carcinomas and this would be a unique approach in contrast to the Novartis program. Hopefully FAP-2286 will have the same radiolabeling ability of the Novartis drug and this should be known in the next year. Novartis's ceo in his latest quarterly report said that their compound for prostate cancer should be worth 10 billion dollars a year ""and that is just the tip of the iceberg""..."
"Position yourself for a Rally ~~ From Trading Nation:Traders debate whether biotech is a buy after bounceBiotechnology stocks could be headed for an even bigger bounce.The iShares Biotechnology ETF (IBB) edged lower Friday after catching some momentary reprieve in Thursday’s trading session as the recent sell-off in speculative trades slowed.There’s likely more upside in store, at least according to the ETF’s technical layout, Miller Tabak’s Matt Maley told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Thursday.“When you see big downdrafts like we’ve just seen, that’s an opportunity where you can add to those positions,” the firm’s chief market strategist said.The IBB’s relative strength index, a key momentum gauge, recently hit its most oversold level since 2018, which has only happened a handful of times in the last several years, Maley said.“Each time, that’s resulted in a huge bounce in the group, anywhere from 18%-40%,” Maley said. “I think this is a great entry point. Even if you’re just a short-term trader, this is something that should allow you to get a nice rally into the end of the year.”A similar momentum buildup is happening in shares of Moderna, which have lost nearly 30% in value over the last two weeks amid Merck’s antiviral Covid pill news and the broader growth sell-off, Maley said.“Its RSI chart is down to a level that it’s only been down three other times in the last year,” he said.“All three of those times, the thing has rallied anywhere from 28%-60% over the next several months,” Maley said. “I think this is a great entry point for long-term investors and even short-term ones who like to be a little bit more on the active trading side of things.”Not only has the IBB outperformed the S&P 500 since its inception in 2001 — up more than 361% versus the S&P’s roughly 226% gain — but it could continue to do so, BK Asset Management’s Boris Schlossberg said in the same interview.“Life sciences just generally as a sector is going to be one of the key sectors of the 21st century,” said Schlossberg, who is managing director of FX strategy at his firm.“This is one of those types of sectors that you simply cannot ignore. It’s going to be a core holding for any investor,” he said. “Whatever sell-offs we have, whatever dips we have in this sector are very much temporary. You’ve got to just buy the dip here all the way through.”"

$CLOV double digits coming! $CLVS is next
With 24% of the float sold short the Clovis stock price could explode anytime!
Keith accomplished his goal. He kept the retail investors out just long enough
Clovis needs to add another 9 board members. Not enough group think there already.
@Anthony Who bought these diluted shares?Why did he sell for $4-8 instead of $40?Who held these shares? retail?Where are they?What is the insider owner ratio? why is it so low?
clovis is a 8 usd stock
its 6 on the charts not 3 on the charts ~~ coming to your portfolio as money managers return from their summer hiatus and hunt the bargain bin (biotech)......enjoy 6 short term and a much higher price as the Clovis pipeline gathers steam (think of a fast moving money train) lol
"the only advice to those who invest in CLVS do not pay attention to the garbage on the board, be smart and do your own research and rely on the data the only reason it is down is ATM it will go up soon"

"Sharon, actually I think the fed will continue to keep money plentiful. They don’t have any choice. They can’t raise rates. With mid term elections coming, clueless prez will tell feds to just keep printing. So we may very well not see something happen until that’s over. I just hope and am thinking bio tech will see a run, Clovis will have released great news, then we can prepare for what we know is coming. It’s all good. I believe we’re on the right path here with Clovis in particular. Keep the faith!!!"
Fire Mahaffy and make Clovis great again - spinning off Rubraca to BP and keep R&D for a pure bio play with FAP 2286
Averaged up yesterday. Sentiment towards clvs has turned bullish.
the biotech index as i have said over and over is having a horrible year otherwise; clovis would be at the higher end of its trading range........so crank it up shorts you have perhaps minus 3 before liftoff and i mean for clovis......that said; the biotech index will soar taking clovis with it once we get thru the Halloween crowd and right now that crowd is in our nations capitol fighting over how much money should be burned and gone forever (stimulus that they call infrastructure).......a resolution or passing of a mutual infrastructure bill will send the markets soaring.......if the dems get all the loot they want then i am not sure ~~ perhaps the markets will sell ~~~ 7 trillion is hard to digest especially when you get nothing from it but a thanks from the ones on the take......my opinion only ~~~~~

The worst feeling it's to learn how to be patient - and finally those who find the key into it will succeedvery probable or likely It's more than likely that this will bounce back to 6 or 7 but it will never fly because of the ATM and shorts can peacefully sleep the PAT will cover them 
I think the company is expecting a big spike in the share price sometime soon and that is why they want to prepare to sell shares in the open market. They have plenty of cash to last them through this year and most of next year so this announcement is deliberately timed . You heard it here first folks :)....buying more in the low 4s.
"Patrick J. Mahaffy (Chairman of the Board) FLXN / CEO Clovis :Pacira will pay $8.50 a share in cash for Burlington, Massachusetts-based Flexion, according to a statement. That values Flexion’s equity at $450 million, for a deal value of roughly $630 million including debt -- a 47% premium over Flexion’s closing price Friday. The transaction also includes a contingent value right, or CVR, that will pay out as much as $8 per Flexion share if certain sales and regulatory milestones are met."
the reversal in numerous biotech stocks this week were ambushed by the sad events in Afghanistan that pushed stocks lower......biotech has bottomed imo and any sell-off is a buying opportunity clovis included......God Bless our brave military and Pray they return home safely while there is so much hate in this world ~~ Pray it is diminished by Divine Intervention from our Heavenly Father and Creator ~~~~
This story is over unfortunately. I lost a ton. The only way out is to sell the assets.
Did Pat pay off the debt with cash or give away 15 million shares in a crooked deal? Pat has shown in the past an ability to do highly damaging dilutive deals in managing debt. They have him over a log.

"Report out: Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) drives high grade bladder cancer.

FAP has been linked to worse prognosis and therapy resistance in several cancers. We hypothesised that FAP might have a prognostic 3biomarker potential to stratify patients with high-grade (HG) T1 non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). We selected 30 patients with HG T1 NMIBC that progressed to ≥T2 disease which were pair-matched based on CUETO progression score variables with 90 patients that did not progress. After revision a final cohort of 86 patients was retained. Slides were stained for FAP, the luminal marker GATA3 and the basal marker CK5. All HG T1 tumour regions of interest (ROIs) within each patient were annotated, analysed and scored using image analysis software. FAP expression in HG T1 ROIs was significantly higher in progressors vs. non-progressors and was prognostic for recurrence-free survival, progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival. FAP expression in HG T1 ROIs remained strongly prognostic for these outcomes in a bivariable model corrected for adequate BCG per FDA definition. Expression of GATA3 and CK5 did not differ between progressors vs. non-progressors, and were not prognostic for these outcomes. FAP might serve as an easily applicable prognostic biomarker to risk-stratify patients with HG T1 NMIBC if these results are prospectively validated in a larger series."

Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have demonstrated substantial improvement in progression-free survival as monotherapy maintenance treatment in the frontline setting versus active surveillance. Furthermore, preclinical and early clinical studies have shown that PARP inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors have synergistic antitumor activity and may provide an additional therapeutic option for patients in this population.Primary objectives: In women with newly diagnosed ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer, we wish to assess the efficacy of frontline maintenance treatment with the PARP inhibitor rucaparib versus placebo following response to platinum-based chemotherapy (ATHENA-MONO), and to assess the combination of rucaparib plus nivolumab (a programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1)-blocking monoclonal antibody) versus rucaparib alone (ATHENA-COMBO).Study hypothesis: (1) Maintenance therapy with rucaparib monotherapy may extend progression-free survival following standard treatment for ovarian cancer in the frontline setting. (2) The combination of nivolumab plus rucaparib may extend progression-free survival following standard treatment for ovarian cancer in the frontline setting compared with rucaparib alone.Trial design: ATHENA is an international, randomized, double-blind, phase III trial consisting of two independent comparisons (ATHENA-MONO and ATHENA-COMBO) in patients with newly diagnosed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. Patients are randomized 4:4:1:1 to the following: oral rucaparib+ intravenous nivolumab (arm A); oral rucaparib + intravenous placebo (arm B); oral placebo+ intravenous nivolumab (arm C); and oral placebo + intravenous placebo (arm D). The starting dose of rucaparib is 600 mg orally twice a day and nivolumab 480 mg intravenously every 4 weeks. ATHENA-MONO compares arm B with arm D to evaluate rucaparib monotherapy versus placebo, and ATHENA-COMBO evaluates arm A versus arm B to investigate the effects of rucaparib and nivolumab in combination versus rucaparib monotherapy. ATHENA-MONO and ATHENA-COMBO share a common treatment arm (arm B) but each comparison is independently powered.Major inclusion/exclusion criteria: Patients ≥18 years of age with newly diagnosed advanced, high-grade epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who have achieved a response after completion of cytoreductive surgery and initial platinum-based chemotherapy are enrolled. No other prior treatment for ovarian cancer, other than the frontline platinum regimen, is permitted.Primary endpoint: The primary endpoint is investigator-assessed progression-free survival by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1.Sample size: Approximately 1000 patients have been enrolled and randomized.Estimated dates for completing accrual and presenting results: The trial completed accrual in 2020. While dependent on event rates, primary results of ATHENA-MONO are anticipated in early 2022 and results of ATHENA-COMBO are anticipated to mature at a later date.Trial registration: This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03522246).Keywords: BRCA1 protein; BRCA2 protein; homologous recombination; ovarian neoplasms."
"PFE paid up for TRIL, as will the company that buys us, IF FAP-2286 works as advertised. No one will pay theprice for CLVS until they know FAP-2286 can target & light up the cancer. CLVS will start the PII trials but they will not finish them, that will be for someone else. FAP is highly expressed in nearly 90% of cancers, not expressed, but highly expressed. All the biggies, the most difficult to treat and pancreatic cancer is one that the company is targeting for a PII trial very early in the process. It won't be the first but its in the top 5 according to the company. The price tag for CLVS will surprise many and destroy some. BMY, PFE, & NVS are my horses, BMY is my top pick, they need this the most. PFE has the cash and the bulk and NVS is the leader in radio ligand so they have to be interested. Can we light it up is literally the multi billion dollar question that will be answered shortly. Success in the FAP P1 trial and we go to + $20, failure < $2, there is no safety net, its either straight up or straight down. Isn't cancer biotech investing fun?"
"I'm feeling a short squeeze, maybe beginning in the last hour of today's trading. Yesterday's end of day sell-off could help to set the stage as no one is expecting it considering late day trading of late. If this baby is getting bought for above 30- the stock will rise in anticipation! ESCO coming..... I never make these predictions so don't humiliate me too bad is I am wrong!!"
FAP AACR poster very interesting - possible game changer for hard to treat cancers like pancreatic.Can just imagine Roberto and Co scratching their heads reading it.
"Wow, the price is really taking off here! Lol. As long as the fraudulent Mahaffy is still milking the equity dry for his own monetary benefit the price will not move."
I believe that Mr. Mahaffy is a director on the board of Flexion. Look how the shareholders were treated in the recent proposed sale of Flexion to Pacira Bio.We can expect the same treatment should CLVS get an offer.
CLVS historians: whatever happened in 2017 that the stock started tanking from $75 and never looked back?
"This company is done all due to inept management. Period. They had a good drug but squandered it's potential. They could have raised capital when sp was in the $40's but he waited for single digits. He didn't partner or sign a licensing deal. He continues to borrow, dilute, borrow, dilute. Lynparza and Zejula are so far ahead of Rubraca it will be almost impossible to catch up. BP knows this and therefore are not thirsty for Rubraca. FAP is a potential but when will it show efficacy? 1 year? 2 years? Where will the sp be then? Oh and management doesn't care because that's another 2 years of making salary bank meanwhile shareholders take it in the keister. I lost a fortune investing in CLVS from $13 to $4 but I finally decided I wasn't going ot take it anymore and furthermore, I felt extremely foolish putting my faith in a drunk incompetent's selfish CEO. Fact is he's not coming to the rescue. Time to rescue myself. And build back better....LOL (that was for sharon)."
"CLVS stock is currently $1.80 above all time lows and a whopping -$96.00 below all time highs. So it's either highly undervalued or grossly mismanaged and plagued with debt. About $600M worth of debt (much of it convertible). Monkeys with the blinders on will believe it's simply undervalued because they comprehend the size of debt anchor Pat Mahaffy has created, not to mention the horrible operational and sales management on display for years."
"All these conspiracy about some ""organized shorts""... SMDH...Come on, MRNA dropped what like $150 per share during last couple weeks. There is so much money to be made for some really ""organized shorts"". The truth is, that with absence of a catalyst, CLVS stock price is grinded by possibly just one algo, and all the algo is doing is keeping the stock price at such level where as many call options expire worthless as possible."
"Clovis reminds me a lot of Celldex (CLDX) except CLDX had much more despised CEO. A 4$ slaughtered stock, the company CLDX went in a new direction and put the oncology pipeline on the back burner to focus on a mast cell inhibitor. Only one or two members of the message board realized the potential. Without any fanfare from the company the stock went from sub $4 to $48 in 15 months. I see the same thing happening here with FAP. In short order the price will go up as informed institutions and retail investors get on board. I predict that one day soon the stock will be in double digits and the name Patty will not dominate this hater's message board!"
Hey long term shareholders How's it hanging?
just as i said weeks ago expect a strong rally with the IBB/XBI to close out the year while oversold conditions may prolong the rally; so will the cash investors hold (stimulus and sign on bonuses) and the cash millennials hold (inheritence).....THEN we have the hedgefunds that will go long oversold biotech ~~~ this is all good for clovis.......go go go
"going back to 3’s, there is no catalyst for sp to increase. Management might as well be Goldman Sachs."
Clovis has done absolutely NOTHING to monetize its assets. And if you blindly think their FAPing trial is any different then you should look at their history of execution and commercial follow through and ask yourself how they can continue to lead a publicity traded company with such prolonged dismal results.
Often CLVS follows PBYI within a day or two delay. That one is up 6+% on a bad day like today. Read into it what you will !
"Correct me if I am wrong, but does CLVS pay PFE a royalty for Rubraca? So why would a company want to buy them out?"
"The Clovis updated slide deck conveniently omitted any asterisks and notation of the Athena monotherapy arm delay. During the last ER they spent a good amount of time talking around ""event rates taking longer to accrue"". Mahaffyy better be CAREFULL in introducing BIAS in his calculation of PFS based on the scan time points they defined in their protocol. I suspect that's how they're gaming the last remaining data points hoping to skew the event data as much as possible. Mahaffyy has cheated before and is desperate enough to hope he won't get caught again."

"10/12 Pharm Times: KOL's Dr. Morris and Dr. Shah on Rucaparib in ovarian cancer pts. Rucaparib testing in platinum-refractory ovarian cancer patients differentiates it from other PARPi. Preliminary results demonstrate efficacy in a subset of platinum-resistant OC patients:""Patient Eligibility for the Use of PARP Inhibitors in Ovarian CancerOctober 12, 2021sults show Ruca efficacy in PR patients but extrapolation to larger PR patient population Bhavesh Shah, RPh, BCOP; and Thomasina Morris, RPh, MHA, BCOP, detail what makes a patient eligible to receive PARP inhibitors as second-line maintenance for the management of ovarian cancer.Thomasina Morris, RPh, MHA, BCOP: Most of the data out there have been for platinum-sensitive. With the platinum sensitivity, it also shows that they have a better progression-free survival with a PARP inhibitor if they are BRCA mutated. Platinum resistance or refractory is a lot harder; in essence, they’re going to recur much quicker. You want to get them to a point where you can say they’re stable. You don’t want to switch them to something if it’s working; if you feel like you put them on another treatment and you haven’t exhausted what you’re already giving them, where are you truly giving them the benefit? The studies aren’t looking at platinum-refractory currently. They probably have small cohorts in the study, or supplemental material that says we looked at it, but the numbers are small. I think when we look at platinum-refractory, we don’t really think about PARP inhibitors as an option right now.However, there’s an ARIEL4 study with rucaparib that also talks about giving platinum in platinum-sensitive patients, and paclitaxel in platinum-resistant patients, and doing a comparative in there. It’s coming, but it’s just not as fast as what we have seen with the platinum sensitivity. It’s interesting because when you talk about biomarkers, when patients with breast cancer are treated, they go through a number of biomarkers now, more so than they ever did in the past; everybody else is catching up. They’re trying to do as much as breast does, but breast has been doing it for a long time. With ovarian cancer, the GYN [gynecologist] oncologist is excited, saying, “We get to do more than just a CA 125 [cancer antigen 125].” They’re just thrilled that they can now look and talk to these patients and say, “I can give you more options at the time of diagnosis.” I think that’s what’s so important.Bhavesh Shah, RPh, BCOP: I totally agree. There is subset analysis with a small number of patients, not recommending this, but in the Rubraca [rucaparib] trial, there was a small subset of platinum-refractory patients who were included. It’s hard to extrapolate the benefit in the general platinum-refractory patient population; based on the mechanism, it may not be as active as patients who are platinum-sensitive."""

"Barry Cohen @ GuruFocus: CLVS and DNLI most likely biotechs to be acquired:Biotech Takeovers Moved at Snail's Pace in 2nd QuarterTotal value of deals was only $3.2 billionAuthor's Avatar Barry Cohen Aug 30, 2021 SummaryBiotechs’ high valuations and access to capital among reasons for slowdown.Another concern is threat of antitrust interference by governments.Look for Amgen, Biogen, Pfizer, Merck and Eli Lilly to ignite new activity.Clovis Oncology Inc. (CLVS, Financial) and Denali Therapeutics Inc. (DNLI, Financial) are among the most likely biotechs to be acquired, according to industry publications. Denali, by far, would be the most expensive of the pair with a market cap of $6.4 billion, while Clovis is far more digestible with a market value of only $567 million.But the rate of acquisitions in the space needs to pick up the pace if any deals are going to get done. According to the pharma consultant firm Evaluate, takeovers ground to a halt in the second quarter after a tepid performance for the first three months of the year.During the April to June time frame, only a single deal was worth more than $1 billion, and quarterly transaction values and deal counts were the lowest in five years. “Yet, while biotech is still in an overall bull market, the year so far has been decidedly choppy, which normally would have provided plenty of buying opportunities,” reported Evaluate.A total of only 24 deals were consummated in the second quarter, with a combined value of just $3.2 billion. That lackluster showing was far below the $20.3 billion in the first three months of the year, a figure that was nothing to rave about either. Moreover, the $3.2 billion of transactions made it the worst for mergers and acquisitions in more than a decade. The last time things were this soft was in the third quarter of 2011, when $3.7 billion changed hands. In the second quarter, nothing even came close to AstraZeneca’s (AZN, Financial) buyout of Alexion last December. In fact, the biggest deal was MorphoSys’ (MOR, Financial) $1.7 billion acquisition of Constellation.So what’s to account for the drastic slowdown? There seem to be many factors, starting with the high valuations of many small biotechs. Members of Big Pharma just aren’t finding any bargains out there. Another reason is more and more biotechs don’t need to go the acquisition route given they can readily access funds from both public and private investors.Another factor cited by Evaluate is concerns that governments are looking askance at combinations because of antitrust implications. “Though the scope of these proposals could indeed threaten all pharma M&A, given that it is driven by a desire to curb companies’ pricing power and ultimately make drugs more affordable, how this might play out is still unclear,” Evaluate wrote.If and when M&A activity does pick up, Clovis and Denali could be the most coveted of the biotechs.Clovis’ leading medication is Rubraca, which is approved for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer as well as for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. The company also has a solid pipeline targeting various types of cancer. The company could be a nice fit for a pharma looking to get into or expand its portfolio of cancer medications.In May, Boulder, Colorado-based Clovis announced it would sell up to $75 million in new stock.

CEO is a joke #1 sourse of revenue is a dilution with and FDA approved drug.. he derves a raise....why not is he obviously underpaid for driving a company into the ground... FYI: only a true criminal would destroy a company and conti to pay himself 7 x the average ceo pay for a bio company
(ETTX) $2.80--2xBIG Phase 3 Drugs with data readout in October = $10++ comingg

I haven’t seen any news on the $64 million payment?
this is hopeless!
"Now would be a good time for that dill dough Mahaffy to announce a 50% reduction of employees. 430 employees, doing what? I bet there is a lot of computer solitaire going on."
We are due for one of those random spikes to $7-8 lasting 3-4 days any day now.
"I am here to warn others before they add or put $$ into this scam stock.. If you take off your rose colored glasses, you will see the price and market cap only decline. Ask yourself why? Don’t listen to standard jibberish about needing more money for trials. CLVS is a commercial stage bio and failing at it because revenues are declining and losing market share. Cash flow is negative. Lucitanib development has spent over half a billion and it’s a dud. Management failures at each chapter of its existence."
Sell and buy crypto. You will get all losses back. Thank me later
CLVS is done. I am selling everything. Until PAT(CEO) is fired or he resigns this will continue. Stock price is going to continue down with CLVS selling shares to continue this ponzi scheme. I wish I was wrong. Been in this for years. Pat is milking company for 7 million a year with no results. No more of my money to keep this going. I feel sorry for the longs. Stock market is the highest in history and this stock is near 52 week low. What do you think will happen when market crashes.
"Now lets see, who do you think is right, Vanguard or our resident shorts and Pat bashers? Biotech is all about where you buy it and where the company is in its life cycle, both of these have to match up. The goal is to minimize the risk while capturing the full reward and I think buying anywhere under $4.50 / $5 does just that.You have $3 a share risk buying this today, failure of FAP-2286 will be meet with an avalanche of selling andwe will go under $2 post haste. Success and we will be bought out, that is all but certain. This FAP target could be the holy grail of this radio ligand therapy. Imagine being able to image pancreatic cancer while itsstill treatable in its early stage, wall St would eat that stuff up."
This company has a good drug in Rubraca. It isn’t a great drug like Opdivo. The problem is that the CEO keeps selling shares. And Clovis can’t move up because it’s waited down with dilution. Good medicine. Poor investment quality here I’m afraid.
"Larry, I think this will play out like the ARRY buyout a few years ago. ARRY traded between $4-$7 for quite a long time and then they released very positive news. The stock climbed into the teens then into the $20's and then the $48 offer came in. Again, IF FAP-2286 reports positive P1 data I we could see a serious run. ARRY did not have the short interest or the Robinhood crowd ready to bounce when they smell blood in the water that CLVS has. We are of course toast if it doesn't work."
CEO Mahaffyy created a zombie stock. Quite the accomplishment for someone earning $3 million in annual compensation
"Clvs pps behaves like the company that has NO phase III trials (2, no less), that has NO FDA approvals for its flagship product, that it has no sales qtr to qtr, that it has NO disruptor drug for unmet medical needs. So, you ask what gives with the price of the stock? Bring in the leadership, WS sees the misgivings and transgressions of ceo Mahaffy with lack of fiduciary with its shareholders, the 'selling the farm' attitude with creative financing debt. The ATM,s and convertibles are the MARK OF DEATH for stake holders resulting in POWER SHORT SELLERS in command."
Funny how you can’t comment of CLVS social media platforms. They turned it off!  wonder why?
"I don’t understand Pat , when the SP is in lower 4’s what is the need for the news of increasing ATM from $75 M to $125 M ….either he and rest of the BODs have lost it or there is something brewing …I hope later is true"
"I agree with those who are saying FAP is the golden ticket. I also agree that Pat is not intentionally tanking the company. I think he’s made some serious missteps the last few years that has seen resulted in shareholder value vanishing. We are allowed to criticize poor performance gosh! Do any of you honestly think this has been anything other than poor performance? This company and stock until now has been an utter failure, if you think otherwise well you’re delusional. Does that mean the future is bleak? Not necessarily, things can be turned around with FAP but we all know that is at least 12-18 months away. Athena should have been reading out now and that’s what I was waiting for patiently, accepting losses red day after red day I stuck through it because I thought Athena would gives us that nice bounce or squeeze BUT they just stayed during this last ER there will be NO phase III readouts for another 6-18 months!! Now there are those who are trying to interpret what this means but I will take it on face value which is simply that there are no known catalysts at this point for another 6 months at least and we know they are bleeding cash, revenues are declining, and Pat has already filed for an AM dilution because he KNOWS they will need even more cash for the longer runway and I’m not about to wait it out until we bleed down to $2 hoping Pat pulls a rabbit out of his hat. Sorry I gave it 2 years and lost a fortune already and will not see it all go. Maybe in January 2022 I may decide to bet on Athena results but right now I don’t see anything to get excited about. I was the biggest BO speculator on here for the last 2 years and I’ve finally concluded that there is likely no suitors or Pat would have done it by now. And there is likely no partnership as he would need to keep diluting, he would partner and use that influx of cash, why hasn’t it happened yet? Well one would have to think there is no interest. Others are saying Pfizer might be interested because if the newly appointed board member...Rubraca is Pfizer’s old drug that they sold to CLVS years ago so I don’t think they will want to buy back their old compound for billions when the sold that same compound to clvs for 15 million of which they get royalties from, sorry but I don’t see pfizer as a buyer of Clvs. Not now anyway maybe in a year or 2 when FAP matures and potentially results in impressive data, until then I see a fledgling struggling financially strapped small company for the foreseeable future. If I’m wrong someone give me the bull case, I’m all ears!"
the Autumn Rally has begun for biotech ~~ buy your ticket now (clvs).....of course there could be a sept/oct surprise but the trend should be up......you say what?? lol
"The ONLY milestones that fraudulent Mahaffy is interested in achieving are related to these:On March 1, 2021, as CEO, Mr. Mahaffy received stock options to purchase 380,000 shares of our common stock under the following conditions:1) 80,000 will vest if the Company meets or exceeds its budgeted product revenue for 2021;2) 40,000 will vest if the Company selects an alpha-emitter agent for use in the study of its product candidate FAP-2286 by December 31, 2021;3) 40,000 will vest if the Company completes enrollment of three dose cohorts in the Phase 1 study of 177Lu-FAP-2286 by December 31, 2021; and4) 220,000 shares will vest over a four-year periodThe 220,000 option award is already in the bank for him because they compensation committe led by a cookie baker (Ginger Graham) is a rubber stamping idiot."
"Put on your reading glasses and read carefully the last sentence regarding the Clovis Athena TPG loan repayment terms: ""Clovis Oncology CEO Patrick Mahaffy has engineered a risky gamble to pay for his big Phase III study combining his PARP Rubraca with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo. He’s borrowing up to $175 million for his Phase III ATHENA trial, and he’s committed to paying back up to twice that amount for the cash runway."" The House of Horrors that Pat built...."
"Folks - take a look at RNXT - this is a device company - with just 8 mln shares. They issued 2 mln shares for $9, very niche product. What you donated to MOFU Mahaffy and gang could be recovered. All niche device companies are being acquired to bigger players like Abbott and Medtronics.This will be bought out. Buy and hang in tight, you will be rewardedAs for as Clvs - jmho it is over and lost its glamour. MOFU Mahaffy by his greed destroyed Clvs.Gl!"
"“In the 17 months since Clovis won an approval for their PARP drug Rubraca, the reality of anemic sales revenue against a backdrop of major league competition has crushed its shares and raised doubts about its future.” Sell the company Mahaffy, you’re the laughing stock of the industry!"
"Very long weekend to convalesce about your financial investment in CLOVIS? Sad as it is, CEO Pat Mahaffy is said to act on shareholder's behalf? That what fiduciary duty is, to preserve good faith and trust in the enlighten one. Good old Pat, party like it is 1999, as his shareholders have lost 95% since 2017-18. BOD should be strung up"
Mahaffy going for broke bringing down the price. Only a Mahaffy tries to accelerate bankruptcy!
"Classic Clovis, Friday tank and probably a run to 5 that will fail. Again."
"Jerry, I hope you cover soon. You won’t like what happens when Patty runs out of shares to peddle to all his cronies."
"Morgan,Sharon, & Dew Master, I agree with all of you. I look at the GLASS like its half full not half empty. Morgan, after looking at your comment about you not wanting to be held accountable but you think something will happen that will be a good price soon. I’ve been saying for sometime now I have a strong belief we’re very close to see something happen for Clovis that will be fairly soon. I’ve been thinking before the end of September possibly. For those who have lost the vision, or hope for Clovis , I’ve been discouraged before, but I’ve learned it’s not over till it’s over. Stay tuned , it’s my hope Chevy and many others will be pleasantly surprised. I wish the best for all of you staying with CLVS. Sometimes there’s pain before gain, and a storm before the rainbow, BUT IMO , the RAINBOW is coming, Start looking for it as it’s coming SOON!!"
Pat is the grand Pariah of biotech.

"Clovis is resting today, perhaps a day at the spa for the bulls soon to be millionaires.....get ready to rumble...:)"
"Only a crooked CEO named Mahaffy would make a deal like this ""we agreed to issue to the holder a number shares of our common stock utilizing an exchange ratio that is based in part on the daily volume-weighted average prices (“VWAPs”) per share of our common stock during a seven-day pricing period following execution of the agreement."" A crooked demonic CEO playing along and favoring his investment banking friends over common shareholders."
Congrats guys. This is definitely the beginning of the end
Yep heard that since 80 average down on sale yep
"I am sorry but CLVS stock is garbage. I am still holding, been in for a couple years. Same old story. They need to fire the CEO Mahaffy who is overpaid with no results. Granted CLVS has some good drugs. But if no good management or good marketing it does not matter. As low as it is it is tempting to buy more. But I have seen this story too many times. Yea it might pop one day but then come right back down. I am so glad I got most of my money in other great stocks. I feel sorry for CLVS shareholders. I have traded CLVS over the last six months to recover some of my lost money in CLVS. I still do not see how the Management board is accepting this company performance. If I performed like this CEO Mahaffy I would be fired immediately. His pay should be tied to performance. Just hoping this message gets to higher management to do something with this CEO Mahaffy. Good luck."
"Don't listen to the pumpers on here telling you they're buying all the way down. There is a liquidation sale ongoing here that will not stop, the stock has been weak for years and management has floundered. These pumpers are planted here by the hedge funds selling off and distributing to retail."
Good gain on STRONG volume!
"Management this bad is destined for bankruptcy. Pat taking direction from his British stooges and the cookie baker Ginger Graham rubber stamps all of Mahaffy's botched ""strategies"". A disastrous performance of lies and deceit they uphold for years."

"Hopefully the ATM is shut down and we can go into 2022 without the overhang of more dilution. Plenty ofnews for Rubraca and of course FAP-2286 next year. We'll likely stay below $5 for the remainder of the yearbut that's OK, I'm waiting for the data. We've been reading these stories for a few years now that CLVS might be a target for big pharma, recent institutional buying might suggest they are thinking 2022 might be the time for that to happen."
The realistic offer for this company would be something that contains a CVR attachment with offer of $12-15 . No reason to pay more for this company as it sits and it’s runway about to end .
"just more market manipulation (sector rotation).......the Prez is weighing in on stocks with his Delta trade.....so its sell growth, speculative trades and biotech and buy anything that will prosper from the Delta variant.....i though we had a vaccine ~~~ perhaps not working so good meaning we may need umpteen boosters.....lol to the Prez and his group of Scientists and Achievers (dr. Lauci)......:)"
"Clovis Oncology has its roots in the shady investment banking world. CEO (Mahaffyy) has a history in the investment banking industry and no background in bio chemistry or business operations. The prior Clovis chairman of the board (Dr. James Barrett), another venture capitalist, was forced to resign in 2019 (after the epic collapse from $100 to $10). Evidence shows that Pat has built a real House of Horrors with his investment banking cronies lurking behind every suspect debt or equity transaction, without a care for common equity investors. He is simply beholden to his debt lenders and he lies to common shareholders to advantage his debt holders transactions. Drip, drip, drip, the truth about the demon Pat Mahaffyy must be told."
"SC1, cancer drug research is a total crapshoot and Rubraca is a good drug but it has big pocketed competitors. DO you really think we could go toe to toe with not one but two big boys? I'm sure when they embarked on the P1 trial they had no idea they would have two other competitors successfully complete their trials and getapproval but it is what it is. You send a lot of time dwelling on the past when investing is a forward looking business. The future for CLVS is FAP-2286 with a little Rubraca sprinkled in. Kudos to Pat for securing FAP-2286 early, a forward looking move, time will tell if he and management chose the right path for the company."

"ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04209595 (LX038 (PEGylated SN38) and Rucaparib in Solid Tumors and Small Cell Cancers) has been suspended pending approval of an amendment. Maybe good, maybe bad but it fits the theme of constant trial delays with incompetent Mahaffyy at the helm."

"AJFAH Cancer Conference '21: Rucaparib featured by Dr. Kim Reiss-Binder in her presentation on targeted therapies for pancreatic cancer. Dr. Reiss-Binder described an ""incurable"" pancreatic cancer patient that she first treated in 2014 as part of a clinical trial. Today, 7 years later, the incurable PC patient is still in stable condition on Rucaparib maintenance treatment. Ruca relevant excerpts from a 10/7 synopsis of her presentation:"" ‘Tip of the Iceberg’: More Targeted Therapies for Pancreatic Cancer to ComeOctober 7, 2021Ryan McDonaldThere’s a tremendous amount of interest in immunotherapy drugs given alongside targeted therapies for patients with pancreatic cancer, according to an expert.For the longest time, there were no active therapy options for patients with pancreatic cancer and survival was “horrifyingly” short, according to Dr. Kim A. Reiss Binder.However, that all changed in 2001 and has been steadily improving over the past two decades.Binder, an assistant professor of medical oncology at the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania, recently highlighted what’s new in the treatment of pancreatic cancer during the 12th Annual Joining FORCES Against Hereditary Cancer Conference. But before she discussed the newer developments in the treatment of the disease, Binder reviewed the history of platinum-based chemotherapies and how they have improved outcomes. Moreover, she discussed how the development of targeted therapies for the disease is just getting started..........To discuss this point further, she cited a personal experience with a patient in her clinic. The patient, according to Binder, was diagnosed with operable pancreatic cancer in 2012. He underwent surgery in June 2012 and then proceeded to receive six months of gemcitabine. Unfortunately, she noted, his disease returned near the end of that treatment. He was then started on FOLFIRINOX — which is a combination of leucovorin calcium (Folinic Acid), fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride and oxaliplatin, and is still commonly used today, she said..............Future DirectionsFor incurable patients, Binder said, there’s a tremendous amount of interest looking into the continued role of immunotherapy and how it relates to patients with BRCA-related pancreatic cancer. She noted that several studies are looking further into PARP inhibitors, or PARP plus immunotherapy and PARP plus other drugs.Moreover, she explained that patients with curable disease should continue to receive platinum-based therapy in the front-line setting.She wrapped up her presentation by returning to the patient she had introduced to the audience earlier. She noted that he first enrolled in a clinical trial assessing Rubraca (rucaparib) in 2014. Now seven years later, she said, he remains on treatment with his metastatic disease.“These are the people we need to figure out,” she concluded. “Why does he have this response? How can we get other people to that level?” """

Investigator-assessed PFS was assessed in prespecified, nested cohorts: BRCA-mutated, homologous recombination deficient (HRD; BRCA mutated or wild-type BRCA/high loss of heterozygosity), and the intent-to-treat (ITT) population.Results: Median PFS for patients in the ITT population with a complete response to most recent platinum-based chemotherapy was 11.1 months in the rucaparib arm (126 patients) versus 5.6 months in the placebo arm (64 patients) (HR, 0.33 [95% CI, 0.23-0.48]), and in patients with a partial response (249 vs. 125), it was 9.0 versus 5.3 months (HR, 0.38 [0.30-0.49]). In subgroups of the ITT population based on baseline disease, median PFS was 8.2 versus 5.3 months (HR, 0.40 [0.28-0.57]) in patients with measurable disease (141 rucaparib vs. 66 placebo), 10.4 versus 4.5 months (HR, 0.31 [0.20-0.48]) in those with nonmeasurable but evaluable disease (104 vs. 56), and 14.1 versus 7.3 months (HR, 0.35 [0.24-0.51]) in those with no residual disease (130 vs. 67). Across subgroups, significantly longer median PFS was observed with rucaparib versus placebo in the BRCA-mutated and HRD cohorts. Objective responses were reported in patients with measurable disease and in patients with nonmeasurable but evaluable baseline disease. Safety was consistent across subgroups.Conclusion: Rucaparib maintenance treatment provided clinically meaningful efficacy benefits across subgroups based on response to last platinum-based chemotherapy or baseline disease.Keywords: clinical trials; gynecological oncology; medical oncology; target therapy; women's cancer."

Mahaffey selling more shares. test new 52 week low soon
"The timelines outlined in the press release yesterday reassures the short sellers that they have absolutely nothing to worry about until mid to late 2022 (if then ""potentially"", so keep shorting this puppy to ribbons. This dude is not the sharpest tool in the shed, is he..lol"
"SO , what else is new, crushed as expected. NOT to worry, ceo Mahaffy is fine and recovering at home surrounded by mountain of cash shareholders have sent him via salary, perks, atm's, and stock options. SHorty loves the man, very dependable."
$7.50 by October 15 ATM stop selling - CLVS should be moving.
"Took my decimated portfolio to Auph at $11-12 just over a month ago. Now sitting at over $20. Moral of the story, stop complaining about something you can’t change. And go make up your losses elsewhere. Learn the hard way, don’t invest with a convicted criminal. Logic says bad idea. Mahaffy = criminal"
"I have a new saying now. What the Pat just happened? haha! Still bullish on CLVS. Its difficult to find others to agree when we are at the bottom but I still see value in Rubraca and I still see potential for shareholders with FAP-2286. Unfortunately, we have a cashflow problem that PM is not handling very well. I was quite surprised that he executed on 75M of the 200M at these prices. I thought for sure he was smart enough to use those shares wisely and return some value to shareholders before further dillution. On the good side of things, he won't have too many more opportunities after he finishes this offering with the 125M balance he wants to raise. he will be out of shares."
the bulls provide a nice argument with the pipeline (FAP) while the continued promotion of the Athena trial seems promising but the fact remains this is all contingent with time and patience......that is the dilemna longs face unfortunately ~~~~~~~~ now my opinion is we are on the verge of a strong move for the biotech index IBB and XBI so i will eek out some bullishness for weary clovis investors.......now please shut up if you disagree with me.....Oh hi Chevy!! lol
