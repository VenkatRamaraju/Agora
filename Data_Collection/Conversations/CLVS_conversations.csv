"When one looks at the share price of this over 5 years, careful analysis reveals CLVS is truly a piece of chitte."
Maybe best in class but where it counts is worst in stock price and ceo.
is this a rumor you tell me: Betaville website in UK last night reported that BMY is now looking at Clovis CLVS as a potential takeover target.
"Any buyer already knows the potential of the pending Phase 3 trials, there’s enough info/comparables to assign a value to Rubraca. Pat is not doing himself any favors waiting to do a deal. His ability to raise $$ is diminishing, case in point dilution at $4.5. He is literally painted into a corner!"

Within the TME, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) demonstrate as one of the most critical stromal cells that regulate tumor cell growth, progression, immunosuppression, and metastasis. CAFs are identified by various biomarkers that are expressed on their surfaces, such as fibroblast activation protein (FAP), which could be utilized as a useful target for diagnostic imaging and treatment. One of the advantages of targeting FAP-expressing CAFs is the absence of FAP expression in quiescent fibroblasts, leading to a controlled targetability of diagnostic and therapeutic compounds to the malignant tumor stromal area using radiolabeled FAP-based ligands. FAP-based radiopharmaceuticals have been investigated strenuously for the visualization of malignancies and delivery of theranostic radiopharmaceuticals to the TME. This review provides an overview of the state of the art in TME compositions, particularly CAFs and FAP, and their roles in cancer biology. Moreover, relevant reports on radiolabeled FAP inhibitors until the year 2021 are highlighted-as well as the current limitations, challenges, and requirements for those radiolabeled FAP inhibitors in clinical translation.Keywords: cancer-associated fibroblast; fibroblast activation protein; fibroblast activation protein inhibitor; nuclear imaging; radiotherapy; tumor microenvironment."

While sequencing of tumor tissue is considered the standard for identifying patients with BRCA alterations (BRCA+), plasma profiling may provide a minimally invasive option to select patients for rucaparib treatment. Here, we report clinical efficacy in BRCA+ mCRPC patients identified through central plasma, central tissue, or local genomic testing and enrolled in TRITON2.Experimental design: Patients had progressed after next-generation androgen receptor-directed and taxane-based therapies for mCRPC and had BRCA alterations identified by central sequencing of plasma and/or tissue samples or local genomic testing. Concordance of plasma/tissue BRCA status and objective response rate and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates were summarized.Results: TRITON2 enrolled 115 BRCA+ patients identified by central plasma (n = 34), central tissue (n = 37), or local (n = 44) testing. Plasma/tissue concordance was determined in 38 patients with paired samples and was 47% in 19 patients with a somatic BRCA alteration. No statistically significant differences were observed between objective and PSA response rates to rucaparib across the three assay groups. Patients unable to provide tissue samples and tested solely by plasma assay responded at rates no different to patients identified as BRCA+ by tissue testing.Conclusion: Plasma, tissue, and local testing of mCRPC patients can be used to identify men with BRCA+ mCRPC who can benefit from treatment with the PARP inhibitor rucaparib.Copyright 2021, American Association for Cancer Research."
hello . same story. I don't see anything good in next earnings. wait for next data read in 2H22
Pfizer buyout this weekend. 1 for 1 stock swap. $4.35 for $43.5.
"For much of 2021, Apple (AAPL) , Amazon (AMZN) , Microsoft (MSFT) and a few other big-cap technology names drove the indices to a series of new highs. The FATMAAN names gave the market the appearance of great strength, but under the surface thousands of stocks struggled and made little progress.The business media largely ignore things such as breadth. They continually focus on the indices and celebrate how wonderful the market acts, although the gulf of performance between a few stocks and the majority is extremely wide.One of the difficulties of this two-tiered action is that it creates overbought conditions for the indices, although most stocks aren't even close to being extended. Traders constantly wonder if secondary stocks can perform well while the indices undergo a correction. We are going to find out the answer to that question here on Friday.Both Amazon and Apple posted relatively poor reports Thursday night. They were not the typical blow-outs that kept them consistently running higher. The Nasdaq 100 is indicated down about 1% in the early going.The big question at this point is whether some of the money that has been driving the FATMAAN stocks will now rotate into small-caps and secondary names.The conditions for such a rotation are nearly perfect. Positive seasonality that is particularly good for small-caps is just starting, the Russell 2000 has been in a trading range for most of the years and is set up well for a breakout, and many small-caps have attractive valuations and stories.Conditions could not be better for a rotation from the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 and into the Russell 2000. Whether it happens, we will have to wait and see. I'll be watching the price action carefully and will stay focused on stock picking.Source: Rev Shark ~ Real Money"
"Now that my money is again invested in Clovis for the 3rd time in 3 years, was anyone aware that the former Pfizer Vice President of Oncology Global Medical Affairs was appointed to the board in July? This is a HUGE catalyst as Pfizer is looking to grow their Oncology Portfolio and with their investment in BioNtech BNTX as the leading Covid 19 vaccine and poised to deliver 4 Billion doses in 2022. The free cash flow and huge profits will likely allow them to invest and buy new companies very easily. Any thoughts on this?"
"Report: Fibroblast activation protein inhibitor radiotracers are superior to 18F-F-FDG for tumor detection due to better uptake and background-to-tumor ratio. 18F-F-FDG has been the gold standard for tumor detection but is being supplanted by novel FAPI tracers. Superior tumor uptake of FAPI's also implies better radioligand based cancer treatments.

The aim of this systematic review is to perform an updated evidence-based summary about the comparison of these PET radiotracers in oncology to better address further research in this setting. Studies or subsets of studies comparing radiolabeled FAPI and [18F]F-FDG as PET radiotracers in oncology were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review. A systematic literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane library databases was performed until August 2021. Literature data about the comparison of [18F]F-FDG and radiolabeled FAPI are rapidly increasing. Overall, taking into account radiotracer uptake and tumor-to-background uptake ratio, compared to [18F]F-FDG PET, an equal or higher detection of primary tumors and/or metastatic lesions was usually demonstrated by using radiolabeled FAPI PET. In particular, the cancer entities with better detection rate of tumor lesions by using radiolabeled FAPI PET, compared to [18F]F-FDG PET, were gastrointestinal tumors, liver tumors, breast cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Further comparison studies are needed to better evaluate the best field of application of radiolabeled FAPI PET.Keywords: FAPI; FDG; PET; cancer; fibroblast activation protein; fluorodeoxyglucose; imaging; oncology; positron emission tomography; systematic review."
"10/22 Cancer Network: key opinion leader Dr. Oliver Sartor, Medical Director of Tulane Cancer Center, on the use of Rucaparib for treatment of prostate cancer""Rucaparib for Prostate CancerOctober 22, 2021A. Oliver Sartor, MDOliver Sartor, MD, discusses the use of rucaparib in treating metastatic prostate cancer.CN_Prostate_OncView_Seg05_RucaparibEP. 5: Rucaparib for Prostate CancerEP. 6: Advances in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate CancerMatthew Fowler: Focusing again on rucaparib, could you describe the administration and dosing of this drug?Oliver Sartor, MD: We typically dose it 2 times per day in accordance with the FDA. We’re going to be monitoring it closely for the GI [gastrointestinal] adverse effects, which can be problematic for some patients. It can be associated with nausea and fatigue, and you can have the myelosuppression-type aspects that I’ve noted—particularly anemia, a little thrombocytopenia, a tad of neutropenia. Nevertheless, those parameters must be followed. Then for olaparib, we follow the FDA approval, the 300 mg twice a day, and we monitor these patients carefully. I may have to modulate the dosing, and I may even have to hold dosing if we have problems with anemia, which is probably the No. 1 issue. Then we can reinstitute at the same dose or a lower dose.If you have a good responding patient, then what you can do is create even a little lower dosing and potentially have good activity. I have a guy right now on 300 mg 1 time per day, and he’s having a great response. He had some significant anemia when he came into it, and he had a PALB2 rather than a BRCA. He’s having a very robust response but just can’t tolerate the 300 mg twice-daily dosing; we had to dose reduce him for anemia.Matthew Fowler: With PARP inhibitor therapy, what are some of the more common adverse events that you typically see?Oliver Sartor, MD: I mentioned anemia. That’s the No. 1 issue. Then we have to worry about fatigue, and GI adverse effects. Each of these is potentially problematic; all need to be monitored. Then we can take appropriate steps if needed in an effort to create the best quality of life for that individual patient.Matthew Fowler: To expand on those steps, how do you mitigate or manage some of these events? When might dose adjustments be necessary?Oliver Sartor, MD: The most common thing that I’ve had to dose adjust for has been anemia; you’re monitoring the CBC [complete blood count]. By the way, anemia is present in virtually all patients with metastatic CRPC [castration-resistant prostate cancer], so not everybody is going to be affected to the same degree. Yesterday I saw a patient with congestive heart failure. For him, a little anemia is a significant impact on quality of life, whereas I may have another guy who’s 51 years old and fit, and that individual may be able to tolerate much more of an anemia.It’s not just the number. Remember, you’re treating the patient. The typical way I manage anemia is for either a dose pause or reduction, depending on how significant it is. Then I sometimes use transfusion and continue the dosing. It’s rare, but I’ve done it. I had a relatively older gentleman who comes to mind. He was having a very nice response to the PARP, and if I tried to reduce his dose, his disease would start taking off. I had to give him red blood cell transfusions to keep his dose at the proper level to give him the best response. Everything has to be individualized.In terms of fatigue, sometimes I’ll use something like methylphenidate, which can be used to alleviate fatigue. That’s 1 thing we can do. I try to make sure that people are getting good sleep at night if feasible. Regarding GI adverse effects, we’re using antinausea-type medications to control that on occasion. It’s rare for patients to have a real problem with adverse events. But in almost all patients, we can work out something that’s a happy medium to be able to get them the dose they need, particularly if they’re responding. If they’re responding nicely, we’re going to work hard to get the right dose for that patient."

"I'm back all you Sicko's including myself. Thanks to you all I made a bundle in February, now is the time while my portfolio has been in Oil mostly for the past 7 months to torture you nuts on this board. Is it now Clovis time again? I think so and here is my pitch. Now that BMY will be getting close to 1.5 Billion for the sale of Acceleron to Merck by way of their Celgene acquisition and still getting royalties in the future, could they use that money and perhaps another few billion to buy our baby? Yes our baby as I'm back in as of 10am this morning. I think a monster quarter may be here on Nov 3rd as the previous was a little light etc. How do you say Clovites?"
"BMY, PFE, NVS are just a few who are very interested in CLVS. Problem is there is simply no way to peg a value to CLVS without the P1 FAP-2286 data. Pat ain't selling on the cheap AND big pharma isn't paying the premium necessary to buy CLVS so we will wait. As someone mentioned previously, check out the bio on the lead investigator for the P1 trial. pretty impressive resume for such a young guy."
Clovis is working to expand the target population for Rubraca with top line data from a Phase 3 study to treat first-line maintenance ovarian cancer monotherapy out sometime in the second half of this year. Clovis has a market cap just north of $600 million and ended FY2020 with approximately $240 million in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet. The firm would make a logical bite-size acquisition for anyone that wanted to expand their footprint in oncology.
"Short % of Float (Oct 15, 2021) 21.96%"
"Lots of negative noise around here, all day, all the time from the usual suspects. They obviously have an agenda, everyone does who posts here, but they never, ever disclose what their position is. Management decided to move all in with our radio ligand program, they clearly signaled this when they cut the sales force by 50%. Yet peeps come on this board and complain about lack of Rubraca revenue growth, well duh, what did you think would happen? People complain about dilution, act shocked when it happens but where do you think the cash comes from to pay for this stuff? Where are we today? Cash will not be problem through 2022 and we will see the FAP-2286 P1 data before we will need more. Positive results will most certainly juice the share price and it will either pave theway to a buyout or allow us to raise cash at a much higher share price. A positive trial result gives management options but selling the company is the 1st, 2nd & 3rd option. We don't have the balance sheetnecessary to fully leverage a positive result and moving this through PII and PIII trials in all the potential cancers."
