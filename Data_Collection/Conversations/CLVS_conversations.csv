2 of the best decisions I ever made investing wise was 1. Selling Clvs after 2 years of holding through pain and depression and 2. Taking what I had left and buying AUPH at $12. For those in the doldrums...it’s possible to rescue yourself.
"I am here to warn others before they add or put $$ into this scam stock.. If you take off your rose colored glasses, you will see the price and market cap only decline. Ask yourself why? Don’t listen to standard jibberish about needing more money for trials. CLVS is a commercial stage bio and failing at it because revenues are declining and losing market share. Cash flow is negative. Lucitanib development has spent over half a billion and it’s a dud. Management failures at each chapter of its existence."
"Keep selling those atm'S PAT, you are quite the short seller enabler....NO one will miss you, if you will just perish"
Real CEOs who believe in their company step up and buy a lot of stock in the open market. Pat?
just as i said weeks ago expect a strong rally with the IBB/XBI to close out the year while oversold conditions may prolong the rally; so will the cash investors hold (stimulus and sign on bonuses) and the cash millennials hold (inheritence).....THEN we have the hedgefunds that will go long oversold biotech ~~~ this is all good for clovis.......go go go
the XBI and IBB are just dusting their heels ~~~ expect a huge year-end rally that often times extends itself into the new year.....with clovis ditto ditto ditto.....enjoy the ride!!
how low it can go before next data read? gosh....Pat better have some news
Only time will prove if there is any benefit from CLVSCLOVIS ONCOLOGY INC CLVS: NASDAQ ATM is out of stocks 
Often CLVS follows PBYI within a day or two delay. That one is up 6+% on a bad day like today. Read into it what you will !
"Position yourself for a Rally ~~ From Trading Nation:Traders debate whether biotech is a buy after bounceBiotechnology stocks could be headed for an even bigger bounce.The iShares Biotechnology ETF (IBB) edged lower Friday after catching some momentary reprieve in Thursday’s trading session as the recent sell-off in speculative trades slowed.There’s likely more upside in store, at least according to the ETF’s technical layout, Miller Tabak’s Matt Maley told CNBC’s “Trading Nation” on Thursday.“When you see big downdrafts like we’ve just seen, that’s an opportunity where you can add to those positions,” the firm’s chief market strategist said.The IBB’s relative strength index, a key momentum gauge, recently hit its most oversold level since 2018, which has only happened a handful of times in the last several years, Maley said.“Each time, that’s resulted in a huge bounce in the group, anywhere from 18%-40%,” Maley said. “I think this is a great entry point. Even if you’re just a short-term trader, this is something that should allow you to get a nice rally into the end of the year.”A similar momentum buildup is happening in shares of Moderna, which have lost nearly 30% in value over the last two weeks amid Merck’s antiviral Covid pill news and the broader growth sell-off, Maley said.“Its RSI chart is down to a level that it’s only been down three other times in the last year,” he said.“All three of those times, the thing has rallied anywhere from 28%-60% over the next several months,” Maley said. “I think this is a great entry point for long-term investors and even short-term ones who like to be a little bit more on the active trading side of things.”Not only has the IBB outperformed the S&P 500 since its inception in 2001 — up more than 361% versus the S&P’s roughly 226% gain — but it could continue to do so, BK Asset Management’s Boris Schlossberg said in the same interview.“Life sciences just generally as a sector is going to be one of the key sectors of the 21st century,” said Schlossberg, who is managing director of FX strategy at his firm.“This is one of those types of sectors that you simply cannot ignore. It’s going to be a core holding for any investor,” he said. “Whatever sell-offs we have, whatever dips we have in this sector are very much temporary. You’ve got to just buy the dip here all the way through.”"
We are due for one of those random spikes to $7-8 lasting 3-4 days any day now.
"Hopefully the ATM is shut down and we can go into 2022 without the overhang of more dilution. Plenty ofnews for Rubraca and of course FAP-2286 next year. We'll likely stay below $5 for the remainder of the yearbut that's OK, I'm waiting for the data. We've been reading these stories for a few years now that CLVS might be a target for big pharma, recent institutional buying might suggest they are thinking 2022 might be the time for that to happen."
"Seems as though Yahoo didn't like the title of my upcoming book: ""Failure By Any Other Name: the Phenomenon of Mahaffy Malfeasance"". It should be available on Amazon in Q1 2022."
Wheres Roberto? Keith?
"Love the people saying for years Institutions want all the shares cheap. Ok it's down 98% has 500mm market, cap shares are pretty cheap. It's a grain of sand in most of their funds if they wanted to own shares. Why would they for that very reason a small position in their portfolio becomes a majority stake in CLVS."
They PR’d a supply agreement for a compound being used in phase 1. What a joke.. the joke is on retail for thinking this is “something”.
Blockbuster news!
I am declaring October 27th the end of 180 days of suffering. Thou shall see the light!
go to the auph board. everyone excited about a bid north of 40. and this anchor??? I bet auph has a discovery group. clvs bought a toy and is playing big pharma wannabe but failed.
"Sometimes you have to ask yourself, is it better to get something in return or nothing. Once stock selling is completely finished, how does Ginger finance the company? Relying on Fap which is a year and half out is a big risk."
News is BMY looking to buyout Clvs?GM!
The realistic offer for this company would be something that contains a CVR attachment with offer of $12-15 . No reason to pay more for this company as it sits and it’s runway about to end .
"10/12 Pharm Times: KOL's Dr. Morris and Dr. Shah on Rucaparib in ovarian cancer pts. Rucaparib testing in platinum-refractory ovarian cancer patients differentiates it from other PARPi. Preliminary results demonstrate efficacy in a subset of platinum-resistant OC patients:""Patient Eligibility for the Use of PARP Inhibitors in Ovarian CancerOctober 12, 2021sults show Ruca efficacy in PR patients but extrapolation to larger PR patient population Bhavesh Shah, RPh, BCOP; and Thomasina Morris, RPh, MHA, BCOP, detail what makes a patient eligible to receive PARP inhibitors as second-line maintenance for the management of ovarian cancer.Thomasina Morris, RPh, MHA, BCOP: Most of the data out there have been for platinum-sensitive. With the platinum sensitivity, it also shows that they have a better progression-free survival with a PARP inhibitor if they are BRCA mutated. Platinum resistance or refractory is a lot harder; in essence, they’re going to recur much quicker. You want to get them to a point where you can say they’re stable. You don’t want to switch them to something if it’s working; if you feel like you put them on another treatment and you haven’t exhausted what you’re already giving them, where are you truly giving them the benefit? The studies aren’t looking at platinum-refractory currently. They probably have small cohorts in the study, or supplemental material that says we looked at it, but the numbers are small. I think when we look at platinum-refractory, we don’t really think about PARP inhibitors as an option right now.However, there’s an ARIEL4 study with rucaparib that also talks about giving platinum in platinum-sensitive patients, and paclitaxel in platinum-resistant patients, and doing a comparative in there. It’s coming, but it’s just not as fast as what we have seen with the platinum sensitivity. It’s interesting because when you talk about biomarkers, when patients with breast cancer are treated, they go through a number of biomarkers now, more so than they ever did in the past; everybody else is catching up. They’re trying to do as much as breast does, but breast has been doing it for a long time. With ovarian cancer, the GYN [gynecologist] oncologist is excited, saying, “We get to do more than just a CA 125 [cancer antigen 125].” They’re just thrilled that they can now look and talk to these patients and say, “I can give you more options at the time of diagnosis.” I think that’s what’s so important.Bhavesh Shah, RPh, BCOP: I totally agree. There is subset analysis with a small number of patients, not recommending this, but in the Rubraca [rucaparib] trial, there was a small subset of platinum-refractory patients who were included. It’s hard to extrapolate the benefit in the general platinum-refractory patient population; based on the mechanism, it may not be as active as patients who are platinum-sensitive."""

The aim of this systematic review is to perform an updated evidence-based summary about the comparison of these PET radiotracers in oncology to better address further research in this setting. Studies or subsets of studies comparing radiolabeled FAPI and [18F]F-FDG as PET radiotracers in oncology were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review. A systematic literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane library databases was performed until August 2021. Literature data about the comparison of [18F]F-FDG and radiolabeled FAPI are rapidly increasing. Overall, taking into account radiotracer uptake and tumor-to-background uptake ratio, compared to [18F]F-FDG PET, an equal or higher detection of primary tumors and/or metastatic lesions was usually demonstrated by using radiolabeled FAPI PET. In particular, the cancer entities with better detection rate of tumor lesions by using radiolabeled FAPI PET, compared to [18F]F-FDG PET, were gastrointestinal tumors, liver tumors, breast cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Further comparison studies are needed to better evaluate the best field of application of radiolabeled FAPI PET.Keywords: FAPI; FDG; PET; cancer; fibroblast activation protein; fluorodeoxyglucose; imaging; oncology; positron emission tomography; systematic review."

"(!) Report out: Updated review published on ATHENA trial testing Rucaparib as monotherapy (ATHENA-MONO) vs Ruca+ Nivo combo (ATHENA-COMBO) as frontline maintenance treatment in ovarian cancer pts. ATHENA-MONO primary results are expected in 1Q'22 while ATHENA-COMBO are expected to mature ""at a later date""! Bottom line IMO: combo of Ruca+Nivo is working successfully and demonstrating improved efficacy vs Ruca alone:Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2021 Sep 30;ijgc-2021-002933. doi: 10.1136/ijgc-2021-002933. Online ahead of print.ATHENA (GOG-3020/ENGOT-ov45): a randomized, phase III trial to evaluate rucaparib as monotherapy (ATHENA-MONO) and rucaparib in combination with nivolumab (ATHENA-COMBO) as maintenance treatment following frontline platinum-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancerBradley J Monk 1, Robert L Coleman 2, Keiichi Fujiwara 3, Michelle K Wilson 4, Amit M Oza 5, Ana Oaknin 6, David M O'Malley 7, Domenica Lorusso 8, Shannon N Westin 9, Tamar Safra 10, Thomas J Herzog 11, Frederik Marmé 12, Ramez N Eskander 13, Kevin K Lin 14, Danny Shih 15, Sandra Goble 16, Nikolay Grechko 17, Stephanie Hume 18, Lara Maloney 18, Iain A McNeish 19, Rebecca S Kristeleit 20PMID: 34593565 DOI: 10.1136/ijgc-2021-002933Full text linksCiteAbstractBackground: The optimal treatment strategy for women with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer has yet to be determined. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have demonstrated substantial improvement in progression-free survival as monotherapy maintenance treatment in the frontline setting versus active surveillance. Furthermore, preclinical and early clinical studies have shown that PARP inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors have synergistic antitumor activity and may provide an additional therapeutic option for patients in this population.Primary objectives: In women with newly diagnosed ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer, we wish to assess the efficacy of frontline maintenance treatment with the PARP inhibitor rucaparib versus placebo following response to platinum-based chemotherapy (ATHENA-MONO), and to assess the combination of rucaparib plus nivolumab (a programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1)-blocking monoclonal antibody) versus rucaparib alone (ATHENA-COMBO).Study hypothesis: (1) Maintenance therapy with rucaparib monotherapy may extend progression-free survival following standard treatment for ovarian cancer in the frontline setting. (2) The combination of nivolumab plus rucaparib may extend progression-free survival following standard treatment for ovarian cancer in the frontline setting compared with rucaparib alone.Trial design: ATHENA is an international, randomized, double-blind, phase III trial consisting of two independent comparisons (ATHENA-MONO and ATHENA-COMBO) in patients with newly diagnosed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. Patients are randomized 4:4:1:1 to the following: oral rucaparib+ intravenous nivolumab (arm A); oral rucaparib + intravenous placebo (arm B); oral placebo+ intravenous nivolumab (arm C); and oral placebo + intravenous placebo (arm D). The starting dose of rucaparib is 600 mg orally twice a day and nivolumab 480 mg intravenously every 4 weeks. ATHENA-MONO compares arm B with arm D to evaluate rucaparib monotherapy versus placebo, and ATHENA-COMBO evaluates arm A versus arm B to investigate the effects of rucaparib and nivolumab in combination versus rucaparib monotherapy. ATHENA-MONO and ATHENA-COMBO share a common treatment arm (arm B) but each comparison is independently powered.Major inclusion/exclusion criteria: Patients ≥18 years of age with newly diagnosed advanced, high-grade epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer who have achieved a response after completion of cytoreductive surgery and initial platinum-based chemotherapy are enrolled. No other prior treatment for ovarian cancer, other than the frontline platinum regimen, is permitted.Primary endpoint: The primary endpoint is investigator-assessed progression-free survival by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1.Sample size: Approximately 1000 patients have been enrolled and randomized.Estimated dates for completing accrual and presenting results: The trial completed accrual in 2020. While dependent on event rates, primary results of ATHENA-MONO are anticipated in early 2022 and results of ATHENA-COMBO are anticipated to mature at a later date.Trial registration: This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03522246).Keywords: BRCA1 protein; BRCA2 protein; homologous recombination; ovarian neoplasms."

FAP has been linked to worse prognosis and therapy resistance in several cancers. We hypothesised that FAP might have a prognostic 3biomarker potential to stratify patients with high-grade (HG) T1 non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). We selected 30 patients with HG T1 NMIBC that progressed to ≥T2 disease which were pair-matched based on CUETO progression score variables with 90 patients that did not progress. After revision a final cohort of 86 patients was retained. Slides were stained for FAP, the luminal marker GATA3 and the basal marker CK5. All HG T1 tumour regions of interest (ROIs) within each patient were annotated, analysed and scored using image analysis software. FAP expression in HG T1 ROIs was significantly higher in progressors vs. non-progressors and was prognostic for recurrence-free survival, progression-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival. FAP expression in HG T1 ROIs remained strongly prognostic for these outcomes in a bivariable model corrected for adequate BCG per FDA definition. Expression of GATA3 and CK5 did not differ between progressors vs. non-progressors, and were not prognostic for these outcomes. FAP might serve as an easily applicable prognostic biomarker to risk-stratify patients with HG T1 NMIBC if these results are prospectively validated in a larger series."

"For much of 2021, Apple (AAPL) , Amazon (AMZN) , Microsoft (MSFT) and a few other big-cap technology names drove the indices to a series of new highs. The FATMAAN names gave the market the appearance of great strength, but under the surface thousands of stocks struggled and made little progress.The business media largely ignore things such as breadth. They continually focus on the indices and celebrate how wonderful the market acts, although the gulf of performance between a few stocks and the majority is extremely wide.One of the difficulties of this two-tiered action is that it creates overbought conditions for the indices, although most stocks aren't even close to being extended. Traders constantly wonder if secondary stocks can perform well while the indices undergo a correction. We are going to find out the answer to that question here on Friday.Both Amazon and Apple posted relatively poor reports Thursday night. They were not the typical blow-outs that kept them consistently running higher. The Nasdaq 100 is indicated down about 1% in the early going.The big question at this point is whether some of the money that has been driving the FATMAAN stocks will now rotate into small-caps and secondary names.The conditions for such a rotation are nearly perfect. Positive seasonality that is particularly good for small-caps is just starting, the Russell 2000 has been in a trading range for most of the years and is set up well for a breakout, and many small-caps have attractive valuations and stories.Conditions could not be better for a rotation from the Nasdaq and Nasdaq 100 and into the Russell 2000. Whether it happens, we will have to wait and see. I'll be watching the price action carefully and will stay focused on stock picking.Source: Rev Shark ~ Real Money"

While sequencing of tumor tissue is considered the standard for identifying patients with BRCA alterations (BRCA+), plasma profiling may provide a minimally invasive option to select patients for rucaparib treatment. Here, we report clinical efficacy in BRCA+ mCRPC patients identified through central plasma, central tissue, or local genomic testing and enrolled in TRITON2.Experimental design: Patients had progressed after next-generation androgen receptor-directed and taxane-based therapies for mCRPC and had BRCA alterations identified by central sequencing of plasma and/or tissue samples or local genomic testing. Concordance of plasma/tissue BRCA status and objective response rate and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates were summarized.Results: TRITON2 enrolled 115 BRCA+ patients identified by central plasma (n = 34), central tissue (n = 37), or local (n = 44) testing. Plasma/tissue concordance was determined in 38 patients with paired samples and was 47% in 19 patients with a somatic BRCA alteration. No statistically significant differences were observed between objective and PSA response rates to rucaparib across the three assay groups. Patients unable to provide tissue samples and tested solely by plasma assay responded at rates no different to patients identified as BRCA+ by tissue testing.Conclusion: Plasma, tissue, and local testing of mCRPC patients can be used to identify men with BRCA+ mCRPC who can benefit from treatment with the PARP inhibitor rucaparib.Copyright 2021, American Association for Cancer Research."

"9/9 Targeted Onc: Oncologist explains rationale for using Rucaparib over other PARPi as maintenance therapy:""Considerations for Selecting PARP Inhibitor Maintenance TherapySeptember 9, 2021Dr Ramez Eskander shares his insights on considerations for selecting appropriate PARP inhibitor therapy for patients based on molecular testing and other factors.Ramez Eskander, MD: With the evolution of PARP inhibitors as a treatment strategy in the ovarian cancer space, we’ve realized that we’ve made significant gains and have various treatment options in the setting, and it’s important to note that this patient in this clinical scenario was counseled and was treated with maintenance rucaparib in the platinum-sensitive response. Again, this patient had received maintenance bevacizumab monotherapy in the front line after initial completion of chemotherapy. It is a patient who is PARP inhibitor naïve specifically. And that’s important to remember. We know the data regarding rucaparib, the ARIEL3 clinical trial supporting the efficacy, the safety, and the tolerability of this drug, which was again given until disease progression or unacceptable adverse events. There was also an interesting abstract that was presented that compared real-world data among PARP inhibitors. There are other options for PARP maintenance in the platinum-sensitive setting in a patient who is PARP naïve. And what we saw was that rucaparib and olaparib appeared to be better tolerated than niraparib when it came to dose interruptions or dose reductions. We don’t have any head-to-head data the way that we want it, but they are data that help us contextualize potentially the treatment-related tolerability or adverse effects that may be experienced on therapy. The other important thing to note is that niraparib has an individualized starting dose, a dose that’s dependent on baseline weight and platelet count. If you have a patient who has struggled with thrombocytopenia, understanding that may guide you away potentially from one PARP inhibitor to consider another PARP inhibitor such as rucaparib for maintenance strategy. Analogously, a patient who has poorly controlled hypertension may not tolerate niraparib as well, and you might want to consider others.There are nuances here when making this decision. We know that there are multiple agents that are approved in this setting, but the patient clinical case may help inform and guide treatment choices. And again, rucaparib is dosed at 600 mg twice a day. You have multiple opportunities for dose reduction to help keep a patient on treatment, which again is the most important component to drive efficacy in this setting. I have used all PARP inhibitors in clinical practice. I’ve used them in the front line as maintenance treatment strategies. I’ve used them in the platinum-sensitive recurrent setting. I’ve used them as treatment monotherapy in the later-line setting previously. It’s important to know, the take-home message here is all of these drugs can be given. They’re given orally. You want to be thoughtful about treatment-related adverse effects, but almost universally patients can stay on treatment as long as they’re benefitting from therapy. And it’s uncommon to have to discontinue treatment because of adverse effects. And I empower you when you’re using these medications to be proactive about adverse-event mitigation strategies, dose reductions and interruptions, with a goal for continuing treatment for as long as possible. And rucaparib can be used in a setting just like this. I have many patients who are treated with rucaparib in a platinum-sensitive maintenance strategy, some with many years of benefit. I have patients treated with rucaparib as a treatment strategy.That pivots nicely into review of the ARIEL4 clinical trial. And ARIEL4 is a study that looked at rucaparib vs chemotherapy in patients with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer who were also found to have a deleterious BRCA mutation. This may not be as relevant in the future. Why? Because now we know that patients who have a BRCA mutation in the front line should be all receiving maintenance PARP in the frontline setting. When they recur, there are no data for PARP rechallenge after prior PARP yet. Those are emerging data and we’re learning more about it. But as it exists right now, it’s limited. But the ARIEL4 clinical trial looked specifically at BRCA-mutated patients, looking at rucaparib vs chemotherapy. patients were randomized to rucaparib 2:1, 600 mg orally twice daily vs physician’s choice chemotherapy. And their progression-free intervals were defined. And what we saw was a benefit when you looked at rucaparib vs chemotherapy. Patients with relapsed BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer who received rucaparib based on the ARIEL4 clinical trial had a significant improvement in progression-free survival vs standard of care chemotherapy. ..."""

Within the TME, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) demonstrate as one of the most critical stromal cells that regulate tumor cell growth, progression, immunosuppression, and metastasis. CAFs are identified by various biomarkers that are expressed on their surfaces, such as fibroblast activation protein (FAP), which could be utilized as a useful target for diagnostic imaging and treatment. One of the advantages of targeting FAP-expressing CAFs is the absence of FAP expression in quiescent fibroblasts, leading to a controlled targetability of diagnostic and therapeutic compounds to the malignant tumor stromal area using radiolabeled FAP-based ligands. FAP-based radiopharmaceuticals have been investigated strenuously for the visualization of malignancies and delivery of theranostic radiopharmaceuticals to the TME. This review provides an overview of the state of the art in TME compositions, particularly CAFs and FAP, and their roles in cancer biology. Moreover, relevant reports on radiolabeled FAP inhibitors until the year 2021 are highlighted-as well as the current limitations, challenges, and requirements for those radiolabeled FAP inhibitors in clinical translation.Keywords: cancer-associated fibroblast; fibroblast activation protein; fibroblast activation protein inhibitor; nuclear imaging; radiotherapy; tumor microenvironment."

Clovis is working to expand the target population for Rubraca with top line data from a Phase 3 study to treat first-line maintenance ovarian cancer monotherapy out sometime in the second half of this year. Clovis has a market cap just north of $600 million and ended FY2020 with approximately $240 million in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet.

I believe that Mr. Mahaffy is a director on the board of Flexion. Look how the shareholders were treated in the recent proposed sale of Flexion to Pacira Bio.We can expect the same treatment should CLVS get an offer.
The company BOD need to step up and address the DISASTER unfolding here. How long can silence and ineptitude endure. How long can receding revenues and a 450 person workforce continue to drain cash reserves? No changes in strategy equals continuous failure.
Lucitanib…Now that's a subject worth talking to Pat about. He won't even mention it anymore. Mahaffy squandered $200M for the rights to that dud. Clovis ran >30 trials with it and all FAILED.

"10/22 Cancer Network: key opinion leader Dr. Oliver Sartor, Medical Director of Tulane Cancer Center, on the use of Rucaparib for treatment of prostate cancer""Rucaparib for Prostate CancerOctober 22, 2021A. Oliver Sartor, MDOliver Sartor, MD, discusses the use of rucaparib in treating metastatic prostate cancer.CN_Prostate_OncView_Seg05_RucaparibEP. 5: Rucaparib for Prostate CancerEP. 6: Advances in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate CancerMatthew Fowler: Focusing again on rucaparib, could you describe the administration and dosing of this drug?Oliver Sartor, MD: We typically dose it 2 times per day in accordance with the FDA. We’re going to be monitoring it closely for the GI [gastrointestinal] adverse effects, which can be problematic for some patients. It can be associated with nausea and fatigue, and you can have the myelosuppression-type aspects that I’ve noted—particularly anemia, a little thrombocytopenia, a tad of neutropenia. Nevertheless, those parameters must be followed. Then for olaparib, we follow the FDA approval, the 300 mg twice a day, and we monitor these patients carefully. I may have to modulate the dosing, and I may even have to hold dosing if we have problems with anemia, which is probably the No. 1 issue. Then we can reinstitute at the same dose or a lower dose.If you have a good responding patient, then what you can do is create even a little lower dosing and potentially have good activity. I have a guy right now on 300 mg 1 time per day, and he’s having a great response. He had some significant anemia when he came into it, and he had a PALB2 rather than a BRCA. He’s having a very robust response but just can’t tolerate the 300 mg twice-daily dosing; we had to dose reduce him for anemia.Matthew Fowler: With PARP inhibitor therapy, what are some of the more common adverse events that you typically see?Oliver Sartor, MD: I mentioned anemia. That’s the No. 1 issue. Then we have to worry about fatigue, and GI adverse effects. Each of these is potentially problematic; all need to be monitored. Then we can take appropriate steps if needed in an effort to create the best quality of life for that individual patient.Matthew Fowler: To expand on those steps, how do you mitigate or manage some of these events? When might dose adjustments be necessary?Oliver Sartor, MD: The most common thing that I’ve had to dose adjust for has been anemia; you’re monitoring the CBC [complete blood count]. By the way, anemia is present in virtually all patients with metastatic CRPC [castration-resistant prostate cancer], so not everybody is going to be affected to the same degree. Yesterday I saw a patient with congestive heart failure. For him, a little anemia is a significant impact on quality of life, whereas I may have another guy who’s 51 years old and fit, and that individual may be able to tolerate much more of an anemia.It’s not just the number. Remember, you’re treating the patient. The typical way I manage anemia is for either a dose pause or reduction, depending on how significant it is. Then I sometimes use transfusion and continue the dosing. It’s rare, but I’ve done it. I had a relatively older gentleman who comes to mind. He was having a very nice response to the PARP, and if I tried to reduce his dose, his disease would start taking off. I had to give him red blood cell transfusions to keep his dose at the proper level to give him the best response. Everything has to be individualized.In terms of fatigue, sometimes I’ll use something like methylphenidate, which can be used to alleviate fatigue. That’s 1 thing we can do. I try to make sure that people are getting good sleep at night if feasible. Regarding GI adverse effects, we’re using antinausea-type medications to control that on occasion. It’s rare for patients to have a real problem with adverse events. But in almost all patients, we can work out something that’s a happy medium to be able to get them the dose they need, particularly if they’re responding. If they’re responding nicely, we’re going to work hard to get the right dose for that patient."

"AJFAH Cancer Conference '21: Rucaparib featured by Dr. Kim Reiss-Binder in her presentation on targeted therapies for pancreatic cancer. Dr. Reiss-Binder described an ""incurable"" pancreatic cancer patient that she first treated in 2014 as part of a clinical trial. Today, 7 years later, the incurable PC patient is still in stable condition on Rucaparib maintenance treatment. Ruca relevant excerpts from a 10/7 synopsis of her presentation:"" ‘Tip of the Iceberg’: More Targeted Therapies for Pancreatic Cancer to ComeOctober 7, 2021Ryan McDonaldThere’s a tremendous amount of interest in immunotherapy drugs given alongside targeted therapies for patients with pancreatic cancer, according to an expert.For the longest time, there were no active therapy options for patients with pancreatic cancer and survival was “horrifyingly” short, according to Dr. Kim A. Reiss Binder.However, that all changed in 2001 and has been steadily improving over the past two decades.Binder, an assistant professor of medical oncology at the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania, recently highlighted what’s new in the treatment of pancreatic cancer during the 12th Annual Joining FORCES Against Hereditary Cancer Conference. But before she discussed the newer developments in the treatment of the disease, Binder reviewed the history of platinum-based chemotherapies and how they have improved outcomes. Moreover, she discussed how the development of targeted therapies for the disease is just getting started..........To discuss this point further, she cited a personal experience with a patient in her clinic. The patient, according to Binder, was diagnosed with operable pancreatic cancer in 2012. He underwent surgery in June 2012 and then proceeded to receive six months of gemcitabine. Unfortunately, she noted, his disease returned near the end of that treatment. He was then started on FOLFIRINOX — which is a combination of leucovorin calcium (Folinic Acid), fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride and oxaliplatin, and is still commonly used today, she said..............Future DirectionsFor incurable patients, Binder said, there’s a tremendous amount of interest looking into the continued role of immunotherapy and how it relates to patients with BRCA-related pancreatic cancer. She noted that several studies are looking further into PARP inhibitors, or PARP plus immunotherapy and PARP plus other drugs.Moreover, she explained that patients with curable disease should continue to receive platinum-based therapy in the front-line setting.She wrapped up her presentation by returning to the patient she had introduced to the audience earlier. She noted that he first enrolled in a clinical trial assessing Rubraca (rucaparib) in 2014. Now seven years later, she said, he remains on treatment with his metastatic disease.“These are the people we need to figure out,” she concluded. “Why does he have this response? How can we get other people to that level?” """
"Don't be lulled into a false sense of complacency because of a few green days, the stock is still weak given its struggles to move above $5. Mahaffyy is an irresponsible CEO with who has shown years of operational negligence. Declining sales figures, declining market share, a staggeringly bloated workforce of 430+ people, $441 million worth of dilutive debt, $350 million worth of Athena private loan repayments commence next year, continuous ATM dilutions at near all time lows...The CEO has demonstrated extreme negligence in his failed operational execution...The BOD has to act decisively to remove him or push for a sale of the company NOW to return value back to shareholders. The timing for this action is now."
