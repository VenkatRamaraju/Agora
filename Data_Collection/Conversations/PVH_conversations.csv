"Oops, Five Below had a legitimate drop, missed on revs, but beat on earnings."
whats the debt of this company?
"Good time to buy, just like Express yesterday when it was down 8% in earning morning trading."
Future mergers in Textiles could be in the offering.
yessir!
"While the entire US fashion sector rotates up and down from day to day, some such as TPR hitting new 52 week lows almost daily, others which have reported great numbers in the previous quarter such as RL , CPRI and of course PVH are languishing, the European luxury brands continue to reach new all time highs. Interesting dichotomy."
"I think the selloff is way overdone. slight beat on top line, plus they only reduced the guidance by $1 and the stock got cut in half... still PE of 8 using nongap. No rev decrease... share buyback increase. all looking ok fundamentally."
I’ll buy a couple of thousand shares if it dips below 47
Short the stock tomorrow morning.
"Wow, all of the reporting stocks have people fishing for traders who have automatic sell points programmed. The fake drop came through on both PVH and WSM, will check FIVE now."
"There will be a good rally tomorrow and onwards on airplanes $LUV $DAL $AAL $UAL - why because retails up $PVH $LB $GAP- energy up $OXY $APA- cruise up $CCL $NCLH- theaters up $AMC $CNK- transportation up - restaurants up $DRI $CMG - even home builders , hotels and rental cars are up lol... so IMO this is bottom for airlines from this week.. 2 months chart speaks itself and earning reports are priced in too.buy and hold.. GLTA "
"Price target lowered to $41; strong sell signal and bear of the day, deemed as un investable in Mad Money. I like the stock, yet not sure how to read all these bad news and the recent positivity in the market. Plus retail results will start to kick in tomorrow starting with Tapestry, and I really doubt they will be good. Any ideas?"
Anyone buying under $148?
"Too funny that Morgan Stanley cut the price point by three dollars on the day of the earnings call, what to drop the prices for their high wealth clients, well it apparently didn't work too well, better luck next time. We figured out long ago MS that you are probably the second most corrupt financial institute in America, Goldman barely beats you though."
"Some brands seeing triple digital revenue increases, ‘second quarter to date’"
"down $1 now probably something about cautious holiday guidance. ""Competitive"" and ""highly promotional"" are not good words in retail..."
Year ago high price was $154.21. Quality company at a steep discount. Time to buy !
This has got to be a joke. This is so depressing. One stock has destroyed my portfolio in one week.
full year guidance up this should roll
"So this stock and pretty much the entire fashion industry in the USA is now down more than Tesla who has lost all of their Chinese business, we know this for a fact, new car sales are down 90% for the quarter, we also know that gasoline prices will be sub 2 dollars a gallon in a couple of weeks as oil prices have plummeted, this has always had a very negative impact on compact car and hybrid cars in the past, no reason to believe it won't impact EV sales as well. For some reason Wall Street has focused on retail and fashion to tank to multiyear lows while allowing the FANGs and many other darling stocks to only take a slight beating. Is that in preparation for large private equity moves or do they actually know something as a fact rather than pure speculation?"
What is up PM?
This is getting to be an interesting story. Maybe the analysts are too high with estimates but if it guides down to $8-9 in earnings what you have here is a PE of about 9 on reduced earnings. This is one of those cases if a company has excess cash to use it to purchase a few shares. Reducing the float would be great to keep eps at a decent level. I am definitely a buyer at 70 and any lower it becomes a screaming buy. But you need to hold it for a few years and maybe thru a market correction. Issue is no div to speak of but idle cash does not earn much now so the opportunity cost is very low to hold this now.
Solid beat top and bottom. It should pop tomorrow.
"value investing sometimes feels like catching a falling knife. FB at $18, AAPL at 380 presplit, Google at sub 1000 just 9 months ago. Why would one well at current level when pops has been cut in half, when the forward PE is under 7 and trading below book?"
"This is one of the most frustrating stocks there is. Unreal action at 9x this fiscal years earnings, and 8x next year’s earnings.... 25% discount multiple to $RL, $PVH, Prada in HK trading. Different animal in LVMH, but a 70% multiple discount to them too.... just nuts. Staying long and strong until $75+ later this year with Versace integration and synergies"
fanastic earnings.
Appears last week we had a big sell off. Some big holders were selling and flooded the market with shares. With that over we might see some slight steady gains. Noticed up +3 today and expect it to be around 95 by end of June.

"looks like we just have to wait for guidance on earnings. Morningstar, CFRA, CS, Wells all have over 100 PT, mostly over 120 on this. Gotta believe that this will come back."
someone should do a correlation of the earnings performance vs. when the CEO gets on CNBC after the bell
PVH book value $81EPS $8THis will be $easly $60 next year 100% return
I'm excited should be good
"Bought 500 shares at 44, holding for long term. Pvh is too big to suffer with Calvin Klein sales. Especially in Asia!"
"pvh: stock price too low,"
"Big money boys aren't content with making money by merely shorting stocks and dumping the prices, the prices in the retail and fashion sectors have been so contracted that they have had to resort to a new tactic. Dump prices in the morning, buy, run the prices up and dump before lunch, that way they make 7 to 8 dollars on the swing trades. Same manipulation, just a different approach to the game."
Good entry Point
I will be a buyer at $145!
Up $5 per-market due to an upgrade. I dont see that lasting. Maybe its an upgrade to get clients out of the name. We shall see.
$ 125 by early next week. Solid company that was beaten down way too much. Buying opportunity here.
