"Xylem is too ""splintered"" as a company to be cohesive. One brand, out of dozens, has no idea what the others are doing. There is no cohesiveness -- a company of this size should be managed accordingly."

"This stock is up over 60% in 12 months. Not the flashy returns of a well selected crypto or meme stock, but this is solid and backed by the unfortunate megatrends of water crisis management and weather related flooding that seems to be increasing year by year. Many will depend on innovation in this space."
"I don't see a top in sight for Xylem. Great business model, reliable repeat customers, growth in infrastructure spending, growth in monitoring and controls, foreign exchange going in the right direction to add to revenue and earnings, costs have been cut, solid management, good but not crazy dividend, and likely growth in dividend payouts."
"Contrary to the negatively expressed by ""Jim the short"", Xylem is doing very well. Its recent acquisitions are generating excellent returns. Its core businesses are growing fast as the population and need for water solutions is steadily increasing. This is a solid, well managed, company. The management is doing a great job optimizing resources and maximizing opportunities for growth and returns. The stock has been a great investments and will, in my opinion, continue to be for the foreseeable future."
"Following the departure of Andrew Fraher, the marketing department is at a complete loss as to how to proceed. The restructuring hurt the co worse than they realized it could, and it has nearly imploded. What's left -- lots of small companies owned by Xylem that have no cohesiveness, it's like a micro-cap mutual fund with many companies that ""seem"" unrelated without a central theme or centralized control."
"The co. needs a better name: 1) it's hard to pronounce, and 2) they need to define the name on every piece of literature. Shouldn't they be more efficient at moving water than plants?"
This company has been downgraded by numerous analysts. Many have a target between $78 and $80 now.
Does not appear many small investors who typically post on these boards are into XYL. I always look to see if someone has any tidbits of info. I like environmental companies and found this one couple years ago from investing in WTRG (water utility).
I think water will be a big deal in the next decades and this company is a good opportunity to participate.Many people are sleeping on this.
Still a buy. Should have lots of earnings growth in the next 5 years.

The infrastructure bill will include massive investments in drinking water and waste water related spending.
Many cities are spending on new water plants without stopping their leaks. Most water losing leaks can be stopped by replacing leaking flappers or replacing flapper toilets (tanks) with cannister type toilets.
"Xylem used to have a strong presence in the water industry trade magazines. I've noticed that they no longer advertise or even have any articles about their products in successful use around the nation and world. Nothing in Waterword, Water & Waste Digest, Water & Sewer Operator, etc. NOTHING! They are going to slow down without the continuous publicity that used to keep them in the eyes of the buyers of their equipment. They all read those publications, not the internet, to see the interesting articles. I'd not buy their stock after its run up into the 80s. Any future growth will be slowing and is already priced into the stock."
$90 coming
"Jim,I have not bailed on Xylem. In fact, I am expecting excellent earnings for Q4. The company tries to be ""real"" with their forecasts when many other companies are willing to issue forecasts which are pie in the sky. In 2020 the US expansion continues, Europe is doing better, and Asia is getting back on its feet. Thus, there is every reason to hope for a better than expected Q4 result and forecast for 2020."
where do you guys see this company in 5-10 years from now? im a potential investor and I see potential in the water tech market to rise due to global warming... do you guys see this as a long term holding?
"Just took a look at the 3-month chart. Boy, it looks like a disaster with no leveling off or basing, just a continued downward trend. Based on my knowledge of the company it is no surprise."
"Pete, I think this stock is fairly priced now. Analysts average in the low-mid 60s for their targets. This co has ceased to exist in trade media like they used to, esp for their size. No promotion equals low sales. There are other companies in much hotter industries who promote their wares to potential customers. Those would be better investment choices."
