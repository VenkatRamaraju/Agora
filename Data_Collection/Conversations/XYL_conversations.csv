"Looks like Susan bailed, based on the weak outlook for this co, along with all of the analyst downgrades. Their restructuring made the co less efficient than it was before they tinkered with it, and the lack of support to the distributors and reps for their products is ultimately going to affect their bottom line. Those guys can specify other branded products for the projects they are working on."
can anyone give me some guidance on what's a good buy in price?
"Meanwhile, ITT continues to make new 52-week highs -- they were smart to spin off the newly created Xylem a few yrs ago."
"I don't see a top in sight for Xylem. Great business model, reliable repeat customers, growth in infrastructure spending, growth in monitoring and controls, foreign exchange going in the right direction to add to revenue and earnings, costs have been cut, solid management, good but not crazy dividend, and likely growth in dividend payouts."
Buying opportunity
Still a buy. Should have lots of earnings growth in the next 5 years.
Xylem is up 7.55% to 97.96
"Flygt, which was Xylem's prized asset and coined the 600 lb gorilla, used to generate a good percentage of their entire revenue. Now there is no advertising for Flygt, after cultivating it for decades, and all of the publicity they had has disappeared. Not a good sign for things to come."
Is there anything of substance in the conversation rooms or is it just stupid website advertisements ???
XYL is down 4.94% to $68.73
XYL reached an all time high at 88.61
"Heading back to $60, company is very fragmented unable to focus on specific products and issues."
XYL is down 4.90% to 79.94
"With the expected disaster of another ER that will ""miss projections"", I'd suggest selling now while you can still pocket $74.65. After Thurday it'll be too late."
Why is volume so light ...?
We shouldn't be selling this either. Water is more important now than ever! Buy in because these guys will pop hardest!
XYL reached a 52 Week low at 72.14
Their distributors have been complaining about the lack of support they now receive from Xylem and are not happy with the Co.
"It is not clear why XYL stock price is bobbing around, other than perhaps low volume during the summer months. Does anyone have an explanation?"
Great acquisition - accretive in one year - stock will go well over $50 and good prospects going forward

XYL is up 4.96% to 73.50
"Seems that people have been promoted to levels beyond their means and effectiveness. It's the Peter Principle, well documented in a book by the same name. This is a negative situation, employees should remain in positions at which they are proficient, not the next position up."
XYL reached a 52 Week low at $61.92
"Aside from this being a wretched October for the market, is there an uncomplicated explanation for the price decline from 81 to 69? Also wondering if Susan is still as bullish or if something significant has changed."
"The bottom is dropping out on this stock. People are realizing it's not worth what they once thought, with the non-productive restructurings and slashing of the entire marketing budget. That is a recipe for disaster. This company, in an industry with lots of publications and journals, needs to be seen by potential customers, or -- out of sight, out of mind. The new cost cutters are penny wise and dollar foolish."
Just started my position at $96 dont know if i shoukd of gotten more shares to start with. WATCHING
Xylem reached an all time high at 92.29
Many cities are spending on new water plants without stopping their leaks. Most water losing leaks can be stopped by replacing leaking flappers or replacing flapper toilets (tanks) with cannister type toilets.
This will bea quiet winner over next year
Really solid performance in 2018 and outstanding outlook for 2019. The price will start going up when the analysts reveal their take on the Earning Call that was just completed.
$XYL will present a corporate overview. Here is the link for more info http://crweworld.com/article/news-provided-by-business-wire/303004/xylem-inc-to-present-at-the-electrical-products-group-2018-annual-spring-conference
I'm hearing multiple tribunals in Europe from ex employees (senior staff). This will hurt sales for sure......be warned!
Does anyone follow this stock? I took a position today. Company should do very well going forward.
"""Ballast water treatment systems worth $117.55 Billion by 2025"" . Does anyone know XYL's involvement with ocean going ships?"
XYL is up 7.13% to 64.03

The current dip presents a buying opportunity. Expecting another great quarter from Xylem for the reasons expressed previously.

Xylem is up 8.26% to 72.90
XYL is down 6.85% to 66.90

Why the drop in price prior to earnings? All news is very positive looking forward.
XYL reached an all time high at 87.62
XYL reached a 52 Week low at 68.49
"P/E RATIOS TOO HIGH FUNDAMENTALS ALL WRONG, BIG INVESTORS PULLING PROFITS, REMINDS OF A BAD IPO."
Why is no one talking about this company's UV disinfection systems? Seems like this is going to be a huge play in coming months/years. What am I missing?
"This stock is up over 60% in 12 months. Not the flashy returns of a well selected crypto or meme stock, but this is solid and backed by the unfortunate megatrends of water crisis management and weather related flooding that seems to be increasing year by year. Many will depend on innovation in this space."
What are your guys thoughts on xylem now??

XYL is down 12.92% to 62.80
XYL reached a 52 Week low at 58.52
XYL is up 6.48% to 60.31
Another great quarter coming up. Perhaps Xylem will punch through 80 this time.
"Xylem is too ""splintered"" as a company to be cohesive. One brand, out of dozens, has no idea what the others are doing. There is no cohesiveness -- a company of this size should be managed accordingly."
Was not expecting this stock to perform this well since I bought it.
"Susan, do you still own this stock? Jim? It's trading at 2017 prices and I was wondering if it's worth a nibble given that an infrastructure bill may be coming down the road. Curious on your opinions since you opined on this stock a few months ago. thx in advance."
"Their pump selection tool is super useful and makes engineers want to rep their product more than other manufacturers. Better quality, service, profit margin"
XYL is down 4.98% to 76.64
"Following the departure of Andrew Fraher, the marketing department is at a complete loss as to how to proceed. The restructuring hurt the co worse than they realized it could, and it has nearly imploded. What's left -- lots of small companies owned by Xylem that have no cohesiveness, it's like a micro-cap mutual fund with many companies that ""seem"" unrelated without a central theme or centralized control."
Sensus a Xylem brand.
Anyone want to bet that Xylem won't be above 77 by the end of the week?
"It surprises me that Xylem hasn't made even more of a move up as a result of the China Trade Deal. While the immediate impact of Phase 1 may not be material, it will be helpful and, more importantly, it implies that Phase 2 will be signed and trade relations with China will evolve to the pre-tariff normal. China is a huge opportunity for Xylem and getting back to normal relations would open the flood gates for future growth for the company."
XYL is down 7.58% to 60.19
Xylem is down 8.08% to 63.01
"Xylem is very disorganized internally. They have cut some small costs, to their detriment, being penny wise and dollar foolish. I wouldn't put a dime of my $2M 401k account into this company. The original ITT has performed much better since the divestiture. They've got people working from home who need to be in the office in order to conduct proper business. New mid-level managers have fallen into the Peter Principle trap, rising to their level of ineffectiveness, one level higher than they should be."
This company has been downgraded by numerous analysts. Many have a target between $78 and $80 now.
P/E still too high. $50 is likely fair value given the current market conditions.
XYL reached an all time high at 86.54
XYL reached an all time high at 85.28
"Jim,I have not bailed on Xylem. In fact, I am expecting excellent earnings for Q4. The company tries to be ""real"" with their forecasts when many other companies are willing to issue forecasts which are pie in the sky. In 2020 the US expansion continues, Europe is doing better, and Asia is getting back on its feet. Thus, there is every reason to hope for a better than expected Q4 result and forecast for 2020."
"I am still as bullish. The only explanation that I can offer for the price decline is the ""wretched October for the market"" that you noted and perhaps that XYL is unfairly being grouped with GE and other industrials that have reported poor earnings."
XYL is up 7.24% to 64.88
XYL is up 6.87% to 68.25
"Xylem is completely missing today's big rally. At least it is holding near the target price issued recently by the analysts. Look at ITT, the company who spun it off, they are making new highs."
"I was unaware of the connect Xylems connection to the tar sands, until watching Michael Moores new film."
XYL is down 7.54% to 81.00
Xylem is down 4.90% to 87.12
I added today at $81.25
I think water will be a big deal in the next decades and this company is a good opportunity to participate.Many people are sleeping on this.
Xylem reached an all time high at 103.33
"Just took a look at the 3-month chart. Boy, it looks like a disaster with no leveling off or basing, just a continued downward trend. Based on my knowledge of the company it is no surprise."
"ITT, the company who spun off Xylem a couple years ago has mostly caught up to the pps of Xylem, even though it was much lower following the spinoff. Several consecutive new 52-week daily highs recently has finally realized the value in the remaining company. Very nice..."
Does not appear many small investors who typically post on these boards are into XYL. I always look to see if someone has any tidbits of info. I like environmental companies and found this one couple years ago from investing in WTRG (water utility).
"Following the first quarter miss, we are lucky to still be in the 70s. Other co's are getting hammered with any miss at all, even when they are on target. It's a rough market environment."
"Contrary to the negatively expressed by ""Jim the short"", Xylem is doing very well. Its recent acquisitions are generating excellent returns. Its core businesses are growing fast as the population and need for water solutions is steadily increasing. This is a solid, well managed, company. The management is doing a great job optimizing resources and maximizing opportunities for growth and returns. The stock has been a great investments and will, in my opinion, continue to be for the foreseeable future."
"In view of the good economy and low corporate tax rates, Xylem should be trading in the 80s. Despite some otherwise positive actions, Trump causes market jitters with all of his unsettled conflicts (for example, trade war with China, with Europe, with Mexico/Canada; government shutdown, declaring a ""National Emergency"" about the Mexican border, browbeating the FED, negotiations with North Korea, defending Russia, abruptly saying the USA is pulling out of Syria and then backpedaling, and on and on). I expect many of the Trump related items to be at least somewhat resolved over the next few months and the Xylem stock price will go back to the 80s. Xylem is a company operating in great product markets, with solid management, with an appropriate but not wasteful dividend, with a history of accretive acquisitions, and excellent growth prospects. There is nothing that is going to derail this company. Like all stocks, it will rise and fall with the tide to a large degree, but its price growth should exceed the average stock by a wide margin."
Expensive
Thumbs up if Netflix’s brave blue world brought you here
Xylem reached an all time high at 105.91
"Not to sound like an alarmist but with the ""Water Wars"" coming our way, water and water-related companies like these are the future."
The infrastructure bill will include massive investments in drinking water and waste water related spending.
This will be the next best dividend stock for the the coming decade.

"The co. needs a better name: 1) it's hard to pronounce, and 2) they need to define the name on every piece of literature. Shouldn't they be more efficient at moving water than plants?"
"double bottom, june and Dec 2018. Let's see if it takes off on high volume."
Expecting another great quarter coming up for Xylem.
"Company splintered too much, with HQ offices in numerous states: NY, NC; WI; etc. Will the real HQ please stand up? Even their website is splintered, with too many sub sub sub menus. Need a clearer view as an outsider."
Why did this stock go down if it beat expectations?

"I just sold my modest XYL holding at a loss, as I do not anticipate capitulation any time soon, and I suspect that XYL will be slow to recover once global economic recovery starts. I have no faith in the leadership of President Trump, or Congressional leaders of either party, or the likelihood that they will come up with an effective stimulus bill. I do expect to buy XYL again, but probably not in the short term. But take heart, longs, I am often wrong."
where do you guys see this company in 5-10 years from now? im a potential investor and I see potential in the water tech market to rise due to global warming... do you guys see this as a long term holding?
"Hate the new format. too slow, can't search multiple symbols refresh time is ridiculous! Would love to go back to previous version.Option is to use another engine !!"

"Xylem bites the large and warty one. ITT has performed much better since the reorganization several years ago. Somehow ITT ended up with Goulds pumps, even though Goulds should have been part of Xylem -- being water related. The breakup was good for shareholders, but Xylem has poor management and is too fragmented. Are they in NC, NY or Wisc???? Their ""headquarters"" are difficult to pin down."
Surprising to me that the stock is down after announcing excellent earnings and a very positive outlook for 2019.
$90 coming
Expecting a banner first quarter.
"Quiet board - I'll re-ask Yaniv's question. Given the ""unexpected"" (to those with their heads in the sand anyways) acceleration of ecosystem collapse how do investors view this company. The last 2-3 yearsI've been re-allocating into PIO and PHO while buying Xyl on the dips."
"Xylem used to have a strong presence in the water industry trade magazines. I've noticed that they no longer advertise or even have any articles about their products in successful use around the nation and world. Nothing in Waterword, Water & Waste Digest, Water & Sewer Operator, etc. NOTHING! They are going to slow down without the continuous publicity that used to keep them in the eyes of the buyers of their equipment. They all read those publications, not the internet, to see the interesting articles. I'd not buy their stock after its run up into the 80s. Any future growth will be slowing and is already priced into the stock."
"My favorite water stocks are xylem and aqua. Consistent positive earnings, innovative mindset, and the fact that water is an absolute necessity and slowly becoming scarce we will NEED these companies going forward."

12/5/19 Jeffries lowers Xylem from Buy to Hold and lowers price target from $90 to $70. I don't understand how people got so excited about this Co. without having extensive first hand knowledge of what is really going on internally. Looks like the market noticed today.
"Pete, I think this stock is fairly priced now. Analysts average in the low-mid 60s for their targets. This co has ceased to exist in trade media like they used to, esp for their size. No promotion equals low sales. There are other companies in much hotter industries who promote their wares to potential customers. Those would be better investment choices."
"@Susan As of now (12/6/2018) XYL is 65.52, about where it was 14 months ago. Was the steep decline from 79 earlier this year just market matters, or do you think fundamentals and future sales prospects have worsened? I have little faith in the rational market theory, and I know too little of XYL and its industry to answer that Q myself. Thanks."
