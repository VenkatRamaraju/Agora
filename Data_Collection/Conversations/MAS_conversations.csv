"I was looking to buy a hot tub. Everything was back-ordered about 2 to 3 months. I then looked for a pure hot tub play in the market. No such thing, but Masco is a manufacturer of hot tubs. I am showing about a 15% gain in five weeks. If the run keeps up, I will be able to cover the hot tub cost."
Can anyone help me and explain the debt/equity ratio of 1750% in Masco?
