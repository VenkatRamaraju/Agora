"BK has all the tailwinds conventional wisdom suggests it needs to succeed: rising interest rates, increasing but not excessive inflation, and increasing fee income due to increasing AUM and back office ops client needs. Either management executes and delivers sharply increased shareholder value over the next 18 months , or they should be shown the door. I’ve been waiting more than ten years for BK to deliver improved results. It’s time!"

"BK's share count has declined by more than 30% over the past 10 years, including an outstanding 2.8% just in this last quarter. And there is still, I think, another $4 billion remaining under the authorized share repurchase plan. At this price that could reduce the share count by another 8% or so."
