"All Zero Strike Options Should Be Revoked Or E. Warren Will Not Be Happy With These Country Club, Good Old Buddy Bankers. I'll Have To Send Her An Email."
Trian is probably selling more shares knowing they have the buyback to sell into.
Does the CEO have the slightest concern or interest about shareholders?
Without Scharf the company is thriving
7/20/2021 Argus To BUY! Would Like To See $60.00.
"Why Did They Ever Have ""Unnecessary Management Levels""???"
Looks Like Someone Is Buying. Heavy Volume But Price Steady. Buffett???
Tonight announce a big dividend increase and drastically reduce the buyback. Cash is king going forward. Staying the course with all the system upgrades is good and will create value and growth in the future. Buying back shares only enriches management and their options.
"So, how bad is BK doing? Seems like a solid earnings report. Business looks good. Sell on new?Tomorrow? Down more or recover to $54 ish ?"
Maybe This CEO Knows What He Is Doing?
890 million shares. Buffet owns 10%
Is Warren B. Adding To His Position? He Owns Both Stocks.
Pretty much good news with earnings and revenue for a stock with a low P/E and paying dividends. The forward guidance had no surprises as interest rates are low and have been low. Unfortunately it is not liked by the analysts and you wonder how long some of the major holders will hang in there. The only hope may be a merger.
Seems overdone. Bought @42.5
"BK profile says July 24 is Ex- Div date but recent publication by BK says July 27, not sure which one to follow. Anyways, BK is going to move up regardless once we have positive news from the Vaccine pharma companies in the Congressional hearing today. Hope we get some positive news and BK will move up along with all other stocks and the divi will be cherry on the top."
BK is near a 52 week low. Why?
Scharf didn't do much for the stock appreciation -- $40 to $46 in 3+ years.
"The Banks Did What The Government Told Them To Do. File SAR On Cash Transactions Over $10,000 In Cash Except For Exempt Companies Like Giant Eagle, Sears, Etc. The Government Never Followed Up On The Reports. This Happened For 20 Years And The Government Did Nothing. Is Elizabeth Warren Behind This? Do You Know How Many People Audit The Banks. Internal, State, Federal, FDIC, Compt. Of The Currency? I Think Someone Bought A Ton Of Puts Before This Hit Piece Was Put Out. George Soros?"
More layoffs in Pittsburgh. The only strategy management has is to reduce headcount and expenses. At some point you need to increase income or sell the Company to another firm that can grow it. This current team is lost.
Is Warren B. Going To Buy BK? He Has The Cash And Could Restructure The Company And Look Like A Genius.
BK is a solid company. Long term. Just increased holdings.
These Guys Need To Sell Out. They Can't Seem To Run The Company.
Where Is Our New CEO? Will It Be The Guy Running Wells Fargo?
Bank of New York Mellon reached a 52 Week low at 29.09
BK reached a new 52 Week Low at $46.53
Nice To See A Move Up.
Warren B. Should Buy These Guys For $60.00 Per Share. He Has The Cash Plus Some.
"$4.04 earnings for 2018. Subtracting 13 cents due to share repurchases brings you to $3.91, a 17 cent increase over 2017 earnings of $3.74. Subtract out another 15 cent due to Trumps tax cut and you come to an earning increase of 2 cents or 1/2 of 1%. My question is why should we brace for higher expenses in the first quarter of 2019 for bonuses? Charlie adjusted the pay structure to reward people for creating growth and there wasn't really any."
The Fed Sure Helped The Market. He Needs To Start Buying Bank Stocks To Keep Them From Going Under.
Sold today. Nice little gain. Will keep an eye on this one
"BK announced that a dividend of 31 Cents per common share to all the holders on July 26th will be payable in only 10 days (Aug 7th). Most of the financial banks are sound except a few usual suspects like WFC and C. Tomorrow we have to watch BAC, MS, and SCHW earning reports and any positive news from those bank will increase BK price. Some folks are barking loud with horrible earnings report but if you peel your eyes and pay close attention you will see that BK beat the market expectations. I see $38 in few days and if we have more positive news from vaccine trials then $40 is just a stone throw away!"
My goodness. The CEO talked about the inverted yield curve. How about getting more clients!! Do something to earn your unwarranted oversized paycheck!!
"Santomassimo knows, that's why he is leaving."
"Hate To See Anyone Lose Their Jobs But Mellon Was Operating As A Good Old Boys Company For Ever. Probably Had People Making $300,000 A Year Just To Go Golfing With Clients."

"Lowering interest rates is bad for banks and for money savers in CDs, etc. ..Look for withdrawals and CD closures."
"Bny MELLON bank in just this year alone has four governments suing it Argentina Brazil England and Germany. In England its activities in conjunction with KPMG were called an ""exceptional Breach"" of fiduciary responsibility and the case spans 8 years of improper reporting of assets. Sounds familiar to the improper reporting of my family's accounts."
Great earnings in a difficult economy. Why BK not jumping up for joy? Please advise. BK should be trading closer to $40.
I know someone who works there who says too many people in upper management who do nothing and they don't listen to the people who actually know what's going on with their clients!

why is this tanking? I want to own it becuase its kinda cool giant trust bank with custodian assets. But why does no one want to own it?
So Sad. It Once Was A Premier Bank And Now After F. Cahouet Retired It Has Been Straight Down. The Mellon Family Probably Don't Even Own Any Stock. BAD Bank Of New York. Never Should Have Merged With Them.
"Looks like a lot lot of layoffs are taking place. I heard a few offices are being closed too. I know the office in Syracuse is one being closed and I heard there's at least one other. Apparently senior leadership hasn't learned anything from 9/11, Hurricane Sandy, blizzards and COVID as far as not putting all your eggs in one basket."
WOW. We Will Now Be Supplying The Picks And Shovels To The Crypto Miners. That Is GOOD.
Did They Cut Or Suspend The Dividend? I Don't See Any Announcement.
HOW does one feel about buying a bank whose symbol is BK ?
"Buy on peak and you will lose, not taking the fake up grade today!Banks are way over bought for months!!"
"Bank sell off coming? Or, just at the bottom of a trading range? Please advise."

The dividend is showing zero in Fidelity and TD Ameritrade research. Did they suspend the dividend along with the buyback?
BK reached a new 52 Week High at 57.44
"BK is in better position than most banks like WFC or CITI with respect to earnings reports and good dividend. There is no reason for this stock to go lower and there are some big players manipulating this price to flush out the weak hands! MRNA, PFE, and Astra Zeneca has positive news on vaccines and life will go back to at least normal if not great! BK will not disappoint as it is a sound bank with good earnings report."

"Charlie received an incentive bonus @110% for a total of $16,775,000. Santomassimo received an incentive bonus @ 150% for a total of $4,500,000. When you make assumptions that are off by over $60,000,000 in one quarter do you really deserve a bonus. There has been no value created since Charlie and his team arrived."

"Bank stocks have been going down due to lowering interest rates hurting their profitability on lending. But the bulk of BK's revenue comes from fees. Am i wrong or is the market unfairly punishing this stock?That being said i have taken an on paper loss on this one. But have no plans to sell, if i had more cash I would consider buying more."
"This stock should be north of 60. If inflation is a driver to bring the market down, it is a driver to BK to increase revenue as the Fed raises rates. The market doesn’t understand the BK model but somehow rewards State Street which is basically a clone"
Since Joe Is Taking Over The PBOC Could Make An Offer For These Guys. Joe And China Have A GOOD Relationship.

Time For Warren Buffet To Make Some Changes. Get New Board Members And Hire A CEO To Sell Of Custodial Business And Buy Back Stock.
21 million shares traded yesterday. I wonder who is selling?
"In 2007 when the Bank of NY and Mellon Bank merged the share count was 1,145,983,000 now, 9 years later with all the share buybacks the total outstanding shares are 1,066,286,000. So the shares have been reduced by 79,697,000. So these buybacks are just a gimmick. Instead of buybacks which don't appear to materially affect the total shares outstanding, BK should increase the dividend."
So the reason for the drop in price is because of increased expenses and fear that they won't earn $4.30 next year. With the shares reduced to an average of around 860 million next year they have to net around 3.7 billion. They just want to buy back the shares cheaper on Tuesday.
Increase the dividend to .36 a quarter and decrease the share buyback to 2.1 billion a year. The buybacks aren't supporting the stock. Create some value while waiting for the growth to materialize.
I've never seen company management that just doesn't care at all about its' shareholders. It's just miss after miss. Lousy dividend. Dead money for years.

"Before you get smart on ""BK"" it's good to know that the cash per stock is about 58 dollars incl. outstanding loansand that the recent plunge is partially due to a + 12 % ish upswing in the dollar index because a lot of BK's revenue is global.A new environment ( hopefully post all major fines ) should benefit this Company.Also check how BK stock moved during the financial crisis.This stock was actually UP in 2008 to 2009 for a lot of non domestic investors because of the crisis dollar spikewhile a host of other Banks went to zero."

"I worked for Mellon back in the 80’s, j. David Barnes and frank cohuet knew how to run a company. The glory days for sure.

Steps backwards have been proven to make the path forward more successful."
"This thing has basically done nothing for THREE years, totally pointless to own."
"We are starting to see a teen with this new management team. Despite rising interest rates and tax savings aiding the bottom line and results that exceed expectations, as soon as Moe, Larry and Curly get on the conference call the stock takes a nosedive"
So the question is how will Charlie sink the stock on Wednesday? Miss Earnings? Mention new hires who are going to supposedly change the culture and create vast amounts of income in the future but haven't created didilly? Mention the buyback program that has lost millions to date propping up income and creating more stock options for his executive team? Talk of new features for clients that he's is giving away for free? Talking about not creating ETF's that will eventually cannibalize most mutual funds due to the fee structure? I think it's going to annoying at best.
"Miss earnings by .02 and the stock drops $5. Beat earnings by .06 and the stock moves up $1. Frustrating. Charlie, spread the buyback evenly over the next 90 days. The market is going to be down to sideways at best. The average price over the last quarter was easily less than $49, the price of the last buyback."
Buffet Is Looking For A Big Deal? Here Is A Good One. It Needs Broken Up But That Would Be Good.

It has imposed dictators on foreign populations just to manipulate the cost of commodities. General Pinochet in Chile, a Japanese president in Peru? The destruction of Argentina's currency and economic system, development and growth. Puerto Rico, Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Venezuela and other countries not named here.The bank hurt countless individuals, even those whose money it was supposed to protect and grow, like Lord Wheeler to name just one. The bank hires employees that engage in not just banking crimes, but sex crimes as well. The bank spies on it's clients and the beneficiaries of the trusts it manages in an effort to size them up to see how much they can get away with behind their clients backs.This bank should be permanently closed for business."

BK should be in the 60’s. Conservative model with a PE of 13 and the leader in market segments. May be the most undervalued play out there which is why Buffet keeps loading up on it.
