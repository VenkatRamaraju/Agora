"Thinking both $KIM and $MAC are good for holding here. Just a matter of time, meanwhile dividends."
Anybody understand what is driving the price down???
"I know this, if KIM falls below 16.15 you buy and if they go up over 17 you sell."
KIMPRM are at $20.50 the call price is $25 with at .33 cent payout on 6/29 a yield of 6.47% it is a good deal if Kimco get gets a credit upgrade which is what they are looking for a few months ago KIMPRM was trading $25 whats changed ? interests rates may stay low for awhile Kimco cash flow keeps improving they will buy back debt. Kimco common is also a buy with over 7% yield
"""With their assistance we have ample liquidity to navigate through these challenging times and to move quickly if opportunities present themselves""Sounds like KIM looking for acquisitions."
"yah, in what world is cutting, suspending or dropping a dividend a good thing and going to help share price. Maybe a dreamer or a spinners world, but not anyone elses."
Another example of excessive management compensation. Is the CEO worth 3.9 million? Disgraceful.
Albertson Companies announces another great quarter. Keeps lowering debt. Love it. Can't wait for Albertsons to go public and KIMCO 10% ownership kicks in. Could be worth at least a billion dollars to Kimco
kimco took a dive today....second quarter results look good....this stock should be 20 and over...every time it goes down i buy more...this and ATT are two of my big holdings....not sure what i am missing.
nice hit target
KIM - Open-air Shopping Centers.Not Malls owners like MAC & SPG
Robert i have owned kimco since it went public ....can't understand it's price ...back in 08 or 09 they issued more shares and the stock never recoved from that.....I all wounder what am i missing the stock is just not liked by wall st...great dividends ...Rob
"The 7 properties in Puerto Rico are basically worthless. Also, management reported in their last report that the redo on locations that need replacement and releasing is going slower than expected. Remember, they have to tear out tenant improvements and build new interiors. My experience here in California is that takes at least six months. So no income for 6-12 months once a tenant leaves and you sign a new lease and do the improvements. When you combine that with interest rate increases of 3-4 times a year for the next one to two years and the stock market should drop. The stock indexes are too high. We should expect a 20% correction every decade as it always happens. If Venezuela, Mexico, Iraq oil exports continue to drop prices of oil will go higher which can bring on a recession. I will not be surprised is stock prices are lower still in 2018 or early 2019. This would wipe out any dividends. Sometime it is worth going to 50% - 75% cash after big runs in stock prices."
Kimco on sale buy buy by
"Any serious income investors here, reit experts? I have a fair slug of KIM in my portfolio, mostly based on the S&P guess that FV / 2018 is $21, like the dividend. Also, wanted to work with the ""nobody shops stores, B&M, death-of-retail"" spam that was everywhere this last year. No developed independent opinion, but KIM looks at least OK to me, in a diversified portfolio. Comments anyone (I am an actual live small investor, not a spam machine.)"

"This stock seems so cheap under $15, I keep buying under 14.50.The divvy is excellent and management is a little better than I expected.All in all this is a very good conservative investment."
ex dividend is next monday october 1st
Backing down toward the 52 week low. Short interest up to 19 million shares. Crazy times.
KIM is up 10.04% to 8.55
"Today, Citibank raised its target from $18 to $20!"
"BEST REIT stock ...no comparison..Great Management team. Best location malls. real estate is all about LOCATION, location location...Kim.. got the best locations. HOLD and collect dividends"
Have run up too much debt? The big compensation packages must be addressed. How can they slash the debt?Just gambling too much with leverage?
Bought 5k shares to start.
"Let Connor Flynn, form a club group of investors and buysome of the existing portfolio, He must stand up and be counted!"
Inching towards the 200 day...
I can see the worries on US shopping malls etc. But here in the Netherlands we had the same worries 2 years ago when internet trade was supposed to vacate shops in our city centres. Did not happen and good locations filled up quickly with new businesses. People still want to go out and shop and see and talk. So I bought some more KIM @USD15.
"Moody's report and technicals help explain today's action - closing in 10.30-s important as it would push KIM up into next trading range. Kimco Realty Corporations (NYSE- KIM, Kimco) Baa1 senior unsecured debt rating reflects the solid and steady performance of its shopping center portfolio and strong liquidity position. The challenging retail environment and the REIT's elevated net debt + preferred to EBITDA ratio are some other important considerations. Its modest fixed charge coverage reflects the meaningful proportion of long-dated debt and perpetual preferred securities in the capital structure and pending income realization related to ongoing development/redevelopment projects. Some Kimco tenants will be meaningfully affected by the social distancing and store closure guidelines such that their ability to pay rent will be compromised. The REIT is well-equipped to work with its tenants due to its liquidity position and the meaningful proportion of rent-paying tenants who provide essential goods and services such as grocers and drug stores."
Mall Stock will have negative earning.Buy KIM is better.
close to 52 wk low. Seems like a great entry point but with rate hikes (2) coming not sure. Wheres the bottom? Any thoughts out there? thanks
KIM reached a new 52 Week Low at 14.46
"Back up the truck This reit is doing great with grocery anchored centers and it owns 700,000,000 in Albertson grocer stock"
bought in this week for the dividend. anyone else loading up?
KIM is down -100.00% to 0.00
Nice gain!
Feel Kim going higher from here. Been buying on a dip so have 40454 shares at 10.71 avg. this is my second largest holding after Dk. Expect 15 by December as we recover from the recession and pandemic.
Any specific reasons why the share price has declined over the past month?
KIMCO will get a credit upgrade this stock s/b $20 today
"KIM was smart to take some $ off the table prior to ipoBY Knight Ridder/Tribuneâ€” 9:03 AM ET 06/26/2020Jun. 26--Thirty million Americans are unemployed, coronavirus cases are climbing, and plywood still covers storefronts in some Philly retail districts. But trillions in U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve borrowing are pumping up the economy, so investors are buying, selling and even planning new operations. New deals include:Shares of Albertsons Cos. Inc., the chain that owns Malvern-based Acme Markets plus many others -- nearly 2,300 U.S. supermarkets in all -- will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange Friday after the Idaho-based company's owners sold 50 million shares late Thursday to Wall Street bankers at $16 each, failing to reach the company's target of $18 to $20.Even at the reduced price, the sale enriches a group of Albertsons' private owners, including Cerebrus Capital Management of New York and Philadelphia-based Lubert-Adler real estate funds. Shares will trade Friday on the New York Stock Exchange using the symbol ACI.The sellers invested $100 million in Albertsons in 2006 and millions more in 2012 and 2014. A 30 percent jump in spring grocery sales thanks to the coronavirus pandemic has helped the company boost its cash and pay down debt, making it more attractive to investors, at least for now.The $16 price will delay a hoped-for quick profit by Apollo Global Management ( APO Loading...Loading...), the investment firm whose partners include billionaire Sixers managing partner Joshua Harris. Apollo paid the equivalent of $17.50 a share for a 10 percent stake in Albertsons just last month, betting the stock would soon be worth more.Both Apollo Global and Lubert-Adler manage money for the Pennsylvania state workers' and teachers' pension systems (SERS and PSERS) and would share their Albertsons profits with the pensions, after taking multi-million-dollar fees and a slice of the profits.Albertsons, whose stores include Jewel groceries in Chicago, Shaw's in Boston, Vonn's in California, and Safeways in several states, boosted wages by up to $4 an hour and added 40,000 jobs after the coronavirus shutdowns started in March. But Albertsons ended that temporary hazard pay June 20."
"I am starting to look at KIM as a buy. They are properly positioned for the next phase of this part of the real estate market, which is the scarcity value of these malls. The constant negative news on retailers is an overhang on the stock, but eventually this should stop and turn the other way."
"Since Rite Aid and Albertson's ended the buyout here is what was said on the earnings conference call about Kimco's position in Albertsons if the Rite Aid transaction doesn't go through. "" This is Ray. With respect to the Albertsons and Rite Aid transaction. For us, at least, on the Albertsons side, they're really performing very well. Last 2 quarters -- I got 2 straight quarters of same-store comp growth. This last quarter, they beat -- their EBITDA was $44 million above last year's. And they're really trending very well. So to the extent that if the Rite Aid shareholders don't approve transactions, I think we're very well suited for the company going forward to take other opportunities. You saw it today, the transaction with SUPERVALU that rid us out of consolidation in the grocery business on the wholesale side, but I think there's a lot of opportunities going forward for Albertsons. We'll just keep our heads down and keep making money on that and work it out as you go forward. But I think, Glenn also wants to talk to you about the capital part."" ""Yes, from the capital standpoint, again, as I've mentioned, several times already, there's nothing in our numbers for '18 or '19 as it relates to Albertsons. We remain completely focused on execution around the portfolio, our dispositions, our balance sheet management, our developments, our redevelopments. When and if Albertsons happens, it will be a positive for us, but there's nothing baked into our numbers for it. And as I mentioned, we've no debt maturities and enormous amount of liquidity at this standpoint. So we are very comfortable with our capital position.And our disposition plan for '19 will not be impacted one way or the other. So that wouldn't impact our desire or need to ramp up disposition in '19."""
"Big demand for the well located ToysRUs sites. Aldi's, TGT, and BIG will be bidding for the sites. Won't be empty stores for long."
Up 2% in after-hours. is this normal for KIM? did earnings leak?
Any news?
"Doesn't sound so bad to me.I bought more today.''Kimco leased to Toys 'R' Us stores at 23 of its almost 500 shopping centres, which represented only 1 percent of annual base rent, said David Bujnicki, head of investor relations at the New Hyde Park, New York-based REIT.At an average of $11 (Â£7.8) a square foot, the existing Toys 'R' Us rents are about 15 percent to 20 percent below market, so there should be upside when the spaces are released, Bujnicki said.''"
"Supermarkets are killing it.

Why is this up on a down day? Anybody know? I'm too new to the name to know.Thanks!
KIM is up 9.24% to 9.46
KIM co annual meeting is next week in NYC they have some explaining to do new lows today what are they hiding perhaps accounting issues ?
why are folks still buying kim ?
"Not 1st class, premium brands. Mostly 3rd rate, off the beaten path, and in low income neighborhoods. Panhandlers in front. Broken Auto Glass in the parking lots. #$%$ even in daylight hours."
Kim should put some electric charger and hydrogen charger and some automated banks like bank of America trying in their shopping centers.
"The bottom may have been reached. Any tenant in a KIMCO mall who hasn't reopened, probably can't. Unpaid rent from February, 6 months, can be written off. Space can be vacated and leased to new tenant. Where 1 business fails, another succeeds. The nail salon fails. A Covid store selling mask, gloves, sanitizer will move in."
"Grocery anchored shopping centers??? Looks to me that most are non grocery anchored shopping centers. I just started to check out this stock, and am rather disappointed."
"Well, this is BS. The recent presentation to the investors specified who are the major rentals. None of them was beyond 2-3% and I donâ€™t recall Toys-R-Us among them."
Shopping Center anchored by Grocery with open air.Great Deal.
"Nearly a half million shares granted at zero to insiders!? Why, because the bottom fell out of the companies value?"
"Crossing below $9 is another add. People today Kimco is trading around 75% of Book.That is a REIT, we are talking Depreciated Book. Do you guys understand that the currentprice represents not only zero appreciation for the past decades, but also a steep discountto the actual cost. All the depreciation taken on these properties has been deducted fromBook. You are pricing Kimco at Land Value or less, when you factor in their Alberstons Stake.This is an easy buy and wait until senses come back."
??? Down ???
Love to jump all in at these levels but with rate hikes ahead there could be further downside. Any suggestions greatly appreciated. Thanks
Another idea.In those malls that have Movie theaters offer Movie Pass subscriptions as a promotion and have all tenants share the cost as The participate in the higher mall traffic.
Earnings were suppose to indicate a downward trend just like the share price over the last 6 months.But instead of lowering guidance for 2018 they actually raised it. Management is sticking to their game plan of re-positioning their assets and it appears to be right on track.Other than the share price...what's not to like?
KIM is up 8.52% to 10.45
Best day to buy. Day it goes X always down 3 percent or so on X day. This is a 20 stock all day
Well this interest rate environment looks to be good for KIM...
"Nearly 800,000 shares given to insiders @ 0 cost, then shown as ""insider purchases"" What's up with that!!"
"Per earnings call, you can tell analysts disappointed in guidance. But pretty clear that management is being conservative and setting the bar low so they can outperform as the year goes on. I donâ€™t understand why investors these days have no persistence, no patience and are just so easy to run away in fear."
"I just reviewed KIM and was wondering why so many on this thread is complaining about the share price? I see a 52 week performance of 26.25%, a yield of 6.2%. P/E 17.82. Not sure p/e carries much weight in a REIT. Financial health is outstanding, growth and valuation is ok. Off 46 cents from 52 week high. Iâ€™m thinking about owning a few positions for the yield. A 5 dollar price fluctuation over the course of one year ainâ€™t anything to worry about.Wish I bought in before the ex date."
"Kim has long term statrgy, and has best management team..no one can compete with them any time soon."
"This stock is a long term hold, enrolled in a DRIP so I can acquire many more shares tax-free in my IRA. I'm 58 and building an income/dividend producing portfolio as one of my four streams of income for when I retire. Dips in the price are fine with me since that buys me more shares over time."
Kimco Realty is up 10.05% to 11.17
earnings looked in line with predictions with good outlook. maybe 20's on the way...
"It is more than a dividend story. Transition to properties with high potential for repurposing and redevelopment has been underway for some time now. The company will start seeing benefits in 2019 and 2020. While they have been divesting properties and reinvesting it has cut into Revenues and Earnings, but those investments into higher return projects will start to pay off. The balance sheet is solid and the debt maturity profile is in great shape. There is also a hidden asset with the Albertson's stake that some day will be monetized. Also, the Amazon news highlights the value they have been adding by seeking entitlements and utilizing location to develop multi purpose developments."
I read that US Realty stocks are sold because of worries malls may not be popular anymore. Can anyone explain why KIM is hammered much more than others? Is the % dividend now above 5% not attractive enough?
wow
KIM owns properties on prime locations. they sold most of slow growing areas last year. perfect  timing for them. their properties will be more and value able year after year.
Bought more. Now have 51408 shares at avg 11.92. Wish I could have bought some Friday but ran out of cash. Pays decent dividends while the stock will appreciate in the coming weeks esp after the fiscal stimulus agreement. 17 by year end.
Albertsons is hoping to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The requested ticker is ACI. Investors should keep an eye out for Albertsons stock. The Albertsons IPO could be the biggest of the year. Nice! Could this be a special dividend?
"I loved Kimco when it was below book. That was a gem of a purchase. Cheap Bricks and ""A"" Locations is a pretty good combo. Today Kimco is better than most REITS and I am still shooting for a $20 exit price."
"KIM has about 1% exposure to ToysrUs, so a 5% drop makes total sense."
"PLD, best REIT in America.Tremendous growth anticipated in PLD."
Goes X Monday huge dividend buy all you can today
why is this dropping
I have a quick question for long time Kim holders. When you ;look at the max chart here on yahoo something happend around August 2008 that cause the stock price to dive to around 7.90. The dive was dramatic even when compare to Market performance that year. I cannot find any explanation as to what drove this event. Does anyone have any information . Thanks in advance
"Why does this stock and other REITs trade with such volatility. Who are these short term traders? The underlying business of REITs moves at the speed of a turtle, yet the stock trades around like the business is very dynamic and changes from day to day. First the traders sold it because brick and mortar was going to die. Then they sold it because interest rates were going to rise. It is becoming clear that real estate that is in great locations will survive and thrive and you need to look no further than the demand that will be created from Amazon's new HQs. In addition, interest rates have moderated and it is pretty clear that the Fed will slow down if not pause on the its interest rate increases. In addition, Kimco has done a great job selling locations that aren't going to be premium properties and reinvesting in premium properties that have a lot of upside with new entitlements, mixed use development and opportunities to bring below market leases up to market rates. This doesn't have to be so hard. For those who look deeper than an inch and have a forward looking investment approach this is a great asset to accumulate."
"KIM is selling at the same price in 2018 as it sold for in 2002. Also, interest rates are going to be raised 3-4 times in 2018 andthe stock indexes in the U.S. usually correct after big runs whichis the case in the U.S. If the indexes drop 10-20% in either 2018or 2019 everything will fall. That includes KIM. The yield is notworth holding KIM. The price has been in free fall as the industrywill be hurt as Sears and Kmart and JC Penny and Macys closemore stores every quarter. Obviously KIM is seeing that problemeven though they do not have significant exposure to that problem."
Kimco walked away from Shopping Center acquisition. Anyone know if the deposit was hard?
"How can these officers take such ridiculous salaries when share price keeps going down? I am a teenager and I would be EMBARRASSED to pay myself that much when the stock price keeps going down. What happened to integrity, honesty, accountability, morality..?"
does anyone hold this long term for the dividends its awesome dividends or am I wrong?
"Kimco keeps getting good reviews, very good credit ratings all this good news is making KIM real cheap buy"
good opportunity to own at cheap price. solid company
Bought at $13.27 today. I think KIM is oversold.
KIM is up 5.05% to 14.98
Nice dividend
KIM reached a new 52 Week Low at 13.55
Kimco has exposure to 65 Mattress Firm sites where they will no longer collect rent. This will affect the 4Q. They are also projecting down AFFO in 2018-19. Shopping center REITS are not getting better. Price target is $11 with 10% yield. Avoid!
Bumping around a 52 week high...
Albertson's filing for IPO @ $19 billion valuation. Anybody know how much Kimco owns and what value would go to Kimco?
"One way to make use of vacant space is to add self storage facilities,either operate them or lease to a tenant such as Iron mountain or Cube.Not only will renting the space increase revenue but it will also bring foot traffic to the center."
"IMO KIM with solid fundamentals and best management has done very good in the pandemic turbulence time. With healthy outlook, cheap money, zero interest rate, and solid dividend yield can easily pass $20's . IMO I could easily see KIM at $22 by mid year. I am LONG"
"on December 6 this hit $17, as of today it is down 13% from that point. In the mean time the 10 year treasury note has gone from 2.84% to 2.75%. The yield on Kimco has gone from 6.5% to 7.5%. All I can say is....huh?"
"This is such a great play. KIM went down 60% which is in-line with EAT and other restaurant REITs. The difference is KIM is grocery store anchored in prime locations. Way undervalued.....taking a conservative 25% haircut for lost small business rent, getting to $15 per share is an easy call. Buy Buy Buy!!!"
"Kimco has a portfolio of high quality real estate. The dividend is safe and the rents will rise especially in an economic boom. New supply is constrained. The new tax law should increase demand for REITs. The fundamentals are just better than the stock price is reflecting. So, it will be really interesting to see what this stock price will be in a year, in 2 years and in 5 years? Buying now is going against the crowd, but buying low provides high future returns."
"Even with the liquidation of toys are us,it doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that they stop paying rent. If they do they lose whatever rights they might have. KIM can potentially benefit from this situation."
Anyone out there knows what will become of $300 million KImâ€™s investment in RAD ??

"Insider sold all they shares, smell bankrupt here"
One of best RIETS..no questions.. great management team.
"I am not buying KImco today because it has dropped from $32 because it didn't deserve to be there in the first place. I am not buying Kimco because it has a great growth opportunity. I am buying Kimco because I don't believe real estate is dead. I believe many bad real estate investments have been made and tons of properties have been developed that will go under, but there will always be demand for the best real estate locations. I am buying Kimco because it focuses on owning the best real estate. I am buying Kimco beause the price has dropped so low that going forward I don't need it to grow rapidly, I just need them to maintain the dividend which now yields 7.6%. I do believe there is imbedded value in their portoflio of properties that will be realized over time through redevelopment and mark to market opportunities. I also am buying Kimco because I like to buy what everyone hates and has just completely walked away from with no regard to fundamentals. Buying it at $32 or $28 or even $22 was a mistake, but buying it at $14.75 is not."
#NobelPeacePrize would have been a joke if given to #RealTrump or #Kim
any news on plans to reinstate the div ?
good numbers!
Crazy. When does the madness end?
They had some interesting insights about KIM on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
what is the ex-div date
16% return in 12 months. Not too shabby.
ToysRUs announced liquidation today. No reorganization.I believe KIM has 20-25 stores where the boxes will be empty after liquidation ends after 60 days of going out of business sale. This number of stores empty with six-twelve months to sign up new leases and then build out the space is a year without rent on these big stores. I see impact of no rent on the stores and then spending money for six months to build out stores for new tenants. This story with FED increase in 10 days which will have effect on about $100 million of liabilities increasing in rates. Not a lot of money on $6 billion in liabilities but still negative news.
