why do they even bother having a post on this stock.
"Florida Store to be 43,000 sq ft on East Colonial Blvd Orlando. Should be a huge moneymaker as excellent location.Opening Soon!"
"They have only 4M$ in cash... They remind me Home stock, very similiar situation.I think it will go down bit more, before move significantly up."
1000 shares under $22!!! What a bargain!!
Why CONN is sinking?
"Why is Zack's Research sending out two press releases in just 7 days telling people to sell CONN? Why is there animosity towards CONN that the essentially do the same press release twice? https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moving-average-crossover-alert-conns-162004546.htmlMoving Average Crossover Alert: Conn'sConn's, Inc. CONN could be a stock to avoid from a technical perspective, as the firm is seeing unfavorable trends on the moving average crossover front. Recently, the 50 Day Moving Average for CONN broke out below the 200 Day Simple Moving Average, suggesting short-term bearishness.This has already started to take place, as the stock has moved lower by 40.6% in the past four weeks. And with the recent moving average crossover, investors have to think that more unfavorable trading is ahead for CONN stock.If that wasn’t enough, CONN isn’t looking too great from an earnings estimate revision perspective either. It appears as though many analysts have been reducing their earnings expectations for the stock lately, which is usually not a good sign of things to come.Consider that in the last 30 days, 3 estimates have been reduced, while none has moved higher. Add this in to a similar move lower in the consensus estimate, and there is plenty of reason to be bearish here.That is why we currently have a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) on this stock and are looking for it to underperform in the weeks ahead. So, either avoid this stock or consider jumping ship until the estimates and technical factors turn around for CONN."
"Will this help or hurt the stock? ""CONN has earned itself a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)"""
Management knows what this is but the street doesn’t. This is a high interest loaning company. High margins because you can’t get credit elsewhere. Same store sales matter but not as like a normal retailer. Getting paid back is the most important factor.
Nobody ever post here..Just trying to find out if this is good company to invest?
Time to add more on this dip. Correction was expected will go back up.....HOLD or BUY do not let the Shorts take advantage of a stop loss.
Short squeeze potential?
"Believe it or not, but this stock price is heading higher."
"No reason undervalued for so long, time to up!"
Does anyone know in what time the earning will be published today?
Tough call here. Own a big block of Conn stock and almost at break even. With earnings next Tuesday this could either crater or run from here.
"this in june last year. Chairman, President and CEO of Conn's Inc (CONN) Norman Miller bought 11,765 shares of CONN on 06/04/2019 at an average price of $17.03 a share. The total cost of this purchase was $200,358.... why would CEO buy at such a price if the company was not doing well. so crazy manipulation of mm."
"The way it started the day , went down below 12.27 and came back to 12.62$ is very encouraging. Let's watch the fun tomorrow. Going to be big day for longs."
"Consumer discretionary, not hitech but a category people spend money on as we continue to recover from Covid, we spend on our home furnishings, to be comfortable, safe, and keep the family happy. CONN should continue to grow especially with the small float. I would not have gone short in this category at this time, just not prudent trying to swim against the current."
6.5M shares shorted now which is 40% of the floating stock. This is very bullish. The stock currently is highly under valued. Institutions are accumulating the stock between 12.15 and 12.60. Currently consolidating and making a very nice base. Just a matter of patience of few more days for this to fly. One month short term Target is 17. Please ignore all the business downturn theories. Media suggestion ( ZACK or Yahoo) to sell is indication to buy more and catalyst to catapult is near.
ok trump wants peace w Iran so this will help Florida's newest appliance store
This is a Crazy time. We now have a Market Cap nearing what CONN made for a Stock Repurchase Program last year.Basic they could take the Company Private... @these levels

"Huge buying going on. Someone knows something and they are snapping up cheap shares. If I were you, I would buy with every penny and you will be rich in just a month. Buy now or you lose your chances. Don't wait."
Is now the time for a breakout? Something appears to be happening.
Sure it's wise to invest in BTC right now than it was month ago. If you are really interested I will recommended you toMr George Wright on Fb
Conn's had an outstanding quarter and the stock will rise quite a bit these next couple months.
"This stock is way undervalued at these levels. I know CONN has a couple of main issues:- Same store sales decline of wopping 8,4 %Market hates declining growth. And my experience is that market values negative growth stocks with a PE of 5-6. - Delinquency above 1000 (10,1%)Last time this was an issue for CONN the stock price was below 10. But this time I do not think this is so big an issue, also since delinquency is something other companies struggle at. https://wolfstreet.com/2019/10/25/subprime-auto-loans-blow-up-60-day-delinquencies-shoot-past-financial-crisis-peak/This time around CONN makes money with the Credit model... They didn't 5 years ago. Pro's - Repurchase of 75M$. CONN used 59M$ of this programme and still has 16M$ left for the last quater. Let's say they buy back @13 average. They can accumulate 1.200.000 more common shares. And end up with 4,3M of common shares. This is 15% of outstanding shares, they will eliminate leaving 24.794.062 shares left in the market!!!- PE for fiscal year 2020With an expexted operating income of 66M$ and only 24.794.062 outstading shares. EPS = 2,6PE = 4,86The stock price for 13 under the condition for CONN is undervalued.It should be valued by marked between 14 to 16. NOT 12,50.IF CONN resolves same store sales, this stock is going to sky rocket into a valuation of 25 to 30 already by next earning release."
Good News Earnings With Conference Call Less Than Two Weeks Away!This is silly now that this company is just worthless now.Hold on and let executives clear up the picture.Sure sales will be down along with every other retail store.So what is USA just going to shut down for good and never ever leave their house.Yes travel will be very soft for while along with restaurants and bars but folks are going to say just screw it and buy something for their home cave.
Do you think margin calls and end of year tax selling will force this down to $10?
Like I said yesterday there’s gonna be people coming in and taking profits I need to be a selloff so I figured should I sell should I hold while I’m bullish so Monday after they give their outlook I’m sure it will cover what it lost today Friday and just keep going higher if I did my homework right they should be north of $40 by the end of the year which I think is pretty darn good coming out of a pandemic and could be higher I guess we will just wait and see￼￼
Anyone seen anything at all on earning report? I have a feeling they are waiting for the Dow to swing back up before release. Sentiments ?
I live in South Texas they have been doing a lot of advertising on TV lately I have used their store before hope it does well
thanks guy from China. u guys know a thing or two about market manipulation

Good luck with that in the next sell-off.That is what happen when you buy a stock's float is 9.30 M out of 30.03 M outstanding shares. Manipulation occurs!Hedge funds sell it now and buy it later, when you all dumb your shares.Stick to your shares, there will be a nice bounce to 18$ to 20$ in the short term.The housing market is promising.

"As expected, a really really bad ER just released:Conn's, Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Financial Results And Provides Business Update Related to COVID-196:00 AM ET 4/14/20 | GlobeNewswireConn's, Inc. Reports Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Financial Results And Provides Business Update Related to COVID-19THE WOODLANDS, Texas, April 14, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Conn's, Inc. (NASDAQ: CONN) (""Conn's"" or the ""Company""), a specialty retailer of furniture and mattresses, home appliances, consumer electronics and home office products, and provider of consumer credit, today announced its financial results for the quarter ended January 31, 2020 and provided an update on the business related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.""We are disappointed with our fourth quarter credit and retail results,"" stated Norm Miller, Conn's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""As expected, difficult market conditions within the premium TV and gaming sectors persisted during the fourth quarter and we continued to see the impact of underwriting adjustments we made in the third quarter. We also experienced declining credit performance associated with higher risk vintages, an increase in new customers and difficulties in collections efforts related to implementation of the Company's new loan management system.""""The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our daily lives and our hearts go out to anyone who has been impacted by the illness. We are taking decisive actions to navigate the impacts the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation is having within our markets. We are working to ensure our stores remain open and provide essential products and services that help customers adjust to in-home activities and lifestyles. We are revising our fiscal year 2021 store expansion plans to open between 6 and 8 stores, delaying our Florida expansion to next fiscal year and delaying other non-essential capital expenditures. In addition, we recently borrowed an additional $275.0 million of cash on our revolving credit facility as a precautionary measure to preserve financial flexibility in light of the current uncertainty."""
"Yesterday it traded on Today's news, thus 5 percent on usually large volume. Keep that in mind when buying. Also, the next quarter same store sales will be slightly down relative to Wall Street expectation. Thus, uptick can erode toward the end of the day substantially, possible to 26 area."
"so much of their product mix was based on TVs from china and now that high end is not selling, their business model is broken as consumers pay cash at Walmart, best buy and costco.conns likely headed for bankruptcy now. I lost a lot of money here but glad I sold out the last of my positions around 9 average. they have to cancel Florida expansion. party city fell off a cliff after earnings, expect this to do the same"
"June 4th and 5th there were 3 insider buys by the Chairman, COO, and a director for some 25,000 share in the $17 -$17.97 range. That is over $5 more they paid. Shouldn't we see more insider buys now???????6/5/2019 William E Saunders Jr Director Buy 10,000 $17.97 $179,700.00 43,743 6/4/2019 Lee A Wright COO Buy 5,882 $17.03 $100,170.46 203,189 6/4/2019 Norman Miller Chairman Buy 11,765 $17.03 $200,357.95 388,761"
"Three reasons to buy CONN:1) the company, while flat in revenue, is minting cash at PE of 4 at this level. Lowered forecast in revenue was small, while the stock lost 60% of its value in a month.2) CONN'sare building stores and expanding with very little debt. Florida is their next expansion3) A short interest of 73% is insane. These shorts will need to cover. When that happens the shock will shoot straight up in the sky."
"From Warp Investor: - According to our sim-based analysis, the fair price-to-earnings ratio should be 15.30, leading to a current fair value of $49.25. - CONN currently trades at $25.20, so it appears to be undervalued, with a potential upside of 95.44%."
"Load up....a trader looked at the chart from this the last 6 trading days and he says there will be a break up by at least $1 next week. He says it is tax selling pressure, but once that is gone, this will rocket up $1-$2 next week.He says load up as it won't fall any more."
BUY BUY BUY!!! going to TEN!
don't expect much before earnings call in March. The stock will linger in this free fall mode and bay get to 6 or less. That is what history says. yet the business has been around for a while and seems to have done well earning money now trading at 3.5 x trailing earnings. bear in mind that shorts have taken a raid on the company and shorted 72 of the stock. they need to cover!
"Double bottom.....this gave a base. If we are green by end of day, then it will rise again tomorrow."
"Last day of FY 20...- CONN genererate lots of income. Expected earnings 84M$- Finishing stock repurchase of 75M$.- Has income on the Credit program Even though this is only for maintaining a high product margin. - Keeps expanding with New stores 12-18, while still having earnings of 84M$The real question is how Electronics sale and overall sale is going. MM only love growth companies..."
"this thing is going to EXPLODE UPWARDS into double digits imo, soon and people will complain that they “should have” got in earlier :)"
Looks to be finally reversing ...this is bottom ...10.60 ...closing at 10 80 is great...4 hrs chart looks good as long as it stays above monday ...the daily chart needs a close back above 11 ...11.50 even better...
Expecting share buyback to be announced in coming months. That’s the only disappointment on call. They reduced net debt 41%. This is huge.
Back over $24 soon
"Expect the housing market to continue strong in 2020. Interest rates should remain low, according to the Fed. New home sales are likely to grow and new homes have to buy furniture from somewhere. Expect CONN to get its share of that pie. Bottom fishing is difficult, but it is time for investors to start looking for a floor in this security. The company has solved some of its previous problems and should over time reward patient investors. Do your own DD. But this is the way we see these shares at the present time."
This has to go green today as the stock market indices are up again.
Good lord management just authorize $100mm in buybacks over the next 18 months.
"Buy some long term calls, a bargin today, and ride the the wave!!"
UP 5% and climbing. 200 day MA is $19.30.Loaded up on more shares.
don't sell. we'll start recovering in a shortwhile. they are bringing it down below support level to buy the shares from technical analysts.
About time for a share buyback and huge short squeeze....
"Last year they have wasted 75M$ for share buybacks with average price 19$...Now is the time to do buybacks, not then..."
"You know when you have bought the wrong stock when a day trader posts just two days ago a Press Release back in May of 2019 to lead people to believe it was a recent announcement. What he leaves out is that at earnings when the stock had dropped 35%, CONN also announced they already spent $66 million of the $75 million repurchase program to buy stock at an average of $19. That is right they blew almost the entire amount buying the stock 50% more than it is worth now at $12.50. Shocking and stupid waste of money.Investor2 days agoConn's announces $75M stock repurchase program Conn's board approved a stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the company may repurchase up to $75M of its outstanding common stock. The program will remain effective for one year, unless extended by the board. Under the repurchase program, the company may purchase shares of its common stock through open market transactions, block purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended."
do people understand that if this stock goes to 7 the pe ratio will have to be 2.6. that is unheard of.
Well todays 27.91 % rise helps eliminate any doubts that this company is way undervalued.Trump seems to have a good plan.Same store sales will be down but future looks bright!
That was not a good beginning
What is going on today???
"The people that shop at CONN's cannot buy at Amazon or Baba or online because they need a credit card. And even if they do have a credit card, they won't have the credit limits to buy furniture or appliances. You need to understand that there is a business for companies like this one...look at Rent-a-Center or Aaron's...both have similar business models. If this was your typical brick and mortar furniture store, then i wouldn't be an investor...but it isn't."
Up 9% on Heavy Volume!!!
Will this stock keep on going downIt has reached 37.50 3 Times this past 2 months and can’t get past that. I think this will be down to single digits by year end.
David Martin stop taking negatively about this stock or get out of it and sell your shares.
"Now is the time to start buying. They're not going bankrupt, and their plan for stores is being implemented!"
Conn Up For The Week!Time to accumulate more shares.
"Just like i predicted!!, we will see double digits in no time!! imo, up another 17% is pretty awesome for today :)"
"Zack's Research has a grudge against this company as they sent out 2 SELL reports on CONN on press releases just 7 days apart last week. This is preventing any buys and all these are people selling for tax reasons and the market makers are just pickup up bottom feeding.Zack's Research two sell press releases on CONN has caused the stock to fall further than expected: One appeared on December 13th and the other press release, yesterday on December 20th just 7 days apart:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strong-sell-stocks-december-13th-141702299.htmlNew Strong Sell Stocks for December 13thZacks Equity Research•December 13, 2019https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moving-average-crossover-alert-conns-162004546.htmlMoving Average Crossover Alert: Conn'sZacks Equity Research•December 20, 2019"
"Bought 9,725 Shares @ $12.38 ..Gettin' Ready for the REBOUND!!"
Conn is under valued .... People are buying things they need/ want.GLTA
Is this a good stock to buy before ER?
So this company has a $22 price target and almost a $22 book value and stock is $8.30... and nobody is purposely pushing this down? Lol.... Lots of shorts. It will reverse hard at some point. Enjoy the rest of the day!
Buy buy buy buy buy. This is the bounce and now going up. Don't miss the train. Buy now before it goes back up to $13.
Conn took a breather when it reached its top level of $31 which I calculated through my point and figure method of analyses as a top. At that level sellers came out and created resistance which drove the stock down to below $25 from where buyers again support rising prices towards the last top and possibly higher.
Conn Up Two Weeks In A Row! We will take it.Next week $10.
"Be honest, anyone buying here?"
$20.35 Tangible Book Value as written by GuruFocus. That's were I may sell 20% of my position.
"Conn Same Store Sales To Soar! With the scare of virus spreading customers are going to forgo any spending on travel and spend money on hibernating in there home.Also borrowing costs have been sliced with lower interest rates.And for those chart specialists,Conn filled a gap Thursday with a low of 7.51.Sleep well with Conn stocks in your portfolio."
"Truth is, in 2 weeks they will have a much better idea about progression of market and guidance. I think they beat last qtr and if they can give any semblance of decent guidance, we’ll see $10 pretty quick. Go get’m Conns!"
35-40 by end of next week. This was a major beat.
"On October 30th, when CONN stock closed at $24.24, Zack's Research sent out a press release that CONN was undervalued and is a stock to buy. Just over a month later, the stock has collapsed by 50% and now Zack Research says it is a sell. So, Zack Research tells you to buy at the very top of the price and when the stock falls -50%, it then tells you to sell. WHO ARE THE IDIOTS at Zach Research?https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/592430/is-conns-conn-a-great-value-stock-right-now?art_rec=quote-style_scores-zacks_news-ID04-txt-592430IS CONN a GREAT VALUE STOCK RIGHT NOW????? October, 30th, 2019Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the ""Value"" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, ""A"" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One company to watch right now is Conn's (CONN - Free Report) . CONN is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 8.47, which compares to its industry's average of 12.73. Over the last 12 months, CONN's Forward P/E has been as high as 10.16 and as low as 5.55, with a median of 7.89.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. CONN has a P/S ratio of 0.46. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.48.Finally, investors will want to recognize that CONN has a P/CF ratio of 5.89. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. This stock's P/CF looks attractive against its industry's average P/CF of 6.72. Over the past year, CONN's P/CF has been as high as 12.34 and as low as 4.11, with a median of 6.08.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Conn's's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that CONN is an impressive value stock right now."
"For a decent business, certainly doesn't seem to be any interest on this board. 879 comments in how long a time period??? So I will start."
"the situation of this company today is much better than it was 4-5 years ago. no panic, just hold on to it for 1 yea, shorts will have to recover"
nice quarterly results
This will rebound just give it some time
This may go down to $6 short term and even lower if management does nothing substantial.
GREAT BUY THERE. Last time it DIPPED TO $16 and then BOUNCE TO $26. CHARTS DONT LIE. I’m holding for huge bounce here.

"Once third quarter revenues are released, you should see $7-$8 range.David Mevin2 days agoRemember I told you several days ago that Thanksgiving week and Christmas sales were below already lowered expectations. Clearly, that has been already leaked."
Do we break $40 before earnings ??? Would love to see another blowout quarter and guidance...
head for the hills. i just bought back into conn' . cWhenever i buy a stock it turns into a boat anchor.
gentlemen we have been conn'd
"CONN has been around for 130 years and is making money, just so you know. When the stock hits $20 we will all recall this day of opportunity!"
1% dividend announced by management will send this stock in the 20s
Just opened 1st store in Florida.
What Price Would Conn Do For Buyout?Now I am not saying I have heard or seen anything but if so is $22 reasonable?
Is now the time for a breakout with tomorrows earnings? GLA
Price Target Raised To $11. Maintain Buy by Jeffries!!
"This stock is clearly undervalued, when we be closer earnings day of quarter, this stock will be rising surely."
are there any shareholders here?
Anyone hear of the quarters Earnings Call date?
"There is a fair chance that CONN is likely headed back to the August 2016 low ( Approx. $6.55 p.s.). I have it on my trading board, but I'm waiting for a single digit price per share before I take a position. The overall stock market is at historic highs yet CONN failed to participate in the year-end 2019 rally. The likelihood of a market correction in 2020 is moderate...which will likely take stock prices down across the board. A probable market correction and the pressure of CONN's short sellers (40% of the stock is sold short) supports waiting for a single digit price before taking a position or adding to an existing position. Because of the high Short interest, I also wouldn't short the stock due to a possible short squeeze if unexpected good new hits the press. It's too risky to short and too early to take a position. Patience and a pullback in CONN's stock price is the prudent way to play the trade/investment."
When is CONNs earnings announcement ?
Big fan of the new CEO Chandra Holt.
I speculate the reason this stock and many other great stocks are falling is because of the corona virus. Fundamentally this stock hasn’t changed.
Bought a big chunk of shares just now. Hoping for a very positive earning on Tuesday AM.
"I heard on the radio, they want to add a new convenience tax. It's for people who shop online. This should help brick and mortar stores, and hurt online sales."
any word on earnings/
CONN job!! DOW up 500 points today and CONNjob sets new 52-week LOW.. SMH!! CEO SHOULD BE FIRED!! (even back when it was DOUBLE DIGITS)
Risk-reward looks pretty good at these levels. Decent balance sheet... just need some form of catalyst.
"On October 23rd this stock closed at $26.33 and today about 1.5 months later it closes at $12.59 or about 60% less.Really? Should it be this low after four down days in a row? Can it be 5 down days on Monday? Oh god, oh god, oh god. I am feeling sick to my stomach."
CONN earn good money. They Will make a new share repurchase program. Will it be the same amount 75 M$ they could buy back 1/3 of the outstanding shares at these levels.
"Fear & Uncertainty lead to slower TV demandFear and uncertainties due to the rade war between the US and China and an expected tariff increase in Q3 2019 pushed TV brands to move panel orders to earlier in the first half of the year. Weaker TV set sales led to an inventory build-up by the end of Q2. Also fear of TV price increases due to tariffs, reduced the second half outlook suggesting reduced panel demand and increasing inventories also on the panel side. Panel prices also started to decline.By Q3 2019, too much capacity was chasing too little demand pushing the market to oversupply. Fierce competition has led to drastic panel price reductions, pushing prices below even cash cost for some products. Panel suppliers’ financial results suffered in Q3 as many lost money. Suppliers from China, Korea and Taiwan all started lowering utilization rates by the end of Q3 to reduce oversupply and in the hope of stabilizing panel price. Very low prices combined with lower utilization rates is making the revenue and profitability outlook for panel suppliers difficult in Q4 2019."
"If 3 insiders bought shares in the $17 range in June, why aren't they buying now at $12.50 range? That is almost $5 a share less!"
they do this every year to this stock at this time. some hedge fund wants to buy it up cheap so everyday thay have been shorting this down 5%.WHEN IT GETS TO THE PIONT OF RIDICOLUSNESS THEN THEY WILL STOP SHORTING AND BUY IT UP BIG TIME. IF YOUR IN THIS IT HAS TO BE AT LEAST TILL THE EARNINGS COME OUT IN APRIL. FROM HERE A MINIMUM OF 30 % IF YOU HOLD IT TILL THEN.
"I sadly expect CONN to release some significant credit reserve deficiencies in their 4Q results. With the resignation of John Davis, Pres of Collections, last Friday, and the fact that CONN hasn't yet announced the date for their call, it's a sign that they are working with their accountants to address deficiencies. Looking over the past 10 years, CONNs has never announced a meeting date later than 3/28, or held the meeting later than April 4th. I hope I'm wrong but don't believe I am."
$6.70 on 8/22/2016 then $37.15 on 1/8/2018.Just amazing!
Yes Earnings on 4/9 followed by conference call.All questions will be answered
"My thought is people are buying extra refrigerators, computers, microwave appliances with all the new work from home orders. Conn's benefits with their credit services directly. You don't have to have real money, just credit. That's a sale. Promise to pay down the road. I think we will be surprised with a positive earnings. And it got bumped to tomorrow morning now....sooooo....hmmmmm...LOOOONG! I think. I don't know for sure, but I'm feeling a surprise short squeeze."
"With CONN's getting their house in order at just the right time, just as the economy is restarting. An infrastructure bill also plays well as to support some of it's customer base. Granted it's not techie but it's what people are buying right now as many begin the move forward. Why do you think Berkshire bought Mohawk, no flashing lights just solid growth."
This is very isolated incident due to high sales after Hurricane and stores remained open. Another big box retailer that will declare bankruptcy in the near-term. HH Gregg couldn't weather the storm and their stores were much better managed and comparable pricing. I have short positions in the low 20's and will hedge again in this range. Think Sears when understanding the short squeeze!
"Why is CONN up slightly here in early pre-market trading despite having delivered an absolutely terrible earnings report this morning? It is because some traders and investors are pricing in Coronavirus impacts as an excuse for this bad ER. Here are the facts: This Coronavirus situation began on December 31, 2019 as an isolated and localized incident in Wuhan, China. There were absolutely no economic or other impacts from the Coronavirus outside of China, until at LEAST 3 weeks later, January 20, 2020. Even after January 20, economic impacts outside of China were very small and limited until early February. Fact: CONN's ER today is for the quarter ending January 31, 2020. Fact: CONN has absolutely no direct exposure to the Chinese market. Therefore, today's ER reflects virtually NO impacts from the Coronavirus. None of the numbers can be blamed or excused or glossed over using a Coronavirus excuse. At MOST, 1-3% impacts from late January, only for a few days as the general public just began to start worrying about the virus, are possible. This means ALL of the bad numbers for this quarter have occurred for OTHER reasons. And now, looking ahead, we have the NEXT quarter which will be absolutely and VERY SEVERELY impacted by the Coronavirus because it will encompass February, March, and April, the very heart of the pandemic right here in the USA, where CONN is completely exposed and market-dependent. Therefore, the NEXT quarter is going to be a nightmare of the highest order as far as financials for the company. And, as we approach market open today, these facts will become much clearer to many more traders and investors. That is why we should see gradual weakness throughout the day becoming more and more evident, with the share price consistently dropping to lower lows. Am I right?? I sure hope so, being Short 16000 shares at $4.49. That is my honest analysis and prediction and now we shall see whether I am brilliantly insightful or full of....hogwash??"
Accumulation mode.
"This price drop is ridiculous, bought some at this level. This is a $20 stock at least, and if they would announce a dividend, even $25."
I believe this may be a multi day runner. Buy it when it's cheap.
"With the results of BBY, can we expect the same for CONN?"
"Nobody interested in this stock?Low PE and profitable, even beat estimates last qtr. Hmmm?"
Not complaining but why the big move up today?
"this is a bargain stock. It is undervalued, this is the moment when you buy low and after some months you sell high, so easy, but if you do day trading, you can win but also you can lose a lot."
Have seen speculation of taking the company private as well as buy out speculation. I seen a comment about the shares changing families hands or whatever they did was in stride with them going private. Purely speculation.
Look at the history on this stock. We all know it’s going back up. Don’t pinch pennies and get your shares...
"All right, just got in for 5000 shares. Needed to break below 12, now let’s go baby! Ready to buy 2 more lots if it drops more, but I think we will reverse soon and climb over 15 within a month or so. After next earnings, we should see a nice pop as management has a solid plan and have been overly conservative in their guidance so there will be a beat next quarter. For gaming, the new consoles will be a major catalyst in the reversal to get us back over 25 and beyond. The new product lines will make CONN an even more profitable business in the long run and we will see new highs in 2020. GTLA"
"Have you seen the posts of a short seller, he seems so desesperate that makes me feel bad for him. A trader confident in what he is doing does not post many times asking for approval, this is undervalued and hard to borrow for short selling"
"If you look at today's chart, you can see it is Standard & Poors ratings outlook saved the day.1:36 pm ET S&PGR Revises Conn's Inc. Outlook To Stable; Affirms RatingDow Jones"
dirt cheap based on all metrics. this is not a dead business model. they were up against tough hurricane comps. financing biz is good biz. reminds me of rent a center when it dropped to 7/share.
David Do you know when earnings will be out?
"Bought 11,750 shares @ $12.12 - PRAY for me!! LOL"
"When the worst was expected, the numbers are not bad. It will touch to 6 today."
RSI level and duration are insane...never have I seen anything like this.
"Time to buy. Sellers are gone. Any good new ( like 40 new locations) will send this stock roaring up.Buy, Buy, Buy"
Natural Correction on great run up. Excellent opportunity to buy this stock was mid 30's pre pandemic will be 40's soon with continued great earnings reports like the most recent. HOLD or BUY
Bot 800 shares. Happy! Hold for one year. Cheers longs
Gap has been closed...need volume and this can fly...watch closely the next few days for confirmed reversal.
very surprised at the equity reaction. i thought it was a strong quarter. this companies free cash flow YTD is 270 million. the market cap is 330 mil.
Do we see a 52wk high soon ???
When do they report earnings?
over reaction good time to buy at great price
It's not finished yet. It still has more in it.
Earnings 4/14
If we close above $12.80 today the momentum will to over $130 Tuesday.Book it danno.
"Staying Short on CONN. Not unusual at all for a stock to briefly pop up after bullish sentiment is expressed in an earnings Conference Call. The question is, can the pop hold up or will it deflate once the market as a whole thinks about what was said and how much of it is simply a CEO pumping effort. We shall see if this manages to stay green or not. I think it will deflate soon but if not I will Cover later in the afternoon and take a loss."
anyone holding this here ??
Check gap at 8.99 from April 4th 2017. 8 .99 may be bottom. Will see monday . But check on daily chart.
the management should work with e-commerce to boost the sales.
"Have you ever noticed when day traders post that they bought a bunch and predicting it is the bottom, that they are always wrong? So, yes, this will close red again and fall further.Only the TRUTH1 hour agoBought 9,725 Shares @ $12.38 ..Gettin' Ready for the REBOUND!!"
Enough shorting going on prior to this great earnings report. Could squeeze today if it gets high volume.
QUICK COVER THAT SHORT!
Conn Stores Are Open.People still need appliances.What are you going to do if your refrigerator goes down?That's right go to Conns
Activists Target Big Lots Could Conn Be Next? Makes cents to me with management letting stock value freefall.
"Ford has stock price close to Conn. Earnings are .12 while Conn consensus earnings for quarter is .34. Future quarters .54, Ford has declining sales and no growth prospect.With 18-20 more stores coming this year,which stock would you rather own in the $8. dollar range."
A short squeeze is inevitable tomorrow morning!!!!
The CEO secession plan appeared to be thoughtful and well executed by the company. What about the timing of the CEO transition? I am thinking the company timed the change & announcement before a positive quarter and environment at CONN
Conn opened two new stores ￼plan on opening more good grows no cash burn plenty of revenue it’s just a win-win company ￼￼￼this is just going up and up￼
"It appears some are taking profits, once cleared out, it's on the way up!"
"Cover Shorts!! Congrats on great play but now its over.Time to move on.Up big today on Heavy Volumn, Conn will be back to low 20's soon."
Amazon should buy this company. They'd instantly have a hugely profitable retail presence
"Looks like it will sell off in the next two hours and down another -1-2%. Still too many sellers. With all the tax loss selling, this appears to be falling under $11."
Very happy it moves up.
Conn will be $20 after earnings!!! Too much money in consumers hands
Just thought I'd put a new note. Just bought 2000 shares. Somebody mention to others that this might be a decent company that currently still has decent amount of business!
When will CONN be reporting earning?
This was a good day!!
"This thing is going to POP soon imo, all things pointing Bullish :)))"
Management should take $100mm of that new $275mm credit facility and buy back 90%of shares.
The Good News is that we will get an update this month for this retail stock while other stocks may have to wait several months for earnings!
When is the next earnings... ? I need $42-$45 so hopefully I can get out...
"Terrible results, expecting a big sell-off at 9:30 AM. Looking to close my Short Sell at under $4, perhaps way under, gotta wait and see how negatively the market reactsFourth Quarter ResultsNet income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 was $5.1 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 of $29.5 million, or $0.91 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 was $5.9 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, whichexcludes a loss on extinguishment of debt. This compares to adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 of $31.0 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, which excludes a charge related to an increase in our indirect tax audit reserve.Retail Segment Fourth Quarter ResultsRetail revenues were $315.3 million for the three months ended January 31, 2020 compared to $338.9 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019, a decrease of $23.6 million or 7.0%. The decrease in retail revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in same store sales of 13.3%, partially offset by new store growth of 7.6%. The decrease in same store sales was a result of a combination of significant price deflation for premium large screen televisions and an increase in production by second- and third-tier manufacturers, which has made cash purchases of large screen televisions more accessible to our core customer, and negatively impacted same store sales during the three months ended January 31, 2020. In addition, underwriting adjustments made during the year ended January 31, 2020 further negatively impacted same store sales.For the three months ended January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019, retail segment operating income was $35.7 million and $54.7 million, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted retail segment operating income for the three months ended January 31, 2020 was $35.7 million. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted retail segment operating income for the three months ended January 31, 2019 was $56.7 million, after excluding a charge related to an increase in our indirect tax audit reserve. Credit Segment Fourth Quarter ResultsCredit revenues were $97.7 million for the three months ended January 31, 2020 compared to $94.1 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019, an increase of $3.6 million or 3.8%. The increase in credit revenue was due to a 1.3% increase in the average outstanding balance of the customer accounts receivable portfolio offset by a decrease in the portfolio yield rate to 21.5% from 21.6% for the comparative period. The total customer accounts receivable portfolio balance was $1.60 billion at January 31, 2020 compared to $1.59 billion at January 31, 2019, an increase of 0.8%. In addition, insurance income contributed to an increase in credit revenue over the comparative period primarily due to an increase in insurance retrospective income.Provision for bad debts increased to $69.3 million for the three months ended January 31, 2020 compared to $55.4 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019, an increase of $13.9 million. The increase was driven by a greater increase in the allowance for bad debts during the three months ended January 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended January 31, 2019, and by a year-over-year increase in net charge-offs of $4.1 million. The increase in the allowance for bad debts for the three months ended January 31, 2020 was primarily driven by a year-over-year increase in the incurred loss rate, first payment default and delinquency rates compared to the three months ended January 31, 2019, partially offset by an increase in customer recovery rate.Credit segment operating loss was $12.3 million for the three months ended January 31, 2020, compared to an operating loss of $0.9 million for the three months ended January 31, 2019."

"Question about reading balance sheet.They have $6million in cash,And $600million in receivables?Am I reading the balance sheet correctly?"
what just happened?
"If no news about any insider buys tomorrow, I think there will be forced margin selling and this may fall below $12."
CONN definitely acting better the last couple of days... Last check showed shorts at 35% of the float. Are they trying to cover before another good quarterly report? Conn’s business plan really isn’t like most all other brick and mortar retailers so the “Amazon factor “ is not the issue it may be with so many other retailers.....
Low float and tons of shorts! Gonna be epic.... I can wait
A boat load of April and July calls were purchased today.
"I called one of the analysts covering CONN's and surprised to have a chat with him frankly. he said its trading half of book value alone and it is a good buy, I asked what his rating was which is buy. Kyle from Opp. they are in a quiet period until earnings so not much news. this is way oversold and will start going up into earnings. the lowered guidance is priced in and at these levels we will see 15 plus before earnings I would think. anyhow, no brainers. there is also the rumors about buyout by Aaron's or someone else which could happen at any point in time and that should be over 20 plus with the growth plans and new markets."
"Wow, steady move upwards for the last two weeks. ER on Tuesday will bring it to high teens."
"Time for a move upwards now!! i think $8.20 will be bottom, lots of great things for CONN this year IMO, great numbers that’s for sure, i think there will be a lot ofloading behind the scenes at these numbers..POP Soon i think :)))"
Terriible stock to own. What in the world iwas doing losing half already while the market is soaring. Almost every day. Very bad move on my part.Fire the Ceo and all the board for not doing what theyre suppose to do.
Did ER leak. Why AH up so much?
so they made $0.75 last quarter... and this quarter was stronger and you are expecting $0.24? and the Christmas quarter only $0.16 with stimulus looming... I like these odds of beating and raising
For sure. This one is in BUY mode for 2020!
Tomorrow should be a good day based on the last three quarters. GLA
Home Products is what the consumer is buying while they are stuck in home and Conn's stores have been open threw out!!
Bought 350
"As I mentioned on Warp Investor CONN was undervalued because of the expectation of negative growth. Let us say that the company manages to simply have no growth (i.e., 0% growth) in earnings for the next 5 years, instead of negative growth. In this case, the fair price-to-earnings ratio should be 7.19, leading to a current fair value of $18.20. If positive growth is expected, well ... the upside could be massive."
"I would like to add more if it keeps going down,i know ive lost half of my investment already.Questions for any knowledgable and honest opinions.Is there any chance that this company will be bankcrupt?"
