"somebody today bought 1037 $15 call options for Oct 15, 2021 at 4.40 or 456K"
Cara hit its 1 year low less than a week before decision on Monday. Up 10% today. There's a possibility Ccxi might follow the pattern.
"I taught my 3 year old son how to invest. He loves cookies, I gave him a choice, half a cookie now, or two cookies, but in the evening. He took two in the evening, I'm so proud of him. When he left, I ate all the cookies, and in the evening I told him that the price had dropped and gave him a quarter of the cookies."
False breakdown and downtrend. Price target 12$ unfortunately. Next support line
Sonebody is buying accumulatin at 16s
Come on guises my gtc sell order still open @$1000
"Guru, Take your Meds"
C’mon CCXI —- make up for all of my financial misadventures this yeat!
anyone listen to the press conference
"Sept. calls are so cheap that if you're the gambling type, I think it's worth it to take a flyer betting on an early FDA approval."
Back to 16 and over Guru hahaha
Hee haw... rode baby ride... CCXI is bound to ho ip from here .$20 billion revenue over next 10 years. Great potential. Harvard and Stanford team
The Magic Number 16 again
"USA approval news should most likely come week of 27th September , EU and Japan approvals will almost be certain in third week of October. Whats the gist to rise so soon? stay below $70 until then"
Early approval and buyout is looming get ready.
Halted!! ?
Early approval and Buyout is coming very soon . Once in a life opportunity.
Rinse and repeat everytime this goes up
"The price DOES NOT MATTER until mid SEPTEMBER . HOLD , SET A SALE TAG for $500 per Share , we can fool the trading algorithms."
This stock should be around 60 now . One of the cheapest biopharma stock now . Buy as much u can this Black Friday deal won’t last longer. Add 500 more .
Send an email to CEO yesterday. He told me that it will be 500$ before October 7
Early approval and buyout coming soon . Mark my words and thanks me later.
Loaded up broke the 16 bullish trend from now until approval
Could be a shake out. People expect too much out of these conference calls . Know this the CEO has 4.2 million shares of this company
No chances for the approval until 2022-23. Some companies get approval only after a decade of extensions
"What an ugly day. I'm still positive, just impatient. "

Something is going on look at that volume today
"No one likes Guru, So they are not willing to contribute to the Go Fund Me page, so he can get the right medication and help."
"There are some really good articles out there to help you in your quest for DD regarding ccxi. Cory Renauer at motley Fool has some good pro and con opinions regarding the merits of this stock. I would be very hesitant to take advice from anyone that is a self titled guru. They tend to be delusional and sociopathic by nature. Stating a SP after the fact and still getting it wrong doesn't make you an oracle , it makes you a moracle."
"ChemoCentryx, Inc., (Nasdaq: CCXI) announced that it filed an amendment to its New Drug Application (NDA) for avacopan for the treatment of Anti-neutrophil Cytoplasmic Autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis, addressing points raised during the FDA Advisory Committee meeting on May 6, 2021. The FDA has indicated that the filing constitutes a major amendment to the NDA and will result in the setting of a new PDUFA goal date of October 7, 2021...READ THAT. 40 or so more days everyone"
wow i thought this would move up slowly NOW i see a violent MOVE...either up or down depending on news. But this is going to be a 100% mover in 1 day...not sure which way but the trading here makes me think this
3 weeks away from FDA decision. Pick your horses people
"Just want to get clarified...CARA which received its FDA approval yesterday, saw a 30% spike, but retracted to its original price.What is the guarantee CCXI will not follow the same path?FYI. I’m bullish and a bag holder of CCXI;"
"Last time, when NDA was refused, it was voted down by 10-8 right?So, we need 2 judges who voted no, to turn around and vote yes.Does anyone know any previous case where FDA changed their decision?"
50 days left until Avacopan is approved (most likely). Don’t sell now might miss the rocket 
watch this go GME prior to decision and reach $100 lol
Closing above 16.50 today?
"High Probability of Approval now , but FDA may take its time ."
"Investors in ChemoCentryx, Inc. CCXI need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 15, 2021 $10.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today."
Above $28 is strongly expected!
C’mon $16.00.
This only has 4 or 5 million shares short and is 100% tute owned now and alot of them averaged down to the 30s they have a ton of cash and the CEO owns over 4 million shares call me crazy but yes I bought more
Missed by a penny 402 million in cash hahaha
Spring coiling ready to blast .
Close below 15.5$ today confirmed
To borrow one of Chevy’s comments “sheesh” this thing’s in the sitter
$15 and climbing still…￼!
This has zero chance of approval. That 0%. The phase 3 trial was a complete mess and there is really no path forward. You are going to lose 60%. Enjoy
Not feeling warm and fuzzy. I have 822 Aug. 17.5 contracts and 200 Aug. 20 contracts. I am blown away with how quiet the pr is and the lack or interest from Biogen.
I love having Gurus money in my pocket
Somebody knows something?
Under 80 this stock is steal get in before you regret. Early approval any moment.
"Volume is low today, I'll take the gains but I hope it holds, being a Friday."
no Volume .. and steady rise .. ?
Bought 600 more today @15.90...
2 day chart double top formed——let’s smash that myth saying sp will go down
"drawing conclusions about the conference, CCXI shares will soon be worth crazy money! why are you selling? I bought back on all the savings!"
"went down from 60 because of FDA approval Speculation . Once FDA approves it should be back to 80+ range . Japan , EUA china affiliate approvals should push it to 170+ shortly after US FDA. The Key is to hold for subsequent approvals which should be almost certain after FDA approval . Expect High Pre Approval Manipulation last two weeks of September."
I have sell order @$1000.
When avacopan could be approved in Japan and EU?
I would love to see CCXI close above $16.00 a share. That is approximately the current Kumo Cloud resistance level. That would mark the arrival into bullish territory for ChemoCentryx. Perhaps by the end of next week? .
CARA just got approval today. CCXI is coming up next in a few weeks
A sad day when the biggest piece of k- era - app in my account (WISH) is the only thing green
Early approval and Buyout is looming buy now thanks me later .
“The stock market is a device to transfer money from the impatient to the patient.” - Warren Buffet
Heavy buying volume today . Get in best life time opportunity. Early approval and buyout is imminent.
they short it down and then gobble up all the shares they can.

When is meeting with fda?Their re-analysis of data ahould be good. BIG potential
"$16 intraday let’s keep that going, ."
35 before early approval and 100 plus after approval. Early Approval any day .
Buy the dip . Early approval and buyout is imminent. Don’t let them steal your shares .
It closed over $16. Woohoo!
what are the forecasts of analysts now ?!
"Confident CEO talk , my new price target week of 27th September is $60 . The Japan and EUA approvals by end October $170 ."
Ccxi is expecting ! Three Avacopan approvals are due in October . Each in multi billion dollar revenue stream . The argument is to hold on to CCXi until the sequence of three approvals .
$25.00 tomorrow morning
"Sorry , had to give myself a thumbs down. I think I may have made Guru cry and I try not to make people sad"
Early approval and buyout is imminent. Don’t miss the chance of your life time.
I'm starting a Go Fund Me page for Guru to get him some help.
"This is going to the moon now, no going back. Buy now or regret later."
"Price target 60, price target 30, price target 170, blah blah blah... Kids don't understand that it will go down sharply"
16 is possible today Guru .. Thanks for selling me your shares for 9.74 when this tanked
Any prediction for the decision by the FDA the next days?
"Green so far today, but volume—-where is it?"
should have bought at the end of the day oh well
This should already be 20 just on the rumor itself but when the approval happens this month this thing is def going back to 70
Monday September 13th investors CEO press conference is at 6 AM EST .
Get your tickets for today’s roller coaster. She’ll go to 16.40 then back to 15.81 and stop at 15.99 today
Finally in the green—can someone please pull the rug out from under me like SAVA ?
Shares are hard to get. Nobody wants to sell. You have to pay to PLAY..LOL

Early approval and very possible buyout looming. Get in train is about to leave.
"I have 2 Biotech/Pharma stocks and both of them are about to explode CCXI is one of them and the other is DARE.

I need to make loss of sava …
If you’re a day trader you need to be using (http://trademarketview.tech). Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers and is extremely well researched. I don’t start trading without reading their email each morning!
Shorts are going strong here! Ttutes are not allowing this to get higher than 16$. Today's close is 15$ most possible
"by Early September at most , not October 7th, I expect to see CCXI $120 and $200 by June 30th 2022. No other stock is so low risk high reward. shorts are here for money backed by greedy hedge fund managers , let them make fake accounts and fake hedge funds sale news."
"Pump it up, you gotta pump it up ."
Come to daddy shorties :) Lambo is mine soon
"Back to 15.5$, then to 14$ and then to 10$. You'd better to listen Guru..."
Guru what town you live in so I can get a well being check on you.
Early approval any day get ready . Get your ticket to moon .
"let's set up an experiment, place a limit order of $ 75 today and tomorrow"

Alot of tutes buying check Fintel
"I'm in below $10, and anticipation of approval was not a factor in my entry. When I decide to sell, approval or no approval won't be a factor in my decision."
$CcXi next
Don't understand how the Dow Nas and the Russell was green and up all day and bios were down that are in the russell ... Makes no sense .. And then they will all come crashing down tomorrow because of Amazon's earnings miss and take bio with it for no reason .. Just can't win.
"if you bought at $10, they want you to think 50% is all youre getting. if you bought here, they want you think its not moving at all.guess what, it'll be $60 within 1 year."
"this stock traded at $50+ for an entire year. normally im weary of a inflated price like that but ive never seen a pump last an entire year before. so all i can conclude is that it really was worth $50. that means that on approval this could easily be $100+.the only thing i dont understand is that if this truly was worth $50, how did a split adcom take it to $10. And with the extension, how are we not at $20 at least by now. I'm guessing its all just tactics to shake weak hands. we are one month out and we should start seeing it rise as it has been."
Conference call was good .. What do people want ? For the CEO to say it's been approved. It's not up to him dummies
Shares transferring from paper hand to brick hands . Get in before Early approval and Buyout soon.
from 15.52 to almost 16 now. Go CCXI. GOOOOO CLVS!!!!!!!!!!!
Gotta love all the institutional buys check Fintel .. Alot of them bought in the 30s and 40s and are averaging down .. Check Fintel it's been updated today
What should be my price target for sell after approval! Just curious what your pt are?
Been lurking on this board- I have a small position but am interested in buying a call or two…anyone else with this strategy?
When it hits $75 bashers still gonna be like wait $3 is around a corner
"back down to $15, i told ya"
Good breaking away from XBIs trend .. Thank God
"C’mon CCXI, let’s close today around $15.00, ."
No Volume .. insignificant rise . 300 percent by October 7th
I’ll be in the frying pan of central PA all day tomorrow so I entered a sell price of $67 Hoping it blows past it
Best stock of 2021 mark this post 15 to hundred better get in before approval
"So, Monday’s price closed atop the present Kumo Cloud. Looking for price to move up to the $16.00 value and stay clear of the Cloud, . ."
"LOVE the strength with this stock, it sells off but recovers. And definitely has found a bottom at $12. This was a $70 stock. I think this strength will continue into Sept and beyond."

I'm curious what caused the spike in volume all of a sudden?
This board has the largest number of dreamers and losers of any I have been on. The FDA will reject avocopan because the phase 3 trial was a disaster. Impossible to determine whether the drug has any effect at all when patients are taking lots of steroids in clear violation of the study protocol. CRL 100%
Wow! A dollar swing within 2 hours!
3k shares long here. One of the best opportunities in this broken market.
morgan stanley and ikarian capital quietly pickup 400k shares each.
"If you look at the 1-month chart, CCXI has completed a nice cup of the cup-and-handle formation.If it stabilizes in he 16.50 range for a few days, this may break out to the upside.looks like buyers are coming in as well, given the timing of the potential FDA decision."
Will we see 16$ again? Doubt it
Hold it for next 3 weeks .... easy money.
Down to 15.00$ today
"Going below 16$ again. You'd better listen to me, kids)"
bought much higher... bought some lower... bought again today. rinse and repeat.
its day will come
"Why am I invested Long in CCXI? Firstly, I got in @ $10.98 a share, after that ridiculous double beat down in May 2021. Some may have acquired their shares @ $9.43 on the June 2021 bottom? So, What happens when that massively thick red “bearish” Kumo Cloud is finally broken? (It appears we’re on track for that around August 26, 2021, a Kumo twist). Yes, the future K Cloud is projecting green/bright “bullish”. At that time of the red K Cloud breakout, price tends to have great momentum to the upside, . Watch that future K Cloud it must stay green for price momentum to the upside to occur. I’m HOLDING my shares and watching, we’re getting there, . Anyone else use the Ichimoku Cloud trading system?"
sold - couldn't risk the 50% profits before earnings (which we know will be pretty bad) definitely getting back in after the earnings report have subsided and before the FDA approval!! Good luck all!
BT——-are you selling?
"Hello guys.. Today the results are announced after the closure. We may see fluctuation in the situation and in the event of going down, an opportunity to buy at attractive prices"

"approval, 80 min, denied 7, simple. I think it will be approved. don't put in more than u can afford to lose and stop worrying about it. I'm in at 11 so considering 4 loss but thinking 69 gain."
"Hello CCXI Bashers,If you do not think CCXI’s Avacopan will be approved, silently get out of this forum.The very reason you stay here and keep bashing/ trying to create panic among others clearly shows you want to be benefited by the dropping price. Your act, in fact adds confidence on CCXI tgss as t it will be approved. So we are staying strong. Thank you."
Has the new data submitted already or yet to be submitted? Any information
Options looking good we going up boys and girls
I hope this doesn't get approved early. I want the run up to Oct 7th
Hope some of you guys have seen the fireside chat. Was really good and adressed a lot of important questions. Feels good to have a nice position here.
One way or the other latest by 7th of October we will find out.I'm optimistic
"ChemoCentryx Inc. CCXI reported a second-quarter 2021 loss of 56 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 55 cents. The company had reported earnings of 29 cents per share in the year-ago period.It recorded revenues of $1.8 million, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5 million and decreased from $49.4 million in the year-ago quarter.General and administrative expenses were $19.7 million, up from $10.3 million in the year-ago quarter.Less"
"No worries  . Next four weeks ccXi could remain within 12 to 17 range . Anytime approval news comes $100 and the $180 PT by June 2022 . Not just the USA minimal 5 billion $ revenue but Japan , China , EU royalties too :"
Do bears not understand how rare it is for the FDA to incorporate major amendments ? 80% of NDA’s filed in the last 40 to 50 years have been rejected. However when an NDA gets a 90 day extension 85% of companies receive approval. Out of the last 21 companies that received an extension 18 were granted approval… think about that for a second… the AdCom was also in favor of approval and the CEO sent in data that the panelist were confused about… this is a no brainer and I’m glad we’re sitting under the radar ATM.
Futures are sheet again
October has always been a fantastic biotechnology month for me. this is going to 80 maybe 120. stoked.
PT $80 on 30th September 2021 before FDA news !
Just put a sale tag of $500 and wait . Or The hedge funds will make money on your shares
"Approval or no approval; BO or not, CCXI will go above $28 at least. It has already turned the corner. Now it is the last round, strong hands will try to accumulate at a cheaper price before they let it jump."
Who didn't listen to me and didn't sell today - enjoy your losses.
"I am a blind squirrel, will I find an acorn here—-?"
"I wrote to the investment department, they said that on the 20th there will be a review of avacopan at the European Medicines Agency !!! if approved it will be additional pressure on the FDA !!!"
How many times is Zach's going to post ccxi had a quarterly loss .. we know we know
Held up nicely today boys .
Ccxi may drop back to $12 in next 30 days . I don’t want to risk missing the upside . 12x 90 percent chance now .
Any technical analysts here? Is this the flag to the next leg up?
Nice close. If tomorrow would be green as well we can go up
"Tickets, get your tickets hereROLLER COASTER RIDE"
Back to 14$ today. Don't listen to reddit kids here. I am the only GURU on this board. Short it
Citi group increased its position by 188 percent . Morgan Stanley by 388 percent . The institutional buying may probability be increased after the first and second approvals . Wait till the Third approval by end October
"ChemoCentryx Reports Second Quarter 2021 Financial Results and Recent HighlightsBY GlobeNewswire— 4:05 PM ET 08/09/2021-- Company filed an amendment to its NDA for avacopan in the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis; PDUFA goal date extended to October 7, 2021---- Applications for regulatory approval of avacopan in ANCA-associated vasculitis also under review by the European Medicines Agency and the Japan Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency ---- Clinical development launched of potential next generation checkpoint inhibitor CCX559, featured in abstract at Annual Meeting of American Association for Cancer Research ---- $402.6 million in cash and investments at June 30, 2021 ---- Conference call today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time --SAN CARLOS, Calif., Aug. 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ChemoCentryx, Inc. ( CCXI), , today announced financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2021 and provided an overview of recent corporate highlights.""We appreciate the recent opportunity to provide the U.S. FDA with supplementary data and analyses to our NDA, which the Agency deemed to be a major amendment,” said Thomas J. Schall, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of ChemoCentryx ( CCXI). “We are looking forward to decisions later this year on regulatory submissions for avacopan in ANCA-associated vasculitis in the U.S. and abroad. Meanwhile, we are further developing our pipeline, as evidenced by the launch of a Phase I study with our novel orally-administered immune checkpoint inhibitor CCX559, which we hope will be part of a new era of precise cancer treatment. Further clinical work in other high need areas, such as the initiation of a Phase III trial of avacopan in patients with severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa, constitute important next steps in building the CCXI pipeline to benefit patients most in need.”Key Second Quarter 2021 Highlights and Recent DevelopmentsIn July the Company announced the filing of additional information to its NDA submission, which the FDA deemed to be a major amendment. The PDUFA review period for avacopan in the treatment of ANCA-associated vasculitis was extended, with a new PDUFA goal date of October 7, 2021. The Company’s filing followed the May 6 meeting of the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee.In Q2, the Company initiated Phase I clinical development of CCX559, a novel, orally-administered, PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor. CCX559 was featured in an abstract at the April 2021 Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR). As a next generation therapy, small molecule inhibitors may have advantageous properties compared to approved monoclonal antibodies, such as better penetration into solid tumors, reduced immunogenicity, lack of Fc-mediated side effects, and the convenience of oral administration.The Company plans to meet with the FDA to discuss the Phase III development of avacopan in patients with Hurley Stage 3 (severe) Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) with the goal of initiating a Phase III clinical trial in those patients. In the Phase II AURORA trial, avacopan demonstrated a statistically significant higher response than placebo in a pre-specified subgroup of Hurley Stage 3 patients, which will further guide clinical development.The Company plans to initiate clinical development of avacopan in patients with lupus nephritis in the first half of 2022.The Company also plans to schedule a meeting later this year with the FDA to discuss evidence of clinical benefit from the ACCOLADE trial of avacopan in the very rare disorder C3 Glomerulopathy (C3G). There are no FDA approved therapies for this rare disorder. In the ACCOLADE trial, avacopan demonstrated statistically significant improvement in renal function as measured by pre-specified secondary endpoints of eGFR and also improvement in the pre-specified endpoint of C3G Histology Index (HI) Disease Chronicity score, compared to placebo over 26 weeks of blinded treatment, while not attaining a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of the C3G HI Disease Activity Score. Avacopan was well tolerated in C3G patients.The Company ended Q2 with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $402.6 million at June 30, 2021.Second Quarter 2021 Financial ResultsRevenue was $1.8 million for the second quarter of 2021, compared to $49.4 million for the same period in 2020. The decrease in revenue from 2020 to 2021 was principally attributable to the acceleration of revenue recognition in 2020 associated with the decision to discontinue development of CCX140 in Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).Research and development expenses were $20.9 million for the second quarter of 2021, compared to $18.8 million for the same period in 2020. The increase from 2020 to 2021 was primarily attributable to the manufacture of commercial drug supply in anticipation of the launch of avacopan for the treatment of ANCA v"
Jeez—you’d think the number 16 was magical or something—-as ma would say “either sit or get off the pot”
Not the closing I was hoping for But at least it's higher than it was this morning. Here's hoping for a continued climb throughout the week.
how was the conference? have main points?
premarket 16 $
CCXI to brush 100$ in November pending approval. Woot.
What happens to the share if the company is bought out by another company after approval?
CCXI has already pierced the $16.00 value intraday. Maybe today we close above $16? Slow and steady but moving into bullish territory IMHO.
"This is already bottom fromPreFFA meeting without additional data. If approval came through, this is going 3 digits then?"
Today closing was awesome very heavy buying pressure. Something big coming soon .
Guru muted
Early approval and buyout is imminent.
Listen to the conference call. Wonder what Schall would tell besides they started spending $ in anticipation of production and sale of avacopan
Ccxi is onky hitting $20 next week . Of course in case of one of the three approvals . I would be absolutely wrong !
"Hope everyone already saw sell order 100 shares @$199,999.99 . That’s the spirit guys"
"Even if you plan to sell on first USA approval , for now Just Put in a price tag of $ 500 and wait till week of 27th Sep. The Shorts are making money because they can borrow your shares Cheap!"
pLZ just put in a sale price of $500 or more and just wait till sept 17 . FDA has been giving its approval two weeks prior and that’s when big Pharma is expected to do a hostile buyout of a 10 billion annual expected revenue company .
Price point is 120+.When European news comes around it could come back to 60+ before FDA approval. 30+ potential target is next week ITSELF WHEN CCXI gives presentation at the health growth conference; when they give some hint on good data set to share it with FDA
Sell order gtc @$1000.00
CcXi takes off after third week of September only but when it does …
Holding my core and swing trading .. I can play the game too
By Friday this should be in 17s and gradually be in 20s before October 7th. Anyone else think so?
My prayer for everyone.. sell gtc @$1000
"Future Kumo Cloud continues to get thinner. Just really hoping today’s candlestick at the trend top is not a hanging man? Let’s just stick to buying pressure, ."
Excellent bearish pattern. Google 'hanging man'. Disbalance between sellers and buyers. Tuts don't want to see price higher than 16$. Short until it's too late

October 7th is the date of FDA announcement but i think there will be a run up before that date starting SOON.

So many institutions buying and yet we are only at this price i don't get it
why is there no pre market?

CCXI are you with the XBI or not with the XBI your as bad as Guru
news can come at any time. i would hate for this to open at $20 one day and be priced out. thats why im holding. period.
"My portfolio is 99% of this company, great Diversification!)"
"Really a good sign, up & up without too much volumes. If trade more, the price will be much higher."
"I still have a long position here with CCXI. What’s with that darn $16 value? For ten straight trading days we’ve skimmed across the top of the Kumo Cloud, C’mon now, as Freddie Mercury would sing, I got to break free”, ."
35 more days until Oct 7th if we dont get approval early.
Already even for the day with that buy at 15.50 .. Time to take a little nap 
C’mon—— V-shaped recovery!
"Amusing video. Obviously completely not related to the sound assessment of the Company, its prospects and related financial footings. Are you sure Guru that you are on the right forum; my children have many more platforms that are more related to your posts that you should investigate. But, again, kudos mate, great video. Amazing how much time you must have to find these type of things. Hats off."
$CCXI is next !
"slow cash burn, lots of goodies. adding 2k more tmrw"
Bought 400 more today at $14.60
"Earnings , few spikes and drops don’t matter . September third week $180 PT , with three approvals"
"Great company, but we have one major problem-i own this stock. If i sell, you guys almost guaranteed to get approval and triple digit stock price"
"Next week will be fun, I admit I bought this a little early and have been a tiny bit under water, average cost is $16.20 but I know this will blow past that and then I will be making money. Good luck to everyone and have a great weekend."
"You're rightly not selling before end September. Please set a Sale price of $ 500 per share for now. short squeeze , hostile buy over or any approval may make us all very lucky."
CCXI is a great lesson in patience for new investors. I read this in a fortune cookie this morning

"Don’t listen to “Guru”, but instead look at the Kumo Cloud. Yes, the second day above the K Cloud, . The T/K Crossover has more separation from yesterday, . I’m waiting for the “future Kumo Cloud” to “Twist” from red to green. No yet, however, that red Cloud is getting thinner, . I think we see the Kumo Twist in a few more trading days, ! . Shorts are not in control."
Nice of Guru to share clip of his dad on the day of his birth.Now I understand his sadness
Early approval and buyout soon. Don’t miss the opportunity of life time .
Buy every dip Early approval and buyout right on the corner.
Shorters have an obligation to buy before end of next week . If u have to sell set a price of $500 or the highest allowed by your broker .
