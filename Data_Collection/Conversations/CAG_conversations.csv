Nice lead up into ex dividend......NOT.
"How much is paltry growth worth. A nice dividend. Have the insiders been selling or buying in bulk.----""However, the Company has recently experienced elevated cost of goods sold inflation, the rate of which increased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. While the Company has taken, and expects to continue taking, appropriate actions to pull on multiple margin levers to counteract the impact of this inflation, including pricing and cost savings actions, the timing of the margin lever benefits is expected to be weighted towards the second half and therefore not expected to fully offset the input cost headwinds within fiscal 2022. This timing lag is expected to most acute in the first quarter. Therefore, the first quarter is expected to be the lowest margin quarter of the fiscal year."""
Good volume and upside momentum. Seems to be growing interest. Could be some nice upgrades after these guys load up.
"@CAG: EX-DIV: 10-29-2021, RECORD DATE: 11-01-2021: quarterly dividend: $.3125Today is the last chance to buy CAG in order to get a dividend payment of $.3125."
Picked up some shares at 32.22
Going to start a position. Like the lows here.
"JP Morgan downgrade before ex dividend. Hmm I guess they will now load up. 10/29/21 Dividend, Bought more as Wall Street is all smoke and mirrors."
No ex. Dividend drop. This is a very good sign of stability.
This stock would be severely undervalued if it were trading at 50.
CAG has good history of upside surprise. Dividend secure.

"started position here at these rockbottom prices.Utterly ridiculous market.Dividend at this point is too fat to pass up.Once the wall street crime syndicate that keeps their coffers full by colluding to short names like this finally covers and rotates into a new group of ""short favorites"" this will rocket 20% in a couple of weeks.Mark my words and check back in a few months for verification."
