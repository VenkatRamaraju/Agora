I just found this company... will have to watch it... would prefer to buy in the $16. range but that may not happen...
Entry trade placed for $16.03.
BRX is up 5.01% to 14.88
Some analysts are citing high debt and low income levels that could make this company headed for a bankruptcy. But today they just posted a $400 million buy back and AMT filing with the SEC. Who to believe?
"With the pop today, it’s time to close my position on this stock for the following reasons:1. Haven’t heard anything new on re-instating the dividend.2. Even with a vaccine helping on-site retail, it will be at least a couple of quarters before ERS improves.3. E-commerce will still be the long term trend putting on-going pressure on commercial real estate and leasing rates.4. It will likely take years, if ever, for the stock price to re-visit pre-Covid level."
"Did they cut their dividend, Yahoo shows no dividend."
"Hey There~ Question if I may~ What am I missing on BRX (ie why is the stock holding instead of falling from $23/share) ?? 1.number of properties & available lease-able spaces had steadily decline since CYQ12017, thus along with FFO2.12m rolling FFO at Q221 shows a wooping 25% decline vs. 12m rolling FFO at Q417, not to mention lease% had yet to reach 80% (pre-COVID level)Despite the negative data-points, the stock at 4-yr high .......is there a growth story behind this? coz the downsizing of investment properties does not reflect any kind of growth opp....XDThanks for your help on this in advance~"
"Lest anyone forget, this company is huge, with most properties anchored by Kroger, Publix, Wal-Mart, TJ Maxx & Homegoods, etc."
