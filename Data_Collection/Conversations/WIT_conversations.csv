This stock was just recommended a BUY from Paul Mampilly.
"Any clues as to what's driving this stock? ??On June 20, it was $4.95 a share. Now on Aug 2, it's $6.35 per shares. In the last 6 weeks (almost 6 wks.) WIT has had only 6/7 down days. Clearly, something is driving this stock. I notice there's a lot of press releases about WIT partnering with some of the heavy hitters in the mainframe IT space. Maybe that's it'. Also, about 3 months ago, I heard the government would be spending a lot of capital upgrading their antiquated IT systems. Maybe that's it. Who know? Any help would be appreciated, but clearly WIT is moving up."
