This company is owned by some big time players. Im waiting for someone to come in and swoop them up but the question is who would be a good fit looking for this mega radio entertainment conglomerate. Its built quite an empire and recently got approval to aquire 50% of Iheart radio. Malone did the same thing with them(bought it out after bankruptcy) as he did with Sirius. Paid pennies on the dollar. This will have to be a big payday someday when the right suitor comes along.
I would love to see a takeover(Verizon according to Barrons) of LXSMA...huge upside plus you would start to get a nice dividend...this happened a few years ago when I held DTV for years only to be taken over by ATT

Even after Barronâs pump of the trackers trading at a 40% discount to Siri, it seems an elusive goal to close that gap.

"Malone and Maffei have been shrewd investors in media and cable TV properties like Charter Communications (CHTR) and Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI) over the past 15 years. Neither shrinks from using leverage to magnify returns.Malone exercises control or near-control of nearly all of the Liberty companies through supervoting class B shares. This includes flagship Liberty Media and its three tracking stocks: Liberty Braves (BATRA), Liberty SiriusXM Holdings (LSXMA), and Formula One Group (FWONA), as well as Liberty Broadband (LBRDK)."

When do ya'll think Malone going to execute the spinoff by merging Liberty Sirius XM Radio with Liberty Sirius XM Radio Holdings? Nobody wants to talk about it on Sirius XM Radio Holdings message board but it fixes the share outstanding problems because the 3 investors share Class structure will take care of Malone's 3.2 billion shares by putting them into Class B shares then doing 10 for reverse stock split only on his Class B shares bc he will be receiving 10 for 1 voting Rights for each share allowing Malone to keep control of company.

"Just curious as to how you guys view John Mephistopheles Maloneâs SiriusXM share price suppression program? Iâve spent months and months highlighting the blatant and manipulative actions employed to keep SiriusXM from trading higher so that they can get the cheapest possible shares on the buybacksï¿¼, which, in turn, gives Mephistopheles and Liberty greater and greater ownership for free.This highly manipulative practice is completely unethical and lacks integrity at a minimum. Any notion of fiduciary duty to the common retail minority shareholder is nonexistent."

ANYONE have thoughts about this post from the SIRI board this AM ?Duke: A Change In Strategy--Part 3SIRI purchased about 70M shares in the quarter at a cost of $6.10-$6.20. Do the math and they spent about $425M which equates to the company's FCF. In other words they are using you money to fund the BB. The dividend that Liberty receives is being used to BB the outstanding float of LSXMA and here is the key Maffei suggested that SIRI's FCF could be used to BB the shares of LSXMA which I considered crazy at the time.It would appear that Liberty is on a dual track of freezing out both SIRI shareholders and LSXMA holders or at least reducing the outstanding float of LSXMA.The interesting thing is that the convertible bonds don't mature until June 2023 so it looks like Liberty could strip mine both issues until then and then do a buy out. You have lived through almost four years with a stock that has gone nowhere.Team Malone is betting that you won't be able to stomach another two years of this pain. Don't let them beat you. Hang on to the last day.I have already booked three more vacations this year and can't afford to lose this gig so it would be nice if you pledged your undying allegiance to the stock.

He will never be able to force the sale of LSXMA stock. LSXMA should be trading at a higher premium to Sirius!!!!!!
