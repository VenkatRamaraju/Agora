Has everyone read the transcript of the July earnings call? Are you all delusional? They have been issuing equity every chance they get. Expect significantly more equity issuance by October 2021.
It ended at 17.17 lol is that a sign
"Jesus, this one is testing my patience"
This is when you start pulling chips of the table
"ADDING TO MATT'S NUMBERS BELOW: (1 ton to charge 50 Teslas) 500,000 Teslas running around probably driving 300 miles a day. Multiply that times Matt's numbers.. AND THAT IS A LOT OF COAL NEEDED JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY. And that is just for Tesla cars! Albeit.. there are some other ""fuels"" involved..."
So last month sold about 12.5mm shares thru B Riley @ $15.55. Have another 12.5mm to sell from time to time thru B Riley if i read the Filings correctly....In addition Elliot sold a little under 2mmshares and still has about 27mmshares..I think i get the pause in the rally..
Support at $12
Coal Price is still at $177. Why the major dip?
People we can’t make targets like “going to $20” it’s probably going much much higher. The world is out of coal and is desperate for it.
"I’d be nervous with $CLOV if I hadn’t gone through this before, especially $BTU 9 months ago. So much FUD & negativity 9 months ago. Then *very suddenly* all the FUD stopped and the stock went from $1 to $20 now. I have faith in $CLOV. FUD won’t deter us. Only makes us stronger."
"My goodness, I should not have sold those calls at $5 me thinks. Would someone just exercise on me and put me out of my misery please?"
This is bad for the environment. Big changes coming I got out last week I might even start shorting this one.
^^^BTU going over 20-00
OIL STARTING TO DROP HARD OVER LOWER DEMAND DUE TO NEW DELTA COVID STRAIN EXPLODING IN U S AND AROUND THE WORLD-MARKETS STARTING DROP NOW TOO-BIG GUY GOING TO CASH SO CAN BE READY TO PROFIT OFF DROP-ONLY WAY BIG GUY CAN MAKE THE BIG BUCKS OFF RETAIL TRADERS WHO ARE STILL BUYING!!
as oil and natural gas go up coal goes up right along with it in fact maybe it’s even the better of the two that’s why I’m in all three new 52 week eyes will be coming energy is going to be a big problem going forward all this green new world energy Uses tons of energy to get these metals out of the ground to make the New World green there is no easy answer you either pay me later now or pay me later
when the initial reaction in the stock was negative to a good earnings result I just loaded up some more shrs at $9.79 this am. Glad to see it rebound quickly but honestly you need to buy on these pullbacks.
Seriously? This is an easy $40 stock. Energy shortages aren't going away. Be patient.
BTU IS NOW ABLE TO SELL COAL ON SPOT MARKET TO NEW CUSTOMERS IN BOTH ASIA AND EUROPE WHO ARE DESPERATE FOR COAL FOR POWER GENERATION- SAW LAST NIGHT THAT CHINA WAS HAVING TO CUT BACK POWER TO SOME FACTORIES TO TRY AND MANAGE ROLLING BLACKOUTS-SAID CHINA DOES NOT LIKE TO PAY DOUBLE FOR COAL BUT THERE IS NO OTHER SOLUTION UNTIL AT LEAST 2022!!
only pure play coal company worth owning is ARLP.
Why is BTU getting #$%$ on this month? It makes zero sense. I follow this company closely and have been invested for a year. I thought it would average back up this week but what the hell? Is this manipulation or what lol
just wait until the coal shortage in China story hits the evening news and the average Joe starts to realize that there is a crisis. Rolling blackouts in across China currently in order to conserve coal for the winter are a sign of what is coming. Price of coal will skyrocket once panic sets in.
"It's either buy AMC or buy BTU. Not sure which, BTU is good longterm but AMC could be good short term."
The dumb sold today and the smart bought.
"FOR HEAVENS SAKE: This is one of the craziest acting stocks I have ever seen!!! With the ever-increasing need for coal far into the distance.. and the massive increase in coal price.. there is really no logical reason for BTU stock to not be at least back to where it was back in the ""GOOD DAYS"". Period. Just sayin'..."
^^^Looking like 24-00 on ^BTU^
ASIA IS SAID TO BE GENERALLY OUTBIDDING EUROPE IN BUYING COAL AND NAT GAS ON SPOT MARKETS AS THEY TRY TO BUILD UP THEIR SUPPLY BEFORE COLD WEATHER HITS AND BLACKOUTS START AS SUPPLY RUNS OUT
This happens every month before options expiration. Look at the price on Aug 20 (last options expiration) and see what happened shortly after. This is a buy the dip opportunity.
the company can't afford to pay s debt? why do they issue new stock?
35% correction from its high.
Enjoy the ride folks you deserve it.
Coal now $ 225
gonna turn green soon. about time.

INDIA SAY TO HAVE ONLY A FEW DAYS SUPPLY OF COAL FOR POWER GENERATION!!
Anyone in this board that owned BTU when they went bankrupt? I lost it all and I can’t believe they issued new shares and I lost all mine.How is that even closely fair.
HOPING 15.50 holds as bottom
"Oil, gas, and coal are looking VERY good now. $1.2 Trillion Infrastructure vote CANCELED. The green energy sector is dead... for now. $20+ before the end of the year."
This is a good entry point
Why is there never any news from BTU headquarters? Do they even have a PR section? PS The worse things get in America (and the world) the MORE coal is needed.
Peabody Energy (NYSE:BTU): Q2 GAAP EPS of -$0.26 beats by $0.36.Revenue of $723.4M (+15.4% Y/Y) beats by $35.77M.Adjusted expects EBITDA of $122.1M vs. consensus of $73.4M.
buying more at this price. $12.86
call option 15dollar of elliot prevent stock from soaring?
What are your price targets for this stock?
AMC started the year with same Market Cap ($2Bil) that BTU has now. Now AMC's is $20Bik. Can't wait for BTU to follow that trend.
"BTU just hit $2Billion Market Cap. LOGIC portrays that Peabody deserves at least as much M.C. as ""businesses"" that find you places to sleep at night. One of which is over $50Billion M.C. Just sayin'..."
Has to go over 20 for me to add to my options. I hold so many.
^^^King Koal
Why is BTU down from its peak? If you look at other coal stocks like ARCH and ARLP they're still at their peaks. Thanks for your informed opinions.
This is a winner.
oh my goodness.... it's pulling back. ABOUT TIME. 5-months later......
Everybody is upgrading price targets. This means that an equity offering is being proposed and the bankers are lining up for co-lead manager roles. Expect a significant refunding of all debt by 1Q 2022.
"free money, yahoo is nothing but paid bashers, again last fall i was in $btu at .97 they said the same stuff delisting, bankrupt, stock went to $19 in 6 months, $rig was the same thing .66 to $5, they are always 100 pct of the time proven wrong, buying at 1.65 will make you rich, possible 100x if you hold as they grow and go debt free, stock is trading at a .25 price to sales, average for the tech industry is over 5, docu is at 30 and we have the same product, company does over a billion in revenue, people are desperate for cheap shares and short interest was 139 pct on 9/15 check ameritrade website not the fraud sites being paid to conceal the data, these people saying 7 million short shares are delusional, they shorted 100 mil and half are naked shorts, this could be the next gme, be warned"
MY OPTIONS EXPIRED SO BTU WILL PROBABLY POP NOW SINCE COAL AT RECORD HIGHS AND A SHORTAGE OF COAL AROUND WORLD!!
Are shorts covering?
HOPE ALL THOSE NEW SHARES GET SOLD INTO MARKET FAST
This thing is NEVER going to stop. We're going on 5-months of green
I got in this and I just found out that NASA can't make coal-poweredc space vehicles. Well....they can but they are really heavy and you have to get to your sruising speed before leaving the atmosphere because coal doesn't burn well in space. I feel I was misled by the exuberance of you shareholders and did not get full-dislosure. I plan a lawsuit!
I  BTU!!! These dips and peaks are wonderful.
Spot coal at $267 now...

$30 share price by end of winter. Look at coal usage and coal prices going higher.. NG prices going through the roof will only make increase the demand for coal
I really regret selling BTU for solar this year. It was one of my biggest mistakes in stocks.
A trader's stock
Ole man Peabody is taking a rest after the recent rapid rise. Expect another move up next week.
"Coal $21 up to $ 267, wow"
Dang so is BTU worth $30.00 again.
"HA, ... Ha ha ha. Wow. Coal prices at $206! Right now.Nice! Peabody go..BTU"
Consol performing much better..Elliot may be weighing on Btu..
"had $rig at .66 people said bankruptcy went to 5, had $btu at .97 said bankrupt went to 19, the yahoo bears have been consitently wrong 100pct of the time on every stock ive ever bought, and i've never been more sure about a stock than i am xela, Under $5 its nothing but free money, you might have to wait till earnings but this stock will explode sometime soon, already did it twice in 2021 before all the amazing news we been getting, debt being paid down is all institutions were waiting for"
coal price 180 to 185
could of sold at 11 holding thru earnings good luck everyone!
"PRICE TO SALES - great reference TSLA - That needs BTU coal for ""fuel"": 22.00 BTU - 0.57"
What is moving this stock????
if you’re into energy and Coal check out MORIEN resource company I’ve already made pretty much money here the symbol APMCF do your own research I’m already up 50% and I traded a lot of different stocks but I like this one this could be a grand slam and I personally think it is
This one ain’t acting right
Dilution coming

maybe I got lucky today I bought a few thousand shares down at 17.55 always feels good when you can buy a selloff in an uptrend stock.
"Electricity supply issues in China, problems with Russian natural gas pipeline... Let's see how high this stock can go..."
Xi ping says no more pay market price for coal.
Coal is more valuable than the dollar IMHO. The world will always need coal.. at least for the next 50 years+. IMHO
News claim dow down due to investor fear resurge on C19. This is all a lie for hedge to get our shares low. Hold like AMC and buy more.
will crash hard half bk company
U.S. power plants are on track to burn 23% more coal this year. BTU up 1300% from election day. Thanks Joe.
not only is China having Coal issues now India is having the same problem most of their electricity in India is produced by coal two of the biggest countries in the world use coal this problem is not going away oh I know is BTU is a great trading stock at least it is for me.
"The more manipulation that occurs, the more violent the upswing will be. When I was in $BTU (Peabody Energy) 9 months ago, FUD article after article came out as the price was tanking. ATL was $0.80. Then FUD suddenly stopped. Share price 9 months later is $20. Believe, $CLOV."
Is today the day that we finally close above $12?
"Nothing has changed, coal continues to sit at multiple decade highs. Be patient, pullbacks are healthy. Looking at at least $35-40 before this cycle ends."
"Coal at a high,for last several years and going higher, this could set records high along with the rest of energy sector. Once in a lifetime opportunity to see a super cycle. I kick myself for not buying more when it set a record low last summer."

"Cashed out half of my holdings (up >100%), still optimistic."
"Earnings report will be about 10 AM Thur, eastern time. The thing to look for is increase in Sales.. more than Earnings. Although increase in earnings would be a bonus. There are a lot of strange expenses that might cut into profits (that maybe won't show up)."
Coal jumped up today $15.75 to $234.
hey....fly btu to the moon!!!!
Coal demand soaring. Supply is tight. Prices are at 15 year highs. This is still a bargain IMO.

BTU HEADED HIGHER AS NAT GAS GOES HIGHER AGAIN TODAY
Why is this 3x higher than June? I don't get it. Are we back to coal instead of clean energy?
I haven't seen Tanner on this message board for a while.
"Sale on BTU, headed to $30 by end of 2021. Don't fight fundamentals."
Bought some calls on the dip yesterday let’s get this money good luck to you all!
is this a buy here?..or is 10.75 better entry?
"Quarterly earnings, July 29. If investors like what they hear, resistance is $18.73."

^^^Clean Coal is highly demanded^^^
Coal mining company Peabody Energy $BTU is up 290% this year and this green energy etf is down 20% this year. Which direction are we heading?
China allegedly no longer funding coal power plants in foreign countries should be good news for BTU. More business for BTU plants!
14 hopefully support
IF ANY LOGIC PREVAILS: coal is a great hedge against the craziness permeating myriad govt actions these days. Why? The more they spend (which they refuse to stop doing) THE MORE AMERICA NEEDS COAL. Just sayin'...
Buy the dip
Big holder unloading. Only coal stock down
nice day next stop 20
"Speed bump, selling a few $19 Sep puts, hoping to buy more in the low $17."
In Q2 was their average selling price for coal $37???
BLAME ME I swear I jumped in at $17.30.. 15 minutes ago. Then: BAM!! But it is what it is.
Why this huge drop
money is starting to leave the general stock market and it’s going into energy of all forms you’re going to see billions upon billions of dollars come this way hedge funds money managers pension funds and retail investors the little guy we all want a piece of it because we all know green energy is fairy dust everything else in the market is bloated like a fat pig and the red headed step child energy is now going to turn in to The hottest guy on the planet.

Let us all take a minute to thank the diabolical stupidity of the UK government. Massive energy crisis because they insist on putting all their energy companies out of business...now they have to open coal plants to facilitate the electricity. Picked up a ton of bonds at 44. They broke 90 yesterday. Sweet sweet cash born of abject stupidity.
Ole man Peabody really pulled a fast one here. No doubt this is going higher.
I sold half of what I had close to the highs of the day and I bought everything back right now no matter how you look at it coal is an issue that is not going away I think we will close back up at the highs of the day there is more and more people every day coming into energy is the most under invested segment of the stock market billions and billions of dollars will be rolling out of the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 over the course of the next several years inflation it’s not transitory at all it’s actually going to continue to keep going up raid hikes will never zero interest rate policy is the name of the game and energy is the name of my game.
"Looks like Yahoo has taken down their news section about BTU. Interesting. This is shapping up to be the stock of the year and nobody wants to talk about it because it's nasty ol coal! Libs be crying, ""global warming! Whaaaaaaaaaaaa-waaaaaaaaaaaa (sniff sniff) waaaaaaaa"""
I trade in and out of all the energy stocks from natural gas uranium oil and coal natural gas and oil are running nicely today and uranium and coal or down I really think there’s a big pool of people that rotate in and out like I do but I think that is going to change as people begin to realize transitory inflation really means it’s here and it’s going up and everything is derived off of energy and there’s no way around it I’ll dips are buying opportunities as natural gas and oil go up in price coal follow the world switches in and out of whatever fuel is the cheapest that’s what most utilities do in the United States and I’m sure it’s like that in the world but the bottom line is cheap energy is over no matter how much you hate coal it is an integral part of our energy demand.
^^^15-00 Close for ^BTU^?
Back in my favorite Stock -BTU!!! Ready for next ride!!!
Whose buying this dip?
"Once this stock takes off, we’ll never again see these prices. When we look back, it’ll seem beyond obvious that we should have bought more at these prices. I remember people flocking away from $BTU less than 9 months ago, when it was $0.80; now it’s closing in on $14. $CLOV to $100."
"All of stocks related to coal mining is going down. (arch, metc, arlp) . There is no future for coal stock."
180 coal price now
"Nice sales pitch. 40% of average volume in 1st 1'30"" of trading. Low volume?"
2 months ago Institutions held 90% of BTU stock. Now it is down to 60%. WHO'S THE DUMMY? PS Coal is needed now just about more than ever before. Badly.
Get your Jengq options (shares) while they are cheap. I feel they have the opportunity to run like BTU did. Similar to others I sold my BTU shares too early (from $1 to $4). GLTA
Why down ? It should be up 
The more dire and dangerous the America/world situation... the more that coal is needed. Badly!
"This is a short term play, 1-3 years. Everyone jumped the gun on clean energy but it is the future not today. You cannot close one power plant without building a new one of some kind. That is what everyone, especially the EU did. Literally close plants. The effect was muted only because of COVID cut consumption from closed industry. Now industry is back.Sure they should be starting clean power plants. But they are not built yet. The only thing available is coal and gas generators. So no choice but to restart them. In five years shut them again but only after clean energy is on line.So being the only game in town, coal is asking whatever they want and are getting it.Tldr nat gas and coal thru this winter then move to clean energy starting mid late next year."
NAT GAS MOVING HIGHER TODAY PUSHING COAL STOCKS HIGHER
It looks attractive again after this correction. Heading for for $22-25.
This company cant pay its debts.
Load up !!
"Yes there is a climbing energy demand right now, but they can’t start charging customers more because of this. It’s going to take time for this stock to catch up from all the drama last month in the market. I am going long on this and I will see you all in November when earnings are out."
These bears are being brutal!
"Stay the course, this is going much higher. Less than an hour in and we are almost at the avg volume for the day! This is going to min $30-40 over the next 6 months."

B.Riley Securities raised the target price from $15 to $22.My apologies if this was reported here already.This company is not ranked high on ESG score. That makes me sad.

BTU better straighten up. Just the way she likes it.
It's going over 17-18 today.

BTU is tied to the oil and natural gas Price as they will continue to go up so will be Tu the fuel switching is actually on a daily basis big utilities have a mixture and so does the world Real problem is energy is no longer going to be cheap when companies like this have sell offs they are the ones to buy there’s a huge rotation in oil and natural gas uranium and Coal and more and more people are beginning to figure out the day of cheap energy is over and that money is coming into the sectors when you look at the overall market trillions of dollars have been made but they’re going to be looking for a new home and it’s the energy sector back to the future here come the 70s.

I am also kicking myself why I invested in solar since coal is at the run right now. I have been in Sunrun losing.
They better not be selling coal at 40$ per tonne right now
Isn’t that financially dead?
FACT: The world will always need coal. For more reasons than can be counted.
The facts where right in front of you at 4 in front of you at 8 in front of you at 16 now still in front of you at 18$
It feels like something just keeps pulling this stock up. Like reverse gravity.
Good article in WSJ on nat gas prices. Bodes well for coal prices and BTU.
anybody else buying?
