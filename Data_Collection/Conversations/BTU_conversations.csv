"Something this not right. All of my stocks, across the board, have taken 7-10% hits yesterday and today in the middle of uptrends that have text-book chart patterns. This makes me think institutions are shorting EVERYTHING in preparation for a major pullback. Possibly due to this new ""delta"" covid variant. Very concerning."
"Checking the numbers for the past 3 quarters, gross profit has been decreasing even though coal prices have increased around 70% over the same period. I suspect it may be due to freight costs also soaring to all-time highs. Dry bulk freight cost is still increasing.Don't expect too much from the earnings report..."
By far the most undervalued company in the world. Their assets alone are worth more than the entire market cap. Coal prices are on fire and this stock has barley budged. I could easily see this priced at $30-$40/ share in a year.
"Coal at a high,for last several years and going higher, this could set records high along with the rest of energy sector. Once in a lifetime opportunity to see a super cycle. I kick myself for not buying more when it set a record low last summer."
Lets go
"Looks like Yahoo has taken down their news section about BTU. Interesting. This is shapping up to be the stock of the year and nobody wants to talk about it because it's nasty ol coal! Libs be crying, ""global warming! Whaaaaaaaaaaaa-waaaaaaaaaaaa (sniff sniff) waaaaaaaa"""
Peabody Energy is up 17.84% to 10.73
Pullback for another run up
"It started out the day headed for $20.. with market cap of $3 billion. Oops - profit taking. Time to buy at the"" dip""?"
Look at coal prices woah steep dive to 150-139 the stock is only down 4% I don’t know these stocks weren’t pricing in a lot anyways
Ouch.
Lol that was quick
In a short term down trend. Sell now or buy short. Should hit $8.50 early next week.
"Electric cars that the govt is ""exploding"" will ALWAYS NEED COAL for FUEL. And just about everything that uses ""green"" energy to function needs some COAL for ""fuel""."
The facts where right in front of you at 4 in front of you at 8 in front of you at 16 now still in front of you at 18$
"So let me get this straight, coal prices are at a 10 year high, natural gas prices are skyrocketing, supply can't keep up with demand, and this stock sells off 12%??"
Investing in coal has taught me a lot on how foreign affairs work and how politics work lol it’s a joke they say one thing but there actions show totally opposite. Coal is back baby for a industry that has been beaten down and left over as road kill all these will run 100% all coal stocks will
"BTU just hit $2Billion Market Cap. LOGIC portrays that Peabody deserves at least as much M.C. as ""businesses"" that find you places to sleep at night. One of which is over $50Billion M.C. Just sayin'..."
This is impossible scheming. They were laying a trap all month long. And sure got me. Ugly weekend coming up. PS Anybody buying?
It looks attractive again after this correction. Heading for for $22-25.
WAIT - I could swear someone said this would never see 8-9 again??? Am I wrong?
Shorting a stock that has already a lot of bad news priced your playing a dangerous game especially when the market cap is this low compared to what it’s worth
"Speed bump, selling a few $19 Sep puts, hoping to buy more in the low $17."
The guy deleted his comment lol btu army is to strong
when the initial reaction in the stock was negative to a good earnings result I just loaded up some more shrs at $9.79 this am. Glad to see it rebound quickly but honestly you need to buy on these pullbacks.
"The more manipulation that occurs, the more violent the upswing will be. When I was in $BTU (Peabody Energy) 9 months ago, FUD article after article came out as the price was tanking. ATL was $0.80. Then FUD suddenly stopped. Share price 9 months later is $20. Believe, $CLOV."
"Today is July 5th, the stock market is closed but the futures market is open. The spot price of coal is at $137, only $2.05 away from reaching all time highs. Coal stocks are still so cheap. We need the spot price to stay elevated long enough for earnings reports to come out. Then you’ll see some real fireworks."
Drive it low so you can steal shares then it rockets like $btu
"Don""t be surprised if you see a mild short squeeze. My prediction is somewhere between 10 and 11. But unlike most short squeezes, 10 or 11 is not an elevated price for BTU. 10 or 11 is a reasonable price for BTU."
how far will this drop. wow
maybe I got lucky today I bought a few thousand shares down at 17.55 always feels good when you can buy a selloff in an uptrend stock.
This is when you start pulling chips of the table
Tanner you're going to go bald if you keep stressing everyday like this.
Glad to see B.Riley is on top of things: Peabody Energy stock price target raised to $7 from $4 at B. Riley
Cant wait to retire on my $BTU island with my $BTU yacht
I picked AMC over BTU... it was the wrong choice.
They are saying China’s growth is slowing then proceeds to say they are expected to grow at 8% lol. Headline readers liked that one
15 dollars by the Friday coal is much cheaper than oil. Oil will be 100 BofA
Look at reversal. Don't get screwed by shorting this. This is headed to $45. I repeat $45 very soon. The Short covering be epic and huge. It's going to hit old highs. Mark my word and experience.
Peabody Energy is down 14.96% to 10.23
Actually when you use logic worst has gone any bad news will send coal prices higher and any good news will send stock price higher win win
When this company posts strong net income of a 1billion $ I wanna see its market cap again at 700 m$
26 million in volume woah what a day
Woah CPI data got people running this is a buying opportunity
"Energy demand is rising with everyone looking to start. Check X, CLF. BTU to $45 on short covering and demand."
45 dollar stock in 2018
Drop baby!
14 hopefully support
"This beauty raised a lot of eyebrows this week. BTU has traded 70M shares in the last 3 days. Avg (3m) volume of 7.58M with 68M float shares (14% short float June) and short volume ratio of 26% avg for last 3 days it has alerts screaming. It’s on Zacks #2 Buy and Price-to-Sales at 0.37 times, it’s super cheap. Why would BTU not be the next GME or AMC. I see a possible MOASS in the works. Also with the economy moving towards recovery and China using ⅓ of total global coal consumption and coal is expected to meet only 45% of the projected 8% increase in electricity demand in 2021 for China alone. It doesn’t take an Einstein to figure this out."
85 for met coal!? Who is negotiating these contracts? My little Sister? I gotta ask her whether she is negotiating contracts for Peabody energy. Be right back. Still bullish thou
anybody else buying?
BTU better straighten up. Just the way she likes it.
tanner are you mad at me? you said if I buy this stock itll crash
Peabody Energy (NYSE:BTU): Q2 GAAP EPS of -$0.26 beats by $0.36.Revenue of $723.4M (+15.4% Y/Y) beats by $35.77M.Adjusted expects EBITDA of $122.1M vs. consensus of $73.4M.
"I’d be nervous with $CLOV if I hadn’t gone through this before, especially $BTU 9 months ago. So much FUD & negativity 9 months ago. Then *very suddenly* all the FUD stopped and the stock went from $1 to $20 now. I have faith in $CLOV. FUD won’t deter us. Only makes us stronger."
If your new here and are in just for momentum sell it no point because your just going to paper hand it the stock reacts very fast so I would recommend reading 10-k and 10-q so you’re confident about it
Last time it was like this there was a stock offering so who knows
I post too much on here but the spot price of coal jumped to an new all time high after hours today. All time high was $139.05 January 2011. It's at $141.22 right now.
Dang so is BTU worth $30.00 again.
Get your Jengq options (shares) while they are cheap. I feel they have the opportunity to run like BTU did. Similar to others I sold my BTU shares too early (from $1 to $4). GLTA
After today it just shows me algorithms run the market
Energy is going nothing but up all these stocks are down someone please tell me how tomorrow we should recover
I really regret selling BTU for solar this year. It was one of my biggest mistakes in stocks.
"BTU now clear for first target $15 ( 50% up from current price). Any pullback is a buy opportunity, imho."
oh my goodness.... it's pulling back. ABOUT TIME. 5-months later......
If GME can go from $4 to $400+ in 6 months... SO SHOULD BTU. BTU has about 400 times more going for it. Times 50. (and that's not even necessarily braggin' on BTU) Just sayin'..
I am feeling Bullish about BTU.
Elections have consequences… when u elect a senile socialist surrounded by big government socialist… what do u expect?
Wow! This stock makes no sense up when sector is down. Down when everything is green.. ok. Im happy. Go Peabody coal! I have faith in you.
"most undervalued, untalked about stock on the market."
News claim dow down due to investor fear resurge on C19. This is all a lie for hedge to get our shares low. Hold like AMC and buy more.
nothing but selling and people picking up cheap shares they can issue 400 million shares just crazy
What’s the reason for such an epic bounce back on a low float day.
Peabody has 10 times MORE coal that coal company Glencore. But Glencore has a 70 BILLION Market Cap. Compared to Peabody's measly 1 billion. Go figure...

"Big boys driving the stock down to $9 by Jul 16 options expiration. They're making a killing selling the calls on price spikes and then slowly driving the price back down till they expire worthless. Anyway, TIME TO LOAD THE BOAT AND BUY THE DIP NOTHING HAS CHANGED COAL IS KING."
We will never see a coal stock up to its original vlaue or overvalue these stocks will be always cheap
Has everyone read the transcript of the July earnings call? Are you all delusional? They have been issuing equity every chance they get. Expect significantly more equity issuance by October 2021.
THE problem is that the green cartel wants to change things over night. That is a treacherous disaster. PS America must demand the use of an EQUAL Balance between old and new. That means EVERYTHING.. from fuel to food!
if it wasnt a red day this would be 11$
I don't like the big $12 put buy today.
"WELL That is an interesting move. Albeit still WAY shortof where the stock belongs.We can (SHOULD) finally be looking for Peabody to makea profit. A big profit.PSJust went back over a $Billion market cap. Where it belongs. And much higher! ""Motherhood, Apple Pie, the American Flag,and Coal."""
The dumb sold today and the smart bought.
Why down ? It should be up 
Can I get an entry Point Boys I was in at 1.35 for 800 shares sole at 3.50 what a loos that was hehehehehe.
"Quarterly earnings, July 29. If investors like what they hear, resistance is $18.73."
Dolla dolla bills
What’s the news can’t find nothing
"Well drats, I bought this thing at $2 and covered with calls when it got to $5 because no way would it go to $12 very fast would it? Epic fail, maybe someone will exercise on me and put me out of my misery, but hey a three bagger still ain't bad."
OUCH I guess I should not have poked B. Riley for changing its target from 4 to 7. And now we got a whole weekend to think about it.
When it was 4$ I said 10-15$ lol I gotta say it I told you so
Today was a buy the dip day.
will crash hard half bk company
okay btu. we see you
Price of coal way up BTU own lotta coal!
People this was a 46.00 stock in 2018. OIL on the way back up. Have some foresight.
"By the dips they say, by the dips. How can you buy the dips if there are no dips?"
the only companies that make money on PRB coal are the railroads
I wonder how much money somebody is spending to keep this down? Should be a $30 stock.
Why this huge drop
Sell off today? What happened
"Cashed out half of my holdings (up >100%), still optimistic."
if it stays like this most hedge funds will start to look at market cap is now 1 billion well it has but its holding there
"3-months away from a solid 1-year growth, from .80 to $14+."
This is probably the most undervalued stock in the entire market right now.
Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We are above $13!!!!!!!!!!
I repeat my 45 target on this iwth strong buy call !!
Looks like just about $10/share would give it a measly $1billion market cap. Tesla would still be 700 (seven hundred) TIMES MORE powerful financially.
"By the way, there are a ""minimum"" of two totally different [""Sam""]s on this MSB--confusing, even for me :-)"
"I want $55/share, with happen?"
HOPING 15.50 holds as bottom
2026 bonds have gone from 22 to 77. Bought quite a few at 44. wish I'd seen it earlier.
11ish is very crucial lol what are you talking about the sky’s the limit at this point shorts are going to cover with nothing but good news coming out
Lift offf 
"The July 5th issue of Barron's contained the quarterly review. The stock listings included the quarter's biggest %-gainers and losers on page M17. The NYSE top %-gainers did not include BTU, but it should have. The 10th biggest %-gainer listed was J.Jill (the clothier). J.Jill increased $9.96 to $19.71/share, or 102.15%. BTU, however, went from $3.05 to about $8/share during the 2nd quarter, or 162%. This keeps with Barron's record of completely disregarding the big spike in coal prices that has occurred these last 9 months."
This board was a lot happier about 2 months ago lol
buy ARLP
Is today the day that we finally close above $12?
Everybody is upgrading price targets. This means that an equity offering is being proposed and the bankers are lining up for co-lead manager roles. Expect a significant refunding of all debt by 1Q 2022.
"The most bullish sign indicating a price reversal is coming is the amount of bashers and FUD that's thrown around about a stock. I've witnessed it time and time again. Within the last 12 months, I bought $LXU for $1.08; now it's at $8. Bought $BTU for $1.34; now it's at $9. Bought $EXPR for $0.87; now it's at $5. Bought $TELL for $0.95; now it's at $4. This, too, will be a multi-bagger within a few months. No doubt about it. What's my secret? Bottom-fishing *extremely* oversold companies. Clover Health, people, is as oversold as they come. All of those aforementioned investments, by the way, had a *ton* of ""lawsuit"" articles, doubters, bashers, short sellers, etc. No asset in the world stays extremely oversold and undervalued forever. Eventually value investors come along and scoop cheap stuff up. Same will happen here. Just be patient. $CLOV"
"So the fed tapering, the economy not growing as fast as people thought you can see that in valuations we are f I knew the next few months will be a bumpy ride but I’m just going to sit back and turn on my screener and look for 10 baggers lol"
And just to add there have been major outflows from small cap stocks this opportunity
OIL STARTING TO DROP HARD OVER LOWER DEMAND DUE TO NEW DELTA COVID STRAIN EXPLODING IN U S AND AROUND THE WORLD-MARKETS STARTING DROP NOW TOO-BIG GUY GOING TO CASH SO CAN BE READY TO PROFIT OFF DROP-ONLY WAY BIG GUY CAN MAKE THE BIG BUCKS OFF RETAIL TRADERS WHO ARE STILL BUYING!!
all the old world commodities that do the heavy lifting in the world are going to go much higher over the next several years all resources are getting scarce Plus the dollar is it its final few years as reset buy the world powers is ready well in progress this is just to begin .
The report is promising.
It’s up 21% on the past days I didn’t expect to run again today as long as it holds above 9$
"This stock has momentum, and value what more can you ask for"
"Does anybody understand the coal prices published by the U.S. EIA? The list prices for coal of different grades (high sulfur Appalachian, low-btu Powder River Basin stuff, etc.) and the prices are all way below the prices listed by ""Trading Economics"" and ""Markets Insider."" For example, the Appalachian stuff is priced at $57/ton, while ""Trading Economics"" has the price at $132/ton, the ""Markets Insider"" price is $121/ton. What is going on?"
this is going to slingshot up past 12. give it a week. Might fall below $8 but then watch out - up up and away
Mini short squeeze what did I say
Coal demand soaring. Supply is tight. Prices are at 15 year highs. This is still a bargain IMO.
I like the momentum of btu. Can it take us to 20-25 ?
"Why is this stock still rated as ""BULLISH"" by yahoo, when it's stagnated and actually decreased by about -4.5% today?"
"This new covid variant has everyone scared ng and coal are sky rocketing with another heat wave coming but guess what this is down do people not get what the cdc is saying that it’s a pandemic among the unvaccinated why do the people who did everything right by getting the vaccine have to suffer because someone thinks a microchip is going to be implanted in there arm lol. Also a lack of leadership from Joe he hasn’t been on tv only his press secretary and she dodges every question people want to hear from him. And plus 50% of the population is vaccinated and 54% has had one shot so the majority is vaccinated why lockdown and people don’t realize what this will do, lockdown? what is the u.s government going to do bail everything out again they already printed 30% of u.s dollars and also we already have supply shortages so closing down factories with high unemployment and slow economic growth that will literally cause stagflation the amount of poverty that will happen because of that it will be a mistake. Look what happened with India covid cases 6 weeks it took then it started to go down"
The past price doesn’t matter I’m not that delusional to say it was 40$ 2 years ago it’s going to go back up to that there’s a reason why it dropped to 90 cents 15$ is fair value speculation value is 20-30$
BTU dumped hard today yet the spot price of coal is even higher.
This is going to be a great short.
If the u.s was to shut down there will be more killed to poverty then the virus what are they going to do negative interest rates like come on people there is something to combat it I think there’s a lot of margin in the market a lot of stuff was getting priced in with margin debt at all time highs of course we are going to see overreactions and the Russell 2000 basically had a correction to price this risk in and plus it would murder Joe Bidens chances of getting re-elected and did anyone watch the health briefings today like come on.
Awesome news on the debt buy back
What did I say I said when people come here for momentum that’s when we see drops go back and look this is a joke when is this going to end
I see no resistance until $45 ! I am adding more ! Run has just started !
New E*Trade margin requirement for BTU goes from 75% to 100%. Not cool.
"Sudden spike to 25, and then 45 !!"
What are your price targets for this stock?
Reclaim that 10$ area weak hands just got wrecked and oil inventories are dropping like a rock making coal more attractive  long live coal gotta love it
Twenty five by Next Friday !! Momentum is growning
"Once this stock takes off, we’ll never again see these prices. When we look back, it’ll seem beyond obvious that we should have bought more at these prices. I remember people flocking away from $BTU less than 9 months ago, when it was $0.80; now it’s closing in on $14. $CLOV to $100."
big buyer
$30 share price by end of winter. Look at coal usage and coal prices going higher.. NG prices going through the roof will only make increase the demand for coal
I am also kicking myself why I invested in solar since coal is at the run right now. I have been in Sunrun losing.
Anybody knows if there is any offering anytime soon ?
Buy the dip
I understand that the reason oil snd coal went down today was for concerns that China wasn’t buying because of their covid cases worsening.
Found support at 9$ oh boy here we go and zacks is on board I hate analyst but they do help pump stocks let’s get it weak hands are out 
Can we get a number 15 short squeeze
Coal mining company Peabody Energy $BTU is up 290% this year and this green energy etf is down 20% this year. Which direction are we heading?
Buying this at $15 .
covid fears are back
BUY BACK @$6.01
tanner are u still alive?!?!? what a scary day today!!
BLAME ME I swear I jumped in at $17.30.. 15 minutes ago. Then: BAM!! But it is what it is.
Dilution coming
Coal stocks haven’t gotten what they deserve.
"Nothing has changed, coal continues to sit at multiple decade highs. Be patient, pullbacks are healthy. Looking at at least $35-40 before this cycle ends."
WIPING out a whole week in 3 hours.
Bought some calls on the dip yesterday let’s get this money good luck to you all!
"Where is anybody coming up with this $2Billion in shares offering pending? At $10/share wouldn't that be 200,000,000 shares thrown onto the market?"
The day I buy BTU then it goes Red. It's all my fault.
Debt buyback: Peabody Announces Offer To Purchase Up To $13.281 Million In Aggregate Accreted Value Of Its 8.500% Senior Secured Notes Due 2024 https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peabody-announces-offer-purchase-13-224900917.html
"I trimmed 1/2 of my shares today at 10.35, because I know the big money is going to dump it soon. This is easily a $15 company, but the drops can be really frustrating. I’ll be happy to see it hit 15, even if I don’t re-enter half my stake. We’re going to make the moon BLACK like trees in industrial era London!!"
"My goodness, I should not have sold those calls at $5 me thinks. Would someone just exercise on me and put me out of my misery please?"
It always happen when you get new 52 week highs. It retreats from there for another high. No worries. 15 is the nearest target.
I thought this would be going higher today!
Look at the news all I’m reading is good nothing but good news people are scared because of the variant once that risk is over oh boy are we flying
This happens every month before options expiration. Look at the price on Aug 20 (last options expiration) and see what happened shortly after. This is a buy the dip opportunity.
"Nice sales pitch. 40% of average volume in 1st 1'30"" of trading. Low volume?"
600 coal fired generating plants to be built in 5 Asian countries over the next few years....Alternative Energy..
look at ng and coal prices what the hell how is this down
It feels like something just keeps pulling this stock up. Like reverse gravity.
Laughable that we are still not a billion dollar market cap yet. I believe this is only the beginning.
Im watching the coal price going up day after day but the coal stocks dont react. Insane
I can tell when the pumpers are coming that’s when we get pullbacks because people panic if it does drop and find resistance at 8-9$ the next run will be insane I think there is still more upside I think what we had today was that mini short squeeze 15$ here we come
"Unless there is some inside information that none of us common people know, today was uncalled for…."
ALL coal is being blasted last several days. Profit taking. BTU: $20 down to $15.. in about 2 days. Who knew!
between Powder River Basin pricing and long term fixed price contracts this stock it Bankrupt again in 2023. Play it while you can
"Coal prices are surging globally, along with nat gas and this stock is down? This stock could easily surge to $50 and would only put it at a $5 billion market cap."
This is one of the largest coal suppliers in the world and it has a market cap of less than 1B. I can not make sense of that.
Can anyone explain a bit about the dilution?
I want this to drop a little bit so I can buy the dip.
"EVEN Zacks has a good report on BTU (that is rare) Despite Fast-paced Momentum, Peabody Energy (BTU) Is Still a Bargain Stockhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/despite-fast-paced-momentum-peabody-125012596.html"
Getting ready to test 52 week highs
And a tesla never worth more than mercedes toyota volkswagen bmw nissan honda hyundai and more combination but sadly today it is worth more than all this huge companies combined
only pure play coal company worth owning is ARLP.
$BTU is in its strong uptrend from last 8 months and we can expect that it will reach at $23 in its near future
https://www.freightwaves.com/news/if-coal-is-dead-why-are-all-those-ships-so-full-of-it
Looking for a re-entry here. Will we see the $13 handle?
They beat the EPS or not?
Tina did you sell
BTU is on FIRE
ONE WORD: It's a brutal game the greennee cartel plays with our stock. So easy to manipulate at this measly price.. with the $$$billions the govt funnels to them every week.
Mathew: Shares outstanding are up from about 100 million to 113 million. That is a lot.
could of sold at 11 holding thru earnings good luck everyone!
"Where is this giant issue of stock capability RUMOR coming from? Record shows 100,000,000 IS THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING. With a current market cap a little over 1 billion."
Look at the volume 227k come on shorts trying too manipulate
Same cycle these past 6 months. Test new highs - pull back. Test new highs - pull back. I believe this is not the end of this cycle.
This thing is NEVER going to stop. We're going on 5-months of green
Xi ping says no more pay market price for coal.
Enjoy the ride folks you deserve it.
Lol 
If anyone here is serious about $BTU go to Twitter and find the most recent news #coaltwitter
30% day woah short squeeze gotta love it coal is king lol
What about them buying back a whole bunch of their debt!!?? That normally would indicate (BTU's brand new) management is very confident in BTU's financial abilities.. and big-time confidence in the future. Just sayin'...PS Maybe opens up a $dollar tomorrow. Or down (it is BTU ya know)
Great day to buy. Yesterday ended on a red inverted hammer. Reversal of trend!
Isn’t that financially dead?
can not make money in this market??????Bankrupt again by the end of 2023
Guys I got a break down of BTU from Prophet of Profit If breaks 10.72 then next resistance is 13.25
Oil is the hottest commodity on Wall Street the article says why isn’t coal on there
This can not be hidden any longer
What is moving this stock????
This is a joke run this up to 15$ already
This is bad for the environment. Big changes coming I got out last week I might even start shorting this one.
EARNINGS REPORT! Coming on 29 July. Let's hope that they finally can make a few dollars. Actually should be $$$$BILLIONS Profit.. with the price people are paying for coal throughout the world!!!!
Does anybody understand the implications of BTU making this offer at this time? Is it good for BTU.. or the other parties.. or both? The announcement did correspond exactly with this big stock price increase. today. So the theory would seem there are good days ahead for BTU and coal!!! And hopefully for the stock.
https://discord.gg/S9GKzgF
Yeeeehawww lol
"This 11ish level is very critical for the stock. If it breaks, it may test higher up to 15ish otherwise. Nearly 100M share float, short interest isn't high, currently runs on no news and a pending $2B worth of share offering that is so far $100M executed."
I  BTU!!! These dips and peaks are wonderful.
"This is a combination of a short squeeze combined with the big boys who are perfectly aware that, at this moment, BTu is worth $15 a share. If you think BTu is going back to $8 or $9 dollars you might be unpleasantly surprised"
So JPM downgraded $CLOV to a $9 PT? Love it. More bullish than ever. That means their clients want people to sell so they can buy cheaply. Don’t fall for this nonsense. I watched $BTU get *hammered* by negative PRs and analysts six months ago. Stock went from $0.80 to $11 today.
I heard about BTU the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
"Ummm so people thinks this is earnings hype no it’s not it’s data showing hot summer continues, infrastructure deal, and hydropower getting wrecked. I go on Twitter because there is this thing called #coaltwitter a bunch of clowns talking like they are some coal import export experts lol when all it comes down to is the stocks are selling for dirt cheap and the market is not realizing value which it’s slowly starting to. It doesn’t take a expert to see it lol"
Don’t get to excited people sentiment can change fast real quick
Even if the world leaves coal next month this company has more chance to earn more than its market cap today
Look at ng and coal prices
"Earnings report will be about 10 AM Thur, eastern time. The thing to look for is increase in Sales.. more than Earnings. Although increase in earnings would be a bonus. There are a lot of strange expenses that might cut into profits (that maybe won't show up)."
PS - Glad to see BTU is paying for the buyback of Senior Loans with cash!! Means money must be flowing in more than they anticipated. There really is no reason why BTU could not get back to a measly $40/share. It's doing better now than it was the last time it was $40. (about 2 1/2 years ago) Just sayin'..
it won’t surprise me at all if we were green by the end of the day days like this make for great opportunities.
It will find a bottom at 8$ if it continues like this
This is a rock solid value stock because a company generating revenue 3-3.5 b$ coal production is selling for 700 m$ only a year ago that was companies net income
A stock can’t go up 20% a day so it’s holding that’s all I want to see
This is not due to news it’s people panic selling
https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/BTU/short-interest/
BTU is a 40 per share stock
