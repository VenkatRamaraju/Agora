scalped about 1200 bucks in this over the last few weeks but gave 500 back was long 200 at 17.30 puked it at 14.80 but reloaded 300 from 14.37 today good luck
BTU is tied to the oil and natural gas Price as they will continue to go up so will be Tu the fuel switching is actually on a daily basis big utilities have a mixture and so does the world Real problem is energy is no longer going to be cheap when companies like this have sell offs they are the ones to buy there’s a huge rotation in oil and natural gas uranium and Coal and more and more people are beginning to figure out the day of cheap energy is over and that money is coming into the sectors when you look at the overall market trillions of dollars have been made but they’re going to be looking for a new home and it’s the energy sector back to the future here come the 70s.
"12,500,000 new share issuance announced on 9/17/21 to be used to pay down debt."
Biggest mistake anyone could make with coal stocks is selling too soon. This is just getting started.
The high on Monday was $19.72 the low of the day today is $14.22 thank you for the 25% discount because by January and February this is a $40 stock very easily.
When are earnings gonna be announced?
Are we finally bottoming or what?
Sold yesterday and only made 10 cents a share on 40k risk. Too volatile!
if for some reason tomorrow they push this down another two or three bucks I will triple the amount of options that I bought today we are in the eye of the storm in a few weeks we will start to see some cold weather that’ll change the sediment in the mindset from an Indian summer to a brutal cold winter.
"I read the earning transcript and it looks good. I have some orders at 11.00 and 10.00 if it goes there. if it goes above $13.00, I will buy as well."
"Peabody, please explain to your shareholders tomorrow why BTU stock price is dropping in times of energy crisis and coal shortages. We deserve to know. And please take care of you finances so we don’t have to pay the price for your mistakes. The price of BTU does not reflect what’s going on in the world with energy crisis, high cost for coal and shortages. This definitely does not make sense to me."
find out whos getting the coal for 90$ and buy their stock !
time to buy
just remember if natural gas is on fire it’s all about chasing BTUs it kind of seems every day we rotate between the three or four major sources of energy that’s fine with me I have them all and I rotate with him but at some point in time this comes to an end and you’re all straight up vertical keeping core positions are important you least expect it the big move will come.
Is $19 possible again ?
Why is this 3x higher than June? I don't get it. Are we back to coal instead of clean energy?
Tomorrow will be very interesting going into the close
another -20% today?
MOTLEY HAD GREAT BREAKDOWN OF THE CONFERENCE HERE: They talk a lot about 2022 and 2023 coal sales. But BTU will never give ANY prices that they are selling the coal at. IE: Is it around today's prices OR have they hedged even more ridiculously low prices into the future. Their refusal to answer leads a person to believe it is the (dastardly) latter answer. IE: selling at ridiculously low money-losing prices. Can somebody here please correct me! https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/29/peabody-energy-corporation-btu-q3-2021-earnings-ca/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article
"Check out the action today in Arch. They reported earnings yesterday. Read the conference call transcript. It is ridiculously bullish. They've sold their entire yr-2022 Powder River Basin production for $16 ton, up from $13.50, with margins expected to approach $4/ton. They are clearing $300/ton for their seaborne coking coal (the fob price is $390/ton), and they're selling their North American coking coal for about $230/ton. They missed booking two ships of coking coal to Asia (they will be booked in Q4) and they still made $5.77/share in Q3. The other interesting thing they said was that all these utilities are scrambling because their old reliable suppliers are turning their pockets inside out. They mentioned that they were lucky to secure financing for their Leer South mine in 2019 because they're not sure the ""green"" bankers would give them the money today, which is perversely bullish for coal pricing of course."
No reason for this today. Pure manipulation. No rebound and stuck in a channel￼. Why stopping at this price range with no rebound is perplexing.
Seems volatile.
Loading up on more shares. I like to BUY LOW and SELL HIGH!
Algos were fooled by hedging loss. It’s all good. Printing money
"Yahoo is nothing but paid bashers on every ticker, they are wrong 100pct of the time in the long run $RIG at .66 said going to 0 went to $5 , $btu at .97 said bankrupt went to $19, all lies to drive price down and steal shares, look back in a year and xela will 10x and they will be wrong again like clockwork, absolute moooorons, you'll see"
I’m not really a technical analysis type person but looking at a 5 year chart this dip is nothing more than a buying opportunity.
Why is no one working up engineering / economic valuations for reprocessing BTU tailings for Rare Earths across at least - some - of the properties? Seems a match made in heaven
300 million debt retired. Forward looking excellent with price of coal going up.
Consol performing much better..Elliot may be weighing on Btu..
People we can’t make targets like “going to $20” it’s probably going much much higher. The world is out of coal and is desperate for it.
how much will it deep?
It’s all about the EBITDA. BTU is going to throw off some huge cash flows the next 12-18 months. What are they going to do with it is the question. Special dividends? Share buybacks? All good for shareholders
Were these newly disclosed hedges?
"Here's your top picks for the next year.TSLA, $XOM $BTU $LNG and $RECAFLibs create sky high inflation & energy prices which creates sky high Tesla demand, which then creates skyhigh electrical grid demand, which then creates sky high energy prices which creates more Tesla demand which creates higher energy prices and on and on and on.IT REALLY IS THAT SIMPLE. EV's CAUSE MORE OIL COAL AND LNG DEMAND AND LIBS KILL SUPPLY WHICH EXPLODES ENERGY PRICES FOR YEARS."
Bought it. Thanks!
Coal now $ 225
"Let’s see why the stock is dropping in times of world energy crisis, high coal prices and shortages? Earnings report 10 am CDT https://www.peabodyenergy.com"
btu IS NEAR THE BOTTOM NOW. sINCE THIS VALUE IS VERY CLOSE TO THE NEW ISSUED SHARE PRICE LIKE 13$/SHARE.
Why the third quarter losing money with such oil price?Hedging? How much hedged and how long hedged at what price?
"Pffftttt,,,China has attempted 5x this year to sell reserves and cool coal prices. We can see how that's done so far. China is basically disparate.Crazy over-reaction. EBTIDA on over $1.1b run rate. Yeah sure, sell that...lol"
I trade in and out of all the energy stocks from natural gas uranium oil and coal natural gas and oil are running nicely today and uranium and coal or down I really think there’s a big pool of people that rotate in and out like I do but I think that is going to change as people begin to realize transitory inflation really means it’s here and it’s going up and everything is derived off of energy and there’s no way around it I’ll dips are buying opportunities as natural gas and oil go up in price coal follow the world switches in and out of whatever fuel is the cheapest that’s what most utilities do in the United States and I’m sure it’s like that in the world but the bottom line is cheap energy is over no matter how much you hate coal it is an integral part of our energy demand.
I think it is floor now. Get ready to ride back again to $25 even beyond. It is a good entry point here.
U.S. power plants are on track to burn 23% more coal this year. BTU up 1300% from election day. Thanks Joe.
"Did I hear correctly? BTU sold most of their U.S. thermal coal already - PRB was priced since mid-year (when thermal coal prices were way lower) with only 10% left to price? And the rest of U.S. thermal is ""sold"" for 2022 and 2023 (presumably at low prices before they took off recently)? Geezz... Please correct me if I am incorrect? I may wait before buying. Still got exciting upside, but like almost no meaningful upside to U.S. thermal for 2022? That takes the excitement off near-term for sure."
Earnings will be good.
SMART MONEY BUYING NOV 19 -21 CALLS
Elliot sec filing says now owns 22.4% down from ~about 29%. Disposing via covered calls it appears with the most recent strikes of 15 and 16 for Oct. Expirations...
short got trapped below $12. we need to get above yesterday close and a bigger short squeeze will come.
Back in. Here we go.
"Ouch, my call options are dead after today"
"You got to be kidding me down over $5 a share and the markets are green , looks like the pull the rug out , I would guess some folks at least on paper have lost a lot ."
Ole man Peabody is taking a rest after the recent rapid rise. Expect another move up next week.
"BTU was flirting was $20 a few days ago now we’re kissing into the $13s, what’s going on here why the big drastic downward swing?"
I guess folks have not heard that Coal is King ?
"Basically past the funds reporting for q3, time for them to load back up with BTU!"
They earned a few bucks a share adjusted for hedges
I don't know where people are getting the number 7.00 from. There are 4 levels of support this thing has to fall through. The vast majority of shareholders are holding long-term for that $55+ in the next 1-2 years. I don't see this dipping below $11.40 (if it continues) before going back up.
I sold half of what I had close to the highs of the day and I bought everything back right now no matter how you look at it coal is an issue that is not going away I think we will close back up at the highs of the day there is more and more people every day coming into energy is the most under invested segment of the stock market billions and billions of dollars will be rolling out of the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 over the course of the next several years inflation it’s not transitory at all it’s actually going to continue to keep going up raid hikes will never zero interest rate policy is the name of the game and energy is the name of my game.
I made 10cents a share so I will wait for $10 in a few days
EARNINGS IN A COUPLE OF DSYS FOR BTU -ONE OF THE LARGEST COAL PRODUCERS IN THE WORLD WITH RECORD COAL PRICES AND HUGE COAL DEMAND AROUND WORLD GOING INTO PREDICTED COLD WINTER- HMMMM-WHERE DOES STOCK GO BUT UP!!!
Chinese quality of coal is low. They can not fully live on its own coal.
from peak to trough today it’s almost a two dollar move there’s a Lotta trading in this stock but the bottom line is it’s going up oh and it’s some point in time we just go vertical for day after day.
BTU has formed a golden cross…. Bullish signal…
I got in this and I just found out that NASA can't make coal-poweredc space vehicles. Well....they can but they are really heavy and you have to get to your sruising speed before leaving the atmosphere because coal doesn't burn well in space. I feel I was misled by the exuberance of you shareholders and did not get full-dislosure. I plan a lawsuit!
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks.All you'd need to do is send Steve a messagewhats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR on Te** le* gram @ ( SteveFX01 )"
china can only curb prices in China. they can't control prices on the I ternatuonal markets. so I'm not really sure that the news is really relevant. if the price of coal is 300 and China says no its 200. I'm pretty sure coal sellers won't be selling in China and then China will freeze
Oh I smashed the buy button
"They lost money ! Avoid, until Elliott Management is kicked out of board. They knew about loss, so we're selling hard ! I won't touch even at $6."
Manipulation in order for some investors to get in at lower price?
"“While the renewable energy movement is a worthy one, the world isn’t yet ready to run on sun and wind.” Coal is in high demand, world is struggling with energy crisis and winter is coming. You do the math."
"U.S. thermal mostly sold priced to 2023 - most of PRB to 2024? Man, they took away massive profit upside for next 2 years"
"This is a short term play, 1-3 years. Everyone jumped the gun on clean energy but it is the future not today. You cannot close one power plant without building a new one of some kind. That is what everyone, especially the EU did. Literally close plants. The effect was muted only because of COVID cut consumption from closed industry. Now industry is back.Sure they should be starting clean power plants. But they are not built yet. The only thing available is coal and gas generators. So no choice but to restart them. In five years shut them again but only after clean energy is on line.So being the only game in town, coal is asking whatever they want and are getting it.Tldr nat gas and coal thru this winter then move to clean energy starting mid late next year."
for a company to have their share price of their stock drop five dollars a share with record earnings do the sniff test it’s manipulation but come January this manipulation will make you a lot of extra money we are in a energy crisis worldwide all chasing the same products Limited supply and extreme consumption well only fuel higher prices I bought some more again and I bought calls at the low of the day.
"Welp, my bracket is busted... oh wait, that's my stock portfolio."
MAY DROP SOME FROM PROFIT TAKING TOMORROW BUT EXPECT IT TO ULTIMATELY HEAD MUCH HIGHER-I BOUGHT CHEAP OPTIONS OUT OF MONEY LAST WEEK SO I MADE BANK
Whose buying back in?
the 1/3 hedge is only for 22 correct ? ..so in 23 24 and so on they wont repeat same mistake twice right ?
"Coal shortages in both China and India and around the world are causing power crisis. As prices for natural gas sky rocket, people turn to coal. Winter is coming. This stock should climb unless …"
"@berk, thoughts on why then the sp so down today?"
PRB coal index price still showing 13.35. That should generate a lot of excess cash flow
$6 is max value of this for now.
THE ONLY THING ANYONE CARES ABOUT IS HOW FAST BTU GETS BACK TO 20 NOW
It looks like the market is pricing in a mild winter this year.
*Bet: 2H2021 is to Sell 10 MT in seaborne thermal coal and 3 MT seaborne Met coal. 2 Bil Revenue and 570 Mil in EBITDA in 2H2021 total all coal.
"Big issue for the whole energy complex is the built infrastructure. Not like PA or NY can suddenly switch their power generation and heating from oil to gas to coal as prices move. This winter is dance (heat) with the one that brought you. So they are stuck consuming and paying the suppliers rate. And because of all the underinvestment, those that have supply of what you need calls the shots. It will take until minimum this time next year to bring new supplies of anything to the market even if it is just reopening called fracking. New mines or new wells will take years. Welcome back to 1979."
And while this debacle is happening.. a company that rents clothes to people (RENT) is pegged by investors as being more valuable (higher market value) than BTU.Go figure.
let’s see if there is more follow-through come tomorrow I will sell off some of my uranium holdings that have been performing outstanding over the last week and I will more of BTU the world is in an energy crisis all energy related commodities or going out much more throughout the next several years the world is growing and as it grows it requires massive amounts of energy of all forms and has more laws are passed an investment money is diverted to bring these products to market the worst situation will get the people running the show throughout the world or clueless get ready this winter for an unbelievable energy crisis prepare and get it now you got a small window of opportunity but that window is closing.
looks like some stop losses got triggered.
"I need management investigation. How come they didn't see ahead and any shareholder think about profit n their actions. It moved from 80 cents to $20 for rates, but really it didn't happen. So 80 cents is real price for now. Fire everyone including Elliott Management from board. $1 is still expensive for this."
Does anyone know who they sold those hedges too? I wanna invest in that company.
Back in my favorite Stock -BTU!!! Ready for next ride!!!
when Cabot oil natural gas was being pushed down I bought the calls and that was a great call and the same with this be patient let the energy crisis play out as we go forward you’ll make a lot of money.
"How China can control international community coal. They have only two options, pay the price or freeze this winter"
from this point on I think we are in some type of trading range maybe like a A dollar a half either way but that’s OK singles and doubles add up to runs in overtime you can make a career just getting on base.
"Stay the course, this is going much higher. Less than an hour in and we are almost at the avg volume for the day! This is going to min $30-40 over the next 6 months."
not only is China having Coal issues now India is having the same problem most of their electricity in India is produced by coal two of the biggest countries in the world use coal this problem is not going away oh I know is BTU is a great trading stock at least it is for me.
I am ok to wait till jan to give company time to prove itself.
"Is coal expensive? The current natural gas price in Europe (Holland) is 88.5 euros/MWh. That’s $22.35/mmBTUs with the euro at about $1.16. (0ver 4x the U.S. price.) The average pound of Appalachian coal contains 12,500 BTUs, meaning that the price of “seaborne thermal coal” equal to the European gas price in BTUs is $558.7/ton. (($22.35*12500*2000)/1000000) That’s why the world is still buying and burning coal at $230/ton."
Conference call will send shares back to 16. Arch coal opposite. Picked up more at 11.50. Cold weather blast will explode shares. China puts the cream on top the pie.
"Can we go to $4 Bil in revenue and >$1 Bil in EBITDA drop debt to $1 Bil in 2022? Here is the bet. China blinks and imports Australian coal, even if it is for three months and to tide them over for winter.The bet is over. China blinked and started importing. India needs coal. James Stevenson of IHS Markit, an energy consulting company, said in the NPR report surging global demand is especially the case in the Asia-Pacific region. “There isn’t enough coal in China,” Stevenson said. “Japan’s had more coal demand. So there’s a scramble to buy coal from where you can.”"
It was $3 just 6 months ago ? Why anyone would buy after so much run?
"PRICE TO SALES - great reference TSLA - That needs BTU coal for ""fuel"": 22.00 BTU - 0.57"
Hello from a coal miner in Wyoming. I've been reading a lot of smart comments- you guys are on the right track I think.
Bought the dip. Coal shortages.. No brainer.
"If you’re new to Bitcoin, heed this warning:- Bitcoin going up is fun- There will be price crashes- There can be nasty crashes- Sometimes 30% in days- Buy what you’re ok losing- Hold through the volatility- Don’t try day trading- Be patient & breathe"
Up $3. That's a start. BTU should have a Market Cap of no less than $50 billion. COAL is THAT important to America!! PS Can we hit $20 today.
How is COAL at $267/ton and BTU presold all theirs for only $84 and then also somehow bet that coal wouldn't go higher so they actually blow another 240million on top of their lost profits from $84 all the way up to $267?Time to fire the entire Executive suite for turning diamonds into coal. How many more great ideas did these guys make?
you mark my words over the next several weeks all these losses over The last three days will disappear the energy problems are getting bigger by the day but they cannot let you know this we could have major shortages come this winter and it’s not just an inconvenience it’s about sustaining life we are ready critical junction with supply and demand and if the weather is colder and longer supplies of all BTUs will become very stressed.
Does anyone care that the company is selling and Eliott has recently sold...And may still be selling ??
This stock moves like nothing I’ve ever witnessed
"made quite a bit in Q3. going to make substantially more in q4. obviously the hedges hurt. but they haven 1/3 priced at 94 for '22 and 2/3 free floating. they aren't in a bad spot. with the 1/3 they hedged they could sell the rest for 0 and break even next year. so there is quite a bit of profit to be had from the other 2/3. no issues here. just a stock that has been in free falls for a week and people keep hanging on the MTM loss on hedges. if coal goes down that gets added back in as ""profit"" things are looking quite good going forward. this is an amazing buying opportunity now."
I sold half my shares Close to the high of the day and I bought them all back now again I know at some point in time this will stop and it’s just vertical.
"OMG, forget reading the ""experts"" on BTU. Most don't even understand basic GAAP accounting. IF BTU forward sells coal it is a big PROFIT....if BTU has hedge losses it because coal went up MORE...this is GOOD....duh."
Will drop from here to 6.
The energy sector he’s setting up for a huge rally don’t be misled we got massive shortages of everything Remember everything on Wall Street does he’s a con game but the one thing they can never do make commodities come out of thin air like like the Fed prints Money you will see over the coming weeks all energy stocks will be breaking your 52 week high’s today Is a beautiful day in Pennsylvania perfect temperatures no heat No air-conditioning oh and all the solar panels are charging up But this will be a distant memory in the next month as the weather turns cold all energy will heat up.
buying more at $12.20. Let's see if it fills.
Vic. it is nice to hear they are honest! But what did they say about potential immediate big future big increases in profits that has you so impressed? And why is rest of market BTU investors apparently disagreeing with you?
"""We are capturing opportunities provided by current robust coal market dynamics with strong operational performance which is resulting in expanded margins across our portfolio. And we have reached labor agreements at both our Metropolitan and Shoal Creek mines which paves the way for higher met coal production next year,"" said Peabody President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Grech. ""While we are optimistic regarding the markets, we continue to focus on the long term with a disciplined approach to cost control, pricing strategies and additional reduction of debt to position the company to be resilient in all market cycles."""
China has no ability to influence global coal prices. Only internal domestic prices of domestic producers. This news has nothing to do with BTU.
Not worth even $1. Sell sell sell. The coal rush be over before they justify the valuations. Selling at loss !
16 tomorrow after the earnings!
A proper hedge merely reduces some of your profits during good times. It doesn't cost you 240million bucks and force you to post a big loss during a quarter where prices for your product has went up 100%+. That would be a major F-UP by not knowing how to put on a hedge which greatly increased your RISK instead of reducing it.
"BTU brass said: ""It's pretty much sold out (for next year)"" BUT!!! At what prices??? He refuses to answer in plain words.. even at the conference call!!!Have they set it up to sell for $80, while going price is $240???!!!! It looks like that. Arch said it has sold its (2022) coal at prices 20% ABOVE the $240. PS Guess the big question is can BTU make enough money selling (hedged) coal for $80 (versus much greater going rate of $240) to make some sort of a profit. Or is stock gonna tank even more when rest of market finds out the (apparent ) stupid $80 hedging into 2022??!!"
Hedging? 248 mil is relative pittance. The need for coal is Biblical proportions. America/world comes to standstill without coal.
Anybody listening to conference call?
come Monday morning pre-market I’m already setting up my strategy today for what I’m going to do I’ll be buying call options on the companies I feel could blow the doors off over the next six months maybe the weather here in Pennsylvania got me a little hyped up it’s going to be in the mid 50s all day and my heats been cycling all day So I’m thinking energy and these third-quarter reports we’re going to draw billions and billions of New money to the energy sector that will be leaving other sectors in the market this is the bad boy going forward.
"Yes there is a climbing energy demand right now, but they can’t start charging customers more because of this. It’s going to take time for this stock to catch up from all the drama last month in the market. I am going long on this and I will see you all in November when earnings are out."
Up we go from here....
"Conference Call Critical Quote From the new BTU boss: [""long-term"" may be the most important aspect of BTU that there is!!!]""While we are optimistic regarding the markets, we continue to focus on the long term with a disciplined approach to cost control, pricing strategies and additional reduction of debt to position the company to be resilient in all market cycles."""
"Man, some basics people need to understand here. 1) accounting (GAAP) requires futures are marked to market, a loss means coal went higher than forward sold. A good thing 2) forward strip in the years ahead where they sell is 1/2 spot (present price). Forward prices indicate true long lasting demand, it is solid 3) most of btu coal is from the powder ridge and sold domestically at prices near $12/ton. 4). Opening mines is a slow slow process. This is needed to increase seaborne thermal. 5) what’s happening in the Aussie JV will be critical forward. $250m has been invested there and used a lot of free cash 6) liquidity is good. $130m was recently used as collateral for futures margin. $29m is left if $500m due 3/22 and most maturities are pushed to 2024+ on debt."
Can we go to $4 Bil in revenue and >$1 Bil in EBITDA drop debt to $1 Bil in 2022?
I know this doesn’t help. But “no bueno”
Someone is playing a beautiful game.
"Sale on BTU, headed to $30 by end of 2021. Don't fight fundamentals."
BTU is one the top stocks of 2021.
I have some buy orders at 13.00

The Company states earnings results will fall short of consensus estimates. You think thus already priced in?
I bought quite a few shares yesterday as it was dropping and I sold off most of those shares on the way up today and I went to Sand Ridge energy they are totally unhedged hedged and they sold off around 6% today I loaded up with the call options for January and April the oil stocks and natural gas stocks are not being priced properly yet come this winter most of them will double and triple we are in a full blown energy crisis that 99% of the people in his country or watching football or dancing with the stars when they get their electric and heating bills come this winter it’s going to be a big wake up call a lot of people that don’t have money will not be able to pay but the ones that have quite a bit of money to invest will be moving into the energy sector in droves they were trillions of dollars created out of thin air by Central banks and that money will find a home and it’s in commodities don’t underestimate how much the stocks can move up it’ll be like a straw with Hoover dam pushing it through it get ready to rock ‘n’ roll soon as this first sniff of cold weather hits.
"Looks like the bottom is in, or close to it. I assume that there was a ton of short interest on Monday, and I bet they’re due to close their positions soon. I don’t see it going much lower. At worst, it’ll probably kiss the 75 day moving avg and then rip back up."
BOYS BELIEVE WE WILL GET DOUBLE IN A FEW WEEKS -MOST BELIEVE BLOWOUT EARNINGS WITH RECORD COAL PRICES NOW AND SHORTAGE OF COAL AROUND WORLD!!!
BOYS GET READY TO RIDE THE COAL WAVE NEEDED TO SUPPLY WORLD THROUGH COLD WINTER!!
The first 10 minutes of today’s action will decide the fate of this stock price.
"this kind of stuff will continue to go on with this company unless we hear of firings .. i think the shareholders should get to vote on hedging , not crpt insiders at board"
don’t be surprised when they close at 4 o’clock comes around we’re all green the same people that short it on the way down will close those shorts out and go Long yes it’s a big casino but commodities cannot be printed out of thin air and we’re in the biggest commodity boom since the 70s supply of all commodities is going to be an issue the world is growing and show his demand.
News article that China considering intervention to reign in coal prices. At least I know why all coal mining stocks are dumping today.

I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Stocks-tracker.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
Hmmm why does it keep dropping with winter approaching ?
"Analyst comments will be ""wet blanket"" after CC. I think BTU a buy, but so much sizzle gone and company emphasis on debt reduction (more ATM above $10?) I may wait to see if it can trade down to $10."
The low volume hustle.
I will continue to follow it down I did very well in the uranium sector and oil and natural gas this isn’t going to zero so you might have a little time frame were this has big dumps but there will also be times where there are rallies look at the big picture this energy crisis is going to last many many years and this company will be around at much higher prices.
"I am heavily invested in oil and gas, but now looking at coal and I find BTU intriguing due to them having both met and thermal. Granted, looks like company ""bagged"" a number of investors with pre-announcement and then sold stock in ATM (or so I think they did?). Not sure why company needs to raise more equity when 2022 outlook seems to look so good? Hopefully learn more on CC. But BTU now on my radar to buy."
"Normally don’t post, but this is my last one. It just kissed the 75 day moving avg (13.92). Seems like a nice support level!!!"
WOW! What an opportunity to buy LOW and sell HIGH on BTU. Here it is. Talk about a manipulated market. I have a BIG SMILE! Best wishes to everyone!
What is the catalyst to be shorting this? ￼￼
"I am strong holder of ARCH. I won't sell that before 150-175. This one is hitting SINGLE digit, as one of the largest holder manipulating. Unless, they sell..I won't buy. They trade on insider information."
MY OPTIONS EXPIRED SO BTU WILL PROBABLY POP NOW SINCE COAL AT RECORD HIGHS AND A SHORTAGE OF COAL AROUND WORLD!!
"NOT TRYING TO BE NEGATIVE: Short, I am long (sadly) and just want to know the answer to my question/observation. This question was asked by media several times at end of conf call. Neither the pres nor CFO would answer. ""What price is BTU coal set to be sold at in 2022 and 2023.. (which THEY said is already booked)???"" If they had just gone with the coal price flow (now $240) for the last 9 months instead of hedging they would have made $billion dollars."
just wait until the coal shortage in China story hits the evening news and the average Joe starts to realize that there is a crisis. Rolling blackouts in across China currently in order to conserve coal for the winter are a sign of what is coming. Price of coal will skyrocket once panic sets in.
"China trying to artificially limit domestic coal prices? They are still a net importer and will need to buy foreign coal... buy when there is fear on the streets. This news is total FUD, its obvious what ultimately happens when governments try to implement strict price controls."
This is disaster.
Time to buy the dip everyone. We’re taking off really soon. ~30% drop in only 2 days. I just backed up the brinks truck!!!!
bought more 
Retirement looking like 5-years instead of 20. Let's go coal.World Wide ShortagePrices at all-time highsWHY IS THIS NOT MOVING?
"free money, yahoo is nothing but paid bashers, again last fall i was in $btu at .97 they said the same stuff delisting, bankrupt, stock went to $19 in 6 months, $rig was the same thing .66 to $5, they are always 100 pct of the time proven wrong, buying at 1.65 will make you rich, possible 100x if you hold as they grow and go debt free, stock is trading at a .25 price to sales, average for the tech industry is over 5, docu is at 30 and we have the same product, company does over a billion in revenue, people are desperate for cheap shares and short interest was 139 pct on 9/15 check ameritrade website not the fraud sites being paid to conceal the data, these people saying 7 million short shares are delusional, they shorted 100 mil and half are naked shorts, this could be the next gme, be warned"
1.8 - 2.5$ fair value
Take a look at Lithium prices & $LAC and compare charts with Coal price & $BTU. Interesting pattern similarity in that stock price lags spot prices.
Whose buying this dip?
"Well i added some long calls to my BTU position. China can hem and haw and try to reign in coal prices, but they can't stop demand in the US, Europe and India and other places from continuing to explode."
do younger generation is fixated on hi tech and anything that your generation has grown up with but we are going to take a step back in time with everything revolves around energy the day of cheap energy is gone forever and as we move forward more and more people and this younger generation he’s going to figure it out very quickly we will be looking at millions and millions of new dollars flowing in this direction over the course of the winter when they get their electric bills Natural gas and oil heating bills the light will come on like a 200 white bulb nothing works in this world without energy
Morgan Stanley‘s chief commodity guy just reported oil is going to $100 a barrel and the world economy could be crippled by lack of oil and natural gas I totally believe this because since the coronavirus the drilling for natural and oil has not kept up with the natural decline of the wells what they did was they used the drilled uncompleted wells to fill the gap but once these are gone and Addys getting very close the supply will start to drop very rapidly this all comes into play with all carbon fuels BTU is going to benefit immensely from what is going to happen I loaded up today on call options out in January this is the third day in a row BTU is getting their head handed to them that’s the perfect time to load up this is going to reverse very quickly over the next three months and blow through the 52 week eyes
"BTU mines two commodities, coal and share holders, just ask anyone that went through that last bankruptcy."
"OK, anybody--what gives???? The earnings preview is really/REALLY mediocre--revenues only slightly above estimates--and an earning loss of 75 Million, versus an estimate of a positive 83 cents a share++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Yet the volume is huge, and price action amazing++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Is there something ""out in the wind"", that nobody on this board knows about???"
what the..................
"Peabody Energy Corp., the top American supplier, has contracts for more than 90% of its coal from the Powder River Basin region next year and all of the power-plant fuel from its other U.S. mines. And Arch Resources Inc., the No. 2 producer, has lined up deals with utilities for all of its 2022 output from the basin at an average price that’s 20% higher than current spot prices. Part of article from Bloomberg. Man they really blew this one! I would think somebody's HAS to be fired for this. As for stock, there's no upside. They've sold ""pretty much"" all their coal at a lower price. All they can hope for now is they don't find a way to lose what money they will make. Rides over, time to move on."
"I have been long, BTU for this 3-month roller-coaster ride. The 6-month chart is showing a double bottom. This is an aggressive buy signal. Time to back up the truck!"
"Another comment that sums up the debacle: ""on the call CFO presents 34% margin as an achievement in the environment when coal prices went up 250%"" Geeesch"
