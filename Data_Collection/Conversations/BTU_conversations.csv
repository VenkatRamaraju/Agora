How is COAL at $267/ton and BTU presold all theirs for only $84 and then also somehow bet that coal wouldn't go higher so they actually blow another 240million on top of their lost profits from $84 all the way up to $267?Time to fire the entire Executive suite for turning diamonds into coal. How many more great ideas did these guys make?
"So, I have some questions. Reading some parts of the transcript of the conference call which I pasted in quotes below, it sounds to me that Peabody's hedge was probably something like short selling of coal futures at an average price of $84. But, the price of coal skyrocketed at one point, so that's probably why Peabody had to account the unrealized mark-to-market loss of $238 million. Is my understanding correct, so far? However, it sounds to me that Peabody can simply deliver the coal that they will min or do something equivalent to effectively cover these contracts and the average price of $84 is a good enough price for Peabody. Also, I don't know at what price the mark-to-market was calculated, but the price of coal has crashed from the recent peak. So, if we re-calculate the mark-to-market at today's coal price, the unrealized mark-to-market loss is probably significantly lower. Am I on the right track? ""Reported revenue was $679 million, net of $238 million of unrealized mark-to-market losses. Those losses primarily related to economic coal hedges. At September 30, we had hedges on 2.9 million metric tons, the majority of which were contracted in the first half of 2021 and relate to 2.1 million metric tons of expected production at our Wambo underground mine. These tons are expected to be mined and settled at a rate of 1.4 million tons in 2022 and 0.7 million tons in 2023.""""The hedge contracts support the profitability of the mine by securing average prices of $84 per metric ton through mid-2023 and are a key ingredient of a strategy to extend the expected life of the mine. The remaining tons relate to brokered coal transactions and other blending and optimization activities, which will settle beginning in the fourth quarter and throughout 2022. Net loss attributable to common shareholders totaled $44 million, including recognition of the $238 million of unrealized mark-to-market losses.""""When these tons are sold, we will realize either the currently higher spot price or cash margin will reverse as prices decline toward the hedged price. Turning now to the segment results."""
The Company states earnings results will fall short of consensus estimates. You think thus already priced in?
"this kind of stuff will continue to go on with this company unless we hear of firings .. i think the shareholders should get to vote on hedging , not crpt insiders at board"
come Monday morning pre-market I’m already setting up my strategy today for what I’m going to do I’ll be buying call options on the companies I feel could blow the doors off over the next six months maybe the weather here in Pennsylvania got me a little hyped up it’s going to be in the mid 50s all day and my heats been cycling all day So I’m thinking energy and these third-quarter reports we’re going to draw billions and billions of New money to the energy sector that will be leaving other sectors in the market this is the bad boy going forward.
"Check out the action today in Arch. They reported earnings yesterday. Read the conference call transcript. It is ridiculously bullish. They've sold their entire yr-2022 Powder River Basin production for $16 ton, up from $13.50, with margins expected to approach $4/ton. They are clearing $300/ton for their seaborne coking coal (the fob price is $390/ton), and they're selling their North American coking coal for about $230/ton. They missed booking two ships of coking coal to Asia (they will be booked in Q4) and they still made $5.77/share in Q3. The other interesting thing they said was that all these utilities are scrambling because their old reliable suppliers are turning their pockets inside out. They mentioned that they were lucky to secure financing for their Leer South mine in 2019 because they're not sure the ""green"" bankers would give them the money today, which is perversely bullish for coal pricing of course."
"Peabody Energy Corp., the top American supplier, has contracts for more than 90% of its coal from the Powder River Basin region next year and all of the power-plant fuel from its other U.S. mines. And Arch Resources Inc., the No. 2 producer, has lined up deals with utilities for all of its 2022 output from the basin at an average price that’s 20% higher than current spot prices. Part of article from Bloomberg. Man they really blew this one! I would think somebody's HAS to be fired for this. As for stock, there's no upside. They've sold ""pretty much"" all their coal at a lower price. All they can hope for now is they don't find a way to lose what money they will make. Rides over, time to move on."

"Is coal expensive? The current natural gas price in Europe (Holland) is 88.5 euros/MWh. That’s $22.35/mmBTUs with the euro at about $1.16. (0ver 4x the U.S. price.) The average pound of Appalachian coal contains 12,500 BTUs, meaning that the price of “seaborne thermal coal” equal to the European gas price in BTUs is $558.7/ton. (($22.35*12500*2000)/1000000) That’s why the world is still buying and burning coal at $230/ton."
And while this debacle is happening.. a company that rents clothes to people (RENT) is pegged by investors as being more valuable (higher market value) than BTU.Go figure.
The energy sector he’s setting up for a huge rally don’t be misled we got massive shortages of everything Remember everything on Wall Street does he’s a con game but the one thing they can never do make commodities come out of thin air like like the Fed prints Money you will see over the coming weeks all energy stocks will be breaking your 52 week high’s today Is a beautiful day in Pennsylvania perfect temperatures no heat No air-conditioning oh and all the solar panels are charging up But this will be a distant memory in the next month as the weather turns cold all energy will heat up.
"NOT TRYING TO BE NEGATIVE: Short, I am long (sadly) and just want to know the answer to my question/observation. This question was asked by media several times at end of conf call. Neither the pres nor CFO would answer. ""What price is BTU coal set to be sold at in 2022 and 2023.. (which THEY said is already booked)???"" If they had just gone with the coal price flow (now $240) for the last 9 months instead of hedging they would have made $billion dollars."
I’m not really a technical analysis type person but looking at a 5 year chart this dip is nothing more than a buying opportunity.
300 million debt retired. Forward looking excellent with price of coal going up.
"Peabody, please explain to your shareholders tomorrow why BTU stock price is dropping in times of energy crisis and coal shortages. We deserve to know. And please take care of you finances so we don’t have to pay the price for your mistakes. The price of BTU does not reflect what’s going on in the world with energy crisis, high cost for coal and shortages. This definitely does not make sense to me."
"I have been long, BTU for this 3-month roller-coaster ride. The 6-month chart is showing a double bottom. This is an aggressive buy signal. Time to back up the truck!"
"Man, some basics people need to understand here. 1) accounting (GAAP) requires futures are marked to market, a loss means coal went higher than forward sold. A good thing 2) forward strip in the years ahead where they sell is 1/2 spot (present price). Forward prices indicate true long lasting demand, it is solid 3) most of btu coal is from the powder ridge and sold domestically at prices near $12/ton. 4). Opening mines is a slow slow process. This is needed to increase seaborne thermal. 5) what’s happening in the Aussie JV will be critical forward. $250m has been invested there and used a lot of free cash 6) liquidity is good. $130m was recently used as collateral for futures margin. $29m is left if $500m due 3/22 and most maturities are pushed to 2024+ on debt."
Loading up on more shares. I like to BUY LOW and SELL HIGH!
"Conference Call Critical Quote From the new BTU boss: [""long-term"" may be the most important aspect of BTU that there is!!!]""While we are optimistic regarding the markets, we continue to focus on the long term with a disciplined approach to cost control, pricing strategies and additional reduction of debt to position the company to be resilient in all market cycles."""
"made quite a bit in Q3. going to make substantially more in q4. obviously the hedges hurt. but they haven 1/3 priced at 94 for '22 and 2/3 free floating. they aren't in a bad spot. with the 1/3 they hedged they could sell the rest for 0 and break even next year. so there is quite a bit of profit to be had from the other 2/3. no issues here. just a stock that has been in free falls for a week and people keep hanging on the MTM loss on hedges. if coal goes down that gets added back in as ""profit"" things are looking quite good going forward. this is an amazing buying opportunity now."
