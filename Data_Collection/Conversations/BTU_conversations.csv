BTU NEEDS TO HOLD 16 SUPPORT
This one ain’t acting right
Has everyone read the transcript of the July earnings call? Are you all delusional? They have been issuing equity every chance they get. Expect significantly more equity issuance by October 2021.
I haven't seen Tanner on this message board for a while.
It ended at 17.17 lol is that a sign
"Electric cars that the govt is ""exploding"" will ALWAYS NEED COAL for FUEL. And just about everything that uses ""green"" energy to function needs some COAL for ""fuel""."
Peabody has 10 times MORE coal that coal company Glencore. But Glencore has a 70 BILLION Market Cap. Compared to Peabody's measly 1 billion. Go figure...
They beat the EPS or not?
a quiet board for this active stock
B.Riley Securities raised the target price from $15 to $22.My apologies if this was reported here already.This company is not ranked high on ESG score. That makes me sad.
Ole man Peabody really pulled a fast one here. No doubt this is going higher.
BTU HEADED HIGHER AS NAT GAS GOES HIGHER AGAIN TODAY
People we can’t make targets like “going to $20” it’s probably going much much higher. The world is out of coal and is desperate for it.
$30 share price by end of winter. Look at coal usage and coal prices going higher.. NG prices going through the roof will only make increase the demand for coal
BTU is tied to the oil and natural gas Price as they will continue to go up so will be Tu the fuel switching is actually on a daily basis big utilities have a mixture and so does the world Real problem is energy is no longer going to be cheap when companies like this have sell offs they are the ones to buy there’s a huge rotation in oil and natural gas uranium and Coal and more and more people are beginning to figure out the day of cheap energy is over and that money is coming into the sectors when you look at the overall market trillions of dollars have been made but they’re going to be looking for a new home and it’s the energy sector back to the future here come the 70s.
^^^Clean Coal is highly demanded^^^
is this a buy here?..or is 10.75 better entry?
"PRICE TO SALES - great reference TSLA - That needs BTU coal for ""fuel"": 22.00 BTU - 0.57"
"Cashed out half of my holdings (up >100%), still optimistic."
You guys might want to back up a little. It's gonna get tight in here when everyone rushes in to get out of the cold!
Let us all take a minute to thank the diabolical stupidity of the UK government. Massive energy crisis because they insist on putting all their energy companies out of business...now they have to open coal plants to facilitate the electricity. Picked up a ton of bonds at 44. They broke 90 yesterday. Sweet sweet cash born of abject stupidity.
Big holder unloading. Only coal stock down
"Day-Yam, It's like when market is up... BTU is down. And vice versa. Look it up."
Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We are above $13!!!!!!!!!!
They are going to need a ton of coal...https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10016753/Energy-firms-supplying-six-million-UK-homes-face-collapse.html?ITO=applenews
"Looks like Yahoo has taken down their news section about BTU. Interesting. This is shapping up to be the stock of the year and nobody wants to talk about it because it's nasty ol coal! Libs be crying, ""global warming! Whaaaaaaaaaaaa-waaaaaaaaaaaa (sniff sniff) waaaaaaaa"""
PRB coal index price still showing 13.35. That should generate a lot of excess cash flow
INDIA SAY TO HAVE ONLY A FEW DAYS SUPPLY OF COAL FOR POWER GENERATION!!
buying more at this price. $12.86
Looks toppy
"I want $55/share, with happen?"
The facts where right in front of you at 4 in front of you at 8 in front of you at 16 now still in front of you at 18$
it won’t surprise me at all if we were green by the end of the day days like this make for great opportunities.
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks.All you'd need to do is send Steve a messagewhats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR on Te** le* gram @ ( SteveFX01 )"
"Stay the course, this is going much higher. Less than an hour in and we are almost at the avg volume for the day! This is going to min $30-40 over the next 6 months."
Coal Price is still at $177. Why the major dip?
"Oil, gas, and coal are looking VERY good now. $1.2 Trillion Infrastructure vote CANCELED. The green energy sector is dead... for now. $20+ before the end of the year."
They better not be selling coal at 40$ per tonne right now
Look at coal prices woah steep dive to 150-139 the stock is only down 4% I don’t know these stocks weren’t pricing in a lot anyways
HOPE ALL THOSE NEW SHARES GET SOLD INTO MARKET FAST
"Sale on BTU, headed to $30 by end of 2021. Don't fight fundamentals."
"Nothing but down down down since this [excellent] Yahoo report (during the best 2 stock market days in a long time): ""5 Broker-Friendly Stocks to Buy Amid the Current Market Crisis""Peabody Energy BTU: St Louis, MO-based Peabody Energy engages in the coal-mining business and has both thermal and metallurgical operations to manage. Revival in the domestic and international coal markets augurs well for this currently Zacks #2 Ranked stock that outperformed on earnings in three of the last four quarters (lagging the consensus mark in the remaining one). PS Ouch"
"Nice sales pitch. 40% of average volume in 1st 1'30"" of trading. Low volume?"
^^^Why down with Coal UP?
coal price 179.50 and going up!
Looking for a re-entry here. Will we see the $13 handle?
as oil goes up so does everything else related to BTUs China and India are huge consumers of coal But what is not talked about is Europe particularly Germany when it comes right down to it you have a choice you either freeze to death or you Burn coal the political hacks better get something straight they’ll be hanging from polls When push comes to shove if the coal power plants do not run
"12,500,000 new share issuance announced on 9/17/21 to be used to pay down debt."
Good article in WSJ on nat gas prices. Bodes well for coal prices and BTU.
I really regret selling BTU for solar this year. It was one of my biggest mistakes in stocks.
"FOR HEAVENS SAKE: This is one of the craziest acting stocks I have ever seen!!! With the ever-increasing need for coal far into the distance.. and the massive increase in coal price.. there is really no logical reason for BTU stock to not be at least back to where it was back in the ""GOOD DAYS"". Period. Just sayin'..."
"Speed bump, selling a few $19 Sep puts, hoping to buy more in the low $17."
will crash hard half bk company
"Basically past the funds reporting for q3, time for them to load back up with BTU!"
more manipulation hooray
This is a good entry point
180 coal price now
Get your Jengq options (shares) while they are cheap. I feel they have the opportunity to run like BTU did. Similar to others I sold my BTU shares too early (from $1 to $4). GLTA
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Stocks-tracker.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
New E*Trade margin requirement for BTU goes from 75% to 100%. Not cool.
BTU better straighten up. Just the way she likes it.
Isn’t that financially dead?
and the selloff continues for f sakes
This happens every month before options expiration. Look at the price on Aug 20 (last options expiration) and see what happened shortly after. This is a buy the dip opportunity.
"Once this stock takes off, we’ll never again see these prices. When we look back, it’ll seem beyond obvious that we should have bought more at these prices. I remember people flocking away from $BTU less than 9 months ago, when it was $0.80; now it’s closing in on $14. $CLOV to $100."
This is bad for the environment. Big changes coming I got out last week I might even start shorting this one.
I like the momentum of btu. Can it take us to 20-25 ?
Whose buying this dip?
nice day next stop 20
Initiated a position two fingers in might get the whole fist in Monday.
Fuel shortage across the WORLD! BTU to the rescue!
"It started out the day headed for $20.. with market cap of $3 billion. Oops - profit taking. Time to buy at the"" dip""?"
Getting ready to test 52 week highs
anybody else buying?
What is moving this stock????
This thing is NEVER going to stop. We're going on 5-months of green
Has to go over 20 for me to add to my options. I hold so many.
Retirement looking like 5-years instead of 20. Let's go coal.World Wide ShortagePrices at all-time highsWHY IS THIS NOT MOVING?
all the old world commodities that do the heavy lifting in the world are going to go much higher over the next several years all resources are getting scarce Plus the dollar is it its final few years as reset buy the world powers is ready well in progress this is just to begin .

Why down ? It should be up 
NAT GAS MOVING HIGHER TODAY PUSHING COAL STOCKS HIGHER
Buy the dip
money is starting to leave the general stock market and it’s going into energy of all forms you’re going to see billions upon billions of dollars come this way hedge funds money managers pension funds and retail investors the little guy we all want a piece of it because we all know green energy is fairy dust everything else in the market is bloated like a fat pig and the red headed step child energy is now going to turn in to The hottest guy on the planet.
"coal for chinaSept 23 (Reuters) – Strong rates across dry bulk vessel segments drove the Baltic Exchange’s main sea freight index to their highest since 2009 on Thursday.* The overall index, which factors in rates for capesize, panamax, supramax and handysize vessels, rose 91 points, or 2%, to 4,651, to hit its near 12-year peak.* Shipping analysts have attributed the recent rally in the dry bulk market to global shipping constraints, including port congestion in China, and an overall rebound in commodities.* The capesize index increased by 238 points, or 3.3%, to 7,438, also hitting its highest in 12 years.* Average daily earnings for capesizes, which transport 150,000-tonne cargoes such as iron ore and coal, rose by $1,968 to $6,1683.* In the capesize segment, there’s been “very limited amount of available tonnage to meet” healthy volume of cargoes, especially on the West Australia-China route, shipbroker Fearnleys said in a weekly note on Wednesday.* Also, there is limited number of vessels heading for Brazil and the Atlantic, which could impact the segment in days and weeks to come, it added.* Chinese coking coal futures soared to a two-week high as supply concerns resurfaced, pushing prices of steelmaking ingredient coke higher.* The panamax index rose 33 points, or 0.8%, to 3,994, its highest in more than 10 weeks.* Average daily earnings for panamaxes, which ferry 60,000-70,000 tonne coal or grain cargoes, increased by $300 to $35,947.* Among smaller vessels, the supramax index rose for a sixth straight session, adding 11 points to 3,349, its highest in three weeks.

"This is a short term play, 1-3 years. Everyone jumped the gun on clean energy but it is the future not today. You cannot close one power plant without building a new one of some kind. That is what everyone, especially the EU did. Literally close plants. The effect was muted only because of COVID cut consumption from closed industry. Now industry is back.Sure they should be starting clean power plants. But they are not built yet. The only thing available is coal and gas generators. So no choice but to restart them. In five years shut them again but only after clean energy is on line.So being the only game in town, coal is asking whatever they want and are getting it.Tldr nat gas and coal thru this winter then move to clean energy starting mid late next year."
Coal now $ 225
"ADDING TO MATT'S NUMBERS BELOW: (1 ton to charge 50 Teslas) 500,000 Teslas running around probably driving 300 miles a day. Multiply that times Matt's numbers.. AND THAT IS A LOT OF COAL NEEDED JUST ABOUT EVERY DAY. And that is just for Tesla cars! Albeit.. there are some other ""fuels"" involved..."
REDDIT ON IT
Dilution coming
Why is BTU down from its peak? If you look at other coal stocks like ARCH and ARLP they're still at their peaks. Thanks for your informed opinions.
NAT GAS ON RISE AGAIN TODAY SO BTU WILL PROBABLY POP HIGHER
A trader's stock
I want it @25 ! Buy more ! They will warn $10+ ?
"Per S&P, PRB Coal now $16.90 a ton!"
Is today the day that we finally close above $12?
LIKE THAT BTU CAN RUN BIG STRIP MINES 24 HOURS A DAY
"HA, ... Ha ha ha. Wow. Coal prices at $206! Right now.Nice! Peabody go..BTU"
gonna turn green soon. about time.
ALL coal is being blasted last several days. Profit taking. BTU: $20 down to $15.. in about 2 days. Who knew!
^^^Looking like 24-00 on ^BTU^
I sold half of what I had close to the highs of the day and I bought everything back right now no matter how you look at it coal is an issue that is not going away I think we will close back up at the highs of the day there is more and more people every day coming into energy is the most under invested segment of the stock market billions and billions of dollars will be rolling out of the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 over the course of the next several years inflation it’s not transitory at all it’s actually going to continue to keep going up raid hikes will never zero interest rate policy is the name of the game and energy is the name of my game.
Peabody Energy (NYSE:BTU): Q2 GAAP EPS of -$0.26 beats by $0.36.Revenue of $723.4M (+15.4% Y/Y) beats by $35.77M.Adjusted expects EBITDA of $122.1M vs. consensus of $73.4M.

"My goodness, I should not have sold those calls at $5 me thinks. Would someone just exercise on me and put me out of my misery please?"
Consol performing much better..Elliot may be weighing on Btu..
I am feeling Bullish about BTU.
PUTIN STOCKPILE OF NAT GAS SAID TO BE DEPLETED SO HE CANNOT SUPPLY BOTH RUSSIA AND EUROPE THROUGH LONG COLD WINTER PREDICTED FOR REGION-EUROPE DESPERATELY TRYING TO BUY COAL FOR POWER GENERATION!!!!
MANY IN EUROPE ASIA AND U S NOW SAY WITH COLD WINTER PREDICTED THERE IS NOT ENOUGH COAL AND NAT GAS ON HAND IN MOST COUNTRIES!!!!! THEY ARE NOW PREPARING FOR ROLLING BLACKOUTS IN EUROPE/CHINA HAS PROBLEMS NOW!!!
^^^15-00 Close for ^BTU^?
IF ANY LOGIC PREVAILS: coal is a great hedge against the craziness permeating myriad govt actions these days. Why? The more they spend (which they refuse to stop doing) THE MORE AMERICA NEEDS COAL. Just sayin'...
Everybody is upgrading price targets. This means that an equity offering is being proposed and the bankers are lining up for co-lead manager roles. Expect a significant refunding of all debt by 1Q 2022.
Take a look at Lithium prices & $LAC and compare charts with Coal price & $BTU. Interesting pattern similarity in that stock price lags spot prices.
Are shorts covering?
Go BTU... NGU.. let's GO!
I trade in and out of all the energy stocks from natural gas uranium oil and coal natural gas and oil are running nicely today and uranium and coal or down I really think there’s a big pool of people that rotate in and out like I do but I think that is going to change as people begin to realize transitory inflation really means it’s here and it’s going up and everything is derived off of energy and there’s no way around it I’ll dips are buying opportunities as natural gas and oil go up in price coal follow the world switches in and out of whatever fuel is the cheapest that’s what most utilities do in the United States and I’m sure it’s like that in the world but the bottom line is cheap energy is over no matter how much you hate coal it is an integral part of our energy demand.
Drop baby!
Coal jumped up today $15.75 to $234.
do younger generation is fixated on hi tech and anything that your generation has grown up with but we are going to take a step back in time with everything revolves around energy the day of cheap energy is gone forever and as we move forward more and more people and this younger generation he’s going to figure it out very quickly we will be looking at millions and millions of new dollars flowing in this direction over the course of the winter when they get their electric bills Natural gas and oil heating bills the light will come on like a 200 white bulb nothing works in this world without energy
options max pain 14 to 15 after they all expire worthless it resumes the climb to 23
"Coal at a high,for last several years and going higher, this could set records high along with the rest of energy sector. Once in a lifetime opportunity to see a super cycle. I kick myself for not buying more when it set a record low last summer."
"Electricity supply issues in China, problems with Russian natural gas pipeline... Let's see how high this stock can go..."
"Agree with Tom, spread between coal (BTU) gas BIR NOG and CDEV, copper SCCO and even Lithium ETMC and TRQ as the various players figure out which form of energy to play. It is going to be a seesaw back and forth all winter but all will go higher so pick the water level not one particular boat. re AMC vs BTU BTU has an actual foundation, AMC is just a meme and a belief. Both can rise huge but BTU you don't have to time it specifically. I am way too lazy for timing a stock."

When there is not enough natural gas this winter/Uncle Joe at the Shady Rest ( White House ) will come crying to the coal producers to get coal back along with the coal fired utilities---WEC
anyone also owns arch?
"had $rig at .66 people said bankruptcy went to 5, had $btu at .97 said bankrupt went to 19, the yahoo bears have been consitently wrong 100pct of the time on every stock ive ever bought, and i've never been more sure about a stock than i am xela, Under $5 its nothing but free money, you might have to wait till earnings but this stock will explode sometime soon, already did it twice in 2021 before all the amazing news we been getting, debt being paid down is all institutions were waiting for"
Why is no one working up engineering / economic valuations for reprocessing BTU tailings for Rare Earths across at least - some - of the properties? Seems a match made in heaven
"All of stocks related to coal mining is going down. (arch, metc, arlp) . There is no future for coal stock."
BTU is one the top stocks of 2021.
I got in this and I just found out that NASA can't make coal-poweredc space vehicles. Well....they can but they are really heavy and you have to get to your sruising speed before leaving the atmosphere because coal doesn't burn well in space. I feel I was misled by the exuberance of you shareholders and did not get full-dislosure. I plan a lawsuit!
"I don’t understand! The market goes up , Btu goes down. Now, the market goes down and Btu goes down. Total bs all week!"
if you’re into energy and Coal check out MORIEN resource company I’ve already made pretty much money here the symbol APMCF do your own research I’m already up 50% and I traded a lot of different stocks but I like this one this could be a grand slam and I personally think it is
It feels like something just keeps pulling this stock up. Like reverse gravity.
BOYS BELIEVE WE WILL GET DOUBLE IN A FEW WEEKS -MOST BELIEVE BLOWOUT EARNINGS WITH RECORD COAL PRICES NOW AND SHORTAGE OF COAL AROUND WORLD!!!
News claim dow down due to investor fear resurge on C19. This is all a lie for hedge to get our shares low. Hold like AMC and buy more.
call option 15dollar of elliot prevent stock from soaring?
AS NEW SHARES COME TO MARKET-NEW SUPPORT LEVEL AROUND 13 HAS TO HOLD -AFTER THAT JUST PRAY IF STILL HOLDING
HOPING 15.50 holds as bottom
Anyone in this board that owned BTU when they went bankrupt? I lost it all and I can’t believe they issued new shares and I lost all mine.How is that even closely fair.
It looks attractive again after this correction. Heading for for $22-25.
between Powder River Basin pricing and long term fixed price contracts this stock it Bankrupt again in 2023. Play it while you can
WAS ABLE TO GET CHEAP OPTIONS ON BTU

coal price 180 to 185
So last month sold about 12.5mm shares thru B Riley @ $15.55. Have another 12.5mm to sell from time to time thru B Riley if i read the Filings correctly....In addition Elliot sold a little under 2mmshares and still has about 27mmshares..I think i get the pause in the rally..
Sell off today? What happened
35% correction from its high.
ASIA IS SAID TO BE GENERALLY OUTBIDDING EUROPE IN BUYING COAL AND NAT GAS ON SPOT MARKETS AS THEY TRY TO BUILD UP THEIR SUPPLY BEFORE COLD WEATHER HITS AND BLACKOUTS START AS SUPPLY RUNS OUT

"free money, yahoo is nothing but paid bashers, again last fall i was in $btu at .97 they said the same stuff delisting, bankrupt, stock went to $19 in 6 months, $rig was the same thing .66 to $5, they are always 100 pct of the time proven wrong, buying at 1.65 will make you rich, possible 100x if you hold as they grow and go debt free, stock is trading at a .25 price to sales, average for the tech industry is over 5, docu is at 30 and we have the same product, company does over a billion in revenue, people are desperate for cheap shares and short interest was 139 pct on 9/15 check ameritrade website not the fraud sites being paid to conceal the data, these people saying 7 million short shares are delusional, they shorted 100 mil and half are naked shorts, this could be the next gme, be warned"
I don't know where people are getting the number 7.00 from. There are 4 levels of support this thing has to fall through. The vast majority of shareholders are holding long-term for that $55+ in the next 1-2 years. I don't see this dipping below $11.40 (if it continues) before going back up.
^^^King Koal
the company can't afford to pay s debt? why do they issue new stock?
MMS took out all stops so WITH COAL AND NAT GAS AT RECORD HIGHS SHOULS POWER BACK HIGHER
Why is BTU getting #$%$ on this month? It makes zero sense. I follow this company closely and have been invested for a year. I thought it would average back up this week but what the hell? Is this manipulation or what lol
Bought some calls on the dip yesterday let’s get this money good luck to you all!
Ole man Peabody is taking a rest after the recent rapid rise. Expect another move up next week.
"The more manipulation that occurs, the more violent the upswing will be. When I was in $BTU (Peabody Energy) 9 months ago, FUD article after article came out as the price was tanking. ATL was $0.80. Then FUD suddenly stopped. Share price 9 months later is $20. Believe, $CLOV."
just wait until the coal shortage in China story hits the evening news and the average Joe starts to realize that there is a crisis. Rolling blackouts in across China currently in order to conserve coal for the winter are a sign of what is coming. Price of coal will skyrocket once panic sets in.
not only is China having Coal issues now India is having the same problem most of their electricity in India is produced by coal two of the biggest countries in the world use coal this problem is not going away oh I know is BTU is a great trading stock at least it is for me.
"Coal $21 up to $ 267, wow"

It's going over 17-18 today.
What are your price targets for this stock?
I am also kicking myself why I invested in solar since coal is at the run right now. I have been in Sunrun losing.
Seriously? This is an easy $40 stock. Energy shortages aren't going away. Be patient.

"Earnings report will be about 10 AM Thur, eastern time. The thing to look for is increase in Sales.. more than Earnings. Although increase in earnings would be a bonus. There are a lot of strange expenses that might cut into profits (that maybe won't show up)."

MY OPTIONS EXPIRED SO BTU WILL PROBABLY POP NOW SINCE COAL AT RECORD HIGHS AND A SHORTAGE OF COAL AROUND WORLD!!
Acts like large hder is reducing..other coal stocks strong
What’s with all the shorts this week? It’s ridiculous! They don’t even give the stock a chance to run!
This is kinda fun today - taking some off the table.
are we done yet?
FACT: The world will always need coal. For more reasons than can be counted.
oh my goodness.... it's pulling back. ABOUT TIME. 5-months later......
"Quarterly earnings, July 29. If investors like what they hear, resistance is $18.73."

"By the dips they say, by the dips. How can you buy the dips if there are no dips?"
This is a winner.
The more dire and dangerous the America/world situation... the more that coal is needed. Badly!
This company cant pay its debts.
Coal demand soaring. Supply is tight. Prices are at 15 year highs. This is still a bargain IMO.

Coal mining company Peabody Energy $BTU is up 290% this year and this green energy etf is down 20% this year. Which direction are we heading?
I  BTU!!! These dips and peaks are wonderful.
This is going to be a great short.
Coal is more valuable than the dollar IMHO. The world will always need coal.. at least for the next 50 years+. IMHO
"I’d be nervous with $CLOV if I hadn’t gone through this before, especially $BTU 9 months ago. So much FUD & negativity 9 months ago. Then *very suddenly* all the FUD stopped and the stock went from $1 to $20 now. I have faith in $CLOV. FUD won’t deter us. Only makes us stronger."
from peak to trough today it’s almost a two dollar move there’s a Lotta trading in this stock but the bottom line is it’s going up oh and it’s some point in time we just go vertical for day after day.
AMC started the year with same Market Cap ($2Bil) that BTU has now. Now AMC's is $20Bik. Can't wait for BTU to follow that trend.
"There’s been a lot of negativity due to the sp drop recently, but this stock is a triple from here. Coal is exploding in price and the supply response will take longer due to esg. Management just came to an agreement at Shoal Creek, so more production will soon follow. Lots of catalysts on the horizon."

U.S. power plants are on track to burn 23% more coal this year. BTU up 1300% from election day. Thanks Joe.
Why is there never any news from BTU headquarters? Do they even have a PR section? PS The worse things get in America (and the world) the MORE coal is needed.
"Nothing has changed, coal continues to sit at multiple decade highs. Be patient, pullbacks are healthy. Looking at at least $35-40 before this cycle ends."
"Yes there is a climbing energy demand right now, but they can’t start charging customers more because of this. It’s going to take time for this stock to catch up from all the drama last month in the market. I am going long on this and I will see you all in November when earnings are out."
when the initial reaction in the stock was negative to a good earnings result I just loaded up some more shrs at $9.79 this am. Glad to see it rebound quickly but honestly you need to buy on these pullbacks.
Why this huge drop
Load up !!
NOW BTU HEADING HIGHER AS BUYING PRESSURE PICKS UP
"Well drats, I bought this thing at $2 and covered with calls when it got to $5 because no way would it go to $12 very fast would it? Epic fail, maybe someone will exercise on me and put me out of my misery, but hey a three bagger still ain't bad."
2 months ago Institutions held 90% of BTU stock. Now it is down to 60%. WHO'S THE DUMMY? PS Coal is needed now just about more than ever before. Badly.
could of sold at 11 holding thru earnings good luck everyone!
I sold half my shares Close to the high of the day and I bought them all back now again I know at some point in time this will stop and it’s just vertical.
"It's either buy AMC or buy BTU. Not sure which, BTU is good longterm but AMC could be good short term."
BTU SUPPORT 15.90
just remember if natural gas is on fire it’s all about chasing BTUs it kind of seems every day we rotate between the three or four major sources of energy that’s fine with me I have them all and I rotate with him but at some point in time this comes to an end and you’re all straight up vertical keeping core positions are important you least expect it the big move will come.
