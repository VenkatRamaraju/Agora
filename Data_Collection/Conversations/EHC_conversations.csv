Impressive comprehensive document on EHC's website for investors. Excellent overview of company. It is worth reviewing even though it is over 100 pages. No wonder the stock is rising. Management knows how to do a first class job. Kudos!
Sell Sell Sell!!! I work at a dental office in Denver where we see a lot of Encompass employees... most have reduced hours because they don’t have enough patients to treat. The sales team is afraid to go into the assisted living facilities because of COVID-19. A lot of their clientele has died off in this recent pandemic.￼
