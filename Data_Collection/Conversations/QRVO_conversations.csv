"Semi got hit hard the last few days. I will rebound, how long for that to happen who knows. Alot of companies are starting to hire. The best companies will survive."
"QRVO is too cheap to pass up. Under fair value, an actual chip manufacturer, and huge play in 5G. One of my new long term holdings."
"Shortages are real Apple has known about this for over ONE year IMHO they might be affected somewhat but it will not be earth shaking. I remember when Triquint had a problem with the supply of chips to Apple it reduced earnings but they protected Apple the suppliers to Apple will find a way to protect Apple, not 100% but also not killing filling most of the demand."
Qorvo has lost a multiple of experienced maintenance techs. Lately they have been hireing ex- military with no experience. There are over 40 opening positions. Wish them luck in filling those. Hope it won't affect the up time of their semi- conductor equipment. Only time will tell.

"All I know is, I would have made lots of money selling this at 195....I am adding here, and I hope it gets back to that price shortly."
Approaching Quintuple support. Hope it holds
An incredible buying opportunity here to buy on overreacted inflation fears causing such a deviation. Actual semiconductor manufacturing companies like QRVO and SWKS are about to experience the greatest amount of growth ever. Semiconductor manufactures and semiconductor equipment companies are in a very unique and special placein the market/economy/world right now. Nothing but unprecedented growth and earnings ahead.
"Death Cross inevitable for QRVO, SWKS, and QCOM. Hard to discern where they may drop to"
"QRVO best value in the market, it should easily go above $200 soon,"
"The entire semiconductor sector appears to be under fire from so called ""analysts"" that are actually jack-of-all-trades but masters of NONE. Their archaic thinking in traditional cyclical rotations of the semiconductor industry is forcing stocks prices lower. Even when most chip and equipment companies are crushing earnings, are producing at max capacity, increasing prices, and raising guidance. Global demand would be high regardless of any shortage. 5G, AI, EV, crypto, data centers, cloud tech, gaming, eSports were already ensuring this growth and demand. Now add the new infrastructure spending and the global ""arms race"" that's taking place. We are in the beginning of a super cycle like never seen, likely lasting many years. Semiconductors are the new #1 global resource....the new oil.(Fabless) companies like $NVDA, $AMD, $MRVL, $AVGO, $QCOM design the most advanced and sought after semiconductors in the world. (Fab-owning) companies like $TSM, $TXN, $ADI, $QRVO manufacture the chips. Companies like $AMAT, $ASML, $LRCX, $KLAC, $UCTT, $ICHR make all the equipment and materials used by those chip manufacturers. High tide raises all boats! .....and many of these companies are already currently undervalued. GLTA"
"Silicon shortage scaring investors, so bears are taking it down. That will make the upside that much more dynamic"
"GREENSBORO, N.C., Feb. 03, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Qorvo (Nasdaq:QRVO), a leading provider of innovative RF solutions that connect the world, today announced financial results for the Company’s fiscal 2021 third quarter, ended January 2, 2021.On a GAAP basis, revenue for Qorvo’s fiscal 2021 third quarter was $1.1 billion, gross margin was 49.1%, operating income was $299 million and diluted earnings per share was $1.74.

We are sustaining technology leadership in these markets and innovating in new ones including biotechnologies. In January, the National Institutes of Health selected Qorvo for its program to add COVID-19 testing capacity.”"
"According to analysis firm Yole Development, which analyzed abasket of flagship smartphones from Apple, Samsung, Huawei,Oppo, and Xiaomi for 2018-2019, Qorvo had a leading share inRF front end, thanks to the multiplicity of products provided. Thatput Qorvo ahead of Murata, Skyworks, Broadcom, andQualcomm, among others. From a research report"
"If everyone is so bearish on the semis....maily QRVO, SWKS, QCOM, NXPI then why haven't their estimates been lowered for coming quarters? QRVO just stated in their ""fireside chat"" that they still felt comfortable with their guidance."
It is so low. What are you scared about?!
"Jim Cramer from Mad Money has Marvell, Qorvo and Skyworks in his 5G top 3. So far they are all doing great. 5G is going to be absolutely massive. $MRVL $QRVO $SWKS"
Company stock option grants expiring 9/8/21. Is driving the selling. Insiders cashing in. Any uptick is being hit.
"QRVO will be at $250 soon. fundamentals looks great,"
"QRVO unjustifiably getting hit for no reason lately. This is a $200 stock minimum. Very undervalued atm. Forward PE under 14 and with a PEG of 1. Revenue is up over 40% yoy. Earnings have almost doubled in that time. Adjust gross margin up over 52%. Earnings are expected to grow at a minimum 16% a year for the next 5 years. Along with QCOM, QRVO is the premier mobile 5G play."
"Like Little Richard pointed out so elegantly ""Whole Lotta Riggin' Goin' On"""
Where is LAWRENCE?
"QRVO might see a 30% haircut from its recent highs. Already broken all support. Still a long term hold, but currently severely out of favor"
This is headed to 100$ easy by mid 2022. Sales are slowing BIG time!
My chart is telling me that $165.7 is a good entry point. Small risk below that.
what do you thinking about the stock? i did my own research and its seems to me like a good company with a good data. am i missing something? do you think its a good time to invest in this company?
Can someone tell me what’s going on with QRVO?
Sell off a bit overdone. Ya think?
Is there a connection between Qorvo and Triqint In relation to Applel?

Very oversold and undervalued. A forward PE of only 12 and a PEG of 1.00.
"Bank America Merrill LynchIn a semi industry report on Sept 17 reiterated their 225$ Our $225 price objective is based on 17x our CY22E Non-GAAP EPS (excluding stockcomp), at the higher end of its long-term 8x-20x range but justified given the upcomingmajor product ramps and less customer concentration relative to peers."
"Just take a step back and take a look at what is going on....fabless companies $NVDA $AMD and now $QCOM all reporting incredible ER's with tremendous growth WITH very positive guidance going forward. Semi manufactures like $TSM $TXN all reporting beats with significant growth and constantly guiding upwards with positive outlooks going forward. Other manufacturers like $QRVO and $SWKS will likely reports similar strong ER's this week. Semi equipment companies like $ASML (destroyed earnings) $LRCX $AMAT are and will likely continue reporting even more significant earnings and growth due to unprecedented demand. The semiconductor industry is looking outstanding right now and has an even brighter future. ER's are reflecting this nicely. I'm severely bullish on this industry right now and many of the stocks, particularly semi equipment stocks are looking like value plays ($AMAT and $LRCX especially undervalued)."
Barclays upgraded Qorvo from Equal-Weight to Overweight and set a new price target of $200.00 from $185.00 previously
Way oversold and undervalued. QRVO is increasing market share over competitors with tremendous growth. Outlook is fantastic!
Holding but losing patience.
"From Merrill todayQorvo Inc. (QRVO)Our $225 price objective is based on 17x our CY22E Non-GAAP EPS (excluding stockcomp), at the higher end of its long-term 8x-20x range but justified given the upcomingmajor product ramps and less customer concentration relative to peers."
"Ford is spending over 11 billion just to build the plant. I can only imagine how much revenue QORVO has the potential to earn with this huge demand for electric vehicles. I have read past PR's about Ford and other manufacturers using RF chips from Qorvo.I have read PR releases about QORVO and Ford which makes me think their will be plenty of ""Qorvo Inside"" of these Ford and other brand electric vehicles."
"Well I still see semi's are etting mistreated.....and they were already bargains before this market temper tantrum. Now they are just insanely cheap! Should be a great time to buy. They are going to bounce back up as soon as everyone realizes their concerns about the industry's ""cycle"" is not happening. We are still in the beginning of a decade or more long super cycle. The industry has evolved! $TSM $KLAC $ASML $AMAT $QRVO $UCTT $ICHR $MRVL"
The problem with this stock is the massive shortage in the semiconductor sector. The demand is there. If you believe supply will eventually reach to demand well this is a great investment in the long run. But for now I would keep an eye on it.
