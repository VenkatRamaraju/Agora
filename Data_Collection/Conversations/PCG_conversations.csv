"PG&E CORP ( PCG ) - AS OF 5 P.M. MONDAY EVENING, POWER HAS BEEN RESTORED TO APPROXIMATELY 92% OR 580,000 OF THOSE CUSTOMERS"
"PG&E restores power to 99% of customers...big successful task, hopefully the media reports on the good work."
just remember we are entering the most favorable time of year for stocks
PGE had all hands on deck and did a great job. I live in the foothills and our power was restored in 12hours. PGE is in a great position in my opinion to capture more upside. If your a value investor this has easy upside potential! My humble guess is by February we should be over 13.. California is a construction zone and there’s still a lot of mid rise projects going up and including remodels and planned communities. I have family business that supplies building materials and we haven’t slowed down at alll. Yes it takes longer to get materials and prices have gone up but the buyers are out there.. Low interest rates keep this economy moving.. I’m still confused over this insane market like everyone else but the simple fact is we need power to run our lives and PGE is in a great position to do even better..
i think someone here once said this is a coiled spring ready to pop up....it sure feels like it
"Rain rain let it rain lots of cost for PCG crews OT etc etc, but guess what who pays the rate payer with increase service costs more revenue for PG&E which should pop the stockprice"
yahoo has a Performance Outlook metric....and all three are pointing to the stock green!recommendation rating is also a buy!good luck to those supporting this company!
"Accelerating Toward a Clean Transportation Future, PG&E Proposes Next Milestone in Building California’s Electric Vehicle Charging InfrastructureBY Business Wire— 12:13 PM ET 10/28/2021Plan for Approximately 16,000 New Charging Ports Further Reduces a Common Barrier to EV AdoptionSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E (PCG)) announced it has proposed the next major milestone in building the electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure for Northern and Central California. If approved by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), the proposal would continue to drive customer EV adoption as PG&E (PCG) works to support California’s bold climate and clean air goals.PG&E’s proposal builds on the success of its recently completed EV Charge Network program by installing new infrastructure for 16,000 additional charging ports including Level 2 EV chargers, supporting multifamily housing residents in particular with onsite, workplace and public destination charging options.Additionally, PG&E (PCG) proposes installing both Level 2 EV chargers and fast chargers at publicly accessible locations including shopping centers, local government buildings, and park-and-ride lots. Public charging is critical to increasing EV adoption, as it builds driver confidence in their ability to charge away from home and provides access to drivers who do not have residential charging.“Expanding the use of electric vehicles is essential for California to achieve its bold climate and clean-air goals. With this proposed program, we believe we can continue doing our part to expand EV charging infrastructure for our customers, which is a critical component of increasing EV adoption. We value our role as an active partner in helping make EVs an option for millions of Californians. Reducing vehicle emissions is good for our state and good for the environment,” said PG&E’s Aaron August, Vice President, Business Development and Customer Engagement."
Adding to my position if PGE goes in either direction!

no one expected $11.68 before Q3 earnings. if you're short i hope you get ripped a new bung
PG&E Inc. has a lower P/E ratio when compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the Electric Utilities industry and to me shows the stock is undervalued.negative wallstreet manipulators are still with us. but this earnings report will show this company is performing better.
"Very low volume today. Expecting some institutions buying to come at the end and will close 11.90 -12.00.Once the fire season is over, no more PSPS, no quick trigger settings to cut the power off. Market likes it already but still not overvalued."
