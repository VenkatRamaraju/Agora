"Huang s leather Jacket is certainly a part of a much larger collection, maybe including a gimp suit for a play with Klaus Schwab...."
VIX is slightly higher but VXN is unchanged. A greater indicator that it will be a positive day . Also both Europe and Asia are up except for one Asian market. Again a great indicator that it will be an up day . And finally when the previous Friday ends higher there is over 90% chance that the following week will be higher . And as you recall we ended higher on last Friday.
In spite of the nefarious propaganda and lies and spreading false hood and fake news NVIDIA still will end positively. You figure it out yourself you two timers as to why this great company is so wonderfully placed and likely will go to $500 post split.
"What a beautiful close today. Our next resistance is $ 255.65/s, RSI(14): 67.75, that is awesome. Lots of room to move higher. Does ye all shorty agree with me? lol Peace and cheers!"
"Tesla, Amazon, Samsung, and the British Government all nix the ARM $NVDA merger. I can't post the links."
Does anyone know what options are available after Elon Musk has rejected the ARM merger? It is up slightly in premarket which means some people haven't heard about it yet. This should get more press so people can make logical investing decisions based on Nvdia not being able to close on the ARM deal. I would suggest more people follow Elon Musk on Twitter so they could have known right away that Elon rejected the merger deal.
"So Elon Musk has concerns over NVIDIA's acquisition of ARM. I guess we should have concerns over Elon Musk buying lithium mines for his Tesla batteries! That is, lithium/lithium carbonate that may also be used in his competitor's vehicles. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-28/musk-said-to-oppose-nvidia-s-planned-takeover-of-arm-telegraph"
"IF Nvidia was added to the Dow Jones, it'd be the 3rd largest component by market cap:https://companiesmarketcap.com/dow-jones/largest-companies-by-market-cap/"
NVDA is a winner going forward with or without the ARM deal. Elon Musk has shown time and time again that his comments and actions are always self serving for his financial interests.
Yeah I got super lucky. I bought in when it dropped to $190 a weed ago. Didn’t research anything. Just knew NVIDIA had to be doing good right now. They can’t even keep there graphics cards on the shelf.
"I'm surprised that Yahoo still has a '1-year' forecasted target of 200.56 for NVDA. You would think they'd be ""smart enough"" to update that."
"Despite the acquisition of ARM unsuccessfully, NVDA is worth more money. Forget the dessert!"
I would be buying more but have no money. It is all invested in NVDA. I think I am going to have to resort to pan handling to get a cup of coffee tomorrow morning. It is the best problem I have ever had.
NVIDIA NEW ALL TIME HIGHS!!!!!!!! CONGRATULATIONS NVIDIA SHAREHOLDERS.....THE BEST IS YET TO COME......$1000 IN 5 YEARS OR LESS.
ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!!!!CHO CHOO TO NEW ALL TIME HIGHS! $250 EOY....$1000 IN 5 YEARS.
Nice opportunity to nibble and add some more NVDA on this minor pullback on some periodic profit-taking in the early going.
"ARM deal does not go through next month, NVDA needs to give Softbank $1.25 billion breakup fee. Oh no !"
It’s a great time to nibble on this pause because there is a lot of runway left in this NVDA post earnings rally — when you look out 3 to 5 years!
Any chance Jensen will be able to convince Elon Musk to reverse his rejection of the ARM deal? Without approval I don't see much out there that can move the stock.
Wow NVDA is flying again. Where will be at the end of August? Is $230/s possible? What are the shorty say? Peace!
So maybe the pull back is a manipulation of the stock right before the approval of the ARM deal ?.
Some of you drama queens are indicating Nvidia is down in the future market. So I checked and it is down 33 cents. Isn’t that an overreaction on the part of the drama people? Yes it is!
"Excellent profit taking volume today —- that’s now set the stage for a rally from this current level to a new, and “strong sustained NVDA rally”to fresh all time highs into the next level in this upside trend!!!"
"There's no stopping the upside for this winner.......run by a terrific CEO, this stock will continue its ascent."
Price holding up well today following power rally.
"To be honest, I tought Elon Musk comment on the ARM deal would make this stock falling. I guess it is a very nice suprise!"

"This message is for the young people who want to start an investment plan. As recent as ten years back when Tim Cook took over Apple and had you invested $1,000 you would be worth $12,970 today.Now comes the great part.

Continue adding to your investments on a regular basis and WOW you will be surprised at your net worth in due course"
It’s a good day. Muted 20? so far.
Wonderful wonderful opportunity buy nvda now
It’s obvious today’s bashers not happy with today’s gains.
"UK is getting a deal they can’t refuse with NVDA/ARM! EU will follow the UK and approve. China is being very accommodating, approving ADI/MXIM, MARV/INPH, CSCO/Acacia etc. Jensen will work it through the US.Good Luck Longs!"
Buying again today once market opens. 300 is coming soon!
"NASDAQ and NVDA chartsThe last major dip of the Nasdaq was when many businesses were subject to pandemic-related shutdown (or remote work for employees) on March 16, 2020 which ended the day at 6,879 points. As of this writing, the NASDAQ is at 15,248 = 122% return. On March 16, 2020 NVDA dipped to $51.44 (post-split adjusted). As of this writing, NVDA is at $228 = 343% return which gives the NASDAQ a really nice boost. Look at the charts.What we are seeing here is a period of the greatest creation of wealth in the tech sector, and it's not over by a long shot. With the world eventually coming out of the pandemic, the tech sector will continue to flourish. NVDA is leading the way because it's involved in so many industries of the present and the future ... it has become a powerhouse. Will NVDA catch up to the other tech companies with trillion dollar valuations? I believe so ... in due time. And I am enjoying the ride."
After looking at the most recent quarter and at what rate the revenues and earnings are growing I wasn't surprise to see the 300.00 price target by Analyst Moseman. Overall with this kind of growth stock price will likely double from the 190.00 level just prior to reporting quarterly earnings and revenues a year from now.
ARM or no ARM deal. Nvidia is the future and will be here to stay.
Goody Morning. Futures are up for all the indicators. I sayeth we will cross $225. Yes siri bob I was hoping $235 but hope is great along with faith ain't it ain't it. Thanko..BABBA and his Friends. Thanko very much
Listened to the whole CC and it was clearly a work of ART painted by that artist named Jensen. Listening to Jensen orchestrate the call was like watching Tom Brady run an offense or Magic Johnson run the fast break. Jensen had the fund managers eating out the palm of his handZ Why? Because he had the goods. NVDA reported great guidance and no issues going forward with any chip shortage. He said at the end that the Metaverse can be his biggest driver in the future years. Data Centers and Gaming are just scratching the surface of how big they will be for NVDA. This is a stock that will double…….. and then double again IMHO. Yes it was that good. Vamos! 
My God! So many greens all over the board : FB intel google Nasdaq Toyota most of the other chip stocks Amazon Russell index . Point is it is green across the board and we should turn green too
"Hey everyone - Please recognize that Elon's shooting off his mouth again is just ""diversionary tactics"". Elon's autonomous Telsa vehicle crashed into a Police car over the weekend.

I like both NVDA and AMD. NVDA is ex dir 31/08 and a small Div on 23/09. AMD nothing. You are looking long term growth. I think most will win in the future. Look at the possible competion
"We have the purchasing power that will maintain the price of our company's shares.Vanity will kill you, Elon Starting tomorrow, 200,000 shares will be purchased in Nvidia for a month ."
So a few people on this board are saying that Musk has that much power to tank this stock.
232 close today
So much for a stock 'languishing' for months after a split. NVDA is headed for $250 right quick.
230 coming soon
I guess Barron’s wish is to keep fanning the Musk story. WON’T matter in the end though. Nothing will stop this!!
New all time highs Monday with nothing but blue skies ahead. NAS starts its exhaustion top scenario. Might see $300 very quickly here
Does Nvidia really need ARM deal to go through ? lol.
Model 3 Tesla hits police car in Orlando while in auto pilot. I think Elon needs better chips maybe NVDAs
"With this company's current market cap, you could buy Intel, AMD, Micron, On Semiconductor, and have $100B left over. Wow..."
it's going to hit 240 tomorrow after so many negative articles...Musk is upset as he is not getting what he wants
"Good Morning ladies and gentlemen of the jury: I sayeth we will cross $225 today. No iffie and buttie about it guys. Have faith and then we have a great company, great product and Gosh the Demand is flying to the seventh sky. Frankly that also applies to the entire chip sector as well. Thanko..BABBA and friends..Thanko"
we could see $250 by this week. What sayeth yo ladies and gentlemen of the jury. Frankly dearly this sweetie pie is worth $500 post split. Yes siri bob maketh fun of me but yo better buy more or will regret it. Thanko...BABBA and friends
Why is Elon Musk so terrified of Nvidia? Because Nvidia will own the AI market.
"Funny how some here feel the need to post the number of shares or options they have bought or sold, like anyone here cares. Then someone else turns around and berates someones comments by insinuating they only own 5 shares. FFS grow up. Remember there is always someone bigger, tougher, faster, stronger, better looking , and richer than you. Be humble and be nice. Good luck, I hope you all make money."
"BUY NVDA — not only for its most recent “blow out Qtr earnings report”, but, BUT for the “bright and shining” future direction of expanding global juggernaut business!"

Got to laugh at investors selling because some jealous competitor says something that the regulators are already aware. No reasonable investor is going to listen to Musk and his pettiness.
$300 very soon Just remember that .. very soon guys I swear Good luck for all

"All Those Opposed to the ARM deal, please raise your hands. Let’s see: UK USA CHINA Govts , Amazon , QCOM, Musk. Looks like ARM is DOA. …. ARM was the only thing NVDA has left to scrape for after they got run out of town on BTC mining chips. NVDAs best days are in the rear view mirror now. Big Sell!"
"sure all the other related companies are working on catching up, and competing, but NVDA is spending 1.8 billion each Q on R&D. no one will ever catch up. this is the greatest investment of the TwentyTwenties decade."
Down but not out. Moreover the whole market was down . We will recover tomorrow plus more. Cheers and keep smiling
Sir Salamander where are you sir? Can you resurface ? Can you go long? Can you get bullish on the world’s biggest and best economy and the world’s biggest and best markets? Also just to let you know Fidelity new accounts are higher by 19% and Charles Schwab new accounts are sharply higher and this Sunday’s Financial Report stated that 401k plans investments have risen sharply and also very important and impressive is the fact that countries such as Norway Denmark Sweden Canada Germany etc are investing their pension funds in United States equities. We already know China India Japan Britain etc etc already invest in our markets as well because frankly ours is the most stable and profitable economy and market in the world.
Nvidia GPUs are impossible to find and people are willing to pay almost twice the launching price. For me this is an amazing sign.
Jensen is in a league of his own. We are truly blessed to live in his time.
bashers really excited today! a $3 pullback in days and they are acting like they are winning. someone remind them Nvidia is up $32 since ER!
Musk is shaking the arm deal must be going through. 250 here we come
Just put in my buy orders for Monday. 15 shares in my cash account at $225 and 15 shares in my 401k at $225. Easy double from here....good luck to my long brethren!
Just hold guys. don't panic lol. it will go up 230
U.S. near deal for Nvidia supercomputer as it waits for delayed Intel machine -sourceshttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-near-deal-nvidia-supercomputer-190754396.html
"NVIDIA historical data is a clear indicator that NVDA is one of the equities traders should consider having on their portfolios delivering such impressive returns this year. A robust growth in revenue and earnings, NVIDIA corporation expects $6.8 billion in revenue this quarter basically translating into a 44% year over year increase. Tesla's red flag on NVDA is somewhat bias, though his opposition didn't do much since shares still ended up 0.2% Monday."
"the final paragraph of the ELON MUSK article on opposing the ARM buy by NVDA it's going to happen""Nvidia is likely to seek European Union antitrust approval for the $54 billion purchase of Arm early next month, with regulators expected to launch a full-scale investigation after a preliminary review, people familiar with the matter have said""."
"230-240 today, I think..."
"From today’s Benzinga article about Nvidia: “NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) is currently priced 39.0% above its average consensus analyst price target of $137.02.” Not only are they incorrect declaring the average analyst price is 137, but Nvidia’s price is significantly more than 39% more than $137. “They are even wrong about their mistakes.”"
"Think about it: if Musk is worried, it’s because he knows the deal is likely to pass."
Up next week ?? Last year market sold off right after Labor Day !?!

"OOPS!Morningstar, Abhinav Davuluri, July 2017:Morningstar analyst Abhinav Davuluri yesterday issued a mammoth, 60-page research note digging into numerous aspects of “machine learning” and artificial intelligence, and concluding that contrary to popular wisdom, Intel (INTC) may stand a better chance than Nvidia (NVDA) in some portions of the chip market for such tasks.Nvidia’s being the “winner” in A.I. is “not a foregone conclusion,” writes Davuluri, quoting from Conan Doyle’s “The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,” in which the detective advises ""There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.” That quote ""aptly describes our view on Nvidia’s implied dominance in artificial intelligence.""Same Morningstar analyst, May 2018:Cloud demand is stronger than ever, but Morningstar analyst Abhinav Davuluri says the market may have gotten ahead of itself in valuing Nvidia's business. Davuluri says Intel will ultimately be the AV market leader.Bank of America has a ""buy"" rating and $340 price target for Nvidia. Davuluri has an ""overvalued"" rating and $120 fair value estimate for NVDA stock.Same Morningstar analyst, July 2021:Morningstar analyst Abhinav Davuluri likes Nvidia but thinks it’s way overvalued.

I've been long NVDA since March 2020. I only tune in to this message board on down days for the comedy from the shorts.
probably the best decision i have made all year was to buy NVDA the day of the split. up 20% since that day. And i know this is just the beginning. I just wish i bought more LOL. (like everyone always says)
"So much for Elon Musk's influence...up premarket.The ARM deal can go through, or it can be blocked but either way it is a win/win for both ARM and Nvidia, who have been partnering for years."
"Nvidia will reach a trillion market cap at 324.00 a share. Even now Nvidia has a price target issued by one of the top analyst in the country at 300.00 a share which would put them in the ballpark of a trillion dollar market cap. With the ARM Deal Nvidia will control autonomous diving, game technology, artificial intelligence, smartphone technology and others. What's interesting is the fact that the Great Britain may be in a pickle as some believe that if the ARM Deal goes though they stand to gain jobs. If it doesn't we are hearing they will lose jobs. Further even if the deal doesn't go through Nvidia has a ton of money and will start doing buy backs on stock. Either way I believe it's a close to call deal that just may go Nvidia's way because of behind the scene's actions. Clearly either way Nvidia is likely to be the next trillion dollar market cap in United States."
Intel can't deliver on supercomputer build. Yet another EPIC FAIL for $INTC. Government won't return to Intel for future supercomputers. U.S. government extremely disappointed with false Intel promises. Invest in the real chip stocks $AMD and $NVDA.
I maintain my belief and conventions that NVIDIA is headed to $500
China is cracking down on gaming. Nvidia cards should be available for cheap on ebay soon.
Tremendous day and incredible roll we’ve been on. Pretty much a long term no- brainer as they come. Hard to find a stock as well positioned in so many hot markets as NVDA. I guess some people just don’t get it and not in the cards to make money. Ain’t happening for them.

With Elon Musk raising a red flag on the ARM deal is there a path forward left for Jensen? I'm thinking it will be extremely difficult to find anyone else who will approve this merger. Are we aware of someone out there that could perhaps sway Elon?
Lot of chip stocks are up. Buy Nvidia and buy FSELX which has Nvidia as a top holding. You can look at other Family of Funds too. But I love Fidelity

Buy on fundies and Technicals…. Sell on technicals. Tons of volume coming in from institutions. You think that’s going to stop because of Elon? Give me a break.
Why is everyone here concerned with the musk comment? It’s likely he wanted to secure nvidia chips to help fix issues with his driverless cars. And he was told to wait in line. People with power don’t like to hear the word no so they usually fight back with any means possible.
Why are all of the articles about the ARM deal now saying it's a $54B deal instead of the original $40B??
NVDA owns the Metaverse. A world we will all be living in soon powered by NVidia. It will be their biggest TAM in the near future. Just a recurring great story for the House of Jensen. 
Amazing stock. Held on to its gains all day. Refused to give back any. Like trying to take away a bone from a Rottweiler. Ain’t happening. 
next time you see $200 is when they split 3 for 1 @ $600

"There's no comparing musk to Jen. The former is not capable of running a company. ""The August 2018 tweet resulted in Musk and Tesla reaching a settlement of fraud charges with the SEC. The settlement included $40 million in penalties, split equally between the company and Musk, and the removal of Musk as chairman of the Tesla board."""
"Lessons learned:You should ""NEVER"" sell NVDA shares and buy when it dips.Especially when they just reported blow out earnings report."
"NVDA’s recent Q2 earnings, and bullish forward guidance is positive proof that the business has “leapfrogged into another level of outperformance, by having the right products at the right time to lead in another strong era of change —- in diverse tech sectors — sparked by the “compression of time” in an ongoing wave of innovation in the current global upgrade cycle!*** It’s from that perspective that NVDA is trading at a HUGE discount for the cognoscenti tech sector with a 3 to 5, or 8 year horizon!"
The entire market is turning positive now. Have faith
"Zacks article, listed here on Yahoo Finance Nvidia: Although NVIDIA NVDA won't be mentioned by any software analysts in their Rule of 40 calculations, I happen to believe that what supports a 20X price/sales valuation for this unique GPU chip maker is its heavy reliance on hardware + software stacks to make ""massively parallel architectures"" accessible and useful for corporations and scientific research institutions doing heavy data mining, modeling, and automation/AI development.This is what institutional investors have finally recognized as NVDA has surged this summer and become a must-own in the FANGMAN suite."

"Nvidia chips, here there & everywhere>>>>>$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$"
Dramatic turnaround in progress. Definitely end positively today
I see the bashers here throwing out $ figures of today’s nvidia/market losses. I don’t think there was one of them who had their math right. All are way over Exaggerating and comparing numbers to pre split prices so losses sound even bigger.
"Nvidia is right. So long as TSM and Samsung are producing the chips for them and all their competitors, software is what will define Nvidia from the rest. Luckily, Nvidia has at least a good 2-4 years lead in this front."
JUST REMEMBER $NVDA 6 YEARS AGO WAS 5.44 AND IT GREW TO 900.00 WITHOUT THE SPLIT AND THEY HAVE COMPETITION AND WE DONT SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT LOL FUNNY THING IS BACK IN EARLY 2000'S IT WAS THE ONLY GRAPHICS CARD I WOULD USE FOR ONLINE GAMES AND IT WAS 1.76
Everyone on FASH MONEY just now are ALL positive on this name. Believe there will be more upgrades shortly. Future earnings justify share price. Not a cheap name BUT investors looking at future earningsand not just share price.
I've made really good money with TSLA puts!!
"Buy the dip , if you wanna make more"
Amazon and Tesla scared of a little competition in the semiconductor industry. Only a better signal to buy on the dip for NVDA.
Here’s the dip for y’all. BUY BUY BUY

Artificial Intelligence which contributed $2 Trillion to the GDP 3 years ago is projected to increase more than 7 fold to $15 Trillion in the next 9 years. The biggest benefactor from this will be NVDA the leader in AI. IMHO. This company has so many powerful drivers hurling it forward that it’s hard to keep up. NVDA a proud member of my 4 Horsemen

So to put it simply, no, it is definitely not too late to buy Nvidia stock."

People have been bashing me since approx. $37.50 ($150 per spilt) for my $400 ($1600) target. At lot has happened since. My target has risen to $800 ($3200) - and we are getting a little closer each day. Nvidia is king. All hail the king!
Great News - 250 open!
Funny how 4% is considered a pullback..lol
NVDA a powerhouse with or without ARM. Check a 5 year chart
Finished up a great day of golf and .. oh!!! .. did NVDA hit a new high!!!… Oh Yes!!!
The nefarious propaganda that NVIDIA management is selling some of their shares is hilarious. First of all so what if they sold some of their holdings. Second for every seller there is a buyer and that constitutes the price! Do I see the price of Nvidia going down ? Absolutely not! Which means the buyers are willing to pay a higher price which means they have confidence and faith in the company’s future performance. So in summary dear shorts please chill out and don’t make a mountain of a molehill.
Sales and Profits are powering the momentum. Not over yet imo
Bought a significant position in NVDA about a month before the split and its been fantastic. At the time the upcoming split was the main driver but the fact that they had multiple lines of revenue growth was a deciding factor.I do believe NVDA is a good long term buy. Slightly longer term I'm also concerned that if they don't close the ARM deal that may have a short term negative affect on the stock price.I put a 15% trailing stop loss on all my positions by default this allows for market volatility and gives me a safety net in case of sudden crash. Recently had my AMZN position sell after hitting the stops.

"so when did the arm deal become $54B? seeing that number a lot this morning. is everyone getting it wrong, or is it just me?"
"We anticipate the $NVDA ARM deal will be officially dead in one month, NVDA's PE and SP will collapse quickly! Sell NVDA and buy AMD is the only way out!"

"Nice Stats from Market Insider: Nvidia is up more than 225% in the past three years. And since its IPO in 1999, NVDA stock is up nearly 51,000%. NVDA stock is one of the best choices for anyone bullish on an increasingly tech-driven world. It’s so deeply embedded in the core of the tech sector that it will continue to grow for years to come. Right now, we’re in the middle of a big chip shortage. And that’s great for NVDA stock. It’s up 73% year to date and 72% in the past 52 weeks. This bull run has plenty of legs left. https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nvda-stock-is-having-a-great-year-for-good-reasons-1030766384"

As I posted a few days ago lots of pressure from option market makers to drop under 220 at Friday close. Hot money redditors got burned so they are not going to cause buying pressure and I institutional buyers happy to see a pullback to accumulate shares ..
Look like that Cramer is accurate of recommending the NVDA this time
You guys should listen to Facebooks 2q earnings call and Zuckerbergs comments about metaverse. He spent the opening minutes on the call explaining the importance of this new market and that was interesting. But even more interesting is that during the Q&A he was asked what other companies would be drivers in this and he specifically mentioned Nvidia because of the importance of its technology. The scope of the graphics that they are talking about is mind blowing. Nvidia will be a driving force on this for years. Potential is pretty mind blowing
"Much ado about nothing. They're piling on the ARM stories because why? Well, the approval process by the U.K. and China has to unfold, and we knew it would take many months, even years to accomplish. The investing world knew this when NVDA announced the takeover last year. So this price weakness is the result.Most, if all, the analysts recent PT's don't include the ARM deal into consideration, and most are quite a bit higher than the current price. When the hysteria dies down, and it will, NVDA will move up quickly."
Options pressure the stock. Exercised calls are sold. The stock jumps at irregular intervals. If you aren't long and patient you miss the gains. From $5 to $110 was a good investment. From $110 to who knows where will be another good investment. AMD has the chops to take all revenue from $INTC and $NVDA. AMD can put extreme pressure on $AAPL the spy phone company. AMD can become a key supplier to CSCO. AMD is the top super computer Artificial Intelligence company.
It’s a Jensen Huang world and we’re all just living in it. Hehe 
Beth Kindig whom I subscribe to as do a large amount of Fund managers just wrote and sent out an extensive article on NVDA saying it will overtake Apple as the most valuable company in the world (and her reasons why) in the next 5 years 
Elon is regretting tsla turning down using nvda superior autonomous driving system and holds a grudge against nvda for that
Don't believe premarket. Without Elon Musk's approval we will see a decline in thr stock price. Lrobably below $200 this week with a possible 30% drop. Trade accordingly.
NVDA at $904 adjusted to pre split  $1000 soon! 
200 may be tested tomorrow imo..Thats what he did to bitcoin...Nvda ceo das a poor reputation with dealing with competitors i hearThis likely plays a part in denying him something that everyone shoud have access to...
Revenue - exceeded expectationsEarnings per share - exceeded expectationsData center revenue - exceeded expectationsGaming revenue - exceeded expectationsGuidance for next quarter - raisedSounds good to me!
"I truly believe NVDA will be moving higher, with at least a 25% upside potential."

Barron’s put out an article on why musk is raising a red flag on the arm deal. Musk is worried about tesla having to compete with nvidia’s driverless technology.
"Profit taking on the wane, and there is strong movement towards green pay-dirt for NVDA!"
"Lesson to be learnt! They bad mouthed Amazon a few weeks back and it went down but the ones who held on to their shares reaped the benefits. Today Amazon is up $82. Buy and hold and hold and buy NVIDIA etc. That is the mantra. Remember Dow is headed to 50,000 Nasdaq to 30,000 plus abs S&P to 10,000 plus"

I am looking for the joke of the day. Anybody see Salamander?
Nvidia weighting more and more heavy in my total portfolio but absolutely no plans to sell a single share. Train didn't even leave the station yet folks. Get your tickets and all aboard my fellow investors.
How can you be an 'investor' and not own Nvidia? It is the best company of this decade! Jensen won't dissapoint you!
"NVDA is all about the existing potential energy and moves according to its knack emery. You may ask why. So I tell you the best Management, the best product and the best service. And you see the results as evidence to my words."
"The 3 to 5 year outlook for NVDA makes it a very affordable price at current trading levels!*** NVDA already posted revenue and profits guidance that totally exceeds analysts projections and expectations — which is a clear indication that there is way, WAY more room to run in this current FY-2022, and beyond — for the stock to keep reflecting the power and strength of the underline business!"
Nvidia split was great for shareholders - thanks CEO Jensen.
Anti trust legislation is the major obstacle and that includes the ARM purchase.
"NVDA still crushing shorts ALSO, I expect DOCN (Digital Ocean) to see triple digits. ADD DOCN to your portfolio imo"
this stock is not going under 200$ again....unless there is a crash in the world. Again I have several shares and very happy. However the genius who said there may be a pull back and go under 200$...this does not scare people that love the stock...instead we will be more than happy to buy more shares...so no worries here!!!
"NVDA,I owned @ $10 dollars in 2008 then sold at $20 in 2010I bought again in 2018 at $135 then sold it at $240 in 2019Then I bought it at $400 in 2020 and I will NEVER EVER sell."
Wow what a machine… not many other big names did 5.5% today.
"+90% in less than 6 months....and more coming, this is the new chipzilla."
Name a better stock than NVDA right now
Nasdaq Up 130 Pts. NVDA down 20cents. Nothing left in the stock!
Please remember when Friday is an up day there is almost a 90% chance that the week following that Friday will be an up week . We had a great Friday closing two days back

"Finished in the green and set a new high. Didn’t give back any of our recent mouthwatering gains. Despite that loose cannon Musk’s best efforts we hung touch, Well done NVDA! "
"What is a good entry point. I have waited too long already, but want to begin a position. Thoughts?"
"I remember dreaming about nvidia surpassing $3B revenue/qtr not too long ago. now they are closing in on $3B FCF/qtr. and revenue can and will explode again in 2023 with software subscription, geforcenow, metaverse, grace, etc. congrats longs."
"Today’s rally in NVDA is a reflection of investors and the Market’s reassessment, and acknowledgement of its attaining a new level of outperformance for the business.— It’s quite amazing to see this transformation of a great business switching gears in real time — to hit an even higher level of outperformance!*** All praises go to NVDA’s Exceptional Mgr Team!"
"250's before next ER very likely. +10% . I bet the shorts will make a ton of money when this goes from 253 to 247 in november, lol. Food for shrinks."
$230 on Monday
One has to wonder where this stock goes from here after Elon Musk soundly rejected the ARM deal. Is there any other options for Jensen to propel this stock forward.
Longs we break through that $225 residence all bets off! Shorts will be vaporized
Great time for retail investors with the “means and conviction in the NVDA juggernaut business” to buy on the “automatic programmed selling” — based on the News coming out of Kabul Afghanistan Airport this morning.
"Too many anti trust complaints, including ARM, even from Elon Musk."
3-4 different very positive write ups and forecasts on Nvda from well known investing journals ....2-3 reports of purchase of ARM moving forwardThis is going to $300 by end of the year easy......
Since when did we start listening to￼Elon musk?￼ Especially when he tricked a bunch of people into buying crypto?￼
Salesforce up over 3.00% after hours after beating all expectations and giving a great guidance. The entire tech sector will rocket  to the sky tomorrow
slow day today but no problem. green is always good
What a great week!
