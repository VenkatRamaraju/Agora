"The cloud gaming market is in its early phases of growth, and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has already moved into a dominant position in this multi-billion-dollar market that's expected to generate more than $6 billion in revenue by 2024. The company has already reported gaming revenues of $3 billion, nearly half its total revenue that was generated in the second quarter."
"My hopes are Nvidia will go to $500 by early part of 2022. Yes hope is a great word. But $500 is also doable and achievable simply because we are in the midst of a new bull market which will last at least 21 years. Dow will zoom by 50,000 Nasdaq zoom by 30,000 and S&P zoom by 10,000 . After all the greatest investor ever his excellency Warren Buffett has said recently that “Dow is headed to 1,000,000 yes One Million. It is up to the rest of you to make your own decisions but my intentions are to stay fully invested. The great Warren Buffett is a Finance Guru after all. Thank you"
Nvidia is now the 9th most valued company in the world. It's close to overtaking Berkshire Hathaway
"Here is something to think about. I was talking with a work collegue a few years ago,2013, about a company that I thought was going to be big. I was spending bigger percentage of my annual income on this company and I guessed that more and more people would be doing the same. At the time, the stock was hovering around $220 to $235 and we decided that it was just too expensive because not many stocks were trading that high. Today, that stock is trading over $3000. If you gueased Amazon, you are correct. NVDA will match this or more with the leadership in AI that will revolutionize the world. Both with licensing software and building the hardware to support the deep learning training and inference, they will be king. Sit back and watch it play out."
End of October 2021. Did you know August is always the toughest month of the year. Now we have great 7 months ahead of us. My prayers for all of you. And all the best too. Living in the world’s best and largest economy and the world’s best and largest market is a blessing indeed.
"nice 12% gain from NVDA this week, to put that into perspective, it's semi rival AMD had a 0.34% gain. do the math and it's 35x higher gain!"
"SO...just rambling and thinking out loud here....but when the split happened I figured it was a 'no brainer' that NVDA would get the invite to the DJI (90% chance), but now I'm thinking it might not happen. AND that is because the DOW is extremely share price concerned and because NVDA is SUCH a 'hot' stock and (imho) will be $350 or more within a year and $500 within 2 years, that (once again) NVDA has priced themselves out of the DJI. Then, to take that a step further, either the DJI decides that since NVDA is the premier stock on the market (which it clearly is and will continue to be) they accept them as the top stock price of the 30 OR NVDA decides to split again in 2023 or 2024..... Again, just thinking out loud here after a long day so don't flame me too badly! :"") Good luck to all my long brethren!!!"
"@Darth_Trader 1d ago: ""that +$15 will he gone by tomorrow"". Since then, the stock has gone up more than $8 "
"if you are wondering why Nvidia is up so much today, its from facebook earnings call where they said""""We expect 2021 capital expenditures to be approximately $19 billion, updated from our prior estimate of $19-21 billion. For 2022, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $29-34 billion, driven by our investments in data centers, servers, network infrastructure, and office facilities. A large factor driving the increase in capex spend is an investment in our AI and Machine Learning capabilities, which we expect to benefit our efforts in ranking and recommendations for experiences across our products, including in Feed and video, as well as improving ads performance and relevance.""That is a huge amount of sales coming Nvidia's way!"
"Besides NVDA, can any investors suggest stocks they believe may have a bright future as NVDA has had? Thanks and GLTA"
how many Bugattis will you boys be purchasing with your future nvidia money? I say we all buy a few in different colors
This is the best stock in my portfolio in terms of percentage return. My top 3 are:1. Nvidia2. UPS3. Microsoft
NVDA will be the first chipmaker to join the “TRILLION$$$” market cap club” by its global technological leadership at the centre of the Metaverse — creating the next level of computing!*** It’s a winning investing idea and strategy to embrace and stay with an obvious winner anytime you can!
"Nvidia GTC event coming up, with Ceo Jenson Huang giving the keynote presentation. livestreamed on Nov. 9 at 9 am Central European Time/4 pm China Standard Time/12 a.m. Pacific Standard Time. It will be rebroadcast at 8 am PST for viewers in the Americas.“It’s fair to say that you can expect to hear product and technology announcements. From Jensen, you can expect to hear about new partnerships and lots of examples of actually implementing AI on the leading edge,” Estes said. “We’ll have a number of examples of lighthouse customers and end users and our ecosystem partners.”https://venturebeat.com/2021/10/25/nvidias-gtc-will-draw-200k-researchers-for-online-event-including-metaverse-session/"
Already own 200 shares but was wondering whether it is too lateTo buy more. Any opinions?
"You can’t seem to make anything good these days without chips—potato chips, tortilla chips, NVDA chips. The party keeps going."
"Face announcement is just a start, every big compnay wants to buy NVIDIA technology.. its simply the best out there , 300 soon"
"It looks like this stock has run too far too fast. So, some sell it and take the 'profit'. BUT that's a big mistake.This stock has so much more 'gas in the tank'; it has far more upside. Facebook or now Meta will be making huge purchases from NVDA for years to upstart their Metaverse platform. Even if their acquisition fails (in the hands of the EU) it won't have a big effect as NVDA will be doing a lot of business with them.Upside is anyone's guess. But it will be sizable. Just look what this stock has done this YEAR and in the last week after that huge run. I initially bought this stock at $46 just a couple years ago and have added as recently as this morning. If you have no position in this stock MAKE ONE!"
AI will be the driver of long term growth for this company. Both hardware and software.
I continue to add NVDA to my 401k and Roth accounts. Very exciting to think what this stock will be worth when I'm 65 (9 years). Might actually retire early if NVDA keeps rolling!
