My God what a turnaround in the futures. God Bless the United States . Quarterly results coming out soon. They will be outstanding. Then we have a positive GDP growth and unemployment is going down . More and more people are opening 401k and 403 b plans and other savings and investments accounts. Ask Fidelity their new accounts openings are up by 19% and Charles Schwab and others are vastly opening new accounts. And foreign funds such as from Norway Denmark Sweden England Canada Germany are investing in the United States markets due to great stability and growth. So are India China Japan the oil rich Middle East all investing in the world’s best and largest market and the world’s best and largest economy. You should be proud that you live in the United States of America. Amen
Been in this stock for years. Added shares multiple times over this time frame. ADDED at open this morning.
Het Dot AMD 22% Year to Date NVDA 66% Year to Date I guess you missed that
Might see new all time highs this week yet…..
We got some smart guys on here! Are we going to hear one way or another before years end?
ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!CHOO CHOO! HA HA
Nvidia is getting a lot of buy articles recently. Surely this goes against the financial wisdom of the commentators on this forum? Surely the Yahoo experts know better than to listen to such drivel that clearly states NVIDIA is a BUY n HOLD stock of the moment?
217 at close.
"They will always give you a bs “go away in May”. Ok so now the best 8 months ahead of us starting October 1, 2021. Now the piglets will pick on something else. Well great retail sales and earnings, positive GDP growth , vaccines programs have worked well , more and more people are returning to work . And the D are in trouble and will not get their 3.7T package which is now reduced to 2.0T and taxes won’t increase as hoped by B and the Ds will lose both the House and S next year. And the market likes all that."
"Goody Morning, Up day today...BABBA and Friends"
NVIDIA ROCKET IS UNSTOPPABLE

Investing 101: buy and hold Nvidia
The Downers out early as usual allow them their moment 222 soon 
"You you had compassion, feelings, love, affection, sense of caring wouldn’t you invite Salamander to dinner? Yes ! No! May be!"
"Another acquisition from Nvidia. Woo-Hoo! Oski Technology, an Expert in Formal Verification, Joins NVIDIA.“We are excited to announce that Oski Technology, a company specializing in formal verification methods, will be joining NVIDIA.Modern processors pack tens of billions of transistors, tiny on/off switches connected by billions of microscopic pathways. A bug in a single transistor can prevent a chip from operating correctly, requiring costly revisions to fix.Today, verification engineers rely on two very different methods to make sure bugs don’t make it into silicon — simulation and formal verification.The first approach relies on millions of simulations that search for bugs, exercising corner cases in carefully designed tests.Formal verification, Oski’s specialty, is a powerful alternative that uses mathematical analysis of a design instead of simulations to prove that a particular feature behaves correctly for all possible inputs.Whereas simulation injects 1’s and 0’s into a design to test whether numbers are added properly, Oski’s approach formally verifies that “c = a + b.””- blogs.nvidia"
I feel for those who have sold during this mini correction. Maybe next year another opportunity will present itself when it dips down to $400.
I wake up every night ROTFLMFAO just thinking about the posts in here 4 months ago from the “people” (TARDS) buying the NVDA 230 & 250 calls. I heard those calls are clogging their toilets  .
210 any moment now. 240 soon Chip shortage will clear mid 2022 if not soonerBuy now 
Told yo people to buyeth more and stay fully invested. I sayeth a bull market has formed or reformed . Will run for years and years and years. Thanko..BABBA and his utmost friends for ever.
If you own chip shares of any co that is making money and growing they are fixing to do very good over the next short while margins are going to shy rocket because of shortage. Remember the oil prices in the 70's the oil co's profits doubled & tripled.
i cant drive 225 buy nividia will
NVIDIA still commanding a decent volume.
Enough business days in October 2021 to get to $250! And why not! NVIDIA deserves a $500 value post split
Freedom get financial advice from the attached gentleman
AMD a laggard when Nasdaq +70
"There is hardly an important technology market that Nvidia isn't targeting. Whether it's artificial intelligence or gaming, data centers or automobiles, Nvidia has its thumb in the pie and wants a larger slice."
WOW!
"""Intel says it will no longer consider UK as site for huge chip factory because of Brexit"" This may bode well for the UK's decision on ARM and NVIDIA deal."
5:59a ET 10/12/2021 - Benzinga*Reuters Reported EU Antitrust Regulators Likely to Open Full-scale Investigation into Nvidia's $54B Bid for ArmHopefully get by this and get on with the purchase!
My God Amazon up $76 today. Thank Jesus I buy and hold NVIDIA etc.
"AMD struggling to stay green, poor AMD"
up 110% today on weekly calls. lmao easiest money ever. I love nvda
"The longs need to have some sympathy and understanding for the shorts and the day traders. The shorts and the day traders just returned from their summer vacations wherein they traveled  to the Middle East, Ireland, India, England and Bali island and Jamaica and Europe and Paris and Germany. They went to Kenya and Tanzania etc to watch the elephants and the tigers and the lions and perhaps the Alps to catch an early skiing. Now they need money for their winter wonderland and dream vacations. Easy way is to short and day trade and spread rumors so we longs can panic and sell to them cheaply."
CHOO CHOO!ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!
AMD 1 year: 35% NVDA 1 year: 56% and had a 4:1 split
"Poor Salamander. Remember Rod did the same to Apple, trying to run it down . But Apple beat all perimeters and kept going up. Then Rod apologized to Apple stating that he was wrong about Apple. This is all documented."

"Dow almost up 500 points and Nasdaq up almost 230 points. The new bull market has began. Already the forecast is that Nasdaq will go to 30,000 soon and with your permission let me state Dow is headed to plus 50,000 and S&P to plus 10,000 as well"
Ok I'm the Debbie downer but this excellent rise will mean a big bite for profit taking Friday. May end back down to $210 tomorrow.
Do I hear 210
WOW! Up 5+ that's 21 by Lizardman math Awesome
"So NVIDIA whilst awaiting a decision on the ARM deal, have been doing their due diligence, will have access to all of ARMs current and future developments. Basically gaining the information they need to potentially design and develop the products themselves if the deal fails. Maybe that was the intention all the time, because it was always going to be difficult to close the deal. Very much a genius move."
It is going to be an up day . Stay focused! The best 8 months of the year just started. Great retail sales and earnings. Positive GDP growth . And lower infrastructure spending resulting in lower increase in taxes both corporate and personal. Remember the S is even and the H is almost even so no increases in spending and taxes can pass that easily. The stock market likes that .
Love  to see $250 by October 2021 and I believe it will happen
"If you bashers don't like NVIDIA, go stick your cash in oil, steel or Intel, Cola, BAC or some other stock that has no price movement. NVIDIA has historically always been volatile which is why it gets a lot of day and swing traders. But it is also a very excellent long term investment. You have to be in it to take advantage of the price pops, that usually happen after earnings."
ALL ABOARD THE NVIDIA TRAIN!CHOO CHOO!
Nice headed back up again 210 today
"EU and UK are cross checking the NVIDIA deal. Ok. So that's Due Diligence on their behalf, because they don't want another HP/ Autonomy scenario where books are cooked and claims are made. EU probably want a few more sweeteners thrown their way, and UK will pass it if Boris Johnson is chucked a few sweets also. I don't understand why NVIDIA paid $2 Billion down payment though if it weren't a done deal. A lot can change between now and Sept 22 so don't go getting your knickers in a twist over this one."
"I cant understand this, everyone are support in Nvidia and told that it will up to 260$, but until now it is stiilStuck in 206-208, sometimes it is go to 210+Some can tell me why it is happened?"
I was looking for a new nintendo switch....all sold out...nvidia tegra sales going through the roof.
"According to IBD, NVDA is ranked in 1st in group-Composite rating: 99/100EPS rating: 97RS rating: 89Group RS ratin: A+SMR rating: AAcc/Dis Rating: B-Recommendation rating in Yahoo Finance: 2Most of the recommendation trends are between strong buy and buy.I wish to you happy afternoon and very good trades."
A year ago NVDA was at $138 per share. Today it's at $207.
Futures are up pretty big time . As I analyze the performance of the market the conclusions can be drawn that this could be the beginning of a great bull market which will last for years and years to come.
"keyboard warrior Dottie runs hit mouth early during market opening when NVDA was red, now that it's green, he's talking less"
"Lots of selling pressure. This stock is now caught in the web of regulators of various bureaucratic countries and also waiting for china to clear as well. This is not a good. Between now and earnings, this will slide lower and there will be lot more pains. Unfortunately, I am holding this at 211."
"I need to qualify this wih admitting that I hate Europe. Being in Europe in my military days, I really hated the way we were generally treated....they didn't like us and they expected us to rescue them whenever they needed us. the EU is pretty much Socialist-Democratic so they don't have any love for American based companies either. I doubt if Mr Huang has the experience of knowing how much he is hated by Europe. The good part is NVDA is really really rich and they have more free cash than most countries who are in debt. He could take half of the $54 billion and create a rival the ARM that is superior in every way. Going through this discusting demeaning review by the European communist is not the way. The way is to stay American...we have young bright people that are brilliant. NVDA doesn't need ARM and create their own version of whatever ARM is doing that they so much want. If you feel the same way, you can contact Mr Huang on his linkedin profile. He should have put this by us shareholders anyway."
@DARTH: have you ever been long on NVDA) l know you know you’re business!!!
What happened to 219.30?
Often I turn my lights off and sit in my room contemplating/ thinking and I do shed a few tears for those honest innocent angelic hardworking people who took wrong advise and sold . Please stay invested. Looks like a bull market formation to me.
Soon NVIDIA will become a $1.0T company and in five years over $2.0T Company. GUARANTEED
"Analysts are forecasting Nvidia will grow revenue from $16.5 billion in 2021 to $51 billion in 2026, a better than 25% compound annual growth rate, while earnings are expected to grow even faster, or more than 26% annually, to $7.73 per share. Net profits are supposed to increase five-fold over that time frame."
230 next week?
"There's some profit taking today longs. No worries, sit back n chill."
Looks like a great day to buy more and accumulate. Market likes the fact that the debt ceiling Bill was passed by the House  yesterday. In this case it likes certainty.
Holy moly the 3 downers are in full swing today. I guess they feel the pain.215 today
Fast turning positive. Will be a highly positive day. The bond market is closed today so none of the thing about bond yields. On the other hand we have the best 8 months of the year ahead of us. GDP will show great growth. Great retail sales and earnings. Infrastructure bill down from 3.7 T to around 2.0T and taxes won’t go up that much and finally they will lose the H and S to the Rs in 2022 not that they are of any majority even right now and the market senses that and the market likes it.
AMD up 3x.
"NVDA remains trading in the extreme “bargain zone” at current trading levels!*** With a projected HUGE earnings beat expected in its next earnings report, NVDA should be trading in the $235 to $250 range!"
"Follow a strategy = go long term and buy and hold . I always lost when I was a day trader and a short and I bought puts and lost. Always waiting for a margin call too. Now I am a long . I have my core holdings such as Nvidia etc etc and then I buy mutual funds from fidelity mostly index funds but others too. No ETFs so far. Among the mutual funds I own FSELX which has Nvidia as the top holding plus other chip companies. Then I own Large Capital Index Fund, Total Market Index Fund and 500 Index Fund, Blue Chip Growth, OTC etc etc . I am very happy with my performance. You can always try other great family of funds too but I love Fidelity. By the way Warren Buffett admits he made most of his money by buying index funds. Had you and I invested $1,000 with Warren Buffett in 1959 we would be worth $72 millions now because his average yearly return since 1959 has been 23.2% . God, please young people start an investment plan and then buy and hold forever. Thank you"
should close at or above$219. if it's going to test the $230 high next week!!
Nvidia looks like there going to get ARM Deal done. Even Speaker of the House Pelosi's husband just bought Nvidia with that same thought. When this deal goes through the price targets will accelerate upward very quick seeing Nvidia go to 300.00 a share very quickly.
A very good day. Can't wait to see Jensen's mid November earnings report.... sure it will contain lots of great news.
BTC outperformed all asset classes - wow
NVDA global juggernaut is on FIRE heading into the closing bell!!!
Nvidia reiterated Overweight and price target raised to $260 from $245 at KeyBanc
I think NVDA will break thru after earnings...looking for $240-270.But I feel this is at least worth over $350+ in the short term (3-4 months).
"Inflation will never be an issue for a “tech juggernaut”, like NVDA with HUGE pricing power — given the current global chip shortage, being outstripped by demand — over the next 24 to36 months!!"
Tech on a tear today MFST CRM AAPL AMD NVDA CRWD BEAUTIFUL DAY 
ten days ago pessimists commented that NVDA is going down badly. I stated NVDA will be back and shine better and show its character and merit/ SO longs have good reasons to be happy.
Definitely headed to plus $250 by the end of October 2021
Congrats Captain Kirk
CAPTAIN KIRK RIDING THE NVIDIA ROCKET TO NEW ALL TIME HIGHS
Markets continue to fall. My portfolio lost 15% profit over the past few weeks. When will this end!!!
Autos GM Tesla Ford Toyota etc are up big time today . So are all my core holdings. Tell you I can smell bull in the air . Beginning of a new bull market has began and it could last 20 years.
"Same here, currently holding NVDA ONLY"
New Bull market forming
"Desire to acquire ARM looks like a long pregnancy, not knowing what the outcome going to be. Best thing is to grow organically."

Darth_trader can take a break today lol
AMD remains flat at $4 gain for the entire day despite nasdaq going +50 to +100. terrible stock!
Go NVIDIA!
"Its 3:30 AM, Nvidia is up over 211 (181.76 euros) on Frankfurt Exhange."
"Some great pundits are predicting that Nasdaq will zoom past 30,000 and I believe Dow will pass 50,000 and S&P 10,000 plus very soon"
NVDA is my large holding and had is for 8 years and add some it won!t slow down In Tea Town Oliver
"I took time to analyze all companies in SOX index to select those, which would fit holding during tapering (those, which are not overvalued, profitable and are set to generate good income near-term). Here's my best bets:$KLAC - my best bet and safe-haven. Unlike some other semiconductor equipment manufacturers ($LRCX, $AMAT, $TXN) this one is on the front of the chip miniaturization and its metrology equipment is used in testing and production of 3nm, 5nm and 7nm nodes. This company's further prospects and financials will be very correlated to $ASML, because smaller nodes require more metrology. But KLAC is currently 2-3 times cheaper than ASML fundamentally. Moreover, even if after EUV lithography there will emerge some alternative production equipment for sub-nm nodes and ASML loses its dominance, KLAC still should feel fine because even more metrology will be needed for smaller nodes regardless of production technology - so safe to hold like 10 years ahead.$AMKR - company is on the front of the chip shortage and engaged in production of microchips used in devices, wearables, IoT, vehicles etc. The company is extremely cheap fundamentally, even though it has grown 2x since the pandemic begun. Management comment that it will experience cyclical tailwinds at least through whole 2022 and good results has only started to show up in earnings yet. I expect at least 30% upside here yet going forward but it is not a long-term asset.$MCHP - analog and digital microchip producers, whose products are in high demand right now. Company is again relatively cheap to its peers ($MRVL, $ADI), while management reports 60 weeks lead times on new orders in some categories right now. Everything is essentially booked up 1 year ahead already. Company is about to get a 2:1 stock split too in one week.$INTC - Intel apparently is cheap fundamentally compared to its peers and overall has been beaten down for several quarters. But near-term some positive developments are about to start working. New family of processors on new chipset and new DDR5 memory is poised to be a success starting selling in November. In January Intel will finally release new videocards, which are planned to be competitive this time to $NVDA and $AMD . Also new CEO's plans to engage into fab business goes well with current chip shortage theme. Time will tell if Intel can return its lost share in processors and videocards but the possibility of it should give the stock momentum anyway."
Woo hoo! Looks like we are getting back to business today!
feels good to finally see a market rebound today! nothing but green pastures!
Get ready 225 tomorrow
The U.K. HAS to okay the Nvidia-Arm deal. BBC today reports that Intel has publicly stated that they are no longer considering building a factory in the U.K. because of Brexit. Intel is building in the EU now. The U.K. is a mess since leaving EU. No one wants to invest there anymore. But they are lucky - Jensen Huang and team to the rescue! Nvidia will gladly invest in the U.K. All the U.K. have to do is okay the Nvidia-Arm deal. Politics. I firmly believe the deal will go through.
Just got in from Capital Grill and thats it dropped 1.36 with NAS down 90. Buy signal. 
Last chance to get on AMD train before taking off!!! $NVDA $INTC
I only have nvda. no diworsification
Increased adoption of artificial intelligence in apps and in self-driving cars presents massive growth opportunities for Nvidia. The emergence of the metaverse -- a 3D virtual universe that many predict will be the future of the internet -- should provide an even greater catalyst for the company. Nvidia is an unstoppable stock because it's poised to profit from these unstoppable trends.
What do you guys think for net 3 years
"Nasdaq looking good, bitcoin popping, 10 year bond slightly higher...I am looking for a modest pop today around 2 to 3 dollars but could be much bigger with all this positive sentiment and shorts covering."
Close over $220 today on triple volume
$NVDA P/E=120$TSLA P/E=500What Tool is buying those Valuation Jokes???
"I am begining to wonder if ARM is worth the 54 billion (originally 40 b) and all the approval process. The engineers there pretty much want to design and not be worried about short term profits. 54 billion can buy a lot of talent. NVDA is moving fast in technology and to have to deal with multiple countries with tons of concessions that will essentially water down all the benefits of owning this asset. Personally, I would take the $54 billion, recruit the best and brightest design engineers with some of that money."
"Back on March, when big tech had a melt down because of interest rates and bond yields, I stupidly sold off APPLE shares for a big loss, when I bought at 127, and everyone was laughing and poking fun. In July I bought Nvidia at 197, and sold after the split when they crashed. And now they have been to 230. I recently bought a lot of NVIDIA shares at 220. And now they are 207. My lesson in only a year or so of trading and investing, is that good stocks always go back up and exceed the so called highs. The other lesson I learnt was to never invest on margin, and to leave stop losses well alone, especially in volatile stocks like NVIDIA. These are my hard earned lessons and not advice."

Lets Go Brandon!
"loudmouth was on a roll with 500 comments of me early this morning when NVDA was red for a glimpse, now that it's green, he is hiding!"
I changed my mind! $260 by the end of October 2021. For God’s sake don’t tell me not to change my mind.
When is nvda going to break 230.43 for a NEW high this month?
230 tomorrow according to Alex P. Keaton!
"$209 resistance never fails, $210 resistance never fails, $215 resistance never fails. all from our board ""genius"" in a matter of 24 hours. see the trend? it always climbs up"
I see that all the financial advisors are out in force today. Maybe I should just take their advice and sell my shares? Er....don't think so.
Boot intel out of the DOW30 and add NVDA
"@James see NASDAQ, $intc and $nvda red, AMD's green to repeat my previous post!"
Inflation is controlled by higher interest rates. The guy at the switch is clueless.
serious question...how is the ARM deal looking?
"Picked up 5 shares @ $215 today. Forget about the price, just keep adding NVDA to your portfolio. I forget what Barry called me? DAB? Daily Average Buyer? Oh well, I don't know squat about stocks except that NVDA will allow me to retire MUCH MUCH sooner than I normally would be able to! I can't wait to post here when we're at $500 per share. Good luck to my long friends!"
Bullish close on gap up days signals end of pullback. Onward to new highs!
NVDA over 1x AMD today. beautiful
NVDA has been bouncing between like 190 and 230 for two months now. Can it break through before earnings?

Goody Morning. Definitely plus $250 by the end of October 2021. There aint no doubty doubty in my mind. Thanko....BABBA and Friends
"Data Center, metaverse, GPU, AI, health care, and upcoming ARM deal. NVIDIA is the future. This expensive fundamentals ' cough cough' will seem like a dip in the ocean in 10;years time."
I am very sure ladies and gentlemen we will see $250 by the end of October 2021. Thanko...BABBA and friends
"They tried to talk down Amazon a few weeks back. It went down . I held on . Now it is back up plus plus plus more. But the innocent angelic simple honest hardworking people fell for it and sold. Honest to God I shed tears for them . They try to do the same to Nvidia, try to talk it down them swines. The classic example is that of Apple. For years they tried to talk it down(Rod) Apple ignored them and kept on beating all benchmarks and kept on going up . Finally they apologized to Apple saying that they were wrong about Apple. They apologized to Apple"
back to $220s territory. who bought at low $200s?
Currently sitting at a 15% loss on intel. Is dumping that and putting it into nvda the better call?
"Nice article on NVDA in IBD. Main street will buy more now, I think."
LOL! Futures are up but CNBC says they are flat! LOL! May be they need new glasses or people who can read English (unglish) LOL!
"Nvidia good, chlamydia bad."
"Just checked my Purchase History and all my dip buys, over the past 30 day, are solid green!"
Another prediction: Nvidia will seen be a $1.0T company and within two years could even become a $2.0T company. All the companies I have predicted either at 1.0T or 2.0T have come out to be true. I remember how people laughed at me. They thought I was a banana republic but boy I proved them wrong .
"Yo ladies and gentlemen of the jury; we have the best 8 months of the year for stocks starting October 1, 2021. Great retail sales and earning when the results are announced fellas!

"Oh Dear, was it down two bit?"
I sleep very well knowing that NVDA will give me an early retirement in the next few years. Next earnings release is around Nov. 17 which is just over one month away.

"If you want to get a ballpark idea where this stock will be througout most of the day, take the Nasdaq index percentage x 2. That is pretty much where we end up."

"NVDA is one of the TOP “inflation protection growth stocks” that will provide one of the best safety shields — where prudent investors can park to clearly wait out, to discern who wins the inflation debates among the various camps of Economists!"
big move coming. shoirties better cover
"One thing that that I learned from Appl..... you never, ever, ever, sell the goose that lays the Golden Eggs. NVDA is the leader in 21st tech and will grown fasters, and bigger, than anyone else in the space. Eventually this with be a 1T mkt cap company driving the economic growth of multiple industries."
Holy moly got a cup of coffee now up buck and change
"Where are the analysts upgrades. Needhams Rajvinder Gill and Hans Nosesman must be taking an extended summer vacation. LOL.Common dudes, raise the price target or something. CNBC loves to hear from y'all."
moving up into the close. some trader is eating his words.
209 today. Or 210?
If Nvidia does not go up to $250 plus next year I promise Salamander will stop  posting.
Arm is not needed but very positive. Never thought it had a good chance of passing. This rest is very helpful. Trying to free up money to buy more.
"The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.32% higher. NVDA is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)."
215 tomorrow kids. The chip shortage will end The Arm deal will clear NVDA will hit 300. A warm spring.Patience is a virtue
"Some of the things are so easy to project and state it is like eating food, drinking water, walking , talking, laughing  etc etc. Same as regarding chips. Chips shortages may be reduced but honest to God it will take a long long time to go away. Why? More usage. Lap tops, I phones, autos, Graphics, AI, medical and education needs, bitcoins, space and military use, robotic use such as surgery and space exploration, home devices, monitoring equipment, internet, cloud computing. I can go on and on . Manufacturing and factories, health monitoring and medicines usage, replacement body parts such as artificial lungs and other prosthetics usage. etc etc. I have talked to some top of the line experts and scientists and what they have told me is mind boggling and out of this world. All this will need more and more chip usage my friends and thanks be to God the Great United States is still dominant in this field"

Hey Dot what will you say when Nvda hits 235?
"Nvidia Stock Price Forecast 2021-2022Nvidia price started in 2021 at $130.55. Today, Nvidia traded at $219.41, so the price increased by 68% from the beginning of the year. The forecasted Nvidia price at the end of 2021 is $296 - and the year to year change +127%. The rise from today to year-end: +35%. In the first half of 2022, the Nvidia price will climb to $355; in the second half, the price would add $63 and close the year at $418, which is +91% to the current price.Nvidia Stock Forecast 2023-2027These five years would bring an increase: Nvidia price would move from $418 to $824, which is up 97%. Nvidia will start 2023 at $418, then soar to $436 within the first six months of the year and finish 2023 at $441. That means +101% from today.Nvidia Stock Forecast 2028-2032In this period, the Nvidia price would rise from $824 to $1,031, which is +25%. Nvidia will start 2028 at $824, then soar to $841 within the first half of the year, and finish 2028 at $859. It is about +292% from today."
