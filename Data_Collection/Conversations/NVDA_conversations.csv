After looking at the most recent quarter and at what rate the revenues and earnings are growing I wasn't surprise to see the 300.00 price target by Analyst Moseman. Overall with this kind of growth stock price will likely double from the 190.00 level just prior to reporting quarterly earnings and revenues a year from now.
"So much for Elon Musk's influence...up premarket.The ARM deal can go through, or it can be blocked but either way it is a win/win for both ARM and Nvidia, who have been partnering for years."

"To be honest, I tought Elon Musk comment on the ARM deal would make this stock falling. I guess it is a very nice suprise!"
3-4 different very positive write ups and forecasts on Nvda from well known investing journals ....2-3 reports of purchase of ARM moving forwardThis is going to $300 by end of the year easy......
Elon Musk fears Jensen Huang - and rightly so.
"Finished in the green and set a new high. Didn’t give back any of our recent mouthwatering gains. Despite that loose cannon Musk’s best efforts we hung touch, Well done NVDA! "
NVDA a powerhouse with or without ARM. Check a 5 year chart
Elon is regretting tsla turning down using nvda superior autonomous driving system and holds a grudge against nvda for that

Options pressure the stock. Exercised calls are sold. The stock jumps at irregular intervals. If you aren't long and patient you miss the gains. From $5 to $110 was a good investment. From $110 to who knows where will be another good investment. AMD has the chops to take all revenue from $INTC and $NVDA. AMD can put extreme pressure on $AAPL the spy phone company. AMD can become a key supplier to CSCO. AMD is the top super computer Artificial Intelligence company.
"NASDAQ and NVDA chartsThe last major dip of the Nasdaq was when many businesses were subject to pandemic-related shutdown (or remote work for employees) on March 16, 2020 which ended the day at 6,879 points. As of this writing, the NASDAQ is at 15,248 = 122% return. On March 16, 2020 NVDA dipped to $51.44 (post-split adjusted). As of this writing, NVDA is at $228 = 343% return which gives the NASDAQ a really nice boost. Look at the charts.What we are seeing here is a period of the greatest creation of wealth in the tech sector, and it's not over by a long shot. With the world eventually coming out of the pandemic, the tech sector will continue to flourish. NVDA is leading the way because it's involved in so many industries of the present and the future ... it has become a powerhouse. Will NVDA catch up to the other tech companies with trillion dollar valuations? I believe so ... in due time. And I am enjoying the ride."
slow day today but no problem. green is always good
"The 3 to 5 year outlook for NVDA makes it a very affordable price at current trading levels!*** NVDA already posted revenue and profits guidance that totally exceeds analysts projections and expectations — which is a clear indication that there is way, WAY more room to run in this current FY-2022, and beyond — for the stock to keep reflecting the power and strength of the underline business!"

Why is everyone here concerned with the musk comment? It’s likely he wanted to secure nvidia chips to help fix issues with his driverless cars. And he was told to wait in line. People with power don’t like to hear the word no so they usually fight back with any means possible.
One has to wonder where this stock goes from here after Elon Musk soundly rejected the ARM deal. Is there any other options for Jensen to propel this stock forward.

ARM or no ARM deal. Nvidia is the future and will be here to stay.
