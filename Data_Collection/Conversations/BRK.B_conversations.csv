"The 2nd quarter report showed Buffett was buying A shares at $432,536."
"You’ll thank me for my vast contributions. When the stock goes higher, you’ll see my many posts that forecast.When the stock goes lower, you’ll see my many forecasts this dog is flat.I’m usually spot on right about BRKB. I’m an extremely stable genius.E. The magnificent."
"I will investigate claims of originality & authenticity, E. Thanks. That’s my domain."
"""North American Rail Traffic Fell 1.5% in Week Ended Aug. 21BY Dow Jones & Company, Inc.— 12:42 PM ET 08/25/2021North American rail traffic fell 1.5% last week amid continued declines in shipments of grain and motor vehicles and parts, data from the Association of American Railroads showed.Carload volume edged up 0.6% for the week ended Aug. 21 on 12 reporting U.S., Canadian and Mexican railroads, while intermodal traffic fell 3.3%, the trade group said Wednesday.""Railroad traffic is a good indicator for board economy.

"Infrastucture bill , will send this Guy( BRK-B) , to the MOON !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
I just muted E. Just could not tolerate any more nonsense. Also got tired of clicking on the down arrow. (I seldom mute anyone.)
"Waiting for this stock to make any significant progress is like waiting on paint to dry. I will be patient though and wait for this next run, but as soon as my target is reached, I'm out. You BRK-B fanboys can keep this slow growing stock. WEB would be better served taking some of the cash pile and rewarding his shareholders. You people have been neglected for years."
There’s the 1:12 to 1:27 pm spike again.JAY

Why? Why? Why?
When people say that this is not a good stock and then give me the reasons that they don’t think that it is and that includes most often times how “the rules of investing have changed.” That reassures me more that I am exactly where I need to be with Brk”I have bought and sold 2 small businesses and currently own 2. Even in this rail it’s really amazing to me that when people are buying a small business they all of the sudden are the ultimate value investor then you ask them what they have in their portfolio and it’ll be stocks that have a PE of 100. Blows my mind. I’m like Would you pay seven or $8 million for a small business that made 100 grand a year but had “crazy growth potential” they laugh and say of course not. I truly believe that the biggest knock with this stock is they make so much money and have so much money on hand they simply don’t have anywhere to invest it￼￼￼. That is a GOOD thing. Sure it’s frustrating at times but the bottom line we keep a loaded gun for when there is actually an opportunity. I am absolutely ecstatic that the stock has not gone up more. I hope that it goes to 250 and the rest of the market takes a big hit. I will double down (and so will WB with the buybacks which is even better)Guaranteed I don’t even need to look at it and will love where I am in 5-10 years.
"If you want me to be critical on some of the things that I have not liked here would be a few:1. Loved the VZ purchase. Buying at 10X FCF roughly long term only more demand nice moat around the business. Nothing every for sure but nice runway for future profits and growth (and close to 5% yield while you wait). Don't see why brk not doubling down on this investment. Seems like could basically acquire 15-20% of this business rather easy and who knows make a tinder for the rest if timing was right. Seems like a logical fit with the energy businesses.2. BAC-The preferred/warrant deal from a decade ago was probably second best deal to Apple. I know they got special permission to purchase up to 25% approx a year ago and could have added another 5% ownership with no problem when the common was still trading in the 20's.3. Seems like we have passed on some no brainer acquisitions that could have offered synergy to other wholly owned businesses. Additionally massive cash pile could be ""put to work"" to help them grow even more-I.E. Carmax-could sell a lot of Geico ins. and car loans through that place. True, I get you might have to pay a somewhat of a premium to buy it all but would think that additional profits made on synergies with other companies would make up the difference on this in a few years."

"This was posted just 19 days ago:""My prediction for the coming week, we see an A share at $450,000/B share at $300! Congratulations to all long term shareholders!!"""
"I’m considering publishing a Newsletter at a very nominal subscription price where you’d have access to my market commentary and BRKB price forecasts BEFORE they appear here…FYI….TBA….Regards, E"
The Es here seem conflicted and confused. It’s a time for stability and determination instead.
"E! Help me out! Should I sell BRK or hang in there? I've been following your advice, and now it feels like you're holding back on what we should do? What is your short term plan for what we should do?"
"It appears that Buffett is willing to repurchase shares, 1% over the quarter, with a much smaller margin of safety than he has received previously."
I like the predictable 3:30-3:45 run up. Sweet
"It seems like warren’s strategy is to let BRKB existing companies expand internally and thru their own acquisitions, while BRKB uses $ to buy back its own stock. Small buys by tod and Ted will continue. Any thoughts???"
"Really amazing the lack of understanding on here about Berkshire and just any overall understanding of markets from a historical perspective.What you are buying at its core with Brk is a one of a kind insurance (and re-insurance) business that has the ability to underwrite things that no one else can even touch. Even if another insurance company does find these opportunities there is a good chance they will be purchasing re-insurance from Brk to even be able to do the deal in the first place.Second you are buying its group of wholly owned highly diversified companies that throw off 30-40b/yr. NOTE: Roughly the same operating earnings that Amazon has had previous 4 qtrs and has a market cap that is $1Trillion more than BRKThird you are buying an investment portfolio portfolio of $300b managed by one of the best capital alloc. of all time.As a post earlier said the dry powder number is likely $100b if you subtract ins. reserves and cap. reserves for the business. Basically all after tax operating income generated since Q1 '20 has gone into buying back shares which means your basically getting a 4-5% divvy without paying the taxes.To be this one of a kind insurance company and to be able to ""bag an elephant"" you have to have insane amounts of actual money. There are not a lot of good deals right now and make no mistake about it WB is not going to pay 100X forward earnings for something (and be thankful that he won't.) This WILL change as it always has and when it does you want to be the guy with cash. This is always when the real money is made. Things run in cycles. The majority of your small individual investors in the market right now have no idea what a P/E ratio is, how to read any type financial statement, or what is or isn't a good deal in the market.They will get smoked in the end. When they do I want my money with the guy that has the dry powder to pick up the good assets at 30-50 cents on the dollar. The Fed has never propped up things to the level that they have currently. No more levers to pull. This is a story as old as time and brk positions you well long term for it."
happy birthday
Let’s give Warren a hand.
"$12.56 billion of stock repurchase, YTD. WOW"
I think “E” is actually Elizabeth Holmes. Now it all makes sense
I heard E is dumping BRKB and doing a SPAC with JAD
Does anyone know if Warrens ever talked about a good fund to put your retirement savings in with a pretty good level of safety. I’m retiring this December. Going to keep some Berkshire stock besides. Thanks.
"Should have kept my bubbly tech stocks, but instead I'm stuck in this dead money......."
"Berkshire Hathaway reported operating earnings of $6.69 billion in the second quarter, up 21% from $5.51 billion in the same period a year ago.Overall earnings, which reflect Berkshire’s fluctuating equity investments, increased 6.8% year over year to $28 billion in the second quarter.Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett kept buying back Berkshire shares aggressively instead of making sizable acquisitions."
"Everyone of these moderately traded stocks has at least one lonely poster who goal is to dominate/spam the message board. Basically the natural life cycle is: 1. Keep posting nonsense until others respond. 2. Get into some argument to increase drama. 3. Keep pushing until others mute you. 4. When muted by all make new account and wash, rinse and repeat."
Thoughts about why WB is dumping MRK. Created a large position last year. Now cut in 1/2. Good dividend. Great balance sheet. Has not move much. We got Organon shares. MRK might have an anti viral this fall. I do not understand the selling. Thoughts?
"Rooting for you, E! Hope you get the help you so richly deserve. If not, plan a trip to the Strip. I can hook you up with some ladies who can really straighten you up. Or at least take your mind off your day trading losses…for a few minutes!"
Any Harvey Cohen sightings ?
E has to be like 12 years old. Brings back memories remember that zit guy?
"I plan on owning this stock FOREVER. I’m a long term buy and hold value investor. I’ve seen the light.I’ve come clean. I’m a new man.Sincerely, EThe real, true E. Heartfelt."
Buffett can buyback a ton without moving the stock much at all. This is a nice 5% a year boost to shareholders.
Let’s not forget the lessons learned from Original Authentic Jay.
"Thanks for allowing me to use this outlet to handle my emotional issues. I get manic excited—we’re going to the moon. I get manic depressed—Buffett is old and stock is stagnant. I wish I enjoyed the emotional stability of you long term holders.Thanks for your patience as I “act out”.Gratefully and humbly yours,E"
25 billion of operating earning x 15 = 375 B for the operating businesses 140 B of cash 320 B of equities = 835 B of intrinsic value This is conservative … in a zero rate environnement
