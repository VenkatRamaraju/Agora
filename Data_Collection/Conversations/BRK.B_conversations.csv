"Hey Jad, flipped any hot IPOOOs lately, bro?"
Everything looks good to me
There will likely be lots of insurance claims coming which could hurt their largest business
"I wonder how GMO investors feel about missing the entire bull market and owning trees, emerging markets, and zero earning cash long term?"
Berkie's and Warren's best years were decades ago...1970s best decade....out-performance declined as Berkie grew bigger and Warren grew older...Warren is disposing of wealth - not trying to accumulate wealth...sorry kiddies...it's ovah.
I like the predictable 3:30-3:45 run up. Sweet
where would Buffetshire be without the fed and 0 per cent interest ? fed says to buffeshire here is free money go buy up companies lay off workers make yourself and few select others richer Buffetshire shareholders love socialism for the rich

I mentioned a double top formation in the low $290’s a couple weeks ago. Many recent buyers ignored the warning and claimed the stock was headed to $300 plus. A rocket ship to $330. Well we lost support at $285 and now we broke $280. Where is support? Probably where WB starts buying back the stock. We are looking at a period of consolidation for these shares. This is not bearish long term and probably blow away all the recent buyers looking for a quick buck. Hopefully WB will be a big buyer in the $270’s.
WEB and Munger laughing at your dead money.
"$12.56 billion of stock repurchase, YTD. WOW"
"$145 billion in cash, making NOTHING for BRK investors"
"As Berkshire shareholder I hope it is buying into Alibaba $BABA too because: - Great fundamentals and cheap price with good growth and moats. -Excellent management and culture (long term oriented, customer centric, solid and sober). -Investment of 10-15 billion usd would be manageable and compares well to great foreign imvestments like the japanese sogo shosha trading houses. - Experience with china byd,petrochina - great results. - Would be a great signal of cooperation and peace between the leading powers us and china. -Last but by no means least: Charlie did it too^^."

Munger should have advised him better since he KNOWS PLENTY about DIVORCE!"
Big discount on TGT today if any of you want to retire some of your BRK.

Raised Kroger stakes as well as Aon. Cuts GM after the big run up. Now GM does not have a dividend and had such a big run I understand the move.

"What a steal here. Check CNBC Berkshire portfolio - all time high by far. Buy now, breakout coming. Soon as WEB can buy again look for $300. August 6 earnings bonanza."
"BRK has had quite a run over the past week. I think this stock needs a breather, it's getting a little high priced. MV would probably agree."

"""As soon as I get my money back, I'm out of here. That would infer that you believe the stock will go up. Interesting. More money has been lost selling at the wrong time."" ~MonkeyMonkey, I'm not stupid. I know BRK is going to hit a run over the next couple of months and I expect it to hit a high of between 310-315. I will most likely wait for the run and sell at around those prices. I'm not going to collect my money back for what I paid in the upper 280's, leave and then watch it run another $20 or so. I will have some patience, but once I get to my target, I'm out. This stock moves too slow for my liking and frequently drops $20-25 from the high after every major run. Go study its chart."
Most stocks with better than expected earning go up shortterm Not Berkshire which goes up long term!
Fairly big volume in the A shares these past few months
"Based on daily prices, Berkshire bought back above this level in 2Q. Plan accordingly."
"Bloomberg reports as their main headline ""Buffett slows buybacks""???? It's miniscule the difference. It was a great quarter!!!"
That cup handle has a nice sharp curve to it on the 6 month chart. It will be a moon landing soon.
Buffetshire sees lots of room to grow in baseball card market predicts 1st year after they buy up all card companies revenues will increase 100% in his view baeball cards have been too cheap for too long and will double the price Headline Buffetshire Sees HUGE GROWTH in baseball cards Kids have lots of money Buffetshire was heard saying as he chuckledand visited with execs from Goldman Sachs.
"Proud of this company, Proud of our Leader."
"Into Google type in CNBC Berkshire portfolio tracker. Our stock portfolio has NEVER been this high. Do what you think is right for you, but know the facts. No one can say if its going to go up or down today or tomorrow but hold and you will be rewarded."
Rumor is Goldman Sachs execs gave Buffetshire a standing ovation when told about the news of Buffetshire buying up all the card companies you knew as a kid say good bye to topps panini donruss score trading cards you knew as a kid they will soon be Buffetshire cards AGoldman exec was heard saying who better to promote since Buffetshire loves baseball almost as much as he loves money on the down side 12 execs from Hold em up Goldman were fired for not thinking of the idea before Buffetshire..
What makes this fund up in a day like this?
"Berkshire portfolio has never been worth more, on the back of a recent big leg up in Apple. Quarterly results will be great with no big catastrophes. Stock is a good value well off the highs around $295. Pretty much a can't lose at these prices."
"In or around 2012, i posted that my byddf investment was returning me annualized gains north of 15%. A famed troll posted that that would not be the case in the next 3 to 5 years.As it turns out, he was right. Here it is 2021, and my current annualized rate of return is 41.4%.What is even nicer is that I paid a little more than Buffett paid when he bought 10% of the company's stock, so Berkshires annualized rate of return on byddf is even higher."
"Did anyone else notice that BRK increased (see page 19) the insurance reserve $10B, from $20B to $30B?"
"Warren, call Powell up and tell him to stop buying so many treasuries and allow the yield curve to move up slowly...let the 10 year hit 1.90. And Warren, buy one of those paintings from the new artist....a cool 1/2 mill and you have an original by H. to spiff your office up."
Warren Buffett. My Hero.
We're like 1 to 2 years from any infrastructure plans helping America -- Congress better pull their heads out cause a lot of people still need sustained monthly help out in America. I don't care who you are or what side of the issues you sit. If congress don't follow through with some heavy people people aid their going to dump the entire US economy!! It would be easy even dump the renters and homeowners aid if you pay people you trickle up and it get people - landlords - banks --simple helps everyone. Same with the kid STIM pay people they pay for food feed their kids.... In any amount congress needs follow through their priorities are all turned around here....
"The 2nd quarter report showed Buffett was buying A shares at $432,536."

What a great opportunity for WB to buy back a ton of stock. Volume already at 4.3 million shares today . I hope he started buying yesterday below $280 but here he has a chance to buy $1-$2b in stock cheap just today. Please buy more next week as well especially if we are trading in the low $270’s. What a nice gift for WB.

Warren is backing up the truck here. What are YOU doing?

"MV, to be honest, you seem like a pretty knowledgeable long-term investor of BRK-B. That said, when do you see this hitting 289 again so I can at least get my money back?? Will we get a jump at earnings or will it continue to go sideways??"

"Warren, your stock is so exciting...look at it go....almost back to May/June levels...Wheeeeeee!"
FACT: Buffett backs up the truck with NO let up on buybacks. He’s buying hand over fist and there has been NO DIFFERENCE in BUYBACK levels at all from $210-$295. NONE.FACT. It’s been $6 Billion each & every quarter.Very very clear: A great buy at $220 doesn’t make a very good buy at $295 “bad”. “Very good”should not be confused with bad.Nomorehomes WARNED at $250. WARNED at $220 You can follow Buffett or watch NoMo squirm and whine at $285….like just below.It’s kinda funny.
Pump!
BOO !!!!!!!!

WE sell our Berkshire shares because these two hoarders are stealing food out of the mouths of their shareholders by refusing to feed us a long overdue dividend relative to their inability to allocate sufficient capital to move the Berkshire needle via intelligent acquisitions and tax deferred gains.
The infrastructure plan is a HUGE catalyst for Berkshire. Big piece of the $579m will go towards updating rail.

"Just read the updated 5th edition ""Essays of Warren Buffett"" by Lawrence Cunningham. My original copy was showing its use.Excellent read for those who want to gain the knowledge about investing."
"If you want me to be critical on some of the things that I have not liked here would be a few:1. Loved the VZ purchase. Buying at 10X FCF roughly long term only more demand nice moat around the business. Nothing every for sure but nice runway for future profits and growth (and close to 5% yield while you wait). Don't see why brk not doubling down on this investment. Seems like could basically acquire 15-20% of this business rather easy and who knows make a tinder for the rest if timing was right. Seems like a logical fit with the energy businesses.2. BAC-The preferred/warrant deal from a decade ago was probably second best deal to Apple. I know they got special permission to purchase up to 25% approx a year ago and could have added another 5% ownership with no problem when the common was still trading in the 20's.3. Seems like we have passed on some no brainer acquisitions that could have offered synergy to other wholly owned businesses. Additionally massive cash pile could be ""put to work"" to help them grow even more-I.E. Carmax-could sell a lot of Geico ins. and car loans through that place. True, I get you might have to pay a somewhat of a premium to buy it all but would think that additional profits made on synergies with other companies would make up the difference on this in a few years."
Good thing I took another breather last night and bought in low this morning ;)
Own 2 shares of this stock. It hasn't done much for me. I will give it time. Can't go wrong with Buffett. Will add to my position as time goes on.
“buybacks. $25 Billion per year pace. Go the distance….”
"Everyone of these moderately traded stocks has at least one lonely poster who goal is to dominate/spam the message board. Basically the natural life cycle is: 1. Keep posting nonsense until others respond. 2. Get into some argument to increase drama. 3. Keep pushing until others mute you. 4. When muted by all make new account and wash, rinse and repeat."
Value stocks are weak again. Growth stocks continue to get more overvalued.
Is “E” actually jad’s alter ego?
I’m very interested to see Berkshire cash position and buybacks this quarter. Their equity portfolio is at 316 billion dollars and this doesn’t even include all their international investments and with cash at 145 billion that’s 461 billion dollars or 69 percent of market cap

bought another share today!
FB is a 1trillion dollar co after only 10 years. Good going Zuck. BRB is only 640 bill after 70 years. Who’s the Oracle now?
Somebody we know got fed up with Berkshire in 2019 and cashed in all of his shares…oops lol. Have to thank him for giving us more shares to scoop up. BRKB has outperformed the S&P over the last year. They still have their magic after all this time.
I heard E is dumping BRKB and doing a SPAC with JAD
Looks like Charlie made a mistake in buying a lot of BABA. I hope he just has warrens ear and isn’t running anything at BRKB
"If this is the action BRK-B gets on the first day after a blowout quarter, I'm not very impressed. We are still well off May/June levels........I will remain patient though......Hopefully we get a run going in the next couple weeks."
Book Value Quarter End looks about $208. Price to book 1 1/3rd. That’s a gimme and would clearly dictate more buybacks relative to the very high price of most stocks. Common sense. There’s nowhere else to go with the cash. And plenty in the coffers STILL for whenever opportunity strikes…..
Warren buffet can buy no shares back this quarter and he’ll get a 10 percent discount on buybacks lol but all I care about this earnings is buybacks and cash position
The BRK Madrassah rocks.

"Geico is a scammer and it makes me wonder if Buffett is too. I've had very bad experiences with Geico auto insurance that borders on fraud. They list my wife's car as financed when it's owned. They list my daughter getting her car in 2019 when they have been insuring it since 2017....And after a car was totaled in an accident, they took the wrong car off the insurance and kept billing me for the car that had the title signed over to them..."
My average cost for BRKB shares is @$168. It is hard for me to add at these levels but I am getting an itch to buy at these levels before earnings the first Friday or Saturday in August. Also think the stock staying below $280 for the last 6 weeks after hitting $295 is very attractive especially with the portfolio outperforming and the large buybacks.
"Well, ProudBRKB FanBoy, I got my money back and then some, so there's lots of reasons to be positive. Yeah, and Buffy is a little old, but he could very well run this ship until he's 105, at which point it might be time for new blood. That all depends on his diet, exercise routine and how many nightly cocktails he consumes [wink-wink].......On a side note, if he croaks, the stock could go south.......Let's hope that doesn't happen......BUT, in the meantime, let's all stay positive ;)"
I feel about this quarter for BRK the same feeling I got when those two boosters returned to the launch pad in sync and under control with flame roaring out of their tail. Absolute Awe!!
Did Bernie mention my name? I hope he's not forgetting his meds. I do wish him well in his recovery.Russ
"I'm retired. Can't see owning bonds when cash pays nearly the same these days. ( Personally believe interest rates manipulated to stay suppressed. ) BRKB is the largest ""single"" holding in our equity portfolio. Alternative investments include some monthly rental income. No lost sleep with Berkshire which in itself represents a dividend of sorts."
Will never sell my BRK.B - 10 years from retirement. Will add to it if...
I glad warren didn’t listen to Charlie about BABA
Looks like Buffy bought right up to this price level actually $286…averaged about $279 per buy.
"If you are an older investor, BRK is definitely a great stock for you. Your goal should be to protect your money and hopefully make 20% in retirement every year which is what I believe the average has been over the long term for BRK. That's a smart move, so kudos to you that have done that. For younger people like myself, my goal is to take a little more risk and try to grow my portfolio because I have a little more time, which I have done over the past couple decades. Some of you think I hate BRK. I do not, it's just a difference in goals related to age and my stage in life. That said, I would much rather have my money here for the short term in this current environment."
"Dear Jonathan, I do believe that if we compare BRK versus S&P over the last 10 years the results will be much different..."

"Congress is going to have to follow through with aid packages. We can't stop on a slight up tick. They need to do it on a Federal level and consist month to month for 6 months to a year. It will pay itself back once we are all employed again. They also need some emergency stuff to happen for people somewhere around 55 to 70. I was reading about this and it true. The virous did force a lot of these people into retirement prematurely. Their now looking at (if their lucky) a below poverty line extended unemployment. Age discrimination is yes against the law but it does exist-and your never going to prove it. Anyway, there needs to follow through and the states are so separated their just beyond reason. The recovery is going to need help up that first three steps of the ladder."

Have to wonder how the buyback of shares and the increase in share price really benefits anyone but a few people already well off did life get better for workers of Buffetshire did fewer kids go to bed hungry did health care get more affordable for more people? none of the above just a bunch of people already rich and now they are richer the fed gives money to Buffetshire and 0 per cent and says go out buy up companies lay off people make them more profitable so you and a select few can be richer... where would buffetshire and shareholders be without handouts from the fed welfare for the rich is all it is the same people who say they hate socialism but get all the benefits from gov handouts

I’m a long term bull on Brk… With that said I just wanted to point out that the earnings were good but not as good as it seems because Q2 2020 was a depressed quarter ( $5513) . If we compare to the same quarter in 2019 it was($6139) and it was ($6893) in 2018 2nd quarter. The operating earnings were more in 2018 than this year same quarter.
"$30 billion + $9 billion in stock buybacks, not to shabby"
Just bought more 
Is the end in sight? Record IPOs in 2021. Record SPACs. Record new participants in to the market. Robinhood IPO. 81 billion in assets. Quadrupled in 2021. Revenue largely from Options and Crypto.
"Really amazing the lack of understanding on here about Berkshire and just any overall understanding of markets from a historical perspective.What you are buying at its core with Brk is a one of a kind insurance (and re-insurance) business that has the ability to underwrite things that no one else can even touch. Even if another insurance company does find these opportunities there is a good chance they will be purchasing re-insurance from Brk to even be able to do the deal in the first place.Second you are buying its group of wholly owned highly diversified companies that throw off 30-40b/yr. NOTE: Roughly the same operating earnings that Amazon has had previous 4 qtrs and has a market cap that is $1Trillion more than BRKThird you are buying an investment portfolio portfolio of $300b managed by one of the best capital alloc. of all time.As a post earlier said the dry powder number is likely $100b if you subtract ins. reserves and cap. reserves for the business. Basically all after tax operating income generated since Q1 '20 has gone into buying back shares which means your basically getting a 4-5% divvy without paying the taxes.To be this one of a kind insurance company and to be able to ""bag an elephant"" you have to have insane amounts of actual money. There are not a lot of good deals right now and make no mistake about it WB is not going to pay 100X forward earnings for something (and be thankful that he won't.) This WILL change as it always has and when it does you want to be the guy with cash. This is always when the real money is made. Things run in cycles. The majority of your small individual investors in the market right now have no idea what a P/E ratio is, how to read any type financial statement, or what is or isn't a good deal in the market.They will get smoked in the end. When they do I want my money with the guy that has the dry powder to pick up the good assets at 30-50 cents on the dollar. The Fed has never propped up things to the level that they have currently. No more levers to pull. This is a story as old as time and brk positions you well long term for it."
It’s a beautiful day. A wonderful life. A marvelous stock.
"Hold, buy. IMO if earnings of BRK were recognized the same as other stocks, if the proper premium were applied due to the lack of risk and positive cash position, if management's superior performance history was given the earned premium, THEN BRK's earned PE would be over 100. Time has a way of causing reality to be recognized."
guess im shorting this today...
"Buyback resume next week, I hope WB pump it harder I want to sell BRK and get back to tech stocks soon"
Growth stocks will climb into earnings season. And value will drop. Will get in in a couple of weeks
"Ignoring the dividends, the S & P 500 is up 100.24% over the last 5 years. According to my attempt at math, that you should check out on your own before simply buying my results, this results in a 14.9% annualized growth rate."
It's not like shooting fish in a barrel. If AAPL BAC and AXP get cut in half then BRK's market cap takes a 100 billion dollar hit. BRK's holdings have had 2 big drawdowns in recent memory and they were substantial. AAPL has been loading up on debt and buying back shares. It is not the same company as it was at the beginning of the cell phone cycle. GLTA.
"Now is a good time to get in, will be 295+ soon."
"Thanks for allowing me to use this outlet to handle my emotional issues. I get manic excited—we’re going to the moon. I get manic depressed—Buffett is old and stock is stagnant.

Well at least WB had now 2 1/2 weeks to buy BRKB below $280. There is a part of me that is grateful that WB is getting this golden opportunity as much as I liked the balance in my account when is was above $290.

"The stock portfolio today is worth $315.5 billion. The annual dividends are somewhere between $4 to $5 billion as a rough calculation. On top of that some of the companies, like Apple are making massive buybacks which are another form of dividend. So is Berkshire. On top of that you have another $145 billion in cash. Shoot you even have the $800 million each year on the $10 billion loaned to OXY. Then you have the earnings from the companies owned outright which is in the billions. I just don't get all the doubt on this company. Eventually, all good things come to those that will but stop and weight. I'm in no hurry."

"How come there is no discussion of Bill Gates on this board? It seems Buffett is terrifically mad at him. Gates reputation is basically ruined--and he may take down the Foundation as well. So, Buffett's charitable plans are a smoldering ruin. Probably was a rather silly idea to give your fortune to the richest man in the world--who really has no need of it. It seems like Buffett made a big mistake associating with Gates--and his gifts appear irrevocable, so he can't get out of it. Gates and Buffett are joined at the hip. Buffett really misjudged Gates's character."

"A lot of you post technical data and numbers of BRK constantly in an attempt to portray yourselves as some genius investor. Most of it is utter nonsense and meaningless in the large scheme of investing. Simply having a basic understanding of market fundamentals, principles and patterns is MUCH more useful when it comes to actually making money in the market. I never get too deep in the weeds with ANY company (never have) and I make a ton of money. The most important attribute of investing is having a good understanding of which companies to invest and TIMING......Spouting off endless technical analysis nonsense in an attempt to make yourself look bright accomplishes absolutely nothing. You can be a numbers geek all day long, but that will NEVER make you a good investor. I see it on here all the time and I just roll my eyes. Probably some of the biggest losers are the ones who post most about technical analysis, and I'll bet if I took a look at your portfolios I would be 100% correct. I don't doubt some of you do it because you think Buffet is some type of wizard of smart and you want to be seen in the same light. Honestly, you should simply quit trying to flatter yourself, because honestly you probably aren't cutting it and nobody cares anyway."

Thoughts about why WB is dumping MRK. Created a large position last year. Now cut in 1/2. Good dividend. Great balance sheet. Has not move much. We got Organon shares. MRK might have an anti viral this fall. I do not understand the selling. Thoughts?

Two pieces of good news today in a horrible tape for BRKB. 1. WB bought a lot of KR and the stock is doing great after earnings. 2. WB hopefully can use this weakness to buy back stock (I hope). I truly wish WB got religion about buybacks earlier and had more conviction when we traded between $190 and $210 for 2 years.Quad expirations tomorrow. Wondering if it that has an impact.
"Berkshire Hathaway reported operating earnings of $6.69 billion in the second quarter, up 21% from $5.51 billion in the same period a year ago.Overall earnings, which reflect Berkshire’s fluctuating equity investments, increased 6.8% year over year to $28 billion in the second quarter.Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett kept buying back Berkshire shares aggressively instead of making sizable acquisitions."

"I believe it was Chester Karass who said, ""In business and in life, you don't get what you deserve, you get what you negotiate."" Proof (one of many) that BRK negotiates better deals, check out the warrants on BAC. per Wikipedia...."" On August 26, 2011, Berkshire Hathaway purchased $5 billion of preferred shares in Bank of America.[100] The investment has an annual interest cost of 6% earning Berkshire $300 million in annual interest. Alongside the preferred stock investment, Berkshire obtained warrants allowing Berkshire to buy 700 million common shares at $7.14 per share any time before September 2, 2021If I pass before my time, my BRK-B shares will be passed on to my wife and son through our trust, so I don't have to worry about hiring a financial advisor because I have Warren Buffett and his team working for me (free of charge) and BRK has way more cash than I ever will ready to deploy. This is why people buy and hold BRK stock forever. Took me a while to drink the cool aid if you will. If you're a short term trader, BRK-B would seem like a safe stock to trade (buy the dip, sell the rip) because you can always hold it (value stock) and while you technically might be putting all your eggs in one basket BRK is highly diversified and more like a mutual fund or ETF in terms of asset diversification."
"Let's say that a particular business grows intrinsic value by 10% annually over time. What happens if 5% of the shares are repurchased annually, in addition?"
I think its important to note that all of Buffett's & Berkshire's tax filings are perfectly LEGAL. The IRS allows tax planning. No one should should pay more in taxes than legally due.

"Buffett has long benefited from owning stocks that reward shareholders through both methods (dividends and buybacks).

Looks like I'm getting my $$$$ back and then some. Come to daddy.
Buffett can buyback a ton without moving the stock much at all. This is a nice 5% a year boost to shareholders.
The stock portfolio is so large that it makes the rest of the company's income look insignificant at times. I noticed that the portfolio is up over $2 billion from just yesterday. I can't help but think that this is one massively undervalued stock.
"If WB is buying at these levels then count me in , calm before the storm on the tech bubble in the rest of the market , people’s republic of China is building a Great Wall on tech companies doing business there , e.g. $TSLA , $DIDI ; bet on america  and stick with $BRKA $BRKB $BRK-A $BRK-B"

With 145 billion in cash this stock should be safer than the S&P 500.
I was concerned about the buy back this quarter . We know WB bought $1.2b befoRe earnings. Then the stock moved too high too fast imho for WB to be a serious buyer. However since late last week WB was given a gift. The stock traded as slow as $272 and we continue to get a chance for WB to buy below $280. I hope WB @10 percent of the float since last Thursday and we get a nice surprise of another large buy back. I hope he bought and continues to buy the stock aggressively below $280.

I admit I get caught up in price appreciation, but for a long term shareholder it would be best if the stock price fell or at least stayed flat for a few years. This would give Warren the opportunity to buy back more shares."
"Warren, I told you before....your revenues are just not growin' much...advertise....paint your railroad boxcars with ads for Geico....Coke...etc.....and Warren, Union Pacific has a Big Boy locomotive....you have nothin' like the Big Boy."

The name’s James. Occupation: Buffoon
Buffetshire has 116 billion in long term debt the bankers at hold em up sachs will make a lot of money refinancing and rolling over the debt
I wonder how much Charlie likes his alibaba purchase now
Is Bill and Melinda dumping a lot of stock? 8th trading day below $280. We we estimate WB bought $6.4b this quarter until June 21. He was buying above $280 so I have to assume he is a big buyer at these levels but the stock is really struggling. Based on the volume since June 21 if he had bought @5 percent of the daily float the buyback this quarter could easily be above $9b. I hope WB gets very aggressive at these levels. I think it is a gift for WB but the stock has not recovered and trading $20 off the highs.
Did Brk have Bezos insured?
$6.4 Billion Buybacks SO FAR 2Q…wow
Very big on BRK/B. Looking to buy SHOP next. Very bullish market. Load up on AAPL while it's cheap !
"WB bought 4,100 share Equivalents between June 30 and July 26. That is roughy $1.8b. I was hoping for a higher number but it is consistent with @1 percent of float a quarter."
"Warren, Bezos has landed...it coulda been you....but you are too cheep."
it's a good sign the Day's range narrowed.
Buffett should buyback stock only above $305 til it shoots to the MOON!
Told some of you to retire some of your BRK and buy TGT after that $21 haircut. Look at it rally today.
In a bear market everything goes down. I own and hope it goes down as want to buy more. Hopefully I'll get the chance
Birkshire should have a book value of 2x. Share price of about $350. I just keep adding on the dips.
Nice buying opportunity for those that see it. I missed buying below $173 because I made the common mistake of thinking it as going lower. Bought more at $276.
"Valuation doesn't matter guys, this is just following certain sectors ETF. buyback also doesn't matter. chart analysis is more important"
I wonder if Buffet is shrewd enough to sell all his APPL holdings at $140. Would be so epic have like 250 billion in cash at market bottom.

Let’s give Warren a hand.

"Who would have known Charlie Munger was a lover of communism and the CCCP. Somebody should remind this crusty old man that free-market Capitalism is how he earned his money. It's amazing how these people become billionaires and all of a sudden forget that.....But it's okay, right, he made his money already.........Who needs Capitalism when you are a billionaire?"
To the moon and beyond.
"Goodnight, Amazon. It was a nice run. Maybe better luck in space."
If you want a good small cap pick I would rec. MLR. Own 80% of world tow truck market. 0 debt divvy plenty of cash on hand. Too small for brk
"The tech bubble is starting to fizzle after earnings. Apple had its run up to 150 and I expect it to remain stagnant around that level or slightly higher until next earnings. It has a 2.4 Trillion market cap, so growth is going to be a little slow for a while. Therefore, I expect value stocks like BRK and others to start making a move very soon. It's about time."
"DEMs should be extending Unemployment federally. There are far to many still unemployed it is going to and already showing spending about -25%. It is just going to take time to level out and they need to have follow through. 55 to 70 year old's and even long term unemployed are going to get wiped out... 401k's, savings, housing and all retirement unrecoverable to them - simply -0- time to re coop. Plus DEMs have -0- plans for a practical re-train aid. They can't even refi to pay for retraining or education upgrades."
"Warren, the SP500 is ahead of your Berkie for the last 5 years...and pays a divvy in top of that....but you know that - don't you?"
"Sorry JAD, pro's say T may have to cut the dividend."
It took me 5 years to buy 3 shares I am 29 i hope when i get to 40 i have 40 shares
"Thanks Brian Moynihan for negative rev growth. C’mon, bro!"
"Warren, which is the most...most boring? You, your stock, or your cult followers - the Buffetteers?....Berkieteers?"
Maybe Brk has peaked for now.
I’m with Warren. We’re both buying.The nut jobs can do otherwise. That’s what makes a market.
Reclaim 50 DMA after two months
Buffett isnt rich enough so he uses money to buy back own shares giving the allusion earnings are better per share that what they really are rather than invest in the companies use the cash to buy more shares making himself and few select others richer they need more money money money half million for a share of buffetshire isnt enough more more more
$300 in the cards?
E=mc2
Big insurance hits coming?
"Morning, Russ."
"Can somebody please explain the ""discord"" posts?"
"BRK-B. The stock lies in the lower part of a narrow and strong rising trend in the short term, and this may normally pose a very good buying opportunity. If the lower trend floor at $285.64 is broken, it will firstly indicate a slower rate of rising, but may also be an early warning for a trend shift. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise 18.19% during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between $337.59 and $351.88 at the end of this 3-month period."
"As soon as the tech cycle halts, this is off to the races again. Good to see Apple rocketing though."

"Hi fellow Berkshire Hathaway friends! Would someone kindly tell me what percentage of the $640,000,000,000 market cap Burlington Northern Santa Fe represents? Thank you and all the best!"
"Warren, big earnings numbers tomorrow will be very exciting, no? You can put a damper on things by saying a few words in that terrible speaking voice and annoying cackle laugh. How long have you been retired now?....last 15 years? Thanks Warren."
"Someone asked what the 20 year return for BRK compared to the S&P was including dividends. I looked up my charts and here is what I have. …Since January 1st 1999 till the end of 2020 ( which is 22 years) for a starting investment of $100,000 BRK was worth $495,511 and the S&P was worth $465,422 including dividends. That’s a 7.2973% compounded annual return for Brk over 22 years. That’s a 7.01 % return for the S&P500over 22 years. ( pretty close).If you continue on with the 2020 ending values till exactly through June 25th 2021 BRK is worth $594,982 and the S&P is worth $530,441."

"Sorry, but Congress, GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER! Their priorities are all messed up and mixed around! I am not some great economist by any means and even I could see MONTHs ago were NOT done yet with economic aid. Their going to have to kick in with emergency FEDERAL aid keep states out of it. Their too conflicted to do any help. GOP states are down like -25% spending and that's 1/2 of the entire country. At best that's going to avg out over the entire US -15% to -12%. It's going to have an impact!!! There just NOW STARTING to act on this?!?!? OMG.... Even if it's agreed in Congress that would be months until they act. That is a $eII of a delay and doe so much harm! WOW"
"""investors should note that BRK.B has a Forward P/E ratio of 24.92 right now. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 14.94, which means BRK.B is trading at a premium to the group."" This article was from Zacks, as if BRK's 300B stocks portfolio just evaporated. if financial site came out with this what do you think normal investor would think......."
I sold everything today. I’m getting out of everything I own except a silver exploration and development company and a silver miner that is just getting ready to ramp up production this fall. GLTA.BTW BRK is going to have blowout numbers this weekend. I’m selling on the news you could say.
Bought my first share at $278. Great long term hold.
said again this stock no beat S&p 500. investment firm run by old grandpas.
Any other companies in the USA that have a 300+b stock portfolio???
"420,000 nice "
3Q…$300.
When people say that this is not a good stock and then give me the reasons that they don’t think that it is and that includes most often times how “the rules of investing have changed.” That reassures me more that I am exactly where I need to be with Brk”I have bought and sold 2 small businesses and currently own 2. Even in this rail it’s really amazing to me that when people are buying a small business they all of the sudden are the ultimate value investor then you ask them what they have in their portfolio and it’ll be stocks that have a PE of 100. Blows my mind. I’m like Would you pay seven or $8 million for a small business that made 100 grand a year but had “crazy growth potential” they laugh and say of course not. I truly believe that the biggest knock with this stock is they make so much money and have so much money on hand they simply don’t have anywhere to invest it￼￼￼. That is a GOOD thing. Sure it’s frustrating at times but the bottom line we keep a loaded gun for when there is actually an opportunity. I am absolutely ecstatic that the stock has not gone up more. I hope that it goes to 250 and the rest of the market takes a big hit. I will double down (and so will WB with the buybacks which is even better)Guaranteed I don’t even need to look at it and will love where I am in 5-10 years.
About the only thing I own up today.Thanks Mr. Buffett.
If he keeps buying back we’re all dead in the water. I guess as long as he makes money he’s not worried about the rest of us.
"Mornin, Russ."
"WEB rewards long term shareholders, plain & simple. If your not an owner, buy Bitcoin, I see post with some Dufus will make you rich by the end of next week"
"Cash pile stays the same, yet still buys back 6B in stock. That is now the standard. Quite impressive. Good place to be. Let#$%$ $300 next week!!!"
Why would a person that believes that BRK is a lousy investment post on this board for more than ten years now?
Prepare for LAUNCH

I think “E” is actually Elizabeth Holmes. Now it all makes sense
It’s hard to see BRKB not go up in price if aapl breaks out again
"Good morning jad, hope all is well bud. Buffett ran out of opportunities and he had to resort to his last option to save his legacy, aggressive buybacks. He refused to buyback the Bs at 2800, pre split, but he loves it now.  take care."
Alibaba is taking off like a ROCKET!
"BRKB market cap is $635b. Portfolio is at 300b. 25b stock buybacks a year. If this continues for 7 years, and the portfolio hits 600b, and the businesses continue to grow, what will the stock price be at? Double? 580??? I guess I can wait and enjoy the higher future price… very bullish"
"Warren, MRNA is up like 5 or 6 hundred percent in a year....your stock hasn't done that over the last 15 years. Do you own any MRNA, Warren?"
"Making it difficult to find anything worth buying.....KKR raked in about $59 billion in the three months ended June 30, driven largely by the initial closings of the latest North America buyout fund, global infrastructure fund and core private equity fund, New York-based KKR said in a statement Tuesday."
You can buy this for $287 and the greatest investor of all time will buy it back from you if needed for $286. Kinda seems like a no brainer.
Now if we can just get CPNG to start moving. Stellar buying opportunity at these low prices if anybody is interested. This will be a $200 stock in the next two years. Go check it out. Earnings are tomorrow.
Faith. Rewarded. Again.OAJ
Great buy. Wish I had more.
