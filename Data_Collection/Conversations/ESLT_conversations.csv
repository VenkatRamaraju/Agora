"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.

"As some may know, ESLT is partially owned by ""Elta"", which in turn is owned wholly by ""IAI""(Israeli Aerospace Industries). There is a new product about to come on the market known as ""Arrow"", developed by ""IAI"". This is groundbreaking technology that allows total maneuverability of missile right up to point of impact whether outbound land strike (or)as an inbound offensive missile defense option. It will put the IBM outt'a business since trajectories of IBM's are predictable? But who will make /produce the hardware? Might it be ESLT? Opiners welcome!!"
Why the huge selloff for this stock only? What did I miss?
New US Army contract. It will turn on this news. Should open around $137.
"ER results are good but not a blow out. Expanding backlog is good news for coming quarters. Stock fell less than 1% in Israel so we should expect a pull back that is somewhat exaggerated, but will recover in coming weeks. Hopefully will get an opportunity to add a few more shares."

"This stock is in most defense ETF’S yet it’s not widely known, thus the few comments here. Israel does brilliantly on their much needed defense technology. In a shaky market it’s nice to own a less volatile, dividend paying, rising PPS INVESTMENT."

I guess I am the only one here. That makes me happy to not have to battle with anyone. No doubt they hit their target. No pun intended.
Good price action to all time high....but volume remains anemic.
"Hey, I'm *relatively* new to trading so i'd love if somebody could explain this to me - elbit seems to be doing very well, they've been awarded two new contracts and by all accounts seem like their defense incomes have not been too affected by covid-19. We can even see the spikes where the contracts were accepted. Also, their EPS is lower than Northrop and GE's. Yet, their stock price continues to fall on a constant downward trend, and quickly re-lowers (bears? idk) itself whenever it gets a boost due to a contract? Can anyone reason why this is? Are people just that bearish on the Air Force's slow removal of it's a-10 fleet?"
"this stockis about to fly, 5 huge contracts from beginning the year !"
"Pull back seems to be over now, time for another 2-3 month rally of 20-30% gains"
