So Trump inadvertently mentioned that his wall is 'wired'https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-border-wall-california-wired-immigration-us-mexico-a9111721.html...I wonder if Elbit is doing the tech since they've already done this before :https://theintercept.com/2016/08/05/israeli-company-that-helped-build-gazas-wall-is-less-sure-about-donald-trumps/

"Hey, I'm *relatively* new to trading so i'd love if somebody could explain this to me - elbit seems to be doing very well, they've been awarded two new contracts and by all accounts seem like their defense incomes have not been too affected by covid-19. We can even see the spikes where the contracts were accepted. Also, their EPS is lower than Northrop and GE's. Yet, their stock price continues to fall on a constant downward trend, and quickly re-lowers (bears? idk) itself whenever it gets a boost due to a contract? Can anyone reason why this is? Are people just that bearish on the Air Force's slow removal of it's a-10 fleet?"
Congrats to the long! Hopefully it will get more and more exposures so that the volume will push the price to its rightfully higher and higher level.
"As some may know, ESLT is partially owned by ""Elta"", which in turn is owned wholly by ""IAI""(Israeli Aerospace Industries). There is a new product about to come on the market known as ""Arrow"", developed by ""IAI"". This is groundbreaking technology that allows total maneuverability of missile right up to point of impact whether outbound land strike (or)as an inbound offensive missile defense option. It will put the IBM outt'a business since trajectories of IBM's are predictable? But who will make /produce the hardware? Might it be ESLT? Opiners welcome!!"
It is surprising that analysts in the home country don't appreciate this company. At $5billion [RTN $44billion] with exposure to all the right areas of business. Electronic border wall anyone?
