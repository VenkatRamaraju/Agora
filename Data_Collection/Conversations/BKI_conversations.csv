I've been w/ BKI (BKFS) since it's IPO and really am impressed w/ its growth. I lament my small position & regret not purchasing more. My question is when will management start paying dividends?

"“Our sensitive analysis also highlights the significant upside of the project would ENJOY if our iron ore prices are ABOVE our US$70/t [SEVENTY DOLLAR] estimate or the premium for higher grade iron ore products increases with stricter environmental regulations [mentioned probably because of BKI’s sublime environmentalsustainability].CURRENT IRON ORE PRICES (US$186/t) *even higher now and we’re 68% pure* and high-grade premiums (US/$72/t) would RESULT IN A SOTP VALUATION OF $8.16/sh, a 1357% upside to the current share price.” -Hanamm Partners, on $BKI.TOThe valuation based on US$70/t is $1.56. Offtake itself will get us to that point imhoWe’re up 450% almost in 6 months on no binding news. McKinney even said $BKI.TO will react explosively on the next press release only awaiting legal/PR oversightAnd projected earnings lines up with this."
I bought into BKFS on it's I P O ( $27.03) and am impressed with it's growth. I read news on them of acquisitions and other board decisions. They have a talent pool that is gaining them a larger share of this market and are top tier oriented. All companies have dips and adjustments.

I bought BKFS shortly after it's IPO on 5/21/16 ($27.03). I did my research and decided that this was an play due to the demand for this type of data mining and the field they were sectoring on. I only have one regret. I should've doubled my initial investments instead of the conservative leveraging in my portfolio. I profess that they will continue this very nice return for the foreseeable future as our financial and real estate firms progress!

Bought BKI in the 40s. I was immediately attracted to this company as soon as I came across it. My only regret is not taking a bigger position. Currently at a 41% gain. I anticipate $75 a share or more in the future.

yes I agree that BKFS is a solid investment. I did my due diligence when I purchased it shortly after it's I.P.O. ..a little over $27.00. My only ruse was not buying more. (300)
