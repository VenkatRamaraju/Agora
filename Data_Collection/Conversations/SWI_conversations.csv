"Got hacked was supposed to protect government sites, gonna drop price"
I would say its safe to say we have new support confirmation at 21 dollars a share. Breakout success! good to see..
"SWI will announce earnings 04/24/2019. On 4/11/19 SolarWinds acquired Samanage, a SaaS-based IT service management platform (like Service Now - NOW). Looking forward to this cloud management powerhouse's earnings report next week."
Shortie was short selling the 16.10's.. Not sure that was a good move but it may push this back to 15.46--check the short share volume on Friday..
"Those of you that bought Friday, not a good move. More and more is coming out about Companies that use SWI that were compromised. This company is in serious trouble. I predict BK by summer 2021."
stock halted?
"Where have managers and IT guys during the hack? Most likely, they worked from home watching movies and trading stocks rather working on their jobs: monitor the network and logs."
"good company, coming back after bad press"
Stock price will test lows and drop to $14 before end of Jun 2021
Solarwinds on every new channel this weekend. Single digits next week for sure
This previous month have been procuring $14 trillion week after week having contributed $17 billion and working with Mr Nolasco exchanging signals. modest and solid man. Contact Mr Nolasco's signs by means of Telegrm@Kanielnolasco12

Just read the notice from CISA. Yikes.
SolarWinds is up 7.02% to 15.71
I wonder how many of the 3200 employees at SolarWinds are going to lose their jobs over the ineptitude of the single IT Administrator who set the password “solarwinds123” on their update server? Are they in jail yet? Have they lost their house yet?
Who will be new customer?
Let's hook the controls to nuclear reactors to the internet.
I suspect we wont see $18 price levels again in a while!
Canada pension plan investment board Bought $315M for 21.97$ a few days ago. Do you really think they are going to lose?

"Everyone is piling into other IT security companies because of the expectations that there will be more money spent in coming years on security software/equipment etc.And I totally agree with that assumption. Where I do disagree is that those companies will benefits at the expense of Solarwinds. I think its existing customers won't switch because its not easy to make a switch (the so called MOAT).Plus I think Solarwind will also benefit from the increased investment in IT security spending, not at the same scale as its competitors but still it will be able to increase its revenue consistently.The risk i see is if there is a negligence, civil or criminal, by the management. But as long as russia is taking the entire blame for this attack, I think this is a good entry price for the long term investors."
$SWI SELL ALERT!!!
Wait until the downgrades also. Probably coming this week.
"It does not appear investors really understand what happened here. This is much more serious than what is being reflected by the stock price. Hackers not only breached SolarWinds network, but they appear to have been able to breach their source code repository for at least one of their key products. They then appear to have been able to modify the code without detection. Then it appears that code was published into production by SolarWinds themselves and made available to their thousands of customers in the form of updates. Government agencies and enterprise level organizations have robust IT departments and information data security policies that adhere to best practices guidelines that are published by various organizations. These best practices always recommend keeping critical applications patched and up to date. Furthermore, companies like SolarWinds who do business with the government and enterprise level entities generally follow best practices associated with releasing software patches and updates. These practices almost always require the software company to publish an MD5 hash that allows the customer to verify that the patch or update they have downloaded and are going to apply/install, is genuine. This is done to prevent a customer from downloading a malicious patch that was produced by a third party hacker. In other words, the MD5 hash allows the customer to verify the patch was generated by their vendor and not by a malicious third party.In this case, the vendor appears to be the one that published the malicious patch/update. This goes well beyond negligence and creates enormous liability for SolarWinds. Government agencies, security firms, tech companies and other enterprise level organizations appear to have been impacted. There is potentially untold billions of dollars in liability that SolarWinds faces, much more than any insurance policy is going to cover. This event is not going to just be reflected in a bad quarter. This is going to reverberate at this company for many years to come and could spell their ultimate demise.The content of this post are my personal opinion based on my general understanding of software development lifecycles, information data security best practices and public information about the SolarWinds hack."
"Cyber problems, cyber security, Solar winds is involved with cyber security."
The numbers are great Cloud Growth is just getting started. The acquisition was a brilliant move.
Lol shorts are getting absolutely slammed
Do you think they will have decrease in growth or will lose exiting client?
"Bought 800 shares @14.11/share, Sold all of them @17.20/share today. Will buy more if it dips again @12-14/share range."
I can imagine another company working any harder than this one moving forward
The Director will be indicted for Insider Trading.
$16 min
10 bucks around the corner another 40% drop coming 
Monday predictions?
Downgrades starting. Just released. Get out.
"Solarwinds will die a death by one thousand paper cuts. Each day since the disclosure of the security vulnerability, more reports of impacted customers become public. The damage to these customers who entrusted SW to secure their systems won't be fully known for years."
"The only way to stop hacking is to handle it like America did during the 50's and thru the 60's with the atomic threat with Russia and China. Of course, I am not talking about striking back with nuclear missiles. They called that ""Mutual Assured Destruction"" BUT WE SOULD HAVE A NEW VERSION! If any country tries to hack into our systems we should have a virus to Totally destruct the assailant. We could call it Assured Destruction. We should make it known to the world that if you try to hack into our computers our computers using viruses would automatically destroy your computers throughout your country!"
"INSIDER / TUTES JUST SOLD USD 550 MILLION WORTH OF SHARES IN DECEMBER. WANNA BUY THE DIP AT $18? SURE, UP TO YOU :)"
"Notice no matter how bad the news is, this stock is not tanking. Institutions own it, and they are keeping it propped up as they rotate out. Hard to do when you own over 90% of the shares. If any run to the hills this stock will tank so fast nobody will be able to stop it."

So who will benefit from SWI’s breach?
SolarWinds Corporation is down 6.30% to $17.26
"If you don't sell before close you will find yourself -15% pre-market tomorrow on bad news. Bad news is almost a given. Be smart and close your position, and join the short."
"Not reading much news about the apparent insider trading that occurred in the weeks leading up to the disclosure. Are the massive stock sales by the executives and the few major investors being investigated? Or, is the timing only “a coincidence” as suggested by The Telegraph article?"
This company is worth zero. Let the lawsuits fly and the insider trading indictments begin!
They had some interesting insights about SWI on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
federal government has a vital interest in helping SWI discover and solve exactly how the hack took place----may be news shortly that will help SWI
Sinking ship! No matter how you look at it. We can see $15 before EOW. More lawsuits coming in!!!
Bought in at $18. Is the drop (some hacking news) permanent? Why wouldn't it go back up if it had the potential?
Patience on this one. It will be right back to where it was in under a month. This is the king of security software.
"Thinking about investing, any advice?? Seems like no one has too much to say about it."
Looks like a dead cat bounce today good time to sell before it goes lower!
"Wow the financial statement looks legit, turns out cyber incident didn’t cause too much damage to the company, above $20 soon"
Buy the dip or wait?
What’s going on? Drop 8% with no news?
this is catastrophic!
Pinning the stock. Hilarious
cup and handle forming?
No one is here
I applaud those buyers that are keeping this stock propped up. Perception can be VERY expensive. But they have unlimited dark money funds to make the market do whatever it wishes. This is proof that money is power. Any other company would have lost 50-60% of market value for what they did to the world.
"rather than talk about today's price, I'll offer up some technical info you can read about what the hacking software did/does and the impact for IT to ""fix it"" if that's possible. https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/ and https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-defender/new-threat-analytics-report-shares-the-latest-intelligence-on/ba-p/2001095 make your own conclusions.. this is nasty, well thought out and will be difficult to get rid of."
"Face it, SolarWinds sails only appear to be effective. The reality is that upon inspection they may be moth eaten....threadbare and on the verge of disintegration.Such is also the integrity of your investment.Even at $18 it is likely to rip when exposed to the the slightest additional wind.The history is no longer relateld to reality.""Lucky"" insiders just happened to sell at a opportune time.Who knew what.... and when did they know it? (the old Watergate question once again)"
"I am seeking a shareholder in SolarWinds, holding duration the longer the better. Please PM me!"
Halted?
"I expect a bounce up Monday. Could possibly go lower after, but doubt bankruptcy. NKLA was a proven fraud and scam and is still worth billions with no revenue."
Over 25% of their value wiped out from one hack....guessing Solar Winds might be more alert going forward.
I decided to buy. Going to get 20k shares.
"""Buy the dip"" at $18 now, and you get the chance to""Average down"" at $5 later. :)1 Lawsuit a day, takes 5 percent away."

Got in this company back in July @ $18.60... Got out 2 days ago just a few pennies below that... I'm OK with that. Glad I got out.
It is the spin off of NABL
why is this manipulated....
"From Barron's article: Hackers Accessed Treasury Department Emails, Dozens of U.S. Companies. Article states: ""SolarWinds was warned as early as 2017 about weak security measures, Bloomberg reported, when a former employee created a 23-page cybersecurity presentation that outlined measures he said the company needed to employ to ward off attacks.The company has said it is working to understand the extent of the hack and cooperating with law enforcement.""Does this sound like the new to buy? MM helping big guys unload positions to retail bag holders."

We'll see what's going to happen in the next days. SolarWinds Inc. is an American company that develops software for businesses to help manage their networks, systems, and information technology infrastructure. It is headquartered in Austin, Texas, with sales and product development offices in a number of locations in the United States and several other countries - The Orion Platform offers a single architecture that scales to manage the most complex and geographically dispersed IT environments.SolarWinds scalability engines are designed to provide monitoring and management for large enterprise-class infrastructures. Additional polling engines allow you to scale up to 400,000 elements on a single Orion Platform instance while additional web servers scale the number of supported users. With Enterprise Operations Console (EOC), you can centralize and simplify data management of multiple instances in a single, consolidated view."
"Today's weakness - yesterday the company held an analyst day. It ran long, and by the time management got around to the financial update, the market was closed (probably intentionally timed that way). Although the update was fairly harmless, management did indicate that it would offer subscriptions as an alternative way to purchase, sometime in mid 2020. Subscriptions increase deferred revenue, but create a head-wind to revenue. A switch from license to subscription has dented many a good software stock. Management went out of its way to indicate it was just going to offer, not make a wholesale switch, and that the impact would be minimal. But the investors in the room probably got a bit nervous. Just my take."
SolarWinds has beat estimates each of the last four quarters including this one just reported.It seems like investors are getting out of stocks right after earnings reports. This is causing share prices to go down. Nobody has patience anymore.Same thing happened to Microsoft and Apple.
"The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has ordered all US federal agencies to update the SolarWinds Orion platform to the latest version by the end of business hours on December 31, 2020.- They won't stop the contract. That's why I am bullish in the SHORT term."
"Going to $0, sad!"
"Breaking! WOW the breach occurred in March. So this is HUGE! Damage is only starting to come out. Tons of systems compromised at the highest level of government. Data breach, stealing etc.... NOT LOOKING GOOD!"
15.60 buying large---the news is in the stock..Notice the bounce--technicals don't lie.. Shorts will cover when this hits 17.50
I'm simply amazed this outfit is still in business. I guess there must be SWI devotees similar to the those that follow Apple. The world is weird.
"Lol, Palantir is about to scoop up every remaining contract Solarwinds had...Thiel LOVES monopoly!"
"bouncing back to $18, its not a tool that can be thrown out easily - especially in the monitoring space. Most places have to patch it and renew and move on."
The new CEO of those company is amazing … stay tuned for what he will do .
This stock could hit $10

Dips are being bought--this will terminate the short sellers under 16.00
They had some interesting insights about SWI on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
SolarWinds is down 6.41% to 17.24
The BIGGEST HACK in HISTORY and this company was the delivery tool for it. The US Government is purging this company out as fast as they can reboot all their systems. Bye Bye SolarWinds.
Shorts are covering--14.81 is support...I dont think this drops any further and in fact think it bounces to 16.05..
kind of hard for SWI to make money if your product is the source of malware and client companies warned not to use.
"$SWI is NOT going anywhere but down!!! The breach was HUGE! Federal government investigations, possible inside trading and lawsuits are starting to pour IN!!! See you at single digits!"
Silver Lake + Bravo OWN 70% of Solarwinds. The IPO was at 15$. Do you really think they are going to lose money? 
"Forming a double bottom; good short term bullish indicator. I don't know if this stock is any longer a ""long term"" investible security, but could see $6-8 upside over 6 months in 2021. Just my opinion."
12 by Thursday. Everybody's bailing before Christmas
There goes the money tree
I would not be short here---getting acquired by MSFT....Dream...
$SWI SELL ALERT! News are out and spreading. Software compromised and many customers affected. The damage is still being assessed.
Buying buying buying
"Watch for the volume to ""ramp up,"" shall we say? : )"
"We still can't predict the impact of the security breach on revenue. If there's a significant hit, the stock can easily go down another 30%-50%. If on the other hand, the Q1-2021 results will not show significant decline, even if just a small decline, then the share will jump.So - no, the news are not yet priced in because we don't really know the most important news: impact on revenue."
It’s opening day! Who’s jumping in
I work in Cybersec and this hack is overblown. BUY THE DIP
The government should quickly seize the assets of outgoing CEO Kevin Thompson who is scheduled to retire early in Jan 2021. The liability from the compromise will be immense.
The story at the WaPo about the sale of SWI stock may be a severe complication to SWI constructing a narrative that can save what was a good and respected company. 10:55 AM EST - Posting time.
"Silver Lake and Bravo owns over 90% of this stock. No matter what happens, they will prop it up with billions on the line. They will not let it realize the facts. They don't want to take the losses, thus, they prop it up hoping others will buy in so they can rotate out."
"Not enough known yet. Was it an inside job, where some sleeper agent slipped malware into the update? I'm sorry to see SWI getting creamed - maybe they deserve it, maybe not. I don't know anything about this world (don't own SWI) but it seems our open society provides opportunities for malicious actors. This might have happened to any similar company if it was infiltrated by foreign agents."
Why is the stock not dropping as hard as i expect it to?I expect - force majeur customer clauses gonna get invoked- shareholder lawsuits incoming Isn't shorting this FREE MONEY? or am i missing something?Can someone help me here..
"Why this stock has not plummeted to ZERO is beyond me. The face years of client, government and investor lawsuits; not to mention they are a Russian Stooge. I hope they go broke."
"As an ex partner of theirs, they probably should have made the product better than being a hard close sales company, which is all they were."
$14.93 in after hours trading. wonder who is buying this now
This will slowly decay to 10 bucks!!
Shorts are quiet today
Finally CISA and the FBI admit they were hacked. IT is all coming out.
Iam not even worried for 2 seconds. This is almost March level. Which means you can’t find a better time to buy. You buy when there is panic and I hope trumps speech will cause another crash tomorrow
"Password is 1234? That's the same password that's on my luggage, sad!"
Can someone tell me what just happened? I feel like throwing up
"SolarWinds Corporation CANNOT play the ""victim"" card here... they protected their update distribution server with the following password: ""solarwinds123""This is professional negligence at the highest degree!!"
Anyone buying this stock will only feel pain. Going BK after it's all said and done
$SWI I suspect some big contracts will be cancelled and/or reworked because of the bridge of security. New potential clients will be looking elsewhere. I think we can anticipate further bleeding in the stock price. Wouldn't be surprised to se $15 levels.
Any word about treatment of SWI options holders? I can't find anything.
Those appear like pretty good earnings to me.
NATO is now investigating $SWI this is going to bleed folks.... the news are only starting to come out!!
This is the “Go to” management software for Cloud Computing.This stock is undervalued.
Are you thinking about buying the dip?Titanic’s Dining Room Manager started running a “50% off” on all entree’s when the lower levels flooded.
SolarWinds have a bigger problems working Dominion systems and the back end is CCP gov investment and control.CEO already handing over the US passbook.
"The stock hasn't went into a free fall yet because its being propped up as if they are innocent, the cat is out the bag. Its a Chinese operation. Dump now or you'll be screwed. Buy some puts."
REVEALED: SolarWinds Director Sold $45.7 MILLION in Stock Options Last Week Before CISA Announcement Sunday
"Microsoft itself said that it found the malicious SolarWinds update within its network, but that it found no evidence of access to “production services or customer data.”"
"Weird that the company can stay in business after this. I mean, who's going to touch their solutions now.Think of Arthur Anderson after Enron. Out of business. That made sense.This does not."
I am waiting for SWI's 2.2.21 earnings report before I buy.
I have no idea how SWI is still above 14$. This company will go bankrupt after what happened.
Market Makers are doing a good job creating a lot of retail bag holders here.
"Breaking: NOT GOOD!!!!! Top executives including CEO, CFO and EVP of Corp DEV sold together over 15 millions worth of shares prior to the breach! The timing of the sale seems rather perfect, given they sold at an average of $21+ a share"
Don't be surprised when you see Chinese connections on this and other US companies.
Nowhere to go folks but down! Many companies are only starting to disclose their exposure to Solarwinds vulnerable software. We will see lower levels!
"???? Security researcher Vinoth Kumar told Reuters that, last year, he alerted the company that anyone could access SolarWinds' ( SWI ) update server by using the password ""solarwinds123"""
National Nuclear Security Administration has control over our nuclear weapons were also hacked. This is the biggest HACK EVER and we have not even found who was responsible other than it was SolarWinds that infected everyone. Imagine the US Government unplugging SolarWinds over malware in their CODE.
"There is a real need for centralized network management and security tools. The systems are so complex that you have to have that automation. Solar Winds provides valuable and needed software. I don't know how they did it but Russians probably paid someone on the inside and got someone on the inside and were able to infect the solar wind software. Then the solar wind software itself was the conduit to carry that Trojan into all those different networks. Sophisticated, but not hard to imagine. A suitcase full of money is all that the Russians needed."
This will around 12.50 end of week
Buyers at the 15.60----this goes to 17.50
"Things like that happen all the times The hacks that left us exposed in 2017It was the year nothing seemed safe.Bombshell hacks were revealed one after another in 2017, from an Equifax breach that compromised almost half the country to global ransom campaigns that cost companies millions of dollars.https://money.cnn.com/2017/12/18/technology/biggest-cyberattacks-of-the-year/index.htmlMillions of US government workers hit by data breach in 2014. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-33017310"
SWI: misleading name so called Solarwinds. They contains and harbors CCP Hackers hacking US gov - time for FBI to shut them down and delisted from stock exchange - ZEROOOO $ coming NEXT WEEK or FEW WEEKS
I wouldn’t hold over the weekend!!! It’s gonna dump come Monday!!
"Big guys are trying to keep this up, SWI has no value without proper Security￼. Like selling a car that doesn’t run"
The news is already out. Not sure if this will go down any further.
When will we get NABL shared ?
It’s going back to the $10 soon
I’m also surprised it’s not tanking more. I was expecting single digits today.
I have feeling that this company is a mess and lack of the basic software development management process. The CEO should resign.
"Biggest HACK ever on earth and SWI was the Trojan horse. Question is, were they hacked or is this plausible deniability? The BIGGEST HACK EVER. The planet was literally hacked. CISA was going to turn in the report about the most secure election ever, until they also realized early this week, that they were ALSO HACKED and still was."
No one in their right mind would do business with SolarWinds now . This company is going bankrupt in 2021.
BREAKING NEWS: $280 Million worth shares sold prior to the breach!!! Inside job????
"CELZ, a Millionaire maker with a cluster of strong integrals that will uncoil like a Catapault bonce discovered.Target, $10"
Guys. Has the price really reached $22? Seems too good to be true
listen to all the doomsday retail investors. today solarwinds is one of my top performers lol
When law enforcement officials busting down their doors. Hurry up the spreaders and programmers are running 24/7 now.
"$SWI There is nothing stopping the fall. This is much bigger than we can think... 9 months of infiltration, super sophisticated attack, that went on and only got caught by #FEME looking/auditing at over 50K records of source code. Imagine the damage! Data leak and business compromised at all levels. You can tell me all you want but this stock is heading south. We can easily see $12-$15 levels in the next few days. Lawsuits will be massive!!!!"
Why is this going up?
Insiders that sold with knowledge of this will go to jail!
SELL ALERT: Just added 5000 shares on a Short position in here before short selling is stopped. The news are too negative to stay on the side lines. Damage control in place... $FEYE also falling on the news.
So anybody that bought after 12 July isnt entitled to the spinoff shares and just takes a 40% hit. Man that has got to hurt.
Getting bought out---25.-- shorties lose...
Timberrrr
This going to be a penny company soon. Losing all the US Government and enterprise contracts.
$SWI Tutes are selling in 100s so the share price doesn't dive to 0 and retails are picking up hoping to buy cheap...This is so painful to watch..I cannot believe the ignorance of so many on the gravity of this breach and the fall out once the news reports come out bit by bit..
Are you still Using Facebook? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal
If Solarwinds survives this that would be amazing. I can't imagine coming to my boss and asking to purchase one of their products. They need massive PR to explain how this won't happen again. And PR is exactly what this low-key company is not good at.
"If the keeper of the keys to the castle can't keep them safe, what chance do the rest of us have."
Next stop--18.50....
Anybody knows when we will get NABL stocks ?
These guys r done. Its gonna take a name change and at least 24 months for this stock to recover. The biggest hack in mankind's history.
"Run run run, solar winds is chinses a chinese intelligence operation. Its been confirmed."
The Stimulus bill includes billions for updating security software...Contracts are binding--which means These guys get the cash...
Why silverlake would've sold if they didn't knew the jig was up? disclaimer: Our question is rather rhetorical.
Solar Winds new motto: Free Russian Malware Included!

Yeesh first Feye then SWI..
Just the beginning customers will start leaving this company 
Hacking is part of the game. Even if they get a new contract with a different compagny or plateform the same kind of issues might happen again.
ties to the Dominion voting system as well...
Oh no
The cyber war we are in is unprecedented. Companies like Solarwind cannot expect a good future when their products was used to hack the world. Sad to say but this company is going bye bye.
following - hope to see a dip below $18 to buy... maybe $18.20 target.
Going back to 14 and below. Typically dead cat bounce.
"The first think they need to do right now is change the name ""SolarWind"" to ....? They are not solar or wind company."
"This board has been abandoned, why is that?"
hahahhaha why this is even going up .....
I get tired of hearing sophisticated attack. No unsophisticated protection.
Not covering until 10.
