Should break $50 with the next Dist. Increase in 2 weeks..if not before.
DKL reached an all time low at 15.76
Insiders bought .
"I'M not a Zacks fan,but they had good things to say about DKL."
"With the G.P.now in the mid-$20s i'm less concerned with a ""roll up""@ a heavily discounted price."
Last day to buy and get the Distribution..X Monday
IDR going away a good thing.Upcoming Krotz Springs Drop a good thing. Both events add to DCF..Going forward however the financing option of trading stock to DK for assets will become increasingly limited.
Got lucky. Bought bought in 2 days a go. Nice close
Another dividend increase to $.77 this quarter; XDIV 8/02 I think.
May see the value of MVC Contract in light of Texas producers taking production and earnings Hits from the big freeze. Especially with the ramp up of W2W.
Delek Logistics Partners is up 6.06% to 33.80
DKL is down 6.10% to 38.00
Why the meteoric rise before the ex-dividend date?
See 8k filing..good summary
just started following. I like the dividend potentials here.
Wouldn't be surprised to hear about it dropdown on Wednesday...they can handle Krotz Springs without equity..
Delek Logistics Partners reached a 52 Week high at 41.56
"DKL will surge higher at some point during quarter#1 of 2018. Expect it to occur upon closing of parent & General Partner Delek's absorbing Alon USA assets held at the moment in ALDW. Following the ""big swallow,"" DK will be dropping down assets formerly held by ALDW into DKL thus fattening the calf as it were."
"The actual EPS for 4Q of 2020 was $0.94, missing the aggressive target of $1.13 by $0.19. Now, adding all the actual EPS of 2020 totaling $4.14, misses the target of $4.18 by only $0.04 does not warrant the more than 7% share downturn. IMHO this is manipulation, considering the demand and price of natural gas and gasoline continue to rise making DKL future growth more likely.Look for the future EPS trend for 2021 of $4.96 and 2022 @ $5.24,...very ""aggressive"". A conservative estimates of $4.70 and 5.05 would still look progressively good and easier to beat, thereby the share would go up instead of down. IMHO only. Good luck everyone!."
Delek Logistics Partners reached a 52 Week high at 33.80
Beat the heck out of earnings and still going down. Something bad in the Conference Call ?????
@gene Do you know why the pull back in this stock yesterday in a up day market? There does not seem to be a lot of active conversation on this board. I am just trying to figure out what drive the structure of the share price.
Distribution raised for 31st straight quarter..Small raise but in line with their prior guidance of 5% annual growth..
Less than a month away from another Distribution incresse..35 Quarters in a row..
With Brent approaching $60 wink to webster pipeline space if any is not contacted should be a Premium..
Why so weak the past week? Not seeing any news or analyst calls?
Why is this stock price so low given the very high yield and historic record of dividend increases? Any insights?
We get a raise this week....imo
We should see a price with a 5 infront of it sometime in the midst of 3 more Distribution increases in the remainder of the year...
another divvy raise. Like clockwork.
ER tomorrow.
Insiders are selling this stock .https://www.smarteranalyst.com/new-blurbs/the-evp-cfo-of-delek-logistics-dkl-is-selling-shares/
Delek Logistics Partners reached a 52 Week high at 41.00
"This is simple math. All that has to happen is DKL buys the mothership for a 1 for 2 stock swap. The total number of combined shares outstanding will be reduced. The amount of combined debt outstanding will be exactly the same. The free cash flow available for dividends will actually increase for the DK holders, who are the only ones that matter, since DK owns DKL. I think this would be a remarkable market wake up call!"
Nice nice
Should report earnings and raise the Distribution next week..
"DKL, I'm convinced, is soon going to run upwards. Parent Delek (DK) has made it clear very recently that it is preparing to drop down assets formerly partsbof ALDW's operation. Now"
Glad I got into this one in the teens. I missed the March bottom.
Closer and closer to the 34th straight quarter of Dist.increases.
Why up 11% after hours??
Certainly one of the best performers of the Midstream group in 2020.I guess if you raise your payout every quarter you attract support. Should get another Distribution increase toward the end of January..
Delek Logistics Partners reached a 52 Week high at 40.19
DKL reached a 52 Week low at 26.15
Double digit yield and another distribution increase in April highly likely...and july...and October..
Dist.release suggested another Dropdown.Should hear more when they report earnings.
another divvy raise........like clockwork...
DKL reached a 52 Week low at 28.28
Small insider sales will likely preclude the company from issuing Equity anytime soon.
Delek Logistics Partners is down 5.25% to 41.33
Wink to webster 15% share is potentially 50mm annual barrels of transported product net to DKL interest..Big number..choose your own per barrel cash flow assumption.
Last Quarter declared on the 27TH..So my guess Dist. goes up next week..
With the wink to webster pipeline delivery of some oil in October and the JV ramping up throughout 2021 past investments are set to begin to pay off in a significant way ...
Back over 40. Buying ahead of the distribution increase
"This is not even that weird. What mother-ship owns the little partnership called, EPD. No one! It is a stand alone venture, that is the biggest in the entire oil industry. Now, would they be better off to simply declare them selves a C-Corp, probably not now with corporate rates getting ready to melt up after the election. It is a match made in election hell, but we have to survive this."
My only regret about this stock is I didn’t load up back in March when it was around $6. My first entry was at $17 and have added along the way. I’m averaged in at $20 and it’s one of my favorite holdings. Company is very well managed.
Delek Logistics Partners is up 6.12% to 46.49
Very upbeat call.Surprised they discussed the 2020 possibility of added Dropdowns ..indicated additive to DCF and more important would reduce Debt Metrics to below the current level which isn't high enough to be a potential problem....Recommend reading the Call Transcript or listening to replay.
what a short squeeze!
Anyone still here?
"In spite of positive mention on SA; I'm expecting and end to payout growth. Entering maintenance period, and debt is too high making interest payments going higher as rates increase. They really need to get their debt under 4×EBITDA or better. Many dividend payers having same problem. This is an early warning; not gonna happen right away; it may even go higher b4 it falls."
So I own DKL (Delek Logistics Partners) and saw that DKL beat estimates and is down 16% today. DK (Delek Holdings) missed earnings big time with over $200million in impairment charges and is up 2-3%. Can someone tell me how these two companies are interconnected to where the one that performs terribly benefits and the one that performs very well is being punished by investors?
Two Investor presentations this week.Suggest reading the Presentation on their Website.
it's up 5.03 AH
Month away from another Distribution increase...
Quite a run ! Could be quiet until a probable Distribution i ncrease in July..
week ending 53 ??
Delek Logistics Partners is down 5.62% to 37.26
I to am looking for good things here. In my old age I have gravitated to dividend stocks in light of the on going low CD rates. however investors here have to have a strong constitution because of the low float there is never or seldom a dull moment.
That makes six consecutive quarters with negative revenue and negative earnings growth.
Sold 75% of ET. 33% of proceeds to DKL. 1/3 also to MPLX and to EPD. I think I’m gonna like it here. DKL shows potential.
Just a couple weeks away from another Distribution increase..More generous than the last???
Krotz springs drop will add $0.40 /sh to DCF and we will get some of that this year...imo
Delek Logistics Partners is down 5.72% to 22.25
Cushing high income index rebalancing will require buying as DKL is an addition..Determination as to ## of shares to buy will be made tomorrow after the close. Good to see some support. Bridge the couple of weeks until the Distribution increase...
Closer and Closer to another Distribution increase..
Delek Logistics Partners is up 7.07% to 27.10
Three weeks to another Distribution increase....
What is the relationship of DK and DKL? Why not just have one company?TIA
Looking forward to ER and CC August 8th.
Oct.27 we get another raise ? 30 quarters in a row.
Debt sale should place the Company in position to finance Dropdown of Krotz Springs assets without Equity..Krotz Springs Ebitda is about $30mm annually according to the CEO on the call. That should translate into about $0.50/unit of DCF..
Yesterday's Dropdown should be very beneficial to coverage..
"Two other Israeli born companies I own are very well managed. $BABYF, $DKL, look at the price gains but look at the earnings growth. I will add on any pull back here but I don’t see that happening anytime soon. Great company here with a great innovative award winning product. You won’t be disappointed owning this one."
Delek Logistics Partners is up 5.72% to 31.78
$0.02/quarter increase is an acceleration from recent quarter. 33 in a row...
All time high today..
Awesome article on SA
Delek Logistics Partners is down 5.53% to 39.99
Looks like parent company going to buy the remaining shares shortly .
"Serious question, can someone help me understand why this is trading with a 13% yield while they keep increasing the distribution? I would think the yield would be lower. What am I missing that is making people nervous? Obviously on PSXP, it is trading like poop because they stopped raising the distribution and potential issues with the DAPL, but what issues for this?"
DKL is down 5.28% to $27.01
Anyone see class action coming ???
Any clue as to the drop?
Raising the divvy again.....
Delek Logistics Partners reached a 52 Week high at 35.61
DKL reached a 52 Week low at 28.15
Solid Quarter..Mplx had favorable comments on W2W as part of their quarterly commentary..If the RINS issue is resolved (hopfully by end of 3q) could get a dropdown of the Krotz Springs assets..($ 30mm of EDITDA) imo
DKL reached an all time low at 14.77
"it seems someone anticipate dkl and cvi combine, and the hope fails..."
452000@31 insiders bought but down to single digit.
another divvy raise.... keep on

"Another beneficial Drop..DCF up,Coverage up, Debt/EBITDA down."
Solid quarter. Distribution increase each of next 2 quarters..Dropdown before yearend imo
Traded above 50..Anticipating the next Dist. Increase..imo
Anothor increase.yea
Delek Logistics Partners reached a 52 Week high at 38.02
Zacks rated strong sell. Downward earnings of 8%.
Strong quarter..Strong coverage. 5% DISTRIBUTION growth this year..Suggests some acceleration in subsequent quarter's
34 in a row..up 5% yr to yr
30 in a row next Tuesday.?
Delek Logistics Partners is up 6.06% to 37.12
New highs with some regularity..Attracting attention..
The roll ups of bpmp and psxp by their GP will result in their removal from indexes and sale by funds who track them..Dkl and others like them will get replacement buy interest..Every little bit helps..
DKL reached an all time low at 20.31
another divvy raise..... keep on
Betting on another $0.02/q raise next week..
We're the earnings that bad? Where is the bottom?
Krotz springs dropdown soon..Adds to Dcf..Details in the recently Released Investor Update
Cushing Index rebalancing day..today..Back to normal tomorrow..Dkl as announced last week was removed from one of the Funds Indexes..
Raise to $0.92 from $0.91.Raised 32 straight quarters...Like clockwork..In 90 days they will do it again..imo
@ their Investors presentation next week should telegraph the next Distribution increase in mid october..
DKL is fulfilling the prophecy as it climbs towards its destiny. Today 8t tacked on $1 65 which is phenomenal. But this is really about positioning as those in the know will recognize that power players are ready for parent DK to drop down some assets from the merger with ALJ back in the summer of 2017. The last piece if all this is DK finally abzorbing
Delek Logistics Partners is down 6.64% to 27.82

"I was attracted to this prospect from the sum of the DK/DKL relationship. Help me understand something. I was looking at the last 10-Q for DKL and noticed that the equity in this company is negative. Why has this partnership had amazing performance?Long Term Debt of 995,200 total assets of 973,737, so if we factor back in the accumulated depreciation and remove the current assets we are talking 167787 in equity, factor in the newly issued 14 million in shares minus the 45 million in debt for the IDR translation, we are talking about $2.827 of asset valuation on this LP. What the h3ll am I missing for why this partnership would snap back to $32 and have its valuation?"
"Guiding 5 % distribution growth in 2021.$0,18 per share. My guess is 4 increases of $0.01 per quarter from a Jan.2021 base of $3.60.Ramp of Wink to webster the catalyst.."
New 52 wk high..
Wonder if another pop if they raise in July ?
Entered buy order at !21.75..Dividend hike coming soon..
Dividend hike announcement this week...
"POLL: Guys, is the tanker sector now dead money? Press  for “Yes”     , press  for “No” . Thanks in advance for your participation, and feel free to give your reasoning for your vote. $tnk $nat $osg $wti $dkl $salt $stng    "
Delek Logistics Partners is up 6.65% to 27.73
$DKL is one of my favorite midsteams. I’ve owned many through the years.
Any idea where this will level off? Not that l’m complaining.
Risks for a future divi cut?
"sell-off could be coming soon, i might buy tomorrow"
"Wow, did not think I could get in at such a good price! Already up after I jumped in today!"

DID ANYONE ELSE HAVE PROBLEMS DOWNLOADING THE k-1 FROM partnersdatalink.com. I got a blank screen!
May see the 40's for the first time after the Distribution increase that appears likely later this month.
Looking at a strong year as Wink to Webster increases volumes throughout the year..TheseVolumes will allow quarterly Distribution increase each quarter at a 5% Annualized rate according to guidance..W to W will be dropped down to DKL at some point..which should accelerate Distribution growth opportunity..
Delek Logistics Partners is down 6.62% to 25.81
Fabulous earnings !
Impressive..
Ceo suggests W2W Dropdown in 2h of 2o22. That will be Huge..
Guidance of a $3.78 distribution 12 months from now...
Decided to add to position this morning - caught it at 10.45 near the open.
Delek Logistics Partners is up 18.16% to 10.41
Debt offering will fund dropdown of Krotz Springs assets..without need for equity. According to earnings call the assets generate $30mm/yr ebitda.....Should add $0.50/share to DCF
Moody's B1 rating a big comfort for DKL
Today is a gift with another Distribution increase next week
Something smells fishy here . 300% drop ??
Delek Logistics Partners is up 5.95% to 40.59
"90 DAYS from 31 in a row..And financial metrics continue to improve,,ER in a week or so should confirm."
Great 3q results..Continue to exceed !! Call in the am should be positive..
Nice bump.
Less than a month to the next distribution increase...
Is there any different tax implication being that this is an LP company?
DKL will see Green tomorrow with few $$$$ up.
Inland refiners should be on fire.Dkl volumes get a big lift from hurricane negatively impacting Gulf Coast refining
Important they reconfirmed guidance of 5% Distribution growth this year..Exit rate ~ $3.70..!!
DK has now officially declared there are drop-downs on the table slated for execution. This is especially gratifying in that I seemed to be the lone voice believing this was destined to become the new reality.
