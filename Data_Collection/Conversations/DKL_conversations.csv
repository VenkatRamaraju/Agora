Would not be a surprise to see some stock offered as we approach $50.....
Closer and closer to the 34th straight quarter of Dist.increases.
Great 3q results..Continue to exceed !! Call in the am should be positive..
Debt offering will fund dropdown of Krotz Springs assets..without need for equity. According to earnings call the assets generate $30mm/yr ebitda.....Should add $0.50/share to DCF
So I own DKL (Delek Logistics Partners) and saw that DKL beat estimates and is down 16% today. DK (Delek Holdings) missed earnings big time with over $200million in impairment charges and is up 2-3%. Can someone tell me how these two companies are interconnected to where the one that performs terribly benefits and the one that performs very well is being punished by investors?
May see the 40's for the first time after the Distribution increase that appears likely later this month.
@gene Do you know why the pull back in this stock yesterday in a up day market? There does not seem to be a lot of active conversation on this board. I am just trying to figure out what drive the structure of the share price.
Just a couple weeks away from another Distribution increase..More generous than the last???
My only regret about this stock is I didn’t load up back in March when it was around $6. My first entry was at $17 and have added along the way. I’m averaged in at $20 and it’s one of my favorite holdings. Company is very well managed.
Any clue as to the drop?
Last Quarter declared on the 27TH..So my guess Dist. goes up next week..
Anyone still here?
Betting on another $0.02/q raise next week..
Got my dividends but some how there was 37% tax deducted from them
"This is simple math. All that has to happen is DKL buys the mothership for a 1 for 2 stock swap. The total number of combined shares outstanding will be reduced. The amount of combined debt outstanding will be exactly the same. The free cash flow available for dividends will actually increase for the DK holders, who are the only ones that matter, since DK owns DKL. I think this would be a remarkable market wake up call!"
The roll ups of bpmp and psxp by their GP will result in their removal from indexes and sale by funds who track them..Dkl and others like them will get replacement buy interest..Every little bit helps..
We get a raise this week....imo
With the wink to webster pipeline delivery of some oil in October and the JV ramping up throughout 2021 past investments are set to begin to pay off in a significant way ...
Certainly one of the best performers of the Midstream group in 2020.I guess if you raise your payout every quarter you attract support. Should get another Distribution increase toward the end of January..
Distribution raised for 31st straight quarter..Small raise but in line with their prior guidance of 5% annual growth..
$0.02/quarter increase is an acceleration from recent quarter. 33 in a row...
All time high today..
34 in a row..up 5% yr to yr
With Brent approaching $60 wink to webster pipeline space if any is not contacted should be a Premium..
Looking at a strong year as Wink to Webster increases volumes throughout the year..TheseVolumes will allow quarterly Distribution increase each quarter at a 5% Annualized rate according to guidance..W to W will be dropped down to DKL at some point..which should accelerate Distribution growth opportunity..
it's up 5.03 AH
Small insider sales will likely preclude the company from issuing Equity anytime soon.
@ their Investors presentation next week should telegraph the next Distribution increase in mid october..
Another dividend increase to $.77 this quarter; XDIV 8/02 I think.
Inland refiners should be on fire.Dkl volumes get a big lift from hurricane negatively impacting Gulf Coast refining
May see the value of MVC Contract in light of Texas producers taking production and earnings Hits from the big freeze. Especially with the ramp up of W2W.
Looks like parent company going to buy the remaining shares shortly .
"I was attracted to this prospect from the sum of the DK/DKL relationship. Help me understand something. I was looking at the last 10-Q for DKL and noticed that the equity in this company is negative. Why has this partnership had amazing performance?Long Term Debt of 995,200 total assets of 973,737, so if we factor back in the accumulated depreciation and remove the current assets we are talking 167787 in equity, factor in the newly issued 14 million in shares minus the 45 million in debt for the IDR translation, we are talking about $2.827 of asset valuation on this LP. What the h3ll am I missing for why this partnership would snap back to $32 and have its valuation?"
Sold 75% of ET. 33% of proceeds to DKL. 1/3 also to MPLX and to EPD. I think I’m gonna like it here. DKL shows potential.
ER tomorrow.
Traded above 50..Anticipating the next Dist. Increase..imo
"This is not even that weird. What mother-ship owns the little partnership called, EPD. No one! It is a stand alone venture, that is the biggest in the entire oil industry. Now, would they be better off to simply declare them selves a C-Corp, probably not now with corporate rates getting ready to melt up after the election. It is a match made in election hell, but we have to survive this."
Wink to webster 15% share is potentially 50mm annual barrels of transported product net to DKL interest..Big number..choose your own per barrel cash flow assumption.
Fabulous earnings !
"Two other Israeli born companies I own are very well managed. $BABYF, $DKL, look at the price gains but look at the earnings growth. I will add on any pull back here but I don’t see that happening anytime soon. Great company here with a great innovative award winning product. You won’t be disappointed owning this one."
