Delek Logistics Partners is up 7.07% to 27.10
DKL reached an all time low at 20.31
Why so weak the past week? Not seeing any news or analyst calls?
DKL is down 27.04% to 8.04
Why the meteoric rise before the ex-dividend date?
DKL is down 12.40% to 11.02
Is there any different tax implication being that this is an LP company?
"With the G.P.now in the mid-$20s i'm less concerned with a ""roll up""@ a heavily discounted price."
Raise to $0.92 from $0.91.Raised 32 straight quarters...Like clockwork..In 90 days they will do it again..imo

Ceo suggests W2W Dropdown in 2h of 2o22. That will be Huge..
DKL reached a 52 Week low at 22.28
Closer and Closer to another Distribution increase..
"The actual EPS for 4Q of 2020 was $0.94, missing the aggressive target of $1.13 by $0.19. Now, adding all the actual EPS of 2020 totaling $4.14, misses the target of $4.18 by only $0.04 does not warrant the more than 7% share downturn. IMHO this is manipulation, considering the demand and price of natural gas and gasoline continue to rise making DKL future growth more likely.Look for the future EPS trend for 2021 of $4.96 and 2022 @ $5.24,...very ""aggressive"". A conservative estimates of $4.70 and 5.05 would still look progressively good and easier to beat, thereby the share would go up instead of down. IMHO only. Good luck everyone!."
Less than a month away from another Distribution incresse..35 Quarters in a row..
Moody's B1 rating a big comfort for DKL
30 in a row next Tuesday.?
"DKL will surge higher at some point during quarter#1 of 2018. Expect it to occur upon closing of parent & General Partner Delek's absorbing Alon USA assets held at the moment in ALDW. Following the ""big swallow,"" DK will be dropping down assets formerly held by ALDW into DKL thus fattening the calf as it were."
DKL reached an all time low at 15.76

Sold 75% of ET. 33% of proceeds to DKL. 1/3 also to MPLX and to EPD. I think I’m gonna like it here. DKL shows potential.
What is the relationship of DK and DKL? Why not just have one company?TIA
Cushing high income index rebalancing will require buying as DKL is an addition..Determination as to ## of shares to buy will be made tomorrow after the close. Good to see some support. Bridge the couple of weeks until the Distribution increase...
"DKL, I'm convinced, is soon going to run upwards. Parent Delek (DK) has made it clear very recently that it is preparing to drop down assets formerly partsbof ALDW's operation. Now"
DKL is down 9.33% to 13.60
DKL is down 11.93% to 6.20
Solid Quarter..Mplx had favorable comments on W2W as part of their quarterly commentary..If the RINS issue is resolved (hopfully by end of 3q) could get a dropdown of the Krotz Springs assets..($ 30mm of EDITDA) imo
Zacks rated strong sell. Downward earnings of 8%.
DKL will see Green tomorrow with few $$$$ up.
DKL is down 5.14% to 31.53
"90 DAYS from 31 in a row..And financial metrics continue to improve,,ER in a week or so should confirm."
Just a couple weeks away from another Distribution increase..More generous than the last???
@gene Do you know why the pull back in this stock yesterday in a up day market? There does not seem to be a lot of active conversation on this board. I am just trying to figure out what drive the structure of the share price.
Very upbeat call.Surprised they discussed the 2020 possibility of added Dropdowns ..indicated additive to DCF and more important would reduce Debt Metrics to below the current level which isn't high enough to be a potential problem....Recommend reading the Call Transcript or listening to replay.
"Serious question, can someone help me understand why this is trading with a 13% yield while they keep increasing the distribution? I would think the yield would be lower. What am I missing that is making people nervous? Obviously on PSXP, it is trading like poop because they stopped raising the distribution and potential issues with the DAPL, but what issues for this?"
Risks for a future divi cut?
Decided to add to position this morning - caught it at 10.45 near the open.
Raising the divvy again.....
Back over 40. Buying ahead of the distribution increase
DKL is up 14.74% to 9.53
another divvy raise. Like clockwork.
DKL is up 6.19% to 22.82
$0.02/quarter increase is an acceleration from recent quarter. 33 in a row...

"In spite of positive mention on SA; I'm expecting and end to payout growth. Entering maintenance period, and debt is too high making interest payments going higher as rates increase. They really need to get their debt under 4×EBITDA or better. Many dividend payers having same problem. This is an early warning; not gonna happen right away; it may even go higher b4 it falls."
"This is not even that weird. What mother-ship owns the little partnership called, EPD. No one! It is a stand alone venture, that is the biggest in the entire oil industry. Now, would they be better off to simply declare them selves a C-Corp, probably not now with corporate rates getting ready to melt up after the election. It is a match made in election hell, but we have to survive this."
Why up 11% after hours??
Krotz springs dropdown soon..Adds to Dcf..Details in the recently Released Investor Update
"I'M not a Zacks fan,but they had good things to say about DKL."
Great 3q results..Continue to exceed !! Call in the am should be positive..
My only regret about this stock is I didn’t load up back in March when it was around $6. My first entry was at $17 and have added along the way. I’m averaged in at $20 and it’s one of my favorite holdings. Company is very well managed.
Would not be a surprise to see some stock offered as we approach $50.....
IDR going away a good thing.Upcoming Krotz Springs Drop a good thing. Both events add to DCF..Going forward however the financing option of trading stock to DK for assets will become increasingly limited.
"Two other Israeli born companies I own are very well managed. $BABYF, $DKL, look at the price gains but look at the earnings growth. I will add on any pull back here but I don’t see that happening anytime soon. Great company here with a great innovative award winning product. You won’t be disappointed owning this one."
Delek Logistics Partners is down 5.68% to 36.19
Wink to webster 15% share is potentially 50mm annual barrels of transported product net to DKL interest..Big number..choose your own per barrel cash flow assumption.
Should report earnings and raise the Distribution next week..
Debt offering will fund dropdown of Krotz Springs assets..without need for equity. According to earnings call the assets generate $30mm/yr ebitda.....Should add $0.50/share to DCF
Debt sale should place the Company in position to finance Dropdown of Krotz Springs assets without Equity..Krotz Springs Ebitda is about $30mm annually according to the CEO on the call. That should translate into about $0.50/unit of DCF..

"Guiding 5 % distribution growth in 2021.$0,18 per share. My guess is 4 increases of $0.01 per quarter from a Jan.2021 base of $3.60.Ramp of Wink to webster the catalyst.."
Glad I got into this one in the teens. I missed the March bottom.
"sell-off could be coming soon, i might buy tomorrow"
"I was attracted to this prospect from the sum of the DK/DKL relationship. Help me understand something. I was looking at the last 10-Q for DKL and noticed that the equity in this company is negative. Why has this partnership had amazing performance?Long Term Debt of 995,200 total assets of 973,737, so if we factor back in the accumulated depreciation and remove the current assets we are talking 167787 in equity, factor in the newly issued 14 million in shares minus the 45 million in debt for the IDR translation, we are talking about $2.827 of asset valuation on this LP. What the h3ll am I missing for why this partnership would snap back to $32 and have its valuation?"
Yesterday's Dropdown should be very beneficial to coverage..
Last day to buy and get the Distribution..X Monday
Beat the heck out of earnings and still going down. Something bad in the Conference Call ?????
Delek Logistics Partners is up 5.95% to 40.59

May see the value of MVC Contract in light of Texas producers taking production and earnings Hits from the big freeze. Especially with the ramp up of W2W.
Looks like parent company going to buy the remaining shares shortly .
Delek Logistics Partners reached a 52 Week high at 33.80
Distribution raised for 31st straight quarter..Small raise but in line with their prior guidance of 5% annual growth..
another divvy raise..... keep on
I to am looking for good things here. In my old age I have gravitated to dividend stocks in light of the on going low CD rates. however investors here have to have a strong constitution because of the low float there is never or seldom a dull moment.
DKL reached an all time low at 14.77
Insiders are selling this stock .https://www.smarteranalyst.com/new-blurbs/the-evp-cfo-of-delek-logistics-dkl-is-selling-shares/

Today is a gift with another Distribution increase next week
DKL is down 5.79% to 22.79
Have 4000 shares and looking forward to my Divs
So I own DKL (Delek Logistics Partners) and saw that DKL beat estimates and is down 16% today. DK (Delek Holdings) missed earnings big time with over $200million in impairment charges and is up 2-3%. Can someone tell me how these two companies are interconnected to where the one that performs terribly benefits and the one that performs very well is being punished by investors?
Nice bump.
just started following. I like the dividend potentials here.
Insiders bought .
Delek Logistics Partners is down 5.62% to 37.26
This is quite ridiculous.
With Brent approaching $60 wink to webster pipeline space if any is not contacted should be a Premium..
In about a month we should get another raise..31 consecutive quarters of increases...certainly not the norm!
DKL reached an all time low at 9.21
DID ANYONE ELSE HAVE PROBLEMS DOWNLOADING THE k-1 FROM partnersdatalink.com. I got a blank screen!
Any clue as to the drop?
Important they reconfirmed guidance of 5% Distribution growth this year..Exit rate ~ $3.70..!!
Why is this stock price so low given the very high yield and historic record of dividend increases? Any insights?
DKL reached an all time low at 11.59
That makes six consecutive quarters with negative revenue and negative earnings growth.
what a short squeeze!
DKL is up 13.21% to 7.80
"This is simple math. All that has to happen is DKL buys the mothership for a 1 for 2 stock swap. The total number of combined shares outstanding will be reduced. The amount of combined debt outstanding will be exactly the same. The free cash flow available for dividends will actually increase for the DK holders, who are the only ones that matter, since DK owns DKL. I think this would be a remarkable market wake up call!"
See 8k filing..good summary
DKL has already beaten Yahoo Finance targetby $2.60.
Cushing Index rebalancing day..today..Back to normal tomorrow..Dkl as announced last week was removed from one of the Funds Indexes..
"Another beneficial Drop..DCF up,Coverage up, Debt/EBITDA down."

Oct.27 we get another raise ? 30 quarters in a row.
Delek Logistics Partners is up 6.06% to 33.80
$DKL is one of my favorite midsteams. I’ve owned many through the years.
Should break $50 with the next Dist. Increase in 2 weeks..if not before.
DKL reached a 52 Week low at 28.28
week ending 53 ??
DK has now officially declared there are drop-downs on the table slated for execution. This is especially gratifying in that I seemed to be the lone voice believing this was destined to become the new reality.
Got my dividends but some how there was 37% tax deducted from them

Certainly one of the best performers of the Midstream group in 2020.I guess if you raise your payout every quarter you attract support. Should get another Distribution increase toward the end of January..
We're the earnings that bad? Where is the bottom?
Small insider sales will likely preclude the company from issuing Equity anytime soon.
Looking forward to ER and CC August 8th.
Delek Logistics Partners is down 7.11% to 37.85
Something smells fishy here . 300% drop ??
Wonder if another pop if they raise in July ?

DKL is up 13.01% to 8.25
Looking at a strong year as Wink to Webster increases volumes throughout the year..TheseVolumes will allow quarterly Distribution increase each quarter at a 5% Annualized rate according to guidance..W to W will be dropped down to DKL at some point..which should accelerate Distribution growth opportunity..
New highs with some regularity..Attracting attention..
DKL is up 14.44% to 9.15

Entered buy order at !21.75..Dividend hike coming soon..
DKL is down 5.28% to $27.01
DKL is fulfilling the prophecy as it climbs towards its destiny. Today 8t tacked on $1 65 which is phenomenal. But this is really about positioning as those in the know will recognize that power players are ready for parent DK to drop down some assets from the merger with ALJ back in the summer of 2017. The last piece if all this is DK finally abzorbing
Last Quarter declared on the 27TH..So my guess Dist. goes up next week..
Closer and closer to the 34th straight quarter of Dist.increases.
Delek Logistics Partners is down 6.86% to 33.19
