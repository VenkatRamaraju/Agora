Traded above 50..Anticipating the next Dist. Increase..imo
@gene Do you know why the pull back in this stock yesterday in a up day market? There does not seem to be a lot of active conversation on this board. I am just trying to figure out what drive the structure of the share price.
All time high today..
Closer and closer to the 34th straight quarter of Dist.increases.
"I was attracted to this prospect from the sum of the DK/DKL relationship. Help me understand something. I was looking at the last 10-Q for DKL and noticed that the equity in this company is negative. Why has this partnership had amazing performance?Long Term Debt of 995,200 total assets of 973,737, so if we factor back in the accumulated depreciation and remove the current assets we are talking 167787 in equity, factor in the newly issued 14 million in shares minus the 45 million in debt for the IDR translation, we are talking about $2.827 of asset valuation on this LP. What the h3ll am I missing for why this partnership would snap back to $32 and have its valuation?"
Looks like parent company going to buy the remaining shares shortly .
So I own DKL (Delek Logistics Partners) and saw that DKL beat estimates and is down 16% today. DK (Delek Holdings) missed earnings big time with over $200million in impairment charges and is up 2-3%. Can someone tell me how these two companies are interconnected to where the one that performs terribly benefits and the one that performs very well is being punished by investors?
May see the 40's for the first time after the Distribution increase that appears likely later this month.
The roll ups of bpmp and psxp by their GP will result in their removal from indexes and sale by funds who track them..Dkl and others like them will get replacement buy interest..Every little bit helps..
Got my dividends but some how there was 37% tax deducted from them
"Two other Israeli born companies I own are very well managed. $BABYF, $DKL, look at the price gains but look at the earnings growth. I will add on any pull back here but I don’t see that happening anytime soon. Great company here with a great innovative award winning product. You won’t be disappointed owning this one."
Small insider sales will likely preclude the company from issuing Equity anytime soon.
Just a couple weeks away from another Distribution increase..More generous than the last???
Betting on another $0.02/q raise next week..
Certainly one of the best performers of the Midstream group in 2020.I guess if you raise your payout every quarter you attract support. Should get another Distribution increase toward the end of January..
Inland refiners should be on fire.Dkl volumes get a big lift from hurricane negatively impacting Gulf Coast refining
@ their Investors presentation next week should telegraph the next Distribution increase in mid october..
Sold 75% of ET. 33% of proceeds to DKL. 1/3 also to MPLX and to EPD. I think I’m gonna like it here. DKL shows potential.
34 in a row..up 5% yr to yr
We get a raise this week....imo
