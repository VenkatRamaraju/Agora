"This is bloody awful. Where is Uzi, Israel? They need to bring back Alan Moret"
@gene Do you know why the pull back in this stock yesterday in a up day market? There does not seem to be a lot of active conversation on this board. I am just trying to figure out what drive the structure of the share price.
Delek Logistics Partners is down 5.68% to 36.19
Something smells fishy here . 300% drop ??
Trvn has fda approval this week. Expect gap up
DK has now officially declared there are drop-downs on the table slated for execution. This is especially gratifying in that I seemed to be the lone voice believing this was destined to become the new reality.
Anothor increase.yea
"Wow, did not think I could get in at such a good price! Already up after I jumped in today!"
Anyone see class action coming ???
"sell-off could be coming soon, i might buy tomorrow"
"Serious question, can someone help me understand why this is trading with a 13% yield while they keep increasing the distribution? I would think the yield would be lower. What am I missing that is making people nervous? Obviously on PSXP, it is trading like poop because they stopped raising the distribution and potential issues with the DAPL, but what issues for this?"
Awesome article on SA
DKL is down 17.64% to 15.76
452000@31 insiders bought but down to single digit.
Is there any different tax implication being that this is an LP company?
ER tomorrow.
Delek Logistics Partners is down 6.64% to 27.82
Why up 11% after hours??
Raising the divvy again.....
Delek Logistics Partners is up 6.06% to 37.12
Traded above 50..Anticipating the next Dist. Increase..imo
Wonder if another pop if they raise in July ?
Two Investor presentations this week.Suggest reading the Presentation on their Website.
Delek Logistics Partners is down 5.53% to 39.99
My only regret about this stock is I didn’t load up back in March when it was around $6. My first entry was at $17 and have added along the way. I’m averaged in at $20 and it’s one of my favorite holdings. Company is very well managed.
DKL reached an all time low at 14.77
DKL is down 6.10% to 38.00
Double digit yield and another distribution increase in April highly likely...and july...and October..
Should break $50 with the next Dist. Increase in 2 weeks..if not before.
DKL is down 15.69% to 6.88
Delek Logistics Partners is up 18.16% to 10.41
$DKL is one of my favorite midsteams. I’ve owned many through the years.
Delek Logistics Partners reached a 52 Week high at 35.61
Insiders bought .
Why the meteoric rise before the ex-dividend date?
"Received an alert this am about $DKL from http://earthsciencetech.com/?symbol=DKL, you may want to take a look. ""hhse"" Making money investing."
Got lucky. Bought bought in 2 days a go. Nice close
DKL is down 5.72% to 22.25
Delek Logistics Partners is down 6.04% to 28.45
Krotz springs drop will add $0.40 /sh to DCF and we will get some of that this year...imo
Delek Logistics Partners is up 5.72% to 31.78
"This is simple math. All that has to happen is DKL buys the mothership for a 1 for 2 stock swap. The total number of combined shares outstanding will be reduced. The amount of combined debt outstanding will be exactly the same. The free cash flow available for dividends will actually increase for the DK holders, who are the only ones that matter, since DK owns DKL. I think this would be a remarkable market wake up call!"
Dividend hike announcement this week...
Should report earnings and raise the Distribution next week..
Sold 75% of ET. 33% of proceeds to DKL. 1/3 also to MPLX and to EPD. I think I’m gonna like it here. DKL shows potential.
Cushing high income index rebalancing will require buying as DKL is an addition..Determination as to ## of shares to buy will be made tomorrow after the close. Good to see some support. Bridge the couple of weeks until the Distribution increase...
Important they reconfirmed guidance of 5% Distribution growth this year..Exit rate ~ $3.70..!!
Delek Logistics Partners is down 7.11% to 37.85
$0.02/quarter increase is an acceleration from recent quarter. 33 in a row...
May see the 40's for the first time after the Distribution increase that appears likely later this month.
So I own DKL (Delek Logistics Partners) and saw that DKL beat estimates and is down 16% today. DK (Delek Holdings) missed earnings big time with over $200million in impairment charges and is up 2-3%. Can someone tell me how these two companies are interconnected to where the one that performs terribly benefits and the one that performs very well is being punished by investors?
Just a couple weeks away from another Distribution increase..More generous than the last???
Oct.27 we get another raise ? 30 quarters in a row.
Nice bump.
DKL is up 12.43% to 8.32
We're the earnings that bad? Where is the bottom?
"Another beneficial Drop..DCF up,Coverage up, Debt/EBITDA down."
DKL reached a 52 Week low at 28.28
"In spite of positive mention on SA; I'm expecting and end to payout growth. Entering maintenance period, and debt is too high making interest payments going higher as rates increase. They really need to get their debt under 4×EBITDA or better. Many dividend payers having same problem. This is an early warning; not gonna happen right away; it may even go higher b4 it falls."
New highs with some regularity..Attracting attention..
Month away from another Distribution increase...
Today is a gift with another Distribution increase next week
"DKL, I'm convinced, is soon going to run upwards. Parent Delek (DK) has made it clear very recently that it is preparing to drop down assets formerly partsbof ALDW's operation. Now"
Would not be a surprise to see some stock offered as we approach $50.....
Here comes the “ICHAN EXPRESS”...watch out where you walk on the tracks...CHOO-CHOO!!!
DKL NEXT DIVY ????? $$$$ ????
Zacks rated strong sell. Downward earnings of 8%.
what a short squeeze!
Cushing Index rebalancing day..today..Back to normal tomorrow..Dkl as announced last week was removed from one of the Funds Indexes..
Why isn't it trading today? ..I know it is thinly traded..but??
Decided to add to position this morning - caught it at 10.45 near the open.
Debt offering will fund dropdown of Krotz Springs assets..without need for equity. According to earnings call the assets generate $30mm/yr ebitda.....Should add $0.50/share to DCF
Strong quarter..Strong coverage. 5% DISTRIBUTION growth this year..Suggests some acceleration in subsequent quarter's
Risks for a future divi cut?
That makes six consecutive quarters with negative revenue and negative earnings growth.
Delek Logistics Partners is up 6.12% to 46.49
DKL is down 27.04% to 8.04
DKL is down 5.31% to 20.16
DKL is up 11.45% to 6.25
another divvy raise.... keep on
DKL is fulfilling the prophecy as it climbs towards its destiny. Today 8t tacked on $1 65 which is phenomenal. But this is really about positioning as those in the know will recognize that power players are ready for parent DK to drop down some assets from the merger with ALJ back in the summer of 2017. The last piece if all this is DK finally abzorbing
this is ridiculous. 40% drop ????????????
"The actual EPS for 4Q of 2020 was $0.94, missing the aggressive target of $1.13 by $0.19. Now, adding all the actual EPS of 2020 totaling $4.14, misses the target of $4.18 by only $0.04 does not warrant the more than 7% share downturn. IMHO this is manipulation, considering the demand and price of natural gas and gasoline continue to rise making DKL future growth more likely.Look for the future EPS trend for 2021 of $4.96 and 2022 @ $5.24,...very ""aggressive"". A conservative estimates of $4.70 and 5.05 would still look progressively good and easier to beat, thereby the share would go up instead of down. IMHO only. Good luck everyone!."
With Brent approaching $60 wink to webster pipeline space if any is not contacted should be a Premium..
I to am looking for good things here. In my old age I have gravitated to dividend stocks in light of the on going low CD rates. however investors here have to have a strong constitution because of the low float there is never or seldom a dull moment.
Quite a run ! Could be quiet until a probable Distribution i ncrease in July..
DKL is down 5.19% to 25.41
Who traded 500000 after the close..??
Moody's B1 rating a big comfort for DKL
Closer and Closer to another Distribution increase..

DKL is up 13.01% to 8.25
Wink to webster 15% share is potentially 50mm annual barrels of transported product net to DKL interest..Big number..choose your own per barrel cash flow assumption.

Any responce from DKL ??
it's up 5.03 AH
See 8k filing..good summary
more dropdowns.... just a cash printing machine...
DKL is up 8.95% to 7.91
Yesterday's Dropdown should be very beneficial to coverage..
In about a month we should get another raise..31 consecutive quarters of increases...certainly not the norm!
DKL reached an all time low at 15.76
DKL reached an all time low at 20.31
Distribution raised for 31st straight quarter..Small raise but in line with their prior guidance of 5% annual growth..

Krotz springs dropdown soon..Adds to Dcf..Details in the recently Released Investor Update
Any idea where this will level off? Not that l’m complaining.
Looks like parent company going to buy the remaining shares shortly .
Small insider sales will likely preclude the company from issuing Equity anytime soon.

Last Quarter declared on the 27TH..So my guess Dist. goes up next week..
Inland refiners should be on fire.Dkl volumes get a big lift from hurricane negatively impacting Gulf Coast refining
Looking at a strong year as Wink to Webster increases volumes throughout the year..TheseVolumes will allow quarterly Distribution increase each quarter at a 5% Annualized rate according to guidance..W to W will be dropped down to DKL at some point..which should accelerate Distribution growth opportunity..
Beat the heck out of earnings and still going down. Something bad in the Conference Call ?????
Ceo suggests W2W Dropdown in 2h of 2o22. That will be Huge..

"90 DAYS from 31 in a row..And financial metrics continue to improve,,ER in a week or so should confirm."
Anyone still here?

"DKL will surge higher at some point during quarter#1 of 2018. Expect it to occur upon closing of parent & General Partner Delek's absorbing Alon USA assets held at the moment in ALDW. Following the ""big swallow,"" DK will be dropping down assets formerly held by ALDW into DKL thus fattening the calf as it were."
New 52 wk high..
Why is this stock price so low given the very high yield and historic record of dividend increases? Any insights?
Closer and closer to the 34th straight quarter of Dist.increases.
Certainly one of the best performers of the Midstream group in 2020.I guess if you raise your payout every quarter you attract support. Should get another Distribution increase toward the end of January..
DKL is down 12.40% to 11.02
Dist.release suggested another Dropdown.Should hear more when they report earnings.
All time high today..
This is quite ridiculous.
"I'M not a Zacks fan,but they had good things to say about DKL."
DKL is down 16.46% to 8.02
With the wink to webster pipeline delivery of some oil in October and the JV ramping up throughout 2021 past investments are set to begin to pay off in a significant way ...
IDR going away a good thing.Upcoming Krotz Springs Drop a good thing. Both events add to DCF..Going forward however the financing option of trading stock to DK for assets will become increasingly limited.
DKL is down 17.52% to 7.11
DKL is down 5.28% to $27.01
Solid quarter. Distribution increase each of next 2 quarters..Dropdown before yearend imo
Insiders are selling this stock .https://www.smarteranalyst.com/new-blurbs/the-evp-cfo-of-delek-logistics-dkl-is-selling-shares/

"All gave some, some gave all. Trump had fake bone Spurs and calls the others suckers and losers"
Glad I got into this one in the teens. I missed the March bottom.
Wouldn't be surprised to hear about it dropdown on Wednesday...they can handle Krotz Springs without equity..
DKL is down 7.40% to 39.97
Any clue as to the drop?
DKL reached a 52 Week low at 22.28
DKL reached an all time low at 11.59
Delek Logistics Partners is down 5.33% to 37.63
Debt sale should place the Company in position to finance Dropdown of Krotz Springs assets without Equity..Krotz Springs Ebitda is about $30mm annually according to the CEO on the call. That should translate into about $0.50/unit of DCF..
Fabulous earnings !
"Guiding 5 % distribution growth in 2021.$0,18 per share. My guess is 4 increases of $0.01 per quarter from a Jan.2021 base of $3.60.Ramp of Wink to webster the catalyst.."
DID ANYONE ELSE HAVE PROBLEMS DOWNLOADING THE k-1 FROM partnersdatalink.com. I got a blank screen!

Delek Logistics Partners reached a 52 Week high at 40.19
Delek Logistics Partners is up 6.65% to 27.73
Very upbeat call.Surprised they discussed the 2020 possibility of added Dropdowns ..indicated additive to DCF and more important would reduce Debt Metrics to below the current level which isn't high enough to be a potential problem....Recommend reading the Call Transcript or listening to replay.
another divvy raise..... keep on
Another dividend increase to $.77 this quarter; XDIV 8/02 I think.
another divvy raise........like clockwork...
"With the G.P.now in the mid-$20s i'm less concerned with a ""roll up""@ a heavily discounted price."

Impressive..
"I made a small profit, in spite of poor market performance. But decided to bail yesterday. My concern is the crazy man in the WH. He's getting crazier by the day. May as well wait for a pullback which is bound to happen eventually. Market is crazy too; they wouldn't buy yesterday and get the dividend; but they paid almost as much today to get none? Go figure. Beer's good; God's great; people are beyond stupid."
Solid Quarter..Mplx had favorable comments on W2W as part of their quarterly commentary..If the RINS issue is resolved (hopfully by end of 3q) could get a dropdown of the Krotz Springs assets..($ 30mm of EDITDA) imo
Delek Logistics Partners is up 7.07% to 27.10
"I was attracted to this prospect from the sum of the DK/DKL relationship. Help me understand something. I was looking at the last 10-Q for DKL and noticed that the equity in this company is negative. Why has this partnership had amazing performance?Long Term Debt of 995,200 total assets of 973,737, so if we factor back in the accumulated depreciation and remove the current assets we are talking 167787 in equity, factor in the newly issued 14 million in shares minus the 45 million in debt for the IDR translation, we are talking about $2.827 of asset valuation on this LP. What the h3ll am I missing for why this partnership would snap back to $32 and have its valuation?"
Entered buy order at !21.75..Dividend hike coming soon..
"This is not even that weird. What mother-ship owns the little partnership called, EPD. No one! It is a stand alone venture, that is the biggest in the entire oil industry. Now, would they be better off to simply declare them selves a C-Corp, probably not now with corporate rates getting ready to melt up after the election. It is a match made in election hell, but we have to survive this."
Delek Logistics Partners reached a 52 Week high at 38.02
anyone know when ex-divvy might be?thank you
"it seems someone anticipate dkl and cvi combine, and the hope fails..."
"Two other Israeli born companies I own are very well managed. $BABYF, $DKL, look at the price gains but look at the earnings growth. I will add on any pull back here but I don’t see that happening anytime soon. Great company here with a great innovative award winning product. You won’t be disappointed owning this one."
