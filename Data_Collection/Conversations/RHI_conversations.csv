Is STAF a good acquisition for RHI? Adding Engineering and Manpower type of contractors.
"Like I said, RHI has peaked, the analysts missed the most pressing question - what are they doing to control their internal high turnover ? They can't back fill the seats with experienced recruiters quick enough to fill the void for the ones they are losing. The stock is a sell, no longer in growth mode, they are in maintain ""at best "" mode."

"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"
