Institutional investors aided by MM trying to get in at an even lower price before it moves based on yesterday’s earning and guidance. Come on guys give it up
Oui!
"Earnings are expected to grow 20% in fiscal 2018 ending in September. In fiscal 2019, earnings growth of 27% is in the forecast. YET... it sheds more then 6.0% already (again) today. Where are “50 p/s range” w/ this stock? Heck, I thought we’d be @ 62 p/s this Fall. We are at 5 year ago levels. Sinful."
Poor storm season in the southwest and midwest...hail damage minimal...sales will take a hit.thats how it goes
Beacon Roofing Supply is down 5.15% to 40.04
Storm will drive profits. Better load up !!
Encore Wire (WIRE) nearly quadrupled in the year following Katrina.
B.S. rally as usual after earnings report. It will go back to where it all started or even lower. Short covering here and there but down trend intact.

"Folks, this baby is a Screaming Short for Earnings. Poorly managed, weak sector, the hurricane season was exceptionally weak, construction down, winter season is here, etc... I expect Earnings and Revenue misses, and poor Guidance going forward, from Monday's after market close earnings report. The result should be a significant drop in share price, into the upper 20's. Planning to Sell Short 500 shares on Monday."

"A merger is out the questions. New management will not help this company. the last few acquisitions beacon overpaid for it. diluting the stock under the assumption of taking over the roofing market. that never happened, Beacon is the cheapest distributor, high revenues, no profits. This trend will not changed anytime soon. This stock will see mid to high teen $$ before moving north, when will this happen? by the end of the year. Remember this post"

"Today’s article from Simply Wall Street indicates that BECN is undervalued. BECN’s intrinsic value is $68 and change. This value proposition is also supported by CD&R Investment Associates IX LTD who purchased 5,609,763 BECN shares at $33.32 per share on March 14, 2019 worth $215, 975,876 today. BECN is still a bargain today at $38.50. BECN chart is also in uptrend. Remember that the trend is your friend! Grab some shares before it goes way up when the company reports on May 7, 2019."
BECN is down 13.39% to 23.61
Same price as MARCH 2006... 13 years ago!
Beacon will report at least $5.00 per share of free cash this year. Has reduced its leverage by 3 turns this year to under 3.0x with more to come. Has reduced debt by $1.3 billion over past year. April refi will result in even lower interest expense. Company benefits from inflation. Industry is sold out.
You will see massive damage along the coast of N.FL GA and SCSelling overdone. Big Q4 for BECN

Violations of loan covenants?.
"BECN is currently priced at near book value. While some argue that this is effectively a ""fair value"" floor, in terms of asset liquidation value, the reality is that there remains $2.5B of goodwill on the books and another $1.1B of customer intangibles related to the over-priced acquisitions they have completed over the last decade, which have amounted to ZERO incremental earnings. Given the Company's performance over the past few years (especially FY2019), it is ASTOUNDING to me how BECN has avoided booking impairment charges on these assets related to required write downs. If they were forced to perform step 2 of a asset impairment test, these assets could get halved or written-off completely. Assuming a 50% write down and the same 1.1 P/BV ratio, this stock could move to the low $20's. If a full write-down were required, the stock could easily retreat to sub $20."
Beacon Roofing Supply is down 13.39% to 23.61
A break of 47.84 could move it up to 55.88. Technical strong buy at stoxline.
looks like its ready for a breakout this showing low 50s short term.
"Seriously, this stock is incredibly undervalued. Should be in high 50s if not higher. So what is the problem with this? Anyone?"
buy out? BCN has been doing buyouts bigtime last few years ....that's how they have grown vis many buyouts. So for all those speculating a buyout .... who's buying BCN since from what I have seen BCN doing the buyouts.

I think it's going much higher. Lots of business was delayed because of all the rain this summer. Lots of make up jobs are happening now. Next quarter will be exceptional.

"BECN is holding at the ever important psychological support of $30 but if it breaks down, it could drop to mid $26. If it clears that, you are off to the races to the low $20's (which IMHO is where it belongs at this point). $4B+ in deals in the last 6 years and EPS is lower now (FY2018 and FY2019) than it was in 2013. Horribly managed and CDR has taken note. If this does breakdown to the mid $20's, expect to see CDR pick up the required shares for 51% ownership."
No upward gain... only the same day after day week after week
I am a roofer and posted here and yahoo deleted. That’s bs . Anyway I could tell you this is going to 60
