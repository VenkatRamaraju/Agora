"ConocoPhillips is raising its quarterly dividend 7%, from 43 cents a share to 46 cents a share. Not complaining, it could be cut."
"As a long term buy/hold/ and drip investor, I'm enjoying the COP recovery. I've been in since 2010, finally getting some payback. The prospects look a lot brighter than they have for quite a while..."
listening to business news a tv analyst said figuring in inflation and the fact oil was over 100 back in 2008 oil could run to 230 a barrel in todays world without disrupting the economy or running into price destruction if big oil can keep from over producing stock could run for a long time by the time we get to all electric cars on the road they will have flying cars and daily flights into space using what we saved on all electric cars and there is always bitcoin mining that requires lots of energy
How high can this go? Will there be a pull back?
"oil is the #1 performing sector in the stock market this year and its going higher. There's not enough supply and demand is increasing - simple as that. Im invested in #FANG (+23%), #PXD ( +18%), AND #COP (+15%) in the past TWO WEEKS. These are three of the best oil plays and they're going to go a lot higher bc oil company's are not drilling for more oil; keeping the supply down. They are taking the massive profits and buying back billions of dollars of stock; further causing their share prices to skyrocket. By the way - inflation is good for oil stocks. Cheers!"

So some of the same jokers politicians want to ban oil while at the same time are heavily invested in battery operated investments . How is that not a conflict of interest. It won't hold water More gas lighting bS
Gulf oil output down as the Hurricane passes. how many rigs does COP have in the Gulf of Mexico?

Thanks COP! Your management have done well for us investors. I greatly appreciate it!
"The S&P is having a slight sell off today, oil is the bright spot for a change. Finally seeing a reward for sitting on COP and other oil stocks. Dividend boost was nice to see.v"

$COP Maintains Credit Suisse Outperform USD 74 » USD 80 Maintains Truist Securities Buy USD 78 » USD 84
so will the purchase of shell assets be good for shareholders or are they rolling the dice? COP is a much bigger company than it was 2 years ago
I find its beyond amazing the lengths G20 leaders will go to force their failed attempts to control the climate.
I sold at 100% profit today. It's been a good run. Wish I had serious money in it but I'll take the profits and sit back for awhe
nice pop in the Energy sector
Do you think the Permian.biy is a good deal for you guys? I own Shell. I suspect the decision was a strategic one by Shell. Do you know what the break even was/is?
pps +10% this week. That's how I like to start my weekends. 
Hay COP Leadership DO NOT SELL ASSETS PERIOD. If anything buy under valued assets.
Everyone is rolling out of the overpriced tech sector into dividend-paying stocks with price upside. With oil poised to hit $100/bbl next year now is the time to get ahead of the game.https://www.worldoil.com/news/2021/6/21/bank-of-america-projects-2022-oil-prices-near-100-on-growing-travel-demand
Opened a long put position today. The historical pattern on the stock shows a peak between 75-85 and then a hard crash over the course of a year. Jan 2024 Put @ $30 should print $$. You are welcome
Thank you Shell for giving COP a great deal soon giving a ROI OF nearly 50% annually. Sorry Shell shareholders for your loss of soon to be over $4 billion annually.
Goldman Sachs downgraded stock to neutral. Who cares what they say. They just want to line their own pockets like most investment banks. They could care less about the average investor
"Per *Barron's*, 25 out of 31 analysts rate COP as a ""Buy"" at this time, while 4 give it an ""Overweight"" and two a ""Hold""."
"Blackstone Inc. co-founder Stephen Schwarzman said the world is facing energy shortages so severe they could cause social unrest.His comments were echoed by Larry Fink, who said there’s a high probability of oil soon reaching $100 a barrel, especially with many governments and investors pushing back against investments in fossil fuels.“Inflation, we are in a new regime,” said Fink, chairman of BlackRock Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager.“There are many structural reasons for that. Short term policy related to environmentalism, in terms of restricting supply of hydrocarbons, has created energy inflation and we are going to be living with that for some time.”Several analysts have said that European countries could halt gas exports to neighbors if winter’s colder than normal and prices keep rising.$SU $CNQ $ENB $COP $BP $OXY $VET $XOM $TOT $CVX $MPC $EOG $CLR $EPD $E $KMI $PSX $HAL $PTR $SNP $WMB $BKR $EC $IMO $CQP $MMP $TRP $XOG"
"Talking about fake news, how about on Global warming and climate change. Who's in charge? Follow the money. It talks. There is way too much money vested in Climate Change for Politicians and so called scientist to back up and earnestly study the facts (""do diligence"") and then accept the reality that CO2 is good for the planet and mankind. The whole planet and its life cycle, every living thing depend on CO2. CO2 0.04% could double and the result would be a greener planet and healthier people."
"For anyone that has been sitting on some cash, today is a great day to buy $XOM, $COP, $PSX, $VLO, $SLB, $HAL, $BKR, $MPLX, $SHLX, $PSXP. Look at microsoft. Algos are haywire. Reset before tomorrow open. Always great to get in at bargain basement prices!!!"
Nice to hold a stock a lot of people want for a change... Hope it continues for about 5 years and OPEC doesn't mess it all up..
Love this company
Anyone look at the historical chart and see a huge opportunity to short COP once its traded above $70 for a period of time? It has traditionally sold off quite significantly after trading at these levels. Thoughts?
Buy the next dip -- these stocks always relax a bit after a good run.
$70 incoming
I got out 6 months ago as soon as I got in the green. I’m glad to see the uptick for the long suffering longs and I hope it continues!
Red week started tomorrow in COP.My forecast minus 10% at next friday.
"Discussion: Now that it’s finally trending as predicted, what would a good price target be for adding to position? Former EE - I’ve been long in COP for 20+ year’s - held when all my friends jumped because of the good divy and knew we would be where we are now - wish I had the guts to add a bunch more few months back. Any seasoned analyst type folks here have an opinion for an old guy amateur? If I had $50k I was looking to reallocate somewhere for a couple years, is it too late to get in heavier on this ride, or is there another sector y’all think is the new “current” buy now hold long? There are some sharp peeps here on this board whose insights I’ve enjoyed reading over the years."
"Fossil fuels will be needed for the foreseeable future and there are is no new infrastructure being permitted, nor is there any increasing exploration because companies like COP are now more focused on maximizing existing assets and returning $ to shareholders. So M&A is the path forward as COP has provenThe Concho was huge, plus the recent Shell Permian Basin assets buy out will also pay big dividends.Strong hold."
Thank you Clyde for the thoughts about climate change and the industries involved with it. I'm also interested in the new technologies Chevron is moving into to remove carbon footprint... the CEO of Chevron was on with Jim Krammer a few nights ago discussing the new movement into a green product. Curious about your thoughts on this sensitive issue effecting the planet. thank you.. .salem
Does anyone know how COP determines the stock price for the DRIP purchase?
"News just out on ConocoPhillips buying all Shell's Permian Basin production of 175k/day. That's about $4.5B in revs per yr, nice buy. GLTA!"
