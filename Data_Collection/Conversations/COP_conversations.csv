Any idea how much revenue COP makes from sale of Natural Gas? Looks like Natural gas prices are holding up pretty good With all the talk about electric vehicles lots of power plants are powered by Natural gas?
"Dow up $164, Oil up c. $1 = COP down $0.60Makes sense. As usual, no manipulation here."
Saudi Arabia looking to take stronger steps to increase the price of oil towards $80 before their IPO. Expect COP to hit $70 by the end of September.and $75 by the end of October.
Everyone is rolling out of the overpriced tech sector into dividend-paying stocks with price upside. With oil poised to hit $100/bbl next year now is the time to get ahead of the game.https://www.worldoil.com/news/2021/6/21/bank-of-america-projects-2022-oil-prices-near-100-on-growing-travel-demand
"I bought a small position prior to earnings to cover for good news. As I still believe in this company long term and their strong balance sheet, I will take another position once price adjusts for this earning announcement."
Should have raised the divy.some.
an affiliate of COP is going to file for an IPO by the end of the year Concho Resources Will COP shareholders get shares of the new company when it goes public?
"Here's a little food for thought about the price of oil. Several years back, oil demand was outpacing supply and oil rose to over $100 per barrel. Some oilmen got innovative and started fracking shale and producing oil from it. Lots of it. And at $100 per barrel it was profitable. Then supply outstripped demand. Way outstripped demand. Prices dropped. So the question I have is what is the breakeven cost of this shale oil production that has shifted our oil price paradigm. I looked at the performance of two outfits that produce primarily from shale . . . Oasis (OAS) and Whiting (WLL). Looking at their earnings (or losses) over the past six quarters and the average WTI price over those quarters one can readily see that OAS requires about $60 WTI to breakeven and WLL requires about $63. IF this is truly reflective of the breakeven for this shale production, doesn't that mean that it will start dropping out until WTI is $70 or so, where COP can earn $1.50 per quarter and at a P/E of 15 (I mean a REAL P/E, not one of them Mickey Mouse ones) the share price would be about $90?"
Oil up another 1$ per bbl!
"Keystone killed, Alaska drilling killed, Saudis refuse to increase output- Oil goes higher from here. Breakout to 100 ahead."
Just spent $52.00 to fill up my sedan with gas. It was fun.Fortunately I only have to do that once a month.I am making up for the higher cost of gas by owning ConocoPhillips Stock.
"OVV was over-hedged, anyone know about COP?"

"In at 33.69, seems like a solid buy with a good dividend. Think I will hold over the long-term.Kevin"
"Back in the 10.50's - someone bought a bunch between 10.91 - 11.23not to long ago on a HEAVY trading dayWait for the COVID peak to start tailing off & alongwith Iran/Israel tensions & demand continuing to outpace supply....... crude will be back @ YTD HIGHS.Not to mention NG showing it's ""HIGH"" colors as well.I like me some $CLR $CDEV $COP $XOM $AR $PAA $FANG $BSM $VNOM.ENERGY HIGH 4sure !!!!!"
The disconnect gets even greater. Oil will go up as supply remains static and profits get plowed back into dividends and debt reductionWe are ceding control back to OPEC + and they are not our friends specially with sleepy Joe in charge
what’s the chances COP buys out 88 Energy ? 
This will move up to $70 later this year as COP will be making huge profits the next 3 quarters as they are now able to make a profit at roughly $28 a barrel.
CRUDE IS KING FOR NEXT 100 YEARS=NO ENERGY IS CHEAPER THAN CRUDE=ALL OTHERS HI RISK AND NOT RELIABLE=NATURAL GAS ALSO IS KING FOREVER....OR 100 YEARS.....
10% beat on eps and all we get is a <1% move in share price. the market does not love oil stocks. let's hope the earnings call this afternoon can deliver some more upside.
wow may oil futures 4.30
Brace yourselves for another plunge. And when China announces that they are not going to buy US oil it will be game over for the oil market and COP until 2021!Thanks Lance! And thanks Trump!Will the oil market get a bailout with US tax dollars like the farmers? Where do we sign up to get a piece of those tariffs that we're collecting from China to offset our current and upcoming losses?
Will we see plus $60 again?
"unusual raise.Take profit immediately.The ER is no difference to Oil company.The oil price drops, it has no reason to rise."
"$EEENF Since April:1. Now owns 100% of Peregrine 2. Extinguished all their debt. 3. $COP in their investor meeting mentioned the surrounding oil fields which include 88E. 4.

I just doubled my investment at the close. Dividend is affirmed and the stock price is below even the most pessimistic analyst target price.
"Looks like my Jan$67.50 CC will hold. Now I can wait till it climbs a bit, and write another for ~70, 72. This is the third CC I've written, all expired. Mostly LEAPS. This last had an effective APY of 5%. Not too shabby. I do this to augment the lame <2% yield, after multiyear freeze. Unacceptable when I have CVX and XOM paying >4%. I'm not dogging COP, I have made great total return since my buy, but divs are my paycheck in early retirement, and utes and commodities need to have >4% yields...it's available everywhere, even in this hightened overall market."
"Thank goodness, there was another inventory build last week per the API Report. That should have another great impact on COP's share price for the remainder of the week. Such a great future ahead for COP shareholders - nothing but good news week after week!"
"(Bloomberg) -- Gasoline demand surged to a a record high as Americans took to the road for the July 4th holiday weekend.Gasoline supplied, a proxy for demand, rose to 10 million barrels a day the week ended July 2, the highest in data going back to 1990, according to the Energy Information Administration.Demand has regained its footing as vaccinations and easing economic restrictions propel more Americans to resume their pre-pandemic lifestyles. Oil prices have risen almost 50% this year as U.S. refineries run close to full-bore to keep up with fuel demand. While the U.S. recovery quickens, the world’s largest oil producers can’t agree on how to supply the market with Saudi Arabia advocating for tempered supply increases given the potential headwinds that still exist.“Demand is bucking with the price spikes and summer driving, but with high gas prices and inflation, the picture in September may look different,” said Trisha Curtis, co-founder of PetroNerds.The moving average for demand also climbed higher, reaching the most since late 2019. But on a seasonal basis the figure was still about 150,000 barrels a day short of July 2019, suggesting the market still has some room to recover.U.S. motorists hit the road in large numbers despite contending with the highest gasoline prices since 2014.

"My 70 shares, Jesus....."
Oil Stock are like a popularity contest these days. It is uncool to be a part of them and they are artificially kept down. They should all stop production and bring the world to its knees. Remind these politicians and snowflakes what the world has to have.
I bought it 4 years ago for the dividend. They should raise back to where it was.
Cyber attack on pipeline major fuel line. Up goes gas prices
Looks like the march back to $60 is beginning with today's nice gains.
"Now what? was beginning to believe COP had some momentum. Oil looking ok, COP stalling out. Anybody have something I may have missed,"
"It was tempting to sell at 71, I'm in at 44, but I'm going to let this pony ride."
For last quarter COP stated that they had a realized oil price of a little over $53.00. Now oil has been way over that for the first quarter of this year. Shorts have been reduced with 1.8 days to cover. COP has improved their cash position considerably. Have the big traders resorted to manipulation to scare you out of your shares before earnings.
With everybody home due to covid heating oil will be through the roof this winter....
"I am Long and the size of my position changes on a technical basis. I also utilize options to lower my BE and hedge. That being said, my condensed analysis of COP is as follows: Negative Outlook: Slowing Demand, Norway- as announced will continue to unwind their position putting downward pressure on the name, Brent/WTI,Nat prices under pressure, Aramco IPO.Positive Outlook: Shale companies continue their bankruptcy trend(Yes, this is positive for the majors), Roughly 35% of oil produced by COP is Brent quality providing a higher bid, Nat Gas contracts in the future, B+ Balance Sheet assuming its accurate. That was a quick write up, anyone have anything to add?"
"On the earnings call, executives said that they didn't lock into the low rates, so as rates are rising now, COP is capturing all of the gain."
"""Even if Iran is able to add to global supply, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) still feels confident about the oil market.""

oil up cop down what a day. The dividend is safe I repeat the dividend is safe.
"The glutton in oil and natural gas isn't going away for the foreseeable future, the world's demand for oil will continue to decline over the next 2 decades until it will be deemed obsolete and a literal dinosaur fuel. Irregardless of that, even with current prices of oil and natural gas, you're looking at a stock that is trading at a forward P/E around 50-55. There is no way the full dividend will be in place within 9 months, let alone 6 at the current burn rate. Fair value for this issuance is half of the current price and that is assuming the dividend is only cut in half.We've been hooked on oil as a nation and a world for far too long, and other technologies will take over along with AI in our factories, general workplaces, and our modes of transportation. Our energy will certainly shift to one of many sources that has either been locked up, too expensive til now, or hidden from the Rothschilds and Rockefellers, and countless oil barons, who coincidentally have exited from all their oil positions well before this crash occurred.Please stay vigilant, and aware, oil is not our future, it's actually one of the only things that has failed to join the technological curve we entered 4 decades ago, but somehow oil was able to in turn enter a bubble on false promises of ""peak oil"" was an entire lie to scam oil consumers with ridiculous price gouging of a commodity that we could literally drill infinite of from the earth's continuous blood stream. Fortunately for the world's people, much more cleaner and efficient technology will replace it, much like many human jobs will also be replaced by AI over the course of the next 2 decades.Good luck, stay happy, stay healthy, peace & love my friends."
Soon oil consumption will catch up to earnings and the energy sector will sky rocket...unless another marketing campaign derails it.
"Zacks strong sell. Thanks,confirms my plan to hold long term."
"I am still thinking this is a $60 stock easy in 6 months, so setbacks are fine. I buy. Strong company, good financials, a product that the whole world will need en masse, and well, a history of being well managed. Maybe it does not hit $66, but I am in for 30% gains and will be fine waiting. Buy on dips."
Square Capital predicting $100 plus oil before year end with major climb starting now. Says under-investment with increasing demand will surprise many and now is the time to buy oils...
FANG reported a huge Earnings and Revs beat for Q1. Suggests the CXO part of COP will be a big contribution to the Q1 report tomorrow for COP. Add to that today's report that consumers are paying the increased (inflation) prices of things with little objection. Retail gasoline will add big. Overall - should be a nice morning on Tuesday.
"Howard Marks discusses second level thinking in his great book The Most Important Thing. With the hoopla surrounding Engine 1 getting two board members elected to XOM board first level thinking seems to say this is bad for Big Oil. But, second level thinking might look at this and say this is another step to constraining supply and oil prices will rise more than expected in the future."
I originally bought it for the dividend. It would be nice if they brought it back up
"#$%$ heads on CNBC said oil going lower, yet everyone else said give it a bit and it goes way higher. Makes you wonder if they don?t try to manipulate the market"
COP is up 4.90% to 57.14
I think the balancesheet looks strong
"Trade the multi-year cycle, don’t sell until 70+"
"I don’t know if buying right now before the market closes, I should’ve bought yesterday was about to pull the trigger but expected lower oil prices to have an impact in the price, I was right on that but no one expected that “new treatment” and Trump announcement for opening the economy"
"Has this stock any hope of improvements? Something seems wrong when most of the oil companies ConocoPhillips last year saw its revenue spike 25 percent up to more than $36 billion. And its net income rose to $6.3 billion compared to a nearly $1 billion loss in the year prior. The Houston producer also is off to a good start in 2019, turning a $1.8 billion profit in the first quarter that doubled its net gain for the first three months of 2018."
"With $15 Billion authorized for buyback, I hope they are taking advantage of these prices! Below $30 that cuts the shares outstanding in half!!"
I bought 1000 more at $32.40.. you won't get this price again
Lets hope in 2021 that life returns to normal. Im thinking the pent up demand for travel is huge right now. So with that said im thinking oil is going up to at least 55 a barrel in the next few months. So if COP is able to obtain oil for about 30 a barrel can you imagine what earnings will be in 2021?
if biden wins what happens to fracking and any deal cop gets itself into? shouldnt they wait to see who wins b4 they take on a huge debt bill and its all 4 naught?
Pretty basic— stocks are on sale even blue chippers— buy and hold
"Oil demand is recovering faster than previously expected, and unless OPEC+ puts additional barrels on the market on top of the plans to restore 2 million barrels per day (bpd) by July, oil prices will be heading higher as the gap will widen, the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, told Bloomberg Television in an interview on Tuesday.. $ENB $COP $BP $OXY $CNQ $SU"
What the he'll is wrong with oil stocksEverything humans use is from oil. EverythingMakes no sense
It will be interesting to see how OPEC+ reacts to the current oil price collapse at their upcoming meeting. Hopefully with a very meaningful production cut of at least 1 million b/d.
"New here so I apologize in advance if my question is repetitive. Long time share holder as is most my family. Now I’m in a position to invest 10k more. I missed the extreme low a month or more ago. Does anyone else feel that it is overvalued at this time? Do we see a significant drop in the coming quarter? Should of could of would ofs I know. But I like everyone else I’m sure, rather buy more in the high 20s, or low 30s. It just seems to me it’s priced a bit high. I know the cut cost right away and have nearly no debt I believe, but still seems that the share price isn’t quite accurate for the time being. Thoughts? Also I feel this will go upward above $65 again and possibly pushing the 90s. In time. Any thoughts on that?"
Bought 2000 shares at 34.9. Oil demand should be going up with vaccine approval soon by Pfizer.
Oil is the future
"Anyone know what is moving oil stocks up sharply today? Is this normal to move inverse of oil price? When WTI hit 17.31 (down 16% this morning) COP was up 10%. I sold out at 33 and change fearing COP would pullback when oil gets to $10 or even lower. It's up to $35 now! I only recently started following this stock and made the invalid assumption that COP, CVX, etc would somewhat track oil based on some reading and other posters. Anyone have insight on how COP typically moves based on oil price? If oil only goes down to 12-15 will it move COP into high 40s? Any advice appreciated. I may buy back in if not too late for what looks like a really strong run for oil stocks!!"
Does anyone know which analyst upgraded their 1 year target price to $90? Seems completely contrary to the recent downgrade from B of A. Would love to see the analysis supporting that target price if anyone knows where it was published.
"Down almost 5% in one week while oil is still up? Average price target is still $78? Any sensible, logical explanation for all of this?"
Barclays initiated coverage with a Buy rating and a $79 price target. Maybe there is some hope I can recover some of my investment in this dog.
Oils looking great; crude up again today; COP up 4% plus today; what's not to like !! 3-21-18
"Due to the FACT almost everything in this Market is way overvalued (except for BA), decided to take a chance on good, old, All American, COP this morning!! I really like the fact its getting ready to take out the 200 day average again. If this occurs look for a short term move into the 61 to 62 range!! I also love their small Cash to debt levels and 3% dividend!!"
Energy clearly unloved here. Banking on earnings crush to wake the market up to 70+ oil and the profit ramifications for drillers.More divs and buybacks to come albeit frustrating
Now that COP has merged with CXO; should it mean COP is more valuable now than it was; in theory ?
Dividend just got increased.
Oil stock selloff couldn't be more misguided today. OPEC + will not open the spigots full on Thurs and Oil will continue north of 70 all summer giving COP and others license to print money
This is not the time for Conoco to be spending billions when the stock is in the tank.
Chances of collecting the $2B from Venezuela?
I remember when $DAL bought a refinery from $COP to hedge pricing flight tickets. I wonder if $QCOM $160B market cap could buy $GSAT $2B market cap to hedge pricing its phones. It’s peanuts for QCOM after all.
COP is holding up well considering that a barrel of oil is soon going to be cheaper than a Big Mac
This thing has been a bit of a dog compared to the other energy stocks
Bullish but only cuz expected supply gonna be down as Saudi Arabia refuses to expand production plus summer always got higher gas prices
"Hmmm, not too bad of a report today. Despite various divestures and concerns about contracting oil demand this year, COP's oil output/sales increased. As such, earnings were 0.82 cents/share, beating the analyst consensus by 13%. They have clearly held and even increased their market share. 750M more put into buybacks as well, as expected. With the average prices this past quarter, that's about 14M shares repurchased or 1.25% of the company. Will be interested to see how their new Alaskan exploration projects go."
"COP haven’t felt excited for a stock with potential in a while￼, It was trading at $67 a share pre-pandemic￼. Then came the purchase of (CXO) Their stock was over &100 respectfully before the world shut down￼￼￼. Feeling good vibes we’ll see what happens.￼"
Gulf oil output down as the Hurricane passes. how many rigs does COP have in the Gulf of Mexico?
"OPEC+ abandoned its meeting without a deal, tipping the cartel into crisis and leaving the oil market facing tight supplies and rising prices.Several days of tense talks failed to resolve a bitter dispute between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, delegates said, asking not to be named because the information wasn’t public. The group didn’t agree on a date for its next meeting, according to a statement from OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo.The most immediate effect of the breakdown is that, unless an agreement can be salvaged, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies won’t increase production for August. That will deprive the global economy of vital extra supplies as demand recovers rapidly from the coronavirus pandemic.$SU $CNQ $ENB $COP $BP $OXY $VET $XOM $TOT $CVX $MPC $EOG $CLR $EPD $PTR $PBR $E $KMI $ET $ARX"
Microsoft 2.2 trillion dollar market cap...That is a larger Market Cap than Conoco Philips Exxon Chevron ATT Wal Mart Target General Mills Union Pacific Merck Wells Fargo and IBM combined and you would still have a few hundred Billion left over..
Wow the markets today…..XOM and COP are 2 to 5 year investments not 2 to 5 hour investments. 1) oil Demand is rising 2) Investment in new Supply is low 3) Oil stock pay oversized dividends 4) Those dividends will rise with higher sustained oil prices and more focused smaller capital spending and cost cutting 5) debt will be reduced 6) stock will be bought back 7) oil stocks are under-owned.Tom Lee says owning energy over the next 5 years will be transformative to portfolio returns.
"COP, EOG, ENB great dividends, great future"
I waiting for the dividend to go back up. I hope that happens soon
"Any word of discussions with Chevron or others? They could probably pick up COP at $80 per share if they made an offer now. In a few weeks, it will probably cost another $10 a share to purchase."
I hope they raise the dividend.
$70 after earnings??
I wonder how much of COP oil is hedged and at what price. I hope they are not locked into a much lower price for oil. Oil at this level should increase their cash flow at a much higher level since they have said they can make money at $40 oil.
Will check back this afternoon and see if the sell off continues. Thinking friday might be the day to load up again.
"EIA reported 6.495 barrel draw from storage, almost twice what was expected."
"Was anybody out here formerly a Concho holder? After what has unfolded, I can't believe CXO management panicked and soldout at the bottom!! I bought MRO @ $4 and OXY @ $10 within a few days of the COP merger announcement and both tripled off the low. With prime Permian assets, CXO would have recovered to $100-$120 by now but instead we're stuck with this dog COP. Geezzz...once again wacked by bone-headed management!!"
Report looks good. Should finally have a positive effect on our pps. Strong cash flow and increased share buyback could result in a sustained runup in the price.
"If break even is at ~$40 as COP mentioned some months ago when oil was at around that price, then the next quarterly report should be smashing. Let's hope. To be followed by a move to $80."
"If the lowest analyst's estimate is $70, why is this stock trading at $63 and change after this earnings beat?"
Results of my analysis:4Q19 Earnings = 86 centsCOP business improvement over past three years yields an extra 65 cents in quarterly earnings at ANY GIVEN COMMODITY PRICE.COP business improvement over past three years has lowered WTI Breakeven from $53.58 to $41.18.Details posted on IV.
What the he'll is wrong with cop. Upgrades everywhere.And down all the time.
This stock should be closer to the oil price of 60. With the new oil finds in Norway and the assets of Concho we should be 60 or higher.
COP reached a new 52 Week High at 61.94
"I too believe that out of all the big oil companies....XOM, CVX, COP, BP, etc....COP has the most upside, best positioned, financially secure of these companies. However; still too expensive and overpriced at this stage of recovery. My personal target is $35 and under for the long haul"
"Wow, what a last month, congrats all longs...Fatts"
Why can't independent oil companies agree to control production so they can get a profitable price? I suppose OPEC members are the only smart ones.
"Assuming Joe Biden does what he said on day 1 meaning corp taxes up and some oil law to limit drilling and things like that, we would see a major correction. wouldnt be smart to wait day 1 of his presidency to get back into oil?"
lounging around 4 month lows while oil is making new highs .. terrific . should be over 70 .
VTNR - We will know where VTNR another energy stock heads after 10th when they announce earnings. Oil sectors is reporting great earnings.
Average earnings increased from 84 cents to 90 cents and yearly expected high increased from $79.00 to 79.94 today on Yahoo Finance.
"Yo, Randall. Not every message shows up with each page load. Reload to double check. Now I know you feel all your posts are precious, but really you’re starting to verge on the edge of spamming."
"If Western governments were truly concerned with climate change and deadlines, they would call on OPEC to cut production not increase it! Higher prices denting demand means less CO2!"
Buying more COP tomorrow at the open. Holding 3k+ but I think it will be a home run on May 1st. Disappointed that it is under 60 considering WTI over 66. What do you guys think?
Here we go!! $60.00 just around the corner....
Average analyst target price is $78 with a low of $70 yet COP can't even maintain $60 for more than a day or two? Makes no sense at all.
"J.P. Morgan analyst Phil Gresh analyzed cash flow for major oil companies with Brent oil at $30 per barrel. Of 10 North American integrated oil companies—generally larger producers that also conduct operations like refining—five have positive free cash flow with oil at $30 a barrel, and none would be able to fully fund their dividends without using balance sheet cash, taking on debt, or selling assets. The ones in the “best” shape include Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP)."
Is COP undervalued compared to XOM and CVX?
We have a serious disconnect between catering WTI and the shares of our largest oil companies. We are under 11 for the near term futures contract and after a bruising fall in trading today the shares of those same companies were higher. That also applies to companies like Valero. I want to believe that some major announcement will rectify this anomaly shortly as this incongroence isn't sustaibable..
I need 75.38 to break even on 1200 shares owning since 2013

fast charge a Tesla cost $82/mm btu whereas gasoline cost $18/mm btu. once EV start paying state and federal road use taxes and no more federal giveaways the hype for EV will dwindle
Dont be surprised if COP isnt acquired by Chevron or some other big oil company. CVX is an a good financial position to buy COP. Oil prices are killing big oil. There will be mergers. Look at Exxon when they bought Mobil in the late 90's when oil proces were at 10$
A gift at this valuation. The EV promise is a decade early.
You know the bottom is In for oil when the consolidation process begins. Make no mistake folks it has already began. This past week alone there were 4 deals. Now is the time for us to capitalize on energy names. Only top names will prosper and COP is one of these names.
At 34 I was prepared to buy more but waited for a better low Missed a huge gain on that one
Get used to $75 oil and COP will be moving up along with it
"Other than oil, finance and travel, there really aren't many areas where you can make big money on the comeback from covid. Most others are bid up, many way too high. Finance may take quite some time because it has unrelated issues. Oil and travel should do quite well the next year or two."
Climbing to green today? Amazing stock considering the current environment. I almost bought Chevron and I am really glad I bought COP instead. It is good to know the temporary oil price drops do not effect this stock.
We are setting up for 70.00 oil by the end of the year with all the cuts in production worldwide. As things reopen huge demand on the way. Then $60 to $65 for COP BY END OF 2020.
"coalition led by Saudi Arabia and Russia believes that the glut created during the pandemic has nearly gone, and that oil stockpiles will diminish rapidly in the second half of the year as lockdowns ease and travel gathers pace. $SU $OXY $BP $COP"
"COP is amazing stock. 10bn cash, almost no current debt. Cash covers a lot of long term debt. So, excellent balance sheet, not a lot of risk here. Excellent position to buy Distressed assets and grow in the future.Buy on dips when the market index is under selling pressure."
Buy backs.upgrades everywhere.cop.being a dog lately.Don't understand.world would not exist right now without oil.Wall street just don't get it.they want overpriced tech stocks.
API report just out showed oil in storage down 11.1 million barrels versus down 3.4 million week before.
"COP declares .43 Qtrly Dividend - payable June 1, 2021, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 14, 2021.Also plans to reduce debt by $5 Bln over next 5 years.ConocoPhillips intends to sell its Cenovus shares in the open market beginning in the second quarter of 2021 and expects to complete the sale process by the fourth quarter of 2022, utilizing the proceeds to fund incremental repurchases of ConocoPhillips shares."
When is the meeting today anyone know?
in regards to balance sheet - still the healthiest compared to Exxon and Chevron.
"So weird, COP is profitable, just paid dividend, Vaccine going to be released in days, not sure why this is draining lower."
Cop just won't move up .see everywhere buy recommendations solid company but it won't move .should be at least $60.
I raise COP's target price of $80 this year.
The longer oil stays over 60 the better for COP
still going to 100 at this rate buy on dips
"is it time to purchase some short term puts, August 6th strike @ $53.00 is cheap right now?"
Only pure play oil stock with superb balance sheet. Cops money printing presses running non stop as it doesn't hedge. Gonna be blockbuster..shorts will be caught flat footed. I will buy
Time to buy ?
whats with this stock .. oil making new highs and conoco is making 5 month lows .. we should be over 70

I added 20 shares recently. Hope this rebounds nicely in a year or so !
"at this price COP is an awesome deal and ill be watching to double down. oil is still king, well at least for the next 5 years..."
COP Q1 adjusted EPS .69 vs est .48 S&P est. other est .51 still big beat !
I feel that Chevron will make an offer to acquire COP at some time in the not so distant future. My reasoning is as follows:COP split off downstream a few years ago.COP sold off its UK assets a few months ago making it a more attractive morsel.There would be buyers for its Norway assets (Statoil or Total) making it very attractive.Occidental showed Chevron how to raise money by selling off a target's unwanted assets when it pre-soldAnadarko's unwanted assets to Total for mainly cash.Chevron is in the market to buy production as shown by its recent offer to buy Anadarko.

"I'm reposting Jim's post from the SU conversation. It is extremely interesting to understanding the price movement in oil yesterday:$SU conversationShort data: March18 ,2021Today, Short sellers employed all of their tools in order to bring oil stocks and future contracts down.After failing to create a sell off in oil stocks ,they started to shorting April and May contacts for future oil.They brought WTI to 59$ from 64$.Biggest single drop since April2020.As you see in below data, compare to share price drop, the volume was extremely low.This volume does not match with share price drop.That was just a pure and irresponsible manipulation.Most media in the World censored this extraordinary event in capital market.We are talking about tens of Billions of $ contracts and options which they are trying to kill them, plus covering their short position with creating fake sell off(scaring shareholders).So far, we haven’t had sell off.Low volume.They prefer spent and burn few billion dollars and sell stocks at discount, but meanwhile save tens of billions of money in other side.Extreme and irresponsible manipulation which will have consequences in future of oil market ,especially in next OPEC+ meeting and their next policy.Explanation about below data:Vol: The total volume numbers of first hand shares which is coming into market for trading.It is different than total volume that you see in yahoo or elsewhere.Because in total volume one share can change many hands between traders.But original amount of coming shares and shorted shares are constant for day.For Canadian Stocks the volume is just for US market.SU : (Vol 2.326M shares), (Short 0.769M shares ), (33% of coming shares for trade)SU :XOM (Vol 12M ), (Short 5.715M ), (48% )CLR (Vol 1.129M ), (Short 0.703M ), (63% )CVX (Vol 3.363M ), (Short 1.784M ), (53% )OXY (Vol 8.277M ), (Short 5.32M ), (64% )CPG (Vol 0.693M ), (Short 0.314M ), (45% )CNQ (Vol 0.664M ), (Short 0.217M ), (33% )ENB (Vol 0.885M ), (Short 0.57M ), (64% )BP (Vol 3.458M ), (Short 1.265M ), (37% )CVE (Vol 1.543M ), (Short 0.978M ), (64% )CDEV (Vol 7.627M ), (Short 4.025M ), (53% )FANG (Vol 1.087M ), (Short 0.505M ), (47% )CPE (Vol 1.615M ), (Short 0.697M ), (43% )MRO (Vol 10.09M ), (Short 5.662M ), (56% )SLB (Vol 4.484M ), (Short 1.632M ), (36% )HAL (Vol 2.948M ), (Short 0.971M ), (33% )RIG (Vol 12.58M ), (Short 7.285M ), (58% )TOT (Vol 0.553M ), (Short 0.378M ), (68% )PXD (Vol 0.859M ), (Short 0.51M ), (60% )COP (Vol 2.865M ), (Short 0.808M ), (28% )BKR (Vol 1.79M ), (Short 0.659M ), (37% )LPI (Vol 0.417M ), (Short 0.181M ), (44% )PDS (Vol 0.054M ), (Short 0.02M ), (38% )#XOM, #CLR , #CVX , #OXY , #CPG , #CNQ , #ENB , #BP , #CVE , #CDEV , #FANG , #CPE, #MRO , #SLB, #HAL, #RIG , #TOT, #PXD , #COP, #BKR , #LPI , #PDS"
COP being investigated in Louisiana. What in the world is this about?
Texas and supply. Going to 70 bucks a barrel. Just on two television stations. I can see conoco at 60 for a short time until correction
The API report just out reported a 7.2 million draw in oil storage.
"$44 a share? Who thinks that is the high? This is incredibly low priced now, is A-rated, has the financials in order and is acquiring companies faster than Trump can say ""Fantastic"" again. I put this stock closer to $62 within a year....minus serious, worldwide, shutdowns."
I’ve counted 9 upgrades in three weeks. Anyone know of another stock that has done this in the last 6 months?
Would you say ConocoPhillips is a good stock for long term?
Everyone in the world is realizing that $CVX $XOM $BP $COP and others are vital for the next 10 to 20 years. Where does $CVX go in the next 12 months? Back to 130s?
"Aug 21st: Morgan Stanley maintains Overweight (Buy) rating and moves price target from $40 to $47, which is a 20% price gain from Aug 24th excluding dividends."
"positive earnings take us down 2%, wait for a little negative (like oil down $2) to start the day Monday and we will see an exponential fall in share price"
What happened? Why is drops?
I think the Fed will announce an emergency meeting as early as today. I think the emergency meeting will happen yet this week. I think that at the emergency meeting they will announce a 25 basis point cut in the Fed Fund Rates and signal another 25 basis point cut at the September meeting. I think the markets will respond very positively.
Today's drop of .8% really chafes me. Market up ~380; my other right stock up nicely: COP down. Mystifying unless someone could enlighten me about news I missed.
What happened to COP dividend? The ex-div date was supposed to be around Jan 16th!
Bank of America raises to a buy and lifts price target to $67.
"shares may drop some more, they were down a solid $2 in two trading days before quarter one earnings"
Full investigation need into the Rona 19 orgins . The virus has NEVER neem isolated making the entire thing look like a HOAX . PCR counted Flu cases as Covid . How can u make a VAX for a virus that does not exist
"Federal Judge Pulls Permits For ConocoPhillips Oil Project Due To Impact On ""Climate Change And Polar Bears"""
"After extensive research, 2020 looks eerily similar to 2016. SP started year around 50 and crashed to 29 when oil dropped similar to this year. Oil steadily recovered and COP was back above 50 by end of year. Oil price average for the year dropped to $42 and COP only lost $1 Bil (gross). Once the market realizes COP can lose $1-2 Billion, continue paying dividend for years, and oil stabilizes we will be back above $50. I'm afraid we may be stuck in the mid 30's until then. The impact of the covid is grossly overstated IMHO."
"I looked at insider transactions for COP. I normally don't do that for such big companies and what I saw disheartens me. I looked at the NASDAQ site that details Form 4 transactions. Ryan Lance owns just about no stock in COP. He owns 45,000 shares but that is it. In the lat year or so he was granted and immediately cashed in around 500,000 shares. Maybe that is why he prefers stock buybacks over dividends. The buybacks prop up the stock price so he can cash in. The numbers I looked at may be wrong but if they are correct Ryan Lance is a scoundrel in my opinion. For those of you hoping to be bought out by Chevron and Exxon, well, you can stop dreaming. A buyout will not benefit Lance at all but instead would derail the sweet gravy train he is riding. What a punk."
Ryan Lance views cash paid to shareholders are wasted money. Buying back stock never really does anything for a stock price because in the end other variables wash out the effect of the buyback. Do you want to see COP's share price jump? Rather than squandering $3.5 billion propping up an overpriced stock pay the cash out as a special dividend and announce all end of the day free cash flow will be paid out as special dividends in the future. Ryan Lance does not have the strategic vision needed to get COP out of the hole he helped put it in by spinning off PSX. There is also a disconnect between COP analysts and reality. This is not a $78 stock. These may not be the best of times in the oil patch but they aren't bad and COP shareholders are stuck with a plummeting stock price and a punk dividend. We are standing around waiting to get bowled over by $30 oil.
Oil stocks not making much sense. Oil stabilizing at higher price. Cash flows going to be incredible. Yet stocks are languishing in a rising market.
shares dropped $2 day before last earnings too. Oil is much more likely to reach pandemic levels with any kind of likely market correction
Nice volume but still below 60. What gives?
"The cartel is on our side. Even though Saudi Arabia has one of the lowest oil production costs, their fiscal breakeven price is much higher since they need approximately $83.60 oil for a balanced budget. This is further proven by the fact that Saudi Arabia lost an estimated $12 billion in April 2020 compared to the previous year as a result of depressed prices .$SU $OXY $CNQ $ENB $COP $BP"
"The additional dollars added to the buy back program is great news. I wish that actual shares purchased by the company was stated in addition to the dollar amounts. The buy back program sounds good, but it is the purchase of shares that means something."
Another COVID scare and turmoil everywhere. It’s still going past 70
He's my Hero! Increased the Dividend! The Sky is the Limit!
"I love the CEO ,getting on CNBC ,stated that they would make money @ 20 a barrel,........that is stout ,the reason is they have no debt to pay banks !!!!!"
Do you think COP will hit $70 this week?
COP discovers gas in the North and the stock does not go up. Jed Clampet would be confused.
"the boost in the price is certainly aided by the 50 day moving aver. crossing back over the 200 day aver. in dec. - the ""golden cross "" . always a positive forecaster for higher prices ."
"There's no way that this stock does not double in value by the Spring/Summer 2021. The second the vaccine hits, this will jump 20%. Oil has bottomed, we are bumping along the bottom now, very little lower area left. Probably be $60+ by next year this time when travel rebounds and all the pent up desire gets going."
Today has all the earmarks of COP moving up town. Great above average volume with a nice uptick.
"Stock will go much higher if management announces an increase in the dividend going into 2018. They keep saying they are committed to return value to shareholders. Well, we are waiting. Good luck folks."
"I bought it for the dividend. Let’s be fair. Stock price had been steadily increasing, the dividend should go up."
I am considering buying a large amount of share in COP. Can anyone tell me your opinion about the company. I am willing and able to hold it for 3 years.
"Wow, that was an absolutely massive earnings beat! They just topped every quarterly estimate placed for the next year, and the full effect of $70 oil has yet to hit the top and bottom line. :) Seems the analysts suck at predicting lol."

"Alright folks Cramer called the top in oil. It has backed off but still Holding above $70. The oil stocks are acting like oil is In The $50’s. What to do hold, load up or bail? And what is your reasoning foe your answer?"
Sick isn't it how unloved oil is once again. We've been here so many times before. The real story is that fuel is not being used at a brisk pace because the world is awash with Covid. Forget what Opec is doing because the pricing decisions they make end up hurting themselves more than any benefit they would derive from it. Strip out all the fear that a Democratic government will reign in fossil fuel production won't stick because oil still rules what happens economically in the world inspite of predictions of electric cars for everyone in ten years or 50 percent clean energy in 20 years. Nothing moves that fast and were probably stuck with fossil fuel for another 100 years....long after none of this matters to any of us. So buy some of these horribly depressed companies because they are on sale relative to what assets they have....Im buying every opportunity I get. Buy Airlines too and Boeing....
