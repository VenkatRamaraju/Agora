Square Capital predicting $100 plus oil before year end with major climb starting now. Says under-investment with increasing demand will surprise many and now is the time to buy oils...
Today's drop of .8% really chafes me. Market up ~380; my other right stock up nicely: COP down. Mystifying unless someone could enlighten me about news I missed.
"Down almost 5% in one week while oil is still up? Average price target is still $78? Any sensible, logical explanation for all of this?"
FANG reported a huge Earnings and Revs beat for Q1. Suggests the CXO part of COP will be a big contribution to the Q1 report tomorrow for COP. Add to that today's report that consumers are paying the increased (inflation) prices of things with little objection. Retail gasoline will add big. Overall - should be a nice morning on Tuesday.
lounging around 4 month lows while oil is making new highs .. terrific . should be over 70 .
Great skit about COP on jimmy kimmel
What the he'll is wrong with cop. Upgrades everywhere.And down all the time.
"Yo, Randall. Not every message shows up with each page load. Reload to double check. Now I know you feel all your posts are precious, but really you’re starting to verge on the edge of spamming."
COP being investigated in Louisiana. What in the world is this about?
Barclays initiated coverage with a Buy rating and a $79 price target. Maybe there is some hope I can recover some of my investment in this dog.
"I bought it for the dividend. Let’s be fair. Stock price had been steadily increasing, the dividend should go up."
Massive rainfall relief coming to Northern CA and without NET ZERO . The left is TRIGGERED
"For anyone that has been sitting on some cash, today is a great day to buy $XOM, $COP, $PSX, $VLO, $SLB, $HAL, $BKR, $MPLX, $SHLX, $PSXP. Look at microsoft. Algos are haywire. Reset before tomorrow open. Always great to get in at bargain basement prices!!!"
oil up cop down what a day. The dividend is safe I repeat the dividend is safe.
"With $15 Billion authorized for buyback, I hope they are taking advantage of these prices! Below $30 that cuts the shares outstanding in half!!"
Dont be surprised if COP isnt acquired by Chevron or some other big oil company. CVX is an a good financial position to buy COP. Oil prices are killing big oil. There will be mergers. Look at Exxon when they bought Mobil in the late 90's when oil proces were at 10$
Love this company
Which oil/energy company is best positioned to withstand this economic downturn? Who wants to make a prediction as to which company will lead the way in a recovery?
"The S&P is having a slight sell off today, oil is the bright spot for a change. Finally seeing a reward for sitting on COP and other oil stocks. Dividend boost was nice to see.v"
"If break even is at ~$40 as COP mentioned some months ago when oil was at around that price, then the next quarterly report should be smashing. Let's hope. To be followed by a move to $80."
"Other than oil, finance and travel, there really aren't many areas where you can make big money on the comeback from covid. Most others are bid up, many way too high. Finance may take quite some time because it has unrelated issues. Oil and travel should do quite well the next year or two."
"Zacks strong sell. Thanks,confirms my plan to hold long term."
This stock should be closer to the oil price of 60. With the new oil finds in Norway and the assets of Concho we should be 60 or higher.
"(Bloomberg) -- Gasoline demand surged to a a record high as Americans took to the road for the July 4th holiday weekend.Gasoline supplied, a proxy for demand, rose to 10 million barrels a day the week ended July 2, the highest in data going back to 1990, according to the Energy Information Administration.Demand has regained its footing as vaccinations and easing economic restrictions propel more Americans to resume their pre-pandemic lifestyles. Oil prices have risen almost 50% this year as U.S. refineries run close to full-bore to keep up with fuel demand. While the U.S. recovery quickens, the world’s largest oil producers can’t agree on how to supply the market with Saudi Arabia advocating for tempered supply increases given the potential headwinds that still exist.“Demand is bucking with the price spikes and summer driving, but with high gas prices and inflation, the picture in September may look different,” said Trisha Curtis, co-founder of PetroNerds.The moving average for demand also climbed higher, reaching the most since late 2019. But on a seasonal basis the figure was still about 150,000 barrels a day short of July 2019, suggesting the market still has some room to recover.U.S. motorists hit the road in large numbers despite contending with the highest gasoline prices since 2014.

pps +10% this week. That's how I like to start my weekends. 
COP reached a 52 Week high at 76.87
Another COVID scare and turmoil everywhere. It’s still going past 70
So some of the same jokers politicians want to ban oil while at the same time are heavily invested in battery operated investments . How is that not a conflict of interest. It won't hold water More gas lighting bS
Bullish but only cuz expected supply gonna be down as Saudi Arabia refuses to expand production plus summer always got higher gas prices
"at this price COP is an awesome deal and ill be watching to double down. oil is still king, well at least for the next 5 years..."
"As a long term buy/hold/ and drip investor, I'm enjoying the COP recovery. I've been in since 2010, finally getting some payback. The prospects look a lot brighter than they have for quite a while..."
so will the purchase of shell assets be good for shareholders or are they rolling the dice? COP is a much bigger company than it was 2 years ago
Bank of America raises to a buy and lifts price target to $67.
Sick isn't it how unloved oil is once again. We've been here so many times before. The real story is that fuel is not being used at a brisk pace because the world is awash with Covid. Forget what Opec is doing because the pricing decisions they make end up hurting themselves more than any benefit they would derive from it. Strip out all the fear that a Democratic government will reign in fossil fuel production won't stick because oil still rules what happens economically in the world inspite of predictions of electric cars for everyone in ten years or 50 percent clean energy in 20 years. Nothing moves that fast and were probably stuck with fossil fuel for another 100 years....long after none of this matters to any of us. So buy some of these horribly depressed companies because they are on sale relative to what assets they have....Im buying every opportunity I get. Buy Airlines too and Boeing....
I got out 6 months ago as soon as I got in the green. I’m glad to see the uptick for the long suffering longs and I hope it continues!
Report looks good. Should finally have a positive effect on our pps. Strong cash flow and increased share buyback could result in a sustained runup in the price.
"coalition led by Saudi Arabia and Russia believes that the glut created during the pandemic has nearly gone, and that oil stockpiles will diminish rapidly in the second half of the year as lockdowns ease and travel gathers pace. $SU $OXY $BP $COP"
Average analyst target price is $78 with a low of $70 yet COP can't even maintain $60 for more than a day or two? Makes no sense at all.
Aug 4th: Credit Suisse Group initiated a Buy rating at $52 (35% gain over $38.50).
The longer oil stays over 60 the better for COP
Nice volume but still below 60. What gives?
Hay COP Leadership DO NOT SELL ASSETS PERIOD. If anything buy under valued assets.
"Wow, what a last month, congrats all longs...Fatts"
Looks like the march back to $60 is beginning with today's nice gains.
Couple other tidbits; It flew past the 50 day and now closing in on the 200 day.Over 1mm short shares covered in July.
"#$%$ heads on CNBC said oil going lower, yet everyone else said give it a bit and it goes way higher. Makes you wonder if they don?t try to manipulate the market"
I sold at 100% profit today. It's been a good run. Wish I had serious money in it but I'll take the profits and sit back for awhe
How high can this go? Will there be a pull back?
I bought it 4 years ago for the dividend. They should raise back to where it was.
"Has this stock any hope of improvements? Something seems wrong when most of the oil companies ConocoPhillips last year saw its revenue spike 25 percent up to more than $36 billion. And its net income rose to $6.3 billion compared to a nearly $1 billion loss in the year prior. The Houston producer also is off to a good start in 2019, turning a $1.8 billion profit in the first quarter that doubled its net gain for the first three months of 2018."
"Trade the multi-year cycle, don’t sell until 70+"
I was buying this <$30 ad people told Oil is Dead stories
I just doubled my investment at the close. Dividend is affirmed and the stock price is below even the most pessimistic analyst target price.
Microsoft 2.2 trillion dollar market cap...That is a larger Market Cap than Conoco Philips Exxon Chevron ATT Wal Mart Target General Mills Union Pacific Merck Wells Fargo and IBM combined and you would still have a few hundred Billion left over..
Thank you Clyde for the thoughts about climate change and the industries involved with it. I'm also interested in the new technologies Chevron is moving into to remove carbon footprint... the CEO of Chevron was on with Jim Krammer a few nights ago discussing the new movement into a green product. Curious about your thoughts on this sensitive issue effecting the planet. thank you.. .salem

"Per *Barron's*, 25 out of 31 analysts rate COP as a ""Buy"" at this time, while 4 give it an ""Overweight"" and two a ""Hold""."
Wow the markets today…..XOM and COP are 2 to 5 year investments not 2 to 5 hour investments. 1) oil Demand is rising 2) Investment in new Supply is low 3) Oil stock pay oversized dividends 4) Those dividends will rise with higher sustained oil prices and more focused smaller capital spending and cost cutting 5) debt will be reduced 6) stock will be bought back 7) oil stocks are under-owned.Tom Lee says owning energy over the next 5 years will be transformative to portfolio returns.
Gulf oil output down as the Hurricane passes. how many rigs does COP have in the Gulf of Mexico?
I bought 1000 more at $32.40.. you won't get this price again
an affiliate of COP is going to file for an IPO by the end of the year Concho Resources Will COP shareholders get shares of the new company when it goes public?
"oil is the #1 performing sector in the stock market this year and its going higher. There's not enough supply and demand is increasing - simple as that. Im invested in #FANG (+23%), #PXD ( +18%), AND #COP (+15%) in the past TWO WEEKS. These are three of the best oil plays and they're going to go a lot higher bc oil company's are not drilling for more oil; keeping the supply down. They are taking the massive profits and buying back billions of dollars of stock; further causing their share prices to skyrocket. By the way - inflation is good for oil stocks. Cheers!"
"Oil demand is recovering faster than previously expected, and unless OPEC+ puts additional barrels on the market on top of the plans to restore 2 million barrels per day (bpd) by July, oil prices will be heading higher as the gap will widen, the Executive Director of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, told Bloomberg Television in an interview on Tuesday.. $ENB $COP $BP $OXY $CNQ $SU"
"So weird, COP is profitable, just paid dividend, Vaccine going to be released in days, not sure why this is draining lower."
Everyone in the world is realizing that $CVX $XOM $BP $COP and others are vital for the next 10 to 20 years. Where does $CVX go in the next 12 months? Back to 130s?
Buying more COP tomorrow at the open. Holding 3k+ but I think it will be a home run on May 1st. Disappointed that it is under 60 considering WTI over 66. What do you guys think?
Only pure play oil stock with superb balance sheet. Cops money printing presses running non stop as it doesn't hedge. Gonna be blockbuster..shorts will be caught flat footed. I will buy
listening to business news a tv analyst said figuring in inflation and the fact oil was over 100 back in 2008 oil could run to 230 a barrel in todays world without disrupting the economy or running into price destruction if big oil can keep from over producing stock could run for a long time by the time we get to all electric cars on the road they will have flying cars and daily flights into space using what we saved on all electric cars and there is always bitcoin mining that requires lots of energy

The new American leadership is so smart. Asking OPEC+ to produce more oil and reducing American oil production. Climate Change. How rediculous is that. Tells you something about his political party.
"OPEC+ abandoned its meeting without a deal, tipping the cartel into crisis and leaving the oil market facing tight supplies and rising prices.Several days of tense talks failed to resolve a bitter dispute between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, delegates said, asking not to be named because the information wasn’t public. The group didn’t agree on a date for its next meeting, according to a statement from OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo.The most immediate effect of the breakdown is that, unless an agreement can be salvaged, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies won’t increase production for August. That will deprive the global economy of vital extra supplies as demand recovers rapidly from the coronavirus pandemic.$SU $CNQ $ENB $COP $BP $OXY $VET $XOM $TOT $CVX $MPC $EOG $CLR $EPD $PTR $PBR $E $KMI $ET $ARX"
Oil stock selloff couldn't be more misguided today. OPEC + will not open the spigots full on Thurs and Oil will continue north of 70 all summer giving COP and others license to print money
Average earnings increased from 84 cents to 90 cents and yearly expected high increased from $79.00 to 79.94 today on Yahoo Finance.
"Howard Marks discusses second level thinking in his great book The Most Important Thing. With the hoopla surrounding Engine 1 getting two board members elected to XOM board first level thinking seems to say this is bad for Big Oil. But, second level thinking might look at this and say this is another step to constraining supply and oil prices will rise more than expected in the future."
"News just out on ConocoPhillips buying all Shell's Permian Basin production of 175k/day. That's about $4.5B in revs per yr, nice buy. GLTA!"
Bought 2000 shares at 34.9. Oil demand should be going up with vaccine approval soon by Pfizer.

Buy the next dip -- these stocks always relax a bit after a good run.
"New here so I apologize in advance if my question is repetitive. Long time share holder as is most my family. Now I’m in a position to invest 10k more. I missed the extreme low a month or more ago. Does anyone else feel that it is overvalued at this time? Do we see a significant drop in the coming quarter? Should of could of would ofs I know. But I like everyone else I’m sure, rather buy more in the high 20s, or low 30s. It just seems to me it’s priced a bit high. I know the cut cost right away and have nearly no debt I believe, but still seems that the share price isn’t quite accurate for the time being. Thoughts? Also I feel this will go upward above $65 again and possibly pushing the 90s. In time. Any thoughts on that?"
"Looks like my Jan$67.50 CC will hold. Now I can wait till it climbs a bit, and write another for ~70, 72. This is the third CC I've written, all expired. Mostly LEAPS. This last had an effective APY of 5%. Not too shabby. I do this to augment the lame <2% yield, after multiyear freeze. Unacceptable when I have CVX and XOM paying >4%. I'm not dogging COP, I have made great total return since my buy, but divs are my paycheck in early retirement, and utes and commodities need to have >4% yields...it's available everywhere, even in this hightened overall market."
This will move up to $70 later this year as COP will be making huge profits the next 3 quarters as they are now able to make a profit at roughly $28 a barrel.
Anyone look at the historical chart and see a huge opportunity to short COP once its traded above $70 for a period of time? It has traditionally sold off quite significantly after trading at these levels. Thoughts?
Lets hope in 2021 that life returns to normal. Im thinking the pent up demand for travel is huge right now. So with that said im thinking oil is going up to at least 55 a barrel in the next few months. So if COP is able to obtain oil for about 30 a barrel can you imagine what earnings will be in 2021?
"I too believe that out of all the big oil companies....XOM, CVX, COP, BP, etc....COP has the most upside, best positioned, financially secure of these companies. However; still too expensive and overpriced at this stage of recovery. My personal target is $35 and under for the long haul"
COP is holding up well considering that a barrel of oil is soon going to be cheaper than a Big Mac
"On the earnings call, executives said that they didn't lock into the low rates, so as rates are rising now, COP is capturing all of the gain."
COP discovers gas in the North and the stock does not go up. Jed Clampet would be confused.
"Here's a little food for thought about the price of oil. Several years back, oil demand was outpacing supply and oil rose to over $100 per barrel. Some oilmen got innovative and started fracking shale and producing oil from it. Lots of it. And at $100 per barrel it was profitable. Then supply outstripped demand. Way outstripped demand. Prices dropped. So the question I have is what is the breakeven cost of this shale oil production that has shifted our oil price paradigm. I looked at the performance of two outfits that produce primarily from shale . . . Oasis (OAS) and Whiting (WLL). Looking at their earnings (or losses) over the past six quarters and the average WTI price over those quarters one can readily see that OAS requires about $60 WTI to breakeven and WLL requires about $63. IF this is truly reflective of the breakeven for this shale production, doesn't that mean that it will start dropping out until WTI is $70 or so, where COP can earn $1.50 per quarter and at a P/E of 15 (I mean a REAL P/E, not one of them Mickey Mouse ones) the share price would be about $90?"
"Blackstone Inc. co-founder Stephen Schwarzman said the world is facing energy shortages so severe they could cause social unrest.His comments were echoed by Larry Fink, who said there’s a high probability of oil soon reaching $100 a barrel, especially with many governments and investors pushing back against investments in fossil fuels.“Inflation, we are in a new regime,” said Fink, chairman of BlackRock Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager.“There are many structural reasons for that. Short term policy related to environmentalism, in terms of restricting supply of hydrocarbons, has created energy inflation and we are going to be living with that for some time.”Several analysts have said that European countries could halt gas exports to neighbors if winter’s colder than normal and prices keep rising.$SU $CNQ $ENB $COP $BP $OXY $VET $XOM $TOT $CVX $MPC $EOG $CLR $EPD $E $KMI $PSX $HAL $PTR $SNP $WMB $BKR $EC $IMO $CQP $MMP $TRP $XOG"
I find its beyond amazing the lengths G20 leaders will go to force their failed attempts to control the climate.
"I love the CEO ,getting on CNBC ,stated that they would make money @ 20 a barrel,........that is stout ,the reason is they have no debt to pay banks !!!!!"
Just spent $52.00 to fill up my sedan with gas. It was fun.Fortunately I only have to do that once a month.I am making up for the higher cost of gas by owning ConocoPhillips Stock.
Everyone is rolling out of the overpriced tech sector into dividend-paying stocks with price upside. With oil poised to hit $100/bbl next year now is the time to get ahead of the game.https://www.worldoil.com/news/2021/6/21/bank-of-america-projects-2022-oil-prices-near-100-on-growing-travel-demand
Isn't COP leadership great. While other oil makers bend to the political CO2 witch hunt COP grows. The political stupidity in Europe is coming back to haunt them with high energy prices and lower living standers.
10% beat on eps and all we get is a <1% move in share price. the market does not love oil stocks. let's hope the earnings call this afternoon can deliver some more upside.

Climbing to green today? Amazing stock considering the current environment. I almost bought Chevron and I am really glad I bought COP instead. It is good to know the temporary oil price drops do not effect this stock.
"Anyone know what is moving oil stocks up sharply today? Is this normal to move inverse of oil price? When WTI hit 17.31 (down 16% this morning) COP was up 10%. I sold out at 33 and change fearing COP would pullback when oil gets to $10 or even lower. It's up to $35 now! I only recently started following this stock and made the invalid assumption that COP, CVX, etc would somewhat track oil based on some reading and other posters. Anyone have insight on how COP typically moves based on oil price? If oil only goes down to 12-15 will it move COP into high 40s? Any advice appreciated. I may buy back in if not too late for what looks like a really strong run for oil stocks!!"
Why can't independent oil companies agree to control production so they can get a profitable price? I suppose OPEC members are the only smart ones.
$70 incoming
Thank you Shell for giving COP a great deal soon giving a ROI OF nearly 50% annually. Sorry Shell shareholders for your loss of soon to be over $4 billion annually.
Do you think the Permian.biy is a good deal for you guys? I own Shell. I suspect the decision was a strategic one by Shell. Do you know what the break even was/is?
We are setting up for 70.00 oil by the end of the year with all the cuts in production worldwide. As things reopen huge demand on the way. Then $60 to $65 for COP BY END OF 2020.

Now that COP has merged with CXO; should it mean COP is more valuable now than it was; in theory ?
A gift at this valuation. The EV promise is a decade early.
"J.P. Morgan analyst Phil Gresh analyzed cash flow for major oil companies with Brent oil at $30 per barrel. Of 10 North American integrated oil companies—generally larger producers that also conduct operations like refining—five have positive free cash flow with oil at $30 a barrel, and none would be able to fully fund their dividends without using balance sheet cash, taking on debt, or selling assets. The ones in the “best” shape include Chevron (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP)."
"If the lowest analyst's estimate is $70, why is this stock trading at $63 and change after this earnings beat?"
Goldman Sachs downgraded stock to neutral. Who cares what they say. They just want to line their own pockets like most investment banks. They could care less about the average investor
"Was anybody out here formerly a Concho holder? After what has unfolded, I can't believe CXO management panicked and soldout at the bottom!! I bought MRO @ $4 and OXY @ $10 within a few days of the COP merger announcement and both tripled off the low. With prime Permian assets, CXO would have recovered to $100-$120 by now but instead we're stuck with this dog COP. Geezzz...once again wacked by bone-headed management!!"
I feel that Chevron will make an offer to acquire COP at some time in the not so distant future. My reasoning is as follows:COP split off downstream a few years ago.COP sold off its UK assets a few months ago making it a more attractive morsel.There would be buyers for its Norway assets (Statoil or Total) making it very attractive.Occidental showed Chevron how to raise money by selling off a target's unwanted assets when it pre-soldAnadarko's unwanted assets to Total for mainly cash.Chevron is in the market to buy production as shown by its recent offer to buy Anadarko.
"I don’t know if buying right now before the market closes, I should’ve bought yesterday was about to pull the trigger but expected lower oil prices to have an impact in the price, I was right on that but no one expected that “new treatment” and Trump announcement for opening the economy"
"In at 33.69, seems like a solid buy with a good dividend. Think I will hold over the long-term.Kevin"
"Discussion: Now that it’s finally trending as predicted, what would a good price target be for adding to position? Former EE - I’ve been long in COP for 20+ year’s - held when all my friends jumped because of the good divy and knew we would be where we are now - wish I had the guts to add a bunch more few months back. Any seasoned analyst type folks here have an opinion for an old guy amateur? If I had $50k I was looking to reallocate somewhere for a couple years, is it too late to get in heavier on this ride, or is there another sector y’all think is the new “current” buy now hold long? There are some sharp peeps here on this board whose insights I’ve enjoyed reading over the years."
"Hmmm, not too bad of a report today. Despite various divestures and concerns about contracting oil demand this year, COP's oil output/sales increased. As such, earnings were 0.82 cents/share, beating the analyst consensus by 13%. They have clearly held and even increased their market share. 750M more put into buybacks as well, as expected. With the average prices this past quarter, that's about 14M shares repurchased or 1.25% of the company. Will be interested to see how their new Alaskan exploration projects go."

nice pop in the Energy sector
"COP is amazing stock. 10bn cash, almost no current debt. Cash covers a lot of long term debt. So, excellent balance sheet, not a lot of risk here. Excellent position to buy Distressed assets and grow in the future.Buy on dips when the market index is under selling pressure."
Does anyone know how COP determines the stock price for the DRIP purchase?
"Oh oh, looks like it's starting to run out of gas (no pun intended). Maybe it's time to sell some options. What do you think?"
I added 20 shares recently. Hope this rebounds nicely in a year or so !

I raise COP's target price of $80 this year.
Texas and supply. Going to 70 bucks a barrel. Just on two television stations. I can see conoco at 60 for a short time until correction
Nice to hold a stock a lot of people want for a change... Hope it continues for about 5 years and OPEC doesn't mess it all up..
"Talking about fake news, how about on Global warming and climate change. Who's in charge? Follow the money. It talks. There is way too much money vested in Climate Change for Politicians and so called scientist to back up and earnestly study the facts (""do diligence"") and then accept the reality that CO2 is good for the planet and mankind. The whole planet and its life cycle, every living thing depend on CO2. CO2 0.04% could double and the result would be a greener planet and healthier people."
I am considering buying a large amount of share in COP. Can anyone tell me your opinion about the company. I am willing and able to hold it for 3 years.
"Fossil fuels will be needed for the foreseeable future and there are is no new infrastructure being permitted, nor is there any increasing exploration because companies like COP are now more focused on maximizing existing assets and returning $ to shareholders. So M&A is the path forward as COP has provenThe Concho was huge, plus the recent Shell Permian Basin assets buy out will also pay big dividends.Strong hold."
Dividend just got increased.
Opened a long put position today. The historical pattern on the stock shows a peak between 75-85 and then a hard crash over the course of a year. Jan 2024 Put @ $30 should print $$. You are welcome
"I am still thinking this is a $60 stock easy in 6 months, so setbacks are fine. I buy. Strong company, good financials, a product that the whole world will need en masse, and well, a history of being well managed. Maybe it does not hit $66, but I am in for 30% gains and will be fine waiting. Buy on dips."
Buy backs.upgrades everywhere.cop.being a dog lately.Don't understand.world would not exist right now without oil.Wall street just don't get it.they want overpriced tech stocks.
"the boost in the price is certainly aided by the 50 day moving aver. crossing back over the 200 day aver. in dec. - the ""golden cross "" . always a positive forecaster for higher prices ."
Ryan Lance views cash paid to shareholders are wasted money. Buying back stock never really does anything for a stock price because in the end other variables wash out the effect of the buyback. Do you want to see COP's share price jump? Rather than squandering $3.5 billion propping up an overpriced stock pay the cash out as a special dividend and announce all end of the day free cash flow will be paid out as special dividends in the future. Ryan Lance does not have the strategic vision needed to get COP out of the hole he helped put it in by spinning off PSX. There is also a disconnect between COP analysts and reality. This is not a $78 stock. These may not be the best of times in the oil patch but they aren't bad and COP shareholders are stuck with a plummeting stock price and a punk dividend. We are standing around waiting to get bowled over by $30 oil.
"The cartel is on our side. Even though Saudi Arabia has one of the lowest oil production costs, their fiscal breakeven price is much higher since they need approximately $83.60 oil for a balanced budget. This is further proven by the fact that Saudi Arabia lost an estimated $12 billion in April 2020 compared to the previous year as a result of depressed prices .$SU $OXY $CNQ $ENB $COP $BP"
"""Even if Iran is able to add to global supply, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) still feels confident about the oil market.""

still going to 100 at this rate buy on dips
in regards to balance sheet - still the healthiest compared to Exxon and Chevron.
Chances of collecting the $2B from Venezuela?
"I'm reposting Jim's post from the SU conversation. It is extremely interesting to understanding the price movement in oil yesterday:$SU conversationShort data: March18 ,2021Today, Short sellers employed all of their tools in order to bring oil stocks and future contracts down.After failing to create a sell off in oil stocks ,they started to shorting April and May contacts for future oil.They brought WTI to 59$ from 64$.Biggest single drop since April2020.As you see in below data, compare to share price drop, the volume was extremely low.This volume does not match with share price drop.That was just a pure and irresponsible manipulation.Most media in the World censored this extraordinary event in capital market.We are talking about tens of Billions of $ contracts and options which they are trying to kill them, plus covering their short position with creating fake sell off(scaring shareholders).So far, we haven’t had sell off.Low volume.They prefer spent and burn few billion dollars and sell stocks at discount, but meanwhile save tens of billions of money in other side.Extreme and irresponsible manipulation which will have consequences in future of oil market ,especially in next OPEC+ meeting and their next policy.Explanation about below data:Vol: The total volume numbers of first hand shares which is coming into market for trading.It is different than total volume that you see in yahoo or elsewhere.Because in total volume one share can change many hands between traders.But original amount of coming shares and shorted shares are constant for day.For Canadian Stocks the volume is just for US market.SU : (Vol 2.326M shares), (Short 0.769M shares ), (33% of coming shares for trade)SU :XOM (Vol 12M ), (Short 5.715M ), (48% )CLR (Vol 1.129M ), (Short 0.703M ), (63% )CVX (Vol 3.363M ), (Short 1.784M ), (53% )OXY (Vol 8.277M ), (Short 5.32M ), (64% )CPG (Vol 0.693M ), (Short 0.314M ), (45% )CNQ (Vol 0.664M ), (Short 0.217M ), (33% )ENB (Vol 0.885M ), (Short 0.57M ), (64% )BP (Vol 3.458M ), (Short 1.265M ), (37% )CVE (Vol 1.543M ), (Short 0.978M ), (64% )CDEV (Vol 7.627M ), (Short 4.025M ), (53% )FANG (Vol 1.087M ), (Short 0.505M ), (47% )CPE (Vol 1.615M ), (Short 0.697M ), (43% )MRO (Vol 10.09M ), (Short 5.662M ), (56% )SLB (Vol 4.484M ), (Short 1.632M ), (36% )HAL (Vol 2.948M ), (Short 0.971M ), (33% )RIG (Vol 12.58M ), (Short 7.285M ), (58% )TOT (Vol 0.553M ), (Short 0.378M ), (68% )PXD (Vol 0.859M ), (Short 0.51M ), (60% )COP (Vol 2.865M ), (Short 0.808M ), (28% )BKR (Vol 1.79M ), (Short 0.659M ), (37% )LPI (Vol 0.417M ), (Short 0.181M ), (44% )PDS (Vol 0.054M ), (Short 0.02M ), (38% )#XOM, #CLR , #CVX , #OXY , #CPG , #CNQ , #ENB , #BP , #CVE , #CDEV , #FANG , #CPE, #MRO , #SLB, #HAL, #RIG , #TOT, #PXD , #COP, #BKR , #LPI , #PDS"
