"This whole scenario smells. Why sign up for a transaction that craters price and enterprise value 20+%? Shows negligence and a total disregard for shareholders. The pipelines were fully subscribed in a booming market. This reverse-merger move makes no sense whatsoever, except for the insiders. Let's see who files the first lawsuit on this. Apache is so shady."
From the earnings report bullet points - $1.50 QUARTERLY DIVIDEND beginning March 2021!!!!!!!JV pipelines and improvement in G&P business drive results;Continued focus on costs leads to fifth consecutive quarter of lower operating expenses; andPlan to recommend to the board of directors a quarterly dividend of $1.50 per share beginning in March 2021.
Just read through the 8-k. They make a pretty compelling argument for the combination. The assets of the two companies seem to fit like a glove.
"Thankfully, the selling on this type of news usually goes too far.Once the air clears and people calm down to assess things, the stock usually recovers some of its losses."
This is trading like a Tech Stock
"WTI Oil is at multi year high, pipeline volumes should be great, this is definitely worth buying more while the share price is still low for a great yield. My retirement possibilities looking better all the time. Yahoo!!!"
This may trade above $30 today.... There's no way to short this. :-/

Did they do away with the dividend? If not I don't really care
"Hard to believe at this price it is still a high yielding stock, and has room to run. One of my favorite stocks ever."
"""Of note, Permian Highway Pipeline now has an electronic bulletin board, and NGI has begun to see next-day deals referencing Permian Highway at both ends of the pipeline. This indicates that the 2.1 Bcf/d is nearing in-service.""https://www.naturalgasintel.com/november-natural-gas-bidweek-prices-post-massive-gains-as-lng-demand-roars-back/"
Is it even legal for a Board of Directors to approve a deal that destroys over 30% of retail shareholder value overnight?
The Piper finally came due....the suits running this place couldn't financially or with smoke and mirrors show any growth and Apache just wanted out. That's why this occurred. Further proof you actually need to know what you are doing in a company when the hype stops and euphoric valuations are a thing of the past. The upside is this company might actually now be worth something after this heavy dose of medicine is digested.
"That after hr.s action looks good, we may hit a new 52 wk. high Monday. $72.69 after hr.s, oil and gas still heading up, that will get pipeline volumes up too. Yahoo!!"
"Higher gas prices will lead to greater throughputs and greater profits and cash flows, higher asset values. At $16 altm is .80 on the old stock. It will go back to $10 on the old or $200 in today’s shares. .you can quote me."
"I see no reason share price won't continue up until closely matches other dividend favorites like oke,xom,cvx,and vlo. That would put well over the $100 mark. YAHOO!!!"
"Can someone Explain this and Why APA never says a word about It? Apache’s presence in the Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico includes fee acreage in southern Louisiana and interest in deepwater exploration and development. In the Gulf of Mexico, the company has interest in several deepwater exploration and development offshore leases. In 2013, when the company sold substantially all of its offshore assets in water depths less than 1,000 feet, it retained a 50% ownership interest in deeper targets and access to existing infrastructure, providing future optionality."
Nice move today. Anyone got any thoughts?
"I've been taking advantage of the dip, cash flow is there, coverage still great, company grew assets, via merger. Dividend to remain the same and is still very safe. We just got an opportunity to buy more shares at an even larger discount, as the size of the company grew significantly, and the dividends remain in tact and coverage is still way above needed level. Still plenty of profits to grow a little more."
How has your day been ?Big drop. Ouch. Not good for shareholders
"ALTM was trading at this price before October. I suspect people were looking for a buy-out from APA at a premium price? There would be some rationale as APA making gobs of free cash flow and buying minority even at $100/share would make sense. But instead APA decided to dilute its stranglehold and become a minority investor - which makes sense for APA shareholders too. With $6/share dividend looking safe looks like a solid buy for income. I own APA and not ALTM, but may add ATLM as income vehicle."
"This is an MLP, correct? Trying to avoid K-1's..."
"Looks like they gave away the farm today. I do not understand why. Apparently insiders knew this was about to go down, I was getting high returns from fully paid lending."
Biden admin wants to raise taxes on natural gas. How will that effect ALTM stock ?
"not a day trader and this is more or less flat since May...... hmmmm up 60%, time to cash in?"
"Yikes! listening to webcast now and presentation, going to take a while to re-evaluate this like I did when it first went public."
ALTM reached a 52 Week high at 89.50
ALTM is up 7.96% to 66.87
How much of ALTM does Apache own? Thanks in advance
ALTM is down 7.06% to 63.21
ALTM reached a 52 Week high at 86.97
16 million shares currently outstanding. Add 50 million per release. 66 million shares for new ALTM (or whatever they call it) upon closure.$9 Billion projected value per release (inclusive of debt) / 66 million shares= $136 / ShareSo why are we dropping? What's wrong with my math?
"Personally I'm not really mad about a 8.8% dividend in a growing and vital company. I would have liked to see the company pledge to increase that dividend in '22 vs '23, but hey....I can live with the pain."
ALTM is up 7.34% to 66.10
ALTM is down 5.59% to 80.12
"Eagleclaw is effectively doing their own IPO with this transaction. Apache haters should like this, they are no longer in charge. The numbers they project look good, but cant tell much about them since they are a private company."
"My guess is that some of the people receiving the class C shares are selling short ALTM (class A shares) to lock-in profits, since their shares are restricted for 12 months after transaction closes? I don't like the fact that there is no possibility of a dividend increase until 2024.Wonder why they didn't wait and announce merger with 3rd quarter earnings release?"
$6 equates to 12pct / year at stock price of $50; 15pct /year at $40.Simple math !
"Bought this several months ago for the yield and forgot about it, can someone share a reason for the Hyperbolic move? Only serious input please (LIke, More buyers then sellers!)"
The BoD and Corporate Officers making $bank$.So what's the problem?Stop complaining.
