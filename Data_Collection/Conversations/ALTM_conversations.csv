ALTM is down 5.73% to 63.78
"I've had great faith in ALTM until recently. Thought servicing APA was a good backdrop going forward. Maybe future company prospects are still good but right now ... I'm in favor of complete new mgmt at the top. I suppose that would mean a buy-out by another company, which may mean APA would be the maim buy-out candidate. That suits me fine, too. The sooner the better before all is lost."
"ALTM ........... the Name of the Game is the Same ......... Buy, Accumulate, Hold. Your reward comes in 6-24 mos. That being 2-3-4X up from $3 and a dividend. Please let us know if you have something better and surer. Thanks."
"last day to get the dividend, goes ex tomorrow."
I agree that someplace between $9-10 is reasonable in that time frame.
Okay folks..... Let's see if this crosses 50 tomorrow. Sleep tight.
"Jimmy says ""When on earth will we see $10"" Shareholders got snookered in this deal !!"
A $6 yearly dividend- 12% yield at current price! Whoo hoo!
What if this trades up to $50?????
this gift just keeps on giving!
"Buying more today under $5.00, I will keep buying if it keep dropping!"
"Can’t link to it but RBN Energy blog had a write up on NG gas pipelines in the Permian today and discussed PHP & GCX. Said PHP will likely go in service late this year2020 instead of 1Q 2021. RBN is definitely in the know, so we may see some revenue booked from PHP in 4Q."
I guess we will see if insiders step up. Could be telling if they don't unless it's a quiet period. 48 cents?
More insider buy hit tonite. Looks like Bretches for another 20k. Seems he is only insider that ever buys.
altm just completed the purchase into shin oaks pipeline. with this purchase and new expansion coming in the third quarter revenue should start to increase substantially in quarter three
That was some really interesting heavy volume and upward price action at the close today.
Hard to understand how people allow this stock to trade at or below $54. The market has already determined the price around the time of dividend is around $59-$60. Not much risk of that changing. Only predictable change will be the upside price trickling up toward $65. So buying around $54 gives you a virtually guarantee 10% in 45 days.
"This should be a positive for ALTM earnings also since they own a 16% share in this pipeline.(Reuters) - U.S. pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc reported a 26% rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, benefiting from higher gas takeaway from Permian Basin through its Gulf Coast Express pipeline.The pipeline, which can transport 2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), came into service in September last year when drillers were burning off natural gas at record rates due to lack of transportation capacity from the shale-rich Permian Basin.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kinder-morgan-profit-jumps-26-210725721.html"
huge volume today
Pure manipulation!!!!!!Only 2M or so shares float so not much to move it around!!GLTA in stock casino!
This may trade above $30 today.... There's no way to short this. :-/
Probably will be down tomorrow. I personally wished I had bought more than the 5k shares I grabbed after the reverse split. Dividend yield stocks will be in demand in a zero interest rate environment. A 30$ stock yielding 6$ a year in dividends are hard to find short of REITs. They pipe mainly natural gas which is not going away anytime soon like petroleum distillates.
This stock up over 300% since November. Can it continue ?
"According to an article from October 23 on the Permian Highway Pipeline website, 100% of the pipe is in the ground and only cosmetic rehab work is being done. The article ends by quoting pipeline opponents as saying they lost the battle, but have effectively prevented other pipelines from crossing the area. So, basically the pipe is done and the income is on the way."
"You have follow apa and review their results to see why the drop here. The plan to shell out 22% less, which explains the haircut."
"not a day trader and this is more or less flat since May...... hmmmm up 60%, time to cash in?"
"Almost back to all-time lows, and down -7.4% on a day natural gas is +2%? What gives?"
Cant believe I sold some on the way up. oh well... who am I to complain about this beast?
"I hate to bring this up, but I am assuming that the real reason for the reverse split is the need to raise additional capital through a share offering. As El Tigre posted that an additional $45.39 million may be necessary as the project budget has increased from $2.1 Billion to $2.27 Billion and the uncertainties with the oil/NG business going forward, ALTM may want to de-risk its business. I would like to hear the Opinions/thoughts from the more knowledgeable posters on this board. I would really appreciate it. Thank you in advance.Best Regards,Simon"
Filed for a 1:20 reverse split. Toast.
"First Cryo plant announced open, a little income starting to come in! Earnings should start to improve and grow"
Great medium/long-term stock holding. Dividend coming in 12-24 mos. Great future unless oil mkt or economy goes deep south.
"Wow, been waiting for a 2.x number. At least now its because the whole permian is being destroyed, its not company specific so much. A bit of guidance came down in earnings call, but generally heading lower because the permian has gone up in smoke the last weeks."
"Some Positives might be worth reviewing - They are in the last leg of the build out and KMI is building the Permian Pipeline right now. Without Permmian, EBITDA in 2020 was projected to be in the 200 M range with 100 M of DCF. 2021 will likely start the dividends promised since inception as the build out of the Permian will be done early 2021. Even given recent analyst adjustments to the general demand crunch due to the oil mess going forward, there should be significant EBITDA and DCF increases in 2021 as well when the PHP is completed with minimum revenue guarantees. The promised dividends are only payable to the class A shares, and not the Class C that Apache holds, so giving shareholders a significant bone would be fairly inexpensive and would leave plenty to pay down debt or retire Preferred shares. It's priced like it's going BK but I don't think that's in the cards. Someone mentioned a $5 breakup value. I'd like to hear more about that view. What else is positive about Altus?"
Alpine High production back on according to APA release today. Good news.
"More ""profit taking"" today ?"
"Very interesting company, on my watch list. I think it's about fairly valued right now; should not go down much more, but if it does its a great opportunity. All of the Permain plays are taking it on the chin right now. In a year or so when this starts to pay a dividend I hope it's still at this price."
"2 large blocks traded today, 1 for $1M shares and a 2nd for $2.5M shares. Get you seatbelts on.."
"Permian production growth slowing just as all the new pipelines come online, and ALTM set new lows on two consecutive days. Should rethink my $1.95 GTC order, but I won't. Just fifteen cents away at the low today."
"Sierra club denied in court, pipeline goes thru as planned"
"Ok, this needs reach to 160 for its IPO price of not that long ago. Wake me up when it reaches even one fourth of it. Simply put, worth investment after a couple of others which went BK due to Covid. But this one doesn't have Covid excuses!"
"After muting Sammie, this board is pretty dead, but at least I don't have to read his pumping posts on all the boards I get on."
"EPIC Crude Holdings, LP (“EPIC Crude”) was formed in 2017 to build and operate the EPIC Crude Oil Pipeline, a 700-mile, 30” crude oil pipeline which will extend from Orla, Texas to the Port of Corpus Christi, Texas, servicing the Delaware, Midland and Eagle Ford Basins. The mainline is expected to be complete in January 2020 and will have an initial capacity of 600,000 barrels of oil per day, with throughput anticipated to begin ramping up during the first quarter of 2020. EPIC Crude will have approximately 7.5 MM barrels of storage across the system. EPIC Crude is backed by capital commitments from funds managed by the Private Equity Group of Ares Management Corporation as well as additional equity ownership by Noble Midstream Partners, L.P.

Time to average down. I started at $3.35 and $3.13. Plan to pick up some in the 2's
Somebody likes ALTM because on Friday they put an order in for millions of shares to be bought until filled. Drove price up and up until weak hands started bailing. New up trend will start sooner or later.

"CEO Clay Bretches made a small purchase today bringing his total shares owned to 18,114. SEC Filing after the bell."
"I read KMI's response to the Sierra Club lawsuit from that law360 posting below. It sounds like the project budget has increased from $2.1 billion to $2.27 billion which would mean an additional $45.39 million investment net to ALTM's interest (that's over 20% of the company's market cap). It sounds like they are going to try and reroute a portion of the pipeline to go around two Blanco river crossings, but are first evaluating that with the Army Corps / US Fish & Wildlife Service. Makes sense but wondering if they have an alternative after drilling into that karst on the first attempt at Blanco, which is now subject to a separate lawsuit."
"Construction resumes at Kinder Morgan pipeline after suspicious packageSep. 2, 2020 2:34 PM ET|About: Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI)|By: Carl Surran, SA News Editor Kinder Morgan (KMI -0.3%) resumes construction of the Permian Highway natural gas pipeline in Texas, after authorities investigate a suspicious package found at the site yesterday.A Texas Department of Public Safety spokesperson says a bomb squad neutralized the suspicious device but offered no additional information.The $2.3B Permian Highway pipeline, which is ~90% complete, will transport gas through 428 miles from the Waha, Tex., area to the Gulf Coast and Mexico markets.The pipeline will carry up to 2.1B cf/day of natural gas and is owned by Kinder Morgan, Exxon Mobil (XOM -0.7%), Altus Midstream (ALTM +4.3%) and Blackstone's (BX +1.2%) EagleClaw Midstream Ventures."
SHORT SQUEEZE for sure!!!!!!
"Hard to believe at this price it is still a high yielding stock, and has room to run. One of my favorite stocks ever."
"Altus Midstream is in a good position to navigate the current market situation. We have a diverse cash flow stream from a portfolio of G&P and long-haul pipeline assets, no upcoming debt maturities, and ample liquidity to meet foreseeable investment needs with a revolver that extends through 2023,” said Clay BretchesAccording to the CEO, sounds like everything is rosy...then, there is NO NEED for a reverse split. It’s a scam being sold under a regulatory ruse. Are these guys Greek shippers disguised as Texas oilmen?"
"Big day but low volume. I sold at 38.02 looking for a pullback. Wished I had held a couple days longer. That said, I’m not convinced at these volumes that the upward price action is sustainable."
"A 2 Million share trade appears at 12:54 EST, looks interesting..."
I’m thinking a good entry point is $8.50-$9.25 range
Biden admin wants to raise taxes on natural gas. How will that effect ALTM stock ?

Kinder Morgan (KMI) is actually +30% this year. They should buy ALTM out.
Forget Oil and Gas on this one. It is just as good buying some water ( WTER) for the price of a McDs coffee at $1.40 !Atleast that may double while we wait.
"I think this will close near $30 today. Be careful, this is a short seller trap."
Will this stock pay a dividend?

Going much higher.

How much of ALTM does Apache own? Thanks in advance
ALTM is down 11.11% to 1.44

"Higher gas prices will lead to greater throughputs and greater profits and cash flows, higher asset values. At $16 altm is .80 on the old stock. It will go back to $10 on the old or $200 in today’s shares. .you can quote me."

"I'm staying Long ALTM. May get a share price drop on the reverse split, but will be partially offset afterwards by Fund Managers being able to finally buy in due to price being within their covenants now. Dividend should kick in next year and this will be a solid stock to own in my opinion."
"Market cap is $1.3b. It has had to borrow or do preferred equity raises to excersze its pipeline options, it does not seemed to have gotten a lot of cash from Apache or Kayne when this company was created. Institutions seem to own most all of the stock that trades (outside of what Apache owns). Cant wait till this knife stops falling and see some form of a base, but it should take some time because people who buy this kind of stock tend to like dividends, and that is probably in 2021. Apache not going to be very active until they can get better prices. Building a company from nothing takes a lot of work and ALTM has lots of headwinds."
"Well, it may be a pyrrhic victory, but it is nice to see. Maybe if it goes up about 500% from here I'll get back to break-even.... lol"
another rise is short sales on the stock corresponds with the falling price. some positive news from china in trade negotiations should help oil and gas stocks and eventually altm
Good earnings report or not?
Andarko was bought last week at huge premium; next on the auction block APA which owns 78pct of ALTM.... bepatient and hold your positions for a nice premium..who ever buys AP is defacto buying ALTM
"This ruling seems troubling given the multiple lawsuits challenging the Permian Highway Pipeline pending in Austin (and recent similar rulings on Dakota Access Pipeline (already in service) and Keystone XL). One lawsuit (Sierra Club) is challenging the use of NWP 12 for Permian Highway and one lawsuit (City of Austin et al) is challenging the biological opinion and permitting process used to skirted NEPA under the questionable Federal ""Small Handle"" process. I worry the liberal judge in these cases could vacate the Permian Highway permits. Summary judgment motions are before the judge now in the Austin case, and the defending parties even ask the judge in there to consider remand without vacatur if he rules in favor of plaintiffs. Don't like the potential binary outcome there. I'm guessing ALTM's board wants to see the outcome of before approving the dividend, although it could still be a way to move at least some capital to the common away from the preferred I suppose. Seems like PHP is likely fine long term even if they have to reroute again or go through an appeals process, but I don't like the uncertainty given that in my opinion ALTM's equity value is predicated almost entirely on PHP coming online and staying online as anticipated. If this ends up at the Supreme Court I think PHP would prevail and deference would be given to the Army Corps and USFWS. https://www.eenews.net/stories/1063718143"

Announcement of 20 to 1 reverse split is on the way ?
Well guys I see a very bright future here but with market shakeout this morning I had to liquidate my 20k worth as this was one of the few holdings I had that was green. Hated to do it but I had other holdings that dropped 9-10% and couldnt pass up the swing trade. Hope to re-join yall one day soon
ALTM is up 8.60% to 2.71
"I'm relatively new here, just bought some at 53. This stock has some pretty strong price changes. I went to the website to look at the quarterly estimate changes at the Investor tab and did not notice anything terrible yet the price drops like there is."
Stock price manipulation.....usually raises the eyebrows of the SEC.
i thought i was suddenly rich and then i realize i was back to being poor. such is life.
Best day I've ever had in the market.
"52 week high today , should break into USD70+"
"APA has essentially written off Alpine high. A $2.7B write down. Not good news for Altus.""Christmann continued, “Despite steady progress on many fronts in 2019, we also encountered some significant challenges, most notably around deteriorating natural gas and NGL prices and the performance of our multi-well development pad tests at Alpine High. To further align our investment program with these dynamics, we plan to significantly reduce our spending in 2020, predominantly in Alpine High."""
The buying interest is drying up here.
"So they are talking about $6 a year dividend. Any insight? Seems like if that is safe it makes it a pretty easy double from here. Although the phrase, ""If it looks too good to be true, it probably is."" comes to mind."
ALTM reached a 52 Week high at 86.97
Nice move today. Anyone got any thoughts?
Results out after wednesday close. Its behaving like we have a good strong set of results. I notice Clay B upgraded estimates for EBITDA in November when Gas and Oil were way below current MVInteresting to see what it comes to in a little over one day.

BIG DIVIDEND PAYOUT LOOMING....
"Oct 31: Key sentence from Earnings Announcement Presentation:"" .. Continue to be in a position to institute a dividend in 2021 with potential to accelerateto 2020"" There is light at end of the Oil and Gas Pipe !!"
Why is there no conversation on this board???? Did they just announce this dividend for the first time?
"Son I won’t post much more here but I just spoke to investor relations and although they can’t speak o the price fluctuations on a daily or hourly basis, I will give you some quick bullet points for those longs that (or even swing traders that may have been alarmed by today’s fluctuation.1) there has been no more news since yesterday which was very comprehensive.2) Apache owns about 80% of this and of course it is in their vested interest to look after Altus. They are still operating a number of rigs there and elsewhere.3) Altus employees have stock as a big part of their compensation as most companies do, so it is in there vested interest to grow the business.4) the float is very small and can move easily, and not sure why people were selling - NOW, on this point, as I was watching to fill the rest of my investment - noticed a number of 100 share lots that drove the price down which thanks to them I was able to fill 2 more of my big blocks! I was quite surprised that people even buy only 100, but many were probably trades from yesterday or people that just can’t stomach losses. I also feel market makers were dragging it down to fill larger orders.5) for new business which is a big focus, they have boots on the ground working on it.He was very pleasant and also a shareholder and is confident in the companies future. This is not a traders stock, but many do come in for 2-3 days looking for a quick buck and leave, then the price moves up steadily. In my 30 years in the market, seen it 1000 times if not more. Hopefully, the rest of the weak hands get shaken out today, and we are back to where we should be in a day or two. If you don’t sell your shares, the price goes up. Once again thank you to the ones that sold them to me! Good luck all. Have a great weekend, and don’t stress."
I believe this is the first index that ALTM has been added to. That bodes well.

I have been loading on on the cheap shares while they build out the system in the next 18 months knowing when that happens and ALTM starts paying a dividend the stock will sell for $8-11 per share.
"bought more under 64. Finally got to long term cap gains on different position, harvested those and put to work over here. Will be above 70 before the next div and 10% yield while I wait."

"Short interest as of 10/31 will be out on 11/10. It had been increasing a bit over the prior 2-week periods. Real curious to see what it will be as of 11/15. My guess is that the shorts piled on a lot more yesterday and today given that there still won't be dividends for another 5 months or whatever. Most of the short position is probably still in the green given how long it seems to have been in place. Shorts seemed to control the stock prior to yesterday IMO, taking it down at the end of many days. Its funny the value here didn't change from one day to the next. What an interesting example of capital allocation decisions affecting shareholder returns, at least in the short term. Probably not easy for shorts here to sleep well with the dividend potential creeping ever closer."

Very interesting developments.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apache-corporation-names-executive-leadership-211510831.html"
"@ofir I think the pipes with MVC's could fetch at least 13x EBITDA based on market comps. Check out KMI's most recent conference call transcript and recent midstream comps for these types of assets. There seems to be a strong bid for midstream assets with long-term fixed contracts and strong counterparties from PE and foreign buyers in a yield starved environment. So much so that it seems to be impacting KMI's backlog. I think EPIC and Shin Oak would be more in the 10-12x range, but those ought to be growing for a while to come. I think FANG announced on its recent conference call that it would be flowing 80k barrels into EPIC near term, above its 50k capacity. 4Q was bad for EPIC, 1Q should be better, and starting late 1Q the cash should really start to flow from my what I can tell based on the NBLX and RTLR calls and reading what I could find. I think the obligations from partners to ship on that line begin 3/1 and line fill is underway. I don't think the interim service worked out as expected due to the tightening basis differential. I’m seeing 2-3x in a year or so based on the JV pipes alone, and if Altus can fill the Cryos that is gravy from my perspective. I think Alpine High is being heavily discounted already, and ALTM’s CEO acknowledged this on the last call, such that the current guidance for those assets takes a bare minimum view and is extremely conservative. I think there is over $1 billion invested in midstream at Alpine High that also has incredible potential long term, especially once the big new ethylene plants on the gulf coast are running. Hoping ALTM has found a way to fill the excess capacity on the 3 Cryo's, as I calculate they will have at least one spare facility based on the slowdown at Alpine High in response to low gas and ngl prices. Apache secured big takeaway on the GCX and PHP lines in anticipation of much higher gas production at Alpine High which hasn't materialized yet, so hoping they utilize their capacity to attract third-party volumes to keep the Cryos full. Wondering if a deal isn't in the works with ARM / Salt Creek Midstream with respect to that angle, as the Salt Creek NGL option was pushed out from 1/31 to 3/2 per a recent 8k. Seems strange that option would be extended unless something bigger picture is in the works. Interested in any thoughts on valuation and the cryo situation here. Revenue and cash flow for the individual pipelines is broken out in the 10Q now, and I believe KMI mentioned in the recent lawsuit where a judge denied a motion for a temporary restraining order that PHP is expected to generate $33M of monthly revenue. Started a position here recently and I’ve been averaging down hard for me to understand the apparent disconnect. Feels like a waiting game, but it also feels like an inflection point where each quarter should start showing meaningful progress and we get closer to PHP coming online 1H 2020."

"APA has made a significant offshore oil discovery. woohoo.. Great decision to drill offshore, lets see some of that luck used in the Permian,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apache-corporation-total-announce-significant-120010607.html"
ALTM is down 14.41% to 1.01
Altus Midstream is up 6.54% to 56.89
"According to the OK Today website on Tuesday December 8, the Permian Highway pipeline was completed on November 1st and is now fully operational."
no volume... this thing just limping through the desert...
Not doing to great for my short. I got it right at 9:30 hoping for a plumet.
Earnings don't spike over 100 percent.
"Financial Overview14►Altus Midstream’s simple structure is a key point of differentiation No debt and undrawn revolver provide strong liquidity No incentive distribution rights►~$450 million of cash(1) and an undrawn $800 million(2) unsecured credit facility►Altus expects to begin borrowing in 2019 to finance growth ~75% of capital investments in 2019-2020 attributable to JV pipelines►2021 leverage of 3-4x, continue to target lower end►Expect to institute a dividend during 2021 (subject to board approval) Reinvest cash flow through 2020 Expect dividend policy to be similar to high quality midstream peer group►Valuation based on 2021 Adjusted EBITDA(3) attractive relative to high growthmidstream peers 55-65% of 2021 Adjusted EBITDA(3) attributable to JV pipelines"
For a stock to have dropped 65pct in such a short period indicates something major is seen by smart money which has been liquidating. Market has lost confidence in the smart dressing CEO and President. The newly appointed CEO quit in a month...what did he see or did he not see any rainbow at the end. These turkeys are NOT going to pay a dividend until 2021; byt then these two dressers may pocket and salaries and bonuses and take off to other companies !!
"The NAV is there but I do think a significant discount is warranted due to the lawsuit overhang and tiny float. Nice to see the announcement today. It seems like a good move, although I wish they would have repurchased stock first. I think the odds are less than 50%, but if the PHP permits are vacated in the Austin lawsuit for an extended period of time that could essentially wipe out all equity value here. I think it is likely the judge will rule one way or another on summary judgment or set a trial date before the BOD declares a dividend. It sounds like a trial wouldn't be set for 18-24 months from now, so even that might not be the end of the world, and it would allow APA to get a good chunk of cash out of the company through the dividend near term and shift more of that risk to the preferred equity holders. The PHP pipeline is in the ground now, which is good, but the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline rulings scare me, especially given how long it has taken this judge to rule in this lawsuit and the fact that we may be under a new administration for the next four years."
Does anyone know the correlation between the falling gas prices and this stock price. Can this stock continue up if gas starts to fall lower from here?
Altus Midstream expects to institute a dividend during 2021 (subject to board approval) Reinvest cash flow through 2020
Question: How would I go about comparing this investment to DTM? (midstream spin off of DTE that is a C corp). Its market cap is 4X larger... its supposed to pay a dividend but hasn't announced one yet... how else should I compare it?
such a steal. PE below 10 and yield over 9%load the truck
"2021 JV Pipe EBITDA forecast seems pretty light at the midpoint, even assuming PHP doesn't come online until 2Q. Was expecting it to be at least 15% higher curious to hear Ofir's thoughts here. Will be interesting to see the breakdown in the 10Q. It seems they are well above the 7x build multiple and I noticed that tidbit isn't included in the presentation anymore, but I guess COVID is playing a role there with EPIC and Shin Oak and declining Alpine High volumes impacting Shin Oak as well. Maybe they are just being conservative with the guidance."
This Supreme Court review should be quick and easy I think. The Judges decision to vacate Nationwide Permit 12 was weak to begin with and the appeal to the 9th Circuit was the typical political rubber stamp we expect from them. Permian Highway JV pipeline should be back on schedule with a positive ruling by SCOTUS. https://www.seattletimes.com/business/trump-administration-takes-keystone-dispute-to-supreme-court/
Altus Midstream reached a 52 Week high at 54.85
Altus Midstream (NASDAQ: ALTM) has spent the past year quietly building a large-scale midstream business to support the flow of oil and gas out of the Permian Basin. The energy company has been constructing pipelines and processing plants to gather oil and gas from newly drilled wells in...

Wonder if the quarterly report and conference call tomorrow will trigger my $1.95 GTC order. Read an article in today's newspaper a local Texas utility still operating two coal plants plans to solicit bids from solar providers instead of updating or replacing five 45- to 53-year-old natural gas plants.
dividends came hoorah
Natural gas producers and pipelines have been rallying a lot since crude oil has been crashing.Maybe Alpine High will come back in style.
"wow, thanks to the weak hands and stop losses kicking it. now have my full buy filled. people will regret selling cheap. guess we won't see 6.80 today lol! Apart is in the positive and oil has been on the upswing so we should see uptrend over the next few months in a big way. I wouldn't sell your shares cheap people, but thanks to those that did. some swing traders were cashing out before the weekend and theMarket Maker stole their shares."
have they halted trading in the stock? no trades noted for some time. no price change that i could see and volumes remain the same.
Altus Midstream reached an all time low at 0.52
$40 happened so fast I should have put $45..
"Can someone Explain this and Why APA never says a word about It? Apache’s presence in the Gulf Coast and Gulf of Mexico includes fee acreage in southern Louisiana and interest in deepwater exploration and development. In the Gulf of Mexico, the company has interest in several deepwater exploration and development offshore leases. In 2013, when the company sold substantially all of its offshore assets in water depths less than 1,000 feet, it retained a 50% ownership interest in deeper targets and access to existing infrastructure, providing future optionality."
My shares of ALTM and PEYUF are saving this week for me !!
$6 annual dividend can justify a $40 or $50 stock price pretty easily. wow.
"@Assumption88888 You called it - CEO Clay Bretches bought 100,000 shares today @ $0.555 share. He now owns a total of 360,000 shares. Shows a lot of confidence ALTM."
"I did the same, the fact they have options to buy into good projects with little risk is what I liked most about the story."
"WTI Oil is at multi year high, pipeline volumes should be great, this is definitely worth buying more while the share price is still low for a great yield. My retirement possibilities looking better all the time. Yahoo!!!"
"this has very low volume. Not sure how Yahoo gets to 279,000 average shares traded per day. Today's volume was 25K shares which looks more representative, which equates to 0.13% of outstanding shares of 16.25M. Any favorable interest is going to pop the price higher. Hard to see it going lower with a 12% payout."
"Nice action into the closing Friday, expect this will run up to $60 soon with an 12% dividend. What's not to like?"
someone is accumulating. Very small free float of less than 5 m shares. underlying docs on the floatation show issuance of more shares to Apache if the shares go above certain numbers....not a massive dilution but still relevant
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.statesman.com/news/20200518/texas-attorney-general-ken-paxton-challenges-keystone-pipeline-ruling%3ftemplate=ampart
Hopefully today was a big buy in for a guaranteed dividend versus a short cover.
"I now own 2500 shares @ 5.7724. at this time last year I had 29,000 shares of ETP, and my div checks were 16,000.00 plus. I am a big fan of pipelines. I currently own ET and AM as well. I go in and out of MRO and ROYT. Good Luck ALTM and all the shareholders. Peace!"
"Value Hunters are loading up...BUY BUY BUY* HOTCHKIS & WILEY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT LLC REPORTS 10.55% PASSIVE STAKE IN ALTUS MIDSTREAM AS OF NOV 30, 2019 - SEC FILING Source text: (https://bit.ly/38qvTKv)"
From The Hays Free Press a few days ago:(KM VP) Fore said the rest of the route was unaffected and the re-routing was complete in about four weeks. He said all of the pipe is now in the ground and the remaining work above ground consists of restoration efforts like planting grass and fencing.I'm guessing bolt on work is the 1% of the pipeline uncompleted. Nearly a done deal.
not for the faint hearted ...from68++to 62 in 24 hoursit is a buy again
Resolution reached with local authorities regarding the Permian Hwy Pipeline work stoppage due to the recent well contamination incidents. Seems reasonable and not overly draconian. Karst surveys are being done throughout the project route already so should be something KMI can handle easily. https://haysfreepress.com/2020/05/13/county-adopts-policy-for-natural-gas-pipeline-road-crossings/
really low volume today
The newly hired COO took off in less than a month; there is some skel
Power Point presentations are not doing the job; this is a midstream pipe line company and shareholders expect dividends asap.
Clay Bretches filed a Form 4. He just bought shares of ALTM at $1.40. But it doesn't say how many shareshttp://archive.fast-edgar.com//20200302/AGZZ722CZ222G272222N22Z25GBKZN285622/
do you think I should buy and sell around like 35
"This is an MLP, correct? Trying to avoid K-1's..."
$40 coming soon......
"Seems there's a Great White Berkshire shark swimming in the pipeline waters now. At minimum should shine a spotlight on overlooked value of NG pipelines, best outcome could be more M&A deals."
GAS  ers: SUMMIT MIDSTREAM UP 13.43%..IT'S ALL GOOD IN GAS
they stuck a senior preferred in front of was to be a debt free issue stinkin trick Looking to buy more at 2.44 curently in at $4.50 Already down over 2 bucks on a 4 50 investment maybe 2 25 buy ie half my origional price
"Any remaining shorts will have to pay the dividend if they don't cover today - possible squeeze later today, or has that played out all ready? Surprised the short interest is/was that high with a 10-12% dividend yield."
Yeah mabey not today but I think it will go down eventualy and its not real money it is just my 8th grade stock competition.
"Any thoughts on how likely will APA restart drilling at AH? here is a few factors I can think about: * With PHP approaching its starting date, APA need to meet its MVC, APA has reduced some of its obligations through a third party * Drilling at AH become economical with the rise of natural gas price * It seems make no sense to leave large part of AH assets idle with no return. * Can APA afford the CapEx needed to restart AH drilling with its debt situation? how much CapEx is needed, maybe restart at smaller scale to meet MVC first? * How long it takes from start drilling to production? and how much time to get all its investment back for a well?"
"Salt Creek Pipeline update - 8K just filed extending the option to acquire to March 2, 2020."
I think this will drop back below 15 today or tomorrow.
Shorts - get ready for massive squeeze!!! 8 days until announcing!!
Dividend has to get approved yet in a meantime it’s a losing company
"""Of note, Permian Highway Pipeline now has an electronic bulletin board, and NGI has begun to see next-day deals referencing Permian Highway at both ends of the pipeline. This indicates that the 2.1 Bcf/d is nearing in-service.""https://www.naturalgasintel.com/november-natural-gas-bidweek-prices-post-massive-gains-as-lng-demand-roars-back/"
This will soar over the next year as they add pipes and start the dividend
"anybody buying?Kind of aquiet board, falling knife?"
"Hoppes No 9... I just read the announcement from Reuters yesterday. It's pretty amazing ! They said that the Permian Highway Pipe started full operation on January 1st. Kinder Morgan, the operator, said, "" Gas has been flowing for weeks during the Commissioning Process."" Kinder further states the pipe is fully s subscribed on a long term basis. The most amazing item in the article is that they mentioned that since the pipeline started partial service, prices averaged $2.32 per BTU, compared to $1.18 per BTU for all of 2020 !"
ALTM has a > price than APA. Go figure. Wow.
Is the dividend sustainable?
What is anyone's best guess on when dividends will start and what will they be?
"Sold 25pct of my (BIG and heavily losing postion... before this huge jump from $10 area to $33 area) and diversified into EPD, ET ( and a little bit of speculation in MRMD at 0.20 which I feel could be a 4 bagger under Biden/Kamala/Jamaican regime) . Need ALTM to climb to $40 are before I can break even."
"Well, I went ahead an initiated a small position in this name. Not supposed to pay a dividend until perhaps the first quarter of 2021. One estimate I read was for .14 cents a quarter. A long time to hold I guess without being paid, but they will own small parts of good pipes!"
"Jan 28th article in Houston Chronicle - With dedication area agreements for Apache, Altus is obviously booking the G&P and GCX Pipeline revenue for this deal. Have not seen this announced in any previous reports. ”In September, Cheniere announced long-term partnerships with Houston oil companies EOG Resources and Apache Corp. Under the deals, Cheniere buys gas from the two companies at Permian well-head prices, sells the LNG at market price and gives the difference to EOG and Apache. Cheniere profits from its processing and shipping fees.....Cheniere is one of several companies sending much of the Permian’s natural gas through hundreds of miles of new pipelines to Corpus Christi, a major hub for the natural gas business.”https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Cheniere-eyes-LNG-industry-growth-after-1-000th-15011897.php?cmpid=gsa-chron-result"
January 2021 WAHA forward trading strong. Looks like environmentalists still trying to disrupt PHP. This will be a big cash generator for ALTM. Kinder says on schedule.
Anyone heard if they are going to exercise their option on 50% of Salt creek?
Altus Midstream is down 16.57% to 0.58
Gift that keeps on giving... what is future for Altus? Hold?
"The CEO is a smooth talker but does NOT deliver shareholder value;he needs to pass on the baton to someone who can deliver.Disgusting performance since he took over and the oil crisis is not themain reason; he refuses to share the dividends he is receiving fromthe partnerships with Kinder Morgan, EPD etc."
Thank you. It’s an option on a 10x upside with little downside
How can market cap be above $200m with only 3.7m outstanding shares??
48 cents pre reverse split today
On Conf call now - ALTM confirms confidence of free cash flow to implement the $1.50/share QUARTERLY dividend while more than servicing any debt. Board of Directors has already given initial approval.
I will add at a buck seventy five
"@Trading8 it's quite possible. Dividend hunters and Funds will buy well into the 50's and still be very happy making the 10% - 12% yield. They will be holding for the future yield, not day trading. With only 3.7M float and many current investors holding their shares, the pool of available shares will continually narrow sharply. Any remaining shorts who now realize the share price is tied the dividend yield and decoupled from other measures will have no choice but to cover and push the price further higher. For those reasons the mechanics look ripe for ALTM to rise and stay there, may happen today or may happen slower. My opinion, comments welcome."
I  MIDSTREAMS....SMLP UP 17% and Rushing....HOPE you have your Life Savings Vest On....
By the Way.....Not too late to FILL UP the TRUCK @ SMLP.....UP 11%....
I meant the newly appointed COO ( and not CEO)..sorry for the typo.Ofcourse they have nice power point presentations; but power point does not pay my bills at the grocery store;only dividends do !
2.5 million today big boys dumping
"Those in the know - please clarify. I have noticed in the 10-Q filings a reference to the idea that only ""Class A"" shares are eligible for any dividend distributions (I know divs are not expected yet). And that the Class C shares owned by Apache are not eligible for dividends or liquidating distributions. Earlier this year I contacted investor relations about this and they were not aware of such considerations for dividends. They checked and confirmed that only Class A shares are eligible for dividends and liquidating distributions, but that somehow Apache could still receive dividends and distributions. I know Apache can convert the Class C to A anytime, but it seems the intent of the corporate structure of Altus was to exclude dividends go Class C shares. That IR answer wasn't very clear at the time. Given the reverse split, there are only 3.75 M class A shares. Given the expected and significant EBIDTA and DCF expected next year, it wouldn't take much to pay Class A shares a hefty dividend, and still have plenty to begin reducing debt or retire Preferred shares. A $10 per share dividend to the Class A will only cost $37.5 M and leave over 100M to reduce debt etc. What am I missing?"
Good news for the KMI/ALTM Permian Highway Pipeline. Nationwide Permit 12 reinstated by Supreme Court for all pipeline projects except Keystone XL. The Sierra Club lawsuit still pending but no stay or injunction has been issued from the Texas Court. KMI stated they are 70% complete with PHP. https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/506112-supreme-court-reinstates-fast-track-pipeline-permitting-except-for
my guess never They have no debt but MILLIONS of preferred which take precedence over common and if their tradition takes place just stock buybacks My guess their cronies have the preferred
CEO Bretches SEC filed that he purchased another 2620 shares today. Bought 51 shares yesterday also.
A DOLLAR a Day keeps the Shorts Away....
"Did anyone else already know that the 4th ""undisclosed anchor shipper"" owner of the Permian Highway Pipeline was Exxon Mobile (XOM)? That was news to me, haven't seen that mentioned previously."
"Some of these midstream companies appear to be getting pretty low. Looks like KMI, EPD, ET, NBLX, and RTLR are all trading in the low 8x EV/EBITDA multiple range or lower based on 2020 forecasts. Hard for the smaller ones to consolidate when they are tied to parent companies I guess. Wonder if KMI and the bigger ones are stepping up repurchases."
"Assuming that the dividend stays at $6/year, which equates to 60pct / year,at today closing price then to equal a payout of 12 pct /yr ( typical for midstream pipe linecompanies) the stock should eventually rise to $50/share- a 5 bagger."
Makes APA more valuable when the buyout is announced. Look for 36+

"At the original IPO,ALTM was $10/shareWere they not basing that IPO price on a 7% dividend...$0.70 estimate?Am I looking at it wrong?Have things changed so as they would have to reduce that estimate?"
Love this! Tmrw 40 and 50 by EOM.... And 50 would still be cheap for 6$ annual dividend
Why the volume?
20% dilution of the shares has yet to be priced into the share price
Share price down over 10 per cent in one day ------ No confidence vote by Investors in the management & business model of ALTM
Share price falling --- not good
"We common shareholders were told there was no debt after we bought they created a preferred here is why If a company liquidates, a line of outstretched hands forms to collect the proceeds. At the head of the line is the Internal Revenue Service to collect any back taxes and the trustees charged with carrying out the liquidation. Next come the creditors and employees, followed by the preferred shareholders and finally the holders of common stock. The PREFERRED is like debt to us"
"Kayne Anderson added 1,022,020 shares according to a 13G that cae out 2/6/20"

Altus Midstream is up 6.07% to 61.84
"I thought these copy/paste keypoints from todays RBN Energy Blog were all very postive for ALTM's future: Some highlights from East Daley Capital’s newly issued 2021 Midstream Guidance Outlook, which focuses on key trends affecting midstream asset owners.First, that natural gas demand will increase — mostly due to rising waterborne exports of LNG and pipeline exports to Mexico Second, that the all-important Permian Basin will buck the aforementioned trend and experience continued growth in natural gas production — growth that over the next couple of years may constrain the play’s existing gas processing capacity and require more investment.With pipeline capacity available to access key markets and reduced basis discounts, Permian producers also may be incented to refocus their capex on areas that would previously have been considered too gassy — with higher GORs — and also to gather and sell more of the gas that may have previously been flared. All that suggests that, despite lower crude production forecasts, associated gas growth in the Permian will continue at a healthy pace over the next couple of years — to the point that it may yet even outstrip the capacity of existing gas processing plants in the play and lead to the development of new processing capacity."
"I may ~finally~ be back to breakeven with ALTM. Been a long road. My only regret now is that I didn't add some after the reverse-split. That was a missed opportunity. But I was so angry with the whole situation (and APA in general), that I just couldn't do it. But it is looking good now."
