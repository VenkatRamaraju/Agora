All-time high was $36.05 seven years ago? Getting close now. Many of my long term holdings are nowhere near their all time highs. Intel? Cisco? Merck and Pfizer are finally getting close. Dividends alone cannot keep up with inflation.
"MDU --Great earnings released EPS = .56 cents ACTUAL.CFRA KEEPS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF MDU RESOURCES GROUP, INC.2:53 pm ET February 4, 2021 (CFRA) Print - Raise $2 to target price $32. A great company to own with %3.20 dividend. """"Our $32 target price, raised $2, is based on discounted cash flow analysis and implies a 14.2x multiple on projected '22 EPS, a discount to MDU's three-year forward average (16.5x) and the peer group median (19.6x). We raise our '21 EPS estimate $0.17 to $2.12 and initiate '22's estimate at $2.25. MDU posts Q4 normalized EPS of $0.56 vs. $0.47, beating the consensus forecast by $0.04. The construction materials business saw a 22% increase in earnings in 2020 on $2.2B of revenue while the construction services business saw an 18% increase on $2.1B of revenue. Mild weather allowed for a longer-than-average construction season and total backlog grew to $1.9B (+6% Y/Y), indicating demand for MDU's contracting services remains strong. The utility segment saw 1.8% overall customer growth, but electric and natural gas sales volumes declined 3.3% and 7.4%, respectively, amid the pandemic. We think near term demand-catalysts for MDU include stimulus, a potential infrastructure bill, and vaccine roll-outs.""""Great time to accumulate more MDU shares."

Yes! Another half cent per share per quarter. Slowly getting rich. Very slowly.

MDU should be 35 by 3/19 with all the hype going on with power.
"Just a thought...Could MDU's lack of a pulse the last year or more be part of an effort by the powers to be to have BKH and MDU become equals, at least by market cap., and make it an easy way to sell a merger of equals?....."

MDU has a very solid foundation. Should be a long term winner.

Congrats again for the new 53 wk highs....now go for the all-time high.....IMO going all in with material and construction services (building road-ways) might be a consideration.....Maybe separate into 2-3 companies...why take $$$ from one to help the others.......zoom zoom

"My colleague Mitch Rolling studies utility company filings. He found that Xcel Energy, the principal electrical utility in Minnesota and Colorado, recently warned that reliance on wind energy could lead to power outages: https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2020/08/reliance-on-wind-and-solar-will-lead-to-blackouts.phpXcel warns that the growing presence of remote energy sources like wind and solar could trigger power outages similar to what occurred in southern Australia in 2016. As the utility company notes:[I]n 2016, the Australia power system experienced storm damage that forced several transmission lines to open. The wind farms that were being relied upon at that time…started to trip offline – resulting in a large-scale power outage in southern Australia. While there are standards and practices in place in the Eastern Interconnection, MISO and Minnesota transmission systems to help avoid this same scenario, the rapid escalation of renewable resources and the earlier than expected retirement of baseload generation places a greater strain on the transmission system to deliver more remote sources of generation, and increases the likelihood of events similar to the Australia power outage occurring on the local transmission system."
Williams Capital raises Mdu price target to 32.
Super excited to slowly add to my position here. Wish I could add more right now but I have other plays that need to play out.Good company in a quietly growing area of the country. Deals in real stuff. Bubble and geographic risk resistant. Won't get regulated away if it runs too strong (BTC comes to mind). Dividend much better than a bank.

Okay time to vent about Mdu. I'm a long term holder. Been doing a drip for 18 years. I've accepted Mdu moves like a turtle to make a dollar gain but it seems like Mdu has so much more potential. I don't know what the answer to unlocking it's value. Break it up? My biggest beef with them is not rewarding long term dedicated holders like myself. The dividend increases are small but nice but since I've been patient why not a special dividend? I've seen countless other companies reward their patient investors. Maybe they can't afford it......I don't know. Hope some of the top brass are reading this post from a impatient Mdu investor. Please figure these issues out cause I'm about ready to cash out. Anyone else feel my frustration?

Been in Mdu drip for 20 years and it split twice. Happened in the 30s. look for another 3 for 2 this year.

"MDU released an outstanding EPS on Nov 4-2020. "" Was maintains a BUY RATING BY CFRA - a five start investment research firm with a price target of $30 on Nov 5-2020. (See Benzinga MDU Resources Gr Q3 EPS $0.76 Beats $0.63 Estimate, Sales $1.59B Up From $1.56B YoY4:57 pm ET November 4, 2020 (Benzinga) Print""""CFRA MAINTAINS BUY RATING ON SHARES OF MDU RESOURCES GROUP, INC.1:36 pm ET November 5, 2020 (CFRA) PrintOur 12-month target price remains $30, reflecting a 15.4x multiple on projected '21 EPS, a discount to MDU's historical forward average and a discount to peers (MDU historically trades at a discount). Following MDU's upward revision to guidance, we raise our '20 EPS estimate $0.04 to $1.85 and '21's estimate $0.12 to $1.95. MDU posted Q3 normalized EPS of $0.76 (+11% YoY), beating consensus by $0.12. The regulated energy business underperformed in Q3, but MDU's construction businesses outperformed, offsetting the loss. Despite lower revenues for construction materials, earnings were higher as low energy prices boosted margins. Construction services (+41% YoY) saw growth in its inside electrical contracting work, particularly for hospitality and high-tech clients, and maintained its resilient backlog ($1.2B). We continue to see value in MDU as it exposes investors to some cyclical-based recovery (via construction work), while providing a steady stream of income from its regulated utility businesses.MDU Resources Gr (NYSE:MDU) reported quarterly earnings of $0.76 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $0.63 by 20.63 percent. This is a 11.76 percent increase over earnings of $0.68 per share from the same period last year. The company reported $1.59 billion in sales this quarter. This is a 1.49 percent increase over sales of $1.56 billion the same period last year.""While all MDU peers in the UTILITIES SECTORS ' are ALL UP and MDUdid price not respond well to today's market rally. I would take this great opportunity to accumulate more MDU at this deep discounts and collecting a nice DIVIDENT at 3.50%."

If you don't think there's a huge infrastructure bill at the end of this virus epidemic you're crazy. Right into MDU's wheelhouse and a great dividend yield as you await the appreciation of the share price.
