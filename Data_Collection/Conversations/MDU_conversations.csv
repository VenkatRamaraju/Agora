Any one on the streets could run this company better than the idiots running it now.
Fair dividend has me still sitting tight on a large long-time investment here. Seems safe.
"Germany Still Uses 40 % Coal for electric generation.. the Renewable energy has made the cost of electricity more then 3 times the US average.Germany's Green Energy Meltdown; Voters promised a virtuous revolution get coal and high prices instead.The Editorial Board. Wall Street Journal (Online); New York, N.Y. [New York, N.Y]American climate-change activists point to Europe, and especially Germany, as the paragon of green energy virtue. But they ought to look closer at Angela Merkel's political struggles as she tries to form a new government in Berlin amid the economic fallout from the Chancellor's failing energy revolution.Berlin last month conceded it will miss its 2020 carbon emissions-reduction goal, having cut emissions by just under 30% compared with 1990 instead of the 40% that Mrs. Merkel promised. The goal of 55% by 2030 is almost surely out of reach.Mrs. Merkel's failure comes despite astronomical costs. By one estimate, businesses and households paid an extra [euro]125 billion in increased electricity bills between 2000 and 2015 to subsidize renewables, on top of billions more in other handouts. Germans join Danes in paying the highest household electricity rates in Europe, and German companies pay near the top among industrial users. This is a big reason Mrs. Merkel underperformed in September's election.Berlin has heavily subsidized renewable energy since 2000, primarily via feed-in tariffs requiring utilities to buy electricity from renewable generators at above-market rates. Mrs. Merkel put that effort into overdrive in 2010 when she introduced the Energiewende, or energy revolution.The centerpiece is the escalating emissions-reductions targets Germany now is missing, which surpass the 20% reduction by 2020 to which the rest of the European Union has committed. The policy is also supposed to reduce total energy consumption to 50% of the 2008 level by 2050, with a 25% reduction in electricity use. That was a tall enough order for an industrial economy. Then Mrs. Merkel made it even harder in 2011, with a hasty promise after Japan's Fukushima disaster to phase out nuclear power by 2022.Energiewende enthusiasts say the policy is racking up successes despite the problems. That's true only in the sense that if you throw enough money at something, some of the cash has to stick. In electric generating capacity, for instance, renewables are now running almost even with traditional fuel sources.Yet much of that capacity is wasted--only one-third of Germany's electricity is actually generated by renewables. Berlin has invested heavily in wind and solar power that is easiest to generate in parts of Germany that need the power the least, especially the north. Berlin will need to spend another huge sum building transmission lines to the industrial south.The other costs relate to providing electricity when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine, which is often in Germany. The traditional plants needed to fill in the gaps are overwhelmingly fired by coal, on which Germany still relies for roughly 40% of its power.Natural gas would be cleaner and is easy to switch on and off. But gas is more expensive than coal, and the peak daytime consumption hours when gas could recoup that investment are also the times utilities are more likely to be required to buy overpriced solar power.As a result, natural gas accounts for only 9.4% of Germany's electricity, down from a little over 14% in 2010. Gas accounts for some 30% of U.S. electricity generation, and the shift to gas from coal explains a majority of the reductions in carbon emissions in U.S. generation since 2005, according to a report last month by the U.S. Energy Information Administration. German households pay nearly 36 U.S. cents a kilowatt-hour of electricity, versus an average of 13 cents in America.No wonder voters are in revolt. Surveys say that in theory Germans like being green, but polls about household energy costs say otherwise. The right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) won a surprising 13% vote share in part on a promise to end the Energiewende immediately. A new study from the RWI Leibniz Institute for Economic Research finds that 61% of Germans wouldn't want to pay even one eurocent more per kilowatt-hour of electricity to fund more renewables"

Know It All Don. Are You A Veteran ? I think that is a fair question !
Okay time to vent about Mdu. I'm a long term holder. Been doing a drip for 18 years. I've accepted Mdu moves like a turtle to make a dollar gain but it seems like Mdu has so much more potential. I don't know what the answer to unlocking it's value. Break it up? My biggest beef with them is not rewarding long term dedicated holders like myself. The dividend increases are small but nice but since I've been patient why not a special dividend? I've seen countless other companies reward their patient investors. Maybe they can't afford it......I don't know. Hope some of the top brass are reading this post from a impatient Mdu investor. Please figure these issues out cause I'm about ready to cash out. Anyone else feel my frustration?
"Part III - Utility deals press credit, but Duke Energy is among few to see actual ratings downgrade. Of those, only two were all-stock deals. Some of the remainder involved a combination of stock and cash, but most have been all-cash deals.“In general, these leveraged utility acquisitions have triggered negative rating or outlook actions for the acquiring company, primarily due to the additional parent company leverage used to fund the transaction,” the report notes.Credit factorsBut in most cases to date that has meant only putting the buyer on a negative credit watch. Only two cases have resulted in actual credit downgrade. They are the Duke-Piedmont deal and The LaClede Group’s (NYSE:LG) $1.35 billion cash deal for Alabama Gas Corp. in 2014.To be fair, Moody’s had already put Duke on a negative credit watch before the Piedmont deal, and Duke CEO Lynn Good has said Duke expected the downgrade even absent the purchase.But the report says the $4.5 billion Duke intends to borrow for the Piedmont deal was a factor in its decision to reduce Duke’s corporate debt to BAA1 from A3.“The downgrade of Duke ... long-term ratings in January 2016 was prompted by weak consolidated financial metrics, a high level of debt at the Duke holding company, and the acquisition of Piedmont ..., which will worsen these credit factors,” the report says.Maintain ratingsMoody’s even warned that completion of the deal could lead to another downgrade because some credit metrics indicate “more appropriately positioning Duke at the Baa2 rating level.”Duke has expressed confidence it would be able to maintain its credit ratings with Moody’s, Fitch and Standard &amp; Poor’s (the latter two of which have Duke on a negative watch) after the deal.""Our credit ratings are important to us. Duke Energy’s strong balance sheet and credit quality are the bedrock to our overall financial objectives,"" says spokeswoman Jennifer Zajac. ""Our focus on our core businesses is creating a better risk profile with more predictable and stable earnings and cash flows."""

"Part III - The Fed Is Learning Just How Hard the Exit From Easy Money Will Be. It is not merely about evaluating how the United States economy is doing and whether it remains solidly on track -- and given the flaws in economic data, that job is hard enough.Fed officials must also weigh whether the global force of low inflation is so powerful as to continue dragging down prices in the United States even after the domestic economy has healed. They have to figure out whether the feedback loops between economic weakness and easy money in other countries create unconventional risks to the United States by raising rates too quickly.The 2008 financial crisis was a profound test of the Fed's ability to prevent economic collapse; from 2009 to 2012, the central bank made crucial decisions to keep pushing the United States economy toward recovery.This year is showing just how intricate the exit from this era of easy money will truly be."

"if no ""conversations"" taking place here, what about IV? http://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=4620"
All-time high was $36.05 seven years ago? Getting close now. Many of my long term holdings are nowhere near their all time highs. Intel? Cisco? Merck and Pfizer are finally getting close. Dividends alone cannot keep up with inflation.

"Part III - Opinion: How the wealthiest Americans got rich may surprise you. Rather than looking after their portfolios around the clock and over-diversifying into asset classes they don’t fully understand, getting wealthy slowly is about disciplined planning, regular rebalancing, making sure the portfolio is age-appropriate, and other boring, dull tactics.Today’s wealthy made their fortunes before most of the alternative asset categories were available in mutual funds, and while younger, less-affluent investors may like the sales pitch, long-term success is about what works over those many years, not what’s hot at the moment.Heilmann noted that investors “don’t have to make things more complicated because the ability to buy good companies — good, dividend-paying companies — and to hold them on a long-term basis is still alive and well. “There’s a lot to be said for stable and steady,” he added. “That’s part of the American Dream too, even if it’s not what people talk about the most.”"

"My colleague Mitch Rolling studies utility company filings. He found that Xcel Energy, the principal electrical utility in Minnesota and Colorado, recently warned that reliance on wind energy could lead to power outages: https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2020/08/reliance-on-wind-and-solar-will-lead-to-blackouts.phpXcel warns that the growing presence of remote energy sources like wind and solar could trigger power outages similar to what occurred in southern Australia in 2016. As the utility company notes:[I]n 2016, the Australia power system experienced storm damage that forced several transmission lines to open. The wind farms that were being relied upon at that time…started to trip offline – resulting in a large-scale power outage in southern Australia. While there are standards and practices in place in the Eastern Interconnection, MISO and Minnesota transmission systems to help avoid this same scenario, the rapid escalation of renewable resources and the earlier than expected retirement of baseload generation places a greater strain on the transmission system to deliver more remote sources of generation, and increases the likelihood of events similar to the Australia power outage occurring on the local transmission system."

A great company to own with %3.20 dividend. """"Our $32 target price, raised $2, is based on discounted cash flow analysis and implies a 14.2x multiple on projected '22 EPS, a discount to MDU's three-year forward average (16.5x) and the peer group median (19.6x). We raise our '21 EPS estimate $0.17 to $2.12 and initiate '22's estimate at $2.25. MDU posts Q4 normalized EPS of $0.56 vs. $0.47, beating the consensus forecast by $0.04. The construction materials business saw a 22% increase in earnings in 2020 on $2.2B of revenue while the construction services business saw an 18% increase on $2.1B of revenue. Mild weather allowed for a longer-than-average construction season and total backlog grew to $1.9B (+6% Y/Y), indicating demand for MDU's contracting services remains strong. The utility segment saw 1.8% overall customer growth, but electric and natural gas sales volumes declined 3.3% and 7.4%, respectively, amid the pandemic. We think near term demand-catalysts for MDU include stimulus, a potential infrastructure bill, and vaccine roll-outs.""""Great time to accumulate more MDU shares."

"Part III - Utility deals press credit, but Duke Energy is among few to see actual ratings downgrade. Duke has made clear, however, that it intends to continue with acquisitions in the natural gas space. And that could raise additional questions if they are debt-financed purchases.The report finds that the debt-financed deals to date consistently weaken key credit factors such as a company’s cash flow from operations, before working capital is removed, to long-term debt.“We believe higher leverage will outweigh cash-flow improvements (from the acquisitions), putting pressure on the acquiring company’s credit profile,” Moody’s says.Deals continueBut the deals continue. Riesemann notes that two more such deals have been closed since the end of last year. Dominion Resources (NYSE:D) announced a $ 4.4 billion all-cash deal to purchase Utah-based natural gas utility Questar in early February.Two weeks later, the Canadian company Algonquin Power &amp; Utilities (TSX: AQN) announced an all-cash $1.5 billion deal to buy Empire District Electric Company (NYSE:EDE) of Joplin, Mo.A third utility, Westar Energy (NYSE:WR), based in Topeka, Kansas, announced recently that it is considering its strategic options, including a possible salePotential targetsRiesemann lists four companies primarily involved in natural gas as possible targets as consolidation continues. They are Atos Energy, New Jersey Resources, South Jersey Industries and Southwest Gas. He says smaller electric utilities in the Pacific Northwest and the Great Plains are potential targets.“If a company has a market cap less than $10B, in all but a few cases, (it's) a herbivore,” he writes his report released this week.Riesemann has previously identified South Carolina’s SCANA Corp., which has both electric and natural gas utilities in the Carolinas, as a possible target. At a $9.7 billion market cap, it is right at the line between potential buyers and sellers."

Following MDU's upward revision to guidance, we raise our '20 EPS estimate $0.04 to $1.85 and '21's estimate $0.12 to $1.95. MDU posted Q3 normalized EPS of $0.76 (+11% YoY), beating consensus by $0.12. The regulated energy business underperformed in Q3, but MDU's construction businesses outperformed, offsetting the loss. Despite lower revenues for construction materials, earnings were higher as low energy prices boosted margins. Construction services (+41% YoY) saw growth in its inside electrical contracting work, particularly for hospitality and high-tech clients, and maintained its resilient backlog ($1.2B). We continue to see value in MDU as it exposes investors to some cyclical-based recovery (via construction work), while providing a steady stream of income from its regulated utility businesses.MDU Resources Gr (NYSE:MDU) reported quarterly earnings of $0.76 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $0.63 by 20.63 percent. This is a 11.76 percent increase over earnings of $0.68 per share from the same period last year. The company reported $1.59 billion in sales this quarter.
