if i am not mistaken rga is a reinsurance for life ins not casualty insurance
"Reinsurance Group of America Announces Pricing of Common Stock Offering (11:54 PM ET 6/2/20 | BusinessWire)Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (NYSE: RGA) announced today that it has priced its previously announced underwritten public offering of 6,172,840 shares of RGA's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the ""Common Stock""), at a public offering price of $81.00 per share.Why is the Stock RGA still trading above 81 USD?"
"From thinkadvisor.com:In 2018, U.S. life insurers paid about $80 billion in death benefits, and they reported a total net operating gain of just $6.5 billion from life insurance, along with a total net gain of $28 billion from life insurance and annuities combined.Life insurers use REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS (caps mine) and other tools to limit exposure to risk.But, if they had no access to those tools, a coronavirus epidemic similar to the 1968 Hong Kong flu could eat up about half of U.S. life insurers’ life and annuity operating profits for a year. An outbreak comparable to the 1918 flu pandemic could eat up about five years of life and annuity operating profits."
Big earnings beat!
The ask price in After Hours Trading is $103 per share....does anyone think RGA breaks through $100 tomorrow
"Reinsurance Group's operating revenues of $3.4 billion improved nearly 6.7% year over year. Moreover, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.3%...and yet we're down."
"Normally RGA stock reacts poorly during a strong flu season when an extra 10k people pass away. A normal FLU season is 25-35k deaths. Coronvirus is looking like 250k from the beginning of the year till October and then another 200k just during FLU season from November to March = totaling 450k U.S. Deaths. Add another 30k deaths in Canada, 120k in the UK / 2k Australia = total deaths in RGA's Region over 12 months is 602,000. Now, they said that thus far the deaths haven't been really focused on the insured market. The trend seems to be about 25% of the deaths are under the age of 65, that is about 150k deaths in the prime insured area globally, so they may or may not get clipped in this next set of mortality events. Their bond portfolio while having a longer duration has the yield winding down and the reinvestment rate keeps going lower. They do not have a high-quality bond portfolio and they were saved by the Fed on their credit risk. The company issued $500 mln in debt during the pandemic. The company has 2 questionable quarters coming, trades at 10x earnings, when companies that have more diverse businesses like MET and PRU trade at 6-7x. IF you put a 6-7x on RGA it is $70-84 range. Even if you assume you get a 10 multiple on their 2021 numbers you basically have dead money at $120. It appears to be a pair trade opportunity to short RGA during their weak period and go long a company like MET. MET just sold off assets and is buying back 7% of their company. MET has a 4% yield and RGA has a 2%. Note JPM downgraded this stock in November due to these risks. Where I could be wrong is they have other pension businesses that are helped by early mortality, and the value sector has been strong. Given the current price / risk and reward, I see no reason of owning RGA over the next 6 months."
Up $5.02 After Hours
Glad I added in the 80s a couple of days ago. Very few people seem to understand reinsurance. RGA and ATH are STILL good values even at these prices.
"Best’s Market Segment Report: Global Life Reinsurers Poised for Growth, But Mature U.S. Market Still KeyGrowth in the U.S. life reinsurance market has been challenged due to limited growth by direct writers, but opportunities have taken shape in emerging markets, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as in legacy life/annuity blocks of business that have come to market, according to a new AM Best special report."
"The growth speaks for itself.U.K.-based Legal &General in a February report said the U.S. pension risk transfer business in 2020 could surpass the prior year and post the biggest year yet for a growing business.Markets for PRTs grew in both countries, with the sector climbing from average annual volumes of less than $3 billion in the U.S. prior to 2012 to an expected $30 billion in 2019. Despite the growth, America's market is dwarfed by that seen across the Atlantic Ocean, where U.K. transactions were on track to total more than £40 billion (US$52 billion) for the same year."
"Approaching 200 DMA of $110.23. Expect to see resistance there. If this crosses, we should see run up to US$ 150. Wont be quick, but the probability is high that we will get there."
Some post earning profit taking going on today..
RGA got a huge buy shout out on Squawk box a week ago. He was right on. Go RGA!
"A real satisfied RGA shareholder here. I follow reinsurers closely, and RGA is a real value here."
Buying opportunity?
All the other insurance companies that have reported so far have surprised to the upside and I see no reason that RGA will be any different. The analyst are projecting an $.89 loss but I believe the loss will be significantly less.
"The elephant in the room right now is insurance for business interruption due to COVID. About half of the policies contain a clause that the insurance does not cover pandemics, but the other half do not. Would RGA possibly be responsible for this ?"
i have never heard of a life ins policy that excludes pandemic
Great news today for RGA. People are ignoring this stock because they don’t understand reinsurance. Still greatly undervalued after today!
