i just hope we get reasonable guidance in conference call.
Hi. I'm a new investor and put a thousand dollars into this stock on November 28. I see the stock value has halved but my shares didn't double. Will my shares double on closing today or what is going on. Thank you for helping out a new guy. I'm just starting out.
Maybe it will fall to 47-48
The $60 billions tariff against China announced this morning will include tariff on products such as automation and robotics. Is this tariff good or bad to Cognex?
"At $48 we have a quadruple top breakout with a price objective of $74.Congratulations for patient longs who were not spooked out of their shares by the sell-side (Goldman) dour downgrade reports. Granted those cautious calls by analysts were warranted short-term, but you won't see them call the bottom and upgrade the stock until its too late"
I waited a long time to buy this. Today I bought in with 50% funds set aside. I will wait for the split and what the future of tech holds. Great opportunity for a stock on a tear
Looks like a split. Anybody knows about it?
I don’t understand how the market cannot recognize and compute where revs will be based on guidance and the completely transparent communications related to the extreme revenues q3 q4 last year. Not only that but non CE markets performed exceptionally.
"loss was on tax changes. beat revenue, met eps. overreaction"
"come on people, it is trading is a range of fair value right now. when the market was over bought it was flying high, but after the split and recent correction it will be in this zone for awhile especially with 1Q18 guidance. Stay long and invest in some other stocks like NVDA, APPL, AVGO etc. Just because you think it ought to be $70 doesn't mean it will be now, but the future potential is certainly there."
"Heard about this the other day on Cramer's show. Looked into it a bit. My main concern is that Auto is currently their biggest customer segment, and it's not doing great overall. I'd like to own it more from the logistics (ecommerce) standpoint and manufacturing of the future, not auto. This company just laid off nearly 200 people. They said in their recent call they have very unpredictable revenue and they seem to be at the mercy of their customers. Just wondering what you all think. Basically I'd like to own a piece of this technology, but am I just better off sticking to the end users of their technology (companies like Amazon etc) ?"

"Thank you Dr. Bob, I was lucky to invest in CGNX at $8 per share just a few years ago, and thoroughly enjoyed being part of your journey. Best of luck in your future endeavors! ""Take your work seriously but not yourself"" Love it!!!"
"The Street is going to miss the turn in fundamentals because they are trained either to study only one quarter ahead or need to rely on management's full year guidance to maintain their financial models. In either case they do not add value and will not make you money. Congrats to JP Morgan on pressing their ""sell"" call on the above premise."
"Second quarter was ahead of consensus, hence the early scheduling of its earnings call. Stock will resume higher toward the mid-fifties post earnings with a new high next year as OLED panel production in Asia accelerates"
Owned this stock for a long time. Stock price seems to be stuck in 70’s and 80’s. I like the initial growth it had. Now suspecting if I should sell it and buy something else. I never know when to sell.
"WORMS, coming out!LAST CALL!PAY ANYTHING!"
"wow, still above 30! all right, will wait another week"
Low volume all day and someone keeps paying the ask.....bet company buying back shares to lift price
"As a holder of CGNX the part that worries me most was this quote from the CEO yesterday. ""Following a record year in 2017, we face tough comparisons this year, particularly in the second half, due to anticipated lower demand from consumer electronics—our largest industry vertical. Because of that, we believe that Cognex revenue over the next nine months will be relatively flat in total with the comparable period in 2017.""Are we looking at a flat quarter on PPS? Any thoughts?"
