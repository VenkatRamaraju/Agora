"As a holder of CGNX the part that worries me most was this quote from the CEO yesterday. ""Following a record year in 2017, we face tough comparisons this year, particularly in the second half, due to anticipated lower demand from consumer electronics—our largest industry vertical. Because of that, we believe that Cognex revenue over the next nine months will be relatively flat in total with the comparable period in 2017.""Are we looking at a flat quarter on PPS? Any thoughts?"
JPM trying to talk down the stock following my #3 postulate 3) Analysts stay on sidelines based on valuation and waiting to see more evidence that markets are indeed improving
When is the next earnings report for CGNX?
"July 31, 2018CGNX will be a $75 stock or better by year 2020"
Down 12 pats pre split
"The Street is going to miss the turn in fundamentals because they are trained either to study only one quarter ahead or need to rely on management's full year guidance to maintain their financial models. In either case they do not add value and will not make you money. Congrats to JP Morgan on pressing their ""sell"" call on the above premise."
up again today!
52.40 in Thurs after market--see what happens when some over react- I tried to tell you.
Once again the Wall Street analysts have missed the turn in Cognex fundamentals and stand flat-footed with their numerous hold ratings while the stock continues a nice break-out
"$55 strike Feb. calls expire worthless as options expire today. Starting next Monday, parity is restored and we move closer to 60 and beyond in a week. Familiar script."
Over 40% increase yoy!
I guess now we know why they increased buyback. They knew it was going to get torched
Time to buy Cognex after this 50% correction. Looks fairly priced at these levels currently.
Buy this when below $50. Not as innovative as some other companies which will keep it less of a takeover target until stock hits over $80 which probably will not be until 2022.
The ill-informed shorts are gonna squeal
There is currently weakness in Automation AI sector. Even Rockwell Automation is still corrected down 15%. Nothing is wrong. CGNX is stabilizing here at 54 before goes up.
"Thank you Dr. Bob for the special holiday gift. I think I'll buy a case of fine Tuscan reds while contemplating another all-time high while ""top-ranked"" II analysts continue to miss the the run"
"zi nkla july 2nd, july 24th weekly calls, truck presentation, warrant conversion for nkla"
"Second quarter was ahead of consensus, hence the early scheduling of its earnings call. Stock will resume higher toward the mid-fifties post earnings with a new high next year as OLED panel production in Asia accelerates"
"Even after the split, it still looks overvalued right now."
It appears that the entire lot of Wall Street analysts have missed the turn in fundamentals while furiously updating their Excel models and complaining about skeletal management guidance
"The company has done a good job supporting the price. It should have dived below $40, but low volume and 1.5-2% green speaks volumes"
This stock never reached its pre split price if 75. I think the company growth is over. I maybe wrong in saying that.
Entire market down and CGNX up 1.43% on 50% volume. That's a red flag.
JPM needs to sharpen their pencil and get up to speed on this company
I think we see this move into the 60s relatively soon.
"Stock is in downtrend because last year's stellar earnings were due to one-time large orders from key customers. CGNX does not expect a repeat of the same orders, hence the Earning estimates are revised lower. Most of CGNX products can last years even decades, a customer may not need to reorder them for a long time. So price can fluctuates due to customer order spikes."
Record Revenue$. They will rotate back to this and run it up to A 1$$ Hunge.
How short can we go.
today has been moved by the market makers.... no reason for this jump...
Hi. I'm a new investor and put a thousand dollars into this stock on November 28. I see the stock value has halved but my shares didn't double. Will my shares double on closing today or what is going on. Thank you for helping out a new guy. I'm just starting out.
"The stock was already down 20% heading into earnings. The, again, beat earnings and the stock tanks. This is just people playing games... trying to drive out the weak of heart and drive down the price so they can swoop in and buy large quantities at the greatly reduced price."
First sign of life since before the split even
Great buying opportunity
"nice curve on daily chart, it'll be up back at where it was last week"
Why does this company continue to beat EPS and revenue and still drop?? Can anyone explain this?
"So Goldman is the murderer of this stock. After selling CGNX off from $70, down grade this stock to a price target of $55 based on margin pressure and tradition year for Cgnx. Plan to buy it back at $40, Goldman?"
"Thoughts on how much of the money Apple is bringing back to invest in the US will go to CGNX? I know we are myopic investors and just can't fathom what cognex will do if Apple revs come up a bit short one quarter? Cognex makes the glass, case and chips for the iPhones so obviously a direct and major impact to CGNX revs."
Sorry. Don't see it. Bought in at 49.50. bottom is close. See ya at $60 after earnings.
Long on CGNX. will it get back in the 70's?
"Q1 is okay, but Q2 is going to be amazing"
"The dour JP Morgan analyst's limp $40 target and conspicuous underperform rating set expectations very low heading into the quarter. Management will try to douse Q1 expectations a bit, but already well-telegraphed. Logistics is booming with 50% growth and now 10% of revenue, which should offset weak auto and China softness. Going forward, just a matter of time for markets to sync and we get liftoff"
looks like it might reach 56+ by end of market.
Looks like a split. Anybody knows about it?
I waited a long time to buy this. Today I bought in with 50% funds set aside. I will wait for the split and what the future of tech holds. Great opportunity for a stock on a tear
"Real value 32, please. Real Value is more like 80."
"This one is always interesting to watch, but what concerns me the last 3-6 months is the net insider selling, not buying. Several things could explain that but it can never be construed as a positive when the outlook is supposedly so strong. Interesting none the less."
"We don't want to see down. We want to see up. The corporate culture of this company sounds just great. Like a family. Good, growing company with a stock that is once again showing life. It was so hot before the split. Hit a high of I think $145. Let it roll."
This stock has not much since it split. I recall Intel splitting in 2000 and has still not reached the split price of about 75. I think this stock is done with growth.
Nicely defined T-Cup forming on the charts. Very Cool. A cup and handle formation.
This board is not very active. I guess not much to talk about as this stock price is pretty much stuck
Stock is totally oversold. Great oportunity to buy. Company has strong long term growth. Backing out Consume Electronics market the groth rates are stable in the mid 20.
could someone please enlighten me as to WTH is happening here? is this a hold or should I sell before I have nothing???
this stock is way oversold
2 earnings in a row with great numbers and it gets torched
"At $48 we have a quadruple top breakout with a price objective of $74.Congratulations for patient longs who were not spooked out of their shares by the sell-side (Goldman) dour downgrade reports. Granted those cautious calls by analysts were warranted short-term, but you won't see them call the bottom and upgrade the stock until its too late"
"1) Fundamentals improve2) Stock starts to break-out (like now!)3) Analysts stay on sidelines based on valuation and waiting to see more evidence that markets are indeed improving4) Stock continues to run up5) Analysts agree that things are a bit better, but wait for a pullback to buy6) Stock continues to run up7) Wrong-footed neutral analysts finally upgrade the stock"
"The shorts had a nice run and did a good job rooting out the I-phone X cancellations, but with the Raymond James intra-day upgrade and $55 target price, the shorts will cover here and garp players have the all clear buy signal with valuation at 25X 2020 EPS"
if u look at ntap earnings yesterday it was seemed ok but tanked badly in after hours and at the open. maybe 15% down at worst point before recovering most of the losses. I think if there is a seller who wants to dump millions of shares there is not much anyone can do.
Bought 1000 shares at $40. Thank you all.
Hold on longs. Already working back up through the 50 and will retrace up to 70 range quickly. Conference coming up will really send it higher if its not already there.
Possibly another short squeeze coming. They are working hard to keep a lid on this and turn it the other way. It will be a challenge with MU grinding higher and NVDA a fraction away from breaking out further
Support at 53-54 is breached. Next support???
At least Raymond James is paying attention - Price target $120
Missing by 2 cents wouldn’t drop under $42 tomorrow.
The shorts overplayed their weak hands heading into earnings egged on by the ill-informed analysts that cover Cognex. The shorts thought they had a winner post earnings when management issued conservative Q4 guidance and the stock drifted down below $35 pre-market. Management loved this since they had just communicated a large share buyback and were gleefully buying with both hands as soon as the CC ended. Congratulations to the longs that held strong! The shorts are now squealing...
Wahooo!!! Bought 100 shares in Nov. 2013 for $31.62 per share!
The $60 billions tariff against China announced this morning will include tariff on products such as automation and robotics. Is this tariff good or bad to Cognex?
overreaction
bought at 37.05 AH
Expecting a decent move after earnings
The after-market reaction to earnings as well as several of the inane questions from analysts on the conference call reveal a profound ignorance in Cognex. One would think that analysts would learn basic DCF techniques employing LT growth rates in assessing valuation and price targets rather than falling back on the lazy and short-sighted use of one quarter forward P/E ratios.
Is this stock ever going to have a sharp pullback again?
"Hello fellow traders and beings, could somebody please explain how this stock went from being valued at 143.00 something to what it is now? or point me in the direction of wisdom? I'm fairly new at trading and this stock in particular is one of my longs."
Why is this tanking today any bad news?
"Does anyone know why these shares are listed by Yahoo Finance as down 9.1% in after hours trading?! It looks like there was only one trade made around that price if I'm reading it right, but why would anyone have felt the need to accept such a low price?"
it'll keep itself above $50. :)
Little battle here and sellers are going to lose.
"ROK automation printed solid results - I like the set-up going into earnings. Investor sentiment and positioning is clearly negative and I think the odds of them beating estimates is quite strong. Factory automation should be humming along with logistics and broad manufacturing, independent of the CE segment where everybody and their grandma knows is weak"
"The highly-paid JPM analyst has had a sell rating on CGNX for the last two years and is hoping that the broken clock theory proves him right. However, if you look deeper, beyond the obvious first derivative thinking, if will discover that CGNX will come out of this slump in a dominant position, a new highly-qualified CFO, and game-changing technology."
At $55.50 CGNX is perking up prior to the Q1 print. Will the the dour analysts at JPM and Goldman call the turn in fundamentals are or they incapable of thinking beyond the first derivative?
Timber going back to 20’s
"Thank you Dr. Bob, I was lucky to invest in CGNX at $8 per share just a few years ago, and thoroughly enjoyed being part of your journey. Best of luck in your future endeavors! ""Take your work seriously but not yourself"" Love it!!!"
"I hear word that Apple and Samsung have abandoned all production of OLED and LCD cell phones and plan to partner with Motorola to bring back the Star-tak flip phone as the new ""it"" phone (only call capablity, no app features)"
Is this a classic short squeeze going into the afternoon?
"CGNX is facing slower demand from consumer electronics and gave a weak revenue forecast. In addition, two well respected analysts lowered their price targets considerably. That said, the stock went up 10% today. Does that make any sense?"
"Short sellers are back at it again. They obviously do not know this company, the numbers or who their customers are. Its not in the spot light like a NVDA but the growth is there. Motley actually got the article right on. I would be surprised if smart money does not pick up shares as they try to short this down. I am certain they will blow out the numbers expected as well."
GOOD earning results..let's go to $55 today
Anyone know why it’s dropped so much in afterhours trading when they are still reporting record earnings?
Owned this stock for a long time. Stock price seems to be stuck in 70’s and 80’s. I like the initial growth it had. Now suspecting if I should sell it and buy something else. I never know when to sell.
Only today good Buying opportunities
it'll go back to the $70s. earning will be on Feb 15.
So CGNX effectively went down almost 18% today. Really? What changed?
"come on people, it is trading is a range of fair value right now. when the market was over bought it was flying high, but after the split and recent correction it will be in this zone for awhile especially with 1Q18 guidance. Stay long and invest in some other stocks like NVDA, APPL, AVGO etc. Just because you think it ought to be $70 doesn't mean it will be now, but the future potential is certainly there."
"That's too funny, it must have been down in sympathy to Apple. Definitely take advantage of this. As if Apple was their only customer. Furthermore, Apple could hardly hurt the numbers going forward even if Apple hit a pot hole in their production. Not too bright of the shorts on board."
i would expect some profit taking on a split of a stock that has doubled in price since a year ago. one could sell half of stock and let the rest ride.
upgraded to strong buy at Zacks.
New Strong Sell Stocks for May 15thhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/strong-sell-stocks-may-15th-123512669.html
"The downtrend is still intact, CGNX is heading towards 52-week low in the mid 30s. As long as growth is slowing down, price will be adjusted downward."
Low volume all day and someone keeps paying the ask.....bet company buying back shares to lift price
Can someone tell me what is the prediction for this stock...? It is too late to sell them as it is going down so much...
So COVID has bring attention to all logistics storage automate. It's a strong buy to me.
"WORMS, coming out!LAST CALL!PAY ANYTHING!"
This stock must be out of favor. The board is not active at all.
I don’t understand how the market cannot recognize and compute where revs will be based on guidance and the completely transparent communications related to the extreme revenues q3 q4 last year. Not only that but non CE markets performed exceptionally.
after hours at $47.65 that's 7+% jump
When this stock splits in a couple of weeks you will see incredible moves upwards. This is a must own.
What’s everyone’s thought here. Positive earnings?
Looking forward to splendid news in about 90 days.
Bringing money back to US had high tax costs to it--wiped out the good earnings for this quarter. Traded down to 53.40 in after hours- for those willing to wait this is a v good entry point. Buy more and take a loss on earlier shares after 30 days.
"It's PE is still far to rich for a company with slowing growth projections. It should be priced fairly at $30....remember this company split 2:1. If it did not, today's price would be $82.32 and it is far from worth that based on its numbers and slowed growth"
Muted interested in CGNX .... earnings after the bell today.
i just hope we get reasonable guidance in conference call.
Stock split tanked this. Won't see the $70 range for a very long time ..
closed at $58.05. tomorrow will be earning call
Goldman Sach will upgrade CGNX to outperform and increase the price target to 75 from 55 soon.
Anything under $42 is a bargain.
buy buy buy :)
How do you go from 72 to 50 > CGNX

Cognex reached an all time high at 95.39
"Oct. 30, 2017, 04:06 PMCognex Corporation (NASDAQ: CGNX) today announced that the company's Board of Directors increased its quarterly cash dividend to $0.09 per share. In addition, the Board approved a two-for-one split of the Company's common stock, payable in the form of a stock dividend.For each share of CGNX that shareholders of record own on November 17, 2017, they will receive $0.09 plus one additional share of common stock. The quarterly cash dividend and the stock dividend will both be paid on December 1, 2017.After the stock split, Cognex’s total shares outstanding will increase to approximately 173.2 million shares from approximately 86.6 million shares. The NASDAQ Stock Market is expected to begin reporting the adjusted number of shares outstanding and the split-adjusted per-share stock price on December 4, 2017."
I wish I could still get paper stock certificates. I would be tucking this under my pillow every night because I sleep so well owning this.
Good long-term buy at 35.
Shake out weak hands and short term traders. Back to 70 from here.
CGNX is down -100.00% to 0.00
Cognex is up 5.91% to 95.15
Buy on dips! Apple uses the software! Safe!
Why does this stock keep going down? Doesn't make sense given it's track record and growth.
Does Tesla use Cognex in their production line? If not then perhaps they should. All those robots certainly need something to watch over them and ensure quality control.
"dude...does anyone here actually follow this stock? if you're wondering why it looks like it's tanking, go look at how many shares you have this morning. you now have twice as many as you had on Friday."
what do you think about CGNX is 80% held by institution and short interest at 2.19%? Would you still wanna short it?
Oh well I called for $43 last night.....
I posted weeks ago a $44-$47 range coming until the technicals indicate differently...it broke thru lower Bollinger already too. If it misses its lowered .20 eps we could see hitting its 52 week low next week. No pre-earnings interest either which is a bad sign unless some gamblers come in Monday to change the down trend. Great company but just wait for a solid buy point which is what I'm doing.
Good luck shorts! Better try harder because your time is running out.

"Heard about this the other day on Cramer's show. Looked into it a bit. My main concern is that Auto is currently their biggest customer segment, and it's not doing great overall. I'd like to own it more from the logistics (ecommerce) standpoint and manufacturing of the future, not auto. This company just laid off nearly 200 people. They said in their recent call they have very unpredictable revenue and they seem to be at the mercy of their customers. Just wondering what you all think. Basically I'd like to own a piece of this technology, but am I just better off sticking to the end users of their technology (companies like Amazon etc) ?"
"wow, still above 30! all right, will wait another week"
Will CGNX be part of merger Monday?
After hours and pre-market swings are driven by panicky and easily excitable amateurs. Let’s see where this stands when the dust settles. I’m in for the long haul.
i boight at 56 today...does it come back to 56 today? i did mistake...
I would think that a lot of the retooling of assembly lines in the past two months as well as the diversification of manufacturing outside of China has benefited CGNX
life is good again. bye bye short. 
Has to be a good value here
"Not much volume today on over 9 percents drop, which means it will come back."
"As I wrote this past Tuesday morning after earnings:Long-term investors will look through the next several quarters of flat revenue growth in anticipation for CE orders to resume next year and beyond. Meanwhile, its base business continues to grow north of 20% and all signs point to a continuation of this trend well into the future. Willett also told us explicitly that there is a rich pipeline of new products serving existing and new end-market verticals. Furthermore, they are seeing no new competitive threats or gross margin pressure. And I can tell you that there is a large industrial company that would love to buy this company at $60 but Dr. Bob not ready yet."
Very nice to see. Its back on the radar.... More squeeze coming
"loss was on tax changes. beat revenue, met eps. overreaction"
INTV is moving to 10 + and has dipped below 5 bucs.. grab..
Keep adding shares.
Why up this much?
"A lot of cognex business is from China and robots use steel. If there is trade war, cognex will be affected"
Don't short it.. this will fly high in the morning
Maybe it will fall to 47-48
Is it possible that the stock is down because of the financial outlook for Q1 2018? Is the predicted revenue for the next quarter low?
does it reach 68 today?
Excellent revenue growth!!!!
"Nice call KNg, I believe the business is growing faster than what was mentioned in the past. The moving averages are moving here real quick. I sense a surge is coming."
I'm thinking of buying at this over sold price. I think it's a very good price to get at.
Heading higher everyday - do you know why? I'll tell you why...
