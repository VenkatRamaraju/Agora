Very Bad... I entered the wrong time... Lost a lot since i bought it 3 days ago... What the hell happen to this Stock ??? Up a little and Down again... super slow... a lot of news are not reflecting the true situation of some industries.... Trap !
management has cash flow management issue
"Look at the numbers: ODFL and JB hunt are like making a lot more earnings and revenue, but their market caps are way way higher than yell. Apples to apples you feel like Yell is worth $30. Get your paper out and make three columns and do the math for yourself: $ODFL, $JBHT, $YELL; Revenue, Earnings, Debt, Market Cap."
"The point when I saw declarations everywhere I thought they were bots or that they were made up till I was persuaded and gave it a try and genuinely I don't regret the move I made on the grounds that I invested my reserve funds in BTC Trading, and now my first speculation with him acquired me benefits of more than $87,000 worth of BTC and its still running! Arthur continues to convey and procure predictable benefits for me. He's awesome. if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on Te** le*gram @ArthurFX47."
Q3 out in the next days
"I see tons of JB hunt trucks. It's almost double the others, and I say that as a SNDR owner. Makes me want to invest in this as well."
Don't follow this stock a lot but seems expensive no?
Why are they going up. I mean it's good for my portfolio but I see nothing...
Crazy manipulation. The earnings report was a HUGE miss. JBHT will tank tomorrow. It will hit 52 week low in about 2 weeks according to the charts. I am happy that I sold my 5000 shares. will be back at $72 -$74
Not much can bring it down further. Lol
Amazing Earning results as expected... this is going to fly 
$200.00 soon!!!
J.B. Hunt Transport Services reached an all time high at 186.25
"Haulage is down with shuttered travel leisure, slow retail, the absence of sports, live entertainment sports"
still overvalued like it at 60
J.B. Hunt Transport Services reached an all time high at 194.75
why is this up on a miss?
"No load for truck completely, spot market is very dry. Its relieve , managers don't know real situation in market"
"Earnings miss has not happened more than 2 or 3 times in JBHT history.... So why is stock up on such bad news? The buzz that JBHT is preparing for sale is probably supported by the expensive, and flawed IT transition. There are numerous capital investments and outlays at HQ. But, who is shopping for a logistics company? Are company executives allowed to steer a publicly traded company into new ownership without telling current investors?"
Load prices for transportation last two weeks dropped about 10%They didnt told that in CChttps://www.dat.com/industry-trends/trendlines/van/national-rates
Great buying opportinity.. 22% upside!!! Argus target $109 and Wall St Journal $99!!! $ARCB recognized as most efficient and best supply chain logistics and trucking company!! Great Forward PE of 11!! Reporting excellent earnings results on Nov 2!!!$ODFL $KNX $SAIA $JBHT $LSTR $SNDR $MRTN $SNDR
Not worth $103 after hour . However future are weak . I think itâ€™s uptrends last 5 days will end. .
Eyes on this
Finally coming back up...................
CSX and JBHT reported earnings within 12 hours of each other. CSX reported lower intermodal volume. JBHT relies on intermodal. If CSX reported earlier during the trading day the drop in JBHT would be clear.. It seems some people knew the numbers as JBHT sold high at a volume 57 % above average on Thursday. It is not a level playing field.

CNBC FAST MONEY around 2:25PM PST just talked about the Earnings report; NOT FAVORABLE...It looks like the opinion is a SELL to me...We will see tomorrow...
Nice 
Wow up at. Very end hope it stays green tmrw !
"There seems to be a disconnect with share price and Earnings here. With many of trucking companies they are essentially overvalued even at bottom of barrel prices because their earnings have sucked. Yet, here it seems the share price is below the earnings. Interesting....I think this goes back up a little bit in short order, should stabilize there."
J.B. Hunt Transport Services is up 5.57% to 185.00
"Trucking sector manipulation. SNDR is up 6% too. No reason, no good news. These stocks act insane."
Comparing this to other valuations of trucking companies like $ODFL and $SAIA $JBHT $SNDR and $KNX it seems like YELL trades super low considering the fleet/revenue
JB Hunt Transport reached an all time high at 154.99
J.B. Hunt Transport Services reached an all time high at 199.89
Now at a 21 PE on next year's estimated earnings which have been falling. And forcasted eps growth over next 5 years is in single digits. What am I missing as far as this stock being very overvalued right now?
going down tomorrow morning
Covered at 100.55 .then long . Sold at 102 . Now short again.
"A week before earnings JBHT rose each day on 50 % average volume but after earnings volume doubled Average volume with a price surging 6 points. Now, it has dropped to 166 on higher volume than before earnings. Buying high and selling low is no way to go through life, son."
