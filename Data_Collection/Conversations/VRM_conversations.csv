He's back. You had a great call Greg. Riding it from $50!
"Hmm, if VRM is going bankrupt, how can they afford to pay $300m cash for a lender? I’ll say it again… VRM is not a miracle company, but they are not going broke, they are in growth phase, and this acquisition is a perfect example of their continued path. Proprietary lending is exactly what they needed, they said on their last ER that they were heading down this path and followed through rather quickly."
"According to Trustpilot, VRM has by far the worst reviews in the industry."
Lowered target to $5.
Vroom is down 7.35% to 20.66
"The losses are massive with a net loss around $70 mil each Qtr, won’t go up until they address that..."
"I’ve been watching this stock for past 2 months or so because one analyst said the company is a buy at $42. I want to take a shot at it but every time I look at it, it is in red."
$ 18.80 and the bounce started
The large dealer networks are now stealing massive share from the pure play online players. Its game over for VRM.
Vroom reached an all time low at 19.60
Happy I bought. My average is $20.75. Up over 7% in a week since I purchased. Guess luck was on my side.
"Pete, you can get a better online experience at any of the national dealers. This is a $2 stock."
I like the revenue growth a lot and the current price seems very attractive to me. But I checked their twitter to see what people are saying and almost everyone is complaining about their customer service. Probably going to skip for this reason alone.
Greg says it's the next Amazon
By summer 30;
A good buy price came in today with 500 shares keeping another capital for another 1000 if the price falls again
The volume is very small together with the small float it makes sense for the drop to look big but it is not
Yahoo! has been so bad lately - especially the VRM board. I like using http://alert-sounds.com/ now instead for my daily research.
Institutions hold tight ... The float is minimum .. The price is very interesting !! It is up to you to make twice as much money in a short time
Vroom reminds me when I first entered uxin a desert chat and a low price ... In the end I came out with 7-8 times profit
