It will go up. Just don’t panic.
hmm do you think it will bounce back to 50 again?
"A $500mm valuation for this business, given how poorly they have performed during the greatest used car boom in history, would be generous. For all you math wizards, that would put the stock at $5."
i bought my car from vroom. i loved it. will never go to a dealer again. it was super easy and they car came just as described
Market is up and we are down ??!!
The bleeding must stop! There is no reason for this haircut
"Four buy ratings from piper sandler, stifle, wells Fargo and wedbush lowest 46 and high as 60. This is going to fly in the near future."
New low wow I really want to buy it but just waiting to see when it#$%$ bottom
"Vroom offers better value for money than Carvana, they had about 1.16 billion in cash prior to the deal;deduct that from the total than the price to sales ratio is about 2 (which is still quite high).However, there will likely be small dealers going bust due to the pandemic, and that will be devided over Vroom, Carvana, etc. Carvana has good branding with the ''vending machine'', Vroom is doing a lot lately in promoting through advertising. Vroom also has certain things they should improve, especially CUSTOMER SERVICE. If they address customer service, I think clients will come back in the future as well. Now Vroom is primarely a value option, if service is included, they should chip away market share from Carvana.Vroom is already growing faster than Carvana in sales; and is growing fastest in the online segment if you dig deeper into the data. That's why I made a play on Vroom. If tomorrow it goes lower or it is a lot lower near the close I will add positions."
"1.38% % of Shares Held by All Insider // 73.14% % of Shares Held by Institutions // 74.16% % of Float Held by Institutions // 197 Number of Institutions Holding SharesAnd there is currently about 6-7% of all shares shorted, i think within the next 2 years there will be more shares owned by institutions than there are in float."
Wow just bleeding unreal I thought I was good to buy yesterday but nope not yet I’ll ha e to come back around in another week and see what is happen
It’s oversold now.
I dont really think that it is reasonable for a company to fall 25% beacuse they lost 44c instead of 39c! Am i missing some thing?
This industry is in its infancy. Seems like whoever first mover should win out. It will be harder for anyone to enter this market once a few big successful companies established the marketplace. All the small local car dealers in corner street could be gone for good. This new industry is going to change used car or even new car buying forever. Which companies to buy is the question. Don’t know which ones will win out. Big reward also.
bought 600 units for a quick buck. hope the tide turns soon
hurts

"1. Chip shortage + 2.cooper and steel up and price + 3. VRM grow strong and undervalued, that will make this stock go to ~$90 till Dec 1 2021.Guys, we're going to make some money $$$$$."
"$26 price is not realistic: this company is not worth $4b! It is worth $600mm max, or $6."
Huge risk reward. This could be $CVNA $VRM of China and rocket x20 like $NIO. Go big or go home.
Do anyone have an idea what is going on with Vroom? Despite all + signs its not changing much. Soon third quarter will be released and most of the analyst have given strong buy ratings.
This thing is getting destroyed like if VRM went bankrupt!!!
"Whoever said numbers don’t lie nailed it. In the third quarter, vroom made $3k per car BEFORE Selling, general and admin(sg&a). They spent $6,913 on sg&a per car sold.This is a terrible business. Try that trick on your own."
Worst investment..not a damn day in the green
Thanks for getting it James. These people are buying hope. They are going to lose a lot of money from here.
"Wow, what a buying opportunity. Stay the course on this one and you will be rewarded."
Common $31.25 i’ll buy another 1000
Will be back in the 40s soon. Vroom is a popular stock. Fundamentals don't matter in this case. Will go higher.
"Is it possible that the shorts are keeping this stock down?I’m buying this stock as an indirect way to buy more Carvana. CVNA kept going up while I was still buying and I was never able to build up the position I wanted. So it seems buying VRM is a good alternative. I buy VRM each day as it goes down because I’m not interested in what these stocks do short term, I’m interested in what they do long term!"
Are we ever going to hit $35 again?
"small co with huge revenue growth and huge growth for years. big deal...a little light on revenue next quarter. so what. i bought before earnings, it went up 7% from my cost basis and down 11% in after hours #$%$ trade. im happy with the report and guidance."
"vroom, vroom!"
"Get your engines started, ""VRRRRRM VRRRM VRM!"""
Great Super Bowl Ad - You would think that this creative ad combined with Vroom's full media campaign will lead to market share gains. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haXc74orwhg
What had changed here recently? Why the run up? It seems like I missed something.
Will end green today. Buy the dip

Whats going one ?
"Wow 12% down, I was planned to buy at $48 .. thank god narrow escape. I guess this script for longterm"

What you guys think price will be on Monday after Super bowl commercial?
This stock Vroomed hard today
This is solid point for buy
(http://Multistockalerts.com) is truly one of the best stock advice newsletters out there! Their daily emails give me all the information I need to trade more wisely each day. I rely heavily on their watchlists and recommend all traders should do the same!
"More explanations. I guess the analysts didn't like the guidance. VRM : Vroom -11% after top-line guidance disappoints • 4:25 PMVroom (NASDAQ:VRM) is down sharply after guiding for Q4 revenue of $372M to $414M vs. $403.5M consensus.The company expects a Q4 EPS loss of $0.35 to $0.41.In addition Vroom expects e-commerce unit sales of 10,500 to 11,500, implying 25% sequential growth and Q4 year over year growth of 74% at the middle of the guidance range. Guidance from Vroom also includes average e-commerce selling price per unit of $24,500 to $25,500 in Q4 and average ecommerce gross profit per unit of $2,050 to $2,150.""We increased the velocity of the Vroom flywheel, drove conversion and increased GPPU. We will continue to execute our plan and invest in the growth of our business as we transform the market for buying and selling used vehicles,"" says CEO Paul Hennessy."
The BEST used car market in history and these guys still have a massive loss every qtr... My advice is to invest elsewhere...
Their losses every Qtr are insane
Let's squeeze these shorts !
"Poor company, weak leadership, propped up by covid, losing money, bearish ratings everywhere,....boggles my mind why anyone would want this stock except to short it."
"Historical price to sales ratio's for similar companies in the industry have had 0,5 price to sales ratio's. Which is 1/4 of the current price; I do not think Vroom will hit that level because they seem to be growing faster.It's trading at just under 2 price to sales ratio for 2021. Perhaps wait and see approach is safer. There is no strenght, after opening green, there is hardly anyone buying. On every pop it seems to be unloading."
"Alright, Alright, Alright"
36 tomorrow
Seems strong....maybe it will bust through $51?
Sft is a better buy
"Still a lot of debts, and over valued"
1.16 billion in cash // 1.65 billion total assets377 million in liabilities4.52 billion USD total valuation for Vroom.Next quarter online sales is expected to grow 75% (that's the middle of their range)
Bottom ?
"I bought November 20th $35 puts @40.80 yesterday but I am down even though the stock is down, any idea ?"
"Looking better, but still want to see flat on a down day. Up on a down day would be a better sign."
They will get it together soon or later it’s worth it long termTo buy it but not till they still there sell off
"Following the results, Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem maintained a Buy rating and a price target of $60 (37% upside potential). In a note to investors, the analyst said, “we believe the Q1 bar was set sufficiently low, and shares should work with evidence of gradually building unit performance and stabilizing GPU [gross profit per unit]. All in, our positive FY21 thesis still stands, but given ongoing execution hiccups, we are tapping the brakes in the near term.”"
Follow that market
50% off all time highs... I see this trending up again soon. Maybe this Monday.
BUY THE DIP
"Vroom's ""mistake"" is that they issued guidance for a 10% lower than expected Q3. Carvana didn't do that. They said due to COVID they weren't going to issue guidance. And their officers wisely profited in exercising their options on a bloated stock price. Oh just wait for CVNA to issue guidance. While we are comparing the two companies, and certainly CVNA has a much larger piece of the action (currently), VRM's surprise % on EPS was double that of CVNA. Yet the two stocks have gone in opposite directions off earnings released within a week. The online used car industry is going to blossom in the next year."
I'm glad I got out at $43. I assume the quarterly revenue isn't what the market is still implying it is. I'll be watching for an entry though.
why sudden drop?? My average price is 30.. do I need to hold or sell in little loss? Thanks in advance.
"The better question Farid is, ""why are you still here""? A 10 year old can sell a dollar for 90 cents. That's what this company is doing."
$VRM JP Morgan says favorable set up in the near to medium term .. OVERWEIGHT rating w/ $70 PT

Probably the reason for the drop: roll out of vaccine is about 6 months ahead of schedule.Investors might expect people to buy a car in person more once there is a vaccine rolled out.
"VRM has a 50% upside, now is the time to buy the deep. easy money . Let's go."
Im in 32.40 5k shares! Position for long term.
Wth happened to the move up?
"Bought 122 shares @ $35.14 per.Was lucky- Initially tried buying @ $36.00, but the internet was slow."
I am still worried for this. I be buyer around 10-12. I have sold over $50 after IPO. It's long time.
Someone please show me the math on how this company is worth $5b. Thank you in advance.
Where are the Robinhooders when you need them?

holding strong!
"Be careful, I bought a car through Vroom and my hub has a serious software error that they have not fixed after several days of calls and emails... growing pains or poor communation= poor management. I'm considering a short position."
I’ll buy this at 25.00 max
vrrrroooommmmm
Vroom is down 5.85% to 35.74
This stock should be up and CVNA is up 6%?? that dont make sense....
"Bought before market close, not a serious position, but Just want to see how they do given their revenue growth"
"VRM : Vroom EPS beats by $0.07, beats on revenue • 4:08 PMVroom (NASDAQ:VRM): Q3 Non-GAAP EPS of -$0.29 beats by $0.07; GAAP EPS of -$0.31 beats by $0.07.Revenue of $323M (-5.1% Y/Y) beats by $11.77M.Shares -6%."
$35 tomorrow
"Good riddance Dave Jones, hopefully the new CFO can do something better to raise value of this Junk"
If you compare this to CVNA the metrics are way better. It does 25% of the business CVNA does and it has only 9% of the employees. Market cap is almost only 12% of CVNA's. VRM has 60% of the cash that CVNA has currently. It's a lot more undervalued and realistic when it comes to valuation. Debt per capita is also similar. Either CVNA should be trading at $120 vs VRM's current price or VRM should be trading at $90 vs CVNA's current price. if you go strictly on the metrics VRM is the better deal no matter how you slice it. If for some reason this business gets hit unexpectedly with some major crisis of sorts CVNA is a lot more exposed than VRM.It would hemorrhage cash. VRM is more compact and would be more nibble with adjustments of any sort. Another thing that swayed me towards VRM is that CVNA's CEO/Founder/President was charged was financial crimes (bank fraud) some years ago. He and his son are also accused of insider trading currently in a current lawsuit (He gives me the impression as a unscrupulous character). I don't short stocks but if I did CVNA would be on my target list. I only compared the 2 big boys in this niche sector.
Vroom bullish pattern tomorrow we will see $27 to $29 range.
The bullish statement:The old way of buying a car will slowly deminish due to measures during a covid period that makes the small local car dealers go bankrupt. This segment of the market will move to other players including Vroom.Vroom has a high growth rate of its revenue going forward. The mid range estimate for next quarter is 25% QoQ and 75% YoY. Which are insanely high rate.
"Remember, the pre-ipo funding rounds were done as low as $2. Food for thought. The company has not lived up to its expectations and was built for the stock market, not as a durable long term business. Sell your stock."
Shytza is doomed
Goes much higher . Baille Gifford owns at $51.00
"Holding 38.50 USD so strongly, oh my"
"So, am I seeing this correctly, are revenues in Q3 estimated to be less than Q2 ?"
Gotta love the committed insiders. Not one officer or director bought stock on the move from $75 to $27.
Namaste
Look for another breakdown !! I see a buy at $12 !!
"Carvana's marketcap is roughly 9 times greater than Vroom. Carvana's revenue is only 5 times greater Vroom. Based on revenue, Vroom's marketcap should be 1/5 of Carvana. That would give Vroom a marketcap of over $10 billion. This translates to a share price of over $84. If their revenue growth was close to Carvana, watch out."
"Okay, so any idea as to why VRM is down today???"
come on $60s
It’s the same business model as Carvana with less inventory?This should trade between 50 - 70 right now !
Carmax will drag this down
Lot of bagholders here I see. All time low this morning.
BUY NOW TOMORROW 10% up
"4.76 billion valuation -> 1.16 billion cash (last quarter) -> 3.6 billion valuationMid range +-400m revenue next quarter (+25% quarter on quarter)Based on next quarter 3,6 / 1,6 = 2,25 Price to sales.Key factor is the growth rate; if it remains high Vroom will do well over time."
"They have to prove themselves for consecutive quarters before it will pop. They are getting into financing, which is where Carvana is creating value, and I think when that comes to fruition the cash flow will improve. They are not a miracle company, but they are not broke... over 1b cash on hand. They are in the growth phase."
i bought at $27.16.
Just received a buy rate from bank of america. $70 very soon
$32 LONG and STRONG
Strong Buy!
Look at rocket auto it is vroom inventory possible big news coming
"In at 26.05, will trade this buy to 30 and “holding” with a 1 year end goal of low ave of estimates (37ish). Patient trade but I like the LTerm prospects. Ask yourself… who has ever liked buying a used car from a dealer??? Would rather save 10%!"

"Anyone worried with jobs report just out, the US labor participation rate now the lowest EVER in our history !!"
I have been telling you to sell for months. Management does not know what they are doing. They are losing money on each car that they sell. It is a complex business and execution is tough. They have failed and will burn through their cash over next 24 months.
Back in. 1000 x 32.72 ouch. Maybe bought too soon?
I got in at $37.38. A little too soon but I'm pretty happy with the position.
This is crazy. Carvana revenue grew 18% last quarter and it goes up from 265 to 320. It did drop a lot in the after market before it shot up the next day when all the analysts gave a thumbs up. Vroom's revenue goes up 25% and drops 15% in the after market. Will Vroom do the same as Carvana? It is a crazy chaotic market.
"Ummm...I just checked the financials on this thing. So let me get this straight:- Company has never made money, loses massive amounts every quarter...- Company has sold over 700M in preferred securities to stay afloat- Company has way more debt/preferred liabilities than assets with an ever-increasing negative book value, thus the common shares currently own exactly 0% of the company. - Company was still able to go public and offload all their public shares that were worth 0% of the company on the willing market for 400M. How? Why did anyone buy this failing company? I get that the revenue is increasing, but they are funding it entirely through a ponzi-like mountain of ever-increasing debt. They are losing more money the larger they grow! Clearly the debt market got that as it looks like they had to start issuing preferred securities to get more money and their interest expenses are thus mounting. If this goes BK common shareholders and most of the preferred securities get zilch. Be careful!"
Thinking of making a position on this company but don’t know when to enter.

Rocket company acquisition makes sense Jit will cut costs
"Hmm, if VRM is going bankrupt, how can they afford to pay $300m cash for a lender? I’ll say it again… VRM is not a miracle company, but they are not going broke, they are in growth phase, and this acquisition is a perfect example of their continued path. Proprietary lending is exactly what they needed, they said on their last ER that they were heading down this path and followed through rather quickly."
Seeing multiple Vroom commercials on CNN. A positive?
New 52 week high next week for sure.

"You people are not following the industry, just a single company-Carvana. 5 of the 7 dealer chains sell used cars directly. They are all spending a lot of money on virtual. You can buy a car online and have it deleiverd. You can also send it back for a full refund. All 5 said companies are selling more used cars than VRM and doing it profitably!"
BUY the dip
"Sold CVNA with a very tidy profit. Just jumped in VRM today. 34% short interest in CVNA is the reason for the price spikes. Shorts keep getting squeezed but think that's over and reality will hit hard. I bought my 911 on Carvana last year in January and had a pretty good experience. Based on where both companies are now.. VRM seems like the better option. Their site is better, pictures better, more inventory. Although I do feel CVNA has better high end cars. This is my only gripe. CVNA has 5 911's pending sale, VRM has zero and doesn't seem to get them often. High end cars sell within hours of listing, trust me I was looking daily for weeks!I feel people like me are the ones really driving the online car market. Bought a Panamera Turbo in December. I tried my best to find the car I wanted on CVNA and VRM.. really anywhere online. I ended up buying local from a small specialty shop. We go up from here. I don't lose."
Wow still falling unreal I want to buy but can’t till this stops
"Look at the volume, it's almost 85% all buying."
How do they sell cars for negative gains? There expected to take losses well into the future and it looks like the more money they touch the more money they loose?
Shorts are having a field day in the market ... Only Reddit investors can save this market.
"Very good news for 2021 .two things: chip shortage, steel is up in price.. .There gonna be full year of chip shortage and the automakers are the last to get it (first apple dell and others...at the end automakers), Ford said there gonna lose $3B because of it..meaning we will see super high price cars and that will push the second hand market higher... thats why vroom claim for triple digit for full year 2021... i see double stock price in 8 months"
"They lacked inventory, which now they are ramping up. Next quarter will be huge."
Break out this week ? Time for a reversal
Lowering target from $12 to 9 !
There's no way VRM isn't the future of used car sales. It essentially replaces dealerships completely.

VRM is UP approx 8% off it's trading low for the day. What does that tell you? Smart money is long and buying off this news that has dropped the stock beyond reasonable levels.
"by the way to expose how clueless shorts are, this company just raised 500 million dollars through maybe 5 or 10 percent dilution, something they couldn't even dream of doing while ""private"". it was private when it was a basically in an incubator with maybe 2 or 3 hubs nationwide. unless you are unaware of google, check out how many hubs are going up by the month thanks to raises like this that can now only do BECAUSE they are public. this is the kind of knowledge shorts don't have because they have no creativity and only think small. thats why left got out of the game. at least he had the sense to notice that the path to success has completely changed now that data prowess and delivery time are the only things that truly matter. heck amazon is a tire fire of a brand from a ""love"" metric, yet they dominate only because of this total control of data and delivery time. watch and learn shorts!"
Should I put 40k in this all at once after it's huge drop?
"I’ve been watching this stock for past 2 months or so because one analyst said the company is a buy at $42. I want to take a shot at it but every time I look at it, it is in red."

"Today's announced acquisition of CarStory is huge. This introduces analytics and AI, and gives Vroom a competitive advantage over Carvana. VRM is very undervalued, and has significant upside in the near term. Don't take my word for it though, read JP Morgan's recent investment thesis on VRM. I did, it's impressive."
Have you read the reviews online? It seems worse than going to a dealership. Carvana is vertically integrated. Vroom outsources everything
Easy buying opportunity
Very sad. Bagholders have been flushed down the commode of tears in this name since the IPO.

"Chris Bottiglieri -- Exane BNP Paribas -- AnalystThanks for taking the question. So the first one is on the financing business. Can you elaborate more there?

You know, I chose the word opportunistic as we're [Inaudible] at all supposing not surprisingly, one of the things we think about it is [Inaudible] versus buy. And -- but here should be the takeaway.

Any real chance Carvana buys VRM at this level to take out their main competition? What price to buy them out? Thanks
He's doing you a favor. Take has advice and move on.
"I owned VRM for a short time. I sold simply because of their reviews. I can't own a company that has so many unhappy (and I mean #$%$ customers. Many trusted sites give around 2 stars. I hope they clean up their act and you all make money, but I'll wait and see."

"nothing to worry about. the story is intact is the bottom line. shorts are going to do what shorts always do which is load you up on fear and distortion. they're growing. people love buying cars this way, and cars are getting simpler over time so buying online like a phone makes more and more sense in step with the tech.dont fall for the noise. ill be buying more every month as ive been dollar cost averaging into this since the last time it was in the 30s."
Boy this sight isn’t working right or up to par with others
Why is this falling everyday and everyone here is quiet about it. Anything I missed? All I know is that the company forecasted a bit softer sales but nothing wild!
"i think ,it s a good buying option,,,my idea it will be 40 s easily next week..good luck to all"
Sold 34.61 made a little over 400 dollars. Open or to buy it again. X 200 x 3 will see how it goes
vroong... vroong.. nono vroom....
"The cash is being burned. But for the cash, stock would be at $5 today rather than in 2 years."
going up
On what basis is it a buying opportunity?
"ill take it. expenses are super high, but what did you expect when they have to run and gun against Carvana. I like the strategies and the growth. they're probably making a third more per car because of the surge in used car prices, but once those expenses come down, that short term catalyst won't matter as much. great earnings overall. GLTA"
Just bought more
Where’s Greg? We need his insights. Must be focused on that other “great” business-HIMS.
Vroom is my next NIO/tesla. Boa says fair value is 65$. It beat revenue estimates but still went down 25-30%. It has good balance sheet. Equity is still +. Analysts expect 50% growth/year for next 5 yrs. Income statement is negative like any other growing company. This is how tesla was treated for a while. Patience guys patience. The online car industry is the future. Carvana & vroom are comparable in all aspects except physical presence & market-likability
VRM couldn't make money from 762M in 2nd quarter revenue and for the past 4 quarters during a time when used car prices went up 35%. This is a $10 stock.
Scared for the market to close because VRM is going to report earnings and we know what that usually means!
Bought at $33.30
Never going to be close to Carvana 
"VRM catch up to carvanna, they might after Superbowl commercial"
Valuation matters. This should trade at 8x ebitda max! That gets you to $4-6 per share.
Hurts but I can tell you it’s a good buy under $40. Numbers met and guidance is in line. 80% revenue growth in 2021 IMO. Great balance sheet. Vroom and Carvana is here to stay.
"Kids coming of age now don't want the right of passage of haggling at the car dealership. In the meantime, dealerships are getting crushed by low foot traffic, furloughed sales staff and bitter margins. You will talk to your grandchildren of the good old days of buying a car before Vroom and Carvana Amazon'ed dealerships and eventually merged."
better buy now!! trending UP UP!!!
idk why i still own this
"VRM was a great buy few days back. Better days are ahead with less infection rate, spring fever, summer ahead, stimulus in the saving account, opening businesses, vacations, etc..... and all these point to one thing that is we need to buy vehicles to move around. VRM will move close to early March price $45. Will hold and see what happens, either bust(no worries) or boom."
"April, 2021 : In 2020, Vroom attracted well-known investors such as Bill gates and Bernard Arnault, which was one of the main reasons behind its stellar stock market performance in the first eight months of last year.Renowned value investor Bill Miller seems to be bullish on the company as well. In an interview with CNBC last week, Miller said, ""That's a name we think you could make multiple times your money in the next three or four years,"" suggesting the company is now undervalued after shedding 33% of its market value since last September."
buy and hold!
"CARG will limit their growth as long as they continue operating as an online auto marketplace for dealerships rather than a used car company. Zillow has provided the playbook in buying/selling their own real estate. They use their technology and their brand to make profits from real estate. No reason CarGurus can't do the same in the auto market, but they are instead content with just acting as an auto advertising agency for car dealerships. The technology is there, but they've allowed $CVNA and $VRM to take the idea while they sat on their hands. It's a shame...the used car market is on fire."
After loosing tons of money on that stock. I wont jump in unless it goes below 30
"Not that this really means anything, but Bill Gates has a large amount of shares of this company."
35 usd would be a nice entry
I have 800 units at 31. can come back next year to see if something survives of this investment
"Welp, my sell order filled...should fly high now"
I did some growth comparisons on some of the stocks that people have mentioned on Carvana conversations board. And Carvana stands out as the best growth stock without any doubt. Carvana has done an astonishing exceptional job in the past year growing at high speed through the pandemic. This is the comparison:$CVNA revenues grew 41% for the past year$VRM revenues grew 14% for the past year$CARG revenues declined by 6% for the past year$KMX revenues declined by 7% for the past year$PAG revenues declined by 12% for the past yearLooks like Carvana is taking market shares away from competitors very aggressively. The Carvana management has really done a very impressive job!

Let's get back to 44 and break through that resistance.
Is this heading to $1?
