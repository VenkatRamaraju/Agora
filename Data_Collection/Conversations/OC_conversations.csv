"On Tuesday of this week on CNBC's morning show with Jim, Carl and David as they were discussing Pfizer's vaccine Jim mentioned, possibly an accident that OC was providing the vials for the vaccines, billions of vials. After reading what type of glass it needs to be to withstand the temps for storage I can see why the executives are loading up on shares also this past week."

OC is up 6.35% to 66.99
"So let me see if I've got this straight. All these downgraders think that all these thousands of structures that the hurricanes destroyed will be rebuilt without insulation?They're either manipulators or stupid, or both."
calling a bottom right here at 44.5

Owens-Corning is up 5.43% to 72.75
gotta love these overlooked underpriced stocks that come to life before earnings are announced.......long OC around 63.50!!:)
"One day, when i get bored and sell this, it will go up 5-10 in a few days"
Time for a management change? Almost 50% drop YTD and no recovery in sight.
this stock can't even rally after a golden cross. too much debt
stock is useless garbage. I guess 3 percent+ gdp still can't help it out. sad!

The building materials market is bearish short and long term. Especially roofing related products.Short term bearish - cost of raw materials going up and labour shortages due to covid its going to be hard to fulfill maximum revenue.Long term bearish - building materials are becoming of better quality and lasting longer so that means less building materials being bought.People are also trending towards metal roofing over shingle roofing for much obvious reasons. People are also trending towards spray foam to insulate their homes.There is no way this will gain starting sometime soon.Construction business owner 13+ years

What the heck is going on here???? Two MAJOR hurricanes and still no uptick in the stock. Bad management? I hate that today CEOs and upper management are paid so much to concentrate on quarterly earnings but they are and this team has FAILED miserably.
Added a few more shares....lol
"never seen a more downtrodden stock. everyone is bearish on housing, time to get in"
if someone wanted to buy it out $85 is fair value consider AWI and MAS both trade at similar ebitda to Enterprise value and P/e ratios. just saying
Why the push above 70?
up quite a bit today ~~ anticipation of strong earnings coming up!! long homebuilders lennar and owens corning!!
Is OC investing in the Hemp space?
"Infrastructure, climate change and innovation: three realities that make Owens Corning an excellent long term investment. Just my opinion."
wow all time highs in stock market and this thing is off 50 percent? will fall to 25 in recession
OC is up 7.81% to 40.99

If you got 20-30 years like me left to invest there are some great opportunities in this market you just need to be patient and do your research don't chase the valuation trades right now.. here is one for you :) $OC
"Lower rev's, lower operating income, lower earnings and this thing is up? This market is not real. https://media.owenscorning.com/press-release/company-news/owens-corning-reports-full-year-and-fourth-quarter-2019-results"
OC is down -4.91% to 82.95
Will the hurricanes require full capacity of the OC manufacturing plants if either hurricane hits the Gulf? How has the last shingle price increase been received in the market?

OC reached a new 52 Week Low at $52.94
It has been a long time waiting ... great job! Finally we change the direction and it is good for employees and investors
Iam in since today.... let see where this puppy will go!
Time to ring the register
Does this have a bottom?
no increase from hurricane? mistake
guess not
Nice beat people of OC. Strong revenue and earnings gains yoy. Improvement in all three segments of the business.
This ones not looking to hot for the next month or two... I'd put your money elsewhere
incredible. garbage company AWI misses earnings and rallies while OC destroys estimates and falls.
Looks like the big boys are picking up cheap shares
"OC is dead to me, sold yesterday and bought Amazon."
How can this go down a 300 point up day??
Anybody believe this will go up at all if earnings are good?
"Huge movement today and large volume. Given it's conservative valuation, my guess someone big is accumulating. Maybe someone from Omaha?"

"Despite Owens Corning seeing a first negative net income, their cash levels have hit a record after rising 305% over 2019-20. You can read their full financial review @ecoshares on Instagram, they only review companies that have some kind of role against fighting climate change (Owens Corning is no1 on the 100 Best Corporate Citizens List)."
want free trade? your on the wrong page.
this stock is incapable of rallying on good news

screw this company.

golden cross today
$50 tomorrow. With all these storms workers can’t keep up with making these shingles. It’s like boom town this year.
Inflation is killing companies like OC. Massive tax cuts in a growing economy will do that.
I guess hurricanes can't even cause this dog to break the voodoo curse at $70. pathetic
OC is down 4.96% to 54.01
OC reached a 52 Week low at 29.75
Why the drop?
forward ebitda of 1.3 to 1.5 billion. even 10 times ebitda gets this thing to $120ish in a few years
OC was up because of the hurricane and probably not any more down side until earnings.
OC is up 11.22% to 34.60

new 52 week low on exceedingly light olume. interesting
company's. earnings have gone up 500 percent in 6 years but the stock is only up 20 percent. cyclical s make terrible long term investment s
OC is down 4.97% to 55.61
"apparently massive ebitda, major hurricane damage and a robust economy isn't enough to boost these shares. Mr market is ill right now"
OC reached a new 52 Week Low at 61.82
Owens-Corning is up 9.24% to 41.50
I guess so....
"So shares under accumulation by NYC based HG Vora. Probably pushing for breakup or sale, per report. While OC is on three distinct businesses, they are all related to construction, both residential and commercial, as well as other non-construction end users. They are stronger together than apart. Hold strong management! Wall Street and Toledo based companies don’t have a happy history."
"OC is going to make a big move. To see which way, google whichwayisuphaha.com. Oh well, can't let the paid posters have all the fun."
Owens-Corning is down 5.80% to 65.65
We love Hurricanes...should be the tag line for Oc.
this looks to have some legs. high volume. chance of a run up this week or two
other companies in their industry are trading at twice the p/e and twice the book value. ENOUGh! this is going back to old highs and will break 100
Owens-Corning is up 4.93% to 70.19
"fed should take notes at what cyclical s are saying. stop raising, there is deflation not inflation"
"Good news!! The majority are institutional and a ton of investors like me who know this stock will misbehave in certain cycles... housing was atrocious this past year and OC held up well - and once again will flourish even more with the turn... the only sellers now are profit takers... we will see the next 6 mos. steadily climbing... so if you don’t want to miss anymore upside, get in before the end of the day - first thing tomorrow will be too late! Anytime is good of course but most upside starts now..."
This is a funny stock..I will wait. Good earning though

"Owens Corning Preferred Contractors - used two. First one replaced my entire roof in 2011 with complete OC System (Duration shingles and ridge vent stating 15 year wind warranty). . . . only to NOT use Duration shingles for ridge vent but rather 5 years warranty supreme shingles - without telling me! FALSE SALE!Second was hired to repair wind damage - about four feet of the ridge vent - and used ProEdge with shadow line resulting in mis-match to existing roof (hey, glad he did not use pink shingles!!)Preferred Contractors? How about adding requirement criteria to include QUALITY WORKMANSHIP!OC - Feel free to reference claim 20562328 (resulting in terrible customer satisfaction and loss of a previously loyal consumer)"
will this thing ever break $60? no respect
