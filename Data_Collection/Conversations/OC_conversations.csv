still no bottom unreal
"Despite Owens Corning seeing a first negative net income, their cash levels have hit a record after rising 305% over 2019-20. You can read their full financial review @ecoshares on Instagram, they only review companies that have some kind of role against fighting climate change (Owens Corning is no1 on the 100 Best Corporate Citizens List)."
If you got 20-30 years like me left to invest there are some great opportunities in this market you just need to be patient and do your research don't chase the valuation trades right now.. here is one for you :) $OC
"On Tuesday of this week on CNBC's morning show with Jim, Carl and David as they were discussing Pfizer's vaccine Jim mentioned, possibly an accident that OC was providing the vials for the vaccines, billions of vials. After reading what type of glass it needs to be to withstand the temps for storage I can see why the executives are loading up on shares also this past week."
"Huge movement today and large volume. Given it's conservative valuation, my guess someone big is accumulating. Maybe someone from Omaha?"
if someone wanted to buy it out $85 is fair value consider AWI and MAS both trade at similar ebitda to Enterprise value and P/e ratios. just saying
no increase from hurricane? mistake
"Government stimulus and voluntary oil production cuts. It makes me wonder if any of this is based on reality.Reality is coming though. No matter how hard the $oc!al!sts try, reality always catches up with you. IIII$mro $cdev $qep"
Time for a management change? Almost 50% drop YTD and no recovery in sight.
"Infrastructure, climate change and innovation: three realities that make Owens Corning an excellent long term investment. Just my opinion."
"Good news!! The majority are institutional and a ton of investors like me who know this stock will misbehave in certain cycles... housing was atrocious this past year and OC held up well - and once again will flourish even more with the turn... the only sellers now are profit takers... we will see the next 6 mos. steadily climbing... so if you don’t want to miss anymore upside, get in before the end of the day - first thing tomorrow will be too late! Anytime is good of course but most upside starts now..."
wow all time highs in stock market and this thing is off 50 percent? will fall to 25 in recession
Nice beat people of OC. Strong revenue and earnings gains yoy. Improvement in all three segments of the business.
"So shares under accumulation by NYC based HG Vora. Probably pushing for breakup or sale, per report. While OC is on three distinct businesses, they are all related to construction, both residential and commercial, as well as other non-construction end users. They are stronger together than apart. Hold strong management! Wall Street and Toledo based companies don’t have a happy history."
The building materials market is bearish short and long term. Especially roofing related products.Short term bearish - cost of raw materials going up and labour shortages due to covid its going to be hard to fulfill maximum revenue.Long term bearish - building materials are becoming of better quality and lasting longer so that means less building materials being bought.People are also trending towards metal roofing over shingle roofing for much obvious reasons. People are also trending towards spray foam to insulate their homes.There is no way this will gain starting sometime soon.Construction business owner 13+ years
this stock can't even rally after a golden cross. too much debt
am I the only one that sees tremendous value in the O.C.?
yikes glad I held off. will buy if it drops some more
"I was behind a Lowe's delivery truck today, it was a full load of Owens Corning insulation."
other companies in their industry are trading at twice the p/e and twice the book value. ENOUGh! this is going back to old highs and will break 100
