"Try a new sector plant base, NSP Naturally Splendid has rights to sell and distribute Naterra plant base products and are in talks to build a facility"
why is going down ??
Does the 5% tariff for goods from Mexico have anything to do with the $5.40 drop? SYY imports a lot of veges from Mexico.
"A PEG of .7 based on 53% 5yr annual growth rate. If 53% is true, it’s a compelling value.is 53% annual growth possible?????"
No Randy. i know this business. They are working with Kroger to keep a few of their drivers working. All the restaurants closed is part of their business that might reopen in another month. The big hit are the schools and collages along with sports venues. schools will not open till maybe Sept. I will buy SYY but it will be at $28.00. That will be a good buy in 30 days.
"Long term continued growth and returns, normally slower than most, but consistent!"
"SYY, Destination moon."
"Will $SYY to begin delivery of little known $SHMP out of La Coste, Tx just down the road from us in SA??? Get your $SHMP boots on if this is the case."
Need to watch for higher highs
"Ooooh All time high, I like that, big selloff coming soon? Would love to short this one."
The MCD drive through is packed!
If there is no comment last 20 days it seems time to buy some
"I Zacks says Sell, then it's time to buy."
"It's a good time to buy/add SYY here. Just look around, a lot more people are dining out nowadays due to the robust economy."
"Can anyone shed some light on this drop? I have held SYY for over 10 yrs, good dividends, was expecting a split some time in the near future?"
86! I told this Shorty Mc Bear there are special forces here....Is it food inflation? Volume has to be off at least 20%.....but some obviously believe the company should be valued higher than 2019
time to fall
Off the charts overpriced. Will go down in the next correction. Next correction starts as soon as January 6.
Sysco is down 4.92% to 55.47
Sysco shares have lost about 37.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -12%.
Good stuff Sysco.https://myblacktea.blog/2018/08/15/syscogoals/
Is this a good time to purchase SYY shares?
Mid $80s by Oct. 2020.
SYY reached a 52 Week low at 59.64
Traditionally splits around the 54 mark.
2019 FY Q4 was 1.10. Now they are at 0.29 and people are getting excited?
SSY has some more room to fall before an upside. Its to early in covid damage for profitability.
sales force turnover rate is alarming. hemoraging sales staff
"What drives this stock up since earnings? Which were terrible, but expected to be. Is this a re-opening play? I can see that but not why it jumps this last week."
"Lots of protesters will be eating out, should bode well for SYY. My $0.02."
It will retreat to fill the gap at 71.45 and stay +/- .50 around there. Service business...as usual...
Muted Shorty McShortBear. Annoying.
"If you missed the roller coaster with beyond meats , NSP Naturally Splendid is just starting out plant base products"
"Buy SYY on price drops and take it to the bank. Vaccine cometh soon... PS, I am in the biotech industry."
"Bottom LineWe're a bit apprehensive about Sysco because despite more capital being deployed in the business, returns on that capital and sales have both fallen. But investors must be expecting an improvement of sorts because over the last five yearsthe stock has delivered a respectable 77% return. In any case, the current underlying trends don't bode well for long term performance so unless they reverse, we'd start looking elsewhere."
Sysco is down 5.61% to 60.43
sell now they are going to show horrible numbers.
"What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Sysco this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that’s not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Sysco carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -27.53%."
SYY reached a new All Time High at 68.22
Nice ride from 27
so we move up b4 positive earnings and then it's going to drop like always? I'll be taking profits this time! cheers
What are the chances we see a stock offering soon to pay down some debt? I’ve seen a large uptick in stock prices lately by companies who need cash to take advantage of the recent run-up in prices
poor mgt. now they have Monday's off. calling it mindfull monday. sit home and watch westerns
"Used to work in the restaurant industry in Houston. Have loved this company for a while now. Bought some last fall with the shut-down and economic dip (in at $51). Not a large amount - I bought into a bunch of things - this is just one. BUT I like the yield and am looking for it to just sit and grow. If it dips - I may buy more... Not sure what all the ""short"" talk is here - but that seems to create more opportunities for the long-holds..."
Why would I pay 81 bucks for a company that is projected to earn at best 1.58 ???I guess Cramer will pump it hard tonightthat would be a good time to sell ...
what happened today at 3:00
"SYY,Stock should touch $50 today as money managers have to fill in the numbers before the end of the quarter which is 4 PM￼.Truth be told this is a strong strong company"
Hello $70 is around the bend. People eating out a lot more. This trend is bodes well for Sysco stock. Next quarter earnings is shaping up to be fat and juicy.
What is the news for this 8% pop? I see nothing at all
"Sysco’s largest customer is Aramark .... college feeding , stadium feeding , business and industry feeding , school feeding , ..... prison feeding ... ok one segment is up ... the last one ."
I’m selling my Sysco. I’m very concerned about them selling property in Houston. This once great company is going the way of Rykoff. This happen when you don’t have anyone from a foodservice sales background run the company.
SYY reached a 52 Week low at 31.70
"Sysco still has major accounts with hospitals schools retirement homes and￼restaurants etc etc they will still be doing better then us foods that still order on a consistent basis even with this pandemonium￼￼ syy you know this is a safe stock it’s just going to jump back up to $85, summertime when all this blows over just facts sit on your eggs while you got them￼￼"
Lol when you forgot you bought this and glance and your Postion is up 25 percent or 2 k
"Still haven't Shorted this yet. Stock is just acting VERY perky. Waiting for her to jump above $85. :-) But its coming, will definitely and very happily Short SYY in a big way before market close today, to hold through earnings release and realize a big profit tomorrow upon her price collapse."
"What do you guys think of smaller peer, Chefs' Warehouse (CHEF)?"
Down to 2007 levels that's what they get for terminating everyone in LV
earning expectations is high
"Zacks Consensus EstimateThis food distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.59 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -25.3%.Revenues are expected to be $13.58 billion, down 7.4% from the year-ago quarter."
"Okay...I stated SYY will starts to dip in 1-2 weeks, well it starting to do so by either today or next Monday. Have fun!"
"Mitch it will turn around but with the Schools and Collages out till probably next year. It will not sky rocket.I am still looking at $28.00 BUT i am going to have to look at that in a couple of weeks... it might be much lower. Sysco is dumping product now but that is not going to save them that much in Taxes, Hope they don't go bankrupt, it would put many other vendors out of business. I would not put it past them to bankrupt to get out of some debt. at least stretch out the vendors for a few years. I know a lot of people that have stock that are shorting to protect their money. Hope it works out."
When will AMZN buy this one ?
53 week high....it is simple....one banker says to the CFO...let us keep your stock at 90% of previous highs as you watch sales and profits plummet.. .just give us the underwriting of your next debt offering or refinancing
"Not exactly robust profits coming out of the Foodservice segment for the next while - IMO. Pent up demand yes - but passing on inflationary costs, debt payment, staffing issues & labor costs will be a drag. Oh ya, Delta….. Passing costs onto consumers will be a problem. Sorry, not a basher but that’s my DD. Feel free to rip me!!"
the sales force turnover had become alarming
SYY is down 8.59% to 32.05
Sysco carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of +7.69%
"""Even though spreads have widened, they've cheapened things up to make sure the deals go well. They desperately need cash and they don't want to have to go to lines of credit if they don't have to."""
high employee turnover not a good sign

Everyday it goes up a little... with Virus problems with restaurants and schools... no way they can go up. August 10th they report. should be down $10 by then.... Then maybe look at buying. That is how you play this game.
"Still Short SYY. Was hoping she would sell off into the close, but looks like that might not happen. Still gonna be a successful, winning trade for me to celebrate. :-) Gonna Cover SYY around 3:50 ET, and then immediately do my Pure Earnings Short Sell of LYFT, which has luckily popped back up a bit."
Order set at $78.09
Folks.....you have to look at the future and the cut of expenses.....that is what is driving up SYY. Educate yourself!
pps dropping tomorrow?
SYY is down -100.00% to 0.00
I find it fascinating that SYSCO has recovered after so many restaurants are closed and or operating at 50%. It is almost like they don't operate in the food supply business. This whole market is unbelievable.
Is there any news on Sysco working on autonomy?
Earnings will push to 60.00 (before release date) biggest in North America .
Short ahead of earnings they will be horrible
Purchased 4000 shares back in 1974 for .14....Oh what should I do with al these splits.
"Goldman will LOSE, and they know it.... the bad publicity will cost them even more than the actual settlement costs.= WHY I am speculating that : Very quietly, in private phone conversations, GS is trying to engineer a takeover of UNFI by a buyer who will DROP the lawsuit.My guess is that SYY will try to buy out UNFI based on: 1) SYY took down additional $1.5 Billion from their bank line of credit2) SYY sold $4 BILLION of new bonds at rates much higher than previous deals.= SYY now has about $13 BILLION of debt.3) SYY market cap is over $26 Billion = Enterprise Value (EV) of $39 BILLLION..... yet sales are DOWN by at least 75% from a $60 Billion to about $15 Billion= EV to sales ratio of about 2.54) Meanwhile, UNFI sales of NON supermarket assets, are UP by at least 50% toannual run rate of about $36 Billion.... yet UNFI only has $3 Billion in debt, and a marketcap of a minuscule $600 million= UNFI has a currrent EV of about $3.6 Billion(supermarkets were generating about $100 million profits PRE-COVID and NOW are at an annualized profit rate of about $200 million on about $3.5 Billion of sales.So, supermarkets will be sold for about $1 Billion, which will reduce debt to about less than $2 Billionas UNFI uses FREE cash flow to pay down debt)******************************************************************= Current run rate of UNFI EV to sales RATIO point 1 = .1So, SYY is now 25 TIMES more OVERVALUED compared to UNFI.*********************************************************************************= SYY should use their incredibly OVER-valued stock to BUY UNFI.= WHY has SYY just started running commercials on TV ??? ... have you seen them yet?https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sysco-launches-foodservice-doesn-t-121510186.html>>>""Sysco has created a webpage that features campaign elements, including:The Company’s new television advertisement,""<<"

come on 60
What a great opportunity to buy under $70
Can someone refer me to a message board that deals with issues of SYY and SYY only WITHOUT plugs for stock picking websites and other advertising!!!! I am sure that I am not the only person annoyed by this situation!
"Very strange market reaction, SYY did quite well this qtr. most companies didn't."
"Still no volume here in the pre-market. We have to wait until just before market open to gauge the impact of this really poor earnings release on the stock price action for today. But, you can just see that there are no bidders, nobody wants to buy this, and right at the open will come a wave of sellers to push this down. Watch and see. I will be VERY surprised if SYY can hold above $80 for the first 20 minutes of the regular session...."
"Love this stock, new to it, but I was really impressed with the CEO on CNBC recently. Bought in based on his sound reasoning, redirection of the company and some interesting new markets they are working in, whilst their main markets are shut. A well managed company, whod have thunk it in the USA. (joke)"
80$ inc
Acquisition of another Foodservice company in Europe announced this morning.
Chart looks solid. Looking for breakout at $85.98. http://www.foxchart.com/share/961239711.png
Excellent 15% dividend increase.
"No reason for anybody to Bid this up on such a bad earnings release. Basically, everyone who bought this within the past year has profit. Once the regular session begins you can expect heavy profit-taking with very minimal interest for anyone new to go Long, until this goes down at least into the middle $70's. Perfect set-up for a Pure Earnings Shortie like me. :-)"
"They are saying that 60% of small restaurants will not reopen. Most of these owe for past bills.. 21-35 days of purchases.. They cannot pay. You can tell everyday must be Sysco is trying to keep the stock from loosing too much in a day. Sorry but the numbers will be bad... it will crash... Then i might look at buying. NOT NOW. sell now buy later.. MONEY, Money, Money$$ One thing i do know is this business."
I sold a half $1 million worth Friday of course
"Follow the Money,"
15% return in a month? Seems odd for a food delivery company whose sales have dropped. Lots of hope in the future.
why it is so down for just 1 cent down with earning
"SYY not only the world's leader in foodservice distribution, but many times larger than it's next three competitors. Consistent returns and dividends since 1969. Strong management and directors with potential to grow in other countries around the globe."
Let's break $62 and get a higher high on this leg up ...
They have gone through a serious cost cutting process to prepare for the possibility of prolonged recovery. Next stop $70.
Sysco is down 5.41% to 63.97
Just what competition does SYY have anyway?
Will go down to $66 today...
USFD is down big on its earnings and acquisition news. The movement in SYY has created a great buying opportunity.
"******Queen Cathie bought 97,051 shares of Square!!!!!!******"
Were there layoffs at Sysco as a result of the lockdowns?
sysco changing pricing strategy calling it (parascope) taking pricing out of reps hands and setting pricing from Corp office. should see healthy pricing increases across the board.
"The SYY earnings release is set for 8 AM ET, and the company Conference Call to discuss the results and Guidance is set for 10 AM ET. It's interesting that they choose to have the Conference Call during regular market hours. Somewhat rare and unusual, although not unique. Perhaps they think they can rally the stock back up faster, by waiting for the market to open and hoping SYY bottoms out during the first 30 minutes of trading...Personally, I am looking for a nice percentage drop on this one. At least 5%, perhaps much more, depending upon the specific ER numbers, before I will even think about covering my Short Sell and moving on to a Pure Earnings Short of LYFT."
"Sysco will see $45 again when reporting comes out. It's a great company! Ruff times ahead, industry is down many closings, margins are tight, lines per drop way down, GP is well off, past dues are worrisome."
Sysco is down 4.94% to 61.60
"The stock is a 1 star opportunity rated by Morningstar. They have the fair value based on fundamentals in the mid 50s. If the SEC wants to investigate nonsense in the market, they could look here in to who has been buying SYY over the last 6 months. Just silly price action as if no pandemic ever happened. My guess is they would find computer momentum algorithm trading."
"Looking to sell this baby at $82.00 today. Earnings report is just not quite good enough to give us serious upside potential for the next few months, imo. If she hits $82, I'm out with a small profit."
Great great company no doubt about it! Also one of the most overpriced stocks in the market now be very very careful and I am not sure just don’t trust the stock price. Very bullish for the future although that may be three years from now￼
How can anyone buy SYY over $10... the have already pulled 1.6B of their 2B line of credit. Customers are closed and cannot pay. i here Sysco cant pay their bills. this is not going to be good for such a big company. They will probably have a problem getting employees that they are firing now.
omg..this is $10 ovwr priced
Why does IOTC keep coming up in conversations? Is it because link labs is involved with cysco??Might be worth finding some connections.
"Got to love a transformation story. I read the release and I think I counted the word ""decreased"" over a dozen times. The stock price is completely dislodged with reality."
What's the news for the pump today?
Very bullish short term on the technicals. This is going to pop to 56-58 very soon.
Definitely a great stock to keep an eye on when things get back to normal it will also get back to its normal price.
Shorts should think about the outstanding dividend history...
"SYY and Kroger enter into agreement. Under this agreement, Sysco associates in the United States who have been temporarily furloughed due to the dramatic decline in foodservice demand from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, will have the opportunity to work at Kroger locations for 30 days, or more, as agreed upon by both companies.https://investors.sysco.com/annual-reports-and-sec-filings/news-releases/2020/03-27-2020-201531734"
100$ soon
Sell this and buy SPTN
"as for the grocery store sales they squacking about, average drop 20 cases. company averaged $1.00 per case if all goes well with delivery. in florida we see mostly US foods trucks on the road"
"If anyone is looking for a Pure Earnings Short Sell play for Monday, I would highly suggest you check out SYY. I have spent 4 hours researching all stocks that report earnings Monday AH/Tuesday PM, about 200 stocks in total, and for me SYY stands out as being absolutely poised to sell-off immediately upon releasing earnings. I am enthusiastic about this play and think it offers about 80% odds of success, which is as good as you can get using this strategy. What makes SYY the most Bloated Baby of them all?? Consider:1: Stock is right at her 52 week high. In fact hit a brand new 52 week high on Friday. 2: Company was unable to generate a profit for 2020 despite being a wholesaler of vital goods.3: Valuation is astronomical with no justification.4: EPS is expected to be lower this quarter than last quarter, with negative growth. 5: A comprehensive financial analysis shows lots of weakness: Debt is high and significant. Gross Margins are below par for the sector. Return on Equity is weak. Growth rate is downright POOR for the sector. 6: Tons of uncertainty going forward due to high international exposure to restaurant and hotel business that can easily be devastated by the ongoing pandemic, as has occurred in India. 7: Despite being a wholesale food and food related supplier, SYY does NOT primarily serve supermarkets or pharmacies, which are booming. Rather, it primarily serves restaurants, hotels, schools, places that have seen and are likely to continue to see cuts in spending due to the pandemic. So, WHY is this stock so expensive??? Irrational Exuberance and the booming bull market lifts almost all stocks these days, making it a Pickers Paradise for the astute Short Seller. Even if SYY exactly meets EPS and Revenue consensus estimates on Tuesday, I judge Fair Value for this stock to be $67-$72/share. If they miss on both, $60-$65/share. If they modestly BEAT consensus on both, $74-$77/share. All this makes SYY a SCREAMING Short Sell to play and hold through her earnings release, and that is exactly what I plan to do on Monday, after I cover my current ON Pure Earnings Short Sell. Good Luck!"
"Bought in March and sold couple of weeks ago. Made a nice profit. Don't see this going anywhere for a while. It will take the vaccine to get this thing upward. Better stocks to be in during this crisis, much better stocks!"
Time for a split
"Our total Sysco results for the fourth quarter include a sales decrease of 43% to $8.9 billion. Local case volume within US Broadline operations decreased 38.7% for the fourth quarter, while total case volume within US Broadline operations decreased 41.5%. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a significant decline in both volume and sales across all the business segments. Gross profit decreased 47% to $1.6 billion and gross margin decreased 159 basis points. Our gross margin for the fourth quarter was impacted by pricing to help move inventory and avoid spoilage and by a temporary shift in customer mix as a result of the current operating environment. These results were in line with our previous guidance as it relates to margins.Adjusted operating expense decreased 26% to $1.6 billion. It is important to note that we had $115 million of incentive pay accrual reversals that favorably impacted operating expenses and the run rate in Q1 of fiscal 2021 will be normalized when compared to Q4 fiscal 2020. With that said, the adjusted operating income run rate was profitable in June, even with -- even without the accrual reversal. Adjusted operating income decreased 104% to a loss of $34 million and adjusted earnings per share decreased 126% to a negative $0.29 for total Sysco. Across the business, our results were impacted by various financial certain items, which I will review before proceeding into individual segment results."
EPS beats by $0.02. We should see a sell off at the bell followed by a gain around lunch
"I think today's big drop was kind of an overreaction to the Mexico tariffs, which I believe will NOT happen. I expect there will be a bounce back on Monday or Tuesday, therefore it seemed like a good swing trade buy today."
78 x earnings--what am I missing
Sysco is up 10.37% to 67.17
"Strong company will not go bankrupt. When virus flattens and restaurants start opening back up the stock will sky rocket. Although, it may go down more than it has already in the next few weeks. Good company to keep an eye on."
is the after hours right?
An easy double here.
SYY worth $27 in this market
"they made an offer for metro.ag, metro jumped 20%"
Sysco is down 5.51% to 68.30
SYY needs to reveal a plan
This stock is only worth buying at $62
I’m selling my Sysco. The industry they service is in too much danger. Lockdown is on the way.
I will pick some of this up when it hits $28
"@Shorty McShortBear,Are there any stocks you hold for 5+ years? It just seems that there is a lot of focus on day/swing trades and margin trading. Some of us are in for the buy and hold. That is my plan here with SYY."
"Is Sysco doing anything to go autonomous, any rumors at all?"
SYY is up 5.02% to 71.92
Looks like momentum is taking this higher
"Frank Joshua D, Director of SYSCO CORP bought 703700 shares on 2020-05-18. https://formwhispers.com/s?t=SYY"
I'm doubling my Postion long term this will double may take 2 to 3 years and more downside but no brainer. we will get vaccine and beat this restaurant will open back up and Sysco will deliver the supplies.. no question.. alternative is we all don't make it and stocks won't matter I'm betting on our future
"I’ll still hold my position with SYY ,but also purchase others that might boost them ,like NSP Naturally Splendid deal with Naterra plant base products and now Sysco is supplying the products, especially I missed the boat with beyond meats, so I’ll invest in this company heading in the right direction"
"ARK bought 797,270 $$$$"
"This is good but Sysco is trying to get rid of the food that will go bad.They are loosing so much business now. Probably about 40%.There numbers will be bad for months to come. Major business is Restaurants, colleges, Amusements Park and Sports events... all are closed for who know how long."
"This company just delivered a couple cases of ""frozen"" chicken completely thawed. Excellent way to put money back to the bottom line and stockholder value."
By the end of the year Sysco will have some driverless trucks leaving warehouses with almost no people. Profits thru the roof!
SYY will be on the rise but in 1-2 wks it'll dip but then back on track of going back up. Target $80
Keep buying them dips. Paper hands always lose.
It's not too late to hop on the train (PT $70) now. Syy will be standing strong even if the 2nd wave were to come. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4356119-sysco-come-out-of-pandemic-stronger-ever
"Buy buy buy, thank me later"
"Barbara, it is because the market is driven somewhat by quick turn investors and speculators and what they see as exuberant speculation, example Amazon.Earnings and PE ratios are very important to those of us who look at stock in 5-10 year perspectives. Based on that SYY is a solid investment."
Most restaurants are barely able to pay their bills on time. I would think that the write-offs for noncollectable receivables will far exceed normal reserves here and that there will be both operating losses and sizable write-offs of receivables.
"the restaurants are closed, their #1 customers......BUT nursing homes, hotels & institutions are still in play...28bucks is a steal"
3 of top Produce Reps are leaving after finding out big bad sysco has bought their respective 2 companies. La Specialty is willing to spend to gain more traction.
not going to be well for awhile for food distributors.
"SYY missed consensus Revenue estimates by about $500M. They couldn't even meet lowered expectations, even as they soared to a new 52 week high...This should start to sell off in a serious way as we get closer to market open."
"Sysco back on my want list...with Albertson's buying ten Tesla Semi trucks for L.A. market, Sysco is soon to make the conection if not already. Hopefully stock will drop to a 4% dividend for me."
why is it tanking ?
Great Earnings! Should move up
Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Highlights • Sales decreased 6.5% to $13.7 billion • Gross profit decreased 6.9% to $2.6 billion; gross margin decreased 7 basis points • Operating income decreased 88.6% to $60.3 million; adjusted¹ operating income decreased 39.2% to $377.0 million • EPS decreased $0.86 to $(0.01); adjusted¹ EPS decreased $0.34 to $0.45
Why is these results a surprise to anyone? With the vast majority of restaurants closed or reduced to carryout what did they expect. I am a buyer at this price because all of thos closed restaurants are going to have to restock their shelves in the coming months.
"That is fine, i am still short. they are trying to buy stocks to keep it out of the cellar... but when the numbers come out it is down, down, down... i am not beating on SYY... i just want to make money... short now and Buy when it hits bottom. With the bad credit and closures i think it should go to $38... but i dont think it will maybe $48... then look at buying... good company but bad times... Good Hunting... keep an open mind."
why does this stock always fall after a good report?

The decline in gross profit for the third quarter was primarily driven by lower volumes due to COVID-19.Operating expenses decreased $617.2 million, or 24.6%, compared to the same period last year, driven by reduced costs from the achievement of cost-out initiatives, as well as a benefit from a reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts. Adjusted operating expenses decreased $320.8 million, or 14.7%, compared to the same period last year.Operating income was $235.9 million, an increase of $175.6 million, or 291.4%, compared to the same period last year. Adjusted operating income was $256.2 million, a decrease of $120.8 million, or 32.0%, compared to the same period last year."
"Syy will tank for a while... California Restaurants and theaters, events are all shut down... That is a huge business for SYY on the west coast. ... And Florida their two largest states for food.. i am short."
I worked for Sysco for 11 years and I can promise you they are always about the stock holder!! Food distribution is not pretty or exciting so most people have no idea what a huge machine this is. It is not as easy as Amazon would make it sound. Sysco did not grow over night and can not be duplicated over night. It is not like buying Whole Foods with a foot print already in place. Amazon is talking about duplicating Sysco not doing a buy out?

Started a position today. 1st time I ever owned this stock. Used to be a food broker and know the strength of this company. Many of the higher tier holders of stock have been crushed this year. I mean CRUSHED!Nice divi when goes x next month. Will buy on any sell-off now.
SYY is one of my favorite dividend growth stocks. I talk about dividend growth stocks on my youtube channel. The channel is really focused on new and beginner investors looking to invest in dividend growth stocks and ETFs. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrg6IDPf4a7pUKTN90n6syg=
Sysco is up 5.10% to 60.00
so when till we see $55-$60 again?
I think it’s going to $70
Sysco's P/E of 14.93 indicates relatively low sentiment towards the stock. We can see in the image below that the average P/E (19.9) for companies in the consumer retailing industry is higher than Sysco's P/E.
"Great stock, so good it doesnt even need alot of giberrish on this msg board. It sure is quite around here, for such a solid stock."
"A lot of people flocked to this stock for safety. Well, that's all changed now. This stock overvalued and many getting out.The upward momentum is over."
Price PerformanceThis Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has lost 32.6% in the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 8.4%.
SYY is down 8.34% to 34.60
Gonna pay to fat cats a lot of money to step down. This should be expensive.
Sysco goes Cajun!!!!!!! The crawfish season will be good to them!
"I'm out of SYY today. The industry they service is in too much danger short term, long term I can't say. For now just not worth investing in. Too many other places to deploy capital. This is no longer safe IMO."
Was going out tonight to restaurant. Not going now with family. Probably can extrapolate this to many.Not good for the restaurant industry.
"Locally...One on the reasons SYY may drop for awhile.Sysco has immediate job openingsfor dependable local CDL A DeliveryTruck Drivers, Shuttle Drivers, andWarehouse Selectors. Earn up to $10,000 retention bonus Salary up to $100,000 401K & Stock Purchase Plan Multiple Health Insurance Options Paid Time Off Equal Opportunity Employer"
Are expectations too high to go from last Q reported 64 cents to estimate 94 cents?
"SYY just hit a brand new 52 week high this morning! Why??? It is a SCREAMING Short Sell ahead of earfnings release tomorrow morning, and I am just sitting and watching, hoping she keeps on going higher for the next few hours. Will DEFINITELY do my Pure Earnings Sell Short on SYY later today, probably by 2:30 ET at the latest. This should go below $80, easily, on Tuesday after releasing earnings. Way too expensive, weak financials, lots of uncertainty going forward... I just can't believe she hit another 52 week high today!"
"And no industry has been hit harder than the restaurant business.“The restaurant industry now reflects the highest total business closures, recently surpassing retail,” Yelp said in its report.“As of July 10, there have been 26,160 total restaurant closures, an increase of 2,179 since June 15. Of the all closed restaurants in July, 15,770 have permanently closed (60%), accounting for 2,956 more permanent closures, a 23% increase since June 15.”"
kinda quiet in here. How about US Foods up 13% the day after this drops 10%?
"Restaurants are packed nowadays, a strong buy here for Sysco stock. Can be attributed to tax cuts and a robust job market. SYS is in the sweet spot."
"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Aplidin-new-COVID-19-drug-treatment-15896817.phpthis is what I have been waiting for, not a vaccine, but better treatments that will reduce the severity. more will be coming and that will change covid from a severe problem to a minor one.add the new JNJ vaccine and SYY will be much stronger in a month."
"What an “Amazing“ opportunity to accumulate!SYSCO will continue to show consistent profit growth, even taking in to consideration the currently recovering market. It retains the highest margins comparable to its competitors, as well as market share. SYY monopolizes the food industry's North American distribution network, and continues to purse growth in to the international markets. Looking at the strength of its financials, I believe SYSCO has not only a proven track record, but the potential to well exceed its current depressed levels in the months to come."
SYY reached a new All Time High at 72.69
"this is now trading at .5x last year's revenue.of course, this year's revenue is going to be erased but this is quite a bargain."
"Load up everything going back to normal,probably it’s going to go little bit up and down but after 3-4 months back to where it belong mid 80.I just bought more Friday."
Like the nice volume and SP movement ...
A sales drop of 6% is not bad considering March was a disaster for restaurants. April will be worse but it will get incrementally better in the coming months. 2nd Qtr results are baked in to the price.
Karma Shorty she sure can squeeze one who’s betting on others misfortunes!
"Trend Of ROCEWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at Sysco, we didn't gain much confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 10% from 21% five years ago. And considering revenue has dropped while employing more capital, we'd be cautious. If this were to continue, you might be looking at a company that is trying to reinvest for growth but is actually losing market share since sales haven't increased."
As a employee for Sysco we actually picked up a lot of work during this pandemic so as a shareholder we are looking good from my point of view
"It's Show Time! Here comes the SYY Earnings report, due to be released in just 5 minutes. Let us see what kind of dazzling and extraordinary EPS and Revenue numbers this Bloated Baby comes up with, to try to justify her immense over-valuation and astronomical P/E ratio. My bet is, the numbers will just not be good enough to prevent a nosedive in stock price to below $80 by market open."
Buy this gem on dips
shortterm thinkers are good for longterm investors.
"Sygma Network is owned by Sysco foods. They are number one in customized food distribution in the nation. Panda Express, Burger King, Apple Bees , KFC ext. all get there food from them. I believe they will last through this storm. Will see..."
"Sold Short a lot of shares of SYY at $84.10. This is a Pure Earnings play, specifically planned out to hold through earnings release PM tomorrow. I am expecting a significant drop in stock price upon earnings release, and planning to Cover this Short tomorrow, during the regular hours trading session, with a profit of somewhere between 3-12%. SYY is hugely over-valued and faces significant head-winds and uncertainty going forward. I expect SYY to sell off tomorrow even if they deliver both EPS and Revenue beats of consensus estimates. If they miss on either, an 8-12% sell-off is more likely than not. If they modestly beat on both measures, a 3-6% sell-off is still more likely than not. I am very pleased to be Short at the $84.10 price point, and eagerly await tomorrow's earnings release. Good Luck!"
"Probably not for a long time,between the loss of sales and bad debts from the bankruptcy filings.probably be smart to cash out and go into grocery business"
will it recover by end of day?
Great earnings report. See you at 80 soon!
VERO BLUE IS OURS BABY!!!!!!!!$SYY
The stock will be great long-term right now it seems to be artificially propped up I think fair market value for the stock giving the unusual circumstances are 35 tops
SYY is down -4.95% to 67.94
why dont they shift from restaurant supply to grocery and hospital relenishment?
As the roaring '20s style second half kicks in food supply chain is going to be at capacity. I'm buying this now in anticipation of every restaurant in the country being booked 100% solid.
High employee turnover is because of new pay changes for their sales people to a salary + bonus and away from commission. They have no incentive to sell. A lot of growth in their profit numbers is because they pay their people less today than before Covid.
SYY reached a 52 Week low at 37.00
this business model is going down. get out while you can
Michigan all Bars and Restaurants close starts tomorrow
"I predict SYY will open at 9:30 ET at $79.50, jump around and briefly go above $80, then collapse into the $77 range by 10:00 AM, which is when the Conference Call starts."
This is a long hold stock. Good dividends and 25+ year growth potential. The largest and best in the industry with world-wide development abilities. For me an awesome stock is one that gives long term and safe returns.:-)
"Sysco is #1. The most solid company We did business with in the past 20 years. This virus will pass. Sysco leads, others try to compete, and try to set their models to Sysco's standards. Hell of a buying opportunity!!!!!"
"Nasty drop, yet my opportunity to add. Thank you COVID panic sellers!"
11B to 16B jump in revenue quarter over quarter? How is that possible? Is the competition dying or what's going on?
