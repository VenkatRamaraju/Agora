"as for the grocery store sales they squacking about, average drop 20 cases. company averaged $1.00 per case if all goes well with delivery. in florida we see mostly US foods trucks on the road"
come on 60
"Sysco’s largest customer is Aramark .... college feeding , stadium feeding , business and industry feeding , school feeding , ..... prison feeding ... ok one segment is up ... the last one ."
Great great company no doubt about it! Also one of the most overpriced stocks in the market now be very very careful and I am not sure just don’t trust the stock price. Very bullish for the future although that may be three years from now￼
"Very strange market reaction, SYY did quite well this qtr. most companies didn't."
It's not too late to hop on the train (PT $70) now. Syy will be standing strong even if the 2nd wave were to come. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4356119-sysco-come-out-of-pandemic-stronger-ever
"This is good but Sysco is trying to get rid of the food that will go bad.They are loosing so much business now. Probably about 40%.There numbers will be bad for months to come. Major business is Restaurants, colleges, Amusements Park and Sports events... all are closed for who know how long."
"Zacks Consensus EstimateThis food distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.59 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -25.3%.Revenues are expected to be $13.58 billion, down 7.4% from the year-ago quarter."
"Not exactly robust profits coming out of the Foodservice segment for the next while - IMO. Pent up demand yes - but passing on inflationary costs, debt payment, staffing issues & labor costs will be a drag. Oh ya, Delta….. Passing costs onto consumers will be a problem. Sorry, not a basher but that’s my DD. Feel free to rip me!!"
"The stock is a 1 star opportunity rated by Morningstar. They have the fair value based on fundamentals in the mid 50s. If the SEC wants to investigate nonsense in the market, they could look here in to who has been buying SYY over the last 6 months. Just silly price action as if no pandemic ever happened. My guess is they would find computer momentum algorithm trading."
Just what competition does SYY have anyway?
Most restaurants are barely able to pay their bills on time. I would think that the write-offs for noncollectable receivables will far exceed normal reserves here and that there will be both operating losses and sizable write-offs of receivables.
"Sysco back on my want list...with Albertson's buying ten Tesla Semi trucks for L.A. market, Sysco is soon to make the conection if not already. Hopefully stock will drop to a 4% dividend for me."
I’m selling my Sysco. I’m very concerned about them selling property in Houston. This once great company is going the way of Rykoff. This happen when you don’t have anyone from a foodservice sales background run the company.
"Still no volume here in the pre-market. We have to wait until just before market open to gauge the impact of this really poor earnings release on the stock price action for today. But, you can just see that there are no bidders, nobody wants to buy this, and right at the open will come a wave of sellers to push this down. Watch and see. I will be VERY surprised if SYY can hold above $80 for the first 20 minutes of the regular session...."
EPS beats by $0.02. We should see a sell off at the bell followed by a gain around lunch
Very bullish short term on the technicals. This is going to pop to 56-58 very soon.
sales force turnover rate is alarming. hemoraging sales staff
This is a long hold stock. Good dividends and 25+ year growth potential. The largest and best in the industry with world-wide development abilities. For me an awesome stock is one that gives long term and safe returns.:-)
11B to 16B jump in revenue quarter over quarter? How is that possible? Is the competition dying or what's going on?
"SYY just hit a brand new 52 week high this morning! Why??? It is a SCREAMING Short Sell ahead of earfnings release tomorrow morning, and I am just sitting and watching, hoping she keeps on going higher for the next few hours. Will DEFINITELY do my Pure Earnings Sell Short on SYY later today, probably by 2:30 ET at the latest. This should go below $80, easily, on Tuesday after releasing earnings. Way too expensive, weak financials, lots of uncertainty going forward... I just can't believe she hit another 52 week high today!"
"just spoke with a specialist there, they are working part time. they only need to make 5 calls per week. he is doing laundry today and taking the day to travel tomorrow for the weekend. no management"
"Mitch it will turn around but with the Schools and Collages out till probably next year. It will not sky rocket.I am still looking at $28.00 BUT i am going to have to look at that in a couple of weeks... it might be much lower. Sysco is dumping product now but that is not going to save them that much in Taxes, Hope they don't go bankrupt, it would put many other vendors out of business. I would not put it past them to bankrupt to get out of some debt. at least stretch out the vendors for a few years. I know a lot of people that have stock that are shorting to protect their money. Hope it works out."
I find it fascinating that SYSCO has recovered after so many restaurants are closed and or operating at 50%. It is almost like they don't operate in the food supply business. This whole market is unbelievable.
"I'm out of SYY today. The industry they service is in too much danger short term, long term I can't say. For now just not worth investing in. Too many other places to deploy capital. This is no longer safe IMO."
Time for a split
Great Earnings! Should move up
"Strong company will not go bankrupt. When virus flattens and restaurants start opening back up the stock will sky rocket. Although, it may go down more than it has already in the next few weeks. Good company to keep an eye on."
SSY has some more room to fall before an upside. Its to early in covid damage for profitability.
I will pick some of this up when it hits $28
"It's a good time to buy/add SYY here. Just look around, a lot more people are dining out nowadays due to the robust economy."
"Trend Of ROCEWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at Sysco, we didn't gain much confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 10% from 21% five years ago. And considering revenue has dropped while employing more capital, we'd be cautious. If this were to continue, you might be looking at a company that is trying to reinvest for growth but is actually losing market share since sales haven't increased."
"Bought in March and sold couple of weeks ago. Made a nice profit. Don't see this going anywhere for a while. It will take the vaccine to get this thing upward. Better stocks to be in during this crisis, much better stocks!"
Sysco's P/E of 14.93 indicates relatively low sentiment towards the stock. We can see in the image below that the average P/E (19.9) for companies in the consumer retailing industry is higher than Sysco's P/E.
will it recover by end of day?
"Our total Sysco results for the fourth quarter include a sales decrease of 43% to $8.9 billion. Local case volume within US Broadline operations decreased 38.7% for the fourth quarter, while total case volume within US Broadline operations decreased 41.5%. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a significant decline in both volume and sales across all the business segments. Gross profit decreased 47% to $1.6 billion and gross margin decreased 159 basis points. Our gross margin for the fourth quarter was impacted by pricing to help move inventory and avoid spoilage and by a temporary shift in customer mix as a result of the current operating environment. These results were in line with our previous guidance as it relates to margins.Adjusted operating expense decreased 26% to $1.6 billion. It is important to note that we had $115 million of incentive pay accrual reversals that favorably impacted operating expenses and the run rate in Q1 of fiscal 2021 will be normalized when compared to Q4 fiscal 2020. With that said, the adjusted operating income run rate was profitable in June, even with -- even without the accrual reversal. Adjusted operating income decreased 104% to a loss of $34 million and adjusted earnings per share decreased 126% to a negative $0.29 for total Sysco. Across the business, our results were impacted by various financial certain items, which I will review before proceeding into individual segment results."
Price PerformanceThis Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has lost 32.6% in the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 8.4%.
Started a position today. 1st time I ever owned this stock. Used to be a food broker and know the strength of this company. Many of the higher tier holders of stock have been crushed this year. I mean CRUSHED!Nice divi when goes x next month. Will buy on any sell-off now.
"Sysco will see $45 again when reporting comes out. It's a great company! Ruff times ahead, industry is down many closings, margins are tight, lines per drop way down, GP is well off, past dues are worrisome."
Sysco carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of +7.69%
Were there layoffs at Sysco as a result of the lockdowns?
Why is these results a surprise to anyone? With the vast majority of restaurants closed or reduced to carryout what did they expect. I am a buyer at this price because all of thos closed restaurants are going to have to restock their shelves in the coming months.
high employee turnover not a good sign
"This company just delivered a couple cases of ""frozen"" chicken completely thawed. Excellent way to put money back to the bottom line and stockholder value."
"If anyone is looking for a Pure Earnings Short Sell play for Monday, I would highly suggest you check out SYY. I have spent 4 hours researching all stocks that report earnings Monday AH/Tuesday PM, about 200 stocks in total, and for me SYY stands out as being absolutely poised to sell-off immediately upon releasing earnings. I am enthusiastic about this play and think it offers about 80% odds of success, which is as good as you can get using this strategy. What makes SYY the most Bloated Baby of them all?? Consider:1: Stock is right at her 52 week high. In fact hit a brand new 52 week high on Friday. 2: Company was unable to generate a profit for 2020 despite being a wholesaler of vital goods.3: Valuation is astronomical with no justification.4: EPS is expected to be lower this quarter than last quarter, with negative growth. 5: A comprehensive financial analysis shows lots of weakness: Debt is high and significant. Gross Margins are below par for the sector. Return on Equity is weak. Growth rate is downright POOR for the sector. 6: Tons of uncertainty going forward due to high international exposure to restaurant and hotel business that can easily be devastated by the ongoing pandemic, as has occurred in India. 7: Despite being a wholesale food and food related supplier, SYY does NOT primarily serve supermarkets or pharmacies, which are booming. Rather, it primarily serves restaurants, hotels, schools, places that have seen and are likely to continue to see cuts in spending due to the pandemic. So, WHY is this stock so expensive??? Irrational Exuberance and the booming bull market lifts almost all stocks these days, making it a Pickers Paradise for the astute Short Seller. Even if SYY exactly meets EPS and Revenue consensus estimates on Tuesday, I judge Fair Value for this stock to be $67-$72/share. If they miss on both, $60-$65/share. If they modestly BEAT consensus on both, $74-$77/share. All this makes SYY a SCREAMING Short Sell to play and hold through her earnings release, and that is exactly what I plan to do on Monday, after I cover my current ON Pure Earnings Short Sell. Good Luck!"
A sales drop of 6% is not bad considering March was a disaster for restaurants. April will be worse but it will get incrementally better in the coming months. 2nd Qtr results are baked in to the price.
80$ inc
"Locally...One on the reasons SYY may drop for awhile.Sysco has immediate job openingsfor dependable local CDL A DeliveryTruck Drivers, Shuttle Drivers, andWarehouse Selectors. Earn up to $10,000 retention bonus Salary up to $100,000 401K & Stock Purchase Plan Multiple Health Insurance Options Paid Time Off Equal Opportunity Employer"
"What an “Amazing“ opportunity to accumulate!SYSCO will continue to show consistent profit growth, even taking in to consideration the currently recovering market. It retains the highest margins comparable to its competitors, as well as market share. SYY monopolizes the food industry's North American distribution network, and continues to purse growth in to the international markets. Looking at the strength of its financials, I believe SYSCO has not only a proven track record, but the potential to well exceed its current depressed levels in the months to come."
"this is now trading at .5x last year's revenue.of course, this year's revenue is going to be erased but this is quite a bargain."
shortterm thinkers are good for longterm investors.
"Long term continued growth and returns, normally slower than most, but consistent!"
"And no industry has been hit harder than the restaurant business.“The restaurant industry now reflects the highest total business closures, recently surpassing retail,” Yelp said in its report.“As of July 10, there have been 26,160 total restaurant closures, an increase of 2,179 since June 15. Of the all closed restaurants in July, 15,770 have permanently closed (60%), accounting for 2,956 more permanent closures, a 23% increase since June 15.”"
why is it tanking ?
"I for one, do not understand why the stock price drops every time they meet or beat expectations. . . ?"
"Love this stock, new to it, but I was really impressed with the CEO on CNBC recently. Bought in based on his sound reasoning, redirection of the company and some interesting new markets they are working in, whilst their main markets are shut. A well managed company, whod have thunk it in the USA. (joke)"
High employee turnover is because of new pay changes for their sales people to a salary + bonus and away from commission. They have no incentive to sell. A lot of growth in their profit numbers is because they pay their people less today than before Covid.
Gonna pay to fat cats a lot of money to step down. This should be expensive.
Great earnings report. See you at 80 soon!
