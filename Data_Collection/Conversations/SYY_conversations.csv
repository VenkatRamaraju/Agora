poor mgt. now they have Monday's off. calling it mindfull monday. sit home and watch westerns
"SYY just hit a brand new 52 week high this morning! Why??? It is a SCREAMING Short Sell ahead of earfnings release tomorrow morning, and I am just sitting and watching, hoping she keeps on going higher for the next few hours. Will DEFINITELY do my Pure Earnings Sell Short on SYY later today, probably by 2:30 ET at the latest. This should go below $80, easily, on Tuesday after releasing earnings. Way too expensive, weak financials, lots of uncertainty going forward... I just can't believe she hit another 52 week high today!"
sysco changing pricing strategy calling it (parascope) taking pricing out of reps hands and setting pricing from Corp office. should see healthy pricing increases across the board.
High employee turnover is because of new pay changes for their sales people to a salary + bonus and away from commission. They have no incentive to sell. A lot of growth in their profit numbers is because they pay their people less today than before Covid.
This is a long hold stock. Good dividends and 25+ year growth potential. The largest and best in the industry with world-wide development abilities. For me an awesome stock is one that gives long term and safe returns.:-)
"I for one, do not understand why the stock price drops every time they meet or beat expectations. . . ?"
"Our total Sysco results for the fourth quarter include a sales decrease of 43% to $8.9 billion. Local case volume within US Broadline operations decreased 38.7% for the fourth quarter, while total case volume within US Broadline operations decreased 41.5%. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a significant decline in both volume and sales across all the business segments. Gross profit decreased 47% to $1.6 billion and gross margin decreased 159 basis points. Our gross margin for the fourth quarter was impacted by pricing to help move inventory and avoid spoilage and by a temporary shift in customer mix as a result of the current operating environment. These results were in line with our previous guidance as it relates to margins.Adjusted operating expense decreased 26% to $1.6 billion. It is important to note that we had $115 million of incentive pay accrual reversals that favorably impacted operating expenses and the run rate in Q1 of fiscal 2021 will be normalized when compared to Q4 fiscal 2020. With that said, the adjusted operating income run rate was profitable in June, even with -- even without the accrual reversal. Adjusted operating income decreased 104% to a loss of $34 million and adjusted earnings per share decreased 126% to a negative $0.29 for total Sysco. Across the business, our results were impacted by various financial certain items, which I will review before proceeding into individual segment results."
Price PerformanceThis Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has lost 32.6% in the past six months compared with the industry’s decline of 8.4%.
"Strong company will not go bankrupt. When virus flattens and restaurants start opening back up the stock will sky rocket. Although, it may go down more than it has already in the next few weeks. Good company to keep an eye on."
"What an “Amazing“ opportunity to accumulate!SYSCO will continue to show consistent profit growth, even taking in to consideration the currently recovering market. It retains the highest margins comparable to its competitors, as well as market share. SYY monopolizes the food industry's North American distribution network, and continues to purse growth in to the international markets. Looking at the strength of its financials, I believe SYSCO has not only a proven track record, but the potential to well exceed its current depressed levels in the months to come."
78 x earnings--what am I missing
"as for the grocery store sales they squacking about, average drop 20 cases. company averaged $1.00 per case if all goes well with delivery. in florida we see mostly US foods trucks on the road"
"Still no volume here in the pre-market. We have to wait until just before market open to gauge the impact of this really poor earnings release on the stock price action for today. But, you can just see that there are no bidders, nobody wants to buy this, and right at the open will come a wave of sellers to push this down. Watch and see. I will be VERY surprised if SYY can hold above $80 for the first 20 minutes of the regular session...."
Gonna pay to fat cats a lot of money to step down. This should be expensive.
80$ inc
"Locally...One on the reasons SYY may drop for awhile.Sysco has immediate job openingsfor dependable local CDL A DeliveryTruck Drivers, Shuttle Drivers, andWarehouse Selectors. Earn up to $10,000 retention bonus Salary up to $100,000 401K & Stock Purchase Plan Multiple Health Insurance Options Paid Time Off Equal Opportunity Employer"
"Love this stock, new to it, but I was really impressed with the CEO on CNBC recently. Bought in based on his sound reasoning, redirection of the company and some interesting new markets they are working in, whilst their main markets are shut. A well managed company, whod have thunk it in the USA. (joke)"
"A PEG of .7 based on 53% 5yr annual growth rate. If 53% is true, it’s a compelling value.is 53% annual growth possible?????"
11B to 16B jump in revenue quarter over quarter? How is that possible? Is the competition dying or what's going on?
I find it fascinating that SYSCO has recovered after so many restaurants are closed and or operating at 50%. It is almost like they don't operate in the food supply business. This whole market is unbelievable.
