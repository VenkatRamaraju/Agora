"I feel pretty good about APD. pricing power is important and when inflation hits, APD will be just fine.which is why it is bouncing back lately.(and inflation is happening, dont believe this 'transitory' garbage)The only things seeing higher prices are food, gas, energy, labor, autos, and clothing.so, as long as you dont need to buy those things, you wont be affected by inflation."
"On October 6, APD was $255, only $3 above a 52 week low amidst record levels by the DOW and our industrial competitors.Less than 3 weeks later APD is knocking on the door of $300 with the 4 November earnings upcoming. It’s time to break the 5 quarter earnings losing streak and blow past the 9 November’s $327.89 all time high. If we beat or increase forward guidance APD will surely set a 52 week high. Conversely should they miss earnings once again it will be back to $265 and the painstaking 3 months of meandering in no mans land. The 27 September news release of the Jazan financial closing stated “all parties under the joint venture expect asset transfer and funding to occur during the month of October. Air Products intends to conduct a public investor call at that time”. Hopefully that investor call will take place this week (or at the very least prior to the 4 November earnings release) for additional pomp and circumstance regarding the significance of this Jazan financial closure. I see investors are still bailing out on APD as the stock gave back a considerable portion of todays gains over the last 12 minutes of market open, dropping from $295.41 at 3:48pm to close at $294.38 at 4:00pm. APD is pointed in the right direction. As I have stated countless times before, they are in the right markets and continue to secure billion dollar deals. APD is going to pop and when it does, to you non believing selling out investors, cry me a river! The train will be leaving the station soon. There are still choice seats available on the APD Express. Get onboard while you still can on the ride up to $400!"
"Love these boring defensive stocks right now. APD, REYN, etc."
"David I’m a believer.what a beautiful day to be part of apd,so on the investors call it was supposed to happen today not sure if it did haven’t had the chance to listen."
I really hope this is not a repeat of the past 5 quarters. I’m very optimistic this has been a great week. Very excited what the future holds.I’ve increased my position so we will see.so I’ll be eating my chef salad and maybe we can add some meat if this continues
"I have to tip my hat to ""David"" for the quality of his posts. Far better than most....and data supported. I might like him on the Board of APD."
"It’s pretty simple. 5 straight missed earnings quarters. 6 out of 7. Lowered guidance. Continuing to blame it on Covid and no favorable news on the Jazan financial closing that was originally expected last September that was most recently promised (during the 9 August analysts call) to close by the end of this September. I guess it would be too much to expect that deal to get done early however it will be no surprise that September rolls into October with no communication whatsoever on Jazan’s status. Perhaps it’s being further delayed causing the sell off? APD is quickly approaching a 52 week low as it’s only $15 from it, all the while the DOW and its industrial peers are all close to 52 week highs. Disappointing to say the least. Shareholders have reason to be very unhappy."
"Any reason why ADP up so much so fast lately, anyone?"
Louisiana contract secured! Always liked that state.
"As of yesterday’s close, the year long delayed Jazan Project financing that was instrumental in leading to 5 straight missed earnings quarters has netted a total gain of 66 cents since Monday’s announcement of its financing completion. The volume of shares traded on Monday’s announcement (1.2 million) was barely above the daily volume of 894,000.On Monday’s announcement the stock opened at its high for the day at $269.00 and drifted lowered the entire day closing at $261.91 only 26 cents above the days low of $261.65.For Monday’s completion of the biggest investment in Air Products history the results have been pathetic and unacceptable. There are 22 analysts covering APD. Of the 22 analysts the high target is $360. The average target is $314.82. The low target of all 22 analysts is $269. As of yesterday’s $258.72 closing price APD is $10.28 below the lowest analysts target. 52 week high of $327.89. 52 week low of $245.75. As of yesterday’s $258.72 closing price APD is only $12.98 from its 52 week low. As of Tuesday shares of APD have declined 10.9% against an industry rise of 21.9%. Shareholders have every reason to be very unhappy about this and the fact that management has yet to acknowledge the year long stock collapse from its 9 November high of $327.89 or its most recent $305 high on 2 June. Full disclosure and accountability to the shareholders..."
"Ashley well stated! With lowered guidance, LuAn and Jazan in the fold it would be shocking if they missed earnings once again come 4 November. They are due to break the streak. If they do or simply increase forward guidance you will see the 9 November $327.89 all time high bite the dust before Thanksgiving. Though it had been an excruciatingly painful past 4 months since getting back to $305 on 2 June and tumbling all the way from $327.89 on 9 No ember I have said all along APD is in the right markets and it’s only a matter of time until it pops. Well to all of the investors that kept selling off APD off thru last Wednesday 6 October when the stock hit $252 (only $7 from a 52 week low), CRY ME A RIVER!Onward to $400 APD goes..."
Does this mean APD is back in action? It’s 3 days in a row.....
So glad I had the opportunity to recently add a few more shares below $255!
Correction. That’s a combined difference of 32.8% (not 22.8%) between APD shares the past year and the industry meaning if AP only matched the industry yesterdays $258.72 closing price would be $343.58 (not $258.72). Thats a huge difference!
"Finally!!!! Somebody seems to be buying today. Then again, the day is young,"
This stock seems poised to take off. It tried yesterday.
Greg good question. They just announced a substantial price increase two days ago on industrial gas products and it was met with yet another stock price drop. One would think this stock would start to look attractive to investors considering the 10 month fall from $327.89 on 9 November and knowing the long delayed Jazan Project financial closing is pending however that’s not been the case as it gets ever closer to a 52 week low. This stock was at $305 on 2 June. Like a broken record 5 straight missed earnings quarters is the culprit IMO. Should 5 turn into 6 come the November earnings release this stock will approach $200. If you compare the DOW and it’s industrial gas competitors performance over the same timeframes APD should be a lot closer to 400 than 200. Instead most everyday it continues to lose ground to both. That this extended stock collapse has yet to be acknowledged or addressed by management is very disappointing. Shareholders have every reason to be very unhappy.
"David....very, very well put.... ""this extended stock collapse has yet to be acknowledged or addressed by management is very disappointing. Shareholders have every reason to be very unhappy"". Then again......maybe they like, and expect, to be handed a boatload of options and stock grants at a low price??"
"Of my earlier post of factual information one particular comment stated “As of Tuesday shares of APD have declined 10.9% against an industry rise of 21.9%.” This difference is over the past year as reported in Zacks 28 September news release of AP increasing product pricing of North America products. That’s a combined difference of 22.8%. If AP only match it’s industrial peers over the past year, yesterday’s $258.72 close would be $317.71 however AP claims to be the most profitable Industrial gas company in the world so it should be higher on that basis. APD opened today at $260.22. It reached it days high of $260.86 the first 15 minutes of trading. The days low was $256.07 which occurred one minute prior to market close as APD closed at $256.10, only 3 cents above the days low. At 3:34 pm today APD was up 20 cents at $258.92. The last 26 minutes of market trading APD lost $2.81 as it closed down $2.61 to $256.11.This trend of reaching its days high the first 30 minutes of market open and closing at or close to its days low has been going on for a greater percentage of trading days since reaching its high of $327.89 on 9 November. Today’s volume was 734,333. Average volume is 902,231. Four days after the announcement of the closing of the biggest investment in AP history the stock continues to flounder with little to no buying interest. Like my earlier post, all factual information..."
"David....thanks, good response. But...with sales dollars increasing HOW do they keep missing earnings? Are the folks running this outfit not incentivized enough? Full disclosure...CEO pay levels are perhaps my pet peeve, has been for several decades in fact. Hopes seem to rest on the Jazan project....I don't know the details but I worry it might become the huge fiasco that energy project in Britain became. Management owes shareholders a better explanation than they're getting IMO. Something is wrong here."
