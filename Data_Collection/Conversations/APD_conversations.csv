Does this mean APD is back in action? It’s 3 days in a row.....
"Possible APD acquisition: Denbury has Helium. Denbury could be resting on an enormous deposit(s) of helium in the Cedar Creek Anticline. I was reviewing a helium map titled, Helium Trends North America created by Tyler Wiseman for the AAPG ACE Houston 2020 meeting and it highlights a helium well in the CCA (same map can be found here on page 2 of the text: https://ugspub.nr.utah.gov/publications/misc_pubs/mp-174/mp-174.pdf). I located the well and it appears to be quite impressive. See for yourself (all public information): Google ""Montana Board of Oil and Gas Online Data"" or just hit the link http://www.bogc.dnrc.mt.gov/WebApps/DataMiner/ . At the top of the page, hit ""Wells"", then ""Search Wells"", then type in the API # ""2502505470"" (this is a well identification number), then ""search"". The well will show up on the left side of the screen. Hit it and then the main page will populate with the well information. Hit ""View Well File"" and download the file. Go to page 51. Shell, the original operator of this field, had a blowout of ""non-inflammable gas"" (i.e. helium-bearing) in the deeper Cambrian section of the CCA. It took 17 days to get the well under control (i.e. tons of gas was roaring out of this wellbore). This gas contains helium (worth more than $200 per Mcf). DST information can be found on page 54. This zone was NEVER produced. Cedar Creek Anticline is roughly 175,000 acres. Conservatively, if helium reserves are 10-20 Bcf, then that equates to $2 to $4 billion of helium value. Given shear size of the CCA, reserves could be much, much higher. For those who don't know much about helium, Google about its value and uses - there is an abundance of information. IF there ever was a buyer for Denbury, THIS is likely what they’d be after. Could be a huge resource for Nitrogen as well. A possible buyer: an industrial gas company like Linde or Air Products."
Rusty .....as a bonus the company has much better management than it used to have. And no embarrassing missteps or silly initiatives like it used to regularly suffer. Shows in the stock price...as it should.Now.....if their Board would actually DO something about reigning in wildly excessive executive compensation I'd REALLY be impressed.
"Overall I am happy with the results. Missing the market's guess on profits by less than 1% isn't too bad when the overall results are still an 11% increase in profits. The sales numbers coming in slightly lower are disappointing, but it sounds like overall the sales are holding steady with just currency fluctuations causing the ""drop"". Since I know how much headwinds they are facing in overseas markets thanks to the trade wars some politicians are happily kicking off, this 1% decline that is mostly due to currency fluctuations isn't really that surprising. I will be concerned if the company continues to struggle to grow their sales during the next fiscal year, but I'm not ready to declare the sky is falling just yet."
"hmm, why the drop today. Valuation is a bit rich but dont see a catalyst for this.I cut back at 228 in hopes of getting back in at 210.come to me"
Does anyone think the withdraw in Afghanistan has anything to do with the stock under perform? Afghanistan is rich in rare earth metals so there could be a correlation here.... thoughts?
Whats the latest on the Jazan project start?
The proposed Versum Board.....strikes me as a very bad sign.
"It’s pretty simple. 5 straight missed earnings quarters. 6 out of 7. Lowered guidance. Continuing to blame it on Covid and no favorable news on the Jazan financial closing that was originally expected last September that was most recently promised (during the 9 August analysts call) to close by the end of this September. I guess it would be too much to expect that deal to get done early however it will be no surprise that September rolls into October with no communication whatsoever on Jazan’s status. Perhaps it’s being further delayed causing the sell off? APD is quickly approaching a 52 week low as it’s only $15 from it, all the while the DOW and its industrial peers are all close to 52 week highs. Disappointing to say the least. Shareholders have reason to be very unhappy."
Over priced. Wait for Q2 financials. Overvalued stock
What’s up folks? I’ve been watching for a little bit.. missed earnings by 2 cents and dropped 31$? Am I missing something? I’m looking at jumping in APD tomorrow because that seems like a huge overreaction
"Mike,Are these North American percentage price increases for this Fall season similar to those of prior years? A 25% (for hydrogen) seems like quite a jump (33%) when the producer price index increase is much lower."
"Selling this. I was in Plug for the long run but when there is news about fraud, I am out, without thinking. Going to move to a safer play, $APD"
This one is getting hammered like no tomorrow. Trends may continue till Friday. Not advisable to take position at current price.
"bring back the ""old"" message board !!!!!"
"So....it's reported that one officer, their VP of Gases, is leaving the company at age 55 to ""pursue other opportunities"" and is contractually entitled to a $2.6MM severance payment. Not including his pension I'm sure. His base salary is reportedly $600K. And....potentially a $1MM bonus by Dec 2019 IF an unnamed development project meets some milestones... a year and a half AFTER he's long gone. One wonders if the average employee's motivation is affected by such news after they've watched thousands of jobs and several businesses eliminated. Anybody think their Board is really doing a good job in managing executive compensation and contracts? I know, I know, executive ""talent"" don't come cheap and current practices reflect the market for it. Frankly....I don't buy that line of rationalization. Am I alone on that? I wonder......"
Up $17 after hours. Wow!!
ive owned this for 15 years and I think this is the first earnings miss I have seen.Its all about the HHydrogen is gaining traction and that changes APD from a boring industrial gas company to a leading provider of main global energy source
What happend today?
This stock is starting to get on my nerves...
**210 target chart really breaking down. Lower highs lower lows
So we have a uptick in co2 for vaccine transport... we have an uptick in h2 for hydrogen vehicles and other alternative energy opportunities and we have an increase covid hospitalization rate requiring oxygen... seems like a perfect storm for higher demand over the next few months. $300+ is certain
$260 level soon.
Liquid gases are a MUST HAVE for transporting the Covid Vaccines!Especially when 2 doses are needed! I'm buying in as seems like the market has not realised the potential yet.... The hose will flow to liquid gases soon.
Air Products & Chemicals reached an all time high at 306.26
Nice run up just below $170. Might see a near term correction back to $162-$166 unless it breaks resistance at $170-172. This is a high quality blue chip stock.
They missed earnings again?
Does air products sell carbon dioxide
Bought in at $255. I think the sell-off is an overreaction.
"Chart not looking good. Break down of that support and retracement, classic breakdown to the downside.Looks like a target of 220 in the short term IMO"
Trying to understand why the fluctuation with this stock. New to this board. Thanks.
"as a long time shareholder, and my largest holding, my pipe dream for APD was that Hydrogen would become a legit fuel for cars and trucks.It looks like this is happening.APD which looked expensive as a gas producer now looks cheap as a Hydrogen supplier.I really hope this doesnt get bought out before H goes big."
sooner or later people will realize that APD is a Hydrogen play
tomorrow morning BMO conference should hear more about APD's roll in saving the world and fighting COVID through dry ice...
Good time to add today? Do you see this stock going to $200 by years end?
"This is a good inflation play. when the market stops getting surprised by inflation data, this will get a boost.(not sure how any conscious analyst is getting surprised by inflation data, but apparently that is happening)"
"My goodness, APD is getting clobbered!!! What does that say given institutions hold 85% or so of shares. They must be very unhappy with results and have what they think are far better alternatives."
Anyone pick up more shares? $$$$
"UK approves Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, rollout due next week Big day for APD"
"Building a position here just like last time, if it falls more, I’ll buy more. Easy money and a no brainer."
Why is this stock a ski slope?
down $20 on a buy rating and $315 price target... nice
Hope to see some more chatter in the street publications. I think this has been sideways long enough people stopped thinking about it. Need people to notice that it's getting back to its Jan 6 recovery level
"Any reason why ADP up so much so fast lately, anyone?"
"love APD. it has been a boring rock solid money maker for years.but, if Hydrogen becomes a legit fuel for cars, APD is going to go parabolic."
"I will never understand this space. they missed earnings yet again, but this time it jumps 3%?"
"David.....APD's ""strategy"" isn't clear to me. Beyond striving to extract better returns on capital. I don't think they've yet figured out how to actually grow their businesses. Until they show they know that I wouldn't expect much excitement for the stock."
"This stock just hit my radar......had it on my watchlist ......not buying yet, but maybe soon. Decent Div to pay you as you wait .....we shall see..."
A lot of selling volume today driving the price down....after release of very good Q1 results. Any thoughts on what's driving that?
"wow this thing bounced back quickly, didn't get the sub 150 order in time. wow"
Get in now close $296
Is it time to get rid of Air Products stock
APD reached a new All Time High at 173.22
Inspiration hit me and I sold a few days ago I was thinking the earnings is gone look badNow I think I’m gone buy cheaper it remains a wonderful company with a lot potential in the future
Did APD find a cure for the virus? Im happy but why the good day?
Tomorrow we might get some good news out of the Citi 2020 Basic Materials Virtual Conference
That is a lot of apd co2 and dry ice wow... watch the videos... with the dry ice shortage apd should be making a mint... they better not be giving it away for free
Very high PE (33)SB ~ 15
we are busy at work
"This APD conversation board is a lifeless as the stock seems to be since the 10 May surprise uptick on identical earnings miss results that caused the stock to tumble 10-15% each of the prior two quarters. Like me I guess everyone is waiting for startup news of the LuAn gasifiers and the Jazan financing being completed to take this stock to the next level as it’s seeing low trading volumes and little movement up or down the past 10 days. None the less the future is bright for APD. It will see 400 before it sees 200 again. APD is pointed in the right direction. Hydrogen, Ammonia, Gasification and Helium Projects on top of the usual ASU Projects will pave the way to 400..."
Super cold gases and dry ice will be required to ship the covid vaccine. Massive global opportunity
https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/first-mass-air-shipment-of-pfizers-covid-vaccine-arrives-as-airlines-prepare-for-more.html
And we pay their executives HOW much ??
"Wonder what triggered, the $6.00 plus today? Didn’t see any new news/updates."
I want to buy more but I have no idea of what's crashing this thing. I don't see any news. other than a bunch of analysts slightly lowered the price target. Except for one they are all still above 300.
"What in particular about APD is causing this big sell off, way bigger than the market selloff?"
Apd also makes dry ice... not only do they sell co2 for dry ice making but they also have a dry ice company... which will be important when they start shipping the vaccine world wide https://www.airproducts.expert/uk/dry-ice/https://www.acpco2.com/en/dry-ice
i love this company but it is getting pricey. just how much money will they make from a helium shortage
I bought $280 calls August 20th. I feel confident.
They started to ship the vaccines and apd give them the cold iceTarget 300
More Opportunity today my friends! $$$
290 will be a huge test 
"Stock is dead. I assume quarterly results and possibly, Jazan project could impact. Competitor, LIN, is “cleaning “, APD’s clock, at the present time."
Wow no recovery in sight today. I am adding more if it dips below $282 lol
"It'd be wise to watch Versum closely. The composition of its Board and the pay level of its CEO may send signals as to whether the stock should be held or it should be gotten rid of asap. I believe Novo's compensation at APD had been in the neighborhood of $2.5MM.....I'm not of the opinion that a CEO of a business the size of Versum would warrant that unless, and until, the business proves itself when standing on its own two feet."
Time to get in Right now before the closing.Up 2% AH
"So, what do you guys think? up or down? next quarter medical oxygen will decrease, the question is oil refining..."
"i've always liked this stock but the run up from 150 levels seems a little fast to me. can anyone explain a rational reason why people are paying a 27 PE on a materials sector stock. I love the materials sector, but let's face it, it doesnt get a lot of love lately from the big banks."
Wow down $8 on no news. If we get back to $270 I will add more.
Pulled the trigger at 264...If it’s going down I will buy more
Overreaction to the downgrade? No volume today
"APD buyout of ACP is going to turn into a fruitful opportunity this year...“ReliabilityWe are known for the quality of our CO2 and our reliable delivery.Since 1897, we have never failed to deliver to a single customer.We have a Dry Ice production capacity of 13 tonnes per hour as well as an extensive network of Dry Ice partners”“ACP, the largest independent carbon dioxide (CO2) business in Continental Europe. “"
"Air Products, way better than my own gas products. Go APD."
"As of yesterday’s close, the year long delayed Jazan Project financing that was instrumental in leading to 5 straight missed earnings quarters has netted a total gain of 66 cents since Monday’s announcement of its financing completion. The volume of shares traded on Monday’s announcement (1.2 million) was barely above the daily volume of 894,000.On Monday’s announcement the stock opened at its high for the day at $269.00 and drifted lowered the entire day closing at $261.91 only 26 cents above the days low of $261.65.For Monday’s completion of the biggest investment in Air Products history the results have been pathetic and unacceptable. There are 22 analysts covering APD. Of the 22 analysts the high target is $360. The average target is $314.82. The low target of all 22 analysts is $269. As of yesterday’s $258.72 closing price APD is $10.28 below the lowest analysts target. 52 week high of $327.89. 52 week low of $245.75. As of yesterday’s $258.72 closing price APD is only $12.98 from its 52 week low. As of Tuesday shares of APD have declined 10.9% against an industry rise of 21.9%. Shareholders have every reason to be very unhappy about this and the fact that management has yet to acknowledge the year long stock collapse from its 9 November high of $327.89 or its most recent $305 high on 2 June. Full disclosure and accountability to the shareholders..."
8 shares @ $263 right after the drop a couple of days ago. Thanks APD
"I see another $20-30 near term upside...seems to me a better value at this point than LIN, others peers."
"Love these boring defensive stocks right now. APD, REYN, etc."
Why don’t they release a PR or official statement on their role in vaccine logistic? Either not true or no significant enough? Can they not say anything yet?
I added more shares today just under $158. Good long term buy at these levels.
"How much more, does anyone think, APD has left?"
"Cramer Says Musk Is Wrong By Focusing On Electric, Says Hydrogen Is Greatif cramer is right here, APD will make the longs very rich.imagine investing in oil when most people were still riding horses."
"Finally!!!! Somebody seems to be buying today. Then again, the day is young,"
Jazan!! Gonna happen! Pretty sure APD bottomed last week!
Air Products and Chemicals is down 4.92% to 276.52
APD’s dry ice factory is in Belgium... Pfizer’s vaccine’s are shipping from Brussels... no one has the capacity that Apd in that area... quite exciting to be involved in saving the world ;)
I agree. The old message board is better!
"The irrational selling continues. I always wonder how much is driven by conscious decisions by people and how much is driven by algorithms that say to run away based on the slightest of unexpected results. I'm afraid Wall Street is a short-term ""trading"" casino not a rational source for ""investing."""
Bought a bunch of calls on this puppy today.
the market really hates the lack of guidance
Amazing buy and hold company for sure. Best of the breed dividend aristocrat.
Remember 3 months ago I said this stock was a great buy!
Down $4 after earnings miss.
Alot of #$%$ off shareholders today......revenues up but the revenue never makes it to the bottom line. Not a good story. Still....they have that new $400MM HQ palace to look forward to I suppose.
Air Products refuses to give up the ghost. We shall see how long this last.
"I’m so bullish on this stock. Of the top 10 dry ice producers, this is the only one in the US (where MRNA and PFE are stationed) but they also have exposure in Europe. Every vaccine dose, especially PFE will need this for transport AND dry ice is already a sought after commodity for a ton of different functions. Sit back and print money"
"Being punished, today, for last quarters miss. I do not understand, how they can miss, this often."
"Of my earlier post of factual information one particular comment stated “As of Tuesday shares of APD have declined 10.9% against an industry rise of 21.9%.” This difference is over the past year as reported in Zacks 28 September news release of AP increasing product pricing of North America products. That’s a combined difference of 22.8%. If AP only match it’s industrial peers over the past year, yesterday’s $258.72 close would be $317.71 however AP claims to be the most profitable Industrial gas company in the world so it should be higher on that basis. APD opened today at $260.22. It reached it days high of $260.86 the first 15 minutes of trading. The days low was $256.07 which occurred one minute prior to market close as APD closed at $256.10, only 3 cents above the days low. At 3:34 pm today APD was up 20 cents at $258.92. The last 26 minutes of market trading APD lost $2.81 as it closed down $2.61 to $256.11.This trend of reaching its days high the first 30 minutes of market open and closing at or close to its days low has been going on for a greater percentage of trading days since reaching its high of $327.89 on 9 November. Today’s volume was 734,333. Average volume is 902,231. Four days after the announcement of the closing of the biggest investment in AP history the stock continues to flounder with little to no buying interest. Like my earlier post, all factual information..."
November 9th this was $327... today $275... seems like we have a longgg way to go :) and covid vaccines shipping as early as December 11th! Next 6 months will be booming... the vaccine requires 2 doses to be effective!!
time to buy
So glad i got in on those cheap March $300 calls last week. we may be $330 plus by end of year !
Bounces back to $300
I think 300 îs coming soon
$APD Reiterated by Barclays Buy Upgraded by Bank of America Neutral » Buy USD 305
Greg good question. They just announced a substantial price increase two days ago on industrial gas products and it was met with yet another stock price drop. One would think this stock would start to look attractive to investors considering the 10 month fall from $327.89 on 9 November and knowing the long delayed Jazan Project financial closing is pending however that’s not been the case as it gets ever closer to a 52 week low. This stock was at $305 on 2 June. Like a broken record 5 straight missed earnings quarters is the culprit IMO. Should 5 turn into 6 come the November earnings release this stock will approach $200. If you compare the DOW and it’s industrial gas competitors performance over the same timeframes APD should be a lot closer to 400 than 200. Instead most everyday it continues to lose ground to both. That this extended stock collapse has yet to be acknowledged or addressed by management is very disappointing. Shareholders have every reason to be very unhappy.
APD looking very cheap and PX very expensive... $18 per share swing in PX favor YTD. Pair trade time?
"I feel pretty good about APD. pricing power is important and when inflation hits, APD will be just fine.which is why it is bouncing back lately.(and inflation is happening, dont believe this 'transitory' garbage)The only things seeing higher prices are food, gas, energy, labor, autos, and clothing.so, as long as you dont need to buy those things, you wont be affected by inflation."
I guess people were sleeping instead of buying yesterday? oh well......
I sure do love giving up an entire day's gain one day later.
"Ashley well stated! With lowered guidance, LuAn and Jazan in the fold it would be shocking if they missed earnings once again come 4 November. They are due to break the streak. If they do or simply increase forward guidance you will see the 9 November $327.89 all time high bite the dust before Thanksgiving. Though it had been an excruciatingly painful past 4 months since getting back to $305 on 2 June and tumbling all the way from $327.89 on 9 No ember I have said all along APD is in the right markets and it’s only a matter of time until it pops. Well to all of the investors that kept selling off APD off thru last Wednesday 6 October when the stock hit $252 (only $7 from a 52 week low), CRY ME A RIVER!Onward to $400 APD goes..."
"Rusty0601.....your target buy back is fast approaching. Yet another very, very bad day for APD. It may have gotten a little ahead of itself but the scale of this drop is hard to understand."
"I love this stock. it has treated me well over the years.when my wife wanted to sell everything in march, I said I would get a divorce before I sell this under $200.but now it is closing in on $250. It just seems a bit rich. If I sell, I will be waiting anxiously to get back in lower."

What Air Products did with Plug Power is criminal in nature by hijacking their hydrogen supply at astronomical costs!!!....Invest in PLUG and exit APD now...better own companies like PLUG that know how to serve their customers and at the same time work towards better and green future for our next generations
"Good question, it seems as if companies don't split their stock as much as a few years ago"
skyrocketing hydrogen demand and prices going higher not down
apd ceo confirmed they are working with governments and drug companies for covid 19
not sure if you guys caught it but the CEO also said the stock was undervalued and they APD deserves a higher premium... P/E multiple
"“Selesky gives APD shares a $360 price target, suggesting 33% growth ahead, and maintains a Buy rating on the stock.“"
"Any thoughts, on APD, going forward?"
$BE just unveiled the most efficient electrolyzer on the market 15-40% more efficient than current technology.

October 30th APD was $271 and by November 9th it was $328 almost... 7 trading days... this thing can easily do this again as vaccines actually start to ship
Waiting for 255 again. Then I'll average down.
In with those 300 calls... too cheap ez money coming. Hearing from those in biotech sector that distribution is going to be a big problem for these vaccines
APD dropped $65 not because of a 2% miss on profits but solely because of the unexpected startup delay of their 12 billion dollar Jazan Project. Air Products now has to come up with another 7 billion dollars to finalize the deal and subsequent start up. The CEO told the analysts “not to count their chickens before their hatched” however it wasn’t the analysts who were touting this Project since its inception and it’s expected September 2020 startup. It was Air Products. At nearly 2 trillion net worth Saudi Aramco could walk away from this Project and not even blink an eye. If this turns out to be another Tees Valley Project APD will see below 200 before it sees 400 regardless of CO2 and dry ice for Covid shipments.
AP is a terrible company to work if you are an employee. The new CEO has tripled the work of regular employees by cutting tons of jobs. All the while he collects $15 mm for doing nothing. A few years ago their EVP of Gas Division North America left the company to become a CEO of another company. He was paid a $1 mm for the completion of a project after he left the company.
"Accumulated shares in the 160-180 range pre-pandemic 2+ years ago. This is a solid international company, proven financial performer over time, and a reasonably clean industry. Sold 1/3 of my Amazon on a stop loss last week, now increasing shares, getting back on board with these guys. AMZN has moribund performance for 9 months now. With Bezos selling big, his ex selling big, old and new execs with vested stock options cashing in plus hedge fund managers reducing positions, their stock faces heavy selling pressure for the foreseeable future. The decision to reallocate to APD was an easy one, and I will sleep good at night."

Over the years, they’ve translated that vision into innovative, practical and money-making applications.Whitney is best known for inventing a method for separating silver and other precious metals from spent photographic liquid. Itronics uses the demetallized fluid to make micronutrient-rich fertilizers at its Reno, Nevada, plant, while the metals are turned into bullion and sold to refineries. Additionally, the glass slag produced in Itronics’ refining process can be used to manufacture commercial products, such as decorative tile.Itronics is not standing still. Within the last four years, the Company has developed a way to reclaim precious metals—including gold, silver and palladium—as well as copper and tin—from discarded computer circuit boards. It has simply added the e-scrap as infeed material for its refinery process.In that process, silver is not only recovered from photographic waste, but its chemical makeup allows it to soak up metals from circuit boards during furnace refining. The metals then become ingredients in the Company’s bullion.Because of this e-scrap breakthrough, Itronics is buying more furnaces to ramp up bullion production and will eventually bring in larger furnaces. Whitney has even modified a furnace so that it burns latent heat energy from carbon in circuit boards, reducing outside energy needed to power the furnace by more than 50 percent.For that furnace innovation, Whitney and Itronics won an award from NV Energy, a Nevada public power company.""Recycling Today” Details Itronics’ Successes, Future PlansRENO, Nev., Jan. 29, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The following news release includes portions of an article appearing in “Recycling Today,” the premium publication in this sector.

I'm getting hurt bad. I'm in the red on a few hundred shares. Thought this stock was safe. Wondering if I should average down.
Nibble now for the long term.
"Bought my first position in APD, 250 shares.Added to my Carrier (Carr) position too."

"Anyone think, APD will split, in the near future?"
buying on this dip
I think the H2 demand could be significant 12-24 months out
Pinko.....we GET it about the Clinton crime family. But it's hard to fathom what your post has to do with APD. I....for one....would appreciate it if posts like this find some other home.
any guess on where it bottoms?
Stumbled across this stock a couple weeks ago. How is this not severely undervalued. The industrial gases business is projected to have so much growth over the coming years. Double the current price doesn't sound out-of the ordinary
Correction. That’s a combined difference of 32.8% (not 22.8%) between APD shares the past year and the industry meaning if AP only matched the industry yesterdays $258.72 closing price would be $343.58 (not $258.72). Thats a huge difference!
New joint venture will definitely expand the multiple... any speculation on taking this private or maybe a candidate for merger?
This stock seems poised to take off. It tried yesterday.

"David....thanks, good response. But...with sales dollars increasing HOW do they keep missing earnings? Are the folks running this outfit not incentivized enough? Full disclosure...CEO pay levels are perhaps my pet peeve, has been for several decades in fact. Hopes seem to rest on the Jazan project....I don't know the details but I worry it might become the huge fiasco that energy project in Britain became. Management owes shareholders a better explanation than they're getting IMO. Something is wrong here."

"For those questioning whether they want to get in, I really suggest listening to their latest conference call. I didn't know about Blue Hydrogen when I invested in this company, but considering that they plan to lead the field in it, it gives me a whole new perspective on the company. In the near term, blue hydrogen could make hydrogen a very viable option, increasing demand, while research continues into better ways of producing green hydrogen."
So glad I had the opportunity to recently add a few more shares below $255!

Not sure what I'm missing so I'm in buy mode here."
"I sold recently well over 300 I think, and rebought yesterday and today. This is a great price."
"Boy, this has been a dead piece of my portfolio. Oh well. Patience, patience."
"Increased quarterly dividend 12 percent to $1.50 per share, that right there is why I am a happy shareholder for over a decade. when my wife panicked in March, i said that i really dont care because we own strong companies that raise their dividend. 3% becomes 6% becomes 12% Yield on Cost over time.I just hope they say Hydrogen alot in the conf call."
So where do you suppose all the dry ice will come from for Pfizers vaccine storage?
"I have to tip my hat to ""David"" for the quality of his posts. Far better than most....and data supported. I might like him on the Board of APD."
"Sales up 13% and profits down 3% which is something like $12MM or so. Something wrong here and it wasn't explained very well to my way of thinking. Personally, I've long wondered how the cost of the new $400MM HQ under construction affected the numbers. I'd also ask how much they expect to recover towards its cost by the sale of its existing HQ and its land. And when."
"Air Products continues to look strong. Will be interesting, to see how this continues. Very healthy project backlog. Sitting on cash."
"It's not at all clear to me what Yahoo was trying to accomplish with their re-do of this site....they've ruined the message board where conversational threads could be followed easily and tossed too many other features, like insider purchases/sales, that really are relevant and could conveniently be found in one place.It's one thing to ""refresh"" a site....it's another to ruin it. Personally, I'd love to hear audio tapes of the meetings that took place when the geniuses at Yahoo were developing these changes. If Yahoo is smart they'll listen and bring back some of the features they dropped."
Pfizer drug recommended for approval by fda panel... it’s funny to see the things that will benefit a year from now rally while apd will benefit day 1 from approval and months to come...
"David....very, very well put.... ""this extended stock collapse has yet to be acknowledged or addressed by management is very disappointing. Shareholders have every reason to be very unhappy"". Then again......maybe they like, and expect, to be handed a boatload of options and stock grants at a low price??"
"Thanks for the cheap shares, I added more today down $5"
@Bemo yes! Visa is another stock that I own.
Don't forget to buy on the dips! $$$
Louisiana contract secured! Always liked that state.
"Hi, anybody have any insight into why APD stocks down all week?"
"I keep hearing all the time thousands of pounds of dry ice will be needed when the vaccine roles out soon. That having been said, wouldn’t APD be a likely candidate as the supplier?"
"Will be interesting, to see quarterly report tomorrow. Timing of dividend increase is interesting."
Air Products & Chemicals reached an all time high at 259.67
APD big covid play.. dry ice shortage and APD has the key ingredient... probably will get some government contracts to help... PFE needs dry ice to send the Covid Vaccine...
"This stock is a beast, good dividends also"
Interesting. Never heard the $300 comment.
I quit... Today I quid APD. APD you have been the most miserable stock I have owned. Everyday you open up optimistically then sell off throughout the day
People will be disappointed when earnings come out. Medical O2 sales will not be enough to overcome hydrogen sales shortfall. Refiners use H2...at least they used to?
Wow very nice dividend increase announced. $1.10
Why is this down another $5.00 in after hours?
The materials sector is getting its teeth kicked in and APD has remained fairly flat. Seems like a good sign.
100s of millions of doses going out needing dry ice and co2 from apd every 5 days... and each person needs 2 doses... no brained here
Big article for APD
SHEP. HERE....................... I own some APD and my husband owns LIN. They have traded alike until the recent sell off in APD. I think the sell off was totally over done. Cramer was touting LIN for hydrogen. But I would think APD would be the same.
"APD had better get the revenue line moving upward. I think it ridiculous to lavish bonuses and stock options on executives for simply eliminating jobs and cutting costs. Or...as a decades old commercial once put it.....""where's the beef?"""
Some low-ranking money managers keep dumping APD shares which are awfully underappreciated by Wall Street!
Hydrogen is where its at!
"This has been really disappointing and totally unexpected. If your thinking about loading up the boat, trailer and truck hold off! APD has missed 4 out of the last 5 quarters. The CEO told the analysts he expects Jazan to start up by June. Come Mays quarterly earnings the same questions will be asked about the Jazan startup that were asked yesterday. If it hasn’t started up by next May’s quarterly earnings what makes you think the next quarters earnings will be any different then the previous 4 of 5. It was reported AP would slap a law suit on Saudi Armanco if the terms of agreement weren’t met or Saudi Aramco pulls the plug. If either of them happen APD could easily fall another $30-$40. Furthermore a downgrade was obvious after yesterday’s results. A 2nd downgrade is possible. Lastly the DOW is due for a downward correction. What direction do you think this beaten down stock will head on a DOW downturn? You don’t have to be a genius to figure that one out. As usual today it’s doing it’s daily downward trend. It’s likely to fall an additional $10 on top of yesterday’s $20 drop. To think APD was 328.89 on the morning of 9 November. Had Jazan of started up as originally forecasted and expected in September APD would be at 400. Woulda, shoulda, coulda. Instead we will be approaching 200. As I stated before and was repeated by another earlier post, should the Jazan Project start up, that’s one day you want to be all in on APD! Good luck and hopefully prosper."
"galleon....re: a split. I'm not sure what a split would do for them, or us. A long, long time ago stocks split so that a round lot (100 shares) would be ""affordable"" for individual investors and minimize trading costs. Times have changed....institutions and funds hold 90% of many stocks and affordability isn't an issue for them and trading costs are a fraction of what they used to be. There are many, many big names whose share price is far above what APD's is. So....I don't see any reason APD needs to split or what it'd gain by doing so."
I really hope this is not a repeat of the past 5 quarters. I’m very optimistic this has been a great week. Very excited what the future holds.I’ve increased my position so we will see.so I’ll be eating my chef salad and maybe we can add some meat if this continues
Down $8 on no news? Must be China
most people don't realize that APD is an inflation hedge. and inflation is happening. prices of everything are going up.
