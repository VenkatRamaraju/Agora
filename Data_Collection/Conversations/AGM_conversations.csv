Very nice movement these last few days. Looks to me that we challenge the old highs before too long.AGM still very undervalued and not well understood by the investment world. That spells opportunity.

Agm--I love companies doing well with almost nobody following. Latest numbers show that farmers are having record incomes so lenders should do well.
up 16% on light volume? Check out the spread between bid/ask...........stock is tightly held.

"What's not to like. Growing. $3.20 div gives 5.1% yield. 2020 EPS est is 8.72 for a PER of 7X. Only one analyst per Yahoo, If any others pick it up it will be only good news. Basically serves as a kind of Fannie Mae for farm loans."

Haven't worked the Q3 numbers in detail but it looks like gangbusters to me. One published EPS est of $9.77 (golly back in the day when I worked as a sell side analyst I didn't have courage to publish estimates to the penny) would appear to be supportive of a dividend increase to $3.40 sometime in the next few quarters which gives a yield of 4.9% even after today's stock gain. Despite recent gains I think this stock is a no brainer.

Thinly traded jewel with a nice divvy coming up.
Banks are up and we are down...............
why dip ?
AGM reached a 52 Week low at 58.43
This company is still under the radar....reluctance to invest more boldly by institutions is due to past memories of Fannie Mae debacle......not a true comp. but still an influencer of investor thought.

Up move on volume would breakout of bullish triangle.
Solid but nothing outstanding in quarterly numbers or CC. I bought it for a 5% yield but not down to 3.5 area. Decent value but no longer exciting. Wish I were long term.

"Q2 numbers looked good but kind of iffy because while loan quality as reported looked fine about 1% of loans were operating under ""forbearance"". If these turn into problem loans--as would appear possible--reported earnings would drop. On the plus side, the only analyst on Yahoo with an estimate has an estimate of $9.75 for next year. If achieved and company holds to a 35% payout the divvy could rise from current $3.20 to $3.40 an increase of ~7% and a yield of ~4.9% at present price. A 5% yield and 7% growth is a potential return of 12%. There is a bad loan risk but IMHO this is an attractive situation for investors seeking above average current income with some growth--and I own it."

"Very impressive report....this is not Fannie-Mae or Freddie-Mac, or some Sallie Mae scam, but a real company that has its s--- together trying to help farmers who need the help AGM provides.One can talk about EVs (electric vehicles) all one wants but if the country starves to death, it simply will not matter one iota. AGM remains a bedrock holding of my ""barbell portfolio,"" a mix of conservative divvy companies plus a handful of biotechs."
Can anyone explain the difference between AGM and AGM. A?

Good quarter. A big plus--only one analyst on CC--lots of room for WS to discover this company. If earnings stay on track there will probably be a small dividend increase in the first quarter.

"EGO will outperform other gold miners since not all have such a big asset. It will be JV as CEO said for funding purposes and to reduce operational risk. To do this you need a major miner like Barrick, Newmont, Agnico, Newcrest. And when you look at what buyers need Skouries fits that model because of tons of copper as base metal. $gold $nem $agm $ncmgf"

I noticed this board is very quiet. I thought this stock would be worth an investing shot. Where is everyone? I only own major stocks like AAPL and MSFT but wanted to get some different stocks in my portfolio was looking at this one really hard... Any thoughts?
