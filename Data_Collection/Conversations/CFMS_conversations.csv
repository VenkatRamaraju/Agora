Will doctors continue to install knees from a.75 company?
Going to $2.25 soon
"Make of it what you will. We’ve been here several times in recent years. Huge volume, price run up, then crickets while we revisit.75-.80. I sure hope there is some good news coming. Aetna is set to review coverage again, and of course earnings are coming soon. GLTA"
MedicMike just might be right. This stock might just be a dog
"Today's stock movement seems to be an over reaction. The offering is at 1.05/share, yet the market is valuing cfms at about 1.15, so not exactly a down vote on the near/long-term outlook. The offering, plus cash on hand means about $115m in cash. One could conclude company is readying for a post-covid business surge. Gross margins, already about 50%, probably heading higher given covid induced pent up demand.Offering about doubles outstanding shares, which is a drag.Assuming cfms' products deliver as advertised, covid vaccine saves the day, and cfms management doesn't screw up, cfms is a winner. Just a matter of time and favorable weather."
"Milk these cows.Royalty and licensing revenue of $10.2 million, an increase of 1,210% year-over-year, as a result of our $9.6 million settlement and license agreement with Zimmer Biomet in the second quarter of 2020.Gross margin of 49%, an increase of 160 basis points year-over-year, was driven primarily by the increase in royalty and licensing revenue in 2020."
E b o n. All week long....YouTube search box. New bitmain mini crypto mining boxesThe magnificent one
Stryker is getting everything on the cheap! Buy the company why don’t you!
Institutions bought another $33MM in CFMS stock in Q2. I am staying long. The price should be much higher.
How to run a company to the ground? Just ask CFMS management they are experts at it.
"Back in 2015, conformis' innovative products were at a disadvantage in many ways. CT scan is not necessary for existing products of large artificial joint companies. However, for Conformis personalized arthroplasty, CT scans are a must (MRI is not required), and it would have been more expensive than the prices of ready-made artificial joints from large companies (SYK, Zimmer..). Therefore, insurance companies (because of lack of evidence claiming excellence) did not accept conformis products. And there was a problem of having to wait 8 weeks for the product to be made and operated. In recent years, the development of IT and manufacturing has been shortened to 3 weeks, and the reduction in surgery time and hospitalization period is a patient-friendly product. In a recent peer review article, it has been proven that the surgical results are more satisfactory and cost-effective compared to conventional large-sized artificial joint products. And the new ASC product has received FDA approval. Currently, this product is not distributed in the Far East, but we look forward to using it in Korea soon."
"Long talk with young orthopedic physician. Uses what he was exposed to in residency, not ConforMIS. Patients have to be educated to demand custom implants. Doctors will pay attention when patients are looking for ConforMIS doctors. They just aren’t going to spontaneously switch products unless and until a new product is really superior, or until it is marketable to the public as unique to their practices. Perhaps ConforMIS should offer limited time protected service areas. Make something happen!!"
is there a conference coming up or a shareholder meeting next week?
5 million shares today getting a lot of attention now that it’s over one dollar a lot of funds are not allowed to buy under a dollar￼
Cross 50 MACross 200 MAOnly 100 MA is waiting herePress release make here Ultra Bullish .......
"Judging from level 2, short sellers are trying to keep the lid on 1.40."
I am buying the dips today.
"What's happening here? I thought the Q2 report was fairly positive, at least US revenue is moving in the right direction. Were investors expecting more?"
ConforMIS (CFMS) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.
Just printed at 1.91
Where's Medic Mike with his words of wisdom now. Gone in the wind
This is what the CEO said during the last quarter review “￼ We expect our second quarter product revenue to improve sequentially from the first quarter”
They need to announce job cuts on the earnings release. only thing that will show management gets it.
The MARKET itself is down(RED) again. So nothing we can do than HOLD and BUY MORE if you can!Selling for a lost is the biggest mistake for this business.Hoping next week will be a good week for all of us! $NNDM$OPTT $DOGE $OCGN $OZSC $HCMC $CFMS $ENZC $VXRT $INKW $NIO $EH $CCIV $SOS $APPL $TSLA $CLVS $ZOM
Showed up on my rising stars screen.. had to have it.. as virus numbers go down and beds open up in hospitals we can get back to pre-virus numbers for elective surgeries.. here we go nah... hehe THE MAX
"on the S&N Journey II: I hear from the physicians I work with that the fit is not as ""tight"" as the more highly customized implants from Conformis. A tighter, more ergonomic fit means the prosthesis is less prone to failure."
"Wow, over 13 million shares traded, & almost 700k at the close??"
I love discovering companies at these price. Def buying right now
HOLD... This is not the time to exit...We have crossed 52 week high and will keep breaking records...
Can someone explain the why the market reacting this way to good earnings. I blame the Cathy pump.
"Based on the speed of rise and volume so far this morning, looks like insiders knows something. Is Aetna lifting their mis-categorization? Is there a buyout? Is there something major happening?"
https://discord.gg/g9zQtTt
"Over the last 52-week period, shares of Conformis are up 112.13%."
Looks like we have a gem hereBased on 2 Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets for ConforMIS in the last 3 months. The average price target is $2.50 with a high forecast of $3.00 and a low forecast of $2.00. The average price target represents a 60.26% change from the last price of $1.56.
"look at the Active NASDAQ right now, CFMS has great VOLUME = high price later when market opens"
"The thing I like about distribution to the top end of the market in Asia is the appeal of a superior, luxury version of an increasingly common product. Plenty of new customers always on the lookout for the flagship product."
"It looks like it is temporary manipulation. I guess, it will be pulled up again soon"
after hours means nothing
"It is not about the $11M received - it is about FDA Clearance to now provide custom disposable instruments for the second largest Total Knee Replacement company in the world. That is where the money comes in- every day, every week, every month."
"I wonder something else, much bigger is in play today. The FDA approval news lifted the stock to 10% initially. Then the second bigger wave came in around 12pm. Is it Stryker acquisition? Atena acceptance? Reddit target?"
"As a physician and recipient of bilateral Stryker knee replacements 10 years ago I wish I could have had a prosthesis that was designed specifically to my anatomic contour as Conformis does today, not the best fit that you can find off the shelf for a person my size. I have done well with my prosthesis, but if I had to do it over again I would go with Conformis. That is why I invested in the company."
No brainer hold add repeat .Accumulating
"I had posted a current NYTs story that points out that robot assisted surgery is not any better than non-assisted surgery, as it relates to complications. If that is true for MAKO, et al, it strengthens the ConforMIS story."
Buying at a discount thank you!
CFMS BUY AND HOLD going up.
"Great move by refinancing the debt and paying off old loan, probably a lower interest rate since the rates are down. The price should go up very soon"
"What’s up, folks?"
Home Run! We are headed NORTH!
What happened to this once promising company?????
CFO Weiner joined the competition!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-surgical-announces-chief-financial-185200296.html
Based upon the volume and the daily climb of the stock there must be takeover interest. The stock has been climbing by 4-5% daily.
I guess we made our 30 days above $1. Does that preserve our listing?
"Been watching this stock for the last 3 years. Just finally pulled the trigger a couple weeks ago and bought in. They have a great product, it’s just the management has sucked. I think it’s finally time for it to blow."
"Thank you ARK! Other institutions have to be eyeing this and once this goes up to $5, more institutions will probably buy. I can’t believe this is still under 2! What a gift!"

"This has got to be the worst management team ( I use that term loosely). Mark was a joke as the sales manager so he was promoted to the CEO position where he has excelled in driving the company in the ground. They just don't get it ... until something is sold everything else is e relevant. Just venting, have been around since the beginning and have never sold a share hoping they would get it together but that seems impossible..."
Ignore medicmike he’s short here and scared sh*tless because they smoked earnings. Product revenue was not too impressive but the company expects a significantly better Q3 in that regard. Should see some buying tomorrow PM!! Good luck everyone
"Congratulations on all good week. I sold half at 1.47, as I saw volume falling off. No regrets. I still think 2.25 is possible, but the old pump and dump scheme has caught me too often."
hope we jump into the green Monday. good luck longs
their Asia sales should come in this quarter and I am expecting huge results from them...
"The key to this company's survival is very simple. They need to realign the cost structure as they have a work force of almost 400 people and continue to bleed cash. Lowering manufacturing costs are not even as SG&A expenses are the real culprit. Cut the workforce by 1/3 and the market will react positively here. The .70 to .75 cents of cash per share won't last too long if they don't control spending. Also, comps for international markets should begin to stabilize here so that will help on the top line. Either way this is a call option with a 3 year expiry."
Just a reminder earnings call tomorrow after the bell at 4:30 pm EST. Should be a real barn burner.
Daily chart set up looks good for next leg up. Loading more Monday
A preview of Conformis earnings The analyst consensus estimate would represent a 233.33% increase in the company's EPS figure. Revenue would be up 69.51% on a year-over-year basis. The company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this: This should put it over Two Dollars
Nice! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/conformis-itotal-cr-knee-replacement-130000203.html
The company should conduct a 1-for-10 reverse stock split to get the price up to a level where more investors would look at it.
great news regarding 3.5 million payment from ZBH now and another 6 million next year - so far wright medical + SNN + SYK and now ZBH have paid patent infringement money to CFMS - woohoooo
"Interestingly, Zimmer is reporting this morning sales down 2.8% are from the affects of fx, or maybe a certain little company is beginning to take market share??"
"I am a retired ortho surgeon - did 1000's of replacement. Medicmike's questions are reasonable. He's not flaming CFMS, just asking the kind of questions we all should ask. That being said, I think CFMS offers a great range of hip and knee products. All hips and knees are not equal and a customizable implant with patient specific instrumentation can save time, and time is money. These days, more and more total joints are being done in orthopedist owned outpatient surgery centers. Surgeons are attracting payers with bundled payment plans - they pay a fixed price, and the surgeon and center manage the cost. The profit is the difference between the payment and the cost. If you can do it better, with fewer complications and faster, you can replace more joints in a day and make more money, so a more expensive implant can be cheaper if it saves time. I have spent a lot of time in the past trying to figure out the correct size of an off the shelf implant both in preop planning and in the OR with trial components. CFMS can make it a no brainer so you can move faster and do more procedures in your surgery center with potentially fewer dislocations in hips, and better ligament balance in knees. They also check all boxes in terms of materials and component coatings. If they irritate the big component makers enough by eroding into their market share, they are an acquisition target. For that reason, I honestly own about 100k shares. I don't do joint replacements any more, and I have no affiliation with CFMS. I know some of the design team and they are solid orthopods."
cheer up
"Anyone been noticing how this stock has been trading in the last few months? There are days it will quickly pop up, and then get seated down shortly after. Then we see huge after hours spikes, and then knocked down again. This stock is being acquired by someone. And, they are slicing out a nice size position. This is how stocks trade before they blow."
Has Cathy Wood bought any more? With such a low market cap has anyone seen any articles on possible acquisition by one of the bigger players?
"BILLERICA, Mass., June 23, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Conformis, Inc. (NASDAQ:CFMS) today announced the execution of an agreement to enter the Asia-Pacific market through an exclusive distribution relationship with XR Medical Group (Hong Kong) Limited (XR Medical).Under the distribution agreement, XR Medical will have exclusive rights for the sale, marketing, and distribution of Conformis’ patient-specific iTotal CR & PS total knee replacement systems, iTotal CR & PS patella devices, and iUni and iDuo partial knee replacement systems. Other products, such as Conformis’ recently approved Identity Imprint knee system and its hip portfolio of products, may be added in the future.XR Medical’s sales team will provide sales and support exclusively to top-tier facilities in Hainan’s Boao Lecheng International Medical Tourism Pilot Zone (Pilot Zone) on behalf of Conformis. The region is a major center of medical tourism for dozens of countries."
Look at that jump - 2$ next
In for 5k shares let’s go
"Class 2 recall on iHip. Hasn’t crushed CFMS, but not helping. Thoughts?"
I always look at the fundamental value of a company. Lets hope all this buying is about a potential buyout.
The PRINT ARK fund has 3% of its total investment in cfms! Over 12 million shares ! A large position ! I am excited! GLTL!
The technology has many potential applications beyond joint replacement.
"The SEC Filing does not specify an offer date, price or number of shares. Also, along with the press release on the offering, CFMS announced preliminary 4th qrt and y/e results. 4th qrt revs up 4% sequentially from 3rd qrt 2020. Not bad given the covid panic. Gross margins also up a bit. Maybe offering will be priced and offered after the official earning report release. 1st qrt 2021 guidance a bit on the down side."
What’s going on with this past few days?
Medic Mike at it again. Always negative on CFMS you must work for the Stryker. I have been watching boards for years never seen someone post so many negative comments for a stock and continue to watch it on a daily basis. If you hate the company why are you always posting comments ? No one ever has done that People ALWAYS look at stocks that they LIKE. No one watches a stock that they hate on a daily basis and continue to post negative comments. It's just NEVER done !!! Common sense folks this guy is a FRAUD And I guarantee he is NO MEDIC
"That was fun. I thought when it broke 4.50 we were safe for the day. Ugh! Firstly trading day of the third quarter, but it doesn’t look like the market is seeing enough upside potential."
AH is excellent too.. we will be rocking tomorrow
"I am excited about the potential this company has to change the industry. 20yrs from now the millennials will start needing replacement parts. Regardless of making money, I really want this to become part of our lives."
8500 shares average under a dollar 
"In the 2Q earnings release in August, it may be too early for the impact of that cash inflow to drive revenues. But I am looking forward to an indication of business momentum in the discussion. $100 million in cash can fund a nice sales and marketing initiative of the new products."
I had faith into CFMS.
Looks like everyone is too scared to hold into earnings. The short term chart turned totally bearish with all the sellers today. I can't believe people were buying it at 1.90 this morning. Anyways good luck to longs.
"It is a golden chance to buy this stock now before its new position in 2018 ... this company will have better revenue & profit & cash flow compared to 2017 . There is no reason to stay in the same position, it will be higher"
"There are the big guys out there like SYK, ZBH, MDT that use fixed sizes. If your knee is 3.05"" wide where they fit you with a 3"" implant. so you have bone overlapping the implant or maybe implant overlapping the bone. Less comfy, chance of irritation, infection, less mobility. It's time for custom implants. These guys are the pioneers. Just launched their custom hip late last year after years of waiting. First half of 2021 should see the knee they co-developed with SYK approved by the FDA. Why would a 92 billion market cap company team up with CFMS? Because this is the future of orthopedics! With the new knee, new hip, and elective surgeries accelerating this should trade at the group (SYK, ZBH, MDT) multiple of 6-7x revenues. With 180m fully diluted shares out that's $3.33 to $3.88 without accounting for the over $100m cash on the BS. The larger guys are growing at 3-7% and CFMS about to start growing at multiples of that with new products and finally having the money from recent deal to attack the reopening opportunity"
I heard about CFMS the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Some people has full time job to post negatives.. We need to keep posting positives ... every one should over write negative comments and put positive comments. there are lot many positive people then negative... keep posting positives and keep everyone motivated...
MedicMIke is full of lies. Anyone with an internet connection can see what ARK is buying & selling on a daily basis. They are the most transparent ETF on planet earth. Here is the link. Scroll down & you will see that CFMS is a top ten holding in ARK's PRNT etf.https://ark-funds.com/3d-printing-etf?__hstc=84851910.935e3c297424387c311e7a5ff7f8d3ac.1628029951769.1628029951769.1628278959402.2&__hssc=84851910.3.1628278959402&__hsfp=1209027052
"Conformis could be an attractive acquisition for a large orthopedic device company such as Stryker, according to an orthopedic surgeon who penned an article on SeekingAlpha.Under the contributor name Carolina Doc, the surgeon noted that ASCs aren't likely to invest in Stryker's Mako robotic system for hip and knee replacements, which costs an estimated $1 million.""There is simply not enough volume of joint replacements to justify the cost,"" said the surgeon, whose center completes three to four joint replacements a month.The author, who owns stock in Conformis, compared the orthopedic devicemaker's newly launched total hip system to Mako.The Conformis total hip system comes in one presterilized box, cutting down the number of trays that must be brought into a surgery center and resterilized for a high price tag, he said. The computer-planned system has also helped some surgeons shorten operative times.However, the company's stock lost almost a third of its market capitalization over the past month, he said. That could be because some patients aren't willing to wait eight weeks for Conformis to manufacture custom implants.""Conformis is therefore losing all those sales completely to another company,"" the Seeking Alpha contributor wrote. ""For that group of patients who are not willing to wait, a larger company could use the Conformis technology … and return with a closest match 'off the shelf' component and the same iView preoperative plan.""Conformis already has a contract to develop patient-specific instruments for the Stryker Triathlon Total Knee System, so the author sees Stryker as the company's most likely buyer.""Stryker could market both pre-navigated (Conformis) hips for surgery centers and hospitals and Mako hips for those facilities that have a machine,"" he wrote.However, he said he wouldn't rule out the possibility of another large orthopedic company pursuing Conformis' total hip system only."
"bunco, Management did not buy stock on January 7 ….. 1,035,301shares were given to Davis, Weiner and Augusti at no cost as an incentive/compensation.bunco, check the SEC Form 4s covering the transaction and you will see it was not a purchase, it was a gift!"
Market digesting earners here we go
Cathie wood did all the research for us she bought $1.6 million
"buy now, great earning and $15 tmrw with great news"
Was anyone able to find out more about XM medical. How many employees? Sales? Products? I hope they are for real players!
They had some interesting insights about CFMS on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Up 64% in just six months and moving stronger now this stock is just getting started.
Reverse pickup for 10X return longterm :)
something’s cooking
Slowly I turn. :-)
"I think this is great result , 0.5% revision rate for Conformis Vs 1.9% for the off shelf implants , this very significant. I believe the PS will perform even better . https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/03/07/1417532/0/en/Four-Year-Data-from-the-UK-National-Joint-Registry-Highlights-High-Survivorship-in-Patients-Treated-with-the-Conformis-iTotal-CR.html"
nice move today
"just follow Cathy Wood guys, look at her HOOD investment"
"Earnings are very good. ConforMIS (NASDAQ:CFMS): Q2 GAAP EPS of $0.21 beats by $0.18. Revenue of $56.3M (+189.2% Y/Y) beats by $23.3M. Resistance at $2.00, maximum $4.83. Although, it did have a nice run from 1.00 (July) to 1.77 (August), +77-percent."
Massive dump today. Never ending amount.
I had bilateral CFMS knee replacement 12 months ago. After 5 weeks I was back on the tennis court beginning my road back. Great product. The stock is up another 5% pre-market.
Maybe Atena finally starts to accept CFMS? It's about time for a decision in Sep. No reason for this jump other than that.
"Today 7/22, is the review date for Aetna’s coverage decision. Keep an eye out."
T i am with U! I know they are working with Stryker on some things! Any thoughts about if they might be acquired?
"With Identity Imprint, CFMS now offers an off the shelf knee with patient specific instruments in a “knee in a box” model.So do Zimmer, Stryker, J&J, S&N and Microport and their designs have been proven over years and even decades.They also have thousands of salespeople and make heaps of profit on every knee sold.I’d be interested in who thinks CFMS will win in the market and why?What does the OTS knee say about the custom knees that are/were the big differentiator for CFMS?"
Don’t you think that the results of the offering would be announced? Did it sell? Oversubscribed? Anything?
"Personally, I don’t like the new yahoo format."
$2 is definitely coming
positive energy for today guys   
https://www.beckersspine.com/orthopedic-a-spine-device-a-implant-news/item/49066-aetna-sued-for-policy-switch-excluding-customized-knee-implants.htmlI was unaware of the suit. Interesting...
Many believe this company is an acquisition target. Lots of M&A recently in this space.
Have you ever seen a stock remain above the offering price in a 100% increase in the float? I think there is confidence in the market that ConforMIS will regain some momentum post Covid. Still looking at $2.25 this year!
it's down everyday regardless what the market. what is going on? Cathy Wood buying?
"we are still at one year higher chart,i am losing confidence"
Medic Mike at it again. Always negative on CFMS you must work for the Stryker. I have been watching boards for years never seen someone post so many negative comments for a stock and continue to watch it on a daily basis. If you hate the company why are you always posting comments ? No one ever has done that People ALWAYS look at stocks that they LIKE. No one watches a stock that they hate on a daily basis and continue to post negative comments. It's just NEVER done !!! Common sense folks this guy is a FRAUD
Ridiculous drop
"If I bought 400 shares at $1.11 am I pretty safe? Pretty new to stock trading but feeling good about this stock, just would like some opinions before the close of the market today."
Why are MedicineMike's comments disappearing? Is it because he's speculating on the possibility of an acquisition? Who polices these things?
"I'm just not getting a good vibe on this one... I have a small position, and am very cautious"
No pm pull back! Bullish
BETTER DAYS COMMING
"Based on revenue, this stock will triple once hospitals open the gate and elective surgeries get back on track. There is a huge Covid backlog of patients needing Total Knee and Total Hip Replacements."
Added more today last of the 30s
"It has been a good summer for CFMS. June 23 - XR Medical agrees to distribute CFMS products in Asia-Pacific (this has huge potential)Jul 8 - CFMS wins Patent settlementAug 18 - first procedure with new Identity Imprint KneeAug 20 - CFMS reaches 2nd milestone in Stryker dealWe will see how much impact these have long term, but all positive."
GREAT VALUATION BABY BOOMERS WILL BE GETTING MORE HIP REPLACEMENTS.

"Sold KPTI and bought some CFMS. Average target is é,33 according to Tipranks.Let's rock."
$2.50 is the goal
ive retired from medical device industries with 45 years working for the largedt companies in the world. cpnformis have a good product but i can tell they do not have production under control. spending is not under control. This company should be at 40 dollars a share easy by now. To many lining their pouch with the cheap options awarded to keep high level people on board. its a a shame. i have helped device company's as this go from 25 mill a year to 1 billion in 10 years. this company has the very potential to explode.
Time to fly they are meeting with big investors this month - money going IN
Cathie Wood is going to attract a lot of investors to this stock. Myself included. I knew nothing about Conformis two days ago but I do now!!!!
"@MedicMike, are you short conformis? I don’t care either way. You seem thoughtful in your analysis. Just trying to gauge your objectivity. Thanks."
why isnt it trading?
"Just spent about an hour reading up on Conformis Inc., and checking out latest YouTube info, Never herd of this company till today, but I’m so tempted to buy shares as from what I’ve learned and as someone who has had a total knee replacement this company sounds like a great investment opportunity that covers both the 3D printing and Medical Device categories. I think at this price point and with what this company has already achieved, this could be a great opportunity for very serious future growth!, If this falls below $.85 cents today I’ll be a shareholder as well!!."
"smart investors are not looking at earnings report tomorrow, of course earnings will not be stellar. most knee replacement surgeries last year were put on hold because of covid. just wait and collect later this year. easy $3 and that's being very conservative. I myself am looking for $5 minimum"
"THE $1.05 OFFERING IN FEB 2021 , ..... QUESTION.... Did those shares have a lock up period ??? if so , when do they become unlocked?? THX Board..."
Just a hunch but Stryker SYK will buy CFMS 1st half 2021. Bull
I have a friend that had an iTotal surgery about 6 months ago. All seemed fine and she travelled to Spain on vacation a week ago. something happened in the knee and she could no longer walk. She just returned to the states and will see her doctor asap. Are there any continuing reports like this?
Bottom line: Upside potential far outweighs any downside risk. Now that earnings are behind us + forward guidance + the fact that ARK just made a $20M investment PRIOR to earnings should speak volumes.
Buying and holding this company is going in the right direction. Sales will continue to rise. Best knee replacement and now they are continuing to expand overseas
Just looked up Cathy Woods PRNT fund and they have added 1 million more shares of CFMS in the past month. Encouraging.
Retail buyers and sellers act on emotion. Institutions accumulate smartly. Somebody has been buying this dip. Company in my opinion is grossly undervalued. I will wait for my price.
Tons of knee replacements coming soon after covid lockdown. This should get CFMS stock going up. Best knee replacement in the market.
"High revenue expectations, if this happens the price will move  nicely"
ARK just bought 13mln shares of this stock
A lot of Institutions bought before pre-market so they believe in earning and fundamentals in CFMS...stay long
The dump may be coming a bit earlier than last time. .10 on a couple million shares isn’t a bad week.
"What’s the employee turnover at Conformist? Conformis must be losing top talent. A new CEO and new VP of Sales spells disaster. No leadership, vision, or changes to the operating model. Stop hiding Conformis Management and start publicly communicating."
tomorrow up 20%
Did anyone watch the presentation today?
WOW. very quick profits and % gain on this cheap purchase.

My doctor said for me to get a Conformis knee and that it is bye far the best knee statistically ￼proven and that I can go online and research and compare it so I did and it is definitely superior but my question is it’s a small orthopedic company so has anyone received a knee implant from this company and if so what’s your opinion thank you￼
Here we go Positive…. Stay Positive and IGNORE Negative Posters
"remember, u have to be proactive and buy in before before it hits $2...u already know BUY IN when people are watching CFMS "

Aetna is certainly taking its time on the 7/22/2021 review of coverage.
"Gross Margin • Total gross profit increased $36.5 million to $47.5 million, or 84% of revenue, in the second quarter of 2021, compared to $11.0 million, or 57% of revenue, in the second quarter of 2020. • The 2,780 basis-point increase in gross margin year-over-year was driven primarily by the increase in royalty and licensing revenue associated with the Stryker development and license agreements and the settlement and license agreement with Stryker, Wright Medical, and Tornier. • Product gross margin of 42% increased by 1,180 basis points as compared to the second quarter of 2020 driven primarily by lower cancelled case inventory expense and lower manufacturing variances as a result of increased production volumes."
Has the Conformis buyout started yet?
Stryker is by far the biggest and best orthopedic company in the world it has a market cap of $97 billion but it sells 8 different size knees￼ and their triathlon knee system￼ It’s 25 years old were now with conformance￼ newest technology and 3-D printed knee me too the exact fit and the patents they have￼ prevents other companies from doing this they already sued a few big companies and one my point being this is the future and this company will have strong growth￼
Looking pretty good. Go pfe dvn cfms dyai. Good luck to ya.
higher baby
$CFMS huge growth and revenue in the last report huge potential coming ahead
We'll end in the green today. Always takes a day or two for the street to digest earnings.
"Perfect timing to load more as the Aetna issue will be resolved in Sep, and hip rollout in 4th quarter."
"My wife is scheduled mid-October for the first total hip replacement with Conformis in the Tampa area. I have investigated the tech thoroughly. Conformis is using the latest and greatest technological advancements along with improving the outcome of the surgery. Seems like a wonderful product: 3-D radiographic image allows doctor to be involved in design parameters of the stem and cup, each aspect uses the latest tech advancements, and custom jigs help doctor to create more predictable outcome. They are introducing the iTotal hip now with a limited release, planning to formally release nationwide early 2019. Should be a needed boost to the stock. Long."
earnings  and major announcement is next week
How can there be zero volume trades? What are they?
$CFMS FDA Approval news. This is HUGE accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/c…Message #pm-ah-news-alerts
Good time to buy in?
"The 3 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Conformis Inc have a median target of 2.00, with a high estimate of 3.00 and a low estimate of 2.00. The median estimate represents a +71.67% increase from the last price of 1.17."
Cfms a lot like sens which exploded higher in the last week! Low market cap! High short interest! Interesting product! Study it ! We may all end up very happy in next year!!!
Negative on positive news?
There is something brewing here. #longonCFMS
"You can view the Wainwright presentation via the news release. Dynamite!! Really professional, informative and exciting! Obviously effecting today’s market action."
Why is stock going down today ?
"We are getting houses. Looks like another victim of buy them rumor, sell them news"
"Conformis (CFMS +2.7%) filed a lawsuit yesterday in a Delaware district court against Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH +1.1%) claiming the latter's personalized systems for knees, shoulders and hips infringe on four of its patents covering patient-specific instrument systems. It seeks cash compensation, including royalties on sales of the related ZBH"
"The earnings were good; best in the company's history. But, they reported that $41-million in revenue was a one-time deal. The price rose into earnings and it became the Wall Street quote ""Buy the rumor, sell the news."""
I just added CFMS today. I looking forward to seeing the price move up over $2.00 in the next couple of months.
Hold add repeat paytience this is destined to only go up
"Conformis EPS will likely be near $0.04 while revenue will be around $33.00 million, according to analysts. Conformis EPS in the same period a year ago totaled $0.03. Sales were $19.47 millionLooks like this new orthopedic company will make it and muscles it’s way in with the big boys I will hold onto this for years￼￼"
"I’m sorry, but how could this company not do extremely well?, this is how the future looks, technology in 3D printing now allows us to create anything anywhere at any time!!, whether it’s a dental implant, a computer chip, a part needed up in space at the space station, or in this case a knee or hip replacement that can now be custom made for any individual, this is still a small company with plenty of growth potential out in front of it. GLTA given that Conformis has been given 510(k) FDA clearance clearly sets this company and its shareholders up for exponential growth, I feel like I’m in the right place at the right time with a company that’s breaking new ground and is extremely well-positioned to serve a piece of the global knee joint reconstruction market that’s projected at over $9 billion with approximately 1 million knee replacements expected to be performed in the United States this year, add to this hip replacement surgeries and we have a clear winner for 2021 and beyond!!"
THE STARS ARE MOVING IN PLACE.
"I wonder what the average time is from the decision to operate and the actual procedure.. Another curiosity is if a diagnostic MRI is suitable for ConforMIS, or is there the need for another one."
Hopefully we break the 52 week high tomorrow￼
"The stock takes a ""breather"" to regain its strength and launch the next stage of its climb. Don't get rattled, allow the price to move downward. Never sell at the first sign of a whipsaw. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/whipsaw.asp"

"Earnings report will jump this to $2.50..This stock has over 87 institutional owners who have waited 5 yrs.for results...the intial IPO was $15 and change....they are expecting results and are finally going to get it..analysts price targets in my view are way off the mark...I think realistically, a price target adjustment is due based on new information and new partnerships in the works.A more realistic price target of $6-$8 per share is where it needs to be."
"Based on the questions and answers during earning call on the Aetna issue, feels like Aetna did it intentionally to slow down CFMS's growth, maybe in collusion with bigger traditional competitors. Finally CFMS becomes a force to be reckoned with."
Rally time
Hope this make the most amount of $$ when a stock goes from hopelessly Fox..d to less Fox..d.
"Why would a patient or surgeon select a ConforMIS knee when they could get a Smith and Nephew Visionaire?I'm looking at this company from two perspectives. My wife needs a knee replacement and I'm an investor in biotech companies.This is my first exposure to medical devices. All my experience (40 years) has been in diagnostics and therapeutics.When I look at the financials of ConforMIS I can only conclude it would take a miracle for this company to be in business a year from now. I don't want my wife to need a replacement part after the company fails.My wife has not yet made up her mind as to doctor and knee. I'll give her the info and she will make the final decision. If she does decide to go with an ConforMIS knee, I'll insist the company provide a surgical grade spare poly as if the knee fails it will probably be a poly problem.I'd appreciate any input."
"Just found this stock on my screener. I do more technical analysis than fundamental, (fundamental research puts me to sleep) Short Float percentage is 1.36, RSI just below 50, and a perfect cup and handle developing on the chart. Going to do a little more digging but technically this is looking great for a swing trade. From a news/catalyst perspective I could see how with the reduction in covid cases and vaccination rates rising people once again will head into elective surgeries. Elderly and boomers are usually the recipients of new body parts. I need to find out if this is covered by medicare. Does anyone know? Also any contrarian viewpoint would be appreciated! I am new to trading but I am currently obsessed with learning everything I can. Cheers!"
"Australia is actually a big market for this product; between the wear and tear on people and the benefits of its health care to pay for the procedures.BILLERICA, Mass., March 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Conformis, Inc. (NASDAQ: CFMS) today announced the clearance of its patient-specific iTotal PS total knee replacement system by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, which is part of the Australian Department of Health, and which authorizes the marketing of medical devices and other healthcare products in Australia."
"Funding secured, great product, market oversold ready for bounce."
should have bought more at $0.55 or $0.60. but got sidetracked onto something else. i have doubledd my.money so far with closing at $0.90 yesterday. i am hearing from sales reps about a partnership with some investment firm with them buying a minor partnership. would hope this raises the price to at least $1.25 or better.
"I still believe ConforMIS needs some demand pull marketing. Ski, running, retirement, general exercise and health magazines would appear to be fertile ground. Doctors read those magazines too, and might see the competitive advantage a personalized product could offer them. How about Dr. Oz or an info video?"
"As a retired orthopedic surgeon, I've known for five years that Conformis' ITotal knee implant products are groundbreaking technologies, but I think this revolutionary technology can be researched on hundreds of topics. Unfortunately, it cannot be used in Korea. As a result, few orthopedic surgeons have operated many cases with conformis products, but nonetheless, positive results have been published in more than 20 academic journals so far. In the recent July-2020 JBJS (Journel of Bone and Joint Surgery https://journals.lww.com/jbjsreviews/Abstract/2020/07000/Patient_Satisfaction,_Functional_Outcomes,_and.7.asp) online edition, the conformis knee implant was positive. I came across the paper, and I was curious about this company again, so I found out. Unfortunately, the company that changed the paradigm did not hesitate to buy stock, hoping that it would not disappear.I don't know about the company's management and stocks, but I believe that if the company raises conformis awareness not only in the United States but also in the world, the company can grow significantly."
"I was at my daughter's v-ball game the other weekend and noticed a gentleman with an orthopedic branded jacket on and started chatting. Eventually got around to asking him about CFMS and he knows them, loves the tech but says they take to much time to turn an order around. 3-4 weeks as opposed to someone getting scheduled in next week for their procedure. He said that is their biggest issue. He thinks the technology is great but DR won't wait that long and neither will the patients if they have a bad knee."
"I have friends in the O.R. and they say this is by far the best product available for knees etc... The problem is that this company has had and will have a difficult time breaking into major hospitals for approved use as they are a smaller company and have less history as opposed to a company like stryker. If they do get a breakthrough and make their way into major hospitals then it is game on. The other possibility is they get bought out by one of the bigger companies. If neither one of these happen then maybe the European market? My point is, there are some paths forward but they are not fool proof. This is an high risk with a POSSIBLE high reward. I personally, am throwing some chips in on this hand as I believe when a company has a good or in this case, a great product, that they are worth investing in. We will see."
Massive sell off at $1.55. Totally baffled.
"I’m a longtime holder of CFMS. Just recently had two hip replacements. Before my last, I asked my surgeon, who does a dozen replacements each week, whether he uses CFMS. He said no, that he is comfortable with what he uses, and then went into a long diatribe about how surgeons that use it don’t do a lot of replacements. He did say it is an interesting and positive technology, but he doesn’t need it. His explanation left a lot to be desired, but he is one of the best around, so I lived with it.I think the salespeople at CFMS need to do a better job in selling the technology to the surgeons, especially in terms of shorter recovery times. If my surgeon likes the tech, someone needs to convince him to use it."
All sells! If it doesn’t close above $1.35.99 will be tested!
I made a video about Conformis ($CFMS)Check it on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHZgzSVIGws
why the rise today? Is Atena going to finally approve CFMS's products and insiders knows it already?
look at AH? is there something big happening?
Lots of volume!

"No brainer - the majority of the potential patients have been or will be vaccinated in the next two months, and ready to get a total knee or total hip replacement. Open the floodgates."
Can someone please explain why it’s a good time to buy?
"Medic Mike, you seem to think you know a lot. You put down the experience of the CFMS design team; but, the design team at Conformis has experience going back to the original modern knee replacement by Insall-Burstein (almost 40 years ago). You are Medic Mike, so I assume you know what the IB Knee is all about. The design team has been developing knees for decades at some of the bigger companies (some you have listed) and has the experience in the neighborhood of 2-3 millions knees. But you are Medic Mike, so you know that. You would know that custom knees are not for everyone for a multitude of reasons (time develop/manufacture the implant, cost, etc) and an Off the shelf implant is more suited for a percentage of the population. It is okay to have more than one type of product in a market this large. This is how you gain market share. But you are Medic Mike, so you should know that. CFMS does not have to ""win"" the market - the market is huge. They just need their slice of the pie and will do just fine. But, keep on making stuff up and bashing people you know nothing about - sadly, some may even believe your lies."
"ANALYSTS will provide new Target, like $7-8 soon plus management will present good news in Aug 11th conference "
does anyone have a gut feeling/instinct on this one over the next 30 days?
"Up, up, and away!"
Possibility that within the next two weeks they will announce another $80 million contract with Stryker to manufacture titanium base plates for the triathlon knee system￼
"Bought this in May for a buck share, I’m up big time now!, a whole $340 lol, I missed the boat for purchasing a second lot of shares , soon as this drops down....... if it drops back down I’ll purchase another $1000 in shares, that’s usually my target amount when investing in these micro caps. I see this eventually reaching a $5.00 target price, a medical device company of this caliber 3D printing knee and hip joints to exacting unique specifications truly demands attention!, GLTA!"
Great balance sheet and poised for growth
Looks like another day of people dumping under $1.55.

Wainwright presentation via the news release link. It's buried on their website so here it is.....https://journey.ct.events/view/906c3fe3-3008-421a-970a-bb8933d0dfb5
"BILLERICA, Mass. , Feb. 18, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Conformis Inc. (NASDAQ:CFMS), a medical technology company that uses its proprietary iFit Image-to-Implant technology platform to develop, manufacture and sell joint replacement implants customized to fit each patient’s unique anatomy, today announced results from a recent study presented at the Knee Society Meeting, entitled “Customized Knee Implants Drive Cost Savings in a Medicare Population”. The abstract was presented by Mary O'Connor , MD, Director of the Center for Musculoskeletal Care at Yale School of Medicine and Yale New Haven Health . The study, which can be found at https://online.boneandjoint.org.uk/doi/abs/10.1302/1358-992X.2018.12.072, reported overall spending on Medicare Fee for Service (FFS) patients was significantly less when treated with Conformis customized individually made (CIM) knee implants vs. standard off-the-shelf ( OTS ) implants. This study, which was conducted by researchers at Baker Tilly Virchow Krause ( Baker Tilly ) and Yale School of Medicine , identified 739 CIM and 228,697 OTS TKA patients using a defined selection criteria. After conducting propensity score matching to ensure both study cohorts had similar baseline demographic, comorbidity profiles, and were from the same geographic regions of the US, a total of 4,434 TKA patients (739 CIM and 3,695 OTS ) were selected for analysis. The analysis showed that overall episode of care expenditures were $1,697 less for CIM patients ($18,585) than for OTS patients ($20,280) (p0.0001) resulting in $0.08 per-member-per-month savings. The study had been accepted for publication and is tentatively expected to be available online in March 2019 .“Previous studies have shown Conformis CIM implants improve numerous clinical outcomes, such as function and alignment, compared to OTS implants. This is the first time the economic impact of utilizing Conformis CIM vs. OTS implants has been analyzed within the Medicare FFS population long-term,” said lead researcher Mary O'Connor , MD, director of the Center for Musculoskeletal Care at Yale School of Medicine and Yale New Haven Health . “The largest reductions in episode spending were associated with Conformis CIM patients who had overall fewer costs associated with the procedure and hospital stay as well as their post-acute care needs.”Costs analyzed include reimbursement for the initial procedure, pre-operative CT scan, and 12-month post-operative healthcare utilization. Savings were driven mainly by a lower average initial procedure cost and lower post-operative spending for inpatient services and skilled nursing facility costs.“Total knee arthroplasty is one of the highest categories of spending in the Medicare fee-for-service program and is projected to exceed three million procedures annually by 2030,” said Mark Augusti , chief executive officer and president of Conformis . “These results are not only significant for providers looking to save money long-term, but also for payers looking for high quality care in episode-of-care and/or in value-based contracting models. Disclosure: Dr. O’Connor conducts research on Conformis implants for which her institution receives research support from Conformis, Inc. Dr. O’Connor does not receive any personal compensation from Conformis, Inc."
Odd to time the offering while the stock is low but it's not debt so this is a good time to get the shelf out of the way.
"1 time royalty from last year aside, revs flat. Share price reflects the situation, not over valued at $2. Stryker sales exec now CFMS head of sales, hips, Aetna, probable buyout. That how the stock market works"
We used to call a day like this “base building “. Weak hands selling into new money. I would believe it bullish.
I saw the ceo on Mad Money a few years ago. Kramer loved it. l checked them out .Bought some at around $4.Horror show since. Bought some more on the way down. Will I ever get even.?(
"“Identity Imprint integrates elements of personalized design with the convenience and flexibility of an off-the-shelf system, which is advantageous for surgeons and patients alike,” said Mark Augusti, President and CEO of Conformis. “We are already an industry leader with delivery model efficiencies and sterilization savings. By adding Imprint, we believe that we have the best portfolio to address changing customer needs and current market dynamics.”The global knee joint reconstruction market is projected at over $9 billion, with approximately 1 million knee replacements expected to be performed in the United States this year."
Let’s go super undervalued
