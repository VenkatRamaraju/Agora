"I am a retired ortho surgeon - did 1000's of replacement. Medicmike's questions are reasonable. He's not flaming CFMS, just asking the kind of questions we all should ask. That being said, I think CFMS offers a great range of hip and knee products. All hips and knees are not equal and a customizable implant with patient specific instrumentation can save time, and time is money. These days, more and more total joints are being done in orthopedist owned outpatient surgery centers. Surgeons are attracting payers with bundled payment plans - they pay a fixed price, and the surgeon and center manage the cost. The profit is the difference between the payment and the cost. If you can do it better, with fewer complications and faster, you can replace more joints in a day and make more money, so a more expensive implant can be cheaper if it saves time. I have spent a lot of time in the past trying to figure out the correct size of an off the shelf implant both in preop planning and in the OR with trial components. CFMS can make it a no brainer so you can move faster and do more procedures in your surgery center with potentially fewer dislocations in hips, and better ligament balance in knees. They also check all boxes in terms of materials and component coatings. If they irritate the big component makers enough by eroding into their market share, they are an acquisition target. For that reason, I honestly own about 100k shares. I don't do joint replacements any more, and I have no affiliation with CFMS. I know some of the design team and they are solid orthopods."
Why are sooo many shares being sold in the pre-market today $1.60 or lower?!? How ridiculous after an amazing earnings report.
Bottom line: Upside potential far outweighs any downside risk. Now that earnings are behind us + forward guidance + the fact that ARK just made a $20M investment PRIOR to earnings should speak volumes.
Here we go Positive…. Stay Positive and IGNORE Negative Posters
8500 shares average under a dollar 
Let’s go super undervalued
"remember, u have to be proactive and buy in before before it hits $2...u already know BUY IN when people are watching CFMS "
"My wife is scheduled mid-October for the first total hip replacement with Conformis in the Tampa area. I have investigated the tech thoroughly. Conformis is using the latest and greatest technological advancements along with improving the outcome of the surgery. Seems like a wonderful product: 3-D radiographic image allows doctor to be involved in design parameters of the stem and cup, each aspect uses the latest tech advancements, and custom jigs help doctor to create more predictable outcome. They are introducing the iTotal hip now with a limited release, planning to formally release nationwide early 2019. Should be a needed boost to the stock. Long."

"BILLERICA, Mass., June 23, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Conformis, Inc. (NASDAQ:CFMS) today announced the execution of an agreement to enter the Asia-Pacific market through an exclusive distribution relationship with XR Medical Group (Hong Kong) Limited (XR Medical).Under the distribution agreement, XR Medical will have exclusive rights for the sale, marketing, and distribution of Conformis’ patient-specific iTotal CR & PS total knee replacement systems, iTotal CR & PS patella devices, and iUni and iDuo partial knee replacement systems. Other products, such as Conformis’ recently approved Identity Imprint knee system and its hip portfolio of products, may be added in the future.XR Medical’s sales team will provide sales and support exclusively to top-tier facilities in Hainan’s Boao Lecheng International Medical Tourism Pilot Zone (Pilot Zone) on behalf of Conformis. The region is a major center of medical tourism for dozens of countries."
I heard about CFMS the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
We used to call a day like this “base building “. Weak hands selling into new money. I would believe it bullish.
"“Identity Imprint integrates elements of personalized design with the convenience and flexibility of an off-the-shelf system, which is advantageous for surgeons and patients alike,” said Mark Augusti, President and CEO of Conformis. “We are already an industry leader with delivery model efficiencies and sterilization savings. By adding Imprint, we believe that we have the best portfolio to address changing customer needs and current market dynamics.”The global knee joint reconstruction market is projected at over $9 billion, with approximately 1 million knee replacements expected to be performed in the United States this year."
No pm pull back! Bullish
Cathie Wood is going to attract a lot of investors to this stock. Myself included. I knew nothing about Conformis two days ago but I do now!!!!
"We are getting houses. Looks like another victim of buy them rumor, sell them news"
"THE $1.05 OFFERING IN FEB 2021 , ..... QUESTION.... Did those shares have a lock up period ??? if so , when do they become unlocked?? THX Board..."
Ridiculous drop
nice move today
"I still believe ConforMIS needs some demand pull marketing. Ski, running, retirement, general exercise and health magazines would appear to be fertile ground. Doctors read those magazines too, and might see the competitive advantage a personalized product could offer them. How about Dr. Oz or an info video?"
Looks like we have a gem hereBased on 2 Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets for ConforMIS in the last 3 months. The average price target is $2.50 with a high forecast of $3.00 and a low forecast of $2.00. The average price target represents a 60.26% change from the last price of $1.56.
Some people has full time job to post negatives.. We need to keep posting positives ... every one should over write negative comments and put positive comments. there are lot many positive people then negative... keep posting positives and keep everyone motivated...
$2 is definitely coming
"You can view the Wainwright presentation via the news release. Dynamite!! Really professional, informative and exciting! Obviously effecting today’s market action."
"I’m a longtime holder of CFMS. Just recently had two hip replacements. Before my last, I asked my surgeon, who does a dozen replacements each week, whether he uses CFMS. He said no, that he is comfortable with what he uses, and then went into a long diatribe about how surgeons that use it don’t do a lot of replacements. He did say it is an interesting and positive technology, but he doesn’t need it. His explanation left a lot to be desired, but he is one of the best around, so I lived with it.I think the salespeople at CFMS need to do a better job in selling the technology to the surgeons, especially in terms of shorter recovery times. If my surgeon likes the tech, someone needs to convince him to use it."
No brainer hold add repeat .Accumulating
"Conformis EPS will likely be near $0.04 while revenue will be around $33.00 million, according to analysts. Conformis EPS in the same period a year ago totaled $0.03. Sales were $19.47 millionLooks like this new orthopedic company will make it and muscles it’s way in with the big boys I will hold onto this for years￼￼"
"It looks like it is temporary manipulation. I guess, it will be pulled up again soon"
Did anyone watch the presentation today?
Massive dump today. Never ending amount.
Home Run! We are headed NORTH!
Negative on positive news?
"The SEC Filing does not specify an offer date, price or number of shares. Also, along with the press release on the offering, CFMS announced preliminary 4th qrt and y/e results. 4th qrt revs up 4% sequentially from 3rd qrt 2020. Not bad given the covid panic. Gross margins also up a bit. Maybe offering will be priced and offered after the official earning report release. 1st qrt 2021 guidance a bit on the down side."
"GlobeNewsWire:BILLERICA, Mass., Aug. 18, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Conformis, Inc. (NASDAQ:CFMS) today announced the first procedure with the new Conformis Identity Imprint knee replacement system.Is it a big news? I think the spike after hours might be related to this news"
T i am with U! I know they are working with Stryker on some things! Any thoughts about if they might be acquired?
I am buying the dips today.
There is something brewing here. #longonCFMS
ConforMIS (CFMS) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.
Market digesting earners here we go
What's your target price? When do you think it will reach?
is there a conference coming up or a shareholder meeting next week?
In for 5k shares let’s go
Rally time
tomorrow up 20%
"I SAID BE PROACTIVE AND BUY IMMEDIATELY, new HIGH target comes out and u wish u had bought, 2.15 intraday"
"More big volume!!! Lets GO, baby needs new shoes!!!!"
"Make of it what you will. We’ve been here several times in recent years. Huge volume, price run up, then crickets while we revisit.75-.80. I sure hope there is some good news coming. Aetna is set to review coverage again, and of course earnings are coming soon. GLTA"
It shoot up above 1.8 in the morning. This is being played right now
"I’m sorry, but how could this company not do extremely well?, this is how the future looks, technology in 3D printing now allows us to create anything anywhere at any time!!, whether it’s a dental implant, a computer chip, a part needed up in space at the space station, or in this case a knee or hip replacement that can now be custom made for any individual, this is still a small company with plenty of growth potential out in front of it. GLTA given that Conformis has been given 510(k) FDA clearance clearly sets this company and its shareholders up for exponential growth, I feel like I’m in the right place at the right time with a company that’s breaking new ground and is extremely well-positioned to serve a piece of the global knee joint reconstruction market that’s projected at over $9 billion with approximately 1 million knee replacements expected to be performed in the United States this year, add to this hip replacement surgeries and we have a clear winner for 2021 and beyond!!"
Slowly I turn. :-)
Hold add repeat paytience this is destined to only go up
"Over the last 52-week period, shares of Conformis are up 112.13%."
"Wow, over 13 million shares traded, & almost 700k at the close??"
Medic Mike at it again. Always negative on CFMS you must work for the Stryker. I have been watching boards for years never seen someone post so many negative comments for a stock and continue to watch it on a daily basis. If you hate the company why are you always posting comments ? No one ever has done that People ALWAYS look at stocks that they LIKE. No one watches a stock that they hate on a daily basis and continue to post negative comments. It's just NEVER done !!! Common sense folks this guy is a FRAUD And I guarantee he is NO MEDIC
doubled my position. carry on.
hope we jump into the green Monday. good luck longs
Added more today last of the 30s
$2.50 is the goal

"Australia is actually a big market for this product; between the wear and tear on people and the benefits of its health care to pay for the procedures.BILLERICA, Mass., March 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Conformis, Inc.

Buying at a discount thank you!
"ANALYSTS will provide new Target, like $7-8 soon plus management will present good news in Aug 11th conference "
The company should conduct a 1-for-10 reverse stock split to get the price up to a level where more investors would look at it.
Aetna is certainly taking its time on the 7/22/2021 review of coverage.
"Conformis Achieves 100,000 Implant Milestone for Patient-Specific Knee Replacement Technology"
The dump may be coming a bit earlier than last time. .10 on a couple million shares isn’t a bad week.
E b o n. All week long....YouTube search box. New bitmain mini crypto mining boxesThe magnificent one
MedicMike just might be right. This stock might just be a dog
"Anyone been noticing how this stock has been trading in the last few months? There are days it will quickly pop up, and then get seated down shortly after. Then we see huge after hours spikes, and then knocked down again. This stock is being acquired by someone. And, they are slicing out a nice size position. This is how stocks trade before they blow."
Ignore medicmike he’s short here and scared sh*tless because they smoked earnings. Product revenue was not too impressive but the company expects a significantly better Q3 in that regard. Should see some buying tomorrow PM!! Good luck everyone
Institutions bought another $33MM in CFMS stock in Q2. I am staying long. The price should be much higher.

Looks like everyone is too scared to hold into earnings. The short term chart turned totally bearish with all the sellers today. I can't believe people were buying it at 1.90 this morning. Anyways good luck to longs.
cheer up
Great balance sheet and poised for growth
higher baby
does anyone have a gut feeling/instinct on this one over the next 30 days?

their Asia sales should come in this quarter and I am expecting huge results from them...
I had bilateral CFMS knee replacement 12 months ago. After 5 weeks I was back on the tennis court beginning my road back. Great product. The stock is up another 5% pre-market.
"There are the big guys out there like SYK, ZBH, MDT that use fixed sizes. If your knee is 3.05"" wide where they fit you with a 3"" implant. so you have bone overlapping the implant or maybe implant overlapping the bone. Less comfy, chance of irritation, infection, less mobility. It's time for custom implants. These guys are the pioneers. Just launched their custom hip late last year after years of waiting. First half of 2021 should see the knee they co-developed with SYK approved by the FDA. Why would a 92 billion market cap company team up with CFMS? Because this is the future of orthopedics! With the new knee, new hip, and elective surgeries accelerating this should trade at the group (SYK, ZBH, MDT) multiple of 6-7x revenues. With 180m fully diluted shares out that's $3.33 to $3.88 without accounting for the over $100m cash on the BS. The larger guys are growing at 3-7% and CFMS about to start growing at multiples of that with new products and finally having the money from recent deal to attack the reopening opportunity"
"In the 2Q earnings release in August, it may be too early for the impact of that cash inflow to drive revenues. But I am looking forward to an indication of business momentum in the discussion. $100 million in cash can fund a nice sales and marketing initiative of the new products."
"just follow Cathy Wood guys, look at her HOOD investment"
"As a physician and recipient of bilateral Stryker knee replacements 10 years ago I wish I could have had a prosthesis that was designed specifically to my anatomic contour as Conformis does today, not the best fit that you can find off the shelf for a person my size. I have done well with my prosthesis, but if I had to do it over again I would go with Conformis. That is why I invested in the company."
Buying and holding this company is going in the right direction. Sales will continue to rise. Best knee replacement and now they are continuing to expand overseas
"No brainer - the majority of the potential patients have been or will be vaccinated in the next two months, and ready to get a total knee or total hip replacement. Open the floodgates."
We'll end in the green today. Always takes a day or two for the street to digest earnings.

look at AH? is there something big happening?
"Back in 2015, conformis' innovative products were at a disadvantage in many ways. CT scan is not necessary for existing products of large artificial joint companies. However, for Conformis personalized arthroplasty, CT scans are a must (MRI is not required), and it would have been more expensive than the prices of ready-made artificial joints from large companies (SYK, Zimmer..). Therefore, insurance companies (because of lack of evidence claiming excellence) did not accept conformis products. And there was a problem of having to wait 8 weeks for the product to be made and operated. In recent years, the development of IT and manufacturing has been shortened to 3 weeks, and the reduction in surgery time and hospitalization period is a patient-friendly product. In a recent peer review article, it has been proven that the surgical results are more satisfactory and cost-effective compared to conventional large-sized artificial joint products. And the new ASC product has received FDA approval. Currently, this product is not distributed in the Far East, but we look forward to using it in Korea soon."
I have a friend that had an iTotal surgery about 6 months ago. All seemed fine and she travelled to Spain on vacation a week ago. something happened in the knee and she could no longer walk. She just returned to the states and will see her doctor asap. Are there any continuing reports like this?
"The earnings were good; best in the company's history. But, they reported that $41-million in revenue was a one-time deal. The price rose into earnings and it became the Wall Street quote ""Buy the rumor, sell the news."""

"Thank you ARK! Other institutions have to be eyeing this and once this goes up to $5, more institutions will probably buy. I can’t believe this is still under 2! What a gift!"
Maybe Atena finally starts to accept CFMS? It's about time for a decision in Sep. No reason for this jump other than that.
Up 64% in just six months and moving stronger now this stock is just getting started.
Cathie wood did all the research for us she bought $1.6 million
after hours means nothing

something’s cooking
"As a retired orthopedic surgeon, I've known for five years that Conformis' ITotal knee implant products are groundbreaking technologies, but I think this revolutionary technology can be researched on hundreds of topics. Unfortunately, it cannot be used in Korea. As a result, few orthopedic surgeons have operated many cases with conformis products, but nonetheless, positive results have been published in more than 20 academic journals so far. In the recent July-2020 JBJS (Journel of Bone and Joint Surgery https://journals.lww.com/jbjsreviews/Abstract/2020/07000/Patient_Satisfaction,_Functional_Outcomes,_and.7.asp) online edition, the conformis knee implant was positive. I came across the paper, and I was curious about this company again, so I found out. Unfortunately, the company that changed the paradigm did not hesitate to buy stock, hoping that it would not disappear.I don't know about the company's management and stocks, but I believe that if the company raises conformis awareness not only in the United States but also in the world, the company can grow significantly."
"Medic Mike, you seem to think you know a lot. You put down the experience of the CFMS design team; but, the design team at Conformis has experience going back to the original modern knee replacement by Insall-Burstein (almost 40 years ago). You are Medic Mike, so I assume you know what the IB Knee is all about. The design team has been developing knees for decades at some of the bigger companies (some you have listed) and has the experience in the neighborhood of 2-3 millions knees. But you are Medic Mike, so you know that. You would know that custom knees are not for everyone for a multitude of reasons (time develop/manufacture the implant, cost, etc) and an Off the shelf implant is more suited for a percentage of the population. It is okay to have more than one type of product in a market this large. This is how you gain market share. But you are Medic Mike, so you should know that. CFMS does not have to ""win"" the market - the market is huge. They just need their slice of the pie and will do just fine. But, keep on making stuff up and bashing people you know nothing about - sadly, some may even believe your lies."
positive energy for today guys   
Why is stock going down today ?
HOLD... This is not the time to exit...We have crossed 52 week high and will keep breaking records...
"It has been a good summer for CFMS. June 23 - XR Medical agrees to distribute CFMS products in Asia-Pacific (this has huge potential)Jul 8 - CFMS wins Patent settlementAug 18 - first procedure with new Identity Imprint KneeAug 20 - CFMS reaches 2nd milestone in Stryker dealWe will see how much impact these have long term, but all positive."
CFMS BUY AND HOLD going up.
Possibility that within the next two weeks they will announce another $80 million contract with Stryker to manufacture titanium base plates for the triathlon knee system￼
"Gross Margin • Total gross profit increased $36.5 million to $47.5 million, or 84% of revenue, in the second quarter of 2021, compared to $11.0 million, or 57% of revenue, in the second quarter of 2020. • The 2,780 basis-point increase in gross margin year-over-year was driven primarily by the increase in royalty and licensing revenue associated with the Stryker development and license agreements and the settlement and license agreement with Stryker, Wright Medical, and Tornier. • Product gross margin of 42% increased by 1,180 basis points as compared to the second quarter of 2020 driven primarily by lower cancelled case inventory expense and lower manufacturing variances as a result of increased production volumes."
"I have friends in the O.R. and they say this is by far the best product available for knees etc... The problem is that this company has had and will have a difficult time breaking into major hospitals for approved use as they are a smaller company and have less history as opposed to a company like stryker. If they do get a breakthrough and make their way into major hospitals then it is game on. The other possibility is they get bought out by one of the bigger companies. If neither one of these happen then maybe the European market? My point is, there are some paths forward but they are not fool proof. This is an high risk with a POSSIBLE high reward. I personally, am throwing some chips in on this hand as I believe when a company has a good or in this case, a great product, that they are worth investing in. We will see."
"Up, up, and away!"
Showed up on my rising stars screen.. had to have it.. as virus numbers go down and beds open up in hospitals we can get back to pre-virus numbers for elective surgeries.. here we go nah... hehe THE MAX
"great earnings in 90 mins, buy NOW"
Time to fly they are meeting with big investors this month - money going IN
Has the Conformis buyout started yet?
Looking pretty good. Go pfe dvn cfms dyai. Good luck to ya.
Looks like another day of people dumping under $1.55.
Look at that jump - 2$ next
Reverse pickup for 10X return longterm :)
"I had posted a current NYTs story that points out that robot assisted surgery is not any better than non-assisted surgery, as it relates to complications. If that is true for MAKO, et al, it strengthens the ConforMIS story."
All sells! If it doesn’t close above $1.35.99 will be tested!
A preview of Conformis earnings The analyst consensus estimate would represent a 233.33% increase in the company's EPS figure. Revenue would be up 69.51% on a year-over-year basis. The company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this: This should put it over Two Dollars
Going to $2.25 soon
Massive sell off at $1.55. Totally baffled.
Point and figure chart still looking for $2.25.
Stryker is getting everything on the cheap! Buy the company why don’t you!
BETTER DAYS COMMING
"@MedicMike, are you short conformis? I don’t care either way. You seem thoughtful in your analysis. Just trying to gauge your objectivity. Thanks."
WOW. very quick profits and % gain on this cheap purchase.
All good news coming out of CFMS. $2.25 around the corner
Daily chart set up looks good for next leg up. Loading more Monday
it's down everyday regardless what the market. what is going on? Cathy Wood buying?
Where's Medic Mike with his words of wisdom now. Gone in the wind
Was anyone able to find out more about XM medical. How many employees? Sales? Products? I hope they are for real players!
I had faith into CFMS.
"This has got to be the worst management team ( I use that term loosely). Mark was a joke as the sales manager so he was promoted to the CEO position where he has excelled in driving the company in the ground. They just don't get it ... until something is sold everything else is e relevant. Just venting, have been around since the beginning and have never sold a share hoping they would get it together but that seems impossible..."
I guess we made our 30 days above $1. Does that preserve our listing?
The PRINT ARK fund has 3% of its total investment in cfms! Over 12 million shares ! A large position ! I am excited! GLTL!
Has Cathy Wood bought any more? With such a low market cap has anyone seen any articles on possible acquisition by one of the bigger players?
How can there be zero volume trades? What are they?
"we are still at one year higher chart,i am losing confidence"
"Personally, I don’t like the new yahoo format."
Just looked up Cathy Woods PRNT fund and they have added 1 million more shares of CFMS in the past month. Encouraging.
"Conformis (CFMS +2.7%) filed a lawsuit yesterday in a Delaware district court against Zimmer Biomet Holdings (ZBH +1.1%) claiming the latter's personalized systems for knees, shoulders and hips infringe on four of its patents covering patient-specific instrument systems. It seeks cash compensation, including royalties on sales of the related ZBH"
"Earnings are very good. ConforMIS (NASDAQ:CFMS): Q2 GAAP EPS of $0.21 beats by $0.18. Revenue of $56.3M (+189.2% Y/Y) beats by $23.3M. Resistance at $2.00, maximum $4.83. Although, it did have a nice run from 1.00 (July) to 1.77 (August), +77-percent."
earnings  and major announcement is next week
"A nice vote of confidence by Innovatus...""In addition, Innovatus purchased $3 million of the Company’s common stock from the Company at the previous day’s closing price."""
"With Identity Imprint, CFMS now offers an off the shelf knee with patient specific instruments in a “knee in a box” model.So do Zimmer, Stryker, J&J, S&N and Microport and their designs have been proven over years and even decades.They also have thousands of salespeople and make heaps of profit on every knee sold.I’d be interested in who thinks CFMS will win in the market and why?What does the OTS knee say about the custom knees that are/were the big differentiator for CFMS?"
Hopefully we break the 52 week high tomorrow￼
Can someone explain the why the market reacting this way to good earnings. I blame the Cathy pump.
Lots of volume!
"Congratulations on all good week. I sold half at 1.47, as I saw volume falling off. No regrets. I still think 2.25 is possible, but the old pump and dump scheme has caught me too often."
"look at the Active NASDAQ right now, CFMS has great VOLUME = high price later when market opens"

We made the CNBC crawl!
"High revenue expectations, if this happens the price will move  nicely"
