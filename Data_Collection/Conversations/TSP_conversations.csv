Volume was so so low.
This is about to pop. When it does its gonna happen fast up to around 48.50-49 within next day or 2...
"Hi folks, I am window shopping and very interested but scared as well. I'm afraid China will force TSP to hand over its data, and as a result the US will delist this company and support an ""American"" company in this field. What can you say to reassure me? Thanks!"
Can someone explain why this stock is down every day ? There is never eve r a bounce ? Cathie Wood believes in TSP and buys millions of shares weekly but no one cares ? When i own a stock that Cathie Wood sells it falls hard.
"MS recommends it in a report ""..secular growth stocks .."" with a price target of $ 75. On the other hand Cathie woods also bought it. It is at its minimum values. I'm going to buy now before I go up and regret it."
Why is this up 13%
Holding very strong….expect gap up to 50’s over next 25 days
TSP is down 5.13% to 37.95
"Only stock down today and getting crushed After Hours, Thanks Cathie Wood!"
Bought more!
WOW!!!!
"Fundamental: As one of the only pure-play, non-hardware, publicly traded autonomous companies and the leader in autonomous trucking, we expect TSP to benefit from secular growth within the space as driverless truckingcontinues to ramp up and move towards commercialization. TSP was the first company to focus only on autonomous Class 8 trucks for freight, it has a strong track record of hitting its milestones, was the first company to go public, and it has more patents filed 10 than their start-up competitors combined. Further, it has been the only company to demonstrate their trucks on surface streets and at 75 mph; the vehicles can drive in day and night and in rain and wind, and they have the most road miles on their fleet of ~80trucks globally. By targeting a TAM that can be conservatively sized at $800 bn US (~90% of the domestic freight transportation spend) and $4 tn globally today, we think TSP has a long runway to grow and do so profitably. We also like that the competitive set is relatively small as we believe TuSimple's competitive set does not include every player engaged in autonomous technology, but rather only those focused on its target markeLevel-4 Autonomous commercial vehicles (~6 credible competitors, in ouropinion). We see TSP at the head of this group poised to benefit the most from thesecular changes beginning to take place in the trucking world as carriers look to digitizetheir freight, benefitting from the cost savings and higher utilization autonomous truckshave to offer as well as potential industry consolidation. The company has a clear andsomewhat binary catalyst ahead of it in the ""Driver Out"" test, but if it is successfullycleared, we believe the event path to commercial launch in 2024 would be straight forward and the value proposition of the product is clear."
This stock will soar in AH and tomorrow
They r still buying and will be for sometime. Dow days of course but long term 26+ bagger imho
Good vibes here !!
"I see a surge at the close , possibly $52-$53. Needs to break $50 and there is no stopping until $79"
very interesting company. will have to see the financials. hope this is not like Nikola or GOEV
35 starting to buy.
why would anyway look at this when tesla already ahead of the game
Those 8/20- $30 puts looking good
its over valued compare to other EV stock. $8B market cap with miniscule revenue.

I have no skin in this company but afraid to invest because ALL Chinese related stocks getting hammered.
"Yay!! we hit $50 !!! What a ride up from the bottom. My new favorite stock! Congrats longs, Go TSP!!!"
Wow. Look at that support.
Quick snap back to 50 on deck
What's driving today's pop?

I talked smack I deserve the pullback. Not selling one share
Buy Rush a San Antonio Co. With a solid US footprint of service locations across the country and an affiliate in Canada.Even when an autonomous truck breaks down…or worse….they will likely need a Rush body shop/ service center to get them back together and on the road ASAP.
in at $34.... what a ride today!
Hold your shares!!!!!’
No earnings of course. Much easier to run a stock up when you have no idea where to value it.
Who submits papers if cops pull over?
"This company keeps adding patents which is really smart adding another 100+ patents since last quarter report, they focus on debugging IT issue and very particular who they partner with this company looks a lot more promising when Tesla started, they have a cash balance sitting around of 1.5b and still have a float of 104m still stable sitting at 7B market cap even after the last quarter. Once they debug IT issue and go on 100% production this can actually spike unexpectedly."
"Buying some more, MS price target $75..."
Somebody brought up a good point on 60 Minutes that wasn't addressed by the company: how does a computer follow hand signals from a police officer waving traffic around an accident?
counting my profits
MD and I and a few others are feeling vindicated. Hold those shares this puppy is pre rev

Ares Motors is going to officially announce the merger with ZGYH soon. Hopefully its valuation will be much less
Look who bought hundreds of thousands of shares of TSP today! Cathie Wood buys for Arkk and Arkq today. Cathie knows !GO TSP!
TSP down 2 weeks in a row then up 2 weeks in a tow then down two weeks . Someone here said TSP is a roller coaster ride and they were right
Here's the Grizzly Report for anyone wondering why its down big today: https://grizzlyreports.com/Research/TSP.pdf

"Stock is down a lot...but sure what investors were expecting for this quarter. There wasn't any surprising news, really."
"why not just buy tesla , no thanks i'll pass"
would not want to short this stock as it could explode to the upside really fast
I’m gonna short this…totally absurd PPS and market cap
This is so nice soon all the momo money will be here
multiple days or weeks up trend - will break 80 this time
I'm rolling my double bagger profits into Embark Trucks that announced just last week their merger with NGAB. Its still trading at the SPAC issue price but without the warrant. I guess the NGAB IPO investors are taking their capital invested and keeping the free warrants...
A lot of loading up by someone other than Cathy today
Volume very low today. Nobody selling
"$HCIC merging with PLUS valued at 3.3B compared to $TSP valued at $8.45B, why tusimple so expensive or why Plus so cheap? tusimple is going straight to driverless by 2024, Plus currently driver assisted then adding driverless by 2024. $TSP is over 8 x 2024 revenue multiple compared to $HCIC ~0.7x 2024 revenue multiple. Am I missing something? Why would anybody buy $TSP over $HCIC?"
it will fly and hit $100 in no time. this is the real deal!
"Guess who bought more TSP today ? Yep , Cathie Wood . Now when will TSP stop falling ?"
"Amazing , Cathie Wood bought more than 900,000 shares today while less than 2.7 m shares were traded. Cathie bought about a third of every share traded today ."
https://discord.gg/VZMEwDq
I keep selling more as it keeps rising. I'll run out of shares soon.
missed low today - would have bought some more...
Hi folks I would love to hear your opinions on how TSP compares to Aurora.
"TuSimple's IPO lock-up period will end at the opening of trading on August 17, 2021"
"Scam company. There is a graveyard full of these types of companies. Autonomous vechiles/trucking. Software can be hacked causing carnage on the highways. These companies are just another conduit for transfer of wealth from retail investors to the crooks on wall st. , Bloomberg news article now pumping this garbage, time will prove my point."
Going back to $70 next week.
TuSimple is up 11.25% to 39.67
YAY! Up today! GO TSP!!!
"Buying today, lucky to get in sub 50."
"Yes - let's spend billions to build our EV infrastructure. But, why overlook the low hanging fruit which can make our planet safer - banning crypto.A single bitcoin has a carbon footprint of 270 tons, the equivalent of 60 ICE cars.$SPY $TSLA $RIDE $NIO $FSR $TSP"
Volume so high every day
"Here’s the bad news , TSP will go down hard with the market today. Ugly day all around. Here’s the good news - Cathy Wood will see the buying opportunity and buy more shares and hopefully push price up by end of day"
"Just because Kathy Wood invested some money into this stock doesn't mean you should. One of Kathy's Funds invested a lot of money in WKHS a few months ago. WKHS has plummeted ever since that purchase, so be careful. Good luck."
60 minutes didn't help? Thought it might get a bump. Anyone see it?
very sustainable 1 yr price action
Oh god Cathie Wood just bought in. Kiss of death lol
The high volume almost everyday. Accumulation going on.
Cathie Wood was buying over 500K shares Friday from sellers who don't have patience. Also note she dumped some TSLA this week
I am very happy with the price action and high volumes everyday
I am curious about the company. Can someone explain to me though how and by how much they are able to provide cost savings to shippers before it becomes legal for the trucks to drive on highways without a driver? Has anyone dug up research on the status of the state laws and political sentiment expressed by politicians for laws to allow them to drive without safety drivers on highways in the US southern corridor they are starting in?
"Cathie woods bought 295,000 shares on Aug 12 and ARK now holds over a million shares of TSP."

"Up 11.5% with low low volume, Wow! no news."
Oct 12/21 is next TSP lock up expiry
The future is bright!

What's causing this breakout move?
"Be patient folks. TSP not having a good day. Think long term,"
I just don't think that they are going to allow autopilot for trucks in my lifetime. very sexy but not what i want driving next to me on the road. seriously.
"Mortimer, we're back!!! Congrats long, we held through the past few weeks and things are looking good here. Cathie knows"
Any indication that we will move up from here?
I can't think of anything more horrifying than a semi truck with out a driver........what could possibly go wrong ?
Oh no
Never buy on an IPO rookies!!!!
There is simply no more volume. Accumulation complete?
Tomorrow another 24% gain
TSP needed to take a breather. Great run up from the bottom. Should break $50 this week. Cathie knows
finally a non meme stock with high profits
"If you were late getting into TSP, you should look at NGAB who are acquiring Embark...a TSP competitor. I won't try to figure out which technology and business model is better (if either), but the valuation of NGAB is one third what TSP is. If you think TSP is correctly valued by the market, that means NGAB/Embark should triple in price. NGAB is also a SPAC so you are guaranteed to be able to get out at $10 (current trading price) if you change your mind."

I am pretty sure that we are possibly going to maybe $100+ no less for certain.

"Tesla has far superior technology, and is already using battery power. It’s a no brainer to buy Tesla over tsp"
Is Cathie still holding all her shares?
"Cathie bought another 300k shares today; she really loves this thing. May also want to look at AEYE, they are working with TSP on some of the hardware functionality"
Did you guys load up on vechain (vet-usd) like I have been telling you? We doing wonders out here next stop 20 cents. Hop in and tell your friends. Unsure what they do look it up. We heading to the moon.
"To the best of my knowledge there is no state or province that allows a truck to drive intercity without a driver behind the wheel. It might be several years before before the law is changed and drivers are no longer required, hence, at the moment, there is no great incentive for a trucking company to fork out thousands of dollars for driver assist. A search for 'self driving' will produce a list of companies which have logged many millions of miles of autonomous driving. Meaning that there will be a lot of competition when drivers become redundant."
CORE (being acquired by PFGC) just partnered with these guys. We’ll see.
sell the junk and run.
Up like almost 70 % and I’ve only been here a few weeks. Wait til 2024
big green day today. feel like I'm the only one here excited about my gains
Will TSP ever go up ? Cathie Wood buying millions of shares and the stock drops hard every day
"Monday TSP busted through $40 and was surging, 48 hours later at $35 and heading back to the $20s"
Wow. 7.5B? Scratching my head at the valuations some of these start up companies are getting.
"I have done some research, they are an active company already a few contracts in current operations, UPS, AND A FEW OTHERS, this is a great option for fixed route carriers, it does however take away those jobs, but the trucking industry been crying about a driver shortage for years, I drove OTR for over 15years, can't say I miss it."
3x volume lot of loading. Which way it will blow. Yo no se
Did I miss some news on TuSimple. Anybody have any insight while it is falling so much?
$32 target
"I like the concept from a cost savings perspective, but I can't get past the risk of truck accidents causing lawsuits and regulation banning the tech. Can you imagine a driverless 747? AI makes mistakes. Also not sure how they will deal with the teamsters. Driver assisted doesn't make sense to me if there is no cost savings. Not an issue for the traders, but would love to hear input from longs."
"volume was 6.8M shares on the open board, from an average of 1.5M. And up nicely on a market down day... I think the tide has turned."
This stock is asinine. I’m a buyer in the low teens!
Cathie Wood buys over 300k shares on Monday.
"Finally, PT 20 inbound"
Does anyone know how much was sold after the lockup and by whom?
This will roar!!
Tesla’s auto pilot is about to get recalled. These recalls are the next step forward in advancements for the whole autonomous driving sector. Sometime it takes a kick in the pants for companies to address problems with their designs. It’s also a sign that automatic vehicles are being noticed on a larger scale.
fake stock by insiders
Recent initial research pub is huge for public proof of concept. Their mix of tech for AI is a massive advantage over competition
In the buy list of Cathie's ARK Investment. ~750K shares added.https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=18287551&gfv=1

"With all the non-binding reservations still up in the air with no production or deliveries in sight and with new competition hitting the market, I'll wait till earnings and pick this up wicked cheep"
"Again, it’s the high volume that sticks out"
TuSimple is up 12.10% to 43.76
"I pointed out the high volume past few weeks, rewarded today. This one should go to moon. All that infrastructure gonna need trucks to deliver materials however no truck drivers."
"Just read their earnings report. Will listen to the Q&As later. But as for a growth company, it wasn't bad nor was it GREAT. I think overall it was a solid quarter for TSP.-They increased their revenue by 5x and 57% from q1 to q2. (Good)-Opened a hub in Dallas (Good)-Spent a #$%$ load on hiring/operating expense (Good)-Adjusted EBITDA -66M (ouch but for growth it was OK)-Has over 1.5B in cash (Good)-Guidance for YOY rev 2021 (5M-7M) (Good if they can hit this!)The company is definitely overvalued based on it's figures but again its a high risk/high reward growth company. If you believe in autonomous driving, I think this is a good stock to consider while the entry will be quite low. Keep in mind there is an IPO lockup expiring in a few weeks. In my opinion, I like to risk reward. Autonomous driving is still fairly new and at its infancy stage. Will it replace truckers across N.America? Prob not, but it will be a good alternative for businesses to consider 20-30 years down the road."
I will be so happy to buy this below 10.....wait and see 
could the Aug 17th IPO lock up expiry have anything to do with this recent drop?
Cathie Wood loaded up more shares on Friday
healthy little profit taking. At the end of the day the price goes up.

Shorts are piling on?
Any reason for the bump today? I didn't see any news.
800 billion freight transportation industry and growing . 70% of goods and services via truck. This demand is growing . Worldwide the industry is 5 trillion and growing. As demand grows there is a shortage of truck drivers and this problem is also worldwide. Driverless trucks are here it’s not a conceptual idea. It’s a major disruption in a trillion dollar industry . TuSimple is at forefront and has the leading edge superior technology and software . They already have hubs in operation with thousands of these hubs planed worldwide .
TuSimple is down 11.56% to 44.22
Elon Musk should be trying to court the brainchild behind TSP’s technology.
