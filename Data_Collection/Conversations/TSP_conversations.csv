Tesla’s auto pilot is about to get recalled. These recalls are the next step forward in advancements for the whole autonomous driving sector. Sometime it takes a kick in the pants for companies to address problems with their designs. It’s also a sign that automatic vehicles are being noticed on a larger scale.
"Buying today, lucky to get in sub 50."
"Mortimer, we're back!!! Congrats long, we held through the past few weeks and things are looking good here. Cathie knows"
MD and I and a few others are feeling vindicated. Hold those shares this puppy is pre rev
"Monday TSP busted through $40 and was surging, 48 hours later at $35 and heading back to the $20s"
Somebody brought up a good point on 60 Minutes that wasn't addressed by the company: how does a computer follow hand signals from a police officer waving traffic around an accident?
35 starting to buy.
why would anyway look at this when tesla already ahead of the game
I just don't think that they are going to allow autopilot for trucks in my lifetime. very sexy but not what i want driving next to me on the road. seriously.
Any reason for the bump today? I didn't see any news.
would not want to short this stock as it could explode to the upside really fast
60 minutes didn't help? Thought it might get a bump. Anyone see it?
TSP needed to take a breather. Great run up from the bottom. Should break $50 this week. Cathie knows
Oct 12/21 is next TSP lock up expiry
"I like the concept from a cost savings perspective, but I can't get past the risk of truck accidents causing lawsuits and regulation banning the tech. Can you imagine a driverless 747? AI makes mistakes. Also not sure how they will deal with the teamsters. Driver assisted doesn't make sense to me if there is no cost savings. Not an issue for the traders, but would love to hear input from longs."
"is there going to be 50 again, there are too many call option on 45-50"
"With all the non-binding reservations still up in the air with no production or deliveries in sight and with new competition hitting the market, I'll wait till earnings and pick this up wicked cheep"
multiple days or weeks up trend - will break 80 this time
The future is bright!
What's driving today's pop?
Recent initial research pub is huge for public proof of concept. Their mix of tech for AI is a massive advantage over competition
Look who bought hundreds of thousands of shares of TSP today! Cathie Wood buys for Arkk and Arkq today. Cathie knows !GO TSP!
Tomorrow another 24% gain
Does anyone know how much was sold after the lockup and by whom?
Quick snap back to 50 on deck
TuSimple is down 11.56% to 44.22
Elon Musk should be trying to court the brainchild behind TSP’s technology.
"Buying some more, MS price target $75..."
"Be patient folks. TSP not having a good day. Think long term,"
"$HCIC merging with PLUS valued at 3.3B compared to $TSP valued at $8.45B, why tusimple so expensive or why Plus so cheap? tusimple is going straight to driverless by 2024, Plus currently driver assisted then adding driverless by 2024. $TSP is over 8 x 2024 revenue multiple compared to $HCIC ~0.7x 2024 revenue multiple. Am I missing something? Why would anybody buy $TSP over $HCIC?"
Holding very strong….expect gap up to 50’s over next 25 days
"Cathie woods bought 295,000 shares on Aug 12 and ARK now holds over a million shares of TSP."
missed low today - would have bought some more...
TuSimple is up 11.25% to 39.67
Only buyers today?
"I see a surge at the close , possibly $52-$53. Needs to break $50 and there is no stopping until $79"
