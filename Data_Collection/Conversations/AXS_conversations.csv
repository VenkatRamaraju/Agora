"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and a lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is right now out so it out rightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait, maybe incur some losses along the line. That's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stock up more coins thereby making profit should be the way of life. That being said the market is still a bit busy at the moment and I'll currently advise investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr Steve program an establishment that handles those people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns. With their program I went from having 1.4 BTC to 9 BTC in just 9 weeks. Steve can be reached on t elegram (Steveewilson)"
