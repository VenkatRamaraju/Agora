Tomorrow we see how powerful important ESIO is to future growth of MKSI. Big Revenues for a midcap. Value to be unlocked. Vast patents treasure here.
Any news on the earnings?
MKSI is down 5.48% to 95.26
Hopefully 110 tomorrow
Good time to add. Tech and semi space is getting killed right now. Demand is still there.
Gets worse every day.....probably solid at around $65
"What's the deal with this stock? Record revenue report, yet the stock fell 4%?! Just last week it was $165+"
I am surprised of why this stock is low and they don’t let it to go up.
Nailed it :)

great pullback to buy
"Mks makes instrumentation for semiconductor mfg, esi a circuit bd mfg, spectra physics a laser mfg, optics and coatings mfg. good company well run, the coherent offer was a great move would combine some good technologies. Lasr is another company to watch"
Still a great entry on this reversal.
Great CC. ESI not in current guidance. Bullish!

"This baby may hit $90 soon if it delivers another big surprise, which it could because most companies that delivered a surprising upside usually did it more than once."

"#$%$? The problem with small stocks is that there is no news to explain what's going on. Of course there is something going on, but only insiders know what it is."
This stock ripe for takeover
Being held down by the shorts and mm. Every rise is shot down. Have to wait until next week.
MKS Instruments is up 4.91% to 186.32
"50% of MKSI's business if from the semiconductor segment. Too much concentration is being exposed to the downturn in that space. Result, MKSI takes a dive."
Why does this just keep going down?
Bought in at $162 last week - should i sell or continue to hold?
The reversal off the bottom in?

"Earnings tonight, I expect to beat the estimates and GAP UP tomorrow to $80's...Why selling so cheap today? Look at the earnings report history...always beats the consensus...."
Wild overreaction to the downside. Over not much.
"nice volume today at this level. MKSI been acting better them LCRX of late, so its just not ETF buying strength."

seems like 40% analysts price targets upside starts to play out.
MKS Instruments is down 5.26% to 108.17
I don't understand the reasons... at all. This company is nearly a monopolist in one of their segments (at least they provide subsystems for equipment for LAM and Applied Materials which control 80% of market in material deposition / cleaning). And at the same time this company trades at lower ratios to their revenue and earnings. And citi is neutral?! They don't like purchase of Atotech? But atotech has reported a good guidance just recently with growth in both their segments. But the most ironic thing is that Citi is very bullish on LAM and AMAT (which account for like 30% of revenue for MKS) - both have price targets from citi higher than average from other firms...
The downward pressure continues on even on a very good days. What in the world is going with this company!
MKSI is down 6.08% to 94.20
"Ok, I give up, why the quick retracement today?"
"""Business levels remain strong and excluding the headwinds we are seeing with supply constraints, we would have expected revenue in the third quarter to grow sequentially."" So they are working at full capacity atm."
"with MKSI good earnings repor last week, announcing an increase in dividend, a large upshot in price yesterday. does anyone have a good opinion as to why its down over 5% today"
Bet on management's track record.Grossly under followed.luck
MKSI says they will see a tax windfall and they are also raising their future earnings guidance by 33%. What's not to like?
"Wow, crazy quiet board. I’m selling my position in the morning after the news about the sell off by insiders and hedge fund managers."
This stock proves my dog LuLu could do the job of market analyst much better than most. Is somebody paying these guys? Get out of what is left of this pig ASAP !!!!!!!
Added at $161.50 today
"Glad to see it go up so high so quickly but I'm afraid it was too quick, I'm pulling out and taking my 15% gain in the past month!"
Not looking good for MKSI. Semi sales sinking and expensive ESI acquisition hanging on its neck. Less than $50 soon.
MKSI is in free fall this month. No recent articles pointing toward this performance. Will hold until I can figure out what is happening.
MKS Instruments is down 5.61% to 116.81
Expected more from earnings.... though next Q's guidance was impressive. Anxious to listen CC.
Shorts are foolish not to cover Before markets ends . Will run up quick when she runs back up
There is not as much overlap in mks and coherent business as lumentum suggests. And The combination of mks and coherent overlap that does occur would make usa products more competitive to the new european suppliers. Imo
"MKS Instruments Reports Second Quarter 2021 Financial Results- Record revenue of $750 million, up 38% year-over-year- Record Non-GAAP net earnings of $168 million, up 88% year-over-year, and GAAP net income of $147 million, up 99% year-over-year- Record operating cash flow of $165 million, up 19% year-over-year, and record free cash flow of $149 million, up 26% year-over-year"

"Well let me be the hater then douglas, know you got lucky with MKS buying ESIO for a ridiculous premium, still amazed that their board approved that buyout, I think ESIO was at their 52 week low when the buyout was announced, so in the end MKS paid a 100% premium for a company that obviously people had serious concerns about. When a stock is trading at single digit P/E in a sector which has most of its components in the 16-22 range and its high flier (NOVT) is at nearly 65, then there must be something else there. I think MKS is a great company and thought fairly highly of them, though not invested until the purchase of ESIO. I think they end up finding less than great things about the laser company they just bought."

What a collapse in stock price. It is just unbelievable when market is almost at all high.
Atotech (company which they are buying) reported very positive results today. 40% growth YoY. Became profitable. Raised full year guidance second time.
I hope this well deserved bump lasts
Lasr is the laser company for hp fiber. Look for a suitor for lasr. Big high power diodes fiber coupled ! 1000’s of watts

58% of revenue is semi and Amat is 13% and lmrc is 13%. Surprised it didn’t drop b4. Should be a 5 to 7x fwd pe due to semi exposure. 7x times $7 makes it 49. Even if you segment the revenue it’s not 90.

"Took my time to listen today's conference from citi (with exactly the same analyst, who recently gave 160$ target). She sounded a bit more shallow regarding company details than deutsche bank's analyst, though, perhaps I am biased in that regard now. Anyways what I have highlighted for myself today is that the company is going to benefit from the trend in semis of advanced interconnects and chiplets (unifying multiple chips into one package to improve interconnect between elements). This is a really topical direction of development among leading semiconductor companies, for instance take HMB memory in videocards or read about new 3D processor structure pipeline by AMD and so on - all comes cause moore's low is slowing down (no working plans now below 5nm and it is getting more expensive to go lower) and companies look for other means of improving performance - by advanced pqackaging. MKSI will contribute to this trend by Atotech purchase and recent ESI purchase."

"My due diligence exam of the statistical fundamentals of this company very clearly shows a healthy, profitable, low debt, well run company. So we bought this yesterday at a great price for our retirement Roth account. Only 100 shares, but this looks to be a great investment.

There will be a answer from COHR by Friday. If the answer is no this goes back up quicker than a blue pill in a 20 year old man. If they get to buy it goes up period.
Didn't they just have a great earnings report?
I've made a bunch with MKSI in past years. This is the first time I've been in the red. Maybe I should buy more...I just don't know how much longer this crazy bull run will go.
ESI numbers still not in the stock. Moving up with the other big semi equipment stock. The trading prior days indicated a powerful up day a coming? Going to new highs. How and when?

"I know MKSI got to the $115-$125 range during the summer because semis were also doing well...that plus the fact that this company is extremely sound financially. Looking at their main overall business, there will always be a strong demand for their services well into the future. This is a short term blip that just created an incredible bargain."
MKSI is up 8.35% to 76.80
big up move here today...and on higher volume. Is Mr Market finally catching or? Or something else afoot?
This stock absolutely sucks
Nice pin action AH. Should hold up tomorrow. Beat on both top and bottom ends.

"uhh this is for sure an overreaction here. Right now company is evaluated the same as it was in 2017 and 2018 if you compare all ratios - but now it is buying another company, which will increase revenue 50% and there is a boom in building semis fabs."
#$%$ !!! Down $8 in after hours.... Cut next quarter forecast by 1/3 in earnings and 1/4 for revenues....big trouble...

So happy with this company! Long term it will 4x!
Pay no attention to today's price action. Volume is pathetic. It will pick up again next week with earnings coming on Tuesday!!

"I’m still of the belief that the new phase of growth is about to be revealed. New generation of smart phones help, but more then that. Buy pullbacks."
"Actually, during Conference Call CEO kind of opened cards why the guidance is like that: Equipment and Solutions Division's revenue, which is the smallest segment and now accounts for 100m$ will be 50m$ next quarter. It is normal, perhaps, a big contract was simply completed.Considering we have been growing by about 50m$ every quarter, if we subtract them this time but everything else will grow still - we get exactly the same quarter numbers and that's what is guided.So given other segments are still growing but stock price sort of corrected recently to account for a possible slow down - it is a buy again. + merger is coming end of the year, which should add 4-5B$ to market cap here."
"Forward PE of under 9, PEG of just .73, Price to Book of only 2.49, Profit & Operating Margins of 18% and 24%, Return on Equity of 23%, Total Debt/Equity a very low 19.68, Current Ratio a healthy 5.03. Even pays a 1% dividend. Continued growth, a very good recent quarter of record quarterly revenue growth and Non-Gaap Net Earnings and obviously a very healthy company that provides much needed analytical services worldwide. Bottom line: I don't know who the fools are who are selling, but this is now at an absolute bargain price!"
Back over 80. How soon back over 100?
RAISED GUIDANCE FOR REVS AND EPS SIGNIFICANTLY111
"MKSI is paying a hefty premium for ESIO. At the $1 billion purchase price including debt, that's more than 3x sales and 10x EBITDA. The price is very similar to what they paid for NEWP, but NEWP had twice the sales and more cost savings opportunities. More importantly, NEWP diversified MKSI away from just semi while ESIO primarily has semi customers (in fact MKSI was one of their top customers). So less sales, less diversification, and less chance to improve margins for a slightly higher purchase price. We'll see in future years if this was a goods idea. I'm not a buyer at this PPS. I think this semi cycle is on its last legs and maybe a better entry point is available in the future."
"Now is the time to add more. This China thing will pass, and MKSI will come through this period with more business and and market share."
And away we go!
"no buy for a few days, wow this stock took alot of beating today,, and me 2 :( almost lost 10% on this #$%$"
"Bought 1000 at 94.6, sold covered calls for $8.70, made $8k++ Great trade that is low risk"
"Hello, got a position here today. Pre-pandemic price was 115 - now 159, why it has grown so little given growth of revenue across literally all segments? Also I had a position in Atotech since IPO but got rid of it after understanding that there are debt problems, anyways, that company has some unique offerings - I think a good purchase and will reduce debt burden for them, thus, better profitability for Atotech's business."
"Results for this quarter are really great - 100% growth from previous year, though there was only 60% growth in stock price. Guidance is conservative though."

Just now...MKS Instruments (MKSI) resumed with a Neutral at Citigroup; tgt $160My opinion...this already oversold....
"Put an order in for 1500 shares if MKSI breached 89.00 ... just filled at 88.95 ..... move below $90 is way overdone and MKSI will return to the mid-$93/94 range this week. Only a 5% down-draft post-release is warranted.... I believe it will continue to recover throughout the day as the ""panic"" subsides .... over merely a shift in business activity in MKSI's forecast from3rd to 4th Quarter .... merely a seasonality realignment in their forecast ..... market is seeing the Q3 estimate change as an ""absolute"" modification of business activity .... Again, we see it as a recalibration of seasonality with no full-year impact."

MKSI took big hits this week in the market. Trump tariffs are to blame as the stock is a global provider and could be a victim of retaliation by China and other countries. It is too soon to tell if this will happen. I am holding on and know Q1 results will be good. Trump is now too much of a wild card for this market to be sound. Hold onto your hat.
"MKSI has a strong run up in the last 12 months, yet it still slightly undervalue. Its FY17 earning has been raised to $4.90, giving its PE of 16. But based on Q1 results and management forecast, I think its earning could reach closed to $6, giving it a PE of 13, with a small dividend yield. Not bad."

"My math is saying that Lumentum would need to increase its offer to $143 per share in cash and 1.59 Lumentum shares for each Coherent share, in order to increase its offer to $7 billion for Coherent. That is a 50/50 cash and stock split.If someone asked me to take a punt on what Lumentum will do next, I'd say, it is likely they will up their bid, if necessary, to around $7 billion. It may not be on a 50/50 split basis, but some combination thereof.Much of the value argument (below) applies in equal measure to Lumentum and it is why I think Lumentum is unlikely to drop this one. Further, Lumentum has 1 Billion in cash whereas MSKI and II-VI are running with substantial debt. Attempting to outbid an increased offer from Lumentum will put further stress on the balance sheets of MKSI and II-VI to the point where both will end up just burning the benefit.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4406455-ii-vi-dives-into-battle-for-coherent-and-diversification#comments"

I went in on Tuesday for 600 shares at $78.85. I'm hoping for a nice pop close to $90 after earnings are released next week!
Why this stock has been going down...? because of China issue or something else?
I’m buying more with the recent pullback. Tech spending will continue to increase and this one is too cheap here. Easy 20% to be gain by the end of Q3.
Will get back to $120 in short order. No reason for the stock to be down after a great earnings report.
News today is a down grade due to competition in lasers. Is mksi affected significantly by competition ? Is cohr significantly affected by competition ? I would think the cohr ( excimer ? )big OLED laser has little competition ?
So..this is a good entry point right?
