Bought in at $162 last week - should i sell or continue to hold?
"Some seem to expect ""peak earnings"" - I don't see any overcapacity deep into next year - this is a bargain ;)"
"Bought 1000 at 94.6, sold covered calls for $8.70, made $8k++ Great trade that is low risk"
Hopefully 110 tomorrow
Just now...MKS Instruments (MKSI) resumed with a Neutral at Citigroup; tgt $160My opinion...this already oversold....
10/29/212021 : JAGNote by Rosenblattmksi: Initiated - The firm started coverage of the shares with a Buy ratingand price target of $255. MKS Instruments closed at $145.74
"MKS - not a lot of WS coverage ( which is a good thing) and based on the earnings, company is quietly (again good ) executing their business plan with precision.I’d watch this company..."
"There is a breakdown of revenues by segment in file ""Revenue by Division and Market"" for this quarter already. All 3 segments recorded absolute revenue records this time and the stock is pretty much beaten down yet last 3 months. I think analysts will retain high price targets."
Some Dec 145 call buyers today.
This stock ripe for takeover
One single word describes this stock: Dead.
"Took my time to listen today's conference from citi (with exactly the same analyst, who recently gave 160$ target). She sounded a bit more shallow regarding company details than deutsche bank's analyst, though, perhaps I am biased in that regard now. Anyways what I have highlighted for myself today is that the company is going to benefit from the trend in semis of advanced interconnects and chiplets (unifying multiple chips into one package to improve interconnect between elements). This is a really topical direction of development among leading semiconductor companies, for instance take HMB memory in videocards or read about new 3D processor structure pipeline by AMD and so on - all comes cause moore's low is slowing down (no working plans now below 5nm and it is getting more expensive to go lower) and companies look for other means of improving performance - by advanced pqackaging. MKSI will contribute to this trend by Atotech purchase and recent ESI purchase."
Will get back to $120 in short order. No reason for the stock to be down after a great earnings report.
"this company is very cheap fundamentally now, while it grows in line with bigger peers. It is profitable, can't be hurt by high energy prices, demand for its products isn't susceptible to any consumer demand shifts or inflation, rising bond yields won't hurt its valuation as its multiples are relatively low... It had all good aspects for tapering environment in my opinion but it only falls..."
"Note, that before pandemic this company was 115$, there was only 30% growth since then at current prices. Is it adequate considering how much revenue has grown? It will be 50% at least this year compared to 2019. Earnings this year will be like 5x compared to 2019..."
"I have watched all investor master classes from $AMAT. I do really recommend them to get a feeling of what trends are shaping up in WFE market. What I understood is that variability of equipment and steps to produce modern chips is increasing. There are new types of processes, which are getting traction like epitaxy, ion implantation, selective etching etc. All these processes are about adding or removing materials to wafers in vacuum. $MKSI is a company, whose main clients are $LRCX and $AMAT and they provide them with subsystems that are used to deliver or remove that material in vacuum. If $LRCX and $AMAT will be growing so will $MKSI's business. But I prefer this company as investment because it is simply cheaper right now and at 1.5-2 times better multiples."
"Dear management, keep doing your thing!"
Buy all the dips and hold Back to the $120's
Atotech (company which they are buying) reported very positive results today. 40% growth YoY. Became profitable. Raised full year guidance second time.
13% growth in semiconductor segment this quarter is actually very good compared to peers. Guess they are gaining market share there again.
The downward pressure continues on even on a very good days. What in the world is going with this company!
"MKS Instruments Reports Second Quarter 2021 Financial Results- Record revenue of $750 million, up 38% year-over-year- Record Non-GAAP net earnings of $168 million, up 88% year-over-year, and GAAP net income of $147 million, up 99% year-over-year- Record operating cash flow of $165 million, up 19% year-over-year, and record free cash flow of $149 million, up 26% year-over-year"
"Put an order in for 1500 shares if MKSI breached 89.00 ... just filled at 88.95 ..... move below $90 is way overdone and MKSI will return to the mid-$93/94 range this week. Only a 5% down-draft post-release is warranted.... I believe it will continue to recover throughout the day as the ""panic"" subsides .... over merely a shift in business activity in MKSI's forecast from3rd to 4th Quarter .... merely a seasonality realignment in their forecast ..... market is seeing the Q3 estimate change as an ""absolute"" modification of business activity .... Again, we see it as a recalibration of seasonality with no full-year impact."
Forward pe now 11 somewhat similar to cohr and lite. I found it interesting that cohr went up while lite and mksi fell. Barring nothing new negative I think it just assumed a more realistic pe and peg. I will Buy below 100.
Couldn’t resist the after hours sale going on. Small cap growth stock with a value stock evaluation. No brainer.
If I understood CFO correctly he has already confirmed that they are up in Q3 already on revenue sequentially. So it is 750m$+ rev.
"A step in the right direction... unfortunately I thought (and kinda still do) that anything under 170$ was a bargain. Better the right stock at the wrong price, than the wrong stock at any price. Nothing time won't fix.luck"
I don't understand the reasons... at all. This company is nearly a monopolist in one of their segments (at least they provide subsystems for equipment for LAM and Applied Materials which control 80% of market in material deposition / cleaning). And at the same time this company trades at lower ratios to their revenue and earnings. And citi is neutral?! They don't like purchase of Atotech? But atotech has reported a good guidance just recently with growth in both their segments. But the most ironic thing is that Citi is very bullish on LAM and AMAT (which account for like 30% of revenue for MKS) - both have price targets from citi higher than average from other firms...
Why is this company in a free fall? I am really surprised of the beatings it gets for a while now!
MKSI says they will see a tax windfall and they are also raising their future earnings guidance by 33%. What's not to like?
"uhh this is for sure an overreaction here. Right now company is evaluated the same as it was in 2017 and 2018 if you compare all ratios - but now it is buying another company, which will increase revenue 50% and there is a boom in building semis fabs."
3 times price to sales and a 14 and change pe for a very profitable company Cheap! Bought some today!
I like lower prices. Please drop below $120
Good buying opportunity. Earnings should be good. imo
"What's the deal with this stock? Record revenue report, yet the stock fell 4%?! Just last week it was $165+"
"MKSI is paying a hefty premium for ESIO. At the $1 billion purchase price including debt, that's more than 3x sales and 10x EBITDA. The price is very similar to what they paid for NEWP, but NEWP had twice the sales and more cost savings opportunities. More importantly, NEWP diversified MKSI away from just semi while ESIO primarily has semi customers (in fact MKSI was one of their top customers). So less sales, less diversification, and less chance to improve margins for a slightly higher purchase price. We'll see in future years if this was a goods idea. I'm not a buyer at this PPS. I think this semi cycle is on its last legs and maybe a better entry point is available in the future."
"ZTE, concession by U.S.A. therefore QCOM and NXP Semiconductors may get a go ahead with the merger thus creating a lot of competition for MKSI."
$200 year end.
Tomorrow we see how powerful important ESIO is to future growth of MKSI. Big Revenues for a midcap. Value to be unlocked. Vast patents treasure here.
MKSI is a long term hold. See you in 6 months / August at 220.
