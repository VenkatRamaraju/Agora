"So last year's revenue was 1.8B and this year's was 1.89B, why are shares up 50% from last year? What am I missing?"
Guys Oshkosh $OSK in trouble premarket -5% down. Something is smoking.
Almost feel sorry for WKHS longs.Almost.
Tommorrow...all eyes on US FEDERAL economy announcements...Possibly many at EVs and techs stocks might get smack down mild or harsh Drop..and OSK might be effected to this ordeal too..NO MATTER WHAT!!! ..BEST IS STAY ON LONG AND STRONG and Don't Panic in selling off..Remember...OSK is still respected in Scholar of USPS contract..
"I imagine we lost so many Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Oshkosh Armored Vehicles, and/or Joint Light Tactical Vehicles in A-Stan, to the Taliban, one would hope that the Army would extend the contracts to re-supply our Troops."
I read in original proposal osk didn’t include electric mail carrier. That obviously changed. Are they using own technology or partnered with someone?
OSK investigated by the SEC!OSK investigated by the DOJ!Going to court over a contract they never should have received in the first place!GEE whats that all about???IF IT SMELLS LIKE ROTTEN FISH IT IS ROTTEN FISH!
Good company to short. Osk continues to fall. Wait till Sept 15 when wkhs continues Lawsuit. And osk is under sec investigation.
Buying the dip.Dividend helps!
"Microvast will be the biggest winner from USPS contract, all the battery packs to be provided by MVST.#RMO#QS#DCRC"
"“Today, we celebrate Oshkosh Defense – a world-class company – and their decision to establish manufacturing operations in South Carolina. It speaks volumes of our business environment when a company of this caliber invests $155 million and creates more than 1,000 jobs in our state. Congratulations to this great company, and we look forward to all the things they will do.” -Gov. Henry McMaster"
"Mon, February 1, 2021, 7:25 AM·1 min readFeb 1 (Reuters) - Electric-vehicle battery maker Microvast said on Monday it would go public through a merger with blank-check company Tuscan Holdings Corp, in a deal that values the combined entity at roughly $3 billion.The deal with Tuscan was announced in November. However, the financial details were not disclosed then.Microvast will receive $822 million in gross cash proceeds, which includes a private investment of $540 million from investors like Oshkosh Corp, BlackRock Inc, Koch Strategic Platforms and InterPrivate Investment Partners."
"Just a couple items on this OSK contract with USPS. First in Nov of 2020 while submitting bids for a last mile next generation vehicles for USPS in an interview with the CEO he admitted they had no expertise or resources to produce an EV.So no expertise or resources and your submitting bids for something you have no knowledge of.There is one company who submitted bids and already has a product on the road. Plus it has millions of test miles behind it. Oshkosh is being contracted to build an EV that they arent building ANY of the working parts for it. Why is that??When asked to build 75% of the USPS fleet as EV and you cant do it then why do you have the contract? Oshkosh received over 400 million to develop an EV. Why give OSK 400 million when someone has 1 already developed and ready to go?I wonder how much a company could ramp up if they were given over 400 million and already had a working product. OSK isnt suppose to have 1 EV ready for delivery till the end of next year.Someone already has one and can deliver now. OSK is going to deliver 90% gas powered vehicles. With UP TO 10% being retro fitted as an EV.Thats right up to!! So reading the fine print that could mean 1% of them. A gasoline powered fleet is in the long run much more expensive than an EV because of maintenance and gas.Why would USPS choose something more expensive when they admit money is an issue? All of the biggest fleets in the US other than USPS are going EV.Amazon, UPS, DHL, FED EX etc but not USPS because why???? The government mandate for the submitting of bids was for USPS to be 75% EV.Is up to 10% equal to 75%? Would you trust a company who bought a Ford Transit van slapped a different body on it and said that was their prototype? That was Oshkosh's prototype. Why because they dont have one. The judge has until Aug 3rd to make a decision. Its quite obvious where the trust and reliability issues are."
I wish they would release more information on vehicle. And testing results.
OSK settlement news with WKHS going to hit market very soon. And when it does WKHS shooting to $50 in a blink of an eye while OSK will ta me 30%
I heard talibans are driving oshkosh vehicles in Afghanistan which is why the stock is crashing.
"another great quarter, so the stock will drop 10% today.."
"I see people playing in the pre-market, two orders of five shares each at a small discount to close then two orders of 100 at substantially greater discounts and then a 90 order for a 8.70 drop from close. So three hundred shares ""traded""."
"USPS - how great would that be !!! However, I fear the market may expect electric ! Thoughts?"
"Oshkosh could lose the USPS contract (they 100% won't) and I would still say the stock is a great buy at $125. These WKHS people think OSK is on the same level as them. I'm glad Oshkosh won the USPS contract, but I'm an investor because I feel like the military, emergency response, and infrastructure in America will soon make the push to go green. Oshkosh is currently in the best position to make that a reality, and I will be here in the long term to see it happen. These workhorse people won't be around a year from now. Short, mid, and long-term, I'm really bullish about Oshkosh."
down 4% in after hours
"Even with the NGDV contract, I Feel like they are not getting the recognition that they should. They are mass producing a specialty EV (even Elon says most companies cannot upscale: look at how workhorse and lordstown are struggling.) The NGDV is a minimum 10 year contract. I assume since it is not and off the shelf product, that Oshkosh will be helping to provide maintenance/parts for the life of the vehicles (also ICE to EV conversions), which I'm sure will be steady income for the next 30 years."
Baird raised the price target from $122 to $140. Lets go guys tmr gonna have more analyst upgrade the ratings!
They know who made that mysterious trade in the dead of night right before the contract award.....!!!
"OSK is a great company. They have been around for over 100 years and their portfolio of products is extensive. They build Pierce fire trucks, Jerr-Dan towing equipment, cement trucks and a host of military vehicles. Check the history on how they took away the contract from Force Protection for the MRAP military vehicle. Contrarians at the time said they couldn't do it for the cost or the delivery schedule. They were early on the due dates and made a lot of money. They are teamed with Ford for the EV part of the contract. Workhorse has never made money.....only a political tree hugger hack... You lost..move on."

"The USPS contract is to replace both the LLV's (Long Life Vehicle) and the FFV's (Flex Fuel Vehicle) that the USPS uses. The LLV's handle the shorter urban/suburban routes while the FFV's typically handle the longer rural routes.The two foreign proposals were for gas/electric hybrids, they were looking to replace both the LLV and the FFV with one NGDV. If the USPS went that route, besides NOT ""putting America first"", they would not get the best replacement for either, both the LLV and FFV replacement would be a compromise.That is why from the beginning I've figured the contract would be split between $WKHS and $Osk. The $WKHS NGDV would be perfect for the urban/suburban routes and the Osk and it's diesel engine would be better for the rural routes.BUT.... the more I think about it the USPS long rural routes would be a perfect scenario for drone deliveries. And we all know that for the next 20 years $WKHS has a patent on drone delivery from a vehicle. So, maybe the USPS will order even more NGDV's from WKHS, OR maybe WKHS will license their drone delivery technology to Osk?"

"This is very comical. Don't you think the horse would be flying high if there was any merit to the protest? I love the old points being brought up that have been disproven over and over again. It is a short squeeze no the contract is being halted, no they have drone capability, Oshkosh is only making 10% EV's. The list goes on and on. At least they try different approaches for pumping, which I give them credit."
Osk crashing after hours after oral arguement lawsuit for sept 15th against workhorse. Osk may lose the USPS contract.

"Hey guys , do you think Oshkosh can get the usps contract and why??"
Workhorse withdrew the protest. OSK can focus on building trucks now. Bought some more
Soon back to the 80's....!!!
Please head over to Workhorse WKHS boardand offer them encouragement as their company faces an SEC probe over faked orders.
Why such dropped and still dropping ?
ouch... wonder if people are selling in anticipation of the USPS contract review/DeJoy corruption
How about postal vehicle contract?

You think they secured a NGDV facility? Im sure there will be a lot of questions on earnings next week.
"So so we are clear.I never said OSK would lose the entire contract.I said its possible they will lose some or all of it.POSSIBLE is your operative word.Learn what the court documents and depositions mean.According to documents on Court Listener the case was dismissed without prejudice.A court case dismissed with prejudice the case is closed and its final.A court case dismissed without prejudice is temporary.This means that unless the plaintiff (Workhorse) and USPS/OSK can come to a settlement agreement it is within WKHSs power to re-open the case, add additional claims and go to court.Settlement implys some lose or concession on the part of USPS/OSK.As for lawsuits to the people involved in the impropriety that is yet to be seen."
"WASHINGTON — A group of U.S. House Democrats on Monday are introducing legislation Monday that would award $6 billion to the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to buy tens of thousands of additional electric delivery vehicles.The bill sponsored by Representative Jared Huffman would require at least 75% of the new fleet be electric or zero emission vehicles. Last month, USPS said it was committed to having electric vehicles make up 10% of its next-generation fleet as part of its multibillion-dollar plan to retire its 30-year-old delivery vehicles, but could boost that if it received billions in government assistance. (Reporting by David Shepardson)"

If the contract gets delayed, the price'll take a hit, but if it gets awarded to OSK, it'll go right back up. The only issue is if the contract gets awarded to some other company."

"Oshkosh needs to do some PR work with certain Democrats trying to play politics with the awarding of the USPS contract. All Oshkosh needs to do is say that if the USPS wants 100% EVs instead of 10%, Oshkosh can deliver them. There is no need to re-open or stop the contract. Oshkosh can deliver any type of vehicle USPS wants."

Wah wah waaah
QUESTION - I've followed OSK for several years and got out with a profit in the high $80's. I can't figure out what is supporting it's continued increases other than the USPS speculation. The recent track record of all divisions other than military seem concerning to me for the near term..... what am I missing?
I think there is some more writing on the wall as far as WKHS goes. The suit was dropped without prejudice which means it can be reopened by WKHS at any time. You may find these two companies working together in the future.
"osk mkt cap - $7B, last Q rev - $1.58B, earnings - $1.13/shrwkhs mkt cap. as nearly $6B with just the speculation of the usps contract with zero revenue.it is simply math that osk should worth around $190 to $200 with this contract ($6B) added to the mkt cap. furthermore, it's analysts' target price was already in the $120's before this $6B contract.Math is very clear that this will be in the $200's."
"God willing after this week, I will never hear the word workhorse ever again."
"I have held OSK for years and didn’t really expect such a reaction from the USPS contract, but pleased of course. Apparently people bought Workhorse based on unrealistic expectations and are now losing and mad. It’s called investment."
"Its becoming obvious USPS was not qualified to run contract competition and should have hired outside professionals to monitor the process and evaluation of information provided by each of the bidders.Workhorse argues that Oshkosh improperly lobbied the House of Representatives, the White House, the USPS, and the Postal Regulatory Commission during the bidding process, as did Ford. Workhorse says this is in direct violation of the NDA that the USPS made competitors sign as well as the ground rules for the bidding process. However Oshkosh wasn’t punished, while the USPS hammered Workhorse for making public statements about its prospects. In contrast to its complete disinterest in the Oshkosh team’s NGDV lobbying campaign aimed at every entity involved in the award decision and funding of the procurement, in violation of the NDA and the Ground Rules, the USPS castigated Workhorse for making innocuous and good-faith public statements confirming its participationThe double standard on display here is as troubling as it is obvious."
"so if the court is dismissed, what is happening?"
"Hmmmm people deleted their comments saying the contract would be reversed. I am glad we do not have to hear the same #$%$ over and over. Sorry Frank, willi, David, a or whatever you keep changing your name to, sps, and Wai. Thank you for the great entertainment!"
"OK, who bought $54.2 million worth of OSK stock the NIGHT BEFORE the announcement of the contract. Come clean. The SEC is on it."

"OSK latest earning - $1.5+B revenue, $1.10 earning per share, mkt cap $7B Stock price before usps contract $102.So it is only up 10% for this $6B contract. It is way undervalued?"

I wonder does any one remember the bidding process on a government contract called JEDI?The goverment asked for bids from multiple companies on cloud computing software for the Deparrment of Defense.Its pretty recent as a matter of fact the ruling for the case came down in JulyThe JEDI project was a 10 billion dollar project that was initially given to Microsoft.In the end the Penagon canceled the bid because it found there was political interfere with the bidding process and gave the contract to Amazon.I wonder what will happen in the court system to a bidding process on a goverment contract that has both political interfere and fraud?

"Credit for this find goes to Kelli Medeiros (kmarie77 on StockTwits).The main argument the USPS has used as to why they are going with $OSK and 90% ICE vehicles appears to be total BS!The USPS has stated they can not afford the charging infrastructure that would be required for a majority EV fleet. That it would cost the USPS $3B-$4B for charging infrastructure. BUT, WKHS's proposal included an additional proposal from Duke Energy to finance the ENTIRE CHARING INFRSTRUCTURE! It would have cost the USPS NOTHING!The USPS in their response letter to $WKHS's formal disagreement, the USPS said it was inappropriate for WKHS to include any other proposals not required by the RFP. So they claim they were justified in ignoring it! But in the USPS's RFP the USPS claimed that bidders would get credit for including such proposals!Basically $WKHS never had a chance because the USPS adding a $3B-$4B cost to their proposal!"
"let's be real, the Democratics will vote in favor of clean Electric Vehicles, which oshkosh has no experience with. OSK unfortunately will have their contract reduced to 20-30%."

"Microvast is the real deal here, as they will supply OSK with the needed batteries. And we all know the battery is the most expensive part in an EV.

they got a deal for 482 million to tool and gear up for a POSSIBLE contract worth 6 billion over ten years in the end ! ! do not expect this to double or rocket ! it will be a good investment over 5 years consideration that they can deliver on a workable vehicle. biggest worry is the usps may not be in existence in 5 years ! ! its been in a tailspin for the last 15 and has been bailed out to operate several times . . . . . IT COULD HAPPEN ! ! everything carries a risk ! !
"wow , wkhs is below 11.00 . I wonder if they realized that this contract will not be overturned. Without this contract wkhs is toast. Watch the video from Bill it just shows how osk has worked with and delivered trucks to the Armed forces."
Oshkosh missed Q3 earnings and revenue expectations and has been on a downward slide ever since. It's about to drop below its 6 month low and might retest the 52 week low soon....
"I understand there was a suspicious trade made the night before the contract award to osk that the SEC and Congressional Oversight are looking into... if osk is involved, Will anyone from osk go to prison for that illegal trade...?"
Oshkosh isn't going to build a single USPS truck......
I wonder if the same analyst that downgraded wkhs gave osk that unrealistic price target? Especially considering the price target is based on a contract that is getting reversed for being awarded fraudulently.
Fraudulent Company
"The USPS NGDV contract is to replace BOTH the Post Office's LLV(Long Life Vehicles) and the FFV(Flex Fuel Vehicles). The LLV's make up approximately 75% of the PO's fleet and the FFV's make up around 20%. LLV's drive on average 18 miles a day and have 500 stops. FFV's are used in more rural area's so they drive much further, on rougher roads and have fewer stops. Many drivers of the the rural routes currently use their own vehicles, so the contract could award more ""FFV"" replacements than there are current FFV's - I have read that the USPS will be having drivers in rural areas use the new NGDV's and not allowing them to drive their personal vehicles.There are 4 teams that are bidding for the contract, two are headed by foreign companies (Karsan from Turkey and Mahindra from India) they both submitted gas/electric hybrid prototypes. The other two are Workhorse which submitted a battery electric vehicle and Oshkosh which submitted a diesel engine vehicle. Karsan and Mahindra took the route of trying to have one vehicle replace both the LLV and FFV while Workhorse targeted the LLV and Oshkosh targeted the FFV. In today's environment I see little chance of the US Post Office's fleet being awarded to a foreign company. I also see that the targeted approach also gets the USPS exactly what they want without compromise.Because of the above, I'm nearly 100% certain that Oshkosh will be awarded part of the contract to replace the FFV and Workhorse will be awarded the portion of the contract to replace the LLV.I've seen some bad information posted, such as the Oshkosh prototype is EV or has an EV option, that's wrong. The only vehicles that will be built from this contract are the vehicles that were thoroughly tested by the USPS over the past few years. Below is an article that clearly states that Oshkosh/Ford submitted an internal combustion engine. Also, earlier this week there was an interview with the CFO of Workhorse were he unequivocally stated that the Workhorse prototype was the only EV submitted to the USPS - that would set stockholders up with an easy class action lawsuit against the company if that proves not to be true.The below is from an article about NGDV prototypes. ""The fourth team, specialty truck- and military vehicle maker, Oshkosh Corp., of Oshkosh, Wisc., and Ford Motor Co. of Dearborn, Mich., already have U.S. manufacturing facilities.

"I was going to joke this morning after the blowout earnings were released that watch to see what happened to CATs stock happen to OSK. Premarket stock looked good as expected. Conf call was well done and explained about the lag in new contracts and price increases due to commodities. I doubled my position at 73, thinking eventually investors will see how well run and strong OSK is. I'll buy more if it drops further."

"Strong earnings and restarting guidance! It is going to be a good year. Looking forward to the call to see if they will discuss the contract more in depth. It would be nice if we got some insight on the acquisition and investment. I did like the statement that ""we can provide 100% of either model"". I am still waiting on the Saudi deal for JTLV's."
Just want to clarify that Oshkosh Defense is a subsidiary of Oshkosh Corp and hence the increased revenues by almost $0.5B order with potential orders going forward will have a significant positive impact for OSK.
Breaking News! The USPS contract is in serious jeopardy of being rescinded. Kyle is still a we Todd.

"This one will be hard to predict, CAT had weak numbers but OSK has the defense industry component and it is much less reliant on Asian markets. Commercial and Industrial construction still very strong, I think they meet or even beat slightly tomorrow, depends on how the markets react to Apple earnings to see how OSK reacts."

"$OSK corporate jet landed in Clarksville Tennessee after the ups contract was announced, Leaked documents through a portal showed daimler and Indian Volo meetings"
This is not tranding well so maybe time to sell?
"this is a multi-billions contract with new EVs, maintenance and retrofitting the current fleet. And OSK is barely around $7B market cap..... this has a lot of room to go up."

Why is it tanking afterhours?? Are Oshkosh executives aware of bad news coming? We know they don't respect and follow insider trading laws....
"As we reported previously, the USMC selection of Naval Strike Missiles from Raytheon was first announced in May 2019. The image released today confirms that the USMC uses an unmanned variant of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) known as “ROGUE Fires”, as the NSM launch platform. The same vehicles is used for rockets:"
"dont know it this is new, but Oshkosh website front page is dedicated to EV tech."
"Solid company; good earnings, solid revenue, dividend, and they just got some mailbox money - what’s not to like? I expect institutions to increase their positions. Very interested to see if folks who bought the rumor, sell the news."
"I think every stock in the market is naturally overvalued right now, but if OSK can fall below $115 today, I think it will be the first time this year that I actually buy a stock for less than what it should actually be worth. The financials speak for themselves. With the USPS contract, this stock should be between $148-172 by the end of the year; without the USPS contract, it should be $134-152 by end of the year. I feel like this was all just perfect timing for long term investors looking for a dividend stock to buy. With the stalled infrastructure bill, the entire market taking a hit this week, and WKHS challenging the USPS, this stock fell way more than it should have. I'll be honest, I took a big hit with my 6/18 calls, but I'm confident the 7/16, 8/20, and 10/15 calls I've bought (and hopefully will buy more of today if it falls some more) will make up for all my losses. I've never been this bullish about a company."
hello all..does any body knows which battery power would OSK partner with in future USPS vehicles? any thoughts all welcome...thx
Even more issues for Dejoy.He has a couple more investigations including a conflict of interest.I wonder what the conflict of interest was and with what company. One guess.
"Tommorrow USPS chat meeting with WKHS will be smooth sailing..This deal has already been finalized fairly as chosen winner awarded to OSK..If ever needed to built full mass EV postal trucks, OSK can do it as been partner with Ford..Bottomline is OSK is a very strong reputable and Stable company with plentiful years of experiences.Also OSK will NOT lose Face or Faith to all us long term and Serious Investors ..Congraduation to those thats Long and Strong with OSK.."
I have bought this after they got contracts and I have to give a month or two before I judge this sleeping giant.
Workhorse lawsuit shows that Oshkosh submitted both ICE and EV. And took first and second place. Workhorse got 5th with value ranking AND technical ranking :(. Lol
Positive trend leading up to earnings.

"Was actually thinking about buying back into this one but it looks like they are trying to drop it back to pre-earnings levels, so the quick answer to that is no, not going to do it. Is it grossly undervalued, yes in my opinion, but it can be driven down so easily, it doesn't make for a good positive momentum play."
