I heard talibans are driving oshkosh vehicles in Afghanistan which is why the stock is crashing.
Please head over to Workhorse WKHS boardand offer them encouragement as their company faces an SEC probe over faked orders.

How about postal vehicle contract?
"Hmmmm people deleted their comments saying the contract would be reversed. I am glad we do not have to hear the same #$%$ over and over. Sorry Frank, willi, David, a or whatever you keep changing your name to, sps, and Wai. Thank you for the great entertainment!"
Oshkosh missed Q3 earnings and revenue expectations and has been on a downward slide ever since. It's about to drop below its 6 month low and might retest the 52 week low soon....
Soon back to the 80's....!!!
Why is it tanking afterhours?? Are Oshkosh executives aware of bad news coming? We know they don't respect and follow insider trading laws....
"If you believe in after hr numbers, then the Bid is 10 pennies higher than the close. Have no fear about tiny little Wkhs who only mango produce ~ 1 vehicle per week in 11 years. What they did produce a lot were returned for warranty work that cost tiny Wkhs ~ $8 million Lincolnâ€™s. They were UPS vehicles. Ups said bye bye"
Wah wah waaah
I wonder does any one remember the bidding process on a government contract called JEDI?The goverment asked for bids from multiple companies on cloud computing software for the Deparrment of Defense.Its pretty recent as a matter of fact the ruling for the case came down in JulyThe JEDI project was a 10 billion dollar project that was initially given to Microsoft.In the end the Penagon canceled the bid because it found there was political interfere with the bidding process and gave the contract to Amazon.I wonder what will happen in the court system to a bidding process on a goverment contract that has both political interfere and fraud?
$100 coming sooner than later

Maybe Workhorse CEO should work out a deal with OSK and merge together since the current OSK ceo is undergoing cancer treatment.

"So so we are clear.I never said OSK would lose the entire contract.I said its possible they will lose some or all of it.POSSIBLE is your operative word.Learn what the court documents and depositions mean.According to documents on Court Listener the case was dismissed without prejudice.A court case dismissed with prejudice the case is closed and its final.A court case dismissed without prejudice is temporary.This means that unless the plaintiff (Workhorse) and USPS/OSK can come to a settlement agreement it is within WKHSs power to re-open the case, add additional claims and go to court.Settlement implys some lose or concession on the part of USPS/OSK.As for lawsuits to the people involved in the impropriety that is yet to be seen."
"OMG it's down .59%Wait, that's sixty nine cents!Never mind it's all good as DOW is down137 points."
"I understand there was a suspicious trade made the night before the contract award to osk that the SEC and Congressional Oversight are looking into... if osk is involved, Will anyone from osk go to prison for that illegal trade...?"

They know who made that mysterious trade in the dead of night right before the contract award.....!!!
Why such dropped and still dropping ?
Court case tomorrow
"so if the court is dismissed, what is happening?"
Workhorse withdrew the protest. OSK can focus on building trucks now. Bought some more
I think there is some more writing on the wall as far as WKHS goes. The suit was dropped without prejudice which means it can be reopened by WKHS at any time. You may find these two companies working together in the future.

"Oshkosh never made an ev truck and they got a $3B contract instead of Workhorse, Suspicious trade before the contract too, thats shady don't u think. There gonna be people from america post and OSK going to jail."
Good company to short. Osk continues to fall. Wait till Sept 15 when wkhs continues Lawsuit. And osk is under sec investigation.
"Dejoy... the man who slowed down USPS service. Cut services, destroyed mail sorting machines as an election was commencing.Removed mail boxes as an election was commencing.Has questionable ties to companies he sanctioned USPS to use, where he use to work and still gets millions from them.He made the decision to use Oshkosh.Then somehow an investor bought 54,000 shares the night before the contract with USPS was announced.Then we have Ron Bloom. Mr. Bloom is Lewis Dejoys boss.This is the man who could ultimately fire Mr. Dejoy. Mr. Bloom has no intentions of firing Lewis Dejoy.He believes hes doing a great job.Hows that you ask? Well it seems Lewis Dejoy has funneled money (over 300k) to an Asset Management company Mr. Bloom is on the board of diectors of.Funny how that works. Isnt it?"
