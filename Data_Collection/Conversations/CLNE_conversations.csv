Large number Nov 10 calls bought today!
We haven't seen over 5 million shr. Traded since September 29th! Yay!
some think Shiba is solid but missed out on Somoyed. but clne will nail it this year. I'll be buying a lambo
Really pulling for this stock...small time investor... buy a few here and a few there when I can. Average is 7.14 and totally in this long term.
CLNE profit should skyrocket this quarter with energy costs being so high. Look for a pop to 13+. Earnings on 11-4-2021
Looks like oil is headed to $100 a barrel and more rng trucks will be going to the port of L.A.All good for CLNE
"No doubt about it, a BEV will out accelerate any equivalent gasoline or diesel powered vehicle……..BIG WHOOP TI DOOCommercial transportation doesn’t depend on acceleration to achieve efficiency, in fact, the cost of that acceleration is an enormous detriment to efficiency, and emissions…I.e. ACCELERATION DOESN’T COME CHEAP.Why pay the high ticket price for acceleration in a Class 8 truck?Cost efficiency is the driving force behind Class 8 truck sales, and acceleration doesn’t have value in the cost/efficiency equation for Class 8 vehicles.Let’s face it, the BEV sector has enormous allure within the “speed racer” segment of the car buying public, but NOT SO among Class 8 fleet buyers."
Get ready to swing to a profit on higher energy profits and follow XOM and CHV higher!
Hopping for good news before Nov 4 guess have to wait
"Wow, the amount of fud and CEO haters that are suddenly showing up. Guys nothing bad has come out from CLNE over the last 12 months. This company keeps signing more contracts, opening more fueling stations, and now they are in fueling shipping freighters. Amazon warrants are done and paid for, fueling stations are built, more and more trucking fleets converting to CNG powered motors. The lid is going to come off this thing. When it does you can either be happy you were on board before it did or you can be sitting in a corner crying because you listened to all these idiots spreading misinformation. Lastly earnings will be a beat and by Q2 2022 CLNE stock price will be in the stratosphere."
$40 next
"CLNE IS OBVIOUSLY UNDERVALUED! CLNE HAS BEEN FLOODED WITH POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS! These are the several that stand out. #1. RNG fuel being categorized carbon negative. #2. CLNE partners with three major energy companies “BP, TOTAL and CHEVRON”. #3. CLNE has two of the biggest delivery fleets in the U.S. in customers UPS and AMAZON. #4 The current administration is supporting alternative energy fuel and fighting climate change more than any past administration. #5. RNG fuel growth is exploding across the U.S. and will double within the next 2 years. #6. OIL is on its way to $100 a barrel. Positives can go on and on, so why are most investors missing out?"
Others on this board have suggested that “slow price progression” will be the “pattern” until Q3 is reported. After the Q3 report is released expect significant SP appreciation
Good news! There will be no methane emissions tax in social infrastructure bill was blocked by JM !
very bullish...it's going to blow in our face...congrats to all of you who waited and waited... gooooooddddd things to come very near future!
Anything I read or hear about this company is totally positive. yet...here we are back under 8.50
"So will CLNE supply RNG to develop the Hydrogen (hydrogen feedstock) for this station?Clean Energy is a leader in the development and delivery of RNG, a sustainable fuel derived from organic waste, which will represent 33.3% of the hydrogen feedstock for Foothill Transit buses.Either way, this shows CLNE’s ability to adapt to change. This is the beginning of their hydrogen path, have to start somewhere and build on experience to win additional contracts. GREEN Solutions:CNG/RNG - Mass Transit, Long Haul. (Amazon, UPS, etc…)LNG - Ocean Freight (Pasha, more to come)Hydrogen - Mass Transit (Foothill Transit, more to come)EV Charging - soon!Other opportunities - Aviation, Electric GridTotal / BP Partnerships for upstream RNG = PROFITS!Be patient, and you WILL be rewarded!"
"Buying at this is a gift to anyone paying close attention to what is happening. New trucks with new NG engines, new and existing trucks with conversion NG fuel systems kits. NG for semi trucks is the current way to current environmental targets. And, CLNE will play a major role in distribution of NG/RNG, while at the same time, using their resources and expertise to expand to hydrogen fuel cells when ready or even electric. Time to buy CLNE now and hold for retirement."
After down 4 1/2 percent yesterday basically trading sideways. This was at 9.30 not too long ago!
"The only problem I see with CLNE is it won't be around long enough to achieve full valuation, it will be taken for much less then it's worth. It really is one of the truly ""GREEN"" companies."
"https://www.visiontimes.com/2021/10/22/record-breaking-100-cargo-ships-backed-up-at-los-angeles-and-long-beach-ports.htmlNote: ""The backlog is also creating concern among environmentalists and public health officials, as the diesel-fueled vessels anchored outside the ports increase pollution. More than 100 tons of smog and other harmful pollutants are generated during normal times.""I'm all in for eliminating diesel trucks at the ports but this is getting ridiculous... #CLNE, #WPRT, #HYLN get those green trucks ready!"
"Even though I’m a great fan of the power and efficiency of diesel fuel, no one can deny the horrendous effect diesel emissions have on the ground nvironment.RNG, CNG, and LNG all provide the same power and efficiency when running with compression ignition.CLNE gaseous fuels with hundreds of stations strategically located across the USA.Cleaner fuel technology for both over the road transport, and ocean transport is now in the early stage of enormous growth otential"
STONG BUY!coming up...
CLNE should buy Hyzon. Hyzon builds hydrogen systems for existing trucks but needs somebody to supply the hydrogen. If any of CLNE's existing customers decide to add hydrogen to their fleet then CLNE already has the answer for them. (foothill transit is a good example)
"All is well, the root cause of the supply chain break is a severe shortage of emission compliant class 8 trucks.Domestic NG replaces importation of petroleum based long chain carbon molecules.Clearly the simplest hydrocarbon, CH4, methane is Cleanest fuel. There has been encouraging developments with H2 as a “carbon less” fuel for internal combustion engines. The future looks very bright fo clean transportation fuels, CLNE’s strong suit."
11 before ER and 14-15 after ER..top up time
this stock never change....hahahaha....thank you Mr little noob.
I think for some time now someone has been doing a pretty good job of gradually shaking shares loose and accumulating without driving the price up.
"Nearly 15,000,000 short sellers are “sitting ducks” as they await Q3 earnings report.Rising energy prices, combined with the unprecdented climate crisis has led many investors to believe there is high likelihood Q3 EBITDA will be a POSITIVE SURPRISE for CLNE ."
The whole sector will continue to rise. It's good to be here and it will be fun when the shorts get grilled.
"LA, Long Beach ports running 24/7. Means more fuel pumped."
"It feels like there's a much smalle % of long-term investors in CLNE. Most are speculators looking for a 5%- 10% profit, but quickly pull the trigger when stock drops even .15 or less Can't wait until most of these traders are completely out of CLNE for good."
"Have y’all seen what Cummins just came out with? “Cummins Inc. is releasing a 15-liter natural gas engine for heavy-duty trucks. The engine is an important part of Cummins’ strategy for its path to zero emissions to go further, faster to reduce the greenhouse gas and air quality impacts of its products in a way that is best for its customers and all stakeholders”When powered with renewable natural gas (RNG), using methane collected from organic waste as the primary fuel source, the system can be credited with a neutral to negative carbon index, resulting in net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at or below zero.These are snippets from an article released about CMI. For anyone who is bearish about CLNE I hope you actually do your research and DD. They are in position to one get bought out or two grow at huge rates. In comment below it talks about RNG being only 1%. Now we have big players like CMI in the mix creating engines that is suitable for RNG that CLNE produces…. Just some thought for people who are shorting this stock and are bearish on the outlook. 15 million shares short which isn’t a lot compared to float does not make this a meme play. This is indeed the future. I have no price targets currently but I believe the sky is the limit for this company."
Just read redditUps and clne signed a deal For nat gas...Pls pls up up and away
"Oh I'm holding to the end, but I'm also drowning in debt."
I am serenely backing up CLNE truck. 
China is the worlds largest consumer of natural gas. If they have a cold winter natural gas prices will go through the roof.
9.32 and climbing
CLNE looks like it is about to drop. Be careful guys. I have been reading http://the-alphatrader.com/ and their stocks have been doing way better.
"Great news for CLNE. Cummins introducing a 15L NG engine. First NG engine suitable for long-haul trucking. Gold mine for CLNE. (Bad news for Westport - Cummins is going it alone. If Westport also announces a new North American partner, CLNE will be a 100-bagger)."
"Does price action reflect fear that laid-off unvaxed truckers will reduce demand for fuel?Would like Little-un-fair to mention how many NGVs are operating at the LA and Long Beach ports? But, then again, there is a lot I would like to see done differently with this company."
Winning over shareholders! If he can repeat his performance from REDDIT to the next conference call it would be a big positive for CLNE!
"What do you suppose it means when Cummins, who put 15L NG engine development on hold in 2014 due to concerns about market timing, is now announcing the development and planned introduction of a 15L NG engine? This NG engine will be for over the road semis. Development and introduction of the 15L NG engine now seems to be driven by the growth of RNG and the need to meet EPA upcoming requirements. Cummins is driven to maintain their position as leading independent engine manufacturer for semi trucks. I think they know what they are doing."
"it's a wonderful world!Now waiting to get thumbs down., So this might be bots it doesn't matter what I post, I always get thumbs down. haha. I'll wait patiently now."
What a nightmare giving up weeks of positive charts trending!
I will say it again...someone has been doing a pretty good job at accumulating without running up the price too much!
it looks like CLNE is finally going to break out after 20 years of hype. the market has begun to realize the rng market is where it is at and CLNE controls the flow in the rng market. if the real green people figure that out CLNE could double within the year.
"The BTU comparison of oil to natural gas shows that NG is still grossly undervalued to oil. A thousand cubic feet of natural gas at $6 an MCF has 1/6 of the BTU of a barrel of oil. At $82 for a barrel of oil, the BTU equivalent of an MCF of gas should make gas worth about $14 an MCF."
"I switched my entire retirement portfolio over to stock that will be leader's in their field by the time it has come to maturity, and this is one of them. After the news today about the old guard, this really has a chance."
"Well, it's an exciting story here. Lots of shorts looking to lose money. A good story, rising attractiveness of the sector again. interesting buy. It's worth a small sum. Just to be there when the shorts get roasted."
"I emailed Sean Hannity Show concerning NGVs.He spends 1/3 of his shows bemoaning the fact that diesel is up tremendously over the past year. I mentioned that this is a ""self inflicted wound"" by truckers who have not taken Total/CLNE's lease program.Anyone else want to encourage him to learn about NGVs - and interview the likes of Linebarger, Littlefair and DJ? Just search ""email Sean Hannity radio"" and send it off.Cheers."
"Bloomberg: Methane is now public enemy number one. And cows are a big part of the problem no matter how desperately the beef industry is trying to spin it. This article makes it clear to everybody that methane emissions from agriculture is going to be a major focus in the climate fight. The cat is out of the bag. From here the need to trap methane emissions from cows is only going to get more and more buy-in which means CLNE is sitting on top of a huge emerging hot button issue. I suspect rules and regs are going to evolve in the next 12 months that will make methane capture and its productive use (RNG) a major policy initiative. “Mainstream climate science has long presented a much more grim arithmetic. Cows burp out large quantities of heat-trapping methane. As a result, beef causes vastly more emissions than most other foods—more than five times as much as an equivalent amount of chicken or pork and at least 15 times more than lentils and other plant-based proteins, according to data from the University of Michigan.”https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-19/beef-industry-falsely-claims-low-cow-carbon-footprint?cmpid=BBD101921_GREENDAILY&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=211019&utm_campaign=greendaily"

"i dont care what the news, as long as we are up its a great day"
Clean Energy Fuels is up 7.82% to 9.10
Buy more. Glta
The sector is picking up again. CLNE is well positioned. Shorts reach the intellectual level of Little Benny. We will have a lot of fun.
"UC Davis professor was speaking about one of biggest contributors to global warming being methane byproduct from cows, and how this is converted to rng and used as fuel for big rigs. Currently displacing 25% of the methane into clean burning fuel. Electric vehicles can't replace this green fuel that is helping to cool the earth. Rng is here to stay."
Good article...https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/best-cheap-stocks-to-buy-now-5-green-energy-stocks-to-watch-2021-10-12?amp
looks like we are going to be stranded for a long time.... not even earnings will save us...

")--Clean Energy Fuels Corp. (NASDAQ: CLNE), the country’s largest provider of the cleanest fuel for the transportation market, announced it has won a competitive solicitation to design, construct, and maintain a hydrogen station and supply liquid hydrogen fuel for Foothill Transit, an environmentally-friendly bus service in Southern California that averages 14 million rides a year."
The new price target from todays market watch is $15.82
Should be interesting Amazon ramping up airports busier Long Beach going full tilt and trucking nationally at capacity.Brave to be short.
CLNE marketing video to grocery supply chains. Very well done.https://www.progressivegrocer.com/how-clean-energy-transforming-grocery-supply-chains

"I'm long, as in it for the long haul because I have to be with 10,000 shares att $13.72 I've noticed several other energy stocks up well over 20% past 5 days..Check out PLUG if you really want to be depressed. HAHA"
Shorts are gonna get their faces melted.
"Wake me up when it hits $21.The Boonlittle Self Serving Scam waiting game will keep them happy for a long time whether profitable or unprofitable as it has been for the past decades. Republican management begging Democrats for uncle Sam subsidies, claiming game changers, never profitable while they stash the loot in yachts. Not a political endorsement of neither. What is CLEAN about running a yacht? What is clean about a management that has made Billions collectively but company never profitable? Who profited?Invest in Clean Energy was like going to the Cleaner for many investors who invested for their kids college tuition and could not afford a train ticket after 10 years.Oh ya the irony, I recall reading that a CEO son was fraudulently taking class by someone else and receiving credits bribed by his parent and even graduated? Does anyone know who?Do these people REALLY care about our environment and do they really care about making the company profitable for ALL shareholders who REALLY want to make a change?"
Time window till earnings is quickly eroding for thousands of shorts. Hang on folks. The next three weeks should be fantastic.
I go past Cummings plant often and have talked with workers; NG engines have been shipping for quite a while. Many are large semi type engines. They are working multiple shifts tp keep up with demand. The future is bright my friends.
"A study by the American Gas Foundation found that RNG supplies can reach between 10 billion and 35 billion gallons of fuel per year. This is a HUGE opportunity for CLNE, the only coast-to-coast RNG provider with 560+ stations to capture their unfair share of this HUGE amount of RNG demand coming! https://www.freightwaves.com/news/3-reasons-rng-is-decarbonizing-trucking-today"
"One of the listed company tickers below makes far more profit than all the other companies combined, derives fully one fourth of its revenue from lithium (amounting to one fifth of the world's lithium market), and gets another third of its revenue from specialty fertilizers (a market which has been on fire just like lithium). Furthermore, this company has zero net debt and is growing its already big profits year over year at a 65% clip.

massive beat up earnings report!!!!
forget 2021 and 2022 ...clne is dead
Look at the after hours boost on big volume.
"The US DOE, EPA, USDA and EIA report that LESS THAN 1% of the methane produced is RNG.- In one report (below) the US EIA reports that in 2020, LESS THAN 0.2% of Methane production is RNG.- The US DOE, EPA, USDA and EIA report that when RNG production doubles, LESS THAN 1% of methane produced will be RNG.- The US DOE, EPA, USDA and EIA report that when RNG production doubles again, LESS THAN 1% of methane produced will be RNG.- US Argonne National Laboratories report that the TOTAL RNG future potential is ONLY 1.5% of Methane produced.- If you search RNG articles there are some estimates even lower. Globally these estimates are all lower.These facts and this information is very disappointing. I thought the RNG potential was much larger, but 1.5% is fairly insignificant.www.americangeosciences.org/...www.sightline.org/...www.nrcs.usda.gov/...www.nrcs.usda.gov/...www.naturalgasintel.com/..."
Wouldn't it be terrible if RNG is cut from the Infrastructure Bill? This might explain today's drop.
Above-average volume for a change!
Cant wait till Nov 4th news
