"Wake me up when it hits $21.The Boonlittle Self Serving Scam waiting game will keep them happy for a long time whether profitable or unprofitable as it has been for the past decades. Republican management begging Democrats for uncle Sam subsidies, claiming game changers, never profitable while they stash the loot in yachts. Not a political endorsement of neither. What is CLEAN about running a yacht? What is clean about a management that has made Billions collectively but company never profitable? Who profited?Invest in Clean Energy was like going to the Cleaner for many investors who invested for their kids college tuition and could not afford a train ticket after 10 years.Oh ya the irony, I recall reading that a CEO son was fraudulently taking class by someone else and receiving credits bribed by his parent and even graduated? Does anyone know who?Do these people REALLY care about our environment and do they really care about making the company profitable for ALL shareholders who REALLY want to make a change?"

"No doubt about it, a BEV will out accelerate any equivalent gasoline or diesel powered vehicle……..BIG WHOOP TI DOOCommercial transportation doesn’t depend on acceleration to achieve efficiency, in fact, the cost of that acceleration is an enormous detriment to efficiency, and emissions…I.e. ACCELERATION DOESN’T COME CHEAP.Why pay the high ticket price for acceleration in a Class 8 truck?Cost efficiency is the driving force behind Class 8 truck sales, and acceleration doesn’t have value in the cost/efficiency equation for Class 8 vehicles.Let’s face it, the BEV sector has enormous allure within the “speed racer” segment of the car buying public, but NOT SO among Class 8 fleet buyers."
"UC Davis professor was speaking about one of biggest contributors to global warming being methane byproduct from cows, and how this is converted to rng and used as fuel for big rigs. Currently displacing 25% of the methane into clean burning fuel. Electric vehicles can't replace this green fuel that is helping to cool the earth. Rng is here to stay."
