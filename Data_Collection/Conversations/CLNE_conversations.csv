Mitchell Pratt COO exercised 60000 options and sold no stock.Very bullish insider behavior.Holds over 700000 shares
All you need to do is look at the behavior of PLUG and some of the other cash flow negative alternative energy stocks to know what ails CLNE.Unfortunately Robin Hooders use a lot of margin and options.Unfortunately they are big holders of CLNE and WPRT The only thing that will stop the professional traders is stronger earnings or a major development.Fortunately CLNE and WPRT have sufficient cash and great prospects.Stay chilled and average down if you can.A couple of years from now these companies will probably be making some real money and the rewards will be worth it.
"How is this missed? WHERE IS CLNE’S CEO IN THIS FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT? Why is he not showing his face weekly talking about CLNE and it’s products? Is he that weak? RNG fuel is a newer product compared to other fuels with many positive benefits. He’s not taking advantage of all the climate change talk and discussing CLNE or RNG. RNG fuel is exploding across the U.S., so why is CLNE’S CEO not out building CLNE’S brand? I don’t believe Reddit servers went down yesterday!"
"LITTLEFAIR’S BIG MAJOR STRATEGY CHANGE ADDRESSING REDDIT FORUM MONDAY? It could have a big impact on growing investors or maybe not! I guess better late than never, but isn’t Littlefair a lot late with addressing investors other than conference calls. For years he has done nothing other than earnings date conference calls to increase knowledge about RNG fuel or build confidence with his CLNE shareholders. Littlefair has never addressed investors like he is tomorrow on Reddit! Is he trying to grow investor support for once? I believe tomorrow is good for CLNE, but why has it taken so long and why now?"

This stock should be at least 20
"Considering that all internal combustion engines can be easily and cheaply converted to LNG and RNG, and EV's are expensive and require frequent long charges, the market for CLNE's products appear limitless. It will be decades if ever that our electrical grid system will be able to handle a large number of EV's. What most people miss is the fact that only 10% of the current US electrical needs are provided by solar and wind. The bulk of the other 90% is generated by plants that use, you guessed it, fossil fuels, (natural gas, petroleum and coal). Nuclear energy is the clear answer but fear of exposure to radiation by the public and the environmental problem by disposal of spent rods, will keep new plants at a minimum."
this is going up steady...there's no more shares to dump...very hard these last two months...good road ahead... looking forward next earning call... double revenue... EPS going to be recalculated upward next week
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/renewable-gas-producer-archaea-surges-224336415.html. U.S. largest RNG producer has debut on New York stock exchange yesterday. This is a great sign!
this should at least be $22
what a terrible management team...no clue about PR...specially when there's some kind of good news to support...

The sector is picking up again. CLNE is well positioned. Shorts reach the intellectual level of Little Benny. We will have a lot of fun.
"Nat Gas is $5.65 at this moment, speaking about RNG where CLNE produces their own product using cow methane, landfills etc. I have never seen any statement from the company about what it costs to produce RNG, does anyone know this info?"

Gonna be some real money made on the upside.

I think for some time now someone has been doing a pretty good job of gradually shaking shares loose and accumulating without driving the price up.
what I like is the way the article begins....the country's largest provider of the cleanest fuel for the transportation market tttt...read between the lines!!!!let us be patient and definitely we will be rewarded big time!!!!
"For what it’s worth: ZACKS has now given CLNE a BUY RATING…….I’ve always questioned ZACKS……..however, this one is probably correct"
Ok. In conclusion. Anyone & everyone. Should not listen to Benny & Jack. But if you believe in climate change. RNG is the best. Sorry. It’s better than batteries. Please ask more questions! Or. Google it. Where do these batteries come from?! So heavy

He was a notorious “green mailer” and provided $$$$$billions in profits for shareholders of target companies.Boone was a visionary, 1996 he founded Clean Energy Fuels Corporation. Early on he foresaw the present environmental crisis, and the need for cleaner transportation fuel.I’m sorry that Boone has moved to the great beyond, but I suspect he’s smiling at the progress being built from the foundation he set in place"

Bullish pattern chart!! Jumping in !
Can CLNE's stock ever get traction? Been holding forever. What's it going to take? ....Go Patriots........................GLTA
Yesterday CLNE share price leaped $1.09. Today we “gave back” $0.76.That’s the kind of price action I enjoy.Buying op IMHO.
I expect sector rotation into cleaner energy
The next 5 or 6 months should be fun. Tell SS that I will still sell him 100 shares at $25/share til then.
aaannd it's dropping again
With options expiring today; we should end up nicely.
"What next, Total buyout CLNE? sounds feasable to me, get the jump on Chevron filling stations and has the $$ to expand the 600+/- stations nationwide. Beat the competion. They can simply stroke a check. GLTA"
Is there a restatement here too? LOL
"Chevron CEO on mad money talked about importance and scalability of RNG, touched on carbon negativity, mentioned working with Amazon and several other big companies by name but didn't mention CLNE by name though, wonder why? I am thinking a buyout is coming sooner than we think and he knew the mere mention of their partnership with CLNE from him would cause the stock price to run up."
Take a look at the 1 month and 6 month charts. We just broke some key resistance in the $8.20 area.
8.65 this Friday and 10.23 next week mark my word

"RNG are estimated to produce 95% less lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than vehicles fuelled by gasoline or diesel, according to the US Department of Energy.“RNG is a necessary energy transition approach in the near-term, but green hydrogen and the use of RNG to power electric vehicle charging stations will be the backbone of a fast transition to a net zero future,” CleanBay chief executive Donal Buckley said."
Remember that these analysts targets for CLNE are fairly short term targets
Others on this board have suggested that “slow price progression” will be the “pattern” until Q3 is reported. After the Q3 report is released expect significant SP appreciation
8.20 is now support if we see a drop that’s the price the stock will rebound off of. If it does drop buying at that level is key
"Everyone wants a piece of the RNG market. Gonna be a big'n. And CLNE so nicely positioned with large customers, large distribution network, their own supply operations, network of existing customers, and strong balance sheet. I believe the launch pad and umbilical tower is now complete. Time to move the rocket into position for launch."
The writing is on the wall:Climate change is the overarching issue threatening humanity in the 21st century.Atmospheric pollution is the leading cause of global warming.CLNE has transportation fuels that significantly reduce atmospheric pollution.CLNE is “ready and waiting” to expand the clean technology
Looks like oil is headed to $100 a barrel and more rng trucks will be going to the port of L.A.All good for CLNE
Finally
Big oil has to go on a shopping spree to get foothold in clean energy. They waited too long. Just as big pharma shops for tiny bios to replinish thier stable of drugs.clne in a very advantagoius position. Their foresight will pay off big IMHO
Think the 3rd quarter results should be much improved and with higher margin product coming on line in 2022 and onwards stock should move higher.Capital from AMZN warrant exercise will certainly help scale the business. I think as other majors start building their RNG retail networks the value of CLNE’s stations will be recognized.
This stock needs higher sustained volume! Trading below average volume!
"No need to deny the need of RNG. Just a matter of time...like Greta said...with climate change....it's gon na happen if u like it or not. Therefore, those who wish to bash it by shorting will eventually get their ... handed to them. if they had there ..... together , they would switch positions now and drive it to where it will eventually go. straight the ... up"

"As usual, purveyors of misinformation, I.e., jack, Benny, et.al. are short sellers with vested interest to see CLNE share price lose value.Notice Jack’s crocodile tears about CLNE issuing Amazon warrants to put chase CLNE at $13.49/share.AMZN is becoming a PRIME consumer of RNG. CLNE negotiated warrant strike price nearly 100% above the present price———I consider AMZN a terrific customer, and any knowledgeable investor is looking foreword to the time AMZN exercises at the 13.49 strike…..AMZN sees tremendous potential, otherwise why consider paying 100% over present market price for the equity"
Broke out above 8.45 breakout point. Now just need heavy volume!
"Hey Reddit! This company does not sell used games, or over priced popcorn...they are trying to improve the world. Jump on in and give CLNE a major boost. Thanks in advance."
Double volume!
Interesting Pratt did stock exercise with no sale of any stock within his family trust.Not sure the implications in his trust but no sales after option exercise is generally considered extremely bullish as the price on the day of exercise is the taxable event.

Short squeeze or institutional/whale purchase?
Benny i am on your side clne is over the hill. But it is good to use the Cow poop gas ln power planets to run ev like buses and class 8 And trucks. You know byd made 400 buses in calf.
Those who continue to post disparaging comments about CLNE management simply don’t comprehend the enormity of the task to introduce widespread use of NEW TRANSPORTATION FUEL.
"Keep in mind, taday’s low $8.42 is higher than last week’s high. The uptrend is solid and likely to continue into Q3 report.Q3 EBITBA should propel SP to yearly highs, and onward and UPWARD"

"CLNE IS OBVIOUSLY UNDERVALUED! CLNE HAS BEEN FLOODED WITH POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS! These are the several that stand out. #1. RNG fuel being categorized carbon negative. #2. CLNE partners with three major energy companies “BP, TOTAL and CHEVRON”. #3. CLNE has two of the biggest delivery fleets in the U.S. in customers UPS and AMAZON. #4 The current administration is supporting alternative energy fuel and fighting climate change more than any past administration. #5. RNG fuel growth is exploding across the U.S. and will double within the next 2 years. #6. OIL is on its way to $100 a barrel. Positives can go on and on, so why are most investors missing out?"
"The short's day is comming. To much in store, too many partnerships with $B companies, Too many fueling contracts to even mention, Profits on the books now. Sooner or later the massive shorting of this company will be history. Jack, have your fun while it lasts......................GLTA"
"Well, it's an exciting story here. Lots of shorts looking to lose money. A good story, rising attractiveness of the sector again. interesting buy. It's worth a small sum. Just to be there when the shorts get roasted."

Where’s Adrienne ? You still think short CLNE?
Hey folks do some research on hydrogen production- you guessed it RNG = green hydrogen/ Mr Cummins is going all in on hydrogen.
CEO of Chevron was Cramer tonight. Lots of love for RNG and Green Hydrogen.
heading back to $10 end of month
"Easy to vision Chevron leading the charge to adopt renewable, clean energy, among the oil majors."
Catch 22! The rapid rise in natural gas prices may delay or slow customers from switching over!
"It’s interesting to note: CLNE naysayers have no substantive reasons to oppose increased use of RNG as a clean substitute for diesel fuelNaysayers (short sellers and “fearful” EV proponents) can only provide short sighted personal assumptions, and conclusory statements of unfounded scientific outlook about the future of RNG and fossil NG as a significantly cleaner transportation fuel for heavy duty truck fleets."
78 million gallons in which time frame? 10 years?
Why it is red even there are some good news???

Littlefield sold 2 million shares of CLNE Jan 2021.. I wonder why?LolLolHe makes 2 million a year in salary.Living well off the inventory of CLNE.. investors paying the executive’s salaries
Everytime there is a negative article on CLNE it’s flys
Has anyone seen Benny?
"Recently, RNG has again been referred to as a ""bridge"". I think some do this to denote short term. I do think it is a bridge for much longer than some might think. One fuel will not displace all the diesel. I think, RNG will be an important long term solution for the next 20 years+."

There’s significant misinformation surrounding WARRANTS to buy CLNE the were issued in connection with Amazon’s contract to purchase RNG from CLNE.Many investors are under the mistaken belief that CLNE “kicked back” a large part of the proceeds with the warrants.Nothing could be further from the truth. The warrants allow Amazon to buy up to 20% of CLNE for $13.49/share. The price/share is nearly double what CLNE was trading at the date the deal as made.I’m a fan of AMZN and I welcome being part of AMZN’s investment group
"IMO, CLNE should release new deals when signed, to provide more positive PR throughout the quarter vs a single dump around earnings. CLNE can always summarize all the deals at earnings. We need more positive PR ~10 times (each deal signed) a quarter vs single dump. More positive PR is better!"
Closed at the high of the day! & 3 × the volume! 10 is next resistance!
My only issue with this stock is the company's CEO/board/management ability to execute a plan. Their prior failures do not leave me with much confidence. All the deals since the company inception seem to favor everyone except the retail investor. I am in this stock hoping for a buyout.
13.5 next target!

Shorts covering now? or in another 10% from now?
IMO Amazon will be very happy with their warrants before Xmas
Short squezze
"IT’S OBVIOUS CLNE’S PUBLIC RELATIONS ACTIONS ARE MAKING NO SENSE! What’s going on with CLNE??? Negative carbon RNG fuel is a smoking hot growth product, yet CLNE is currently doing little to increase CLNE or RNG’S public popularity! Why is CLNE not creating or drawing attention to themselves in this administrations friendly environment to cut emissions?"
GEN Z and MILLENNIUMS huge efforts to cut emissions are helping to create momentum in the RNG fuel market! Great job! Go CLNE!
RECOGNIZING A BULL! CLNE’S current value VS RNG fuels massive market potential are at opposite ends of the spectrum! The balance is far out of whack. CLNE’S $19 share price was just scratching the surface and obviously now wants to breakout! Do your research RNG fuel is aggressively expanding and this will run higher! GL!
"Oh I'm holding to the end, but I'm also drowning in debt."
"Climate change can be significantly moderated, possibly reversed with the elimination of diesel bunkering for ocean transport; and the elimination of diesel fueling for long haul truck fleets.CLNE is leading the charge in both sectors."
"Nat gas at $5.45 this morning so why isn't CLNE price exploding to the upside? I have been a shareholder for about 5 years and since I've owned this I have never seen Nat Gas so expensive, so in past years when we sell 100,000,000 gallons with the gas price between 2 and 3 dollars shouldn't our Q3 revenue double with the +$5 price of nat gas. Someone please play devil's advocate and tell me why this assumption might be incorrect."
"It is fighting well, stay the course, alternative/green energy solid place to be"
DOWN 5% on no news. Not a good sign.My worry is that we don't reverse this trend before Tax Loss selling starts. We have all seen what happens to CLNE when longs start really dumping.I think today was a preview.
5 weeks til earnings
"Keep on buying people! These prices aren't going to last forever. Not one analyst has CLNE priced under two digits. Some of the newer people prob don't understand that CLNE spends every last dollar builing more and more filling stations at 1-1.5 million per station. They currently are approaching 600 stations.....plus the semi's needed to fill them weekly. Also, these stations are being built to accept hydrogen in the future alonside RNG. Look it up!"

RNG sales are aggressively growing and volume could double again in the next couple of years in the U.S., so where are the fireworks.

Hope to see a huge run up ah on this Reddit meeting.....Go CLNE!!!!!!!

We haven't seen over 5 million shr. Traded since September 29th! Yay!
"K, good news, as expected. Whole world talking about clean energy and this for sale?? Haha. Back to $20 plus, no problem"
There seems to be a lot of investors that will cash out when CLNE reaches the mid-teens or in the 20's but this play has barely even started yet and they will regret not holding for years to come.
"@Nolan That's so sad to hear, Did you sell one shr or both of your shrs?"
"Shares are up 15% in the last month. If you haven’t taken advantage of the oversold price just blame YOUR own timidity, not the CEO. He is going to be trumpeting the benefits of his company and YES Reddit was down when he was scheduled for Q&A. Booya"

Wow! Something is happening here.

Littlefair gets CLNE’S share price back up in the $20’s and I’ll be a fan of his! He did a good job answering questions on the Q and A Reddit forum. Also most all the posters and investors on this board understand why the shorts and bashers of CLNE play their negative games. It’s currently very obvious the shorts are looking silly bashing CLNE. CLNE’S potential is growing bigger and bigger everyday and even the shorts know the share price is at a discount with huge potential! GL!
why is this not surprising. a company with tons of potential and contracts and still can't break $10. what is going on here.
It's heading to 21-29. Add before anyone else !

The lifespan of an electric battery is 10 years and is not renewable. By 2050 these batteries will fill landfills with 50 million pounds of waste that does not break down. I wonder if people would still believe in electric power cars, vehicles or equipment if they knew how massive the carbon emissions footprint really was? "

Listen closely!If you are shorting the stock like Jack & Benny. And 3-4 other nefarious folks. Thumb down brigade. Ya see them. Good luck to youz. Jack mentioned his 100k share option. Hez or shez. Well. Gotz some balz behind the back. Perhaps he can keep the hedgies pumping the downside. But. It’s gonna break. Sooner. Than later. Jackie boy. Close your short. Come to the force! Thank me later.

Just search ""email Sean Hannity radio"" and send it off.Cheers."
Chevron taking out ANG? What does this mean for CLNE?
"This is good. People nagging this, get out. If you aren’t here with confidence and only come around to nag, leave. FYI- I am new to stocks, less than a year and I did not sell when we went +18% the other day. Gladly accepted going back into the red. Be patient, all."

Time to load up more. Soon touching $10
The volume in this stock is not very robust!
"In three weeks, you will wish that you owned CLNE"
rocket into the $20 plus
The whole sector will continue to rise. It's good to be here and it will be fun when the shorts get grilled.
WILL WALL STREET AND OIL MAJORS NOTICE CHEVRON ANNOUNCED EXPANSION OF ITS CNG BRAND? CHEVRON is buying ANG “American natural gas” network of 60 CNG stations. Will the other majors step up and challenge Chevron and expand their own RNG assets? Who’s the next target?
"Wednesday, September 22nd @ 1pm PST Andrew Littlefair will be doing an open forum Q&A with retail investors on Reddit. If you want to squash rumors with quality questions this will be your time."
I hope it’ll reach more than 9 today
Please we need to break 9.24 with a huge volume
I thought CLNE was a good deal at 15. It is now a GREAT deal.
I wonder who set stop losses @ $8.75 and got bounced out today… too bad.
How’s your day Benny?
Looks strong 
RNG and Hydrogen Fuel Cell trucks will fill up at CLNE. How exciting!
"Wow, the market giveth and the market taketh. Up 3.5% early, to down over 5% now. OUCH!"
I would like Benny & Jack to know that I would never give them a thumbs down. Only would like to convince their hedge fund. Jack mentioned 1000 options at one point. Not sure which side. Million shares. He’s a big boy. Volume 2 million. He’s a big boy. Maybe realize you should hold. Buy and hold Benny boy. Jackie. Buy and hold
"It,s truely surprising how clueless “naysayers” seem to believe they know more about building a transportation fuel enterprise than those overseeing creation of Clean Energy Fuel Corporation from scratch.Keep in mind these naysayers have vested interest to see CLNE share price lose value….."
Would you belive $100 a share in 2025 ? Watch.
I like this stock ! Adding 10.000!
This is the news that triggered that spike. BZ: Clean Energy Fuels Option Alert: Fri $9 Calls Sweep (16) near the Ask: 1000 @ $0.3 vs 8489 OI; Earnings 11/4 After Close Ref=$9.06. Reported on ThinkorSwim @ 2:20pm
CLNE should buy Hyzon. Hyzon builds hydrogen systems for existing trucks but needs somebody to supply the hydrogen. If any of CLNE's existing customers decide to add hydrogen to their fleet then CLNE already has the answer for them. (foothill transit is a good example)
"I’m bullish on CLNE because traditional transportation fuels are wreaking havoc with unprecedented atmospheric pollution. Climate scientists are convinced that catastrophic weather trends will continue until humanity limits continue use of polluting carbon based fuels of diesel fuel, and coal.North America is THE Saudi Arabia of natural gas, which is 25% cleaner than diesel fuel. Additionally RNG is actually cleaner than ZERO EMISSIONS. Don’t forget a strong argument can be made that hydrogen, H2 will eventually make all carbon based fuels obsolete.Time will tell, but CLNE share price should regain upward momentum next week."
"So will CLNE supply RNG to develop the Hydrogen (hydrogen feedstock) for this station?Clean Energy is a leader in the development and delivery of RNG, a sustainable fuel derived from organic waste, which will represent 33.3% of the hydrogen feedstock for Foothill Transit buses.Either way, this shows CLNE’s ability to adapt to change. This is the beginning of their hydrogen path, have to start somewhere and build on experience to win additional contracts. GREEN Solutions:CNG/RNG - Mass Transit, Long Haul. (Amazon, UPS, etc…)LNG - Ocean Freight (Pasha, more to come)Hydrogen - Mass Transit (Foothill Transit, more to come)EV Charging - soon!Other opportunities - Aviation, Electric GridTotal / BP Partnerships for upstream RNG = PROFITS!Be patient, and you WILL be rewarded!"
Yahoo should at the least double their one year estimate' if not triple it.
"Snooze, you lose !I have Been in CLNE for years with many ups and downs; but with earnings less than two months away, that will be good if not stellar, I can;t imagine someone missing the boat. There is a good chance of a near double in 8 weeks,. The short sellers can not hold this down. GLTAL"
"Buying at this is a gift to anyone paying close attention to what is happening. New trucks with new NG engines, new and existing trucks with conversion NG fuel systems kits. NG for semi trucks is the current way to current environmental targets. And, CLNE will play a major role in distribution of NG/RNG, while at the same time, using their resources and expertise to expand to hydrogen fuel cells when ready or even electric. Time to buy CLNE now and hold for retirement."
Amazon bought 20% of this company and said it would use this fuel in all their trucks and vans. If Amazon is in then I'm in.
"Recently I saw a Big new white Amazon truck with their logo in blue ...intriguing ...but now I saw all together 5 ... The big Amazon truck are blue with a white logo ... May be I am dreaming but could it be that the newer truck using RNG would have a new color code and we will see more and more ? I found nothing on internet on it . Are they new or they have been around for a while and I did not picked up .On another note , on the East coast they are quiet a bit of Whole Foods trucks ...the place with Bio food , bio Cosmetics , ... It would make sense to convert them too to RNG as a division of Amazon ..."
look who's dropping again
It is going to be a long weekend. Earnings are getting closer After the short push; we could go up quickly. Buy now or cry later. GLTAL.
What a beautiful perfect day! It’s going!
What has become of Littlefair's Reddit Q&A? Anyone?................GLTA
A lot of good news today going to keep moving up
I hope it’ll reach 10 today!
"CLNE and s presently the most intriguing equity on the board.RNG is certain to take significant share of the long haul transportation fuel market now dominated by deadly diesel fuel.RNG is both cheaper and cleaner than any fuel option, including electricity."
been hitting these resistance level @ 8.30. lets break it and we should go higher!
"Sorry to repeat, just to remind; TOTAL owns 25% of CLNE, partnerships with; Amazon, BP, and Chevron. New RNG plants and filling stations currently being built. Not sure, but if RNG and Ngas gets even a fair share of a foothold in trucking, we're golden. Diesel won't be replaced for decades, but its growing, I like the players, I'll follow the money for now.....................GLTA"
They can paint the tape after every close' but' we are still headed higher.
Someone is very nervous this morning.
Three minutes before market closes. Hopefully we can hang on to some of this today. Low priced stocks like CLNE attract huge numbers of day Traders who sell their tiny profits daily.
"Any idea who the Major Global Logistics customer may be? It looks like they have taken approx 382 CNG/RNG trucks. Hoping CLNE will be fueling some, if not all.https://ngtnews.com/logistics-company-places-tenth-rng-cng-truck-order-with-hexagon-agility"
Massive OIL spill off the coast of California causing major environmental problems! OIL IS JUMPING AGAIN TODAY! $100 OIL caused CLNE speculation to run rapid last time. Is this the beginning?
