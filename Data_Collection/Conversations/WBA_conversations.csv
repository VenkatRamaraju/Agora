"Close the stores that the criminals are stealing from almost daily without consequences, sorry but it's true. I worked as a store manager (no longer) but i have a huge stake in the company and i do like the new CEO Rosalind Brewer very much. Lastly, joint ventures with other strong healthcare players could help the bottomline"
$48 by Monday! Then up and up!!
Why would 80% of analysis have a hold on WBA when it's rating should be UNDERVALUE based on its performance?
Never sell or short a drugstore chain during flu and cold season let alone during a pandemic with the vaccines flowing
45.50 sellers today are dying. I said buy the dive today.
Dollar cost average into div. should be higher about a 1.15
SanFran city politicians and the public are complaining that WBA is closing stores.These same people are doing most of their shopping on line.Don’t need a IQ over 40 to understand that.
"The company has used a portion of the funds to repay the outstanding amount owed on a $3.8 billion term loan that funded the bond tender completed by the company on April 26, 2021. This has eliminated $3.3 billion in debt from the company’s balance sheet. The remaining net cash proceeds are planned to be invested in strategic opportunities and to expand healthcare offerings to help accelerate the company’s growth strategy."
Hoping we are at or near a bottom here . I'm in at $47.05 and going down . Just looking for the dividends and the long term . Best of luck to all .
dividend increase coming? maybe?
Buy healthcare
"Alliance, Inc. (Nasdaq: WBA) today announced it has completed the sale of its Alliance Healthcare businesses to AmerisourceBergen for total consideration of approximately $6.5 billion, made up of $6.275 billion in cash (subject to a customary net cash and working capital adjustment) and 2 million shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock. The company will use the cash proceeds to reduce debt and accelerate growth of its core retail pharmacy and healthcare businesses."
"Lol, apparently earnings mean nothing. Rigged market."
After the sale if Alliance eoy expect to hear the expansion plan and see the projections that are already complete for 2022-2026 in a plan to put capital to work by buildout and purchasing small chains in 2 markets. We are going to have a great 2022
Its about time they closed those store in SF. If they refuse to arrest and incarcerate those who steal then let them suffer . That was the reason name brand stores never opened in communities like that.

Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. WBA announced Wednesday that it has sold a majority of its Alliance Healthcare business to pharmaceutical product and services provider AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC in a $6.5 billion deal.
Health and pbm like wba will be the stocks to be in for 2022
"AmerisourceBergen will pay nearly $6.3 billion in cash and 2 million shares of its common stock for Walgreens’ Alliance Healthcare business in a deal the companies expect to close by September. Walgreens already owns a nearly 30% stake in AmerisourceBergen.Alliance Healthcare supplies more than 115,000 pharmacies, physicians and health centers in Europe and Egypt."
"Just to say it nicely: waw, what a disappointment.Sounded to me like CEO Rosalind Brewer wanted to sell some more medicine against turning stomachs with her self-aggrandizing ramblings and lowball ambitions. I'm sure that is not why they wanted her in the drivers seat. Obviously there is little interest in a stock that 'promises' to grow 10% annually. Undervalued ok, looks like nobody cares?"
There is most definitely shadow banning here..at least for me...I posted link to vaers detail and summary data that cdc puts out weekly and no comments on it even when it appears to me
strong buy now

"Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) and AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) are profitable companies that have clear paths to future revenue growth. ResMed is already an industry leader in sleep apnea therapies, an area that's expected to grow as our population ages. Walgreens Boots Alliance is jumping onto the trend toward value-oriented healthcare services, and AbbVie's huge stable of drugs and pipeline give it a diversity that protects its long-term outlook."
Bought on close 600 holding 850
Healthcare pharmacies insurance will be next years winners
"Today we are adding to one of our core positions. WFC, BSX, WBA and APA good luck in position building remember it takes a good six months or more to get in at good prices."
WAY OVERSOLD!!!
"Hoping we at or near the bottom here . I'm in at $47.05 , so best of luck to all ."
Santa Clause rally for this 51 coming
"Let's see the facts for WBA. Before the Q4 the price was $47.27, then better than expected Q results came, Now the price is back to the level before the Q results, this is very wrong. This stock is over sold and and big wigs are slowly loading up to take your shares. the price right now should be at least $50 per a share and before the year ends should go to $54. I keep my shares, not dumping"
"Sad reality is WBA was always behind from their management team reguarding future growth. CVS on the other hand saw changes coming for retail drug stores and made major investments in insurance ( Aetna) PBMs, others.Hopfully with new management team in place WBA could regain confidence again and be a major player in Health Care."
With end of year portfolio adjustments I could see stock 40-42 level.Be prepared!
"What? First they eliminated printed ads. Now, I just checked Walgreens website and they've eliminated the digital weekly ad, which had the same feel as the printed ads. They've replaced it with a area called ""Deals of the week"". This is much shorter and not nearly as colorful as the weekly ad. Another cost-cutting measure that does a disservice to the customer. *Posted by a real shareholder.*"
Imagine where WBA would be trading if general mkt dived 20%?Mid 30s
I’m looking for more stores to close.
Released 4k
Bought 200 premarket
I am sick of all the spam on yahoo! I actually try to stay off of the WBA message board now and exclusively use http://the-alphatrader.com/
Companies being priced to sales will fall in this phase of market value valuations will start to run into 2022 and 2023. Wba will trade at a pe if 15-17 next year on expansion plans that puts us about 60 to 68 more online in future growth with healthcare piers
