Any earnings predictions?
"@Lijuan, hopefully there are legs behind the announcement, but this is definitely a pump dump all day today. check out it's partner mentioned in $CNS press release this morning. Moleculin Biotech, Inc.- $MBRX. They announced the exact same press release yesterday early morning and got the same flurry up in SP followed by it being pump/dump down since then. It had 165m volume yesterday and another 30m in volume today... Only time will tell, but guessing this one will have similar trend down until further news developments who knows when..."
