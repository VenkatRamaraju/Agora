I'm in the Special Forces and our community is transitioning to UA tactical gear. I bought at 11.88 in Nov 17'. Holding for two years. Hold strong fellas! Make America Great Again!
"Unscientific observation: I was at the ballfields all weekend for a baseball tournament, and UA was seen a lot more than Nike or Adidas Same at the gym. I don't know what the margins these items are being sold at, but visibility is definitely increasing"
Double digits growth
"With Larose, MD of North America, now being replaced, Frisk adds to his cleaning house part of his 3 year growth/profitability plan. Leadership has been let go, in some form or fashion, in HR, Marketing, Creative, Product Design, MD of Europe, MD of Asia, let alone the 1000 laid off and countless others not replaced as they quietly moved on, in the last 18 months. It is actually quite shocking. Lots of savings for sure.With the next earnings report, Frisk is just 2 quarters away from completing his stated 3 year re-build; and not much growth to speak of. If no growth from Q1 (really growth, not shuffling numbers),at one point do investors hold Frisk, Plank, Haley (strategy), Eskridge (product), Mirchin (advisor), Fipps (IT) accountable?"
UAA is up 4.94% to 21.46
Charged Pursuit Men's sneaks are the BEST! I have 3 pairs. Highly recommend...
4 upgrades this year alone. Watch for a nice bump to the upside prior to ER next week. I'm predicting 28 by next Friday.
"Weak hands will regret, 30 is coming fast."
I bought three UA hoodies over the weekend. I thought the styling and fabrics were much better than the other brands. Now I am considering the stock.
The $11 - $13 share price was a very rare buying opportunity.
"After taking huge losses all the way from $50 is to $16 range and closing my position, I re entered today with a small position. After reading several analysis, I believe management had learnt their mistakes and are steering the ship in the right direction. This quarter may not be the greatest quarter, but any indication that they are making progress will help. Good luck."
"Well, UAA finally closed above 24. The trick is for the price to hold this for awhile, and then we should crack 30. If we close below 24 in the next week, 21 is back on the table. Holding long and strong!"
"With the revised guidance, the forward PE ratio is now 100. There is no credible plan to reignite growth in the U.S. The only plan is to cut costs.The brand has been cheapened by selling through discounters. The only way to undo that is to reduce sales.How is this stock trading north of $10? Even at that level the PE is over 50."
"$3.5B by EOY. Giving up on contracts, layoffs by end of July/early Aug. Big thing to look out for...back to school campaigns normally hit around July 4th. Realize this is not your normal year, but much of the ordering and production of product is done 6-12 months before it shows up at retail. The BTS time frame is huge for sporting goods/lifestyle brands; if no or little campaign from UAA over next 3 weeks, much bigger issues ahead."
Is this falling because of Plank selling?
I just returned from the Mexican border even the migrants have UA gear on including sneakers. There is no escaping this brand its everywhere even at my local New York Sports Club.
Green
"Stocks are recovering after a bashing over the last couple of days, this is a money making stock and I'm holding this one long. Have a look around when you're in public, there are more people wearing UA than any other brand I know, I wear the product and am all in on this one."
"This is very good, I watch it all the time and it works shorts are covering fast from 15M shares shorts down to 11M this is huge get ready longs, I believe this is old time low"
"just stated on CNBC to stay patient ""this is ripping to the upside"""
"Tough sledding here with Curry brand launch. The Rock has a built in audience that is global and massive (6-7x of what Curry has on IG alone), so I think that is a really tough comparison. Best guess is this settles into a little niche type brand that has a few product capsules to keep SC satisfied, nothing more. They can't waste brand marketing dollars on something so small."
"Sorry if this has already been asked, but why are there 2 ticker symbols for Under Armor? There's UA and then there's UAA. What's up with this?"

$23.90 Tuesday open after ER 
Look at my comments from a couple of days ago. I could sense this was coming. This is only the first of many upgrades to come. The time to buy more is NOW. Going much higher from here.
featured on fast money as a comparison next to Nike and LuLu Lemon. Stock is only 20!
My perception of Nike has changed drastically. It used to be if you had Nike you were cool. This isn't the case anymore. Under Armor has a much more even playing field now and I could see this AMERICAN brand benefiting greatly from Nike's downfall in marketing. UAA long and strong!
"Auburn University negotiating new contract between NKE and UAA. If the Auburn drops UAA, they lose the south, and I am out after holding and buying the past 15 years! ARGHHHH"
Another re-structure. Scrapping the highly touted GM model of the last few years. Another re-start. It is no wonder that this company makes zero actual progress in terms of growth with all the money wasted in these transitions. How does the Board allow the management team to continue?
my only regret is. i did not buy more
"UAA NEWS: """" Cowen & Co Adjusts Under Armour PT to $29 From $33, Maintains Outperform RatingMT NEWSWIRES 11:03 AM ET 10/8/2021 """"Take advantage of UAA 's sell-off and start accumulating the oversold UAA stock today. Vietnam has authorized to reopen all the US manufacturing productions in Vietnam in order to keep all the US manufacturers stay in Vietnam not to go back to China...This will help UAA's , NIKE's, RH's supply chains issues ahead of Thanksgiving and Xmas seasons.This is a $29 stock price per Cohen & Co Research firm and we are seeing it will rebound to $24 near term."
"Maybe next year they should skip the investor update, lol"
Anyone buying @ 22 ?
Philippines first-ever gold medalist sponsored by UA. Go !
The trade volume is low and the price keep raising. Just wow
"I love how when it was $16, all the articles were Debbie Downers. Now at $26, they're all positive. I am long but frankly can't figure out if shares are cheap or expensive. I really just bought UA because I bought 2 Nike shirts that turned out to be low quality and the market cap of UA looked so low in comparison with Nike's market cap."
congrats longsgrts from a Belgium long UAA holder
Why I invested in UA? Schools will re-open soon all over USA and the World - Exercise is a new life style - Sports will fully start again - Quality and designs are great - Summer will spike sales - Best stock price compared with competitors.....I think this company has potential. Bought and holding!!!
what is the difference between UA and UAA??
18.6-19.2 close today possible. IMO
Under Armour is up 6.61% to 20.49
Hope you bought this one before ER. I think a huge upside surprise is coming.
Looks like a breakout! Hope it’s sustained….anybody here?
Nice volume today this is going to breakout into the $20s real soon. WE KNOW
Huge party at Under Armour tonight...
I believe this stock will hit $30 by the end of the month.Why? • GREAT VOL = great stock to trade• AWESOME earnings history • CHEAP with lots of room to growThat’s just my input by looking at the indicators
"maybe UA needs to start selling face masks, buy 'em by the dozen in the colors of your favorite team"
"Are you kidding me? Tanger outlet in NJ line was around the corner , costumers coming out with 2 hands holding bags, the way I see it $40 by the end of the year."
Morgan Stanley raises to buy with 30 target. Now have 4 price target increases which point to the price direction
I just bought a pair of the new HOVR shoes. By far the best pair of athletic training shoes I haveever wore. The Nike shoes I have previously wore do not even come close in terms of quality and comfort. Hope this is just the beginning of great new products coming down the pipeline. Kudos to UA!
Great start to 2018! Baird analyst just Called UA the retail Stock with greatest multi-year upside potential.Happy New Year Longs!
sell weekly OTM calls for months. finally it was assigned at 19.5 last Friday. Will sell 19.5 puts before earning.
ER was great yet the stock barely makes a 1 pt move. Well have to wait to see tomorrow action.
"When brands introduce a completely new product, they often mitigate risk with reduced levels of production and distribution. This also allows the, to say “it sold out in a hour” rather easily. So, we’ll know much more if we ever find out how many units they launched with at retail. Minimal units means they were hedging bets and the long term effect is still tbd."
i see pp buying UA cause is cheap qood quality and cool i see pp in GYMs w UA clothes i see the stores clean w good service and nice pp i like and use theor clothes their prices are accesible to pp w low income.... now tale a look of adidas horrible designs expensive bad quality they lost their past identity... nike is ok and puma is just puma not up not down
Such a wonderful stock. Red day and barely dropping. A snail but moving up.
Trend is up and currently consolidating. Najarian is pumping and this board is quiet. Seems like a buy here.
"Entered the June 1st exp 16.5 calls @ $1.25 , feels like a solid entry , asset was at $17.30 . Only paying about $50 in premium. Will keep my stop loss around $.85 , any other active option traders with an opinion?"
The Rocks UA collection is dropping this Thursday. Could that give the stock a boost?
what's the difference btw UA and UAA? Which one should I choose?
nsip what happened to your $11 prediction?
UA is sitting on a support right now. Any lower we may get into the 16's
WHEN IS EARNINGS??
$12 will be gift !
Great price point to add to your position as we rebound today.
I bought 10000 Shares back in October 2020 I plan on holding for one year or more￼
"UAA should have beautiful ER tomorrow.But I prefer the lower price today, so it has power to raise 10-15%+If today it rise nearly 10%, I prefer to sell.This is not a good news rise too fast before ER."
$15 is good entry?
"Curious why UAA pays Tom Brady, Jordan Speith, and all those other athletes so much, yet I never ever see an advertisement featuring them. Seems like a tremendous waste of money to me."
Under Armour has flown under the radar for years. Gear is looking good.. more stylish than ever. Rebuilt structure to become more profitable. Making lots of smart decisions. Much stronger and smarter now than pre-pandemic. 40+ stock in 2022.
Looks like $19 tomorrow
I have seen more people wearing UA than other competitors in the last six months. That’s a bullish sign to me.
Hope the CEO doesn't plan another investors conference for a LONG TIME.
"UA / UAA down on lower than avg volume with indicators showing oversold. Showing several support levels in mid $17s, currently in accumulating phase/period and UA will go back up to $18s and $19s and maybe reaching $20s within next 30 days. Take my money, Im in "
"Big week next week for UA. Will be interesting to see the result of all the cutting re profitability. I would like to hear how they plan on growing again in any real way. Is low single digit profitable growth good enough for the growth investor? Or has the investor changed with the downturn? No idea. I am surprised they got out of the NFL with all the stud athletes they have. Why have Tom Brady, Chase Young and DK Metcalf if the company doesn't want to be in football?"
The UA outlet store was packed on a Sunday morning! Seems encouraging.
"LULU came out like a monster last night. I predict UA momentum to be stronger, but a tie would be just fine. Below 20 is a bargain if there ever was one."
over $25 td
very nice!!
Thanks NKE! 
"Under Armour, Inc.'s new CEO hard at work in the executive suite."
Earnings report will be massive!!
"Curry Brand launch is a long time coming between UA and Curry camp. It is a make good for when Curry almost asked out of the contract a few years back and Frisk/Plank had to offer this up to keep him. Having said that, a couple of thoughts after reading the release...interesting time to launch (discount season/volume rich for retail) a an offshoot brand that will take marketing dollars away from promoting broader UA brand until (or if) Curry brand can stand up on it's own and fund itself (biggest risk to UA). Second, I question whether a brand can have a ""cause"" as well as be labeled ""premium""; it seems counter-intuitive. Last, Curry is 31 and has only a few years at most to really drive it."
Smell what the rock is cooking 20s here we come
going steady...love this company :)
"When the dust settles, think about being able to say you bought Under Armour stock under $10.Stores are opening, UA is a great product, I am excited for us.52 Week Range 6.37 - 24.55"
I think we will reach $28 this week. This stock is stable... For now. Pay attention to the indicators guys
$24.00We will close
Anyone consider buying?
"Nice to finally see an up day. UAA has been not getting any love recently, but I feel things will change with our next earnings release."
"Steve Grasso on Fast Money tonight just stated ""Under Armour is going to bounce"""
I would expect $75 EOY 2018
Stock is still stable . Get in before it reaches the top swing traderssss!
can anyone kindly explain to me the differences between UAA and UA as well as which one you'd recommend and why?
"My two sons and i visited our local UA outlet on Memorial Day around 11:30am. Store was super busy. Five cashiers ringing, with a line of 10+ people."
Under armour upgraded to overwight by Wells fargo price target $23.
Under Armour is up 4.91% to 18.38
"I found a great article on new UAA running shoes, but yahoo of course won’t let me post the link. The new shoe is the Phantom 2 Intelliknit, and the website is Manofmany out of Australia. I hope this shoe sells well."

Sticking with short term of 11.00 for UA / 12.25 for UAA. Very optimistic to think higher than that for now.
UAA should be $40 this time next year mark my words
Is the earnings call today or tomorrow?
$HOOD $UAA $AMD to the MOON!!!!
"Need UAA to buy LULU…Get sports, women’s athleisure and Mirror product…need to make a splash to get revs higher as shoes and shirts are commodities"
"Breaking news on 9-27-2021: """"Nike (NIKE), Under Armour (UAA) and RH (RH) shares were mixed Monday as Vietnam announced it was easing its strict Covid-19 restrictions, allowing factories to reopen.Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said Saturday that business can resume production starting this week in an effort to help boost the economy amid talk that retailers could shift factories and supply chains out of Vietnam."""" Vietnam will solve the inventory problem for UAA ahead of holidays....Buy UAA at this deep value.... Should rise as high as 24 by Thanksgiving...."
here comes 17.8 -
The question is....Has UA virtue signaled enough to finally get positive media coverage?
"Fell asleep at the wheel. If this company was ran right the last few years they would be competing much closer with Nike and there would be no such thing as Lululemon, or at least in its current market share form. With that I think they are on the up, possibly slow and steady, but certainly up. Too much value in the name and quality to not be a competent, profitable company. Disclaimer: Currently have 2000 shares @ 9.77."
My buddy in retail M&A told me Nike taking a hard look at UA especially with where market cap is right now! 
"UA has been focusing on different demographics and markets for a few years now. The guidance is not a fluke and there will be continued upside for many quarters to come. Investors are a little nervous about UA but they will show up now, big time."
Went to Universal Parks. Place was wall to wall UA gear and shoes.
I was very optimistic on this stock and bought 40 call options. The only thing that worries me is that Cramer said it will go back to 30. Every time this guy made a comment on a stock i have it was bad news.
5% a day to $30
Y’all missed your chance to buy the stock at a cheap cost. Follow my account and I’ll put out my opinions about stocks but you have to do your own research ! #speakingfromtheheart
WoW you see how Sketchers is going higher on great earnings UA is next.$25 on Deck WE KNOW
Elections have consequences. Wake up sheeple.
Don't sell in the beginning.Mostly the peak is higher than the opening price.$23+
"you are absolutely right,this stock at $21 is a fluke.in my opinion it is going down to $15 - 16 until something drastic happens to their ""dull"" line of product dont matter how technologically advanced the product is."
"Hey Mike, Heres an article for you!"
UA is positioned to come back strong. Be patient.
Think about it like this...if you had 10B and you could buy ua outright...or you buy 10B on 10 year bonds at 3.10....over the next 10 years...what do you think is actually going to return 3B?
"Feb 08, 2021Tom Brady is one of the leading spokespeople for Under Armour, and he's not in the business of giving free PR to the brand's competitors.Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat out Patrick Mahomes' Kansas City Chiefs to win Super Bowl LV Sunday night. As the 43-year-old quarterback hoisted the Vince Lombardi Trophy for the seventh time in his esteemed career, he caught a glimpse of himself on the stadium's video board.Tom Brady is an Under Armour ambassador, and he's fiercely loyal to the sports apparel brand.After he won Super Bowl LV, the Buccaneers QB acted shrewdly to snub one of Under Armour's competitors.Brady noticed a Nike swoosh visible on his undershirt, so he pulled up his championship T-shirt to cover it up."
It’s a beautiful day to be long UAA!
"Lots of new workout gear will be sold by UA to go with the footwear. Numbers will be record levels for UA $25 IS COMING WE KNOW02:16 PM EDT, 04/06/2021 (MT Newswires) -- Athletic footwear sales are continuing to grow at the fastest clip in the industry, with March sales up a ""historic"" 40% to 50% year over year, UBS said in a note April 6.The US fiscal stimulus is likely responsible for two-thirds of the growth spurt with reopening of the economy from coronavirus restrictions accounting for another 25%. Sales for 2021 should grow 10% over 2019 with the back-to-school period providing a boost.The brokerage's report is based on a call it hosted with the CEO of a privately held footwear retailer.""The expert's conclusion is fiscal stimulus is boosting all parts of the business and thus reopening probably only explains a portion of the acceleration,"" UBS said. ""As reopening becomes a bigger factor, dress category and store-level sales will rebound more sharply, while [e-commerce] and athletic sales growth rates normalize.""UBS raised full-year 2021/22 EPS estimates for most footwear stocks in its coverage universe: Boot Barn(BOOT) , Columbia Sportswear(COLM) , Crocs(CROX) , Designer Brands(DBI) , Deckers Outdoor(DECK) , Foot Locker(FL) , Steven Madden (SHOO), Skechers (SKX), Under Armour(UAA) , V.F. Corp(VFC) , and Wolverine World Wide(WWW) . Price targets, however, were not lifted as full-year 2023 EPS estimates were not updated."
I keep this stock only as reminder of my mistake in buying it a few years ago.
The stock price has been awful the past few months but showing some small strength lately. It has lost its way but still has some branding power with Tom Brady and others. I am staying with it. It would be a good fit for LULU and at a cheap price.
SEC should start another investigation into stock manipulation...
Went skiing this weekend and just about every other kid was wearing an under armour sweater.
UA is going to be the turn-around story of the year I believe. Stock is extremely undervalued.
What a week
We couldn’t hold 25. Next stop 20-21. Hope we finally can break this pattern with the next earnings call.
"I used to be a Nike stockholder fanboy and shifted to UA a year ago. I cannot complain, great results. Company is on the right track. Future is bright"
"Lucky for UAA, Nike is doing ad campaign with Colin Krapernick. This will hurt Nike sales for sure."
"Gentlemen... I'm liking the pop today, but trying to understand what I'm not seeing. reason for pop other than we've been down with market lately?"
"This is a critical moment for UAA.I believe it could go to $30 as Morgen.But normally, the stock would take a break after ER growth.10-15% dropping is common.I sold and wait the buying point.This is risky to hold."
"Hi , I interested in purchasing some under armor stock. What is the correct ticket ? UAA or UA? Please help . Thank you"
$88 Or $99 any day
"23-24 seems to consistently be the resistance range for UAA. If we can break and hold above 24, next stop is 30. Staying long and strong."
"Under Armour and LuLu have about the same revenue, $4.5B. Yet LuLu has about 9 times the market cap of UA. Nothing against LuLu, but UA stock seems undervalued."
"Buy if you can , UA will not fall today , Reverse current"
Thank you everyone who purchased today. I made £2000 on an intraday swing off the lows. I think it will trend upwards for fair few days now considering the selling ahead of ER. But for me onto the next one.
"Lulu trailing PE 70 UAA PE is 39 It’s unfair , based on the future earning the price should be at $70 … Who is responsible party manipulating UAA?totally un except-able. SEC should open investigation"
Why are there two ticker symbols for the same company? UAA and UA?Confused..
UAA is up 5.33% to 23.91
All time high's a we can't fetch a dime
"I’m a small time trader with a few million spread out in the market. Best of breed in some sectors is my strategy for years and it’s worked. After seeing the product line at a huge UA outlet in Lake George NY and how packed it was I purchased 5,000 shares last week.I’m cool holding this is going to $30 millennials love UA and sports are starting up again these analysts are downplaying the potential of UA and its earnings."
"The 30s by the end of the month, like if you are agreed"
What are you people doing? Do you realize that UA stock is worthless? It us class c stock with no voting rights and no value if the company goes under. The company switched the letters so UAA is now the valuable company stock.
"We’re need to hold this level longer to form a new base, otherwise we’re going back to 20."
"Love the risk/reward here. #$%$ and Nike both delivering blowout quarters bodes well. With a market cap at 4.6B vs. NKE at 200B you have to think this is getting attractive from an M&A perspective. Obviously there is a management issue but they still have the best products and no one is buying ""work"" clothes anymore. I recently purchased some items off their website and their new $80 T shirts (!!) are sold out. Loaded up on some call options for the quarter."
"How? I am not a share holder now but watching UA. Every time I put On FS/ESPN I can see UA products, and marketing logos. How does this stock not perform UP?"
UA clothing is in high demand in the Philippines thanks to our first gold medalist! Go PH and UA!
"I have recently started a long position here. All my son's pre-teen friends wear under armor and I think this represents a good opportunity when things get back to ""normal."" Nobody has been buying their kids clothes because everyone is home there is no school. I suspect when that changes there will be a significant positive change in sales. Willing to be proven wrong here, and I hear the concerns about management, but at the end of the day this is a very popular brand with younger generations which I think bodes well for the future. Also no sports is a major drag. I'm comfortable building a long term position around current levels. Good luck to all and my apologies to the currently suffering longs."
"Earnings and guidance were awesome, the markets reaction not so much. Still holding long and strong!"
All it will take for this stock to be trading in the $35-$50 range is one upgrade and the next earnings beat in August. This thing will be flying!!
Good buy at todays price? will hold for year or 2.
I guess it could run higher over inextricably few days. I’ll splash around

"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"
"Now would be the perfect time for management to send a press release indicating their supply issues are not to the magnitude of Nike's, and their predicted earnings are unchanged. By not doing anything, investors are worried about production, and the stock is dropping like a rock. Seems like the tool Kevin Plank is still calling the shots."
Pete Najarian on Halftime! Bullish Call; someone just bought 6400 of the Oct 20 strike expiring on 10/8
Expect good volume daily and green daily. Enjoy it
The new Under Armour Hovr shoes launching February 1st is really nice + it automatically tracks your run with built in sensors / visit their website to take a look!!
"Put all this together:1. Last Friday, went up with very low volume - not a good sign.2. Now stands way above 50-day and 200-day MA - last time it happened, it went down by 35%.3. 2019 EPS estimates reduced from 35 cents/share to zero cents/share in last 90 days.4. 2010 EPS estimates down from 53 cents/share to 52 cents/share with FPE of 45 which is too high.UA should be at around $19 within the next two weeks."
so what's spiking the price today?
imo i think they will have a great earning report.
Like to buy Uaa in my rrif account any advice from long time investors I am 71
I love the brand but not the stock. Should I get in now or wait?
maybe $45
"I’m not sure adding another person to the board of directors is a good thing. The board is already a bloated overpaid mess. Sound like the signing of David Gibbs is nothing but a “I’ll scratch your back, and you scratch mine” good old boys thing."
UA back to school clothing has soared this year. That’s all I see anymore. Had to buy some stock…
"If i were MMs, i move it to $30 today ..."
The more revenue they bring in the more they lose?
Better to be long the UA [class c shares] record short interest -13.79% of float UAA [class A shares] have a -7.59% short interest and the spread between both shares classes is over 16.25% a record. Swap your UAA shares for UA.
Every day is red
Thats an easy 26 this week
I cannot remember 2 green days in a row. Really . The dip buying did not help.
Trending ER beats for the last 4 quarters and still down 50%+ from all time highs while many other competitors such as LULU and NIKE enjoy rocketing stock prices. Will be a $50 stock in the next year
They have gone to the bottom already and are turned around earnings will beat estimates and they will have done even better then last quarter I hold my shares I see $34 a share in 2 years or less
