can anyone kindly explain to me the differences between UAA and UA as well as which one you'd recommend and why?
"UA / UAA down on lower than avg volume with indicators showing oversold. Showing several support levels in mid $17s, currently in accumulating phase/period and UA will go back up to $18s and $19s and maybe reaching $20s within next 30 days. Take my money, Im in "
"This is very good, I watch it all the time and it works shorts are covering fast from 15M shares shorts down to 11M this is huge get ready longs, I believe this is old time low"
In Boston UA is everywhere shirts shorts hats shoes I travel to Indiana the same it’s all over all the upgrades last 6 months yet nothing happens what is going on ? What’s wrong?
I heard about UAA the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Do I want to buy UAA or UA?
"Under Armour and LuLu have about the same revenue, $4.5B. Yet LuLu has about 9 times the market cap of UA. Nothing against LuLu, but UA stock seems undervalued."
"UAA NEWS: """" Cowen & Co Adjusts Under Armour PT to $29 From $33, Maintains Outperform RatingMT NEWSWIRES 11:03 AM ET 10/8/2021 """"Take advantage of UAA 's sell-off and start accumulating the oversold UAA stock today. Vietnam has authorized to reopen all the US manufacturing productions in Vietnam in order to keep all the US manufacturers stay in Vietnam not to go back to China...This will help UAA's , NIKE's, RH's supply chains issues ahead of Thanksgiving and Xmas seasons.This is a $29 stock price per Cohen & Co Research firm and we are seeing it will rebound to $24 near term."
"Auburn University negotiating new contract between NKE and UAA. If the Auburn drops UAA, they lose the south, and I am out after holding and buying the past 15 years! ARGHHHH"
What are you people doing? Do you realize that UA stock is worthless? It us class c stock with no voting rights and no value if the company goes under. The company switched the letters so UAA is now the valuable company stock.
"Here’s a challenge. Look around you at the next event you go to, take inventory of the brands you see. Under Armour is dominating right now, every kid is wearing it. Nike still can’t make a good shirt, these guys are ready to blast off. "
Great price point to add to your position as we rebound today.
"LULU came out like a monster last night. I predict UA momentum to be stronger, but a tie would be just fine. Below 20 is a bargain if there ever was one."
what is the difference between UA and UAA??
"How? I am not a share holder now but watching UA. Every time I put On FS/ESPN I can see UA products, and marketing logos. How does this stock not perform UP?"
"Now would be the perfect time for management to send a press release indicating their supply issues are not to the magnitude of Nike's, and their predicted earnings are unchanged. By not doing anything, investors are worried about production, and the stock is dropping like a rock. Seems like the tool Kevin Plank is still calling the shots."
"Breaking news on 9-27-2021: """"Nike (NIKE), Under Armour (UAA) and RH (RH) shares were mixed Monday as Vietnam announced it was easing its strict Covid-19 restrictions, allowing factories to reopen.Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said Saturday that business can resume production starting this week in an effort to help boost the economy amid talk that retailers could shift factories and supply chains out of Vietnam."""" Vietnam will solve the inventory problem for UAA ahead of holidays....Buy UAA at this deep value.... Should rise as high as 24 by Thanksgiving...."
Good buy at todays price? will hold for year or 2.
UAA should be $40 this time next year mark my words
featured on fast money as a comparison next to Nike and LuLu Lemon. Stock is only 20!
