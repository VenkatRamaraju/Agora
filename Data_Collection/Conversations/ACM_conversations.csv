All AECOM management has cared about since Magic Mike took over was its stock price. They stripped the URS parts of every penny and drove away half the DCS business while shipping jobs to India and Mexico. Stock price has done nothing.
15600 contracts bought Dec. $45 calls somebody went real long .
Read the transcript from the latest earning call. Jamie Lyn Cook of Crédit Suisse asks management why they are targeting restructuring of DCS (most profitable unit) instead of MS or CS. Management can't answer the question. Makes one question the strategy of this leadership.

"Donnie reversed the course in steel tariffs (Europe & China soon), in car tariffs delayed against Europe, cancelled infrastructure, China trade + Huawei. Look at the stock charts of oil, steel, GM & Ford, infrastructure, and tech/semi sector; they were erratic up and down following Donnie & cronies good and bad news/interviews/tweets.$AKS $X $GM $F $ACM $FLR $MU $NVDA just to name a few.Happy trading!"
Global engineering firm Aecom (NYSE:ACM) plays a big role in redevelopment following hurricanes. ... Just saying!
ACM near $50bl in backlog strong balance sheet . That 15k contracts on Dec $45 calls very positive .
Worst thing about investing in this stock is that people confuse the ticker with AMC
Forward guidance s/b good with infrastructure bill headwind.Great buy here!
"ACM one of the major co.’s involved w. Rebuilding buildings roads after damage caused by earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters. Seem like a no brainer as IDA strikes."
Big mistake selling Mgmt services. Huge revenue and higher margins -> more profits. I believe MS was the most profitable part of ACM. Seems shortsighted.
AECOM awarded Army contract worth 220 million but being protested by competitors. Just a delay
Anyone have a view why AECOM is trending downwards since beginning of June?
Strong Balance Sheet Great Workers!!!!! 40$ after earnings......
HOW MANY LIKES ON THIS COMMENT TO SHOW STRONG WE ARE $ACM $BB $GME $NOK $NAKD $SNDL
"Central banks have very little monetary fire power after the financial crisis. Great probability they will use Keynesian for fiscal stimulation of the economy during this health crisis. That would involve infrastructure spending on public works such as water, sewer pipes, roads and bridges. AECOM should do very well!"
BUY AND HOLD$SRNE $GME $ACM
ACM is not AMC pls. AECOM is a great engineering company with big focus on Infrastructure!
Huge call buying today in this name. I’m in for the ride. See Dec $45’s
