"In Barron's November 27, 2017, Rebuilding Hopes in Infrastructure Stocks. ""This could be massive for this industry,"" says Philip Ng, who covers building-products and construction-materials stocks for Jefferies.*LOOKS like time to up your FRTA long positions...* Under the radar FRTA the #1 water, drainage, products company in the United States...Hal thinks an infrastructure bill can pass Congress in some form.""Trump is a builder at heart, and he knows this topic,"" she says. ""I think this bill will at least get out of the gate.""Article mentions: $CAT $MLM $ACM $GVA $EXP $USCRDems & Rep all want good roads, etc."
A decent under the radar pick here.. and a definite benefactor of any Infrastructure bill. Great quarter and solid guidance. Got my eye on this one.

"Transit funding will be cut significantly with the new administration, as expressed. AECOM generates significant revenues from this market. In all major cities, where AECOM operates, transit is by large the biggest market (NYC, Philly, Baltimore, D.C., Miami, Orlando, LA, etc. etc.) This is not replaceable by bridges and roads.Check your facts and look into the sources of transportation revenue. I did and I am short."

ACM is one of the best infrastructure plays. This is a relatively cheap stock that is going to explode once funding is allocated for infrastructure. A federal gas tax hike announcement to help fund these plans is coming. I’m long ACM.
"Donnie reversed the course in steel tariffs (Europe & China soon), in car tariffs delayed against Europe, cancelled infrastructure, China trade + Huawei. Look at the stock charts of oil, steel, GM & Ford, infrastructure, and tech/semi sector; they were erratic up and down following Donnie & cronies good and bad news/interviews/tweets.$AKS $X $GM $F $ACM $FLR $MU $NVDA just to name a few.Happy trading!"

Big mistake selling Mgmt services. Huge revenue and higher margins -> more profits. I believe MS was the most profitable part of ACM. Seems shortsighted.

Terrible new leadership in CEO/CFO roles.
All AECOM management has cared about since Magic Mike took over was its stock price. They stripped the URS parts of every penny and drove away half the DCS business while shipping jobs to India and Mexico. Stock price has done nothing.
The need for smaller and mid size cities utility expansion is great with the exodus to the burbs and more rural areas underway . Aecom taking over middle TN .

Yahoo - would you please remove Awesome Stock comments. This is harassment at its finest!!
Read the transcript from the latest earning call. Jamie Lyn Cook of Crédit Suisse asks management why they are targeting restructuring of DCS (most profitable unit) instead of MS or CS. Management can't answer the question. Makes one question the strategy of this leadership.

"Central banks have very little monetary fire power after the financial crisis. Great probability they will use Keynesian for fiscal stimulation of the economy during this health crisis. That would involve infrastructure spending on public works such as water, sewer pipes, roads and bridges. AECOM should do very well!"

"Here is the shorts coming to the infrastructure stocks like $ACM $FLR $JEC . Donnie & his cronies always find ways to pump and excuses to sack the market. $$$Trillion infrastructure plan is abruptly dropped.Tweets on gas price, amazon, trade talks pump/dumb affecting the semi sector, steel tariff against Mexico & Canada is withdraw, Europe car tariff is hold off. These swing behaviours have affected the market up & down and only insiders have early warning of these behavious.Happy trading."
