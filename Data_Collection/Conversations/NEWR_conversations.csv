"TWLO did great , we will do great"
all over after hours
"Keep an eye on the insider selling in the last 30 days, plus the heavy automatic insider selling in the last 6 months. Something does not add up."
"Really bad news today....NEW YORK, Sept. 19, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky announces it has commenced an investigation of New Relic, Inc. (“New Relic” of “the Company”) (NEWR) concerning possible violations of federal securities laws."
Stock is beat up and oversold. Daily macd about to cross to the upside...recovering.
NEWR reached a new All Time High at 62.81
NEWR is up 5.16% to $88.99
Buy TWLO TWLO is currently accumulatedBreak out soon
NEWR reached a new All Time High at 100.16
"Reported today on CNBC... Take Two and Activision damage to earnings and revenues has been both Fortnite and the move to online gaming. Both strengths of NEWR. Subscription gaming is the future, like Netflix with games, and NEWR has a very strong position exploiting that with their Fortnite success."
"WOW, I am way ahead! I bought when it was a bit over $31.00"
"Now flat AH , we need a strong conference call"
"Take advantage of low price due to market pull down...stocks like NEWR,CRM,ASML are blessings to buy now and thank later"

BAD news NEWR is falling apart....Take advantage and sell in this share Manipulation...CTO and CRO are left...someone pushing higher to sell or short sellThis will come down to $30 in soon...
Good comeback today
Encouraging to see it holding up in a bad tape
"I get it valuation doesn't matter now, but for a $35B company they really dont make that much. One of their competitors $NEWR has a $4B market cap on almost the same revenue but they got absolutely crushed after earnings. Anyway, crazy market."
"Down to 50+ by the end of this week, which will trigger some stop loss further panic selling. I'd say good buying opportunity at around 55 but could go down even further."
NEWR up tomorrow
"I just sold a few Sept puts with a strike price of $50 for $2. That seems like a great value entry point if they are executed. This is a huge space to make money in even with competitors (which is what affected them, at least in part this quarter). The company will go through some growing pains but I think they are one of the top dogs here and should remain so."
DROPBOX posts record earnings today after close. Watch and learn
will announce earnings in the first week of November...... chill !!!!!!
NEWR reached a new All Time High at 92.76
NEWR reached a new All Time High at 103.49
When are earnings coming out?
NEWR is down 5.34% to $82.49
MASSIVE INCREASE !! AMAZING EARNINGS !!
No growth...forward EP 58X too expensive stock...
Solid beat. Great company. This is a great buying opportunity.
"Technical trading pattern seems to work well here. Bullish crossover in MACD and Stochastic oscillator, according to daily chart at foxchart."
any thoughts for the upcoming reports?
Wow what is wrong with this thing? Wanted to buy but just keeps dropping on up days. Anyone know why?
Running hard into the quarter. Need a clean beat and raise
I think getting a downgrade from GS is a blessing and the upgrade is the opposite
NEWR is up 5.36% to $88.31
NEWR reached a new All Time High at 73.43
Raymond James still bullish
This is the bottom. Holding my shares for a nice recovery
NEWR is down -4.91% to 100.32
"great company, stay long. You will be rewarded"
Really really tired of holding these shares.
"That is what is sad about these stocks trading at 200X EPS....its about the beat and not the actual economic profits generated. these overpriced stocks will get slammed soon after the feds keep raising rates. NEWR at 80 end of December, then 50 end of Q12019. Sad when Non-GAAP EPS is the metric."
will beat expectations. ...... but not enough
"this has no downward catalyst at this time, if I was short I would bail right now"
We have 5 million outstanding shorts out there guaranteed to buy when we have only 1 million avg daily trading volume. Tomorrow we can rip thru $70. No problemo.
Am long with 35 entry. Expecting return to 112 in 12 months
"have traded in and out of NEWR and DATA for the last 6 months. They used to trade in tandem - almost to the penny some days. Been out of both for the last month and have now noticed the complete disconnect - I have also noticed that while DATA still has 99% institutional ownership, my Schwab account shows NEWR has gone from around 83% institutional ownership to 76%. Anyone know why?"
I believe Bottom is at 50 and the upside potential is tremendous. I Will add another 30k below 60 if it ever gets that low
"rough morning for me, just sold off my shares and moved it into HEXO and CRON and made almost all my money back!"
7 times revenues....serious asset bubble
Give it time it’s already rebounding way oversold . People buy and selling at discount prices. The Longs today will be rewarded . Be patient and always average down in this situation. There were stellar earnings.
NEWR reached a new All Time High at 85.00
Down 2.5% for no reason. Still long here...
JP Morgan stopped all the momentum on the stock. It is still cloud king..... buy this winner
Good results stock is down.
Check out TWLO Rumor TWLO buyout
This is going to fly real soon
Starting to look like an old relic.
sell .... sell....i did... 5400 shares....good luck...
This stock is extremely oversold. The market made an elephant out of a fly: a tiny “miss” in sales. Check out analysts’ responses to the latest ER.To cut a long story short: this stock is going to $75-80 within days.
NEWR is up 5.30% to 109.69
This stock is down 50% since I invested some money. Time to give up and take my loss.
How is it possible the CEO can sell stock 2 days before an earnings release??? Thought there was always a 30 day period which restricts buys or sales Managment
Checkout TWLO same technology as NEWR and this stock is on the move
its vegas.... gambling..... should you or shouldn't u.... is the question.... chuckle....read ...and decide before 4 pm
Zacks calls this a strong sell. Is anything zacks says accurate???? Lol
$ 65 by Friday
Already up 3% in the pre market. Is there some particular news out there causing the early jump?
SEEKING ALPHA THINKS LOW 50'S HERE...I DON'T KNOW NLNK NBRV DTIL GOSS PRVB PSNL REALLY HOT
Added another 300 shares thanks for cheapies
This stock hopefully will rebound tomorrow. The news should not have caused this overreaction.
Solid beat  I ain’t selling my shares!
What is going on?
NEWR reached a new All Time High at 67.35
"Way oversold, will reach $58 very quick"
NEWR reached a new All Time High at 113.07
I’m sending everyone on this board a free tin foil hat
This looks like a major overreaction. Time to buy
Earnings seem OK
Looks like she's getting ready to tank hard. No support at all on a major market up-day. Ominous down-sloping head & shoulders on the chart. Couldn't break above 50-dma during recent rally. Huge gap in the chart. It will be a miracle if this thing gets out of bed. Let's see what happens.
"When a company stock drops 30% or more overnight, it can take several months or years to recover. It took FB a year to recover from Aug 2018 drop. This could still head lower before finding a bottom. There is no rush to buy right now."
"Last trade of the day for me was to buy NEWR AT $84+. Duhhhh, lol. I’ll take the pain."
NEWR reached a new All Time High at 96.77
numbers seem great no?
Besides the lower guidance NEWR also announced the CTO and chief revenue officer both resigned. Is this bad news or expected?
Buy TWLO Rumor buyout is comingSame technology with NEWR
NEWR is down 7.87% to $70.60
How does it beat earnings and revenue and still tank 20%???
thanks for the panic. jumping in at $58. downgraded price target by analysts is still almost a double st $99.
Price retraced the to breakout candle of 2017... next support could be 38.... if 59 doesn't hold....
"What happened folks. I saw it trading above $110 and I think I even saw a $113, then boom, it’s back down to $106. What in the world caused the reversal? Best I can tell they raised bottom in Guidance 38% and top-end by 25% versus what they said in November. What more can you ask for?"
You’re telling me they’re projecting 12-13% revenue growth and people are paying >6x revenue w/ zero margin? Makes no sense.
Quiet before the storm ?
Cramer was bearish on New Relic during the lightning round last night. Makes me more confident being long and will add during any dips.
Cloud computing NEWR is on a fast track to triple digits. I’m glad to be a part of it.
See how fast it recovered ? Holding my half a million here and add some. Thanks for shares at 62
"Added today at $88 , not sure it could go much lower ..."
TWLO is on the move right now
"Great products but I am apprehensive of earnings… conversely, how much more can it drop? hmm"
"Risk from pandemic for this quarter and following quarters results is indeed big issue as uncertainity in general is nightmare for investors. But how about 1 year later? I am optimistic that by then pandemic effect will be much lower, if not completely gone. The pullback is overreaction imo. Good people, good market and good product. This is why I trust New Relic will do fine in future. So far they had very good performance imo."
NEWR is up 8.03% to $92.98
This is a $120 stock by feb. mark my words
https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3139463&headline=NEWR-New-Relic-downgraded-to-Neutral-from-Overweight-at-JPMorgan
It is up ah maybe speculation of buy offer 30% premium?
CEO sold a bunch of his shares
This thing is a falling knife right now. Waiting for it to stabilize before cost averaging down.
Looks terrible technically!
Done nothing in last year. Gains are mostly made in this. Compare TEAM and Veeva etc.
Check out the acceleration in RPO (see the presentation). Very impressive.
NEWR is down 4.99% to $81.00
BS beat top n bottom n dropped 10 pts. What are people looking at?
Going to add some around here ...Numbers will be good this Q again !
"Beat top and bottom line, raised guidance. This will slowly move up to $115-$120 before next earnings provided market is in a good mood."
NEWR reached a new All Time High at 107.41
ISNS looks interesting in autonomous space.
Big EPS miss + Big insider sale by CEO just before earnings = bad news.NEWR going down to below $55 soon.Time to short
NEWR is down -5.00% to 100.35
The trading volume shows whoever sold the day before came back in yesterday.
"where do you go to get an analyst's job? might as well be a weatherman. at least they give you a disclaimer accuracy percentage. NEWR missed big while some ""in the know"" were promoting blue sky."
Insiders were selling as late as yesterday! They knew of course. Selling through June July and CEO sold 16K shares yesterday @$85.23
Time to buy... Today's down is a chance
Going to see 75 this week
we'll see it over 71 tomorrow.
heard a rumor that SalesForce was buying lots of NEWR stock...for future acquisition?
Spce hrtx fprx ftsv alec. Launches due. Fda approvals. Price target upgrades.
Dang it!! Pulled the trigger n it dropped lower.
"In terms of PS, a competitor in the same industry (ESTC) is trading at 3x NEWR's multiple - currently at 7 (relatively low for software). Also, Needham has a target of $82 for the stock. We'll see what happens after earnings."
Old Relic
"These analysts guidance are ridiculous. NEWR reduced guidance by $4M to $144M. Comparing this to same quarter last year, this is a 26% YoY revenue growth. It's not as if NEWR is losing market share or slowing down. The company is still growing. I'll be looking to buy during the panic tomorrow or the next few days."
New Relic is down 23.54% to 56.20
Kaboom!!!! Beat both top and bottom line. 20c vs 12c expected. $115M revs vs $112M. Stock is set up for a strong year end Santa Claus rally. $110s + for sure.
New Relic is up 11.46% to 64.96
ARR Growth Y0Y and Net Expansion rate are the keys to successful SaaS model. When those are both down in a quarter...you're going to get hammered.
NEWR reached a new All Time High at 64.22
"Go NEWR , go ..."
It will be up tomorrow
$ 80 could be a good entry point or for me a way to average down ..
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4331450-new-relic-tough-to-own?source=all_articles_title
NEWR is up 4.92% to 62.22
New Relic is down 15.15% to 55.27
"Been dipping my toe in and getting burned on every dip. Down 32% today seems a bit extreme, no?"
next week 30+
NEWR is up 5.65% to 95.22
"NEWR has gone from bad to worse. I knew I should have sold all of it when Jim Cramer was saying buy. I sold half yesterday, at a small gain, the rest is now is bleeding red."
NEWR reached a new All Time High at 105.35
NEWR reached a new All Time High at 78.63
I have a stop loss at $39.96 should I sell now or wait until it reaches 30+
It will fall to 51
shorted at 68
I covered at 100
Any idea what's the er is? I can guess that they aren't good based on the ah drop
I think it should recover some maybe 60$ or 62 $ .Disaster nevertheless.
Repeating the pattern of other earnings. 10-20% drop.
This is really a nice product for server side monitoring. I have personally used the service and impressed by their product. I believe they should be bought out by one of the cloud vendor. I wish Google but then and integrate it as part of their Google Cloud.
New Relic is up 13.73% to 77.70
Rebound in place
nice !
"Paid services says buy below $60 and sit on it. Hard to pull the trigger, seems no bottom to it. yet there has to be one"
"Wow! At this price NEWR, is pretty tempting. The conference call was a disaster, it really was, other open source, cloud solutions, we're kicking its butt, couldn't hire enough employees, customers wanted different applications , but when others are running for the exits i was listening for opportunities, and there were some, first the CEO is brilliant, and second, they are in the process of rolling out a new more robust, platform which could be a huge hit, thirdly the market they compete in, is huge. Going to wait for this to find a bottom and take a flyer"
Get ready to rumble or tumble.
Goldman was buying their own downgrade
My half a million here should break even soon
I am all in at $53.64 2500 shares
Takeover target?
metric value of insider selling = 0mt
My 1500 shares @ $57.01 looking much better.
"What a recovery. Awesome, jumped in at 51"
"I should have cut my losses at $60. Too late to sell now in the $40's. This will take a year to back to the 60s, 2 years to the 80s if they execute well."
"The stock is oversold and very unlikely to fall below it's strong support around $51.Hence, I am SELLING $50 PUT (Aug 21) options. Very likely they will expire worthless on Aug 21st and I'll pocket the premium. Worst case, the stock falls below $50 by Aug Aug 21st and my option gets called is I will have to buy it at $50, which I'll don't mind buying at that price since it offers a better entry price."
$$$$ time easy 114....ride this until nov.5 day before earnings announcement.... sell or be brave.... will it exceed earnings..? or drop? but until then let's ROCK THIS BITC#... chuckle ..
NEWR is up 10.22% to 85.00
Nice recovery. Back above 70 soon
Stock is constantly pumped by Cramer. Be careful buying here as stock has gotten way too expensive here. One bad report and this will go down through the elevator.
Likely value here at $57 for investors with more than 60 day horixon
sold all at 113.2 I was tired of bagholding this; im free at last right on the good spot.
Clean beat and raise. Revs 124M v 120K expected... eps .19 v .12 expected... and they raised guidance.
Plenty of insiders buy at wrong prices !!!! This dog is a buy around $47.....given low growth rate and intense competition from datadog.....why buy at this inflated multiple ????
Guys what do you expect. The price had gone up 20% in the last month. The expectations were sky high coming in. Just buy the dip and be happy fools
NEWR has nearly dropped 50% from al time high. The seller volume today is more than the sell volume during the post earring crash.
GAAP loss ($0.50) - $4 billion market cap - something is very very wrong here.
Late 2017 price... you have got to be kidding me. Is this going the same as NTNX and ZUO did?
"I hear that they are getting destroyed by Datadog and Splunk and customer churn at Large Accounts like Walmart is only accelerating. In full disclosure I am short NEWR and think that their product set is old news - also if you look at Linkedin, they are having a mass exodus in the sales org at all levels."
they beat 0.19 vs 0.09 and raised next qtr eps. problem is $5M lighter revenue. It is fairly valued in the 80s.
"They beat on earnings and revs, also guided up on earnings plus in-line with revs...should be up for the day, not down"
remember ANET in march....
"Who knew a 2.7% drop in revenue guidance could drop a stock 20%. I guess if guidance went up 2.7%, the stock would climb 20%. No? Then this drop is irrational"
Not a good investment for me. But holding on to the stock in hope it will be back over 100.
https://go.trade-ideas.com/SHCs
60$ this week and 70 $ a month from now market says ( software stocks rebound)
Revenue Officer Resigned....NEWR may have to restate their previous earnings...$30 is possiabletoo much debt..58X EPS now...just be careful
NEWR is up 4.93% to $85.13
I have stop loss at 56 should I wait till then or sell now?
"So many upgrades. Yet it drops on a strong up day. If this is still over the management selling a small number of shares, get over it, insignificant in the big scheme of things."
NEWR reached a new All Time High at 61.61
"No messages here for 5 days, looks likes people have given up on this stock $NEWR. Likely to break below 52-week low and go below before Jim Cramer first recommended it,"
Looks like gs was right let's see what happens now .71 was low more than 6 months ago. Maybe it's the bottom. What a disaster. Without Trump sell off this stock would be falling from 92$ most likely to 72 also unbelievable.
*this stock
Why down 4.3% with no news
