"Keep an eye on the insider selling in the last 30 days, plus the heavy automatic insider selling in the last 6 months. Something does not add up."
60$ this week and 70 $ a month from now market says ( software stocks rebound)
Solid beat  I ain’t selling my shares!
numbers seem great no?
"Risk from pandemic for this quarter and following quarters results is indeed big issue as uncertainity in general is nightmare for investors. But how about 1 year later? I am optimistic that by then pandemic effect will be much lower, if not completely gone. The pullback is overreaction imo. Good people, good market and good product. This is why I trust New Relic will do fine in future. So far they had very good performance imo."
How is it possible the CEO can sell stock 2 days before an earnings release??? Thought there was always a 30 day period which restricts buys or sales Managment
This stock is down 50% since I invested some money. Time to give up and take my loss.
"I hear that they are getting destroyed by Datadog and Splunk and customer churn at Large Accounts like Walmart is only accelerating. In full disclosure I am short NEWR and think that their product set is old news - also if you look at Linkedin, they are having a mass exodus in the sales org at all levels."
"WOW, I am way ahead! I bought when it was a bit over $31.00"
Zacks calls this a strong sell. Is anything zacks says accurate???? Lol
"Take advantage of low price due to market pull down...stocks like NEWR,CRM,ASML are blessings to buy now and thank later"
This stock is extremely oversold. The market made an elephant out of a fly: a tiny “miss” in sales. Check out analysts’ responses to the latest ER.To cut a long story short: this stock is going to $75-80 within days.
"where do you go to get an analyst's job? might as well be a weatherman. at least they give you a disclaimer accuracy percentage. NEWR missed big while some ""in the know"" were promoting blue sky."
Quiet before the storm ?

New Relic is up 4.99% to 78.22
You’re telling me they’re projecting 12-13% revenue growth and people are paying >6x revenue w/ zero margin? Makes no sense.
"Reported today on CNBC... Take Two and Activision damage to earnings and revenues has been both Fortnite and the move to online gaming. Both strengths of NEWR. Subscription gaming is the future, like Netflix with games, and NEWR has a very strong position exploiting that with their Fortnite success."
"What happened folks. I saw it trading above $110 and I think I even saw a $113, then boom, it’s back down to $106. What in the world caused the reversal? Best I can tell they raised bottom in Guidance 38% and top-end by 25% versus what they said in November. What more can you ask for?"
Wow what is wrong with this thing? Wanted to buy but just keeps dropping on up days. Anyone know why?
