LPX is amongst the strongest shares of the forest products sector. According to my point and figure analysis this stock will soon be heading for new heights. Just be patient.
Louisiana-Pacific is down 4.92% to 29.17
LPX reached a 52 Week high at 32.87
"OSB prices keep going up, you have to figure they are probably already sold out 6-8 weeks into this new quarter already so it will be yet another stellar quarter on top of the one that already closed out."
"Wow, is this a value trap or what?"
Still no improvement in osb price market

Good Morning Ryan!
I just bought 250 shares of this one. I think is still an undervalued company and I feel it could reach $115 level later this year. What do you think guys?
"Don't know why its down, but gives me a chance to buy more shares... buy the dip!!"
"Looks like they paid about 63-64 a share on the buybacks. I was wondering if they could of done something else with the money not waited for a lower share price. Maybe that is a good price, just hard to take when it's higher then today's price. I've seen this before. On a boom cycle. You hope they spread the buybacks out and not buy at the highs."
Louisiana-Pacific is up 5.38% to 36.05
Please do not confuse brains with a Bull market There is a LUMBER shortage supply and demand issue and a rotation from Tech to Industrials keep an eye on the Dow Indus and the Nasdaq please see identify why!!!!
Always a good sign to see a CFO load up on over $600k of shares.
Louisiana-Pacific is down 5.30% to 57.20
"Why LPX is down so much? Yes, the whole market is down, but this is down more."
"Today LPX is noted as the strongest stock of the sector. The paradox is that on this very day the stock reversed down in my point and figure system. The latter could be the result of HTF - High Frequency Trading which is a machines work to frighten off weak stockowners so that the HTF-traders can buy this stock cheaply while the stock is a very strong one, and will soon rise. Be patient don't let this scare you off."
Louisiana-Pacific reached a 52 Week high at 44.94
LPX is down 4.91% to $21.13
"Dudes are making money hand over fist. Probably tails off next spring with taper dudes. Wonder if competition gets stiffer then, less demand. Probably already reached peak margins. But doesn't mean all down hill. Being debt free or close to it is nice. Gives possibility s"
Looks like a close above 54.57 today would be a nice set up as we get closer to Earnings Call on Aug 3rd
maybe the hurricanes would allow LPX to move past the 32 resistance point in the future
Louisiana-Pacific reached a 52 Week high at 41.18
"Wow! LPX beats by $0.16, beats on revs; reinstates quarterly dividend! I see upgrades and new PT of $35.Congrats Longs."
"Bought today at $58. I did not go through the details but I liked the big picture and therefore I did not really hesitate. Solid balance sheet (cash vs debt). Revenues, net income and operating margin have been increasing (consecutively) for the last 4 quarters. It seems stock prices were in a consolidation phase for the last 2 months so I hope we will see a good momentum from now on. Good luck to all!"
"Can someone check my math? After $1b in repurchases, this is about an $82 stock."

"OSB with PMDI releases toxic byproducts when it is burned, cut, or otherwise machined. Which means when your house is built, or anytime you poke a hole in the OSB, you are releasing chemicals that can harm your body. This can result in exposure to PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), like formaldehyde, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), like benzene, which have been found to lead to cancer in the nasal and paranasal cavities. These OSBs containing known carcinogens, including titanium dioxide and paraffin wax, are required to come with a special hazardous chemical warning in at least three states. Yes, you read that correctly. Even though these chemicals are known to cause cancer, 47 states in the Union still don't feel the need to have a specific consumer warning accompanying the purchase."
LPX is up 4.91% to 30.53
"An interesting observation today. One seller or a group of sellers of LPX seem to have sold approx. stocks for over $ 100 mill in large batches, and 3 minutes before NYSE closed trading for the day it all stopped. Not a single LPX share was sold during the last 3 minutes. This is highly unusual. The last sale was at $69.80. Other sellers were not willing to sell at this low price. Had the seller or group sold out, or will the seller or sellers come back tomorrow? The daily average is 1.718183 shares but todays volume was 3.076882 which exceeded the daily average with 1.358699 shares."
The upgrades being made to the LPX technology side of the business will allow for decent cost savings that won't appear in the upcoming quarterly results but will be reflected in the Q4 reporting.
Why wouldn't you look at Interfor instead? So much better metrics. ISFPF
Louisiana-Pacific is down 5.05% to 38.55
Seem a limit order $59 might execute in this weakness
We closed above the resistance
Buying 200 shares on the open
Sorry. Steel is the new wood...
great chance to buy more
LPX is up 4.92% to $22.84
I’m not ready to call a top yet in cyclicals like LPX. I think with the price of lumber continuing and upward trend for the foreseeable future that timber stocks still have room to run. I remain long.
Why is the stock price dropping so much?
"Just bought shares of LPX. With the building boom and another hurricane coming to Louisanna, this was a no brainer. Huge call positions too."
Interested to see earnings. Margins and earnings are going to be an extreme record setting quarter... followed by maybe even a bigger Q4
Looks legit.

"lpx revenue (siding & osb) depends on housing starts & r&r activitylower lumber prices = highger home affordability = more housing starts = more sales for lpxlpx makes both siding & osb directly from logs, not lumber, prices of logs (timber) and of lumber are two different things, and timber was, is and will be relatively cheapanything wrong with this logic?"
Can anyone tell me why this stock has been hammered so badly?
Osb price is lower by 40% compare to last year .Share will go below $20.00 soon
LPX reached a 52 Week high at 30.69
Party is over.Osb prices drop 70% in 4 weeks
Back to 22's today or lower. Increased dividend and share repurchase program won't cancel the revenue miss.
What is the support for $Lpx ?
I dont know what to do with this one folks. Im down 18% . I could lower my average price but now im not too confident on this stock. What do you guys think?

"LPX to take off this year. $33 in February after earnings. LPX has lowered its debt and boosted its margin in the past year. There is a little lag between wood product companies and homebuilders, but have no doubt... LPX's time is coming."
"Lower osb prices, lower volume,no profit this quarter."
Louisiana-Pacific is up 5.82% to 31.43
"This lumber shortage shall pass, to much pressure on the building industry with homes being sold, without being completed do to the shortage,my area here is exploding in the building of new homes along with other small towns were building is also exploding."
"Funny how clickbait media is talking about how Goldman sacks issued a sell notice for BCC and LPX citing lumber going down, despite the fact neither of them make lumber and OSB has not fallen 60-70% like lumber did, and is telling people to buy Weyerhauser, which goldman obviously owns."
Louisiana-Pacific is down 5.07% to 60.29
"Beat on earnings, low on revenue. Company demonstrates solid profitability despite sector going through cyclical bottom. Immediate market reaction will likely depend on overall market mode today. In longer-term it is safe."
Where's shorty??
"According to my Point and Figure charts both the market tool, ""NYSE bullish percent"" and the sector tool ""Forest's bullish percent"", have reversed down but may according to my estimate change to positive again around June 7. A new major climb of LPX prices should not be expected until around that date. We longs need to be patient. Hold your positions and watch the events."

"The pullback may originally stem from 3 fears. Fear of inflation, fear of war in the Middle East and fear of competition from lumber coming in from Canada. The inflation and war fears seem over. Competition from Canadian lumber will influence on the lumber cost in USA and will therefore not hurt LPX the coming months. The market will soon see this and adjust the stock price accordingly."
"I'm worried that it dropped below the $60 support level as that was holding strong for a while now. If it drops below $59 heading into a weekend, look out. You'll likely see an even bigger sale off"
"with this price lpx p/e during 2nd half of the year will be aroun 4-5, which is dirt cheapworst case scenario for next year - still less than 10good test case for value-investing approach)"
They are planning to lay off the Canadian sector to increase profits on paper. They are essentially downsizing. To increase stock price they even introduced a program where employees can buy in at a discount. Kind of sad.
Why soo much fud in this stock?
Not sure what lox has planned but this housing lumber boom made these guys money. Looks like they can be debt free.
Buying more LPX ahead of earnings. No reason why this shouldn't be a blowout quarter. If it sells off I am buying more. OSB prices are still far away from topping out.
Upgraded to Buy at Bank of America. See it on marketwatch.upgrades.
TIMBER !!! LOL
I hope LP can quickly get materials to those areas that will need homes rebuilt from the wildfires. No one should lose their home!
"It's end of the quarter and it looks like OSB and Plywood prices continue to increase. Should be a good quarter when they report, but more so they are probably already sold out 2 months into the next quarter so that should be shaping up quite well as well. The company should be dialing down on share repurchases here while the stock is cheap"

"It will be nice when the executives, that were let go, at LP and or the ones taking early retirement stop executing their options to sell shares. It is killing the stock price of an otherwise well managed company."

"Beat on both revenueand earnings. Next quarter outlook is cautious, but analyst estimates were cautious too. This stock financials are very strong and so it can sail easily through temporary softness in homebuilding."
I heard some 45 folks from LP’s sale team got let go today?
"I'm curious, I own Norbord (OSB) which has a P/E of 7. LPX has a P/E of 14. OSB EPS last 2 quarters were $1.39, $1.41. LPX last 2 quarters were $.70, and $.89 (recent). Stock price of LPX is $30 and paying dividend of $.13 cents, and OSB paying dividend of $.60 cents.This seems like a classic of case of ""lack of awareness""..."
Overvalued at $31.60. Potential for earnings and revenue growth seems difficult for the foreseeable future.
Wood. It grows on trees!
Housing starts in construction will soon come to an end do to the lack of lumber when and when supplies returns LPX will be one of the leaders supplying the lumber..JMO..GLTA

Hold down the fort LPX longs. This is a generous buying opportunity. I see this stock going into the 80s and 90s long term. Rising OSB prices will ultimately prevail over the downward pressure on the market.
For you Ryan. To the Moon!
"what's up with resins for osb? Madison's lumber reporter been reporting osb mills have order files well into August. Is this only demans/supply issue (meaning no stopping for lpx revenues), or due to any shortages of any materials?"
@mark....trex is a whole different animal than plywood/OSB...Have you ever worked with trex?....super expensive and super heavy compared to regular lumber....can't even compare
"Based on Q2 2021 net income, LPX reached a P/E ratio around 3 as per today. Additionally, low lumber prices does not seems to affect LPX profitability as operating margin recently reached its peak. Given the unlevered balance sheet and recurrent solid operating cash flow, it seems that LPX is undervalued and well positioned for further growth from a fundamental perspective.Saying that, I do not understand Goldman Sachs comment dated 15 July 2021 which stated that because they are more commodity-exposed, LPX ""could face near-term pressure as lumber and related prices retreat from all-time highs"".However, I would not be surprised to see 1-2 days in red given our recent rally."
"Earning miss. However, outlook is positive, buyback and dividend increased, and stock was undervalued by a mile before earning numbers started decelerating. It means that downside risk is limited."

Five days ago I warned about High Frequency Traders that force the stock price artificially down to scare off weak investors. They have apparently reentered the scene today. Ignore the unexpected fall and keep on to your valuable LPX-stocks

"Are people short selling the shares to just to force a hostile leveraged buyout? There is absolutely no reason for this stock to be hit so hard considering they are pretty much firing on all cylinders, are coming out with new products, have minimal or no debt, are drastically saving operating costs by implementing new technology and are getting rid of massive amounts of rent by closing redundant offices on the west coast."

"The pullback is caused by fear of full war in the Middle East. It is a typical reaction when a war may break out, and it usually goes back to normality not too long after, even if war breaks out."
We are currently at the 5 day moving average 53.73. Let’s hope we end the day above this level.
Zack's #1 rating for LPX.
Closing above 55 today on a down market would be called — making a statement
Very bullish on this company right now. OSB is in extremely high demand right now due to the housing boom. I expect this stock to hit $100 overtime. I bought a few weeks ago and already have a big gain. Those who think the stock is expensive now can't even begin to imagine how cheap it is now compared to where it will trade in the future. Betting against this company right now is like betting that the sun won't come up tomorrow.

This is going much higher. A bargain on every metric- in a market full of vapor stocks!
This lumber shortage will end sooner than later and big companies like LPX will be one of the big winners.
After one hour into the trading day the number of shares that have shifted owners point to an even higher amount than yesterday. The behavior of the sellers is contrary to yesterday's very good first quarter of LPX. I assume that the selling galore soon will dry up when the unforeseen seemingly panic sales are exhausted.

"Look at their debt being paid down, and the really low PE ratio combined with an amazing new product coming out for outdoor decks that will make a huge impact and you will see LPX is priced too low."

"For nearly 3-4 months Zacks had this stock as a SB. Just recently, it changed to a B . What changed in the data or the forecast that promoted the stock strongly? Did it happen in the twinkling of the eye? I suspect that in a very short time span, Zacks will change the rating to #$%$ This same stoking and then downgrade also happened with TUP. Is Z a tool for the hedge funds at the individual investor's expense?"
I think lumber and housing has a long way and a long time to run. Due your own due diligence. Listen to the quarterly analyst calls of the home builders DRI or TOLL or any other. Listen to the analyst calls from the largest lumber and engineered wood products producers LPX WFG CFP BCC IFP WY.Know what is happening on the ground. Look at Ben Carson's website - 'awealthofcommonsense' for the article titled 'We Need to Build More Houses'.
The big sellers are exhausted and LPX is gaining ground again. My point and figure price target is $76.
