Buying more LPX ahead of earnings. No reason why this shouldn't be a blowout quarter. If it sells off I am buying more. OSB prices are still far away from topping out.
LPX is amongst the strongest shares of the forest products sector. According to my point and figure analysis this stock will soon be heading for new heights. Just be patient.
Hold down the fort LPX longs. This is a generous buying opportunity. I see this stock going into the 80s and 90s long term. Rising OSB prices will ultimately prevail over the downward pressure on the market.
"Earning miss. However, outlook is positive, buyback and dividend increased, and stock was undervalued by a mile before earning numbers started decelerating. It means that downside risk is limited."
"Funny how clickbait media is talking about how Goldman sacks issued a sell notice for BCC and LPX citing lumber going down, despite the fact neither of them make lumber and OSB has not fallen 60-70% like lumber did, and is telling people to buy Weyerhauser, which goldman obviously owns."
I just bought 250 shares of this one. I think is still an undervalued company and I feel it could reach $115 level later this year. What do you think guys?
Very bullish on this company right now. OSB is in extremely high demand right now due to the housing boom. I expect this stock to hit $100 overtime. I bought a few weeks ago and already have a big gain. Those who think the stock is expensive now can't even begin to imagine how cheap it is now compared to where it will trade in the future. Betting against this company right now is like betting that the sun won't come up tomorrow.
Buying 200 shares on the open
"Today LPX is noted as the strongest stock of the sector. The paradox is that on this very day the stock reversed down in my point and figure system. The latter could be the result of HTF - High Frequency Trading which is a machines work to frighten off weak stockowners so that the HTF-traders can buy this stock cheaply while the stock is a very strong one, and will soon rise. Be patient don't let this scare you off."
Always a good sign to see a CFO load up on over $600k of shares.
Zack disses the stocks momentum
"An interesting observation today. One seller or a group of sellers of LPX seem to have sold approx. stocks for over $ 100 mill in large batches, and 3 minutes before NYSE closed trading for the day it all stopped. Not a single LPX share was sold during the last 3 minutes. This is highly unusual. The last sale was at $69.80. Other sellers were not willing to sell at this low price. Had the seller or group sold out, or will the seller or sellers come back tomorrow? The daily average is 1.718183 shares but todays volume was 3.076882 which exceeded the daily average with 1.358699 shares."
Man o Man this one is a daily pump and dump 2% IT' insane should be $10 bucks higher earning are triple last year Buy on the dip.
Seem a limit order $59 might execute in this weakness
Party is over.Osb prices drop 70% in 4 weeks
Do these dudes have good earnings and guidance on earnings day???
Target $67 to $62 in a week. As soon as I bought it’s dipped into the RED 2 weeks ago.
PE 5!!! what??!! buying!!!
This is going much higher. A bargain on every metric- in a market full of vapor stocks!
Five days ago I warned about High Frequency Traders that force the stock price artificially down to scare off weak investors. They have apparently reentered the scene today. Ignore the unexpected fall and keep on to your valuable LPX-stocks
Not sure what lox has planned but this housing lumber boom made these guys money. Looks like they can be debt free.
They are planning to lay off the Canadian sector to increase profits on paper. They are essentially downsizing. To increase stock price they even introduced a program where employees can buy in at a discount. Kind of sad.
Today LPX went up to a new top $70 which created a new buy signal in my point and figure chart. With this speed it will soon pass $75 on its way up. There is no signs of a diminishing building boom.
"Lpx stock dun gone parabolic Lumber is to expensive to afford. They gonna get rid of some tarrifs Against canada?? People buying trex.Lumber is too expensive. Wonder if it comes to down a bit moderates.Earnings should be good for lpx, not sure if these high prices are sustainable."
$74.88 target price per Wall St Journal analysts in line w all others!!!! Great opportunity today to buy the dip!!!+
Stay away been here near 2 months down .50 a share. Stay away risk reward to high
Closing above 55 today on a down market would be called — making a statement
Big mistake
"Just said on CNBC that lumber supplies were coming from Canada, if I heard correctly, causing a pullback here"
Anyone know why we're getting destroyed today?
"For nearly 3-4 months Zacks had this stock as a SB. Just recently, it changed to a B . What changed in the data or the forecast that promoted the stock strongly? Did it happen in the twinkling of the eye? I suspect that in a very short time span, Zacks will change the rating to #$%$ This same stoking and then downgrade also happened with TUP. Is Z a tool for the hedge funds at the individual investor's expense?"
"Bought today at $58. I did not go through the details but I liked the big picture and therefore I did not really hesitate. Solid balance sheet (cash vs debt). Revenues, net income and operating margin have been increasing (consecutively) for the last 4 quarters. It seems stock prices were in a consolidation phase for the last 2 months so I hope we will see a good momentum from now on. Good luck to all!"
"Dudes are making money hand over fist. Probably tails off next spring with taper dudes. Wonder if competition gets stiffer then, less demand. Probably already reached peak margins. But doesn't mean all down hill. Being debt free or close to it is nice. Gives possibility s"
"It is buy here . Strong company , lots of revenue and profit ."
"It's end of the quarter and it looks like OSB and Plywood prices continue to increase. Should be a good quarter when they report, but more so they are probably already sold out 2 months into the next quarter so that should be shaping up quite well as well. The company should be dialing down on share repurchases here while the stock is cheap"
"Wow! LPX beats by $0.16, beats on revs; reinstates quarterly dividend! I see upgrades and new PT of $35.Congrats Longs."
"Based on Q2 2021 net income, LPX reached a P/E ratio around 3 as per today. Additionally, low lumber prices does not seems to affect LPX profitability as operating margin recently reached its peak. Given the unlevered balance sheet and recurrent solid operating cash flow, it seems that LPX is undervalued and well positioned for further growth from a fundamental perspective.Saying that, I do not understand Goldman Sachs comment dated 15 July 2021 which stated that because they are more commodity-exposed, LPX ""could face near-term pressure as lumber and related prices retreat from all-time highs"".However, I would not be surprised to see 1-2 days in red given our recent rally."
"lpx revenue (siding & osb) depends on housing starts & r&r activitylower lumber prices = highger home affordability = more housing starts = more sales for lpxlpx makes both siding & osb directly from logs, not lumber, prices of logs (timber) and of lumber are two different things, and timber was, is and will be relatively cheapanything wrong with this logic?"
"1. What needs to happen for this to become a super cycle?2. For those also in lumber, which sector has longer legs?$NMM $DAC $GSL $ZIM $SB $WY $LPX $WFG $CFPZF"
Louisiana-Pacific is down 5.03% to 62.74
