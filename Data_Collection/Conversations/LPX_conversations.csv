They are planning to lay off the Canadian sector to increase profits on paper. They are essentially downsizing. To increase stock price they even introduced a program where employees can buy in at a discount. Kind of sad.
Louisiana-Pacific is down 8.90% to 24.78
Canadian lumber stocks are a bargain compared to the us!!! look IFP.TO CFP.TO WFG.TO
Looking for a close today above 54.83 Stock has been staying above the 5 day moving average - this is a good sign
Louisiana-Pacific is down 4.92% to 27.63
"Bought today at $58. I did not go through the details but I liked the big picture and therefore I did not really hesitate. Solid balance sheet (cash vs debt). Revenues, net income and operating margin have been increasing (consecutively) for the last 4 quarters. It seems stock prices were in a consolidation phase for the last 2 months so I hope we will see a good momentum from now on. Good luck to all!"

A new buy signal today as LPX climbed to $ 68. A very good sign despite the sector and marked still making head win.
"lpx revenue (siding & osb) depends on housing starts & r&r activitylower lumber prices = highger home affordability = more housing starts = more sales for lpxlpx makes both siding & osb directly from logs, not lumber, prices of logs (timber) and of lumber are two different things, and timber was, is and will be relatively cheapanything wrong with this logic?"
"It is buy here . Strong company , lots of revenue and profit ."
Five days ago I warned about High Frequency Traders that force the stock price artificially down to scare off weak investors. They have apparently reentered the scene today. Ignore the unexpected fall and keep on to your valuable LPX-stocks
The last 3 trading days over 10 million shares in LPX have changed hands. With the new stock owners the selling pressure subsides and the stock will go back to its normal price level.
Closing above 55 today on a down market would be called — making a statement
LPX is amongst the strongest shares of the forest products sector. According to my point and figure analysis this stock will soon be heading for new heights. Just be patient.
"Both the forces of the marked (NYSE) and the forrest sector are currently working against us, but will hopefully turn with us again around June 7 when the bullishpercent indexes may be ready for both to turn in our favor again. Hold the fort longs, only two weeks is not a long time."
When are they doing the stock buy back?

Do these dudes have good earnings and guidance on earnings day???
Interested to see earnings. Margins and earnings are going to be an extreme record setting quarter... followed by maybe even a bigger Q4
"The pullback may originally stem from 3 fears. Fear of inflation, fear of war in the Middle East and fear of competition from lumber coming in from Canada. The inflation and war fears seem over. Competition from Canadian lumber will influence on the lumber cost in USA and will therefore not hurt LPX the coming months. The market will soon see this and adjust the stock price accordingly."

Back to 22's today or lower. Increased dividend and share repurchase program won't cancel the revenue miss.

"It's end of the quarter and it looks like OSB and Plywood prices continue to increase. Should be a good quarter when they report, but more so they are probably already sold out 2 months into the next quarter so that should be shaping up quite well as well. The company should be dialing down on share repurchases here while the stock is cheap"
I just bought 250 shares of this one. I think is still an undervalued company and I feel it could reach $115 level later this year. What do you think guys?
Not sure what lox has planned but this housing lumber boom made these guys money. Looks like they can be debt free.
LPX is up 6.29% to 30.23
"Looks like they paid about 63-64 a share on the buybacks. I was wondering if they could of done something else with the money not waited for a lower share price. Maybe that is a good price, just hard to take when it's higher then today's price. I've seen this before. On a boom cycle. You hope they spread the buybacks out and not buy at the highs."
"Why LPX is down so much? Yes, the whole market is down, but this is down more."

"WFG who is a large OSB producer says they are buying back 10% of their stock over the next month. It's basically them saying they are making boatloads of money. Bodes well for LPX too I believe, and LPX should get with the program and buy back a ton of shares and extinguish them while they are still cheap"
LPX reached a 52 Week high at 33.72
Big mistake
"Funny how clickbait media is talking about how Goldman sacks issued a sell notice for BCC and LPX citing lumber going down, despite the fact neither of them make lumber and OSB has not fallen 60-70% like lumber did, and is telling people to buy Weyerhauser, which goldman obviously owns."
"Stock price just retraced back to the 0.382 Fibonacci point. Hopefully, that level will hold so that we can see a nice bounce from here and retest the 52 week high as we get closer to the August 1st earnings call."

"Possibly a pullback due to profit-taking.I’m looking for a bounce of another retest at the Fibonacci 0.382 retracement. Then, move up to challenge 52 week high as we get closer to a great earnings report during the first 10 days of August."
To days first quarter result sent the stock to a new high above $72 with a near term bullish price objective of $76 in my Point and Figure chart. This is a stock with a nice tailwind.

Bought in today on its consolidation and housing strength
A high 52 week high is right around the corner
Can any pro tell what will be coarse action next week ?
"According to my Point and Figure charts both the market tool, ""NYSE bullish percent"" and the sector tool ""Forest's bullish percent"", have reversed down but may according to my estimate change to positive again around June 7. A new major climb of LPX prices should not be expected until around that date. We longs need to be patient. Hold your positions and watch the events."

I think lumber and housing has a long way and a long time to run. Due your own due diligence. Listen to the quarterly analyst calls of the home builders DRI or TOLL or any other. Listen to the analyst calls from the largest lumber and engineered wood products producers LPX WFG CFP BCC IFP WY.Know what is happening on the ground. Look at Ben Carson's website - 'awealthofcommonsense' for the article titled 'We Need to Build More Houses'.

"Softwood lumber and panel - plywood and OSB - prices rose by even more the week of May 7 than they did the week before, indicating that demand for construction framing wood products is not slowing down. This is good news for LPX longs"
"Today LPX is noted as the strongest stock of the sector. The paradox is that on this very day the stock reversed down in my point and figure system. The latter could be the result of HTF - High Frequency Trading which is a machines work to frighten off weak stockowners so that the HTF-traders can buy this stock cheaply while the stock is a very strong one, and will soon rise. Be patient don't let this scare you off."
Very bullish on this company right now. OSB is in extremely high demand right now due to the housing boom. I expect this stock to hit $100 overtime. I bought a few weeks ago and already have a big gain. Those who think the stock is expensive now can't even begin to imagine how cheap it is now compared to where it will trade in the future. Betting against this company right now is like betting that the sun won't come up tomorrow.

I heard some 45 folks from LP’s sale team got let go today?
For you Ryan. To the Moon!
"Are people short selling the shares to just to force a hostile leveraged buyout? There is absolutely no reason for this stock to be hit so hard considering they are pretty much firing on all cylinders, are coming out with new products, have minimal or no debt, are drastically saving operating costs by implementing new technology and are getting rid of massive amounts of rent by closing redundant offices on the west coast."

"For nearly 3-4 months Zacks had this stock as a SB. Just recently, it changed to a B . What changed in the data or the forecast that promoted the stock strongly? Did it happen in the twinkling of the eye? I suspect that in a very short time span, Zacks will change the rating to #$%$ This same stoking and then downgrade also happened with TUP. Is Z a tool for the hedge funds at the individual investor's expense?"

"Just said on CNBC that lumber supplies were coming from Canada, if I heard correctly, causing a pullback here"
Looks legit.
This lumber shortage will end sooner than later and big companies like LPX will be one of the big winners.

The upgrades being made to the LPX technology side of the business will allow for decent cost savings that won't appear in the upcoming quarterly results but will be reflected in the Q4 reporting.

Back to their range 35 38 ... building materials getting back to past supply levels.. price gouging over
The big sellers are exhausted and LPX is gaining ground again. My point and figure price target is $76.
"The thing I've seen on Northern California freeways is that logging trucks with full loads of timber looks as though there headed for the Port Of Oakland, which means of trees are going overseas.."
After one hour into the trading day the number of shares that have shifted owners point to an even higher amount than yesterday. The behavior of the sellers is contrary to yesterday's very good first quarter of LPX. I assume that the selling galore soon will dry up when the unforeseen seemingly panic sales are exhausted.
"I'm curious, I own Norbord (OSB) which has a P/E of 7. LPX has a P/E of 14. OSB EPS last 2 quarters were $1.39, $1.41. LPX last 2 quarters were $.70, and $.89 (recent). Stock price of LPX is $30 and paying dividend of $.13 cents, and OSB paying dividend of $.60 cents.This seems like a classic of case of ""lack of awareness""..."
"Beat on both revenueand earnings. Next quarter outlook is cautious, but analyst estimates were cautious too. This stock financials are very strong and so it can sail easily through temporary softness in homebuilding."
Today LPX in my point and figure chart has given a new buy signal as the stock went up to $ 67. This is a signal of strength.

"OSB with PMDI releases toxic byproducts when it is burned, cut, or otherwise machined. Which means when your house is built, or anytime you poke a hole in the OSB, you are releasing chemicals that can harm your body. This can result in exposure to PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), like formaldehyde, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), like benzene, which have been found to lead to cancer in the nasal and paranasal cavities. These OSBs containing known carcinogens, including titanium dioxide and paraffin wax, are required to come with a special hazardous chemical warning in at least three states. Yes, you read that correctly. Even though these chemicals are known to cause cancer, 47 states in the Union still don't feel the need to have a specific consumer warning accompanying the purchase."

I’m not ready to call a top yet in cyclicals like LPX. I think with the price of lumber continuing and upward trend for the foreseeable future that timber stocks still have room to run. I remain long.
Hold down the fort LPX longs. This is a generous buying opportunity. I see this stock going into the 80s and 90s long term. Rising OSB prices will ultimately prevail over the downward pressure on the market.

"An interesting observation today. One seller or a group of sellers of LPX seem to have sold approx. stocks for over $ 100 mill in large batches, and 3 minutes before NYSE closed trading for the day it all stopped. Not a single LPX share was sold during the last 3 minutes. This is highly unusual. The last sale was at $69.80. Other sellers were not willing to sell at this low price. Had the seller or group sold out, or will the seller or sellers come back tomorrow? The daily average is 1.718183 shares but todays volume was 3.076882 which exceeded the daily average with 1.358699 shares."

"Based on Q2 2021 net income, LPX reached a P/E ratio around 3 as per today. Additionally, low lumber prices does not seems to affect LPX profitability as operating margin recently reached its peak. Given the unlevered balance sheet and recurrent solid operating cash flow, it seems that LPX is undervalued and well positioned for further growth from a fundamental perspective.Saying that, I do not understand Goldman Sachs comment dated 15 July 2021 which stated that because they are more commodity-exposed, LPX ""could face near-term pressure as lumber and related prices retreat from all-time highs"".However, I would not be surprised to see 1-2 days in red given our recent rally."
