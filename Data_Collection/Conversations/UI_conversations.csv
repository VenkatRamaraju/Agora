"April fools or real.. You decide. The reddit sub r/networking went private and they chose ubiquity as the joke. The entire networking community relies on this reddits' sub. This is not an overreaction but just the start of the downward slope. They are not ISO27001 or SOC2 certified which are basic must-haves when running SAAS services. Generally when building products you pick two of three objectives: Cheap, Good, Fast. In the case of Ubiquity is only cheap. https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/ ""r/networking/r/networking has been acquired by Ubiquiti after the disaster in our cloud infrastructure.

some salty action AH. hmmm hopefully the after hours action is sign of times tomorrow morning
BWS Financial maintains a Buy of $370. I definitely agree with this price target.
"I just want to weigh in as a user of Ubiquiti products. I looked up their stock after installing many routers and access points. I was very impressed with their technology, software, and prices. It looks like I am late to the stock, but will look for an entry point. Look out Cisco!"
"Can't explain the runup. Maybe the talk of M&A or Take Private, maybe just a good week for Tech."
$175 by next earnings $225 after
when is earnings
For people who bought last week below $300 ... MERRY early CHRISTMAS 
"easy buy......so undervalued, 400 coming soon"
Robert Pera better be looking to see how his stock is being manipulated.

Here we go again. It's starting to warm up for another run. $290 price target.

u might trim today. these results with heavy short interest we will be at new highs next week
anyone think supply chain issues hurt earnings this week?
"I am a long term shareholder, and I did not see this one coming....I am leaving work early to walk my dogs and leap for joy....."
come on 90
"One thing I found out recently. Robert Pera owns 90% of the outstanding shares. That leaves 10% for us to fuss over. The odds he will take the company private are HUGE. A nice round $500 sounds about right. Yesterday the light bulbs started turning on!! I have been invested in the Pera name for over 15 years with his father at AMNF and never looked back! My cost basis is $25.50 in UI, I just wish I would have backed up the truck!"
Some very positive elements to this stock. Love the sector but key is insider holdings and focus on shareholder value.
"based on the price alone - I'd be shy, because the jump is insane. But based on the trading volume of just 2% float on such day as well on no extreme actions on oprions side- I'm really surprised. Still not sure if it will hold the level on March. Thinking about long March puts to protect my long position while keeping all my long January LEAPS calls."
"They beat income estimates by 19% and revenue estimates by 11% and the stock falls 8.5%. Guess all those so called analysts out there are selling some to drive the price down so they can buy more. I think there ought to be a law that anyone who holds more than a certain percentage of a stock, e.g., 1% or more, should be barred from trading in the stock a week before and week after an earnings report unless they submitted the buy or sell order 30 days in advance, just like the insiders. Maybe then the individual investor would have a chance to not have to ride the roller coaster up and down as the big boys just play games trying to knock them out so they can swoop in and buy more at the reduced price. In business, a monopoly has to have a dominate position in the industry to control price. In the stock market, someone just needs to own enough of the stock to drive the price. Manipulating the market is easy for the big investment firms."
"Remember the shorts who were constantly posting here last year? Hopefully, they've already covered."
somebody know more than somebody else. clearly news must be coming. this is a very nice power move
something going on!
Robert take this private at $420 please
2 weeks we break 100
Pera crushed it again. Should see $350 today
"Where are the earnings? This company needs a CFO. Pera, just go private if you don't want to be a publicly traded company. No analysts follow this stock anyways."
https://discord.gg/9Yk4RaqmBs
100 today.
The only bad thing for options investors- if you bought any January'21 options- you won't be able to tax potential gains as long term because they expire exactly 1 year from today- on 1/15/21. One day away from long term gains for options bought today and sold on expiration day on 1/15/21
could heat up here....if closes around 85....might fuel short interest cover into next week and 100 in play
Why is Ubiquiti slumping?
"Earnings are out, EPS $1.26 beating avg est of $1.10 Rev. 284.9 mil just shy of ave estimate 285.9 mil.Another solid quarter! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ubiquiti-networks-reports-third-quarter-120500389.html"
Why the drop today?
90 to say
covered from 129....just went long 175...wish me luck
"The market definitely hasn't yet grasped the phenomenal power of UI's latest product, UiMeet3D. The revenue from it is going to blow the top off."
The shorts are running for the hills
been owning since 2012 has been treating me well
This is going back to $50 soon. Sell now if you can and buy back later.
Hilarious how all these chicken littles are posting the sky is falling when nothing is known of the current SEC investigation except that they are checking items that are similar concerns of Citron and could be coinicidence.

Y'all should've bought some ... now you'll be paying MORE tomorrow after the YUUGE gap UP in the a.m.Mark this post!
When is Robert gonna take this company private?...is he still rebuying shares at the discount?
Amplifi HD is sold out the UBNT website. I hear the HD sells the best. UBNT also confirmed they will be selling router without mesh points soon. In time for Christmas. Go UBNT
Where are all the shorts today?
"C’mon, let’s keep going up! "
"Loving my UBNT. Have held 2000 shares this since July, 2012. Just unloaded 50% at 110.80. Will let the rest continue to do cook."
"Pera repurchased over 234 000 shares below $300 last quarter...and he is not done...the one who will hold to the end, will be greatly rewarded"
lots of covering left to do
What is going on this morning?
"This is such a manipulation. I knew something was wrong last week when this stock jumped for no news. It was a coordinated attack for the shorts. They drove up the price for no reason so they can take a bigger short position. Then releasing this ""whistle blower"" report. Ubiquiti has very little cloud business AFAIK."
here we go....mid 90s or higher this week
Lots of new products on their website !! wow ! New cameras and Door lock systems and phones. i think this stock going to 500. hopefully the growth keeps growing. and please do not change to a licensing fee model. I use their products every day and setup new sites with their stuff too.
Best ownership profile in the market. Stay with it
"* Ubiquiti Networks Inc (UBNT) - ‍expects its revenues for its fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2017 to range between $240 million and $250 million - SEC filing * Ubiquiti Networks Inc (UBNT) - ‍on September 18, board of directors of company approved an additional $100 million stock repurchase program * Ubiquiti Networks Inc (UBNT) - ‍new repurchase program expires on September 30, 2018"
excellent entry point
Anyone want to take up a collection for UI shorts? I doubt they can afford Christmas presents for their children.
deep breath before the push....to $200
"Yo Pera, now is as good of a time as ever for some stock buybacks."
https://trendytoros.com/stocks/opinions/ui/
why the lawsuits?
anyone have clue when earnings is?
"I want to reaffirm something here. Three months ago, I said that this was overdone with the sell-off during the last earnings report. Today, if you held on, you would be up over 30%. If you bought all the way down to $115 when everything was being sold, you'd be up 60%. Congratulations to everyone who won. Sometimes you just need to have a little bit of patience. We've still got a long way to go."
Watch! Another massive drop by tomorrow.. Will buy when it goes down to less than $35........ Don't risk yourself to short this too
"Take a look at the reviews on AmpliFi. The Unbox Therapy review on You Tube has over 1,200,000 views in less than 24 hours.Inventories on ShopBLT look great with persistent shortages in the G3 cameras and the new switches. Stock is rocking"
I bought UBNT at 53
Ubiquiti has now outperformed the Nasdaq for the week. Proof that CNBC and Andrew Left cannot turn the stock market in to a casino no matter how hard they try.
"meanwhile, the float decreased by another 120k shares- from 64.97MM to 64.85MM. It seems like $200MM buyback has been executed right after QR"
Someone is trying to bring this company back below 300...and I have a slightly idea WHO
so wish this is based on pre-emptive covering and maybe news coming? I'm always the last to know but appears something is cooking
im guessing something is fuzzy with earnings. they typically beat to their owm drum but this has taken very long ....any thoughts. i cant recall if before or after bell usually. i thought maybe wed see it this morning. i give up. lol
"This is a $99 stock, at best. PE is way too high and no new news that deserves this multiple...."
How's this short going?
Shorters here are going to start off new year with sore hinie....
20% of float is short prior to earnings. The first post earnings short report will be interesting.
apparently we all forget the run from 80 to $130 in days last fall early 2019....this move will be more powerful as results much better and better base with all buybacks
double daily vol on thinly traded stock!
"""We believe the sequential decline in revenues for the third quarter fiscal 2019 is primarily due to distributor ordering patterns and as described in the “Outlook” section below, we expect to achieve revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 at the high end of the guidance range previously provided."""
$200 before earnings. too many will cover before it reports!
airOS v8.0-RC (the mixed AC/M backwards compatibility firmware) was released yesterday (requires beta access):https://community.ubnt.com/t5/airMAX-Beta-Blog/airOS-v8-0-RC-released/ba-p/1733100
"A respectable ER, but not a blowout that will push the share price over $200 (LOL). A few brief observations:- UBNT has a massive inventory build-up. Either they anticipate huge growth in the 2nd half of the year, or we could be in for pain next year.- The pace of buybacks will slow significantly, as UBNT bought back far more stock than FCF can support over the past year and has drawn down its cash balance significantly."
something happening here? if awesome quarter we should test highs tomorrow. we will know low float and heavy short = rocket fuel!!
Just approved another $200 million towards stock buy back.
why is this running so hard with earning over month away?
lovely Stock and Float
Choo choo!
"I'm at a loss to explain the weakness since the earnings... I understand the ""production"" issues constraining supply to satisfy the great demand. but the demand is being satisfied to the extent that earnings and guidance is vastly outpacing the analysts community."
Reference CA lawsuit. I was a holder of stocks during the lawsuit dates. Has anyone been sent forms or been contacted by lawyers who are pursuing the litigation? TIA.
if keep squeezing and they let go we see power close $195-200
"Used to love the equipment, ( routers, airfibre, bridges, access points ), then I bought a UNIFI access point and learned that they gutted the web interface and forced using the java unified management tool which I was not happy about. Now with everything using this cloud based management that was compromised I am looking elsewhere and lost the love for Ubiquiti."
"SHOP has a data breach as well and look at that stock today. ""A grand jury has indicted a California resident accused of stealing Shopify customer data."""
Who bought tickets to the moon? Lift off leaves in 45 mins!
It might drop some more tomorrow. Not quite in oversold territory for the year. Somebody didn't like the revenue ratio. It is always something to drive the price down..
"Of 66M shares, Pera owns 57M, another 2M are short, and a new share buyback is likely to be announced in February. A know-nothing CS analyst opinion isn't enough to derail the built-in demand for UI shares going forward."
"This is going back over $300, pretty easy money to be made here."
What happened today?
UBNT reached a new All Time High at 80.12
The stock is very undervalued based on their growth and earnings Watch out shorty
trading very nicely. 3 weeks before earnings!!
UBNT to unveil new fiber/GPON products at Wispalozza. Long hinted they would be entering in a bigger way. Currently only a few of the switch/routers have fiber ports. WISP email chain lit up at the prospect.
I think we break $80 very soon! something going on here....smart if Cisco just buys them. or someone else does...but it's very odd tear it's been on with no news and earnings a ways off still
no news or anything but it's has been running! what's going on?
"Word on the street is Robert Pera is the absolute worst...Heard terrible things about this guy...That spank has made me a fortune off his stock, but I have heard terrible, credible things...Go see a therapist, Robert..."
I believe Left and CNBC should be investigated by SCC if these allegations prove to be wrong..He must have made a fortune as UBNT shares tanked and that reeks of insider trading to me. False allegations cause shareholders millions of dollars by these short seller and that's just BS.
$180+ close. $200 next week. this float....too much covering and no shares left. nobody and I mean nobody expected this quarter!!
187-190 close
Nice. getting a dividend hike! Thanks Rob
"HiAlpha, you sound like Andrew Left, who took a short position a while back then accused UI of fraud. You need to look closer at the business model. They are not like other companies in the space and analysts don't seem to understand that, which has worked to my benefit since 2013. As an aside, I was happy to see left get crushed in the GME debacle."
run to the hills shorts. here we go. 100+ by friday
"Pera said on the recent earnings call ""I'm always looking for ways to put our capital at work, and if I feel the stock is significantly undervalued we are going to continue to buy it back. And it is true, we are lending money onshore to buyback, but if we believed in the long-term story the Company which we do, I don’t think cash is going to be a problem over the long-term as the Company is going to generate a lot of cash"". After the close today, the company announces another $50M buyback program was approved:""On September 5, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a $50 million stock repurchase program (the “New Program”). Under the New Program, the Company may repurchase up to $50 million of its common stock. The New Program expires on September 30, 2018.""At the current price, that’s about 860,000 shares and largely offsets Pera’s recent sales of 1M shares. They also have $1,254,358.66 available under the Prior Program. It think this highlights smart capital allocation by Pera."
40 in 3 months ask yourself why
"Pera went to the same school as me, UCSD. He was well regarded for the Ubiquity startup. Pera is not a #$%$. He is just not some big business CEO type. The company has been run with minimal overhead which destroys profit. Anyone here who doesn't understand what overhead can do, has a lot to learn. Pera understands it and the insidious nature of overhead which becomes so engrained that it's invisible. Netgear and Cisco are typical corporate behemoths literally drowning in overhead. I worked for Boeing for a long time and there was only token effort to control overhead. Overhead budget pools were so large that I personally conducted multi million dollar wind tunnel tests and charged them off completely to overhead.The sad part of all of this is that corporate America is virtually all hoax and Pera and Ubiquity make them look bad so they're the villains"
"This is an underrated company with much upside potential, good products with low SG & A cost, spend lots of money on R & D"
momentum baby. 100 b4 lunch then power close!!!
low float....rocket fuel once covering begins
"Remember Andrew Left the short ""guru"" called this a good short at $60"
The  leaves the moon in 2 hours. Next stop: Mars !!!
"UI just posted their earnings without any advanced notice. THe earnings are great, beat expectations. Raised Dividend to 40 Cents a share from 30 cents last quarter. No mention of Any earnings conference call. No squeak from any analysts. Is there any analyst following this stock anymore? Why is Pera being this hostile to the Analyst community and the share holders? This BB is dead too, even on the earnings day>>> I just do not understand.... Just cannot be explained as dog days of summer!!"
Short % of float is 32%. What are they thinking? They had an opportunity to bail after the Citron hit piece. But here we are 160% later...still 32% short. I would be laughing if I were not so amazed. On top of everything else they stayed short in the face of Pera likely taking UBNT private!!!
here we go
MASSIVE SHORT SQUEEZE with 15 days to cover before earnings
"This is a unrecognized stock with great potential, high spending on R & D, low S G & A, a winner"
Shorts are totally taking advantage of the bad press and lawsuits but it won't last.
Lol I called it
Has UI reached its peak? Profit taking? Gone down almost daily
trading public like us always the last 2 know
What is the trading volume on this stock telling us? Volume is way high. Why?
This stock will be around 350 after earnings.
These lawyers are so desperate to find some people that lost money on UI. The problem is there aren't any!!!!
Just saw their Amplifi display in Best Buy. Looks good
"I have been in WiFi business for a long time, these guys are legit. What Citron does not get is that what is disruptive is that unlike Netgear, Ubiquiti offers Enterprise networking grade gear at fraction of what Cisco, HPE, Ruckus and others charge. And their products keep getting better. Citron should learn more about networking technology."
here she goes...watch her close
Is ER release happening today?
Apple buys UI and makes Pera CEO
"Para keeps proving his naysayers wrong. I owned this back in 2016, but got called away through options. Should have just bought and held onto those shares in hindsight."
"Beat earnings by $0.12 and revenue by $37M. Stock is so undervalued right now, should be around $340 minimum."
"Looks like a good buy around $43.....until then, I see no reason to buy a stock that the SEC is investigating....typically, where there is smoke, there is fire..."
let's get real its run up big time. some anxious sellers to lock in profits I'm sure. not sure it's a sign of anything otherwise
To sharply increase with no news? How can we expect this gain to be supported?
They do make excellent products. I'm not even upset their stock is going up and GME is being shorted..
"When are earnings coming out, and what is the play.I have been loading up on a gut feeling this baby is going to pop! :)GLT"
"Wow! Today is 10/9/20. This thing went from about $155 to $190 within 30 days time. the Peak of $198 was around Thanks giving 2019. and between May and Sept of 2020, it held around 170-188 range. wow can't believe this. and lots of new products came out within this year too. New Gen2 switches and NVR.Engineers are from Motorola and Apple. Great low product prices at enterprise level performance !! Easy to use and setup.For a pair of Airmax antennas costing under $200, you can transmit your home network up to 13 miles. Wireless ISP shops use these products !! Awesome !! way better than CISCO and no license fees !Thank you to all the engineers for keeping prices low and offering superior performance and user friendly.Many Youtube videos help to show how to setup. easy to learn !!The security cameras are awesome !! Get the G3-Pro or G4-Pro camera, large image sensor great night vision. User friendly app and web interface to search for video footage and download !!"
What is the expectation on earnings. I am expecting a win. The UAP-AC-Lite and Pro are the top selling AP across pretty much every online retailer:Amazon.comAmazon.caAmazon.co.ukNewegg.comNewegg.caetc.I don't remember them being this dominate last quarter so things are getting better.
$250 in october
Good results 
"Wow strong for the 1 month chart. Compared to AMZN, TSLA, FB, AAPL, NVDA, NFLX, on a 30 day chart., UI is out performing all of them by a huge margin. Use the Yahoo Chart section and put in your comparisons for 1 month. you will see, UI doing way better than all stocks you put into compare. the stock that is closest to UI for 30 day performance on the graph shows ZM. Zoom for Oct. 19th 2020, did same as UI at almost 30% on a 30 day chart. Zoom is way over valued. This UI definately a great buy. Jim Cramer never talks about this one. it is so quiet. CNBC or Bloomberg I never seen the ticker stream across the TV. wow ! Can't believe the news media does not hype this up. oh man !Today is 10/19/20.This UI is strong !! Good time to take some profits. Elections is coming fast !In this last few months my employer has ordered 8 batches of security cameras we need for our sites. We love the cameras. and now we are trying out the video door bell too."
cha ching
be nice if we get some much deserved coverage and price hikes!!
I know it's always a wild card date but anyone know when earnings is?
Headed back up up up
this ship sailed. they stepped on the hose and there is too much pressure! pobrecito
"When is earnings for UI? should be coming up, but I don't see a date or announcement"
No true resistance until $300. i think we can get there by the end of the year. Symmettry partners and other hedge funds are adding positions. BWS financial have rated UI a buy with a $290 price target. This has more room to run in the post covid era as well. Great long term investment!
rocket fuel
"Anyone have any thoughts, feelings, predictions, leeks or unheard info about upcoming time and value of next earnings ??? ... how the stockpile looks like ?"
UBNT reached a new All Time High at 74.13
I got smoked. Next Q will be solid. Alien is selling like hot cakes.
What price should I buy at? Does this get down to $280 or buy now?
"Yo Pera, if you had a CFO and an actual conference call this stock with analysts following, UI would be $400+"
"This looks overdone to me. Take a look at the earnings report and see for yourself. Revenue was up YoY, EPS up YoY, dividend declared as well. Their enterprise provider technology revenues were up substantially YoY (comparable quarters). Gross profit as a percent is higher while operating expenses were lower on a YoY basis. Income is up by all metrics.I'm still holding my positions on this until we get a material change in direction. Good luck to all!"
"Short sellers got government assistanceWhen the investigation is done, I believe the company will be exonerated, and it will come back to bite the shorts in the shorts."
its calibrating....before we start run to $180+ this afternoon. mon morning $200+
Whats going on today?
"Brilliant! They beat on revenue, they beat on earnings, they beat on forward guidance revenue and they beat on forward guidance earnings. The forward guidance beats were especially impressive because they were significantly above estimates and companies are usually conservative on forward guidance. I am so happy i am willing to brave the godawful new yahoo message boards to post this message. Seriously though, why does this thing steal my cursor every other second??? How hard is it to program a fricking text box????"
a lil mid day flush to make room for afternoon power move. $97-98 close!!!
UBNT is up 7.48% to 78.84
Andrew Left...how ya doin pal...lol
"Thanks to etrade: Beyond Meat Shows the Risk of Short Selling a Stock. 5 More Short Squeezes to Watch. -- Barrons.com[snip]That got Barron's thinking. Are there other stocks with similar traits to Beyond Meat? We found five: online car dealer Carvana, realty site Zillow, tool seller Snap-On, packaged food maker Hormel Foods, and Ubiquiti Networks, which sells networking hardware and software. All five are heavily shorted, and most are pricey relative to peers. That sounds like a recipe for declines, but, as Beyond Meat has shown, good news can inflict a painful squeeze."
Only have a couple of days left before missing out on the nice dividend increase Pera just dropped on us!
90 + close
What is causing this massive sell off in this stock?
half short. lol. if market stays green and maybe upgrade or two. lookout 100
see MSFT announcement about rural ISP support and look at the ISP they chose. UBNT equipment.
Anyone watch the CNBC video? Wopner and Cramer made it look like there was only one fraud and that just may be Left. I think his days are numbered with getting on CNBC. I kinda think Ubiquiti has grounds to sue him. Shrill midget.
"is anyone on the board familiar with MaxLinear? if so, would you consider them a competitor to UI or do they supply product to them? thank you for any insight. i learned about them from an investment i have in CREE, with whom they are partnering on 5G/silicon carbide solutions."
will be above $100 soon
"Nice volume today, hope we get to $350 by end of week"

"This was a blowout quarter that I frankly did not expect. I actually considered selling covered $145 calls on my position, but I am now glad I did not. Surprisingly solid growth in North America as UI continues to take share in the ""prosumer"" market. I don't see a reason to trim my position now unless the stock reaches the $170 range."
"Hey, I just woke up, did I miss anything?"
somebody always knows more than the rest of us
there she goes...there she goes
cha ching. 93-94 this week
Down over 20% in a week. Can someone stare at their chart and tell me when we're headed to $250?
then 100+ next week
"These guys have a great product, in and out, seems like they can keep the high margins with how they roll. Anyone think this is a good entry point or wait for a possible March lag into the 110's?"
"The volume was indicative of the drop, UBNT could not move up when it was trading over 1m shrs/da. Today is the first day that UBNT's vol will be close to it's past daily volume. While this does not indicate a move up, it usually indicates the selling has abated. So I'm back in with an initial buy, having sold, just lucky, close to 170."

ANNOUNCES NAME CHANGE TO UBID HOLDINGS, INC.Shares to Begin Trading Today Under the New Stock Ticker Symbol “UBID”Appoints Kevin Harrington to Board of DirectorsEngages with Maxim Group for Investment Banking ServicesATLANTA, Feb. 13, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Incumaker, Inc.

"For those who are wondering what is happening, check the reddit channel on r/networking for the ubiquity posts. This is as bad as splunk who haven't recovered yet. I believe the general sentiment is the company can no longer be trusted and will take a lot of time and effort to regain trust. I suspect this will drop more."
Only going up to $350 from here. Lawsuits meaningless. Only a couple ever lost money on UI
Prisoner's dilemma here. Cost of borrow on short is getting astronomical. First person to cover is likely to be the winner versus other shorts. The Pera put is in place so last short out is likely going to be in a house of pain. Time will tell but it seems the clock is ticking faster than ever.
"great result of sales and earnings, mild reaction to the numbers almost like no one cares"
"I feel today's movement was due to a couple of large trades by hedge funds. Reality is Pera owns 56,278,181 shares and hasn't sold any since August 2017. He remains the majority share holder by far. Very few insiders have sold any in past 2 years. Some large institutional holders like First Trust Advisors added 3.4% to their position this quarter adding 11,615 shares reported today. If large holders and the owner aren't panicking I feel the earnings will continue to beat on top and bottom. It's important to remember UBNT has an amazing product line, which all my IT connections rave about. Then you have the analyst who despise the board of directors, so little to no coverage for over 10 years. Crazy talk like they need tech support, yet they have an IT community which provides real experience tech support. You want advise from someone who actually uses the product or some dumb #$%$ reading a script? Script question #1 Did you unplug it? To hell with that. Personally I have their router and access points which have been active without fail for over 7 years. To think I use to need to reboot and resolve conflicts in my old linksys and cisco equipment ever other month. Just my 2 cents......"
"Yes, earnings come out tomorrow.Anyone else curious about how the price shot up in after hours . Trading @ $320.00 a share."
"Pera is worth $17 Billion, don't think he cares much"
"Reports Q4 (Jun) earnings of $1.46 per share, $0.09 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $1.37; revenues rose 10.1% year/year to $315.5 mln vs the $306.3 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.""In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we continued to experience a disruption in our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This disruption impacted our suppliers' ability to manufacture or provide key components and services and we have incurred, and we continue to incur, additional costs to expedite deliveries of components and services. While our ability to procure components and services has improved during the quarter, the disruptions in our supply chain have not been fully remediated and the effects, if any, of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in the Company's financial results until future periods."""
Drifts down for what feels like months. Now all time highs. Wow
triple digits ....oh ya!!
"Bought this stock Monday , every review that comes out is positive. Great stock"

Very excited for the earnings report on 5/8

"Issues with metrics relating to the Ubiquiti Community, accounting practices, financial information, auditors, international trade practices, and relationships with distributors and various other third parties. This will come down to 35-40 in upcoming days. Will take more than a month to answer multiple issues and who knows how much of discrepancies at the end"
Cha ching
"This the gift that keeps on giving, the model is spend on research and not so much on SG & A, it is working one only has to look at the last few quarters to see what's happening, lots of room to run, competition with Ring and Sysco"
it's taking standard late morning rest before the strong afternoon push
"I’m in IT and everyone is installing Unifi Ubiquiti hardware. It’s Rock solid enterprise hardware for an attractive price. If you think this company is a fraud, you lose all of my trust. Can’t believe some of these headlines."
I shed a few calls just to be smart but expect very strong push next week
Look for at least 2 months of heavy bear. These lawsuits are all by design
my oh my
"For anyone out there following UI, they announce tomorrow. I'm expecting some good numbers, we shall see."
"Nothing has fundamentally changed today with this stock. UI continues to be a top performer, year-over-year. Last year we got 91% out of this stock. Month-over-month, we usually have 2-3 months where we trend sideways and/or down, and then this stock breaks out. It's happened every single time since 2012, when this stock first started trading. In 2017, we had 9 months of positive gains and only 3 months where we had a loss. In 2018 and 2019, we had 8 months of positive gains and therefore only 4 months where we had small losses. The compound annual growth rate for this stock since inception is 34.5%. This drop today is an opportunity to add more if you're underweight. Otherwise, just hold. Earnings are upcoming in February, and we'll see what the 2020 guidance looks like."
"Huge downside risk. During the initial part of the pandemic, when people started working from home, they bought a large amount of networking gear to support their new home office. Now they have what they need for the next several years. Big drop off in sales coming this year."
some early day shuffling and everything else centeris paribus....I expect a power close and 1m shares traded again
UBNT reached a new All Time High at 77.84
"The consensus full year earnings for FY 2019 (ending 6/30/19) are 4.75 (PE = 34.1). The consensus FY 2020 EPS is 5.35 (PE = 30.3). I have been a shareholder for several years, but at the current valuation, I will possibly be selling a portion of my position prior to the May ER."
Review of Ubiquiti's UniFi Protect video camera system:https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/unifi-protect/
$100 very quickly ...caught shorts with their pants down. yes
All kinds of possibilities from here and 90% of them are good for UI stock. Let your winners run. -sitting on a 10 bagger now so I’m convincing myself too.
what happened?
maybe news on the way? or just show painful short cover?
"Eddie - you are a good follower of UBNT. You have five posts - following ShopBLT numbers. But all your posts are negative. 7 months ago you said correctly that ShopBLT had 30,000 UAP AC Pro's in stock and that this would be too many. You also said the sell in accounting revenue recognition would over benefit UBNT short term as the recognize revenue when delivered to the distributors. But without sell through UBNT hurt down the road. All negative points all pessimistic for the short case. So what do we know now. ShopBLT cleared all 30,000 UAP AC Pro's in the month of January. That right in less than 30 days - the Pro was waitlisted. Today ShopBLT has begun stocking the UAP AC Pro in all 5 of their warehouses and sells about 2,000 units a day. The Tennessee and Southern California use to handle all the UBNT orders but now Pennsylvania, Illinois and Texas have portions of the 33,000 units inventoried with 11,000 ordered. Every product sold by ShopBLT is now available at all 5 warehouses. Negative posts are often filled with some basis in fact. And your following of the ShopBLT inventory shows some interest in the story. But your data should show that sell through is escalating as well as the progress the company has made filling the channel. Your post point out how easy it is to track sell through. So instead of looking to parse the Spiceworks followers list and criticizing the sell in method of accounting. Report the significant upgrade in the UBNT/ ShopBLT partnership. Or the recent announcement of the Hummingbird distribution agreement. Both developments that show the 'trend' within the IT community is very strong."
I think Pera and I are the only ones buying this stock lately
Why UI plummets after a news about data breach but Facebook is rising to all time high on the same news?
UBNT reached a new All Time High at 83.21
