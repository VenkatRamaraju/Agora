Someone is trying to bring this company back below 300...and I have a slightly idea WHO
I think Pera and I are the only ones buying this stock lately
For people who bought last week below $300 ... MERRY early CHRISTMAS 
"$250 or $350, what's it gonna be?"
"Where are the earnings? This company needs a CFO. Pera, just go private if you don't want to be a publicly traded company. No analysts follow this stock anyways."
....look at CMBM.If this is industry trend $250 is very likely after earnings
"For anyone out there following UI, they announce tomorrow. I'm expecting some good numbers, we shall see."
Good results 
Nice. getting a dividend hike! Thanks Rob
"Yes, earnings come out tomorrow.Anyone else curious about how the price shot up in after hours . Trading @ $320.00 a share."
Pera crushed it again. Should see $350 today
Only have a couple of days left before missing out on the nice dividend increase Pera just dropped on us!
Apple buys UI and makes Pera CEO
"Nice volume today, hope we get to $350 by end of week"
Only going up to $350 from here. Lawsuits meaningless. Only a couple ever lost money on UI
$250 in october
"Pera is worth $17 Billion, don't think he cares much"
"Anyone have any thoughts, feelings, predictions, leeks or unheard info about upcoming time and value of next earnings ??? ... how the stockpile looks like ?"
"Pera repurchased over 234 000 shares below $300 last quarter...and he is not done...the one who will hold to the end, will be greatly rewarded"
BWS Financial maintains a Buy of $370. I definitely agree with this price target.
