"This is a good company with good valuation ( Lynch's type). I would keep adding before those ""emotional buyings"" come streaming in.Btw can some one explain why is Berkshire is part of its ""Financial SUpplier"". Are they one of BWA's financier?"
Does anyone receive the dividend?
hopefully we get some buyers in this week looking to get in on the august 31 ex-dividend date.
"BWA has the right stuff...a great way to play autos , near and long term Great Q report"
BorgWarner is down 4.94% to 45.75
"bought in , long term, lets see where we get end 2021"
 CNBC. Cramer said he’s a buyer here; BUT. it was days ago on RMO. YES. RMO the EV Battery company with $AMZN & $BWA as interested ‘ invested partners. Tuscan can catch up when RMO Hits $50. LoL
Somebody with bigger pockets should buy BWA. A larger conglomerate with a similar automotive presence to fuel its continued growth aspirations...Can you name the companies that fit this bill?
Bwa just jumped 3% in AH. Any ideas why?
My Reddit activists  PLEASE HELP RMO being attacked by shorts. Let’s CRUSH EM.  CNBC SAYS  on RMO which is being hailed as an $AMZN EV Delivery Van battery supplier. $BWA Large Investor also CLII is also in the play / same industry as $TSLA and $NIOPS: Up 7% So far THANK YOU.
BoA had a nice automotive report upping the PO for $BWA to $66. Said that auto sales will begin to rise again starting in 2022

BWA will be flying high. CEO had talk with Cramer on Mad Money on last Friday. 65 is the target by Christmas 2021.

"Once again, it's a flatline qtr.. They earned 1 million more at a very high cost. They also reduced shares to help with a bad EPS.Inflation is everywhere, WD-40, Transports are all showing a slowing economy and yet the market keeps getting pumped up. It has a low PE-good, it has a low divi-bad. The stock is now flatline for what-about 8-9 years now.Look at the financials.https://cdn.borgwarner.com/docs/default-source/investors/8-k-12-31-2017-exhibit-99-1-press-release.pdf?sfvrsn=9548cb3c_47"
"BWA just bought a German battery manufacturer. BWA is in an incredible position to leverage the burgeoning EV industry with very little risk, as they will be a supplier to all EV manufacturing companies; their diversity in EV is the key take away for sustained growth for the next 8-10 years."
great activity...this will maintain upward track this year....management is tested and very good
"A solid beat and it gets hammered, down 5%."
 SOMEONE / MANY BUYING AFTER HOURS INCLUDING ME. STOP COMPLAINING. Look up AIMT. Exact same thing happened when Nestlie decided to buy it out. Thirty days before the announcement IT DROPPED and they got theirs cheap! Don’t be fooled $BWA Borg Warner is going to buy RMO out for north of $25 a share. WATCH & LEARN
We keep this under the radar play for good reason....has solid upside and TAKEOVER potential. Boolean
The 3.5% drop is a head scratcher for sure. They had a top and bottom line beat. Time to add on the dip.
"good balance sheet, improving metrics, good cash flow for buybacks and dividend increases, and should be able to squeeze out add'l cost savings from the delphi merger ...market reaction not the smartest ...i am a buyer here ."
"I'm Bullish on BWA and INTC to be a big benefactor in fur EV chip business (i.e building plants in AZ which will reap rewards), but (currently) bearish on the overall market going into the summer. Without a strong market this will take a while to realize decent returns. Luck to all and diversify!"
"It will be interesting to see what comes out of the the Garrett Motion (GTXMQ) auction on Dec. 18; BWA's most important competitor spun out of Honeywell. GTXMQ is a deep value play, largely dependent on how Honeywell treats payments owed to itself if it's successful in buying the business back. Recent SEC filings show they've been purchasing shares on the open market quite aggressively. BWA has the funding to build an everlasting moat in this field if it's able to acquire GTXMQ at a reasonable price IMO"
"BWA is a safe buy due to our current administration. Their love affair with EV's will create stocks like BWA, F, GM & TSLA to skyrocket. Fasten your seatbelts!"
BORG WARNER WILL BUY OUT ROMEO POWER NEXT JUNE WHEN THERE PARTNERSHIP ENDSIMHO BUY THAT TIME RMO WILL BE AT 18.00 PER SHARE.. BORG WILL HAVE TO OFFER 25 PLUSTO COMPLETE THERE EV OFFERINGS
"just when it looked like this would go green, it dips in the final minutes. another consecutive red day. stop being so scared weak hands. the stock is extremely undervalued now and has a great future ahead."
BWA is one of the best EV plays there is. Long term hold. They will be supplying numerous EV makers with components. No Brainer.
"Cramer said ""wait to buy"". Thats means BUY NOW...he is dishonest"
Load up the truck!!!
Another rough patch after latest earnings. Looks like they may have lost a bit of financial discipline in Q2 and also new CFO most likely getting all bad news out early under his watch. Expect to see it turn around later this year. Personally wish it would get back below $35 so I could take the inevitable ride back over $40. Still time.
"the ""summary"" page of this stock on yahoo finance says it is undervalued and has an estimated return of 39%."
"What a spam board . BWA definitely a good company to invest in for the long haul . Price is ready to climb into auto earnings . While not that excited about the FUSO short distance delivery truck its a great start and I imagine those who need to deliver in big cities to commercial accounts will love it . 100 km on a charge needs to be tripled though in order to complete routes for 99% of local businesses . I imagine in very large cities over a million these might work now . BWA is into the best parts and growth in the auto business in combustion , hybrid and pure electric . Would not hesitate to average in a little here and there under $60 well spread out ."
seems a big drop today ... thats surprising ... mmm
"See the Autoline interview with BorgWarner CEO/Pres. Fred Lissalde. Interesting stuff. they are going about vehicle electrification the right way. I have long thought that the real money to be made in the EV sector was through the Tier One component and system suppliers rather than through start-ups that are only making their first attempt at manufacturing.The electrification revolution is happening. For a long time that was far from certain. If we are in fact going to build tens of millions ov EVs per year the world will need real industries with the scale and engineering to do that reliably and profitably. BorgWarner has the resources in engineering, facilities, cash, connections, and experience to make that happen.This is a long term play. Expect lots of ups and downs along the way (See the latest chip shortage news) but I bet you wish now that you had bought Ford back when it was in the midst of reorganizing and sold in the $8 range."
"BWA, is holding water, but they are feeling the pressure of a shrinking economy. The low divi makes this very expensive for the limited growth ahead.https://www.borgwarner.com/docs/default-source/investors/2019-09-30-8k-exhibit-99-1-press-release-r115---final.pdf?sfvrsn=517e853c_0"
Bought in today BWA is at the forefront of the electric revolution have a limit order in at the 2015 lows at 29 very cheap here
OMG. The stock is up! Its like rain in the desert.

I would suggest buying any BWA dips. Wall Street views Borg as a dying dinosaur of a company. They are once again revamping under the slogan “CHARGING FORWARD”. Ford and Hyundai ( by 2023) will be using BWA’s IDM’s. Borg is at an inflection point right now as it won’t be long until Wall Street recognizes this company as a major player in the EV market. Expect major growth in this adapting company once again over the next decade.
