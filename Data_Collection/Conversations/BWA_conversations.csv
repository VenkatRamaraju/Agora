BWA will be flying high. CEO had talk with Cramer on Mad Money on last Friday. 65 is the target by Christmas 2021.
I would suggest buying any BWA dips. Wall Street views Borg as a dying dinosaur of a company. They are once again revamping under the slogan “CHARGING FORWARD”. Ford and Hyundai ( by 2023) will be using BWA’s IDM’s. Borg is at an inflection point right now as it won’t be long until Wall Street recognizes this company as a major player in the EV market. Expect major growth in this adapting company once again over the next decade.

It’s people that also have access to account and there isn’t many so just put it together
I don’t care if it goes lower. I got me a guaranteed cash maker today. Got RMO THE EV Battery Play that’s currently got revenue and $BWA as a partner. That’s huge! Target $35 to $40 and its sold off down to $10 ridiculous dollars . WOW

"Immovable force meets unstoppable object now that BWA has seen EPS estimate for next quarter settled at the neutral level of 0.83. Possible pullback with some downside but also possible upside. check out awesomestock-s, its a pretty reliable service. of course you have to do your own due diligence, but they generally point you in the right direction."

"I thought it was a good report today. $1.52 GAAP. Backlog growing. Pivot to EV, M&A focus. Market is more interested in Reddit and the latest thing. This will be slow conservative grower which works for me."

BWA is up 5.07% to 45.16
The 3.5% drop is a head scratcher for sure. They had a top and bottom line beat. Time to add on the dip.
Great time to buy this morning on a huge dip yesterday. Buying Delphi is a great move for the long term . Should show niec result in the 3rd quarter earning report.

Seem to have super resistance at $50 . However I believe the Oct 20th Calls are going to get exercised this time . I have a little Ford but this is the play for the Auto Sector . It rested while others caught up . I think we will blow through current expectations over the next 24 months . Should be a good demand for cars in North America after the storms . Rest of the world including Europe is picking up again . This is a strong company and the diversification into Hybrids and electrics has been progressing very well indeed .

I am quite perplexed by how hard this is selling off here despite consistent earnings and operation's growth over the long haul . Down already 13% from the high . With the computers they just pushem down shorting with more gunpowder then the little guys that buy into it . Where it reverses nobody knows except late in the year and will peak early Q2 next year . One thing about BWA is its in OEM and aftermarket . Maybe forget Indy and give the money to shareholders .
BWA is one of the best EV plays there is. Long term hold. They will be supplying numerous EV makers with components. No Brainer.

"BWA is a safe buy due to our current administration. Their love affair with EV's will create stocks like BWA, F, GM & TSLA to skyrocket. Fasten your seatbelts!"
Bought in today BWA is at the forefront of the electric revolution have a limit order in at the 2015 lows at 29 very cheap here
Bwa just jumped 3% in AH. Any ideas why?
"the ""summary"" page of this stock on yahoo finance says it is undervalued and has an estimated return of 39%."
"Great buying opportunity, 10% within 10 working days"
"Okay maybe selling early, but taking my gain from $25 two months ago. Still upset I missed out on this below $20! Love this stock though!! Also sold out my DLPH from $8 to $15. Will see what happens with markets over the next months. Good luck!"
Why is this still going down? Because of Delphi merger?
"just when it looked like this would go green, it dips in the final minutes. another consecutive red day. stop being so scared weak hands. the stock is extremely undervalued now and has a great future ahead."
going nowhere...fast!
"Like the new acquisition , this has been such a good stock for so long . This pullback has been steep but again even here at the new high it still has allot of upside to retrace old levels . This is a tech play , as well as alternative transportation play . The management and company are the real deal . Very pleased and though we may see a pullback going into the end of the next quarter from Thanksgiving to Easter it should rock and roll again barring a severe worldwide slowdown in vehicle sales . Great company and despite worldwide growth over the past few decades a nice balance sheet and so much more room to grow ."
Delphi obviously a bad move.

Another rough patch after latest earnings. Looks like they may have lost a bit of financial discipline in Q2 and also new CFO most likely getting all bad news out early under his watch. Expect to see it turn around later this year. Personally wish it would get back below $35 so I could take the inevitable ride back over $40. Still time.

"So, is this a ""breakout""? Finally getting above $50 and holding a while."
"It will be interesting to see what comes out of the the Garrett Motion (GTXMQ) auction on Dec. 18; BWA's most important competitor spun out of Honeywell. GTXMQ is a deep value play, largely dependent on how Honeywell treats payments owed to itself if it's successful in buying the business back. Recent SEC filings show they've been purchasing shares on the open market quite aggressively. BWA has the funding to build an everlasting moat in this field if it's able to acquire GTXMQ at a reasonable price IMO"

"See the Autoline interview with BorgWarner CEO/Pres. Fred Lissalde. Interesting stuff. they are going about vehicle electrification the right way. I have long thought that the real money to be made in the EV sector was through the Tier One component and system suppliers rather than through start-ups that are only making their first attempt at manufacturing.The electrification revolution is happening. For a long time that was far from certain. If we are in fact going to build tens of millions ov EVs per year the world will need real industries with the scale and engineering to do that reliably and profitably. BorgWarner has the resources in engineering, facilities, cash, connections, and experience to make that happen.This is a long term play. Expect lots of ups and downs along the way (See the latest chip shortage news) but I bet you wish now that you had bought Ford back when it was in the midst of reorganizing and sold in the $8 range."

My Reddit activists  PLEASE HELP RMO being attacked by shorts. Let’s CRUSH EM.  CNBC SAYS  on RMO which is being hailed as an $AMZN EV Delivery Van battery supplier. $BWA Large Investor also CLII is also in the play / same industry as $TSLA and $NIOPS: Up 7% So far THANK YOU.
What do you think about the investigation? Beware or good deal at $40 something?
Looks like those who sold calls for tomorrow at $47.50 are more then safe and can enjoy their extra earnings . This is still showing good support and should be a strong market performer over time . I really like this company and how their diversifying out constantly keeping up with the sector .
"We say we waste time, but that is impossible."

"What a spam board . BWA definitely a good company to invest in for the long haul . Price is ready to climb into auto earnings . While not that excited about the FUSO short distance delivery truck its a great start and I imagine those who need to deliver in big cities to commercial accounts will love it . 100 km on a charge needs to be tripled though in order to complete routes for 99% of local businesses . I imagine in very large cities over a million these might work now . BWA is into the best parts and growth in the auto business in combustion , hybrid and pure electric . Would not hesitate to average in a little here and there under $60 well spread out ."
"I'm Bullish on BWA and INTC to be a big benefactor in fur EV chip business (i.e building plants in AZ which will reap rewards), but (currently) bearish on the overall market going into the summer. Without a strong market this will take a while to realize decent returns. Luck to all and diversify!"

"Up in After market trading "" Yesterday, I dubbed the selloff in auto stocks "" car-pocalypse now,"" as shares of everything car related tumbled following disappointing auto sales. Shares of General Motors ( GM) and Ford Motor ( F)? Check. Auto-part makers like BorgWarner ( BWA)? Check. Used-car sellers like AutoNation ( AN) and CarMax ( KMX)? Check. Auto-part retailers like O'Reilly Automotive ( ORLY) and AutoZone ( AZO)? Oh yeah. So is it time to panic? Nope, says JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman and team, who use those exact words. ""No need to panic,"" they write. ""This is what a plateau looks like."" What do they mean by that? I'm glad you asked because Brinkman has four reasons: 1. Sales are not down that much: ""SAAR was softer than expected in March, but is tracking 17.2 mn YTD, not materially different than 17.3 mn in 1Q last year,"" Brinkman writes. ""We estimate the macro drivers of strong new vehicle sales remain in place, including record average vehicle age, a solid employment backdrop, consumer confidence near 13-year highs, and historically low gas prices."" 2. Car buyers still like trucks: ""[Regarding] passenger car demand, the shift in mix away from passenger cars in favor of trucks and SUVs is not a concern above and beyond the softer SAAR -- it is the silver lining,"" Brinkman explains. ""Richer mix is what has allowed average transaction prices (ATPs) to remain strong in the face of higher incentives."" 3. Incentives haven't been increasing: "" [Incentive] spending actually declined -1% m/m vs. February, despite a +2% historically expected seasonal increase,"" Brinkman says. 4. The increase in inventory was General Motors' fault: ""[Industry-wide] inventories tracked 72 days on hand vs. 65 a year ago, although most of this increase relates to GM, which had widely communicated a materially different than normal cadence of inventories throughout 2017, given the timing of new vehicle launches,"" Brinkman says. "" see article 3 22 17 about GM"
