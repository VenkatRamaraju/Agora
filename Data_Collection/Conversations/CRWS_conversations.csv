"This stock suffers from a ridiculous lack of coverage. P/E below 10, little debt, a 6+% div with low payout ratio. Long-term investors should check it out more closely."
You can never know the real price of this company by looking at yahoo finance
This sell-off seems unjustified. I am buying CRWS with both hands today.
"In my view, Trading Central is wrong in saying this stock is 11% overvalued. CRWS is a solid, high quality company that pays a great dividend."
great quarter should be over 8
The dividend for CRWS is excellent.
Special dividend means cash machine is rolling again. Dividend of almost 10% this year. Hopefully many more to come...
This might be a good buyout candidate.
"This stock is great, nice dividend, steady growth. Been a great little hold for a while."
Nice report. Year to year net income up 104%.Year to year sales up 14.99%. 5.8% dividend. Future looks bright.
Nice rise today!
Great report. Cheap stock and nice dividend while price recovers.
Do folks realize this stock CRWS typically pays a yearly dividend on top of the quarterly dividend reported on Yahoo Finance?
Boom!!! Turnaround is here. Should be a $12 dollar stock. Nice dividend while you wait. Jmho
love the price and dividend . be over 8 soon
"With a slowdown in Fed Rate Increase 5.64% yield on CRWS looks good as earnings are estimated at 75cents, while divvy is 32cents."
Someone wants in. Big volume today.
Company seems on track. To develop any European business with 75 new product intros can take it to another level.
"Great earnings results just announced, along with a special dividend!"
Almost 1 million shares traded. Some institutional holder must have wanted out. Likely a negotiated deal. Jmho
How’s my money market account ? Man this so slow never goes up or down
"It was the 3rd tranche that would have affected CRWS. They were only at the 2nd stage. This is indeed really good news as Chestnut spelled out during the conference call that on some products, due to material only coming from China, CRWS had no choice."
Need a pop to 8
Hit a new 52 week high today. Momentum is building for this turnaround... Secure dividend while you wait for the stock price to reflect the strong results. Great balance sheet as well. Way off the radar....
At least insiders aren’t dumping their shares.
Stock really perked up in the last hour of trading. Maybe news of a buyout leaked out? CRWS seems like it would be a nice acquisition for someone. Probably not much of a premium though
Agree that we will see price increase in about 8 months now!
Dividend back. Growth coming due to Covid.... stock is cheap. Jmho
stock holding steady 7.84 for three months side ways trading. think with revenues increase should pop to 8.80
Confirmed Wellington sold entire holdings. On sec site 13g filing.
"Other than a institution dumping and taking down the stock price, fundamentals placed on stock price are as strong as they have been going forward. Will be writing a Seeking Alpha article on the diamonds in the rough."
Cash machine. $0.32 dividend coming in December. Stock price way too cheap. Jmho
Nice earnings report. They are making great money. Dividend safe and likely additional special dividends coming. Jmho
"CRWS had nice earnings. Dividend is safe. P/E under 10. And the PPS was moving up nicely until a 120K block crossed (per TD Ameritrade) at a low price. After that, the trading was ragged and the PPS stayed down. I'm not sure what the company needs to do to get respect of investors."
Business should be booming in 9 months!!! Everyone stuck at home with nothing to do.....
Sleeper stock. Randall loves his dividends.
ps- folks don't even realize the extra stock that CRWS gives to Shareholders like clockwork every year. Puts the total dividend way over 6%.
all stocks pay dividends most make new highs like ko or pep. so I'm not worry about the price
Special dividend coming. Well-run company needs more attention than it receives.
Nice results! Dividend safe and turnaround moving nicely. Should be a $12 stock. Stock buybacks?
