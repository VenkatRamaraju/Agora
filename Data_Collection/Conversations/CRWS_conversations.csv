Cash machine. $0.32 dividend coming in December. Stock price way too cheap. Jmho
holding
stock holding steady 7.84 for three months side ways trading. think with revenues increase should pop to 8.80
Another big dump by institutional holder yesterday.
Confirmed Wellington sold entire holdings. On sec site 13g filing.
Business should be booming in 9 months!!! Everyone stuck at home with nothing to do.....
Insiders can dump their shares above 6 and apparently have no interest in buying below $4.50. Typical.
boring stock......... with revenues increasing and yearly divs. should be over 10should for forward split no volume here
Nice rise today in down market!
Nice rise today!
Anyone concerned about the affects of sears and toys r us on crws?
This might be a good buyout candidate.
Would be a good buyout candidate.
This sell-off seems unjustified. I am buying CRWS with both hands today.
great quarter should be over 8
The dividend for CRWS is excellent.
Hit a new 52 week high today. Momentum is building for this turnaround... Secure dividend while you wait for the stock price to reflect the strong results. Great balance sheet as well. Way off the radar....
10 times normal volume.
ps- folks don't even realize the extra stock that CRWS gives to Shareholders like clockwork every year. Puts the total dividend way over 6%.
Train leaving the station. This baby is cheap. No debt. Nice tuck in acquisitions being made. Earnings growth coming. JMHO
Goes faster down than up
"Close to 6% yield with earnings upgrade. Ridiculous valuation with only 2 more Fed hikes forecasted,"
Nice article on Seeking Alpha on the prospects of CRWS......
mj stocks heading up many closed high of the day
"Yep, punish those commies by destroying the profit margin of small American companies and forcing them to lay off workers. Putting productive farmers on the welfare rolls funded with our tax dollars is really a brilliant strategy to hurt browbeat China."
Stock holding nice price
May pop to 7 boring
Need a pop to 8
Nice report. Year to year net income up 104%.Year to year sales up 14.99%. 5.8% dividend. Future looks bright.
"Good quater, congratz on the team!"
I would not be surprised if someone saw greater value in this company.
It sees the holders of this stock are in isolation.
Someone wants in. Big volume today.
Forward Dividend & Yield 0.32 (4.13%)Add in the 2% stock dividend they give yearly and this CRWS yields over 6%. Would seem like there should be more of a following.
What is going with this company?Goes down every day and no news
love the price and dividend . be over 8 soon
Agree that we will see price increase in about 8 months now!
"This stock suffers from a ridiculous lack of coverage. P/E below 10, little debt, a 6+% div with low payout ratio. Long-term investors should check it out more closely."
Don’t think going pop more like timber to 7
I think we could go back to the 52 week high.
Sleeper stock. Randall loves his dividends.
Why is crws down 1.42% today WHEN THE DOW IS UP OVER 280 POINTS!!! is it because i bought more of it the other day???
"bought shares 11,731 form 4 filed"
Boom!!! Turnaround is here. Should be a $12 dollar stock. Nice dividend while you wait. Jmho
Do folks realize this stock CRWS typically pays a yearly dividend on top of the quarterly dividend reported on Yahoo Finance?
Up day when market is down on big volume.
Dividend zero
How come the chart history is gone ?
Company seems on track. To develop any European business with 75 new product intros can take it to another level.
How’s my money market account ? Man this so slow never goes up or down
"CRWS earnings tomorrow before the bell. Were the institutions smart to panic sell, trashing the price? Will the dividend hold?"
Dividend back. Growth coming due to Covid.... stock is cheap. Jmho
"With a slowdown in Fed Rate Increase 5.64% yield on CRWS looks good as earnings are estimated at 75cents, while divvy is 32cents."
Almost 1 million shares traded. Some institutional holder must have wanted out. Likely a negotiated deal. Jmho
Maybe CRWS will finally move back up now that China tariffs seem to have stabilized (until the next policy switch from Oval Office).
"Great earnings results just announced, along with a special dividend!"
At least insiders aren’t dumping their shares.
Nice earnings report. They are making great money. Dividend safe and likely additional special dividends coming. Jmho
What was so shocking about the fund dump is whoever did it panicked as the stock can be manipulated on light volume up or down. Certainly did their holders no favor by dumping a couple 1000 at once. A rookie move for sure for whatever reason.
Special dividend means cash machine is rolling again. Dividend of almost 10% this year. Hopefully many more to come...
Look on August 10th..........PUMP and soon..........DUMP.
Stock really perked up in the last hour of trading. Maybe news of a buyout leaked out? CRWS seems like it would be a nice acquisition for someone. Probably not much of a premium though
"Other than a institution dumping and taking down the stock price, fundamentals placed on stock price are as strong as they have been going forward. Will be writing a Seeking Alpha article on the diamonds in the rough."
Nice results! Dividend safe and turnaround moving nicely. Should be a $12 stock. Stock buybacks?
You can never know the real price of this company by looking at yahoo finance
"It was the 3rd tranche that would have affected CRWS. They were only at the 2nd stage. This is indeed really good news as Chestnut spelled out during the conference call that on some products, due to material only coming from China, CRWS had no choice."
Good earnings.
nice going hit 8 soon
China increasing tariffs really would hurt CRWS. But the long story is eventually China will have to give in as we have 1/3 the population with 2 times the GDP. The Communist tactics don't work on an even playing field. Temporary pain for long term gain.
This is dead stock owned by dead people
I wonder if this company has any suitors.
all stocks pay dividends most make new highs like ko or pep. so I'm not worry about the price
Anyone alive on this board?
"In my view, Trading Central is wrong in saying this stock is 11% overvalued. CRWS is a solid, high quality company that pays a great dividend."
Great report. Cheap stock and nice dividend while price recovers.
Special dividend coming. Well-run company needs more attention than it receives.
"Thumbs down, but no comment. Moran"
"CRWS had nice earnings. Dividend is safe. P/E under 10. And the PPS was moving up nicely until a 120K block crossed (per TD Ameritrade) at a low price. After that, the trading was ragged and the PPS stayed down. I'm not sure what the company needs to do to get respect of investors."
"This stock is great, nice dividend, steady growth. Been a great little hold for a while."
