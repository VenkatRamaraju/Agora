This might dip to $21.50 but I feel it will sharply rebound to $23 immediately within a week! Then I could see this going back up to $26-$27 in November easily. So I’m just gonna sit right here and just wait it out. I’ll get plenty of money if I’m patient!
Ice I can’t help but see some of your post and you clearly didn’t do your homework when you were talking to Bill yes HTZ did file bankruptcy but they didn’t go through with it do your homework yes they were delisted yes they changed their symbol but all stockholders were made whole! Don’t speak if you don’t know what you’re talking about it’s better to say nothing and look smart then open your mouth and remove all doubt!
Shorts are desperately posting nonsesne non-stop and I understand why: very soon cruise companies will ditch all the capacity restrictions and will start earning big money again. Carnival stock will jump to a new 52-week high in a matter of days.
"Ice, Robert, Robin, you’re really gonna act like you guys are brilliant when the stock is only down .18% give me a break talk to me at the end of the day!Ice why don’t you respond to your mistake about HTZ? Are you embarrassed?"
"The reason CCL is down in the premarket:Citi analyst James Ainley downgraded Carnival to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $24.50, down from $34. While he continues to believe in a recovery for the cruise industry, Ainley's comparative analysis of the pricing environment, ship pipeline, earnings quality, returns and valuation suggests that Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) will deliver more attractive returns to shareholders relative to Carnival. Carnival has delivered slower revenue and earnings growth over the last 10 years and its decision to exit older, less efficient vessels and smaller pipeline will limit its revenue recovery versus Norwegian, contends the analyst."
Well lookee there Robert we are green now how you like them apples? No response needed...................

Over back to green Robert I know you’re so concerned!
Oh ice you’re so wrong!
"Even if takes 5 years which probably will take much less for CCL to double from here, still 20% annualized gain and I guess there will be some dividends once they get to their full capacity."
"Many reasons to be excited!5-11 year old vaccinations in early NovMerck covid pill 90% of US based cruises will be sailing by Feb, full fleet by summerCDC issuing ""guidance only"" starting in JanAustralia cruses start in FebAnalysists forecast a positive EPS in 2022On average, analysts forecast that CCL's EPS will be $0.18 for 2022, with the lowest EPS forecast at $-1.04, and the highest EPS forecast at $0.74. In 2023, CCL's EPS is forecast to hit $2.05 (min: $1.51, max: $2.64)."

Ice why don’t you do your homework you’re definitely wrong about HTZ
"I just got off of the Carnival Elation cruise yesterday. Apparently it was the first cruise out since covid. Here's what I know.. they are sailing at 65% capacity. our ship maybe had 40%. It felt pretty empty. But it was clean!! (and I own a cleaning company) The workers cleaned constantly. There was one other carnival ship out and one Disney ship. On the beach excursion in the bahamas, the resort was approximately 75% full. Many of the shops were permanently shut down because they couldn't afford the rent during covid. Aside from having to wear a mask quite a bit, it felt near back to normal. It was quite enjoyable!"
"Carnival's marketing department is feverously working on the next rabbit they will pull out of the hat. For Princess, maybe more discounts on Winter travel for Carnival's most favorite passengers (Public School teachers). We'll certainly see another publicity stunt soon."
