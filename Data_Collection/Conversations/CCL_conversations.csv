green tomorrow?
1.2m shares sold in 2 mins of open..
A very positive earnings call today. I think there is a ways to go but I see $38 by June on next year.
Robert read the fresh article that just came out one minute ago on market watch. It ain’t going down from here slick Rick!
CCL leaving Galveston port are fully books
Sums up your knowledge. How's that working out for you!!! EnjoyEl Pez Gordo 2 days ago$CCL conversationAdded 4200 shares. Free money give away today!
No sir I will not be tricked into buying the stock at $25.94 that price is too high!
"Shorts were waiting for 18-20, all they've got was 23.42, not even enough to break even for most of them "
Keep squeezing the SHORTY…..they are ready to implode!!!!! CCL =$$$$$
Did I hear somebody mention my name about the goat Farm earlier?
"Cruises are gonna miss a significant component of cruisers - Canadians. While Canadians can now travel to the U.S. they need a PCR test to return home. Imagine taking a cruise and then one member gets infected and then what do you do? You are not allowed to fly home. So you need to stay in the U.S. But where? How many hotels will allow you to check-in when asked if you are sick? If I am wrong and it is not a disaster situation then someone can refute me on what a Canadian family does once a member gets a infected? Canadians make up around 10% of cruisers. And most unvaccinated Americans stillwon't be going on cruises due to restrictions on their movement, especially ports of call in many places in the Caribbean. Cruise lines simply have a much smaller current TAM. Now that everyone relauunching ships I expect prices and/or load factors will fall. The numbers been good only because of lower availability capacity and pent-up demand that is a blip. Just look at demand for resturants coming off the boil where many people ate out a lot after being cooped-up. sure restaurants still doing well, but much lower than the first few months after reopening because much of the pent-up demand has been satiated. Same will happen to cruises in 2022 especially if almost 40% of American's remain unvaccinated and if Canada continues to require a PCR test to come home."
"listen. . . 3rd quarter Revenue was $0.30/sh and 3Q net earnings was (-$2.00/sh). This is major loss and is unsustainable. CCL has $32 billion in debt. If 4% interest that is $0.30/sh. So, right now the revenue stream can barely cover the interest on their debt, let alone all the other expenses that they have. CCL is in big trouble."
"Why bother for short term, just using this to add more stocks to my portafolio and checking in a few months if not 1+y carnival will get back up its just a matter of when."
"seems like the stimulus stuff has slowed by necessityand interest rates are to move up more, maybe a lot more, eventuallyI am the last person to know if that's the case, but the fed is tightening going forward, it seemsthe debt will hurt them more if rates go up and they pay close to 2.5% (look it up)I just saw lower interest rate for them, but it seems I read on Guru Focus that it is around 2.5%could be wronganyhow, they have around $32B in debt in place to help beat them up"
Oceania Cruises Sets A New Single-day Booking RecordI assume this is negative news for the cruise industry too @Jeff?
Good morning did someone mention some goats? This hits $24 I will be getting 1000 new goats along with 500 new wives!
"OK, here we go, That report was just horrible, Refused to give $/share loss is very worrying. Revenue was lower than last quarter meaning that even if ships are sailing they aren't making hardly anything on these. Expenses going forward will be higher, All ships sailing again has been pushed out till 2nd half 2022 (was supposed to be end of year as per last quarter), see what you want to see in it, but that was an horrendous quarter and this will go lower once reality sets in. Pump and dump in action and again the little people buying here will be the bag holders. Again this stock price doesn't in anyway reflect the situation. Being valued as a company making billions of revenue a year and in reality losing 2 billion. Enjoy your inflated share price whilst you can. Even more bearish than I was Friday morning. Enjoy"
"Good to be collecting steadily on every dip, world loves cruises and nothing will change that."
"Big down day, CCL is only down 1.3%. Yup, this is the bottom. Back to $30 in no time."
El pez Gordo here’s to you and yours!
"Carnival bought 234,000 shares yesterday in their stock swap program"
"Trader ? Why did CCL drop on great financial news this AM at the open. Does not make sense? Market is up on govt budget extension , news is good for more ships coming on line Virus numbers are dropping Every thing is good What is missing ???Please no BS answers Tired of reading the BS on this board"
"Sums it up nicely. Enjoy.While there are some positive signs in relation to COVID in the U.S. and some reasonably good data from the cruise line industry, there's still a tough situation ahead. As part of its release last week, Carnival said that it burned $510 million per month in the third quarter of 2021, showing just how costly it is to run a cruise line that's still not at full capacity. The future of the cruise business really comes down to when customers will be comfortable traveling in even larger numbers. Carnival said that it was only operating at about 35% of its capacity at the end of August, so there's a lot of room for improvement. But management also expects to be at just 75% of capacity by June 2022, showing there's a long recovery ahead. Given the sheer cost of owning and operating cruise ships, this is an industry I will stay away from. Cruise stocks might have recovered nicely from the depth of the recession, but the business is still in shambles and will be for the foreseeable future. Today's pop is nice based on positive comments from the industry, but the reality is that fundamentals are still very weak, and until that changes I'll stay out of cruise line stocks."
Soon things are going to be normal !
8 cents 
@Ice Eh is @Jeff's alias # 73No legal threat. It is a certainty. Done deal and a very easy one at that.
"My personal experience on an 8 day Carnival cruise that just ended: staff executing mask wearing literally 100% everywhere always over nose and mouth and most wearing kn95, some were double masking. Go out in public and where else do you see hundreds of employees with this type of percentage? Guests mask wearing was on par with what you see in the general public (not great maybe 50-60%?) we were reminded numerous times daily but I didn't see staff single out anyone to comply. Cruise was fun and on par with precovid cruise enjoyment. Food and staff was top notch, perhaps slightly more upselling taking place than I remember before (encouragement to order from the bar, excursions, shops, photography) but nothing too pushy. Staff has 'watches' for contract tracing to minimize disruptions should covid spread among them. I really don't see any shortfalls for covid to enter aside from excursions, vaccinated and tested prior to disembarking but on excursions we are free to roam in the public and some ports were pretty populated in town and we are never tested again. Longer cruises may present some problems should the virus have time to inoculate and spread but overall I think things are well on their way to recovery."
Shorts are scared.
Today is the day that Mr. clean said that the stock would close under $22.50! We shall see!
Yahoo news - CCL launched the popular Princess cruise line on the west coast. January and February they will restart the CCL line with a huge agenda or ports. Read the news.
We should correct to 22 below
28 next week?
I heard about CCL the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Lots of options next Friday @$22.50. Don't think it will finish higher than that this week coming. Enjoy.
doesnt matter about fuel price going up.. This stock trades with oil . look at oxy. everytime oxy goes up with the price of oil this stock goes up. oxy is down today and oil is down and guess what. ccl is down
"90% of Carnival US based ships will be sailing by February. More families will be on-board once the vaccine for children is introduced shortly. ""Carnival Cruise Line announced plans for more ship restarts for January and February, as it works towards the return of its full fleet sailing from U.S. homeports in the spring of 2022, according to a press release.With 17 ships scheduled to be operating by year-end, Carnival Sunshine will restart from Charleston on Jan. 13 and Carnival Liberty from Port Canaveral on Feb. 11.With today's announcement, Carnival's U.S.-based operations will cover the following homeports and ships by February, and represents 90 percent of Carnival's U.S.-based capacity:• Galveston: Carnival Breeze, Carnival Dream and Carnival Vista• Miami: Carnival Freedom, Carnival Horizon, Carnival Sunrise and Carnival Conquest• Port Canaveral: Mardi Gras, Carnival Elation, Carnival Magic and Carnival Liberty (effective Feb. 11)• New Orleans: Carnival Glory and Carnival Valor• Long Beach: Carnival Panorama, Carnival Radiance and Carnival Miracle• Baltimore: Carnival Legend• Tampa: Carnival Pride• Charleston: Carnival Sunshine (effective Jan. 13)"""
"Carnival website: Carnival Corporation & plc To Provide Third Quarter 2021 Business UpdateMIAMI, Sept. 17, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Carnival Corporation & plc (NYSE/LSE: CCL; NYSE: CUK) has scheduled a conference call with analysts for Friday, Sept. 24, 2021, at 10 a.m. (EDT); 3 p.m. (BST) to provide a business update."
@Keith It was wonderful trade. Made $2400.00 in only a few hours. I would call that glorious. At least I actually own some CCL. You are just here as a paid basher and don't even own any.
I had to give back two of my goats back to the repossessor today. Please CCL save my village and help the stock go up to $30!
"SLOW, very SLOW grind up since July from around $20 to $26. If CCL will reach over $30 by EOY, will be a very positive long term sign. The high cruising season will start again in March 2022........and unless there is some nonsense about COVID, I expect CCL to reach old highs just prior to pandemic around $50.Be patient and you will rewarded....... COVID is BS and sooner than later the people are recognizing its over and is now nothing but a political tool."

"I get it, CCL had to take on major debt, but it will get back to pre-covid prices. It may be 12-18 months, but certainly probable. If they were to file bk, it would have been announced by now and fund managers wouldn't be buying."

Shorts are you ready for unlimited losses? Feels good... Stock is ripping and bulls in control...
"This may go up, may go down in near future. But we all know you're only here because it will be at pre-pandemic levels soon! 2022 here we come!"
I’m going on a Cruise Y’all!BUY BUY BUY!!!Guaranteed $70 in 2022!!!
I am Surprised with today's drop in price since holding up so good with yesterdays market dump.Any thoughts on why dropping today folks. Don't see any bad news etc?
"wow, my mistake, CCL had a $20B yearguess the cruise business was/is as big as the burger business"
"I’m riding this stock out until next summer. Some might critique this decision, but it allows me to ignore days like this and all the current manipulation in this sector. I truly believe all travel and hospitality stocks will be in a much better position by June next year."

"College football stadiums are full , how much longer do you think it will be before cruise ships are full too ? It doesn’t take a genius to figure that out , everything is opening back up ! Cruise on my friends "
It appears that we will be moving on up to the $24 mark next week! Normally October as a flat month for stocks but in this case with CCL I do see that this may outperform the rest of the market because the cruise line stocks have not recovered their losses and they will in the next coming months. It’s not about P&L’s it’s about sentiment and we all know after watching Gme amc and many other stocks that they can be game changers when you bet at the right time. I’ve placed my bet won’t you
El deez nuts Gordo Stop talking with your mouthful! It’s not polite! Go eat another Richard! You’re so good at it! Like my daddy always said find something you’re good at and never quit! If you do what you love you’ll never work a day in your life! And we all know this is what you love!
This is consolidation from all the people that bought when it had its mini spike. It's fine. We all know we had the previous wall of $24-25 back and forth for two weeks. If it stays above that wall and we build a new wall above $25.00 we're good!!! This is a great company to be a part of and very soon it will be profitable! $70+ on the horizon!
Thankyou nice drop added more.
We arent leaving!!! This is bound to recovery to $50+ and people know it!!!!
Time to add 6 months from now add a 10 spot to the current price.

91.7% of the posting on this board are originated from one of @Jeffs 72 alias's as of this morning.
People always talk about earnings and how it’s going to bring the stock down in 2 and a half weeks.......truth of the matter is is that ccl had only gotten better in the last quarter. How could it be worse we are actually cruising.
My friend had just came back from ccl cruise out from Galveston port.They are fully book.
Great global news this morning about relaxing travel restrictions. Shorts are very disappointed with minor losses today on big down market day.Looks like all of @Jeffs 72 personalities will be in big trouble. ENJOY!
"As much as I truly hate Robert, Jeff, and all the other negative shorts BUT I have to admit the stock has not done as well as I thought it would have. That’s all I’m gonna say!

"CCL should be more than prepandemic....with lesser interest rates, newer ships that are fuel efficient and have higher margins, improved capacity and reduction of low margin ships that they sold during pandemic. They are leaner and more fuel efficient.Not to forget the stake taken by Oil prince with reduced fuel costs."
I just purchased 10 shares to help my cost average $27 down a little
Just got 1700 shares. whose riding this train!!!
There is something wrong with el pez Gordo
"Cruising  is coming back with Covid-19 and its variants or not... this is going to be a slow and steady climb back up to the top. If you have the patience and the money, now is the time to start IMO."
Today was the last time you saw Carnival trading below 23. The climb to 30 and beyond is set to continue.
Long term buy! 2024 call options are the way to play thistheNolaDawg
YEEEEE HAAAAA……CCL to the moon BABY!We’re going to have SUM fun on CCL!!! Buy buy now!
Just sold all of my shares for a loss
28$ today
"Hedge funds will start piling in looking ahead 12 months. By summer ‘22, cash should be flowing in and recovery in tact. $32 is a fair target. Beyond that depends on debt strategy."
look at all the football games. no covid outbreak. the big lie is over. shorties cover now. you're welcome.
"Keep pushing this higher people, Need to short this for max profits, Technicals are getting worse by the day and this is going back to $20. Enjoy."
"This looks like a good play. Chart looking good and cruises starting back up. Like, what could possibly go wrong here?"
O that's smart. STRONG sell. lol. This stock does not like being below $25. At least you know you can HOLD at $23 to $25. And make a lot of money over the next year.
you really going to buy ccl with oil reaching 84 today ? come on man....
"Texas bans vaccine mandates for private businesses. Should this not impact CCL's vaccine mandate for its embarkation cruises in Texas? Of course, I am biased as negative on the stock price of CCL, but notwithstanding it is legitimate question. I am not even sure how CCL manages the mandate that disallows asking to vaccination status for guest in Texas."
All charts indicate major correction
"50’s by year end, and 70’s to follow in 2022! It’s going to be a GREAT YEAR FOR CCL!!! Buy now or be sorry!!!"
Covid on the rise ccl should correct to 21 soon
"Listen, the shorty McFLY is letting some big ones go because they really thought CCL would be at $17 or lower. The fact is CCL bookings are through the roof and recovery is eminent in the months ahead. BUY AS MUCH CCL AS YOU CAN BECAUSE $70 will show its face in 2022!!!!!!!"
I'm selling my 340 shares. this is inevitably going down to 20$ ish again. I'll buy back in when its lower
CCL @ $.75 cents a day gets us real close to $30.00 by Friday's close!
"Some perspective:Dec, 2019 CCL had debt of $11.0B and cash of $0.5B for net debt of $10.5BEnd of Q2 CCL had debt of $30.0B and cash of $7.0B for net debt of $23.0B.So net debt up 12.5B - That doesn't matter.And average interest rate way higher as CCL did some real high coupon debt during the Covid crash.And you can't just look at net debt, CCL now feels it needs to hold a lot of cash that generates zero interest income, but has debt that pays a lot of interest - very inefficient, but no choice as needs CASH liquidity.CCL still gonna burn billions the next 3 quarters. I will bet they will issue more equity after Q3 especially as stock recovered from summer lows and popped after Merck Covid treatment news."
"Yeah we're going green again! This is awesome consolidation! With the whole market red by a lot, we're staying afloat in a stock that has been hit so hard. This is what hope looks like! We're going back to normal and with normalcy, you will see prepandemic volumes on this stock! The ships arent going anywhere and are here to stay! 2022 will be a great year!"
"2 couples I had lunch with last Saturday recently (2 weeks) got back from one of the Carnival cruises that left from Miami. They had great times, said food, entertainment, and room service was fantastic. All the crew wore masks but maybe 1/3 of the passengers did but said no crew members said anything if you didn't have a mask on. The mask rules are ""recommended guidelines?, not requirements. They also said the onshore areas were pretty much mask-free. They are retired and have another cruise booked in November and March one to Panama and the other to Alaska."
0 buying pressure...
New CCL sleep POD cabins!Sleeping on a bed of CASH! Thank you CCL!!!Reserved only for LONGS!
"All cruiselines will going to be talking about much higher fuel costs coming up. Hello? You see what oil prices have done in the past 2 months - WTI gone up 20%. Worse, cruiselines burn the bottom residuals from refineries. These are low value products. However, with gas prices in Europe and Asia now more than double oil prices some utilities there will burn oil. Granted, only a very few can switch to oil, but you only need about 1 million barrels to make a huge difference to the price of bottom residuals (i.e., the dicount to WTI will be smaller) as power plants that burn oil tend to burn the gunk too. If the world consumes about 100 million barrels per day about (I think) about 15% would be residuals."
"It might be time to nibble on these cruise line stocks. With most of the disastrous news behind them, they're much closer to the bottom than the top."
Fantastic deals on cruises right now with 'lots' of availability. No problem hopping on at the last minute. What a deal with a 70% cap. You might have a blast but the shareholders will be left holding their bags.
"This stock has lost nearly $2 this week, whilst the stock market has gained nearly 1000 points. Good news isn't moving the stock anymore, financials are coming to the fore. Expecting this to get hammered with any market weakness and also just drift lower in between. Looking to make a long term investment around $16. Still think we see this within a few months, Enjoy."
This stock will close over $24 today .........do you know why? I know because my mama told me! EL Pus Gordo take a look at these 
"Who cares about the short term movements if you are a shareholder? Options, I can understand, but why buy the short dated options. I’d be looking out at the earliest to the 1/22s. Pretty sure this can recapture 27-30 by then. Delta already on the wane. Can’t see there not being a rotation back into travel / leisure at some point as what happened late last year earlier this year. It’s inevitable."
"If Bit Coin has the potential to be main line currency in the future, how can this work when the value fluctuations are so much? The main stream public will not take a gamble on their day to day wages being high one day low the next."
Sure has been in a range 22.00 to 23.50 latelyWith Dow down today dragging most stocks done CCL hit alsoI thought it would of gone above 22.50 today. Held up early but fell on the Dow going down
Oh the beauty new ship MARDI GRAS is a gem! Of course the new one coming ENCHANTED PRINCESS and 2022 DISCOVERY PRINCESS and also the CARNIVAL CELEBRATION. Travelers will want the NEW ships to explore and CCL is booking up! 2022 is going to take my $12 to the 70’s …..YEEEEE HAAAAAAAA!!!!
Ccl. Shorters are going down. Lol ccl is now on line for much higher stock prices.
"Did you cover your short??? Covid cure, stock moving up and to the right!!!"
I guess Mr. clean finally left the board since he predicted that this would go below $22.50 on Friday! Lol you definitely got that one wrong! It still hasn’t gone there yet you are sorry
yep another 20 just bought! Buy and Hold this! This will see ATH within a year!

believe your eyes. look at the football games. covid is over. this is third week of college football. no out brake. airlines are opening up.
"Shorty..,,CCL Is not a game…you trying to wack the price down with negative words and shorting the stock will only frustrate you….this is obvious. You need to start looking at the company as a whole and where it fits in with tourism and the present decline of covid deaths. Notice I don’t say covid cases as covid is here to stay just as CCL is. Bon-voyage shorty……we’re sailing."
"I recently invested $250,000 between CCL,CUK,NCL. I don't plan on selling until we get at least double from here. Make no mistake todays prices are a great buying opportunity. Glta"
"Just returned from Playa Del Carmen Mexico. We could see Cozumel pretty well everyday sitting on the beach. Noted several cruise ships coming and going everyday throughout the week, just to far away to see what companies. Also the tourist spot ""5th street"" was packed. Lots of masked and unmasked (50/50). Travel is on, people just enjoying being people."

"Markets up huge and still struggling to remain positive, Tells a nice story. Worth a short here for sure. Enjoy."
1/3 of our average volume in the first 25 minutes. We're slowing gaining traction and will be at ATH within a year! You'll read the comments about how it will take years to get back to $60.... I read those same comments when I was in at $9 a year and a half ago. Don't listen to them. The ships are back in the water and taking reservations! Buy and hold for a year and you'll be happy with your long-term (1+ year) gains!
Why ccl doing so bad compared to nclh?
I’m selling my entry point of $24.20 and I’ll buy when it goes back down to $21. I should’ve sold $27. I thought this is really going up to $30 looks like it’s doing nothing!
"I guess I should sell. Everyone of these shorts in here tell me to. No, I think I'll hold on to my shares. I do like it when shorty gets nervous."

"""Cruise ships will return to San Francisco with a record 127 port calls expected in 2022"" per CBS. People love taking cruises."
"Any news on the next dilution for this corporation? Oh, no news? Really? So tell us all how they're going to avoid it?"
"Carnival does not issue news releases when cruises are cancelled. Here are a few:Due to a full ship charter on Regal Princess on July 30, 2022, we will be cancelling the following cruises:• The Best of the Mediterranean 21-day cruise departing July 16, 2022 • Mediterranean with Greece Isles, France & Turkey 14-day cruise departing July 23, 2022• The Best of the Mediterranean 21-day cruise departing July 23, 2022• Mediterranean with Greece Isles & Turkey 7-day cruise departing July 30, 2022• Mediterranean with Greece Isles, Italy & Turkey 14-day cruise departing July 30, 2022• The Best of the Mediterranean 21-day cruise departing July 30, 2022So, Carnival found a better customer (full ship charter), and pulled the rug out from underneath hundreds or possibly thousands that had already booked. Management not only jerks around customers, but also shareholders."
"DAL trading down despite earnings beat because they said fuel prices up 60% YTD and 20% in just the past month so guided to loss again in Q4 despite bookings increasing with more business travel and huge pent-up demand for Europeans to come to US once allowed in November. Obviously, cruiselines have fuel issues."
I read somewhere many yrs ago that if you place a sell order at a very high price on your shares that they can't borrow for short selling the CCL.stock. Comments?
"What perfect earnings for the times, very good news!!"
"I don't want to discourage pandemic rebound trades, but do you realize that currently many travel stocks already have higher market cap than they had before pandemic due to dilution (including Carnival). It literally means they are all already overpriced since business hasn't returned to previous glory and they are all with huge debt now."
I live in puerto Vallarta next to the marina. Today I looked out my window and we had 3 cruise ships here. That’s the first time I seen that before covid started. The ships are going to be full with waiting lists.
Merck is applying for emergency approval of COVID pills. So there will be no more outbreaks on cruises.
Price target increased to $41. Outperform. Credit Suisse. Ben Chaiken who was on earnings call.
Not a good outlook.....
Moving up like it should.
"I honestly believe this stock will go up again. Before the pandemic hit, everyone I knew, (including myself) were booking, or leaving on a cruise; it's still the cheapest way to travel & visit different countries. I'll hold my 800 shares, & may buy more, when it drops further, to cost down my average of $28/share. Cruising will definitely make a come back next year."
El pezzy baby
"CCL should be sailing into the THIRTIES, there are many ""ocean cruisers"" with pent up demand for those midnight buffets! LOL."
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Thetraderguide.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
Who is selling as these prices ?! What the
"Since you never respond to this question @Jeff, @Robert @Kevin @Bill @Issay @Ice Eh (All the same person) I see you now moved further out your guarantee of CCL issuing more shares by February. Maybe they will or maybe they won't. You are usually 99.7% wrong anyway.I will ask once again, when are they going to announce filing for BK? I want to add a lot more shares to my portfolio but don't want to until you tell me when BK is guaranteed like you have lied about for 18 months.No response expected, again you tool. By the way are we still going to drop to $22.00 by Friday too?ENJOY!"
Well I just lost another $2000 on CCL!
Easy money  Buying a few shares here. Way oversold
CCL heading to the 70’s…..if you don’t own it…BUY NOW…..RIGHT NOW CCL =$$$$$
Keith - I’ve been waiting for 3 months for your $18 prediction to come true. I’m starting to think that maybe saying it over and over again on a yahoo board won’t actually make it come true. Who knows though.
As usual folks the negative Nelly’s are nowhere to be found I do believe the stock might finish above $24 today!
Volume is still beautiful! Keep it going! Back to $30 hopefully by next week and that'll be the new floor!
"CCL has gained 0.59% In Premarket Trading. To avoid making losses while trading, you need to get full understanding and knowledge of trading and holding"
Back to $31 this week. Will be 50 early next year. This is a great mid term hold! Buy now and hold!
"Carnival is about to teach their shareholders a very expensive lesson. You cannot lose hundreds of dollars each second (ask Josh for the calculations) while expecting to have your investment grow over the next few years. Carnival is running out of every bit of potentially good news (first ship to sail from San Francisco since the Gold Rush). Carnival will begin their dilution of shares at the tune of 100+ million dollars very soon. Carnival could have brought in 40 million more dollars if they had started the dilution a few days ago, and management is kicking themselves for not having started earlier."
As much as I would like to believe this is going to go up from here I get this feeling that this isn’t the end of the dip
"Oil doesnt doesn't affect shipping as much as you would think, will be passed along to the consumer!! just like the gas stations. This stock and many others that's being shorted due to the rise in Oil prices will recover quite well."
This pop in cruise stocks allowed me to short again. Stocks are ridiculously over-priced and expectations unrealistic. Debt has piled-up and interest expense a major additional burden. Watch for more equity issues after Q3 especially f stock prices stay around here. People got excited about CCL CEO saying Q1 cash flow neutral. He was talking operating only - not after CAPEX. So I think CCL still going to burn lots of money even into Q1. They say bookings as good as 2019 and prices higher - did prices go up enough to account for huge inflation of costs since 2019? Hello...food costs. Hello... oil prices way up. Did well shorting it last time - This pop gave me a second chance.
