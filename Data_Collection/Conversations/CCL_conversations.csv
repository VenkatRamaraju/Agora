So you're worried about covid on a cruise ship. How many cases are linked to the Mexico boarder crossings? The media doesn't even touch on the subject but they continue to think a cruise is going to bring the end of the world. Hmmmmm. Crazy world we live in.
"Charts have turned bullish, now the real buying will start. Shorts are fried"
"Robert, your spamming on here makes it obvious that youre short on this stock. A word of advice, nobody cares"
And Robert by the way I’m not selling until this thing hits $30
This will go up to $25 today!
Close above 23 today. There's no reason whatsoever for this stock to trade lower that 30. This anomaly will be corrected very soon
I bought 200 puts $24.5 expiring tomorrow. WE ARE GOING TO WAR PLAY <3
"+XPLast week I wrote that ""a close below 21.89 would call for a test of the lows."" Well, Thursday closed at 21.66 and CCL did not take the death plunge. This is the third weekly rebound after three weekly swings down. The upside volume is still anemic but CCL seems to have a bid to it on the dips. Today I added to my modest long position at time 11:38 CDT and raised my GTC sell stop. The June 2/ June 8 double top which broke down on June 10 coincided with the 3rd quarter and new moons. I believe the rally in CCL will start 23 Aug after the full moon of Sunday 22 Aug. Upside to Mid/Late September. For all of you news junkies, don't be surprised if the CDC and /or CCL make some sort of major announcement over the weekend. Sill cautiously bullish with sell stop below.Peace."
"I just returned from my SECOND Carnival Cruise since the 3 July restart. They are sailing at 70% occupancy. They DO require 95% vaccinated and DO require a negative COVID test for 100% of passengers. Masks are required when entering the Dining room, using elevators and attending large gatherings. Thank you CCL for the free $200 On Board Credit for being a stock holder and I have TEN future cruises booked. There is demand, and thank goodness that the negative anti-vaxer's aren't part of the Carnival FUN! Cruising is back."
"Cruises in Europe are going at 100% occupancy and no tests are required for fully vaccinated passengers. In the U.S. they are switching to 100% occupancy already next month. Only Australian branch is not sailing yet (only 3 ships). Let's see how much profit Carnival will make in the 4th quarter (September, October & November). It's really possible for them to return to profitability that soon if they manage expenses well"
410 ships already sailing with another 190 joining this month involving 90 cruise lines means that 50% of the global fleet will be sailing by the end of August. Source: cruise industry news.
Where are you at Jeffy?
"Sinve July 19th , several higher highs and higher lows , on verge of a break out. Afollow through tomorrow should force a squeeze."
This news will finally drive the shorts away hopefully. And better yet give some chance to buy somemore travel stocks.
CCL has broken through the $24 mark . 2nd time of late it went as high as $24.50 plus. This is one tough stock & saw very low 20s. This stock may see $25 plus. Any good news & who knows
I assumed to soon Am I seeing a break out (Hopefully) hit 24.49 just enough to have a new high.Every one buy some shares and this keeps going
"You got to love Longs trying to justify an impossible position. Facts are CCL said 2 conference calls ago 100% of ships would be in the water come end of 2021, Last conference call it went down to 75%. Chances are it will be below this number come year end.Europe is shut for most cruise lines, UK are only doing around UK staycations that will end very soon as summer is finished. Plus they are giving away cabins at the moment as no demand for cruising here.USA Hurricane season and with Alaska season ending soon. Plus all the troubles being reported by passengers at the moment, covid on board, costs, (so many negatives) You won't see much demand up to year end. So basically this year is dead to the cruise lines, Southern hemisphere pretty much closed also so all these ships would normally head there so no revenue here either.At the very best CCL will be profitable again end of 2022, but that is looking like a big IF. Losing money quarterly, no dividends, expect these levels to be the highs for the next 6-9 months.(P.S) Bought @ $8 sold @ $29.90. Will buy back in when the company reflects it's correct share price. Presently $16 is generous and fully expecting this to go lower as the year goes on. A company that if you bought it today with 2 billion loses per quarter. Being valued (enterprise value) more than when it was turning over 20 billion revenue in 2019 with 3 billion profit per year is very overvalued. It will be pumped and dumped but will settle somewhere between $10-$15 within the next 9 months. Enjoy."
$40 end of October
"Larry Elder might get elected in the California recall, if that happens he's removing all mandates and restrictions which could help the cruise industry there."
Where is that wonderful analysis Keith?
"50% occupancy is enough for cruise lines to have POSITIVE cashflow. Just facts:""What occupancy does Royal Caribbean Group need on its ships to be at a break even point for cashflow?Somewhere between 35 and 50 percent, depending on the ship, according to Jason Liberty, executive vice president and CFO. “The ships are accretive to us around that 35% to 50% mark,” he said, on the company’s second quarter earnings call. “And obviously, the newer, larger ships are closer to 35%. And older, smaller ships are closer to that 50%.” Ramping up operations in the last few months, Liberty also noted the company is that after a few weeks of getting ships up and running, they get to occupancy levels “in which the ships are accretive to our overall cash position.”"""
Where are you Keith where are you Robert? No response needed we know! Lol
who listens to the CDC anymore?
How are those puts doing robert? You should be thanking us for trying to warn you. Best of luck!
I find it interesting but puzzling why the $24 area is becoming such strong resistance level.Also seeing the last 2 highs are slightly lower than the 8/25 high (lwr Highs) normally not a good sign ?? What is the thoughts of the group? Todays pop and give back of 50% thinking should trust chart and take some profit and play again next week ??
I just want to say I was happy to make a donation to CCL Robert!
"For those asking “where are the bashers today?” Let me explain. The reason we are not seeing bashers today (as much as usual) is because the volume is high. The people paying these bashers are not going to pay them to post here when the volume / movement is out of the control of the market maker. This is why you don’t see them posting as much today, because they’re not getting paid to. They get paid to post when the volume is so low that the market makers can take advantage of bid ask spreads and manipulate the share price down to make better entry points. I tease Robert and Keith about how much money we all would’ve lost if we listened to them and about how much they have theoretically lost, but they haven’t. They haven’t lost because they’re actually long on the stock. They bash because their bosses tell them and pay them to. They’re not going to pay them to bash when the buyer volume (shares traded) is so high that they can’t manipulate the stock. Simple. Remember when we ran up to $32? The bashers vanished completely. Gone. It’s simple. It’s clockwork for these guys. Take advantage and capitalize of the fear of retail traders. I’d say smart, hats off to them, but they’re unethical. They lie and exaggerate to spread FUD which is a scummy thing to do.GLTA"
"If the reversal occurs, it’s gonna make a really strong chart."
28$ next week
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Thetraderguide.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
"Europe is completely open for cruises which are allowed at 100% capacity. Costa Cruises (Carnival's Italian subsidiary) has 9 fully booked cruises in August, 19 cruises in September, 32 cruises in October, 40 cruises in November and 45 cruises in December. In Europe vaccination rate is close to 75% and there's no test requirements for fully vaccinated passengers and no limit on how many unvaccinated passengers can go on a cruise. Guess what? Carnival is going to make more money in Europe in the forth quarter than it did in 2019"
It’s so easy to manipulate a couple of shares after hour. We just can’t stop institutions dumping CCL tmr once markets open! LOL
Where are you at Robert and jeff?
Market looks 6 months ahead. Looks good to me for a bit of a pop here and over the next several trading days.8/26/2021 $23.65 1:00PM EDT
"Rick at the Motley Fool today: ""Carnival's reputation is taking on water, and not just because a passenger died. Why was she left in Belize with her family having to finance her return back to the U.S. to receive better care that came too late?""Well Rick, even before the Pandemic cruise lines wouldn't assist passengers that became sick. EVERYONE should have a form of travel insurance, and in CCL's defense that passenger had the opportunity to purchase it from CCL directly prior to the cruise. It is sad that a passenger died, but in NO way is this CCL's fault."
This is the next big short squeeze! Going to $25 by the end of the day
$38 End of September
I’ve got one thing to say I’m glad I am not Robert!
"9% of the float sold short, 74 million shares vs 13% of the float for GME and 17% for BBBY. CCL could be the next short squeeze target. Would be fun to watch the stock at 40 and all the shorts burned to ashes."
CCL is worth holding 5 years at least.
