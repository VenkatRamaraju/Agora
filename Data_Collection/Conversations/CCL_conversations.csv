"Hedge funds have increased their bearish bets against CCL lately, now CCL is a perfect candidate for a massive short squeeze. It will not go unnoticed at WSB. The hedgies will be ruined in a matter of days. Hold onto your shares, the show is coming any day now."
$32 by end of September $
410 ships already sailing with another 190 joining this month involving 90 cruise lines means that 50% of the global fleet will be sailing by the end of August. Source: cruise industry news.
"Europe is completely open for cruises which are allowed at 100% capacity. Costa Cruises (Carnival's Italian subsidiary) has 9 fully booked cruises in August, 19 cruises in September, 32 cruises in October, 40 cruises in November and 45 cruises in December. In Europe vaccination rate is close to 75% and there's no test requirements for fully vaccinated passengers and no limit on how many unvaccinated passengers can go on a cruise. Guess what? Carnival is going to make more money in Europe in the forth quarter than it did in 2019"
So do we sell all the shares Monday morning with the carnival vista have a big covid outbreak with their crew. Will there be another pause
"9% of the float sold short, 74 million shares vs 13% of the float for GME and 17% for BBBY. CCL could be the next short squeeze target. Would be fun to watch the stock at 40 and all the shorts burned to ashes."
CCL is worth holding 5 years at least.
Where is that wonderful analysis Keith?
"Listen Shorties, 190 cruiseships cruising by month end! BOOM!"
Princess Cruises Successfully Completes First Voyage Following Extended Pause in OperationsGreat news :)
CCL is accumulating nicely and I suspect it will go up to $40 by October ‘21
"The CDC warning vaccinated people not to take a cruise, won't make any difference. CCL's heading for restructuring anyway."
Carpe Diem CCL! 190 cruise ships will be sailing by the end of August!
Calm Waters for the cruise industry going forward! Longs are going to be BANKING!
"Think about this for a second: Everyone on board has to be vaccinated and test negative before boarding. They still found 6 people who tested positive. Only one had ""mild symptoms."" But they still ENDED THE CRUISE immedately and sent everyone home from the Bahamas. How is cruising supposed to restart under these conditions? $CCL $NCLH"
AAAHHH so nice to see shorts finally take a good old fashioned beatdown.
"Hold tightly onto your shares, we'll be over 30 in no time!"
"CCL is turning technically bullish. We broke above 5 day sma at 21.50, and will close around 22.50 today, above 10 day and 20 day sma. That's when real buying and covering will start."
"27 tested positive on a carnival first voyage. thanks to carnival for abiding FL, DJT wanna be, misinformed governor."
BREAKING CRUISE NEWS - NO VACCINE NO CRUISEThe Bahamas just said all passengers on a cruise ship wishing to visit will need to be fully vaccinated. This includes all the cruise lines private islands.So any family's with kids over 12 won't be sailing. Enjoy.
"Monday's playbook - Lots of volatility in Carnival's share price. CCL will open down, and then have a slight increase as some speculators see lower prices as a buying opportunity. Shares will trend downward for the day losing anywhere from 2% to 7% in value. Eventually, rating agencies will downgrade Carnival shares (possibly on Tuesday or Wednesday) which will bring prices into the teens."
Expecting upgrades to follow! Should run up to $25 at the very least! https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/fund-scooped-up-amc-stock-bought-tilray-carnival-sold-alibaba-51627491094?mod=mw_quote_news
The best deal money can buy CCL will go up to $40 in a couple of months!
CCL is going up to $45 by September 25! Market down write it down I don’t care what you do just prepare!
"Vaccines don’t stop the virus, just make the symptoms less severe. Everyone is going to be infected. People are fed up with the vaccines, and mist recent data show you need a shot every 3months. No one will have it. The only sensible thing is to give up. Live normal lives, and just suffer the infection. Some will die, most will live. In time, the virus will blow off its steam and just vanish. Does this give travel/leisure companies a fighting chance. Not with present ownership. But you can always buy the new stock when the industy rises from the ashes."
When full FDA vaccine approval comes next week - BOOM up she goes !
Boarding the Mardi Gras tomorrow afternoon. Let’s gooo
"Carnival beginning to cruise is not the good news. Now, is when problems begin to occur which takes the wind out of its sails."
We are about to go much higher very SOON! CCL temporarily added the covid testing & indoor masking to their Vaccinated cruises to prevent CDC from shutting them down again! Brilliant Move! The recent CCL crash was a result of the uncertainty about how DELTA would affect them! LOOKING GOOD! :)
"Vaccines are effective, stock will rise very soon"
I’m not worried at all.. I have 25000 stocks in total but never gonna sell a stock till 30.
$38 End of September
Sub $20 coming I think 
Buy on the dip
"Cruises in Europe are going at 100% occupancy and no tests are required for fully vaccinated passengers. In the U.S. they are switching to 100% occupancy already next month. Only Australian branch is not sailing yet (only 3 ships). Let's see how much profit Carnival will make in the 4th quarter (September, October & November). It's really possible for them to return to profitability that soon if they manage expenses well"
One of the best deals out there right now CCL!
"shorts better cover, this may squeeze to 50 tomorrow"
"Feel better about yourself get vaccinated, COVID is not a scam the vaccine works.Only shorts would say different."
Over 25 by Friday storming the 50 day sma. It's inevitable
"Booked a fully vaccinated cruise with Princess. Literally I found out today, a few days before cruise, that I need a covid test admin. 3 days prior to my cruise at my expense. I need this in addition to my vaccination card Lastly, we were not supposed to have to wear a mask on a fully vaccinated ship and now we will have to wear one fully inside. I am selling my Carnival stock as long as the CDC and liberals are running this country."
"Yesterday in the U.S., only 145,000 new Covid cases with 25,000 occurring in Florida. Additional cost of required Covid test = less cruise demand = increased costs = lower share price. Simple math."
"let's go,im "
Hey El puisey for $5 I can make you holler just buy 2000 shares of ccl!
"So far this morning according to the paid posters report our resident basher, pumper and paid poster has posted 19 times this morning already and the market has not even opened.Here is the break down of his 19 posts6 @ 1.154 @ 3.105 @ 2.704 @ 2.15Total Earnings as of 6AM $41.40As you can see he has great incentive to do what he does. I'm sure he never lies so you should believe him."
People are dying of Covid that took the vaccine cruise line will have no choice but to close operations soon sell and stay away
"Yeah I have to agree with you issay about Robert won’t be here when the stock goes back up. Neither will bull’s-eye, or Keith. None of them have any nuts they all run away when the stock goes up remember how when it was at $19 and they said it was going to go down to 15 maybe even $10 and then they got burned like hell when it went up to $24. They’re always wrong always and I mean always wrong! This variant will die down soon enough. I’ll bet everything I own they don’t shut everything down again I assure you if you believe in that go ahead and plan on moving back into your parents house!"
"CC Royal Caribbean: Delta Looks “Manageable”; 92% of People on Ships Vaccinated“Now, the Delta variant is problematic for everyone, but even this looks manageable by our extensive protocols. It’s too early to draw definitive conclusions, but the vaccines are the ultimate weapon, and they work,” Fain said during the call.""“The idea is to limit the spread of COVID-19 aboard our ships. We all know it’s impossible to eliminate cases onboard a ship totally, just as it is impossible to eliminate cases on land. But the steps we are taking are designed to prevent the isolated cases from becoming an outbreak. And it seems to be working,” Fain said.“Our experience shows that while there are breakthrough cases aboard, the vaccines help keep them contained. In fact — and I thought this was quite unusual – in most of our positive cases, even the cabin mate of the infected individual has tested negative.”--------------While it wasn’t made clear if the 92% average figure applies to passengers only or everyone on the ship, it is below the threshold to be considered a “fully vaccinated” cruise by the CDC. That threshold is 95% of passengers and 98% of crew. At that level, rules surrounding masking and distancing are relaxed by the CDC.Despite that, the high vaccination rate (for comparison, just 49.7% of Americans are fully vaccinated) is benefitting the safe return of cruising so far. There have certainly been cases on cruise ships, but the spread appears minimal."
"I bought bntx last year at 50 bucks with high risk and it brought big money this year. At this moment, I trust ccl will bring me the same big money very soon."
"Thank you fake inexperience SHORTS, because of you will go much higher. Short squeeze is around the corner. Hahaha"
"@ Everyone - So, I’ve done some research after recent conversations with some of the common bashers on this finance board. I found it strange that they would always be out in full force on days that are red, but nowhere to be found on green days / bull runs. Also, how none of them will ever disclose their entry / exit points, or investment thesis. Large market makers hire these people through third party employers to spread fear on red days. The ‘basher’ will create several different accounts and spam a single finance board in order to influence short term retail traders. They do this to theoretically drive the SP down and build on the fear that it will continue to drop, in order to buy more on the oversold days. Notice how they are not around on high volume days - this is because the market makers that are hiring them have far less sway over the share price, therefore these bashers have no influence. These people obviously get paid very little for this as it is not super effective, but it works in some instances. So, in summary, market makers / institutions will hire third party employers to manipulate the market in almost any way possible, in order to take advantage of the fear in retail traders. This is seen on specific finance boards. this typically takes place on recovery / growth stocks that are largely impacted by FOMO / FUD. So, on days you see the bashers posting seemingly non stop, just know it’s likely that institutions / market makers are scooping up shares on those days. It’s actually likely that these bashers are long on the company, and are taking part in these activities for personal gain."
The bad news just keeps rolling in. Enjoy.CRUISE NEWS - MORE CRUISES CANCELLEDThe Celebrity Summit has cancelled 4 of it's first cruises out of the US because of a rule by the CDC. Will more ships be forced to delay cruise start as well?
"To the bears, if you have a gambling problem call 1-800-gambler "
Shorty is wetting themselves trying to figure how they will cover now that longs are capitalizing HUGE!!!
"Good day for Cruise, Airlines, Hotels all popping up accros the boardAll points to bottom may be in as folks are moving on"
We will see $30.00 share before the end of the year.
Best Buy out there! CCL!
"I’m just wondering why these nervous bulls here didn’t invest in RCL or LUV??? At least, nationwide flights are essential!! LOL"
$40 end of October
$30+ NEXT WEEK.
"This is your chance to get in. FDA Approval, whether you like it or not, will make these travel stocks soar back to pre pandemic levels!"
Pent up demand for cruising will explode this year and next couple of years. And with brand new ships like Mardi Gras there will a long wait list. Stock is down now because of the media again trying to stoke fears up on the delta and shirts are taking advantage. This will double this year.
I don't get why people say that carnival is going to collapse but it has been rising
"Hawaii Travel Advisory:""John De Fries, president, and CEO of the Hawaii Tourism Authority noted that even though visitor arrivals overall are already starting to decline, as is historically the case in the fall, visitors should consider postponing their travels to Hawaii saying, ""Our community, residents and the visitor industry, are responsible for working together to address this crisis. As such, we are strongly advising visitors that now is not the right time to travel, and they should postpone their trips through the end of October."" To translate, Carnival and other cruise lines will be diluting shares soon."
Robert..Dean..Jeff...Max...Same person ? Or just the latest sleaze shorts crawling out of their beds...
Cruise lines are done.
Ccl was once a $60 stock....and once CCL able to control covid on it ships then it can go back to $60 in not time.Buy at any opportunity everyone can.
CCL hasnt gone below $20. Lets hope this is the trading low.
"If the oil prices drop it should make cruise stock more lucrative not less and also China’s lockdown is concerning because they don’t have access to Pfizer and sinopharma is not that affective. Market is really funny to not understand businesses , most of the traders r just going on sentiment not fundamentals - and it continues :) I’m buying the dips"
Where are you Keith where are you Robert? No response needed we know! Lol
"Shorts are posting daily that at 70% occupancy Carnival is loosing money. That is simply not true: ""What occupancy does Royal Caribbean Group need on its ships to be at a break even point for cashflow?Somewhere between 35 and 50 percent, depending on the ship, according to Jason Liberty, executive vice president and CFO.“The ships are accretive to us around that 35% to 50% mark,” he said, on the company’s second quarter earnings call.“And obviously, the newer, larger ships are closer to 35%. And older, smaller ships are closer to that 50%.”"
"market is at a all time high. Afghanistan , surging covid. ccl staff having covid on the last cruise, market is due for a pull back which will drag ccl to 19 or 20.... Dont risk it now,too risky to buy. Just wait a little."
"GDTA,Hedge funds are accumulating CCL stocks tight now in massive volume,The distribution stage is over,Retail investors aren’t selling ,it’s practically MM and hedge funds same office multi shorts desks buying and selling from each other,"
The re-opening trade is dead for now and the Cruise Lines and Airlines are showing proof of that FACT.
"50% occupancy is enough for cruise lines to have POSITIVE cashflow. Just facts:""What occupancy does Royal Caribbean Group need on its ships to be at a break even point for cashflow?Somewhere between 35 and 50 percent, depending on the ship, according to Jason Liberty, executive vice president and CFO. “The ships are accretive to us around that 35% to 50% mark,” he said, on the company’s second quarter earnings call. “And obviously, the newer, larger ships are closer to 35%. And older, smaller ships are closer to that 50%.” Ramping up operations in the last few months, Liberty also noted the company is that after a few weeks of getting ships up and running, they get to occupancy levels “in which the ships are accretive to our overall cash position.”"""
I’ve change my mind now I’m going long......After seeing all the media coverage of people vacationing and seeing the most recent successful cruise been completed I can’t help but think things are about to get better for CCL!
"I just returned from my SECOND Carnival Cruise since the 3 July restart. They are sailing at 70% occupancy. They DO require 95% vaccinated and DO require a negative COVID test for 100% of passengers. Masks are required when entering the Dining room, using elevators and attending large gatherings. Thank you CCL for the free $200 On Board Credit for being a stock holder and I have TEN future cruises booked. There is demand, and thank goodness that the negative anti-vaxer's aren't part of the Carnival FUN! Cruising is back."
MARDI GRAS = Giant New Carnival Cash Cow for at least 10-20 YEARS!
Already 4 million in volume and haven’t even been open more than 10 minutes!
"We lose 150 - 250 per day from the common flu in the US. COVID numbers are now about the same, and will slowly decrease over time. Time to turn off the news profiting from fear and live again."
This will rebound!
There is no better investment than carnival cruise lines! This could change your life and make you a millionaire overnight! Buy as much as you can you will thank me later!
"More Red tape for cruise lines to encounter going forward. Enjoy.(CDC site Covid -19 updated Friday)Breaking cruise news. The CDC has released new guidance calling out people who should not cruise right now regardless of vaccine status. These included those who are older, those who are obese, and those with other comorbidities."
Remember folks….The UK isn’t in the EU anymore and international travel has already started from the UK with Italy and Greece being the latest countries to open up.Want to cruise in Europe and the Med? Come to the UK.
All indicators point that they should close above $27 by the end of the week! GLTA!
Dont you love it when Motley Fool tries to bring down ccl and the stock goes up.
CCL doing fine!! Stay long and watch this stock again begin to climb higher.Looking at 30+ SOON! jg
Let’s remember 18 months ago this was a $52 stock!
"Here's the reason for the recent selloff in cruise stocks. However this is a sound advice from CDC and a good news, because bears where expecting a much harsher reaction from CDC, but it's a simple advice not to travel for people who would not travel anyways:Aug 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday people at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 should avoid travel on cruise ships, including river cruises, irrespective of their vaccination status. Older adults and people with medical conditions are more likely to get severely ill from the disease and should take professional advise before cruise ship travel, the agency said."
A co-worker in Florida wife works in a hospital near Fort Meyer. She claims admission for covid is no greater now than 4 months ago. Very low. Where is this negative news coming from? Obviously some media sources have us thinking doom and gloom.
It must be scary shorting a recovery stock. So much potential
CCL has broken through the $24 mark . 2nd time of late it went as high as $24.50 plus. This is one tough stock & saw very low 20s. This stock may see $25 plus. Any good news & who knows
cruising is going to be the core of all vacations. it's becoming more and more popular among families. just give it a little time until this crisis passes by.
How are those puts doing robert? You should be thanking us for trying to warn you. Best of luck!
No Robert today quite as a mouse lol!
Good day for buying Put options. Thank you shareholders!

"**NEW ALERT** TIME TO BUY SOME MORE CCL!190 Cruise Ships Will Sail in August as Industry Restart Continues August 03, 2021 Cruise Ships Sailing in August UpdateThe cruise industry's accelerated restart is continuing in August as 190 cruise ships representing 65 different brands will operate with guests aboard, according to the August 2021 edition of the Cruise Ships in Service Report by Cruise Industry News.The 190 ships represent over 275,000 berths at full occupancy.

CCL is back @14 in October!
"You are literally watching stock squeeze everyday. SPCE, AMC, GME, CDIM, ANY, SKLZ, and hundreds more that have so much less value than #$%$s only a matter of time before we go back to $70. Think about all the times you ran after a squeeze, how about just buy and hold this and wait. This will be a great value and you know it, you're just scared to wait."
"I don’t know what I would do without the help of (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Their watchlists are so well researched and help me make the best possible picks when it comes to investing. Not only do they save me time, but their advice has shown to be tried and true!"
This time! Hopefully CCL sells enough empty boats to pay for massive lawsuits in order to avoid bankruptcy! 
"By the end of the year 90% the Carnival fleet will be cruising at 100% occupancy. In Europe and in the U.S. With all the current test, mask and vaccine requrements cruising is safer than staying at home. Even unvaccinated 90 year olds will not hesitate to get aboard. CCL is posed to turn in profit already next quarter, a thing which nobody expects. This thing will go back over 30 by Jan 1st."
Bankruptcy at this point is a major play stay away Covid on the rise people are getting it now with vaccines stay away
"woman on a CCL cruise contracts covid onboard, flown from Belize to US hospital where she passed from the virus"
"Robert, your spamming on here makes it obvious that youre short on this stock. A word of advice, nobody cares"
With my earnings I plan on buying a 7-Eleven so I can sell Slurpee’s all day!
"July 20 (Reuters) - Carnival Corp said on Tuesday it expects to have resumed cruises with 65% of its total fleet capacity by the end of 2021, betting that concerns over a resurgence in COVID-19 cases will not deter holidaymakers.The company also said its Carnival Cruise Line brand has plans to bring back its entire fleet into service by the end of 2021, which would take total operating capacity to 75%.Cruise operators began sailing from U.S. ports in June with mostly vaccinated passengers and crew on limited capacity, but a few on-board infections and rising infections in U.S. states due to the Delta variant of the coronavirus has raised worries that the recovery for the cruise industry could be delayed.Eight of Carnival's nine brands have so far announced plans to resume guest operations on 54 ships around the world. The company said more restart announcements are due in the coming weeks."
"A cliff down or CCL is going to melt down little by little from here. 22 tmr, 21 on Wednesday, 20 on Thursday then 19 on Friday! We’re so grateful still at the peak! CCL is too far away from essential! LUV is a great buy @43 tho!"
"I’m back from VACA! Wow the cruising will take off now! Hold on shorty, you’re going for a little ride!!!!!BUY BUY BUY!"
28$ next week
Traders with suicidal tendencies are welcomed to short Carnival today.
"Unfounded fears created a great buying opportunity here. Covid will not go away any time soon, but vaccines made it even less dangerous than a common flu, any variant of it is not life-threatening for a vaccinated person. This new delta wave will not affect significantly the cruising business. It will make some elderly unvaccinated people decide not to travel, so what? 90% of the Carnival fleet will be cruising in a few months, at 100% occupancy. They will return to profit much sooner than expected"
"Yep here we go. If you have a CO morbidity then you can no longer, engage with other people. diabetesObeseAutoimmune diseaseCanceror ANY other health condition that puts you at risk..You can't take a cruise, fly, travel, no public transportation, no going to indoor or out door gatherings When enough of our freedoms are taken away maybe people will wake up.."
Are you smothering under my big black #$%$ Robert? Let?s talk about CCL debt ?
"You got to love Longs trying to justify an impossible position. Facts are CCL said 2 conference calls ago 100% of ships would be in the water come end of 2021, Last conference call it went down to 75%. Chances are it will be below this number come year end.Europe is shut for most cruise lines, UK are only doing around UK staycations that will end very soon as summer is finished. Plus they are giving away cabins at the moment as no demand for cruising here.USA Hurricane season and with Alaska season ending soon. Plus all the troubles being reported by passengers at the moment, covid on board, costs, (so many negatives) You won't see much demand up to year end. So basically this year is dead to the cruise lines, Southern hemisphere pretty much closed also so all these ships would normally head there so no revenue here either.At the very best CCL will be profitable again end of 2022, but that is looking like a big IF. Losing money quarterly, no dividends, expect these levels to be the highs for the next 6-9 months.(P.S) Bought @ $8 sold @ $29.90. Will buy back in when the company reflects it's correct share price. Presently $16 is generous and fully expecting this to go lower as the year goes on. A company that if you bought it today with 2 billion loses per quarter. Being valued (enterprise value) more than when it was turning over 20 billion revenue in 2019 with 3 billion profit per year is very overvalued. It will be pumped and dumped but will settle somewhere between $10-$15 within the next 9 months. Enjoy."
Good times ahead!
Biden will be bailing out CCL by giving them $20 billion in his new infrastructure bill

"I was Pfizer vaccinated, both doses, and got the Rona. It was a typical lingering cold, that's all, definitely didn't live up to the hype and I've been a lot sicker. Not a single one of my family/friends caught it from me (all vaccinated). We need to stop worrying and start living again. Just get the vaccine and you're protected, and book that cruise!"
"CCL is risky stock. if you invested CCL using borrowed money, you will regret soon. GET READY FOR MARGIN CALL."
"There were only about 23k cases per day in the weekend. Mortality rate was really low, being only 0.2%. Why should we pay so much attention to it and fear about it? Why should we let this virus pose such a huge impact on our life quality? After getting fully vaccinated, this is merely another respiratory tract virus, similar to influenza, rhinovirus or RSV.Come on it's time to resume to normal life and keep going forward."
All charts point to $30. Enjoy GLTA !
This news will finally drive the shorts away hopefully. And better yet give some chance to buy somemore travel stocks.
Today could be the real reversal day … deep red start after crazy volatility day yesterday … let’s turn this real green by 10am
Did someone just say hurricane and Florida? Will this affect cruising?
Solid. I feel good about holding 881 shares again lol!
Straight Facts:320 people are dying of COVID per day nationwide. 1700 are dying per day of heart disease. 1600 of cancer. 473 from accidents. The COVID death rate is a tenth of what it was at its peak. 9 of the 10 most populated cities are recording 5 or fewer COVID deaths per day. Stay safe and protect yourself and your families. Get the vaccine if it makes sense for you. I did. Just wanted to share a little perspective.
Feels like everyday is either plus or minus 4% .. can’t we get some days of peace ?!
Mardi Gras is a cash generating machine. Flood gates reopening
It’s what is booked and they are booking cruises like crazy right now. Get it when it’s low because it’s going to take off like a rocket. People are to pent up and want to travel. Remember stocks are forward thinking!
"Currently passengers all have to be tested at each port of call before re boarding the ship and tested prior to initial voyage regardless of vaccination status.. Should the unvaccinated decide to want to cruise they are forced to pay $45- per test per day should they wish to sail and all social distancing protocols are enforced and ships are only being filled to a quarter if not a 3rd of there overall capacity. Delta variant is crushing bookings forcing cancellations due to onboard policies surrounding Covid. Not to mention all the water carnival is still currently under from all the water the ships have taken on (Debt) and they do not have enough staff to meet the demand of bookings they currently have and are being forced to cancel voyages and re book customers... currently not a bright future ahead for tourism, this ship will take some time to reach its destination again.. Followed by crippled airlines with a pilot shortage. Cheers!"

By far the best investment going carnival cruise lines! CCL!
"@Keith Princess Cruises is restarting cruises for the first time in nearly two years. It’s been a long wait, but finally, the Carnival-owned cruise line can start to bring back cruise vacations, starting with the Majestic Princess from Seattle, Washington.The Princess cruise ship is the first in the fleet not to resume from the U.S. but the first in the world. The vessel departed the Port of Seattle at approximately 6:00 PM local time after 500 days on hold. The ship is sailing a seven-day cruise in Alaska, including calls in Juneau, Skagway, and Ketchikan, along with the stunning views of Glacier Bay.The build-up has been well before today, when Princess Cruises and sister line celebrated the return of cruises on Friday, July 23. The event was attended by Jan Swartz, President of the cruise line, along with Donald Arnold, President of parent company Carnival Corporation.https://www.cruisehive.com/princess-cruises-restarts-operations-in-the-u-s-from-seattle/53711"
2 things you can do to push the price higher ——- Buy CCL and book a cruise!
I know a day or two ago one of the 52 usernames mentioned CCL was going down today 5-10% Was that Robert?I think he must of meant up 5-10% and was just mistaken.Funny thing is all 52 usernames of the one person is 99.7% wrong all the time with predictions.
So you're worried about covid on a cruise ship. How many cases are linked to the Mexico boarder crossings? The media doesn't even touch on the subject but they continue to think a cruise is going to bring the end of the world. Hmmmmm. Crazy world we live in.
Carnival is in a bind with cruise cancellations. Will it begin cancelling cruises to the Caribbean? Only have cruises to its private island? What happened the 26 cruise members who tested positive? Where they told to stay in their cabins hoping that their light symptoms will not worsen? Were they escorted off the ship in Belize? Where did they go? Had to walk the plank? My guess is that Carnival shares will lose between 35 to 70 cents tomorrow (Thursday). What say you?
How will hurricane Grace affect cruise lines ?
This will go up to $25 today!
"CDC had their say, nothing bad happened, cruising will continue as usual and shorts will have to start to cover on Monday"

Covid won't hurt you if you have been vaccinated"". Thanks, DocLooks like the bad news for the weekend has already leaked out. Put options heaven on Monday's opening share price. I need to remember to increase my limit sell prices before Monday morning. Please remind me!"
"Yikes @robert, moderna is down 6% on top of your puts that you bought at $20 for CCL. Your advice is truly amazing."
"Robert - I haven’t checked in on you recently. You doing ok? Bought puts at $19, $20, $21, $22, and now again $24. (Don’t worry Robert, I know you’re actually long. I just think it’s funny how you claim to be buying puts on all the relative lows)"
I just want to say I was happy to make a donation to CCL Robert!
"some ambulance chasers trying to cash in, do not see CCL being held liable for what wasn't even known at hte time, remember it was just going to disappear like magic, was what our leader told us."
CCL will be at $27 by the end of business day tomorrow! Don’t mess up and miss out! This is the most profitable best deal going in the stock market now! So much upside potential for growth! Most people don’t know this but CCL is working with the big Pharma companies and acquiring them to help offset losses. They are now in the works with coming out with new vaccines and new creams and lotions that can help with other future diseases and viruses!
Why are the same people always posting on here? Seems like they have an angle.
It’s so easy to manipulate a couple of shares after hour. We just can’t stop institutions dumping CCL tmr once markets open! LOL
"Bought more shares today at 23.33, will hold them until they double in value"
"Funny, my account shows a weird number…….98.97% gain to date! Where are the shorts"
And Robert by the way I’m not selling until this thing hits $30
E.U. Set to Propose Travel Restrictions on U.S. Visitors Maybe you can redirect your germ boats to Algeria ?
the fda full approval of vaccine will life all boats....its what institutions need tonhave people vaccinate and will lead to lower covid impact and normalize cruising again
Thanks CDC … dear god
"Start selling boys and girls, we're on our way back down lmao https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/carnival-ccl-delays-princess-cruises-132201561.htmlCarnival (CCL) delays return to sailing for Island Princess and Diamond Princess."
10% of float are in shorts hands:) that will be a rocket  squeeze
Wow this is a huge game changer!https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/fund-scooped-up-amc-stock-bought-tilray-carnival-sold-alibaba-51627491094?mod=mw_quote_news
People are willing to pay the extra money for rapid testing at(or near the embarkation area). Proof of neg test is not enough.
I’ve got one thing to say I’m glad I am not Robert!
pre market drop now or no problem??
Everybody knows the stock is going up to $60 within a year!
"People will take vacations and cruises , we are nearing the peak and as more people get vaccinated we near herd immunity."
"Just bought an additional 7,500 shares. If you don't believe check the tape10:00:36 @ 21.11"
"Don't sell, buy some more instead. Even after recent run up this stock is still dead cheap. One of the best bargains on the market today"
Strength ??Looking at today and all the bad news and Dow dropping IMO CCL is holding up good.
"This is the bottom, buy as much as you can!"
News from the front line. Just got off the phone with a Princess Customer Service Representative. She said the hold time with calling last week was 1 hour. My hold time today was 15 minutes. Apparently many customers are either cancelling or delaying their cruises. Carnival will likely begin to cancel some cruises soon and then follow up with more dilution of shares. We are entering Put Option heaven.
This is the next big short squeeze! Going to $25 by the end of the day
"Breakout is imminent, buy as much is you can. This thing will not stop before it reaches 25"
Where are you at Robert and jeff?
"Yes, we are down right now but I just wanted to bring up another 100% wrong prediction by the resident paid basher/pumper.For a week was promoting downgrades coming. I think he meant upgrades and just spelled incorrectly."
"Pretty sure this is going to the mid teens. Summer over, dilution and massive debt"
Any weakness is a buying opportunity
I really feel like with pent-up demand this is a guaranteed $50 stock by April 12-2022! By 1000 shares come back in eight months you’ll be glad that you bought CCL stock!
The put options are down big time
"So let me get this straight... the man running the country (not) is backing Newsom against his recall saying ..""he knows how to get the job done and he's doing it""...what does that say about the president ??￼Pretty much the same thing b's doing ..the two of them couldn't do a better job if they wanted to in destroying this country￼.Not much to do with cruising but still a sound point￼"
"Delta variant will not last long, more people continue to vaccinate, we just hit 70% mark, in my state numbers already down last two days. Think we will be back to very low numbers by end of August."
"Jeff, Robert, and the other aliases - when is this going to $18? You’ve been saying this for over a month now, but we haven’t gotten there. I’m starting to wonder how much money you have really lost hereRobert, you add to your position today? I’m curious, you never talk about your entry / exit points. Almost as if you’re embarrassed to discuss them."
"I've had 14 cancelations today on Princess cruises. Why? because cruisers don't want to wear masks on board during the whole cruise. Sell now while you can still salvage some money. Watch it drop when the cancelations start to come in.Ron, travel agent"
"For those asking “where are the bashers today?” Let me explain. The reason we are not seeing bashers today (as much as usual) is because the volume is high. The people paying these bashers are not going to pay them to post here when the volume / movement is out of the control of the market maker. This is why you don’t see them posting as much today, because they’re not getting paid to. They get paid to post when the volume is so low that the market makers can take advantage of bid ask spreads and manipulate the share price down to make better entry points. I tease Robert and Keith about how much money we all would’ve lost if we listened to them and about how much they have theoretically lost, but they haven’t. They haven’t lost because they’re actually long on the stock. They bash because their bosses tell them and pay them to. They’re not going to pay them to bash when the buyer volume (shares traded) is so high that they can’t manipulate the stock. Simple. Remember when we ran up to $32? The bashers vanished completely. Gone. It’s simple. It’s clockwork for these guys. Take advantage and capitalize of the fear of retail traders. I’d say smart, hats off to them, but they’re unethical. They lie and exaggerate to spread FUD which is a scummy thing to do.GLTA"
"Dear everyone, go travel. Also enjoy those 2022 cruises which you have already booked massively."
"(Bloomberg) -- Carnival Corp. is selling $2.4 billion of new junk bonds to refinance debt the cruise ship company took on last year, when it was forced to pay high interest rates amid doubts about its ability to weather the pandemic. Pricing discussions on the new debt are in the 4%-4.25% range and reflect the strong demand for high-yield bonds as investors hunt for bigger returns. That would slash borrowing costs for Carnival because the proceeds will fund an offer to buy back about half of the 11.5% coupon debt the company issued in April 2020."

Back to 24 by Friday's close. Covid-19 resurgence will not affect significantly the cruising business. The cruises will continue no matter how many new cases per day are reported in the US and Carnival will not have any trouble to fully load their ships with passengers because of pent-up demand and because there are limited options for travel right now. Many countries are either closed or half-closed. Let's face it: cruising is the safest and the most troublesome way to travel right now. Carnival will be profitable already in the next quarter and the stock price will reflect that
Need to close at the highs today to move to 25. imho
Keith used to be a Long you used to brag about how the stock was going to go to $40 for months ago? What happened to you? We all know you like the stocking want to earn it you just want to own a cheap. So another words you do like the idea of the the stock just not at this price correct? Doesn’t that mean that you do believe it’s eventually going to go up before two years from now? Why would you be on here if you didn’t plan on this going up in the next 3 to 4 months? It’s so obvious!
"Right now the cruise ships are the safest places in the universe when it comes to corona.99% vaccinated, repeated testings, immediate disembarkation,immediate care for corona positive,The CDC simply hates this industry,Florida.Texas, Louisiana,main California, Alaska,the Carolinas, and many more coastal states will carry the burden of unemployment,closed businesses, poverty and dependence on federal assistance,This simply doesn’t make any sense specifically when 500 individuals are sitting inches away from each other on airplanes for hours,, busses, trains , restaurants,The cruising industry is a source of freedom and happiness to millions of Americans , why take it away."
"Mute the fake shorts, they have no idea what is going on.Buy and hold , this will go much .higher"
"Party over. ""Passenger Infected With COVID-19 on Carnival Vista and Abandoned By Carnival in Belize Dies After Returning to U.S. The Passenger was vaccinated."""
"go search YouTube for carnival Mardi gras. people are on it right now, no masks, 70% capacity, ship looks incredible. they charge $15 for a 15 second roller coaster ride. cruising is definitely back"
"As I've been telling you!!!. Enjoy.So whatBut then there's the bad news, and it comes in two parts. Part 1 is, of course, that Carnival Corporation stock already costs $22 a share. Thus, HSBC's new price target, while a bit higher than its old price target, still forecasts a 17% decline in share price, which is obviously not good for the stock -- and the reason why HSBC maintains a reduce (i.e., sell) rating on the stock.As HSBC explained, while it's true that cruising has resumed in the United States and Europe, the amount of business Carnival is getting so far is ""not material"" to hopes that the company will turn profitable again.Now whatAnd this news gets worse. Earlier this week, NBC Miami ran a story relating how passengers aboard Carnival's first batch of restarted cruises are ""frustrated"" with the company's COVID-19 protocols. In particular, parents of unvaccinated children under 12 years of age say that there is ""nothing for the kids to do at all, besides the pool"" and that kids couldn't get off the ship when it visited ports. Carnival apparently warned passengers prior to boarding that this would be the case, but this message got lost in the fine print, and has proved to make the cruising experience less pleasurable than it once was.As one passenger summed up:We had some fun. It definitely was an experience and we learned from it. We won't do it again."
Short squeeze today…
The ship will sink to under $21.00 today!!!
"This stock will be at 40 next spring and will be over 50 by the end of the next year, after two-three profitable quarters. Don't miss your chance to buy a great, well-managed and undervalued company for a fraction of it's real price."
perhaps they should sell cabins like time shares. thoughts?
It will a depend on how many more people get vaccinated. If all ships regardless of what cruise line we could be talking about to have 100% vaccinated passengers and crew on the ships then Covid testing can end. Covid will never end but with people vaccinated then we all can still get it but have no idea and that is what all businesses need is 100% vaccinated 100% back to normal and that will determine the future of this stock and all cruises lines.
"Well, last night I predicted that Carnival shares will lose between 35 and 70 cents. We closed off 82cents. I missed by 12 cents, so I will polish my crystal ball to see if we can get more accurate predictions on share prices in the future."
"SEATTLE, Aug. 19, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Seabourn, the ultra-luxury ocean and expedition travel company, is appealing to adventurers and historians alike with the announcement of Seabourn Venture's new inaugural itineraries, Wild & Ancient British Isles Voyage and Scottish and Norse Legends Expedition, setting sail in April 2022.Seabourn VentureSeabourn VentureThe first of the line's two new purpose-built, ultra-luxury expedition vessels, Seabourn Venture is scheduled to depart for its inaugural voyage on April 10, 2022, exploring the United Kingdom in an unprecedented way with a 12-day Inaugural Wild & Ancient British Isles voyage from Greenwich (London), England, to Leith (Edinburgh).

Nice to see green this AMLittle longer and all will be green
This will go $26 tomorrow
"Sinve July 19th , several higher highs and higher lows , on verge of a break out. Afollow through tomorrow should force a squeeze."
impressive come back today
Short squeeze again today…
"Rick at the Motley Fool today: ""Carnival's reputation is taking on water, and not just because a passenger died. Why was she left in Belize with her family having to finance her return back to the U.S. to receive better care that came too late?""Well Rick, even before the Pandemic cruise lines wouldn't assist passengers that became sick. EVERYONE should have a form of travel insurance, and in CCL's defense that passenger had the opportunity to purchase it from CCL directly prior to the cruise. It is sad that a passenger died, but in NO way is this CCL's fault."
"Norwegian cruise ships are docked at Portsmouth Marine Terminal in Portsmouth, Va. A federal judge on Sunday night, Aug. 8, 2021, granted Norwegian Cruise Line’s request to temporarily block a Florida law banning cruise companies from asking passengers for proof of coronavirus vaccination before they board a ship. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams granted the preliminary injunction in a lawsuit challenging the state’s “vaccine passport” ban, which was signed into law in May by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis"
"Take Note:-while Carnival's stock price is way down, its enterprise value is actually comparable to what it was before the pandemic. In other words, the market is saying Carnival's business is worth roughly the same right now as it was back in 2019 when times were good for cruise companies. I disagree with the market on this one, and it's why I'm calling Carnival stock overhyped.Looking forward to a best-case scenario, I don't see any reason Carnival's business should be better than in 2019 anytime soon. After all, it's not like the cruise ship industry was growing by an impressive rate before the pandemic. That said, it was steady and profitable. And its profitability made Carnival a decent investment back then because management was buying back shares and paying a juicy high-yield dividend.In 2019, Carnival generated operating income of almost $3.3 billion. And it ended that year with just under $10 billion in long-term debt, which was manageable. As of the most recent quarter, however, Carnival had almost $26 billion of long-term debt on the balance sheet. Simply put, even if Carnival got back to full strength today and was generating substantial cash flow, it would take years before it could repair its balance sheet and return to being the company it once was. Remember: Lenders always take priority over shareholders. Therefore, there probably won't be any share repurchases or dividends for some time. This is the problem that I see for Carnival investors today. I'm not suggesting the company is doomed. But it's going to be a long road to even justify its current enterprise value. And generating market-beating returns on top of this seems like too big a challenge to overcome."
Bought 5 @$19.48 hoping to see $60 when cruise line sail again
1 month chart is looking great. Higher highs and higher lows
We’re going to see action all the way up to $25 tomorrow!
"Does anyone know what percentage they diluted their shares? I find it hard to believe with all the dilution they did, they are still losing $10 per share"
"CCL is only going higher, the vaccine and test requirements are being embraced. This is the next phase moving FORWARD, CCL longs know the BIG PICTURE of progression here. The Non-Vaxers won’t sail and that suits the Vaxers just fine and are willing to pay a little more for their safety. SHORTS don’t see this for some reason, dilution is only a small part of building back to massive profits in the long run. When I say 3, 4,5 TIMES YOUR INVESTMENT……..I not only mean it but will prove it! One more word…..BUY!"
"I’m a doctor. IMHO, COVID simply becomes one of many respiratory tract viruses after a wide coverage of vaccination. We could still get infected after being vaccinated, but we almost have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. There is really no need to set a goal of 0 cases because there is no one who is aiming to have 0 case of influenza."
COVID on ccl cruises is like a mild headache. Do you care? I don’t.
Have my cruise Aug 14th on the Mardi Gras! Going to be beautiful. Everyone relax. Vaccinated cruises only for now. Will be fine :)
I find it interesting but puzzling why the $24 area is becoming such strong resistance level.Also seeing the last 2 highs are slightly lower than the 8/25 high (lwr Highs) normally not a good sign ?? What is the thoughts of the group? Todays pop and give back of 50% thinking should trust chart and take some profit and play again next week ??
Close above 23 today. There's no reason whatsoever for this stock to trade lower that 30. This anomaly will be corrected very soon
Break out to 30 real soon
I do believe will see $28 today! Vaccines are up cases are down variant is a joke!
Royal Caribbean and Norwegian are good buys as well. But stick with Carnival as it has the highest potential
"Buy as soon as you can as much as you can, it's gonna go over 25 very fast! Sure way to double your money in a couple of years."
I assumed to soon Am I seeing a break out (Hopefully) hit 24.49 just enough to have a new high.Every one buy some shares and this keeps going
I sold a put spread in CCL at the 25 22.50 strikes towards the end of June thinking that even if it did breach there would plenty of time for it to come back around to 25 by August expiration. This position has made me want to pull all of my hair out.
"IM - Amazing call today on the price action. You claimed at the start of the day $22.5 close, very nicely done."
Has Carnival reported what happened to the Covid positive crews / passenger in Belize? Were they escorted off the ship and told to find their own way back home? Were they taken to a hospital or hotel? Maybe its a secret?
"Love such days when foolish investors are fearful and sell their shares for nothing. Golden opportunity to add some more. Never thought there would be a second chance to buy Carnival and other recovery play stocks so cheap. They crashed as if no vaccine has been invented yet and CDC is halting cruises again, LOL"
"This is undervalued, this might go back to 30$ really fast !!!"
"About 99.999% of fully vaccinated Americans have not had a deadly Covid-19 breakthrough case, CDC data showsThis is a great opportunity to buy for long term investment."
"Larry Elder might get elected in the California recall, if that happens he's removing all mandates and restrictions which could help the cruise industry there."
"Hey, 2019 ccl had 2b liquid with 9b debt. 2021 they have 9b liquid with 26b debt; soooo the net difference is 10b. Keep in mind, they can refi the debt with lower interest once near full capacity cruising is achieved. In 2020 they trimmed the fat by disposing less efficient ships. In conclusion, CCL compass is pointed in the right direction after dodging the covid storm. Everyone should book a cruise!"
Where are you at Bob on my #$%$ Rob?
"The shorts HATE this stock, they also accuse me and others of pumping. The fact is that shorty would LOVE to see CCL sink, the reality is it’s just not going to happen. When infections and deaths went way down this stock started to soar, this dip down is just the reaction of increased infections and deaths. These are hitting the unvaccinated hard and as more of them roll their sleeves up for the shot (which they are) this will finally subside. Its a only a SHORT time away from CCL literally DOUBLING IN PRICE! The future of CCL is SOLID! If you are hoping for a sinking ship….don’t look at CCL but at your bank account if your shorty."
Shareholders are waiting for downgrades before selling. Bad strategy.
Will close in GREEN today. The last chance to buy at such a low price!
Chart is looking solid.
"Bahamas, including ALL private cruise line islands just released a statement saying that no ships will be allowed to dock if anyone 12 or older in unvaccinated on the ship. The entire ship will be denied access."
"Citi upgrades CCL to $34 price target, but Norwegian earnings disappoint and options today…"
"no reason in posting stats and statistics . market is going down 10 percent and will drag ccl to 16 very soon, sell while you still can. i bought at 22.40 lost 5,000 in two days and said this is enough. oil and energy will soon be in a bear market and kill this and the airline stocks. move on,,,,,,,"
"The ""pandemic"" has enough power to keep these stocks low, but they'll never go bankrupt. Even in my Fauchi'd home state I see everyone masks off, no social distancing, as if delta isn't even happening. Cruises are still happening and demand is super high."
I have a better chance of getting shot in New Orleans then catching Covid!1https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/fund-scooped-up-amc-stock-bought-tilray-carnival-sold-alibaba-51627491094?mod=mw_quote_news
I do see a goat farm in my future!
Shareholders - Can you please bid the share price a little higher so that I can buy a few more Put options at cheap prices? Please do this before Carnival begins selling more shares on the open market. Thanks in advance.
Of the 27 people that tested positive for Covid they were all vaccinated and they were all asymptomatic! That’s good news!
awww man I thought we were going bankrupt. oh well
It will soon business as usual worldwide.
who listens to the CDC anymore?
Just went through the comments and had a good laugh at shorts who say that Carnival will go bankrupt because vaccinated people will not want go cruising anymore because of fear of getting asymptomatic Covid or because of testing requirements for passengers. Nice try!
"Charts have turned bullish, now the real buying will start. Shorts are fried"
"+XPLast week I wrote that ""a close below 21.89 would call for a test of the lows."" Well, Thursday closed at 21.66 and CCL did not take the death plunge. This is the third weekly rebound after three weekly swings down. The upside volume is still anemic but CCL seems to have a bid to it on the dips. Today I added to my modest long position at time 11:38 CDT and raised my GTC sell stop. The June 2/ June 8 double top which broke down on June 10 coincided with the 3rd quarter and new moons. I believe the rally in CCL will start 23 Aug after the full moon of Sunday 22 Aug. Upside to Mid/Late September. For all of you news junkies, don't be surprised if the CDC and /or CCL make some sort of major announcement over the weekend. Sill cautiously bullish with sell stop below.Peace."
"By the end of August, 275,000 people will be cruising globally. Last September there were only 26,000. Source: cruise industry news."
"Today is the last chance to buy for sub-24 prices. Next week we'll move to 26 which would be a fair price for CCL for now, considering it's not fully back to business yet."
"""WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. consumer confidence fell in August to the lowest level since February amid rising concerns about the rapidly spreading delta variant of the coronavirus and worries about higher inflation."" Where is the good news for Carnival? There is none."
"Time to load up. Great entry point. 22 will be the rock bottom, will be back at 24 by Friday."
"The WHO just stated that you do not need a booster if you received the full required immunization requirement. The CDC stated that you DO need a booster and that the US will start this process on September 20, 2021. What in the world is going on. We need an independent council to study this and make recommendation. Not an organization that received funding from the US government."
"Hey, I've read the motley fool article but I think HSBC's report is not very convincing.I get the impression that they want to justify their original price target. If you guys have an opinion, it would be helpful to share it.1) ""As HSBC explained, while it's true that cruising has resumed in the United States and Europe, the amount of business Carnival is getting so far is ""not material"" to hopes that the company will turn profitable again.""Carnival's current stock price was over $20 even when it was not profitable and despite the widespread delta.It may take some time for the company to regain its pre-Covid profits, and of course we know that. What do they mean by “not material”?As the vaccine is finally becoming popular and its practicality has been proven, the situation for Cruising company is getting much better. At present, many people do not have sufficient knowledge about vaccines, but as of now, about 170 million people in the U.S. have been vaccinated, and the number of deaths among them is only 0.001%. Of that 0.001%, 20% died of reasons other than coronas. Most of the patients who are now seriously ill are unvaccinated. If people realize this fact, more people would wish to be vaccinated.As more people are vaccinated and more data is collected, people's vague fears about vaccines will disappear and the risks of not vaccinating will be understood.2)”Earlier this week, NBC Miami ran a story relating how passengers aboard Carnival's first batch of restarted cruises are ""frustrated"" with the company's COVID-19 protocols. ”The comment that The cruising ship has not much things for kids to play except for the pool, is a bit ridiculous.Cruise ships are for sea cruising, not for children to play around. I think the pool would be more than enough, but if you're going to complain about the lack of playground equipment, you might as well find out what's available before you book..."
"I guess everyone that said the sp would get destroyed on Monday was wrong. Surprise, the statements were just paid bashers spreading doom and gloom with no underlying logic or evidence"
I don’t know what it is about this stock but it goes three separate times from $21-$24.
Buy now at $23..... It will be $50-70 in two or three years.
"Looks like it bounced off 50 Day SMA. Extremly bullish! Will break 25 this week and 24 will become resistance level for the next week or two, than move towards 26-27 level"
"with everyone shorting this, this would be the perfect next big meme stock, I'm just saying..."
Looks like they’ll be filing bankruptcy. All indicators point to that. They’re going to have to raise money somehow. The cash burn is unreal.
Jeff didn’t you say all indicators put into this going down to $17 or lower lol such a joke such a joke
I bought 200 puts $24.5 expiring tomorrow. WE ARE GOING TO WAR PLAY <3
Very nice day today. 3 rd upday in a row Recovered from opening and holding up. Next stop $26

30$ next week
"Great news… from today in the UK, double vaxxed people no longer need to isolate if no symptoms. Another move back to normality. Source: Sky news."
Tomorrow morning I will be loading up 1000 shares! Looks like things are about to go up tomorrow! GLTA!
Last month UBS as well raised its price target on Carnival from $20 to $42 from neutral to outperform. And J.P. Morgan also raised their target price from $23 to $33 from neutral to buy. As delta variant gets more people to be vaccinated and as it’s cruises start sailing in higher capacity.
Things are looking good for CCL! The volume is great and sentiment is high!
"If the reversal occurs, it’s gonna make a really strong chart."
This is a quality stock and a great entry point don’t miss out!
"This stock is a steal, may rebound a little slower but it's an easy 3x money in the next 12-18 months."
The CDC has announced on the roads recommendations for travelers not to use cruise lines because of the new variant of COVID-19 I am not a rocket scientist are a genius but I would think that that would affect the stock price we will see
Where is that iron death cross?
