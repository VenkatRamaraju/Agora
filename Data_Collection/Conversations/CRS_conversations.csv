"Great job on the balance sheet. Since March 31 they cut inventory by $145 mil, Accounts receivable by $82 mil, and accounts payable by $85 mil. Cash position increased by $100 mil up to $193 million.Now, what can be done to return to profitability? Might be awhile, non defense aerospace is in a big hole..............Kel"
I Posted an hour ago that once people realize how far advanced the technology is that the company can retest thehigh of 70 in the next 90 days LEAVE UP MY POST!
Seems like a good company but it trades sideways for five years. What is up?
nice job car tech
Going long Monday. Long term should yield solid return to growth. Nice dividend yield at these levels. Tangible book value of $21/share. CFRA retaining a $51 price target. A stock that is boring and no one talks about...perfect!
How we feeling about this?
This company is undervalued
Carpenter Technology is up 4.93% to 31.91
In @ 18.48. Also into ATI a few days ago @7.12. Like the value added metals area. Not so much the commodity steels........Kel
"CRS will be 100/sh by year end 2018. The ever improving metal industries and lowered tax rates will directly benefit CRS. Take a look at Boeing, plane orders on back order for years into 2020s. Good times ahead!"

New space defense branch could mean big revs hereCRS is huge Aerospace.
JP Morgan initiated price target $49

In the blink of an eye crs went from up .62 to down a couple of pennies. Was it in one trade? Looks fishy to me. It’s clawing it’s way back now. I no like.
"New holder of CRS in the $18s recently. Have to ask, anyone have an opinion of the 2021 EPS estimate. It's now $1.78 for 2021 where it as $4.64 as of 90 days ago (@ Fidelity and at Yahoo). I know things may be rough, but that bad?Thanks.........Kel"
