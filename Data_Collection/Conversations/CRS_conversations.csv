"CRS will be 100/sh by year end 2018. The ever improving metal industries and lowered tax rates will directly benefit CRS. Take a look at Boeing, plane orders on back order for years into 2020s. Good times ahead!"

"Great job on the balance sheet. Since March 31 they cut inventory by $145 mil, Accounts receivable by $82 mil, and accounts payable by $85 mil. Cash position increased by $100 mil up to $193 million.Now, what can be done to return to profitability? Might be awhile, non defense aerospace is in a big hole..............Kel"

In the blink of an eye crs went from up .62 to down a couple of pennies. Was it in one trade? Looks fishy to me. It’s clawing it’s way back now. I no like.

Feels way ahead of itself here. Restart of aerospace is a long lead time & electrification is mostly aero. Much smaller amount is EV. Also competition is focusing on the high end products. Believe you must have a 18-24 month time horizon to get in now.
JP Morgan initiated price target $49
Going long Monday. Long term should yield solid return to growth. Nice dividend yield at these levels. Tangible book value of $21/share. CFRA retaining a $51 price target. A stock that is boring and no one talks about...perfect!

"Earnings were strong for Q3 considering the wheels fell off the economy in mid March. It appears the company is reacting well through furloughs, plant closings, hiring freeze, controlling costs by reducing inventory. Q4 will be the big problem for them and everyone else unless you are in a useless industry(facebook). I was considering buying in at $18 before the run-up. I might get that opportunity again in a month."
