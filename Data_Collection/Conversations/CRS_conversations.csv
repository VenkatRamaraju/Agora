"Earnings were strong for Q3 considering the wheels fell off the economy in mid March. It appears the company is reacting well through furloughs, plant closings, hiring freeze, controlling costs by reducing inventory. Q4 will be the big problem for them and everyone else unless you are in a useless industry(facebook). I was considering buying in at $18 before the run-up. I might get that opportunity again in a month."

Feels way ahead of itself here. Restart of aerospace is a long lead time & electrification is mostly aero. Much smaller amount is EV. Also competition is focusing on the high end products. Believe you must have a 18-24 month time horizon to get in now.
