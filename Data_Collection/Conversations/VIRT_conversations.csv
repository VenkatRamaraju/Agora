"Just mentioned on closing bell as a good trade, by Josh whatever."
"I can already see what's going to happen. We hover around $23...maybe drop to $21-22 depending on how bad the market is next week. Or, we might move up slightly...but the rang will be $21-25 before earnings. We won't see less or higher than that. My guess is we trade down until earnings ($22.50-23), and then get a 10%, MAYBE 15%, pop on earnings release....but by the time the market opens, probably half those gains disappear. There are too many people holding $30C options, both in May and June. I don't mean to sound like a conspiracy theorist (I am not and I HATE people who use them), but I simply believe there are way too many people standing to make a lot of money. So, I just don't see it happening. Depending on the price on May 6th, come May 7th we'll see a stock price of somewhere between $23-28 pre market...then it drops. The big move probably won't happen until next earnings call (and will only happen if volatility/volumes stay high)."
"Today's drop is a great buying opp. Just bought in... Singapore's Temasek Sovereign Fund is a holder and will increase its holdings soon. This ought to rise to $40.With the delta variant becoming more widespread, look for more sheltering in-place and more folks trading - making more money for VIRT...."
Great interview with CEO Doug on CNBC
Holding on and adding for next earnings VIRT could take another jump to $30 and still trade at 5 times earnings
What a downright beautiful stock
Can’t understand the drop in price today ?
Why is this stock not more popular? A P/E of 6 big yeild and tons of profit/growth?
"We will live into the answer as too how far VIRT will get hammered, but according to my calc, VIRT will still earn $.90-$.95/share with the possibility of $1.00+ as interest rate expense will down, one extra trading day in the 3rd Q vs 2ndQ and Sept having more volatility than July or Aug.So, even in a ho hum Q, VIRT earns approx $1.00/share, so at $24 the PE is 6-a ho hum Q annualized. Long term growth drivers are increasing market share as C got out of the business today, selling of services and increased options penetration. Also, interest and real estate footprint expense should be consistently moving lower Q/Q. Swings of optimism and pessimism should move the stock from $23ish to $35ish."
Buying under $23.25
"SEC Filing relating to the line of credit from Vincent Viola. ""The Borrower intends to use the proceeds of the Loans solely to finance the purchase and settlement of securities and to fund margin deposits with the National Securities Clearing Corporation and Options Clearing Corporation."" Why the need to fund margin deposits? More cash needed for more trading?"
The stock dropped because of the article that came out in Barron’s about how it’s on the table for the SEC about banning payment for order flow. But we will see.
Down big! What happened?
4% yield!!!
Why is nobody buying this sustainable 4% yield
Why is the stock down after surpassing earnings & revenue estimates?
"This stock is going to hit $30, minimum, over the next 3-4 weeks (if not sooner). They reported February earnings on March 3. When they did so, they only captured the last few days of volatility. Since the beginning of March, the market has been volatile (that's an understatement). I honestly would not be surprised to see an average of $15 million/day in income from trading since the beginning of March. That would mean they have already made $120M this month. Even assuming a return to normal for the remainder of the month, they will have made about $200M in March - about a 100% increase over February. It's gonna be incredible."
Anyone see the tweets from Ken G @citsecurities? Seems like he's nervous. Makes me nervous for $virt.
VIRTU lives with or without PFOF…and so does that 4% yield
"James & Roberto:Saw your comments about how the stock price may be priced in. If this is the case (which I doubt), it would only be short term, and let me explain why.Vaccine isn't coming for a year. People are going to be weary of travel. Think about how that affects the market until a vaccine is here. Once we reopen, the FED will be less active. Then, the market will return to fundamentals. The problem is that the fundamentals will look disastrous. The stock market will then decline further. This may bring the FED back into action but by then the market will realize the full picture. Why is this important? Because of the VIX. This is the only metric we, as VIRT shareholders and/or call options holders, should be looking at. An elevated VIX pretty much guarantees a strong VIRT. This company may be very conservative in their trading approach...but the're still making a boatload of money in an environment of an elavated VIX. The VIX, IMHO, is here to stay for at least another half a year (if not longer). If there's an actual depression? Then longer. I therefore believe that VIRT full year revenues will be somewhere around $3 billion total (probably $2.5 billion from trading income).WORST CASE SCENARIO in the scenario I laid out above? A $45-50 VIRT stock price in one year. We will no doubt have bump ups before the 12 month period plays out. I will buy on margin (which I never do because I'm scared of a margin call in the case of a total market collapse and somehow VIRT goes down with it) in a few months."
