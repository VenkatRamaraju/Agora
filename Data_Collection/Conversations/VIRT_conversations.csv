4% yield!!!
VIRT reached a new 52 Week High at 21.52
"All things considered, current price much too low."
Wouldn't VIRT technology be more real time than TTD ? Isn't this the same type pf real times business of buyers and sellers...and making money in-between? Just trying to understand.
Predictions for this week?
thank you for the 30% gain and dividend virt
"Well, no going back now. Let’s get this money!!!"
"P/E of 26 for a company whose earnings are more cyclical than industrials. Overvalued! In addition, even if volatility increases, there is little excess profitability in the industry as there are plenty of players in the market-making space who have also been waiting for this and limit the opportunity to make outsize profits. In any case, the volatility will have to be sustained at sky-high levels to justify the doubling of share price that has occurred."
Still looks like a $40+ stock
"James & Roberto:Saw your comments about how the stock price may be priced in. If this is the case (which I doubt), it would only be short term, and let me explain why.Vaccine isn't coming for a year. People are going to be weary of travel. Think about how that affects the market until a vaccine is here. Once we reopen, the FED will be less active. Then, the market will return to fundamentals. The problem is that the fundamentals will look disastrous. The stock market will then decline further. This may bring the FED back into action but by then the market will realize the full picture. Why is this important? Because of the VIX. This is the only metric we, as VIRT shareholders and/or call options holders, should be looking at. An elevated VIX pretty much guarantees a strong VIRT. This company may be very conservative in their trading approach...but the're still making a boatload of money in an environment of an elavated VIX. The VIX, IMHO, is here to stay for at least another half a year (if not longer). If there's an actual depression? Then longer. I therefore believe that VIRT full year revenues will be somewhere around $3 billion total (probably $2.5 billion from trading income).WORST CASE SCENARIO in the scenario I laid out above? A $45-50 VIRT stock price in one year. We will no doubt have bump ups before the 12 month period plays out. I will buy on margin (which I never do because I'm scared of a margin call in the case of a total market collapse and somehow VIRT goes down with it) in a few months."
How is this stock not above $30 with the trading frenzy of the past year?
"all my fellow bulls are smart money, so obviously, no one would be chattin here. oh well"
Earnings estimates have been going up for the 4th Q from $.76 to $.80/share. Citadel had very good 4th Q numbers. The odds are VIRT will beat consensus-consequently 2021 estimates will have to rise.
Virtu Financial is down 4.91% to 29.92
Virtu Financial is down 6.08% to 24.24
Appears to have strong support at $21...fundamentals look pretty good...just need to some volume to trigger a buy signal.
"Loan repricing and swap transactions:""As a result of these transactions, the Company will save approximately $26.1 million in interest expense annually, or approximately 23% of interest costs on term debt.""Give the $26.1M to us in the form of an div increase..........:o)"
Good time to pic up some more shares..
Pretty good rally off a solid base that started forming the end of July...good volume...remember that it was trading at $37 a share only 6-7 MONTHS ago.
"Everyone needs to notice something:stocks that are sure to suffer from this pandemic/economic depression are trading like boom-times right now:TSLAFBGOOGUBERAll the buble stocks, are more bubbly than ever.And VIRT? Doing basically nothing, like there are zero expectations for earnings.Now of course we know the Fed is funneling trillions into the already bloated megacaps - and yes that explains what we are seeing to a certain extent.But it's hard to believe the market will shrug off both earnings reports and guidance from bubble companies like TSLA GB GOOG AND UBER, so they are highly unlike to retain their current valuations over the coming weeks.Meanwhile there is this totally ignored stock VIRT, which isn't getting boosted by the Fed's buying program being implemented by the Blackrock boys.Since it's being priced like it has no growth potential, it is certain to top expectations, so there is definitely potential it's going to explode."
Not sure why there isn’t more interest in VIRT. Best/safest volatility play. Low PE with 3.5% div.
Today VIX +20% and little above 40 now. Acter the summer months turnover of shares will increase again. So i would say good business again for Virtu. However stock minus 2% today. I dubbled my stack and wait for investors getting it as well...
Financial stocks are not fearing well in this market and VIRT is in this sector. Down today is very telling. Even Zacks has it as the Bull of the Day and still down. Market up and this stock down. Time to move on!
maybe i should put my open sell order at $175.. time to dream big
Who thinks this is a good buy at the current stock price?Thank you.
I'm still holding. Worst case I'll sell for a small profit (~10%). Won't be too bad for a 4-5 month position. Q2 will be excellent.
The company still decides to pay dividend 0.24 as before. It shows it has enough cash flow and confidence. No need to be panic. I think it is good time to accumulate more unless you are day trader
"Grow of Robinhood means more liquiditytrading coming in for Virtu, Citadel Securities and Two Sigma Securities.https://finance.yahoo.com/m/8c9be3f3-3bfe-3193-8c88-3e514777dcab/robinhood%E2%80%99s-speedy-rise-is.html"
"This thing does not have a lot of trading volume on it. Really hoping ER sends this thing upward. Eric, thoughts on oil? So volatile rn, idk how VIRT wouldn’t be killing it"
"Does anyone know what the actual earnings expectations are? According to Yahho Finance, it's $1.39 for Q1. But, according to Zack's (I think it's Zack's), it's $586M in revenue and $1.05 in EPS. What's the actual numbers and where do you find it?"
"Would love to hear what the people have as a target price for this company. Absolutely demolished earnings, yet still very cheap. I am super interested to hear where you guys think this will go"
Looks like this momentum stock has found a top. Going back to low 20s ahead of earnings.
"Big week, let’s get this money!"
"So...from what I read, VIRT makes 2.77 mil every day? How enjoyable it is. God bless America!"
"Huge drop in revenue and earnings from July to august. If September has a drop also, this thing's going to drop like a rock, stock price wise"
"EXIT of CFO I think rattled investors. I wouldn't come back unless I get some clarity, but how do you kill it on earnings and revenue and die? something smells"
"We will live into the answer as too how far VIRT will get hammered, but according to my calc, VIRT will still earn $.90-$.95/share with the possibility of $1.00+ as interest rate expense will down, one extra trading day in the 3rd Q vs 2ndQ and Sept having more volatility than July or Aug.So, even in a ho hum Q, VIRT earns approx $1.00/share, so at $24 the PE is 6-a ho hum Q annualized. Long term growth drivers are increasing market share as C got out of the business today, selling of services and increased options penetration. Also, interest and real estate footprint expense should be consistently moving lower Q/Q. Swings of optimism and pessimism should move the stock from $23ish to $35ish."
just watch...up
Management and BOD should resign!
"This whole market is a scam. Literally less than 2 weeks ago VIRT was at $20.50. Now we're at $24.25 - an 18% increase on zero news. Don't get me wrong - I am very happy and think the bare minimum right now (as of 4/13) should be $25 (because the market doesn't know what the earnings are yet - they know they are good but they don't know how good), but what has changed here?"
"I bought the calls yesterday...these guys are crushing it with big spreads and risk-free market making...earnings gonna be impressive from this point forward...new highs and recognition, watch or play"
The coming quant rebalance will be good for volatility and VIRT.
Anything Goldman downgrades is a Buy and vice versa
$VIRT $CME $ICE $IBKR are interesting too. Getting ready to take a bite out of $SAN . gl2a.
"THIS STOCK IS ABOUT READY TO TAKE OFF,I'M BUYING A LITTLE EVERY WEEK, SHOULD BE IN THE MID 30'S TOO START THE NEW YEAR"
Sorry everyone. I bought this stock and I jinxed it. It's called the Robert affect. Sheesh.
i might want to put a 35 handle on this
VIRT reached a new All Time High at 26.00
Beautiful dividend!
I guess the market is tired of earning beats. 5 qtrs in a row over analyst's consensus and valuation falls 5% on more than 2x normal volume.
Next stop $30.
"Eric, this didn’t work as you said it would.."
The stock dropped because of the article that came out in Barron’s about how it’s on the table for the SEC about banning payment for order flow. But we will see.
Down big! What happened?
This volatility and increased transactions are pure gold for VIRT. I guess there are chances to see another great quarter.
Why is the stock down after surpassing earnings & revenue estimates?
imo.. this is gonna be the Year of Volatility.. great for virt and cos like it
I got some more.
mission failed. we'll get em next time
"If VV gets 3 million warrants to buy, just on the closing of the deal, then according to my calc the average closing price is $22.75. So, the stock, which was probably artificially held down the last two weeks, is a buy under $22.75 and a strong buy under $22.00"
This stock is poised to dominate once interest rates increase as there will be a lot more volume pumping through the markets.
LOL this stock is easy to predict (before earnings). It's like clockwork. It won't pass the $25 threshold.
Stock Drop ...... can someone explain why the big drop.....was the news that bad.....thx!
"Wow there’s basically no interest in this thing, everything from the message board to the volume to the fact there’s great news and it opens up 8% and bleeds all day long. Is anyone out there?"
"Yahoo and Zacks rate this BS a ""Strong Buy"" for the past few weeks. SMH"
"how does this company make money.....can they see my order in the pipeline?????and front run the order/???///////can they change the bid ask spread because they see the order flow before the trade is even posted on the exchangeor ecm,,,,,,or wherever"
VIRT reached a new All Time High at 37.30
"“Given the sustained levels of extraordinary volatility in the current macro environment and the unique opportunity this affords Virtu to provide valuable liquidityto customers across the global markets and execution services to our clients, we consider it prudent to opportunistically supplement our borrowing capacity,” saidDouglas A. Cifu, CEO of Virtu Financial. ""Our results to date validate our ability to manage risks effectively, even in the most volatile periods, and thisincremental capacity will enable us to augment our liquidity provisioning and execution services globally,"" said Mr. Cifu.So, based on the CEOs comments, the borrowing is bullish. I agree and have been saying this. The greater access to capital the firm has to utilize, the greater the returns of the firm. They are basically trading on margin, and their trading strategy is a winner. I am super long on VIRT. Going to get more shares this week before ER. The large cap companies like google, apple, msft, amzn, report this week. It is going to be huge. And look at oil, so volatile! Great market conditions for this firm, hyper bullish. Eric, I respect your $27k position. I will increase my position to be around $30k this week. Let's ride!"
"""One analyst thinks other market participants will benefit too. “We would be buyers on weakness of Interactive Brokers (IBKR), which continues to charge commissions and accepts minimal payment for order flow and [trading firm] Virtu Financial (VIRT), which continues to benefit from the elevated retail volumes that have continued into the new year,” wrote Piper Sandler analyst Richard Repetto."""
Finally a stock with good fundamentals
At least it got the Zacks Pop... when JP Morgan gave it a $23 target while at $18 it went nowhere.. so far so good
Shell dividend cut. Likely to see more dividend cuts as time goes on. Maybe they flock to this 4% yielding stock?
"It is good time to buy the dip. The P/E is only about 5 with nice dividend. Either long or short term, it is good investment"
VIRT reached a new All Time High at 27.05
"Gensler made comments about HFT, spooked Virtu."
I am in with 547 shares
"Let’s break $25 next week. Volumes still so high, can’t keep this down much longer"
"Geeez, IBD downgrades the stock's composite rating , now below 90. A true dog of a stock. Maybe not so much a dog of a company, but in this environment, it trades a mil shares and can't even muster up a 2 vcent gain while mkt roars to all time highs. Truly amazing stock performance. NDAQ better make a bid soon"
how is this stock not 30 yet
Great interview with CEO Doug on CNBC
Anyone see the tweets from Ken G @citsecurities? Seems like he's nervous. Makes me nervous for $virt.
"UNDER VERY HEAVY ACCUMULATION, EPS SHOULD MOVE THIS BACK INTO THE $35 AREA, LOOKED GREAT TODAY"
CEO was interviewed 30 minutes after Gensler/SEC remarks and he nailed it. No transparency issues with these guys!
Bio-Key at 77c may be on the start of something big ( based on price and volume)
VIRT is up 5.48% to $25.99
I bought at $29.25
sold all my 600 shares at $30 to buy amc. up big on amc but I'm coming back to virt if I don't go to 0
Hoping we pop off soon
Big earnings surprise. Not good .
Trump threatening Tariffs! Volatility isn’t going anywhere!
"volatility is how they make their money , hope it lasts forever"
VIRT reached a new 52 Week High at 20.05
VIRT reached a new All Time High at 31.60
VIRT is down -7.09% to 33.40
what a massacre
Virtu Financial reached a 52 Week high at 29.72
"I will add to the conversation. I think some traders, perhaps algos, are using VIRT as a VIX substitute. So, on market up days, they are shorting VIRT instead of shorting VIX. At some point in time, because of the yield, the shorts won't be able to push VIRT any lower-my guess is around $21.00. I continue to accumulate because I think the stock is way under valued and misunderstood."
"Not that I know much about why stocks prices rise and fall. But based on the PE/Dividend alone, I think that even Warren Buffet would like this stock. Am I missing something?"
WHO SAW THE NUMBERS?!?!?! OMFG!!!!! WE BETTER GO TO THE MOON!!!!!!!!!!!https://financefeeds.com/virtu-financial-registers-steep-increase-revenues-q1-2020/
"I can already see what's going to happen. We hover around $23...maybe drop to $21-22 depending on how bad the market is next week. Or, we might move up slightly...but the rang will be $21-25 before earnings. We won't see less or higher than that. My guess is we trade down until earnings ($22.50-23), and then get a 10%, MAYBE 15%, pop on earnings release....but by the time the market opens, probably half those gains disappear. There are too many people holding $30C options, both in May and June. I don't mean to sound like a conspiracy theorist (I am not and I HATE people who use them), but I simply believe there are way too many people standing to make a lot of money. So, I just don't see it happening. Depending on the price on May 6th, come May 7th we'll see a stock price of somewhere between $23-28 pre market...then it drops. The big move probably won't happen until next earnings call (and will only happen if volatility/volumes stay high)."
with all this volatility i could see this near 40 again
I’ve been buying for the dividend and think it’s going higher
this is not the virtu financial i know
"Bought this stock because of Vinnie Viola. When a CEO becomes a part of the current oval office, you know there's gonna be favoritism towards that company"
"@eric,@james where do y’all see us going this week my gut is telling me we are falling even further down"
Virtu Financial is down 5.14% to 24.93
"Let’s see how she does today. Hate seeing down so much premarket, but not many shares were traded"
"Earnings should be absolutely spectacular.All other companies are issuing disastrous reports and either lowering guidance or withdrawing it altogether, so as not to #$%$ investors.VIRT will be a flower in the desert!"
VIRT reached a new 52 Week High at 19.55
"Today's drop is a great buying opp. Just bought in... Singapore's Temasek Sovereign Fund is a holder and will increase its holdings soon. This ought to rise to $40.With the delta variant becoming more widespread, look for more sheltering in-place and more folks trading - making more money for VIRT...."
Need some buying pressure to come in soon. Want this thing to land on the moon!
VIRT is up 7.36% to 21.52
VIRT is down -6.95% to 34.15
Not off to a good start. Let’s see if she can recover. Volumes still very high
Hopefully we see a nice pump in share price this week
"Been chugging along nicely since Wednesday. Would love to end green, but not at all upset with recent price action. More concerned about hopefully ending the week at $25/share"
Massive downturn earlier today. Let’s see a nice reversal
VIRT is down -5.05% to 27.25
Dividend is the reason why I bought this
Virtu recommended on CNBC fast money as a great way to play market volatility!
was a little worried my covered calls would get assigned. big drop today saved my shares
"Wow, this bubble lasted a long time"
"Goldman with downgrade and the stock rallied, for love those snakes"
I need this stock to bounce back 
What a downright beautiful stock
Can’t understand the drop in price today ?
VIRT is down -10.72% to 22.90
question.: is VIRT in the list of those hedge funds which've been shorting AMC?
Virtu Financial is down 5.03% to 24.72
VIRT is down -8.40% to 27.80
CNBC ...... highlighting Retail Trading Frenzy
"the only news is the sec filing for the presentation today, which looks good."
Got back in think the stock market is gonna crash
"This stock needs to perform today, cmon now"
"Why has this seen unusual trading in the aftermarket yesterday and premarket today, down on small volume after 6:34pm yesterday. i can't find any information anywhere"
"how is this companies pe 5 while the rest of financial stocks are 20-30 pe, this stock should be at 40"
maybe the new quarter will good what do think Tom???
Why would you listen to CNN? LIONSTCOKALERTS (look them up) is my new guru… .
more volatility coming in the markets. great for this co. election in US on deck. dividend secure. this co will thrive. great price here
Why is nobody buying this sustainable 4% yield
What happened
if trade web can hit 225 bucks a share then why cant virtu get into crypto and wipe out the competition. ..just a paltry share price that virtu has
This quarter is gonna be even better for $VIRT !
Clearing weak hand selling after earnings...
"Price is all over the place today. Not really sure why, having a hard time explaining it. But regardless, ER gave confidence to hold through second quarter. I just hope my June calls survive lol"
"So, will the interview of the CEO make it drop ? I thought we had a support at 27$."
"James & Roberto (and other new posters):I have just (partially) read the 10K, which you can see here: https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1592386/000159238620000003/virtufinancial12-31x19.htmSome points stand out:1) ""Our revenues and profitability depend in part on the level of trading activity of securities, derivatives and other financial products on exchanges and in other trading venues in the U.S. and abroad, which are directly affected by factors beyond our control, including economic and political conditions, emergencies and pandemics, broad trends in business and finance and changes in the markets in which such transactions occur. Weaknesses in the markets in which we operate, including economic slowdowns in recent years, have historically resulted in reduced trading volumes for us. Declines in trading volumes generally result in lower revenues from market making and transaction execution activities. Lower levels of volatility generally have the same directional impact. Declines in market values of securities or other financial instruments can also result in illiquid markets, which can also result in lower revenues and profitability from market making and transaction execution activities. Lower price levels of securities and other financial instruments, as well as compressed bid/ask spreads, which often follow lower pricing, can further result in reduced revenues and profitability.""2) ""We require liquidity to fund various ongoing obligations, including operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt service and dividend payments. Our main sources of liquidity are cash flow from the operations of our subsidiaries, our broker‑dealer revolving credit facility (described under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Long-Term Borrowings”), margin financing provided by our prime brokers and cash on hand. Our liquidity could be materially impaired by a number of factors, including reduced business activity due to a market downturn, adverse regulatory action or a downgrade of our credit rating. If our business activities decrease or we are unable to borrow additional funds in the future on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.""3) Read the entire section labeled ""We have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could negatively impact our business and financial condition, and our debt agreements contain restrictions that will limit our flexibility in operating our business."" I won't post it here because it's too long.If I'm reading it correctly, it basically says that as of December 31, 2019, the company had a $300M credit facility (of which $30M was used so far), an additional $600M broker-dealer revolving credit facility with no borrowing so far. And, certain of their non-guarantor subsidiaries are party to various short-term credit facilities totalling $586M, of which there were $134.3M in borrowing.This begs the question: why did they take yet ANOTHER $450M in a credit facility deal? Anyone have any insights?In the 10K, there's also other notes basically saying that low market trading volume will negatively impact them (there has been low levels for about 2 weeks now - since this mini bull run). Also, they mention that a pandemic generally isn't good for their business.Sorry for the wall of text; have a $27K bet riding on this. What do you guys honestly think?"
"@newinvestor @eric @roberto how are you guys holding up? I’m still bullish. Can’t help be being frustrated at this price movement, but market conditions are still great for VIRT"
im a little late to the party. what did i miss?
I made a video about Virtu Financial ($VIRT)Check it on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGGHCsf5XnY Top market maker!
I don't think Josh said it was risk free....
What a scam. Makes money off volatility and in the most volatile market we’ve seen in years this just s**ts the bed. RIP my call options.
"ayyyyyy party of 1, but we chilin :D"
This should be green... but as always great results = red...No sense
This will be good the amount of retailmarkt investors that are popping the stocks on wallstreet bets
Volatility should bring up share price correct?
"im glad i invested in this, it may go to the moon sooner not later"
VIRTU lives with or without PFOF…and so does that 4% yield
VIRT is down 5.14% to 19.93
$23-$24 target zone to but back in
Wow huge after hours move. Tomorrow is gonna be awesome
"The Canadian pension fund that sold the 6.6 million shares, still has 5 million shares left. Assuming they want to sell the rest of their inventory, that is a lot of overhead supply. VIRT may have to fall to $23.00ish before VIRT will buy some of that 5 million shares."
Gonna be a big week for this stock. Data drop expected at the end of the week
"MARKET AND SPEED TRADING MAKES THIS STOCK A NO BRAINER, MANY YEARS AGO GOLDMAN SACHS WAS A TRADING HOUSE LIKE VIRT, THIS STOCK IS GOING WAY-UP $50+"
Sadly my stop loss got hit. Made some money on put options though. I think this is a very good stock for diversification given the correlation. Will come back for sure if it drops.
"I have loved this co for along time.. major trading firm, nice yield, currently lots of volatility.. however, I sold 80% of my position when viola did that $450 mil cash injection, for shares, on undisclosed terms.. that was a red flag for me.. dilution plus a lack of liquidity needing an immediate remedy.. jmo"
long and strong. glad to be part of this bad boy
"eps on tues..these buyers feel things look good, share volume has been heavy"
Holding on and adding for next earnings VIRT could take another jump to $30 and still trade at 5 times earnings
So the high-frequency trading business is still so competitive that most players have gotten out of the business. This rally won't last. A few days of really high vol won't save the high-frequency trading industry.
look at the 3 month YF chart... price rising on diminishing volume
VIRT is down -7.80% to 30.75
"Virt gave everything back from yesterday, due to a low ball price target from MS and the overall bear day of the market."
VIRT thrives in times like this. All the data shows that this is going to moon soon. Hop now and see y'all at moon
"All is fine with Virtu, buyback won't allow to drop price significantly, well covered dividends and excess cashflow will lead to growing price, expect 60$ this year along with high volatile market environment"
mark cuban could jump back in at these levels
". I got suckered by Josh baby on CNBC. I bet he sold me those $32 shares. Now I’m down $3,000. I hate this market. Too Volatile."
https://newsfilter.io/a/a88fcbf70dab01a7fec858f9c2eaa7ea
GCAP looks a bargain in comparison . VIRT has 20x the market cap without having 20x other metrics to support the difference Cash flow etc
MKT. VOLATILITY MAKES VIRT A STEAL ESPECIALLY AT THESE PRICES AND EPS ONLY A COUPLE WEEKS AWAY
anyone know the offering price?
Market seems to agree with BASEBALL. Stock is running up pre-earnings announcement. If the recent volatility has impacted VIRT's earnings as expected - this could be the start of a run to 35.
"Hello 'f' - and lol! A very legit stock actually...in the days and weeks ahead going to get hit with a nice gamma squeeze...look at open Feb $30 calls nearing 12,000 - implying the option writers are going to need to buy up 1.2 million shares to hedge their exposure in less than 3 weeks. AND - open interest approaching 14,000 Mar $30 calls that will require 1.4 million shares...It could move up big soon...watch and learn about the gamma squeeze"
Anyone have any price predictions?
"Sold my 8/17 $25 Puts today. Very seldom vis there easy money. This was one time, if you had the time to listen to the last CC. Most do not. Like the cash flow and dividend. Growth wise ......they need to buy another company. Taking profits and buying more TEUM soon. luck"
Virtu Financial is up 5.83% to 23.22
Why is this stock not more popular? A P/E of 6 big yeild and tons of profit/growth?
"SEC Filing relating to the line of credit from Vincent Viola. ""The Borrower intends to use the proceeds of the Loans solely to finance the purchase and settlement of securities and to fund margin deposits with the National Securities Clearing Corporation and Options Clearing Corporation."" Why the need to fund margin deposits? More cash needed for more trading?"
Yahoo has the Forward PE as been 2x the current PE - is there something wrong with Yahoo’s Forward PE which indicates currents Profits are going to drop 50 pct ?
Last trading day for before ER. Hopefully we close above $25. Get you bets in!
i dont know why this is going down.. volatility isnt going away anytime soon.. trading levels are huge
what just happened?
"Heavily manipulated stock. Unless a market crash happens, VIRT will probably fall back to its baseline of about $15-20 IMHO. It's a great company no doubt. The stock price, however, probably won't follow."
"A green day, lovely"
Content with today’s performance. Let’s keep chugging
How low will it go?
"Showing some remarkable resilience the past couple of weeks in the face of the NASDAQ ""storm""...good sign of at least a bottom and may indicate a worthwhile entry point...I'd still like to see better volume."
Let’s get a Green Day here cmon
VIRT is up 5.68% to 21.60
Bought more today!
They have earnings coming up Hopefully that will help.Stock has a terrible downtrend going
New rules for smallcaps trading may be coming.
"I'm still concerned here. How the hell can these analysts predict EPS of $1.39?! That seems way too high, and leaves little room for a massive surprise. I think best case scenario is we hit $1.45 EPS for the quarter. Obviously that's insane but the market is already pricing in $1.39 EPS...if the limit is only 6 cents above that, I'm nervous because it leaves a 6 cent spread. Otherwise, if we show anything less than $1.39 we're probably going to drop. They're going to need to show $800M in total revenue + $1.45 in EPS. I think this would send the stock flying...but what do I know? I guess we'll see."
With these returns this is at least $40 per share. At least.
Buying under $23.25
VIRT is up 9.77% to 22.70
Wow ! Great numbers
Transaction tax being considered by WH and congress-VIRT will get hurt.
Wow it's starting to fly now. Great momentum and volume building
"Red day. Never like to see it. Still bullish. Excited for ER and for attention to brought to the company. As one might say, a flower in the desert"
"Eric brings up great points from the 10k. The market conditions are perfect for VIRT. Trading volumes are very high still, especially when compared to 2019. SPY is still trading at around 100m shares a day, double of what it was averaging last year. The LOC of credit from Vincent Viola does have question marks attached to it. Perhaps reading the SEC filing that would be most beneficial."
"Just mentioned on closing bell as a good trade, by Josh whatever."
no end in sight. I thought 20 was fair price... boy was I wrong
Finally catching a bid....let’s see if it holds
VIRT was hacked by the Chinese for $6.9 million as reported by the Wall Street Journal.www.wsj.com/...Virtu Financial Inc. said it lost $6.9 million to hackers who seized control of the email account of one of its executives and used fake emails to send two fraudulent wire transfers to bank accounts in China.I am guessing this is why the CFO was forced out. I hope they fixed it and learned a lesson. I would also like to see a press release discussing this.
I'm a long-term holder of this stock. Portfolios with long volatility positions outperform standard holdings over the long run.
"See this as a short term play aka 3-6 months really until this corona dies down,but it’s gonna get worse before it gets better but you see that 2018 how it spiked to 37?well volatility at all time high rn so don’t be surprised to see this reach those levels within the next few months or even more."
"This stock is going to hit $30, minimum, over the next 3-4 weeks (if not sooner). They reported February earnings on March 3. When they did so, they only captured the last few days of volatility. Since the beginning of March, the market has been volatile (that's an understatement). I honestly would not be surprised to see an average of $15 million/day in income from trading since the beginning of March. That would mean they have already made $120M this month. Even assuming a return to normal for the remainder of the month, they will have made about $200M in March - about a 100% increase over February. It's gonna be incredible."
"Where does everyone ""read"" about these warrants that price today? I looked over the 10K and proxy and saw:1)3.077 warrants priced at $19.002)3.0 million RSUs priced at about $24 that expire in about 5 years."
well Zacks says sell.. thats a definite upgrade 4 me.. JP Morgan says Buy with a $23 price target..
