"Hong Kong residents were allowed to move to Great Britain, 70% were eligible to move. Good luck with that!"
"edmund, your right & everyone loves chicken!"
"Better cover, they beat the estimate by .07 cents. They bought back 2.7 million shares last qtr. opened 350 stores in last qtr. net income increased 15% to 203 millions"
the major 10 days labor holiday of China is coming in October. lots of people in China would be traveling back home to visit their families. Chinese loves to eat out. This would bring good business to YUMC. Remember October.
They had some interesting insights about YUMC on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Anybody here been ""here"" a while? Looking for good entry point. Thinking $30 will it get there? Thoughts?"
"YUMC is fixing to bust $50.00 in the next three months and there will be no more turning back, this management team has all the right ideas such as combining KFC with gas stations, keep a close eye on this."
"Dat earnings report, im ready for an insane day tomorrow"
"Latest from China news, more stores to be shut down. 31,161 people had contracted the infection in China, and more than 630 people than died. Beginning of the Jan 1000-2000 contracted, now 31,000. The fact is from 1k to 31k in 1 month. Management reported scenarios of shutting down 30% was from Jan., 2020. Now, 30 times more infected and you know local officials were hiding death tolls. At this rate, next month could be 30 times 31 K =930,000 cases! If affects all the chains in YUMC and could be a complete shutdown. The only certainty is the loss is mounting."
YUMC is up 46.99% to 38.29
"Who knows best what would be the value of the company, it is obviously the buyer and the seller. The buyer is willing to pay 46 dollars a share on a 32 dollar stock price and the seller is declining the 46 dollars share price. it is not a rocket science to figure out the stock price at 32 dollars is very cheap."
Love the pop today over 46. To the moon baby
YUMC 100% Strong Buy per Barchart ! This is a Fantastic opportunity at the current price. Great stock.
They all have loss of revenue insurance
Bought some last week for long term hold
Report says $46 a share!! Well done ;-)
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks.All you'd need to do is send Steve a messagewhats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR on Te** le* gram @ ( SteveFX01 )"
"After all the bad press put out on YUMC after the deal feel thru, is anyone else pleasantly relieved to see a slow upward climb back toward where it feel from. Might there still be interested parties for a take-out, or is this just a healthy retracement based upon fundamentals?"
This was a good quarter with earnings beat and revenue beat. Outlook looks good. Buy the dip.
"Gonna drift down a little before new development of the offer. They may call it off for now, wait for a quarter or so, see new business result, then make a move again, could also be this winter, when restaurant business is at it's lowest, IMO."
Price was $27 in 2017. Hope Yumc falls back to that level so I can buy some.
I hope the longs on this board changed their mind ! Public finally understand risks with food and delivery difficulties at this time.
any reasons why this is up over 20% in the last hour? can't find any news..
Good buy around $30
Nice day today
Monday these will drop once the media blows this out for their weekend news circus. Easy money with patience here.
Finally back to where I bought it. 37.70. I was hoping for the 45.00 offer but now this may be better to wait it out like I did with YUM. Good companies. You got to eat.
everybody needs to eat. long term winner
Chances are this will be bought out at the end of October --Would $50 be the take out price?
"please understand..they have about 4,500 KFCs in China.....how many are in the US??? 22,000. if you think they are going down, fine.....they will not stay down. Good luck longs.."

"What corporate action?Date: 03-02-2020 We have canceled the trade trigger(s) for YUMC in your TD Ameritrade account ending in xxxx because that company has reported a corporate action. Corporate actions can include stock splits, dividend payments, or other events that may affect shares of the security."
"Just started a small position in YUMC. KFC seems to be huge in China and in Asia so, why not? "
Don't vote to sell your shares. I like holding this one.
"Good price to get in.Bought some for hold.Winter Olympic will draw interest in American food.Sbux is a buy also.We may not like each other at the government level, but Chinese people love KFC and McDonald's. Just about one in a few blocks in Hong Kong.SBUX is expensive but they still pay the price."
First stock I purchased was Yum. 9 little shares at $26 each. I don’t have lots of cash to invest in things but have enjoyed watching this one grow!
