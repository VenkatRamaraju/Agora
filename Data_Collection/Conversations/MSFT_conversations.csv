"WOW! MSFT is on a tear! I have a few shares and added a few more recently. It is one of the stocks where I could only buy a few because of its price and it has been a steady performer. I finally decided to add a few more after its run up and it has continued to move strongly. I wonder what a split will make the stock do, like NVDA. God Bless and stay well."

MSFT Citi analyst Tyler Radke raised the firm's price target on Microsoft to $411 from $378 and reiterates a Buy rating on the shares. Into a ""high bar,"" Microsoft delivered a ""strong performance"" in Q4 with 4% revenue upside and even stronger profitability, Radke tells investors in a research note. While Azure growth at 45% was stable versus last quarter despite a 10 point easier comp, on closer inspection it appears the Azure consumption component is reaccelerating, says the analyst.

"In 1998 at 19yo I inherited $38,000. As a greedy kid I wanted to buy a new vehicle and a few toys. After mentioning this stupid plan to spend my money to my Dad he was not happy. He told me my inheritance was hard earned money by my grandfather and if wanted to blow it and have nothing to show for it in 5 to 10 years so be it, it was my choice... or I could go talk to his financial advisor and invest it into a stock that could change my life. Well, I didn't want to but I sat down with the advisor and he convinced me to buy 100 shares of msft. After it split a few times in the late 90's, and buying a few more shares, I had 1000 shares which I still own today. From 2000 to 2015 msft stock didn't do much to impress me and I was close to selling it many times but I didn't. Now my average cost of $19 per share is worth $328,101. Thank God I held on to it. I'm 42 now and plan to be even happier than I am now in the years to come."

Institutional sell off for a day or two and then back to slow but steady growth.

Immense thank you to Bill Gates and his co-founder and brilliant Satya for executing on a business model second to none.

"If you are new to investing or only know one name in stocks, it should be MSFT."

Red day all over the market . Green day tommorow and msft will deploy to the moon
Wouldn’t surprise me if stock split gets announced after the cyber security announcement.
Next quarter msft should raise dividends. Am I correct on that?If so by how much due you think. .05
Vamos Softy! Me thinks more good news on the horizon from this gem of a company. The House of Satya doesn’t disappoint. 
Every new high shows how abysmally terrible balmer was ..
Microsoft has grown to be my largest holding and I am a happy camper!

Buy every time MSFT goes up $10.00. Started at $130.00 This will be my 16th buy at $290.00
With the taper they need to have bigger dividend!
There aren't many things you can trust in this world.A MSFT investment is one of them.
"Microsoft is not just a company, it's a rocket. And the rocket just landed on the moon. Next stop is Mars at 350."
Selling off a bit before lunch with some normal profit taking . Seeing as this is options expiration day - there’s really no telling where we end up today but I’m going to hazard two guesses . Either it turns and flies to $307 + after lunch or it settles down quietly under $303 .
What happened to the rapid market sell-off that started yesterday afternoon? Is the bear session already over? Any suggestions?
This bird is flying to $338 this year.
"I bought in as soon as Ballmer ""left"" Microsoft. I am a small investor (I just do it for thrills), but Microsoft's rise has been nothing short of remarkable. Who knows, maybe I'll be able to someday retire with my few shares."
WOOOOHOOOO SATYA
$aapl and $msft hitting all time highs... Their market cap combined is around $4.7T
MSFT is the textbook buy and hold stock.performance and stability for decades.
Wow it broke $300 in early trading.
Awesome finish with buyers throwing fists full of Dollars at the stock. $300 getting now into focus. What a great feeling being a LONG TIME LONG! 
the stock has posted magnificent gains. why the 2 week decline still? the quarter over quarter results are just absolutely amazing for a company this size.
Microsoft is the best investment on the market. Steady growth with excellent results year after year after year. You just invest your money in it and go back to what ever you were doing without having to think about it.Go back to check once a year and SURPRISE you just made a nice 30% profit year after year after year.The stock is consolidating at the moment. Within the next week or so it will start going up quickly to catchup and back to normal for a while with a constant rhytm up.
impressive
MSFT should be a mainstay of your portfolio for growth and stability simultaneously.
just saw up 19$ for tomorrow for microsoft up to 312...2 mins later went to -56 cents...wow got all excited.
MSFT is the Must-Have in the long portfolio. Just buy the Dip if you could.
"Good time to add some shares. Technology will explode going forward, and MSFT will be the leader."
Microsoft to put in $20 billion dollars toward fighting cybercrime.That is worth another $20.00 to $25.00 upside above Microsoft 52 week High.
Anyone who shorts the best buy and hold stock ever must not have an institutional memory or any memory for that matter.
A MSFT purchase is the smartest move you'll ever make.
I bought at $28 eight years ago and collected $13/share in dividends in that time frame. Don't bother trading in and out. Ignore the noise. Just buy and hold.
Buy now and you'll be in when we go through $300!
"Microsoft on its way to 3 trillion dollars in market cap. learn a valuable lesson. never sell the shares. bill gates would be worth over 500 billion dollars now, if he didn't sell a share. all he had to do, was take a margin loan, if he needed to access money. his biggest strategic mistake ever, besides divorcing melinda."

Every quarter the Funds must release their holdings 15 days after the close of the quarter. This has been a treasure trove of information for me for decades. I go through Morningstar and Kiplinger’s list of the top rated funds and see their Top Ten holdings and make note of. After looking through a long laundry list of their top rated Funds it became quite apparent that the clear choice of both Growth and Large Cap Funds that MSFT was their top choice. Not even close. This was as of June 30th and there was a definite undeniable pattern of Softy being #1. I think this scenario has been playing out recently with the big move in the stock. As deep throat said “ Follow the Money” 
Me thinks I have whiplash from following MSFT’s trading action today. Just a matter of time till we make the made dash to $300. 
NEW HIGH TODAY..we love MSFT!
Why all of a sudden is MSFT falling or stagnant when NASDAQ is up big?
I posted on this board two weeks ago that the options open interest for expiration august 20th calls and puts suggested that there was a straddle in play it the strike300 now that we have hit 300$ next stop 340$ on or before November 16th expiration
Good time to load up a bit more. Just added another 15 stocks.
Dividend raise this year￼??
I don't believe there is a better stock at the moment then Microsoft.I doubled my money every 30 months for the last 6 years. I wish I had millions of $ to put in. I would gladly do so.In 7 years i will be millionaire in good part because of my investments in Microsoft.
When can we see some DIVIDEND raise news?
"""China Slashes Kids’ Gaming Time to Just Three Hours a Week"" No gaming. How will MSFT make money."

MSFT is a quality stock. I hold it in brokerage and never sell. But I trade in and out in my Ira. Big mistake and it got away from me. I’m patient but probably have to get in at high price. Waiting.
Running out of superlatives to describe this company. We’re up 31% YTD not including dividends. And we have the best months coming up. Must own stock for any serious portfolio 
Yet another all time high for Softy! Like I said at the time THAT earnings report was Stellar. Azure growing over 50%! Ufffff. Vamos! 
Wouldn't it be a great world if everyone could perform their respect job as well as CEO Satya performs his?

I’m selling well I’m still making a big profit I should’ve sold when it went up to five points because you know they’re gonna take it back down it’ll never go over 300 again. And they see what’s going on in Afghanistan in the whole world do you actually think stocks are going to go up.
"Microsoft price targets raised to $350 at UBS, Wedbush and Mizuho... all from $325"
Weekly options related selloff - 297.50….
"Just my opinion - don't overthink market timing now. The thing I've learned watching the market since 1997 is when EVERYONE says something is going to happen, it doesn't. If there is a big macro event that normally WOULD drop the market 10%, chances are people will start nibbling when it's down around 5%, hoping to average down the rest. You get thousands of people/entities nibbling, that accumulates into a frankenstein of buying. EVERYONE saying MSFT and the faangs have to sell off hard to mark a major sell off is ""textbook true"" but there are TONS of people like me who nibble now that buying is commission-free. Not to mention funds that need to play catch-up this year. Could I be wrong? OF COURSE. However everyone is too damn sure a market collapse is coming."
