Mr Softie owns the cloud.
MSFT will always be my largest holding. Another earnings win. Maybe avoid the dip this time? I'll probably add more if it dips.
"Wowser!A 2.3 trillion market cap and revenues increased by 22% and gross margins increased, every segment of the business clicking.Pouring thru the numbers they are just outstanding, and now we know why Msft continued its uptrend pre-earnings. No reason not to grind higher post-earnings, especially when analysts start raising their numbers. Hard to imagine that less than 10 years ago this gem was withering away and merely an ‘old tech’ dividend play. How things have changed since they reinvented themselves.One of the best companies on this here planet earth."
There is no way my micro is going soft with this price action today!
this will climb up to $400.00
Huge volume as the market sold off and retailers moved to ‘softy’. Congrats longs! GLTA
avg PT is $370 after 10 upgrades.. Onward to $350+
Headed to 3T MC
Dan Ives at WedBush upped Price Target on MSFT to $400!
Microsoft will be the first company to hit 3 trillion dollars in market cap.
"Microsoft Corporation was among the top contributors to performance during the third quarter. Microsoft is a Positive Dynamic Change beneficiary of corporate America’s transformative digitization. Microsoft's enterprise cloud product, Azure, is rapidly growing and accruing market share. Microsoft reported that Azure grew 51% in the second quarter. This high unit volume growth is a primary driver of the company's higher share price, but the company’s strong operating execution has enabled margin expansion that has also helped to increase forward earnings estimates. We believe Microsoft's subscription-based software offerings and cloud computing services have a durable growth profile because they enhance customers’ growth initiatives and help them to diminish costs. Additionally, investors appreciate Microsoft's strong free cash flow generation and its return of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases."""
Softy has breached $330! Just unreal. That's a cool 48% gain since January. My only wish is that the dividend gets increased like four-fold.
Now that was a strong close.
Best thing done in the last few years was getting rid of Balmer. Dead money for all those years!
"Bought this at $28 eight years ago when Ballmer was CEO. Now with a three ahead of my cost price, and a dividend yield over 8%."
"Harriet Woodward, has a new target of $395.00per share for MSFT!"
That EPS beat is MASSIVE. Holy Cow is Microsoft run well.
"280 to 320+ since Oct 4th...Nice, and congrats to everyone that bought 3 weeks ago as the experts were telling us that week the entire market was tanking."
the best week-end I ever had in a long time ! Thank you MSFT ! Viva Mr. Satya
Thank you Satya Nadella! Looks like Microsoft will claim #1 spot as most valuable company...
MSFT 380 to 400 by end of year by this time next 450 to 500 I am long MSFT 20 years by this time next year a 3 + trillion dollar company
"This is one great company. Perhaps, the only one that deserves a $Trillion valuation in today's market that is so full of ponzies"
"that mfst is up in after hours trading after both amzn and appl miss? good sign, IMO."
"Dean Sheen, has new target price of $375.00per share for MSFT."

We will exceed $360.00 per share by Christmas.Lohr Group adding to their position.
"Loading up big time, This is going for $400 over next few months if not weeks."
"After those stellar earnings, MSFT should be over $360 by now, as it heads for the $400s.Oh well. I guess slow and steady works too. "
Congrats to all longs. 550 shares here at average of $142. And to think this was dead money for the better part of 15 years. Thank YOU cloud.
"Here is the deal""With respect to guidance, Microsoft called for $50.15 billion to $51.05 billion in fiscal second-quarter revenue. That works out to $50.60 billion at the middle of the range, passing the $48.92 billion consensus among analysts polled by Refinitiv."""
Satya's brilliant management shines through every day.
"""I don't know how much better it can get from Microsoft,"" noted Brent Thill, an analyst with Jefferies. ""To grow at that rate, at their size, is insane. I have no other way to put it... Both of these stocks [Microsoft and Google] have just been massive outperformers."""
"318+! We got bingo! I posted this last night: ""Several mutual fund families end their fiscal year on 10/31. There may be more panic buying the next three days from portfolio managers who NEED to show fund holders that they own MSFT in their year-end report."""
"I have no doubt they’re gonna beat today, history tells that msft almost always dips after earnings so buyers beware."
Tech investors are rotating to MSFT
Absolutely love the action of this stock. None better for a good investment.
"I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Brad Johnson program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having $70k to $800k in just 8 weeks. you can contact him no matter how the little the investment is."
Wow there it is. 328! Here’s to more growth!
"Sell Apple and Amazon, buy What?"
400-500 PT in 12 is very real! Analysts agree.
Is this the first time MSFT has been the most valuable company in the world?
Solid Finish today
Satya and team: thank you for putting your heart and soul into MSFT
At this rate Microsoft could pass Apple in MC this week! Totally outperforming Apple this year
"$MSFT Feeling a lot more comfortable holding Microsoft into earnings vs my FB, Google, and Apple holdings. Been a strange week for social media stock and advertising. Still think Google is cheapest here but I'm referring to the uncertainty of movement around earnings. Microsoft just feels safer to me here. Own some of all, more of Microsoft. Thoughts?"
"I was going to buy a new car a couple of years ago but opted to park the money in MSFT instead. Now I can buy two cars, but I think I'm going to keep holding and buy an apartment XD"
"MSFT is usually valued at a PE ratio of 35. Taking the new EPS of 2.71 x 4 = 10.84, the new share price target should be 380. And that's not even including additional growth for each future quarter."
I’ve been buying Microsoft for years because I have no time for games !
$400 by end of the year!
"Going to 350 by end of next week. Investors are starting to realize THIS is the stock to hedge against inflation, supply chain issues, etc."
Microsoft #1 buying and holding more shares each paycheck has payed off
Microsoft is also within metaverse and crypto tokens…. that 400+ target could be undervalued.
This feels like Amazon and Apple shareholders looking for other places to put their money lol
INCREDIBLE! You invest in Microsoft (no risk) and you get an annual return between 30-45%.Try to beat that!I mean NO Risk!!
is now a good time to buy msft stock. i mean buying at the highest point?
"Historical prices tell the tale: MSFT is tailor-made for long term holders or true investors, not speculators."
Microsoft could hit $329.25 to $335.25 today.
"Microsoft’s first-quarter fiscal 2022 results are expected to have benefited from the continued strength in its cloud computing platform, Azure, which has been witnessing rapid adoption of the ongoing digitalization among business enterprises. The solid momentum across its Windows Commercial products and workspace communication tool — Teams — is also likely to have aided its performance in the quarter under review. The growing demand for Microsoft 365 and advanced security solutions is expected to have contributed well to top-line growth."
"Total company revenue climbed almost 22% year over year,. That’s the fastest growth since 2018. Revenue grew 21% in the previous quarter.Microsoft reported $20.5 billion in net income, growing 48%."
"Can we get a 2% rise today? Getting close! We started the week at around $304 ! Needless to say,a record week!"
This should be a core holding in everyone's portfolio. This is close to a perfect company for the following reasons. 1)Strong buybacks plus dividend2) Still reinvesting large amounts of money back into the business. 3) red hot growth in the enterprise cloud -AZURE. 4)Net cash balance sheet. 5) Amazing leadershipThat's just a few of many reasons to buy this stock and hold it for years to come.
Fully Expect $400+ in a quarter. Earnings Looking Strong.
"Hi, I'm planning to enter this stock now for retirement in the next 10 years.Is there any possibility to crash MSFT stock price at all for the next 10 years?"
I'm not rich but I put 50 dollars every other week and every other month additional 100 dollars and at this rate it will be my first stock to reach 5k! Lets go!
"CNBC ProCramer calls Microsoft earnings ‘best quarter of the year’PUBLISHED WED, OCT 27 202110:25 AM EDT"
"AI, Cloud, Gaming All gonna power Microsoft's future growth, $400 will be most conservative target for MSFT by 2022."
Last year was Apples year. This year has been Microsoft that has outperformed. I owned both. That’s how I know. Two must haves for any portfolio.Enjoy!!!
Azure cloud growth 50%..digest that for a moment; gaming thriving via Xbox and a favorable response to Windows 11. Can you ask for more?
"Lets Go, Microsoft starting today will take the #1 Crown in Market Cap again, And will be $400+ by 2022."
"AAPL gets all the media attention because it is in the consumer market, but it is MSFT that should be the most valuable company in the world."
"After 1Q22 results, it will be interesting to see the upgraded estimates on MSFT's stock price ...."
Red Wave coming to Virginia Governor Elections next Tue . We are rejecting the Socialist teachers !
MSFTMSFT dethroned Apple with respect to market capital.
"According to Ives, Microsoft, which has seen its stock jump 39% year-to-date to $310.11 a share as of Tuesday, is set to cross the $400 threshold. The stock was up just over 3% on Wednesday morning, trading at roughly $319 a share."
I sold Microsoft around 246 thinking it was going to go down more and then I had to buy back at the 265 mark. I think this is a stock you need to keep adding to your portfolio instead of selling.
"“I think this is just more fuel in the engine to drive this stock higher,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance Live. “It just shows [Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella] in this cloud arms race is continuing to gain share.”According to Ives, Microsoft, which has seen its stock jump 39% year-to-date to $310.11 a share as of Tuesday, is set to cross the $400 threshold.

"Congrats to all long, MSFT is the largest company as of now"
"If you are not day trader than stop thinking about daily price movement, Microsoft showed beautiful quarter, look at this numbers. We will see it climb this and next month anyway"
The p/e went from a tad over 40x to under 37x because of the awesome EPS. Buybacks will also reduce the p/e multiple.Buy and hold.
Best investment ever
Option chain looks bullish into November will we see 340 in November? I will keep looking at charts as long as markets stay bullish I see us pushing up to 330-340 range 
King Microsoft! It has been great stock since Bill Gates left. Moving to the Cloud and focus on services and not hardware was just game changer.This is the sure stock to own whatever the market does... Even better than Google who can be subject to all kind of lawsuits and restrictions by countries...
Buy Microsoft vs Apple. Microsoft buy Apple will decline to closer to 100 Microsoft will go past 420-460 in oder for it to go down know is not pullback but earning which I dont see in the near future.
One word to shorts: Cover!
Most of Microsoft’s revenue is from software vs apple and their hardware. Microsoft will be dominant for long time for this reason. They won’t be restricted due to supply constraints
Waiting for AMZN earnings release.We could see stock blast off in after hours.

Surprise MSFT ISN’T ALREADY AT $360 after those earnings and forward guidance. But it gives us more time to accumulate. 
My wife still whined about me not buying more MSFT at $202 last fall...
"Apple taking a bit hit in the AH, so for $MSFT this might mean that tomorrow we may have the new largest company (based on a market cap) in the world. Imagine if you were told this in 2010, I bet nobody would’ve believed that but yeah, big improvements have happened since then and the future is looking promising."
"I'll wait a little bit before buying $fb and $msft, but these companies have a lot of potential for the futur."
Best company to own. They don't have to deal with alot of the b.s that plague other companies.
Can't go wrong with Microsoft.
options are very expensive. Took massive losses on my put options
love this low-key company which stays away from regulators and negative press. also love the cloud business and Office 360 recurring revenue model.
wish I had money to invest in Microsoft few months back
"Microsoft has an analyst consensus of Strong Buy, with a price target consensus of $342.40, a 10.1% upside from current levels. In a report issued on October 18, Morgan Stanley also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $331.00 price target."
