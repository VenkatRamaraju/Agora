I still think buying a home is the best investment any individual can make..
This price action could be investors rolling out of Chinese tech into US tech.

Microsoft to put in $20 billion dollars toward fighting cybercrime.That is worth another $20.00 to $25.00 upside above Microsoft 52 week High.
"3 days in a row Market up, monday and tuesday up huge and msft losing, very strange weakness,that's not msft like, when market was up msft was always up more or at least up with the market but never red when market is green. Seams some big fish need to get in cheap"
"I only own 200 shares at $253, thought I was paying too much. Glad I was wrong….one more time, lol"
"Good time to add some shares. Technology will explode going forward, and MSFT will be the leader."
"With rates to stay at zero for years to come and business booming, there is no reason the stock price won’t continue to rise with the spectacular earnings."
"Tortoise or the hare? I continue to believe in MFST and Nadella - back in July or maybe it was June, remember when it struggled to top $280? And here we are now, yet still the doubters sing the ""overvalued"" song. There is a reason so many institutions own this stock. Maybe it's boring and lacks the glitz. But I'll stick with the tortoise and enjoy the long term gain."
"In 2003 my father bought 200 shares of MSFT for $26.00 per share. When he passed away in 2010 I simply left it alone. I figured he knew what he was doing. Boy, did he ever."
Ives: billions to be made in cloud security and MSFT is extremely well positioned.
Here we go. On the way to $306-$308.Undervalued.
just as I suggested previously two weeks ago post-MSFT is now trading above 300$
"I bought in as soon as Ballmer ""left"" Microsoft. I am a small investor (I just do it for thrills), but Microsoft's rise has been nothing short of remarkable. Who knows, maybe I'll be able to someday retire with my few shares."
Every quarter the Funds must release their holdings 15 days after the close of the quarter. This has been a treasure trove of information for me for decades. I go through Morningstar and Kiplinger’s list of the top rated funds and see their Top Ten holdings and make note of. After looking through a long laundry list of their top rated Funds it became quite apparent that the clear choice of both Growth and Large Cap Funds that MSFT was their top choice. Not even close. This was as of June 30th and there was a definite undeniable pattern of Softy being #1. I think this scenario has been playing out recently with the big move in the stock. As deep throat said “ Follow the Money” 
Let’s hope we stay above $300 today
Dividend raise this year￼??
0.05% gain on a day Nasdaq is up 1.00% is akin to a -0.95% day. Change my view.
"If anyone is after overnight riches, then this thread is not for you. Steadfast wealth growth, lifetime investment, then u r in the right place. No need to check price every 5 minutes."
"Price being affected by options trades. Which means, possible large upside on Monday."
Wouldn’t surprise me if stock split gets announced after the cyber security announcement.
Wedbush increased target price today to $350 based on growth of Azure cloud.
315 this week
This bird is flying to $338 this year.
We’re just $5 off our high. A bit of consolidation before our next big leg up. We’ve had a phenomenal year so far this year. A well deserved respite before we soar again. Arriba! 
MSFT to invest billions into Cybersecurity over the next five years.Another area of growth and profit.
"MSFT will probably be worth 10 times or more, what it is now, within the next 3 to 4 years. Those of you who are not tech savy. The Cloud is the first step to the next step in the VR and RL world of technology in business and entertainment. That is the Metaverse, in which Microsoft will be the catalyst of this new world in business and entertainment."
Well done Softy! We finished strongly in the winner’s column and within shouting distance of a new high. Fabulous start to the week 
I really feel left aside hearing and seeing several testimonies from people on profits they make from crypto/Forex investments. Can someone please recommend a good expert that can trade on my behalf and generate profits for me
Here's to 305 tomorrow!
$307 tomorrow. Yup.
I bought at $28 eight years ago and collected $13/share in dividends in that time frame. Don't bother trading in and out. Ignore the noise. Just buy and hold.
Vamos Softy! Me thinks more good news on the horizon from this gem of a company. The House of Satya doesn’t disappoint.

"Fed just announced low interest rates very long term. This will help all assets, but growth stocks in particular."
Buy now and you'll be in when we go through $300!
"Lesson learned, never bet against FANG. bought $pltr for the last 9 months and got stuck in low $22-24 for months,the I sold 3400 shares to buy more MSFT! MSFT to the moon $350 soon!"
Why all of a sudden is MSFT falling or stagnant when NASDAQ is up big?
MSFT is the textbook buy and hold stock.performance and stability for decades.
