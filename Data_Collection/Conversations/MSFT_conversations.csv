I bought 100 shares of msft at 217 on Jan 20 2021 as an investment for the long term. Very glad I did. Go MSFT!
My wife still whined about me not buying more MSFT at $202 last fall...
"CNBC ProCramer calls Microsoft earnings ‘best quarter of the year’PUBLISHED WED, OCT 27 202110:25 AM EDT"
options are very expensive. Took massive losses on my put options
"All the Apple & Amzn money going into MSFT Tomorrow Crammer called this the best quarter that any stock posted the entire year even beating FB,Q2"
Now that was a strong close.
"Loading up big time, This is going for $400 over next few months if not weeks."
"Wowser!A 2.3 trillion market cap and revenues increased by 22% and gross margins increased, every segment of the business clicking.Pouring thru the numbers they are just outstanding, and now we know why Msft continued its uptrend pre-earnings. No reason not to grind higher post-earnings, especially when analysts start raising their numbers. Hard to imagine that less than 10 years ago this gem was withering away and merely an ‘old tech’ dividend play. How things have changed since they reinvented themselves.One of the best companies on this here planet earth."
New target: $410.
"AAPL gets all the media attention because it is in the consumer market, but it is MSFT that should be the most valuable company in the world."
MSFT + AAPL = $5T market cap. Incredible.
"Bought this at $28 eight years ago when Ballmer was CEO. Now with a three ahead of my cost price, and a dividend yield over 8%."
Is this the first time MSFT has been the most valuable company in the world?
"After 1Q22 results, it will be interesting to see the upgraded estimates on MSFT's stock price ...."
"280 to 320+ since Oct 4th...Nice, and congrats to everyone that bought 3 weeks ago as the experts were telling us that week the entire market was tanking."
Microsoft is also within metaverse and crypto tokens…. that 400+ target could be undervalued.
Revenue: $45.3 billion versus $43.93 billion expectedEarnings per share: $2.71 versus $2.07 expectedIntelligent Cloud: $16.98 versus $16.58 billion expectedProductivity & Business processes: $15.04 versus $14.70 billion expectedMore personal computing: $13.31 versus $12.68 billion expected
congrats longs another important milestone today
"Dean Sheen, has new target price of $375.00per share for MSFT."
Congrats to all longs. 550 shares here at average of $142. And to think this was dead money for the better part of 15 years. Thank YOU cloud.
Softy has breached $330! Just unreal. That's a cool 48% gain since January. My only wish is that the dividend gets increased like four-fold.
Microsoft #1 buying and holding more shares each paycheck has payed off
This should be a core holding in everyone's portfolio. This is close to a perfect company for the following reasons. 1)Strong buybacks plus dividend2) Still reinvesting large amounts of money back into the business. 3) red hot growth in the enterprise cloud -AZURE. 4)Net cash balance sheet. 5) Amazing leadershipThat's just a few of many reasons to buy this stock and hold it for years to come.
"MSFT is to investing, what water is to life! Buy, Hold, Prosper"
King Microsoft! It has been great stock since Bill Gates left. Moving to the Cloud and focus on services and not hardware was just game changer.This is the sure stock to own whatever the market does... Even better than Google who can be subject to all kind of lawsuits and restrictions by countries...
I'm not rich but I put 50 dollars every other week and every other month additional 100 dollars and at this rate it will be my first stock to reach 5k! Lets go!
"I was going to buy a new car a couple of years ago but opted to park the money in MSFT instead. Now I can buy two cars, but I think I'm going to keep holding and buy an apartment XD"
Surprise MSFT ISN’T ALREADY AT $360 after those earnings and forward guidance. But it gives us more time to accumulate. 
Best thing done in the last few years was getting rid of Balmer. Dead money for all those years!
MSFTMSFT dethroned Apple with respect to market capital.
wish I had money to invest in Microsoft few months back
$MSFT 9 upgrades today.. Avg PT $368
"Apple taking a bit hit in the AH, so for $MSFT this might mean that tomorrow we may have the new largest company (based on a market cap) in the world. Imagine if you were told this in 2010, I bet nobody would’ve believed that but yeah, big improvements have happened since then and the future is looking promising."
"Microsoft has an analyst consensus of Strong Buy, with a price target consensus of $342.40, a 10.1% upside from current levels. In a report issued on October 18, Morgan Stanley also maintained a Buy rating on the stock with a $331.00 price target."
MSFT 380 to 400 by end of year by this time next 450 to 500 I am long MSFT 20 years by this time next year a 3 + trillion dollar company
I’ve been buying Microsoft for years because I have no time for games !
I will sell my shares the day I need my money  for buying a condo. In Microsoft bank I trust.
"Update: 325+! We got bingo!! I posted this last night: ""Several mutual fund families end their fiscal year on 10/31. There may be more panic buying the next three days from portfolio managers who NEED to show fund holders that they own MSFT in their year-end report."""
Absolutely love the action of this stock. None better for a good investment.
is now a good time to buy msft stock. i mean buying at the highest point?
"Congrats to all long, MSFT is the largest company as of now"
"Wow. Microsoft was reborn hard. How do they keep doing this? Congrats, MSFT management. You're the kingpin of the Tech Big Boys."
"Lets Go, Microsoft starting today will take the #1 Crown in Market Cap again, And will be $400+ by 2022."
Most of Microsoft’s revenue is from software vs apple and their hardware. Microsoft will be dominant for long time for this reason. They won’t be restricted due to supply constraints
"MSFT is usually valued at a PE ratio of 35. Taking the new EPS of 2.71 x 4 = 10.84, the new share price target should be 380. And that's not even including additional growth for each future quarter."
"BUYNG MSFT DOWN HERE OR LOWER IS LIKE FREE MONEY. ACCUMULATE AS MUCH AS YOU CAN at these lower prices, before it’s trading much higher."
Microsoft will be the first company to hit 3 trillion dollars in market cap.
"To avoid making losses while trading, you need to get full understanding and knowledge of trading and holding"
Option chain looks bullish into November will we see 340 in November? I will keep looking at charts as long as markets stay bullish I see us pushing up to 330-340 range 
At this rate Microsoft could pass Apple in MC this week! Totally outperforming Apple this year
End of year price predictions...? Mine: $350...
"that mfst is up in after hours trading after both amzn and appl miss? good sign, IMO."
"Going to 350 by end of next week. Investors are starting to realize THIS is the stock to hedge against inflation, supply chain issues, etc."
Fully Expect $400+ in a quarter. Earnings Looking Strong.
"Microsoft’s first-quarter fiscal 2022 results are expected to have benefited from the continued strength in its cloud computing platform, Azure, which has been witnessing rapid adoption of the ongoing digitalization among business enterprises. The solid momentum across its Windows Commercial products and workspace communication tool — Teams — is also likely to have aided its performance in the quarter under review. The growing demand for Microsoft 365 and advanced security solutions is expected to have contributed well to top-line growth."
"Total company revenue climbed almost 22% year over year,. That’s the fastest growth since 2018. Revenue grew 21% in the previous quarter.Microsoft reported $20.5 billion in net income, growing 48%."
This feels like Amazon and Apple shareholders looking for other places to put their money lol
Solid Finish today
The p/e went from a tad over 40x to under 37x because of the awesome EPS. Buybacks will also reduce the p/e multiple.Buy and hold.
$400 by end of the year!
