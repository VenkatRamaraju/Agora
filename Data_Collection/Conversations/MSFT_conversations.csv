Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow maintained Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) with an Overweight and raised the price target from $330 to $345.
"Still has my MSFT Shares, but bought last week Tesla and it already works. Tesla with a PE of 500 flying high and over 800 and MSFT drops like a rock. MSFT is to cheap and has a to strong market position for this market environment. With interest rates climbing you need to buy the most expensive stock out there with big competition. Thats the way you make money in this market. Throw out all your logic and you will win.Few weeks ago MSFT was on days like this in green and the most save haven, now it is Tesla."
"I love how people come to message boards with a big announcement that the market is crashing!!!! Seriously, investors aren't the ones you need to warn. If the market crashes, investors aren't the ones that will be hurt. Investors have money set aside in safe funds to go get in the event of a crash or correction. It's a buying opportunity for us, not a life-changing event. I made more money during 2020 as a result of the COVID pandemic than I had in the 3 years prior. What you should do is go warn single parents, low income inner city folks, young people who are still looking for a job out of college. People who will actually feel it."
what happens next week if demos. are able to pass some free stuff spending bill?
We are doing good in comparison to FB.
"Not concerned about Microsoft at all. Have seen Microsoft repeat this chart pattern several times. The stock would trade in a price range, relative strength, and momentum for 4 - 8 weeks then POP to a new high."
MSFT just shutdown LinkedIn in China.
"This is the corporation of the world, will be 5 trillion by 2030."
"$MSFT just confirmed their earnings report date for Tuesday October 26, after market closed. Consensus EPS: $2.06Consensus Revenue: $43.82 Bil"
Well I just pulled the trigger and started a position in MSFT. Will dollar cost down during this selling. I own Apple and now Msft. Two of the best!
"As MSFT continues to grow, what other technologies are they working on that are not available yet?"
Lovely comeback from Softy and we didn’t give back any of yesterday’s jaw dropping gain as we finished in green pastures. We’ve already had a stellar year with a YTD gain including dividends just shy of 40%. Any gains from here to year end is gravy or as I like to say……..Salsa jeje 
"At 8:49 a.m., when this stock was yoyoing between $285 and $286, I said that this stock would hit $292 today. Someone specifically said I was dreaming. Here's to $292.18 at 2:00 p.m.! Dreaming is good. Only the dead stop dreaming."
Let's just write off Sept. and Oct. and see what the year end brings. Never lose faith in a great investment.
Bought 35 more shares of MSFT yesterday. Up up and away!
Will go back to $300 after next earnings
NICE RECOVERY MSFT: world-class company and super investment for longs
"this is a buy and hold forever stock. I will DCA and never sell it before 2040, at least"
Max Pain for options is 287.50 for Friday and 290.00 for next Friday. Where does the stock close this Friday?Predictions
"where did that Martin dude go. He was short here,and he didn't post at all today!"
"Las Vegas Michael Strauss,has set a target 0f $325 per share for MSFT by Thanksgiving."
"Week or ten days ago, suggested all chill re: MSFT. Have not seen any indications anywhere that MSFT will not have a good QTR. or poor direction for the company. Continue to relax."
Do you guys think we will see anew ATH this year?
All the finicky profit takers are gone for the weekend. Let's move on.
$600 per share within the next 4-6 years !
"Behemoth, titan, juggernaut...I'll take it!"

"Nice discount, buying opportunity"
$315 by EOY. Guaranteed.
"Glowing comments from everyone, yet it continues to go down. When will we reverse the trend? I want msft to go up!"
"Cripes, my lucky break ! I got out of BA after hours last evening and put it all into MSFT. Of course, I am loaded with MRK and Ford and AGEN. But today I am most pleased to be in 1000 MSFT. Hope I don't jinx it by bragging.The old man."
I challenge anyone to prove there's a better investment right now than AAPL or MSFT !
"Prediction: Open at 1%, peak at 1.2%, then close at 0.48%"
(Consumer prices rise at 5.4% yearly pace in September and stay at 30-year high) The party of high taxes & high prices.
Microsoft is holding up really well compared to other tech stocks
"Old unused PC's running XP have become priceless as artists, writers, and scientists try to survive in the inflationary depression."
"I just bought more at $285. Long term hold for me, I am only 27 years old. Will add more this week if it sells off further. The company hasn’t changed overnight."
"I bought more AAPL, FB, and MSFT. Plus, I wrote some puts.Love bargain hunting."
Apple better
Microsoft and Apple can't really go down. so you can buy them any day.
Hold strong and don't budge. Been through a million of these temporary dives
"Looks good, as I said 300 near futureBears sorry, you lost this one"
What a great company! Management and products are the best! Go MSFT!!! 
"""$299 is still very cheap for a company like Microsoft.""LOL...................How's 293 two days later?"
what are we breaking $306?
52-wk high b4 earnings?
I am wondering if the stock dropped to 200 would it still be within valuation multiple found in the last decade.Earnings of 8.05 (ttm) would be a PE of 25. PE was lower than 25 from 2005 to 2019. Free Cash Flow per share of 9.70 (ttm) would be 21 times. FCF was lower than 21 from 2010 to 2016.Looks like the time to purchase this stock is closer to 200 than 300. The projected returns from this level looking out a few years is less than 5%.
Chinese spillover from Evergrand....this too shall pass.. MSFT withstands all shocks quite well.
PM looking very good300sh today!!
Higher interest rates drives up the cost of doing business. As a result Profits go down. Do the math. Msft was overvalued.
"$MSFT about to go parabolic. Yesterday was overkill, gonna make that loss back. It's TRENDING!"
Govt shutdown looming shaking markets
"Prediction: Open at 0.9%, peak at 2.2%, close at 1.4%"
Again the flurry of spam. Amazing levels of envy and nonsence.
Closed above the 50 day moving average.
"Lack of trading, discipline is the primary reason for trade losses, it is estimated that nearly 80-85% of intraday traders end up lossing money in the stock market experiencing loss is also part of the game but that doesn't mean you should blow your trading account."
"So are we finally done with the annoying dips, like the one from yesterday? Is it mostly green from here? Will we break the all-time high soon? I sure hope so."
This stock is a great long term hold... I wouldn't be against MSFT in the long run!!
Looks like another pump and dump today..Are you learning anything ?Do you not see buying the dip is no longer working ?
Is this a Joke?
$290 calls printing 
$320 by EOY.
MSFT is an unstoppable juggernaut that may occasionally be buffeted by external events but its rise is inevitable.
Beware pundits: they exaggerate in both directions.
is it finally gonna run? or just dangling the carrot again?
We got all the time in the world. Buying and holding is free. $MSFT $VENA
"Prepare for another red, red day. Sigh. At least that is what pre-market trade strongly suggests."
"Investors Business Daily talks about the ""great reshuffle"" where hybrid work is here to stay and you guessed it, MSFT and GOOG are in the forefront with their cloud offerings."
I downvote any comment where abusive language is used to put forward an argument. Please keep it civil. Don’t be aggressively argumentative. Focus on the fundamentals.

As Buffet says…he loves it when stocks selloff…he then gets to own more of a great business. Simple easy and logical
Don’t sell off !
"And MSFT losing again the most while Tesla is up again. MSFT with the biggest earnings and strongest market position in the market losing the most of all tech. Yes, makes sense. I looked everywhere and didn't found anything negative to MSFT. Latest news was MSFT is raising prices for their products which will even mean much more profits in the future. Don't know what happened to MSFT, but this used to be the stock which always performed better than the market, meaning market is down MSFT is less down or even in green, market is up MSFT was always more up. MSFT is now for 6 weeks in a free fall. Even trash stocks are outperforming MSFT right now."
I suppose it’s nothing that $Msft is shutting down LinkedIn China … lol

Just bought calls. Yields are not going to spike to the extent believed. Over 1T in repo facility and ECB will cap the yields.
This isn’t exactly the type of post based on statistics but I do believe one thing: MSFT is one hell of a company selling valuable products with five star upper level management. Go MSFT!!!
Dont sell yet below $310.
So u sold. Now what? One thing is for sure better make sure not to forget to set aside at least 30% of those profits for your state and Uncle Sam that will be due in 6 months or possibly even sooner. Then what? Yup go on an emotional roller coaster and buy back higher. Never fails. Have a great night lol.

We have had two routs like this before. The first one on feb march lasted one mont ( the bond interest thing)= -6.3% in msft price. Then in april-May another rout lasted 3 weeks and the outcome was the same. In both situations the stock ended stronger in the next months. So let's wait and see but in any case is the same situation seen before so no need to panic
"Since today didn’t bring any volatility, I wonder if all the analysts / media were lying or mistaken when they kept screaming that October is going to be a volatile month."
"MSFT now performing the last 6 weeks much worse than the market and even not once a bounce.This is normally only happening to trash stocks which are making no profit, but MSFT is quality wise the best stock out there with best finacial data and market position. Searched really everywhere if anything changed and found nothing. Don't know why this stock turned all of the sudden from the best stable stock out there to the worst performing stock. But also afraid to sell as this is always the point when the stock turn around and makes a huge climb. I saw this so many times you are fed up with a stock and just want to get rid of it just to watch the Stock explode the next day. Also September as the historically worst month for stock market is over and we are going now into historically best months for stock markets. Years end was always best time for stock market.All i can say is that a juggernaut like MSFT at 280 USD and under 50 MA is laughable cheap and should be right now at 350 USD and not 280 USD. But it is what it is and as i didn't found anything that fundamentally changed need to accept that this market has no logic at all and is being probably manipulated by certain people.If the market would follow the facts and numbers MSFT would be today at 350 and not 280 and Tesla would be at 280 and not 800."
so the whole us market just started trading lower and lower? or is it someone just shorted or sold a trillions of dollars?
All investors have a binary choice: true MSFT investors will hang on and realize future profits and others who don't have a firm belief in MFT will sell out of fear on a down note. The choice is yours.

"Institutional investors rebalancing, reacting to interest rates. MSFT is one of their largest holdings, very liquid so easy to get in and out of.

"Buy $280 march $23.70 or april $25.70 2022 call option. Keep check on it, see how much youn make, stocks price is $286.60"

Inflation fears? Can anyone explain how inflation can rise with a significant percent of people out of the workforce?
"As an investor, I’m quite concerned about inflation and proposed higher taxes. I’m also concerned about the level of (non) co-operation between the major political parties. Infrastructure spending at a time when supply chains are already severely constrained is going to make the inflation problem worse. Higher prices and low growth may still result in a rise in interest rates. This post isn’t specific to Microsoft, but the market as a whole."

"All that talk about volatility! So far, the market has been quite tame."
Microsoft is up 11.5% the last three months. Very strong summer for Microsoft shareholders. How does Microsoft stock usually do in the fall/winter months historically ?
Short sellers keep warming up the interest rate narrative; hoping weak hands to fold and to buy this stock at a discount. They'll just end up being squeezed out of their money! You don't play around with a solid company like MSFT.
10 year bond rate is up and MSFT and Tech is up?

I think MSFT will buy TomTom before another big tech or OEM will buy TomTom. In that case the share price of TOM2.AS will double to at least 15 EURO. Current price is 7 EURO. Most HD Map deals for ADAS and SDC will be signed in the next 1 or 2 years. What do you think, will MSFT buy TomTom in the next 12 months?"

Re-balancing the portfolio was prudently done, but even though I feel it is better balanced, had I stayed in the stocks I was invested in, I would have been up almost $100K from current positions. Lesson learned!"
Microsoft is sitting on a solid cash. With dividends and share price appreciation of MSFT is a wiser choice than treasury bills.
World: say hello to Windows 11 today!
Are you learning anything yet about bear  markets ?
Looking good! Microsoft finally broke $300 and hopefully will keep climbing.
Woohoo!! A real buying opportunity!! Going shopping today!!
Martin had to be sent to mute land
I own Apple and want to own Msft but I cannot get past the cloud computing competition that is out there and growing(Oracle/Google/IBM) these are no joke companies looking to muscle in on AWS and Azure. Plus the other smaller companies out there too. Explain away that competition and how Microsoft will fend it off please. Like I said I am an Apple Long and am very close to pulling the trigger on mister softee. Apple has already defeated all competition for its products and is far ahead is that how Msft Longs feel about Msft?
Let’s see $OEG close green!! And $AVPT the $MSFT partner got me hooked I’m long!
Market crashing overnight…. Going to be a rough Tuesday
Another flat down fri. Come back next week.
Huge pre market. Nasdaq making a strong rebound.
"Wife and I retired from MSFT. Bought 10k shares in 1991, sent three kids through college, paid off our house, and all our investment properties, I retired at 53, wife retired at 59, but she is 6 years older than me. If your not buying MSFT it is your biggest mistake. BUY, HOLD, NEVER SELL, we still have our original 10k shares MSFT, along with GOOGL, BRK.B, WMT, WM, and GLW. The only secret to any investment is the time you hold it - stop listening to all who don't agree, they will never have a dime!"
Veteran investors know to hang on..we have experienced many turns like this. September will pass.
i like the new surface pro 8 but prices are a bit high just for a laptop
"Based off of averages on how MSFT has moved in the last 5 years- it should touch about $700/share in 5 years. Sell at your own risk. It won’t be kangarooing for much longer. New products coming out. Better tech every year. The time is now to buy in or miss out. To the moon, Alice!"
"This tech selloff is/was based upon inconclusive evidence that higher interest rates are detrimental to tech companies. And, even with today's inflation we are still at historically low interest rates. Under $290.00, MSFT is a strong buy."
"Microsoft Remains a Top-Notch Dividend StockThe software giant has morphed into one of the world's biggest dividend payers.Daniel Sparks(Tmfdanielsparks)Sep 23, 2021 at 1:11PMAuthor BioKey PointsMicrosoft pays out billions of dollars of cash payments to investors every quarter.The software giant has increased its dividend every year for 12 years straight.Despite a low dividend yield, Microsoft is an attractive dividend investment because of its dividend growth prospects."
I was in this Monday at ~$290. Should I get out now ? I just don't see any reason why it can not break the $300 barrier ? Any comments ?
Started investing 3 years ago...first stock that came to my mind and that I bought: Microsoft!...a no brainer...served me well...still holding and buying the dips...not selling till it reaches insane valuation...
I bought so much NVDA and $msft today
"$MSFT $WIMI $TSLA What you try to adhere to, may not get the results you want"
"FYI, I would not recommend buying stock based on Yahoo's ""Bullish"" Pattern detected. I bought more MS shares on Monday when they said a Bullish pattern was expected. The exact opposite happened. So, I won't be making any investment decisions based on Yahoo ""Bullish Pattern"" detected."
End of quarter rebalancing MSFT and APPL good place to be in Oct going into Xmas .
MSFT is safety blanket stock..Investors' Business Daily
Best CEO in America. Best balance sheet in America.
"Unless you need money to save your life or pay your child's school fees, why would anyone sell this stock?"
MSFT beyond oversold. Adding!
Good entry point at this discounted price
"Pros are taking your money.. Can you feel it ?You are slowly losing large amounts of your gains by chasing the falling market...Here are some concrete reasons why the pros are hyping, pumping and dumping to the naive1. frothy2. Huge slowdowns in china3. end of stimulus in us4. end of extra unemployment5. reopening of the economy away from tech5. correction of big customers faang big msft customers6. fed removing stimulus and liquidity that inflated the markets7.rising interest rates on 10 year bond makes high flyers unattractive275 will be tested you will see... Smartest thing you could do is lock in 12 year old fed induced market gains.You won't but you will remember I told you this..."
Great investments like MSFT and GOOG will always deliver in the long run. Check out their historical price trajectories.
"I wonder how many of us own MSFT and AAPL! I hold them both! Nothing like leaving a party,just to go to another one next door!"
"I'm hoping for a 5% drop so that we no longer have to hear ""we haven't had a 5% correction in almost a year""."
msft should split 5:1.
It is looking like today could be a great day!
"Over the last week or so, there was a bit of weakness in the markets. The weakness was primarily triggered by the Evergrande fiasco in China and, to a lesser degree, the fact that we haven't really seen a significant pullback/correction in quite a long time. However, none of this was due to anything specific to MSFT. There was no negative news about earnings or anything like that. It just got swept up with just about every other stock on general market weakness. Nothing has changed for MSFT fundamentally. Therefore, IMO, long term investors really have nothing to worry about.Looking ahead, the Jerome Powell of the FED indicated that tapering of the bond purchases will be ending soon but it's expected that interest rates will remain extremely low. This means that it shouldn't impact MSFT much at all.MSFT longs have some tailwinds to look forward to. Windows 11 will be released very soon. Earning are coming up. Early next year, we will be seeing the Office 365 price increases come in to effect. Stay long and ignore the nonsense being spewed by the shorts."
"Robert: I'm sure you are watching this! It may not stay like this, but if you were going to sell at $300,you have a chance! I doubt that was your intention,but you said we wouldn't hit $300 today. I imagine you wouldn't mind if you were wrong!"
"MSFT has acquired Ally.io, and that's great!"
What’s it gonna take to hit $300 again? Maybe next earnings.
“Let’s go Brandon”
"I Just purchased 310 shares of msft after hours and added to BFLY... my butter fly stock which just took a ride into space. for years i wanted to buy msft. Finally , for what it's worth.The old man."
Inexorable climb to new heights
Man 60 Billion to buyback stock not bad. Also nice divvy raise I would prefer a special dividend though so I can go in and buy stock with it .
There is going to be a stampede to cover at the open. This should be fun to watch! All the longs need to do is sit back and watch the show!
"merger approved ticker will change to Bakkt,keep in mind the names on this stock $MSFT $GOOGL $GOOG and the NYSE majorly owned by $ICE"
"c'mon, now. Does ANYONE care to explain the market behavior towards MFST? I'm all ears....."
"November 2 and 3, FOMC Meeting. What if more members are in favor of a rate hike?"
