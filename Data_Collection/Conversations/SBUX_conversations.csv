In my opinion sell this stock before the earnings call at the top of the hour. The company missed badly in this quarter on sales and is raising wages substantially next year which will lead to disappointing earnings guide. Stock is expensive with soft fundies so consider getting out of this before the big hurt at the top of the hour.
Dividend should be in 3 per cent range for a company with undrinkable coffee.
head and shoulders pattern nice swing to 107 should be insight. if it follows past history it should jump to 107 drop back down and pick back up around dividends. This is screaming long term mark my words
Just add to your positions.
i love starbucks coffee but stock has been underperforming for me to think about investing in it
"great buying opportunity. As much as I would like to see it under $100, not sure it gets there."
Where’s B of A? 17 days ago they said buy with a 125 price target. Who’s holding the bag? Not B of A. Pure comedy
Buy the dip
Starbucks disappoints...
will recover in no time. I loaded @ 105
China is risky from APPL to WYNN to SBUX.
So what just happened?
So let me ask this question. Is Sbux a more profitable company pre or post COVID? Explain
"I think people are missing brand value comparing BROS with SBUX. But the thought of comparing BROS with SBUX should be a credit for BROS. No matter what it is not a good comparison, if someone wants to buy under growth potential time will have to tell....what I see on yahoo finance is 404 Million revenue and -591 million net income, no typo....."
Stock down big time: The old supply chain excuse...No plastic spoons at certain locations!
"I'll hold this position until I retire. I turn 30 next month. Starbucks Coffee will be around for several more decades, guaranteed."
Just bought 100 shares. Let’s go!!!
$SBUX Upgrades Deutsche Bank Buy USD 127 Initiated by Bank of America Buy
So people that held Starbucks in 2021 have zilch to show for. Nice.
A lot of Starbucks business in China was from tourism and I don't see many tourists going to China unil Covid is a distant memory.

with costs rising exponentially everywhere people have learned to make coffee at home or cheaper alternatives like Tim hortons...S-bucking into a tough bean...
100. i always buy my coffee at McDonald's for half the price !
Decent US growth but China hurt revenues is my main take away from this. I think guidance will be key
"WHICH STOCK DO YOU THINK WILL DOUBLE IN PRICE 1st.SBUX to $200Or BROS to $100SBUX W/120 BILLION Outstanding shares, and a current market cap of $130 BillionOr BROS w/ 46 Million Outstandibg shades, and a current market of $2 Billion? Both good stocks though "
"I've seen this movie MANY TIMES BEFORE .....They drown you in myopic headlines about 1 aspect of a business..China , lower estimates and then the companies results aren't as bad as expected and the stock BOLTS HIGHER! We are in an opening economy and Starbucks are ubiquitous! They've made money!"
"I never liked starbucks, but after the earnings release, I am tempted to buy."
Underreaction. See you at 85 where it should be. Fed can’t prop this market up forever. Weekend at bernies is over.
who's adding under $100?
buy the dip. just need an article about Pumpkin Latte sales and it will go up.
SBUX has already started to close stores early and give employees more balance. The only risk ahead is China. I think SBUX has a ways to go higher. The run is not over.
oversold / overreaction
sell .. overpriced.. raising prices.. wages too high

Cold Winter coming... drink more coffee!
I had to buy in today...finally got in at a price below $107. What could be a more ideal business than an overpriced coffee joint that millions of Americans are addicted to? It's become a ritual routine for millions to visit Starbucks EVERY DAY!
BROS will grow into a $200-$300 stock imo. The drive-Thru lanes are always insane there.
The last 2.5 months have been rocky for SBUX. I'm saying $117 by EOY. Will climb to $130 in 2022. Buy now.
Stop worrying about the price. Daytrade it don't go long. Long is boring.
"Drawing parallels between Starbuks performance in China:$SBUX 2020 Annual""In China comparable store sales declined by 19% for fiscal 2020, mostly due to the 31% and 37% reduction in comparable store sales during the second and third fiscal quarters of 2020, respectively."" $LKNCY2020 Annual While SBUX had 19% decline, Luckin in the same year made 33% increase in sales$SBUXQ2 2021 China comparable store sales increased 91%Now, make your own conclusion what kind of explosive increase for 2021 Luckin is going to come up with, if SBUX revenue in China in Q2 increasd 91% Holding dearly my 10K of LKNCYSelling no earlier than 2025This stock is going to follow patterns of those like: Starbux, Dunkin Donuts, Domino Pizza, ChippotileEnjoying my 3 bagger already made and looking forward to multiply 3-5x in the coming 4 years."
dumping after hours
I deliver UberEats on the weekends. 90% of my deliveries are Starbucks. Each time I go to pick up the bags the stores are packed.
Big joke. Stock has bullish rating with $130 price target.
coffee overcooked and their staff is as friendly as cancer for the most part
"Buffalo will likely unionize. That is a big Union town. Then, will spread across the Nation. The Company could be wrecked by strikes, walkouts, higher costs, employee lawsuits and more."

Thank you for the overreaction former holders. You saved me $$$$
Climbing back to $120. Holding 5 shares.
Great buying opportunity today. Temporary issue for a solid company.
Love the dividend increase. This company is amazing.
they should the name to MetaBUX
Tesla ev's driven by robots will pick up starbucks and deliver daily.
"Some companies with a larger market cap than Affirm's $38B: Coca Cola $KO, Starbucks $SBUX, TJMaxx $TJX, Docusign $DOCU, Ross Stores $ROST. Affirm is scaling their volume by about 2 X per year without purchasing inventory or real estate or fulfillment centers. Own Quality."
"Dutch Bros is coming after all of Starbucks’s US freestanding lobby stores. A Dutch Bros store does 3 times the traffic and has 40% lower labor costs. Everywhere Dutch Bros opens a new store, they take half of the Starbucks customers……and they don’t give them back. BROS is the stock you should own for the next 3 years."
Only up $8 YTD. This is a phenomenal opportunity to buy and load up with some cheap shares. This is easily a $150 stock. I will be shocked if this drops below $110.
The dividend for SBUX has just been raised 8.8% to .49 cents a share. Payable Nov 26.
Nothing great. It will sell off now due to high valuation. .
bought more!!!
Is it just me or does Bro's remind anyone else of Luckin Coffee?

There is no inflation...maybe even negative inflation.
"On our way back to $116 by EOY, could go higher. Love the dividend and the coffee."
Borrowing more money to pay bigger dividends. Not going to end well when rates rise.
Numerous stores are temporarily closed or have limited hours… staffing issues! Sbux has alluded to this issue couple of months ago.. but said it was limited to few areas.. stores.Seems to me it’s anything but limited. It’s wide spread and getting worse.I’m not surprised the morning jolt dissipated.If staffing issues are more severe than sbux let investors believe the stock could tank quickly below a $100Be careful!.
Seeing this as temporary pandemic related issues. Company too good to stay down for long. Customer loyalty solid. Global growth. Dividend. Long.
100 buy order open. hopefully filled next week
"SBUX STILL GOOD FOR YOUR PORTFOLIO, BUT BROS NEEDS TO BE AN ADDITION TO ANY PORTFOLIO AS WELL IMO.PLUS, IT WILL TAKE A LOT LONGER FOR SBUX STOCK PRICE/MARKET CAP TO DOUBLE THAN BROS "
Starbucks beat earnings and now they give us a nice dip to buy in...
Hilarious. WAYYYYY OVERSOLD. STARBUX IS THE KING COFFEE INDUSTRY!!!!! LOAD UP.
"I averaged down, and just picked up some more SBUX here today. I think this dip is a good buying opportunity. Good luck all."
I think investing in crypto now will be the best option now especially with the current rate of the market and how profitable the market is.
"Overreaction. 70% of revenue and 64% operating Income come from the Americas. Only 25% revenue and 22% Operating income come from International and most of that is from Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, and Africa, not China. It's estimated only 10% of sales and and 15% operating income of the overall international revenue and operating income are from China. Not even half of the 1300 new international stores opening this year are in China. Yes, Starbucks has Chinese exposure, but not as much as most think. Not enough to justify the current SP action, imo. This kind of overreaction makes me consider opening a position."
time for a bounce option's max pain expiration for Fri is 112so buy some 110 calls at the open and sell before fri close or when SBUX hit's 112 again.
"U.S. same-store sales increased by 22% in the quarter, rising by 11% on a two-year basis."
anyone else think we'll go up during this winter season .!
Finally SBUX is showing it's true worth under $110.00 a share . For weeks it has been over priced .
I haven’t seen a crowd in starbucks in ages. Starbucks is fading bad.

"I sure do see a lot of personal opinions and biases here regarding SBUX coffee. Bottom line, it doesn't matter what your personal preferences are, whether you like or dislike. The fact remains, SBUX is the most popular coffee chain in the world. It makes a ton of money, has the highest brand recognition, pricing control, adapted to overcome the pandemic, and is expanding globally. It will soon overtake McDonalds as the largest global restaurant chain. This stock will do very well long term regardless."
