Starbucks will announce that waiting areas will be added to all stores for people who don't buy anything.
All I know is every Starbucks drive thru is wrapped around the building.I have never seen one not busy
I was at the Starbucks in Ross Park Mall (Pittsburgh) today and it was packed. Great to see.
"So SBUX has a billion shares outstanding does anyone think $40million dollar buyback does much to offset any potential earnings drop. Good news 90% of stores in China open, but the real question is how much are they selling. Also in US what will impact be on closures on earnings. I am holding SBUX but worried about the earnings report and guidance."
$115 is not a bad price to add more shares of SBUX. Long term holders of this stock will be rewarded.
"Why I bought Puts heading into SBUX earnings? Inflation is not only isolated in the USA, it is a globally, and as a world traveler, most people are very price sensitive when it Starbucks. Furthermore, social media companies are telling investors that companies are spending more on ads, ask yourself why.I expect Starbuck to miss huge next week especially internationally."
Inflation.......Prices will rise temporarily and maybe not a bad thing.

"Ordered the pumpkin spice cold brew today, paired nicely with some dips"
TERRIBLE COFFEE. EVEN CONVENIENT STORE COFFEE IS BETTER!!!!
Starbucks Price Target Raised to $81.00/Share From $75.00 by Morgan Stanley yesterday. Well I guess that means were over valued here lol
"6-4-18 Downtown Denver Starbucks on 16th; two of six outside tables occupied by homeless, one with legs on table vaping. No paying customers in sight. CNBC Schultz love fest will continue and SBUX decline will be attributed to his departure vs political policies that are bad for business."
i will never never get rid of SBUX i love this stock ill keep buying every month
Starbucks just announced a new Coffee flavor: Homeless A..
A valuation of $150B is more reasonable for this company. We will see the share price $130 within a year. Their business is just too good.
VENTI’s FOR EVERYBODY
"the logic with Starbucks coffee is that1. people are not going to their shops anymore which should decrease sales2. if people are so addicted to specifically Starbucks coffee, they can buy the bulk package and make it at home...which will end up decreasing the net profit because it is cheaper3. if people are just addicted to coffee and they realize that we are in recession, then buying the cheapest bulk coffee and making it at home is even cheaperfolks you need to realize that this coronavirus situation is not going anywhere for another 9 months or so...with artificial intelligence, it takes 12-18 months to find a curedon't really see how this stock is still in the green."
always a line of cars outside my local Starbucks.
Starbucks will close for a dayHomeless will be conducting seminars on how they should be treated by paying customers
"the lines in sbux are insane, everyday, all day! how is this stock not at 100?"
"REVELATION 13:16–18 Verses in the Bible 16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: Revelation 13:16 Meaning 17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. this could NEVER happen in America, right ?"
"I like Starbucks, but honestly, how is this stock near all time high?"
There is not a single positive reaction from this group of people in chat LOL the first time it has been a 100% agreement between all parties. Good for the homeless and people getting free wifi.
"look at coffee futures, this is a good time to sell and buy back into the end of the year."
Will we ever get a bounce?
Is it possible to aim for reversal? Is it still expensive?
"Strong Earnings - Really ? The PE is 40. With a SBUX on just about every 3rd street corner, how can this be ? Where else but here will 76 cents in earnings (qtrly) get you a $100 stock that has an $80 price target."
I am in at $49 a share safe to say I will be holding my shares for life!

"Wife and I just pulled into the Santa Monica Sonic Drive In - Starbucks. Nice Ocean breeze. We are having a couple of loaded hot dogs. Then Sonic Classic Sonic shakes, Grande Pike's coffee and yellow pound cake with white icing."
is China a threat to hurt SBUX ?seems like China is purging capitalism when they can
In line 7 cars deep at SBUX in Dallas. This joint has not slowed!
"Haven’t posted in a couple years since I really don’t pay much attention to my SBUX holding, We bought 200 shares in the early 1990s, sold 100 after it split the first time. Gave 50 shares each to two of the grandkids five years or so ago and now sit and reinvest the dividends that exceed our original investment each quarter. I think I will consider being “long” in SBUX"
"Covid is not gone. This Fall/Winter, SBUX's indoors to remain closed."
"SBUX is kinda a scam stock management is using debt to buy back shares so they can make more moneyDespite only earning a total of $9.03bn net income over the 3 years to September 30 2020, the company has paid out $5.4bn in dividends and spent $19bn buying back company stock in that time. It’s similar to taking a shot of adrenaline. While it might feel amazing now, there will be a comedown, it’s just a matter of when.Likewise, in the short term, there’s little concern of consequences, but longer-term there can be issues. It ultimately means that rather than the business growing organically and driving share price appreciation naturally (which it still is to a degree), a large portion of the returns have been driven by a shrinkage of shares outstanding (20% reduction in 3 years), which itself has been funded by borrowing money. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-nasdaq-sbux-100-return-173028458.html"
"Can I please get a serious answer to this question.... I am not a long time Starbucks stock owner. I had a really bad day today as I’m sure a lot of you did. I have 10 $105 calls expiring this Friday and 10 next Friday. What do I do with the ones expiring Friday? For anyone who has owned Starbucks for a while, how will this react tomorrow to the good investor day news? Will it open at the high and then trade off ? I just never have followed this stock and I don’t know how it normally reacts to good news. Any help would be greatly appreciated"
Apple crushed it. Google beat earnings so did Starbucks $APPL $GOOGL $SBUX
Selling all before earnings. Not worth the risk and covid still a factor
120 by Friday ? Or I smoke to much lmao
Ackman is pushing the stock price in both directions for personal gains.
"LK coffee sales very good are good news for sbux, because China tradition was drinking tea,LK low prices coffee can get more customers from drinking tea people,these peoples will indirectly to sbux, because sbux coffee better than LK coffee,please see these:Motorola Nokia and others build cellphone market for aapl and Samsung, Yahoo and others build search engine for Google, these companies have been death, why death???because iPhone better than them,Google better than them too,so LK low price coffee will get more customers for sbux, because sbux coffee better than LK coffee, low price coffee can boost China coffee market strong growth, so sbux doesn't need discount it's coffee price to get more customers, and save a lot of money,because LK low price coffee can more customers for sbux,so LK sales very good was good news to buy sbux, sbux target price $150, because China coffee market strong growth now.LK will bury himself after China coffee market have peaked as Motorola Nokia Yahoo and others."
Who is buying under $120 ?
"I feel SBUX is a great buy here at this level. Every time I pass by my local Starbucks the drive through line there is very, very long. This is great for business. Future looks very bright."
"Right now I'm sitting in the balcony/bar of Starbucks Reserve in NYC enjoying a ""Roastery Old Fashioned"". My wife is partaking of a n Espresso Martini Flight. There was a line to get in (brief wait but worth it). While in line I tried to imagine any Starbucks that I'd ever been to that that wasn't busy.... I couldn't. When that thought was over I purchased a $1000 more of Starbucks shares."
Forward m PE of 34 not that bad for a growth stock like SBUX
This is a company I can own & truly say I sleep like a baby at night. This stock is a safer investment than bonds
"To: Kevin Johnson and Pat GrismerI am a coffee hound.. however, I will never drink another cup, buy your ground coffee or step foot in a Starbucks again. I saw a film clip of Howard Schulz on a report by Lou Dobbs tonight. I am of the belief that China is a communist country who persecutes those who fight for democracy. They suppress free speech and imprison those who speak out. I do not believe in their politics. As an American I have a choice and I did not like Schutz’s support of China. Therefore, I will not buy any of your products and I will sell my stock. I know this isn’t going to hurt your earnings or your stock price but it does make feel good and sleep at night. Thank you for reading"
$110 by February
"Wanted a mocha frap, Starbucks ""closed to to an abundance of caution"". Went to MCD, price is less, same taste. Why am I gonna support SBUX demo-fascism fear mongering? Answer, I'm not."
Great short right here. Massive by needs a pullback to consolidate
"My wife and I have Starbucks everyday, 7x week. We spend $21-26 each time. Love the products!"
"Looks like it holding strong at 112-113, it should slowly climb back to $116-118 some time this week. With the US target to reopen July, and coffee is a must thing, earning is not the best but still showing very strong, I am holding it and bought some more today."
"The shorts are trying desperately to get the price lower. Almost hilarious to read, the things you people say. The intelligent people understand what you are doing. Here is reality:1. Starbucks is a very profitable company, always will be. 2. The stock is now very undervalued.3. People are not going to stop drinking coffee.4. This is a golden opportunity to buy low, sell high at the end of the year.I bought 3,000 shares and plan to pocket at least $17,000 by Christmas. 5. Dividends increased.6. Debt is relatively low. Look at other companies!7. The closing of 150 stores is a GOOD thing, not a BAD thing. Why? They are under performing, and there are better places to open up shops. That Seattle mall where there are four Starbucks shops is pretty ridiculous. 8. Stock buybacks will happen now at a much faster pace, and the number of shares will increase, more than normal...per press release. Beautiful! Will increase the price obviously.9. For the truly investment savvy people out there who understand selling covered calls on your shares, that strategy also add to your profits. So you get dividends, price appreciation, and covered call profits!! A triple ""bagger"" so to speak. Good luck Longs...the shorts will cover within a couple days or so. We can relax and enjoy the rise back. In summary - as Warren Buffet says = Buy low, sell high."
I bought in during the beginning of the scamdemic it's been a slow winner for sure
7 consecutive down days. When will the streak end?
There's a post on the Rumor/Murmurs/Buzz page about $SBUX and $CVSI being in talks to run +CBD in all locations upon FB competition. Has anyone seen any corroborating sources?
You people have noticed how people like to sit in their cars in parking lots using their Smartphones and eating. This is a big trend. We must buy Sonic Drive Ins of America. Both menus higher prices and premium locations.
"As I can see, a lot os people talking about P/E 200, but have somebody seen forward P/E 32? This is the target."
"SBUX's Numbers were INSANE! Strange to say it but, this is a TRILLION dollar company! Easily one of the top 10 companies in the WORLD!"
I finally bought Starbucks after a year of waiting.. Good entry point for me.. Will buy more if it drops 20% below my entry point.

"Caving in post earnings here too, everything's caving in post earnings. Baaahaha told ya so.Thanks."
I had this stock for 5 years and t did not do anything; despite high prices and traffic the comps are 1 percent; management is very political; this is a good company to work for but not for investors; save your money and invest somewhere else; five years from now it will still be in the 50s;
"Joe Terranova sold SBUX a few months ago, bought Dunkin and sold it recently to buy SBUX again because they are recovering quicker on the international front. Always do your own DD, these ""analysts"" are not the experts."
Great dividend growth and stock appreciation. Reinvesting my dividend has proven to be a wise move.
"All I know is every time I go to any of our multiple SBUX locations the drive thru is lined up around the block. Went today myself and waited 40 minutes in kind to get thru the drive thru. Not because they were slow, just because the line was that long. And big a single person left the line. As long as that’s going on I will continue to buy on every dip."
I bought puts a few days ago after my wife said she's not going back to our local starbucks because they have run out of so many flavors and products. Is this a national thing?
"College student here, and can say that Starbucks all around campus are lined up outside the door every time I walk by. Along with a large variety of their products located in vending machines, it is by far the most popular coffee product. I sold today since I was up 45% and believe the stock had a little run in the previous 2-3 months. Valuation is getting a little high and the PEG ratio of above 2 is expensive also. Great stock to own when reinvesting the dividend and believe it still has room to grow. Good luck to all, hope I can jump back in after a little pull back. Originally bought due to Chinese exposure, but with growing competition from other cheaper delivered coffees, Starbucks may have to rethink the business model. Shanghai store is still doing extremely well and fundamentals remain the same. M-Man"
"There are 3 cash cows in this world. Booze, cigs and Starbucks coffee..."
Rumors of 4 for 1 stock split and increased dividend. This is possibly why the stock is up! Buy now!
coffee beans are way up. Starbucks says they have enough in inventory for a years worth. that incurs storage and freezing costs. or less valuable coffee due to old beans. does anyone know how they are storing these? to keep coffee beans up to snuff from aging its not easy.
All time high
"Bought in 2007, Up 499%.. not as good as AMZN but a safe reliable long term hold."
Will this have a run like chipotle or dominos after earnings?
"wow, how do i get started?"
China market projected to be weak going forward. A great buying opportunity.
Going UP! Nice price action! Buy on the dips and hold forever!

I love this brand and love the run up this past month. But earnings will most definitely be soft. What to do?
"Really don't know to much about company financials just enough to get me in trouble. I had a little extra cash to play so I bought this stock (2,343 shares) back in July last year when it hit rock bottom because of all the negative news coverage , thinking it would most likely bounce back at least 10 to 15 percent and I would take my gains and run. I had a little scare in December and almost sold but I'm still hanging strong, never imagine it would almost double in a year. Now all I worry about these days is paying the dam taxes on this monster. I hope many people are enjoying the same situation....and remember haters gonna hate, glad I didn't listen."

Starbucks Q1 earnings down 47% from Q1 last year. Stock price is unchanged. Paints a nice picture as to how the current market doesn't care about fundamentals.
Bought in at 50.75 and sold most of the shares today for 71.00 for a nice profit. I see it dipping down again to $55 range and I will buy again and hold for long term. Good luck to all!!
Closing 100's of stores yet the stock price go's up? what am I missing??
"after school, in Brooklyn college New York, I saw a lot of students drinking SBUX coffee, l didn't see any people drinking sodas, if you are KO holders, buy SBUX to replace your KO, SBUX drinks are very health coffee, it's worth to drink, it's stock is worth to buy, $75 per share is observe."
CFO saw the writing on the wall...
Momentum has finally swung up. Jumped over the 50 day ma today. Nice run this week going into the holidays. I expect $SBUX stores to be packed with shoppers.
those are not good earnings for a company with forward PE >30. Revenue and operating earnings below 2017 level.
"This company will reach $200 a share in the next 3 years. They will stomp all their competition. Opening in China currently. Expanding in grocery stores, malls, self stores with drive thru.

Don't feel like buying anything until Feds taper. They will have to. I rather wait for that to know things get truly better from there. Not falling for a quick turn around before chop.
some got bamboozled in premarket buying this
Earnings beat by good percentage and sales up even in China which was a concern. The stock had been pummeled mostly by shorts betting for a downturn. Time for a SHORT SQUEEZE!

"Let's see what's good about Starbucks1) The company's plan to buy back shares and dividends to the tune of $25 billion in the next 3 years.2) Starbucks app is increasingly popular, enabling customers to order and pay before they arrive, all the while collecting and redeeming rewards.3) Its major push in China.Yep, I see Starbucks at $140 this time next year!"
"This should come as no surprise to anyone that looked back at previous ER. It’ll dip near future but will continue its path upwards. I’m short, but will buy calls next week. Make money both ways. But for now, bearish"
"My reasoning for a $54 Stock Price currently for $LKNCY :$SBUX has 32,660 outlets, LKNCY has 4,792 outlets - 14% of SBUX’s size. SBUX Market Cap: $132B, LKNCY Market Cap: $2.2B - 1.7% of SBUX’s MC. So if / when financials show that LKNCY’s Market Cap is actually 14% of SBUX’s MC (approx $18B), the stock price will leap. However, if I just use 10% of SBUX’s MC ($13B) - that gives me a Stock Price of ($13B / $2.2B = 6) $9/share today X 6 = $54** of course this is a rough factoring. My purpose is to highlight the absurdly undervalued proposition of this stock. Not looking to pump this stock, just sharing my investment outlook."
"Starbucks is selling it’s brand. Over price coffee , yes . They use premium packaging. They make you feel appreciated and special. The atmosphere when you get in their stores is different that any other coffee shop. Even asking for water is given to you in a nice cup with ice , lit and a straw. This stock is class premium service. When buying a stock look more than numbers and charts."

"HERE IS WHY THEY ARE SELLING KOREA STORES: Starbucks' banks are very reluctant to lend anymore in China with fear that China will take over the stores or impose a huge tax on foreign operations. Starbucks is a very risky bet because they have a very negative book value (meaning it is worth less than nothing). They have $36 Billion of liabilities and have only $28 billion in assets. Would you lend to a company like this, now going into 3rd and 4th tier cities in China where tea drinkers have never even heard of coffee? Meanwhile the climate scientists are coming after them for destroying the greatest forests on Earth in the heart of the Amazon. This is a lenders nightmare. Starbucks may also announce they are cutting future dividend payment which burns $2.124 Billion on common shares alone. This company is in huge debt problem and was forced to sell Korean stores which will reduce future guidance."
Why is it taking so Long this time for SBUX to announce the dividend increase? This is the longest it’s been

"I am really pleased with JVA's progression. I am glad JVA continued bringing in positive net income. It is what mainly matters for a company like JVA, the revenue is a fixable problem. I am also glad JVA is further cutting costs by purchasing the land for JVA's manufacturing facility and consolidating manufacturing operations. The land will also strengthen the company's balance sheet by adding an asset that will grow in value over time. JVA is being run very smartly by the current generation of the family that has always ran it, the company is being ran with care like any other family-operated business (remember $JNJ is a family run company.)JVA is one of the most reliable stocks in the stock market right now, and I will be putting big profits in it for an easy triple, possibly much more if its CBD coffee beverages take off. Imagine $SBUX or any one of the large coffee chains choosing to offer its CBD coffee in its franchises, JVA will go over $100 over night!"

"I believe we have farther to fall here before I'm backing up the truck to the loading dock. So much of Starbuck's revenue is based on 2 factors ... The place to get coffee on the way to or at work, and a social gathering place. With COVID-19, more people are working from home which will impact Starbucks revenue and, people are avoiding social gathering until the virus is under control. If it drops to the 60's I'll start loading up because fundamentally it is solid. It is just going to be a short term roller coaster."
Tired of stocks having great earnings and going down. #$%$????
I have been holding since $40 a share.......which was only 3 years ago I am at the point now where I can never sell this gold. International growth will take it to new highs!
Can someone seriously explain how this stock stays up every day on such light volume?
I am not sure this Company should be borrowing money to pay dividends. This may not end well.
Why is this stock so expensive? It has a PE ratio of almost 200... I'm just wondering how much more room Starbucks has to grow? Maybe into more countries as they become more developed as well as the younger generations love of Starbucks coffee. A 200 PE ratio means that it will take 200 years for Starbucks to generate a profit that equates to their market cap. Can Starbucks profit increase enough yoy to justify a 200 PE?
"Starbucks is a no brainer to invest in. Buy any dips under 120..think long term. Tesla, APPL, sbux Have one thing in common.. Loyal cult like following.. Cant go wrong."
Pink sheets luckin coffee shares trading at +50% since feb 2021 where all other chinese adr are oversold and lost >50% ytd on average. Tells you smth about the negative pull of etf's and indexes.
There are reports of SBUX closing stores in certain regions in China due to Corona Virus concerns. How much profit does SBUX get from China? How would the virus issues impact guidance?
just read an article where at least 4 stores are requesting Starbucks Unionize.... if Starbucks Unionize it will be the end of Starbucks and their stock price.... keep an eye out for this... this is not good
"We just pulled into the experimental Sonic Drive In - Starbucks in Santa Monica. Full house with more Hollywood Stars finding out about this location. Pee-Wee Herman is here in a yellow Rolls Royce. Around 1am+, you get the music industry Celebs. That's your late late night crowd here."
Pls. call into Cramer's show and ask about SBUX buying Sonic from Inspire Brands.
"Even if they hit their full year estimate of $3.20 a share (only time will tell), the stock is trading at a forward PE of 39.4 . That is insane!. Their historic PE has been around 26, which would put the stock at $83 a share! (and a PE of 26 for a company like this is very richly priced.)"
"SBUX is trading like a tech stock during the tech bubble. I bought a KRUP coffee maker and it's working out well for me. However, I do hit coffee shops whilst traveling to various countries; such as, Costa Rica, Taiwan, UK, Spain, Denmark, Norway, Sweden.... just to see what the locals are drinking."
Congrats if you were buying in March when Ackman bought.
Bought in 2007.. was down 75% for 3 yrs. Now up over 600%. Just buy it you have long horizon and don’t look at it.
Starbucks drive-throughs should hold up better than most restaurants...we will until it hits 50 bucks to buy though.
Institutional investors love this stock. They will continue to add more in 2020 because EPS growth is inevitable
"08-14-2020 @DAVE ... ""That is unbelievably amazing... The EXACT same thing has happened in the past as well. Why doesn't the S.E.C. investigate something like that?"" ...Many possible reasons:1. SEC is in a slumber, but should someone with ""heft"" or stature bring this to SEC or FinCEN, they might listen.2. SEC is a well-known ""revolving door"" of people who used to or would like to in the near future work in a private sector, for a lot more money and bennies, having SEC / gov't service experience and relationships on their resumes. Many at the top and middle layers of SEC currently don't know where they will be in 6 months, so investigating WS financial shenanigans may not be exactly their priorities at this time.3. Many in the investment industry (some may now be at SEC and later be back ""on the Street"") have probably dined in one or more Danny Meyer's fine-dining Union Square Hospitality Group (USHG) 20+ NYC restaurants, and would like to do so again when some or all of them reopen; also Meyer is sitting on several boards of companies with potential IPO and some that will certainly need WS help with raising money through loans and/or other financial services that WS lives on (just like recent recap via dilution of $SHAK) and he is also involved in some feel-good non-profits and restaurant / farming community organizations. Maybe that's why they have been so brazen about it, they may feel at best ignored and at worst untouchable.That's why Meyer's USHG and Shake Shack share the similar marketing theme (easy to search): ""Union Square Hospitality Group's BELOVED restaurants, cafes, and bars..."" / ""Union Square Hospitality Group has created some of New York's most BELOVED restaurants, cafes, bars..."" / ""USHG is the hospitality company founded by Danny Meyer, and owner of some of New York City's most BELOVED restaurants."" / ""We love to reimagine BELOVED, classic dishes..."" / ""The (fill in the city) Shack serves up all the BELOVED Shake Shack classics..."" etc. etc. - it's in their 10Ks, 10Qs annual reports and all marketing literature. ""Iconic"" and ""cult"" are other monikers they use - that's how you sell inferior products at higher prices to tourists and brand-curious, and that's why they need high-traffic places like malls and terminals, stadiums to attract casual traffic and sustain high AUV - but their retainment rate is low, 75% of first-time visitors never come back, so expenses are high, gross and the net margins are low and the business model at these high valuations is not sustainable over long term.5. Now, an article about ridiculous valuations and of these WS + SHAK insiders stock shenanigans in highly regarded financial publication(s) or a statement by a well-known short-seller would go a long way to get attention of SEC / FinCEN, but in this environment of The Fed and Fed gov't flooding the market with trillions of dollars to bail out ""the market"" and ""leave no zombie company behind"" it's not a sure thing that it will turn into something concrete. After 2007-2008 GFC market crash and unraveling of Madoff's decades-long Ponzi scheme operation a lot of mini-Madoffs were uncovered and busted... I guess we are still some ways from Zombie Companies Apocalypse, staved off by Trillions of dollars, some flowing to companies that should be saved while most going to WS Mafia Laundromats ""washing"" money through entities like $SHAK and some other zombies, with insiders sharing in the booty.I and a few others on this board (and some articles in Forbes, SeekingAlpha, etc.) have been documenting for more than a year this financial engineering fraud and the ""love story"" between WS Mafia and SHAK insiders and there are enough forensic accounting evidence to bring this to logical conclusion - the question is, would anyone blow the whistle loud enough for SEC or FinCEN to wake up and do their jobs? Shake Shack CFO (""Chief Financial Engineering Officer"") Tara Comonte was promoted to President in the beginning of this year - ever wondered why? CFO + President is unusual and rare; CEO + Pres, Pres + COO, CEO + COO are much more common. Randy Garutti is completely incompetent as CEO flailing in different directions, trying one failed scheme after another (GrubHub exclusivity, trying to emulate Chipotlane with pretty ""Jetsons""-like sketches, ""digital ecosystem"" etc.), he is just a marketing cheerleader spouting usual slogans ""brand,"" ""opportunity for growth"" and ""I don't care about margins, I just want to sell more burgers - that brings in cash"" on ERs, ""investor conferences"" and CNBC.Well, we'll find out next week if only 1,666 left open from last $55 LIMIT order have been filled... or maybe they used the opportunity today to also ""park"" another 25K shares for Danny Meyer, on no-news low-vol day with $SHAK ""somehow"" being up nearly 3% during the day while $CMG, $MCD, $WEN, $QSR, $SBUX etc. were all down or just barely in the green at the same time?"
"Split the stock.Very happy,bought at 21$ years ago.Goes well with my Tesla stock.Starbuck coffee while driving the cyber truck."
all time high + coffee price climbing+ drought in South America= time to short this thing
Every Starbucks is jam packed 11 months out of the year. Buy buy buy
116 is 50 day moving average. Great place to buy. 114 is 100 DMA if you think it makes it down there.
"From 1992 to 2020, SBUX averaged a yearly 10% increase in revenue, a 20% increase in earnings, and a corresponding 20% in stock price. Those are the yearly averages over that time. I was and am an investor in SBUX that entire time, and have logged the data. Along the way their ttm P/E averaged 30+/-2; a premium in their sector but reflected their 20% yearly gains in EPS stock price, and recently their dividend increases. They maintained a yearly average forward P/E of 24+/-2. It's going to take 3 quarters to get back to normal operations, and then 4 more quarters of .75+ EPS to get their historic benchmarks back on track. Today's ttm P/E is in the 60's; twice where it normally would be if things were normal. I feel SBUX will trade in the $55 to $95 range over the next 2 years, with the low occurring within the next 3 months."
Buy buy buy
"Terrific company, buy any dips in $SBUX !"
"Good Morning, Time to get some Starbucks."
"Nowadays so much to do in your car at Sonic Drive In - Starbucks. Place bets on your Smartphone with BetMGM. Watch the game in your car while enjoying a premium Classic Sonic Shake, greasy fries and a Grande Pike's coffee."
"Now their trailing P/E is within their historic range, which is fine. From here we can expect 15-20% y-o-y earnings and stock price increases."
This is why Apple stores don’t have chairs or sofas. :-)
Big news coming on SBUX!!!!WATCH CNBC
"Net income has been declining over the last few years. Far too many shares out standing at just over 1.1 billion to create exponential share holder value here. Chipotle is $1,800 per share because there is only 28 million shares outstanding. Starbucks should be trading over $700 but won’t do to dilution"
My local Starbucks store now charges $2.70 for a 12 oz cup of black coffee. I haven’t seen anyone object to the price.
This will open green in the morning..
"I've been a SBUX share holder for many years but never really tracked it closely. I was surprised at the consensus for earnings for Sept quarter were so low. In the shops I frequent, one thing seemed to be true: Covid or no covid, people want their coffee. So why the low estimates? What is the biggest factor that I should understand? Are margins lower? Sourcing costs? It can't be sales alone."
If you don't want coffee meet at the park
Cramer said SBUX is a buy!
"Shultz leaving is great news for this company. Always brought worldwide attention to any negative or mistake the firm made instead of simply addressing it internally as most worldwide companies would do. They still have a large following, innovation in electronic pay and growth in Asia. Hoping new mgt now has a clear path to make Starbucks great again! Might even dip in and buy more shares. Interested in others thoughts?"
While the coffee is Lousy the green tea is perfection.
"just saw SBUX has doubled their debt to $25b from $11b in last 3-4 years and stock is now higher than before COVID? hmmm, I may buy puts here."
Shouldn't Sargeant Schultz be out pounding the table on the Delta variant??? He might be waiting for the Omega variant....
Core holding. We’re still adding.Projected 5-10 year cash flows could amount to around 175-200 a share.
"can see volume coming , buy buy buy"
https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/12/starbucks-could-break-out-to-new-highs-says-trader-heres-how-to-play-it.html
sbux popped up my my 52 high list. just trolling the news to see how many banks upgrade the stock AFTER massive gains have been seen. always funny to watch.
"I have been a bum inside SBUX for decades. Later in the day, I am a bum in my car. If we buy Sonic Drive Ins, I can be a bum in my car while enjoying both menus."

At close to 52 week highs they better knock earning report out of park. Look at tesla awesome earnings report down 6 percent today.
Wife and I just pulled in to the Sonic-Starbucks Drive-In in Santa Monica. That Ocean breeze is cool. We ordered 2 Sonic Classic Chocolate shakes and 2 caffeine free Pikes coffees. Comfy in our 2021 Lincoln Navigator. There's our Brentwood neighbors. Bye.
"Starbucks Coffee Japan says it's reopening many of its stores in Japan on Tuesday, including ones in Tokyo.https://seekingalpha.com/news/3575771-starbucks-opens-up-again-in-japan?utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha&mail_subject=sbux-starbucks-opens-up-again-in-japan&utm_campaign=rta-stock-news&utm_content=link-2"
"Some problems in Buffalo., The main store keeps running out of food. It's not because it's too crowded. Yesterday, they were out of all lunch sandwitches and most breakfast sandwitches at 11 AM. On a SATURDAY."
"SBUX and DIS are no brainers for reopening plays. Revenues and free cash flow are both massively compressed due to COVID, just imagine the rise in the share price when all that business comes back. Some of the reopening may already be discounted but not all of it. SBUX's FCF at its peak was 9 billion in 2018. I believe it can get back to those levels over time. Long term this is a solid play and anyone who disagrees will get smoked. I made a mistake selling my shares several years ago when it reported six straight flat quarters...I should've known better but I got back in after realizing my mistake and have no plans to sell. SBUX isn't competition free but it has strong brand loyalty amongst its customers and its beverages are widely respected around the world. As a customer myself I am proud to be a shareholder."
The extent of my research on this stock was to go to local starbucks in am.
Starbucks' CEO made it about race.
Bought my first 3 SBUX shares this morning. Good company.
"Long SBUX! This a big time winner long term. Buy, hold and and forget about it."
"Very undervalued stock at this price, Chia stores reopened. EPS is strong. This chain is everywhere what’s not to like about this business model. Think Value!"
Now people will associate Starbucks with public restroom rather than great coffee
Starbucks is BIG TIME 
Jesse Jackson is now suffering from Covid. In honor to the famed civil rights leader order your coffee drinks Black.
"Can’t see how luckin is being compared to starbucks. Starbucks has over 30 drinks, food and pastries."
Trying to think of one example in which getting political helped the shareholders......anyone?
Broke 50 like I predicted; next stop 48
"Wife and I just pulled into the experimental Sonic Drive In/Starbucks in Santa Monic for a snack. We are having Grande Pike's coffee, 2 slices of the yellow pound cake with white icing and ex-large Classic Sonic Chocolate milkshakes with the premium ice cream now offered. Brought to use by a SBUX girl on roller skates."
"The shorts claim overvaluation and that this will crash...the company has an earnings growth rate of 50 percent people...it's not like the company has no growth to support the PE..and anyone with a brain knows that economic reopening will only drive the stock price higher once all their stores experience the normal volume of traffic and all of them reopen, restoring things like revenue and free cash flow and EBITDA to normal levels. This is not a stock for shorts...you thought its recovery over the pandemic was painful enough, you'll learn what real pain is in the coming months."
"Starbucks stock is up on ""news of massive protests and boycotts"""
"You can’t keep upping wages, benefits like tuition, healthcare for employees who’s only required skill is asking if you want a danish with that..."
"superior products, brand loyalty to another level, for sure a long hold"
"Bitcoin is the future!Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks. Steve can be reached onT E LEG RAM ( stevewarrenfx"
looking at the market cap of both starbucks $SBUX 100B and luckin coffee $LKNCY 3B there’s a lot of room for the latter!
Their earnings haven't double so why has the stock price ran up so much over the past year since June 2018?
Can some longs weigh in on how the 200 shutdown stores in Canada will affect this stock long-term? That's a huge chunk of revenue gone.
Time for a 2 for 1 split.
"why are people complaining about the price of the coffee in store?let's be real here, the majority don't own shares in the company who shop there, let them buy the coffee and you take their money.after all you bought the shares for the money....right?it's investing, not get rich quick!"
Great move by Starbucks to pay employees.. Yes share price will be hit short term.. But millions of people around the world will remember the companies that showed loyalty to their employees in hard economic times and our brand will just bigger.
Big week next week.
I wish Starbucks would focus more on their coffee than their social causes.
locations in major Chinese cities not as busy as they used to be. trip last week visited and went by many locations for due diligence. Luckin new stores open literally right next door to 2/3 SBUX locations. their to go bags from digital orders were more than actual customers hanging out at SBUX. Lucking coffee tasted only ok but 30% cheaper. not sure how growth can accelerate in their key market
Request for Information: Can someone please travel to China and verify by site visit the total # of SBUX stores? If Chinese & Luckin fudged the numbers - perhaps the SBUX team needs and audit?
"Somebody educate me, I'm not seeing the ""recovery trade"" on a stock that is trading 30% above it's pre-pandemic price. Wouldn't it have to be below that for a recovery trade? Yet analysts are pumping this hard. What is going on?"
Breaking newsStarbucks will be renting porta potties and putting them at the closed store locationsThey will have a free built in Keurig and Charmin extra soft T P
P/E of 135. seems reasonable.
