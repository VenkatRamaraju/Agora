My local Starbucks store now charges $2.70 for a 12 oz cup of black coffee. I haven’t seen anyone object to the price.
About to start climbing back to $120s
"Haven’t posted in a couple years since I really don’t pay much attention to my SBUX holding, We bought 200 shares in the early 1990s, sold 100 after it split the first time. Gave 50 shares each to two of the grandkids five years or so ago and now sit and reinvest the dividends that exceed our original investment each quarter. I think I will consider being “long” in SBUX"

$115 is not a bad price to add more shares of SBUX. Long term holders of this stock will be rewarded.
"Even if they hit their full year estimate of $3.20 a share (only time will tell), the stock is trading at a forward PE of 39.4 . That is insane!. Their historic PE has been around 26, which would put the stock at $83 a share! (and a PE of 26 for a company like this is very richly priced.)"
116 is 50 day moving average. Great place to buy. 114 is 100 DMA if you think it makes it down there.
"Ordered the pumpkin spice cold brew today, paired nicely with some dips"
I’m enjoying my morning SBUX at home which I got at Costco at the low price of 2.5# @$11.99.
Is it possible to aim for reversal? Is it still expensive?
"I feel SBUX is a great buy here at this level. Every time I pass by my local Starbucks the drive through line there is very, very long. This is great for business. Future looks very bright."
Just announced. Next experimental Sonic Drive In/Starbucks location to be on Ocean Drive in South Beach. 1950's Sonic Drive In design to fit perfectly with controlled Art Deco architecture there. Milkshakes $12. Small Pikes $5.50. That crowd will pay.
holding I know the coffee giant will prevail this week with nice dividends the 11th
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Fairstox.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
The best decision I ever made in my life was investing on financial markets .bitcion has really made alot of people millionaire and billionaire it doesn't matter how you invest. Only the fact that you are willing to invest for your future save does. In have high level of confidence trading with Mrs Evelyn strategy cos of steady growth I am making on every trade i never thought i will go this far in a short while.

I'll like to also say this here it is the best advise we should work smart look out for multiple steams of income and get more involved with online trading .for me trading bitcion with mrs Evelyn is the best...Her availability is sure on WhatsApp +1 9295668490
"Bitcoin is the future!Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making proflts should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 9btc in just 9 weeks. Steve can be reached onT E LEG RAM ( stevewarrenfx"
Don't feel like buying anything until Feds taper. They will have to. I rather wait for that to know things get truly better from there. Not falling for a quick turn around before chop.
Bought my first 3 SBUX shares this morning. Good company.
Pink sheets luckin coffee shares trading at +50% since feb 2021 where all other chinese adr are oversold and lost >50% ytd on average. Tells you smth about the negative pull of etf's and indexes.
5 shares now. Lets grow with SBUX.
"Why I bought Puts heading into SBUX earnings? Inflation is not only isolated in the USA, it is a globally, and as a world traveler, most people are very price sensitive when it Starbucks. Furthermore, social media companies are telling investors that companies are spending more on ads, ask yourself why.I expect Starbuck to miss huge next week especially internationally."
Down at open…up by closing…no stopping the Bux
"HERE IS WHY THEY ARE SELLING KOREA STORES: Starbucks' banks are very reluctant to lend anymore in China with fear that China will take over the stores or impose a huge tax on foreign operations. Starbucks is a very risky bet because they have a very negative book value (meaning it is worth less than nothing). They have $36 Billion of liabilities and have only $28 billion in assets. Would you lend to a company like this, now going into 3rd and 4th tier cities in China where tea drinkers have never even heard of coffee? Meanwhile the climate scientists are coming after them for destroying the greatest forests on Earth in the heart of the Amazon. This is a lenders nightmare. Starbucks may also announce they are cutting future dividend payment which burns $2.124 Billion on common shares alone. This company is in huge debt problem and was forced to sell Korean stores which will reduce future guidance."
I have been holding since $40 a share.......which was only 3 years ago I am at the point now where I can never sell this gold. International growth will take it to new highs!
7 consecutive down days. When will the streak end?
Every Starbucks is jam packed 11 months out of the year. Buy buy buy
Jesse Jackson is now suffering from Covid. In honor to the famed civil rights leader order your coffee drinks Black.
"Terrific company, buy any dips in $SBUX !"
120 by Friday ? Or I smoke to much lmao
The most addictive legal drug is coffee .... can't lose printing money
"Net income has been declining over the last few years. Far too many shares out standing at just over 1.1 billion to create exponential share holder value here. Chipotle is $1,800 per share because there is only 28 million shares outstanding. Starbucks should be trading over $700 but won’t do to dilution"
"Starbucks is a no brainer to invest in. Buy any dips under 120..think long term. Tesla, APPL, sbux Have one thing in common.. Loyal cult like following.. Cant go wrong."
always a line of cars outside my local Starbucks.
Cramer said SBUX is a buy!
Last split 2015 any thoughts this year or there after thanks New Highs?
At close to 52 week highs they better knock earning report out of park. Look at tesla awesome earnings report down 6 percent today.
This will open green in the morning..
Core holding. We’re still adding.Projected 5-10 year cash flows could amount to around 175-200 a share.
"can see volume coming , buy buy buy"
Apple crushed it. Google beat earnings so did Starbucks $APPL $GOOGL $SBUX
