Seeing this as temporary pandemic related issues. Company too good to stay down for long. Customer loyalty solid. Global growth. Dividend. Long.
"Dutch Bros is coming after all of Starbucks’s US freestanding lobby stores. A Dutch Bros store does 3 times the traffic and has 40% lower labor costs. Everywhere Dutch Bros opens a new store, they take half of the Starbucks customers……and they don’t give them back. BROS is the stock you should own for the next 3 years."
oversold / overreaction
I deliver UberEats on the weekends. 90% of my deliveries are Starbucks. Each time I go to pick up the bags the stores are packed.
Just add to your positions.
with costs rising exponentially everywhere people have learned to make coffee at home or cheaper alternatives like Tim hortons...S-bucking into a tough bean...
"I averaged down, and just picked up some more SBUX here today. I think this dip is a good buying opportunity. Good luck all."
Decent US growth but China hurt revenues is my main take away from this. I think guidance will be key
"great buying opportunity. As much as I would like to see it under $100, not sure it gets there."
"U.S. same-store sales increased by 22% in the quarter, rising by 11% on a two-year basis."
Great buying opportunity today. Temporary issue for a solid company.
Tesla ev's driven by robots will pick up starbucks and deliver daily.
There is no inflation...maybe even negative inflation.
I like the way they are going to increase the wages for employees. I may take a position here then!
"I never liked starbucks, but after the earnings release, I am tempted to buy."
I had to buy in today...finally got in at a price below $107. What could be a more ideal business than an overpriced coffee joint that millions of Americans are addicted to? It's become a ritual routine for millions to visit Starbucks EVERY DAY!
who's adding under $100?
In my opinion sell this stock before the earnings call at the top of the hour. The company missed badly in this quarter on sales and is raising wages substantially next year which will lead to disappointing earnings guide. Stock is expensive with soft fundies so consider getting out of this before the big hurt at the top of the hour.
Every starbucks location in the US I have been to is packed. It’s China that is weighing on earnings
is sbux a buy?
