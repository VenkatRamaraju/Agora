"In addition to being a ""market-leading crypto asset exchange"" already, argues Todaro, with more than 68 million users spread across more than 100 countries, controlling $223 billion in assets, Coinbase has ""significant future opportunities"" to grow its business beyond mere exchange services, including by offering services in ""staking, custody, yield bearing products, and more."""
Holding from $250. Maybe sell at $350-400
"I expect this week we will be thrown a curve ball that drives the price up, I have been researching and looking at other stock, Labsgroup, BITMART, $Phil, $NSAV, $AABB and it seems like the best play might be some sort of joint venture with no merger. I know it may seem like a long shot but if $PHIL bought $NSAV exchange or something of that sort things could be interesting, then we have Virtuabroker,.I can't quite call it but I see some sort of twist in the future. I still see $NSAV as the MAIN PLAYER. BULLS ARE RUNNING ALL MONTH. All th we players are ACQUISITORS and they are all doing the same thing ... $NSAV $PHIL $AABB $VB LABSGROUPBITMART $COIN . Curious what the future holds. $NSAV .10 END OF WEEK."
"Coinbase is expanding in Europe and got the first crypto custody license from the country’s financial regulator BaFIN and is cooperating there with Solarisbank.Talked to a German coworker via Zoom today, googled it and it's correct. Nice!"
Buy and hold. Trust in Q2 earning beating high EPS/revenues. This Corp is profitable from any angle you look at. Manipulation will fail due to facts on EPS/revenues...hegdies game will end to some of them with Chapter 11. COIN will breakout IPO high above 419. Tic toc. Buy with both hand and margin if possible . Don't leave any crumbs to shorties. Buy accumulate. The more you accumulate the more explosive the SHORT SQUEEZE will become
Let’s close at 270 today! Buy and hold! This is seriously undervalued!
Why is Coinbase down today while all crypto is moving higher?
Coinbases user base will grow exponentially year after year.. In 5 years this stock will be over 1k a share.. no brainer....
What is a realistic price for this stock in 5 to 7 years?
"Coinbase made 770M net income in Q1 when Bitcoin was around $60K, it made 1.6B in Q2 when Bitcoin, along with the other cryptos, was down at around $40k. No matter where Bitcoin will go from now till the end of the year Coinbase is making more and more profits given there's more and more people and institutions creating transactions on its platform. With some projections we could say that its trading to a forward PE of 10 or less. Having a business which is growing at a double or triple digit level. If this has the same excitement and PE that Tesla has it would trade at $9,000."

Rocket time
How long before COIN gets into stock trading ? Paypal is doing it.
Upgraded with $420 price target!!!! Company is printing money machine!! Crypto here to stay
I think I got a crypto problem. I find myself buying every other day. I guess there are worse habits
Happy dance bitcoin above 50k
Btc over 50K and this only 265?
""" To the MOON ALICE "" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Any day this should separate itself from bitcoin once the funds are done loading
Can someone tell me what's the stuff with all the lawyers on this stock? Something to worry about?
