$250-260 consolidation just a matter of time then takes off
"Coinbase has officially launched in Japan  The firm has also partnered with MUFG, one of the biggest banks in Japan. (+40M customers). This will bring more customers and more revenue next quarter"
Today is the day that COINbase validates itself as a money making machine. $350+ by next Q
"If you believe the fundamentals and have a long term time horizon, you probably won't find a better opportunity in the next couple decades to own a market leader in a nascent and rapidly growing sector at dirt cheap prices. This is a high volatility but high conviction stock that one should buy and hold for at least 5-10 years, probably much longer, imho."
I am loading up on COIN. Keep the price down for a while please!
"I should warn everyone on here who owns Coin shares !!!!!! I am a Jinx !!!! That's correct , Bad Luck !!! Whatever stocks I get into starts taking a dive ! Just bought 100 shares today of Coinbase !!!! We will see what happens from today !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope my luck changes !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Coinbase Global, insiders didn’t buy any shares after the IPO. This is a crucial point, and a few implications can be discussed just on that non-event alone. Note, that these are skeptical possibilities, not an inference or claim on the motives of insiders.Let’s go over some possible reasons for this:Insiders find the current price of Coinbase to be overvaluedThe (partial) goal of the IPO was to cash out, not to improve the businessInsiders do not see a meaningful future improvementInsiders see the company as involved in a high-risk businessInsiders already have plenty of shares at their disposalThe stock dipped around US$230 per share, and no insiders have been registered purchasing their company stock."
I'm a little bit disappointed with today so far....
Coinbase Partners With MUFG to Start Japan Crypto Exchange wow
earnings will be huge
I have a modest position here. but I am also a crypto holder.
Looks like a nice run on $PBTS is inbound Monday. Watching $BITF $COIN and $CTRM
Thank you keeping the price low guys. I was able to buy another 3. Going to take a while before I get to 50 so keep the price low please.
587 institutional holdings as of 6/30/21
$300 this week
How is this not moving up????
So many here wanting longs to sell. Overly aggressive
$320 by end of Friday
"This is a Sleeping Giant. When it really wakes up, it will end in 500s"
"Intel has bought it for a reason, so its likely long term"
So Coinbase keeps their reserves in CASH and US Treasuries but not Crypto.
My target on this is $350 now.
Iran to legalize Cripto exchange... just out....
"Coinbase made 770M net income in Q1 when Bitcoin was around $60K, it made 1.6B in Q2 when Bitcoin, along with the other cryptos, was down at around $40k. No matter where Bitcoin will go from now till the end of the year Coinbase is making more and more profits given there's more and more people and institutions creating transactions on its platform. With some projections we could say that its trading to a forward PE of 10 or less. Having a business which is growing at a double or triple digit level. If this has the same excitement and PE that Tesla has it would trade at $9,000."
FYI - STAY THE COURSE:Aug-24-21 Initiated Needham Buy $420Aug-13-21 Initiated BofA Securities Neutral $273Aug-09-21 Resume DA Davidson Buy $400Aug-05-21 Initiated Redburn Buy Jul-07-21 Reiterated Oppenheimer Outperform $434 → $444
Not trading with Crypto. Breaking away from that pattern maybe?
"I’ll be very surprised this doesn’t go over 300, today or tomorrow. Earnings will be mash higher then expected. No way to guess how much higher we go after announcement of earnings, tomorrow."
price target raised to $420 from $400 at Rosenblatt
533 institutions invested...last week 420...wow!!!!                  
coin makes good money
Looks like another run to $283 next week..
https://fintel.io/so/us/coinThis a list of the institutional owners of Coinbase Global stock
Bitcoin to 50000 today or by Monday this will be over $300 the mother of all short squeeze as just began
"Next stop for Coin will be $ 300.00 !!!!! Once, profit takers are finished skimming off the top today !!!!!!!!!!"
"FYI there is one person who will be happy, but I sold out of Coin. I tend to hold long term but was never able to sell a call at a price a wanted so I sold out at $258. I am a trader on this stock so sue me :). I got out of all my growth stock with a potential major pull back as interest rates increase. If the speculative part of the market starts to decline, it should hit the crypto market as well. If in 4-6 months it is at a price worth re-entering I will get back in."
"If Blackrock, Fidelity, and Vanguard are in, so am I!"
"It's not the climb, it's the destination, COIN to $400, sure as the sun rise."
"An increasing number of users of the highly popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase have found their accounts on the platform empty after hackers managed to gain access to them and drain their cryptocurrency wallets.According to a new report from CNBC, the news outlet interviewed Coinbase customers across the US to discover thousands of customer complaints. For instance, one couple logged onto the service to discover that $168k in cryptocurrency had vanished after hackers were able to take over their account.To add insult to injury, the couple was unable to reach Coinbase for support after the incident occurred. While banks now employ live chat as well as email and telephones to provide customers support, the popular cryptocurrency company only responds to customers via email."
Anyone else believe this will be above $300 in the several days? BTC going over 50K this weekend.
It is too revolutionary. Nobody understands it.
After tomorrow no more under $300. Last chance on the $200s
After a solid performance and stock price over 290 it was a fast descent to 255. Does anyone have a reasonable explanation for this....
$300 by Friday
Why is vechain going up anyone know?
"Coinbase reported its second-quarter earnings with adjusted earnings per share of $3.45, significantly surpassing the $2.33 consensus estimate set by analysts. Revenue of $2.23 billion also beat the $1.78 billion consensus estimate from analysts for the quarter."
from reliable sources Bitcoin will rise in 1 Year 200% keep in your mind. You will triple your money in BTC and in Coinbase. Walletinvestor they have prediction about COIN Base the price to rise to @ 1.450 USD.
"An exchange buying a Crypto is not a speculation. It's a buffer that can be used to facilitate trading ( in case of issues in the Network ) and it's required to create derivatives and Crypto funds. ( see SQ, CME etc. )Thus. This a winning strategy as long as COIN keeps the business going, the investment pays for itself. The important issue is the customer base. Retaining and growing customers and AUM. This is tied into fees and service. All customers want a lower fee and a faster and more secure settlement. This is true for NYSE, RH, Ebay, Amzn and it's also true for Crypto exchanges. This is where COIN is a special case atm."
Buy and hold. Trust in Q2 earning beating high EPS/revenues. This Corp is profitable from any angle you look at. Manipulation will fail due to facts on EPS/revenues...hegdies game will end to some of them with Chapter 11. COIN will breakout IPO high above 419. Tic toc. Buy with both hand and margin if possible . Don't leave any crumbs to shorties. Buy accumulate. The more you accumulate the more explosive the SHORT SQUEEZE will become
cramer SAYS 300 PLUS....................
Holding from $250. Maybe sell at $350-400
Opened account which took about 5 mins. Invested 1K in ETH Let’s see how this goes.

"“Furthermore, Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest holds a combined 6.04 million Coinbase shares, valued at $1.54 billion.Of 17 brokerages covering the stock, 11 rate the shares as a Buy or Strong Buy, with another four giving the stock a Hold rating. At a recent trading price of around $276.20, the upside potential based on a median price target of $298 is nearly 8%. At the high price target of $650, upside potential rises to 135%.”"
"Best to have a full position already ...if you need to add shares, do it early in the premarket. Calling for 270 before the regular session. gl."
"Unbelievable that a company with $4.3 billion cash on hand and little debt is being treated this way by the markets. Not only has $COIN built a moat, they've built a fortress."
Who else ready to see $EEGI $BITF $COIN fly at open ?? $UBER
Why is this stock so cheap?
"The news is Intel Corp took a $750, 000 position in COIN."

"There's a battle going on in the AH and pre-market sessions. Awesome ER with a 3rd Qtr caveat. 1.4 mil shrs traded AH yesterday finally settling up $2 and change. As of 530am this AM 20k shrs traded and up $5 bucks. It looks to me like this thing wants to run over $300... but there are counter-parties trying to put a lid on it. Based on my 40yrs trading exp, I think she runs up to $300 by Fri... but that's still just a guess."
coinbase vs voyager https://youtu.be/_1yMxGdAGVA

Based on 15 Wall Street analysts offering 12 month price targets for Coinbase Global in the last 3 months. The average price target is $369.25 with a high forecast of $500.00 and a low forecast of $275.00. The average price target represents a 32.63% change from the last price of $278.40.

"Needham's John Todaro states, ""We see COIN as a market-leading crypto asset exchange with significant future opportunities beyond exchange services, which include staking, custody, yield bearing products, and more. Our $420 price target is based on an EV/revenue multiple of 12.9x our 2022 estimate and implies 64%+ upside from current prices."""

"I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of COIN shorts suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced."
Awesome earnings
This could be the final countdown to the moon 
This stock is being heavily manipulated until major upside. Citadel hedge fund involved in Gamestop had 1.3 bil in options after earnings.
225.00-235.00 buying more.
"Hedgies game is ending , expect SHORT SQUEEZE tomorrow before earning cuz hedgies are toast. You won't see COIN under 400 eventually. If hedgies don't cover asap, some will file for chapter 11 after earning like gamestop shorties. So buy COIN at any given pullback, cuz hedgies game won't last, They have to keep cover. Another bull roaring are: Zillow (Z), CAT, INTC, TDOC, I'll see at 400 level on Wednesday on COIN"
I think high possibility of $600 by year end. Third quarter even better numbers.
$275 close today $295 by Friday
Someone is selling heavy at $260
"Anyone think we can suppass 275 this week? Looking good, imho."
Buckeye up little ones we going to the moon!
$267 tomorrow would be grand!
"Btc at 48,500 And we are lower than 260?What happening???"
Messi gets part of his new contract paid in Cripto currency  !

How is this being held at this level still???
Any day this should separate itself from bitcoin once the funds are done loading
$350 today? After hours?
Coin could see $420.00 in less than 6 months.
"As you can see in this chart, from Wolfram Alpha web analytics of Coinbase's website, users are dwindling in Q3. That's why the company warned. BTW, I used this website to accurately calculate MoviePass subscribers not once, but twice, and predicted Twitter's good earnings, ROKU, etc. Web analytics give you a true figure of how many users are actually on any company's website. https://photos.app.goo.gl/edQ5ZyGgdii9dPZZ8"
Perfect timing limit order $250 it soared above then fell right into place. Now I own 30 shares

Load up time ..institution and whales are loading big time..

Why is Coinbase going up today ?????? Was there bad news about it ?????????????
"BTC printing $45k, can we see $275-280 tomorrow ?"
The one year target price on yahoo says 370s. This will be a great investment buying in around the current levels. I’m sure we will see the highs again in the future. What a great opportunity to add coin to my portfolio today.
"Just made my first Coinbase account, love it."
Are you okay bears? Bears are you OK?!

"Most underrated, underestimated and misunderstood stock"
Coin goin through a turn around.. $400-$500 by EOY
Will buy more today. Crypto also is rising more and more.
You have to wonder with all the positive news us come out in the crypto community why the stock shows weakness. Given the fact that this is the essential clearinghouse for crypto trades.
"For Coinbase, volatility in the prices of major cryptocurrencies did manifest in a diversification of trading volumes away from bitcoin. About 24% of second-quarter trading volume was related to bitcoin, down from 39% in the first quarter. If you want investment ideas from real knowledgeable traders, check them out at the https://stockhaul.today/fdth5y platform"
COIN is just waiting for impatience investor to leave. Profit wont come as easily.
Why is this dog still down below $300. BTC has almost doubled in a few months and this still languishes
"Wednesday, April 14, 2021 was the IPO day!!! From 429.54 and tanking every day! Now under 250...."
"Coin will easily beat earnings. Lots of Volume now in cryptos with the sell off. Hold on for the ride. Got to love it, just what we needed and then back up."
Happy dance bitcoin above 50k
Where is the vechain (vet-usd) listing you want me to keep buying elsewhere? Just amazing
I find it a bit funny that it is so correlated with Bitcoin price... when it should be correlated with crypto volumes actually.
I feel a base forming for the next move towards $300
"This has to be classified as the pick of the century for those seeing the massive influx of new investors into crypto, What an opportunity."
Who is excited for the earnings!!!!
This will be up 20+ tomorrow. Buy in the pre-market before it explodes higher.
needham raises target
$300 next week...
Headed North EOD
Some say all crypto is worth $0. If that's true no exchange is needed so COIN is worth $0 too
280 is possible today
Earnings are end of day tomorrow so should have another Green Day tomorrow.
$300 first then will go $400 in no time
Bought Jan 2023 $300 call last Thursday.
"Not a bad app. Just bought 400 bucks worth of crypto to start out with. Will add 200-300 every week. I'm getting excited about my coin shares and my entry crypto investment. Fees isn't terribly high. 2.49% is what ATM machines charge, but I'm receiving investment coins in return. It really curved my appetite for lottery tickets (from which I've spent 10s of thousands every year on. To anybody that knows someone with a cardboard crack disorder(basically scratch off tickets), help them out with the gift of coinbase"
Bought 500 shares at 414What do i do now?
Check Wallet investor stock prediction of Coinbase for 1 Year @ 1.450 USD
All this positive sentiment around COIN the last few months with HUGE quarterly earnings as the icing on the cake and yet COIN is barely able to eek out a stock price gain above its original reference price of $250 over 4 months ago!
Coinbase bought Zabo today !
"I'm so convinced now , that COIN BASE is a winner . after those Blowout earnings reports it had Tuesday !!!!! I'm so happy I bought in at $ 230.00 with my biggest cash amount of $ 25,000.00 !!! I'm playing this one for KEEPS"
Next week 310-320.....$$$$$$$$ my sell target $$$$$ mille $$$$$
While bashers are out to get you to sell behind the scenes funds loading up big. Don’t get shaken out
"Assuming COIN beats earnings estimates, does anyone feel we can hit the $400s any time soon?"
This should bounce off of the 50 day moving average. 235.3576 (50-day) 250.6833 (200-day
They had some interesting insights about COIN on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
You want exposure to digital assets? This is a good place to allocate some capital.
"What people should learn , about the Stock market today , is that Great Earnings reports , P/E Ratios , and Great financials in general are MEANINGLESS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's all controlled and manipulated !!!!!!!"
$300 in after hours today
"Institutions , Mutual funds and Etf's can't pile into it fast enough !!!!!!!!!! Wait till earnings come out on this one soon !!!!!!!"
I believe COIN is in a complex ab-cd up pattern if it can close over 267 one of these days the target is 320 pretty quickly. Not moving as fast as we would like but it is moving ..
What is a realistic price for this stock in 5 to 7 years?

There were reports that customers' accounts at Coin have been hacked and the money is gone. Also poor customer service is not helping either. Are these things true?

Jim Cramer just announced on CNBC that Coinbase is the way to play crypto. 420 target upgrade today!
"Watching news segment right now, how bad Coinbase is, and the customers being locked out of accounts, and hacked and Coinbase won’t respond to customers, or the BBB, CNBC, they ignoring everyone. One couple last lost life savings $150,000 and Coinbase had her locked out for a month after she provided correct login. They eliminated live chat as well. Wow ain’t no hell will I sign up for Coinbase, and Coinbase responded they won’t return the couples MK ey, because it was a 3rd party that hacked Coinbase account."

"I expect this week we will be thrown a curve ball that drives the price up, I have been researching and looking at other stock, Labsgroup, BITMART, $Phil, $NSAV, $AABB and it seems like the best play might be some sort of joint venture with no merger. I know it may seem like a long shot but if $PHIL bought $NSAV exchange or something of that sort things could be interesting, then we have Virtuabroker,.I can't quite call it but I see some sort of twist in the future. I still see $NSAV as the MAIN PLAYER. BULLS ARE RUNNING ALL MONTH. All th we players are ACQUISITORS and they are all doing the same thing ... $NSAV $PHIL $AABB $VB LABSGROUPBITMART $COIN . Curious what the future holds. $NSAV .10 END OF WEEK."
"If Coin goes up just another 8% , like it did today , we will be over $ 300.00 a share !!!!! It looks very Possible on Tuesday !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I know this stock really moves with the BTC market, and I get it. Higher the coin price and more fees to accumulate, but people have not been paying attention to the insane volumes of ETH and some other coins over the last 2 months. Also I love how they slowly move the estimates up over the last 7-60 days, however even with this I believe they still blow out estimates and guide higher. If anything deserves a 40-50 PE in this market it is COIN with the insane growth. 10-11 EPS for 2021 is not really out of the question. In addition the 4.50 EPS for net year at some point will need to be guided a lot higher."
"Nice quarter for COIN! Keep in mind, the $1.6 B in net income (this is how they get to the $6.42 earnings per share, $1.6B/248 M shares) includes $747 M in recognized tax benefit. If you subtract the tax benefit you get roughly $850 M in income which is more like $3.40 in earnings. The press release mentions Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 B, the majority of the difference (between $1.1B and $850 M) coming from $190 M in stock based compensation. All of this to say, I'm long, and although I like $6.42 in earnings, this is much closer to the $3.50 range than the $6.50 one."
"And Chris. specifically you. $coin is not regulated!! $tsnp aka humble was not regulated! That allows a huge grey area.We are the first end to end crypto platform 100% regulated. Which means, this next month when $coin is getting the lights turned off from lawsuits, we will be,$NSAV REGULATORS. But sorry Chris, you can't just be any geek off the street. lol"
"Coinbase is expanding in Europe and got the first crypto custody license from the country’s financial regulator BaFIN and is cooperating there with Solarisbank.Talked to a German coworker via Zoom today, googled it and it's correct. Nice!"
We must hold $262.
"Just sit tight folks !!!!! Today, Coin established a new low of $256.00 from the old low of $225.00 , just a few weeks ago !!!!! This is progress , if you are holding Coin long term !!!!!!! Just look at any other shares of stocks in the past two decades or so !!! They all started off this way !!!!!!! This stock just started in April 2021 ! Chill out !!!!!!"
Coin should fly from now and after earnings. We should see best months ahead in this cycle…
I bought on the dip
AWESOME RESULT!!!!Revenue: $2.23 billion vs. $1.85 billion expected Adjusted EBITDA: $1.15 billion vs. $961.5 million expected
Another 8% and I can finally break even
Get Out Now. Take Your Losses Before This Goes To $100.00!
Let’s goo COIN $260!! 
"I bought this 2 days after the IPO for average cost of 300$, won’t be satisfied until we hit $600 !! Let’s go"
This will head to $800 a share in 12 months. Park your money and forget it and add along the way below $300. Easy profits and massive gains
Coinbase will be a Trillion dollar company by the end of the decade.
This is the only stock in the green today from my portfolio. 
not going to lie. Very strong pre-opening #'s yet a big FAIL today.
I am long on this and am wondering what happen to the massive jump after earnings we were supposed to get?
Break $300 then off she goes
Btc over 50K and this only 265?
how can I invest in this
Nothing but green skies above us.
Coin to 400 shortly
What a beautiful day to own $ADA $ETH and Coinbase $COIN crypto is taking off
Does anyone believe anything they read here? I don’t!
Afternoon run?!
What is a good entry
Buying more tomorrow !
Coinbases user base will grow exponentially year after year.. In 5 years this stock will be over 1k a share.. no brainer....
pick up a little GILT... about to run...
"US dollars are basically in a long term decline, which is not going to end soon. Bitcoin is in a long term rise, which is not going to end, so you either invest on bitcoin now or risk losing more with banking only on fiat."
COIN should go up next Monday or what will gonna happen? Anyone thoughts?
"The earnings show what the bulls have been saying: it doesn’t matter if bitcoin or crypto goes up or down, they make money either way."
"All you guys should check out Galaxy Digital. Listed on the OTC: BRPHF and TSX:GLXY. They hold $2B in cryptocurrencies $600M in crypto ventures, with a market cap of under $6B. Very underpriced i think. Easy 10X by end of year, much more upside than $COIN."
"This will not make sense trading with bitcoin , if you sell they charge you , if you buy they charge you"
"Today $280, tomorrow $305 "
Wait until they report around 2.3 billion in rev tomorrow when street expecting 1.74 bil.
Why is Coinbase down today while all crypto is moving higher?
Road to $500!

Can it reach 290 again today?
Completely not understanding why the new stablecoin change affects COIN? only thing I can gather is that now COIN will need to have more reserves in cash??? why the F does that matter...they print money. Thanks for advice
I have 2k shares 20% net worth in this stock and sleep like a baby. Chill!
COIN just follows crypto. Why not just buy GBTC and ETHE?
not even sure why i trade stocks anymore
holding 
once again folks we have made it back home where it's nice and comfy $243. not sure why coin loves to be at $243 so often but it's sooooo true it's not even funny anymore.
$ 300 END OF DAY !!!
It figures that on a Green Day across the board this would be down.
"All the new OTC members. Japan and HONG KONG have signed a letter of intent with $NSAV for their new exchang that has not been named yet and will more than likely use $NSAV for all their digital transactions.$NSAV is strong.consudering Australia. China will never allow $coinbase or $binance with no regulations.Germany is jumping in the crypto space. The truth is the world needs a new way to make transactions. Bitcoin/Crypto make transactions INSTANT with no delay or waiting period. SILVERBEAR CAPITAL may as well be $NSAV. They issue the SBC Token Unit X (STUX TOKENS) soon that will be the engine to drive this baby. And to top it off, we jump s in the market with the crypto app at the perfect time. Cryypto is way down about to make a major upper swing. Meanwhile $coin is about to get sued out of business. It is all about timing. And today, as a long here I have to sh, deep down I didn't expect this much, now with this progression. LOYALTY BEFORE ROYALTY. CHANCES MAKE CHAMPIONS."
"COIN is sitting on $4.4 billion in cash$$$. Plenty of ammo to make acquisitions, or fund dividends and buybacks. Their only notable debt is $1.3 billion in convertible bonds. COIN is a cash flow machine."

"I've been here almost a year. If you have $ to invest this WILL hit 18.98 calculating $COIN to $NSAV ratio, our market cap is so low. However, with the SBC Token Unit X, the sky is the limit. Possible to hit 100$+. Some sites have it as high as $600 in a year with $250 as a low. ... I think that's dreaming too big. $20 will definitely happen.THIS IS NOT TSNP!!! ACT 1 ACT 2 AND ACT 3 THIS IS $NSAV FAMILY!!!REGULATED!"
Coin is making money for every transaction. Doesn’t matter whether the market is up or down on cryptocurrency it is still making money 24/7.
"okay, I'm in! holding at least 10yrs"
We could see $300 before earning & $400 by Friday
So manipulated
Sold at 293. Buy order of 281. Almost there. Come to papa!
""" To the MOON ALICE "" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Up 3 and a half points. Could open Monday @ 300.
Anyone want to guess what COIN will be worth 5 years from now?
"Coinbase did 458 billion in volume, analysts projecting 374."
Whole world will allow crypto
Guys this is basic stuff. Dont get your pants in a wad over the drop today. As expected. This is a $400 stock. Got in to this one at $230 and I am not worried about it one bit. Turn off computer and come back in 6 months or a year.
"everything what Cathie is touching, is being ignored/dumped/shorted by hedgies"
"I think we are going to have a real battle after earnings. someone keep picking up Calls all up and down the ladder and whoever is selling the Calls will be a interesting battle post earnings. This earning season has been off with articles slamming a stock or praising coming out almost immediately when they report so it's all set up to rocket or fail seconds after announcement. In addition I noticed on the Yahoo Finance article from this morning they expect $2.48 per share, but everything all week was $2.24 per share. Not only that 60 days ago it was 1.49 per share. I could be wrong but I see a nice quarter (2.24) along with raise in guidance. It could be the last time you are buying this below 300 if they guide around 10 EPS for the year which would give them at 27 PE, but with growth at 40-50%. Add on multiple new listing of coins and there is a real possibility it hits 400 by the end of the year"
"The street is projecting a massive decline in volume in Q3. July was not good, but August has been great. They have been adding new Crypto's like crazy which has non BTH/ETH over 60% of total vol (record high). They haven't even listed several hundred coins yet. Everyone relax!"
Funds gobbling up the float
"Hmm. Coin's Bug Bounty Program has already paid out $534,081 to hackers who have found glitches. Cryptocurrency is a scam. Google search “Bitcoin. Elliptic curves” and you will see the problem. The elliptic curve bitcoin uses is y squared = x cubed + 7. This curve has a finite number of rational points, and this scarcity gives Bitcoin is “value”. However, an infinite number of elliptic curves are possible to use for encryption. For example y squared = x cubed - 924 could be used. And a secret solution is (37,223). Free money."
Bitcoin doubled in past month so WTAF is going on with COIN?
"$COIN CEO: ""We recently received board approval to purchase over $500M of crypto on our balance sheet to add to our existing holdings. And we'll be investing 10% of all profit going forward in crypto. I expect this percentage to keep growing over time as the cryptoeconomy matures."""
Keep in mind we started in Japan and Germany early August.... Go Coin !!
Someone desperately keeping this down
don't let HOOD...win
@ Mikael? What will happen on Monday? With the stock price will rise more what is your opinion please?
Earnings were 300% higher then expected;that will continue. This is a growth stock with extreme potential already. Temporary dips don’t mean squat.
Awesome!!! I am long I got in @225
"Since a few of you asked how I could be up total portfolio today of over 1% while taking a beating in ZM (and buying more ZM this morning!!) - my 4 losers today were #ZM #AAPL #COIN and #ME - my winners were #SDC #LL #HOTH #CNK #BABA #F #PRVB #VAL #GE #DAL #DD #MRNA and #DEN Ironically, I like, most of the time, to keep the PEG around 1… last week I was almost all in and needed to free up some cash, so I sold all the stocks outside of near 1 PEG or below… EXCEPT ZOOM! Oh well, I’m still a believer at these levels!!"
"HAHAHA Cathie Woods finally dumped some $COIN and $HOOD, but tomorrow, she'll be dumping more I bet."
How are so many high profile people investing in COIN and it goes down? This should be at $350 right now. This is being heavily manipulated for sure.
"Dow futures are green. Will coin be green, or dark green opening tomorrow??!"
"Markets are red due to Fed's tapering, this shouldn't have anything to do with COIN reporting great news and possessing huge upside potential. Manipulation at is finest or is it institutional accumulation? Can't believe It's another red day."
Next week we trade above $300 have a great weekend my long friends
What do u guys think of Coinbase integrating Apple Pay and Google pay!

I just watched segment on CNBC. Big nothing burger. They had some customer service issues due to their massive growth. Which is not acceptable but understandable. The hack affected .00001 of all accounts.

Great news the other day about earnings , going through the roof , and price continues to Plummet !!!!!!!!!! And , people on here still continue to say and defend , that the STOCK MARKET ain't MANIPULATED !!!!!!!! What a JOKE ?????"
I think I got a crypto problem. I find myself buying every other day. I guess there are worse habits

"By 10am this starts to turn, just profit taking. Coin will guide higher on a nice earning beat. Suspect a 20-30 bump tomorrow."
In for 60 more shares at 261. total 180 shares around 234 average. i am convinced this is just going to make tons of money in the future. At least 10-11 EPS this year gives it a PE of low 20's with insane growth
"OK, I'll admit I'm surprised on this one. I expected lots of movement AH after earnings, but it's just flat."
did you hear the news !!!!
Gap has been filled.
You can draw a technical positive trend line from July 19 to August 26. COIN is trending down shorter term at the moment but longer term looks positive. It will be a while to get to $300
Good thing it was upgraded or it would have dropped big today.
$COIN is a must own stock in your portfolio. It is gonna grow exponentially in near term. Just buy and hold it for few years to become a Rich. It will be added into S&P in few years

"In addition to being a ""market-leading crypto asset exchange"" already, argues Todaro, with more than 68 million users spread across more than 100 countries, controlling $223 billion in assets, Coinbase has ""significant future opportunities"" to grow its business beyond mere exchange services, including by offering services in ""staking, custody, yield bearing products, and more."""
Patience is the key.
Upgraded with $420 price target!!!! Company is printing money machine!! Crypto here to stay
Let’s close at 270 today! Buy and hold! This is seriously undervalued!
Just bought another 150 shares.
