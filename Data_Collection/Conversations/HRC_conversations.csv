I guess this isn't followed by retail traders much lol. Any news on whether deal going to happen or fall apart like last month...
Street Color: Baxter International Reportedly Makes $144/Share Acquisition Offer for Hill-Rom
please accept that bid for $144. what were you thinking?
CNBC reporting #$%$ cash price is $156 from baxter. About an hour ago. Regardless it's a solid company and cash is cheap to finance these days...maybe goes for 160 or higher.
"I’ve got my order set for $160, it’s positive news - should do better"
i just read deal should close pretty quick; end of year at worst.
HRC reached a new All Time High at 88.69

So when would you actually be getting the $156? I'm surprised the market price is only $150ish right now...thanks if naaive question
New to posting here. Although have owned HRC in past.Why has stock gone down so sharply? Some exposure to Virus?
"with their 65,660,000 shares outstanding I come up with buyout price per share of 152."
HRC is up 5.06% to 109.99
Oh. Actually the deal was just posted …
all looks good to me
Hill-Rom reached an all time high at 154.05
"HRC has all new beds, wheelchairs, modular furniture, Patient monitoring systems, rehab equipment. It has everything to equip the OR and hospital. Best med tech stockj i have ever seen."
"Very positive print this morning for HRC, topping expectations again this quarter reporting EPS of $1.14 vs. $1.11 expected, and revenue of $714.2m vs. $707.8m. Guidance raised for the year to $1.33 per share. The company seems to be firing on all cylinders with core revenue up by 6% and new product sales momentum is growing."
I just find it amusing that the recent Zacks article doesn’t even mention the potential for them to be bought out 
I kinda wish there was a way to take Baxter stock if it avoided taxes… but I’m probably just splitting hairs since I bought this a while ago…
Why is there no interest here? These guys build fabulous medical gas headwall components for hospital rooms. They have new leadership now focused on r&d for innovation in their field. I think this is an untapped sweetie pateetie
HRC is pure play worth $140
Does anyone know what to expect from all this shareholder litigation going on?
155 here we come 
After working in hospital they control every part of it.Bst medical tech stock i have ever seen.
The market is completely upside down crazy. This stock ran up to $100 on Wed because I believe people read the articles understanding the shortage of hospital beds. That actually made sense. This shows how no is willing to hold a gain more than 24 hours regardless if their business is profiting from this nightmare.
Why hasn’t it gone 156 yet?
"Adding alot of shares here. Growing 18-25%, and Peg ratio is less than one. bargain for such high quality co. WE use all their products every day"
anybody know when we get paid ?
155 target this week
"Make the deal non-taxable.Let's do a non-taxable stock for stock deal. That way, we all benefit. Sell if you want the cash, keep if you do not want to pay taxes."
Baxter takeover Make it a non-taxable stock-for-stock takeover and you have my vote!
Morgan Stanley conference: What did they say at the conference today. I couldnt get into web meeting. I take it not good news seeing how stock has dropped. I was looking to make an initial buy here. But now this has got me nervous.
seems to be a good report; new rev's in biz; ee's beat.....only down part was the ancillary hospital work due to covid....not sure why the sell off?
Hopefully they sign the deal this week otherwise the stock will be bouncing all over the place. Could get ugly is weak hands fold.
HRC reached a new All Time High at 91.00
HRC reached a new All Time High at 88.57
I think Baxter my have to increase their 144 offer to get the deal done.
HRC reached a new All Time High at 86.98
Re: Baxter takeoverWhat is going on? Any news?
"Yahoo Reader: Any idea why HRC has not been taken over by a larger player in the health field? With the limited number of shares outstanding and the huge amounts held by institutions, a takeover could be done rather easily in my view."
