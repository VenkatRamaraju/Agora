Why is there no interest here? These guys build fabulous medical gas headwall components for hospital rooms. They have new leadership now focused on r&d for innovation in their field. I think this is an untapped sweetie pateetie

"Yahoo Reader: Any idea why HRC has not been taken over by a larger player in the health field? With the limited number of shares outstanding and the huge amounts held by institutions, a takeover could be done rather easily in my view."
I guess this isn't followed by retail traders much lol. Any news on whether deal going to happen or fall apart like last month...

I would be curious if anybody has more insight to the drop other than no future guidance provided in report. Seems to be a good report. I cannot find much in the news on specifics
I kinda wish there was a way to take Baxter stock if it avoided taxes… but I’m probably just splitting hairs since I bought this a while ago…
Street Color: Baxter International Reportedly Makes $144/Share Acquisition Offer for Hill-Rom
HRC is down 5.38% to 84.57
I just find it amusing that the recent Zacks article doesn’t even mention the potential for them to be bought out 
"ugh... I just KNEW I shouldn't have bought a stock with a ticker symbol the same as Hillary Rodham Clinton's initials! Stupid, stupid, stupid!"
The market is completely upside down crazy. This stock ran up to $100 on Wed because I believe people read the articles understanding the shortage of hospital beds. That actually made sense. This shows how no is willing to hold a gain more than 24 hours regardless if their business is profiting from this nightmare.
Omg why has it fallen after hours
Oh. Actually the deal was just posted …

Hopefully they sign the deal this week otherwise the stock will be bouncing all over the place. Could get ugly is weak hands fold.
