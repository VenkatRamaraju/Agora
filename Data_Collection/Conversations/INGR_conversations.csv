"Plant based meats are all the rage for some nowadays. Look at BYND valuation as example 1. These companies need to buy their plant-based proteins from somewhere and in many cases that somewhere will be Ingredion and their pea-based protein. Small portion of business today, but important growth driver longer term nonetheless. Good luck to INGR longs!"
"Curious as to what you long term longs here think of the new AMRS deal. I'm an AMRS long. The company is a leader in the synthetic biology industry and can manufacture pure REb-M from sugarcane using genetically engineered yeast. It's modern alchemy and the future of chemistry. Recommend that you go to the Investors area on the AMyris web site and listen to the very recent Investor conference on ingredients. The company is owned 38% by John Doerr, one of the greatest tech investors in history. Bill Gates also has a small position because of the work they are doing on vaccines. I hope both of our companies enjoy and fruitful and profitable relationship for years to come! Warning, AMRS is the very definition of a volatile, cutting edge tech stock that has never been profitable in its history. It's turn around is happening this year but next year will be most likely when it finally becomes actually profitable. The company has been around for 20 years."

"Anyone else buying this dip? Not sure why this name is seeing so much weakness today. Curious, what's the bear case here?"
"Wow, I certainly pick boring stocks no comments for a month this is even worse than CNC. I've been watching this one for awhile and pulled trigger at 91.94. I'm sorry I didn't get it before last earning report, but it's a function of cash flow and having it at the right time."

Ingr out perform bynd . That’s rare .
"Picked off 500 more at $68.76. Looks undervalued and cheap, nice div., fairly stable business no matter what the economy, and stands to benefit from more open trade and squelching of COVID. Unfortunately I still have a hefty paper loss as I picked up quite a few shares at $112 area. Another plus is a possible takeover of this company. I was kind of hoping to pick up more shares in the $65-66 area before today’s COVID news."

Best quarter since 2017! Note stock price then was 110-135 which is where it should be heading!
"I'm bullish on this segment, however I'm in pain reading that the company suffers declining profits due to increasing supply chain and operations costs (2019, 2018 annual report e.g.). A company such as this should simply be more innovative to have a bright future. Sugar is one of the most hazardous ingredients in food, and alternatives to this should be much more profitable than this. Sorry."

For $30 more a share . I bought beyond meat and sold a profit . Easy money . This had its run of $ 116 months ago
Looking for a good quarter May 4!
"All things considered, decent earnings from Ingredion today. Deeply under-valued at this point, so actively buying shares."
This is truly a remarkable company and mindful of its shareholders. I wish I had bought more shares a couple of years ago..I guess I should be grateful for what I have!
In greed eon

"I'm getting concerned about the weakening balance sheet of Ingredion. Silly stock buybacks at inflated prices have wasted a lot of money. Now, there's news Zallie is hunting for a big European. Translation, he'll overpay and further weaken a fairly good balance sheet. Hey Jim, grow organically by investing in innovation. Keep the balance sheet strong! After the next recession, there will be plenty of businesses to buy at much lower prices. Be like Hormel, not GE!!!"

"I don't know about anyone else here, but I like having this very boring dividend stock in my portfolio. It also helps knowing the stock is trading for less than 1/2 the market multiple. My fair value is $120+ at this point. Don't expect any answers being this board is pretty dead, but one can hope."
Have we found the bottom yet?
Nice earnings report this morn. Perhaps this stock can get some respect. Nice yield and a reasonable valuation in a relatively non cyclical business..

seems like an overreaction to the write-down

"Great quarter, I haven't fully digested cause for write-off, hope it doesn't tank the price."
Any price targets?
"With the exception if the CFO buying 1000 share, no insider purchases with their own money. Pretty discouraging."
Nice balance sheet move management. Take on $1B debt at low long term rates to pay off higher coupon ST debt and have a war chest. Solid.
