The same thing happened last time Royal reported bad earnings …Norwegian took a bigger hitThis trend won’t last long Norwegian is the biggest winner from the kids vaccine all other cruise lines already accept kidsAnd perfect timing for holidays cruises
"SHAREHOLDER ALERT!I just wanted to make anyone who owns NCLH, CCL or RCL aware that there is one person on ALL major cruise message boards that constantly post negative fake news, lie after lie, bankruptcy talk, share dilutions and anything else he feels like spreading is on this board and other cruise boards. This user in a heartbeat will go from acting like a short player with some of hi aliases to a long with the other half and play both sides.He has admitted on the CCL board that he has no skin in the game with CCL.He is very well known on the CCL board with 73 different usernames. Approximately 95% of all posts on the CCL board including replies to messages, thumbs up or down are all his. You will also notice all conversations he has are with himself and all his alias’s.If he does not post on the CCL board, there is literally no action on that board by legit users. He has chased them all away.He has also over the last 18 months especially the first 8-12 months of the COVID crash stolen identities from people by copying their profile images and using their names and posting messages that were negative, derogatory, inflammatory, sexual, hateful, and just about anything you can think of.There is plenty of proof submitted to verify all this. (He does delete quite a bit of his messages) however, the are saved.Just to give you heads up here are just a short list of the usernames he uses if you have seen them on your message boards:Please keep in mind that this guy deletes messages all the time but please check out your board and especially the CCL board to see what I am talking about.Chart MasterJeffIssayStacy Gap Tooth AbramsIce EhBillRobertKeithZWolf Of Wall StreetWin Or LoseDavidHabibAllenCarn-Evil C.LShowtimePrincess CaysGeorgeKevinAnd many many more.Please take it for what it is worth……… NOTHING, it is all fake."

"Ooops, interest rates are rising around the world = norwegian’s debt will be even bigger"
$25 is the bottom. It's good to know that. Whoever wants to get on board has to go up from that price. It's good to test the bottom. There is no worse than that. Now it will start bouncing up. Enjoy guys.
Don't think we individual investors can be held under the thumb of the institutions any longer. The average Joe is going to want in on these stocks now. These manipulators won't be able to control the volume of people wanting in.
CDC panel endorses Pfizer Covid booster shots for people 65 and older
Cruise stocks are being held down by MM. Once their greedy little grips can no longer hold on cruise stocks will easily surpass pre-pandemic levels. Don't be the one who says I should have bought that stock in the 20's. :)
There is a strong rise that will come during this week to at least 28 dollars
Nice come back
"My mom whose in Uk just got off of a cruise out of Southampton where she contracted COVID. She hadn’t been across door step for 18 months. Thankfully vaccinated, hospital stay was minimized. She said multiple passengers impacted and were throwing up on board …. Crew suggested it wasn’t COVID but regular virusI’m hopeful that the industry will get a grip of this"
"Pfizer's COVID vaccine appears safe and effective for children 5-11, new data showsUpdated 9:17 am EDT Oct. 22, 2021Over the next two weeks, two government agencies will have to decide whether newly released data from Pfizer-BioNTech is convincing enough to justify authorizing COVID-19 vaccines for children ages 5 through 11.Because children are unlikely to become severely ill from COVID-19, vaccines have to be incredibly safe and have a significant impact on the pandemic to justify their use in this age group, experts say."
"As of 1600hrs S&P & NASDAQ showed nice gains. NASDAQ listed NCL is also having a nice day by our standards only down .10 cents. Ships Ahoy to all my fellow NCL shareholders. After spending 3 hours reading NCL's 2nd quarter financial statement posted on their official site. Would call it an interesting read. For those who can decipher financial statements would seriously suggest you read every word. Del Rio is not the type of CEO who is capable to navigate NCL from financial ruin. Owning 1 share of NCL purchased pre-market am. I question why my fellow shareholders approved 490 million more shares? Del Rio spells out NCL continue's to look for more outside funding. Statement clearly shows all the countries were NCL has already taken on more debt. Yet my fellow shareholders approved 490 million more share's. Further depleting NCL's stock value. As all major cruise lines are basically operating all vessels. We shareholders should feel confident Del Rio announced he wants entire fleet of 50+ vessels on the high sea's by April 2022. Only 5 more months of almost zero revenue. Silent Bull once wrote the market is a forward looking instrument. Which he is 100% correct. Unfortunately as NCL shareholders that statement implies you own a piece of a functioning company. Stocks are about making money. I am now an NCL shareholder. Would never hold on to a company to prove some bizarre point. NCL has basically not operated in 18 months. If I said got a great stock tip. Buy Delta airlines tomorrow. You naturally ask who gave you the tip and what did your tipster mention. He's a pilot on Monday Delta is going to announce for the next 18 months we are only going to maintain our NY/London Heathrow Airport 5 flights. Would you then buy the stock tomorrow? Not the way business works. Slice a cake anyway you want its still a cake. If you're in the bakery, restaurant business presentation matters. No customer is going to purchase a cake which someone punched their fist into even if it taste great. If you're in the cruise business you need passengers and ports of call. It's not rocket science. When a CEO of any company writes we hope to be back to full capacity in April 2022. Guess what NCL's share price is not going to sky rocket from $25.50.Contrary!!! NCL barely operating and adding debt everyday IS A GREAT STOCDK TO OWN!!!! I don't give a hoot what any analyst says. Take a look at the institutional holders. Look at the insider trading of top NCL executives. I have not looked because have any understanding of BR talk. If a nitwit shareholder like myself read that Del Rio & any of his Regent Cruise Line's cronies sold any shares. It means one of two things they are totally incompetent or bankruptcy is on the horizon. I read every NCL executive bio last night. Known worked for a major cruise line in the past. Sh-t stocks are to make money. The S&P is up 50% YTD. I can tell you after the next earning report which believe comes out next month will not cause NCL' stock price to sky rocket. You know why because they are barely operating. If your neighborhood supermarket sold everything 18 months ago. Now they only sell milk, eggs, water and spinach for the last 18 month are you so in love with that supermarket you're willing to keep supporting the neighborhood supermarket and only eat eggs and drink milk or water. No your going a half mile away to a fully stocked supermarket. Some guy wrote me it's your state. I actually said after reading thats someone so bullheaded to hold something as the market has sky rocketed since mid-April 2020 to prove your loyalty to a company. Save loyalty for loved ones buy stocks to make money. I may live in Florida know the players in the shipping business and will tell you Del Rio does not have the clout to move the needle. Big business is done behind close doors. Why would a Judge continue to keep ruling against NCL now after all major close lines are operating a higher court rules differently. Making it appear to the outside world NCL was in the right. I look at it differently NCL's weak management team did not act in the best interest of us the shareholders. I would not get into a legal battle for a multitude of reasons. NCL only has one GC. I guarantee you he was not involved in any of NCL documented ridiculous court battle's. I would guess by this time next year we all should receive a letter from Goldman, Stearns and Goldberg asking all shareholders to take part in the class action lawsuit which definitely will be forthcoming."
Looking forward the earnings. Cash flows and trying to understand current cruise profitability (?] are my main points of interest.
Big volume going down! Shorts will be rich soon :) Big potential of going below $20! :D
1.5 million shares traded after hours for a 26c or 1% gain that’s about 10 times the normal after hours AverageI wonder if someone knows something good happening tomorrow!!!!Fauci or whatever his name is said children vaccine will be approved in 2 weeks
"it's way too early to take profits, they will be sorry they did.. on to 33+ this week"
don't expect anything from this stock for 6 months... very possible we see 20 before new years.
"buy now, it will be 50 this time next year, a 100% gain"
"Enjoy your weekend longs we managed another positive week somehow with all the blood sheds everywhere And for the shorts and haters take my advice and get out you are too late in the game….you will get burned soon, the worst is behind this sector already!"
$285m per month in cash costs. $2.8b cash in the bank. $12b in debt. Looks like about 10-13 months of operating cash at current levels. Jan 2023 put options look enticing.
As I am a cynic I say Citi upgraded NCLH because they think NCLH will want to raise more equity after they announce Q3. Or that its major P/E shareholder will want to sell a huge block.
"I just did a 7 day cruise to Alaska with nclh, they gave me balcony suite, premium drink package ($69 pp)taxes and gratiuites included.$100 a day Ship was only 1/4 fullHad a great time"
"If you look at the one and five year charts, you will see the consistent trend here.......there's no need to panic when it consolidates like this... instead these are buying opportunities.Cruising will continue to grow as time passes."
Sorry guys I promised we close above $26 I was just one day late $28+ by next Friday the 1st of October Do your part a hold on to ur shares It’s not an easy ride but it will be great in the end !
"12-3-2020 close $25.42. I mentioned on June 2,2020 this board. I am a representative on the Florida cruise ship council board. My stevedoring company handles both cargo & cruise vessels on average 1.75 ships per day 365 days a year in Port Miami. Been doing it for 30 years. Yet cruise stocks will not sky rocket anytime soon. I could go into a multitude of reasons. So I decided to stop by the board. Silent Bull is still preaching to his much much smaller flock. The benchmark MM use is the S&P on June 2,2020 closed at 3,055. At this moment 10-20-21 S&P 4535.It has appreciated 50%. Had you invested 50k in the S&P ON 6-2-20. You now have $75,000. In an extremely safe conservative investment. Had you purchased 50k of NCL on 12-3-20. On 10-20-21 you made zero. Anyone who understands investing would be hard pressed to have bought quality companies while the S&P appreciates 50% and have not made good money."
"it's time for all shorts to rush to buy, do it now or at 30+ next week, heading to 40"
Does anyone have any news source on why all the travel sector is down today while the market is up big ???Something useful please no high debt or Covid garbage talk
Question: when people say “record bookings”…what specifically do they mean? Do cruise lines have a record backlog of passengers? Are ships sailing at “record” capacity (+99% full)? Ate companies seeing a record number of bookings per week? Just curious what the specifics of these record bookings actually mean. Thanks

For those of you who don't watch any conservative news like Newsmax or Tucker or listen to a.m. 790 you ...really have no idea the state this country is in right now and it's bad.... B has pretty much ruined every positive thing that T built ...having said that we will recover in cruising ...it's just going to take longer than it should have.￼￼Elections have consequences and it's so important all you young people educate yourselves and stop listening to the main stream media￼
Booking is good and people are ready to sail. The biggest issue I see digging into the companies profits is higher labor and fuel. Thanks JOE B.
"Silent Bull, can we please stop with the politics. Good lordIf you don't want to talk about NCLH, then move on, some of us don't want to here your BS and conspiracytalk."
"All this blood today, and the stock has not fallen more than 60 cents. This means that the stock is desirable. Even Royal Caribbean fell by about $2 or more. Norwegians are under the microscope of investors now."
"30 soon, very soon"
The next $2-3 dollars up when the children vaccine gets approved soon
"Put Covid aside for the moment, very big issue are the rising operating costs on cruises that were sold when oil was $60, now $83+ and will go to $100. These cruises are really going to struggle to turn a profit."
"Next week will be amazing, huge drop is expected after earnings <3"
75% of the ships will be operating by the end of the year.
Today $23 :)) Congratulations to all shorts who doubled their positions recently
There may be hope for the wall mart of cruise ships; but I doubt it.
"Not as high as others because people are taking profits this is good solid hold and more will be buying, technicals suggest $35-$37 so still money to make"
Will close red today :) Continuing nice trend of closing lower every session :)
any good new news about covid treatment or children's vaccine then up 2 dollars again

$29 on Monday...
Does anyone really think we will get over 40 within 3 years?
"It’s just the start, some of you didn’t miss the boat yet. The time to buy NCLH is now before $32 next stop"
More opportunities to load up...￼
"Is there a reason beyond rising gas prices for why the travel sector seems to be ignoring above expectations on earnings report? (logical explanations, not (this stock is trash)Both UAL and AAL both beat on EPS and revenue. The only thing I saw down for them was rising gas prices, and that Q4 wouldn't match 2019 Q4 numbers. And in all honestly who didn't already know that? Of course we wont be at pre covid levels. I am still positive on the long term for NCLH, but the past two weeks have been beyond frustrating. Good news on the COVID front, 3 earnings report that beat expectations, and it can't seem to hold an up day. Is there some news I am not seeing?"
"On the day of the results announcement, the surprise will be the volume of reservations, demand and the return of cash flow in a way that exceeds expectations"
"United Airlines results exceeded expectations, this will positively affect the travel and tourism sector, including cruise"
This is easy money. I will sell at 60. 6-18 months. Bookings are through the roof and covid is over for the normal people.

"13 Norwegian ships will return to service on the first of next December, at least, at $30 per share soon"
"A tidbit on fuel cost: How much does it cost to fuel a cruise ship? A smaller-sized cruise ship like the Norwegian Spirit costs about $80,000 per day on fuel. A larger cruise ship like Freedom of the Seas can cost up to $2 million per day to fuel. "
"Despite climate change promises, governments plan to ramp up fossil fuel production"
My guess is pricing now falling as the industry has relaunched all/virtually all ships for booking by summer/2022.

Norwegian Cruise Line set to launch full fleet by April for first time since pandemic no-sail orders
There are pre-scheduled trips for the next month and the next month. Reservations and occupancy rates can exceed expectations
Told you last week we'd likely see 26 ...but now we should start heading back up shortly￼...Buying opportunities..!!￼
Nobody believes in this stock :) And it will be even worse after disaster earnings coming next week
There is a rumour that Norwegian Cruise Line are building a new cruise ship that can go to the moon. Just sharing a little inside info…
"Really BS that these cruise companies pay the help onboard about $2.00/hour, not subject to US labor laws and pay basically nothing in US Corporate taxes."
"This is from Harry Sommer president of Norwegian cruise line on an interview today with Cruise critic“By Q1 2022, we'll be in a good place. I think it will be Q2 or Q3 until we get back to what is really normal in terms of all ships in operation around the world and at full occupancy. Every day, every week should be a little better than the week before.”"
"Nabeel: Tell us the truth, have you ever been on an NCL cruise?"
"It's so nice to sell every silly up move, we all know it is not going anywhere higher, this stock is money-making machine for shorts <3 it never lets us down!"
Don’t get discouraged by today’s action Stocks have their off days based of numbers of factors NCL had a great run last week compared to CCL and even RCL so for the two to outperform us today is very normal The shorts will try to convince you that the run is over and it will go down from here but we all know that’s not the caseSo hang on and enjoy the rough ride to $40+
"Its possible we see 26, (buying opportunities)....but then 29-30 is up next...."
Not Sure if the Florida state Attorneys appealing the judges decision on the vaccine mandate that was won by NCL has something to do with the price drop todayIf so it will be a very short lived drop because so many businesses including the federal government have followed NCL on the vaccine mandate now and in so many other states as well….So it’s gonna be almost impossible to overturn the judge’s decision The Attorneys want the judge to limit businesses to mandate/ask for a vaccine but can’t ask consumers for a proof I mean come on Florida even during Jesus’s time people weren’t that honest 
@Nabeel as you can see 21 SMA is a wall ;) very weak stock
It's like I've tried to say to all of you... if you really want to know what's going on with the cruise lines you have to have a broad understanding of what's going on in the country... but nobody seems to want to listen to that information so lets just all say ...it's going to go up one day￼...!What the B administration is doing has consequences and you're seeing it ....so understand what's going on around you and you'll better understand where the stock is going￼.Ultimately it will prevail.. it's just gonna take longer because of the people that are currently in office that are clueless about what to do and how to run a country￼
Unless you people do your research on conservative websites or radio stations you are not going to understand what's going on around you ....even with Southwest airlines the Dow Jones report on Yahoo lied... they blamed the thousands of cancellations on Weather when in fact it's thousands of pilots that are walking off the job rather than being forced to get vaccinated.￼
One thing that bothers me more than seeing NCL stock go down is to have to read some people’s posts here who they claim to be some saints sent to us from above to give us an investment advice with Zero position or personal interest in this stock I mean come on why you don’t see me wasting my time and posting on a different company’s chat room?Simply because I don’t own it Or care
"I wouldn’t read too much into the price action here these last couple of weeks. I say that because the volume has been very, very low which opens up the trading to manipulation by shorts and others that have a vested interest in the price going down. Yesterday for example, the volume was 6.75 million shares or 50.5% of the three month average volume! I expect that this stock is going to run up hard on volume so I’d encourage everyone to stay the course and be here to profit."
"@Nabeel low volume today when going up, what does it mean, could you explain to us?"

"Covid cases in the US are down 40% in less than a month. With the Covid rate going down and vaccination rates way up, the reopening trade is the way to go at this point and NCLH is where I’m putting my money!"
The start of the day felt a lot more like it did about a month ago when there was some volatility in the stock and you could do a day trade and come away with a nice profit.￼ I guess that did not quite hold up today. I should have sold early and bought Back in at the end.￼Tomorrow’s another day. Good luck to us all!
One of the reasons why we struggling is carnival cancellations for some of their sailing in January and February This has nothing to do with the pandemic it’s purely about miscalculated decisions just like their flip flap on protocols that changes weekly NCL continues to be the must efficient and safe cruise line out there “Full fleet strong by End of March”
At one point B is going to have to grow up and learn economics 101 that you cannot keep throwing money from the sky at people...... the key has always been for a capitalist economy for people to go to work... keep taxes low... and the economy WILL boom.... just like they were doing last year before b showed up.￼

Saw some that we really liked in August 2023 and will see what kind of deposit they want on a $22,000-$25,000 trip. Even my wife fell for a couple of choices. Crazy because it's a little less than 2 years from now! I'll be speaking with my advisor there."
FDA authorizes Pfizer’s Covid vaccine for kids ages 5 to 11
"How could any humans screw up the amazing economy we had just 10 months ago..... All b had to do was sit back and take a vacation and enjoy what T built....but instead b purposely destroys this economy, single-handedly has wiped out all the positive things we had going in this country, opened our borders wide open to further damage America. Gas prices at near all time highs when just eight months ago it was a dollar something a gallon.￼And you people wonder why it's taking cruising so long to recover while Lord fauzi sets on his throne and tries to ruin Christmas again￼￼"
In August 2021 Morningstar raised its fair value estimate for Norwegian to $30 per share. This was based on Morningstar’s belief that Norwegian would see passenger capacity surpassing 2019 levels in 2023. But the CEO Jack Del Rio has stated that the company is on track to surpass 2019 levels in 2022 OR A YEAR EARLIER. That’s a very significant change that has the potential to push the price of this stock to the next level when the company reports next month and substantiates what Del Rio said.
Now cruise ship can carry Merck pills in case that any passenger get infected with Covid19. It is effective and can be cured with in 2 days.- 3 pills a day
"If global economic growth needs a drop in oil prices and it is in the interest of the United States, then the US administration will pressure OPEC and Saudi Arabia in particular to increase production significantly to reduce oil prices and create a global economic balance, but it seems so far the United States does not see the need for that"
Are you guys ready for another red day? Shorts loaded up? Today we are expecting nice profits from our freshly increased shorts!
*Full fleet by end of March *Spending on board at all time high (that’s where they make the big $$$$)*Demand and plans on track Why are we still under $30 people?
back to 33 this week or next
I am bearish on Norwegian. Debt and dwindling cash to start the redeployment of shops is the reason. This company should issue someStock ASAP as they will be out of cash by June/July of 2022 is they plan to sail all ships by april (doubtful to me). Good luck all
As long as CDC stays out of the way come January we will begin to se some great returns here.

News on Pfizer covid shot clearance for kids - speculation approval for today.
"Do not forget the request of AstraZeneca company for emergency approval to use its new treatment for Corona, which you will receive soon, in addition to the approval of the authorities for the children to receive the Pfizer vaccine soon, this will also push the price up, of course"
I think the back half of 2022 could be the best back half the company ever had. That is how good bookings are for the future. That's how strong pricing is….Norwegian CEO Jack Del Rio
"12% are short.. We'll, they better start covering unless they want to loss another 15% in 5 days like last week... $100/share soon.. Go longs..."
don't miss the boat every one
NCLH looks like trash today - I bet it falls from here. Glad I am signed up to (http://the-alphatrader.com) so that I can get stocks that actually move!
"Great time to increase shorts, averages are like a wall which this stock can't cross :) bounce back is coming"
"COVID cases fall by 25%, fueling hope that Delta has peaked"
Congrats to those who bought the dip over the last couple days instead of cowering in fear.We will have ups and downs and as you can see we move cyclically with medical news but overall it continues in an upward trend￼￼.On another note the Durham probe although lo-o-o-o-ng overdue is proving how this ENTIRE Russia nonsense was a complete and utter hoax created by Clinton and spread by none other than the Dems and the main stream media to TRY to harm T. and undermine his success.
This stock is a no brainer guys and girls. Don't bother with the small pennies up and down on the daily/weekly. This will run easily over $55 very soon. Buy and Hold - Buffett style. There's a reason he's a billionairre.
"NCLH is the best stock on the market to short, you can be sure of profits if you open a short. It's very weak stock, can't deal with any of SMA, also a lot of negative news is coming and disaster earnings soon <3 let's short this to $10!"

cdc approved today for kids vaccinated
Why?????? Not rising?????
"Update after speaking with some cruise contacts. Most major lines sailing from a US port are allowing shipsto carry 75% of passenger capacity. A very astute poster made an excellent point on rising fuel cost. Which at this point and time cruise line's will not pass the increase on to the passengers. A large cruise ship burns 250 tons per day = 80,000 gallons. Vessel either burn Fossil Fuel through a Diesel engine or HFO= Heavy Full Oil.If you're still d--king around thinking major cruise lines stock are going to appreciate to a decent profit anytime soon to the delight of shareholders I would reevaluate my position. Obviously no major cruise line unless it is absolutely necessary buys fuel in the US."
"The pricing here baffles me. Covid rates are down and vaccination rates are up. The company will have 75% of its ships sailing and generating revenue by the end of this year and the entire fleet in operation by April 2022. For the ships that have sailed so far, onboard spending is up and guest satisfaction scores are very high. Demand for cruises in 2022 and beyond is thru the roof and so are prices. The CEO is on record saying that he expects the company to be cash flow positive in Q1 2022. And…..the stock today is trading at the same price it was trading last December 2020 before any of these very positive developments. Makes absolutely no sense….."
Opportunity to buy today for those who haven't boarded yet
until COVID is DONE and I mean completely DONE.... this stock goes nowhere... except possibly down... the winter uptick in cases WILL send this stock back to the teens. Believe it!
Covid-19 cases in the US over the past 14 days are falling dramatically. Texas: down 34% Mississippi: down 37% Georgia: down 42% California: down 38%
"Can't wait to double profits next week, when disaster earnings will be announced!!"
Nabeel where are you? Didn't you pay bills to your internet provider because of NCLH?
These mandated vaxes are NOT going to work. Antibody therapeutics will and have been the solution. They will create variant after variant ...they have plenty of letters in the alphabet left
"College football stadiums are full , how much longer do you think it will be before cruise ships are full too ? It doesn’t take a genius to figure that out , everything is opening back up ! Cruise on my friends "
it is at the bottom of the trend line. tripled my position. it either bounces soon or tumbled another 5%-8%
Hedge Funds Have Never Been This Bullish On Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH)
"Pfizer and BioNTech ask the FDA to approve shots for younger kidsYesterday Pfizer-BioNTech asked the FDA to issue an emergency use authorization for its vaccine in kids ages 5 to 11. The drugmakers are submitting relevant data, including information on how it will formulate the two pediatric doses, which are each one-third of those given to adults. The agency is tentatively scheduled to discuss this in an October 26 meeting, and a CDC advisory panel meeting has been scheduled for November 2 and 3, which means shots for children in this age group could be available shortly after that. Many parents are eager to get their kids vaccinated and experts have said that inoculating younger Americans is a key step in ending this pandemic."
Well you don't have to look far to know where the problem is in this country.....b￼
I am staying far away from NCLH - It looks like it is going to drop off a cliff. I actually get way better stocks at http://alert-sounds.com/
next week norwegian week
"Nabeel you could have sold at 29, but now you will never see 26+ again ;) bad times for norwegian just begins - higher interest rates, bigger debt, another lockdowns as the new wave begins and oil prices higher and higher, good luck with the titanic"
"I have been saying this for while now “it’s not about how many ships you put at sea but how full and profitable they are “ all they are doing is paying wages and burning fuel on empty ships!! Norwegian occupancy rate will come up much higher than 36% Royal Caribbean reported an occupancy rate of 36.4%, well below an already-low 48.5% predicted by analysts.The company's occupancy rate is a measure of the amount of available passenger capacity, or cabins, being utilized and is a key measure of Royal Caribbean's overall business.Royal Caribbean expects that 50 of its 61 ships will have returned to service by the end of 2021.The company announced that sailings for 2022 are booked within historical ranges and at higher prices than 2019."
