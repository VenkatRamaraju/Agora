"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
"While other cruise companies are making changes and introducing new measures to try and keep covid and the delta variant off their ships, Norwegian hasn’t implemented any new measures. More specifically, NCLH requires no masks onboard, there is no social distancing, there are no capacity limitations, there are no restrictions on shore excursions and all experiences restaurants, activities and experiences are open."
"it's time for all shorts to rush to buy, do it now or at 30+ next week, heading to 40"
Hedge Funds Have Never Been This Bullish On Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH)
Don’t get discouraged by today’s action Stocks have their off days based of numbers of factors NCL had a great run last week compared to CCL and even RCL so for the two to outperform us today is very normal The shorts will try to convince you that the run is over and it will go down from here but we all know that’s not the caseSo hang on and enjoy the rough ride to $40+
Slowly but surely we’ll get to $60
Congrats to those who bought the dip over the last couple days instead of cowering in fear.We will have ups and downs and as you can see we move cyclically with medical news but overall it continues in an upward trend￼￼.On another note the Durham probe although lo-o-o-o-ng overdue is proving how this ENTIRE Russia nonsense was a complete and utter hoax created by Clinton and spread by none other than the Dems and the main stream media to TRY to harm T. and undermine his success.
"30 soon, very soon"
Struggling to hold Too many nerves people taking profits I still see a close above $28 today
"Carnival (CCL, CUK) said Wednesday its Seabourn Encore luxury cruise ship will resume service earlier than expected, starting Feb. 19, with a series of new 10- and 11-day itineraries round-trip from Lisbon, Portugal, to the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean."

"I just recently learned, as an investor that reads up on every little bit of news the cruise lines put out, that if you are under 12yo you will not be going on any NCL cruises. This is because only the vaccinated are allowed, so even if you have a 6month old baby, they are not allowed on. This seems to be an omitted material fact in my opinion for us investors. If I would’ve known this was how it was going to be, I would not have bought so much stock in NCL. Not too many people cruising without their children. Really bad news that should’ve been very clear toall investors. Anyone else want to do something about this? Or just have general thoughts on this?"
I never sell this until I get $200.It has been in possession for 18 months.It will cost $200 in the next 40 months.The cruise boom has begun.
Let's go green NCL and komof stock today
"The stock is subjected to tremendous pressure to reduce the price, but it is steadfast and resisting strongly, even though the storm is severe."

"Over 18 months into the pandemic, cruise companies are offering ""cruises to nowhere."" New variants are emerging on a quarterly basis and winter is approaching.

"Over 400,000 illegals heading our way for a second breach and none of them required to have any Covid vaccines or protection whatsoever....... how does that square with all these mandates being forced on American citizens causing tens of thousands to quit their jobs as b floods the country with more and more illegals with no checks and balances.￼￼"

"Enjoy your weekend longs we managed another positive week somehow with all the blood sheds everywhere And for the shorts and haters take my advice and get out you are too late in the game….you will get burned soon, the worst is behind this sector already!"
"Do not forget the request of AstraZeneca company for emergency approval to use its new treatment for Corona, which you will receive soon, in addition to the approval of the authorities for the children to receive the Pfizer vaccine soon, this will also push the price up, of course"
"Norwegian Breakaway Embark successfully from New York The 3,963-passenger Norwegian Breakaway restarted operations from New York on September 26 and was the first in the fleet to resume from the Big Apple. In-store for the guests is a cruise where all outlets are open fully, no social distancing is necessary, masks are not required, and all buffets, restaurants, and bars are open as usual."
...29 coming soon....small dip then we pass 30
"How long will we wait for the stock to reach $30, long-term investors?"
The next $2-3 dollars up when the children vaccine gets approved soon
All travel and transportation companies should add a fuel surcharge to their ticket prices I mean if McDonald’s is charging 5 Bucks for McNuggets and people are gladly paying it then what’s the problem

"What business that you know wants big deposits 2 years in advance and is not putting it in trust, using unearned money for this week’s payroll or to print more expensive brochures?"
"senan Where are u do you think, in light of the strong decline of the indicators today, and the Norwegians still maintain 28, this means that there is a strong rise from here that will happen later when the indicators recover tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, what do you think"
"Hold onto your shares and if you're not in yet ...get in￼.And of course the dems admitted today that they released over 13,000 Haitians into the US.. none of which have any vaccines as they admitted they are not asking any of them to get vaccinated ...so ask yourselves ..do they really care about your health ??..or is this the big con to try to force as many of you out of your jobs as possible for refusing the vaccine.￼. Use your heads and think."
Seriously how are all these cruise liners making money when they have not sailed in over a year. There is no revenue and they have to pay for general overhead. Do the math people and sell what you have for profit and buy again when it drops. That’s the cycle for these industry now. It goes up when the government announced vaccine mandate and then tank after.
Does anyone have any news source on why all the travel sector is down today while the market is up big ???Something useful please no high debt or Covid garbage talk

This stock is not going above 30+ in next few years and in the meantime inflation will eat all your money invested here ;)
Cruise stocks are being held down by MM. Once their greedy little grips can no longer hold on cruise stocks will easily surpass pre-pandemic levels. Don't be the one who says I should have bought that stock in the 20's. :)

Sold my position some weeks ago for a nice profit. Re-opened position this morning.
"What is the real reason for this decline? Is it because we are on the first trading day of the month, for example?"
One of the reasons why we struggling is carnival cancellations for some of their sailing in January and February This has nothing to do with the pandemic it’s purely about miscalculated decisions just like their flip flap on protocols that changes weekly NCL continues to be the must efficient and safe cruise line out there “Full fleet strong by End of March”

Why are we moving up so nicely ? News ?? I’m grateful 
So many good news about Cruise lines. They are back! Stock price will soar in the next 2 weeks. Congrats long!!!!
At one point B is going to have to grow up and learn economics 101 that you cannot keep throwing money from the sky at people...... the key has always been for a capitalist economy for people to go to work... keep taxes low... and the economy WILL boom.... just like they were doing last year before b showed up.￼
For those of you who don't watch any conservative news like Newsmax or Tucker or listen to a.m. 790 you ...really have no idea the state this country is in right now and it's bad.... B has pretty much ruined every positive thing that T built ...having said that we will recover in cruising ...it's just going to take longer than it should have.￼￼Elections have consequences and it's so important all you young people educate yourselves and stop listening to the main stream media￼

My travel agent waited 4 hours on the phone to contact celebrity. I waited over an hour just to confirm my cruise for January. My call finally rolled over to a National account manager who could only promise me a call back by an agent. 2022 and 2023 are looking great for cruises.
Whats up with volume pattern? Look at 5 day and 1 month. Why is it so clockwork with spikes in volume?
Anytime you have people ..grown #$%$ men dressing up to look like a vaccine needle you know the governments up to no good?

Sorry guys I promised we close above $26 I was just one day late $28+ by next Friday the 1st of October Do your part a hold on to ur shares It’s not an easy ride but it will be great in the end !

Those who are still talking about covid now covid is behind us and life is back to before the pandemic let's enjoy the cruises
If memory serves; when Norwegian last raised funds - bond issue or equity issue i cant remember- they were they were anticipating return to full Sailings by October 2021. Do you think they will need to raise equity or debt in the next 6-12 months?

This user in a heartbeat will go from acting like a short player with some of hi aliases to a long with the other half and play both sides.He has admitted on the CCL board that he has no skin in the game with CCL.He is very well known on the CCL board with 73 different usernames. Approximately 95% of all posts on the CCL board including replies to messages, thumbs up or down are all his. You will also notice all conversations he has are with himself and all his alias’s.If he does not post on the CCL board, there is literally no action on that board by legit users. He has chased them all away.He has also over the last 18 months especially the first 8-12 months of the COVID crash stolen identities from people by copying their profile images and using their names and posting messages that were negative, derogatory, inflammatory, sexual, hateful, and just about anything you can think of.There is plenty of proof submitted to verify all this. (He does delete quite a bit of his messages) however, the are saved.Just to give you heads up here are just a short list of the usernames he uses if you have seen them on your message boards:Please keep in mind that this guy deletes messages all the time but please check out your board and especially the CCL board to see what I am talking about.Chart MasterJeffIssayStacy Gap Tooth AbramsIce EhBillRobertKeithZWolf Of Wall StreetWin Or LoseDavidHabibAllenCarn-Evil C.LShowtimePrincess CaysGeorgeKevinAnd many many more.Please take it for what it is worth……… NOTHING, it is all fake."

Close $27 today. Next week $29
golden cross ~ in a month. Q4 ripper.
Don't think we individual investors can be held under the thumb of the institutions any longer. The average Joe is going to want in on these stocks now. These manipulators won't be able to control the volume of people wanting in.
I never sell this until I get $200.It has been in possession for 18 months.It will cost $200 in the next 40 months.A tremendous cruise boom has begun.Reservations are currently exploding and are scheduled to be approved in December.The game is over.

It's like I've tried to say to all of you... if you really want to know what's going on with the cruise lines you have to have a broad understanding of what's going on in the country... but nobody seems to want to listen to that information so lets just all say ...it's going to go up one day￼...!What the B administration is doing has consequences and you're seeing it ....so understand what's going on around you and you'll better understand where the stock is going￼.Ultimately it will prevail.. it's just gonna take longer because of the people that are currently in office that are clueless about what to do and how to run a country￼

"The pricing here baffles me. Covid rates are down and vaccination rates are up. The company will have 75% of its ships sailing and generating revenue by the end of this year and the entire fleet in operation by April 2022. For the ships that have sailed so far, onboard spending is up and guest satisfaction scores are very high. Demand for cruises in 2022 and beyond is thru the roof and so are prices.

I keep telling you guys Norwegian is different their ships are spread out right were there is demand Right now there is more demand in Europe than North America and that’s why their last too ships were released to sail thereHigh $30s by year end and $50+ January 2023 if we can break out of the shadow of RCL and CCL

I am bearish on Norwegian. Debt and dwindling cash to start the redeployment of shops is the reason. This company should issue someStock ASAP as they will be out of cash by June/July of 2022 is they plan to sail all ships by april (doubtful to me). Good luck all
this stock always disappoints 
"As long as SEC does not regulate pullbacks upon manipulated news and timing by those robbers, those robbers will just continue doing the only thing they know how; robbing!!!This so called market is the king of Ponzi scheme and a criminal enterprise."
$31 fills a pretty big gap.
Booking is good and people are ready to sail. The biggest issue I see digging into the companies profits is higher labor and fuel. Thanks JOE B.
When do you guys think the US will release some of the oil reserves to stabilise the oil prices My guess is right before the midterm elections!!!!
*Full fleet by end of March *Spending on board at all time high (that’s where they make the big $$$$)*Demand and plans on track Why are we still under $30 people?
"love the CCL CEO positive comments right now. seeing great bookings, and no covid delta issues. paraphrased. skate to where the puck is going."
"Listening to NCLH’s President and CEO Frank Del Rio yesterday on Yahoo Finance, he provided what I consider really good pieces of information. First, he confirmed what I think most investors here already knew - that cruise bookings are at historical levels. More specifically, he said the company is 9-10 weeks ahead of where they normally are at this point for reservations for the following year and at higher price levels. He also reminded us that NCLH had been the best performing cruise company in terms of yields, IBIDA, gross margins and ROIC and he said the company hasn’t forgotten how to run a cruise line. Del Rio also said that the back half of 2022 is shaping up to be the best and most profitable back half the company has ever had. And with 74 new health and safety protocols including air filtration systems that now rival those in hospitals and a 100% vaccination policy for both passengers and crew, I like the prospect of the company hitting this target."
Does anyone really think we will get over 40 within 3 years?
"So, I called the short yesterday, and people dusagreed with me vigorously. Hate to say I told you so, but... Wait. I'm not sorry. I'm making bank today, if you listened to me, you would be too. Sad"
It’s all down hill since 30.00 . Sorry but the Bears are here to stay
"This stock was up to $33.71 in early June 2021 before the Delta variant spooked the market and the stock sold off. But Covid cases are down 40% in the last month, vaccination rates are up, there are more Norwegian ships sailing and revenue is way up. This is a no brainer folks!"
Well you don't have to look far to know where the problem is in this country.....b￼
Shall we go to the 29$ again?
I urge all of you to take a moment of silence and thoughtfulness for all of those that lost their lives and/or were impacted on 9-11.Not to be political at this moment but the B administration just gave over $80 billion worth of American top-notch military equipment to the exact people that are responsible for this horrific attack on America.￼￼
Google these two REAL EXPERTS! They have no political agenda! You’ll finally hear the truth about Covid!Dr Harvey Risch Harvard EpidemiologistDr Peter McCulloughInternist If you have had Covid then you only have downside to being vaccinated!Children should NOT be vaxed!
There is a rumour that Norwegian Cruise Line are building a new cruise ship that can go to the moon. Just sharing a little inside info…
Norwegian is under investigation. Let the sell off commence...
We really need an upgrade from one of the heavy weights banks or investment firms to trigger a shot squeeze
looking like 30+ next week

"5, 20, 50, 100 and 200 day moving averages are now all GREEN!"
Unless you people do your research on conservative websites or radio stations you are not going to understand what's going on around you ....even with Southwest airlines the Dow Jones report on Yahoo lied... they blamed the thousands of cancellations on Weather when in fact it's thousands of pilots that are walking off the job rather than being forced to get vaccinated.￼
"I don’t care you’re swingtrader or daytrader, shorting cruise lines stock is not so smart"
tomorrow $28 buy buy...
"See Norwegian offering cruises for 30% off, free airfare for two, free open bars for all drinks. Bookings must be a whole lot less robust than Norwegian is letting on."
The goal this week is to maintain $28+Hitting $29 or $30 is great but let’s not get our hopes up too much !The shorts and weak hands will drag this down Do ur part and hold on to ur shares … great days ahead
"Remember the nice high, recovering prices in June? There is no difference between now and the beginning of June except 1.) ships are sailing more now and 2.) delta is temporarily here more. Not even gas for travel expenses are any higher now. I want to stress that the peak and decline of delta is not priced into these travel stocks (a misunderstanding of strain nature is [mis]priced in). Not even the slightest hope of what scientists are saying about delta's finite reign is priced in. I've said this before but it seems like travel stocks are inversely glued to covid numbers - PRESENT covid numbers, not what scientists and computer models say future covid numbers will be. Beyond delta, some cruise companies have reported record bookings since June. We've progressed further towards many companies' expected 80% ship fleet return, since June. Norwegian announced expectations to be cash flow positive by the end of 2021, and Royal by early 2022. Around 170 ships, counting all cruise companies, should be sailing by October. All of this optimism we're only closer to since June. And finally (it feels like a sin to mention this), delta has NOT obliterated consumer confidence like the travel stock prices say. People are cruising during this temporary delta, and the few cancellations will be re-booked when delta ends."
"These are buying opportunities here.Also it's interesting to note in multiple polls now that B is now exposed for his feckless policies .. The handling of these mandates the Afghanistan debacle and our economy....￼were over 85% of America now agrees that NO ONE should have to lose their jobs by refusing to take a vaccine that they don't agree with.... that includes the majority of Asians whites, blacks and Hispanics and it's also interesting to note that the overwhelming majority of the people in the Democrat party that think they should lose their jobs are people over 65 years old who no longer are working and are on Social Security.￼.

"Time to sell-definitely a dead cat bounce before inflation numbers tomorrow, followed by the fed being forced to stop buy backs on September 22nd. Interest rates are going to soar! Not a good time to own any companies with high debt!"
"it's way too early to take profits, they will be sorry they did.. on to 33+ this week"
All b had to do was NOTHING and we'd already be at 60/share.
"If the insiders are selling, something is wrong with the company"
"Las Vegas allowed casinos to reopen in June 2020. A month later, Bloomberg reported that revenues were down almost half from the previous year and at the time people thought the sky was falling. But it wasn’t because over the course of the next year, casino revenue and casino stock values simply took off and now Las Vegas casinos are posting month after month record revenues and stock prices are at record highs. With cruise bookings at record levels and Del Rio’s recent statement that the 2nd half of 2022 could be the best half the company has ever had, I think the cruise industry and NCLH will have the same experience as the Las Vegas casinos."
I have owned Norwegian stocks for 19 months.I will have it for the next 39 months.Because Norway will go up to $200.
Carnival reports tomorrow…. Record beating reservations and gonna beat on both top and bottom…. Strap yourself in
$285m per month in cash costs. $2.8b cash in the bank. $12b in debt. Looks like about 10-13 months of operating cash at current levels. Jan 2023 put options look enticing.
Manchin and Senema had better hold their ground or we are all screwed....And FB needs to be shut down.And Just give cruising time. WILL recover

"How could any humans screw up the amazing economy we had just 10 months ago..... All b had to do was sit back and take a vacation and enjoy what T built....but instead b purposely destroys this economy, single-handedly has wiped out all the positive things we had going in this country, opened our borders wide open to further damage America. Gas prices at near all time highs when just eight months ago it was a dollar something a gallon.￼And you people wonder why it's taking cruising so long to recover while Lord fauzi sets on his throne and tries to ruin Christmas again￼￼"
Well it started ....Vermont allowing non-citizens to vote ...these Democrats are going to destroy this country￼. It's their plan... and any of you that don't understand the reason these borders are open has your head in the sand￼
Travel convention show in Dallas last week was awesome...travel is back...
We will close above $25.30 today If not green!!!
"Sinan is right, he closed above 25"
Not Sure if the Florida state Attorneys appealing the judges decision on the vaccine mandate that was won by NCL has something to do with the price drop todayIf so it will be a very short lived drop because so many businesses including the federal government have followed NCL on the vaccine mandate now and in so many other states as well….So it’s gonna be almost impossible to overturn the judge’s decision The Attorneys want the judge to limit businesses to mandate/ask for a vaccine but can’t ask consumers for a proof I mean come on Florida even during Jesus’s time people weren’t that honest 
When is CCl earning?
"Pfizer and BioNTech ask the FDA to approve shots for younger kidsYesterday Pfizer-BioNTech asked the FDA to issue an emergency use authorization for its vaccine in kids ages 5 to 11. The drugmakers are submitting relevant data, including information on how it will formulate the two pediatric doses, which are each one-third of those given to adults. The agency is tentatively scheduled to discuss this in an October 26 meeting, and a CDC advisory panel meeting has been scheduled for November 2 and 3, which means shots for children in this age group could be available shortly after that. Many parents are eager to get their kids vaccinated and experts have said that inoculating younger Americans is a key step in ending this pandemic."
"I just did a 7 day cruise to Alaska with nclh, they gave me balcony suite, premium drink package ($69 pp)taxes and gratiuites included.$100 a day Ship was only 1/4 fullHad a great time"
"Really BS that these cruise companies pay the help onboard about $2.00/hour, not subject to US labor laws and pay basically nothing in US Corporate taxes."
In two weeks or less it will turn for the better. I say this based on CDC showing at increased vaccination trend and projecting a downward trend in COVID cases. The only hiccup may be a short (two week) spike associated with Labor gathering. Similar to what was seen a Christmas. Good Luck all.
"If we close above $26 today, this thing will rock to $29 next week"
"The price cannot rise due to the prior pricing of investors to reduce the purchase of assets next month, probably in addition to inflation and stagflation, which frightens investors and makes them reluctant to buy and pump money, this is what I think"
"don't believe this bs in the news today. seriously. those behind these planted directional stories in the complicit media are designed to cause volatility to take your shares. hi freq algos profit more on seesaw action. timing of these article flows really align with technicals too. NCLH runs up to the 50 DMA, and shocker, some directionally transparent story hits about delta and the tourism, forcing weak hands out before the 3 day weekend. classic retail goon. generally speaking, covid delta outbreaks in the hotbed US states are on the decline. Data sets are following the same patterns seen in all the places that got outbreaks (UK, France, India, Spain, etc.) before the US hot spots did. see NY Times story this am. all sorts of data in there - plain as day. Politics-first desantis clearly making it worse for FL spread/peak, but regardless, these viral outbreaks follow a pattern, bad policies just made the peak higher than it would have in a more sensible approach."
Man ohh Man Lots of weak hands profit takers out there !!!!!
"Entire market down, not only NCLH.I love shorties John, Mike Wallace, Max"

So many bashers on this board!!What did this company do to you ?Prior to Covid this was one of the elite preforming companies You made your money from $60 to $10 Let the longs enjoy the rebound back to $60
"COVID cases fall by 25%, fueling hope that Delta has peaked"
"I have to hand it to them, just got a 98 page full color brochure from Oceania for 2023 cruises. The brochure is incredible and must cost a fortune. Saw some that we really liked in August 2023 and will see what kind of deposit they want on a $22,000-$25,000 trip. Even my wife fell for a couple of choices. Crazy because it's a little less than 2 years from now! I'll be speaking with my advisor there."
"So now the department of justice under B is going to Weaponized the FBI to go after parents that are voicing their opinions about how upset they are over the school board policies and how they corrupting our children.￼Imagine how Cruising is going to be if they tell you exactly what you're going to do while you're cruising￼. Oh wait, they're already doing some of that￼. Humm"
"CCL, RCL and NCLH have been trading in lockstep, but they really shouldn’t be. There are a variety of reasons for this but for the purposes of this, I will focus on one. NCLH’s 100% vaccination policy for staff and passengers is, while distasteful for anti-vaxers and the hardcore freedom folks, is where the industry is going and NCLH is simply just ahead of it’s competition in this process. Under normal circumstances, the market would reward leaders like NCLH but that hasn’t happened at this point but that’s not to say it won’t happen as things evolve moving forward and this may provide a tremendous opportunity for investors."
"Not as high as others because people are taking profits this is good solid hold and more will be buying, technicals suggest $35-$37 so still money to make"
It will definitely rise to $30 in two or three days or after a week or even two weeks at the most
"12% are short.. We'll, they better start covering unless they want to loss another 15% in 5 days like last week... $100/share soon.. Go longs..."
"Nabeel If a 100 or 1000 individuals thinks like you, freak out and sell every time this thing drops a dollar we will never get back to $35 or $40Come on man…hold ur ground"
Question: when people say “record bookings”…what specifically do they mean? Do cruise lines have a record backlog of passengers? Are ships sailing at “record” capacity (+99% full)? Ate companies seeing a record number of bookings per week? Just curious what the specifics of these record bookings actually mean. Thanks
Ruh roh. Debt and reality catching up?
Yesterday the Norwegian Gem returned from a 7 day cruise reporting ZERO Covid cases. The ship left from and returned to Covid ravaged Florida. The defence rests.
Okay We are all tired of the $23-26 game …been playing it for a while and it’s kinda boring now For the next 2 weeks let’s play a new game called $26-30
"A tidbit on fuel cost: How much does it cost to fuel a cruise ship? A smaller-sized cruise ship like the Norwegian Spirit costs about $80,000 per day on fuel. A larger cruise ship like Freedom of the Seas can cost up to $2 million per day to fuel. "
