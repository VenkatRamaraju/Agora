"While other cruise companies are making changes and introducing new measures to try and keep covid and the delta variant off their ships, Norwegian hasn’t implemented any new measures. More specifically, NCLH requires no masks onboard, there is no social distancing, there are no capacity limitations, there are no restrictions on shore excursions and all experiences restaurants, activities and experiences are open."
It’s gonna pop and close today at $28. Mark my word
Buy /Buy/Buy -Now and think later - This will sky rocket Just Like AMC Stock from no where .This will be over 45 by end of December 2021
This recommendation by the CDC is giving two very bad messages to the public 1. It’s undermining any good the vaccine has done to so many people preventing them from getting severely ill including high risk individuals And discouraging unvaccinated from getting theirs2. Putting all cruise companies on the same level regardless of their preferences and results Norwegian had zero cases on their ships thus far why they get included in this warning The cdc should have recognised NCL for a job well done instead This is beyond Frustrating
This NCLH stock can only go up and up next stop $28 then $32 in 3 weeks
Yesterday the Norwegian Gem returned from a 7 day cruise reporting ZERO Covid cases. The ship left from and returned to Covid ravaged Florida. The defence rests.
Per 6/30/21 statement: $2.7 billion in cash vs $2.2 billion current liabilities and 400 million shares outstanding with a book value of $7.75/share. Losses of $200 million a month.What should this stock sell for?
NCLH has woken up from a long sleep. Time to squeeze the shorts.
So many good news about Cruise lines. They are back! Stock price will soar in the next 2 weeks. Congrats long!!!!

"Remember the nice high, recovering prices in June? There is no difference between now and the beginning of June except 1.) ships are sailing more now and 2.) delta is temporarily here more. Not even gas for travel expenses are any higher now. I want to stress that the peak and decline of delta is not priced into these travel stocks (a misunderstanding of strain nature is [mis]priced in). Not even the slightest hope of what scientists are saying about delta's finite reign is priced in. I've said this before but it seems like travel stocks are inversely glued to covid numbers - PRESENT covid numbers, not what scientists and computer models say future covid numbers will be. Beyond delta, some cruise companies have reported record bookings since June. We've progressed further towards many companies' expected 80% ship fleet return, since June. Norwegian announced expectations to be cash flow positive by the end of 2021, and Royal by early 2022. Around 170 ships, counting all cruise companies, should be sailing by October. All of this optimism we're only closer to since June. And finally (it feels like a sin to mention this), delta has NOT obliterated consumer confidence like the travel stock prices say. People are cruising during this temporary delta, and the few cancellations will be re-booked when delta ends."
Delta Air Lines is raising health insurance premiums for unvaccinated employees by $200 a month to cover higher Covid costsEnjoy your freedom Morans
"If we close above $26 today, this thing will rock to $29 next week"
Oceania Cruises (owned by NCLH) finally hitting the open seas again ....Nice
"It seems the confirmed case reaches to peak level in US, will be showing the downturn soon and following fear of the delta will be diminishing and will boost the SP along with high demand of curise travel! I also check the India confirmed cases to see the trend of delta and it is clearly showing delta is just another disturbance similar to other variants, be calm and wait for being wealthier"
"Listening to NCLH’s President and CEO Frank Del Rio yesterday on Yahoo Finance, he provided what I consider really good pieces of information. First, he confirmed what I think most investors here already knew - that cruise bookings are at historical levels. More specifically, he said the company is 9-10 weeks ahead of where they normally are at this point for reservations for the following year and at higher price levels. He also reminded us that NCLH had been the best performing cruise company in terms of yields, IBIDA, gross margins and ROIC and he said the company hasn’t forgotten how to run a cruise line. Del Rio also said that the back half of 2022 is shaping up to be the best and most profitable back half the company has ever had. And with 74 new health and safety protocols including air filtration systems that now rival those in hospitals and a 100% vaccination policy for both passengers and crew, I like the prospect of the company hitting this target."
CDC at it again. Walenski simply will not stop her covid fear mongering. She has got to go.

Easy double. Mery Christmas
So the unfortunate death of the 77 years old lady on the Carnival Vista was reported last week Why all of the sudden they are making a big deal about it now Norwegian is the company to count on when it comes to health and safety They have proven themselves with zero issues on all of their voyages I said it before it’s not about how many ships you put on the water the fastest But how safe and profitable each of ur ships will be when it sails again and that’s exactly what Norwegian is doing..When they mandated the vaccine passport everyone Crucified them but now all the other companies are following their lead Frank Del Rio you have my respect…you sure know how to run a cruise ship company the right wayI really hope analysts will notice the difference and separate these companies and value them based on preference not as sector in general
In two weeks or less it will turn for the better. I say this based on CDC showing at increased vaccination trend and projecting a downward trend in COVID cases. The only hiccup may be a short (two week) spike associated with Labor gathering. Similar to what was seen a Christmas. Good Luck all.
28 or 29 next week
"back to 33 for nclh, and then to new highs"
Remember 2022 is predicted to be busiest cruise year on record.
"There are 66 cruise ships sailing at this time. Of these 66 ships, there are 19 ships that have reported covid cases and met the threshold for CDC investigation. At this time, Norwegian has 6 ships sailing but have not reported covid cases that have met the threshold for investigation by the CDC. Small sample size but very encouraging in terms of NCLH’s new health and safety protocols and it’s 100% vaccinated passengers and crew policy."
Okay We are all tired of the $23-26 game …been playing it for a while and it’s kinda boring now For the next 2 weeks let’s play a new game called $26-30
"CCL, RCL and NCLH have been trading in lockstep, but they really shouldn’t be. There are a variety of reasons for this but for the purposes of this, I will focus on one. NCLH’s 100% vaccination policy for staff and passengers is, while distasteful for anti-vaxers and the hardcore freedom folks, is where the industry is going and NCLH is simply just ahead of it’s competition in this process. Under normal circumstances, the market would reward leaders like NCLH but that hasn’t happened at this point but that’s not to say it won’t happen as things evolve moving forward and this may provide a tremendous opportunity for investors."
Adding shares the past few weeks. Most of money tied up in online sports gambling stocks for quick gains. But do expect $40 a share by April next year. Just a matter of buying the dips.
Just read 27 people tested positive on Carnival Vista's Aug 7th sailing and all were fully vaccinated. My friend and her husband got covid after attending a wedding in New York and they too were fully vaccinated. She told me it was like having a real bad sinus infection for 5 days. Obviously the vaccines aren't foolproof against the newer variants. Living in this covid world is the new normal.
With the new emergency vaccine rules by the Bahamas Ronny boy should drop the appeal on judge Williams ruling …the majority of the ships that embark from Florida go to the Bahamas or the cruise lines private islands No Jabb no cruise
"Should’ve been $35 by now, let’s roll"
Buy this dip
I dont care what this stock does over the next day or month but for those willing to hold this for the next couple of years will see tremendous gains.
Im glad we are somewhat stable here. B is hindering our progress as well as getting people killed. He's a train wreck on steroids and Harris is worse.Problem is when she takes over she has the right to pick her own VP ...God forbid she picks Hillary￼
"I do not understand what is going on, at least the price should be at 26 dollars now, due to the return of sailing again and in the safest way among all companies, I do not find a justification for the price drop."
"Alright, who's ready for some shorts covering this week. Push that price up shorts."
$26. Next boom is at $27.34. Then we go quickly to the 30s.
$35 in 3 weeks
"It's a pandemic with 100k+ in USA hospitals now, and growing. Serious question: You want to own a stake in a broke cruise ship company?"
Trashes like NCLH crash and good stocks like AMC go up 20%+ <3
