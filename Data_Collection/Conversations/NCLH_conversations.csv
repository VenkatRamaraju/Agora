The CEO of this company is a wanna-be authoritarian. That is all.
"Hey Yahoo: I don't want to come here to read some BS and lies about vaccines when I am on the NCLH board. I thought you guys reviewed these before they are posted. Can we please stop with the vaccine misinformation, thanks"
"Many cruise staff and airline flight attendants have not been vaccinated. Friend works for Delta (no pun intended) and the spread the virus all over US a and Europe. She just didn’t give a hoot. I gently refused to see her at her big Easter party with 10 guests from 5 households. This was months ago. Now look,"
wait for pull back a little more or buy now?
One COVID case on their special vaccinated cruise and this drops to 15. Sell now

"Is it possible to reach $30 soon, experts?"
"I have voted repub pretty much straight line for for approx 30 years. but with this desantis , hoaxers, and anti vaccinators drama, I will most likely vote the other way this next time really been let down. desantis is for freedom unless he doesn't personally agree of for political points. it pains me as probably will pay more taxes but what has become of the repub party is grotesquely distasteful.. and by the way I am for more border control - always here that."
"I will be honest with you all, I have been buying every month in the last year and a half. That said I am IN,.. and the price is dropping a lot, each day,.. day after day. and,.. day after day, I am happier and happier! It is because I have been reading about the company, I am following the financial reports and the market. Also, I am working in cruisers ships design and we are loaded as never before. Cruisers are being built as before corona. This panic is a gift from all of you to me, as I can see it. I would like to use this opportunity to ask you if you can sell even more of your shares, I would like to buy them for an even better price. (Trying to low my average even more ;) )"
"Alright, who's ready for some shorts covering this week. Push that price up shorts."
All cruise lines will benefit once we get off the fear factor of the Chinese virus! Those of us who have been tested and have natural immunity are far safer to be around than those who have been vaxxed!https://www.brighteon.com/0b936426-eaa2-4e9d-8e21-e73f5dfa09b4
"The journey has begun, fasten your seat belts!"
"Norwegian cruise count per month to the end of 2021August ….3September …9October………..,,,13November…………,,,,,20December…………………….28"
And we are off to the races. Congrats longs. Lol shorts.
I went outside today for a few hours so I put on sunscreen but my friends didn’t use sunscreen so I got sunburned!! Are you seeing it yet? Don’t be sheep! FREEDOM!
Need a couple of upgrades and we will do alright. Time for this puppy to float higher
"Cruise ships have always been able to deny pax based on certain medical conditions. Pregnant past a certain point, can't go. Certain mobility issues, can't go. Need dialysis treatment, can't go. Blind, can't go (alone). And how is different than needing a Yellow fever Vaccine card (passport) when the ships travel to some foreign countries? Up until a few years ago you need a Yellow Fever Vaccine card to go to Brazil. So would that be ban by Florida too."
People are tired of the name of the virus even so no one cares about the virus at all and everyone wants to return to normal life no matter what
30 soon
Only moving off shore to a foreign Carribbean port can save it.
Trashes like NCLH crash and good stocks like AMC go up 20%+ <3
Can’t wait until my January cruise on NCL bliss!
There seems to be a thought that only the non vaccinated are against COVID passports . My entire family is vaccinated and we will not spend one dollar in any state or business that feels it their right to invade my privacy . After all I received the vaccine so I would not catch it . I did not get get it to make a statement to anyone or any business. There are a lot of vaccinated people who feel the same way. As I said before the ships that leave the Florida ports have mostly Floridians .I would not own this stock right now till these COVID strains slow down.
Bargain prices. I added yesterday and again today. Will be a great Christmas
"There is talk that vaccination will become mandatory in the United States one way or another, which means that two Norwegians are right from the start."
"Online travel agency Booking Holdings Inc said on Wednesday its quarterly revenue more than tripled and trounced estimates, driven by strong demand in Europe and the United States as more people planned their long-delayed getaways."
"The company won the case to request proof of the vaccine in Florida, and the company's procedures are strong and strict with regard to safety for customers. It needs news that the turnout and reservations are strong at the present time, then the price will rise four or five dollars at once"
My fault. I couldn’t wait to get in at $32. It’s dropped every day since. I’m the mosh! Help please get back in the $30s quick. I’m drowning and tapped out can’t buy anymore cheap. My cost per share is down to $29 at least. When can I look to make a profit?
It’s quiet time before earnings…. They will tell the story on the 8th
"Short it’s the way people I made 25,000 shorting"
Okay We are all tired of the $23-26 game …been playing it for a while and it’s kinda boring now For the next 2 weeks let’s play a new game called $26-30
Sailing . . . . .
Wish i had more money to buy more!! SMH
CDC at it again. Walenski simply will not stop her covid fear mongering. She has got to go.
What a sales pitch from Oceania--selling the meals you can have starting in 2023 on a new ship.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oceania-cruises-reveals-restaurants-culinary-130300261.html
Bought earlier @ 23.99 for Long Position. Morningstar is bullish and so am I. GLTA…
What is happening here? The stock is all over the place.
"With more than +200,000,000 Americans vaccinated, where do you think these folks are going to chose to vacation? If they chose to be vaccinated, they have already demonstrated that this is important to them so it wouldn’t be a huge leap to think that many of these same people may chose a vacation destination that has implemented a 100% vaccination requirement like a Norwegian cruise."
I think we all got in a little early. Our time is going to come.
I tried to book a cruise yesterday all booked tell January 2022
Delta Air Lines is raising health insurance premiums for unvaccinated employees by $200 a month to cover higher Covid costsEnjoy your freedom Morans
"Covid ain't goin' away, and a cruise ship is the perfect machine for covid spread. It's literally perfect. Lots of large group activities, heavy breathing and then riding of packed elevators. NCLH bankruptcy within 6 months to save their bondholders."
"cruise stocks down this morning, watch nclh go back to 30 next week"
T having rally in Alabama tonight..old and young alike...not a mask in sight. Don't you dem fear mongers just hate it 
Me holding the bag at 29 :(
"Don't be scared of delta variant, we statistically see that mortality rate with the variants is much lower as we have been vaccinated and government is under control with mandating vaccine injection as time goes on. Those who unvaccinated, they will be just eliminating by the natural selection. Just like in April, we will spot the peak at some point and less confirmed cases will be followed. Just seat tight and wait for a moment soon to come. And we will find a way we always have."
When it breaks that 27 dollar point and volume explodes I'm adding.
Should I buy nclh at this price?
"In your opinion, have the company's earnings results been priced based on Royal Caribbean's results, meaning that this is the end of the decline, or is there more decline coming in another way? Do you think this is the bottom?"
Increased my holdings on NCLH YETI and CIM earlier. GLTA…
what's the problem here?I genuinely don't understand..If Govt employers can mandate vaccine why not private companies like NCLH and send this stock price to moon?
Everybody all excited about 1 ship sailing that's maybe at 1/2 capacity. Meanwhile cash stacks continue to burn  No meaningful revenue & a stack of debt. why would I pay $26 a share for this? And yes 2 years from now could be better but I want my money to make money NOW .
Per CDC website The Norwegian Gem that left Miami last weekend for the Caribbean is still in green statue ( No Covid Cases on board) That’s a ship with thousands of passengers while we are in the peak of the Delta Covid outbreak with ZERO cases “THE SAFEST PLACE ON EARTH INDEED”
"The price rise an hour before the close of trading today makes you know that there is a strong rise that may happen very soon and it will be surprisingly, it is a war of feelings between fear and greed"
Florida granted full permission to sail from Florida! Watch out pre market this can insanely move up .. rip puts
I dont care what this stock does over the next day or month but for those willing to hold this for the next couple of years will see tremendous gains.

"Thank you Senan for posting about the “Cruise ship color status￼” on the CDC website. Especially interesting for me as I have a cruise coming up in 5 months￼.I reiterate that it is incredibly creepy that the CDC is stalking cruise ships. They aren’t tracking stadiums, gyms, concert halls, malls, churches, dept.stores, jails, nor other places where people congregate en masse… ONLY cruises are their prey. It’s very violating. I can’t believe the cruise industry rolled over, when they aren’t even US corporations. NO other industry is expected to have ZERO transmissions in their building as a condition for being allowed to run!"
start party let's go 
"Remember the nice high, recovering prices in June? There is no difference between now and the beginning of June except 1.) ships are sailing more now and 2.) delta is temporarily here more. Not even gas for travel expenses are any higher now. I want to stress that the peak and decline of delta is not priced into these travel stocks (a misunderstanding of strain nature is [mis]priced in). Not even the slightest hope of what scientists are saying about delta's finite reign is priced in. I've said this before but it seems like travel stocks are inversely glued to covid numbers - PRESENT covid numbers, not what scientists and computer models say future covid numbers will be. Beyond delta, some cruise companies have reported record bookings since June. We've progressed further towards many companies' expected 80% ship fleet return, since June. Norwegian announced expectations to be cash flow positive by the end of 2021, and Royal by early 2022. Around 170 ships, counting all cruise companies, should be sailing by October. All of this optimism we're only closer to since June. And finally (it feels like a sin to mention this), delta has NOT obliterated consumer confidence like the travel stock prices say. People are cruising during this temporary delta, and the few cancellations will be re-booked when delta ends."
"Everything is fine, the important thing is that the Fed does not announce the start of reducing bond purchases early and announces that it will not rush to do so before making sure that the economy is recovering well, then the price will rise in an excellent manner"
Next week $30 them $45
"If you look at the chart on this since Feb this up down cycle has happened 4 times. This price point has been a further drop, but we should be at or very near the bottom. It always appears the climb back up to 30+ will happen quick. Great entry point today to start accumulating if you can or buy some cheap options for September."
Everyone ready for a surprise week? Zacks $30.40 PT is too conservative. Way oversold with RSI in the 30s. This will rip…hard.
"so are we going to back to ""2 weeks to flatten the curve?"" lol. Dems are playing everyone for a fiddle. 100,000 people/day at Lollapalooza was ok but going on a cruise with a few thousand is not safe."
Only now I am sure that there is a dirty conspiracy against the company from several sides and market manipulators are leading it
All the unvaccinated who are now getting covid will not be getting the vaccine because their immune will be better then the vaccine .Companies mandating vaccines are on the wrong boat and their business will sink
Monday next week the CDC and the state meet again to come up with narrower guidelines. The current guidelines will just be recommendations. Could this large dip going on with all cruise lines I’ll be manipulation before Monday?
"Is it still normal to reach $30 soon, experts?"
"go to $19 as new COVID numbers cause cancels. Also the news yesterday that proof of vaccination s required will scare the numbers of those without vaccines away. There's lots of people who still refuse to get vaccine and like to travel, and they wont be allowed. So cruises and airlines will fall this Fall."
On 2/25 I bought NCLH at 28.75 and I sold on May 28th at 32.04. I’m going to do the same thing all over again.
 today
Holding 3k shares 
Yahoo just keeps deleting ANY negative information about B. Keep Showing your colors yahoo..
$27 unrealistic price target for tomorrow? Please give me some real information
"The rise will not happen by day and night, and this is normal. A new base will be formed at the current price for a day or two, and then the rise will start again"
Here is the truth about cruise line stocks:1) They are cheap right now2) They will go back up when they start cruising again3) They will eventually start cruising againEverything else is just noise
Delta has peaked.
I still believe this is nothing higher than a $15 stock right now with future earnings keeping it up. More people are cxl right now because of scare of delta. Travel is lower. Imho future expectations are now down on this stock. I’ll buy again @$15
Breaking news! Court votes to stay judge’s decision about CDC cruise ship rules This is a boost for NCLH Florida has no option now NCLH will win the case. Expect a big gap up tomorrow.
Next time the manipulators want to run the stock down 30% can they give us a heads up? I have more than realized how this market get moved around by the big wigs this last 3 months.
"Two days down, it's time to correct or what?"
Is it time to go back to $30 already??
Nclh will only allow vaccinated individuals... Fighting with its primary host in FL... Alienated non vaxxers and vaxxers with kids alike... Lost 2 key board members this week (likely over disagreements)... Why would I choose this company over royal? Del Rio has lost it. Company reaches with fluff news every day. Drop anchor
"Per CDC website Royal has 9 ships with Covid cases Carnival also has 9 ships with Covid cases NORWEGIAN HAS NO COVID ON ANY OF THEIR SHIPS CEO Del Rio is such a bad bad person for keeping his ships,passengers and Crew safe,healthy and Covid free !!I guess we live in a new world where doing the right thing is a crime"
"Everywhere in the world is forced to move on with vacc roll-out. Love it or not, Lockdown is no longer an option as a the economic can no longer support. Old who refused to vacc is considered minority still, just ask urself - what is ur #1 wish list upon reopening? Rebound of Cruise lines and airlines has JUST started. Sit back.."
Just went under 25. Could not have happen to a nicer Ceo (Do not tread on our Freedoms)
"I'm not confident the price will end up higher tomorrow. The fear about the delta variant is more pervasive than facts. Best possible news is (1) earnings sucked about as much as you thought (2) the company is largely booked for 2022 sailings , more than history would have predicted (3) they are getting price improvement in future bookings. All that good news has to overcome nobody knowing if they will sail in Florida soon. I don't think we will see a positive announcement there. I think this stock trades in the 18-26 range for the next 40 days. I am long here with over 70,000 shares. I think the stock hits a peak of 35-40 and trades sideway and down through an overall market correction and won't see 50 for several years due to dilution / debt and stimulus spending affecting equities. I think this is a better place to have my money than Tesla (love the Company hate the stock) over the next 24 months. Same goes for Apple, but I'd be long ago retired if I never sold Apple."
"Friendly reminder for shorties, buy and cover now before it’s too late"
"$25/ shares? NCLH is a gift of a lifetime. You don’t need to invest anywhere else, buy and thank me later"
"When are people going to realize that these ‘variants’ are just that, ‘variants’ of the same virus, that the vaccine has proven effective against again and again. Everything else is just fear mongering by the media and parties who seek to benefit from the public’s fear (CDC, etc.)"
I had a cruise booked for JAN and just canceled. If I test #$%$ during it they kick me off and ruins my vacation. Yes I'm vaccinated.
"When i see to many shorts on stock, i know is time to buy more.Lets burn this shorts and go higher. NCLH is going much higher ."
Why would NCLH be a strong buy on Yahoo Finance with a 15% of shares short?
I love this company longggg term but it's going to take a decade to repair this ship (pun intended). Nclh market cap is only 10% below where it was prior to covid and now has $15 bil debt on balance sheet... Best case return to semi- normal ops next spring... Where does that leave this company? If the boat assets are overstated ouch. Hit the deck
"The real problem in the market is the inflation rates. Re-pricing is now done on all shares in the market. When this is finished, prices will gradually rise again, but it is not clear if the re-pricing has ended or there is still more in the next week, which means more decline and correction. This is just Personal analysis, I could be wrong"
"The rule says when everyone is afraid, it is the right time to buy, because the rise when it happens will not give an opportunity to those who are afraid to enter, because the rise will be very fast. I am waiting for it"
NCLH = UP day today
NCLH to announce they are working on refinancing some of their highest rate notes similar to Carnival.This will surely help us all out. Looking for $30 to show its head in the next few weeks again.
"Like it or not and regardless of the share performance Norwegian has done an excellent Job coming back to service with their 3 ships in operation No hick ups or delays ….No passengers being kicked off or left behind….No protocol flip flops…. No cancellations…..No outbreaks…No passenger Discrimination on board because of vaccine status like CCL,RCL..Not to mention being able to take more passengers on the ship because they all vaccinated and that equals more revenue from tickets and spending on board"
"Delta is speeding up people to take vaccinations and vaccinated people are just waiting to get onto board with cruises ,  boom us coming"
"Funny thing. I live in a country called Jordan. Did you know that Jordan has returned to normal life completely now, and tourism has returned to normal as it was before the epidemic, and all this thanks to the Pfizer vaccines that were given to us by the United States, which is now suffering from the spread of the mutated mutated? Really funny thing that the states are supposed to be The United States today has been living a normal life for months, so I can't believe that Delta is hindering normal life in a country like the United States"
Remember 2022 is predicted to be busiest cruise year on record.
Conservative Supreme Court will rule in favor of business resuming. Rockets are fueling up for our ride to the moon!
"Norwegian is now mandating vaccine passports, effectively preventing 100-million Americans from being able to take a cruise. So, good luck!"
"Yahoo News: ""Does NCLH Extension of 100% Vaccine Status make the stock a buy right now?""Answer: NO. It doesn't. I said this the day they won their lawsuit and mandated the jabs. There are 100-million people in this country who have refused the vaccine, and those people want to go on vacation. NCLH basically said, ""don't come here, don't spend your money with us, we don't want you."" WORST business decision EVER. Not even the Airlines were that dumb to stop taking money from 100-million potential customers."
"""With such extraordinary demand for travel in 2022, we are pleased to be able to offer our discerning travelers these additional travel options in these most sought-after destinations,"" stated Bob Binder , President and CEO of Oceania Cruises . ""With record-setting demand for international travel in the coming year, we are committed to providing our guests with more destination options and our travel advisor partners with even more sales opportunities,"" added Binder.umm, seems like the website is crashing. now that's what I call demand!"
Buy buy buy. Great news. We are sailing again and are having a wonderful time. Freedom!
$26. Next boom is at $27.34. Then we go quickly to the 30s.
"Such an interesting saga. Quite a soap opera. Overall, they owe it to the current bondholders to file bankruptcy, pay off the bonds, and restructure. This won't end well: ""Norwegian Cruise Line decided earlier this summer that a return to sailing as COVID-19 cases were starting to spike again could only be achieved safely if 100% of its crew and passengers are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus""...but ""Florida Governor Ron DeSantis pushed out a new law that allows the state to fine businesses $5,000 for every instance where a customer is required to provide vaccination records."""
"I do not understand. Is this really all because of the fear of Delta? I live in the Middle East and in a third world country. Life is normal here. Tourism is back in strength and everything is fine. There are cases of Delta, but life is normal and everything is under control and people live their lives normally. What is going on? Here I can not understand"
$24 close?
This is a $15 stock at best right now. No real revenue for over a year. COVID not controlled. Other cruise companies with outbreaks. It will eventually rise but not now. $22 way to high
CDC get in touch with reality and stop making some garbage rules and recommendations How is it unsafe to be on a Norwegian cruise ship with 100% vaccinated passengers and crew …being tested daily with fully equipped clinic on board and a chopper ready to take you to the nearest hospital in case somehow you got severely ill But being stocked up like sardines on a plane is totally safe according to the CDC
What the frak is going on

"Congratulations, to us diamond hands that didn't sell into weakness yesterday due to some trumped up fear tactics by the main stream media."
"Ascending triangle shape is showing up in the chart, will be bullish around early September!"
Bought some call options for end of summer. Hopefully I’ll be able to exercise them. The market has been punishing the travel sector a little too much
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Fairstox.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
"CDC says mask rules will apply to Florida cruise ships not following sail orderFri, July 23, 2021, 7:21 PM·1 min readWASHINGTON, July 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said late Friday that it will enforce its transit mask requirements on cruise ships in Florida that opt not to abide by its conditional sail order following a court ruling.The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday abruptly reversed itself and said it would no longer block a lower court ruling that made the CDC's COVID-related cruise ship rules nonbinding in Florida.CDC also said cruise ships not following its order must abide by other requirements including ""reporting of individual cases of illness or death and ship inspections and sanitary measures to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases.""The CDC said it will not waive mask requirements in indoor spaces on cruise ships for those lines that are not voluntarily complying with its conditional sail order."
"Another round of banter before the sudden rise that will hit all the bears of a sudden drop, nothing will stop this stock from flying soon."
best demographic for full vaccination mandate. love the fwd bookings. floating ATMs.
For those who have forgotten it was the taliban that was behind the 911 attacks. This is the worst thing that could have possibly happened to the worldwide industries.
Woo Hoo!
"raise your hand if you would book a cruise in the next 6 months...... see, no hands..... going back to 15 by oct 1"
In a hurry to book your cruise? https://nypost.com/2021/08/24/fully-vaccinated-woman-reportedly-dies-of-covid-19-after-taking-cruise-to-belize/?utm_campaign=iphone_nyp&utm_source
There is a difference between the freedom of choice and being allowed to hurt others with the choices you make !Nobody is trying to control anyone We are so lucky and blessed to live in a country regardless of its leadership party that is so Scientifically advanced and willing to provide its citizens a vaccine to a disease that it’s killing so many around the world for freeIf getting rid of this nightmare called COVID-19 requires getting poked twice in the arm then just get the mother AfinVaccine or simply lock yourself in your house and let others go back to their normal lives!!If you own this EFT or any other travel/recovery shares and you are NOT vaccinated then you are a true Moran
NCLH Passengers......Getting AGROUP PHOTO !
1000 share more 21.45 
So the unfortunate death of the 77 years old lady on the Carnival Vista was reported last week Why all of the sudden they are making a big deal about it now Norwegian is the company to count on when it comes to health and safety They have proven themselves with zero issues on all of their voyages I said it before it’s not about how many ships you put on the water the fastest But how safe and profitable each of ur ships will be when it sails again and that’s exactly what Norwegian is doing..When they mandated the vaccine passport everyone Crucified them but now all the other companies are following their lead Frank Del Rio you have my respect…you sure know how to run a cruise ship company the right wayI really hope analysts will notice the difference and separate these companies and value them based on preference not as sector in general
Up up and away !!!

Steady climbing to $34 then once it hits that buy point it will jump to 40s.
And I have this NCLH and UAL. It's a blood bath for travel after the Afganistan debacle.
Closing at $18-19 today. The entire cruise industry is toast.
Street will realize the road to profitability are years away. Consumer vacationing will benefit airlines and hospitality for years before they jump to cruises. NCLH will be back around 20 very soon.
gotta love options fridays... like clockwork.
The simple reason this stock is going down. Any ship that leaves a Florida port is filled with Floridians over half the ship. Florida as a whole love our Governor and our ability to make our own choices. The unvaccinated plus the vaccinated who believe in freedom of choice will not go on Ncl
"With the supreme court ruling logically last Thursday that you can't let people live for free (removing the CDC's eviction moratorium which was moronic at best) ￼and have no consequences, it pushes home even further how every time the Democrats try to give away 'freebees' and destroy small businesses, ￼ it always has a massive consequence that hurts honest hard-working Americans.￼￼"
"Speaking today at a news conference in Seattle aboard Norwegian Encore — which on Saturday will become the first NCLH ship to set sail from the US since the pandemic — NCLH President and CEO Frank Del Rio expressed a commitment to make his company's fleet of 28 ships the 'safest place on earth, certainly the safest vacation alternative.''... This is the right thing to do,' he said. 'This little feud we have with the state of Florida [shows] we take it seriously.'"
In the Frank Del Rio article article it highlighted Net Sales of $4.37 million (you call that bookings?) and Adjusted Loss per Share of $1.93 (ouch!). Looks like 6 quarters of cash left for all 3 big cruise companies before hitting zero. Will they save bond holders earlier though? Let me know your bankruptcy timing predictions for NCLH and the two if you've got them.
My bones are telling me to buy more before August 6 rolls around. Something about the next court step process.
"don't panic this mornings reversal has nothing to do with the cruise's. its a larger short at many stocks across the market.. look at the patterns of AMC, F, CCL, NCLH, FANG, GME"
"Here's something that doesn't make sense: NCL and the 2 subsidiaries total 28 ships. They are all not in Florida. Who knows where they are? If they are spread around the globe, then why aren't a bunch of them sailing and generating income?"
"It's a pandemic with 100k+ in USA hospitals now, and growing. Serious question: You want to own a stake in a broke cruise ship company?"
"It seems the confirmed case reaches to peak level in US, will be showing the downturn soon and following fear of the delta will be diminishing and will boost the SP along with high demand of curise travel! I also check the India confirmed cases to see the trend of delta and it is clearly showing delta is just another disturbance similar to other variants, be calm and wait for being wealthier"
"Norwegians won the case in Florida, the sailing will be conditional on proof of receiving the vaccine, in addition to the corona examination, an important judicial victory and it must be reflected tomorrow in the share price and perhaps a significant increase"
In Judge Kathleen Williams we trust. Nclh is adamant about having 100% vax cruises. The state is trying to say Nclh should have done the mock safety cruises but the CDC provided another option. Nclh says how can you make that option illegal to verify. As per the conference call 35% of their ships are in Florida for this year.
We are sailing. Enough said.
"i have to say, this is a very proactive management & company."
"After the spread of the mutant, specifically in Florida, I think that approval of proof of vaccination should occur, and this constitutes support for the stock"

"If large, pent-up future bookings were announced, which have already been made, and they will be cash liquidity and cash flows paid in advance, what will happen for sure, the stock will make a big leap and perhaps exceed expectations. I am waiting for such good news and this is what will happen on the day the results are announced."
Adding shares the past few weeks. Most of money tied up in online sports gambling stocks for quick gains. But do expect $40 a share by April next year. Just a matter of buying the dips.
"The reaction is simple, it will come back strong, no need to worry"
where is that short John? Everytime he posted I bought a block a shares. nclh is an awesome cruiseline and people can't wait to get out and travel. I have a cruise booked for next year
"$CCL $NCLH $RCLDO you remember Bernstein's comments last year:30%-50% occupancy to break even per shipGenerally, the break-even occupancy for any Carnival ship is in the 30% to 50% range, depending its size, according to CFO David Bernstein.Based on actual 2019 numbers, Carnival would need to operate about 15 ships to be cash-flow positive. The company's top 15 ships generate 30% to 31% of company cash flow, he said.Elaborating further, to cover costs for the rest of the ships in lay-up and all shoreside sales, general and administrative costs, Bernstein estimated Carnival would need to operate 25 ships to be cash-flow break even.Just announced today Carnival will be at 75% by end of year:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/carnival-sees-cruise-operating-capacity-125745900.html"
Diamond hands here. Not even considering selling until $50s. Once people come there senses I'm willing to bet cruise stocks are going to go to the moon.
Im glad we are somewhat stable here. B is hindering our progress as well as getting people killed. He's a train wreck on steroids and Harris is worse.Problem is when she takes over she has the right to pick her own VP ...God forbid she picks Hillary￼
It’s so funny how all of a sudden Carnival is the best preforming stock between the three
With the covid and now Bidens wonderful foreign affairs handling to make people scared to travel we can look at anothe 25% loss.
In case you want to see where their ships are (1 in Florida out of 28). https://www.cruisin.me/cruise-ship-tracker/norwegian-cruise-line/fleet/
Per 6/30/21 statement: $2.7 billion in cash vs $2.2 billion current liabilities and 400 million shares outstanding with a book value of $7.75/share. Losses of $200 million a month.What should this stock sell for?

Wilensky and the b administration unwilling to let this fear go now stated that all of you that got your vaccinations have zero protection against delta.￼But yet he lets over 1 million illegal people already just this year alone cross the border and spread them throughout the United States.￼￼ by the way Delta variant hurts no one.￼￼
nclh back from florida with full vaccinated people
"While other cruise companies are making changes and introducing new measures to try and keep covid and the delta variant off their ships, Norwegian hasn’t implemented any new measures. More specifically, NCLH requires no masks onboard, there is no social distancing, there are no capacity limitations, there are no restrictions on shore excursions and all experiences restaurants, activities and experiences are open."
8 more days till we get to show off! It’s should be good.
"l told you yesterday, it is a bearish sign here, now it will drop to $20 ;)"
"if people have the right to choose not to get the vaccine, then hospitals should have the right to turn away anti vaxxers from their ICU beds. also just read in the paper that almost all ICU beds now and dead folks are dying from Covid unvaccinated.. by the way can you believe that some anti vaxxers still don't believe DT got the vaccine even though he confirmed it Fox News. what are you scared of?"
28 _ 29$ coming soon
Getting closer to actual value of $15. Bs there by early winter.
So many good news about Cruise lines. They are back! Stock price will soar in the next 2 weeks. Congrats long!!!!
Should be good week desantis is shut down
"More downside coming, because COVID is not going away and COVID cases and deaths are highest than any country in the WORLD.COVID is spreading without regards of COVID vaccine. https://kdvr.com/news/27-vaccinated-people-on-carnival-cruise-test-positive-for-covid-19/"
Ncl will fall big time . You do not mess with Florida. Disney is not and will not require vacs for guests in Florida. Disney up over 5 % in premarket . Disney ceo stated on Cramer that they work well with the governor . One can see that upset Cramers agenda . When you mandates vacs you upset both sides . Even though I am vaccinated I do not want to told by business how to handle my health

Investors who are NOT onboard with cruise companies and airlines will be left behind. It's just a matter of time when the gates are swung open and all these companies resume normal operations and $$$$. Good things come to those who HOLD!!! Bullish all the way!!!
The 6 Best Up & Coming Stocks To Buy Right Now! For details https://youtu.be/UyYUmQW9WJU
"Listening to NCLH’s President and CEO Frank Del Rio yesterday on Yahoo Finance, he provided what I consider really good pieces of information. First, he confirmed what I think most investors here already knew - that cruise bookings are at historical levels. More specifically, he said the company is 9-10 weeks ahead of where they normally are at this point for reservations for the following year and at higher price levels. He also reminded us that NCLH had been the best performing cruise company in terms of yields, IBIDA, gross margins and ROIC and he said the company hasn’t forgotten how to run a cruise line. Del Rio also said that the back half of 2022 is shaping up to be the best and most profitable back half the company has ever had. And with 74 new health and safety protocols including air filtration systems that now rival those in hospitals and a 100% vaccination policy for both passengers and crew, I like the prospect of the company hitting this target."
"I love the team spirit.The cheerleading in here is top notch. Warm fuzzy feelings all around. Time to change the channel boys and girls. Back to reality.Norwegian advises...""GAAP net loss was $(717.8) million or EPS of $(1.94) compared to net loss of $(715.2) million or EPS of $(2.99) in the prior year.Revenue decreased to $4.4 million compared to $16.9 million in 2020 as voyages were once again suspended for the entire quarter.""Crib note - Entire corporate business plan ineffective, with virtually no divestment. Totally (100%) dependent to external forces with no end in sight. Government relief unavailable as entity is foreign questions entire business structure.Q. Why is there no domestic line headquartered in Florida? Maybe that needs to be rethought. And no, I'm not talking river cruises either. Seems like a huge opportunity.Only If and when the politics (mandates - mask & vaccines, states rights, Delta) are placated and the powers that be come to terms will this under-valued stock EVER gain traction. It's unrealistic to think this goes to $40 or beyond all things considered. And this isn't address climate, which in my experience was the biggest thorn in the industry. Now it's a bug. Covid is here. Delta is real. Revenue is not.Get ready for another serving of soup sandwich.I'll gladly eat crow this Thanksgiving should Del Rio navigate thru these murky waters, as for now this sandwich blows."
"Up 50 cents a day gets the job done, eventually."

"You feel the strength of this company from its management and the way it deals with it. They make you feel that they are strong and indifferent to the epidemic and everything that happens, focusing only on providing the best service and safe and comfortable trips for customers. The company made a donation to the local community during the pandemic away from the profit and loss accounts, revenues and expenses. I am comfortable and I hold the share of this company because I feel It is really a reputable and strong company"
So it’s circulating that Florida is appealing the judge’s decision Let’s just be clear with Covid-19 cases rising there is no way in hell that a court or a judge will over turn a decision allowing NCL the right to keep guests and crew safe or else they will be personally liable Yo Ronny take a chill pill
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. Is Granted Preliminary Injunction Allowing it to Sail from Florida with 100% Vaccination of Guests and Crew
"After increasing fears of the mutant, I think that imposing proof of vaccination on customers will be decided by the government and will be imposed on Florida because it is necessary now more than ever, and this is in the interest of the company and confirms that it is right from the beginning forward."
Down 5% for what ?What has changed since yesterday??Ships are sailing and they are free of Covid!!!
The emphasis on taking the vaccine is starting to spread more and will reach compulsion in one way or another. Norwegians anticipate events and do what must be done from the beginning.
I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
30$ next week ??
"Today it touched for the first time since the drop 50-day moving average and bounced back. Closing below 50SMA and 200SMA. Bearish sign, the next drop is coming."
Down over 4%. Could not have happen to a most deserving CEO . When you go against the will of the 3rd biggest state this is the punishment your company deserves
"If we close above $26 today, this thing will rock to $29 next week"
$30 by Friday. Just saying.
My number is 41. That's when I sell. Once the sailing starts there will be some momentum. With all the accumulated debt I think 41 is about right.
You people still don't get it do you ...these so-called vaccines you're taking are not even actual vaccines (do you research other than through Google)..￼and all of the people that have been vaccinated are the ones that are going to present all of these new problems with so-called Covid positive tests to Delta and to a host of other variants on the way because of what is in these so-called vaccines that you're receiving...... it is a non-stop financial con from big Pharma and the powers above them to make them billions... so that you have to constantly go back and get booster after booster for something that you never needed to begin with.￼￼Knowledge is power. And all you sheep lack knowledge.
Buy /Buy/Buy -Now and think later - This will sky rocket Just Like AMC Stock from no where .This will be over 45 by end of December 2021
"Cruises and Air Line stocks they have the same behavior lately. I think at some point, we will probably see some reaction in the autumn."
The CDC needs to stop spreading fear and let people make there own decisions and let people live there life like they want instead of trying to control everyone
why this stock slow other crusie stock? ccl sell crusie but rising more nclh..
"just the facts, reiterated: Nationwide, more than 99 percent of recent deaths have occurred among unvaccinated people, and more than 97 percent of recent hospitalizations have occurred among the unvaccinated, according to the C.D.C."
"NCLH is just taking breather from 2 days run , it's a pitstop and it will come back even stronger , 30$ by its earning call...I'm taking this cruise ride for sure...."
why this should be a tough choice?a)get on board @20+b) get on board @40+
"The Delta variant of COVID-19 has hit it's peak and cases are leveling off. We maybe over the worse of what we will see. If that is the case, expect NCLH & CCL to cruise to $30, soon. I am buying on dips, like at today's low."
Bipolar
NCLH has woken up from a long sleep. Time to squeeze the shorts.
"This company wants to sail in the best way possible in light of the pandemic, and the best way to sail safely is with fully vaccinated customers, with fully vaccinated staff, to make everyone on board feel comfortable and safe."
Looking for a good down day . One step foreward yesterday hopefully 3 steps backwards today . We can not let the people taking our rights away win
"The developments in favor of Norwegians who want fully vaccinated guests, and this is what will most likely happen when everyone is vaccinated. This means that there is no need for masks on board the ships because everyone is immunized."
"Should’ve been $35 by now, let’s roll"
Norwegian Cruise said cumulative booked position for 2022 was above record levels and at higher prices.At higher prices…..
If the CDC ..Wilensky ..fauzi and over half of the be administration is not done away with you will not see a happy America and it will continue to decline into pain ..fights and theft along with organized crime.￼. Thanks Democrats you should know how to ruin a good thing￼
Pope Francis urges everyone to get COVID-19 vaccines for the good of allIs he trying to control you too and take away ur freedom He is not a Dem nor republican
In two weeks or less it will turn for the better. I say this based on CDC showing at increased vaccination trend and projecting a downward trend in COVID cases. The only hiccup may be a short (two week) spike associated with Labor gathering. Similar to what was seen a Christmas. Good Luck all.
don't miss the boat good time is coming 
I'm think this will pop on Monday on the judges ruling. 30 not out of the question this week.
Float out of new ship Norwegian Prima happen today...now that will create a stir!
"The strict measures by the company, which is to provide evidence of complete vaccination and submit a test paper that proves that he is not infected with the virus, regardless of vaccination, will enable the company to return to sailing normally. From other companies to avoid mistakes when you start sailing in the middle of next August"
"Breaking News At least 100 people at the Walmart,Costco or grocery store by your house were POSITIVE FOR COVID and half of the people who stood by you at the check out were unvaccinated by the way !!!But guess what you didn’t know it and those companies didn’t care to test them or tell you because all they care about is taking your money and their stocks at all time high …oh and did I mention the CDC could careless about it But when a cruise ship company reported to the CDC 27 people on their clean ship tested positive and they were all Asymptomatic (little to no symptoms of sickness)it’s a breaking news and a big deal !!!!!and to top this horrible event off they were identified immediately and isolated safely away from healthy passengers and removed from the ship and the one passenger out of the 27 got a credit for a future cruise…. Oh and did I mentioned also that those cruise ship companies stocks are getting killed daily just because they want to do business in a safe and responsible manner !!!!What the F…K"
The best health and safety measures in the world and the stock drops twice as much as its competitors and yesterday it returned to sail from Florida Is this all because it is Norwegian Does politics play a role in this Is the Florida governor retaliating for example What is happening
They had some interesting insights about NCLH on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Shorts tomorrow 
2.8 billion in cash Even at 300 million a month in cash burn that’s more that enough to carry them till April 1st full fleet resumption Not counting the 600 million in actual cash deposit from tickets
"Norwegian can require cruise passengers show proof of COVID-19 vaccination, judge rules"
Today we are crossing $20 for sure <3
"CCL, RCL and NCLH have been trading in lockstep, but they really shouldn’t be. There are a variety of reasons for this but for the purposes of this, I will focus on one. NCLH’s 100% vaccination policy for staff and passengers is, while distasteful for anti-vaxers and the hardcore freedom folks, is where the industry is going and NCLH is simply just ahead of it’s competition in this process. Under normal circumstances, the market would reward leaders like NCLH but that hasn’t happened at this point but that’s not to say it won’t happen as things evolve moving forward and this may provide a tremendous opportunity for investors."
back to 30 ??
Who thinks honestly nchl can ever reach 65$?????
What will NCLH do if the judge doesn't allow them to ask passengers for vax proof? Decision expected this Friday.
Should I buy 10k of this stock at this price? Willing to hold long term
Huge cruise news Good for Norwegian bad for Florida The Bahamas will not allow any cruise ship to enter its water or visit any of it’s islands including the cruise line private islands unless everyone i100% vaccinated on board unless under 12 years old
Judge Williams stated the NCLH request for injunctive relief against Florida appears to be a case of a business trying to conduct its operations in a safe manner. She also indicated she will provide a ruling 'very soon.'
So why is the stock down AGAIN! Florida will appeal & win because citizens are free to travel! NCLH has much to learn!
It’s gonna pop and close today at $28. Mark my word
$32.5 on the inverse H&S chart. and onward from there as cruisin gets rolling into the fall/winter. we'll see.
"Norwegians are the safest among the three big companies. Will this reflect positively on the share price? In your opinion, the company's safety and health program makes it more like a floating hospital in the sea. It is supposed to reflect positively on the stock. What do you think?"
like I said it needs to break 26.38. touched 26.37 and got rejected. when it breaks it runs to 28
"Couldn’t NCL just tell customers there’s a $5,000 surcharge if no Covid status is volunteered? The other companies are already making it cost-prohibitive by making customers pay for tests… and restricting movement on the ship. So why not just apply an insane amount that no unvaccinated person would pay?"
Why does this trade higher than 3 dollars when they have been losing hundreds of millions of dollars each quarter?
We start sailing in the US tomorrow ladies! We’re going up up up
Time to buy more. This is going to 50. Once the boats sail they will be full and they will start raising prices. Easy money. Covid is over. People are already filling up planes. Cruises are next
"There are 66 cruise ships sailing at this time. Of these 66 ships, there are 19 ships that have reported covid cases and met the threshold for CDC investigation. At this time, Norwegian has 6 ships sailing but have not reported covid cases that have met the threshold for investigation by the CDC. Small sample size but very encouraging in terms of NCLH’s new health and safety protocols and it’s 100% vaccinated passengers and crew policy."
"I think 200 million Americans have been vaccinated, a million of them are interested in going on a summer cruise on ships, enough to restart and revive the sector sufficiently, but those who did not receive the vaccine should sit at home sad"
"- Lots of pent up demand for cruises as demonstrated by record bookings- Lots of money in people’s hands as demonstrated by rising inflation - The Delta variant is projected to peak and start declining in the US in the next 2-3 weeks- NCLH stock currently is down almost 60% from 2 years agoYeah, I think I’ll take a run at that….."
Norwegian is going to get market share in the vaccinated population. Great position to be in.
"Las Vegas allowed casinos to reopen in June 2020. A month later, Bloomberg reported that revenues were down almost half from the previous year and at the time people thought the sky was falling. But it wasn’t because over the course of the next year, casino revenue and casino stock values simply took off and now Las Vegas casinos are posting month after month record revenues and stock prices are at record highs. With cruise bookings at record levels and Del Rio’s recent statement that the 2nd half of 2022 could be the best half the company has ever had, I think the cruise industry and NCLH will have the same experience as the Las Vegas casinos."
"NCLH made the absolute WORST business decision in history when they mandated vaccine passports for all customers. You have 100-million people in the U.S. who do NOT fear Covid and who WANT the country to open up so they can go back to vacationing via cruiselines. Meanwhile, the blue states are deathly afraid of this virus and will NOT be opting for a cruise anytime soon, even if masks and vaccines are mandated. This company has SUNK itself."
"what's the big deal? most people going on cruise will have been vaxxed anyways. besides, having everyone vaxxed will make more people want to go on cruise. thanks for dip."
"Lindsey Graham tested positive after attending a ""boat party"" $RCL $NCLH $CCL"
NCLH set sail from Florida this weekend with a full ship of happy paid customers. The manipulators can’t hold this back for much longer.
Just read 27 people tested positive on Carnival Vista's Aug 7th sailing and all were fully vaccinated. My friend and her husband got covid after attending a wedding in New York and they too were fully vaccinated. She told me it was like having a real bad sinus infection for 5 days. Obviously the vaccines aren't foolproof against the newer variants. Living in this covid world is the new normal.
As of yesterday the CDC and their 'conditional sail order' is out of the way AGAIN. 3 Panel Appellate Court reversed their original decision and is now siding ￼ with Florida ..saying the CDC has overreached their authority.￼Lets hope it stays that way now. Cruising is up to the cruise companies now 100%....let's get these freaking boats in the water already￼. Enough of this Covid beat down.￼
Are you ready?
What the frak is going on after hours
"Think about this for a second: Everyone on board has to be vaccinated and test negative before boarding. They still found 6 people who tested positive. Only one had ""mild symptoms."" But they still ENDED THE CRUISE immedately and sent everyone home from the Bahamas. How is cruising supposed to restart under these conditions? $CCL $NCLH"
I own a lot of the stock. I still see low to mid $30's as a fair price. Have legal clearance to sail - check. Have bookings - check. Covid surge will pass - check. Can project when they will be cashflow positive - check. As the fear subsides from Delta variant.... this should be creeping up. Peak of delta is modelled in Sept.... so we prob float around $23-28 until we get beyond it - but obviously (to me) there is more upside. There is no real argument for bankruptcy I can see at this point. So I don't see sub $20 downside.
"There is scientifically proven information that no one talks about, which is that any virus in the world, the more it mutates, the weaker its effect becomes, it may be more widespread, but it is weaker in terms of impact. The evidence is that the number of deaths is now less than the beginning of the pandemic, and there is nothing to do with vaccines, so I am talking about the number of deaths among those who did not receive the vaccine."
Who in the @&$@ does cdc's walenski think she is ?? Now telling landlords they can't evict anyone or they go to prison ?The Dems have crossed the line ...the CDC does not make laws in this country but somehow they're allowing Wilensky to do so￼￼
This NCLH stock can only go up and up next stop $28 then $32 in 3 weeks
$35 in 3 weeks
After listening to the CEO I’m buying back into NCLH. We already have a Thanksgiving 2021 NCLH cruise booked and the fact that everyone is vaccinated is why we are going on a cruise in the middle of the Chinese Wuhan pandemic.
I see every one saying 40... am I alone in the 60 train?
"When yahoo deletes your posts, you know you're saying the truth."
Back to $30.
Here is a theory What’s ur opinion?Ncl has 12.9 billion in debt So if they do an offering of the entire 490 million shares authorized when we go back to $30 and that will generate $14.7 billion …..pay their debt in full with a couple billions left to boost up their cash position The dilution will be washed up by getting rid of the entire debt it will not effect the share price or the company enterprise value
Good job today going to 30 soon ??
Who’s buying cruise line stocks ???
26 today ??
"Time to sell big time. I am Floridian. If you ever been on a cruise out of Florida, you would know that half of the ship is from Florida . Since we do not have to pay for flying and hotel. It is a very affordable vacation. I am vaccinated like many Floridians. Floridians will not accept our privacy be breeched by proving that we have been vaccinated. Without us they can not be profitable out if the Florida ports. I believe another judge will overturn this decision . This vaccine passport ban is actually a State law. Do not see how a company can operate in a state where it is breaking state law. This is going to be messy. Sell now before it drops to 14"
"I don't know why like that nclh It should be at least 30 dollars now. What is going on, the company is preparing for safe sailing and trips, taking into account all safety conditions, and we are now in the middle of summer and the turnout is good. What is the problem? And the price of 30 dollars is very logical if it is compared with the stock price before Covid, where it was 55 dollars and more. I am surprised From this price, especially since the company is strong and does not need a certificate from anyone, its name alone is enough"
Market cap: 9.5 bDebt: 12.5 bProfit 2019 around 950 million2022 can be a record year says Frank.The big question is if the cruise industry can be locked down again. But whit all passengers and employes vaccinated i woud feel more safe in the ship vs a local shopping mall.
I am worried it will be red in the afternoon try to hold on
"Being under this feckless admin including Walenski w/cdc regurgitating fear mongering worthless points today that we all know already and b went on national tv today and outright lied to America. Its absurd to have him and the dems in control of our country.And yeah, i know admin will delete this in short order."
"Norwegian Cruise CEO: Cryptocurrency Something That We Will Have to Consider in the FuturesBy Dave Sebastian Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. will need to consider cryptocurrencies on its cruise ships as they become more widespread, Chief Executive Frank Del Rio told The Wall Street Journal. ""As cryptocurrencies become more mainstream and more popular, and cruising being a big ticket item compared to a $20 ... movie ticket, it's certainly something we'll have to consider,"" Mr. Del Rio said Tuesday. He added there aren't any concrete plans to adopt digital currencies in the company's operations as of now. On Monday, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. Chief Executive Adam Aron said the theater chain will have technology systems in place to accept bitcoin as payment for movie tickets and concessions by the end of the year. Mr. Aron, a former CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line, sits on the cruise operator's board. ""Adam tries to convince me of a lot of things, but he hasn't tried that one on me yet,"" Mr. Del Rio said of Mr. Aron's pursuit of accepting cryptocurrency as payment"
What the vaccination does is give you a better chance of surviving covid . You can still get it or transmit it. So if the cruise lines want to survive then they need to stop the nonsense of alienating non vaccinated. They need to open their ships completely with no mandatory masking. Just test before you get on the ship and every 2 nd day. If you test positive you are quarantined in your room for rest of cruise . We are going to have Different variants till herd immunity which come from getting it not from the vaccine
"With all the new shares and all the new debt we are trading at fair value at this price ONCE in full operation again (whenever that might one-weeks, months or a year, who knows). I sure wouldn't be throwing any new money at NCLH at these prices."
News Flash: Delta Variant cases expected to drop massively 2 weeks after July 4th parties due to heed immunity because lack of reporting full asymptomatic of youth and already vaccinated. This “surge” is likely already coming to an end according to even liberal scientists... BUY NOW! Travel demand is only going up! Fear and lies always lose to freedom!
Interesting.https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/01/fauci-expects-no-new-us-lockdowns-despite-surging-delta-cases.html
"Delta fears, fears of changing the Fed’s policies to buy bonds early, fears that the state of Florida will appeal the ruling and force the company not to request proof of vaccination, and fears of raising corporate taxes."
With the new emergency vaccine rules by the Bahamas Ronny boy should drop the appeal on judge Williams ruling …the majority of the ships that embark from Florida go to the Bahamas or the cruise lines private islands No Jabb no cruise
Needs to break 26.38 to move to the upside
Why are my comments removed? I just posted what I read about the timing for the earnings to be published. Adding a timestamp is non compliant or what?
"Look at the positive side of the news, which is that the warning of the Ministry of Health means that there is a strong demand for cruises, and most people will not respond. Lovers of cruises will not change their programs because of a warning that may not be in place now."
"To all the bearers of the landing, the ascent flight is near, get ready and prepare your money"
To all the NCL haters you r taking a stand against NCL vaccine requirement prior to boarding by calling it Control but that’s not control !!You can wait a few months before taking a cruise if you r not vaccinated it’s not the end of the world You do know that CCL and RCL vaccine requirement apply after you r on the ship and have paid all that money just to find out that you can not do this or that or go here or there or even eat at in some restaurants!!!then when an outbreak Occur everyone is scrowed Sometimes what we don’t like is the best thing for us That vaccine that you have an issue with probably saved ur lives more than once already
Was anyone expecting RCL to have a mega great earning ? What the … they said booking are way up since last quarter and for the near future … all that matters
More and more people are getting vaccinated. People are ready to cruise again. Nobody is going back to lockdown. This variant will peak and this will start to rise again.
As long as Norwegian does not take into account Natural immunity (better than the Vaxx) the stock will continue to drop! Norwegian ceo is missing the big picture! Passenger safety by Prevention of the spread of the Chinese virus not just pushing the Vaxx! Get a clue ceo!
What’s a good entry point for this stock?
"I do not understand what is going on, at least the price should be at 26 dollars now, due to the return of sailing again and in the safest way among all companies, I do not find a justification for the price drop."
Normal people are living their lives and have plenty of cash. Cruising is going to explode!! They will be able to charge whatever they want and ships will be full. This is going over 59 by next summer. Easy money
"As many of you know, I shorted this at $34 and btc at $22. This was based on research and a keen understanding of virology. The Delta variant will give way to the Lambda variant next, as anti vaccers cause a massive outbreak is Delta, giving more of a chance to mutate again. This will keep happening as long as less than 90% of Americans are vaccinated.This is not a belief, it's a fact based on science, biology and human psychology.NCLH will fall after hitting $27, down to $17, then even lower after dilution, or a reverse split. If you buy this or any cruise line stock during a global pandemic, while Republicans refuse to get vaccinated, you deserve to lose your money. I'll be shorting this garbage again today, BTC at at $17. Let's see if I'm right again."
Carnival down in pre market.... Comments?
back to 30 soon fair price at this time at least
Were problems will cease after the 2022 elections. The congress will be taken back by Republicans and all of this nightmare will be over. The senile potato head will be a one term disaster that makes Carter look like Old Abe.
Google and Facebook will require vaccinations for employees returning to the officeSo does that mean Florida and Texas will not allow those two companies to operate in their states ???
Someone please tell Rio that children are NOT effected by covid. I think he missed the memo watching too much cnn
Roller coaster action today. Good luck.
Do we sell or wait to sell or wait? Is there any advice from an expert?
"In September Norwegian will double the active ships to 6 from 3 (Gem,Jade and Encore) active nowNext 3Breakaway to BermudaEpic to Italy and SpainGetaway to Greek and Italy Keep shorting Morans before you know it The Norwegian Full speed train will kick you in the #$%$"
I guess it's time to cut and accept the loss now we are not going to see the return of travel anytime soon.
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Pick-stocks.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
This recommendation by the CDC is giving two very bad messages to the public 1. It’s undermining any good the vaccine has done to so many people preventing them from getting severely ill including high risk individuals And discouraging unvaccinated from getting theirs2. Putting all cruise companies on the same level regardless of their preferences and results Norwegian had zero cases on their ships thus far why they get included in this warning The cdc should have recognised NCL for a job well done instead This is beyond Frustrating
Good for you Norwegian.
Easy double. Mery Christmas
Should see a nice bump tomorrow￼
30$ is coming with in one week
"back to 33 for nclh, and then to new highs"
"Not all NCL related and Not sure how this will effect the stock here as AI is obviously running the market now to a large extent ......as practically all travel stocks are trading in lockstep, which in any real world would not happen to the degree it is IMO.Liberals now Comparing those who choose not to get vaccinated, to suicide bombers ... canceling anyone, and I mean anyone on Twitter who posts commonsense objections that actually do follow the science. Ex: Alex Bereson was just canceled from Twitter. ....but yet in Israel there's more than ample proof that natural immunity exceeds the protection from vaccinations, regardless of NCL requirements for 100% vaxed.On top of Walenski w/cdc causing more trouble with cruising, we all see Lies on top of lies by the B administration ...generals with the strongest military force on the planet at their fingertips say they couldn't accommodate Americans still trying to leave the airport in Afghanistan ...but yet a third world country and Taliban terrorists can manage to control it .....(sadly using American military gear left behind by b)...pure despicable feckless lack of leadership.And then private elite retired groups of navy seals and green berets are voluntarily going into harms way into Afghanistan to save American citizens are being told to stand down by our state department and the b ministration ...and the flights they arranged are being canceled one after the other.... SAY WHAT ??? !!! Meanwhile other countries like France and Germany are going in with their own people to evacuate THEIR personnel while America leaves our people behind. Why have an elite military in America if you don't use it to protect Americans ?? I guess you will have to ask Joe,.. and his feckless liberal woke generals to get that answer.This is beyond treasonous !!!It is SO obvious that the B ministration WANTS to see America fail. Even Nigel Farage, former Brexit party leader stated today on Newsmax that the UK will no longer work together with the US on any military operation as long as the B minstration is still in office. Then b refuses to take any questions today regarding Afghanistan (by the one or two real journalists) while 13 young Americans are sadly delivered home in caskets.Then the Biden menstration stated they have ZERO intent to hold ANY of his worthless woke generals in contempt for any of these numerous feckless decisions regarding the Afghanistan debacle but yet they force a 17 year marine Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller to be relieved of his command and forgo his retirement because he asks for accountability from his so-called leaders.Left mainstream Media is just as culpable as the B administration for constantly pandering to this moron.Then on top of this insane debacle, Fauzi is finally exposed for approving over 50 million in funding for this gain-of-function research to c-19 ....AFTER he out-right lied to congress claiming otherwise ......but who cares, right ??..after-all, he's a dem.....Miss T yet ? I sure as #$%$ do."
Hope next week will be a good week for Norwegian. Have a good weekend.
Ok the shorts will try to scare us for sure. Be strong. We are going back to the 30s with all the good news. And we are sailing in the USA Today and out of Florida this Saturday.
"should be at 40 now waiting for news that will drive it to 50+.. buy and hold, it will come"
Vaccination cruises only.
Yesterday the Norwegian Gem returned from a 7 day cruise reporting ZERO Covid cases. The ship left from and returned to Covid ravaged Florida. The defence rests.
Oceania Cruises (owned by NCLH) finally hitting the open seas again ....Nice
We set sail in the US tomorrow. Let’s go full double in the next 6 months!
What is the lowest price the stock can reach? I want to hold more shares. Can it reach $20 during this week
"Here’s another excerpt from Q2 earnings call…. As an indication of this top-notch service delivery, our onboard revenue on this first significantly exceeded our target which was focused on 2019 actual results by over 50%. Notice the words “ over 50%”As a luxury cruise line, it’s customers are rich and therefore NCLH HAS PRICING POWER…"
"Judge Williams pressed the state to provide evidence of discrimination against people by businesses requiring documentation of vaccination. The state did not seem to have a clear response.Williams pointed out Florida doesn't stop businesses from requiring employees' vaccination, yet the law focuses on patrons of a business who, in this case, are sailing away to other places."
Regeneron just got FDA approval for an EUA for their REGEN-COV ... antibody cocktail. Should be a much safer alternative to vaccines and for those with immune suppressant issues or taking immune suppressant medications.Also saw samiam posted as well. 
Bought 100 more shares this morning on the dip. Love these bargain sale prices.
I don’t see a link to the rumour even on the CDC website Only thing I can tell you is all the Norwegian ships continue to be Covid free So if it is true and the CDC made that announcement they should start speaking on specific issues with specific companies instead of making a large scale announcements and mix the good with the bad
"I own NCLH so everyone please buy so I can make some money. Hey, at least I'm the only honest one on here."
