"NCLH is the best stock on the market to short, you can be sure of profits if you open a short. It's very weak stock, can't deal with any of SMA, also a lot of negative news is coming and disaster earnings soon <3 let's short this to $10!"
Looking forward the earnings. Cash flows and trying to understand current cruise profitability (?] are my main points of interest.
"Nabeel: Tell us the truth, have you ever been on an NCL cruise?"
"Put Covid aside for the moment, very big issue are the rising operating costs on cruises that were sold when oil was $60, now $83+ and will go to $100. These cruises are really going to struggle to turn a profit."
Henry Ford Is tossing and turning in his grave today after Tesla hit $1 trillion in market cap .. while Ford the jewel of the United States auto industry sits at 65 billion !! it just tells you what Rigged this market isTesla may look good today but you have all these other companies including the Chinese manufacturer will come after them with their electric vehicles in the near futureI know this has nothing to do with NCL but just a thought
News on Pfizer covid shot clearance for kids - speculation approval for today.
As I am a cynic I say Citi upgraded NCLH because they think NCLH will want to raise more equity after they announce Q3. Or that its major P/E shareholder will want to sell a huge block.
Nobody believes in this stock :) And it will be even worse after disaster earnings coming next week
"Update after speaking with some cruise contacts. Most major lines sailing from a US port are allowing shipsto carry 75% of passenger capacity. A very astute poster made an excellent point on rising fuel cost. Which at this point and time cruise line's will not pass the increase on to the passengers. A large cruise ship burns 250 tons per day = 80,000 gallons. Vessel either burn Fossil Fuel through a Diesel engine or HFO= Heavy Full Oil.If you're still d--king around thinking major cruise lines stock are going to appreciate to a decent profit anytime soon to the delight of shareholders I would reevaluate my position. Obviously no major cruise line unless it is absolutely necessary buys fuel in the US."
"Can't wait to double profits next week, when disaster earnings will be announced!!"
The same thing happened last time Royal reported bad earnings …Norwegian took a bigger hitThis trend won’t last long Norwegian is the biggest winner from the kids vaccine all other cruise lines already accept kidsAnd perfect timing for holidays cruises
There is a strong rise that will come during this week to at least 28 dollars
NCL UPGRADED THIS MORNING Citigroup initiates with buy rating; PT $39if this doesn’t move the Needle up I don’t know what else will
"Pfizer's COVID vaccine appears safe and effective for children 5-11, new data showsUpdated 9:17 am EDT Oct. 22, 2021Over the next two weeks, two government agencies will have to decide whether newly released data from Pfizer-BioNTech is convincing enough to justify authorizing COVID-19 vaccines for children ages 5 through 11.Because children are unlikely to become severely ill from COVID-19, vaccines have to be incredibly safe and have a significant impact on the pandemic to justify their use in this age group, experts say."
"On the day of the results announcement, the surprise will be the volume of reservations, demand and the return of cash flow in a way that exceeds expectations"
One thing that bothers me more than seeing NCL stock go down is to have to read some people’s posts here who they claim to be some saints sent to us from above to give us an investment advice with Zero position or personal interest in this stock I mean come on why you don’t see me wasting my time and posting on a different company’s chat room?Simply because I don’t own it Or care
Nabeel: quite the powerhouse today! Why do you expect any real movement prior to the earnings disaster announcement?
"I wouldn’t read too much into the price action here these last couple of weeks. I say that because the volume has been very, very low which opens up the trading to manipulation by shorts and others that have a vested interest in the price going down. Yesterday for example, the volume was 6.75 million shares or 50.5% of the three month average volume! I expect that this stock is going to run up hard on volume so I’d encourage everyone to stay the course and be here to profit."
"The pricing here baffles me. Covid rates are down and vaccination rates are up. The company will have 75% of its ships sailing and generating revenue by the end of this year and the entire fleet in operation by April 2022. For the ships that have sailed so far, onboard spending is up and guest satisfaction scores are very high. Demand for cruises in 2022 and beyond is thru the roof and so are prices. The CEO is on record saying that he expects the company to be cash flow positive in Q1 2022. And…..the stock today is trading at the same price it was trading last December 2020 before any of these very positive developments. Makes absolutely no sense….."
"My mom whose in Uk just got off of a cruise out of Southampton where she contracted COVID. She hadn’t been across door step for 18 months. Thankfully vaccinated, hospital stay was minimized. She said multiple passengers impacted and were throwing up on board …. Crew suggested it wasn’t COVID but regular virusI’m hopeful that the industry will get a grip of this"
