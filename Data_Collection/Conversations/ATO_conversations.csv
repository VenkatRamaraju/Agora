ATO is down 7.04% to 82.35
This dog has grown at a 4% rate for operating earnings for past 5 years. Combined with a 2.4% div yield gets you a 6.4% total return going forward. Any growth above that was lower interest rates and lower tax rates. Atmos should have a 6% yield where the price would be $45.
