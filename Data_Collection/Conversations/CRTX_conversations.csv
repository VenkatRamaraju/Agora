We got $100.00 a share by next week?Anybody’s thoughts?
Cup and handle forming on the chart could take us to $50.
"There's two presentations being made on July 16 and July 30. If one was expecting great news, they would buy the August calls, which they have been by buying the $60's. I still don't understand why management exercised options and sold the stock at the same time if great news was coming. They would know, right?"

"Looks like the shorts are running for the hills, according to yahoo 2.7 million shares are short, which is about 12 days of trading."
Back to $50 in no time. Shook out the day traders and weak hands.
CRTX presenting baseline data on nov 5. Reason unknown but spec this is to make it easier for outside analysts when the real results come out in Dev. View this as positive.

Looks like they slaughtered the shorts here. Back to $50 now?
More presentations coming and so are new highs.
"We should go to the 200 day moving average of $44.30 on this move. Minimum. If we crack that level, then it's going to $60. That was a tremendous update they gave a couple of days ago. Can be bought up to $44."
Now this stock has got my attention. Near the IPO price. I could speculate here.........Buy and stick away.

The chart. Looks like it put in a double bottom. I think now we go and close the gap on the chart at $45. I'm glad I added a little in the high $20's. Wish I had bought more now. Dang it.

"Question for the board. There has been a lot of insider trading recently. I know that they converted options at around $2 and sold the stock, some even more than they converted. How can the stock rise in the face of all this insider selling. Would they be selling if good news was around the corner. But someone is really buying those Aug. $60 calls. Confusing."

This is a material finding. CRTX's drug, COR388, is known to reduce Rantes in the blood.

"On Dec.4th, we have learnt that the phase 2/3 Gain trial successfully passed the interim analysis. What can we deduce about that? First that the reviewers have no significant safety concern for the drug based of the 300 patients of the interim analysis. This is reassuring and consistent with precious published data. Second, the drug is not so overwhelmingly efficient that the trial is interrupted to let all the patients benefit the drug. This is not surprising and this is usually the case even for successful drugs. Third, there is no need for patient sample size change to increase the statistical power of the test. This is also a positive point since when a sample size needs some increase at interim analysis point, it usually means that the original estimate of treatment effect size has been (slightly) overestimated. Fourth, the trial passed the futility analysis, meaning that at this point we can reasonably reject the hypothesis of futility (futility=non-superiority) of the drug. Of course, with the limited number of patients of interim analysis, there is a significant probability of error II (failing to declare a truly non-superior treatment as futile). Usually, this error threshold is set to 20%. Without more details on the interim results, this lets me expect a good probability of positive results for Gain trials."

"According to Cortexyme, ""Although the primary focus of this phase 1 study is safety and PK, Alzheimer’s patients in Cohort 4 underwent exploratory cognitive testing. MMSE and CANTAB measures of memory and reaction time showed improvement from baseline in the treatment group compared to placebo. The differences were not statistically significant."" After taking COR388 for 28 days, the Alzheimer's disease patients seemed not dramatically improved. If a disease is caused by a bacterium, the drug should work in a few days.Neurotrope's Bryostatin is convincing in theory, and its phase 1 and phase 2a results were ok, but phase 2b failed. Hope CRTX is not another NTRP."

"To anyone panicking reading this;The OLE part of the study was in fact cancelled due to reported reversible hepatic side effects.Open-label extension studies are made to assess long-term use of the drug (48 weeks), so it makes sense that it would be irresponsible to treat patients for longer knowing that there is a risk of hepatic problems when they don't even know if the drug works yet.Note - the main trial (GAIN) is STILL ACTIVE and will continue with top-line results Q4 2021.Just bought in at 30.50$"

"For those interested in long term perspective: CRTX recent poster shown at SITC 2020 tells that the bacteria Pg already known to be present in Alzheimer's disease, and in esophageal cancer can produce a protein called PD-L1. Cancer cells express the PD-L1 protein to stop the immune T-cells and thrive. CTRX drugs including Atuzaginstat seems to block this effect on cells studies. In other words, CTRX drug(s) may contribute to cancer therapy in the future. Of course, cell studies are far from phase 3 clinical trials but the drug is already tested and described as well tolerated for Alzheimer's disease."

"Chemical compounds capable of stopping neuronal degeneration in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and other severe brain pathologies were synthesized by scientists from the Ural Federal University named after the first President of Russia B. N. Yeltsin (UrFU). The study is published in the European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry.UrFU scientists have received substances that, according to them, can provide a breakthrough in the treatment of neurodegenerative pathologies. New molecules of the indolyl- and pyrrolylazine series activate intracellular mechanisms to combat one of the main causes of “senile” brain diseases - an excess of so-called amyloid structures that accumulate in the human brain with age.""Our compounds activate the synthesis of specific heat shock proteins and cause their accumulation in the cell. Proteins of this type help protect neuronal tissue from excess toxic amyloids and protect cells from various types of stress, including proteotoxic stress characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases,"" she said. Irina Utepova, professor of the Department of Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry, Ural Federal University.Important advantages of compounds from the series of indolyl- and pyrrolylazines are an advantageous synthesis technology and low toxicity, the scientists noted.The obtained compounds were tested in cellular models of Alzheimer's disease and secondary injuries after traumatic brain injury. In both cases, the new substances demonstrated significant therapeutic effects, increasing the survival of neuronal cells, the authors reported.The most effective compound was tested in living tissues of rats with secondary injuries after traumatic brain injury. According to scientists, the use of pyrrolylazine in rehabilitation therapy allowed the animals to avoid the appearance of movement disorders and degeneration of hippocampal neurons.The study involved specialists from the Institute of Cytology of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Organic Synthesis. AND I. Postovsky Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences. The research team continues to study the mechanism of action of new compounds and is preparing for their preclinical testing."

"My opinion this stock fell because no information about positive effects on humans so far (its clear that such trials are too long), and that nearly all other drugs of altzheimers disease failed trials in the past. So its definitely a high risk stock. Capitan Obvious"
"CRTX shows a poster and gives an oral presentation at ASPC2021 conference (June 1-4) on phase 2/3GAIN trial, although no significant new information. Only useful educational material linked to the baseline data. Notice the substudy on periodontal disease.

In other words, the potential applications of gingipain inhibitors COR388 goe beyond Alzheimer disease."

Go to summary page 31 if you don't mind the details of biomed stuff. As expected, no news on the Atuzaginstat drug performance itself (wait for Mid. November at least) but a lot of information about the design of the clinical trial. Overall, it looks like a very well done study. The slide 30 shows that all the patients of GAIN trial have antibodies against the bad bacteria (Porphiromonas gingivalis) in their brain (in their cerebro-spinal fluid CSF) and that it is not due to a leak of the brain-blood barrier, supporting the idea that Alzheimer patients have their brain somewhat infected with P. gingivalis.

What will we know on nov 5
Very minimal buzz surrounding this company that will be presenting interim analysis for a 643 pt trial sometime this quarter. Minimal side effects based on previous results. Any positive cognition findings and they could be on a fast track to approval through the FDA. The field is wide open - for now.

Under the hold, no new participants will be enrolled in the OLE and currently enrolled OLE participants will be discontinued. - Double-blind phase of GAIN Trial to continue as planned, with top-line data expected Q4 2021——Well shoot, potential (reversible) liver complications could mean greater risk and reduced applicability of the drug, but anything to actually serve as a real prevention/cure for a portion of future patients would still be amazing. Unfortunately we’ll have fewer positive anecdotes from the OLE which is forced to end. The wait for Q4 results just got much risker.https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210215005431/en/Cortexyme-Provides-Regulatory-Update-on-Development-Program-for-Atuzaginstat-in-Alzheimer%E2%80%99s-Disease"
Closed today (June 15) right at the 200 day moving average.$46.98. We could be in for a good run here.
Chart firming up. Last hurdle is the 200 day moving average at $40.94. I think we could really run if we get past that level on volume.
"Beautiful chart. Now above the 200 day. Looks like we are headed for the $60 area (at least), where we traded up to three times in the past year."
Easy buy! It will go to $40 before end of this week!
"Eyes seems to be focused on the AD potential of this compound, but what of its straight potential to cure periodontal disease? It seems like a great indication all by itself..."
Beautiful chart. Higher......
The worst part isn't losing all our money. It's that bad news must have leaked out about their med. So now we'll all come down with Alzh.
They are presenting today. Let's see what they say.
Brokerage account won't let me short it so I caved and bought some. Let it ride!
How is their balance sheet ?With present negative cash flow can we expect a secondary?
"Wow, what a surprise CRTX continues to drop...holiday speculation up and end of holiday speculation down. All on no real data...waiting for the real trial data/results."
Cortexyme is up 6.79% to 47.79
Afterhours?
CRTX is up 18.68% to 34.43
2 hrs left to make an impact By tonorrow girl would be empty
Price shot up in last hour . That is institution buying. Somebody building big #$%$
Cortexyme is up 8.95% to 32.25
"After a monster run up like we had the last couple days, it’s expected that there will be some profit taking. But most of those who bought early know what they have, and have done their DD. The Canaccord Genuity 41st Annual Growth Conference webcast today increased my confidence in the company."
"Clear facts: As of 6/30/21-only 130m = 4.40/sh-Massive dilution-Zero revenue Now and near future-product testing at risk to fail or be halted.-Waayyyyy overvalued at 100/shr.-if fails, safety net is the cash of 4.40/sh which as of Aug will be more like 2.25/sh, unless more dilution comes in, thus really crashing this to its knees..-needs at least 60% from this level.."
CRTX is up 10.33% to 25.64
People forget all the biotech mini-bubbles of firms trying to cure Alzheimer's. Hope springs eternal.
"You need to understand this.....AVXL is the major game changer...However the speculative juices can be made flowing at this moment, the only company having any data relevant to the progress of the disease is $AVXL. From an epidemiologist’s viewpoint, the only truly game-changing drug is the one that can prevent the decline over the longer term. We have already a number of drugs improving the patient’s scores at first and then disappointing patients and caregivers with just a delay of few months on the way to severe dementia. At this moment in time, the coming results from these few drugs shall break the disease or just practically leave it unchanged. If neuroinflammation is the sole destroyer of neurons then $SAVA, $CRTX, and $AVXL can cure the disease. I included $AVXL here because it has a proven record contrary to the others. Yet, if neuroinflammation is just a sideshow and the Novel Etiology is true and is the sole cause of the disease then $AVXL and yet undiscovered drugs (like those tried by $ALKS) will overtake the field."
CRTX is down 14.49% to 60.61
CRTX reached an all time high at 48.50
"Sharbe- what keeps bringing you over to SavaVille?? You don’t like their open label results?? Ok to have some skepticism with that. Phase 2b study showing the deceased inflammation??? Incredible results in my mind. Still overpriced?? CRTX has more promise, you think?? Love to hear you elaborate. Sava just announced a potential cash infusion(partner) to be announced in the near future. Then they went out and spent 20 mil on a new building for expansion. I have a feeling you may be bashing even more in the future when they fly past $100, 120, 150 and 200 per share."
"A drug that is known to cause liver damage after some time of use, present a huge dilemma. The benefit better be large versus the risk of liver damage. It needs to be larger than most here realize…"

200 day moving average at $41.79. It would be very bullish if it blew by that level with volume. It could go right to $50 if it does.
Great press release this morning. They updated their progress. Back to $50.
Do think this is a good long? Perhaps more promising than Uber ?
Insiders can get early insights on double blind studies because people talk. There are people who have insights.
CRTX is down 13.61% to 28.51
Concord and Tony Dwyer's number one pick for this year. Could be a double. Article out tonight.
"Holy cow, came here to see all the chatter on the SAVA allegations, but all I hear is crickets!The Statement of Concern is pretty detailed, suggest you read it.https://downloads.regulations.gov/FDA-2021-P-0930-0004/content.pdfIn a nutshell, photoshopping of data, restating old data as new, using long-dead frozen brain tissue and claiming it was biologically active.Long CRTX, no position in SAVA."
"CRTX has a potential blockbuster on it’s hands with COR388, but my enthusiasm is somewhat tempered with the Sutrovax p gingivalis vaccine on the horizon. Enough money to be made by all?"
"Here you have a stock being driven by pure speculation. Logically if this and/or other competing treatments for p gingivalis caused Alzheimer's, Dementia, etc worked, wouldn't we have literally days/weeks to comfortably get in for the very long term? Such would be a product of that level of importance and demand worldwide...for many years to come."
"The good news is that the little guy and the institutions both heard this information at the same time. The bad news is that from 1/28/21 till now the stock was on the rise, so somebody knew that there was a problem and I'm sure the lawyers will be contacting anyone that bought from then till now.Sorry for losses.Now find out which insiders CTA!!!"
CRTX is down 13.70% to 57.03
Data release unexciting but it does appear they have a good study population. I took ayearof biology at fairfield
What happen ? 3 weeks ago predicted $213 #$%$?? https://charts.stocktwits.com/production/original_277801546.png
Strong volume and price weakness. Have the institutions heard something..?
