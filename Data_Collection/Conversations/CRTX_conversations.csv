Some say the drug is doomed because of liver problems and others say all is fixable-which is it please?
I'm in at $115 a few months ago...come rescue me!
This will bounce back really soon 
"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbet$CRTX - What Next?DiscussionYou probably remember me as the guy who was very bullish on CRTX when it was at $60. I'll probably be down mark-to-market maybe 150k tomorrow at the open. Yes, that hurts. I am however bullish. Why? If you describe this company rationally it's this:""CRTX is a company that has a relatively safe drug that for for 40% of AD patients, as can be determined by a cheap saliva test, reduces rate of decline by 57%. It also has other drugs in the pipeline that will likely enhance this decline reduction. And, the drug will have other indications. What is that worth""? - I think it's billions. Not the half a billion right now..As of right now, the stock is trading at $15, which is about half a billion. I think it hit like $13 or something, and was at $18 briefly. The reason of course is that they missed their endpoints:https://ir.cortexyme.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cortexyme-reports-gain-trial-data-demonstrated-relationshipBuuut.... Despite the incredibly bearish market reaction, I think a few things need to be pointed out.Their actual disease theory, that PG accelerates and/or causes Alzheimer's disease, was proven in this study. This was highly contraversial, and the primary bear case was the idea that a bacteria can't cause Alzheimers... However, presence of PG, when treated, showed substantial slowing of decline. Unfortunately, only 37% of the test group had PG infections. But - This study shows that if you have PG in saliva and have Alzheimer's, PG is likely a major cause of your Alzheimer's degeneration! If you have AD and PG, you would want this drug from this trial!There are some liver issues, and they are dose dependent. But not everyone. They continue to believe they can work around it.On the conf call, they were really vague about next steps, simply saying that they are going to talk to regulators.They pointed out that the daily living measures test is more of a trailing indicator - implying a longer study might have made a difference.There's a deck with a lot of good info, in which they are laying out what I think is a path to a new phase 3 or an approval, which is, if someone has AD and tests positive for PG in saliva, the drug is worth taking:https://ir.cortexyme.com/static-files/2025ddbf-00dd-4375-b8b8-c681a6f88336The conf call is bullish as hell. Among other things, the tone of management is very bullish, and they are talking about a rapid follow-up study with the proper patients, as well as engagement with regulators to find a rapid path forward.Conf call also worth listening to.I think the market selloff to $15 is wrong. I am a bull, and actually think that while a dual endpoints success would've made this worth 500-1000, I think this success should justify a higher price than today though, maybe $150 if they can lay out the regulatory path. If they get a surprise approval, it's still a few hundred bucks.Here's the reasoning:1) They proved the disease theory. Therefore, their pipeline is more valuable. They also proved their drug works. This means:- If you ran a study for Alzheimers that was longer AND required PG positive in saliva, the default guess would be success.- If you add another gingipain inhibitor, you might be able to reduce dose and get yet better effects on PG positive patients.- The current drug definitely acts on PG. That means it probably will work on periodontal disease, which is less complex, especially in cases the patient has PG positive saliva. They will likely require PG positive in saliva for the treatment group in the phase 3 of that drug. That drug alone is worth probably a few billion.2) Given how easily the FDA will approve ANY working alzheimer's drug, it's possible you could get a surprise of a phase 4 + approval like on BIIB for this drug, but for people who are PG positive and have AD. I think this is unlikely since they did fail phase 3. But it’s not impossible. More generally, I think the FDA will lean supportive on this.3) Analysts will point out these dots tomorrow. Some of the selling afterhours would've also been dramatic market maker hedging, which did get insulated by all those short puts at $15 that prevented decline much past $15.4) Company is at peak negative news flow now. There's a lot of surprises to the upside that are now possible.5) The unresolved bear issue here is the liver issues, which they have not yet fully explained, and is kind of the remaining bear piece FROM THIS PRICE.6) Note: They said on the call they still have I think 125m of cash, so they can fund more trials.I snapped some more shares after hour. I don't know what the market will settle as fair price, but 15 feels too low since a) There's likely a periodontal disease drug here, 2) they might still have an approvable AD drug in the short term, 3) a new phase 3 likely works, 4) the other gingipain inhibitors if combined with this one might just work even better."
I got in at $12.60 couldn't resist the temptation of the technicals
It was 105$ 2 months ago 
"The RSI is at 13 and the price is way Below Bollinger band(std deviation 2.0)!! There surely is a technical bounce on this coming. RSI was 12 yesterday and 13 today, short covering and RSI bump will bring this close to 20 before it goes down. Near term bullish"
"although i thing they are a good long term play, I can't blame people for not sticking around. It is biotech no matter which way you look at it. Could be 200 a share tomorrow or cud be what it is today. There are no fundamentals, there is no bottom. even tech analysis is mute. but if you are looking for the big gainer with this stock you have to work thru the bad times which are now. i said yesterday that today cud also be a selloff. hang in there!"
"It does not go below $13.00, I have been waiting long time. Someone is buying a big order at $13.00."
Looks like all those insider sells at near $100 was very timely. Hummm..........
the gains come to the patience people i load Up at This price not worried at All
"Look at the options, extremely bullish and huge open interest even at NOV 19 strike 180 (CALL)!!!!!Almost not PUTS above 20$ strike. Very strange!!! Hope those big players will take up the SP cause there is the big money and the news weren't negative, I see they're the only company that can produce cure for medium/severe cases after all 57% is very good and that's include people that got a reduce doses.Panic selllers will be regret IMHO."
Undervalued pipeline gem
"I would like to express my gratitude for whoever sold me their shares at 80% discount. I have a rule, a 60% drop for a drug failure and I start buying if just for a bounce. In this case however its not even a failure, the drug will continue development and hopefully help millions of people. This had also already dropped a lot prior to today's news, so buying this down here is a very easy decision. 23 should have been the bottom number in the event of a complete failure but it wasn't that and it went even further down. Next few days should be very rewarding for those who bought tonight."
1$ soon
I bought at all time highs what do I do
"Sorry for all of those who have been in for a long time, but this is a great opportunity for those of us who just found this stock. I am getting a small position now (~2000 shares) . I do NOT expect this to go back to $ 100, but I am betting this will go to $ 30-40 in the near time and that will be fine for me."
What an awesome price to load in at 16's This will be minimum 20 tomorrow. Easy money to make
It has to bounce heading to nov 11. $20 imo is really realistic.
"If you listen to the CC today, you will realize that the market got it totally wrong when it decided that the trial failed its goals. They have gotten very good results and it appears they will have a drug that can help about 50% of those with mild to moderate AD. All you have to do is give them a saliva test to see who can benefit. They plan to file for a confirmatory study soon, and they will release a lot more information on Nov 11, 2021 at CTAP. I was very excited to see the data they have for a pill that does not appear to have significant side effects. I now will add CRTX to my list of top AD stocks, consisting of AVXL, SAVA and CRTX. Please do your own DD and research and never rely on posters. GLTY."
"Quote « The disastrous combination of liver toxicity signals reported today, though, set its chance of approval for Alzheimer's disease or any other malady to zero. Without any other drugs in late-stage clinical trials, trying to catch this falling knife isn't a good idea »"
"ok made some yesterday, will do again today once it comes down to 13.15 so please make it fast I don't have all day here !"
"CRTX seems to have shown that, in cases where Patients have mild to moderate AD, AND they also have P.gingivalis in their saliva and/or antibodies for same in their blood, then, the P.gingivalis is influencing the AD negatively and with most of these severe cases of gingavitis, the germ is damaging neurons and causing AD cognitive decline to worsen, while the reversal of the gingavitis in blood and saliva results in a dose dependent improvement in cognition in a statistically significant number of AD patients. Thus, it seems to be adviseable in cases of mild to moderate AD, to check the patient for gingavitis, which is show to have a high frequency in AD patients, and treat the gingavitis. As said earlier, more data will be presented on Nov 11 at Ctap. The question of whether they have the makings of a drug approval is still undecided, IMO, and one of the issues is whether they can handle the 15% of the cases in which their drug was causing liver issues by titration of the drug or simply using warnings on label as this might be a safety issue that could block approval (not yet clear and CRTX claims they have a solution). It does appear their clinical results have made an advance in the field of AD research to show the potential role of this germ in causing neurodegeneration, and they have a very interesting hypotheses for how the germ creates AB1-42, tau tangles and inflammation. They have some support for the view that the brain has evolved to fight bacteria and possibly virus infections by making amyloid placque, thus perhaps explaining why their is a connection between AD and AB42, or possibly explaining one of the factors that produce AB42."
"Ok, in 10k Lets see some green"
Great day today everyone!! Tomorrow we will have shirts covering until Tuesday. It's not too late to get in btw
This stock is going to jump after the release as the data is one of the biggest discoveries in the field of AD. They will announce a potential offer from one of the big companies buying in. It's a no brainer as Ive seen absolute hail marys bought when this is a lock. This is a guarantee 2-3x within 90 days. Watch who the biggest short position is with and who has the most ownership in a certain big pharma company. Do your research..
"They will ask for and get FDA clearance to extend into an additional phase 3 trial, targeting the specific group this works on (half of all patients!) and with protocol to obviate the liver issue. FDA has approved worse on the liver front, and with Alzheimer’s is eager for options. This is the best thing going! I have no doubt this will proceed, and the next result will be even better. Nothing preventing this. We have precedent on our side and ample cash runway."
"The only caveat I see is that 94% of the float is held by institutions. That could create some selling pressure. Still, I am holding my AH purchase. I'm willing to bet on a bounce back up to 25-30."
"I think the market has jumped the gun. CRTX has provided important information showing a likely confirmation of the role that gingivitis plays in neurodegeneration. For certain patients their drug appears to offer clinical benefit. I wound not be so quick to write it off. I look forward to more information on 11/11. Buying cheap shares. Please do your own research and DD, and don't rely on posters. GLTY."
Where are all those people that claimed this stock was going to 20$ today ? Hopefully most of you cashed out at 17-18$. This company is done. It will be below 10$ before you know it.
spec stock @ best..... worth a gamble .GLTA
Do these guys have anything else in the works? Or should I just take my lose and move on?
"This was never going to help AD, it will help gum disease.AD needs a neurodegenerative small molecule. This drug was a joke."
"Their achievement is impressive. So many law firms will be investigating this company's press releases which is a good thing. Go to their website and see all the board of directors are highly educated. Chances of fraud are negligible. Elevation of liver enzymes is a new development. It could not have been predicted before in advance. As soon as they found two patients in trouble due to high level of enzymes as a side effect of the medicine ,they stop the study temporarily. As per their press report they will continue study on a smaller group of patients who have the mentioned bacteria inside their gums or inside the mouth. Patients who are not getting benefit from the medicine are the one who don't have the P. gingivitis in their mouths. Then why they will be placed on this medicine. It is a fair game. I am a small investor. I purchased some more CRTX stocks this evening."
"I don't suppose everybody has heard the conference call on this. Actually VERY IMPRESSIVE results...opens a new doorway to treating Alzheimers. A key correlation is discovered, it is easy to determine which patients will respond to treatment (via a simple saliva test) and the effects in slowing Alheimers in them is BIG.I was going to flip this for a quick play, but have raised my sell price substantially in case the market educates itself and realizes the opportunity here.The conference call link is here:https://ir.cortexyme.com/news-and-events/investor-calendar"
"I own around 1200 shares now with a small loss.Intend to hold on till their meeting with FDA.The drug is responding to a certain set of Alzheimer’s population.As for as elevated Liver enzymes - they can identify/ isolate such patients and need not provide this drug. It is only 15% of the patient population.You have a drug which is working for almost 45% of the population, that is what I’m considering and this is Huge news.Those who sold will regret. As of now there is no Cure for Alzheimer.Gl!"
"Bought 1000 at 120 , what should I do???"
Headed back to $20's where she belongs.
"We have to see if management fires back to market reaction or they ok with it ,this can have big rebound"
Lunch dipping wait for it after 13:15 new up-trend
