Will these turnstiles be monitored?? What if a small child is carried? Will the adult be stopped and charged a fee?? This seems to be a big money maker!!!
IMO MGM wants to be HUGE player and SKLZ or DraftKings may be in play...I don't believe MGM will sit by and watch. I believe they see the big picture!! I am a holder to $100+
Maybe Vegas hotels should charge for daily room housekeeping. I think free every other day would be Ok with the vast majority of hotel guests. Would save us big money.
The DKNG aggressive bid for Entain has served as a valuation reset for the online gambling space… much upside from here if married with earnings improvements in November no matter how the deal plays out…
There’s nothing negative about the market right now and this stock. Jobs are coming back and unemployment surprised everyone in a positive way. Mgm is opening their casinos and sports are about to come back. Possibility of a 2nd stimulus. Talks start next week about a 2nd stimulus and trump already said he’s for it. Only one thing I would worry about is a wave of corona but I believe we’re better prepared for it this time around. I hope mgm hits 25 at the end of the week next week.

"Recently, Jefferies upgraded $MGM from hold to buy with a $50 price target and Morgan Stanley upgraded their price target to $45. I expect MGM to blast through both of these analyst targets in the short term with MGM's online gambling presence growing and the reopening of Vegas and Macau going better than expected."

Famous street tolls. Steep and winding Lombard St. in S.F. charges $10.00 car toll.Dwtn. London 15 Pounds SterlingLower and mid-town NYC $17/car coming soon.I am an Environmentalist. These congestion taxes will clean up the air.
On a high note all MGM casinos regardless of the state except Borgata (July 7 ) are taking reservations by July 1. Some amazing rates. Hopefully reservations are good and life becomes closer to the new normal.I will put my feelings about MGM CEO aside for the time being.

"Macau casinos are down on 2 developments that are being misinterpreted and bulls should take advantage.1. Covid outbreak in Fujian province: This is a province that barely impacts Macau's average daily visitors, as long as it's controlled GGR shouldn't be impacted significantly. 2. Public consultation of Macau's gaming law: This was expected for months and is the first stage in the process to renew or extend Macau's casino licenses.

"For those of you that use EDIT BET FEATURE watch your stake closely as you change selections and make sure it isn't changing! And check all your losses, I have found tons of wagers graded incorrectly. I have uncovered a major flaw in BET MGM's much advertised EDIT BET feature. Now I know why they advertise it 24/7 (brilliant actually). When a player enters the edit bet It automatically changes the players stake while editing and if you don't catch it prior to submitting that difference (always negative) Vanishes!! I have proof, been working with the PGCB since Thursday on the matter. They owe me thousands of dollars that were stolen using this ""EDIT BET"" feature! I have gotten ZERO help from support, always a runaround. When a player is winning these #$%$ will do everything in their power to cool him. Forgot the best part....once the edited bet gets submitted there is no player record of his original stake. Those transcripts must be subpoenaed by a court...... I bet evenly on ALL my wagers. I have photos of my last 2 days of wagering and the stakes on all my edited bets are far from even. All crazy figures. Imagine the scale if this is happening to others. I have tried to replicate it today and it seems they turned it off for now. The stealing feature that is. Worst support ever, screw BETMGM!!"

"Ok so I was short on this stock when it was 22 and I made money down to 18.However, now I'm long. And as you all remember, when I was short on it, all my comments with price targets were valid.I have now calls on MGM for July 17th, so for all those who think that I come here to spread negativity, no I don't.Now, I think MGM will hit back 22-24 level but not during this week and maybe not next week. The fear about corona virus second wave is high and not only impacting MGM, but also airlines and many other stocks. In other words, you can see the ""stay at home"" stocks rallying up again. Yes, maybe in the US the cases are still the same or lower (?) but worldwide, it is increasing so bad with countries opening.MGM should be at the moment in the mid 20s already, yes, MGM should be around 25 now. BUT, the fact that investors have fear because air trips may be postponed will keep it in the low 20s for a while.I hope MGM hits 25 by the end of the month or during the first 2 weeks of July, then and only then, we can see 30s by August.Stay strong holders"
MGM should start a parking subsidiary. Parking fees are a big worldwide business.
"shorts are so desperate here, hilarious. Pick a different stock to short guys, this is not the one!"
Ha your only up because of DKNG your rally ends when MGM management makes a decision. Then back down you go. I’m interested in your thoughts as to what they might do?
And there it is....$40 again!!! ahhh... More to come!!!
Thats all Im going to say
Tomorrow is Friday.
"Reasons why MGM is a buy:1. Barry Diller's IAC recently invested $1 billion in MGM. This shows that MGM is the powerhouse of Vegas and stamps a bullish look on the future of the company.2. As people begin to travel more, Vegas will bring in more money and has only upside. Things will only get better from here for MGM.3. The Mirage is one of the largest hotels in Vegas and opens on 8/27. This shows that Vegas is getting back to business and things are looking bright.4. MGM was valued at around $32 before the corona virus. As the country opens back up and MGM continues to stay on a healthy path, we could see this stock reach that price and possibly even hit 40 within the next year."

Went down partly because of an analyst downgrade. It seems they are always behind and have hidden motives. The average rating is 20 dollars. It will spike over that upon opening. Then analysts will adjust as we all know. We had hit bottom and now there is only one direction. MGM is a strong company with lots of working room. The industry will develop again stronger than before. We can all bet on that. When? Will no one has a crystal ball.

Seattle and many other cities around around the World have a car congestion tax. You pay a toll to enter the city center. NYC lower Manhattan and Mid-town bridges to start big toll fee once you hit ground. You pay a toll to cross the bridge and then another when you hit ground to enter the city. Then pay at a garage or parking meter. Cross the bridge. Pay. Hit ground. Pay. Park. Pay.Are other American cities next? L.A? Miami? Boston? Chicago? Others?This is good for the environment.
"Good news for MGM. Today news from Motley fool:MGM is an online sports betting leaderMGM Resorts has quietly built a big online betting business with BetMGM, which is a joint venture with GVC Holdings. The company is expected to operate in 11 states by the end of 2020 and generate about $130 million of revenue. Online gambling in both casinos and sportsbooks could potentially be huge business, and investors have already bid up the pure-play DraftKings to an $11.6 billion valuation on that potential alone. Given the MGM brand and potential for resort and casino rewards for players, I could see MGM's online gambling business being even bigger than DraftKings. And investors are essentially getting that upside included without the premium cost of buying a stock like DraftKings"

Even if this stock goes to 10 or 13 or whatever y’all are saying ok sure short until then but once it reaches that I hope y’all actually buy for the long term because we all know within a year or two (or whenever covid is gone) this stock is back up to at least 30

It's a cross-over made in heaven. BetMGM is also tied at (11) for the highest number of operational states. Will it take over #1? I don't think so, HOWEVER, it doesn't need to be #1 to do extremely well as a company/stock. MGM has the potential to double/triple in valuation as revenue growth explodes. For the people that had re-opening concerns, MGM has that covered. As they continue to acquire more partners in this space the potential becomes wider. Stay home & betMGM. Let's go."

"MGM had a strong balance sheet at the start of the pandemic, which was the main reason I invested last March. However, what justifies the current valuation of the Casino? I think the biggest thing going for MGM is that it has less Chinese exposure than other major casinos, which will make it better suited to take over the Macau market once the Evergrande fiasco implodes. In addition I am bullish on Bet MGM. However, I don't see how MGM isn't overvalued right now. I sold and am happy with my decision, but I'd be cautious about investing at this valuation."

"With all this negative posting about Vegas, time to balance that out with some possible good news: I live in the Vegas area. A Real Estate agent I know shared with me some comments made to him by one of his clients, a senior exec at MGM. All the casinos have been in discussions with Governor Sisolak along with other local leaders about reopening. They are targeting June 1 as a possible date. MGM, specifically, has been putting together detailed plans for maintaining a safe and healthy environment for guests and employees that include: only opening a limited number of rooms, staff that would normally support rooms being shifted to consistent disinfection of public areas, requirement for visitors to wear masks, bars and other ""social"" environments will remain closed, gaming tables will have either a limited number of chairs spaced apart or designated areas where players can stand (craps table) to maintain distance during game play, not all gaming tables will be open to insure minimum distances can be met for all players, restaurants will have far fewer tables spaced apart to insure no chair backs are within 6 feet of one another, pool areas will stay closed for now. How things actually look when the casinos actually do open back up is to be seen. At least for now, this is a fantastic starting point. Given how hard the service industry in Vegas has been hit by this, let's all hope a SAFE and HEALTHY reopening can happen soon."

"The company said that while all of its Macau properties are open, ""visitation remains at low levels"" given travel constraints. In the U.S., all of its properties have been closed and group cancellations have been ""very high."" MGM said it has incurred ""substantial"" operating losses in March as a result of actions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and does not expect to see a material improvement until more is known regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic. MGM said it had operating cash of $3.9 billion, including $1.5 billion drawn under its credit facility, and has not debt maturing before 2022, and expects interest payments on its $5.5 billion of outstanding debt to be about $200 million in 2020."

The Delta Variant is definitely affecting share price! What do you guys think?
People who are over reacting to the rising covid cases just dont understand what's going on. Now that the states have enough tests they test EVERYONE who enters the hospital wheater it's for covid or not so a lot of people that have NO symptoms that go to the hospital say for a car accident are getting tested and if they are posited they count as a covid hospital case even tho they aren't there because of covid. But they count that in these new numbers so the covid hospital cases seem bad but most of them are not there for covid symptoms. So the point is that it's not as bad as the media is making it seem and no states are going to close anything
Every casino I have been to in the last 4 months has been packed no matter who owned it. Enough said.

"Macau opening their borders for Hong Kong will be the largest bullish catalyst for LVS, WYNN, and MGM. According to analysts, visitors from Hong Kong could add close to 20% of Macau’s entire gross gaming revenue. Yesterday Macau's government announced they have invited the National Health Commission of China to visit them and advise them to create a plan to open the border between Macau and Hong Kong. Specifically LVS can benefit the most as they own the most popular casino in Macau, and nearly all of their revenue comes from South Asia.$LVS $WYNN $MGM"
I am a BUYER after news that IAC is involved with them. I predict something digital will roll out that will push MGM to the top - so they have addt'l $ not just brick and mortar.
"IMHO I think this company will continue its wild ride upwards. I believe that once the pandemic is over, people are going to want to travel, and to entertain themselves.Bookings fell with the Delta variant, but that infection surge is just about over. Still, travel stocks and consumer discretionary should continue to do well.I booked a week at the MGM Grand in early December. Their mLife Loyalty club sent me an offer I couldn’t refuse - free and discounted nights, $200 in Food & Beverage credit, and $200 in Free play - discounted resort fees too! When I’m there I’ll be able to judge how well they’re doing."
"The reason MGM is up premarket is they received $4.4 billion cash for their share of MGP Operating Partnership and will also have 12 million units in the new operating partnership, VICI."

"Briefing.com09:07 MGM MGM Resorts provides update regarding impact of COVID-19 (13.45 )""At MGM Resorts, we are committed to doing our part to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including the closure of our properties across the United States,"" said Bill Hornbuckle, Acting CEO and President of MGM Resorts. ""While this will undoubtedly have a significant negative effect on our business in the near term, we are well-positioned to emerge from the current crisis in light of our strong liquidity position and valuable asset portfolio. With the continued execution of the MGM 2020 plan, as well as the implementation of aggressive cost savings initiatives, we believe the Company will be able to manage its expenses while navigating this unprecedented event. We are currently making very difficult decisions but believe these will be in the best interest of the Company long term.""Consolidated net income attributable to MGM Resorts was approximately $1.3 billion for the first two months of 2020, up significantly from approximately $27 million for the first two months of 2019, primarily driven by an approximately $1.5 billion pre-tax gain related to the MGM Grand/Mandalay real estate transaction.The company has since incurred substantial operating losses in March and the company does not expect to see a material improvement until more is known regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic, including when the properties can re-open to the public.The company is making swift decisions to significantly reduce expenses to protect its financial position. The company estimates that 60-70% of its domestic property level operating expenses are variable and is undertaking a thorough review to significantly minimize these costs, such as the implementation of hiring freezes, furloughs and other headcount reductions. The Company is also actively reviewing its fixed property level operating expenses and corporate expenses to identify opportunities to further drive expense reductions. In addition, the Company is evaluating all capital spend projects and expects to defer at least 33% of planned 2020 domestic capital expenditures.As of March 26, 2020, the company, excluding MGM China and MGM Growth Properties LLC, had operating cash and cash investment balances of approximately $3.9 billion, including approximately $1.5 billion drawn under its revolving credit facility. In connection with its asset light strategy, MGM Resorts Domestic Operations made significant progress on de-leveraging its balance sheet by utilizing the proceeds from its recently completed real estate monetization transactions to pay off approximately $3.9 billion of indebtedness over the past two quarters. MGM Resorts Domestic Operations has no debt maturing prior to 2022 and expects interest payments associated with its approximately $5.5 billion of debt outstanding as of March 26, 2020 to be approximately $200 million for the remainder of 2020."

There is no guarantee Entain will be receptive to the new offer or that there will be a deal."

"$MGM is undervalued - in 2007 MGM was $96 with 1/10 of the current MOAT & continued success. Q4 2020 revenue was 50% YOY with 30% capacity - this is excellent news.

MGM to takeover Cosmo operations. Looking like a monopoly. Dept of Justice may be looking. CZR and MGM own the Strip. What do you think?
"Ok, as I have mentioned in previous posts (feel free to look them up) I am now in Vegas. Partly as a ""get the hell out of dodge"" thing because I absolutely love Vegas (even when I couldn't afford to gamble) and have been here probably hundreds of times since I was 21, but also because I wanted to see for myself what was going on.So this will be a somewhat mixed initial report to all of my fellow MGM shareholders. I want to bring you truth and honesty. First, the drive was surprisingly VERY busy. I left late from north of LA county and did encounter some traffic. What was surprising were the amount of cars on the 2 lane highway, between Baker and State Line at 10:30-11pm. It honestly looked like a normal late Friday night, pre-covid. I am trying to figure out a way to post to you my video(s) for the naysayers.I decided to stay at Excalibur. I could have gotten $50 rooms at the Bellagio, and DEFINITELY would have. However, I wanted to hit up the new opening this weekend and see how it truly went (I got to go alone this weekend, but normally I would have taken my wife which would have required me to stay at the Bellagio, or Palazzo, or a Jacuzzi Suite at Tropicana...but I digress).When I arrived at 11:30pm, the parking lots were packed. I will stipulate that the 3rd floor of the parking structure was closed. But the uncovered and 2 floors of the parking structure were packed. When I got in, that is where the mixed news comes in and I will separate the front desk arrival into 2 parts.First the bad (I like to end on a good note). The line was FREAKING RIDICULOUS! I am an MGM rewards member, have the app, and the app is supposed to let you remotely check in and get your room key on the app. Didn't work, and there were a couple other people standing there trying like me to get it to work in futility. I decided to sit at the bar and drink with my bag til the line went down, as 75% of the people packed into each other weren't wearing masks and it was 1-1.5 hours to get through the line because they had hardly anybody manning the stations. I timed it, because I was there til 2:30 in the morning. Then I decided to head down Tropicana and get some Del Taco and drink/gamble at Jackpot Joanies for a couple hours. When I got back at 5, I was finally able to get my room. I did complain to the manager who was extremely nice (and I know it wasn't her fault) and basically my entire 3 nights including resort charges are comped. Great, but all I could think about was the sound of all thousands of dollars that could have been dropped if the line weren't so long.The good (at this point). It was pretty busy for Excalibur on a Friday night, even with reduced measures. I've been here numerous times and it is not exactly the most popular casino on the strip. The parking lot was packed. There were CRAPLOADS of people coming into the hotel (I have reason to believe they overbooked the percentage allotted). The traffic from CA was basically normal for a Friday night that late. The best news is that I am drunk and sentimental, which is why I have taken the 15 minutes to type this out to inform you, especially those who have been asking whats going on here. I will inform you further, hopefully with pictures."
