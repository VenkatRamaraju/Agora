"Per Credit Suisse's recent MGM report: As a result of restructuring activity plus the sale of MGM Growth Properties, pro forma consolidated debt will go from $12.7 billion in 2021’s second quarter to $8.5 billion, and pro forma cash will go from $5.6 billion in second-quarter 2021 to $9 billion."" That's zero net PF debt. MGM is perfectly positioned to take a run at Entain. They have the balance sheet, the hard assets and the positive share price trend to outbid any other likely party. All assuming that they don't feel the price is too much. Either way, something very big is about to happen."
"Bought MGM @ $15. Certainly can't complain about the stock's performance, but it seems to have topped out, at least in the short term. Anyone see any big catalysts that will propel the stock price significantly higher within the next 6 months or year?"
"From the Las Vegas Advisor website...Nevada revenue from gambling in September hit $1.5 billion, surpassing the billion-dollar milestone for the seventh straight month. In addition, the state set another record for gambling revenue in a quarter, reaching $3.7 billion in the July-September period. Clark County reported $1 billion in revenue from gambling for the fifth of the last six months."
You'll realize this stock is one Huge Slot Machine ready to pay out right?
"From the Las Vegas Advisor website Stiffs & Georges blog...Vegas room rates continue to demonstrate sustained strength through October and midweek traffic is driving the bus. Overall, weekday prices are up 22% versus 17% on weekends. MGM Resorts International is the pace car, +24% midweek and up 10% on the weekend for the Oct. 24-30 period."
"guys - correction is coming.... high debt, high inflation, food cost, hotel cost, house cost (rent/price), oil cost, supply chain cost (companies want to cut marketing spending to offset supply chain cost), the gambling price increase ( black jack used to be $20, now it would be $50 per start).... people's wage didn't get enough raise... it would affect their travel and entertainment related spending..."
"Demand is coming back full force in Macau, and with the CPC easing restrictions on US casinos I expect MGM to beat top and bottom lines for the next several quarters. The sheer amount of savings in global bank accounts will be looking for a new home as we return to normal."
Sports gaming in NJ: $PENN NJ had Sept market share of 5% vs up 2% m/m. $CZR NJ to 6% vs flat m/m and $MGM share increased to 16% from 9%/11% in Aug/July. DraftKings had 17% market share vs. 25%/20% over the past two months.
"IMHO I think this company will continue its wild ride upwards. I believe that once the pandemic is over, people are going to want to travel, and to entertain themselves.Bookings fell with the Delta variant, but that infection surge is just about over. Still, travel stocks and consumer discretionary should continue to do well.I booked a week at the MGM Grand in early December. Their mLife Loyalty club sent me an offer I couldn’t refuse - free and discounted nights, $200 in Food & Beverage credit, and $200 in Free play - discounted resort fees too! When I’m there I’ll be able to judge how well they’re doing."
LAS VEGAS IS CLOSE TO LIFTING THE MASK MANDATE. CALLS ALL DOWN THE STRIP.
it would take 20% or more correction. There is no way MGM revenue is going to either match or over Jan 2020's. The stock at that time was $33 with full booked hotels and everything....
overvalued and should be around $36 with current revenue.. check the highest price in Jan 2020 with better revenue
Can you believe RedRockResorts is 10 points higher than MGM and CZR is double+ more than MGM ?? What does that tell you ? You longs invested in the wrong stock company !!

I love betting NFL games......I really get nervous betting on the Ravens.
Huge Opportunity since Drafts Kings backed out of the Entain bid. MGM is in control.
Have you guys ever heard of http://alert-sounds.com/? The picks on there are way better than MGM
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"
"The whole world goes to Vegas, not just U.S. natives. Hotels are booked solid for Christmas. People that are affected by our out-of-control inflation are not the Vegas type anyway.Most of them are on food stamp and receive government handouts.Vegas is known worldwide as the entertainment center of the WORLD, and MGM (which owns half of the strip) sits at the heart of it.Besides betMGM is soon going to add nicely to the bottom line. MGM most likely will buy FanDuel and the stock should go up 10% on that news.MGM stock is a no brainer.Buy the dips, if you can, and reap the benefit by 2023. This is a $90 stock (easy) before October 2022."
fiftys is coming by year end strong buy.
