Momentum is with TEAM
"Even with this ""beat"" (on a low bar set), this thing is still way over-valued."
Earnings numbers were not that good…How can someone be bullish. We replaced atlassian with microsoft in our company and we’re more satisfied than ever.
"I will never understand why people want to target a high growth company that is a clear leader in their field for going short. It doesn't matter the industry, the clear leader's stock prices is most likely going to be trending up in the long run.There are literally thousands of stocks on the US exchanges, but you choose to bet against a best in breed? Makes absolutely no sense.Keep hearing this stock is ""overpriced"" since it hit $100 - and here we are. The billions of dollars of capital needed to push the PPS from there to the current level must all come from investment amateurs right?"
Earnings today - after market
"Today TEAM market cap $109B, IBM market cap $115B."
The monster from down under
"Lost 33% on SNAP. Now I have an awful feeling on Atlassian. What if Atlasssian also drop 33%, that would take it down to $276. OMG"
So are we going to go up this week or what?
The balance sheet of this is terible.
"The shares will continue to rise for the foreseeable future. You may ask why well, I will tell you this. 1. They continue to beat/exceed top and bottom line of the high end of estimate. 2. Moving to cloud still in progress, so cost will improve for them once it is done.3. A lot of software integration with other companies (Slack, Okta, etc ...)4. They are entrenched into any companies that use their software/services, difficult to move to another product if there is any that is even competitive in this space.5. Talk to your finance department if your able too, I did and that is why I know they will beat earnings. The billing for Atlassian software/services was substantial higher than last year and will continue to rise, but we have to pay it and cannot see moving to any other software/services, it's the price of business. We are entrenched cause of the integration with other software we use and it would be almost impossible to move all the data to another software/service and have it function correctly. I know most companies are in the same situation. We are happy with the software/services, price will continue to rise, we are also in the process of increasing our prices for our software, so some of the cost is being passed along to our customers."
"100B company with 2B in revenue, easy short, clearly no one agrees with me though"
Congratulations Longs !!!! unloading some to buy AMZN fire sale.
TWLO issued a much better outlook yesterday and its - much less expensive - shares got crushed 17% today. I expect TEAM to close in the red tomorrow.
"$TEAM is doing great in term of revenue growth. However, I just don't think the irrational valuation of 244x next year's optimistic earnings and 48x P/S can support the irrational share price of over $409/ share, or $103 billion total market cap. I have executed a massive short position on Tuesday, Sept 21, near the peak share price.Anyone out there has some valid and well thought out opposing views."
Atlassian reached an all time high at 429.68
with negative earnings per share could someone please enlighten me why this stock is up so high?
TEAM EPS guided lower 35c-38c vs Est 44c that's a big missTWLO also beat earrings and revenue but EPS guided lower and stock down 18%I have some call options TEAM should I excise in the morning or wait
"October 22, 2021 09:23 AM ET (BZ Newswire) -- NewsMorgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss maintains Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM) with a Overweight and raises the price target from $320 to $505."
TEAM margin guidance range offers downside risk; EPS is lower than expected; valuation is amongst the highest in the market. Don’t necessarily trust the AH price action: volume is super light.
