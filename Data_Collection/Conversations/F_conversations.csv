Hmm let me think should I sell 5 shares of Tesla and buy 325 shares of Ford ?? That’s a tough question
Great week Longs ! Strong finish. Enjoy the weekend & that cool October weather.
"When your Tesla, that doesn’t need service, needs service, with no dealer network, they send a mobile unit to you. It’s typically a Ford ICE Transit commercial van <— LOL and true!And the lightbulb never went off for their ‘genius’ CEO that there is a big commercial EV van opportunity as he was making those checks out to Ford?EV Transit coming in just months."
"TECHNICAL OBSERVATION:If you pull up Fords 2 month chart and overlay it over the 2 year chart, you see an almost identical pattern. My observation is both patterns reveal short traders increased attacks as the stock steadily rises. Each leg up shorts expose themselves more and more as evidenced buy the sloping gradual down legs getting longer and longer the higher the stocks 200 Day moving average climbs. Shorts have almost completely disconnected from the valuation and Fords business fundamentals and are trading on past patterns. The long time shorts habits die hard but die they will. 2 resistance levels are $17.80 and $38.6017.80 is the 2014 high and 38.60 is the all time high from 1998. If we break through and close above 18$ there is no resistance above until we get close to the all time high of 38.60."
"Some people on this board say Ford has ""debt"". But Ford has no ""debt"". It's financed through their credit department. It's the most profitable part of their business !!!"
"WELL, I'm in high, and a dividend is not a big deal to me.MY average cost basis is a whopping $15.79, but I purchased another 1790 shares, October 27.THAT, was ￼two days ago,￼￼ and that's only reason $1.20, but that's not the point. ""THE"", POINT ￼is,I'm in for the very LONG TERM.I was in NIO, but was very turned off,as it was a lot more downside it seemed, than acceleration, because I missed the run in the first place￼￼￼.FORD is where I want to be, with 8210 shares.So, , the next time it dips, and I have the extra cash, I want to get another 1790 Shares, and then have an even 10,000 shares.That, will feel , Even BETTER yet￼￼￼￼ ! LOL￼GO FORD￼￼ !"
Why is Ford stock very cheap. It has big earnings and bright EV prospects but Ford stock doesn't go up. The other Car stocks with 0 or negative earnings are priced more higher than Ford like the Chinese car stocks with negative income. Ford is so under valued. I feel like Wall Street doesn't like Ford even with its big earnings and dividend payout. This Ford stock F should be valued at $30/share right now with P/E ratio at 25. Go Ford !!!!
"CFRA OUT WITH $24 PRICE TARGETWe increase our 12-month price target by $4 to $24 based on a '22 P/E of 10.9x and a premium to F's 10-year average forward P/E of 8.7x. We raise our adjusted EPS estimates by $0.30 to $1.90 for '21 and by $0.20 to $2.20 for '22. Ford posts Q3 adjusted EPS of $0.51 vs. $0.65 (-21.5%), well above the $0.27 consensus. The beat was driven both by stronger-than-expected sales and margins, as automotive revenue fell 4.3% to $33.2B ($440M above consensus) and adjusted EBIT margin contracted 130 bps to 8.4%. Ford cited both a significant increase in semiconductor availability and wholesale vehicle shipments for the strong results, which is important because chip supply has been a major overhang on the story. Ford also raised 2021 adjusted EBIT guidance to $10.5B-$11.5B from $9B-$10B previously. We reiterate our Buy opinion, as Ford has arguably the most positive momentum surrounding its new vehicle portfolio of any automaker and we are bullish on its operational turnaround under the leadership of CEO Jim Farley."
"Next 2-3 days will be crucial to a large upward swing. Massive volume has put in play institutional buying and then the others follow, herd mentality at its best. So jump on for the ride to $25."
The whole market has been waiting for Ford to go up for years.. The movement started.. It will be $20.. Then $30.. This stock is very cheap..
"Auto stocks are the place to be currently. Ford is the stock with the greatest advantage currently, in my opinion. One of the major auto chains had 70,000 new cars in stock at the beginning of 2020 and currently has 5,000 new cars in stock. With Ford paying a dividend and the lineup of new models including EV'S my bet is it is the best value. Let the vehicles roll Ford!"
"Funny how, when I was working, I couldn't wait for the weekend.Now rhat I am retired and sitting on 25k shares of Ford, I can't wait for the weekend to end."
Ford's forward multiple is half that of the S&P average. Double digit EPS growth projected for the next few years. Undervalued!
The dividend will add to volume daily. Especially until x div day NOV ??..everyone loves .10 a share on a $17 stock..Usually a stock gives some of their gains the next day but NOTwith the dividend announcement.Enjoy your positions .. This is first and only auto stock I ever owned. :)
Bought another 1000 shares today. I am an investor not trader. Now with dividends back on table and Fords commitment to battery technology and building plants here in the USA they will control their destiny a little more than previously.
"Just saw in Florida many brand new transit connect ford vans being used for AAA auto services, i.e battery replacement, etc. AAA spent large funds to build a fleet of Ford. The push to Ford is very large so any newbies out there better to buy at or near $17. The price of $18-22 is coming fast. Before November 15. IMHO."
"It's quite possible Ford once again outsells all automakers in the US for October, as they did in September.Regardless, the number should be strong, and be another monthly sequential improvement.Ford's raised guidance all but confirms it, since they know how the numbers are tracking.We'll get Ford's figures next week. Not sure if GM's results will be out. We know Tesla's will not."
"DIVIDENDS AS A CAUSE for FORD SHARE PRICE APPRECIATION:I am doing a calculation now on the restoration of Fords dividend and it’s influence on Ford shares, here are a few causes I am calculating in: 1. Dividend @2.4% with Margin loans @.75% which means borrowed money in trading accounts will earn passive income of 1.65% now that Ford pays a dividend. 2. Large amount of Ford shares being bought by Funds and ETF’s that own dividend Stocks and distribute the dividends to Fund & ETF share holders. 3. Investors looking for retirement income in the future will buy shares of Ford now that it pays a dividend. 4. As this surge in Ford shares buying interest takes hold in the coming weeks momentum will build quickly and share price will see a large gap up IMO."
Ford is the greatest opportunity in the history of world finances. Never before has one company offered the average person the chance to become wealthy. Buy all you can we are headed towards $1000 per share !!!
Top momentum stock is Ford for the foreseeable future. At least all the way to near Christmas. Why? Shareholders of record on November 19? Will receive the quarterly dividends. We all have been waiting for the reinstated dividends too long.
