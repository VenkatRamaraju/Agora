Time to push all the chips in the middle and become wealthy investing in Ford Motor stock
"Right now it's sitting at its first level of resistance for our current set. It still has about a week or so until it's major breakpoint, from a trading view it's looking like it's going for a correction potentially again short term. If it manages to break past it'll be very temporary and honestly a major surprise if it hits resistance 2 around 13.70 before the breakpoint. I think it's more worth around 12.79-13 currently. Especially with all the bad news revolving chip shortage, plant down time, them halving production. Of course, these issues are just minor setbacks but none the less, they are setbacks and will reflect more so than the sensationalism. It's worth buying at support 2 at around 12.60 but I wouldn't buy currently unless you want to take a loss. If you're an investor you may be interested in it, but I still wouldn't buy even yet until it hits somewhere between 12.50-12.80."
"For those who are wondering why I yolo 100k on Ford! Here is what you need to read in order to understand me. Ford is no longer fixed or risking of dying, it is EV truck rising star! https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/lcaepi/ford_vs_ferrari_part_1_greasing_the_wheels/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
"Wells Fargo just upgraded S&P year in target to 4825 10% increase. This is where they are on Ford $18 per share target. Ladies and gentlemen buy like your wealth depends on it, because it does."
With a conservative 15% stake in Rivian Ford Motor stock as of the IPO date around November 25th will have an increased value of $4 per share. With a 30% increase in the 2nd half production Ford Motor stock will roughly go over $20 per share by the last week of November.
Talk about a stock's price being so disconnected to fundamentals lol. Buy until you can't buy no more.
Just an FYI Ford is also invested in Rivian. Quick google search will show ya

It is the final, most expensive, and ultra-premium variant of the Mustang Mach-E, sporting better performance than its three siblings with impressive range ratings near the 300-mile mark, making it a perfectly reasonable option for personal electrified transportation.First deliveries began on August 19th in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, according to Mach-E Forum member 0t60-3.5, who posted photos of their brand new car just after delivery. The owner stated that it came in the late afternoon, and it was delivered two weeks earlier than expected, giving reservation holders the potential to expect early delivery."
Ford to the Moon !!
Malaysian workers are going back to work as restrictions are easing and they get vaccinated. Chip orders are high so they won’t be able to meet demand this year. But production continues to increase after June’s shutdown.
"My F-150 is built so cheap that I do not even want it anymore.Plastic (composite) oil pan and drain plug. Look it up online, EcoBoost oil pan leak.Felt like fender skirts that sag.All weather floor mats that don't cover your feet.This truck cost to much money to be as cheap as it is.Built Ford CheapCareful what you buy."
Technically watching Ford trading I see a pattern forming like a pressure cooker ready to explode. It’s clear a few small short players are taking advantage of the low volume of late to do short ladder attacks over and over. Once the summer break tappers off Big Bull players returning will no doubt see the compressed spring and enter as discretely as possible with block trades off market. Once they are in position Ford will Gap up very Fast. The few small short players caught by surprise will get beyond squeezed …. Totally obliterated.I have seen this pattern before but not with a Stock so undervalued. Buckle Up Ford stock is going to the MOON. IMHO
Ford maintains a pool of temporary workers who are ready to fill in at positions left vacant by regular employees. Ford Strong!
"When a court order is issued to liquidate Ford, bonds holders have to be paid first. There will be no money left for stock holders because all Ford's assets are junk old machines. And don't forget pollution cleanup"
Ford will rise from the ashes like the Phoenix. It is inevitable. All the evil forces on earth will not be able hold it down. $20-$30 is coming within 2-3 years. Then $50 in 7-8 years. Then $100 in 15-20 years.
We will make this and we will produce that and we have a pre orders and and and but the stock keeps going down. It only means that investors don't believe Ford management.
Thanks Mike for pointing out how Year to Date charts have shown Ford making that 55% jump in share holder profits. Good work Mike!
Since 6/4/2021 Tesla is UP 22%. Ford is DOWN 21%
"I can't believe! The Bronco reservations are so high, that Ford has to pause reservations for a while!That's what I call very high demand!"
"The actual amount invested by Ford in Rivian is undisclosed. At one time, it was $500 million. Then, during COVID, that partnership was dissolved. It was resumed again... through negotiation... secretly. So, my guess is that there is a significant, but unknown, investment by Ford in Rivian. Ford had been interested in the possibility of using some of Rivian's technology, especially its battery technology. So, Ford investing in Rivian, an innovative startup, made total sense. I'd just like to know what the source is that ""Rivian's Ford ownership could be as high as one third"". I'd just like to know more. If true, or mostly true, that would be Ford's ace in the hole when Rivian goes public."
Ford is navigating smartly through any chip issues by efficiently trimming production where its called for. Smart investors have noticed and Ford share prices are rising. Up 2.35% today alone.
"Steve the Rocket Man & and His Video Rangers...Say Ford is going to the moon..Rocket man, what does your chart tell us?"
"Another solid performance by F stock today. Held up strong against manipulators, shorts, Wall Street haters, and all evil people who wish the destruction of this company."
I’m going out to dinner tonight to celebrate this watershed event in F stock history.
Ford is only PR and promises. No real action. No money. No dividends and no nothing.
"E Transit news is starting to trickle out. Competitive pricing, more range, and multiple configurations.Available AC power generation too."
"Pay no attention to the naysayers on this board. They bring up Ford’s “debt” and 4.5 B outstanding shares. That won’t matter when they are making BILLIONS and BILLIONS of $$$ in sales when chip shortage abates. Then, the big money comes in, and drives this stock upwards to $100 a share."
What we see now($12.77 a share) is an illusion. It’s a mirage in the desert. It’s the unseen what we must see.
Just bought 2k shares rebound tomorrow
"Ford's Mach-e is higher rated than Tesla but, Ford stock is weighed down by the Ford family and it poor leadership. Across the board, Ford has the best EV line up coming out soonest yet, they stock is flat and it can only be due to one thing - The Ford Family way of running a business."
I get goosebumps when I think about Fords future.
Major turn up today
Clap if you want Ford to rise to $50.00 !!
This company is undervalued company since 2008 market meltdown.
"Ford has sold out products, credit arm printing money profit, cutting money losing sectors and the most competent and competitive CEO in the industry. With the announcement of Rivian 80 billion IPO and Ford's stake Ford Motor stock will double by the end of November. New 52 week high by the end of next week."
Tesla will be 800 before Ford hits $14
The future of one desperate Ford stock bagholder cheerleader troll with over 100 different yahoo IDS spamming the yahoo Ford stock message board with nonsensical gif photos and mindless Ford cheerleading is grim.
What a stock! Truly amazing. Such an honor to own it.
Most on this board are Dopes who can only afford to buy cheap stocks thinking they will get rich. Cheap stocks are cheap for a reason Dopes.
"Saw my first Bronco in town, soft top area 51 color, looks so nice. Bronco will be a cash cow for many years, these things are very attractive. My hard top order pushed out again till week of 9/13."
"10-11 billion in profits, build to order permanently changes Ford to a profit machine."
The 80 billion IPO of Rivian will add over 20 billion of value to Ford stock. Ford stock will blow past $20 per share in short order on its way to doubling.
The greatest day in my life was when I purchased F stock 2 months ago.

"Value stock, very low multiple, limited downside, low volume traders etc...hold strong much around the corner in Farley's New Ford"
Once considered a fast grower and multiples change it becomes the 'monster stock' cramer called it a week ago. That'll happen sooner than many think imo
Tesla is breaking out. Ford will be gone
25 by this time next year ....easy double.
"They only thing that is saving this dog is the chip shortage excuse. Everything they made in the last 6 months and in storage, particularly finished And nobody keeping track. I wouldn't buy anything that doesn't come from a proven production process,"
The one ford cheerleader troll with over 100 different yahoo IDs has been spamming this forum with thousands of posts proclaiming Ford stock price was going to $20 per share and has been making this proclamation for over 1 year now and was crazy enough to proclaim Ford would reach Teslas high price at the start of this BULL Market when F was $18 per share. F has declined the entire bull market from $18 and has NOT recovered back to $18. He ignores poor performance and falsely believes he can cheerlead and hype F to new highs. He has failed miserably.
"Current pe of 15 , forward pe of 10, could get a 1/3 gain from here, 16+ a share"
"Ford Stock Prints This Bullish Reversal Pattern: What To Watch""The Ford Chart: Ford’s stock has fallen almost 25% over the past three months and in its downtrend settled into a bearish head-and-shoulder pattern with the left shoulder created between July 20 and 27, the head between July 28 and Aug. 5 and the right should between Aug. 6 and 17. On Aug. 17 the stock reacted to the bearish formation and broke through the neckline of the pattern and retraced 6% before bouncing from the $12.38 level on Friday.The bounce up from the level caused Ford’s stock to print a bullish hammer candlestick on the daily chart which often indicates a trend change to the upside. Monday’s candle will need to print for confirmation the stock reacted to the pattern."""
Haters on red daysLovers on green days.Welcome to the Ford Motor Company message board.
Ford Rivian's big capital raise boosts the company's electric-car prospects
"Ford no longer operates losing enterprises, builds vehicles that are sold out, top management in the industry."
"VALUATION: F vs GM both are undervalued legacy auto makers, so this comparison shows it clearly. Also considering Ford is the most undervalued in the sector it can only be higher than my calculation.FORD: 4 billion total sharesRevenue: 130b. $32.60 per share .40 x revenue = $13.10 share priceGM: 1.5 billion total sharesRevenue: 122b $81.33 per share.60 x revenue = $49.20 share priceThis does not Include increase in share value due to IPO of Rivian or value of Argo Ai.IN COMPARISON: If Ford was trading @ GM multiple of .60 times revenue it would be trading @$19.56Last earning report clearly revealed the turnaround is working and Fords profits are growing fast on par with GM. I believe above $20 a share early 2022 is conservative. Once the chip shortage subsides barring a black Swan event or market correction Ford Stock goes above $30 timing is dependent on the Ford resuming full production and meeting demand of all the New vehicles. Bronco, F150 Lightning, MachE, Maverick, E~Transit, Also recently redesigned Explorer and Ranger. Please Note: I am doing a audit and Val of Fords Real estate holdings. Considering the real estate boom we are going through I suspect my finding will show the current published book value should be substantially higher. Once I complete the Val I will post it."
"Not a dividend stock, not a growth stock, what is Ford stock? A value stock?"
"Bronco selling like crazy. It will be more than a year before Ford catches up. Mach E selling out, Maverick will be a smashing hit, F150 Lightning   will take Ford a year or two to catch up....... Ford is pre-selling out of everything. This company is going to crush Tesla. How can someone not want to invest in Ford? Oh...and by the way.... Ford Robo Taxis hit the streets in Q4 2021 while Tesla is locked in at Level 2....still."
desperate Ford bagholder cheerleader posted gif of Jim Cramer saying he loved Ford stock and used 12 of his yahoo IDs to give it a thumbs up.. It was his best propaganda and it failed. Ford stock continues its downward spiral.
"Ford stock appears to be in a holding pattern. As I see it, there are no fundamental reasons why the intrinsic value of this UNDERVALUED stock deserves to be ignored in this overpriced market.I think most investors associate Ford as an antiquated behemoth of days gone by. That, however, is not the case. This company is making a full-scale transformation to become a technology leader in EVs with a full range of associated and persistent digital revenue streams that will make Ford a new type of mobile network of customer services.People don't yet know, or believe, that that type of total transformation is possible by a pioneer of automobile manufacturing. Farley seems to be the man for the job. But, there's a lot of inertia... that is being overcome right now.The evidence for success will be the broad acceptance, and demand, for F-150 Lightnings in the months ahead. We will certainly know by Christmas how well Ford is doing when the most significant chip shortage issues will be sorted out. LONG investors will be rewarded."
Technicals are on track. RSI is still down. Moving up on low volume while in oversold zone is extremely bullish.
Ford just suspended F150 production ...again. Their chip supplier says the shortage will last until 2023.Ford suspended Bronco reservations. They have made many customers mad at them. This affects Fords bottom line.No sales no earnings....
"$13.13, just hit the special mark, this puppy is going to the moon."
"CNBC Melissa Lee auto analyst interview just now, she asked if the just announced doubling of production in Ford's F150 Lightening due to extreme demand would harm Tesla. He answered that the EV market acceptance is growing and room for many players. Ford Best 2022 vehicle lineup"
"Simply WallStreet: 8/27/21 : Exciting Times are Coming For Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) roared back to life in 2021, reaching levels not seen in 5-years. Since then, the stock has pulled back around the key level of US$13.With new models like F150 Lightning behind the corner and strategic investments like Rivian that are about to IPO, this situation mandates re-examination of the company's prospects."
F held up very well today! She weathered the storm AGAIN. She handles everything thrown at her and comes back stronger. What an amazing company.
Massive run up as soon as 200 day moving average is breached at $13.12. Next will be 52 week high of $16.40
"Steady drop, silence in Dearborn.Simple question: with the chip shortage and over-reliance on the F-150 why does FORD still have 200,000 employees? Rivian with just 5200 employees has a market cap 20 Billion higher than FORD."
"Ford will be HUGE. Best designs, huge backlog, Look at the YouTube video comments on their cars. And the Bolt disaster will plan into Ford hands. Argo, Rivian. F-150 Lightening, Ford+ Google collaborators updates, Mavericks getting 500 miles on a tank. This company is on fire with energy, the love od customers, employees, dealers, $20 by next Spring"
"Big payoff for Ford coming, in regards to their Rivian investment"
"It's the waves of the ocean crashing against the rocks, and F stock is a rock. Will stand the test of time."
"All the naysayers on this board thought ford would begin a downward trajectory this week to $10-11ish. But it's been green 2 days in a row, really showing its strength. This is NEW FORD. The old ways of Ford no longer apply. There is no logical reason this stock is under $20. WAKE UP, buy all you can before it's too late. Steve can explain this better in technical terms."
"FORD DIVIDEND RESTORATION:My best estimate is 2-3 quarters of clear strong earnings and revenue growth, Its all about growth and earnings. It’s a silver bullet for the shares and once the announcement is made dividend funds are obligated to buy shares. But there is only 1 bullet. Firing it needs to be timed perfectly. If I were deciding when to use that bullet, I would pull the trigger when Ford shares just under the all time high of $32.50 to push it up and over and support all the loyal shareholders."
They will make 3 times the money this coming quarter than they did all year.
How many months of Ford vehicle order backlog? Will they even catch up with chip relief?
It is really special to be a part of F motor company. I'm humbled.
Hey Shorts check your bank accounts make sure you can cover your short positions
"RIVIAN IN motortrend was much more impressive than I realised. May indeed be worth the valuation. F150 will still reign supreme but a nice boost to Ford. When will they reveal their ownership percentage. 10, 15%?? The Rivian headlines will only help Ford. Also the GM bolt disaster may mean the end of the Bolt line completely and a delay with the LG Ultium partnership and Silverado. I see NO competition except For Lightening. Ford will be a runaway stock by next Jan"
"If you like to buy Ford stock on the "" Hope "" you are free to do so. But do not call this behavior as Investment."
What’s the difference between Trevor Milton and Nikola with the truck filmed while pushed down a hill and Musk and Tesla with an animated self drive film showing how future self drive should work? Both are made up scenarios to hype their products that are not presently in production.
"while driving to Hartford , i noticed two car carriers carrying the F150 EV pretty cool"

"August sales data out soon. With Ford it's always transparent data and seemingly continual new model delivery. With Tesla it's always a gimmick, delay, an investigation (FSD), a cryptic tweet or a diversion (robots)."
Tried to order Bronco and was told I wouldn't see it to 2023
13.13 magic is about to happen again!
The penny anti shorts on this board should start praying that Ford does not find a WallStreet sponsor to move the value of the shares to sector fair value.
Ford ever going to pay dividends again?

"""The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing.""- Henry Ford"
Do you think doubling of vehicle production due to overwhelming demand growing reservations is an indication that 2022 will be a boom year since people want in on the Best vehicle lineup out there?
"A Ford stock price drop of this percentage is disheartening. Still, it is inevitable that this extremely UNDERVALUED stock will rise... dramatically... in the near future when sales will definitely soar. Within a year, I believe, Ford will be trading consistently in the $20-$30 range and rise from that level in the coming years. So, in many ways, investing in this established company is a great bargain.Management is excellent. Marketing is flawless. The chip shortage situation is being resolved. Customers want to buy what Ford can manufacture. There are hiccups in these turbulent times. Overall demand is huge, and, I think, growing. Ford has the goods.Patience is required for the LONG investor."
"In a recent article titled ""Electric Vehicle Checkpoint: Cramer Calls Tesla Cybertruck an 'Eyesore'"", Jim Cramer makes it clear how he feels about the Tesla Cyber Truck by calling it ""an eyesore"" and ""ugly"". Kramer is still very much a cheerleader for the Ford team."

"Rivian (RIVN) has reportedly filed for an IPO and is looking to go public around Thanksgiving after it lands SEC approval. Bloomberg reports that the electric vehicle startup is looking for a valuation of around $80B, which is a shocking jump from the $27.6B valuation when it raised new funds from T. Rowe Price, Fidelity Investments and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) earlier in the year. The $80B mark is also higher than the caps for Nio (NYSE:NIO) $61B, Fisker (NYSE:FSR) $4B, Canoo (NASDAQ:GOEV) $2B, Workhorse Group (NASDAQ:WKHS) $1.1B and Lordstown Motors (NASDAQ:RIDE) $1.1B combined. Of note, Ford (NYSE:F) is also an earlier investor in Rivian.Rivian aims to bring a truck and SUV to the market. The R1T truck will have a +300-mile range when it launches and the R1S SUV will feature towing capacity of 7,700 pounds. Amazon is tied pretty close to Rivian with a goal to have a delivery fleet of 10K Rivian vehicles on the road making deliveries by 2030.Read about the EV stock with the strongest momentum this week.Read Next: Rivian preps to pour $5B in second U.S. plant as part of expansion plan"

F150 Lightening production will be double original production number due to demand. Tesla Cyberjunk is a non player in ev truck market. Ford stock will be $20 by end of September.
The Tesla crash was not a Tesla car that suddenly caught fire due to battery malfunction like we've heard and read about so many times this was crash was a malfunction of Tesla's auto pilot feature. Luckily there was no fire this time and nobody died in this Tesla car crash malfunction
ford can’t rely on china or japan for critical automotive parts. It is very obvious we need more car parts made domestically. every single part USA goal #1.
"Ford's 14% ownership of Rivian should be worth 11.2 billion at the beginning of Rivian trading. If people go insane for Rivian as they have for Tesla, and if Ford doesn't cash out early... Ford could be into some big money..."
If Rivian does their planned IPO in the fall how much does this add to Ford's bottom line as this value is unlocked?
So many HF on this board. Love to short Ford. With 4 billion shares outstanding no wonder. Too much availability. Easy to short. Thus all the activity on this board.
Bought more today - good luck to all!
They said they double production target. How? While shutting plants down with chip shortage? Does not make any sense when they say something and do something to show total opposite.
Munro and Assoc didn’t like that the Mach-E was a hodgepodge of misc parts. Doesn’t sound like Ford is EV ready.
It's a Buy !Please meet:BroncoMaverickLightningRaptor &Mach
Yahoo troll with 100 different yahoo IDs making 99% of all the posts hyping and cheerleading for Ford stock on this message board has some new tactics. 1. Posting bogus fabricated claims that F is worth $100 per share and 2. Pretending to be a Marine posting Marine Slogans to himself with his numerous yahoo IDs. Clearly he is a draftdodger as no real Marine would hide behind his computer keyboard in his mommys basement pretending to be a Marine.
"Ford Motor has sold out products, Rivian IPO worth billions in market cap, Ford Motor credit printing money for profit, most competent and competitive CEO in the industry. Time for Ford Motor stock to blow past $20 per share"
With brokerage firms adding up added value of Rivian IPO to Ford stock value and skyrocketing profits Ford stock will blow past $14 today and the rocket ship will blast off. Time to jump on under $14 per share will be over today.
Ford is remarkable automobile company. They have all the right stuff. Amazing.
Anyone around in 1994 when Ford was selling for $12. That seems to be the right price forever.
"Major shift occurred Friday after the bell with GM's Bolt EV battery fire recall announcement. GM and Ford are permanently decoupled and now Ford will soar on its product line, balance sheet and the most competent and competitive CEO in the industry. Ford will quickly retake its 52 week high."
"Electric vehicles are the future and I really like the progress at Ford (check out the performance data and demand for the F-150 Lightning Electric). Plus, there's a new bi-directional power switch technology patented by Ideal Power (IPWR) that is 5X more efficient than legacy devices. According to IPWR, they have a Top Ten Global Automaker (see recent news story) evaluating this new highly efficient semiconductor...and as a Ford fan, I hope it's Ford looking at this disruptive, next gen solution for it's electric vehicles."
selling some Tesla and buying some more Ford I see potential
"Lowest p/e in the industry, sold out products, strong balance sheet, Ford Motor credit printing money for profit Rivian IPO will add billions to the balance sheet and the most competent and competitive CEO in the industry. Investors in Ford Motor stock are going to become wealthy from the run-up."
The cheapest way to buy Rivian IPO is to buy Ford. Is like buying Rivian at steep discount.
"How is the fantasy investing going in here? Great no doubt. I see Ford at over $1,000 in the near future, and a $1,000 per share dividend by next week."
Lightening on fire. F gonna burst higher. Buy.
Ford should be trading at least $100 a share. Base on the proper valuation model.
Agreed - thanks Mike - I wasn't even aware that stocks are charted until the heads up all morning from Mike and now I see that Ford's YTD chart is heading up (I think this is good but I'm still learning)
Should be in the $13's tomorrow. This is a great stock to buy.
I will buy some Ford shares when Cramer says to sell.
"Ford investors should feel good about their investment. Besides the recent good news and bump in stock price, there's more. Much more.If you are a car enthusiast, you are well aware of the Youtube channel in which car expert Sandy Munro tears down cars, bolt by bolt, to examine design quality. A recent episode called ""Ford Mach-E Front Motor: Sandy is Blown Away by Great Design"", Sandy uncharacteristically is VERY IMPRESSED with the design of the Ford motor. It was mesmerizing to see, in great detail, during the 27':35"" video, exactly how the Ford motor is so damn good. I love to see excellence, explained with great attention to detail."
If George Washington was alive today there is no doubt he would be driving a Ford.

"Rivian IPO date November 25th. Ford stock will be double by the end of November due to percentage ownership in Rivian, sold out product, Ford Motor credit printing money, and the ace in the hole most competent and competitive CEO in the industry."
Tesla’s AI event was perpetrated as an excuse to justify the cybertruck continuous delay. No new next generation computer yet so the cybertruck can’t be built for another year!! When they have the new ultimate computer (until it proves inadequate like the others that were the ultimate hardware for their full self driving software) then and only then can the cybertruck be built.
Ford is lean and made all the right moves. Profit is way up.
"Tomorrow we shall see the rebound of F. Shorts had their fun. Serious buying tomorrow, should be around $13.25. Then next 2-3 days in the low $14."
"Strong day...more to follow. Big money is searching for value in a growing sector. People want and Need vehicles, yes they do"
Ford is showing it's true strength. You cannot break this stock.
"Ford needs to be evaluated and treated separately from GM. Perhaps, today is the day it starts."
"The simple way to prevent your shares being lended to the shorts: give a GTC order to sell at significantly higher price, for example $20, or $100 if this is your target. Your broker cannot lend your shares."
Ford bulls may not agree on politics but I am sure we all agree on what direction we want the stock to move.
"Ford is an American icon, like cocoa cola and baseball. It will endure."
Cramer should never pump this stock again. Maybe then it will go up.

During its AI Day event, Tesla showed an animated video rendering of a car equipped with its self-driving technology navigating traffic and making turns without prompting from the human in the driver's seat, presumably as a promise for technology to come.The company also showed off a proprietary microchip designed to run the supercomputer, called Dojo, that Tesla uses for all of its cars' self-driving functions.Toward the end of the event, Musk stood on stage with a dancer wearing a robot costume as he claimed Tesla is going to build a humanoid robot prototype by next year."
Ford is a powerhouse and its share price is not reflective of its true value. What an amazing company!
Ford 1 Year performance : Up 91%Tesla 1 Year performance: Up 54%This GAP keeps growing month over month. It will really accelerate when that Tesla percentage turns negative.
"I find this hilarious. Musk admits Tesla’s software is junk but improving and analysts are taken in by the recent AI event’s dog and pony show, complete with animation and trick or treat costumes. As I stated before, what’s the difference between Tesla and Nikola?Musk posted a tweet Monday night saying that in a ride across town in Los Angeles the car's FSD 9.3 (Full-Self Driving beta) was ""much improved."" His proclamation came just nine hours after he tweeted the 9.2 version was ""not great.""Tesla stock rose Monday after Deutsche Bank reiterated its buy rating on the EV giant, while touting its ""bold vision"" on artificial intelligence following last week's AI Day."
"Mark, what do you think about F stocks 2 day gain? It shows that F will never, ever be an $8 stock again. It crossed the rubicon. THIS WAS HUGE"
"Buy Ford, Buy Apple, RUN from Tesla! New product and profits vs. dying hype!"
"Value added from Rivian IPO, F160 Lightening, Mach E, solid balance sheet, Ford Motor credit printing money for profit, Bronco sold out, Explorer best seller in class, money losing operations shut down, Transit Electric will dominate delivery vehicles and the most competent and competitive CEO in the industry. What does all this add up to is Ford stock over $20 by November 25th and doubling by years end."
"80 Billion Rivian IPO will add over $5 per Ford share. Ford stock will be over $20 by the end of next week. Sold out products, strong cash balance, lending arm that prints profits Ford Motor stock could double in short order and still have a reasonable p/e. Jim Cramer is not wrong often and this is a lock for investors wanting to become wealthy."
What Cramer don't tell you is the lenders who are calling Ford every day demanding the loan payment and Ford CEO begging them to just wait a little bit otherwise he would file for bankruptcy
"Changing to live with pandemic is prudent.Ford anticipates there are massive benefits associated with this build-to-order model of selling vehicles. Firstly, it would enable Ford to customize the vehicles per the needs of the customers, thus better meeting their requirements with respect to color, trim level, accessories, everything. Secondly, it will help reduce dealer and company inventory costs and better manage inventory production to match consumer demands. It would also help Ford deliver more vehicles that customers specifically want, while scrapping off the hard-to-sell models that pile up at dealerships and result in fat discounts that dent margins. Also, this model will enable the automaker to significantly cut other sales incentives."
"Rivian IPO may fetch $80B. Ford is said to own somewhere around 10% of Rivian. 10% of $80B, not bad. $8B translates to around $2.00 per share. I've read the percentage could be as high as 15%, but I'm leaning toward the 10% number.FYI, Ford owns 42% of ARGO AI, which is said to also file for an IPO."
"All ya, going to $20.00"
August Sales release on Sept 2 .
Lots of new investors under age 30 that don't know and don't care about Ford's 20 year stock history. You can only use the past as an excuse for so long.
"More good news about Ford: In today's ""Motley Fool"" article titled ""Here's My Top Value Stock to Buy Right Now"", investing in Ford was THE recommendation. Of technical nterest, the author describes how Ford is working with the Korean company ""SK Innovation"" in a partnership called BlueOvalSK to reach the ambitious goal to reduce the current industry sector cost of production of $137 per kWh down to about $80 per kWh through economy of scale, innovation, and more joint ventures. By 2030, Ford intends to have the capacity for manufacturing of 240 GWh (gigawatt hours); to put that number in perspective, that's about half of current global battery-cell production. Not bad. I think that Ford is ""all in""."
There is absolutely no other company I would invest in. This baby is a hidden gem!
This is beautiful to watch.
"Terrible news Friday for GM and their ev Bolt. From a Ford Motor stock perspective this is a major player in the ev market out of the game. The Cyberjunk Tesla Aztec wannabe is a disaster before the 1st vehicle is produced and that's from their CEO. Ford has the hottest new products, large cash reserves, and the most competent and competitive CEO in the industry. Time to jump on the bandwagon is coming to a quick halt. Ford stock will be at $20 per share by the end of September. Fact that Ford found a 2nd supplier of chips gives them an enormous profit advantage moving forward."
What's Ford's ownership stake in Rivian? This could be huge.
"Ford's monthly August sales numbers are going to be better than you think, a lot better.I think we get the numbers the end of next week."
Rivian Ford's ownership could be as high as one third.
two much competition for Ford cheapest stock of all car trucks manufacturers.
"FORD has just doubled its expected F150E production from 40,000 units to 80,000 units. If you buy lock up your shares so they can not be lent out by your broker to the shorts thus working against your long position."
I’m buying more shares as soon as possible. I’m getting third job to exclusively buy more shares. This company is going to be huge.
"Have acquired over 50,000 shares of Ford, I hope I did not screw-up big time."
FORD TOUGH as in tough to make a case for the FORD family.Just throw in the towel and sell the company for $20 a share after sending the UAW home. Potential buyers: Elon could buy you guys with his pocket change.
"A Tesla on auto pilot crashed into another emergency vehicle Sunday morning in Orlando. Tesla seems to really dislike those emergency vehicles when on auto pilot. Are they a car company, a tech company, or a car crash and burn company?"
"If I was down to my last $100 bucks and I had to choice between food and F stock, it would be a hard decision, but I would choose F stock."
"I feel Ford is a great buy on the recent pullback. Demand for their vehicles is huge. Future looks very bright. From a technical standpoint, it is about to cross the 200 day moving average today on high volume. Very bullish sign. The 50 day moving average is not far off and could be hit very soon. I remember in May and June that Ford's stock price exploded to the upside on huge volume. This set up now looks similar and we could see the 14's or 15's soon."
"Don’t get excited about Bronco preorders, from The Detroit Free Press:Fighting production challenges and consumer demand, Ford Motor Co. no longer is accepting online customer reservations for its all-new, full-sized 2021 Bronco, as the automaker had been since the launch of the high-profile SUV a year ago, the Free Press has learned.Ford sent a memo to dealerships last week titled ""special announcement"" saying ""Bronco Vehicle Reservation Paused.""A new Ford Bronco on Monday, June 14, 2021, at the Ford Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne.The Free Press obtained a copy of the memo, which said: ""Based on Dealer Council feedback, effective Monday, August 23rd, Ford has paused the creation of new reservations for Bronco vehicles. The decision to pause reservations is due to the high number of Bronco 2 and 4-door model orders and current commodity constraints.""Customers are encouraged to work directly with their dealer who can help with the ordering process, delivery timing expectations, and build specifications. For example, dealers can best guide if a customer may be able to get a stock vehicle that’s already built or scheduled. Due to the high number of orders, delivery of Bronco vehicles placed today will extend through (the) 2022 calendar year."""
"GM is pulling down Ford, today. But you can't keep a good stock down.Ford will show significant production recovery.I hold a good amount of shares, but I also trade Ford, too. Today I bought back 500 shares I sold I sold yesterday."
"Ford will eventually hit that sweet spot. Wow, they are sending people to the dealership for advance orders of the new Bronco because the demand is so high, there are no chips...how can this company stay at $13 bucks a share once supply catches up with demand."
Ford is holding up pretty strong considering all the forces of evil against it. The days are coming when nothing will prevail against this stock.
Tesla is up 4% for the week and cost about $700.00 per share. Most people don't have an extra 700.00 in their budget to buy even one share. Sad thing is Tesla is down 20% YTD. Ford is also up 4% for the week and up 55% YTD and only cost $13.00 per share. Ford is the best value stock on the market today.
Ford is worth only 10 cents a share.
I LOVE Ford Motor Company today because it is GREEN.

If what Robert says is true about union guys disparaging Ford I would be unpleasantly surprised.
"Ford is trading at just 6.97x next years conservative earnings estimate of $1.91/share. I state the estimate is conservative based on the FACT that Ford has beaten estimates for the last 5 quarters. What is not figured into these estimates are added value from investments in Rivian, Argo AI, and Solid Power.For Comparison, GM is trading at 7.17x next years earnings estimate, TSLA is 102x, NIO will not be profitable next year."
Millions of pre orders for Cyber Truck kit that converts the hot cyber truck into an RV when needed and is easily converts back into a hot cyber truck. People lining up.
Ford is going to surprise many people and become the most dominant EV maker in America in 10-15years. This is a sleeping giant. You will never see this at $13 again.
This is exactly why year after year Ford can never make consistent gains... Big Wall Street money avoids Ford because it is used as a short trade only. To many outstanding shares and short selling manipulation.
Ford a top stock pick of new investors; they understand that every product Ford builds is sold out and in demand. Strong cash balance sheet and the most competent and competitive CEO in the industry
"SA Breaking News Team Unsubscribe3:54 PM (25 minutes ago)to meF : Ford doubles production target for electric F-150 pickup - Reuters • 3:51 PMFord (F +1.6%) shares trade up on reports from Reuters that the company has doubled its F-150 Lightning production target based on strong demand ahead of its 2022 launch.Sources say that Ford will spend $850M to meet a higher annual production target of 80,000+ electric trucks in 2024, up from the prior target of over 40,000.The company plans to ramp up production of the F-150 Lightning from 15,000 next year to an annual goal of close to 150,000 in late 2025.An anonymous source said Ford was ""pleasantly surprised by the demand for the Lightning."" The company previously announced that it had 120,000 reservations for the truck.Analysts have questioned whether consumers would be willing to give up their gas-powered trucks for electric versions as automakers including Tesla (TSLA +3.9%) and GM (GM -1.1%) plan production of electric pickups."
"Mike is so right about recent chart activity. YTD Tesla is down 20% while Ford is up 55%. If you bought 50K worth of Tesla YTD you would have $40K. If you bought 50K worth of Ford stock YTD you would have $77,500."
"If you do an Internet search for a recommendation on what to invest in right now, you will see a very recent ""Motley Fool"" article titled ""Here's My Top Value Stock to Buy Right Now"" with the trailing text ""Ford shares probably won't stay dirt cheap forever."" The one recommendation, is, of course, Ford. But.... for very good reasons.The reasons described to invest in Ford are the same reasons described in this forum. Articles like this are understandably hit or miss; BUT, the REASONS are still valid. Ford is undervalued and ready to take off."
"Looks like Steve and his other yahoo IDs (Bryce, Grant, Books, A, Karl, MB, Jim, Robert, Unkommon, Blake, Skip, P2i) posting a new mantra that F is worth $100 per share. They just made that number up with no justification for that Price. Why not $10,000 per share? or $100,000 per share? Those bogus prices are just as good as $100 per share. LOL! He thinks he is fooling everyone using 10 different yahoo IDs posting the same bogus $100 per share valuation then using his 50 other yahoo IDs to give himself thumbs up."

For next few weeks everywhere in bidens market Puts gonna be more attractive and rewarding as stocks will keep falling big numbers. ;)
"Year end,Ford is nearing 8.00 or less.The chip issue is worse than anyone ever predicted.Longs will be caught flat footed and will keep the #1 recall junk automaker near the 6-8.00 pps.Cramer is wrong again on this one."
"Can you imagine the numbersFord earns in 2022 ans 2023 when the pent up demand kicks into high gear, chips are available, and all their models are out. $5/ share earnings by 2023"
"Warren Buffett built his massive wealth by investing in companies whose prices didn't reflect their true value.He's quoted as saying, ""whether we're talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down."" It's simple to find solid stocks worth much more than their prices reflect...if you know where to look. These stocks are primed to blast higher once Wall Street begins to discover their real worth."
"Ford is getting smaller and , not growing .It will never sell for more than 6 to 8 times earnings tops."
Mark should buy more shares.
"Ford Motor has the hottest products on the market, a credit division printing profits, eliminating money losing segments and most importantly the most competent and competitive CEO in the industry. Ford stock will blow past the 52 week high by next Friday and over $20 by the end of September."
Ford is the #1 EV stock. Award winning SUV and coming award winning truck and transit. Get it all with a bargain stock price.
Ford Motor contracts its battery supply from SK Innovation. GM and Tesla source their battery supply from LG. Today will be the beginning of the end for GM and Tesla battery partnership with LG. Ford clearly now has the advantage going forward including autonomous driving. Time for Ford Motor stock to rocket to a new 52 week high.
2 months ago these board Dopes said Ford 20.00 by August.... please.. if your a new investor never ever take advice from anyone on a message board.
Planned changes to Mach-e over the next model years. Includes better mile range each year. https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1133335_2022-ford-mach-e-will-get-a-range-boost-confirms-chief-engineer
A 13 year massive bull market where pizza stocks like domino’s trade over 500.00 and you have a 100 year old car company Ford @13.00. If it wasn’t so sad it would be laughable.
A massive 13 year bull market and Ford trades at same price as 1997
Steve the Rocket Man...Ford not doing so well is it..
"If the future for Ford is electric, the E Mustang shows the future for Ford is bleak."
"GM stock is up today more then F...Looks like someone is buying GM stock, not F."
Seems to me the new growth companies are those that produce electricity. Anything that runs on gasoline or diesel will soon run on batteries. And it is happening fast. And if global warming is for real air conditioners will demand more juice. Power companies in the warmer states will face huge demands. I could see power companies stocks producing extraordinary growth. Anybody see this view unlikely or unreasonable
"Delta on the steep decline, JP Morgan $18 Ford price per share. All aboard the get wealthy investing in the Ford Motor train."
"Sales report coming 8/2, Rivia IPO, double F-15O orders, broncos SOLD OUT, this should pop to $20 easily. Truly great company with great products."
Ford Motor stock today will break the 200 moving average of $13.13 and if it breaks $13.82 today the Golden Cross most likely Ford stock will break the 52 week high of $16.45 by Friday. When Ford Motor stock breaks the Golden Cross today its time to go all in.
"FORD FINANCE DEBT MAKES PROFIT:Ford automotive debt is 24 Billion. Ford financial holds the rest of the dept 140 billion and that 140 billion goes up when Ford finances vehicles. Fords debt is like a banks debt it is the Product and the more product sold the more Profit. THIS DEBT PRODUCES INCOME FOR FORD FINANCE THE MOST PROFITABLE PART OF THE COMPANY . One thing to note is that a lot of Ford's profit last quarter came from its financial services arm. What's going on there is that as new cars have become harder to buy, used car prices have soared. We know that. We know that's a big component of when people say, oh, consumer price index is up in the United States, inflation is going on. We know a lot of that is cars, new and used light vehicles. What Ford Credit is finding is that the vehicles they get back off lease are selling for very very very good prices at auctions. They had a record quarter for credits, for its financial services arm, that drove a lot of Ford's profit in the second quarter."
Huge week for Ford investors... 18.00 by Friday? Lol
