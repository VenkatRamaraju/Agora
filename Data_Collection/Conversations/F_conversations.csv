"Looks like Steve and his other yahoo IDs (Bryce, Grant, Books, A, Karl, MB, Jim, Robert, Unkommon, Blake, Skip, P2i) posting a new mantra that F is worth $100 per share. They just made that number up with no justification for that Price. Why not $10,000 per share? or $100,000 per share? Those bogus prices are just as good as $100 per share. LOL! He thinks he is fooling everyone using 10 different yahoo IDs posting the same bogus $100 per share valuation then using his 50 other yahoo IDs to give himself thumbs up."
"Don’t get excited about Bronco preorders, from The Detroit Free Press:Fighting production challenges and consumer demand, Ford Motor Co. no longer is accepting online customer reservations for its all-new, full-sized 2021 Bronco, as the automaker had been since the launch of the high-profile SUV a year ago, the Free Press has learned.Ford sent a memo to dealerships last week titled ""special announcement"" saying ""Bronco Vehicle Reservation Paused.""A new Ford Bronco on Monday, June 14, 2021, at the Ford Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne.The Free Press obtained a copy of the memo, which said: ""Based on Dealer Council feedback, effective Monday, August 23rd, Ford has paused the creation of new reservations for Bronco vehicles. The decision to pause reservations is due to the high number of Bronco 2 and 4-door model orders and current commodity constraints.""Customers are encouraged to work directly with their dealer who can help with the ordering process, delivery timing expectations, and build specifications. For example, dealers can best guide if a customer may be able to get a stock vehicle that’s already built or scheduled. Due to the high number of orders, delivery of Bronco vehicles placed today will extend through (the) 2022 calendar year."""
"A Tesla on auto pilot crashed into another emergency vehicle Sunday morning in Orlando. Tesla seems to really dislike those emergency vehicles when on auto pilot. Are they a car company, a tech company, or a car crash and burn company?"
"Sales report coming 8/2, Rivia IPO, double F-15O orders, broncos SOLD OUT, this should pop to $20 easily. Truly great company with great products."
"If you like to buy Ford stock on the "" Hope "" you are free to do so. But do not call this behavior as Investment."
Ford is worth only 10 cents a share.
"80 Billion Rivian IPO will add over $5 per Ford share. Ford stock will be over $20 by the end of next week. Sold out products, strong cash balance, lending arm that prints profits Ford Motor stock could double in short order and still have a reasonable p/e. Jim Cramer is not wrong often and this is a lock for investors wanting to become wealthy."
"Warren Buffett built his massive wealth by investing in companies whose prices didn't reflect their true value.He's quoted as saying, ""whether we're talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down."" It's simple to find solid stocks worth much more than their prices reflect...if you know where to look. These stocks are primed to blast higher once Wall Street begins to discover their real worth."
The Tesla crash was not a Tesla car that suddenly caught fire due to battery malfunction like we've heard and read about so many times this was crash was a malfunction of Tesla's auto pilot feature. Luckily there was no fire this time and nobody died in this Tesla car crash malfunction
"Changing to live with pandemic is prudent.Ford anticipates there are massive benefits associated with this build-to-order model of selling vehicles. Firstly, it would enable Ford to customize the vehicles per the needs of the customers, thus better meeting their requirements with respect to color, trim level, accessories, everything. Secondly, it will help reduce dealer and company inventory costs and better manage inventory production to match consumer demands. It would also help Ford deliver more vehicles that customers specifically want, while scrapping off the hard-to-sell models that pile up at dealerships and result in fat discounts that dent margins. Also, this model will enable the automaker to significantly cut other sales incentives."
With brokerage firms adding up added value of Rivian IPO to Ford stock value and skyrocketing profits Ford stock will blow past $14 today and the rocket ship will blast off. Time to jump on under $14 per share will be over today.
FORD TOUGH as in tough to make a case for the FORD family.Just throw in the towel and sell the company for $20 a share after sending the UAW home. Potential buyers: Elon could buy you guys with his pocket change.
Ford is lean and made all the right moves. Profit is way up.
"If the future for Ford is electric, the E Mustang shows the future for Ford is bleak."
"Value added from Rivian IPO, F160 Lightening, Mach E, solid balance sheet, Ford Motor credit printing money for profit, Bronco sold out, Explorer best seller in class, money losing operations shut down, Transit Electric will dominate delivery vehicles and the most competent and competitive CEO in the industry. What does all this add up to is Ford stock over $20 by November 25th and doubling by years end."
Hey Shorts check your bank accounts make sure you can cover your short positions
There is absolutely no other company I would invest in. This baby is a hidden gem!
"Ford is trading at just 6.97x next years conservative earnings estimate of $1.91/share. I state the estimate is conservative based on the FACT that Ford has beaten estimates for the last 5 quarters. What is not figured into these estimates are added value from investments in Rivian, Argo AI, and Solid Power.For Comparison, GM is trading at 7.17x next years earnings estimate, TSLA is 102x, NIO will not be profitable next year."
Technically watching Ford trading I see a pattern forming like a pressure cooker ready to explode. It’s clear a few small short players are taking advantage of the low volume of late to do short ladder attacks over and over. Once the summer break tappers off Big Bull players returning will no doubt see the compressed spring and enter as discretely as possible with block trades off market. Once they are in position Ford will Gap up very Fast. The few small short players caught by surprise will get beyond squeezed …. Totally obliterated.I have seen this pattern before but not with a Stock so undervalued. Buckle Up Ford stock is going to the MOON. IMHO

Huge week for Ford investors... 18.00 by Friday? Lol
"Right now it's sitting at its first level of resistance for our current set. It still has about a week or so until it's major breakpoint, from a trading view it's looking like it's going for a correction potentially again short term. If it manages to break past it'll be very temporary and honestly a major surprise if it hits resistance 2 around 13.70 before the breakpoint. I think it's more worth around 12.79-13 currently. Especially with all the bad news revolving chip shortage, plant down time, them halving production. Of course, these issues are just minor setbacks but none the less, they are setbacks and will reflect more so than the sensationalism. It's worth buying at support 2 at around 12.60 but I wouldn't buy currently unless you want to take a loss. If you're an investor you may be interested in it, but I still wouldn't buy even yet until it hits somewhere between 12.50-12.80."
I wonder if Rivian truck sales will reduce F150 sales. Rivian thinks their valuation at IPO is $30 Billion higher than Ford’s current value.
ford can’t rely on china or japan for critical automotive parts. It is very obvious we need more car parts made domestically. every single part USA goal #1.
How many months of Ford vehicle order backlog? Will they even catch up with chip relief?
August Sales release on Sept 2 .
They will make 3 times the money this coming quarter than they did all year.
Doesn’t the f150 lightning have the ability to power your house ??
"Ford F150s with built in generators to the rescue in the aftermath of hurricane Ida. Innovation, innovation, innovation."
F held up very well today! She weathered the storm AGAIN. She handles everything thrown at her and comes back stronger. What an amazing company.
This is exactly why year after year Ford can never make consistent gains... Big Wall Street money avoids Ford because it is used as a short trade only. To many outstanding shares and short selling manipulation.
I’m buying more shares as soon as possible. I’m getting third job to exclusively buy more shares. This company is going to be huge.
"I can't believe! The Bronco reservations are so high, that Ford has to pause reservations for a while!That's what I call very high demand!"
"Ford will eventually hit that sweet spot. Wow, they are sending people to the dealership for advance orders of the new Bronco because the demand is so high, there are no chips...how can this company stay at $13 bucks a share once supply catches up with demand."
"Melt up continues likely.Electric mustang, soon elect trucks. Ford makes the best vehicles imo"
Ford is for trading only.. Ford will never be an investment long hold stock. Never
"How is the fantasy investing going in here? Great no doubt. I see Ford at over $1,000 in the near future, and a $1,000 per share dividend by next week."
"Pay no attention to the naysayers on this board. They bring up Ford’s “debt” and 4.5 B outstanding shares. That won’t matter when they are making BILLIONS and BILLIONS of $$$ in sales when chip shortage abates. Then, the big money comes in, and drives this stock upwards to $100 a share."
"If I was down to my last $100 bucks and I had to choice between food and F stock, it would be a hard decision, but I would choose F stock."
