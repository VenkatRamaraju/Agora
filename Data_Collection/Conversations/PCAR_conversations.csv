"Such a great company. This is a core holding, good growth over time and when the stock struggles, take the a cumulated dividends and buy more."
"Not wishing to rain on ay parades, but PCAR appears very reluctant to update on current part shortages. Both North American plants are on rolling shut down days. The latest part not to show up is thier chassis harness. preventing any attemps to part build. Trucks being built during this period are being parked long term due other part shortages and will be reworked later. One would assume they are unable to invoice incomplete trucks and total build number will be down for Q2 and Q3. This is the reality of the trucking building industry as of today. Huge demand, part shortages, delayed or unable to build, cost of rework and storage. Damage PCAR quality or bottom line, probably not as they will blow some sunshine."
PCAR reached a 52 Week high at 78.88
PCAR partnership with Aurora is terrific. This stock will rise a lot from here!! Future is bright baba says ;)
"I've held this for a half-century, buying more over the years. Wall Street ignores special dividends. When I'm buying an underpriced stock I don't consider that a problem. I don't like selling an underpriced stock but that won't happen with my Paccar holdings."
How about this for timing? Morgan Stanley just raised their target price from $64 o $67 while the stock is over $82. Genius.
300 million share buyback & earnings to double this year. If all it’s competitors similarly valued they should consider acquiring one of those.
The trade patterns possibly indicate manipulation to cover the 67.50 option which worked so well the last time they are going to shoot for 65.00 next. I filed a formal complaint with the SEC so we'll see what happens.
"So far in 2016 PCAR shares are up almost 42% plus dividends. You could say the 1-4-16 opening price of $46.50 was unusually low but this years gains are still pretty spectacular. Even more incredible, this occurred in a year where both revenues and earnings will be down (even if you take out the 833M fine) from the previous year. Apparently, the market is expecting a huge recovery for PCAR in 2017--I hope these expectations are correct."
This stock is undervalued with Aurora partnership. Buy on dip....
Special dividend is going to be $.70 this year. Far short of last year's $2.00--even PCAR couldn't over come the impact of the Corona virus.
$Amaz wld buy Pcar vehicles from themselves wld you not think? #Internal Consumption. #InstantMarket #Brand Exposure

"I believe their investment in Aurora is an awesome news!! Aurora is well managed company where founders are very intelligent and came from TSLA, Google and UBER with CMU background!! AMZN also has invested in Aurora!! Highly respected Aurorians!! Go Aurora....go PCAR!!!"

Why
"Cathie Woods totally unloaded her position. But, she has lost a lot of credibility with her fund down hard. She's nimble but hi momentum tech isn't where the market is.Paccar is blended tech and industrial so will keep truckin' so to speak. But, this isn't a value play either.Tough market to put money to work.Listen to last CC...it's helpful. Chip shortage is main concern rather than used truck pricing or margins."
ARK placeed position just before!!
News out is that they beat earnings and revenues... so why down so much? Did market expect bigger beat?
Hits down over 10% in month. That’s 50% in 4 months. Nice stock ahhhh ha haaa
Thanks for the early Christmas present Paccar $2.30 special dividend is very generous. Management has done an excellent job over the years. Keep up the good work.
"Was today the last day to get in on the dividend, or the close on Monday?"
Kenworth and Peterbilt are by far the most bad a%# looking trucks on the road!
"Expecting them to develop EV truck soon. Question, when?"
hopefully $90 today.
"Amazing stock, PCAR closes plants for 10 Days and has over 6000 trucks part built in storage and the stock is on the up. Creative management will no doubt reassure with Q4 profits."
"Suddenly realized that the operating cost of a truck that doesn't need a driver makes that truck much more valuable. (Of course PCAR won't get all of that difference. It'll be shared with the other ""stakeholders."")"
Boom! Going to 100 if trump does not get empeeched and we solve china deal. Please split it!
"So, a dollar extra on Tuesday, right?"
"""FTR releases preliminary Class 8 net orders for April at 23,600 units, maintaining the steady track that started seven months ago. While OEM activity was modestly better for some and down marginally for others month over month, April orders met expectations with a 4% increase over March and up 77% versus a year ago. Fleets are expecting better freight conditions in the second half of the year and current order activity reflects that. Backlogs should increase in April, getting close to where they were a year ago.

"I believe $NGA will easily be, or be better than $PCAR!!!"
breaking out above the 200 day
Peterbilt parking 120 incomplete trucks per day at Sanger facility due to chip shortage. Predicting 2 months of build dsiruption and invoicing. Suspect step sisters Kenworth and DAF have similar incomplete truck build stories. Its a great day to be in truck storage stock. Got to watch the Pcar Q1Q2 numbers given this development
"they will be referring to this as ""supply chain induced stagflation"""
"Where are we in the cycle? This is arguably the most cyclical stock out there. Q3 normally best for Paccar. It's been a bumpy year with tarrifs and NAFTA happenings. But really are we at a 2007 scenario yet with obvious peak? Interest rates have to go up and housing, auto, consumer, etc need to show peak. Until then, can't see sell on this."
Semiconductor shortage will go away. Stay focused don’t get emotional and sell then have future regrets. A ton of potential to rebound and grow. All in time just breathe.
market correction+GME Effect
"Daimler announced it is splitting into two companies, spinning off its truck manufacturing business. Paccar is up 4 percent. Daimler truck will still be a huge competitor, but may have fewer resources available. There might also be a period of adjustment while the newly independent Daimler Truck Co. reorganizes. It will likely emerge more focused. The first pre-production Tesla Semi showing minor design changes was spotted the other day traveling between Nevada and Fremont. Tesla Semi might be getting closer to production.Interesting times."

"This thing is going to drop like a stone. upper management not reacting to changing marketplace fast enough. Heavy discounting will need to happen to keep factories going. losing deals in field at record pace and management in disbelief of what the dealers are telling them. Game of cat and mouse gone wrong. Good luck longs, but get ready for low 50's for the next 18 months...."
Ark buys for the 27th straight day
Pcar is very slow mover. Ark keeps buying but it moves quitely slowly. I love this low-key kind of stocks with low per it might pop soon ( like Baidu)
"ARK opened a position, love it.I work for Paccar in Belgium"
"I'm in at the close $97.93 for an earnings play. Seems like Paccar is in the right business at the right time, we'll see tomorrow morning."
they have cash flow issues
"New truck revenue probably postponed because they have incomplete trucks waiting for chips. SEC rules state that revenue cannot be reccognized until "" The equipment or product must be complete and ready for shipment."""
What do you offer if i buy now?
2 more weeks until the wheels fall off....
There is a slide from Sanjay Shrestha saying “Push to Eliminate Diesel!!!Stationary Backup TAM increased to $37 Billion!!!Microsoft dragging their feet on Stationary???$PLUG Power is on the Planet for the “PUSH TO ELIMINATE DIESEL!!!” What are you waiting for Bill of $MSFT??? $PCAR $DE $CAT??? Add up the market caps for all the Buggy Whip diesel on the planet and REPLACE THAT WITH GREEN HYDROGEN PLUG POWER
This is down hard relative to peers. This is our last USA owned Class 8 mfg. Add in infrastructure Bill which will benefit this greatly. Why stuck in low gear seemingly permanently?
Ark just keeps buying. Look at past 12 months. Everything they buy keeps rising. Wow CATHY. Keep it going.
Peterbilt electric trucks in production. Eat your heart out Elon.
I've been a PCAR holder for 15 years and counting.
Was hoping for a major beat... but checking out earnings meeting for any signs of better growth coming.
earnings beat expectations stock goes down
nice choice for the partnership with Romeo power
"Street reaction to CAT earnings seen as peak of cycle. DE, CMI PCAR (anything on wheels) down in reaction. Bought more this morning as PCAR, at least is not at peak, has lower p/e and better balance sheet than others mentioned."
Looking for another $2.00+ Special dividend before Christmas.
just added another 100 k to my already 40k position...
"Rent your field, call PCAR they have trucks they need to park.Over 6,000 trucks incomplete built and in long term storage at Peterbilt and Kenworth at this point, with more on the way. Parts shortages causing long term disruption, quality issues and margin reduction as PCAR divisions struggle.Financially creative PCAR will no doubt turn this blip into positive news."
testing!! ?? does anyone think teslas electric trucks are effecting this stocks future prices? thanks...going to buy more this morning.
"In this week's Barron's Roundtable, Mario Gabelli recommends PCAR as an infrastructure play. His firm's earnings estimate is $6.20 per share in 2019, up from $5.10-5.20 this year and $4.40 in 2017.He also indicates that he thinks PCAR and IVECO, as two of the smaller European truck producers, will combine operations. Not sure I'd want PCAR to take on IVECO's problems, but PCAR did manage to turn DAF around so it might work. But at what price and on what terms? He doesn't offer any insight or opinion except that he thinks Sergio Marchionne would like to deal with IVECO (with a puny six percent market share) before he steps down."
4th quarter 20k trucks down my guess.....
what is the ticker for aurora? I always get aurora cannabis?
Things are looking bleak with production. Tough sledding ahead for the next 6 quarters.
I'm just an observer at this point. Barron's steered me over this way. On a historical basis PCAR is in bargain territory here. Chip shortage and driver shortage seem like a temporary problem to me. Barron's says PCAR has invested in hydrogen technology but I don't see anything on the website. Can someone fill me in? Thanks in advance.
PACCAR reached an all time high at 94.67
"Agreed, most Class 8 truck manufacturers look oversold here"
"Class 8 net orders for August came in at 20,700 units, 14% above July and 50% better than a year ago. Class 8 orders again met expectations as market momentum continues to build ahead of 2018. This is the best August order performance since 2014. North American Class 8 orders for the past twelve months have totaled 231,000 units.- Source FTRAlso, Eurostat revised upward GDP growth for the EU in Q2 led by the east.Finally, in case you missed it, NAV reported better than expected sales and earnings on Wednesday."
45 that's where I start.
My expectation is +75% till EOY and +200% end of 2023. What do you guys think?

PCAR reached a new 52 Week Low at $58.00
Daimler and Volvo both reported strong truck segment earnings today. Paccar moving up on the news.
"Today is dividend payment day for PCAR shareholders. Anyone care to forecast what the special will be? I'm going to guess it will be $.90/share. Incidentally, PCAR has more than recovered what it lost after the Tesla announcement. IMHO, the company continues to be a good long term holding for serious investors."
PCAR reached a 52 Week high at 75.45
Our share price should compete with $PCAR yes?
Breakout ATH!
PCAR reached a new All Time High at 79.58
I'll TRUMP that one ty
PACCAR reached an all time high at 89.52
huge back order for the new trucks.
"Founded by the Pigott family in 1905 as the Seattle Car Manufacturing Company, the PACCAR of 2021 is a global manufacturer of medium and heavy-duty commercial trucks. PACCAR has one of the best profitability metrics amongst industrial companies: its return on invested capital is industry leading. The company has been gaining market share on four continents over the past 20 years, and we think that the company is poised to continue gaining share.This year, PACCAR has one of its busiest years of new product launches ever. It has refreshed its medium and heavyduty Kenworth and Peterbilt products in North America for better aerodynamics in long-haul and to better meet the customer preferences in medium duty. It is also launching commercial, short-haul electric trucks in Europe and North America, its first commercial step in the company’s zero emission programs.We’re also very impressed with PACCAR’s replacement parts strategy and execution. The Parts business has been a steady 6% revenue grower over the past 15 years, but this year we expect it to grow at around three times that rate. These replacement parts are the high-margin consumables for the installed base of PACCAR commercial trucks, and their profitability is well above the company average (the Parts business is approximately one-third of PACCAR’s total profits ). Management has worked over time to increase its propriety parts content on each truck, and there’s consequently more demand pull for replacement parts from the existing fleet now. Moreover, billions of dollars of invested capital in its independent dealer base and its parts distribution centers over the past decade have positioned the company to capitalize on this demand. Semiconductor shortages may be holding back new passenger car and commercial truck production, but parts demand for the existing fleet is running hot. We think the culmination of these past investments and the current environment position PACCAR to enjoy a beneficial step-up in a metric we track: net income per truck produced.As a result of these factors, the stock looks attractively priced to us. Perhaps others are concerned about potential new entrant products from Tesla or Nikola, but our seasoned view is that PACCAR’s own technology advancements, service and distribution infrastructure, reputation, and low-cost manufacturing position will win with commercial fleet customers that care about uptime and total cost of ownership. The stock trades at less than 14x what we think earnings will average over the next couple years, which in turn, is just 60% of the earnings multiple of the S&P 500. We think that’s too cheap for this best-in-class, highly innovative industrial leader."""
A major redesign of Yahoo Finance has resulted in the end of the traditional message board. Sad day for regular posters on the PCAR board.
Will Paccar ever recover?
I own few paccar trucks they are so good on fuel
"PCAR reports record profits and revenues, beats top and bottom line expectations, and triples profits from year ago quarter. The stock is down over 1% after 2 1/2 hours of trading. Doesn't make any sense what-so-ever."
PCAR reached a 52 Week low at 60.48
im a 16 year holder of PCAR and just keep watching my dividends get reinvested.
"I live up near the Pcar testing area in Skagit county WA, there sure a lot of Paccar trucks driving around in black and white camo. and they are all electric or hydrogen, anit no exhaust pipe on any of them. just saying with a PE of 25 seems cheap"
PCAR is down 5.47% to $57.19
cha ching! cha ching! cha ching!
hoping for a stock split...3 for 2 always happens when stock above 80 for some time
That time of year when Board of Directors will be considering the special dividend. Anyone care to speculate on how much? Will be hard to beat last year's $2.00/share.
This is an 85+ dollar stock.
and the warning from PCAR comes out yesterday. I hate being right. unfortunately this is going to go on all through next year(why they laid off 750 production workers permanently)... 4th quarter will be worst on record ever....
The usual close
"On the earnings call demand very strong. A lot of questions about chip shortages. Overall doing good, but revenue weaker than it could be because they are waiting on parts to complete orders."
Another work week begins with a ten day plant closing due to lack of parts.
"I see Pcar happy news continues. Mr J Goebbels would be proud to be part of Pcar.The comapny continues to park trucks in long term shorage due to parts shortages. This amounts to almost all current daily production. Q2 results should make interesting reading, without being able to invoice customers for completed trucks, and Pacfinance unable to lend customers funds to complete the transaction the process begins to full apart. Maybe Paclease will buy some of the incomplete trucks with Pacfinance funds to increase lending and truck operation profits, not like that hasnt been done before in the industry. Electric trucks, yes they have orders, can they build them with the electric sector ramping up and shortages? Do they really work, maybe. Buyer beware."
No more reading from that union whack job Billy Thomas. I like the new format.
"PACCAR (PCAR) reported record annual revenues and profitability in 2018 and has achieved an impressive 80 consecutive years of net income,”"
Tesla electric semi will make Paccar trucks look like steam engines. old and obsolete.
Go PAC Go
If 3 day build weeks and 400 employee layoff wasnt bad enough. I am wondering how they will account for the thousands of incomplete built trucks in secret storage all over north texas. Without parts these wont get completed in Q4. Not to worry though investors in pcar have no sense of reality. Guessing its the same a Kenworth too. Same shared parts bin.
"So, why is ARK buying Paccar? Tesla cann't produce good electrical semi truck?"
"Ark invested and this goes up another 5% AH, lol"
The other day a dump truck turning right turned right into me changing lanes on a 2-lane road. The driver said it wouldn't have happened if he had a little peep window to look through in the passenger door. He said most trucks have it but these newer Kenworth don't. Why not?????
Heard on the news Tesla is giving up on its self driving electric truck. Musk/SpaceX is now selling tickets for trips to the moon. Can anyone tell me where to sign up and send my money?
2020 truck market projections look to shave 30% off of current production rates. Hold onto your hats next quarter.
I bought 100 shares for $99.20. I hope Paccar just keep increasing until $900 like Tesla.
Its finally moving
"I think I'll definitely be able to start a long position near 60 after the next 2 quarterly earnings... q1 will not look horrific, but q2 forward doesn't look good to me. Build rates are dropping as well as overall demand. Skirt through election year with potential downturn in 2021 or later seems to cap any upside on this position near term. imo"
I'm thinking $5 share eps x 15 multiple = $75 per share would be start of entry point.....
Expecting 1.75 or better earnings based on past results. The problem is that the stock looks priced in near a multi year resistance so it might just trade flat.
PACCAR reached an all time high at 96.83
Bought today with funds j liquidated from CNI. Not sure why the drop but like prospects. This is the last US based manufacturer of Class 5-8 trucks. That’s with Navistar being acquired by TRATON. That has to matter in contract negotiations and US government purchases.
ok what's happen here?
"Daimler warned on earnings today, but .... ""One of the few bright spots in the quarter will be Daimler Trucks, the maker of Freightliner and Western Star trucks. The division is expected to report EBIT of 0.7 billion euros, a year-over-year increase of 0.2 billion euros. Additionally, the 2019 outlook for the unit remains unchanged with return on sales expected to be in the 7 to 9 percent range."" (Source for quoted text, Freightwaves website.)"
"ARK keeps increasing. I work for Paccar in Belgium. And I love ARK, how funny is this"
i see more pcar products on the side of the road with the pcar driveline than EVER . we never had this issue at pete Tennessee because we never installed JUNK. which is WHY our stock went to 112 a share in the 90's though it is denied and lied about on this board for whatever the reason.
Only building trucks 3 days a week with parts shortages at Peterbikt factory. Build rate down 30% from 1st quarter.

Will diesel stay around long term with growth in the face of new tech companies like Tesla and Nikola
https://discord.gg/DtK2qrme
Continues to be undervalued.
"An article in Barron's stated that Tesla received a preorder from UPS for 125 trucks. Tesla has also received preorders from Walmart, PepsiCo, and Anheuser-Busch. Each preorder requires a $20,000 deposit and the selling price of each new semi will start at $150,000. I wonder if these companies will ever see delivery of these trucks or if they will ever see their deposit money again."
"Goldman Analysts downgrades PCAR yet récord truck sales, Trump tax cut for Corp. taxes and write offs for purchase new trucks means PCAR will sell every truck they can make. IMHO GS analysts is a nit wit."
