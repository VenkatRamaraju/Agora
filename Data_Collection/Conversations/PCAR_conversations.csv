"PACCAR (PCAR) reported record annual revenues and profitability in 2018 and has achieved an impressive 80 consecutive years of net income,”"
I've been a PCAR holder for 15 years and counting.
testing!! does anyone read this? why they down turn on good earnings?
"ARK opened a position, love it.I work for Paccar in Belgium"
If 3 day build weeks and 400 employee layoff wasnt bad enough. I am wondering how they will account for the thousands of incomplete built trucks in secret storage all over north texas. Without parts these wont get completed in Q4. Not to worry though investors in pcar have no sense of reality. Guessing its the same a Kenworth too. Same shared parts bin.
and the warning from PCAR comes out yesterday. I hate being right. unfortunately this is going to go on all through next year(why they laid off 750 production workers permanently)... 4th quarter will be worst on record ever....
"I've held this for a half-century, buying more over the years. Wall Street ignores special dividends. When I'm buying an underpriced stock I don't consider that a problem. I don't like selling an underpriced stock but that won't happen with my Paccar holdings."
Thanks for the early Christmas present Paccar $2.30 special dividend is very generous. Management has done an excellent job over the years. Keep up the good work.
huge back order for the new trucks.
I bought 100 shares for $99.20. I hope Paccar just keep increasing until $900 like Tesla.
Only building trucks 3 days a week with parts shortages at Peterbikt factory. Build rate down 30% from 1st quarter.
"Rent your field, call PCAR they have trucks they need to park.Over 6,000 trucks incomplete built and in long term storage at Peterbilt and Kenworth at this point, with more on the way. Parts shortages causing long term disruption, quality issues and margin reduction as PCAR divisions struggle.Financially creative PCAR will no doubt turn this blip into positive news."
"Amazing stock, PCAR closes plants for 10 Days and has over 6000 trucks part built in storage and the stock is on the up. Creative management will no doubt reassure with Q4 profits."
That time of year when Board of Directors will be considering the special dividend. Anyone care to speculate on how much? Will be hard to beat last year's $2.00/share.
Another work week begins with a ten day plant closing due to lack of parts.
"PCAR reports record profits and revenues, beats top and bottom line expectations, and triples profits from year ago quarter. The stock is down over 1% after 2 1/2 hours of trading. Doesn't make any sense what-so-ever."
I'm just an observer at this point. Barron's steered me over this way. On a historical basis PCAR is in bargain territory here. Chip shortage and driver shortage seem like a temporary problem to me. Barron's says PCAR has invested in hydrogen technology but I don't see anything on the website. Can someone fill me in? Thanks in advance.
4th quarter 20k trucks down my guess.....
"Founded by the Pigott family in 1905 as the Seattle Car Manufacturing Company, the PACCAR of 2021 is a global manufacturer of medium and heavy-duty commercial trucks. PACCAR has one of the best profitability metrics amongst industrial companies: its return on invested capital is industry leading. The company has been gaining market share on four continents over the past 20 years, and we think that the company is poised to continue gaining share.This year, PACCAR has one of its busiest years of new product launches ever. It has refreshed its medium and heavyduty Kenworth and Peterbilt products in North America for better aerodynamics in long-haul and to better meet the customer preferences in medium duty. It is also launching commercial, short-haul electric trucks in Europe and North America, its first commercial step in the company’s zero emission programs.We’re also very impressed with PACCAR’s replacement parts strategy and execution. The Parts business has been a steady 6% revenue grower over the past 15 years, but this year we expect it to grow at around three times that rate. These replacement parts are the high-margin consumables for the installed base of PACCAR commercial trucks, and their profitability is well above the company average (the Parts business is approximately one-third of PACCAR’s total profits ). Management has worked over time to increase its propriety parts content on each truck, and there’s consequently more demand pull for replacement parts from the existing fleet now. Moreover, billions of dollars of invested capital in its independent dealer base and its parts distribution centers over the past decade have positioned the company to capitalize on this demand. Semiconductor shortages may be holding back new passenger car and commercial truck production, but parts demand for the existing fleet is running hot. We think the culmination of these past investments and the current environment position PACCAR to enjoy a beneficial step-up in a metric we track: net income per truck produced.As a result of these factors, the stock looks attractively priced to us. Perhaps others are concerned about potential new entrant products from Tesla or Nikola, but our seasoned view is that PACCAR’s own technology advancements, service and distribution infrastructure, reputation, and low-cost manufacturing position will win with commercial fleet customers that care about uptime and total cost of ownership. The stock trades at less than 14x what we think earnings will average over the next couple years, which in turn, is just 60% of the earnings multiple of the S&P 500. We think that’s too cheap for this best-in-class, highly innovative industrial leader."""
