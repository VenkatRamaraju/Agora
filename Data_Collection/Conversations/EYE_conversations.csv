"THESE GUYS ARE Going to be ""disrupted"" by Ocumetics with their new bionic lens allowing you to see 60/20 vision, It's simply a silicone lens that goes in the eye via a simple lasik type surgery but that it's design is such that it is ""mechanically"" leveraged to use 1/100th of the eye muscle power and therefore even an 80yr old with really bad eyesight will be able to focus and see 60/20 vision . Their technology has finished all testing and being released in a few countries in the next 6mths or so. Loading up on this stock and also can't wait to be rid of my annoying glasses."

"It looks like the management at EYE are doing their job. The numbers were about what I expected. I had rather see a slow steady gain in the stock price, than a yoyo looking chart. I believe the trend in eye care will continue to show profits for a company that takes care of its customers. Good luck to all who are long."

"@Thien. You said the price stock was to high last month. I believe it will go up if the management can perform and show a profit when earnings come out. That will be the key to the stock price of this stock. I bought shares at $32.45 yesterday, wanted to get in after missing the day before at a low on the start of the trading day. I am okay with my entry price, I would buy more today if I had the loose money to do it with. I didn't realize there was the number of companies there were out there that provide eye exams and eye care until I needed the service. I researched when I was looking for a eye care specialist. There are many that are private, not all of them are up to the standard they need to be. Since this company choose to go public I am hopeful they will provide the care and pricing that will be good for the company and the consumer. There are more older people like myself now that need eye care more than ever before. Most of my Grandkids have already had to have glasses, just my opinion."
