Another good quarter. This company rocks!
"Robert, I believe you may have misunderstood the lay-off announcement, it wasn't IPGP that laid off employees, it was their property neighbor, Technetics, who subsequently sold the property to IPGP for future expansion. Technetics claimed current market conditions as the cause and as this was announced on July 10th and there was no mention of issues concerning the trade tariffs I think you may have extrapolated the actual meaning of the statement."
Bizarre. Stocks typically go UP when being added to the S&P 500 as that requires all the massive index funds to have to buy the fully weighted position by the day they are added
Anyone else think this could head back over $250 after earnings?
Nearly 10% off highs... Looking for an entry price because long term is very bright. Whatâ€™s your target for buying or adding?
"Market finally getting around to cleaning house, but every stock getting hit indiscriminately. IPGP is a great company and stock is undervalued here. If it falls below $125 I'm backing up the truck again like I did a month ago."
"I bought more, i don't think it will fall much more, the p/e is justified"
"""Q4 net income was $53 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.96, as charges related tothe 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced net income by $49 million and EPS by $0.90."" IPQP annual report. Can somoen tell me how the 21018 tax act caused a LOSS?"
Report looks terrific... why so much of drop in pre market? Any idea?
just bought. 132@
IPGP belongs to 200+ based on fundamentals and fundamentals always prevail in the long-run
"I just HAD to sell 1/4 of my position today.Up 100% this year.I used to trade seevral Laser stocks but liked IPGP due to their lead in Fibre lasers. Used to hold some RSTI, still hold a lot of IIVI(which has lost it's way and haven't added in years). Used to follow 2 others and sometimes trade them.IPGP is just about parabolic.I haven't bought IPGP since Jan 2013 or sold any since Nov 2013.It's always prudent to book some profit.""scale in, scale out, online commissions are cheap""Good luck folks..."
"Meanwhile, Apple who depends on China for 20% of all revenues and pretty much their entire supply chain goes to new all time highs, markets rigged."
"It's days like this that longs wait for! This a great buying opportunity for a terrific company! Due your DD and you'll find by any metric that this is undervalued at this point. There are a lot of stocks that don't deserve their share price in this overheated market, but IPGP is not one of them!"
"Could be a long day, they are starting to drop the whole sector now, we might very well break 135 by mid-day, thought they were just fishing for a quick drop to run it back up, looks like they see this thing on the ropes and want to take it to the mat, so they will try and drive it hard. Of course they will jump in at some point and drive it hard upwards for awhile but when that occurs who knows. I'm now betting bottom today is 135, top is 148."
"P, somehow I doubt your storyline, I do believe you are a fan of IPGP and I believe it is justified, but I believe you have been buying for a long time and losing for a long time. Even today after you said that you bought for the first time in over 18 months, even though you said you bought when it went under 125 15 days ago, you were wrong, today we are down over three dollars on a decent day, so far at least, though I trust it will change."
can anyone shed some light on whats going with COHR price drop the last few days?
Preannouncement - warning sign or opportunity?
"I would be interested in folks thoughts on the COHR earnings call vs. IPGP. COHR said that their lasers for OLED manufacture will be down next year, but their other laser lines will be up substantially. This includes their fiber lasers (obtained via purchase of RSTI) which they said are doing very well. COHR sells many fewer fiber lasers than IPGP, so they are starting from a smaller base. One possibility is that COHR and IPGP fiber lasers are used in different markets, while the other is that COHR is gaining market share (presumably at IPGP's expense). I currently own some COHR and am interested in IPGP - I owned some shares in the past, but unfortunately sold the stock before the large increase in share price. Again, comments appreciated."
"Looking at IPGP's Balance Sheet indicates lots of available cash with very manageable debt. Why would investors also be in COHR? COHR has more total debt than total cash. I see so many post that they have shares of both, why?"
"I'm not really sure why this stock is up from $120-$142 in 5 trading days. They warned for next quarter, and margins are down. China and the US are supposedly still negotiating, but they're clearly a long way off from any substantive deal."
"I was seriously going to sell this thing this morning and then I look into it, only to find another big down turn. I got in during the 155's a while back, missed the selling opportunity and now got hung out to dry! Any predictions on what this is going to do next week?"
Earnings release tomorrow
"It was good to see it regain the 156 mark again but to be honest with you, the funds and the shorts own the tech sector and mainly the equipment provider sector of semi. With that being said, it is entirely possible that they drive the laser sector down to the other equipment providers level - AMAT and LCRX and that means cutting the prices of COHR and IPGP by half."
"I doubled down way too early.Pain. Hurt. Ouch.Oh well, the Hawaiian vacation will have to be changed to a vacation at motel 6 somewhere in the hills of Tennessee."
After hours someone bought/sold 53000 shares. Not a small patato.I hope optical downturn is close to the end and turn around is close.
"They missed their earnings estimates, beat on revenue, guidance is in-line. I'm not sure why it's up so much today."
$160 today
"Well, that's definitely a hit. Can't listen to the call.Seems like all about China a lot of it directly.Took a hit but still not below any of my cost basis on any of my buys so not adding here yet.And could be part of a tell for IIVI in a few weeks."
"Ok, so wait...they reported in line results and very downbeat guidance, way less on the top and bottom line due to geopolitical, currency, and tariffs. These headwinds will effect the company with uncertainty in the foreseeable future. All that, and yet the stock is up 8% on the day. Got it, now I understand the markets. Although I'm sure the move is nothing more than short covering given the broader market move today, my question is why would anyone cover?"
"Does IPG have programmable power fiber lasers comparable to the ""Corona"" product announced this morning by nLight?"
on the way back to atleast 195!
"84 % of float held by institutional, that is 32 ml. shares, yet only 4 millions were traded today, it means big cats are NOT dumping, I think it is a good buy once small potatoes finish selling."
"What is going on today.. I keep thinking things are moving with the probability of tax reform, but then today S&P up, but tech down big? IPGP even has a comprehensible P/E."
"Though I'm still in, I am beyond frustrated that an equity goes down big when earnings are out. I have no problem when warranted, but if it's some metric that automatically trips and then huge price moves with small volume.. something is rotten.. and it's not a company's earnings or forecasts."
"There a many of these drive-by selloffs occurring recently. Look at Coherent recently and Arista Networks today. These have always proved to be points at which to add shares. They are like portals to a profit universe that open and close periodically. I was able to bottom feed, adding shares at $228.74 & $235.93 this morning."
close 163-165
"I can't say I usually understand the major moves this stock can have on a given day in either direction, but the overall trend is great."
Any insight on the competitive posture of IPGP versus Nlight the newly public company?
