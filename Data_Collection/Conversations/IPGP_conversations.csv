IPG Photonics reached a 52 Week high at 249.52
Being accumulated?
Boom. Is that a beat or is that a beat?
IPGP is down -5.00% to 246.11
just bought. 132@
"Short % of Float (Jan 31, 2019) 4 16.81%this stock is in a short squeeze, hold your stocks"
close 163-165
IPGP told the truth about the world economy and what is going on...no sugar coating b.s. as other corporate executives have done. Sadly we paid a price for it. I believe temporary as in 6 months. But with today's market players that is an eternity.
"Probably will fall in to 120-130 region, because ex acquisition revenue would have been less that 300mil. Maybe I am wrong as 140 is attractive price, and seems that bad guidance was priced in already."
"what's going on? good result and good Q1 forecast, sell on news?"
"This surprises me a little, thought they were going to push it up again before tanking it, guess since they are tanking all of the other equipment providers they have to tank it as well to provide some form of logic or reason."
IPGP is down -5.30% to 233.66
"Crazy sell off after the LDD acquisition. Unless IPGP gave LDD a substantial amount of stock in the deal, the 10+% drop doesn't make sense. If it was a cash deal, it really doesn't make sense that IPGP would have such a large drop."
"Can't seem to hold 165, looks like we may be establishing a tight trading range here, buy under 160 and sell once it goes over 165. Repeat, repeat, repeat."
Crazy situation! excellent results
"I guess the CEO's trust, The Valentin Gapontsev Trust, had pretty good timing selling 32,000 shares for $7,818,667 (@ $244 per share). This was done 0-3 months ago, from the historical information, it looks like in June, guess someone knew the market was not going to be too happy with the numbers."
"Just sayin':Shaggy16 days ago@Astro not sure about that, they both will have a lot of volatility but I really think they have made the shift, so we may see the two trend lines diverge for awhile, I think they drive COHR back up to 250 and IPGP stays in a tight trading range of between 155 to 185, but it will center around 160 to 170. I hope for your sake it doesn't, I am just saying what I believe is happening right now. This could continue until next quarter's earnings."
Going under 200 today....
What happened!!!!
Great discounted price. Thanks
IPGP reached a 52 Week low at 103.07
Fans of the company should had been buying at 162 levels.
Is IPGP overvalued at current levels? I started receiving notifications from awe-someSTOCKS the other week and so far they have presented interesting new trade ideas.
"There's absolutely nothing wrong with this company or COHR or IIVI or NOVT or AMAT or LCRX, the funds and broker houses have focused on AMD, AAPL, NVDA and OLED, while pounding this sector, they are reaching a point with AAPL and AMD that they will have to swing into other trades as it will be impossible to justify those grossly inflated prices. Will the equipment sector be the winner or the semis, not sure though it looks like they are setting both up for a slow gain, we shall see who the big money chooses to win the next gain up. Don't get caught up with the fundamentals, they have nothing to do with this market."
Any insight on the competitive posture of IPGP versus Nlight the newly public company?
his life simply by altering his attitude of mind.http://dataunion.tistory.com/9571
IPGP is down -5.11% to 228.22
yo yo stock
180 today
"1.3 Billion order is indicative of the IOT, data center markets are strong"
"Wow, this will be at the 52 week low by end of day, didn't think that would happen."
Interesting that no one is predicting 220 by the end of this month yet. Wonder why?
"Horrible guidance, and now the stock is up. The market is crazy."
"I just HAD to sell 1/4 of my position today.Up 100% this year.I used to trade seevral Laser stocks but liked IPGP due to their lead in Fibre lasers. Used to hold some RSTI, still hold a lot of IIVI(which has lost it's way and haven't added in years). Used to follow 2 others and sometimes trade them.IPGP is just about parabolic.I haven't bought IPGP since Jan 2013 or sold any since Nov 2013.It's always prudent to book some profit.""scale in, scale out, online commissions are cheap""Good luck folks..."
180 end of the day!!!
IPGP is down 17.38% to $108.51
IPGP reached a new All Time High at 254.41
"Leonel, very, very close my friend, it only dropped to 163.99 and seems like it recovered nicely, so you were actually within 5 cents, so good call."
"I also own OLED (not for those weak of heart), another early (Gardner recommendation. Both IPGP have somewhat similar very long term chart patterns that clearly reveal distinct growth stages. Today their lasers are cheaper, more efficient, and relatively maintenance free. Changes in tax law should increase the rate of market penetration as older/obsolete units are replaced by fiber lasers. I'm holding."
After hours someone bought/sold 53000 shares. Not a small patato.I hope optical downturn is close to the end and turn around is close.
hahahahahaha
Should be a great quarter for them. Can't wait for the earnings beat and the massive projections going forward.
"Oh my gosh, now it it pushing a thirty dollar swing, unbelievable. How can anyone actually trust these markets?"
beats wall street expectations but down 10%? Am i missing something?
"Going short, will go under 200....."
"Remember now, sell at 167, it could happen by end of day, COHR and NOVT both tracking well."
What..
"'it means big cats are NOT dumping, ""Truly an outstanding post!IF the ""big cats"" were in fact dumping,the shares would have dropped over $100 points.Hey Jane, take up knitting.nt"
"Old Skool, IPGP just happens to be one of the stocks of the day, that the traders are dumping harder than others to create the next buying opportunity. They dump a stock hard with the aid of HFT and then drive it back up the next day or the next week depending on how quickly and how much they want to make on the swing trades."
IPG Photonics reached a 52 Week high at 197.36
Looks like a nice Beat. Hopefully back over 150 soon. GLTA
"There has to be more than we are just hearing, they hire 25 to 40 people a week and have a list of open positions a mile long. Must know something more than they are admitting to."
"Ok, so wait...they reported in line results and very downbeat guidance, way less on the top and bottom line due to geopolitical, currency, and tariffs. These headwinds will effect the company with uncertainty in the foreseeable future. All that, and yet the stock is up 8% on the day. Got it, now I understand the markets. Although I'm sure the move is nothing more than short covering given the broader market move today, my question is why would anyone cover?"
"Robert, I believe you may have misunderstood the lay-off announcement, it wasn't IPGP that laid off employees, it was their property neighbor, Technetics, who subsequently sold the property to IPGP for future expansion. Technetics claimed current market conditions as the cause and as this was announced on July 10th and there was no mention of issues concerning the trade tariffs I think you may have extrapolated the actual meaning of the statement."
Market in general is weak and this is manufacturing related(cyclical). Doesn't help that most manufacturing is still in China and China isn't friendly toward American companies during trade war.
"Earnings report sounded good, so why the drop ?"
Keep an eye on this...it will be a great buy a couple months down the road..
"Wow, this could be a major move if it holds above 165 for the remainder of the week, otherwise, it is just like COHR, AMAT and LRCX."
IPG Photonics reached a 52 Week high at 238.30
This is unbelievable
Wow
is it going under 200 today?....
IPGP is up 7.19% to 175.83
"While I appreciate the fact that you allowed it to break 157 and now it is down less than 4 bucks on the day, I still ain't buying it, it's a set up."
"Well, that's definitely a hit. Can't listen to the call.Seems like all about China a lot of it directly.Took a hit but still not below any of my cost basis on any of my buys so not adding here yet.And could be part of a tell for IIVI in a few weeks."
Hope they have something more positive to say on conference call. Starts in one minute. I'll be listening. That said I can see where macroeconomic factors and tariff uncertainty are hitting their non USA business hard right now. Until those issues are resolved (if they are) it will be a tougher environment for all businesses and a drag on entire world economy. Trump is a stable genius.
"actually not too bad, probably end down 3-4% for day"
Why is it selling off today on no volume?
"Estimates are very low, probability is there to meet them, but if not, it can get some harder beating."
Is this just a dead cat bounce? Not sure if I can trust this stock anymore.
glad I sold IPGP at $232.50 earlier this year....I thought it was looking toppy
IPGP reached a new 52 Week Low at $127.61
Did they announce a massive share buyback to put a floor on the price? No. Why? Because they care about you!
"84 % of float held by institutional, that is 32 ml. shares, yet only 4 millions were traded today, it means big cats are NOT dumping, I think it is a good buy once small potatoes finish selling."
"The interesting thing here is the laser sector as a whole is just very odd trading. IPGP and ESIO both had very strong volumes, both obviously dropped, yet ESIO, COHR, LASR and IIVI were down hard as well but on very low volumes for the entire group, not even close to daily volumes and on a strongly negative day in the tech sector you would expect much higher volumes. Not sure what that implies, just interesting."
"P, somehow I doubt your storyline, I do believe you are a fan of IPGP and I believe it is justified, but I believe you have been buying for a long time and losing for a long time. Even today after you said that you bought for the first time in over 18 months, even though you said you bought when it went under 125 15 days ago, you were wrong, today we are down over three dollars on a decent day, so far at least, though I trust it will change."
"It's anyone's guess what IPGP reports...the talking heads say we're heading into a downturn with trade headwinds, China economy slowing down. I think this is a good company with a strong future but tomorrow may suck further. BUT...the chip companies came roaring back, AAPL came back...but those companies are intrinsic to the casino aspect of market."
$160 today
Why the big pe. I don’t see similar in laser materials or telecom spaces where they play ?
"Probably will be hammered in sympathy with COHR tomorrow and then factor into the equation the mid terms and wow, this could be a very bad day tomorrow and even going into Wednesday as the election results become fully known. Man, might be wise to just dump everything and take your lumps and get back in after the dust settles."
a gift.....!
"Sell, sell, sell. Covering under 200...."
Gonna be pounded down by shorts for now until major news.
I will happens same as klac and the other semi
Why so much short interest in this?
Nearly 10% off highs... Looking for an entry price because long term is very bright. What’s your target for buying or adding?
"going much higher. I'm a buyer at this ~$130 price. It is undervalued for longs. Sure, tariffs and Chinese economy slowing will bite into revenue growth in the near term, but nothing has fundamentally changed in their business. Still selling lasers in high demand; still moving into other verticals (medical, microelectronics, defense, etc.); still high margins with good moat. Competition is still many years behind with less capital for future investment. Don't panic - buy!"
"So this is interesting, they must be trying to get people to jump into this, they do this with COHR about once a month and then they tank it."
COHR up after the close. Could be an indicator of the group.
Held up well today with markets down 3-3.5% after China devaluing. IPGP only down .37% to 118.06. Now IPGP had been on a slide the past few weeks like a lot of stocks with China exposure. And I expected that to continue today.
$170 soon?
"Well is there a possible buy out coming, or what ? I know it has a small float but they dropped the stock to $200 a short time ago and now its off to the races. That reminds me of somebody shaking the bushes to grab shares before announcing a buy out. Just thinking out loud here."
Pre ER run ? Volume is too low for that. What's happening ?
wicked civ stock
I think it's fair to say this stock is oversold.
IPG Photonics reached a 52 Week high at 173.50
on the way back to atleast 195!
This was one the fastest run ups in price that I've seen in a long while. I had never made this much money so quickly and now I am going to have a great family Christmas with my profits. I love IPGP.....................
Yesterday https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-army-tripling-power-laser-192214966.htmlMilitary Laser article
"great company, decent balance sheet for a grower, I like it at this price"
"Friday 3/2/18 after close it was announced that IPGP will be added to the S&P 500 replacing Scripps.Crazy market volatility the past few weeks, IPGP has held up rather well.This S&P thing can be nothing but a positive and maybe add to a short term pop in the price. IPGP closed at 244.80 slightly up in a basically even(but wild) market Friday"
What happened today? Was there a downgrade?
Bizarre. Stocks typically go UP when being added to the S&P 500 as that requires all the massive index funds to have to buy the fully weighted position by the day they are added
"Wow, shocking they didn't preannounce! They are losing the technology while leading people to believe they had a technological advantage. The management just tried to hide reality until the last minute. Geez! We are going to see some huge revisions in estimates. Investors were expecting to see over $431 million for Q3. Now, IPG Photonics comes out and says they should have been expecting sales in the range of $360-$390 million for Q3. That is a huge amount of missing revenue. Did they take some of it back to Russia? The bottom fell out and they have been misleading investors and keeping it secret or someone embezzled the assets.Even worse, analysts were expecting $2.28 per bloated share for Q3, and now IPGP is saying it will actually be in the range of 1.80-$2.05 per share. What a diasppointment. Now you know why Tim Mammen was selling at $250 per share. How many shareholder lawsuits do you think will be coming?!?"
IPG Photonics reached a 52 Week high at 224.89
"I love this! First time in a long while that IPGP is aggressively buying back stock. From the press release: ""the company repurchased 371 thousand shares for $61 million"". That means management has faith that the company is fairly priced at an average $164 per share as an ongoing entity (not for sale). Currently, trading at about a $40 or 24% discount to that price. Folks, this is a short-term tariff and trade story, nothing has changed in the business model. BUY!"
I never seen any companies announced Preliminary Financial result three weeks ahead of time to scare the investors. Why did they do that? Why don’t they just do it once on Oct 29th? Is it their strategies to acquire their own stock at cheaper price?
"Not touching this today, think they will try and drive prices down through at least mid-day tomorrow, really didn't think they would be able to keep the downward pressure on the tech sector this long and hard. Rather impressive, the funds must have united to pull off this much of a drop, yet with computerized trading two brokerages working in unison could trade 1 billion shares between themselves and not experience a single dime in losses meanwhile taking the market down by over one percent. Then they sit on their positions for a week allow the stocks to stabilize and climb in lower volumes and start to dump at sizable profits."
Earnings release tomorrow
Dead cat bounce....
"Does IPG have programmable power fiber lasers comparable to the ""Corona"" product announced this morning by nLight?"
I think this stock will benefit from the coming space wars... applications of its technologies in the form of commercial communications and military weaponry will be very interesting to watch. The strength of the US economy relative the rest of the world should allow us to outspend our rivals and gain superiority for our protection and the peace of the world.
Preannouncement - warning sign or opportunity?
Next month we should see some profit taking (so do not get worried) this is done in January because you have the entire year before filing taxes for 2018 and paying on your profits.
"Nope, 155 solid bottom for now."
Little pop before it drop....
"P, this thing only goes down until the elections, then it depends on how the elections finish up. Republicans keep both houses, they continue to tank the stock, Split the houses, they stabilize the prices and then allow them to slowly creep up but not to old levels, they win both houses (Liberals that is) and they allow the prices to explode upward to reward the small investors for voting the way the wealthy overlords want us to."
"Well, going under 200 tomorrow...."
"Along with many other applications, laser weapons represent a paradigm shift of epic proportion, companies with the expertise will be worth a lot of $. This stock is behaving like it wants to go higher."
"This was a great company that grew a little to fast but over the next few years it should turn back, great management.."
Will go under 160?...
This market is merciless on companies that miss on any level.
A lots to cover fort shorts......
"Never know anymore if you can trust the moves in any of the stocks in this sector, with the buy out of the weakest brother ESIO you would think that it would be getting strong moves upwards just in sympathy, but it seems like everytime we have a good move up, we have a worse one down. Same with COHR and NOVT."
Who wins IPGP or COHR? I own both.
"I've been a long in IPGP since 2009 (by long, I mean I usually buy with 10+ year outlook). Never sold a share even with the run-up above $200 because I see it"
"Their downside revenue guide was disappointing, so I'm not sure why it bounced back so much yesterday."
Why the big pop today?
"Hope you bought in at end of day Old Skool, I just sold when I was up 5%. The games that the Wall Street boys and girls play."
"I would be interested in folks thoughts on the COHR earnings call vs. IPGP. COHR said that their lasers for OLED manufacture will be down next year, but their other laser lines will be up substantially. This includes their fiber lasers (obtained via purchase of RSTI) which they said are doing very well. COHR sells many fewer fiber lasers than IPGP, so they are starting from a smaller base. One possibility is that COHR and IPGP fiber lasers are used in different markets, while the other is that COHR is gaining market share (presumably at IPGP's expense). I currently own some COHR and am interested in IPGP - I owned some shares in the past, but unfortunately sold the stock before the large increase in share price. Again, comments appreciated."
laser projector seems are the future.
"Meanwhile, Apple who depends on China for 20% of all revenues and pretty much their entire supply chain goes to new all time highs, markets rigged."
company not looking good revenues are slow and no orders coming in some departments
"I was beginning to think that we had established a good floor for a trading range at the 160 mark, with the dip this morning below that range, I am still waiting to see if that is truly the firm bottom or is it lower before paying the buy at 160 and sell at 165 or 170 mark and repeating on every dip. If it holds then I may pay that for awhile as it appears to me that IPGP has become the new COHR and is horribly range bound."
Any reason why so much drop recently? looks like a nice buy right now
Anyone else think this could head back over $250 after earnings?
"Could be a long day, they are starting to drop the whole sector now, we might very well break 135 by mid-day, thought they were just fishing for a quick drop to run it back up, looks like they see this thing on the ropes and want to take it to the mat, so they will try and drive it hard. Of course they will jump in at some point and drive it hard upwards for awhile but when that occurs who knows. I'm now betting bottom today is 135, top is 148."
Here coming 200.....
"this is ridiculous. they beat earnings drastically and raise expectations, and the stock is basically flat? what's going on?"
IPG Photonics reached a 52 Week high at 204.62
IPGP is down 10.19% to $138.32
"whats up with this stock, some new are out?"
Sold at $212.055 toward close. Will buy back in couple days.
nice bounce
Another good quarter. This company rocks!
IPGP belongs to 200+ based on fundamentals and fundamentals always prevail in the long-run
If goes over 180 shorts will be cooked. They will try their best to keep it under 180....
"What is going on today.. I keep thinking things are moving with the probability of tax reform, but then today S&P up, but tech down big? IPGP even has a comprehensible P/E."
IPGP reached a new All Time High at 257.35
"Good buy in the $125 range which is 18 times TTM PE. Even if earnings growth slows to 10% in perpetuity, that would imply a PEG of 1.8. For a wide moat stock like IPGP, that would be a fair value IMHO."
shorts r in control
"107 yesterday would have been a great buy, but it only lasted for a very short time."
Are you guys gonna sell or hold?
"I'm not really sure why this stock is up from $120-$142 in 5 trading days. They warned for next quarter, and margins are down. China and the US are supposedly still negotiating, but they're clearly a long way off from any substantive deal."
"Wow, never saw this coming...yea, actually I did."
Report looks terrific... why so much of drop in pre market? Any idea?
ipgp in trouble missed last qtr and now missing on lower earnings. Lower sequential and lower comparable. Should settle at 67
"Heather, it is all about the big money and their fund managers ensuring that THEY make money, they pressure the stock and dump the price for a ""weak"" report and then they drive the price up against what would be either logical or sentiment wise. Contrarian to everything that those who know the markets would believe. They will drive this hard and then all of a sudden they will dump it like a hot potato. The benefits of having rigged markets. Things that should crash, explode upwards and things that should explode, crash."
Does anyone here know why IPG is going so high today?
did this really just take a 35% dump after hours?
"I am a little concerned about the hype, I checked out the company and all overtime has been canceled until further notice. (work load has subsided).... PS: main office in oxford, MA ugh"
Covered at 198.50
bought @ $161.88 can't complain @ $168
can anyone shed some light on whats going with COHR price drop the last few days?
IPGP reached a new 52 Week Low at $130.90
"I predict by year end, the price will hover around $400/share."
COHR is up next
IPGP is down -5.10% to 242.90
Yes - no problem getting on from investor relations page on the website
heavy on investment and capex with margin they prolly wont ever pay dividend
"I bought more, i don't think it will fall much more, the p/e is justified"
Very nice ride today
IPG Photonics reached a 52 Week high at 229.90
system hardware had virus
Did as whole company announce stock buy back to put floor under shares? No. Because they CARE about you.
This big drop looks similar to what OLED went through earlier. IPGP will likely find support at it's 5 year trendline around 150 or so.
"Really surprised at how hard they pushed this, really never expected much below 135, so the 133 was surprising. Also was expecting them to start driving it up fairly quickly by this time, knew they were going to keep pressure downward until after lunch hour on the East coast, typical approach, to get small investors to dump on their lunch hours. Would have expected 138 to 139 by now. Maybe they carry this negativity into the close, really trying to drive out the small retail investors in this market. To blame this on a jobs report is ludicrous, last quarter they were afraid too many jobs were created and they were afraid the Fed would want to raise rates quicker and higher, now we have a ""low"" number and the world is collapsing when we have full employment situation and lowest unemployment rate in 49 years. Amazing how they are driving the markets with false narratives and exaggerated claims."
OUCH!
Why is this down almost -10%?
IPGP reached a 52 Week low at $105.60
Hope 161 by today
back to where it belongs to.shorts r covering
170. high of the year. Back over 200 by Sept
"Though I'm still in, I am beyond frustrated that an equity goes down big when earnings are out. I have no problem when warranted, but if it's some metric that automatically trips and then huge price moves with small volume.. something is rotten.. and it's not a company's earnings or forecasts."
"Haven't bought a single share in ANY stock in the last 18 months since valuations have been on debt-fueled steroids. I haven't even added to IPGP, which I consider a GREAT company, in the last 2 years until these last couple months. But today, I am a BUYER."
IPG Photonics reached a 52 Week high at 189.91

IPGP COHR OLED. Buy a basket? Or will there be a hands down winner? Thoughts?
"IPG Photonics should have a really nice beat, if I am right I will make a video to explain why this happened."
Buy buy buy
Can we now all agree this is not going back up anytime soon?
Why today’s drop?
IPGP is down -24.02% to 170.43
"From the earnings announcement this morning: ""We continue to see aggressive pricing for select products by our competitors in China, and we expect currency headwinds to be greater in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter."" Should be an interesting call."
"The volume says it all, very heavy and smart people are posting their profits while they can. I do not blame them, it is all on paper until you cash out and wait to buy back in. It's the smart move.........................."
"Looks like if Leonel is correct about the low point, which I am a little hesitant to agree with, and we establish a 165 bottom plateau for our trading range, this will set up well for some good money producing runs, buy 165 and sell 175, repeat."
IPGP reached a new 52 Week Low at $108.50
"They missed their earnings estimates, beat on revenue, guidance is in-line. I'm not sure why it's up so much today."
"I doubled down way too early.Pain. Hurt. Ouch.Oh well, the Hawaiian vacation will have to be changed to a vacation at motel 6 somewhere in the hills of Tennessee."
Some adding right here. Should be an easy 15% by year end.

I've never seen such a lack of interest in a stock like this

this is when balance sheets matter
Is this overdone or more room for down?......
Guidance not good enough for the Street?
IPGP is down -4.90% to 222.30
"Not falling for it, allowing the price to sneak up through close to try and get some suckers to buy in thinking it will be up strong tomorrow."
Hats off to IPG today
Prelim numbers released this AM look very good. Revs ca $280M. EPS 1.39-1.42 - both blow away estimates.
Use company funds to buy back stock so insiders continue to dump into price support.
"Leonel, can we ask you some questions now?"
Why the nearly $7 swing today? Currently headed towards the low-side... I've been looking at adding this one before earnings but was just wondering if one of the shorts could explain why I should stay away.
will rebound early 2019
nice move
nice bounce back
"A lot of money to be made today, just wish I had cash, now I have to wait for the plays that I made yesterday to go green either near close or next week to free up some. Ugh."
"They are gaming IPGP against COHR, one day one is up, the other is down, the next day, just the opposite."
IPG Photonics reached a 52 Week high at 216.99
"It's days like this that longs wait for! This a great buying opportunity for a terrific company! Due your DD and you'll find by any metric that this is undervalued at this point. There are a lot of stocks that don't deserve their share price in this overheated market, but IPGP is not one of them!"
Can it hold this level?
"Why does IPGP have 2x the market cap of COHR.? I own both but seems that we might be extended here, no?"
Can someone explain how they took a $0.90 per share LOSS because of the federal tax cut bill?
"WOW, IS IT A BUY?"
"Unbelievable buying opportunity!!! IPGP has TRIPLED sales, earnings, and cash in the last 7 years! Sales growing on average $190 MILLION per year the last 7 years and about 90% of that growth has been ORGANIC, not thru dilutive acquisitions! Almost no debt! Market is expected to grow in the low teens over the next decade and so many opportunities in newer areas like microelectronics, medical and defense. Industry leader - totally undervalued!"
Back to 170 again ?
nice bounce today
I added an odd lot today. My god man this stock is like a gift from the gods below $140/share. IPGP is the nectar of the gods. Strong balance sheet with increasing product demand.
BOTTOM WAS 164.04 THATS ALL I AM SAYING. dont ask me no more questions.
"Market finally getting around to cleaning house, but every stock getting hit indiscriminately. IPGP is a great company and stock is undervalued here. If it falls below $125 I'm backing up the truck again like I did a month ago."

"Alright, so I was wrong, it went below 140, but only by a hair."
"this company will disrupt world balance of power, by supplying the weapons of the future."
"GoodForAll, I doubt this see below 140 anytime soon. Even with the financial news media and the analysts all trying to tank the markets, main street is just doing way too well to believe all of the false narratives that they are promoting. We have Morgan Stanley coming out almost daily with downgrades or special investor alerts or predictions of a major market correction, yet time and time again, things just get better. Lowest unemployment in 49 years. Every time they predict doom and gloom the reality of the world around them shows only blooming and booming. This is the best economy that we have had since the fifties and its real, not based on some fairy tale like the dot.com bubble during the Clinton years."
"Looking at IPGP's Balance Sheet indicates lots of available cash with very manageable debt. Why would investors also be in COHR? COHR has more total debt than total cash. I see so many post that they have shares of both, why?"
what is wrong with this company.?? is it due to China tarrifs?
"Pretty much following the same pattern as COHR for the previous three months after the precipitous fall. As soon as it looks like it may be gaining some momentum, they bring it back to earth. Don't think this gets over 185 anytime soon and more than likely will fall back to the 160s before earnings."
"How bizarre, NOVT just went green again and going higher into close."
"There a many of these drive-by selloffs occurring recently. Look at Coherent recently and Arista Networks today. These have always proved to be points at which to add shares. They are like portals to a profit universe that open and close periodically. I was able to bottom feed, adding shares at $228.74 & $235.93 this morning."
trade war is gonna bone this stock.
IPGP reached a 52 Week low at 112.52
"It was good to see it regain the 156 mark again but to be honest with you, the funds and the shorts own the tech sector and mainly the equipment provider sector of semi. With that being said, it is entirely possible that they drive the laser sector down to the other equipment providers level - AMAT and LCRX and that means cutting the prices of COHR and IPGP by half."
"Wow, a Facebook like quarter where numbers not bad but once conference call was over they said all the wrong things. I would give it the 3 day rule before thinking about buying. Feel for you longs and remember the bounce will come when the short attack gang covers."
"Sell, sell, sell... so I can buy lower."
How good does the earnings report have to be?
"""Q4 net income was $53 million and earnings per diluted share were $0.96, as charges related tothe 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced net income by $49 million and EPS by $0.90."" IPQP annual report. Can somoen tell me how the 21018 tax act caused a LOSS?"
"I was seriously going to sell this thing this morning and then I look into it, only to find another big down turn. I got in during the 155's a while back, missed the selling opportunity and now got hung out to dry! Any predictions on what this is going to do next week?"
IPG Photonics reached a 52 Week high at 254.57
"COHR and IPGP traded almost in the exact pattern all day today, rather amazing given no real news to drive the sector."
