"Think this is an easy 25% gainer if not more going forward for 2019 Growth on the forefront with more deals being announced . Also have to think this is a very likely takeout candidate. No one here to talk with or big hype which means no shorts or manipulation. Kind of like an old fashioned stock that just keeps it head down and does its business. Like that it is headquartered in Maine. Solid, stoic , can do!"

"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on What*sapp>>>>>>> +447901191306 or Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"
