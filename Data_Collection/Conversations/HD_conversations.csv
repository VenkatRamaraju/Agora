Going to buy 1000 more shares today while it’s down. Be back up next week.
It never fails that stocks go down on earning call no matter how they had performed.

"I have owned HD since the late 80s. Everything looks good by the money people calling the shots but, we are going down by the stock price. HD should be going straight up. It seems the institutions who own the largest number of HD stock. I feel they are taking short term gains then unload the stock driving the price down, then they get back in the game. I would love to see more people buying HD and going long with the stock while reinvesting dividends, it has worked for me but, I am just a little guy. God bless all the men and women who go long with HD."
In few month many will regret why they miss this great opportunity of earning
"HD will have solid earnings, housing market is rocketing and the repairs needed are going to catapult this stock into the 400s easy. Get in now before you miss out!"
buy now...quality stock for long/short...during covid or not
Was Lowe’s earnings report that much better to justify $18 jump
"North Korea seems to be ramping up its nuclear arsenal by restarting a reactor that's been inactive for years, Another Joe Test that he will fail on."
so I know that hd stock price has been up and down.however come 17th earnings day. There going to be a hugh price increase. I would say buy now before nx week. good luck.
Home Depot up due to hurricane damage. Lots of needed supplies needed for the recovery.
Everyone knows that good earnings will initially bring this stock down. It’s been proven 7 times in a row after beating EPS. I got a PUT for earnings.
"Retail sales is a drag now that everything is so expensive. I heard Cramer talking up HD this morning. Little did Cramer knows that when you need an appliance from HD , you got to wait 12 days for delivery. That alone is a nonbrainer that HD cannot make sales. When people appliances breaks down, they need one now, not 12 days after. Everything is way overpriced and retail sales will come to a halt very soon because there is no more free money coming."
$400 stock
Home depot misses and disappoints !300 will be tested !
My HD in NC is always jam packed and there's a construction boom in this state.

HD One of the best most reliable stocks in the index. Has consistently paid dividends and grows in value every year. BUY BUY BUY more HD
"Its hurricane season and HD drops on an earnings beat ?? LOL, this is a gift, will keep adding on dips."
"you know HD is booming when on Monday, the garden dept is almost sold out.At least in Austin."
$1.65 ex-dividend September 2
3-1 maybe 4-1 split AND announce massive buyback. HD is a bluecollar company but has a white collar share price. Get back to the basics HD and don't forget what got you here. Long term stockholder.
Does anyone have a problem with this app this morning..
