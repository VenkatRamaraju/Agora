"Great balance sheet, great board, good to their employees...some analysts anticipate their July 4th sales(which begin a week ahead)will blow Black Fridays of years past OUT OF THE WATER. So many appliances to be replaced after overuse in lockdown + so much cash to spend...Be long for long and buy on dips. And then there's always talk of #HDsplit. But that's gossip. No gossip in yahoo chats."
Was the 5 point bounce off 300 a dead count bounce OR will it re-test 300 and break down from there.
i bought 191..should i sell for loss?
They permanently closed all Hot Dog vendors from their stores...why????! People love the HD Hot Dog experience! Time to SHORT this stock!!
added more at 260. long this great company that's on sale. Messes with my low cost basis of $151 but was looking to add shares. I think this is it! If down again tomorrow I will buy more of this core holding for long term.
"It amazes me that HD has dropped in price today after a superb earnings report before the opening bell. $3.05 eps and $30.46B in sales for the quarter ending 7/31, compared to analyst's expectations of $2.84 and $30B and a $2.25 eps for the same quarter last year. HD upped it's earnings estimates for the fiscal year (ending 1/31/19) to $9.42. The TRAILING annual earnings now are $8.66 giving HD a P/E of 22.3, about 10% less than the S&P 500 avg despite a greater than avg. growth rate and 2.1% div.I have a schedule for investments in 2019 and HD is on it, but I'm considering tightening my belt for a while and advancing that investment to now.I first bought HD last year @ $153.11 when I saw the housing market recovery picking up. From my personal experiences in the stores, I planned to buy Lowe's instead of Home Depot. But after a lot of research, I saw that Home Depot, the much larger chain, had durable competitive advantages in long-term contracts with builders and with the unique ability to ship very large pre-fab and other items. Lowe's increases its earnings almost entirely by building new stores. Home Depot does it by increasing same store sales more than new stores and same store sales increased over 8% over the last year.I plan to hold HD for decades if it holds on to those advantages."
$320 per share cheappp THANK YOU LORD FOR CHEAP HOME DEPOT SHARE KAY TAMIS NG MURA DISCOUNTED TODAY
Should have a stock split
Demand for roofing plywood and sheetrock will skyrocket.HD is deep in supply.Look for 10% gain by Friday.
"North Korea seems to be ramping up its nuclear arsenal by restarting a reactor that's been inactive for years, Another Joe Test that he will fail on."
Anyone know is this held in qqq?
"Reminder that $1.65 quarterly dividend will be paid March 25th to shareholders of record at close of business on March 11th. To be eligible, you must own HD by EOD tomorrow, March 9th."
HD continues to slowly erode toward the 100 day average around 297!!!
Should we expect more downside?
LOL. Weakness in the housing sector. Every HD I go to is packed at any time of the day. Only an out of touch analyst locked in a tower in NYC would tell you to sell.
"Lumber prices off 60%, osb off 70% and plywood 50% in the last 4 weeks.Margin will go down, this is just the beginning."
Housing starts are up 7% in 2020 compared to 2019. That’s a lot of home improvement projects which will just add to HD and Low’s bottom line...
Fingers crossed there using the buyback diligently!
So Lowe’s is stealing customers from HD now? NICE
Daughter works at Home Depot and so tired hearing about all the theft that simply walks out the door!!!! Perhaps paying folks for security upon checkout their sales per store would beat. Simply ridiculous that management allows this to happen!!!!!
"What’s going on here, I must not of got the memo? The markets up big for 2 days, and we’re dropping like a prom dress!!!"
love HD going up when we get some WS love no worries on the downs
It will bounce back no problem
Sell on good earning!
A good time to pick up more on the dip.
Happy day for sell shorters today. Time to buy and add more for long?
"ever notice the Trolls (looking at you ""R"") go back under their bridges on good HD days / weeks ? Looking at their Troll posts it appears they just move on to another stock thats stalled for whatever reason.Bullish, long and own some shares from $35 cost basis"
split the stock.its time.
For 7th Quarter straight HD have never beat ER will the 8th be the charm - I hope so 8th is a good luck #05/18/2021 320.01 316.75 -1.02% 02/23/2021 275.85 267.24 -3.12% 11/17/2020 279.57 272.47 -2.54% 08/18/2020 288.24 285.00 -1.12% 05/19/2020 245.35 238.10 -2.95% 02/25/2020 239.70 237.38 -0.97% 11/19/2019 238.85 225.86 -5.44%
"It is nice to see HD gaining this week. I think the warmer weather is getting people out shopping in there local HD store. I have gone long with HD for the last 31 years. I wish I could say I have thousands of shares but, that is not the case. I am just a working man so I could not put thousands of dollars in my account. I have used the drip plan which has worked very well for me. I do have eight other accounts that have used the drip approach. If you are a young man or even middle age, it will work very well for you. You will not have to be pouring over what is going on in the stock market. Please look at drip plan investing. You just add money in your stock when you have the money at the time. You will not have to pay any broker fee's.If you go long, the rewards will make you happy."
"So sales are up 25% to $132 billion for the year and the stock is overselling because of some comments about not knowing what the next year will bring? Last year's outlook was a much bigger unkown and it ended up being record setting. Retail sales are beginning to boom, home sales are increasing in value faster than ever, and rates are going no where. All of this and HD is only trading at slightly above fair value AND with a 2%+ dividend."
"If the Fed reserve raise rate by one percent, it will for sure negatively impacts HD share price. people will delay home improvements, builder will slow down home starts."
330.00 today!!!
the covid factor isnt helping anything out either
"I’m still happy to own this stock Long. It’s been good to me the past few years, I don’t see it going away, oh by the way I see Contractors in my HD often."
Excellent fundamental and forward guidance. I guess the meme crowd is moving elsewhere. Sux
Start to accumulate under 290.
Home Depot doesn't change because of holiday sales or downturns or up turns.Sales happen in all times. Homes need products that need repaired. HD is a magnet for sales.I can't see any reason why HD is down.
In few month many will regret why they miss this great opportunity of earning
"I have owned HD for 30 years. I have always reinvested dividends. It is a great stock but, I now feel the stock needs to split to bring the price down for every day investors. We have gone down $40.00 in last month. HD needs investors not fund owners who buy up big blocks, then sell off and take profits. If a split was put in place and the price comes down for the every day investors. I feel it would be a shot in the arm for HD. HD is now owned by big fund owners. HD , we need to go back and reward the smaller investors. !!!"
Spilt the Stock already!
Peaked ... home renovation? A broke county has no money
Time to sell
Does anyone have a problem with this app this morning..
Buying more under $300.
"Okay, just bought a little more HD at 300 and change!! Could be going to 290 next. If so, I'll just buy a little more and enjoy the BIG dividend until it heads higher!! A split could be announced sooner, rather then later as well!!"
Buy hd cat mmm
We just got an upgrade to $310 by Guggenheim. Stay strong longs!
"that's not true HD is not packed i live next to one, often hardly anyone there. most home builders always buys from lumber yard. the associates are terrible, used to love it but they screwed up my orders i could go on . my friends agree it has gotten bad there. i go out of my way to shop at Lowes."
Will hold this forever!!! Best stock to own
What a premature for Powell to say about a possible couple rate hikes 2023 ?? Obviously to disrupt the stock market
"Positive and sustainable trade today with consistent volume approaching record highs. As other brick and mortar retail languishes in a sea of C19 spirals, the weekend provided additional HD buy recommendations from both tech and fundamental POV. Net insider purchases vs sales numbers at 2:1 ratio. Institutions hold 70%+. At a price earnings ratio of 24, still in line with overall S&P . at 22."
Why silent on the boycott? Why does HD support voter suppression?
Did we win 
"Home Depot stock slumps after profit and record sales beat expectations, but same-store sales missShares of Home Depot Inc. (HD) slumped 3.6% in premarket trading Tuesday, after the home improvement retailer reported fiscal second-quarter profit and record sales that beat expectations but same-store sales that came up short. Net income for the quarter to Aug. 1 rose to $4.81 billion, or $4.53 a share, from $4.33 billion, or $4.02 a share, in the year-ago period. The FactSet consensus for earnings per share was $4.45. Sales grew 8.1% to $41.12 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $40.63 billion. Cost of sales rose 9.3% to $27.45 billion, as gross margin fell to 33.2% from 34.0%. Same-store sales increased 4.5%, below the FactSet growth consensus of 5.4%, while U.S. same-store sales rose 3.4% to miss expectations of a 5.1% rise. The stock has rallied 26.1% year to date through Monday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has advanced 16.4%."
Probably peaked ... no motivation to invest here ...
8 million shares bought at the last five minutes of trading!This baby is heading up to $350!
Was Lowe’s earnings report that much better to justify $18 jump
"Looked at the chart of HD again, and now I like what I see!! RSI and MACD moving up with stock breaking out and silver cross occurring today!! Got back in at 279 and change!!"
Hopefully we get a split in 2022!
Home sales and home improvement will carry until October. If hurricanes make landfall we are looking at blowout sales
so I know that hd stock price has been up and down.however come 17th earnings day. There going to be a hugh price increase. I would say buy now before nx week. good luck.
"Home Depot should split, it’s a psychological thing where people don’t buy it because the stock price is too high."
"With a couple hurricanes on top of the infrastructure bill, we may see $400 before long."
"While I usually feel political posts should go elsewhere, I will make an exception. Working with the U.S. intelligence community on several projects I could not resist giving my thoughts about what has been going on in this country for quite a while. Disclaimer: I voted for neither Presidential candidate of the major parties during the 2016 election. ""Who rules America""?After forty years of observation, readings, and conversations, it's the elites via their organizations such as the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations.They are the primary drivers behind the efforts to impeach Trump. They are using their assets in the Press, the intelligence community, the media, etc. for the impeachment of Trump.They had heavily invested in getting the Clintons into power. The Trump election and the Brexit were major blows to their plans for a one world government run by their shills like the Clintons, JImmy Carter, George Bush I, etc.They cannot control Trump like the others. During the last days of the 2016 Presidential campaign, Trump ran an add in California about returning the government to the people. It briefly displayed a photo of David Rockefeller. What are their plans? See the comments below by two of their leaders: Zbigniew Brzezinski and David Rockefeller. These comments should scare anyone!For those who downplay or mock concerns about the power, dealings, pervasiveness or agenda of the shadow government, consider the following.If the recent Sixty Minutes revelation that the deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, and the assistant attorney general of the United States, Rod Rosenstein, conspired to recruit cabinet members to impeach Trump shortly after his election as well as comments by 3 FBI officials disclosing in private emails that they had a plan to deal with Trump didn't bother you, then consider these comments by two leading members of the Trilateral Commission, especially the last one by David Rockefeller citing collusion by the national Press to keep the shadow government from the public:“The technotronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by traditional values. Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen. These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities""-Zbigniew Brzezinski, Between Two Ages: America's Role in the Technetronic Era""This regionalization is in keeping with the Tri-Lateral Plan which calls for a gradual convergence of East and West, ultimately leading toward the goal of one world government”-Zbigniew Brzezinski""Shortly, the public will be unable to reason or think for themselves. They'll only be able to parrot the information they've been given on the previous night's news""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""People, governments and economies of all nations must serve the needs of multinational banks and corporations""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""The society will be dominated by an elite of persons free from traditional values who will have no doubt in fulfilling their objectives by means of purged techniques with which they will influence the behavior of people and will control and watch the society in all details. It will become possible to exert a practically permanent watch on each citizen of the world""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""The nation state as a fundamental unit of man's organized life has ceased to be the principal creative force: International banks and multinational corporations are acting and planning in terms that are far in advance of the political concepts of the nation-state""-Zbigniew Brzezinski""Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure - one world, if you will. If that's the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.""-David Rockefeller""We are grateful to The Washington Post, The New York Times, Time Magazine and other great publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost forty years. It would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subject to the bright lights of publicity during those years. But, the work is now much more sophisticated and prepared to march towards a World Government.The supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the national auto-determination practiced in past centuries""-David RockefellerIMHO-The elites want Trump impeached, because unlike Jimmy Carter, George Bush I, the Clintons, etc., they cannot control him and he is a threat to their plans.We have met the primary enemy and they is us!"
I’m all in. Time to reap the benefits of an open economy and HD 300+ gain!
If interest rates will rise in 2023 then HD will benefit from that. Add at these levels.
bow chicka bow wow. me likey!
Why is HD donating 1million to BLM??? Long term stockholder.
"With hurricane season upon us and the red hot housing market, it should be a great summer for HD."
"Was in a NJ HD today and you’d think they we’re giving away products for free, it was packed!"
Load up the truck on this dip....HD will leave you behind and split before your next blink.
"You just can't FIGHT that Head and Shoulders pattern. Closing high of 340 subtract the shoulder (around 320), and you've got a price target near 300 (or slightly below to 100 day moving average). Re-bought at 310 and change. May buy more today."
Shorted yesterday late! When should I buy close?
"Also prices of import from China raised per 20,000 dollars per container.Customers will not absorb this kind of inflation.Sales and margin will go down."
Tomorrow is when the employees buy all their stock they been saving up for for the last 6 months. Volume will be high tomorrow!
Going to be down 7-8% today wahoo.
"cant even break an ema line on a 1 minute chart, Im out, its my fault, I got in at the wrong place so Im getting out at the wromg place, it was an earnings play that blew up in my face, glta"

"Shot up 1% for zero reason. Earnings declining, bad retail sales, bad new construction news and it shoots up. MMs pumping this so they dump onto retail? That's my guess."
"I visited my local Home Depot today it looked like it was a pre covid day. Isles were busy, registers were ringing and they had enough staff around. I was helped immediately. Based on the registers alone it's a great sign that Home Depot is experiencing accelerated growth."
strong close great week
"Waaaaayyyyy oversold. With spring in the air after a harsh winter, and the reopening of the economy, HD is going to capitalize greatly!"
"you know HD is booming when on Monday, the garden dept is almost sold out.At least in Austin."
"Email to friendPrintHD -Dividend this week:Declared Ex-Date Record Payable Amount Type08/19/21 09/01/21 09/02/21 09/16/21 $1.650000 Cash, quarterly"
"John Dutton, predicted the sell off."
"bought our first shares of HD 25 years ago for less than $10 per share. Over the next two years we bought more for a cost of $6500. Today our HD is worth $101,000 and we own 311 shares thanks to two splits early on. This stock is liquid gold. Carol"
For all you value investors out there who want safe reliable stocks that grow their dividends. Today is your lucky day.

"Weather has been hot in Florida (80s.) Was in my Depot this morning. Longest line I ever saw at the paint desk. 15+ people. The line snaked around 2 sides of the desk and down the aisle. Garden center had cars lining the fire lanes loading plants/mulch/soil. Store was packed. What a great time to do those longer DIY projects, with extended time working/staying home. The Lowe's across the street had a packed parking lot, too, as I went to the grocery store next to them. Inside the grocery store was only mildly busy compared to HD.I got a text from Lowe's saying ""As an essential retailer, we're open and ready to help."" I'd imagine both will be open, with reduced hours, throughout whatever shutdowns occur. Really surprised these two stocks have not held up better, like a TGT or WMT."
one more sell off tomorrow morning and break even at closing!
Buy now...quality stock
Home Depot Black Friday Sale
Thanks for the dips! $OEG $AAPL $NAUT $CTRM
"SMG blowout earnings today should drive HD over $300 sooner than later. Once investors and analysts absorb the signs, will drive HD to new highs. Just to remind all:snowstorm sales......springtime bump.......MG earning/revenue beat.......upgrade to $310."
almost back to 1. month we are moving in. the right direction
"At least analysts are defending the stock.....I've seen what happens when they turn against a stock. Pretty confident of a rebound next two weeksWall Street by and large came out quickly to defend Home Depot’s stock, long a top play for many strategists. Some have reasoned Home Depot will continue to benefit from favorable dynamics in the housing market, ranging from low interest rates spurring remodeling activity to a pick up in building activity in 2020.“The macro nature of their business is in better shape,” Gradient Investments portfolio manager Jeremy Bryan said on Yahoo Finance’s The First Trade. Gradient owns Home Depot shares.To Bryan’s point, U.S. housing starts rebounded in October and housing permits rose to a more than 12-year high, the U.S. Commerce Department said Tuesday.Others remain bullish on Home Depot’s longer term execution and how it’s doing well in the age of digital shopping.“We expect some weakness in HD today, given the underwhelming results and likely downward estimate revisions. That said, with HD viewed as among the highest-quality names and with some macro tailwinds, we think the downside damage to the stock could be mitigated,” Nomura Instinet analyst Michael Baker wrote in a note to clients.Baker’s bullishness was echoed by Jefferies analyst Jonathan Matuszewski.“3Q comp sales were light, though operating margins in-line with expectations. We believe shares down in the pre-market create a buying opportunity, as we interpret lighter 2H results to be more tied to timing of returns on strategic investments vs. a softer macro picture. These results don't change our view of a favorable industry backdrop with ongoing home improvement center share gains across most categories,” Matuszewski said."
"Assuming LOW were to trade at around 20x it's OCF (which I think will happen given spending in housing won't stop anytime soon), fair value of the stock gets to $273/share - 43% upside still from current levels. Long $LOW, $HD"
Should here of a split tomorrow
"I love HD but here's some constructive criticism. Let's hope that employee raises translate into better service and a better stock price. How about adding back more 'on the floor' employees and training them better? I regularly get questions from frustrated customers while in the store....When you do get help it seems there are too many employees that know less about their products and DIY stuff than I do. I lie to the checkout cashiers when asked ""Did you find everything?"" because I don't think they really care that much and I don't want to turn my checkout into a gripe session. With all that, I'm still long...."
When the infrastructure bill passes HD will be a large beneficiary
$VENA $HD Don't worry. You can't change anything
Where is Mr R and the other perpetual trolls now ? Under their bridge hiding I guess. 10% gain since they were last seen spouting troll gibberish
Take this to 200 where it belongs
"HD is a stock that just keeps on giving. I have owned since 1988. It is all in a drip plan. It has paid off big time for me. In 1999 I bought stock for my grandson in a drip plan when he was born. I figured it would help pay for his education. I put money in the stock up until 2002. I had purchased about 200 shares in total. We had one split in that time. The stock took of after that point. DRIP plans are the way to go. He decided against college against my better judgement. He owns his own construction business with no debt. He now owns all of the stock while feeding it every month. His plans are to keep the stock in a DRIP plan. He plans to keep the stock as his retirement. There is no telling what it will be worth in 40 years. The moral of this story is HD is a great stock while using the DRIP plan. I wish I could have been in his financial condition at 23 yrs. old. HD can do the same for you, if buy and hold on to the stock while reinvesting your dividends."
HD is a solid company.....but has never guided down for years.....if lowes beat top and bottom....then they are taking market shares
Tomorrow news on housing starts will be crucial for this stock￼
It doesn't just take hurricanes but storms like Elsa are good for the storage companies WM and Lowes and Home Depot. Global warming has a good side as well for these stocks
"ok, earnings are up, revenue is up, but because joe the plumber bought 3 less shower heads than he did a year ago the stock goes into a freefall, I know the dow is getting pummeled this morning butC’mon man,For a week it’s been being touted how well hd is doing but not a whisper about instore sales, had I heard that I would have ran from this stock, I guess I missed one rock when I was turning them all over,oh well,Get out and move on,NEXT!!!!"
"meh, big deal, down only $10.00 pre market. Amazing company that will always be the biggest in home improvement retail, with the best management team in place. Targets raised to $350.00"
"These are actually really good numbers, especially coming out of a year where everyone already spent big on DIY during peak covid times....not sure what all the pessimism is about...“For the three months ended Aug. 1, net income grew to $4.81 billion, or $4.53 per share, from $4.33 billion, or $4.02 per share, a year earlier.Revenue climbed 8.1% to $41.12 billion from $38.05 billion a year earlier.”"
Where will you add?It's gone lower than I thought it would
"Here we are again heading back down to $260 from $285........yt seems stuck between this range. With house sales going through the rough, HD not capitalizing in stock price. I think investors are still unhappy about the ""pay guarantee"" made by HD mgmt, and we may have to wait until ""EARNINGS"" to better understand impacts.Last with the snowstorms happening now should benefit HD sales on shovels, salt, blowers etc AND then following up in a few months the ""springtime"" bump should boost HD by next ER to finally get to $300 targets. I think anything under $260 is time to add more....thoughts?"
pay me my dividend! I'll be happy
Profit taking. HD a long term winner.
Management said that the price of lumber has been a problem. People are putting off some projects waiting for the price to go down. This is as the feds say transitory
"Cant make this stuff up,Last week Jeffries upgrades to 360 from 350, yesterday afternoon they upgraded to 389, this morning they downgrade to 369,Now, all the other upgrades from 19 hours ago are downgraded.This is psychotic behavior."
Mr R - come on fess up did you buy when it hit $299??? Didn't think so - hey it happens...
$1.65 per share!
I bought HD in 2005 at an average cost basis of $35 per share.The annual dividend as $0.40 per share at the time. Now the annual dividend is $6.60 per share.I figure that I'm making over 18% annually just on dividends.I only wish I had bought these shares in my ROTH IRA instead of in my Traditional Rollover IRA.
180 here we come...
"Time to go private! Long term stock holder and tired of the overall market manipulation, its gotten out of hand. Own Apple to and suggest going private also!"
I started in 1990 and have bought monthly ...i recently retired and I can say nothing bad about home depot..it was one of the first stocks I bought because the parking lot was always full..after 30 years investing it has been a big blessing in retirement from nursing...still adding!
"Outlook for HD hasn't been this good since the housing boom of 2004-2007. Valuation a question, but at 280 the stock should have legs to break 300 in the next few weeks."
"Retail sales is a drag now that everything is so expensive. I heard Cramer talking up HD this morning. Little did Cramer knows that when you need an appliance from HD , you got to wait 12 days for delivery. That alone is a nonbrainer that HD cannot make sales. When people appliances breaks down, they need one now, not 12 days after. Everything is way overpriced and retail sales will come to a halt very soon because there is no more free money coming."
Infrastructure bill bodes well for hd ...
excellent week
Short it to 150!!
Someone let the cat out of the bag; HD down over 13 points.
"spent 8000 dollars for hd stock in 1985, with drip worth 300000 today drawing almost 8000 dollars in dividends"
"HD a quality company with strong fundamentals is down $24 since the open last week Thursday. 8 percent flash correction. So we know housing is very strong, we are in the middle of the peak of hurricane season, and the stock will probably split soon. Down $24 is unbelievable to me. We have very strong support at $250 and $265. We are due for at least a bounce. Again down $24 in 8 days folks and there is nothing wrong with the company and fundamentals are getting stronger. Go figure but I think it is a screaming buying opportunity."
"YTD = 16+% ,........ awesome "
If you are long term it’s just another day! Ohh yeah I’m long!
$HD LIVE STREAM Home Depot Q2 Earnings Call 9 EST Source: https://youtu.be/g0FdjVSjMas
"HD has been the very best investment of my life. I started buying HD in the 80s. I was buying stock when I honestly could not afford to buy any stock. I did this using the DRIP PLAN. I purchased probably $100.00 at a time for years. This was big money to me. I have to say life was very tough for me in those days. In the 90s I got into other stocks like aflac, southern company, VZ, Motorola. I did it all thru DRIP PLANS. DRIP PLANS were the best thing to happen to. I was purchasing HD when I could buy it from $20.00 to $35.00 a share. I thought it would never get past $35.00. The moral of my story is I never took any dividends in all the years, just reinvested to buy more stock. If you are a young man or middle aged, please look into drip plans and watch you money grow. I am just a working man, just retired. I love HD. No mater what anyone says about splitting, it would make the stock price really grow."
"HD will have solid earnings, housing market is rocketing and the repairs needed are going to catapult this stock into the 400s easy. Get in now before you miss out!"
hold long be strong it will rebound
the bubble is enormous everywhere
"I'm a value investor. I just went all in today on HD stock. Like always, any solid stock paying a nice divvy is going to increase in value especially with a strong economy. I expect 2H19 will be a big surprise to the upside in GDP terms. Mark this post."
"HD is a fantastic stock to own. I wish I had purchased more HD when it was 35.00. I have never sold any part of my HD stock. I just reinvest the dividends. It honestly pays off in the long run. I am not getting rich, I am very comfortable at this time. It is nice to know I have HD. If your young or middle age please think about a drip plan with HD"
You guys at $BBY $W $HD $AMZN $LOW need to seriously look at $GOED and their acquisition of Appliance Connection Group
Great time to buy on the phony dip.beacause there was no reason to beat up this stock the way the street did. I bought at 319.⁰0 about 80 more shares yesterday. 350.00 by eoy guarantee.
As long as the Fed keeps interest rates at rock bottom levels HD will continue to forge ahead. Right now real interest rates are at negative 4.6% and housing wi a great place to put your money. Long and strong!
"$HD is $322 in the Pm. The past time it was in that level, the SPY was $425. This move in HD leads me to believe there is a bear trap ahead."
Warren buffet sezWhen everone is scared be greedy But everyone is greedy be scared..Looks like a lot of greedy investors to me..Do you disagree ?Hd 300 will be tested imo..
Everyone knows that good earnings will initially bring this stock down. It’s been proven 7 times in a row after beating EPS. I got a PUT for earnings.
Home depot misses and disappoints !300 will be tested !
Home depot now has the worse customer service than Lows.
The market is about fundamentals anymore
It never fails that stocks go down on earning call no matter how they had performed.
I don’t own this stock but checked in to say how baffled I am this stock went down on ER. I go to Home Depot quite a bit and the parking lots are almost always packed
HD is a solid company and a great stock. Probably goes down a bit more but im not waiting. Adding to my position.
"Drops $30+/share, pays dividend"
"Three HD's within a 20 mi radius here in the hardest-hit-by-Covid NE. Pulled into one, parking lot full, signs posted for hiring. Ditto #2, same at #3. No denying the visual evidence. Regardless of unemployment numbers, customers will still repair their dwellings. Longer times at home triggers the impulse to improve. And if we do get the second wave, they are well positioned for online purchases and curbside pickup. Based on the technicals and hi market volatility, looking for a trade to US$280 by year's end."
Where’s the support? $270? Not saying it goes there but the stock is breaking down. I may add some here and more if we get that low.
today was a good day
Home depot is going to destroy earnings.
"from what I have learned about charts, HD is headed downward soon. Let see if im right."
Good earnings and this is down.. guess I’ll be adding at some point
"HD down $5.17, LOW up $1.60. Wow! Thank you for the upgrade Guggenheim. I guess they use their buy rec so their clients could dump the stock. How is this legal. So we are down $12-$13 since yesterday’s AM high. Hard to believe.Ken Langone did not help us with his comments. Unbelievable that we are down this much in a flat market too."
"The stock market has gone crazy in the last couple of months. I am a person who has always gone long the last 25 years but the last couple of months have been horrible for me. Since mid Sept. HD has lost almost 40 points. if you own 1000 shares you are down almost 40K. The over all stock market is down 1750 points. I am not sure how close we are to bottom of this fall.I am getting close to the point of selling out of the market because of my age and enjoy my investments. I am not hurting at this point but if I were to sell now, I would be down quite a bit in just 2 months. HD has always been a big money maker for me because I paid as little as $25.00 a share over the years. If you want a stock you can retire later on, buy HD. The dividends are great. I just reinvest my dividends. The DRIP plans are the greatest things since sliced bread. I would feel a lot better if the market takes a turn upwards for the next 6 months. Young people buy HD and hold, you will be happy you did. DRIP plans are the greatest."
"Well see. I bought this stock at $50 bucks or something like that 15 years ago? The KID is going Ivy league. Its going to pay for it. Lucky I got it. That said,.? Look at a chart. CMON"
HD One of the best most reliable stocks in the index. Has consistently paid dividends and grows in value every year. BUY BUY BUY more HD
I used to work at homedepot when I was like 18 years old in 2010 and always put half my paycheck in this stonkkkkk
"When HD dropped to $250 a share just weeks ago, I bought some, but I also diversified and purchased other companies that have left much to be desired. I should have just bought more HD, for more gains!"
"Buying more into this dip. Nice dividend. It'll be up 10% - $300+ by the late spring. Always good for HD sales. Major home improvement projects from new roofs, decks, landscaping, BBQs, spring cleaning supplies, etc."
253 to 335 ... 4 months
Store traffic is light in my neighborhood. Lowes also. Lumber prices have stalled new construction projects including mine. Sold all positions after holding long. Watching the dip and will buy back in around 230.
No one shows up to work there
It's time to clear up the confusion about stock splits. When a stock splits although the share price is the same in theory you do gain more shares. This is very important and this is how the vast majority of share holders accumulate more shares over time. HD shares after a split would likely rebound just as they have done before In the past. Now this may take some time. After all wouldn't you rather 2 or 3 times the shares you had before a split. And again the price will follow. Plus Institution investors look at share price and look favorabley when a company splits it's stock.
Bought at 252. Nice gains! but whats next in terms of price point now that we have reached 300? I feel no pressure to take profits now but just curious how much further this thing can go.
"Don't understand today's decline....I'm long term holder, love the 2.5%+div....I'm buying....still think long term it goes to $310 - $320"
My HD in NC is always jam packed and there's a construction boom in this state.
"The spike from the so-called lumber shortage has resounding effects. People put off projects, use alternative building materials like recycled lumber, and just made going to the home improvement stores not as enjoyable. I used to go there almost everyday. Now, I go there maybe once per month. Maybe."
buy now...quality stock for long/short...during covid or not
HD will benefit from the infrastructure bill. There is no question about it.
Unless you're day trading don't bother reading the nonsense here. Relax...collect your dividends and as a bonus watch the stock continue to rise. Ignore the noise.
Monster stock!
"Welp, looks like the dems are about to have their first recession. Can’t buy their way out of this one! Lmao!"
prob will finish 323 minimum today
Projection on Div increase? The easy guess is $6 - $7 for a %16 raise. Less than recent years but still fabulous.
*Home Depot stock price target raised to $265 from $250 at UBSBY MarketWatch— 9:13 AM ET 05/20/2020
Lumber drops dramatically. The price of a 2x4 hasn't gone down in years. Who runs this scam?
Going to buy 1000 more shares today while it’s down. Be back up next week.
330.00 is coming
$1.65 ex-dividend September 2
"I have owned HD since the late 80s. Everything looks good by the money people calling the shots but, we are going down by the stock price. HD should be going straight up. It seems the institutions who own the largest number of HD stock. I feel they are taking short term gains then unload the stock driving the price down, then they get back in the game. I would love to see more people buying HD and going long with the stock while reinvesting dividends, it has worked for me but, I am just a little guy. God bless all the men and women who go long with HD."
"Meanwhile VRPX comes out of nowhere and shoots from $4 and change to $16 in six hours, wish I could’ve seen that one coming,gotta love this job"
"Home Depot recently cut lumber prices by a meaningful margin. Some pressure treated larger boards were cut 30-40%Lumber futures have fallen from $1,711, to now $630, over the past two months. Home Depot was making a fortune off of the lumber squeeze. Margins could come under pressure with this reduced pricing for lumber."
Sell your profits. Big dip coming. Don’t get caught.
Home Depot up due to hurricane damage. Lots of needed supplies needed for the recovery.
Add on drop plus nice divy goes ex in less than a month.
Clorox is falling big premarket. This does not bode well for Home Depot imo
"I would like to say that I purchased a new screwdriver from HD in the last quarter so don't blame me, I did my part.Baaahaha"
900k shares traded takes it down $8
hd has the contractors and lowes doesnt. FACT buy the depot
"Here we are AGAIN sitting at $288, we been here before many time and then HD drops back down to $260. BUT I THINK THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT!! This will be the time HD breaks resistance and start to climb over $300. We are hitting this level after record housing starts and the upcoming Spring season. These factors should bode well for upcoming ER expectations, and it will be the anticipation of solid earnings report that will finally drive HD to the elusive $300 price.So do not sell if the MM try to drive HD back down, we can do it this time....we deserve HD to return us investors some better profits and a continued momentum to new highs and a stable support once we get past $300.Good Luck!"
"$HD $VENA it's quite simple, we buy and hold"
Started buying it when it was $18 a share
Needs to split!
"Multiple analysts upped their price targets - $295 to $330.So, why isn't HD moving? Inquiring minds want to....I own 1,000 at a cost basis of $43.10."
Split the stock already
added
"Its hurricane season and HD drops on an earnings beat ?? LOL, this is a gift, will keep adding on dips."
"my original $7,000 investment is now worth over $50k. dividend reinvestment and not touching this stock for 25 years."
Stimulus checks are being spent at HD. All time highs will continue.
"Im confused here, yesterday I saw that lowes had a decline on instore purchases, the same scenario as HD, this morning “Lowes jumps 9% on positive earnings”Im waiting for a talking heads explanation of this phenomena,Its the twilight zone"
"Apple split 2 times, Nvida just split - time for HD to split! Long term holder from late 80’s."
"Maxar just tweeted: We’re excited to announce that we are expanding our high-definition #satellite imagery offering with the introduction of 15 cm #HD, providing a new #pixel experience for our customers, helping them identify smaller features to make more informed decisions."
"If housing inventory is low, but the expectation is that housing inventory will catch up to demand, can someone explain to me how they're going to build that many houses without going to places like Home Depot and blowing up their cash register? And the stock went down because they think that housing demand will slow down after they build a bunch of houses to slow down demand? Not buying it.. Or in this case... not selling it."
Anyone have an idea while the trading volume was so high today?
"Guys, I think sticking to the Wall Street shorts is the right thing to do. For too long this has been a manipulated market. I am definitely concerned that some of you will be left with nothing.Do the trade, but don’t get emotionally attached to a trade. Get out and take your profits and invest them into actual companies with assets who pay dividends.Think $GE $XOM $CVX $HD $GEL $ET there’s a ton of very good companies out there. Don’t get too attached to options and being over leveraged. GROWTH IS NOT A VIABLE BUSINESS PLAN WITHOUT PROFITS AND CASH FLOW. Please remember this - get into good companies with profitable well run businesses."
2 undervalued stocks going up now ALTO and SELB
this company hires thousands and thousands of Americans and makes Mega dollars for its investors. it's one of the big success stories in the United States. I can guarantee you the people on this site that complain about it to the nth degree have no invested interest and nothing better to do.
Will buy back when this is Under $300
"Lumber down dramatically from the early May highs. This is good news for HD and LOW as they don't have to charge so much for lumber anymore. More houses can actually be built now and home improvement is cheaper. Everybody was so worried high priced lumber was here to stay...relative to the norms it may remain slightly elevated but production is starting to come back online and eventually supply will meet demand too. Long term HD and LOW, as well as private Menard's will also see robust booms in their business, and I shouldn't leave out the SHW will see robust demand as well for their paints. Bottom line, the soil is getting more fertile for these names. Falling commodity costs will let these retailers lower their price points, which should allow revenue to explode and for supply to finally meet demand."
350.00 tomorrow!!!!
Not that I care all that much but we are down 40 pts in what? 6 weeks?
The Home Depot store in our area have changed a lot. They do not carry as much as they used to.
HD is down 15 points pre open.
Dividend raise of 32%! WOW. compounding at 72 is a double.
3-1 maybe 4-1 split AND announce massive buyback. HD is a bluecollar company but has a white collar share price. Get back to the basics HD and don't forget what got you here. Long term stockholder.
No stock split announced
Thank God for Lowes dragging us higher!
I am a longtime holder of HD. I love on days like this when my Chinese stuff does nothing. And HD steps in and carry’s the ball.And I suspect they will be declaring a div soon. Love that too. They were not div payers back in the 80’s.They grew into that.
