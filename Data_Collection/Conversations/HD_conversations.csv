Wonder when this stock will have a 2 for 1 split
Canada just ended its bond buying program (taper)... USA to follow... rates going up aka housing market going down.
The stock market is so frothy it's insane. There is zero reason for HD to be trading at these levels. Given the valuation there is major downside potential at earnings unless they massively beat.
Up 10 percent in a month 120 percent in a year Double the profit?
Sales up 4 percent? Stock up $100 in a year?A little confused.
Have been watching this from the sidelines for a while now. Still haven’t seen a good entry point and now has become too expensive for me
Buy Buy Buy Thanks
YTD up over 105 luvn it!!
This stock is priced to perfection. If earnings on the 16th are not spectacular this will head south fast. Buying here seems like a bit of a gamble.
Who in the H is Loop Capital ? Another analyst out of the woodwork to stop the Momentum.￼ so they all get paid
"GDP contracted to 2% this month.. Pending home sales down... China crashing, rates rising etc. This will be a great stock to short soon."
One of the highest quality U.S. companies continues to make all-time highs and all we have here are some piddling whining posts that the price is too high. The institutions that do their fundamental research do not agree!
People are walking out the door without paying and no one is stopping them.
"It is a great time to be an HD stock holder and in it for the long run but, a caution to HD stock holders. Hd is held by over 70 % institutions. These people have made a lot of money in the last month and will be selling to take there profits. I have personally owned HD since late 80s. It has taken me years to build my shares up to what most people would call chump change. I can not tell you the #s of times I sent in a hundred dollars at a time into a drip plan. I was planning on using this as part of my retirement. I have concluded HD alone is my retirement. I own 8 other stocks and all of them are in a DRIP plan. Drip plans work for a person in it for the long hall. I hope all of you who own HD for the long run the very best luck"
Another new all-time on the open above 367!
I do not concern myself with what some analysts spouts I am confident in HD
Any other shareholders have a problem with HD donating money to BLM/Antifa?
Home price index just came in less than expected. Rates rising. Ruh roh.
I've written here 6 months ago to buy the dips. I stated then end of year 350 to 355. and it's well on the way.. bought 100 shares more at 319. enjoy my fellow hd investors. ya got to love capitalism.

1 month up over 30.00 keep lo on and enjoy the gains and dividend
The Home Depot reached an all time high at 363.22

"Loop Capital reminds me of Colin (Jeffers ?) who made a call to sell AAPL at $100 now adjusted for the split its what $700. Colin ""resigned"" and is somewhere of less importance"
The Home Depot reached an all time high at 370.72
"Loop Capital downgraded HD on 10/6 at approximately $327/share. Now it's up 9% in 8 trading days. Where is Loop Capital? They should be publicly called out about their BAD downgrade........or were they buying on their downgrade. The organizations have no souls, it's all about trying to take the money from retail investors to give to their ""rich"" clients."
The Home Depot reached an all time high at 354.57
I'm in at $22 LOVE HD!!!
Vaccine and mask mandates makes more unemployed .More time to go to Home Depot.Don’t worry about the money.
Who says stocks don't grow to the skies every day?
HD hit all time high today. Every single shareholder of Home Depot is in the green. Congrats!
where will hd be in one year from now ? $385?
"If your a small investor then Understand the RiCH do NOT pay premo CRAZY high 25 p.e. for a ""store"" that has MANY peer store COMPETITORS!! This stock should be trading a ONLY a premo high of 20ish × earnings! When market corrects,, Sure the RiCH will buy AT a p.e. of 8-10 or $125 a share!! *Do NOT SHORT big on this fake pump as that will fuel the H. funds to take it higher as they pay big bucks to buy your info! Make no mistake, they have ALL your info via cash they pay for it!!"
So honestly I did not think hd would move this high this fast this year. I predicted 350 by eoyear. just glad I bought 224k at 319 few months ago. incredible story on this company. don't worry be happy.
P&G just warned about freight cost might hurt earnings.Will it hurt HD?
"Dividend is too low, valuation too high. Does anyone think it can climb from here? https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-developers-report-sharp-drops-in-monthly-home-sales-11634037472"
Big Guys need Buyers?Look at the chart.Buy Buy Buy
Let's hope we get a stock split soon. It's due.Once it reaches $400 - they might announce
Stock split soon!
"Motley :Still not overpricedDespite Home Depot's impressive gains this year, it trades at a lower multiple than the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, with a 12-month trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 26 compared to 28 for the S&P.Rival home improvement retailer Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) has a PE of about 24, but it's less profitable than Home Depot. In its most recent quarter, Lowe's reported has a net margin of 7.41%, compared to 10.55% for Home Depot in the comparable period.Home Depot outperforms Lowe's on several fronts, in part because it benefits from larger economies of scale, and because it has a larger percentage of professional contractors as customers. Its net margin has grown consistently each year from about 3.5% in 2009. Lowe's has also grown its net margin from about that same level in 2009,but Home Depot has proven over these years to be a more profitable operator."
