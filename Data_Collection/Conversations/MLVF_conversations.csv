MLVF reached a 52 Week low at 11.26
Why would you do a secondary a few months ago only to turn around and do a buy back? I am sure there is a good reason that offsets the appearance of lack of planning.
Finally found a solid BUY $50 target.

"June quarter results estimate $0.20 ($18.72 08/97/2921)Based on CALL report on Malvern Bank and assume corporate overhead stayed at $371K, earnings would be $1.59 million, or $0.20 per share.—Interest income was up slightly in spite of smaller loan port.—Not surprisingly, mortgage revenue practically evaporated and total fee income returned to historical norm.—The bank doesn’t standout in any way except that non-owner occupied loans is too high but trending down..—NAL remains high at $23.76 million. $23.35 million of which are paying after loan modification and interest income are not recorded, part of the reason for depressed net interest income (which was never great to begin with). By and large it’s working through the past mistakes, I. e. NY real estate loans. The future of those loans are still not clear.—Bank level ‘other overhead’ crept up this year (by $386K so far) which also penalized earnings. They seemed temporary. Are they related to selling the bank? I wonder.—By and by, MLVF is in a pickle jar. Share price reflects that.—A sell may be the only means to reward current shareholders. No Sale, No Gain."

"Henry,CNOB/Centre’s 2014 merger expected $7 million cost savings. But CNOB’s ROtE was 12% pre-merger and closer to 11% afterwards. In 7 years shares price was up only 35%, or 4.4% annualized. And with dividends. 6% per year. Hmm"

"March quarter report is out.Loan port, interest rate spread, and fee income all soft. MLVF barely earned $0.30 due to the absence of provision.Outlook brightened per Weagley but PPP loans along with fees will soon run off. Book value now $19.17.Shares at $18.50 not particularly attractive with 0.73% ROA.Only reason to own is expecting a sale."
a little disturbing that with the salaries they have no insiders are buying at these levels
