"PCRCF Goldman Small Cap Issues $0.30 PT On High Cobalt DemandEV battery industry doubles use of cobalt, nickelProducers of electric vehicle ( EV ) batteries doubled their use of cobalt and nickel last year as auto manufacturing demand increased, according to South Korea's INI Research and Consulting.The battery industry's cobalt demand last year rose by 102% from 2017 to 16,629t, while nickel use climbed by 101pc to 41,521t. Lithium use for EV batteries increased by 76% to 10,902t, while manganese demand rose by 36% to 17,673t, as a shift toward more high-capacity models pushed consumption toward cobalt and nickel that yield higher energy density.Shipments of EVs with lithium secondary batteries last year rose by 71% by capacity to 95.7GWh, INI said. China remained the global leader in EV demand, accounting for 58PC of car shipments. China also had a 126% rise in cobalt use to 9,092t and a 123% gain in nickel consumption to 17,605t. Chinese lithium demand climbed by 78PC to 6,461t.With Such a High Demand for Cobalt and Nickel, it’s No Surprise that Our Top Electronic Vehicle ( EV ) Play of 2019 Just Received a $0.30 Price Target from Research Analyst Goldman Small Cap Research.This optimistic valuation represents an upside of over +129% from today’s closing price.https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PCRCF/uj6YeryI-PCRCF-Goldman-Small-Cap-Issues-0-30-PT-On-High-Cobalt-Demand/"

"Well, I just had too... buy me ""The Little Book of Stock Market Profits"" by Mr. Zacks.. had to see the way Zacks comes up with their recommendations.. as I started to be in the mindset that they were trolling my messages.. I've found this little company BWEN without Zacks but still grateful for the backup.. $NEXA is another I found before Zacks came in with TWO NOW.. news about it within the last week.. so what gives? Maybe they just trying to sell more memberships.. I don't have memberships.. I just do the work out de kindness of me heart.. give it all away.. right here.. my favorite message boards since Clintons day in office... due to health.. don't have no worries or fears of who I may offend.. hehe THE MAX"

I'm just sitting here wondering why the numbers changed specifcaly the last year REV and the last QT REV.. of course the CAP changed due to the rise in price, but why these other two have changes??

Any advice about this ipo ?
"One of my favorites for now.. cheap for what they have in equity and rev.. earnings also following along.. I've most of my cap tied to this one.. as well as NINE (value score 11.46) which is 2x NEXA (Value score 7.31).. but this company came up for nearly 4X the avg companies I put through my formula to find bargains.. IFMK (VS=7.95) looks good if your like most and enjoy a Chinese dinner.. Made with real Chinaman (a little Halloween humor).. I also like the natural gas segment with BWEN (VS=7.15) building turbines for this fuel.. i would guess to produce electric.. These numbers may change with the market conditions. I may change my mind without warning.. You may lose all your money, but not to my stupid mistakes.. Good luck wit awl dat jazz.. hehe THE MAX"

Oh.. and we will be in need of more zinc.. I use to be the electrical engineer for a small capacitor manufacture in NW Florida with satellite plants in two other states.. We used a lot of zinc wire to spray weld the ends of these caps.. We also will be in need of more batteries if we gonna do this deal of becoming all electric society.. hehe THE MAX
