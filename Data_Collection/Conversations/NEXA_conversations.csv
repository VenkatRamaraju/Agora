"PCRCF Goldman Small Cap Issues $0.30 PT On High Cobalt DemandEV battery industry doubles use of cobalt, nickelProducers of electric vehicle ( EV ) batteries doubled their use of cobalt and nickel last year as auto manufacturing demand increased, according to South Korea's INI Research and Consulting.The battery industry's cobalt demand last year rose by 102% from 2017 to 16,629t, while nickel use climbed by 101pc to 41,521t. Lithium use for EV batteries increased by 76% to 10,902t, while manganese demand rose by 36% to 17,673t, as a shift toward more high-capacity models pushed consumption toward cobalt and nickel that yield higher energy density.Shipments of EVs with lithium secondary batteries last year rose by 71% by capacity to 95.7GWh, INI said. China remained the global leader in EV demand, accounting for 58PC of car shipments. China also had a 126% rise in cobalt use to 9,092t and a 123% gain in nickel consumption to 17,605t. Chinese lithium demand climbed by 78PC to 6,461t.With Such a High Demand for Cobalt and Nickel, it’s No Surprise that Our Top Electronic Vehicle ( EV ) Play of 2019 Just Received a $0.30 Price Target from Research Analyst Goldman Small Cap Research.This optimistic valuation represents an upside of over +129% from today’s closing price.https://www.tradingview.com/chart/PCRCF/uj6YeryI-PCRCF-Goldman-Small-Cap-Issues-0-30-PT-On-High-Cobalt-Demand/"

"The world’s largest Gold companies have been busy acquiring rivals within the last year, with Barrick Gold buying Randgold Resources in January and Newmont Mining acquiring Goldcorp in April. So i would say a small capital Gold company will do best especially when we are expecting an increase in Gold Prices. Here is one if you are interested. https://stock-trading.exchange/7ahj4"
