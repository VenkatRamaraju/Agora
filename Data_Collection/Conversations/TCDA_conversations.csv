"Tricida got their letter and it's mostly horsesh!t. The FDA is clearly stalling and I can't figure out why. They say they're seeking more data ""regarding the magnitude and durability of the treatment effect of veverimer on the surrogate marker of serum bicarbonate and the applicability of the treatment effect to the U.S. population.""Which suggests they want another trial but in my limited experience actually just means the drug is fine and Tricida can provide the additional data in other ways that will take 2+ weeks to organize, send, and be reviewed.AKA STALLING"
I agree Siva . I would also say every one on this board will be amazed how high this stock will be by next year .
Victory !
Science behind deleterious effects of excessive acid production on all body systems and kidney in particular is very sound. How TCDA product can control the silent killer is exciting prospect. I think an average nephrologist knows this .
"Insiders started buying ! Post-market went up by 15% ! October 19th company has meeting A with FDA! There is highly chance for approval, in this case target  is min $25An estimated 37 million American adults (1 in 7 adults; 15% of adults) are estimated to have CKD, but most don't know they have it. In fact, about 1 in 2 people with very low kidney function (not on dialysis) don't know they have CKD.Based on this simple fact this medication has huge market and becomes as standard of care for all CKD pts...."
A tribe from Mozambique today has purchased 10 TCDA shares.Why? They really believe in Vevy.
"Two more days to go...Message to funds that sold, U sold at bottom. U R welcome to buy back above 30 once FDA approves. Seen this movie played before...Give a month or two and company will address FDA concerns and drug will be approved that benefits so many CKD sufferers. Only sad songs to this scenario is that many will have to wait for FDA to approve before it is allowed to use...Buy the knock down shares and hold for good news...Buy small and keep it to 10% of your portfolio...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always..."
"I have been in the biotech/pharma industry since 1997 in Market Research, Forecasting and Competitive Intelligence. I started with Immunex who discovered, developed and launched Enbrel which is the 7th best selling drug of all time. I was on that launch team. In April of 2019 I interviewed with Tricida for a similar role. They ended up going with a local person because they didn't have the budget to pay my relo fees. As you might imagine, I did significant research in preparation for the interview. Never in my entire career have a seen a drug with so much potential in terms of unmet need, massive size of the market, life threatening disease and complete lack of competition. Even if the FDA mandates they conduct another trial delaying launch for two YEARS, this stock is massively undervalued.This could be a $5 billion a year blockbuster which would value the stock at well over $200 a share."
"Wow below 15....Common MMs (Market Manipulators) get PPS down below 14 so people could buy...So there is uncertainty and no visibility from mgmt on FDA. You have to wonder why mgmt would say we do not know if we can take care of it when they haven't even been notified on the deficiencies...You have to wonder if P3 trials were done properly. Then again, FDA approved NDA application and P3 trials are usually done by independent firms that specialize in running the trials. Mystery continues...IN the meantime MMs will keep knock down PPS by recycling to get weak retailors to give up their shares using death spiral. Until a real buyer (not retail, but institutional fund) steps and start to buy....Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always..."
"What happens if fda does not approve, do you think tricida will survive as a company? Any long term benefit to holding onto shares if no fda approval on veverimer?"
I bought 135 shares @13.25. Hoping for good news. If thereâ€™s bad news and the stock tanks will there be a chance of a recovery? Looking at the chart this is as low as the stock has ever been for so there could be a chance of a recovery or perhaps Veverimer could get approved at a later date? Thanks.
"What are your thoughts on this? Replying with linkThe FDA assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date of August22, 2020 for the potential approval to market veverimer in the United States. Wehave been working cooperatively with the FDA on review matters related to ourNDA. However, on July 14, 2020, we received a notification from the FDA statingthat, as part of its ongoing review of our NDA, the FDA has identifieddeficiencies that preclude discussion of labeling and postmarketingrequirements/commitments at this time. The FDA stated that the notification doesnot reflect a final decision on the information under review. The notificationdoes not specify the deficiencies identified by the FDA. In our late cyclemeeting with the FDA, held in May 2020, we addressed two substantive reviewissues that the FDA had raised in advance of the meeting, namely concernsrelated to the magnitude and durability of the treatment effect on the surrogatemarker of serum bicarbonate demonstrated in the TRCA-301 and TRCA-301E trialsand the applicability of data from the TRCA-301 and TRCA-301E trials to the U.S.population. At the late cycle meeting, we presented our rationale for why webelieve our data addressed the substantive review issues raised by the FDA.Because the July 14th notification does not specify the deficiencies identifiedby the FDA, we cannot be certain what the identified deficiencies are or whetherthe deficiencies relate to the substantive review issues raised by the FDA in connection with the late cycle meeting, or other matters. While we planto work with the FDA to resolve the deficiencies referenced in the July 14, 2020letter, we require additional information from the FDA before we can evaluatewhether and how we will be able to address those deficiencies. We believe we arelikely to receive that clarification in the form of a Complete Response Letter,or CRL. Consequently, at this time we do not believe we will receive approval tomarket veverimer in the United States by our PDUFA goal date of August 22, 2020,if at all."
"Unbelievable....I checked company website and results of P3 clinical trials and this drug works and could be life saving for many with chronic kidney disease and yet it is held up by FDA. Fumy ting is FDA accepted NDA. They usually review NDA before accepting for review......If it was COVID-19 related, it woud have been approved as emergency use. My guess is that all the approvals are working on COVID-19 tests and vaccine filings and this got relegated to some junior reviewer who is fresh off the college who don;t know how to handle it...In the meantime, all those patients that could be helped by the drug suffer...Go check P3 clinical data. The drug shows high statistical effectiveness vs placebo and have lower mortality...Company is continuing post trials for additional support...Now worth shorting when company has ~500M in the coffers, I think it should be enough to take the drug in to production so no secondary...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always..."
"I read the press release about their talk with the FDA and seems they have a big problem. And I see they are laying off over half their workforce. But I don't understand what this means for the future and what the plan of action is. Will they have to do a whole new trial? Will a new trial satisfy the FDA (assuming the resukts are satisfactory)? Or do they plan to close up shop? Laying off that many employees gives me the impression that they are drastically curtailing activities, at least for the near future. Where do they go from here? Appreciate any opinions."
"With 30 million Americans affected by chronic kidney disease, the market potential for TRC101 would seem to be considerable. It will help that the nonadsorbed polymer has a completely benign safety profile, is relatively inexpensive to manufacture compared to biological drugs, and becomes even more effective over the course of a year of treatment. I think that the ultimate determinant of the market potential/annual revenue from the product will depend on post-marketing phase 4 studies to establish the long-term benefits on patient morbidity and quality of life."
"Fda requested more info on ""magnitude and durability"" of effects of veverimer. Durability is understandable because almost all fast tracked trials suffer this setback. Just need a little more time to verify results last longer. Magnitude likely meant ensuring that magnitude of results continue to hold up over more time - really a durability issue. As magnitude of current results have already been presented."
75% of the company has been laid off including the majority of the actual scientists. If I had to guess I'd say the company is no longer looking for drug approval and is now looking for a buyout.
Tricida EPS beats by $2.62https://seekingalpha.com/news/3601245-tricida-eps-beats-2_62?utm_source=selerityinc.com&utm_medium=referral
"The FDA assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date ofAugust 22, 2020 for the potential approval to market veverimer in theUnited States. Tricida anticipates that it will receive furtherclarification related to the FDA notification of July 14, 2020 on orbefore the PDUFA goal date of August 22, 2020. While the company has noadditional information from the FDA since the July 14, 2020 notification,at this time, the company believes it is unlikely to receive approval tomarket veverimer in the United States on the PDUFA goal date."
The announcement is due by 8/22. Any news if that date is still in play or getting pushed back?
