"Nice dip and recovery today. Id like to see that pattern continue, and trade off of to recoupe some losses."
"I read the press release about their talk with the FDA and seems they have a big problem. And I see they are laying off over half their workforce. But I don't understand what this means for the future and what the plan of action is. Will they have to do a whole new trial? Will a new trial satisfy the FDA (assuming the resukts are satisfactory)? Or do they plan to close up shop? Laying off that many employees gives me the impression that they are drastically curtailing activities, at least for the near future. Where do they go from here? Appreciate any opinions."
Tcda just upgraded to strong buy!
Pretty close to cash value with FDA meeting coming up
"""After previously exiting a position in the fourth quarter of 2020, Point72 Asset Management leader Steven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio) disclosed a new 5.03% stake in Tricida Inc.

So no interim data until 2022?
$7. today!
EXPECTED EPS= -1.46 vs ACTUAL EPS= -.98
VRCA just went through the same thing with an NDA - same letter. That stock is down 40% since news. But it fell for 2 weeks before gaining its footing. It does seem that they had more information to share about FDA issues. Just thought I draw the parallel in case anyone was doing research or trying to figure out what to expect. Feel free to share other similar cases.
market is green....election day....is still cheap...load in target $40...
For those who are gun shy wait till AUgust !
Finally catching a bid with all that cash. Buyout ? Might be leaking....
Funny!Strong buy at 35 with target of 50+!Hold at 10 with target of 25!It should be other way around!Hindsight is always 20/20!GLTA in stock casino!
load some potential $40......
"Be patient if you plan to go long. Once short term selling is done. In Oct, new path forward will be announced and new NDA submitted then PPS will pop and sell your shares since new funds will be buying!It's how market works. Don't get exuberant rather sell in exuberance and buy on despair!GLTA in stock casino!"
What are the chances that it's something simple like asking for more details on the manufacturing process or the chemical composition of the polymeric drug? (It's not as simple as a small molecule.)Has this issue occurred with other companies making binding #$%$
I knew this would pop today. When a stock takes such a huge plunge buy for an uptick of a buck or two. You have months to trade this.
Tricida is up 15.21% to 6.49
"Tricida got their letter and it's mostly horsesh!t. The FDA is clearly stalling and I can't figure out why. They say they're seeking more data ""regarding the magnitude and durability of the treatment effect of veverimer on the surrogate marker of serum bicarbonate and the applicability of the treatment effect to the U.S. population.""Which suggests they want another trial but in my limited experience actually just means the drug is fine and Tricida can provide the additional data in other ways that will take 2+ weeks to organize, send, and be reviewed.AKA STALLING"
"Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2020 were approximately $375 million. Tricida currently has $75 million principal amount of debt with Hercules which is scheduled to be amortized from April 2021 to April 2023 and has $200 million in outstanding principal amount of 3.5% Convertible Senior Notes which mature in May 2027. Just bought 20k shares @ $3.98. This goes back up to 6 to 8 level. Just a delay. Eventually gets approved. Be patient."
Lost 772$ today and Dan don’t reply to this message go get a life
"Two more days to go...Message to funds that sold, U sold at bottom. U R welcome to buy back above 30 once FDA approves. Seen this movie played before...Give a month or two and company will address FDA concerns and drug will be approved that benefits so many CKD sufferers. Only sad songs to this scenario is that many will have to wait for FDA to approve before it is allowed to use...Buy the knock down shares and hold for good news...Buy small and keep it to 10% of your portfolio...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always..."
 Just stay tuned - it could be a bomb after the FDA guys know what they want and turn on the switch. 
The announcement is due by 8/22. Any news if that date is still in play or getting pushed back?
Someone is buying for some reason. I wonder why?
No approval this year! May be end of next year. Accelerated is misnomer used by FDA. Over 90% of drugs take normal time frame even if accelerated designation!Most likely FDA wants to resubmit NDA with modifictaions and then will sit on for another year before anything happens!That's hpw ity goes. Go check others and you will find same!Next time short the stock like TCDA situation once FDA delays. Guaranteed money on the street since funds must sell once FDA delay kicks in due to window dressing effort!Not worth shorting at this level. Easy money has been made by shprts and probably cover slowly as asks gather!GLTA In stock casino!
"After thorough research this weekend across the entire market, I find this stock to have the best potential atm. The CEO might be screwed after his selloff the day before the stock tanked, but this stock has tremendous upside at the moment"
"Recently had multiple buy ratings with a PT of $50. If this FDA FUBAR issue gets resolved quickly, we could be in for a nice rocket ride! Definitely worth taking a flyer on. I should’ve either sold at the open or bought at the close today. I’ll hang onto these bags for a little as there’s plenty of upside and they’re already so far along in their clinical trials.https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TCDA/price-target/"
"This will get an approval and be bought before the year is out, 70-80. Nearly a sure bet."
"Great closing!!!! 6,66 the devil""s number! Just great."
"Very soon Vevy will trade at 2$....bankruptcy coming,OTC welcomes Vevy"
GREAT NEWS GUYS/INVESTORS.....TRICIDA CEO thanks to those who invested and lost money investing?!
One trick pony stock here. If their current drug fails they are finished.
Sales force got the axe today.
"Christmas sale is coming soon: buy 1 share for 5 cents ,get 9 for free"
Can I assume Dan has shorted this stock?
Big volumes means SP will go down even more and this is a good thing for bankruptcy.Vevy is never.
What’s going on?Market tanking & this pops?
First to the party 
CEO and others will remain dedicated to sell you their shares for 5$
The new 13fs show the big Bio-tech players allbought this IPO and are still buying on low volume.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tricida-end-business-210500860.html
looking strong for power hour
"When will this pos stop falling? I bought more at $15.20 and ONE minute later it tanked to $15.05. Then soon after that at $14.88. It's fallen low enough. After passing the trials, no way the FDA will deny Tricida their drug. IMO"
I agree Siva . I would also say every one on this board will be amazed how high this stock will be by next year .
"Well, we now know why this tanked on Friday. tricida received the CRL on the 21st. Big money always knows."
How soon do you think TCDA will go bankrupt?
So what are peoples' opinions? Is there a reasonable chance the FDA found something significant enough that they won't approve Tricida's drug even though it p#$%$ed phase 3?
Time buy some tomorrow onward!Wait for path forward and new NDA submission events in 4Q!Should see closure of gap to 15-16 range once the future path is known with above events!GLTA in stock casino!
5$ tomorrow...if

Catch up before it reaches $40 the big guys are buying and they now it’s going to get approved if you read what the FDA is asking for you will see the approval is coming sooner than you think buy before it goes up the 40
"Best case scenario is that clarification of the ussue was provided, and FDA has accepted the Corrective Response Letter with a newly scheduled PDUFA goal date."
"I doubt there will be any approval or PR on Monday...Mgmt has been wrong on number of of times in last 3 months....If you check initial news release on update on Jul15 (2nd para. last sentence)""However, at this time the Company is unable to evaluate whether it will be able to address the FDA’s concerns.""Here is the linK: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tricida-provides-regulatory-veverimer-210000055.htmlWe donlt know if we can address the concerns when they don;t have the info. Zero confidence from mgmt. Strike one..The ER news release stated that on update section (1st para) on Aug 5:... Tricida anticipates that it will receive further clarification related to the FDA notification of July 14, 2020 on or before the PDUFA goal date of August 22, 2020. While the company has no additional information from the FDA since the July 14, 2020 notification, at this time, the company believes it is unlikely to receive approval to market veverimer in the United States on the PDUFA goal date. Here is the link: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tricida-announces-second-quarter-2020-200500420.htmlNo clarification coming before 8/22. Mgmt wrong again! Strike two...Where is strike three? It already happened. Mgmt has systematic selling plan implemented before drug is approved. Most bi-tech exec do not sell any stock until drug is approved to show mgmt's confidence in the drug. Strike three...Fortunately for longs, the inning or the game is not over. Drug still has good potential and probably will get approved down the road. Rookie mgmt and rookie results...No PR on Monday. Nothing on FDA side that says they have to provide info by PDUFA date..In the meantime, very sadly millions CKD in US and others around world suffer...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always..."
Sit tight folks and wait for news next week!Not worth day trading here and give back your shares bought this AM!MMs will try to cover later today! They do the same thing that you are doing. Short in the morning and cover shares after 1 PM!Good things come to those who wait!GLTA in stock casino!

Very bad news.
TCDA reached a 52 Week low at 19.25
"Wow, something is up in pre market. Looks like its on the express back to $20+"
"Wow below 15....Common MMs (Market Manipulators) get PPS down below 14 so people could buy...So there is uncertainty and no visibility from mgmt on FDA. You have to wonder why mgmt would say we do not know if we can take care of it when they haven't even been notified on the deficiencies...You have to wonder if P3 trials were done properly. Then again, FDA approved NDA application and P3 trials are usually done by independent firms that specialize in running the trials. Mystery continues...IN the meantime MMs will keep knock down PPS by recycling to get weak retailors to give up their shares using death spiral.

"With 30 million Americans affected by chronic kidney disease, the market potential for TRC101 would seem to be considerable. It will help that the nonadsorbed polymer has a completely benign safety profile, is relatively inexpensive to manufacture compared to biological drugs, and becomes even more effective over the course of a year of treatment. I think that the ultimate determinant of the market potential/annual revenue from the product will depend on post-marketing phase 4 studies to establish the long-term benefits on patient morbidity and quality of life."
The whole stock market is
"It's good news folks, not bad. No safety or clinical issues just need more magnitude on results: https://ir.tricida.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tricida-receives-complete-response-letter-fda-its-new-drug/"
"Insiders started buying ! Post-market went up by 15% ! October 19th company has meeting A with FDA! There is highly chance for approval, in this case target  is min $25An estimated 37 million American adults (1 in 7 adults; 15% of adults) are estimated to have CKD, but most don't know they have it. In fact, about 1 in 2 people with very low kidney function (not on dialysis) don't know they have CKD.Based on this simple fact this medication has huge market and becomes as standard of care for all CKD pts...."
"Some response should be announced by MondayCould be good or bad, but given the simplicity of the drug, and excellent safety, my bet is on some sort of adminstrative delay in approval not a delay that requires new trials. They met pre-approved endpoints and got fast track, so I am betting a mostly positive response letter."
"NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / July 16, 2020 / Bronstein, Gewirtz & Grossman, LLC is investigating potential claims on behalf of purchasers of Tricida, Inc. (""Tricida"" or the ""Company"") (TCDA).

"Ill wait for the next analyst call on this. After the Earnings, price target was dropped to $40 but still a buy. That was with expectations of the CRL."
TCDA started with a buy rating at Goldman Sachs. Shares rocking it today.
"If U want to still gamble, buy today preferably late in the afternoon. This is a 1-day dsell off. Those who are selling sold of in July so day traders exiting with loss on PDUFA expectations!Accumulation for Oct announcement on next decision from FDA!It was no brainer that FDA was going to reject drug and CRL after July PR!GLTA in stock casino!"
Bought more at $13.19. But hope it bottoms soon because I'm running out of cash to buy more.
"short term is not look good, may go in 3 or 4 range in next few weeks. Cash in hand will help to move in the long term. Going to accumulate little by little when it falls."
Approved! https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/tcda/forecast
maybe waiting for Monday morning if its good news
A tribe from Mozambique today has purchased 10 TCDA shares.Why? They really believe in Vevy.
"No drug approval on PDUFA date of 8/22. BTW it is Saturday...The drug was never reviewed or voted by cardio and renal committee due to covid-19 and FDA sat on it for over 9 month after NDA acceptance and probably just realized month before PDUFA date that the drug was up for approval...Most likely, FDA made up deficiencies to delay the approval and give themselves more time...ST neutral and LT buy. Drug will get approval. Question is when. In the meantime millions will suffer...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always..."
we need to see $6 ....by the closing bell...then to the moon  by Monday.
"all in. pumpers and shorters be d#mned, COVID drugs are holding TCDA back, there's no way a highly marketable heavily needed chronic kidney disease drug is going to be ignored forever when big pharma can exploit the hell out of its absolute necessity."
TCDA is up 11.68% to 32.80
The only good news is CEO will take hone some good solid paychecks before the funeral of his company
"Fda requested more info on ""magnitude and durability"" of effects of veverimer. Durability is understandable because almost all fast tracked trials suffer this setback. Just need a little more time to verify results last longer. Magnitude likely meant ensuring that magnitude of results continue to hold up over more time - really a durability issue. As magnitude of current results have already been presented."
Thinking about buying into this. You guys think it’s gonna go back up even a couple dollars. Or no
Any one know the PDUFA Date?
"The best we can hope for is a PR Monday morning before the market opens. If we don't have one, then this could tank again on Monday, IMO."
In at $4.60. 1000 shares. Worth a gamble here.
"Bought some below 15!Next month or two would be great tie to buy in at a good discount. Drug works and nothing bad has happended in P3. In fact, great efficacy and lower mortality was observed in P3 trials. Keep the faith and wait for knock down shares to move in slowly!Buy low and sell high comes to mind!GLTA in stock casino!"
"Wow...It would be great if this tings goes down to 12.5...It is already a bargain at 13, but it would price the drug at 3-5/sh resulting in 150M if you discount for cash on hand...Can U say overdone...Thank the funds that are selling. They need to get out. No matter what the loss...This is gift and going long is no brainer..Buy tomorrow and let the professionals handle accumulation today...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always.."
I’ve never seen a stock go down on good news. What’s going on? Am I missing something? Is this a good entry point￼?
where is the the typical Pre-FDA approval run-up? Or am I too late and missed it already?
SHOULD CLOSE OVER 5 TODAY. SO WHAT ANOTHER TRIAL. PRODUCT IS GOING TO PASS IN THE END.
Strong company with strong leadership and a slam dunk product with FDA ready to approve it...Winner! $60+ in a year.
"This was accelerated and took one year. Why approving and rejecting a drug should take more than a year. Clearly, FDA process wasting investors and companies time and money and prevent the new drug reach patients in a timely manner. Either FDA need to hire more competent and efficient personnel or it needs to hire more people to reduce the time to under 4 months to making a decision on approval or rejection."

Dan in panic mode
Any News I miss?
"So it was just a label problem. So, labeling is not part of NDA or is it????I guess FDA wanted all i's dotted and t's crossed...In the mean time, millions suffer when there is medicine in the wings waiting to be approved...Still don;t see nay approval on 22nd (PDUFA date)...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always...."
What happens if they run out of money?!
It looks like they didn’t collect the right data the FDA wanted during the trial. Really unfortunate mistake on the companies part. Will have to do another trial. Can’t believe this is happening.
"Best Scenario:1. FDA approves drug with caveat that labeling issues need to be resolved before any sales.2. Leaving the company with go ahead to start working on starting the production of drug.3. Once labeling gets resolved, production rolls with proper label affixedWorst case scenario1. Drug not approved 2. Labeling issue need to be resolved3. Once resolved, drug get approved4. Start production of drug Good Luck to all and o your due diligence always..."
After such news stock should bounce back up to 40$ in few decades.I think it was 50$ 52weeks ago.But going up....its a different thing....
Many times I said TCDA is a great co.
Load in more
"I have been in the biotech/pharma industry since 1997 in Market Research, Forecasting and Competitive Intelligence. I started with Immunex who discovered, developed and launched Enbrel which is the 7th best selling drug of all time. I was on that launch team. In April of 2019 I interviewed with Tricida for a similar role. They ended up going with a local person because they didn't have the budget to pay my relo fees. As you might imagine, I did significant research in preparation for the interview. Never in my entire career have a seen a drug with so much potential in terms of unmet need, massive size of the market, life threatening disease and complete lack of competition. Even if the FDA mandates they conduct another trial delaying launch for two YEARS, this stock is massively undervalued.This could be a $5 billion a year blockbuster which would value the stock at well over $200 a share."
Orbimed and Bakers Bros Are still holders ... Dan seems like he thinks he is smarter than the 2 top biotech hedge fund guys out there ...Hmm..
can anyone tell me when it will start going positive? will it have positive growth?

Morgan Stanley designated TCDA as the most valuable in 2020.WHY? It is not easy to take the company down from $ 44 a share to $ 4-7.Well deserved this nomination.Great news.Great company.Great story.Great mgmt.Greatest Veverimer.
Anyone that bought in at $15 cutting losses today?
"Buy end of next week unless you are accumulating no reason to jump in!Just watch as funds dump waiting for retailers to get best price, selling will end buy EOW since it is EOM!Stack the odds in your favor!If good news comes out in 1 to 2 months and that's small if then sell your shares above 30. No reason to sell in the 20's. PT is about 50 by analyst and convertible bonds convert around 33-34 so convertible would not convert until 40 or so, Probably hammer lock around 40 until convertibles get sold off. No reason to hold above 40 but around 35 would be good short term profit price!GLTA in stock casino!"

None of it matters, the approval process does not change. Spread the word to bio-tech community and investor forum. No short cuts...Only quick approvals are for emergency approval as the case for COVID-19 items...It will languish here until updated NDA filed sometime in Oct/Nov time frame and FDA will sit on it another year. If there is a pop on NDA filing or acceptance sell ad get out. Two years for approval is not accelerated program. This is after all the clinical rials are done and they take must o time. It should be called DELAYED program. It still may get delayed further depending on how updated NDA is received..Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always..."
We will test 10$ this week ...
I bought 135 shares @13.25. Hoping for good news. If there’s bad news and the stock tanks will there be a chance of a recovery? Looking at the chart this is as low as the stock has ever been for so there could be a chance of a recovery or perhaps Veverimer could get approved at a later date? Thanks.
Two of the most recent high profile rejections have been for lack of long term data. (Gilead and Biomarin). I suspect a long term setback here to prove duration of effect?

$50-60 IMHO upon potential approval...then maybe buyout?!
"Why is the FDA/TCDA waiting to the last moment to inform us about the deficiencies? Now I'm becoming concerned that Aug 22nd will come and go and we still won't know anything. Maybe the FDA won't tell TCDA until Aug 22nd, and then TCDA will issue a PR next week? Wish they would get this over with."

Holding strong.. any news now and it will pop back up
"This stock will get de-listed. I purchased it when it dropped from 30 to 15. Then it plummeted to 6. And now again to under 5. This is terrible. If you are risk taker, go ahead and buy. But I recommend avoiding!"
"Call prices are super high - over $1 for March $7.5 Market obviously expecting announcement of good news, or at least a high chance of good news at earnings this week (the sudden announcement of earnings was also rather puzzling)."
"Well, looks like no news before market open. I'm kind of doubtful now that we will see anything today. If there is no news by market opening on Monday, then IMO this will tank."
Hot news guys!Some people from TCDA are now in Kabul Afghanistan.They are saying after bankruptcy company to focus on drawing posters and sell poppy seeds near Bora Bora.Hopefully the afghan company will sign the partnership with TCDA. 5mil $ cash money is on the table for Tcda.
Next news within 30 days!Sad again for CKD sufferers. Company s already running long term clinical trial and FDA should have provided conditional approval for short term use and pending long term approval based on the running trial!That is more than one way to skin a cat!Hope that it is not snake eyes on next roll in a month!GLTA in stock casino!
"Type A Meeting with FDA is most optimistic meeting!! – is a meeting that is ""immediately necessary for an otherwise stalled drug development program to proceed.""

Any news on TCDA?
"The FDA assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date ofAugust 22, 2020 for the potential approval to market veverimer in theUnited States. Tricida anticipates that it will receive furtherclarification related to the FDA notification of July 14, 2020 on orbefore the PDUFA goal date of August 22, 2020. While the company has noadditional information from the FDA since the July 14, 2020 notification,at this time, the company believes it is unlikely to receive approval tomarket veverimer in the United States on the PDUFA goal date."
I think we will see good news by Friday just be patient
I love seeing people's bullish comments
"Does anyone know someone with metabolic acidosis? If so, is their doctor prescribing anything for it?"
It looks like this has bottomed because it held its support level and seems to be trending higher. Now is the time to buy for those who want to take a gamble the news will be released soon and it won't be terrible news. If the news that the deficiencies are mild and correctable in a few months this will skyrocket.
This stock is done ??

"It is apparent that for no news from a weak senior mgmt team, they will likely have to do more trials and with not enough cash left and running out of time, bankruptcy is imminent, and who will join or stay at a colony without a future? Too many other biotechs nowadays. Doomed"
Shorts are looking smart right now. 34 from 42
"Never ever Vevy sold so many shares in 1day....great day guys....bankruptcy coming,great day what a release."
Possible bankruptxy
time to get out and move on...i have mine for grabs today and the rest of the week
Investors need to be of the mindset that this may take some time. Once the labeling issues are resolved then we need to look at any CMC issues. It could be a very bumpy ride but long term looks bright. My only real concern is this company is a one trick pony and if things don’t work out we’re looking at a pretty low stock price.
"Such a great company to invest in....Orbimed,Berkshire,many others are buying all they can....Long life Veverimer....see U in 2099"
75% of the company has been laid off including the majority of the actual scientists. If I had to guess I'd say the company is no longer looking for drug approval and is now looking for a buyout.
If you are retail short time to cover this week!!!What a awesome ride it has been on coattails of funds that are dumping last week and this week!Cash in our chips while they are hot and in the money!Time to reverse and go long this week!Buy low and sell high! Do exactly what institutions do with some delay and yo will win in he stock casino!GLTA in stock casino!
I hope they will have Veverimer/Sudan style approved in the 4th quarter 2041
"Unbelievable....I checked company website and results of P3 clinical trials and this drug works and could be life saving for many with chronic kidney disease and yet it is held up by FDA. Fumy ting is FDA accepted NDA. They usually review NDA before accepting for review......If it was COVID-19 related, it woud have been approved as emergency use. My guess is that all the approvals are working on COVID-19 tests and vaccine filings and this got relegated to some junior reviewer who is fresh off the college who don;t know how to handle it...In the meantime, all those patients that could be helped by the drug suffer...Go check P3 clinical data. The drug shows high statistical effectiveness vs placebo and have lower mortality...Company is continuing post trials for additional support...Now worth shorting when company has ~500M in the coffers, I think it should be enough to take the drug in to production so no secondary...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always..."
Lets hope in 2022 Veverimer will be at least approved in the country of Sudan-Afrika
I guess -8% its a good day....its a usual day on OTC
What's going on??
I have never seen such a vague fda response before. Really odd. They couldn't be a bit more specific ? Makes you wonder if there is not funny business for crooks in the system to make money.
"If this delays FDA approval by a year, I think today's drop is priced correctly. So you could buy in and have dead money for a year if there is a delay. If FDA questions are minor and technical vs. problems with the trial protocol or controls, this will bounce right back to the mid-20's. At this price it might be worth getting in and watching carefully. If you were already in (not me) then might as well hold and see what the FDA really said. I bought a couple hundred shares looking for a little bounce to $18‐19, but am prepared to wait it out if it drops on a serious, delay causing, FDA line of questioning."
"Looks like people are bailing. Guess the company silence is scaring people out. But I just rolled the dice and bought some more at 13.55. It's a gamble, but I figure we will hear something sooner or later."
CEO has a 0/3 track record for bringing a product to market with FDA approval. I feel so bad for the underpaid scientists who signed onto this company with the hopes of making a difference. They did their part and made a drug that works just to have the marketing and clinical trial team throw their hard work straight into the trash can. How do you botch your clinical trials so badly? Did no one in any of these meetings mention that it might be bad if all of the clinical test subjects were Caucasians from Europe when your main target audience are minorities in the U.S.? Company is looking for a buyout but with the product in its current state the big drug companies smell blood in the water. Will be lucky to get pennies on the dollar right before they declare bankruptcy.
I’m loading in big time at 7$
"Bleeding has stopped. Even up a few in AH. At least I'm not on margin. Hopefully a daily trade pattern will set in that can be played, to make up for this dip. Dip. I meant crater."
it will be good news guys. Fda was concerned about label and distribution. it is easily fixable. no issues for drugs.
Gotta love that pre-market!
Has anyone even looked at their debt load? How about the massive cash burn from interest expense alone? Oh and by the way they don’t have any operating cash flows.
anybody else cutting losses at this point?
Looks like PPS is starting to bottom based on last 5 days....10 is good entry point or upcoming news in October since Type A meeting is within 30 days...Sad for the CKS sufferers who need this medicine. FDA has really thrown monkey wrench into wole thing despite no safety issues...
i think this is going up big tommorow
TRICIDA is a great company.A year ago stock was at 40$......coming down from 40 to 5$ in 12 month its called WISDOM
Today TCDA CEO will be more than happy to sell you all his shares.
Wow wild swing today! Now down $2
"My guess is the CRL has been received. As stated by Tricida, there is not expected to be an approval on Aug 22. Or this could just be filling the gap from Monday. It does not look like panic volume yet."
"Solid accumulation here at 10....Looks like someone is plan to score once FDA and company agree on path forward...Still, updated NDA must be submitted and another 9-12 month before FDA decision that will lead to End of 2012. Aourn 6 more quarters. Burn rate is around 1.15 - 1.20/sh/quarter... So cash level at end of 2021 will be around 2 dollars/sh..."
"Buy shares todey for 5,50$ and tomorrow for 3-4$.The CEO will make profit for anything he sells above 0,70 or so"
Great company:buy buy buySoon will be the strongest co in Uganda.
Here’s my guesstimate of SPLow price before approval $8-10.One trick pony no approval $2-3.
What's the rationale for the huge up?
nibbled at 13.26. Volume still below average. Here's to 'not so bad news' over the weekend. Totally gambling on this.
"SO, selling continues....Buy at EOW/EOM since selling will be done...Buy low and sell high...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always..."
Not much of a dead cat bounce today. I should have sold when it was $17.50 today. I had my finger on the trigger but didn't do it. Could have bought back cheaper.
99% shares held by institutions. Wow but hmmmm
"So, P1,P2 and P3 clinical trial data is no good. Sorry, I doubt it!It's all there for everyone to see and drug works. It has better results than placebo and has no serious side effects. What is the problem other than FDA having delay due to COVID-19 and no Cardio/Renal committee!PPS is looking very good here!Funds always sell irregardless of PPS but will always buy with limit on price. That's where retailer have biggest advantage!Stack the odds in your favor! It is easier than card counting at BJ!GLTA in stock casino!"
Grabbed 3000 at 16.50 what a score!
$TCDA median target updated to $40 - 178% upside. https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=TCDA
LOADEd up more shares! cmon man! whats up with the stock! No news!!!
Everyone buy this and get it to 10$ today and loading in more and telling my co-workers
I made a video about Tricida ($TCDA)Check it on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDkJTogpAk8Can they make x20?
we will see a strong finish today Veverimer and TCDA after hours going up to 40-50$
A big tribe from the Amzon jungle is interested to aquire TCDA....they were fallen in love for the posters about Veverimer!!!!
Tricida reached an all time low at 8.06
"Inexperience senior mgmt team is in full display on how they deal with CRL, short"
Many nephrologists using off label meds and never get approve by FDA and based on hospital culture / fellowship training become part of pts care ... there are couple good studies support declining acidosis significantly by using this medication but now FDA is looking for correlation between Hco3 level and outcome !!!!! Common FDA !!!
Shorting soon
Science behind deleterious effects of excessive acid production on all body systems and kidney in particular is very sound. How TCDA product can control the silent killer is exciting prospect. I think an average nephrologist knows this .
Victory !
"What are your thoughts on this? Replying with linkThe FDA assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date of August22, 2020 for the potential approval to market veverimer in the United States. Wehave been working cooperatively with the FDA on review matters related to ourNDA. However, on July 14, 2020, we received a notification from the FDA statingthat, as part of its ongoing review of our NDA, the FDA has identifieddeficiencies that preclude discussion of labeling and postmarketingrequirements/commitments at this time. The FDA stated that the notification doesnot reflect a final decision on the information under review. The notificationdoes not specify the deficiencies identified by the FDA. In our late cyclemeeting with the FDA, held in May 2020, we addressed two substantive reviewissues that the FDA had raised in advance of the meeting, namely concernsrelated to the magnitude and durability of the treatment effect on the surrogatemarker of serum bicarbonate demonstrated in the TRCA-301 and TRCA-301E trialsand the applicability of data from the TRCA-301 and TRCA-301E trials to the U.S.population. At the late cycle meeting, we presented our rationale for why webelieve our data addressed the substantive review issues raised by the FDA.Because the July 14th notification does not specify the deficiencies identifiedby the FDA, we cannot be certain what the identified deficiencies are or whetherthe deficiencies relate to the substantive review issues raised by the FDA in connection with the late cycle meeting, or other matters. While we planto work with the FDA to resolve the deficiencies referenced in the July 14, 2020letter, we require additional information from the FDA before we can evaluatewhether and how we will be able to address those deficiencies. We believe we arelikely to receive that clarification in the form of a Complete Response Letter,or CRL. Consequently, at this time we do not believe we will receive approval tomarket veverimer in the United States by our PDUFA goal date of August 22, 2020,if at all."
CEO of the afghan company saying:they are happy to aquire TCDA being a great and a solid company with good results...for example TCDA is down for the year - 79%.Strong performance for TCDA thats why the company is rewarded with the honour to be no.1 player in the poppy seed business in Afghanista.TCDA will have their headquarter moved to Kabul near Bora Bora
https://www.americanbankingnews.com/2021/07/22/tricida-inc-nasdaqtcda-director-sells-10050-00-in-stock.html
do we know if valor study will support approval?
Yes bad news going to under $8
"Guys wake up.Veverimer died,now its only about their paychecks....few more and thats it.Next year stock will trade under 0,50$.Forget about Orbimed and others.Veverimer is in heaven."
"Speculation on my part, but the only thing I've seen that could account for today's big dip is the news that in November an insider hedge fund with a large TCDA stake sold about $11 million in the stock. Doesn't seem like a very big deal to me, given that the fund still holds over $250 million in the stock."
"Fingers crossed...we all hope this year they are kaput...vevy never,vevy kaput"
"Any news on Tricida's type A meeting result, it has been weeks."
"The chart looks great...in last 12 months they came down from 44$ to 4,so yes...investors should remain optimistic!Im sure TCDA will work hard and draw posters while doing business with poppyseeds in afghan mountains."
good nwews guys: TCDA CEO thanks to all those who bought share at a high price and also to everyone who will buy today.
No Medicare Part D coverage. That is 70% of the target audience. That will be an incredibly hard sell.
$375MM + R&D is worth more than current trading price ! Sell the company!!!!
huge buy orders in
"Howdy all, new to all this stock stuff. I'm bullish on TCDA because of this: https://www.ajkd.org/article/S0272-6386(19)30168-4/fulltext#secsectitle0100There is a TON of emerging evidence that treatment of acidosis in CKD at any stage improves mortality. Vevemir has shown it will correct acidosis, so it should also help mortality. The studies will show this once powered appropriately to detect the differences. As a doc I'm surprised the FDA did not allow fast track status as we know correcting acidosis helps."
What’s the market potential for the drug once approved ?
"Place your bets. Whenever the next news is released, whether good or bad, it's likely to cause a big move in this stock. And if you haven't decided before the news release, you will miss the move. So if you believe it will be bad, get out now. If you believe it will be good, buy soon."
"Looks like selling done already. Hopefully, MMs (Market Manipulators) work hard to keep PPS below 15 for those who are accumulating!ER next week is none event. Analyst will ask about FDA response so I doubt mgmt has any answers since they need to meet with FDA before details are know. It would be surprising if there is anything serious since P3 trials and original NDA submitted last Nov had no glaring comments!GLTA in stock casino!"
pre market just collapsed.
"TCDA is at its lowest price ever. Based on the FDA feedback, this doesn't make sense."
"What happens if fda does not approve, do you think tricida will survive as a company? Any long term benefit to holding onto shares if no fda approval on veverimer?"
didnt verified this source but.....TCDA will come back stronger then ever with VEVERIMER in 2050
"We can say TCDA is a great company.Yes,we can call any company great whose stock goes down in 52weeks from 44$ to 6$. -2021..maybe 2022 TCDA will be well deserved a bankrupt co."
"My guess is great news for tomorrow....stock will move up from 4,82 to 4,83!!!!!"
Here is the inancila situation for those who wantsto be spoon feed:1Q earnings PR:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tricida-announces-first-quarter-2020-200500630.htmlCompany has around 300M cash at the end of 1Q:and raised another 200M at end ofMay. Here is PR:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tricida-announces-closing-offering-200-200500502.htmlSo cass at end of 2Q (6/30/2020) should be aoudn 420M acounting for 60-70M burn in 2Q for Valor-CKD study and other expenses.Selling ends this week!!!!2Q ER next week!GLTA in stock casino!
Vevy bankruptcy on the horizon...this is the news we were waiting so long time....great day great day just came for us.Vevy for ever.NEVER.
"Funny!COmpany has about $8.7/sh in cash with drug that works and has no safety issues. Can you say irrational!Worst case it will be another year before approval. If FDA accelerated program is really accelerated, it may get approved by EOY or 1Q2021. If company talked about accelerated program like FDA they would be sue for bait and switch in any court. Fortunately, govt is immune to prosecution!Place your bets wheel is about to spin for about a year before we found out where the ball landed!GLTA in stock casino!"
As expected no news from mgmt. Nothing came out of FDA...Things in limbo until something definitive comes out of FDA....Sad for all CKD sufferers when drug is available but could not be obtained until FDA approval...Daytraders getting out before the weekend. Back to support level around 13...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always...
Don;t be in a rush to buy immediately. Buy some here and there when PPS is knocked down!Plenty of time to buy in next month or two before updated news comes out!Not a ST trade rather medium term buy & sell!GLTA in stock casino!
$450MM in CASH. STRONGLY RECOMMEND!
"Straight down from 42 to 36, that was quick"
"Any news on Type A meting. It has been more than 30 days dudes...Looks like ship is sinking into deep waters...Headed to 2-3 based on net cash value (cash = 8.73/sh - debt=5.38 = net cash 3.35) , but company is burning around 4.5/sh in a year so next year it will be -1.15/sh in debt with additional capital needed to finalize drug launch if drug is approved...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always..."
"The question is, if the Corrective Tesponse Letter is accepted and a new date is set, will this spike back to 30 or even Pre-Covid 40? Interesting play here."
soon we will be able to buy TCDA shares on OTC/PINK market of course under 1 $
im loading alot here
will this get above $11 in a few months or should I average down to try to get rid of it?
lets go fda miracles do come true
"Cash on hand will slowly dilute throughout 2021 and 2022. At the end of 2022, company either dilute the stock or disappear completely."
"If you believe in company's P3 data then you buy on FDA delay. Hold for approval by in next 3-6 month. Company has plenty of cash to start production. If you don't believe in P3 clinical data, why bother buying at all...Makes it simple...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always..."
Looking strong picked up more shares on dip!
What's the point of an Accelerated Approval pathway if the FDA decides at the VERY END the surrogate endpoint is not good enough?
20% down short term then back to $25 when they finally get approval.
Whoever can sell this tomorrow for 7$ will be lucky
Some good news...biggest ETF from Sudan wants to invest 10000$ in TCDA stock when this one will be available on OTC market!!!!They were advised by Orbimed and others.Lets hope this business goes through.
Don't get fooled by shares traded only around 30-40% of total is real due to HFT so around 2-3M out of 50M has been traded!The main funds are sitting tight! The story is intact and P3 clinical data is still in play!Worth a gamble after 2 years and knowng P3 data. I think it IPO'd in the low 30's without P3 data!GLTA instock casino!
Pay day next week!
Thumbs up if you think TCDA will make an announcement before trading closes on Friday. Thumbs down if you think they won't.
https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200824005200/en/Tricida-Receives-Complete-Response-Letter-FDA-New
Stock should be tomorrow 6$
Missed the dip today. I never follow my good ideas. lol
This company has the same specialty and similar issues with the FDA as ARDX. Don’t get caught in a similar ordeal.
Investor Relations are muzzled. I emailed a query with my phone number. I usually get something by now.
"TCDA declared $1.16 EPS equals 8% quarterly, 32% annually. That's even without it's new drug which the FDA didn't disapprove, so that means it's approved pending clarification the FDA requested regarding labelling to be detailed by the FDA this Sat. Tcda is above a strong buy! Tricida EPS beats by $2.62 https://seekingalpha.com/news/3601245-tricida-eps-beats-2_62"
Wow who’s buying?
CEO/EVP just bought 102k worth of shares today at 6.84. This guy better be serious lol
"Look at TNXP coming this week. Are we all on board?If not,put your last $$ for it going to be a terrific ride."
Good news coming in....a co.from Kazakstan interested to aquire TCDA for 100000$ !!!!!1 mil$ in cash and 10 mongolian horses
"I will average down when SP will be at 0,01$,maybe ill buy 1mil.shares"
Going to have at least a 30% bounce in the morning. Sorry Dan
"A business man from Afghanistan wants to buy TCDA for 1BITCOIN...its a very good offer,Bitcoin will go up in time."
"What a gift!I wait to buy once selling is done. FDA does this with just about every drug so this is not new!On the bright side, it probably will get resolved in 3-6 months. Once NDA is submitted most of clinical trials are done and just matter of getting things lined up!Be patient before you buy. Company raised 200M last quarter on top of 280M it has on the coffer. Enough cash to ride through end of year and wait are short term delay!Those expecting PUFDA by AUg 20 is leaving and don;t want to wait around. Look at PPS history and low over last 5 years when company is on the cusp of approval and launching th e drug. Not much time to wait!Be patient and pick up later. None of the big funds will sell. The story has not changed!GLTA in stock casino!"
I just started a short position
Many african companies interested to aquire TCDA!
Just started a position in TCDA last week. I like that TRC101 has a straightforward mechanism of action to reduce metabolic acidosis and clear evidence of efficacy and safety from phase 2. I also like that management has considerable prior experience dealing with big Pharma and bringing polymer-based drugs to market.
Where is Dan? speak now
