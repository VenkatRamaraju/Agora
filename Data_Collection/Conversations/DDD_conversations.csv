"Jan, come out post A3D down 12% yesterday from 17c to 15c... LOL"
"This is just a good start, analyst upgrades will follow. they don't need analyst upgrades yet but sure there will be a few upgrades when it peaks."
"$SSYS I'm guessing that today's sharp stock rise (on a day when $DDD is down), has to do with the $DM purchase of $XONE . Earlier this year when Stratasys announced they were dropping their metal printer to focus on polymers, I was disappointed, as they had spent millions on development, only to jettison it before it was even released. I thought it might in reality be because $DM told them they didn't want the competition. $DM of course has been sharing the $SSYS reseller network for some years: Stratasys was concerned they might start losing some of their exclusive network because they had no metal printer for the network to offer to complement their polymer printers. Now I wonder if this new $DM deal hasn't been known by $SSYS for some time, and THAT'S why they dropped their metal printer. We now have a powerful, broad spectrum metal company linked to an equally powrful, broad spectrum polymer company (of course Stratasys was an early investor in DM also). An eventual formal combining of the two companies? I have no idea of the underlying practicality/desirability of that, but at least their present partnership is very promising. They should be making some noise."
I don’t know what I would do without my daily emails from (http://trademarketview.tech)! They help me make the most of my trades and never let me down! Don’t know how I ever traded without them!
Lol W. DDD market cap is 2x PRLB. The brain surgeon wants a 1-1 merger. He must not understand share price is not the market cap.
Today SSYS reported a quarterly loss of $0.02 per share and is up 14% so what will happen when DDD reports a positive earning on Aug.9?
"To all those inexperienced, this is not small buyers and sellers looking on message boards selling out, this is institutional selling their percentage of DDD, maybe more then 1, The earnings messed these short sellers with their pants down and now they divesting themselves. I have a feeling they go long about $28 or so"
In the future food will be 3D printed from the airPhones will be 3D printed film Both markets are massive
30 is the new 17
"Jan was a long for a few years so I believe he was a trapped long, however, he became a short last week. I expect that Jan will again be a trapped short. From $50 to $5, if he held, he only saw his account balance dropping from $5000 to $500 but nothing actual happened as long as he held, the shares but if he shorted the shares, he will be forced to close the short position on margin calls."
Chart showing Triangle Breakout. Will be up significantly early next week.
16% short of the float and the price is well above the average shorted price. Time is on bull’s side because DDD is moving in the right direction. The good time that most of the stocks in our account are moving higher is probably over. Any loss from DDD short positions will not be compensated by the gain of other stocks from now on. Another huge surge of DDD price will cause accelerated short squeeze and that is the writing on the wall.
"Half billion cash on the balance sheet and no debt, positive earnings in 3 consecutive quarters, and deep pullback from 52wk high $56, this stock is set to re-test $56 within 2 weeks."
W yesterdaychart is ready for $34- unstoppable.
This is the sixth consecutive drop since the earning. what is going on?
DDD will be at least $13 higher than SSYS after the dust settles....
"Hold long term. But, play intra-day put options. Buy every time W posts something bullish, and sell the puts 2 hours later."
great results I think
Whose crying now?
Why is DDD worth 4 Billion market cap versus 1.5 billion for Stratasys ? Sales are about equal.Stratasys has half the share count of DDD.
"when shorts start attracting W, a yahoo message poster, you know shorts will soon lose everything."
"Jan, do you touch yourself?"
"So, they're selling pieces that don't fit their core of HEALTHCARE and medical. Simbionix was their strongest healthcare segent"
W - Why isn't it happening again?
Only DDD and PRLB have positive earnings so these two will go up and the rest of 3d stocks will stay low.. and DDD will catch up PRLB per share price.
"All - I spoke to my friend W. He and I agree that this goes higher. But, we differ on target prices. I am thinking we stagnate in the mid-30s. He says $69.69. It's a number he seems to love."
"i see DDD as a composite specialty material play, the company is creating all kind of new composite materials and use 3d printing to put them into thousand of high performance applications. the CEO has MS and PhD in composite and metallurgy. I love his vision. other guys are more interested in selling printing machines and printing inks."
What luck I bought before the reports I earned nicely today advancing towards Gate 60 tomorrow and so on up to 100

"Guys SLM solution is recruiting to be listed in the US, looking at comparable US listed 3D company ( ex. Velo3d SPAC >1B) it should boost this German company !"
"Australian 3d metal printer developer Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX ) has made approx. 135 percent since July 23, 2021. you should not solely always look at US stocks. You might miss some opportunities then."
They had some interesting insights about DDD on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
The stock pressure down is the hedge funds and institutions trying to get the stock as close to pre earnings numbers as possible as most of the short sellers got screwed and get their options better positioned. sadly not enough interest or buyer's to support higher price
Looks like the new base is $34.50-$35
JMIA & DDD are oversold and undervalued - IMO
"All these 3D naysayers/bashers/smashers don't want to forget that our CEO purchased 4,100 shares of DDD out of his own pocket - a very BULLISH event if you ask me..............PERIOD."
3D Systems stock downgraded at Craig-Hallum on Reddit-driven rally
"DDD price will go up while the rest of the 3d stocks will stay low. We may see Xone under 20 before the merger. Without the buyout news, Xone would have dropped to $15 on the earnings’ day (afterhours), 10% drop from previous $17 close"
Got out at 38 yesterday. Limit buy set at 31. May go lower or not. PT within 2-3 weeks is mid to high 30s. 50+ by next earnings.
Wow! Amazing revenue 
DDD price will catch up PRLB because they have similar earnings per share. either DDD goes up or they meet halfway? i think DDD will move up and PRLB will wait there resting. cheers.
Profitable company with only 125 million shares and a cash balance of approximately $500 million with no debt and which is increasing earnings along with flexibility to continue making smart acquisitions. Is there a better one in this industry?
"I see the possibility of an acquisition of SLM Solutions by 3D systems. SLM solutions is controlled by Singers Elliot Fund via large holdings and convertibles. ark invest has a stake in it too. DM was rumored by Bloomberg in February to buy them, now others could come.Their 12 laser beast metal printer is said to be well received by customers. It might complement DDDs lagging metal business."
I will keep on buying
Out at 38. Will let this settle before coming back in. Might miss on 40+ but also learned from the last pump.Will come back once we build a new support or in low 30s
"If you bought an used lawn mower for $80 and take it apart. Sell the wheels for $10, bag for $10 and fuel cap for $5 and only keep the Briggs & Stratton engine and build a new super lawn mower. This is what DDD is doing right now. Think out of the box… LOL"
"PRLB downside is very limited, but upside is also not much without showing revenue and earning improvement. DDD will catch up PRLB sometime this year. SSYS will not see 30 this year. DM will go down because it carries a xone bag and pays out $170m cash (only Xone big share holders are happy)."
Charts said sell at 40 and that's what I did
Hoping for a big gain here so that W can get the help he needs. Pray for him.
"W, what's your price target? $100? $250?"
Sell and close puts - 2 hours have passed since W’s most recent exuberant post.
"HUGE NEWS!With this acquisition, 3D Systems intends to tap the growing opportunities in the smart manufacturing solution space. The company estimates that the spending on smart manufacturing is likely to reach $6.5 billion by 2025 from $1.5 billion today."
Is THE EXONE stock the next surprise??? Also 3D stock.... going to 40% up after tomorrow? Why not?
Tear down this wall Mr. W!
"Today, price is above Ichimoku cloud, first time in a about a month."
Down 20% from today's high on huge volume. Never a good sign.

LOL oversold. This is trading at 2x the value of it's competitors with no completive advantage at all.
DM bought Xone so it will carry a heavy bag going down the valley. I am not surprised to see DDD buy out DM when it is under $5 and DDD is above $100. It will happen sooner than we think

I believe this company will be around for a long time - Elon is a visionary. However, he is also quite nuts, and his ambitions have right now gone beyond the company's near term financial means. Within a year, we will see some restructuring and downsizing of expectations. October is a rocky month. We will see huge swings.

Do we have a chance back to 40?
Wohoo $50 is the next one. They have solid unique products
Wonder what this thing will do today
"MA50 $30.67, after secure this price, we see a huge price increase"
Nasdaq and momentum stocks continue to go higher and higher: DDD will follow the momentum stocks and go much higher.
"New PR, DDD will have $2/share earning by 2022, imoROCK HILL, S.C., Sept. 02, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) today announced two additions to its industry-leading materials portfolio – Certified Scalmalloy (A) and Certified M789 (A) - to facilitate demanding industrial high-strength, corrosion-resistant parts for additive applications in markets such as aerospace, motorsports & automotive, semiconductor, energy, and mold making."

DDD today bounced back from 50MA - hope you bought around 29.30 in the morning.
500MM in the bank - ZERO debt - leader in its industry of 3D manufacturing - with 124 MM shares outstanding - $27 a share ??? - practically inconceivable if U ask me !!!
Better after hours move than AMC!! Lol
DDD has the best performance among its peers this week comparing to last Friday's closing priceDDD up 10%SSYS up 4%DM down 12%PRLB down 1.5%Ignore Motley Fool's article because it wants to confuse people.
"The market was waiting the confirmation that DDD had real growth and positive earnings consecutively and yesterday, the company submitted a spectacular report and a half billion dollar cash in the bank. With this confirmation, there is no such thing that the stock goes up $2 or so continuously for weeks to reach new high. Super computers from the institutions are now calculating the company’s market value comparing to the peers and if the calculated market value is $60, then tomorrow, the price will be $60, no hesitation, It is market value."
A smooth 100% jump tomorrow would be nice
"Eh, I'm selling at my second 27.20 position. Not waiting for earnings call. Good luck to you longs."
Shorts failed. Will rise back to $40.00
DM/XONE merger will be a big competition for DDD
So SSYS has the same revenue and cash position as DDD after todays earning announcement. Only problem is DDD has 2x the market cap of SSYS. Houston we have a problem....
SURPRISE!! I am long today at 28..
Let’s all address a letter to DDD to hire W.. he is the most famous guy out there
"NNDM sales $3.5M and market cap 1.4B; DDD sales 600M, and market cap 3.7B, either DDD goes up to $500 or other 3d toy stocks go to 10c"
"$33.73, Bollinger top band price, price target for this week.."
"In Feb. DDD peaked at $56, SSYS was 57, Xone was 66 and Prlb was 286 and now we see where the others are. DDD is obviously the winner in the 3d sector. Chasing the winner and holding the winner are the basic rules in stock investment."
Bargain
I feel this is a great buy on the pullback. I bought this morning. They have shown multiple quarters of earnings and revenue beats showing that the future is looking bright for them.
Wow….the analysts are sure eating crow on this stock today.
Take away the hype and this stock is worth $15 a share at most.
"no doubt, this is set to re-test 52wk high short term and after that, to run up to the all time high."
for your information: I am still short on DDD.
"Ploy to bring in stock, todays ""Red day"" of trading on 1/4 normal volume, not many selling, stay strong and long.."

"Even with all this positive news, the stock is falling. There's a reason most analyst PTs are under 30$."
This stock has no strategic advantage over any of their competitors. Hit the sell button and thank me later.
Will this stock ever get to $40 again?
DDD will have $500M cash on the balance sheet in Aug. after the sale transaction is complete.
"Buy DDD, PRLB, 3d stocks with positive earnings and sell SSYS, XONE, and other 3d stocks with negative earnings."

Congrats to W for outstandingly bullish posts at the high today. I had no doubt the high was in when he began gleefully posting

@W. It's on sale now for just 29.99. Buy as much as you can
LOL W with the post of the year. EPS of .37 per share would give you a PE of 250!

"Guys, I told you so: SLM Solutions 13 percent up at the moment in Germany and Aurora Labs 10 percent up in Australia last night."
Company now has declining revenue. Great call by W as usual.
It’s will go up even more..based on upcoming projects
Definitely cutting edge ground floor. Again well done
12% short. It has declined prior month
Upgraded to 40 from 25.big upgrade
Jan has been consistently wrong for five years! Accuracy rate less than 10%.
13F filings show institutions are buying in August in the low volume sessions.. obviously retail missed the boat and now we see they post they sold or they shorted (with fantasy shares lol) in an attempt to catch the boat?
thumbs up if DDD runs up Monday morning
"DDD is up after hours because DM announced to buy XONE. fine, one kid was playing toy and now two kids will be playing toy together and DDD will be the only adult. LOL, IMO"
Aurora labs 3D (A3D.AX ) Made 100% over the last month… take a look at it. It is high risk but then much fun.
Upward pressure building up.
"Ddd and Prlb 1:1 merger will be great. The joint company will become Apple, Google, or Amazon in the 3d sector."
Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX ) joint venture AdditiveNow has announced the signing of a 2 year contract with Alcoa for the provision of 3D printed parts and any associated design and engineering. According to a post of Aurora CEO on LinkedIn they presumably use their metal printer for the contract. A further step towards commercialization and the stock price rose 18 percent. Why not invest in such public start up? Higher risk but possibly higher return!
Buy American company stocks and hold – DDD
"Whether you like it or not, you cannot ignore that my analysis and anticipation that I post here is always working… go check the history of my posts.. see you at 26 DDD"
Organic growth is very very good.This company has done a great job at the turn around. It will be beating ER again and again moving forward with great growth and great profits.
DDD is now $10 higher than SSYS; will be at least $13 higher. Buy American company stock and hold
"DDD to host a conference call and webcast September 9, 2021, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. Outlook is great, buy and hold"

"You need to learn to read chart for yourself. I’ve lost big before reading pump and dump crowds before so I have few rules now. 1. Read chart and find the pattern. Week to month and years to max. 2. Look at their profit margin and what’s in their pipeline 3. Search insiders trading price to find a good buying point. They know better than any of us. When do they buy and what price do they sell at. 4. Check if institutions recently opened or closed positions 5. Check analyst recommendation is sell, hold, or buy. 7. Risk score8. Sector score"

LOL 30 is now the reinforced nuclear steel and concrete double layer wall. Buy and hold!!
"DDD signed a binding contract to sell a software business for $305m. Not sure why nobody here talked about this. Just by this transaction, with $305M cash revenue, $50 price is justified."
I sense that DDD will have huge M&A announcement soon and this explains why active (speculative) institutions keep buying these days. Wait (hold) to see
"Ddd’s recent rally was supported by the earnings and the rally was destroyed by DM/Xone buyout news, now after the dust settles, DDD price will return to after earing high and the rest of the 3d stocks will stay low or even lower."
An upgrade is coming soon!

"DM sales 40M, market cap 2B, DDD sales 500M, market cap 3.7B at the moment. DM has no sign to turn to profitable anytime soon; DDD is profitable for 3 consecutive quarters. If DM price was $5, DDD price should be $100"
I heard about DDD the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"30 is the new 17, remember my famous quote. LOL, I revise it to 31 is the new 17"
"when Jan was on Mohamad's side yesterday, we know retail long who wanted to sell had all sold."
Solid.
"DM and Xone now have a lot of lawsuit ads.. LOL, share price will go nowhere in a couple of month.. Investors will come to DDD"
Yes possible $37-$40 near term. Shorts will push it. Congrats
Down or Up? Came back to Pre earnings level! No use of rockstar earnings for longs!!!
"Ddd will be an artificial intelligence (AI) 3d manufacturer after the Opton acquisition, the first 3d company in the entire 3d sector."
"30 is the new 17; after 17, we had 41, now after 30, we will have ?"
Aurora labs (A3D.XA ) made 22.73 percent last night. Have you already invested?

"For those of us who can't read:Jagtar Narula -- Executive Vice President, Chief Financial OfficerYes, that's absolutely correct.

"All things DDD are in celebration right now. Don't miss your chance to enjoy! Remember 3D is actually better, even than DD! What we may be looking at tomorrow the beauty of 36DDD. Can you imagine that?"

Made good gain from Uranium stocks. predicted Uranium stocks would go up.
"31 is the new 17, buy and hold, we will see 34 in a week."
W - it’s happening again
Insiders are selling their shares. Andrew Martin Johnson Chief Legal officer of 3D systems Corp sold his shares at 38.20 in June and again in July for 25.80. He has been selling shares every month. I think it is sage to follow his move to sell at it is above $35 and wait to buy again at below $28. You can find insiders trading history very easily.
"I pointed out that DDD’s recent runup was interrupted by the DM/Xone buyout news. The reason is that DM and Xone had huge volumes on the buyout news and consumed 3d sector dynamic buying power which was critical to support DDD continuous rally. Unfortunately, unfortunately, Xone rained on DDD’s parade again, twice. DM announced this buyout news at the same time with a very bad quarterly ER so if there was no buyout news, DM price could drop 10-15% easily. A Xone share will be converted to $17 worth of DM shares and also $8.5 cash, so if DM continuously drop to $5, a Xone share will be 3 DM shares. The Xone buyout will cause a huge dilution to the DM shares. DDD up 20% after the huge earning beat was justified and the current downward pressure was caused by the turmoil by other 3d stocks so if we are still a 3d stock believer, DDD is the best 3d stock with proved positive earnings and huge potential."
People are finally waking up. This stock is trading at 2x the market cap of SSYS and PRLB with the same or less forward looking revenue. Hit the sell button quickly.
Switch toy 3d stocks to DDD. it is the perfect timing right now.
"So when DDD had a huge $56 rally in Feb and Xone stormed on DDD’s parade with its $50 secondary offering. Half year later, Xone major shareholders cash in $8/share? Buy DDD shares because it is a company with integrity."
"Price is now above MA10, ready to take 30 back."
At least 12m shares were shorted under $25 so what is the motive to free these trapped shorts? wealth distribution?
"Arks top position in their PRNT: SLM Solutions (AM3D) is one of the best performer this year in 3D printing industry. Guys, soon we will do official dual listing very likely indicated by their newest job offer of a manager for maintaining compliance with US listing and SEC rules."
New acquisition announced. Could this be the catalyst like the Collplant breast augmentation announcement that sends DDD to $40 tomorrow?
Next earnings will be $45 not $40 - IMO
buy with last penny we have and hold; it will go up significantly
revs inc big QoQ.Everything is picking up for this company and they are ready to go.
buy with no worries if we see SSYS is still up $1. DDD will have much better performance.
"if that is true, DDD will be $100DDD's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $0.37 per share and revenue of $588.35 million. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +436.36% and +6.09%, respectively."
"Aurora labs 3D stock total market cap $21m, down 40% from 52wk high, traded at 13c. I won't touch it."
Posted this morning to buy PRLB. Also 30 is the reinforced nuclear steel and concrete double layer wall - solid support. buy and hold
I think we will hold very well today. Let's see.
do earnings come out after the market closes or early today?
"DDD was $13 higher than SSYS three weeks ago, it will be $13+ higher again in Aug. so switch it when the gap is only $5"

"If you are more interested in bio printing, take a look at Swedish BICO (BICO.ST). I am neither king nor short at the moment. I wait for new announcements."
"The FED Minuted blew the market yesterday, i guess its going a bit more down and after the people realise there is no real alternative in inflationary times to stocks, it will come back. But i cut my position in half and wait for the little bloodbath to buy more."
