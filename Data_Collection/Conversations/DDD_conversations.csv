Bollinger bottom band price 26.08 so DDD is moving up from here.
Dude-E. Wish I kept SSYS longer. Sooner gone with my gut in contrarian trade to W advice.
"A quarter....25 cents....is current premium over SSYS in price per share. Not exactly what our resident ""genius"" predicted, is it?"
Market pullback is over; it’s time to buy ddd shares and enjoy huge October gain.
Poor supply chain performance and a company's desire to mitigate its shortcomings should be a boon to additive manufacturing (3D Printing). I wonder how well the industry is marketing itself?
DDD projects run rate revenues from the Oqton software to exceed $100 million by 2025.
"If 30 is the concrete nuclear steel wall, then we must be on the wrong side of it because we're not over 30."
W23 hours agoBollinger bottom band price 26.08 so DDD is moving up from here.
LOL W with the post of the year. EPS of .37 per share would give you a PE of 250!
I heard about DDD the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
@W. It's on sale now for just 29.99. Buy as much as you can
"Need W for more recommendations. Doing opposite of what he says is a real money maker. SSYS up almost 50% in just a few weeks. The jump came when he said not to buy it. W - what other ""great predictions"" can you share with us? You're a goldmine!"
W is lonely.
Selling out of panic is the worst. Believe in what you have and don't get trapped by global market manipulation.
"Endless disappointment. Always ""just another quarter"" or ""this time next year"". Story is always the same as the stock price deteriorates."
W trying to steer the subject to Jan. He pumped this at 56!
"Notice how this has no buy ratings? Notice how analyst PTs are low?No insiders are buying, and neither are institutions. Only way from here is down."
"stock is up today, and all short guys stay quiet."
Buy American company stocks and hold – DDD
"Ssys run-up will be over by the end of the day, it’s a perfect timing to switch to DDD- the only profitable 3d printing stock"
I start to worry about @W. Hope he is OK.
"Of all the stock advice services I have used, I find (http://Fairstox.com) to be one of the absolute best! Their advice is well researched, helpful, and up to date. I don’t know how I ever went about day trading without reading their newsletter first!"
"I usually swing trade this downwards, but ~26 is undervalued. Guess I'm bullish for my next trade."
W yesterday Replied to a reaction3D Systems Corporation@Greg 30 is now the reinforced nuclear steel and concrete double layer wall. Buy and hold.
Switch toy 3d stocks to DDD. it is the perfect timing right now.
Trading used to be such a frustrating experience for me. The losses mounted up until I discovered the winning service over at (http://Multistockalerts.com) check them out today.
Tesla have searched for 3d printing experts last year… can you remember when the 3d printing wave started…made me wealthy man to establish a family trust for my daughters.
"Now that an army of Jan’s have left this DDD stock, it is time for DDD to go up significantly. Jan was a trapped long for more than 5 years."
"if that is true, DDD will be $100DDD's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $0.37 per share and revenue of $588.35 million. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +436.36% and +6.09%, respectively."
W - can you re-post your belief in expected price differential between DDD and SSYS. Thanks
"DDD to host a conference call and webcast September 9, 2021, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. Outlook is great, buy and hold"
"a3d down from 16.5c to 12.5c, down 24% last session. Jan is counting bucks."
Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX ) joint venture AdditiveNow has announced the signing of a 2 year contract with Alcoa for the provision of 3D printed parts and any associated design and engineering. According to a post of Aurora CEO on LinkedIn they presumably use their metal printer for the contract. A further step towards commercialization and the stock price rose 18 percent. Why not invest in such public start up? Higher risk but possibly higher return!
"I see the possibility of an acquisition of SLM Solutions by 3D systems. SLM solutions is controlled by Singers Elliot Fund via large holdings and convertibles. ark invest has a stake in it too. DM was rumored by Bloomberg in February to buy them, now others could come.Their 12 laser beast metal printer is said to be well received by customers. It might complement DDDs lagging metal business."
Take this rare opportunity to buy more DDD shares. This drop is because of general market pullback- it happens once every quarter.
"30 is the new 17, buy!"
Looks like investors realize that DDD has no technological or commercial advantage over SSYS.I guess market cap of both companies will align somewhere at 2.5-3 B.
I am happy to have experienced the 118% gain in q3 21 on my baby daughter’s Position of Metal 3d printer developer Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX). Do you know a better 3d printing stock last quarter?
Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX) made 10 percent yesterday. When will you take a look at them?
"From Forbes article last february: “While the technology itself is amazing in its potential benefits to humanity, the business model for 3D Systems is also exciting, and one that is not new to the company,” Graves said. “For years we have developed and produced advanced medical products for the human body using additive manufacturing in a highly disciplined, process-controlled and FDA-regulated environment. With this foundation, if you look at the progress we have now made in all of the essential hardware, software and materials elements of bioprinting, we have the opportunity as a company to address a variety of applications within the human body. That’s why we’re increasing our funding and investment and expanding our partnerships to make these applications a reality. When you see this tremendous scaffold printed, and then you see blood flowing through it that could sustain human life, it’s remarkable, even for someone from an R&D background like me. I am continually amazed at the potential this technology now offers.”Graves sees the organs and tissues work as a natural extension of what’s already a strong business for 3D Systems. “In terms of the impact on our company, our healthcare business is growing nicely, now approaching half of the company revenue,” he said. “We believe that regenerative medicine will add to this growth, becoming a significant business in its own right in several years. This technology offers tremendous benefits for human life, whether helping people whose lungs or kidneys are failing, or offering remedies for someone who’s experienced facial or other traumas in their body. It’s sad when you think of the tremendous shortage of replacement organs today and that the primary supply originates from the loss of another person’s life. The only way to address these needs is through an alternative source of supply, and hopefully one that offers greater compatibility with the recipient of the new organ or tissue implant. With the progress we are now making, we believe that regenerative medicine, and the underlying bioprinting technology we have now demonstrated, can ultimately be an answer to this problem.”"
Where is W?
"Hold long term. But, play intra-day put options. Buy every time W posts something bullish, and sell the puts 2 hours later."
ARK last bought SSYS 666 shares and you all got excited?
"All - I spoke to my friend W. He and I agree that this goes higher. But, we differ on target prices. I am thinking we stagnate in the mid-30s. He says $69.69. It's a number he seems to love."
just grabbed 2 more calls on this downtrend. November's earning report just like 2019 & 2020 will smash it.
"Acquisition conference highlights: -Working on lungs plus two more undisclosed organs. -New location in texas dedicated to bioprinting research.-Minimal expectations for near-term results, overall long-term timeline. -Low competition area according to DDD."
"sell SSYS and buy DDD because now it is a perfect timing. In my analysis, SSYS will start a new round of huge drop after the 3rd quarter ER. Rising before the ER is a sure sign of a cliff diving after the ER."
W is playing with his Bollinger bands.
"This company - 3D Systems, Inc - is on the cusp of true financial greatness, imho. Congrats to all DDD stakeholders."
buy there is no difference between 29 and 30 or 40 when it reaches 100.
DDD looks like trash today - I bet it falls from here. Glad I am signed up to http://the-alphatrader.com/ so that I can get stocks that actually move!
A close today above 27.50 would bode well for Friday and beyond.
"MA50 29.11, nuclear steel concrete wall."
To the newbies to the board. You’re gonna find this place very informative. Other boards are entertaining. We’re all business here though.
"I looked DDD history and found that many years ago it did a secondary ($65) while Goodman Goldman Sachs gave a buy rating with higher price target, BUT, ddd never passed $65 after the secondary offering in the past 8 years. It dropped to $5. Now SSYS had a secondary offering ($30?) this year and you know $30 would be the nuclear steel and concrete ceiling perhaps. IMO"
Made good gain from Uranium stocks. predicted Uranium stocks would go up.
"Guys, let’s ride the 3d printing wave! Look also at PRNT form Ark invest! There are some diamonds in it. I know them, but if you do not, maybe buy this basket…"
"Ladies, gentlemen, and W - A winner has been declared this morning in the race toward a $17 price per share differential between DDD and SSYS. Many humbled prognosticators here wouldn't have thought this day would come."
"W. You should be ashamed of yourself. We all, myself included, regard you as the most intelligent person on the Board; I think it's obvious. We rely heavily on your advice. You steered everyone wrong though. I bet you owned SSYS all along, and were manipulating us. Shame on you."
"just got filled for 2,400 more @ $27 + .........................THANK YOU VERY MUCH, whoever U may be."
Today we will see huge pop from MA200; trade accordingly
They had some interesting insights about DDD on (http://Pick-stocks.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Our family trust bought shares of large metal 3d printer manufacturer AML3D (AL3.AX) on Friday at AUD 0.14 a piece. Take a look at them. Their printers are huge.
sell other non profitable 3d printing stocks and buy the only profitable 3d stock-DDD
"Buy DDD, PRLB, 3d stocks with positive earnings and sell SSYS, XONE, and other 3d stocks with negative earnings."
"If you want to ride the 3d printing wave overnight, take a look at Australia's two promising 3d metal printer firms Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX) and AML3D (AL3.AX). My family trust has invested there. Lool at my track record in DDD on this board!"
"30 is the new 17, no difference between 29 and 30 when it reaches 100"
"W, Do not worry. Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX ) Made 10 percent today!"
RC = root canal. Oh the pain.
"It would be awesome to be able to load up at $25 even or thereabouts - wish me luck, people."
"New PR, DDD will have $2/share earning by 2022, imoROCK HILL, S.C., Sept. 02, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) today announced two additions to its industry-leading materials portfolio – Certified Scalmalloy (A) and Certified M789 (A) - to facilitate demanding industrial high-strength, corrosion-resistant parts for additive applications in markets such as aerospace, motorsports & automotive, semiconductor, energy, and mold making."
We just became a biotechnology company. The potential here is in the tens of billions.. buy now and sell the end of 2022 for $100
Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX) made 12 percent yesterday as I said yesterday: Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX) seems to be a bargain after this days market turmoil
"Market indices down 1%+…. This marked down 3.3% on the open. W, how’s that wall at 30?"
this is due for a breakout post earnings. many positives going forward - ceo is providing clear focus in areas of large TAM; supply chain issues are leading to AM migration; profitable quarters lead to inclusion in indexes. lastly. chart shows a clear growth trend forward. ignore the short term noise.
"W. For most of the past decade, SSYS garnered a premium over DDD in price per share. We had a short squeeze and briefly became a meme stock 6 months ago, and that changed back then. What makes you so sure that change is permanent?"
"It is a bet on Aurora`s new metal printing technology. It can go bankrupt or to the moon. I like this risk-reward ratio very much. So, I gave my newborn daughter all of my Aurora Labs 3D stocks (300000) as a first stock present."
The DDD SSYS horse race continues. And our resident horses #$%$ has called a winner. I say he has called it too soon?.
"What was it , like a 35% gain on the last earnings? And then it got beaten down since about 30%. Textbook pump and dumper. Obviously a decent company but a Wall Street plaything with little respect when it comes to the equity."
Why do I feel like William Shatner in Jeff Bezos' phallic shaped rocket.DDD on the launch pad and ready to ignite.
wonder if we'll close in the red today following this great news - crooked manipulation if you ask me.
"3 D printing continues to be under appreciated and under utilized. It's possibilities have only begun to be recognized. Eventually, it will be relied upon in many more industries and daily applications."
Being actively flushed like a TURRD! So sad.
what are the chances of SSYS and DDD merging ?
"Lets ignore ABCDEFG, he is just a paid tool- own nothing, only selling his useless time to get pennies, dimes per post as a paid tool.Check what he said about TSLA 5 years ago. ""This stock in the next 6-10 months has 50-60% downside risk - worse if the market tanks in an across the board selloff.""he is doing the same bashing here and DDD will have TSLA style price movement as we all believe.ABCDEFG5 years ago$TSLA conversationPeople are really buying this thing here? I believe this company will be around for a long time - Elon is a visionary. However, he is also quite nuts, and his ambitions have right now gone beyond the company's near term financial means. Within a year, we will see some restructuring and downsizing of expectations. October is a rocky month. We will see huge swings. This stock in the next 6-10 months has 50-60% downside risk - worse if the market tanks in an across the board selloff."
Dude look like a lady Jan is back. What a tool.
"Roles have reversed, DDD is now following SSYS. VLD an old spac.I see $39 but needs to get through $29 first."
"By the end of the day DDD will still be higher than Sell-sell-yes-sell because people want to invest in profitable company which is DDD, now and and from now on."
"W....30 more cents, and we have share price parity. What say you?"
"They just got a big upgrade on Power Lunch. It was said what a great company this is , and mentioned their work in the medical world. Hold tight !"
"this will become true...W 7 days ago Replied to a reaction$DDD conversationNNDM under $5 some time this year.PRLB 85, DDD 50, SSYS 26, XONE 25, DM 8 prices in a month or two."
Get the shares as bashers are here for a reason- they want to buy and accumulate more shares. Why don't we see any bashers on the A3D board? because A3D is dead so no one wants to bash a dead stock.
"Last night, you could have enjoyed the ride on the 3d printing wave in Australia with metal 3d printer firms Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX, 12.5 percent) and AML3D (AL3.AX, 3.23 percent). Too bad that many of you only invest in the US."
"SSYS last rundown from 28 to 18 it took 1.5 month (June to Aug), lets see this rundown from 27 to 17 how many days it will take."
You folks have no clue. 3d printing of human organs for implant are 10 years away if they even get FDA approval. What earnings growth are you talking about? Seems like they are abandoning their core business and betting it all on a long shot.
"Other than the acquisition, which wasn't even a big deal, nothing significant happened since last earnings. They beat estimates hard last time and everyone blindly bought in, now it's on a slow bleed back to pre-earning levels. So, under 25 today or tomorrow?"
Ark bought another $3.5M today. They are in deep!
Should see movement soon!!
Take my money
"W is an actual crystal ball. He posts something exuberant at the intra-day high almost every day. It's usually a 2 hour phenomenon. Buy puts when he posts and sell them 2 hours later. That ""2 hours later"" would be now. We're seeing the lows now based on W's history. Put this in a spreadsheet and see for yourself."
Ok W. You have lost all credibility.
good thing i bought another call yesterday. acquisition and earnings beat coming up.
Is there a reason they have beaten this stock down over 30? That's usually reserved for misses. Anyone who bought the great last quarterly results got slaughtered.
"Industry leader so if you're in for the long haul (5 years +), you have a winner. For those with shorter-term horizons, the weekly chart remains on a sell signal. Resistance at 30. First support around 23, second support in the 17's."
"buy 29=30 when it reaches 100, 30 is the new 17!"
DDD Acquires human organ manufacturer using bioprinting company Volumetric Biotechnologies for cash and stock up to $400M (3D Systems Corporation)
I must to admit. @W was right when he said that 38 is concrete nuclear wall. The only thing he forgot to mention that it's from bottom.
"MA50 $30.67, after secure this price, we see a huge price increase"
"On Monday, ARK purchased over half a million shares of DDD... pretty promising (though Cathie has been on a real losing streak in timing, so it may not be such good news)."
DDD today bounced back from 50MA - hope you bought around 29.30 in the morning.
Chart showing Triangle Breakout. Will be up significantly early next week.
sell ssys and buy DDD. This is the setup for switching SSYS to DDD before SSYS drops below 20 and then 15. DDD will be back above 30 soon.
I spoke to W. We use a form of telepathy for that. He says the nuclear and steel wall is now at $17
Anonymous is sad
what to expect for upcoming earnings ? considering starting a position
buy shares under 30 when it goes below 30 temporarily.
"29=30, if you don’t understand this, find a cashier job from a grocery store."
"No worry about any severe drop due to market pullback. In the beginning of the pandemic, Nasdaq dropped to 7000, and now it is 15000 year and half later. Soon DDD will be back and above $30 without doubt."
"@ No oneYes, the key for high volume manufacturers is transforming the Bill of Material. Replace sub-assemblies with a single 3D printed part enabled via workflow software, AI (and some robotics if required). DDD heading that direction with last month's acquisition of Oqton."
"Ddd will be an artificial intelligence (AI) 3d manufacturer after the Opton acquisition, the first 3d company in the entire 3d sector."
It's easy to predict that tomorrow it's going to go up by 5%. And this small roller coaster will continue until the report
@W Can you enlight us and provide a new wall?
Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX) made 3.6 percent yesterday. They received the R&D tax refund from the government. So I estimate they are funded till quarter 2 22 and maybe do not need a capital raise before.

this stock needs some momentum. analysts and markets tend to underestimate every time and kept price low. Buyer exhausted.
I am back guys. It feels so good!

Many Ev start ups use metal 3d printers…
"Even with all this positive news, the stock is falling. There's a reason most analyst PTs are under 30$."
W pumped DDD at 56!
"Ouch, it's below 29. DDD does not disappoint when it comes to disappointing investors."
Decided to dip my toe back into DDD today. Half now ...half later if it drops prior to earnings release.
"I hope you all did the opposite of what W advised. Doing so, is sound investment advice. He advised selling SSYS and buying more DDD. The opposite was a homerun over short term. It's looking like a long term winning strategy as well. He should spend his time watching dirty videos, and not giving free advice."
if ssys price target is $42 then ddd price target should be $84!
Unless DDD has incredible earnings this stock is probably fairly valued or even slightly over-valued at this price based on DCF.
The street has thoroughly pulverized this stock since last earnings.
@W Give me your argument for why DDD is superior to SSYS
Post the same thing every 3 days! Buy American! Close your eyes. Bollinger bands post coming tomorrow!!
Hoping for a big gain here so that W can get the help he needs. Pray for him.
"In the beginning of Covid in March 2020, Nasdaq dropped to 7000 and now it is 15000. Now the world is well prepared for the financial market Covid2.0 or Covid3.0 so markets will continue to go up. We do need nuclear steel and concrete wall to contain the COVIDs."
"Finally, all acquisitions are done. After earning, we will fly and stay up... Approximately, we will have 15% more stocks issued for the acquisitions since this summer."
Hope the shorts crumble into nothing. Send this stock to $100 already!

PRLB makes much more money than DDD. W is slow.

"DDD (28.40) is approaching the downtrend line going back to the Feb. high. A break of this, and the first target will be a test of 40ish area."
