Ark bought another $3.5M today. They are in deep!
sell other non profitable 3d printing stocks and buy the only profitable 3d stock-DDD
"Why is DM valued much higher (13x Revenue) over DDD, SSYS, PRLB of around 3x Revenue..???Thanks in advance"
To the newbies to the board. You’re gonna find this place very informative. Other boards are entertaining. We’re all business here though.
"$DDD 3D Systems CEO Graves Buys Over $120,000 of Shares"
this stock needs some momentum. analysts and markets tend to underestimate every time and kept price low. Buyer exhausted.
"MA50 29.11, nuclear steel concrete wall."
"DM sales 40M, market cap 2B, DDD sales 500M, market cap 3.7B at the moment. DM has no sign to turn to profitable anytime soon; DDD is profitable for 3 consecutive quarters. If DM price was $5, DDD price should be $100"
"any stock the inept ""man"" ABCDEFG pumped falls into ""inept"" stock category. Now ABCDEFG is pumping SSYS"
"Ladies, gentlemen, and W - A winner has been declared this morning in the race toward a $17 price per share differential between DDD and SSYS. Many humbled prognosticators here wouldn't have thought this day would come."
"Arks top position in their PRNT: SLM Solutions (AM3D) is one of the best performer this year in 3D printing industry. Guys, soon we will do official dual listing very likely indicated by their newest job offer of a manager for maintaining compliance with US listing and SEC rules."
Being actively flushed like a TURRD! So sad.
Selling out of panic is the worst. Believe in what you have and don't get trapped by global market manipulation.
"Trilantic North America, a middle-market private equity firm, has completed the previously announced acquisition of the On-Demand Manufacturing business from 3D Systems for 80 million"
Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX) seems to be a bargain after this days market turmoil.
"Ouch, it's below 29. DDD does not disappoint when it comes to disappointing investors."
"SSYS last rundown from 28 to 18 it took 1.5 month (June to Aug), lets see this rundown from 27 to 17 how many days it will take."
Bollinger bottom band price 26.08 so DDD is moving up from here.
chart is ready for $34- unstoppable.
Today we will see huge pop from MA200; trade accordingly
DDD today bounced back from 50MA - hope you bought around 29.30 in the morning.
"W....30 more cents, and we have share price parity. What say you?"
I sense that DDD will have huge M&A announcement soon and this explains why active (speculative) institutions keep buying these days. Wait (hold) to see
"i dreamed that Cramer was screaming Sell, Sell, YES, Selllll _ssys"
The DDD SSYS horse race continues. And our resident horses #$%$ has called a winner. I say he has called it too soon?.
Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX) made 12 percent yesterday as I said yesterday: Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX) seems to be a bargain after this days market turmoil
"If 30 is the concrete nuclear steel wall, then we must be on the wrong side of it because we're not over 30."
Nasdaq and momentum stocks continue to go higher and higher: DDD will follow the momentum stocks and go much higher.
does it look like I'm going to be selling calls anytime soon.
"30 is the new 17; after 17, we had 41, now after 30, we will have ?"
"if that is true, DDD will be $100DDD's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $0.37 per share and revenue of $588.35 million. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +436.36% and +6.09%, respectively."
This stock has no strategic advantage over any of their competitors. Hit the sell button and thank me later.
"Stock shot up after earnings, then crashed back down after. Stock is shooting up after acquisition, what do you think happens after?"
13F filings show institutions are buying in August in the low volume sessions.. obviously retail missed the boat and now we see they post they sold or they shorted (with fantasy shares lol) in an attempt to catch the boat?
Get the shares as bashers are here for a reason- they want to buy and accumulate more shares. Why don't we see any bashers on the A3D board? because A3D is dead so no one wants to bash a dead stock.
"After long term trapped longs finally sold out, this stock is ready to go up to retest the historical high..."
"Price is now above MA10, ready to take 30 back."
"sell SSYS and buy DDD because now it is a perfect timing. In my analysis, SSYS will start a new round of huge drop after the 3rd quarter ER. Rising before the ER is a sure sign of a cliff diving after the ER."
"buy 29=30 when it reaches 100, 30 is the new 17!"
"W. For most of the past decade, SSYS garnered a premium over DDD in price per share. We had a short squeeze and briefly became a meme stock 6 months ago, and that changed back then. What makes you so sure that change is permanent?"

"HUGE NEWS!With this acquisition, 3D Systems intends to tap the growing opportunities in the smart manufacturing solution space. The company estimates that the spending on smart manufacturing is likely to reach $6.5 billion by 2025 from $1.5 billion today."
Should see movement soon!!
"Ddd will be an artificial intelligence (AI) 3d manufacturer after the Opton acquisition, the first 3d company in the entire 3d sector."
"You need to learn to read chart for yourself. I’ve lost big before reading pump and dump crowds before so I have few rules now. 1. Read chart and find the pattern. Week to month and years to max. 2. Look at their profit margin and what’s in their pipeline 3. Search insiders trading price to find a good buying point. They know better than any of us. When do they buy and what price do they sell at. 4. Check if institutions recently opened or closed positions 5. Check analyst recommendation is sell, hold, or buy. 7. Risk score8. Sector score"
Ok W. You have lost all credibility.

"Aurora labs 3D stock total market cap $21m, down 40% from 52wk high, traded at 13c. I won't touch it."
$DM 85% Undervalued while $DDD is 168.0% Overvalued. According to Simplywallst.
"ddd business strong rebound this year, it maybe just beginning, so ddd can skyrocket any time.,"
buy there is no difference between 29 and 30 or 40 when it reaches 100.
"Other than the acquisition, which wasn't even a big deal, nothing significant happened since last earnings. They beat estimates hard last time and everyone blindly bought in, now it's on a slow bleed back to pre-earning levels. So, under 25 today or tomorrow?"
"Half billion cash on the balance sheet and no debt, positive earnings in 3 consecutive quarters, and deep pullback from 52wk high $56, this stock is set to re-test $56 within 2 weeks."
I will keep on buying
"when shorts start attracting W, a yahoo message poster, you know shorts will soon lose everything."
"29=30, if you don’t understand this, find a cashier job from a grocery store."
Loop Capital just upped their price target by 9$ to $33 for DDD.
LOL W with the post of the year. EPS of .37 per share would give you a PE of 250!
PRLB makes much more money than DDD. W is slow.
DDD projects run rate revenues from the Oqton software to exceed $100 million by 2025.
"Ddd’s recent rally was supported by the earnings and the rally was destroyed by DM/Xone buyout news, now after the dust settles, DDD price will return to after earing high and the rest of the 3d stocks will stay low or even lower."
"I looked DDD history and found that many years ago it did a secondary ($65) while Goodman Goldman Sachs gave a buy rating with higher price target, BUT, ddd never passed $65 after the secondary offering in the past 8 years. It dropped to $5. Now SSYS had a secondary offering ($30?) this year and you know $30 would be the nuclear steel and concrete ceiling perhaps. IMO"
"I pointed out that DDD’s recent runup was interrupted by the DM/Xone buyout news. The reason is that DM and Xone had huge volumes on the buyout news and consumed 3d sector dynamic buying power which was critical to support DDD continuous rally. Unfortunately, unfortunately, Xone rained on DDD’s parade again, twice. DM announced this buyout news at the same time with a very bad quarterly ER so if there was no buyout news, DM price could drop 10-15% easily. A Xone share will be converted to $17 worth of DM shares and also $8.5 cash, so if DM continuously drop to $5, a Xone share will be 3 DM shares. The Xone buyout will cause a huge dilution to the DM shares. DDD up 20% after the huge earning beat was justified and the current downward pressure was caused by the turmoil by other 3d stocks so if we are still a 3d stock believer, DDD is the best 3d stock with proved positive earnings and huge potential."
"Hold long term. But, play intra-day put options. Buy every time W posts something bullish, and sell the puts 2 hours later."
Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX) made 3.6 percent yesterday. They received the R&D tax refund from the government. So I estimate they are funded till quarter 2 22 and maybe do not need a capital raise before.
this is due for a breakout post earnings. many positives going forward - ceo is providing clear focus in areas of large TAM; supply chain issues are leading to AM migration; profitable quarters lead to inclusion in indexes. lastly. chart shows a clear growth trend forward. ignore the short term noise.

I am happy to have experienced the 118% gain in q3 21 on my baby daughter’s Position of Metal 3d printer developer Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX). Do you know a better 3d printing stock last quarter?
@W Give me your argument for why DDD is superior to SSYS
"I see the possibility of an acquisition of SLM Solutions by 3D systems. SLM solutions is controlled by Singers Elliot Fund via large holdings and convertibles. ark invest has a stake in it too. DM was rumored by Bloomberg in February to buy them, now others could come.Their 12 laser beast metal printer is said to be well received by customers. It might complement DDDs lagging metal business."
And guys look at aurora labs 3D (A3D.AX ) that made 16 percent last Night in Australia . We are close to commercialization of a faster metal printer than currently available.
Switch toy 3d stocks to DDD. it is the perfect timing right now.
"W remaining silent. I will channel his spirit and will speak for him....""$50 today""......""watch more porn"". - That's all I can channel for now. It takes a lot of effort."
They had some interesting insights about DDD on (http://Pick-stocks.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Trading used to be such a frustrating experience for me. The losses mounted up until I discovered the winning service over at (http://Multistockalerts.com) check them out today.
"In Feb. DDD peaked at $56, SSYS was 57, Xone was 66 and Prlb was 286 and now we see where the others are. DDD is obviously the winner in the 3d sector. Chasing the winner and holding the winner are the basic rules in stock investment."
"By the end of the day DDD will still be higher than Sell-sell-yes-sell because people want to invest in profitable company which is DDD, now and and from now on."
"Even with all this positive news, the stock is falling. There's a reason most analyst PTs are under 30$."
Only DDD and PRLB have positive earnings so these two will go up and the rest of 3d stocks will stay low.. and DDD will catch up PRLB per share price.
"Bigger % gain for SSYS again. I'm telling ya, W. It's the Youporn/pornhub conundrum. In the end, I know you well enough to know you'd recommend both."
"Buy DDD- the only profitable 3d company this year, next year and next 50 years."
Take this rare opportunity to buy more DDD shares. This drop is because of general market pullback- it happens once every quarter.
DDD is now $10 higher than SSYS; will be at least $13 higher. Buy American company stock and hold
"Market indices down 1%+…. This marked down 3.3% on the open. W, how’s that wall at 30?"

"Jan was a long for a few years so I believe he was a trapped long, however, he became a short last week. I expect that Jan will again be a trapped short. From $50 to $5, if he held, he only saw his account balance dropping from $5000 to $500 but nothing actual happened as long as he held, the shares but if he shorted the shares, he will be forced to close the short position on margin calls."
Hope the shorts crumble into nothing. Send this stock to $100 already!
"Up, Up and AWAY !!Up, Up and AWAY !!!..........such a beautiful sight for ALL 3D Systems long shareholders - CONGRATS!!"
buy shares under 30 when it goes below 30 temporarily.
@W Band over
They had some interesting insights about DDD on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"owned 800 shares at $33. Sold 600 shares yesterday and today, of course, today's sold shares made a big profit. Yesterday was not because I wanted to lessen the load prior to the earnings call. Still every bit is a profit taking. I am still holding 200 shares. And Nice again!"

"3 D printing continues to be under appreciated and under utilized. It's possibilities have only begun to be recognized. Eventually, it will be relied upon in many more industries and daily applications."
"I hope you all did the opposite of what W advised. Doing so, is sound investment advice. He advised selling SSYS and buying more DDD. The opposite was a homerun over short term. It's looking like a long term winning strategy as well. He should spend his time watching dirty videos, and not giving free advice."

Market pullback is over; it’s time to buy ddd shares and enjoy huge October gain.
"Great, exactly when I closed out my short position the price has been skyrocketing…."
I heard about DDD the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
There is no positive news. It's all fluff to try to raise the stock price. Signing large contracts is news.
"ARKQ yesterday bought almost 100,000 more shares of DDD."

"30 milestone, feel great"
"Buy DDD, PRLB, 3d stocks with positive earnings and sell SSYS, XONE, and other 3d stocks with negative earnings."
New acquisition announced. Could this be the catalyst like the Collplant breast augmentation announcement that sends DDD to $40 tomorrow?
DDD will be at least $13 higher than SSYS after the dust settles....

@W. It's on sale now for just 29.99. Buy as much as you can
Interesting intraday chart. Do you see what I see?
DDD is profitable through selling off parts of the company. Will not be profitable in 2022. .
I heard about DDD the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Notice how this has no buy ratings? Notice how analyst PTs are low?No insiders are buying, and neither are institutions. Only way from here is down."
"W, Do not worry. Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX ) Made 10 percent today!"
Hoping for a big gain here so that W can get the help he needs. Pray for him.
"W - sure glad I picked up some SSYS and lightened up on DDD. Thank you for speaking up and calling my attention to the opportunity. Please let me know what other stocks you don't like. I need to add them to my ""conviction buy"" list."

"If you are more interested in bio printing, take a look at Swedish BICO (BICO.ST). I am neither king nor short at the moment. I wait for new announcements."
Congrats to W for outstandingly bullish posts at the high today. I had no doubt the high was in when he began gleefully posting
"W. You should be ashamed of yourself. We all, myself included, regard you as the most intelligent person on the Board; I think it's obvious. We rely heavily on your advice. You steered everyone wrong though. I bet you owned SSYS all along, and were manipulating us. Shame on you."
"Gap gets bigger and bigger.@W What do you say, can we see a buck?"
"$SSYS I'm guessing that today's sharp stock rise (on a day when $DDD is down), has to do with the $DM purchase of $XONE . Earlier this year when Stratasys announced they were dropping their metal printer to focus on polymers, I was disappointed, as they had spent millions on development, only to jettison it before it was even released. I thought it might in reality be because $DM told them they didn't want the competition. $DM of course has been sharing the $SSYS reseller network for some years: Stratasys was concerned they might start losing some of their exclusive network because they had no metal printer for the network to offer to complement their polymer printers. Now I wonder if this new $DM deal hasn't been known by $SSYS for some time, and THAT'S why they dropped their metal printer. We now have a powerful, broad spectrum metal company linked to an equally powrful, broad spectrum polymer company (of course Stratasys was an early investor in DM also). An eventual formal combining of the two companies? I have no idea of the underlying practicality/desirability of that, but at least their present partnership is very promising. They should be making some noise."
DDD target lifted to $45 with aggressive buy rating!
"A quarter....25 cents....is current premium over SSYS in price per share. Not exactly what our resident ""genius"" predicted, is it?"
W - can you re-post your belief in expected price differential between DDD and SSYS. Thanks
Next earnings will be $45 not $40 - IMO
"DDD to host a conference call and webcast September 9, 2021, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. Outlook is great, buy and hold"
Premarket doesn’t mean anything
I feel this is a great buy on the pullback. I bought this morning. They have shown multiple quarters of earnings and revenue beats showing that the future is looking bright for them.
28=29. 40=11. 29=30. 6=11. 22=94. Math according to W.
Post the same thing every 3 days! Buy American! Close your eyes. Bollinger bands post coming tomorrow!!

"30 is the new 17, remember my famous quote. LOL, I revise it to 31 is the new 17"
sell ssys and buy DDD. This is the setup for switching SSYS to DDD before SSYS drops below 20 and then 15. DDD will be back above 30 soon.
buy with last penny we have and hold; it will go up significantly
"DDD price will go up while the rest of the 3d stocks will stay low. We may see Xone under 20 before the merger. Without the buyout news, Xone would have dropped to $15 on the earnings’ day (afterhours), 10% drop from previous $17 close"
I spoke to W. We use a form of telepathy for that. He says the nuclear and steel wall is now at $17
Is there a reason they have beaten this stock down over 30? That's usually reserved for misses. Anyone who bought the great last quarterly results got slaughtered.
Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX ) joint venture AdditiveNow has announced the signing of a 2 year contract with Alcoa for the provision of 3D printed parts and any associated design and engineering. According to a post of Aurora CEO on LinkedIn they presumably use their metal printer for the contract. A further step towards commercialization and the stock price rose 18 percent. Why not invest in such public start up? Higher risk but possibly higher return!
Q2 Institutional ownership 13F filingsTotal inflows $315mTotal outflows $101mNet inflows $214mHighest quarterly inflows in recent years.
Looks like @W is right. 30 is concrete nuclear wall bit from the bottom
"W is an actual crystal ball. He posts something exuberant at the intra-day high almost every day. It's usually a 2 hour phenomenon. Buy puts when he posts and sell them 2 hours later. That ""2 hours later"" would be now. We're seeing the lows now based on W's history. Put this in a spreadsheet and see for yourself."
"In the beginning of Covid in March 2020, Nasdaq dropped to 7000 and now it is 15000. Now the world is well prepared for the financial market Covid2.0 or Covid3.0 so markets will continue to go up. We do need nuclear steel and concrete wall to contain the COVIDs."

Chart showing Triangle Breakout. Will be up significantly early next week.
"No worry about any severe drop due to market pullback. In the beginning of the pandemic, Nasdaq dropped to 7000, and now it is 15000 year and half later. Soon DDD will be back and above $30 without doubt."

"30 is the new 17, no difference between 29 and 30 when it reaches 100"
Dude-E. Wish I kept SSYS longer. Sooner gone with my gut in contrarian trade to W advice.
"It is a bet on Aurora`s new metal printing technology. It can go bankrupt or to the moon. I like this risk-reward ratio very much. So, I gave my newborn daughter all of my Aurora Labs 3D stocks (300000) as a first stock present."
W pumped DDD at 56!
"a3d down from 16.5c to 12.5c, down 24% last session. Jan is counting bucks."
buy with no worries if we see SSYS is still up $1. DDD will have much better performance.
Take away the hype and this stock is worth $15 a share at most.
I will unload all my 2500 shares near $40 this time guys which I did not do last 2 times
"Small detail, big indication: Q2 revenue was actually higher than it was two years ago before the pandemic. DDD is in the stock winner group in the pandemic environment like Amazon, and some vaccine companies."
DDD $9 higher than SSYS; soon will be at least $13 higher
"$33.73, Bollinger top band price, price target for this week.."
ARK last bought SSYS 666 shares and you all got excited?
30 is the new 17
what do yall think about $nndm? possible acquisition target?
I'm ashamed of W!
16% short of the float and the price is well above the average shorted price. Time is on bull’s side because DDD is moving in the right direction. The good time that most of the stocks in our account are moving higher is probably over. Any loss from DDD short positions will not be compensated by the gain of other stocks from now on. Another huge surge of DDD price will cause accelerated short squeeze and that is the writing on the wall.
W23 hours agoBollinger bottom band price 26.08 so DDD is moving up from here.
Looks like investors realize that DDD has no technological or commercial advantage over SSYS.I guess market cap of both companies will align somewhere at 2.5-3 B.
"All - I spoke to my friend W. He and I agree that this goes higher. But, we differ on target prices. I am thinking we stagnate in the mid-30s. He says $69.69. It's a number he seems to love."
The whole market is #$%$ right now. whatever you buy goes down. so don't blame DDD right now. just be patient as the earning season should bring a nice rebound for many stocks
"Today, price is above Ichimoku cloud, first time in a about a month."
"Jan, come out post A3D down 12% yesterday from 17c to 15c... LOL"
Buying 2023 Leaps on this could generate substantial wealth. As soon as I hear whispers of interest rates coming back... I'm going liquid.. I'm going to wait for the bottom and go long with leaps on 4 stocks. GLAL
