"This company - 3D Systems, Inc - is on the cusp of true financial greatness, imho. Congrats to all DDD stakeholders."
"On Monday, ARK purchased over half a million shares of DDD... pretty promising (though Cathie has been on a real losing streak in timing, so it may not be such good news)."
"Finally, all acquisitions are done. After earning, we will fly and stay up... Approximately, we will have 15% more stocks issued for the acquisitions since this summer."
One year later people will beg to buy at $50.00.

"just got filled for 2,400 more @ $27 + .........................THANK YOU VERY MUCH, whoever U may be."
DDD Acquires human organ manufacturer using bioprinting company Volumetric Biotechnologies for cash and stock up to $400M (3D Systems Corporation)
"From Forbes article last february: “While the technology itself is amazing in its potential benefits to humanity, the business model for 3D Systems is also exciting, and one that is not new to the company,” Graves said. “For years we have developed and produced advanced medical products for the human body using additive manufacturing in a highly disciplined, process-controlled and FDA-regulated environment. With this foundation, if you look at the progress we have now made in all of the essential hardware, software and materials elements of bioprinting, we have the opportunity as a company to address a variety of applications within the human body. That’s why we’re increasing our funding and investment and expanding our partnerships to make these applications a reality. When you see this tremendous scaffold printed, and then you see blood flowing through it that could sustain human life, it’s remarkable, even for someone from an R&D background like me. I am continually amazed at the potential this technology now offers.”Graves sees the organs and tissues work as a natural extension of what’s already a strong business for 3D Systems. “In terms of the impact on our company, our healthcare business is growing nicely, now approaching half of the company revenue,” he said. “We believe that regenerative medicine will add to this growth, becoming a significant business in its own right in several years. This technology offers tremendous benefits for human life, whether helping people whose lungs or kidneys are failing, or offering remedies for someone who’s experienced facial or other traumas in their body. It’s sad when you think of the tremendous shortage of replacement organs today and that the primary supply originates from the loss of another person’s life. The only way to address these needs is through an alternative source of supply, and hopefully one that offers greater compatibility with the recipient of the new organ or tissue implant. With the progress we are now making, we believe that regenerative medicine, and the underlying bioprinting technology we have now demonstrated, can ultimately be an answer to this problem.”"
"$26.62 ish in October 2021 - $40 to $50 ish in Nov / Dec 2021 ................NO PROBLEM, mon."
"DDD (28.40) is approaching the downtrend line going back to the Feb. high. A break of this, and the first target will be a test of 40ish area."
W is playing with his Bollinger bands.
"If you want to ride the 3d printing wave overnight, take a look at Australia's two promising 3d metal printer firms Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX) and AML3D (AL3.AX). My family trust has invested there. Lool at my track record in DDD on this board!"
You folks have no clue. 3d printing of human organs for implant are 10 years away if they even get FDA approval. What earnings growth are you talking about? Seems like they are abandoning their core business and betting it all on a long shot.
"Acquisition conference highlights: -Working on lungs plus two more undisclosed organs. -New location in texas dedicated to bioprinting research.-Minimal expectations for near-term results, overall long-term timeline. -Low competition area according to DDD."
Decided to dip my toe back into DDD today. Half now ...half later if it drops prior to earnings release.
"What was it , like a 35% gain on the last earnings? And then it got beaten down since about 30%. Textbook pump and dumper. Obviously a decent company but a Wall Street plaything with little respect when it comes to the equity."
We just became a biotechnology company. The potential here is in the tens of billions.. buy now and sell the end of 2022 for $100
