"Ladies, gentlemen, and W - A winner has been declared this morning in the race toward a $17 price per share differential between DDD and SSYS. Many humbled prognosticators here wouldn't have thought this day would come."
Trading used to be such a frustrating experience for me. The losses mounted up until I discovered the winning service over at (http://Multistockalerts.com) check them out today.
Loop Capital just upped their price target by 9$ to $33 for DDD.
what do yall think about $nndm? possible acquisition target?
"Today, price is above Ichimoku cloud, first time in a about a month."
I spoke to W. We use a form of telepathy for that. He says the nuclear and steel wall is now at $17
"Gap gets bigger and bigger.@W What do you say, can we see a buck?"
Bollinger top band price $33.47
Looks like @W is right. 30 is concrete nuclear wall bit from the bottom
W is lonely.
28=29. 40=11. 29=30. 6=11. 22=94. Math according to W.
Made good gain from Uranium stocks. predicted Uranium stocks would go up.
"By the end of the day DDD will still be higher than Sell-sell-yes-sell because people want to invest in profitable company which is DDD, now and and from now on."
"Let's see how it ot goes on EC tomorrow morning,, but this CEO definitely knows how to run the show."
Get the shares as bashers are here for a reason- they want to buy and accumulate more shares. Why don't we see any bashers on the A3D board? because A3D is dead so no one wants to bash a dead stock.
"Ssys run-up will be over by the end of the day, it’s a perfect timing to switch to DDD- the only profitable 3d printing stock"
buy with no worries if we see SSYS is still up $1. DDD will have much better performance.
"Why is DM valued much higher (13x Revenue) over DDD, SSYS, PRLB of around 3x Revenue..???Thanks in advance"
Looks like investors realize that DDD has no technological or commercial advantage over SSYS.I guess market cap of both companies will align somewhere at 2.5-3 B.
"i dreamed that Cramer was screaming Sell, Sell, YES, Selllll _ssys"
13F filings show institutions are buying in August in the low volume sessions.. obviously retail missed the boat and now we see they post they sold or they shorted (with fantasy shares lol) in an attempt to catch the boat?
"Bollinger top band price $34.23, target for next a couple of days.."
"Stock shot up after earnings, then crashed back down after. Stock is shooting up after acquisition, what do you think happens after?"
"DDD price will go up while the rest of the 3d stocks will stay low. We may see Xone under 20 before the merger. Without the buyout news, Xone would have dropped to $15 on the earnings’ day (afterhours), 10% drop from previous $17 close"
@W. It's on sale now for just 29.99. Buy as much as you can
Buying 2023 Leaps on this could generate substantial wealth. As soon as I hear whispers of interest rates coming back... I'm going liquid.. I'm going to wait for the bottom and go long with leaps on 4 stocks. GLAL
"no doubt, this is set to re-test 52wk high short term and after that, to run up to the all time high."
"if that is true, DDD will be $100DDD's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $0.37 per share and revenue of $588.35 million. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +436.36% and +6.09%, respectively."
"Guys SLM solution is recruiting to be listed in the US, looking at comparable US listed 3D company ( ex. Velo3d SPAC >1B) it should boost this German company !"
"On the DDD board, please post things relevant to DDD and the 3D printing world. Uranium stocks should be discussed elsewhere."
"a3d down from 16.5c to 12.5c, down 24% last session. Jan is counting bucks."
Hope the shorts crumble into nothing. Send this stock to $100 already!
"DM sales 40M, market cap 2B, DDD sales 500M, market cap 3.7B at the moment. DM has no sign to turn to profitable anytime soon; DDD is profitable for 3 consecutive quarters. If DM price was $5, DDD price should be $100"
"Arks top position in their PRNT: SLM Solutions (AM3D) is one of the best performer this year in 3D printing industry. Guys, soon we will do official dual listing very likely indicated by their newest job offer of a manager for maintaining compliance with US listing and SEC rules."
W yesterday Replied to a reaction3D Systems Corporation@Greg 30 is now the reinforced nuclear steel and concrete double layer wall. Buy and hold.
does it look like I'm going to be selling calls anytime soon.
DDD target lifted to $45 with aggressive buy rating!
"we should be very satisfied with DDD's performance today, while most of the other 3d stocks are red. DDD is now a true leader in the 3d sector."
"ABCDEFG do you plan to send this as X-mas gifts to your wife, daughter? ABCDEFG 2 days ago Replied to a reaction$DDD conversationW says that he will be able to scan a certain, um, body part, and make a perfect replica to give to his friends to, um, use."
this stock needs some momentum. analysts and markets tend to underestimate every time and kept price low. Buyer exhausted.
"Endless disappointment. Always ""just another quarter"" or ""this time next year"". Story is always the same as the stock price deteriorates."
@W Give me your argument for why DDD is superior to SSYS
Switch toy 3d stocks to DDD. it is the perfect timing right now.
"Ddd’s recent rally was supported by the earnings and the rally was destroyed by DM/Xone buyout news, now after the dust settles, DDD price will return to after earing high and the rest of the 3d stocks will stay low or even lower."
"Ddd and Prlb 1:1 merger will be great. The joint company will become Apple, Google, or Amazon in the 3d sector."
Market pullback is over; it’s time to buy ddd shares and enjoy huge October gain.
"Buy DDD, PRLB, 3d stocks with positive earnings and sell SSYS, XONE, and other 3d stocks with negative earnings."
"In the beginning of Covid in March 2020, Nasdaq dropped to 7000 and now it is 15000. Now the world is well prepared for the financial market Covid2.0 or Covid3.0 so markets will continue to go up. We do need nuclear steel and concrete wall to contain the COVIDs."
"Small detail, big indication: Q2 revenue was actually higher than it was two years ago before the pandemic. DDD is in the stock winner group in the pandemic environment like Amazon, and some vaccine companies."
W - it’s happening again
PRLB makes much more money than DDD. W is slow.
"Lets ignore ABCDEFG, he is just a paid tool- own nothing, only selling his useless time to get pennies, dimes per post as a paid tool.Check what he said about TSLA 5 years ago. ""This stock in the next 6-10 months has 50-60% downside risk - worse if the market tanks in an across the board selloff.""he is doing the same bashing here and DDD will have TSLA style price movement as we all believe.ABCDEFG5 years ago$TSLA conversationPeople are really buying this thing here? I believe this company will be around for a long time - Elon is a visionary. However, he is also quite nuts, and his ambitions have right now gone beyond the company's near term financial means. Within a year, we will see some restructuring and downsizing of expectations. October is a rocky month. We will see huge swings. This stock in the next 6-10 months has 50-60% downside risk - worse if the market tanks in an across the board selloff."
"DM sales 40M, market cap 2BVjet sales 22M, market cap 40MDM is not that different or special. this is the reason smart traders bought Vjet low today and now its green."
Should see movement soon!!
"30 is the new 17, buy!"
"I hope you all did the opposite of what W advised. Doing so, is sound investment advice. He advised selling SSYS and buying more DDD. The opposite was a homerun over short term. It's looking like a long term winning strategy as well. He should spend his time watching dirty videos, and not giving free advice."
Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX) made 12 percent yesterday as I said yesterday: Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX) seems to be a bargain after this days market turmoil
There is no positive news. It's all fluff to try to raise the stock price. Signing large contracts is news.
"owned 800 shares at $33. Sold 600 shares yesterday and today, of course, today's sold shares made a big profit. Yesterday was not because I wanted to lessen the load prior to the earnings call. Still every bit is a profit taking. I am still holding 200 shares. And Nice again!"
"After long term trapped longs finally sold out, this stock is ready to go up to retest the historical high..."
Whose crying now?
Take away the hype and this stock is worth $15 a share at most.
Congrats to W for outstandingly bullish posts at the high today. I had no doubt the high was in when he began gleefully posting
To the newbies to the board. You’re gonna find this place very informative. Other boards are entertaining. We’re all business here though.
"when Jan was on Mohamad's side yesterday, we know retail long who wanted to sell had all sold."
1.54 points on 7000 shares so far are not bad….. after the great short from 39.1 to 27.1 with 9000 shares… made my month…
"Ploy to bring in stock, todays ""Red day"" of trading on 1/4 normal volume, not many selling, stay strong and long.."

"$SSYS I'm guessing that today's sharp stock rise (on a day when $DDD is down), has to do with the $DM purchase of $XONE . Earlier this year when Stratasys announced they were dropping their metal printer to focus on polymers, I was disappointed, as they had spent millions on development, only to jettison it before it was even released. I thought it might in reality be because $DM told them they didn't want the competition. $DM of course has been sharing the $SSYS reseller network for some years: Stratasys was concerned they might start losing some of their exclusive network because they had no metal printer for the network to offer to complement their polymer printers. Now I wonder if this new $DM deal hasn't been known by $SSYS for some time, and THAT'S why they dropped their metal printer. We now have a powerful, broad spectrum metal company linked to an equally powrful, broad spectrum polymer company (of course Stratasys was an early investor in DM also). An eventual formal combining of the two companies? I have no idea of the underlying practicality/desirability of that, but at least their present partnership is very promising. They should be making some noise."
"Australian 3d metal printer developer Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX ) has made approx. 135 percent since July 23, 2021. you should not solely always look at US stocks. You might miss some opportunities then."
"Half billion cash on the balance sheet and no debt, positive earnings in 3 consecutive quarters, and deep pullback from 52wk high $56, this stock is set to re-test $56 within 2 weeks."
"Of all the stock advice services I have used, I find (http://Fairstox.com) to be one of the absolute best! Their advice is well researched, helpful, and up to date. I don’t know how I ever went about day trading without reading their newsletter first!"
@W Band over
"$33.73, Bollinger top band price, price target for this week.."
buy shares under 30 when it goes below 30 temporarily.
DDD $9 higher than SSYS; soon will be at least $13 higher
"ddd business strong rebound this year, it maybe just beginning, so ddd can skyrocket any time.,"
30 is the new 17
I will unload all my 2500 shares near $40 this time guys which I did not do last 2 times
"3 D printing continues to be under appreciated and under utilized. It's possibilities have only begun to be recognized. Eventually, it will be relied upon in many more industries and daily applications."
DM bought Xone so it will carry a heavy bag going down the valley. I am not surprised to see DDD buy out DM when it is under $5 and DDD is above $100. It will happen sooner than we think

The stock pressure down is the hedge funds and institutions trying to get the stock as close to pre earnings numbers as possible as most of the short sellers got screwed and get their options better positioned. sadly not enough interest or buyer's to support higher price
"SSYS last rundown from 28 to 18 it took 1.5 month (June to Aug), lets see this rundown from 27 to 17 how many days it will take."
Ok W. You have lost all credibility.
"A quarter....25 cents....is current premium over SSYS in price per share. Not exactly what our resident ""genius"" predicted, is it?"
"Up, Up and AWAY !!Up, Up and AWAY !!!..........such a beautiful sight for ALL 3D Systems long shareholders - CONGRATS!!"
"Market indices down 1%+…. This marked down 3.3% on the open. W, how’s that wall at 30?"
Sell and close puts - 2 hours have passed since W’s most recent exuberant post.
Chart showing Triangle Breakout. Will be up significantly early next week.
"31 is the new 17, buy and hold, we will see 34 in a week."
"Guys, I told you so: SLM Solutions 13 percent up at the moment in Germany and Aurora Labs 10 percent up in Australia last night."
"I looked DDD history and found that many years ago it did a secondary ($65) while Goodman Goldman Sachs gave a buy rating with higher price target, BUT, ddd never passed $65 after the secondary offering in the past 8 years. It dropped to $5. Now SSYS had a secondary offering ($30?) this year and you know $30 would be the nuclear steel and concrete ceiling perhaps. IMO"
Ark bought another $3.5M today. They are in deep!
"I see the possibility of an acquisition of SLM Solutions by 3D systems. SLM solutions is controlled by Singers Elliot Fund via large holdings and convertibles. ark invest has a stake in it too. DM was rumored by Bloomberg in February to buy them, now others could come.Their 12 laser beast metal printer is said to be well received by customers. It might complement DDDs lagging metal business."
"Jan, come out post A3D down 12% yesterday from 17c to 15c... LOL"
Do we have a chance back to 40?
LOL oversold. This is trading at 2x the value of it's competitors with no completive advantage at all.
"You would be foolish not to be involved with this company or short it..3D printing is the wave of the future, the Auto, Aerospace, medical applications are endless.New synthetics that outlast plastic and metal are being upgraded all the time..No doubt over $100 by 2023"
DDD will have $500M cash on the balance sheet in Aug. after the sale transaction is complete.
"30 is the new 17; after 17, we had 41, now after 30, we will have ?"
@W Can you enlight us and provide a new wall?
"Industry leader so if you're in for the long haul (5 years +), you have a winner. For those with shorter-term horizons, the weekly chart remains on a sell signal. Resistance at 30. First support around 23, second support in the 17's."
They had some interesting insights about DDD on (http://Pick-stocks.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
The whole market is #$%$ right now. whatever you buy goes down. so don't blame DDD right now. just be patient as the earning season should bring a nice rebound for many stocks
Premarket doesn’t mean anything
Being actively flushed like a TURRD! So sad.
"DDD price is SSYS's nuclear steel concrete ceiling. Sell and buy, trade accordingly."
"Ouch, it's below 29. DDD does not disappoint when it comes to disappointing investors."
W trying to steer the subject to Jan. He pumped this at 56!
DDD today bounced back from 50MA - hope you bought around 29.30 in the morning.
"MA50 29.11, nuclear steel concrete wall."
"$DDD 3D Systems CEO Graves Buys Over $120,000 of Shares"
"No worry about any severe drop due to market pullback. In the beginning of the pandemic, Nasdaq dropped to 7000, and now it is 15000 year and half later. Soon DDD will be back and above $30 without doubt."
buy with last penny we have and hold; it will go up significantly
sell ssys and buy DDD. This is the setup for switching SSYS to DDD before SSYS drops below 20 and then 15. DDD will be back above 30 soon.
"They just got a big upgrade on Power Lunch. It was said what a great company this is , and mentioned their work in the medical world. Hold tight !"
"30 is the new 17, no difference between 29 and 30 when it reaches 100"
Hoping for a big gain here so that W can get the help he needs. Pray for him.
W3 days ago$DDD conversationOnly DDD and PRLB have positive earnings so these two will go up and the rest of 3d stocks will stay low.. and DDD will catch up PRLB per share price.
Nasdaq and momentum stocks continue to go higher and higher: DDD will follow the momentum stocks and go much higher.
DDD will be at least $13 higher than SSYS after the dust settles....
"ARKQ yesterday bought almost 100,000 more shares of DDD."
I am happy to have experienced the 118% gain in q3 21 on my baby daughter’s Position of Metal 3d printer developer Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX). Do you know a better 3d printing stock last quarter?
"W. You should be ashamed of yourself. We all, myself included, regard you as the most intelligent person on the Board; I think it's obvious. We rely heavily on your advice. You steered everyone wrong though. I bet you owned SSYS all along, and were manipulating us. Shame on you."
"With $500m cash on the balance sheet, DDD could easily buy $50,100m attractive profitable business multiple times. Each PR will drive the price up 10-30%."
Today we will see huge pop from MA200; trade accordingly
I feel this is a great buy on the pullback. I bought this morning. They have shown multiple quarters of earnings and revenue beats showing that the future is looking bright for them.
Only DDD and PRLB have positive earnings so these two will go up and the rest of 3d stocks will stay low.. and DDD will catch up PRLB per share price.
30 is the new 17!
$DM 85% Undervalued while $DDD is 168.0% Overvalued. According to Simplywallst.
"MA50 $30.67, after secure this price, we see a huge price increase"
I don’t know what I would do without my daily emails from (http://trademarketview.tech)! They help me make the most of my trades and never let me down! Don’t know how I ever traded without them!
Buy American company stocks and hold – DDD
"Even with all this positive news, the stock is falling. There's a reason most analyst PTs are under 30$."
"So when DDD had a huge $56 rally in Feb and Xone stormed on DDD’s parade with its $50 secondary offering. Half year later, Xone major shareholders cash in $8/share? Buy DDD shares because it is a company with integrity."
They had some interesting insights about DDD on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
I heard about DDD the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Posted this morning to buy PRLB. Also 30 is the reinforced nuclear steel and concrete double layer wall - solid support. buy and hold
Anonymous is sad
What luck I bought before the reports I earned nicely today advancing towards Gate 60 tomorrow and so on up to 100
chart is ready for $34- unstoppable.
Today SSYS reported a quarterly loss of $0.02 per share and is up 14% so what will happen when DDD reports a positive earning on Aug.9?
W23 hours agoBollinger bottom band price 26.08 so DDD is moving up from here.
I will keep on buying
"W - sure glad I picked up some SSYS and lightened up on DDD. Thank you for speaking up and calling my attention to the opportunity. Please let me know what other stocks you don't like. I need to add them to my ""conviction buy"" list."
Q2 Institutional ownership 13F filingsTotal inflows $315mTotal outflows $101mNet inflows $214mHighest quarterly inflows in recent years.
Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX) made 3.6 percent yesterday. They received the R&D tax refund from the government. So I estimate they are funded till quarter 2 22 and maybe do not need a capital raise before.
The DDD SSYS horse race continues. And our resident horses #$%$ has called a winner. I say he has called it too soon?.
I heard about DDD the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
DDD projects run rate revenues from the Oqton software to exceed $100 million by 2025.
"Aurora labs 3D stock total market cap $21m, down 40% from 52wk high, traded at 13c. I won't touch it."
a glorious journey has just begun - DDD to 40 while other Sell-sell-yes-sell stocks to 52 wk low.
Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX) made 10 percent yesterday. When will you take a look at them?
I must to admit. @W was right when he said that 38 is concrete nuclear wall. The only thing he forgot to mention that it's from bottom.
W yesterdaychart is ready for $34- unstoppable.
"W....30 more cents, and we have share price parity. What say you?"
Next support level - 0.
"Jan was a long for a few years so I believe he was a trapped long, however, he became a short last week. I expect that Jan will again be a trapped short. From $50 to $5, if he held, he only saw his account balance dropping from $5000 to $500 but nothing actual happened as long as he held, the shares but if he shorted the shares, he will be forced to close the short position on margin calls."
Bollinger bottom band price 26.08 so DDD is moving up from here.
"Great, exactly when I closed out my short position the price has been skyrocketing…."
this is due for a breakout post earnings. many positives going forward - ceo is providing clear focus in areas of large TAM; supply chain issues are leading to AM migration; profitable quarters lead to inclusion in indexes. lastly. chart shows a clear growth trend forward. ignore the short term noise.
"W is an actual crystal ball. He posts something exuberant at the intra-day high almost every day. It's usually a 2 hour phenomenon. Buy puts when he posts and sell them 2 hours later. That ""2 hours later"" would be now. We're seeing the lows now based on W's history. Put this in a spreadsheet and see for yourself."
"Buy DDD- the only profitable 3d company this year, next year and next 50 years."
"Bigger % gain for SSYS again. I'm telling ya, W. It's the Youporn/pornhub conundrum. In the end, I know you well enough to know you'd recommend both."
"this will become true...W 7 days ago Replied to a reaction$DDD conversationNNDM under $5 some time this year.PRLB 85, DDD 50, SSYS 26, XONE 25, DM 8 prices in a month or two."
Dude-E. Wish I kept SSYS longer. Sooner gone with my gut in contrarian trade to W advice.
I'm ashamed of W!
"W. For most of the past decade, SSYS garnered a premium over DDD in price per share. We had a short squeeze and briefly became a meme stock 6 months ago, and that changed back then. What makes you so sure that change is permanent?"
New acquisition announced. Could this be the catalyst like the Collplant breast augmentation announcement that sends DDD to $40 tomorrow?
"The market was waiting the confirmation that DDD had real growth and positive earnings consecutively and yesterday, the company submitted a spectacular report and a half billion dollar cash in the bank. With this confirmation, there is no such thing that the stock goes up $2 or so continuously for weeks to reach new high. Super computers from the institutions are now calculating the company’s market value comparing to the peers and if the calculated market value is $60, then tomorrow, the price will be $60, no hesitation, It is market value."
Lol W. DDD market cap is 2x PRLB. The brain surgeon wants a 1-1 merger. He must not understand share price is not the market cap.
Take this rare opportunity to buy more DDD shares. This drop is because of general market pullback- it happens once every quarter.
Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX) seems to be a bargain after this days market turmoil.
Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX ) joint venture AdditiveNow has announced the signing of a 2 year contract with Alcoa for the provision of 3D printed parts and any associated design and engineering. According to a post of Aurora CEO on LinkedIn they presumably use their metal printer for the contract. A further step towards commercialization and the stock price rose 18 percent. Why not invest in such public start up? Higher risk but possibly higher return!
W pumped DDD at 56!
Post the same thing every 3 days! Buy American! Close your eyes. Bollinger bands post coming tomorrow!!
"Sorry, guys, I was out shorting Tesla and others. I have to admit that I have been shorting DDD after earnings. It is overvalued. I am sorry for that, I like DDD but this price is too high at the moment..."
"You need to learn to read chart for yourself. I’ve lost big before reading pump and dump crowds before so I have few rules now. 1. Read chart and find the pattern. Week to month and years to max. 2. Look at their profit margin and what’s in their pipeline 3. Search insiders trading price to find a good buying point. They know better than any of us. When do they buy and what price do they sell at. 4. Check if institutions recently opened or closed positions 5. Check analyst recommendation is sell, hold, or buy. 7. Risk score8. Sector score"
DDD is now $10 higher than SSYS; will be at least $13 higher. Buy American company stock and hold
buy there is no difference between 29 and 30 or 40 when it reaches 100.
"Notice how this has no buy ratings? Notice how analyst PTs are low?No insiders are buying, and neither are institutions. Only way from here is down."
Wow….the analysts are sure eating crow on this stock today.
I sense that DDD will have huge M&A announcement soon and this explains why active (speculative) institutions keep buying these days. Wait (hold) to see
"If you are more interested in bio printing, take a look at Swedish BICO (BICO.ST). I am neither king nor short at the moment. I wait for new announcements."
"This is just a good start, analyst upgrades will follow. they don't need analyst upgrades yet but sure there will be a few upgrades when it peaks."
Interesting intraday chart. Do you see what I see?
DDD is profitable through selling off parts of the company. Will not be profitable in 2022. .
DDD is the future and ceo is very confident. This can hit 100 faster then you think. SOFI. XPDI. FVRR. SI. ZIM future stock.
This stock has no strategic advantage over any of their competitors. Hit the sell button and thank me later.
"DDD to host a conference call and webcast September 9, 2021, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. Outlook is great, buy and hold"
"30 is the new 17, remember my famous quote. LOL, I revise it to 31 is the new 17"
And guys look at aurora labs 3D (A3D.AX ) that made 16 percent last Night in Australia . We are close to commercialization of a faster metal printer than currently available.
"New PR, DDD will have $2/share earning by 2022, imoROCK HILL, S.C., Sept. 02, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) today announced two additions to its industry-leading materials portfolio – Certified Scalmalloy (A) and Certified M789 (A) - to facilitate demanding industrial high-strength, corrosion-resistant parts for additive applications in markets such as aerospace, motorsports & automotive, semiconductor, energy, and mold making."
"Trilantic North America, a middle-market private equity firm, has completed the previously announced acquisition of the On-Demand Manufacturing business from 3D Systems for 80 million"
"29=30, if you don’t understand this, find a cashier job from a grocery store."
"buy 29=30 when it reaches 100, 30 is the new 17!"
ARK last bought SSYS 666 shares and you all got excited?
"any stock the inept ""man"" ABCDEFG pumped falls into ""inept"" stock category. Now ABCDEFG is pumping SSYS"
Selling out of panic is the worst. Believe in what you have and don't get trapped by global market manipulation.
"3D Systems CEO buys 4,260 shares of common stock 17:25 DDD In a regulatory filing, 3D Systems disclosed that its CEO Jeffrey Graves bought 4,260 share of common stock on August 16th in a total transaction size of about $125K."
"I pointed out that DDD’s recent runup was interrupted by the DM/Xone buyout news. The reason is that DM and Xone had huge volumes on the buyout news and consumed 3d sector dynamic buying power which was critical to support DDD continuous rally. Unfortunately, unfortunately, Xone rained on DDD’s parade again, twice. DM announced this buyout news at the same time with a very bad quarterly ER so if there was no buyout news, DM price could drop 10-15% easily. A Xone share will be converted to $17 worth of DM shares and also $8.5 cash, so if DM continuously drop to $5, a Xone share will be 3 DM shares. The Xone buyout will cause a huge dilution to the DM shares. DDD up 20% after the huge earning beat was justified and the current downward pressure was caused by the turmoil by other 3d stocks so if we are still a 3d stock believer, DDD is the best 3d stock with proved positive earnings and huge potential."
Give me your prediction about the future of this company. How will it change things of the future?
16% short of the float and the price is well above the average shorted price. Time is on bull’s side because DDD is moving in the right direction. The good time that most of the stocks in our account are moving higher is probably over. Any loss from DDD short positions will not be compensated by the gain of other stocks from now on. Another huge surge of DDD price will cause accelerated short squeeze and that is the writing on the wall.
thumbs up if DDD runs up Monday morning
"W, Do not worry. Aurora Labs 3D (A3D.AX ) Made 10 percent today!"
"It is a bet on Aurora`s new metal printing technology. It can go bankrupt or to the moon. I like this risk-reward ratio very much. So, I gave my newborn daughter all of my Aurora Labs 3D stocks (300000) as a first stock present."
Next earnings will be $45 not $40 - IMO
sell other non profitable 3d printing stocks and buy the only profitable 3d stock-DDD
for your information: I am still short on DDD.
Price above Ichimoku cloud right now. buy!
"W remaining silent. I will channel his spirit and will speak for him....""$50 today""......""watch more porn"". - That's all I can channel for now. It takes a lot of effort."
"W - why not just own SSYS and DDD, and stop cheerleading one over the other?"
"HUGE NEWS!With this acquisition, 3D Systems intends to tap the growing opportunities in the smart manufacturing solution space. The company estimates that the spending on smart manufacturing is likely to reach $6.5 billion by 2025 from $1.5 billion today."
"sell SSYS and buy DDD because now it is a perfect timing. In my analysis, SSYS will start a new round of huge drop after the 3rd quarter ER. Rising before the ER is a sure sign of a cliff diving after the ER."
"All - I spoke to my friend W. He and I agree that this goes higher. But, we differ on target prices. I am thinking we stagnate in the mid-30s. He says $69.69. It's a number he seems to love."
Jan has been consistently wrong for five years! Accuracy rate less than 10%.
"30 milestone, feel great"
"Price is now above MA10, ready to take 30 back."
"30 is the new 17, and it can only grow older... Buy!"
W - can you re-post your belief in expected price differential between DDD and SSYS. Thanks
"Hold long term. But, play intra-day put options. Buy every time W posts something bullish, and sell the puts 2 hours later."
"when shorts start attracting W, a yahoo message poster, you know shorts will soon lose everything."
Unless DDD has incredible earnings this stock is probably fairly valued or even slightly over-valued at this price based on DCF.

LOL W with the post of the year. EPS of .37 per share would give you a PE of 250!
This will be heartbreaking if it breaks the 28.. so sorry W…
"Now that an army of Jan’s have left this DDD stock, it is time for DDD to go up significantly. Jan was a trapped long for more than 5 years."
"If 30 is the concrete nuclear steel wall, then we must be on the wrong side of it because we're not over 30."
"Other than the acquisition, which wasn't even a big deal, nothing significant happened since last earnings. They beat estimates hard last time and everyone blindly bought in, now it's on a slow bleed back to pre-earning levels. So, under 25 today or tomorrow?"
"In Feb. DDD peaked at $56, SSYS was 57, Xone was 66 and Prlb was 286 and now we see where the others are. DDD is obviously the winner in the 3d sector. Chasing the winner and holding the winner are the basic rules in stock investment."
"Ddd will be an artificial intelligence (AI) 3d manufacturer after the Opton acquisition, the first 3d company in the entire 3d sector."
Is there a reason they have beaten this stock down over 30? That's usually reserved for misses. Anyone who bought the great last quarterly results got slaughtered.
