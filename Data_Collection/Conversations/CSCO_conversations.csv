If your making any gains in the market you are losing them to inflation. Probably more!!!
Sell at all time high now because no way this is going higher with this:Do you disagree ?“Cisco Stock Dips As Fiscal 2022 Revenue Guidance Shows A Slowdown”
"The ""Beautiful chart"" that some CNBC types had mentioned on Thursday does not look quite so beautiful. I guess it is all about the Fed because I cannot find any news that would explain yesterdays action, or todays."
"I sold csco covered calls 57s. It's like a dividend boost every qtr. Just sell covered calls a couple bucks out of the money. You get the premium, the dividend and the stock is up on the year. Nice return."
"Trump responded, “No, there is no law. As you know, I got elected last time with this same issue. And while I’m under audit, I won’t do it. If I’m not under audit, I would do it. I had no problem with it. But while I’m under audit, I would not give my taxes. There’s no law whatsoever.”Meanwhile in the real world......IRS law generally requires that tax returns be kept confidential. But the section cited by Neal states, “Upon written request from the chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, the chairman of the Committee on Finance of the Senate, or the chairman of the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Secretary shall furnish such committee with any return or return information specified in such request, except that any return or return information which can be associated with, or otherwise identify, directly or indirectly, a particular taxpayer shall be furnished to such committee only when sitting in closed executive session unless such taxpayer otherwise consents in writing to such disclosure.”“There is a law directly on point,” Edward Kleinbard, a professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law and chief of staff for Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation from 2007 to 2009, told us via email."

Jerome Powell said the only way to sustain this level of debt was for the economy to expand....... this is not happening..... over bought stock market doesnt not translate into an expanding economy..... tariffs have choked our growth

any good job openings
"Two steps forward one step back. New 52 week high in the first few minutes a long slow grind lower for the rest of the day with a little buying flurry into the close that left it where it spent most of the day. FAANG mixed. Hoped we would get a little follow through today but the selling was limited on average volume. Third up week in row. Got a little option volume today. someone bought a bunch of the $55.00 calls expiring next week. Sombody betting we will at least be above $55.35 by next Friday. Hardly crawling out on a big limb, but as this stock rarely makes big moves option premiums are quite low. Hope they are right, $56.00 by next Friday would be fine with me."
cool. going down....
will this touch $60?
Ronni just can’t seem to get a post to stick today.
This stock had been great. Didn't fall after earnings!
96% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. 50% in new Rasmussen Poll (higher than Obama at this point in time). Thank you!
Hope this crosses 52 week high of $56.63 today
"This is the key:""The company said orders in the quarter were up double-digits across all customer markets and geographies, with product orders up 31%, the strongest growth in more than a decade."" See you at $60 soon."
"Going higher from here look for the stock to move alot like Microsoft,"
Deals everywhere today. Here we go! Time to back up the truck.
Down 50 cents is a win in my book. Up tomorrow.
This always goes down after ER. At least 4.5%. Free money. Stop gambling emotionally.
CSCO up in A/H!!!

Cisco will lead a network revolution.
CSCO needs to buy other tech companies to grow.

$49-50 after earnings
"AAPL didn't make It to $200 today, Oil came down nicely though... oh wait, never mind it was only 30 cents. Lol"
"Crossing into 57 obviously caused a bunch of sell orders to trigger. Once these clear out, we'll settle down again"
It’ll hit 50 before 60

I want to see this hitting $60. Its fine its a dividend giving company. But won't hurt it it hit $60
Man it would be nice if anyone on this board shared something about CISCO.
"Routers are like refrigerators, they last forever. I don't need a new router."
"Cisco seems to be taking the brunt of the abuse the last couple days, down 6% on no news and in front of ex divvy day. Seems like panic selling by someone. Bought all that I care to hold and will collect the .35 divvy, even if it goes down a little further with the market, at this price I am ok with my buys."
Excellent jobs report!
Crossed 52 week high.... :) :)
"Today action looked remarkably like last Monday. A rising tide all day, except this one flew into the face of big tech. FAANG was universally lower today. No one was even near the flat line. Like last Monday we got a dump into the close. From 1:30 on we hung around $33.50. With 20 minutes to go we were at $33.56 an interday high. Even with 5 minutes to go we were still at $33.48, what would have been the highest close since early 2019. Then in the final 5 mins we take a 15 cent dump on some volume.Overall a pretty good day. First time in a couple of weeks we had two green days in a row. Volume was slightly above average and we are above all the moving averages most technicians track. A break out to $55 or even $58? It doesn't feel like it. I like the way we bucked the tech trend today, but I think we need some news, or a serious big tech tail wind to break out of this range. GLTA"

"Gee, I guess Cisco will get to one trillion market cap in 2060 or 2080? need to make those routers cheaper, smaller and faster!!!Microsoft closes trading with a $2 trillion market cap for first timeMicrosoft (MSFT) closed out the trading day on Thursday with a market capitalization of more than $2 trillion. It was the first time the company closed at the price, putting it alongside Apple (AAPL) as the two major tech firms with market caps above $2 trillion."
Heard the CEO on CNBC while driving earlier this morning. Was a good interview. The earnings and his talk gave me confidence to hold longer term. I do not need the cash to buy something else so I am holding.
60 sooner than most think

This has been giving steady growth for years. CSCO and Intel are my best long term plays with Dividends. 20yrs now with both. Huge companies with great strategies and long term growth. CSCO is becoming my favored one.
Decided today and sold my remaining shares of CSCO... it's been a long ride but a good one.
$CSCO $CCIV Take off quickly and go all the way to the moon.
i live in a 55 and older community with guarded gates 3 huge swimmi g pools an outside concert area and so much more
companies has to upgrade their 20+ years old router to block DDOS attack.. look for CSCO to sell new and improved router with security
"So lets review, APPL dropping, Oil going up nicely."
"CSCO earnings next Thursday 2/12, they are due to declare their annual dividend hike, if any. I am expecting a 2 to 3 cent hike to 37 or 38 cents. Of the dividend is hiked more than that, it would be a sign of strength, as the CEO would be reflecting his confidence about future revenues. If there is no hike, that would be worrying. In the highly unlikely event that the dividend gets cut, that would reveal real trouble for the company and the stock would tank. Either way, the ex dividend date is likely to be on 4-4-20. Good luck to longs!"
"Cisco is rising, aren't you glad holding Cisco instead selling and buy some chip company like some dofu wants you to do .."

And it's not like their profit margin is higher or that they have some sort of extraordinary technology. If you couldn't figure out that bubble company, it's ZM and probably several others"
"""Mueller is closing in fast"" ... LOLOLZZZ"
$CSCO $PLUG $WIMI today is pay day. Guess what that means. buy more.
Looks like Cisco will post a higher high again today. Stock will continue to trend higher into earnings. I think $50 will be here sooner than you think.
"Fredomares: Warren's campaign, has taking a real nose drive.What?"
Always goes down on earnings. So use to it lol
CSCO just got an upgrade. Finally some good news
so what hurts more stock market 27k or vaccine by October from 5 different companies
"The issue CSCO share price seems to be getting hit on is the supply chain and some higher prices from certain suppliers. Its not demand for CSCO products, its not their own product pricing, its not market share, its not profitability and it certainly isn't sky-high valuation. To me, the CSCO ""problem"" is about the best possible problem to have. I'd be concerned if they said demand was down or that pricing was was getting squeezed. But those aren't the issues Wall St seemingly has with the report. With solid demand, margins will stay strong and much of the stuff they sell will lock in revenue streams for years to come. Expect the supply chain issues to mitigate over a quarter or two. If nothing else, CSCO has likely has enough pricing power to pass on higher costs. They are a big enough customer that most suppliers will make sure CSCO gets what they need. So this is a mid to upper teens P/E with a rock solid balance sheet and strong core businesses. The business is fine. CSCO isn't isn't a glory stock, but it won't burn you either. If the share price drops after earnings, expect it to be a buying opportunity. Just as its been the last several quarters. It dips, then within a week or two, winds up trading higher than it did before the quarter. My guess, the share price will be $57-58 by early Sept. Which would still be just a 17-ish P/E."

Cisco had the strongest DC sales in over 8 years. This one may just go up after earnings.
"From The Fly on the Wall 3:19 PM ET 08/18/2021Pre-earnings options volume in Cisco (CSCO) is 1.9x normal with calls leading puts 10:7. Implied volatility suggests the market is anticipating a move near 5.8%, or $3.23, after results are released. Median move over the past eight quarters is 6.1%."

"Rift Between Trump and Europe Is Now Open and AngryVice President Mike Pence and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in Munich on Saturday. She pushed back against his call for European allies to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.CreditMatthias Schrader/Associated PressImageVice President Mike Pence and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany in Munich on Saturday. She pushed back against his call for European allies to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.CreditCreditMatthias Schrader/Associated PressBy Steven Erlanger and Katrin BennholdFeb. 17, 2019MUNICH — European leaders have long been alarmed that President Trump’s words and Twitter messages could undo a trans-Atlantic alliance that had grown stronger over seven decades. They had clung to the hope that those ties would bear up under the strain.But in the last few days of a prestigious annual security conference in Munich, the rift between Europe and the Trump administration became open, angry and concrete, diplomats and analysts say.A senior German official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak on such matters, shrugged his shoulders and said: “No one any longer believes that Trump cares about the views or interests of the allies. It’s broken.”The most immediate danger, diplomats and intelligence officials warned, is that the trans-Atlantic fissures now risk being exploited by Russia and China.ADVERTISEMENTEven the saturnine Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, happily noted the strains, remarking that the Euro-Atlantic relationship had become increasingly “tense.”“We see new cracks forming, and old cracks deepening,” Mr. Lavrov said.The Europeans no longer believe that Washington will change, not when Mr. Trump sees traditional allies as economic rivals and leadership as diktat. His distaste for multilateralism and international cooperation is a challenge to the very heart of what Europe is and needs to be in order to have an impact in the world.You have 4 free articles remaining.Subscribe to The TimesBut beyond the Trump administration, an increasing number of Europeans say they believe that relations with the United States will never be the same again.Karl Kaiser, a longtime analyst of German-American relations, said, “Two years of Mr. Trump, and a majority of French and Germans now trust Russia and China more than the United States.”"

"It's true, Oil up nicely!"
"Tough day for CSCO bulls. Down over 2% at the lows, on no news. Much Fed and inflation talk seemed to drag the whole market down to the low. CSCO gave up almost all of Thursday gain. It bounced off of the 15 DMA but still closed with a 1% loss. Volume about average for lately. Tomorrow? It is tough to say, but everyone seems to be focused on the Fed. I don't know why. They have signaled that they will do nothing in the near or even medium term. I don't know why anyone expects any different. GLTA"

"I've heard some buzz about Huawei taking market share from CSCO. I don't have a crystal ball, but I've done very well in the stock market over the past 30 years by taking financial news, analyst ratings and articles with a grain of salt, and primarily doing my own DD. I find that applying common sense beats both fundamental and technical analysis by far. Most people make investing far more complicated than it has to be. So what do I think of Huawei eating CSCO's lunch? There is a very simple experiment that anyone can do. No MBA is needed. Take an hour out of your life and count how many cell phones you see... in the streets of Manhattan, the subway, in Starbucks, in a doctor's waiting room. Keep track of how many of them are made by Apple and how many are made by Huawei. I think you get the point. Consumers trust Chinese products for their non-essentials. But no one trusts a Chinese product when it comes to their communications which are vital to their lives. Now extend this same thinking to private enterprise. When it's time to upgrade to 5G, do you really think a business owner is going to trust the survival of their business to a product of questionable quality and security? Of course not. You can read hundreds of articles and comments about Huawei's growth and market share and what it means to American companies, but trust me, this is the only comment you'll ever need to read on the topic. Don't overthink it."
Tim Seymore just pumped CSCO on fast money. I am certain it has been a while since two prominent traders on two CNBC trading shows meentioned CSCO in the same day. we are headed higher near term. Next stop $58.00

"lots of working class waking up to find they aren't getting a refund this year but at least the rich are OK.Buying a private jet comes with a hefty price tag — but the Republicans' new tax bill has made the extravagant purchase more appealing to some.Private jet buyers can now write off the full amount of their new plane's cost on their tax return, which applies to both new and pre-owned aircraft. That's due to a policy change within the Trump Administration's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that updated the US tax code to allow 100% bonus depreciation for items such as aircraft.For the mega-wealthy of the world, this deduction accounts for much, if not all, of their millions in tax liability — meaning buying a new private jet could practically wipe out their tax bill in the year they buy it."

"Imagine you are interviewing candidates for CEO or for a seat on the BOD of your publicly traded company. Imagine in that interview a candidate told you they didn't believe in Capitalism. Would you still hire them? Well apparently CISCO would.Under CEO Chuck Robbins, Cisco donated $5 million to the hate and anti capitalism group BLM. Chuck Robbins is also a trustee of the Ford Foundation who together with Borealis Philanthropy, donated an additional $100 million to BLM!I will never invest in a company that donates to hate groups who are out to destroy the basic principles of capitalism.Shareholders should demand the immediate termination of Chuck Robbins as well as any member of the BOD’s that approved this donation."
"Boom:SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California would slash spending on education and cancel plans to expand healthcare under a revised budget proposed on Thursday by Governor Gavin Newsom as coronavirus-related woes thrash the world’s fifth-largest economy. Newsom, a Democrat, cut his proposed budget for the next fiscal year by $19 billion from his original proposal in January, bringing spending below even current fiscal-year levels.The revised budget would cut funding for public schools and universities, environmental protection and natural resource management, and dramatically scale back programs planned when the state was flush with cash just a few months ago.State employees will be asked to accept pay cuts of 10%, and agencies will be expected to increase efficiency by 5%, Newsom told a news conference in the state capital, Sacramento."
"Every company is trying to hire. Earlier in the year, Cisco had 420 job openings to be filled. Cisco right now has 631 job openings. This is 50% higher than just a few months ago. In 2018, economists were making a big stink since there were over 6 million job openings. That was the highest ever in US history at the time. Inflation concerns were quite high and rightfully so. Now, where do you think that number is? 7 million? No. 8 million? No. There are currently over 9.2 million job openings in the US, and managers are having a very difficult time getting these people. The cost of labor is starting to surge. Insurance costs are up by 30%. Paper costs are up more than 20%. Gasoline prices are up by 40%. Home prices are up, rent prices are up. 10-year bond interest rate is up by 200%. 5 months ago we started the inflation spiral and it keeps getting worse. The Fed has gotten behind the curve on this, and the consequences will be disastrous. When the Fed starts raising interest rates, it will be inflationary. The first few percent increase does nothing to slow spending. In fact, it will cause a surge in inflation as people see this as a confirmation that the Fed knows inflation is rising. People will begin to purchase big-ticket items like refrigerators and cars while interest rates and prices are still low. Soon people will realize that if they want something, they’d better buy it now, because 6 months from now, it likely will be 40% more expensive.Even the stripped-out CPI and CPE price indexes are rising very rapidly. For the past 5 months, we have seen a 1.2X sequential monthly growth in the sequential monthly inflation rate. After January it started to get ugly. We are already at 8% annualized inflation! This is 4X of the Fed’s 2% target, they should have been raising rates 5 months ago. The bad part is that the only way out of this inflationary loop will be rapid and large increases of interest rates. That will drop overvalued stocks to less than 50% of their current levels."
It has been a long time but I seem to remember that CSCO was over a $300.00 a share company. Don't sell CSCO short.

"Occupy Wall Street was the left’s response to the Tea Party movement, which had carried Republicans back to power in the House in the 2010 midterm elections, abruptly ending what Democrats believed would be 40 years of dominance after Obama’s sweeping victory in 2008.But whereas the Tea Party was law-abiding and grounded in constitutional principles. Occupy Wall Street proudly violated the law and called for the destruction of the entire economic system.Obama and the Democrats embraced the fringe Occupy movement and elevated it to the mainstream of American politics."

"In 2018, with the Trump tax cuts and other magical elements of Trumpism on the books, it fell again to 3.9 percent.

"The Hillary Clinton Campaign and the Democratic National Committee allegedly used state chapters as strawmen to launder as much as $84 million in an effort to circumvent campaign donation limits, and the Federal Election Commission ignored complaints exposing the practice, a lawsuit filed Monday claims.The Committee to Defend the President (CDP), a political action committee formally known as Stop Hillary PAC, filed its complaint with the FEC in December 2017 with the claims that the Hillary Victory Fund (HVF) solicited cash from big-name donors, and allegedly sent that money through state chapters and back to the DNC before ending up with the Clinton campaign.As first reported by Fox News at the time, the CDP alleges in its complaint that about $84 million was funneled illegally from the DNC through state party chapters and back into the war chest of the Clinton campaign. The political action committee claims that even though the FEC acknowledged receipt of the complaint and claimed that an investigation would be conducted, the needle has barely moved.“The Clinton machine has escaped accountability for its illegal practices for far too long,” Ted Harvey, CDP chairman, said to Fox News. “After months of review, the FEC has refused to address the Clintons’ $84 million money laundering scheme that violated several campaign finance laws.”"

"Quite the interesting day. 52 week high, 52 week closing high, however volume was the lowest since Christmas Eve. This does not look like a breakout is poised to happen. Third green day in a row, that hasn't happened since early May. Second green week in a row. It has been a while since that happened. It moved with FAANG which was all green today. Normally I would be optimistic for next week but the paltry volume gives me pause. Other technical factors look good but I doubt the momo traders will be jumping into CSCO. Nice fundy news this morning, but nothing world shaking. It probably helped a little. Next week breakout or double top? I am long but I could see an argument for either side."
"will $CSCO really surprise ? if yes, will it go up or down?"
Weak guidance??

Interesting that yahoo won't let me post on how Cisco's ceo had a hand in donating $105 million to BLM. A group that has as one of it's missions to end Capitalism. CEO and entire BOD should be fired for approving this donation. $5 million from Cisco and another $100 million through the Borealis Foundation of which Chuck Robbins (cisco ceo) is a trustee.

"CSCO the best 5G stock to ow. ""Cisco 5G Power x is a cloud-to-client approach to 5G. The solution delivers an open, hyper-programmable architecture (according to the information posted on its website). Any combination of cellular, Wi-Fi and IP access is supported. Cisco stock trades at just below 20 times forward earnings and earnings are expected to grow by nearly 10% for the next five years. This pace could be even higher as the rate of 5G orders increases this year."""
Market poised to make investors happy again today

"Or as Trump supporters would say, melting ice means there is more of it. LOLThat's how much ice Earth's glaciers lost in the 55 years between 1961 and 2016. An international team of scientists used satellite and direct field observations to conclude that Earth's glaciers have melted such a profound sum of ice in the last half-century. They published their report Monday in the journal Nature. If one were to assume an average weight of 735,000 pounds for a 747 airliner (not the colossal Alaskan bear), that comes out to around 27 billion 747s worth of ice lost over this period. This grand figure also means the planet is losing, on average, 335 billion metric tons of ice per year. (For reference, there are 2 trillion pounds of ice in just 1 billion tons.)""In other words, every single year we are losing about three times the volume of all ice stored in the European Alps, and this accounts for around 30 percent of the current rate of sea-level rise,"" Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service at the University of Zurich and lead author of the research, said in a statement."
"Belief in the invisible man in the sky People believe in scripture and place value in the words because they already believe in the religious principles the text describes. There is no inherent value to the Bible, Quran or any other religious text; these documents are not self-authenticating in any way.In fact, many factual inaccuracies and inconsistencies can be found within religious texts themselves. For example, the Bible contains two separate creation stories, each of which provides a very different explanation. Similarly, there is no historical, archaeological or scientific evidence to support many of the stories in the Bible and the Quran.Ultimately, religious texts are infinitely fallible because they are man-made products of whimsy, poetry, mythology and some history woven together into a new whole. The texts in the Bible have been gathered from many oral sources over thousands of years and compiled arbitrarily into a single document; it's hardly surprising that the narrative would be so inconsistent. Other religious texts have similarly convoluted histories.Aside from the problems with individual texts, there's also the obvious issue that the very presence of multiple scriptures negates the authenticity of any single religious document. It's impossible for every religious book to be true; it's highly presumptuous to assume that one's own preferred scripture is the single ""true"" scripture while all the others are false accounts. It's far more likely that every religious book is equally fictitious and unreliable."
this can still be a growth stock

Floater or a sinker (MASA)?
Any oldtimers here remember back in the 90's when CSCO earnings release was huge deal? CNBC would devote 3 days to it. Now no one on the board even mentions it.
I'm glad I held onto this stock!

$1.4 trillions for infrastructure - some of that is going into broadband per the bill. that's a lot of router and fiber roll out next 10 years.
"Hey CSCO followers.....Gerry here. I thought you might want some actual CSCO talk. So here it is. Please remember that CSCO's CFO said that they aggressively buy their stock if it fall to the $50.00/ssh range, so you should do the same IF it gets there. Also the suppliers to Huawei are seeing a significant drop in sales and Huawei said they are down 20-30% on smartphone equipment sales. HUAWEI's loss is a positive for CSCO. I don't think we will see CSCO in the $50-$51 range..........but if it gets there pull the trigger. GLTU"
Does this stock ever have a big earnings beat? Like 10 or even 5 cents? Is the outlook ever much better than expected? Has it ever had a big positive move after earnings? I have owed this for 5 or 6 years and I don’t remember it ever happening.Just a boring go nowhere stock…………..
"Aug 3'20: SP was $47.43 ... now we are around $53.60, roughly a 13% increase ... other tech stocks (Oracle, Microsoft, etc) have generated gains of 25% or more, 2x compared to this bloated, poorly run company ... CSCO has devolved to a Utility ... they need to do some deep cost-cutting of mgmt layers, invest more in R&D, and bring in better Exec talent; the current SP is just not good enough"
