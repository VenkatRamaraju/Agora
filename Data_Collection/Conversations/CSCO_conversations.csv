"Cisco is rising, aren't you glad holding Cisco instead selling and buy some chip company like some dofu wants you to do .."
"As per the current trend, CISCO can easily cross $57.40 today"
I’d just be happy with a positive day at this point. $CSCO $VENA
Upgraded to Outperform at Credit Suisse. Price target raised to $74 from $56.
"$CSCO $VENAThe jig is up, nobody wants to sell.. we know their games & we don’t care if this dips."
Thanks CISCO for the good Profit today.
Always goes down on earnings. So use to it lol
This has been giving steady growth for years. CSCO and Intel are my best long term plays with Dividends. 20yrs now with both. Huge companies with great strategies and long term growth. CSCO is becoming my favored one.
Maintained as Overweight at Barclays. Price target $62.Maintained as Neutral at Citigroup . Price target $55.
"This is the key:""The company said orders in the quarter were up double-digits across all customer markets and geographies, with product orders up 31%, the strongest growth in more than a decade."" See you at $60 soon."
"From The Fly on the Wall 3:19 PM ET 08/18/2021Pre-earnings options volume in Cisco (CSCO) is 1.9x normal with calls leading puts 10:7. Implied volatility suggests the market is anticipating a move near 5.8%, or $3.23, after results are released. Median move over the past eight quarters is 6.1%."
The new MSFT
Anybody have an idea why csco down 12% in the last 4 weeks ..... have owned this dog for over 20 years and just when it think it's finally going to keeps it's gains it drops like a rock .... whats up????
$40 stock within next 4 weeks
I'm glad I held onto this stock!
65 next month
CSCO hits new 52-week high at $60.19!
$CSCO $WIMI $INTC When you invest in Stock market you need to take your emotion out of it!! Focus and stay strong!!
"The issue CSCO share price seems to be getting hit on is the supply chain and some higher prices from certain suppliers. Its not demand for CSCO products, its not their own product pricing, its not market share, its not profitability and it certainly isn't sky-high valuation. To me, the CSCO ""problem"" is about the best possible problem to have. I'd be concerned if they said demand was down or that pricing was was getting squeezed. But those aren't the issues Wall St seemingly has with the report. With solid demand, margins will stay strong and much of the stuff they sell will lock in revenue streams for years to come. Expect the supply chain issues to mitigate over a quarter or two. If nothing else, CSCO has likely has enough pricing power to pass on higher costs. They are a big enough customer that most suppliers will make sure CSCO gets what they need. So this is a mid to upper teens P/E with a rock solid balance sheet and strong core businesses. The business is fine. CSCO isn't isn't a glory stock, but it won't burn you either. If the share price drops after earnings, expect it to be a buying opportunity. Just as its been the last several quarters. It dips, then within a week or two, winds up trading higher than it did before the quarter. My guess, the share price will be $57-58 by early Sept. Which would still be just a 17-ish P/E."
"As a big old tech company, it definitely can't grow very fast, but compare its price with for example Zoom, it's a better choice. Hope it can reach $60 this year."
"Cisco to buy Epsagon for application, microservice managementCisco’s fifth acquisition this year is Epsagon, whose application-performance technology will be integrated into Cisco’s AppDynamics performance-management platform. 500 million."
"Everytime I have ever sold something for a loss, I regretted it a few days later $CSCO $VENA"
"If in case it was missed ""Credit Suisse analyst Sami Badri upgraded Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ: CSCO) from Neutral to Outperform and raised the price target from $56 to $74.""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-upgraded-bank-america-mgm-212339828.html"
Morgan Stanley is free to make its value call. I say buy the dip. Going higher.
Heard the CEO on CNBC while driving earlier this morning. Was a good interview. The earnings and his talk gave me confidence to hold longer term. I do not need the cash to buy something else so I am holding.
cool. going down....
"In 2013 I told folks to sell this stock and buy OMCL, the tea billies here ridiculed me. My OMCL has gone from 20 to 160, CSCO has gone from 24 to 56 (so omcl is up 700% and CSCO is up 100%). This is a commodity company it is still a sell."
CSCO to join dividend aristocrat - congrats
Guidance!!!! lower side.
$CSCO $WIMI $QCOM volume is not there for all of you who are short! Don’t celebrate to soon!
They had some interesting insights about CSCO on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
What happened? Why sudden drop after going to $59?Dow is up solidly and CSCO dropping. Not good.
Plentiful upgrades and bullish sentiment. Bodes well for my $75 pt.
Up strongly .....on strong volume..... which is a real foundation for moving forward.
Hope this crosses 52 week high of $56.63 today
WHY does everyone not like this stock
CSCO to $65 by December!!!
"Would love to see this company do something someday. Hike the dividend, raise earnings guidance,....anything. Just do something! I bought 5000 shares in 2002, and have been holding tight since. The dividend has been nice, but nothing exceptional. The price growth again nice, but nothing exceptional."
what does this breakout mean for overall market? $VENA $CSCO
I'm glad to see so many  posts. It just tells me that the top is coming. $IBM $WIMI $CSCO
"Cisco Board of Directors declares quarterly cash dividend$0.37 per common share to be paid on October 27, 2021 to all stockholders of record as of October 5, 2021Previous dividend of $0.37 per common share paid on July 28, 2021Cisco ( CSCO) announced that earlier today its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.37 per common share to be paid on October 27, 2021, to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 5, 2021."
What’s happening in after hours? It’s skyrocketing
Technician says $70. Incredible. Buy.
DZSI is going to to be a huge player in the 5G and GPON along with the mobile backhaul. This is a company the Cisco would like to buy.
Maintains Barclays: to Overweight 8/19/2021Maintains Citigroup: to Neutral 8/19/2021So our ER is good and we will be green soon if market turns into green........we are red because entire market is red across the board.........GL every one
Maybe orange guy wasn't so bad after all.
In a nutshell: 5-7% Revenue growth YoY thru 2025 (6% was expected)5-7% Profit growth YoY thru 2025 (9% was expected)CSCO is projecting profit growth BELOW expectations......that's why the stock is down.ALL (or most) brokerage houses will lift the price target and SELL into it as retail investors buy.
Buy hold and never sell. Should be part of everyone’s core holding.$TSLA $WIMI $CSCO
$CSCO $AMAT $WIMI This is the only time I have ever voted for something in my life. This is the only vote that ever mattered to me.
This stock had been great. Didn't fall after earnings!
$CSCO $WIMI Just hold for once in your life. Really simple. You look like a genius after the fact!$AMAT

Decent beat. Should do well this quarter.
Any oldtimers here remember back in the 90's when CSCO earnings release was huge deal? CNBC would devote 3 days to it. Now no one on the board even mentions it.
60 sooner than most think
Dude that bought puts maybe right stock down after hours.
"It possibly closed below $60 today, probably because there were likely many 'Sell' limit orders set at 60. Once these clear out, it can resume it's onward path."

Cisco had the strongest DC sales in over 8 years. This one may just go up after earnings.
"Happy to see that there are no artifical pumpers in this board who always yell ""going to moon"""
Started a position today. Looks like a good entry point for the long term!
I'm just in for the dividend and the growth thereof. lower share price actually increases my dividend return.
what does this breakout mean for overall market? $CSCO $VENA
Morgan Stanley's bold call a few shorts days ago now a joke lol. Buy.
Huge jump from neutral to outperform by CS with $74 pt. Algos now recalibrating. Bullish.
"I sold csco covered calls 57s. It's like a dividend boost every qtr. Just sell covered calls a couple bucks out of the money. You get the premium, the dividend and the stock is up on the year. Nice return."
$BJ $CSCO $DKS i should have bullish with these stocks..
"CSCO has been an amazing performer since November 2020. Whatever wasn't working during the previous years, had suddenly started working splendidly since last November (look at the chart)! Thank you, CSCO!Of course, most other stocks have shown outstanding gains since last November, too!"
"we are not down because of the ER, it is due to market is red across the board........ and most of the stocks are taking a nose dive. so it is a market pressure rather then ER , we will be good moving forward and touch $60 to $75 by year end...I have been working for Cisco for 16+ years and I am fully confident about fundamental/future of our company and I have full trust .......... we pay div and we will not fly 20% in a day and evaporate in a next day or two.....we are making steady progress with proven growth/market share..."
"My patience with CSCO is paying off a little bit: I have QQQ and CSCO is till lagging in return. What I like about CSCO is the management team, reliable and solid. The subscription model is paying off and equipment demand is going up. I expect to see $80 within a year."
This is the kind of opportunity that people will look back at and say investing here was the best decision of your life. $CSCO $VENA
$CSCO $RBLX $WIMI higher highs and higher lows here the last few days
I’m holding on. This could be a new baseline. Comments?
why this stock is down?
Valueline gave up on Intel as #1 Semi now it’s CSCO BUT THEY are dwn
"I'm OK with CSCO's stock performance. Up from $42 to $55 last 12 months. My friends, this is an old tech company. Don't expect new tech beta....I own some of this for the same reason I have IBM. It is what it is."
I bought CSCO at $34 March 2010 when market took dive. Best Buy in long time. Holding for long term as nothing but growth ahead.
"If you want to get in now s the time. This stock with be much higher in the not too distant future. This is Dan Niles biggest position ,he said so recently on TV. Csco is waking up from its long slumber. All aboard"
Accumulate shares and hodl $CSCO $VENA
This always goes down after ER. At least 4.5%. Free money. Stop gambling emotionally.

"interesting, price target are high but stock is going down... :)"
$CSCO $VENAHave you seen your spending habits affected by inflation
Does this stock ever have a big earnings beat? Like 10 or even 5 cents? Is the outlook ever much better than expected? Has it ever had a big positive move after earnings? I have owed this for 5 or 6 years and I don’t remember it ever happening.Just a boring go nowhere stock…………..
"Cisco like HPE, HPQ, ORCL, IBM kind of legacy companies. It is lucky that it has some nice run recently but don't know how far it can go and lost momentum recently. Regarding P/E it is higher than the rest and dividend is not as attractive as IBM. Cisco as an income stock should bump up the dividend to match with HPE or IBM."
"Going higher from here look for the stock to move alot like Microsoft,"
They are sharing at investor meeting. Future looks very bright! I bought today.
Simply Wall Street - which is really TOUGH on most stock prices - says CSCO should be at $82 after their analysis...check it out.
"Volume is low so far today. Most are obviously sitting and waiting for the numbers/Guidance.Even though we're down this morning, it is probably just the nervous crowd.I'm sitting and most definitely holding"
$ORCL $CSCO i think this going be 500B market cap company?
Imagine investing in a company who's ceo and BOD doesn't believe in Capitalism. That's what you are doing if you invest in CISCO.
"This is a new star, it needs to grow $CSCO $WIMI"
Buying Cisco at $36.00 is paying off.
Sell at all time high now because no way this is going higher with this:Do you disagree ?“Cisco Stock Dips As Fiscal 2022 Revenue Guidance Shows A Slowdown”
