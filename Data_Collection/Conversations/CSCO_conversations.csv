I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Fairstox.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
"$65 billions for broadband, hope Cisco get some of that billions"
"My patience with CSCO is paying off a little bit: I have QQQ and CSCO is till lagging in return. What I like about CSCO is the management team, reliable and solid. The subscription model is paying off and equipment demand is going up. I expect to see $80 within a year."
This has been giving steady growth for years. CSCO and Intel are my best long term plays with Dividends. 20yrs now with both. Huge companies with great strategies and long term growth. CSCO is becoming my favored one.

"From The Fly on the Wall 3:19 PM ET 08/18/2021Pre-earnings options volume in Cisco (CSCO) is 1.9x normal with calls leading puts 10:7. Implied volatility suggests the market is anticipating a move near 5.8%, or $3.23, after results are released. Median move over the past eight quarters is 6.1%."
Heard the CEO on CNBC while driving earlier this morning. Was a good interview. The earnings and his talk gave me confidence to hold longer term. I do not need the cash to buy something else so I am holding.
"This is the key:""The company said orders in the quarter were up double-digits across all customer markets and geographies, with product orders up 31%, the strongest growth in more than a decade."" See you at $60 soon."
Hope this crosses 52 week high of $56.63 today

Any oldtimers here remember back in the 90's when CSCO earnings release was huge deal? CNBC would devote 3 days to it. Now no one on the board even mentions it.
"If you want to get in now s the time. This stock with be much higher in the not too distant future. This is Dan Niles biggest position ,he said so recently on TV. Csco is waking up from its long slumber. All aboard"
Up strongly .....on strong volume..... which is a real foundation for moving forward.
"suddenly all these old tech, csco ebay orcl are wall st darlings....lol......wish intel coming along soon."
"I sold csco covered calls 57s. It's like a dividend boost every qtr. Just sell covered calls a couple bucks out of the money. You get the premium, the dividend and the stock is up on the year. Nice return."
Buying Cisco at $36.00 is paying off.
"Cisco is rising, aren't you glad holding Cisco instead selling and buy some chip company like some dofu wants you to do .."
Maintained as Overweight at Barclays. Price target $62.Maintained as Neutral at Citigroup . Price target $55.
$58 today.
60 sooner than most think
"As a big old tech company, it definitely can't grow very fast, but compare its price with for example Zoom, it's a better choice. Hope it can reach $60 this year."
"I'm OK with CSCO's stock performance. Up from $42 to $55 last 12 months. My friends, this is an old tech company. Don't expect new tech beta....I own some of this for the same reason I have IBM. It is what it is."
"As per the current trend, CISCO can easily cross $57.40 today"
Dude that bought puts maybe right stock down after hours.
This always goes down after ER. At least 4.5%. Free money. Stop gambling emotionally.
Sell at all time high now because no way this is going higher with this:Do you disagree ?“Cisco Stock Dips As Fiscal 2022 Revenue Guidance Shows A Slowdown”
"Volume is low so far today. Most are obviously sitting and waiting for the numbers/Guidance.Even though we're down this morning, it is probably just the nervous crowd.I'm sitting and most definitely holding"
Thanks CISCO for the good Profit today.
Technician says $70. Incredible. Buy.
"Going higher from here look for the stock to move alot like Microsoft,"
I'm just in for the dividend and the growth thereof. lower share price actually increases my dividend return.
$BJ $CSCO $DKS i should have bullish with these stocks..
This stock had been great. Didn't fall after earnings!
Cisco 65.00 coming by years end
"CSCO has been an amazing performer since November 2020. Whatever wasn't working during the previous years, had suddenly started working splendidly since last November (look at the chart)! Thank you, CSCO!Of course, most other stocks have shown outstanding gains since last November, too!"
"we are not down because of the ER, it is due to market is red across the board........ and most of the stocks are taking a nose dive. so it is a market pressure rather then ER , we will be good moving forward and touch $60 to $75 by year end...I have been working for Cisco for 16+ years and I am fully confident about fundamental/future of our company and I have full trust .......... we pay div and we will not fly 20% in a day and evaporate in a next day or two.....we are making steady progress with proven growth/market share..."
"The issue CSCO share price seems to be getting hit on is the supply chain and some higher prices from certain suppliers. Its not demand for CSCO products, its not their own product pricing, its not market share, its not profitability and it certainly isn't sky-high valuation. To me, the CSCO ""problem"" is about the best possible problem to have. I'd be concerned if they said demand was down or that pricing was was getting squeezed. But those aren't the issues Wall St seemingly has with the report. With solid demand, margins will stay strong and much of the stuff they sell will lock in revenue streams for years to come. Expect the supply chain issues to mitigate over a quarter or two. If nothing else, CSCO has likely has enough pricing power to pass on higher costs. They are a big enough customer that most suppliers will make sure CSCO gets what they need. So this is a mid to upper teens P/E with a rock solid balance sheet and strong core businesses. The business is fine. CSCO isn't isn't a glory stock, but it won't burn you either. If the share price drops after earnings, expect it to be a buying opportunity. Just as its been the last several quarters. It dips, then within a week or two, winds up trading higher than it did before the quarter. My guess, the share price will be $57-58 by early Sept. Which would still be just a 17-ish P/E."
"It possibly closed below $60 today, probably because there were likely many 'Sell' limit orders set at 60. Once these clear out, it can resume it's onward path."
$ORCL $CSCO i think this going be 500B market cap company?
