"Market cap now is roughly equal to the cash they have. Yet, it keeps going down. What does that tell you? They have enough cash to do a buyback and could buy make the whole company at this rate. Mean time the whole market is not helping and with it being October may get a lot worse. If there was a time for some good news it is now. I've been waiting for it and it just keeps going down. The good news, if there is any will be this will reverse sharply. But right now it is not looking good. Where is all the institutions cost averaging? That is the real head scratcher. Why aren't they cost averaging when it is this cheap? Worse yet, maybe they have all sold by now? Every penny this goes down my loss increases by $2,000. Its not been an easy decision to just remain holding. Looking for better days ahead through an overall market storm coming is the short version of my post. Where's the buyback announcement even if they do not buy any back? BTW A reverse split by itself is harmless if there are no more shares issued causing dilution. But, at this point no one including me will trust management that they will not issue more shares. You never wait till the last minute to raise cash. We are not there yet, but it will certainly happen long before the 15 months they said they have. WHERE'S THE BUYBACK ANNOUNCEMENT MGMT? Throw us a bone!"
Big D…..buying a few thousand more today??? 
Are we waiting for something?
"Right from the horses mouth (IR):""Good Morning,There will be an announcement tomorrow morning regarding the timing of the earnings release.Regards,Judy"""
"I’m surprised of the sell off based on the FDA report. I do not see any show stoppers! Or any significant issues. Mainly dose data is missing.The main question is simple : will FDA approve this drug? I say definitely yes. They’re requesting additional data and trials. What’s wrong with that? The only issue I have is time. How long will it take ? Am I going to tie my money until approval? Yes I’m . In fact , I bought much more shares at lower prices yesterday. This is a very good investment and will pay off within 4-6 months for sure. Low risk investment."
My expectation we are not too far from the date when we will be happy  pray
Glad I bought another few thou yesterday. Holding
this not going anywhere......https://www.patreon.com/posts/56102196
Already traded 6 million shares ! WOW !
" What has happened for the SP to jump from $0.7 to $2.1 was a typical quick short covering by hedge funds. But the real ""Blood bath"" will take place on next week after everyone reads the CRL carefully and know that FDA requires at lease 2 years of new trails, manufacturing efforts, and more money to be spent. New stock offering with 50% discount and dilution are for sure on the way. The SP will be under $1 for sure in a couple of weeks. This company was trading at $0.3 sometime ago. Back to basis. Same of what has happened to $AKBA, $ITRM, $ARDX, $ADVM."
Rarely we have an opportunity to buy low sell high then buy even lower. When that happens don’t let go cuz there is no 3rd times a charm. But I’m still hoping for 45 cents our boy Inam or Rajesh promised because I will sell ALL my $1.20 #NIO and 50 cents #OTLK to grab all itrm shares as I can when that happens.
Positive and promising update tomorrow morning in my opinion
Mark. I hope you are right. I have taken a beating in this stock. Believing in the product is why I am staying.
Like I said last week when stock was $1.20. FDA halted review due to deficiencies. We knew this in early July. Hopefully the money lost here was small amounts.GLTA.
The only thing i need from this stock right now is those lawsuit news to stop.
"with the news, the shorts will jump in!!"
This is going to turn around fast $2.00
"One that we are waiting for news.Soule CEO Fishman and management not held any responsibility in having phase 3 screwed up with only 1 comparaison drug when now, it came out that more data was needed ?And if yes, should they not come out of their sweet confortable zone and step out some by using the $ 90 M on hand and support current shareholders by removing possibility of reverse split for next 12/15 months. There is plenty of money on hand for this simple step and it would help enormously getting out of the NADAQ « minimum $ 1 PPS » rule hole. Calling on CEO Fishman to officially state loud and clear that R/S is of the table for the next 12/15 months as co has plenty of money on hand until 2023.By then, FDA should have approved the results provided by extended phase 3 or R/S will be the least of our trouble."
FDA approval is on the way......by end of sept.
"Another gem in the making here. If you missed the run up over at #CNSP #ITRM and most recently #OTLK#NIO tribe, have you seen my pumpernickel DavidNIO? Can someone contact him on WhatsApp. He has made more millionaires compared to crypto scammers lurking everywhere. We need 3X here at least!*This is for entertainment purposes only. Do not copy me. But you can certainly Follow the Money otherwise YOMO"
Watch it after hours ..
A buyback makes more sense than a reverse split to gain back compliance.
"Flat-lined at 81 cents earlier this week and now it looks like its flat-lined at 75 cents. And if they were going to release earnings today, yesterday or whenever why don't they put out a PR ahead of time to let us all know? I have never seen a stock where the earnings release date was so much up in the air. Nothing has changed on Yahoo mobile app or TDAmeritrade."
"Hey, CEO Fishman, Am with you.This time around, Better take a few days longer and do it completely right.But still, would be nice to hear what’s going on in your Irish neck of the woods."
Market Cap $127M and $100M in Cash! Great ratio….staying the course.
The FDA destroyed this company.
There seems to be a lot of volume for this stock this morning. Maybe I'm missing something.
A positive business update this week will send this stock back over $1. Added today and staying long.
"“Additionally, the FDA recommended that Iterum conduct further nonclinical investigation to determine the optimal dosing regimen, although the FDA stated that this recommendation does not raise an approvability issue. The FDA indicated its willingness to work with Iterum on the design of the clinical trial(s) to address the deficiencies noted.There were no chemistry, manufacturing or controls (CMC) issues identified in the CRL, nor were there any safety issues found in over 1,800 patients treated with sulopenem across the Company’s clinical development program.”I had read this statement 5 times and here is my opinion:- Sulopenem for non complicated UTI had been approved silently: fda acknowledges superior, no chemicals issues, willing to work with ITRM team...- But they needed another trial for what? Yes for optimal dose regiments. No need high dose for non complicated UTI. I guess next clinical trial will be: a comparator drug (levofloxaci or ofloxacin...) vs several dose regiments from low to high( Sulopenem 400mg, 600mg , 800mg and 1000mg) As the result, fda will select the optimal dose for new drug"
"Those who cost average could end up making some money, imo.FDA meeting update should boost this up a bit, as this is not the end of road for ITRM, based on the PR update today, imo.Also, they have sufficient money till 2023 and Float is getting thinner because some folks are doubling down to cost average. This is not a solicitation to buy or pump. jmho."
I`m not gonna sell this sheet. I will keep it until I die. My revenge.
This is going to at least $2 by September
We should be receiving an update regarding the FDA requirements soon. Anticipating a relatively quick study (4-6 months) which will solidify approval. Holding until approval and acquisition $10-12 range!!
I hope we hear something positive about class A meeting soon..Can’t take this blood bath  
"Hey, CB just what exactly do you think the company should be communicating? Have you called them to see when they might be able to communicate what you are after? Do you think that maybe the reason they are not communicating anything right now is because every Tom, #$%$ and Harry law firm in the SEC world is suing them for communicating misleading information? Back to my original question. Just what do you think they can communicate right now that they have not already done so without being sued? You have been tooting your horn here multiple times complaining about this without revealing what you think they should be communicating. SO WHAT IS IT?!"
2K shares @2.25. still holding. any hope here?
"Was the increase in number of shares traded over the past week due to the lawsuit, or lack thereof, of a lawsuit?"
This dip to almost the 52 week low is awesome. How’s that Brucey? Have a good weekend. 
Huge number of shares traded as of 9:55AM. Nearly 11 million.
"Do not scare me with these exposed movements, I will not sell my shares, nor will I buy"
Just don’t buy !!
TYPE A meeting with FDA possibly coming soon (LATER Q3) so after that is announced this stock should start climbing back up!
"All these stocks which recently got FDA CRL are at a 52-week low, except $SESN, is $SESN heading in the same direction as well?$SPPI, $ARDX, $ETON, $PRVB, $PLX, $ORPH, $MDWD, $ITRM, $FGEN, $CRMD, $ATXI, $ATNX, $ACAD"
"H.C. Wainwright 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference - September 13-15, 2021Eastern Daylight Time"
Before this year end this will be $1+.
Market cap of only 200 million with a drug on the verge of approval.This is a no brainer. Should at least be $1.50 now.
3500 @1.37 holding strong I believe in this company
"Google the following company all received CRL recently, see their wording $ACAD $ARDX $ATNX $ATXI $CRMD $ETON $FGEN $ITRM $MDWD $ORPH $PLX $PRVB $SESN $SPPI"
"Pumpers & bashers we all have the same news: ITRM has a much needed drug that the FDA wants 1 additional clinical trial for a very niche group to approve. That’s it. Depending on how it plays out will determine the outcome. There’s not much more room to go down, but tons of room to move up."
Only thing this company is good for is capital raising and reverse splits.
Last few hours before you become their lead plaintiff mates!
"Be ready to take off, it is possible at any time "
Both SESN and ARDX have dumped 1/3 of their employees. ITRM is probably next.
NEWS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Everything is fine !!!!!! Already met with the FDA!!!!! $1 ???????????
1M shares pre-market. $0.70. Nice plus one.
$1.50 in next 2-3 trading days folks. String Financial Standing with funding to second half of 2023 AND FDA Meeting next month and NO Clinical Studies needed!!!
The FDA should just pass it. It works and they did studies unlike the phony vaccines they just passed.
This thing is splitting pennies on the share price today on light volume?
"This is the best drugs combination in treatment UTI in umpteeth years ,its a block buster product,its matter of time sulopenem will be approved within 6 to 1 year time,just hold guys ,if those have extra cash can buy in surely is x 6 minimum once approved."
Chart says this thing is rigged!
I'm jumping in at the $0.5x Range.
Any expectation on earning EPS ?
What are the odds of ITRM filing bankruptcy or having to settle some of these class action lawsuits?
CB - Ignored. Ahhh. Everything is better!
"Stay bull but be diligent with your hedging strategies for our ITRM.As so, some have been adverse to my analysis to oust the current CEO and Board. Let I support my POV in brief:There is a difference in what the Leadership should have been doing continuously = legally v. shareholder transparency.(1) Legally -- Not required to speak as to any of the current issues re damage control (FDA Letters, delay in 2nd Qtr ER, nor current 'potential' suits)(2) Shareholder Transparency -- Via Corp Governance, they must bona fide communicate to us investors any and all relative and pertinent info re the company, especially info that commits itself to vagueness.Both FDA Letters were vague as explaining to ITRM their corrective actions for its new drug to be ratified to market. Leadership has a fiduciary responsibility to explain out this vagueness to enhance a better understanding of FDA's concerns. E.g.: Labeling, Final 3rd Trial To Patients, ...Common sense dictates that ITRM explains the delays in reporting its 2nd Qtr ER. E.g.: Sorry about delays, we're reviewing numbers for better representation, ...And, the 'potential' suits may be only puff. Who cares much?! However, ITRM need to say as much for the benefit of us, it loyal equity holders. E.g.: We are currently addressing 'potential' legal matters, these are simply puff, under full control, ...To remain mostly silent as to any and all of these three imperative issues is to lend credibility to the adverse threating forces against the company's best interest and the best interest of us shareholders.Inasmuch, ITRM's Leadership has failed its fiduciary corp governance to its loyal equity holders and need be ousted, forthwith!Agreed?!"
.10 cents
"SESN is heading to where ITRM is now, and ADRX will be. Small biopharmas with no product to market, and none in the foreseeable future. All seem to have had problems with management's candor with shareholders, which is the central point the ambulance chasers are using for their class action suits.Happiest scenarios are not approvals, which may well take years, but buyouts, even with lowball offers. We'd all likely lose big, with the only advantage being tax loses."
FDA approval is NOT coming in September. Just stop pumpers. Your bags may be heavy but no need to drag others into your muck. I’m long with 1.24 average. This companies communication skills suck. Good luck.
Director got more shares yesterday after the CRL! that's a positive sign.
"Tomorrow’s Fat Payday Friyay is so green! My pumpernickel DavidNIO said #NIO will be $70 in 7 days! Have you seen him?Did you follow the money and bought #tyme at $1.05? You could be up 8% now, AND “someone” said it will be at least $5 bucks on January 21Still holding #itrm and #otlk? Hang in there, you’ll get your money’s back. You’re holding "
Flatlined at $0.81 today since 10:30 EST.
BREAKING NEWS! The plaintiff deadline passed & no one signed up! JW & CB tried but ultimately dismissed their participation due to their extreme unrelated daddy issues
I'm vibing on this for a few years until fda approval. Don't wah wah in the short term

This will break through $1.00 today in anticipation of the big news tomorrow morning.
Someone knows something about $ITRM Q2 Results ???
"just ignore these lawsuits, does not affect anything. There is a business update on Friday and that's all we need."
I am buying more at this price when market opens up. Thus drug will be approved once those deficiencies are met and stock is well Over 5 $. I can wait for few months for that. This stock will fly.
"Nice and clean presentation by CEO confirming that in co.’s view, currently collected data meet approval requirements for commercialisation. And data themselves, indicate that drug did meet all important endpoints. NOTHING very new was said but basically confirming it was huge surprise when FDA letter was received because earlier, FDA had approved test procedure. MOST IMPORTANTIs FDA meeting within September to find out exactly what was missing with just reported data and of course, what FDA is exactly looking for as complementary data.In other words, FDA will decide how easy next step can be ….. or not."
Anyone still doubting this thing is being manipulated just look at today's graph after 10 o'clock.
"Bruce….these words of yours seem to apply here:Baudax Bio, Inc.Pump all you want Jo, the more you do the more you reveal who you are. This thing will live or die by its sales, not what you or I say about it. Either the sales are there or they aren't. I say they are not. Taking way to long and slow for a drug that is suppose to be so good."
Time to load up ITRM and also this one that can go big!https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/21922151-bioresearch-alert/5642173-cell-medx-files-510k-submission-fda-for-short-path-to-commercialization-of-promising
What is going on? This is jumping !
"Lmao we all took fat Ls to the dome with this investment. I will never invest in biotech again. ITRM is DEAD. Thats why I switched to crypto  (Btc, eth, doge, ada and solana). I am not a financial advisor."
Vulture…
This antibiotic is going to get approved it’s just when…Maybe sooner if ITRM can prove that data was enough to prove superiority against quinolone…Later if FDA somehow asks them to compare to other drug like levofloxacin…..
"It is frustrating to invest in a company that produce no news, public relation non-existence,,,,,CEO doesn't speak at all."

Co has enough money to go through the sh@#t storm.We know that you are doing your utmost to correct situation soonest.Again, keep us informed.Thank you Signed: Ouch, got #$%$ shareholder"
I am feared that Type A meeting request have been refused or else they should have had date of meeting since long…
New quarter and it's all good from here.
I’ll check back in…..in 2022. 
Funny to look back on…..but ya listened to the pumpers anyway. The same clowns that wish to silence me now:Capitalism 3 months agoDownside we go to $1.00. Upside we go to $10.00. I like that Risk/Reward ratio any day.BullishReplies:CB 3 months agoDownside is more like .50 cents but gamble away! 
"Playing otc right now, if this remains low for a couple of months I will buy more. A average of 1.2$ is not to compelling, especially at this prices. Still believe we will be fine, but it probably take longer than we initially anticipated. Good luck to all."
50c
Big volume up. Maybe some big news coming?
.50c coming
Worse than a Chinese stock!
I averaged down at .68 with 3k shares. 7k total. Thinking of flipping those 3k now. What say you?
How long do they have to stay compliant with Nasdaq requirements?
"Maybe the FDA should have been more accommodating with first set of phase 3 results ?It seems that President Clinton had sepsis resulting from UTI infection !!!What about approving the drug with indication to provide extra data. ?With the kind of data provided, such procedure would not be the first time it is enacted"
Another pretty big volume day and it looks like .55 cents is the bottom.
If a judge throws out a class action case on ITRM by any of these law firms there will not be any news release on it.
"The concern here is reverse split.Therefore, all shareholders should join me to ask CEO Fishman to officially take reverse split off the table for at least next 12-15 months. It should strongly assist (most likely be sufficient) bringing co back within NASDAQ $ 1 minimum PPS rules and give breathing room to complete new phase 3 program as per FDA request."
Lol... this stock is going up when you see people are saying to lawsuit it and didn't happen.
"Fishman, where's the buyback announcement? Please. It will rid us of CB here too!"
Are all those lawyers shorting ITRM? Amazing selloff since yesterday.
Future timeline…Class A meeting in : SeptemberThey might take 30 days to provide minutes of the meeting…Base on that ITRM may decide to resubmit NDA If it’s class 1 resubmission then FDA has to answer in 30 daysIf class 2 resubmission then they will take 6 months for answer.If ITRM does not apply for resubmission the. They will be doing other clinical trial and then NDA submission which might take upto year or 2…Please pray that the outcome of meeting is something good to which ITRM can respond on the basis of the data that they have…..
"Hello guys again, i was in itrm before sold at 1.22 little lose. I want to join again. Can anyone please update me on what’s going on now. Did they apply for fda again or any new relate to fda approval?"
Just bought a few shares.I have a feeling better days ahead of us for this bad boy
Lower….
STRANGE its decent news no negative reviews and good cash flow and it dips. This is a long term investment
"With $100mm in cash and no funding needed for 2 years, ITRM will move very quickly back to $1.25+ after bottoming yesterday."
Who knows…..they may sell the whole enchilada on the one yard line and let big pharma carry it into the end zone. $8-12 very possible
"There was 1 clever guy on a whole thread here, whom you disliked asf guys, here are messages he posted:Matt 8 hours agoCRL tomorrow, guessing premarket. No bio has gotten a deficiency letter and then approval in the same review cycle. ITRM isn't going to buck that trend. ITRM and ARDX on tap for CRLs this week.Matt 4 days agoThis is not getting approved this time. Every bio that has gotten this deficiency letter has ended in CRL. ITRM IR Just has responded to many people saying they will share the deficiencies when FDA tells them. How do people expect ITRM to resolve deficiencies they don't even know? CRL practically guaranteed, most likely Monday premarket.Matt 12 days agoCRL coming. Every bio that has gotten this letter has gotten a CRL. On top of that, 13 of 16 bios that had their ADCOM cancelled since 2008 ended in CRL. Writing is on the wall. Smart bio traders know what is coming."
Finances are good.. No more dilution…. Now SP could climb slowly to above 1 to 1.30 until class A meeting.
FDA approval - for sure is coming end of sept.
"Iterum Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ITRM) announced an update on the company's Type A meeting with the U.S. FDA related to the NDA for its sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid (oral sulopenem), and provided an update on its cash position.The NDA for sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid (oral sulopenem) is for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections ((uUTI)).In July, the company had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA requesting additional data to support approval of oral sulopenem for the treatment of adult women with a uUTI.""We had a successful meeting with the FDA and have established various potential paths forward to address the request in the CRL for additional data in support of our NDA,"" CEO Corey Fishman said.""We are currently evaluating the optimal design for an additional Phase 3 uUTI study to be conducted prior to the potential resubmission of the NDA,"" he added.Iterum notes that cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $91.5M at the end of the second quarter of 2021.The company believes that it is well positioned financially to fund its operations into the second half of 2023."
"Man, that was some haircut yesterday. Might get the proverbial ""dead cat"" bounce today back over .70. I don't think ITRM is dead money, at least not yet. But their fate is gonna get determined, albeit slowly, over the next six weeks or thereabouts. As investors, we're gonna have to dissect and parse every word that comes from the FDA and look for clues as to which way the pps is going to go. JMHO, but I see eventual approval with the FDA making ITRM jump through a number of hoops before said approval is actually confirmed. JMHO again, but now is not the time to sell. Be patient and let the story develop over time."
Big institutional buys are happening. That is a good sign.
apparently there's a big news coming tomorrow
We need a little clarity on what it takes to get approval. Stock is cheap.
Anybody know anything today? Or did they forget that they knew something? I know something. Do you?
Class action suit against ITRM. Last one out; turn out the lights
Bottom??? Nope.
Even when the market is recovering (Russel 2000 included) this one remains in red
at what time is the earnings ???
Anticipating a relatively small/short trial to fulfill FDA requirements. Approval in 6-12 months.
"Absolutely no reason to do reverse split and even especially funds raising before new NDA resubmission. Especially after such good data released against 1 established drug.Hey, CEO Fishman , why not make it official and say it loud and clear."
Watch this……
It would be nice to hear SOMETHING ! Hopefully that will happen soon.
"Notice that the potential lawsuit below, submitted today, relays on point to my posting--yesterday.Again, as other Longs, we are not throwing away the company nor our equity within it. We are simply saying that the communication by ITRM's CEO and Board to us is either misleading or recently, missing all together.Complete silence by the company when it should be talking a storm to us to reassure us of it and our investments.I say again, stand by the company and its activities. No doubt.But, ITRM's CEO and Board must go, poste haste!"
"Because ITRM only turned in a part of clinical trial document to show a proof of effectiveness of the ciprofloxacin-resistant population. However, the FDA may require the entire of documents regarding unUTI to compare to another group.In the coming weeks, the entire clinical issue will be discussed with FDA, then the recommended next trial may be not necessary"
Will quickly came back above $1 after unjustified panic sale. CRL was very promising. Need to optimize dose...
"Today was just confirmation that meeting happened which basically was expected,In other words, no bad news.Unfortunately zeros info about suggestion/request by FDA and procedure by co. to meet these suggestions/demands.In other words, no good news.Real good news is that plenty of money still available, but without clarity about what is needed by FDA to reach approval, no bad news is not enough for trend change. Time for management to show their talents."
Looking forward for the FDA to approve. Stock jumps to $12 or company is bought.
Hey CB and other people fighting with each other… please do not ruin this board…The only thing that will help us all win is FDA approval…None of us can do anything on that… even if company releases the news early or late it won’t matter with approval process…
I think it's undervalued. Stock is still worth $1 IMO.
what happened to the fda approval
Shouldn't the company be doing something to address not being delegated to the pink sheets?
What’s up with this class action lawsuit
4 days to earnings
what is the short float for ITRM?
"Personally, I think it's a good entry point to buy - right now :)"
in at .679 looking for a quick 3 to 10% intraday pop!!
"171,000 shares on the bid a minute ago."
CB the real hate you’ve acquired from a select few is impressive
"FDA refusal was completely irresponsible but they rarely make fast turn around. $ 100 M on hands, low market cap and close to be approved drug do generate lots of interest by large pharms."
any target for tomorrow???
Every day some snaky law firm begs for plaintiffs. Multiple times. Sounds desperate. The complaint sounds pretty weak unless they have more
Can someone explain the stock volume increase over the past week?
how many law firms going to chase this ambulance
Clown Boy (CB) at home in his parents basement
"« No bad news » bounce makes sense, but why not yesterday could be that was upgraded by an analyst with “buy” rating and well over $1 PPS.After all, $ 90+M reserve is about $.50 per share and well enough money until 2023."
Strong bid volume with a very tight spread between the bid and ask prices. Sure would be nice to know what is going on.
My anoose is broken
fda meeting 3rd quarter a catalyst
"YAAAAAWN.. I haven’t checked in on this loser for awhile. As I said NOTGING would get passed. And sure you had a nice bumb and zip & dips but in the end here you are. Pumping BS, LMAO, at some point reality must set in. It’s a doooog. I just hope anyone with common sense took their profit when the could! Now it’s destined for a long long sideline and down trend!"
Friday accumulation. It will be up Monday.
Any suggestions if I should buy in now or later ? Price predictions for this stock ? Short or long term ?
Yahoo should start charging for the thunbs down. CB would then have nothing to do here.
"Capitalism, I hope you are right."
FDA and Shorts are one team.
who does earnings on Friday the 13th?
Who bought my 80 cents premarket? Congratulations you are a pro!
something is going to happen soon..I think there's something wich we don't know boiling up about the company. price goes up. what is the reason. I think company has received another response from fda and smart money are loading up
"Americans need this to be approved.. it is inevitable got approval, just don't know how long it will take. I'd say within the next year"
It’s up to you if you want to watch or make money. LOLFollow the Money
Lawyers ought to be suing whoever is controlling the price of this stock! It's not being done electronically!
FDA meeting is set. CONGRATS U ALL
How about some decent news?
whats going on AH ? huge volume with huge rise !!
"Not to forget.FDA meeting to discuss/review fine tuning procedure is 3rd Qtr. or before end of September. However, it also can be within a few days.For sure the sooner they get going with additional testing, the sooner they will complete it. FDA should be well receptive to sooner rather than later, They know that this new drug is really needed."
"Personal Opinion: $ITRM will finish until end of Agost 2021 near to $1,50 per shares and until December 31/2021 near ar $ 4,00 per share."
A new clinical trial will last 12-18 months. I figure end of 2022 we will know if this bounces back to $2.50 and above
Time to buy shorts are all gone. There is only one way up from here
If you believe and need to average down….why in the f do you not hope for .20 cents or .10 cents??? Just let the bottom drop out and Sir Keynesian is right…..this is 9-12 months out before any real news. Buckle up and let er buck!
"At these low prices, how about a 10M share buyback? They would still have sufficient funds to gain approval over the next 3-6 months and it would be a nice reward for loyal shareholders."
What’s happening???
When is the new NDA submission? Are trials on going?
"“Moreover, ITRM currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. This is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential turnaround in the near term.”"
Expect a company update by end of week which will clarify the process
Amazing it sells of to .55 cents every time !
After hours volume huge and reading with about a 13% upside. Sometimes you wonder if it was purposely brought down only to be able to be bought up low. Let’s see if it holds.
Nasdaq deficiency status?? I’d like to know the status on that as well Bruce.
This is going to 10$
News coming within few days. 100 % sure.Either because no news which will be negative news.Or PR about FDA meeting/discussion which was mentioned to be before end of Sept.
Party is over… from 70 cents pre market to 58 in no time.Wonder if it is just dumping shares or shorting
Didn't someone post about two weeks ago that this thing should start to inch up everyday until the Type A meeting?
"Its strange ,yaho saying that earnings after 4days ??!!"
Is CB still here trying to save us from ourselves and teaching us things we don't know. I was going to mute him or her but there is some entertainment value I can't ignore!
I just hope they announce some positive news during the ER call like enough funding to co duct trials or disclose more details of FDA letter or about meeting with FDA
stock is not reacting to the lawsuit.
"Wow, what's happening this morning.? Up big pre market."
"There is not information to go on now. I think the selloff is over done. There is going to be an approval, just a matter of when."
When will this drug get approved?
MAYBE PUMPING but nothing wrong with quick summary Huge potential for entering sweet spot.* FDA letter was surprise* phase 3 data were excellent just not extensive enough* $ 90 +M on hand* very much needed drug* management seems very good and qualified (saying seems because don’t know them)And more ?
Listened to the presentation at HCW. CEO seems pretty confident about the drug getting approved….. I just hope all the odds play out in ITRM favour at TYPE A meeting…. If so all Bag holders at this moment will be rewarded big time….
it can't be good news because it keeps dropping
What’s the price target after meeting with FDA
Everybody should be buying and not selling. The FDA is helping ITRM get the drug approved.
Institutions and insiders sold all their shares. Halting all planned trials. GLTA
LOL these lawsuit actions are desperate. HURRY! Join the lawsuit with (insert firm here). Let’s go on a fishing expedition!!
How we doing today !!
$1.50 post business update tomorrow. FDA Approval is only a few months away folks!!!
CB…What a total
I know where this ride is headed too.....
I agree with CB and Joe. Maybe somebody knows something.
"I did further research on this drug and the approval process. This drug is much needed in the USA and the entire world. I also read the FDA report several times. I’m going to share what I captured and understand :1. This drug is totally developed , but trials and data are not sufficient for the FDA to grant it approval.2. FDA response and recommendations are very normal to protect consumers from any potential concerns in the future3. FDA approved this drug in principle ( from what I sense in the report) but need additional data based off additional trials and dosage data.4. This approval process will proceed. It won’t make any difference if we sell our shares or not. The company have enough money to finance additional dataPlease note the FDA did not use any of the verbiage I’m using in my comments."
$110M market cap. Cheap?
HC Wainwright Analyst will announce and reaffirm Strong Buy recommendation any day now with $2.50 Price Target.
This is a $1.50 stock as we speak folks. Look back at the stocks history. This is still very close to FDA Approval!! Get as many shares as you can. Fire sale ends in just days.
"A lawsuit and 4 buy ratings on this one,,,,is this a JOKE !!!"
Analyst maintains $2.50 Price Target pre-FDA Approval
this week is decisive! Type A meeting with FDA before the end of the week.
"Awesome, now I’m only down $9,875.00. "
"CB, you spend all day every day on this message board? Sad life…you really need to get a life!"
Watch it fizzle out again today
$ITRM When is the meeting date?
Folks load up! This will be $1.50 next week!!
Why are they lowering the share price?
What are the possibilities of a buyout by Pfizer or other big Pharma?
Moving up again. Can we close near 70 cents today??
Funny how vax that has an over abundance of life altering side effects got approved no questions asked and this would help so many elderly but they need more data???
"If you are thinking about playing the bounce, just check out these other bio stocks which also got FDA rejection: $AKBA, $ITRM, $ARDX, $ADVM"
Hope for the best
"Load up , it's trading at it's cash level. And this is the bottom IMO. Drug will be approved."
Meeting went well. Phase 3 suggestions received from FDA. Cash is good through 2023
Any comments about ER?
"What to expect tomorrow? 1 of 2 announcements. Most likely the FDA will announce the CRL. If by some chance ITRM was able to satisfy the labeling issue than scenario 2 would be an FDA approval or rejection. This should put an end to people posting guesses, heres the facts:“A PDUFA date is assigned by the FDA following filing of a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA). Generally, on this date the FDA delivers an approval or rejection of the application (Complete Response Letter (CRL)). Occasionally, applications under “priority review” receive a decision days or weeks before the assigned date.”If they receive a CRL tomorrow I don’t see much further slide because the sell off is mostly baked in. If it does Could be a good opportunity to add if you can be patient for 4 t o 7 months."
I like listening to people who make good calls not horrific misses:Capitalism 3 months agoDownside we go to $1.00. Upside we go to $10.00. I like that Risk/Reward ratio any day.BullishReplies:CB 3 months agoDownside is more like .50 cents but gamble away! 
My advice not to buy till things become clear ???!!!
Average daily volume is 9 million shares. We are 50% over that.
"Instead of all these law firms news stories saying they want to ""remind us"" I think they should all be titled they want to ""plead with us"" to come forward so they have something. With just about all the SEC law firms having filed suit they ARE now desperate to get a plaintiff or two to fulfill their case that they worked so hard on taking boiler plate documents and turning them into a piece of artwork and filed. Note how there were two law firms a few months ago that said they were ""investigating"" and then silence for those few months and then poof everyone shows up trying to be the first one like in a horse race. The first time I saw all of this I was inexperienced and encouraged by all the efforts but quickly learned how rubber stamped these things are. As soon as one gets a lead plaintiff to come forward and they are set and then a judge throws out the case the rest will all run on to the next horror story as they see it and repeat the process. They rarely put in the additional work to file an appeal because they know the chances of success at that point are slim.I am down over $250,000 on this stock and I am not putting much faith in this process ever producing a thing like the last one I was lead plaintiff. Instead, I am trying to remain faithful in believing the company will come through. That is our best chance of recovery. Still, if one of this company's legal darts thrown hits the right spot on the dart board I will sign up for a possible chance of some recovery that will take years to materialize and amount to ten cents on the dollar of losses.I have not sold a single share and remain hopeful. I have no friend who is an employee or someone that knows someone as such and remain out in the field of silence in Tim Buck 2 hoping for the best and still worry about the worst here. Hope all goes well in the future. Institutions are generally smart, but can get caught with their pants down like anyone else and make a mistake. But still I know that a huge amount of the shares outstanding were bought by them at prices considerably higher than it is now. I just hope they knew what they were doing when they did so."
Got my average down to $1.13 today. I've done a lot of research and fully believe this stock will rise to $5 in the next year or so. hodl'ing! ;)
This chart is definitely 1 of the worst ones I've seen. Doesn't look promising.... Good luck everyone I hope u all make money
"The Nasdaq non compliance is well, concerning."
Only thing I am nervous about here is a reverse split.
"Guys, let's stay bull but also be realistic. Rationale =(1) There appeared to be only a labeling issue per Letter by FDA as of last week of June.(2) We now know that it is more than a simple labeling issue as FDA has send second Letter detailing the criteria that needs to performed in retesting of new Final Trial 3 to patients.(3) On none of these issues has ITRM's CEO informed us well in a timely manner for our decision-making.(4) Now, we have this issue of continued delays in presenting its 2nd Qtr Earnings.And, of course once again, ITRM's CEO will not talk to us for timely information.Still believe in the company, FDA approval, and the stock.No longer believe in ITRM's leadership = New immediate leadership is necessary, poste haste!"
ITRM cultists like Capitalism be like:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP_K5czbny4
Easy double from here. Get in now!
This will get pumped to oblivion imo. Hold tight
How long until this stock does a 1:10 reverse split?
"So much garbage by ambulance chasers that real info can no longer be easily found.Therefore quick summary provided by co.2nd qtr ER on Friday Aug 13th, 8.30 AM.Will provide financial data and business update.Not saying it but FDA matter sure to be at forefront of discussion. Please click  to put this info on top of “top reactions”"
Guys if you truly believe in the Sulopenem being approved then there is no need to false pump this stock.There are only to outcome … if it gets approved we all go to moon or else we hold the bag.There is no way pumping this stock will attract more retail to invest crazy in this stock and the SP increases.
Is the earning today ??
"We are all hoping for approval so we can make money. I will be honest and say that I am one of them. However, I am equally rooting for approval so many lives can be improved going forward. UTI infections can lead to serious health issues when not treated effectively. I know this first hand as my wife has struggled for several years. In addition, most antibiotics are made in China and the US is too dependent on this critical supply. We need to develop our own supply for future security. Let’s go ITRM!"
