it's going up because I dumped my 1500 shares yesterday. Your welcome. ffs!!
Very big week ahead here folks. Double.
"While we wait for PR about resubmitting , entire story can be summarized in a few words.Sulopenem data are way pass good/better enough to easily receive FDA approval.Unfortunately management screwed up (big ?) by not having enough of them data to have supported straight approval.Fortunately, it is easy to obtain more data But unfortunately (again) such operation takes time and it cost lots of money.Unfortunately it was/is bad for us, old shareholders.Fortunately great entry opportunity for new investors."
"No evidence of the rationale of our ITRM's rise. But I'll take it.Though the website doesn't state true, I suppose that insiders have intel that ITRM has commence its redo Final State 3 to confirm its additional claims for the new drug as required by FDA. Hope it is true so that we will keep rising per normal.Stay bull with caution!"
40% Jump would match expectations when co releases its plans for extended phase 3 as per FDA suggestions.
"Could we be seeing some nibbling here for possible take over positioning ?After all, co has great pipeline with leading drug that basically did meet its end point but was just data quantity short. Followed by radical market price devastation.Is it not enough for cash rich large pharms to nibble or to start private discussion ?"
ALERT: It appears ITRM just found a cure for the Jets losing! Fans willing to pony up for any relief.
"Who else thinks people who spam message boards trying to get clicks on ""alert-sounds"" and other ""stock picker"" sites deserve to be lined up and shot?"
"Hello CEO FishmanPast couple days have shown that sharks are circling around ITRM small boat.They are right because Sulopenem has huge positive potential.Evidently they are taking advantage of current messed up phase 3 Sulopenem situation. Fortunately, Easy way to fence them of is to keep information flowing with correct and constant development status. Your silence is deafening and devastating to co reputation.Please speak upThank you"
"Let me tell you my story, I was up 120% here back in july and didnt sell, now i am down 50% still not selling let me tell you why. First FDA will aprrove the drug next year, second I did my risk managment and I am ready to accept the swing. They also have a lot of cash on hand and this give me confidence to wait and hold my position. If something happen which I dont like I will instantly sell my position even with the loss, but for now everything is fine. So my recommendation is, or you buy and wait but with good risk managment or just sell and stop investing in this risk stocks. I was watching for months when to enter my position and my cost is arround 1 dollar. Biotech is hard to invest, you can get x10 or lose all. Be smart and give yourself a time."
the FNCMX Fund reported an 5% increase in the amount of shares they own 10-26-21....maybe that's why it spiked up a little....plus two other funds....Fintel
"There is no doubt ,it's novel product(phase III) will get FDA approval.... If you did lil research product came from Pfizer's research lab.....Iterum just bought phase II product & made it to phase III & final FDA reviews. It has effective results so far.... they just need more sample...."
ITRM just posted a job opening on linkedin for a phase III test project manager. hopefully the plan is set and firm
Anyone who is doubting this stock on the long run should just sell it. Ppl need to properly read before they invest. This is going up once the plan is laid out and will probably hit +2 once FDA review date is announced. upon the approval this will definitely spike. you can sell at any point and you will basically make profit
Let’s dance Sabby! You lead with your 7 million shares and I’ll follow like a good battered wifey.
"One more time, guys. ITRM and its stock is a long play for LR Investors. Patience is the game here.All of us know now that the stable point for this long stock is about $.50 #$%$ It's been that way since the last FDA assessment June 2021 and now during ITRM's follow-up therefrom to finally get the new great drug to mkt.Again, don't panic. All needed is a redo new Final Stage 3 with new patients in order to verify the claims for which ITRM states that the drug can enhance. Next Spring 2022 = June - July 2022.Real company, real drug, real stock. Not a meme Millennial stock = AMC, HOOD, NFLX, GME, ...Patience = Stay bull with caution!"
I own it at 2.44 let’s hope good news 
Pretty soon there will be lawsuits for not saying something. You cannot sit on info too long!
"Once more volume comes back in the next sessions, ITRM will pick up the steam."
