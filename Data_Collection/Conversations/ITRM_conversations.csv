Nice volume. Price will follow. Those who know are buying in. Bullish on this.
Time to buy shorts are all gone. There is only one way up from here
This thing is splitting pennies on the share price today on light volume?
To the Moon baby!!!
Brucey…..sold a bag at .64. You? Being a trader allows profit taking. You should listen more. 
Are all those lawyers shorting ITRM? Amazing selloff since yesterday.
Don’t get too excited kids. They just want to not get delisted but who doesn’t want another $3 or just $2.50 eh? LOL
1M shares pre-market. $0.70. Nice plus one.
Pretty soon there will be lawsuits for not saying something. You cannot sit on info too long!
The lookout tower is very active. Load up.
"One that we are waiting for news.Soule CEO Fishman and management not held any responsibility in having phase 3 screwed up with only 1 comparaison drug when now, it came out that more data was needed ?And if yes, should they not come out of their sweet confortable zone and step out some by using the $ 90 M on hand and support current shareholders by removing possibility of reverse split for next 12/15 months. There is plenty of money on hand for this simple step and it would help enormously getting out of the NADAQ « minimum $ 1 PPS » rule hole. Calling on CEO Fishman to officially state loud and clear that R/S is of the table for the next 12/15 months as co has plenty of money on hand until 2023.By then, FDA should have approved the results provided by extended phase 3 or R/S will be the least of our trouble."
"Pumpers & bashers we all have the same news: ITRM has a much needed drug that the FDA wants 1 additional clinical trial for a very niche group to approve. That’s it. Depending on how it plays out will determine the outcome. There’s not much more room to go down, but tons of room to move up."
Anyone who is doubting this stock on the long run should just sell it. Ppl need to properly read before they invest. This is going up once the plan is laid out and will probably hit +2 once FDA review date is announced. upon the approval this will definitely spike. you can sell at any point and you will basically make profit
"I am looking and notthing on the page, there is no news. What is happening? Someone know something?"
Well dangit now I wish I'd bought a lot more shares. I was debating about how much to put in at 54 cents but wound up only getting 20K. If I had thought it would pop so soon I would have bought 100K
BREAKING NEWS! The plaintiff deadline passed & no one signed up! JW & CB tried but ultimately dismissed their participation due to their extreme unrelated daddy issues
"Brucey….got my average down to $1.11. You? I was hoping for closer to a buck, but hey, you think it’s shooting yourself in the foot to want cheap shares. Enjoy your more expensive ones. "
Take a little profit here if you can. I suspect it will drift lower over the next few sessions. just my humble opinion. GLTA
Where are my pumpernickels here? Mark? CB?
Lower….
Just bought a few shares.I have a feeling better days ahead of us for this bad boy
I own it at 2.44 let’s hope good news 
"how is it possible that after having being subject to the classic ""pump and dump"" game, the number of daily shares traded is still way above the daily average ???????Where is CEO Fishman to provide some clarity to the phase 3 extension to stop/control sharks gaming action against co."
What’s happening???
"No evidence of the rationale of our ITRM's rise. But I'll take it.Though the website doesn't state true, I suppose that insiders have intel that ITRM has commence its redo Final State 3 to confirm its additional claims for the new drug as required by FDA. Hope it is true so that we will keep rising per normal.Stay bull with caution!"
Nasdaq deficiency status?? I’d like to know the status on that as well Bruce.
Huge number of shares traded as of 9:55AM. Nearly 11 million.
Is it true they are getting into Covid?
"CB, you spend all day every day on this message board? Sad life…you really need to get a life!"
"There is a Covid related clinical trial study report going around that $ITRM was supposed to conduct. Report indicates that the study has been withdrawn and it does not exist. Not sure if it is a coincidence that this pop happened at the same time it came out, but it’s not real"
34 MILLIONS bought in 3 hours yesterday ....no smoke without fire.
When is the new NDA submission? Are trials on going?
Even when the market is recovering (Russel 2000 included) this one remains in red
Expecting very significant PR FDA related any time now. Stock will double from here imo.
"One more time, guys. ITRM and its stock is a long play for LR Investors. Patience is the game here.All of us know now that the stable point for this long stock is about $.50 #$%$ It's been that way since the last FDA assessment June 2021 and now during ITRM's follow-up therefrom to finally get the new great drug to mkt.Again, don't panic. All needed is a redo new Final Stage 3 with new patients in order to verify the claims for which ITRM states that the drug can enhance. Next Spring 2022 = June - July 2022.Real company, real drug, real stock. Not a meme Millennial stock = AMC, HOOD, NFLX, GME, ...Patience = Stay bull with caution!"
.10 cents
My biggest mistake not selling when it hit 2.5 in Jul 21. Zero profit but get rid of the bag at least. Now dead money till end of 2022 at the very least.
Another big swing up $$$ imminent
Very big week ahead here folks. Double.
Funny how vax that has an over abundance of life altering side effects got approved no questions asked and this would help so many elderly but they need more data???
Moving up again. Can we close near 70 cents today??
Relax and calm
"There is no doubt ,it's novel product(phase III) will get FDA approval.... If you did lil research product came from Pfizer's research lab.....Iterum just bought phase II product & made it to phase III & final FDA reviews. It has effective results so far.... they just need more sample...."
it's going up because I dumped my 1500 shares yesterday. Your welcome. ffs!!
There seems to be a lot of volume for this stock this morning. Maybe I'm missing something.
Load up folks. $1.10+ imminent
Watch it after hours ..
Volume was too high then the average daily volume…. Which means there is something cooking…..There is something that insider is aware about
What’s up with this class action lawsuit
20k shares in the $0.50's - LETS GO !
Perfect setup for tax selling if you do not think this is going anywhere in the next 31 days.
"Saw 30,000 of the 50,000 shares traded this morning on the ask at .53 while the bid was .52. No change in price even though 30,000 traded within a few minutes all on the ask. Then after the 30,000 traded they upped the bid/ask to .53/.55 to make it look like it traded on the bid and weak. In other words, they are playing with it. Traded some after that at .55 and now its back to .523 on light volume."
My expectation we are not too far from the date when we will be happy  pray
"Hey, CEO Fishman, Am with you.This time around, Better take a few days longer and do it completely right.But still, would be nice to hear what’s going on in your Irish neck of the woods."
Was this a classic pump & dump?
so.... why is this going up?
I think it's undervalued. Stock is still worth $1 IMO.
When will this drug get approved?
Strong bid volume with a very tight spread between the bid and ask prices. Sure would be nice to know what is going on.
Everybody should be buying and not selling. The FDA is helping ITRM get the drug approved.
Let’s dance Sabby! You lead with your 7 million shares and I’ll follow like a good battered wifey.
"Market cap now is roughly equal to the cash they have. Yet, it keeps going down. What does that tell you? They have enough cash to do a buyback and could buy make the whole company at this rate. Mean time the whole market is not helping and with it being October may get a lot worse. If there was a time for some good news it is now. I've been waiting for it and it just keeps going down. The good news, if there is any will be this will reverse sharply. But right now it is not looking good. Where is all the institutions cost averaging? That is the real head scratcher. Why aren't they cost averaging when it is this cheap? Worse yet, maybe they have all sold by now? Every penny this goes down my loss increases by $2,000. Its not been an easy decision to just remain holding. Looking for better days ahead through an overall market storm coming is the short version of my post. Where's the buyback announcement even if they do not buy any back? BTW A reverse split by itself is harmless if there are no more shares issued causing dilution. But, at this point no one including me will trust management that they will not issue more shares. You never wait till the last minute to raise cash. We are not there yet, but it will certainly happen long before the 15 months they said they have. WHERE'S THE BUYBACK ANNOUNCEMENT MGMT? Throw us a bone!"
"There is not information to go on now. I think the selloff is over done. There is going to be an approval, just a matter of when."
This is going to 10$
"Who else thinks people who spam message boards trying to get clicks on ""alert-sounds"" and other ""stock picker"" sites deserve to be lined up and shot?"
Well... they did gave you 4 months to load up lol
It’s up to you if you want to watch or make money. LOLFollow the Money
If you believe and need to average down….why in the f do you not hope for .20 cents or .10 cents??? Just let the bottom drop out and Sir Keynesian is right…..this is 9-12 months out before any real news. Buckle up and let er buck!
I am feared that Type A meeting request have been refused or else they should have had date of meeting since long…
"While we wait for PR about resubmitting , entire story can be summarized in a few words.Sulopenem data are way pass good/better enough to easily receive FDA approval.Unfortunately management screwed up (big ?) by not having enough of them data to have supported straight approval.Fortunately, it is easy to obtain more data But unfortunately (again) such operation takes time and it cost lots of money.Unfortunately it was/is bad for us, old shareholders.Fortunately great entry opportunity for new investors."
"The Nasdaq non compliance is well, concerning."
Anyone still doubting this thing is being manipulated just look at today's graph after 10 o'clock.
I am sick of all the spam on yahoo! I actually try to stay off of the ITRM message board now and exclusively use http://the-alphatrader.com/
What is going on? This is jumping !
ALERT: It appears ITRM just found a cure for the Jets losing! Fans willing to pony up for any relief.
"Like what I said boys, institutions sold off just like when it ran up to $2.59.Until next time. My pumpernickels need more training, I apologize for them.Start accumulating at 49 cents all the way down."
"If our speculations were true then this will be better than nvax, ocgn, etc. Too late to buy now for some of you. Most still in the red.I need my pumpernickels yesterday!"
"Could we be seeing some nibbling here for possible take over positioning ?After all, co has great pipeline with leading drug that basically did meet its end point but was just data quantity short. Followed by radical market price devastation.Is it not enough for cash rich large pharms to nibble or to start private discussion ?"
"It’s about to be resubmitted to approval by FDA , that’s all I heard ."
Already traded 6 million shares ! WOW !
Welcome to stocks where Sabby capital management has a stake. 
A new clinical trial will last 12-18 months. I figure end of 2022 we will know if this bounces back to $2.50 and above
After hours volume huge and reading with about a 13% upside. Sometimes you wonder if it was purposely brought down only to be able to be bought up low. Let’s see if it holds.
"Well i am bull but we need more info which will arrive pretty soon. Then we will see where we stand but yea, is time to buy. Inam little bit sad becouse we didnt got a lot of situation but there is presentation we will look at this week. If they dont say much i will be mad, becouse we really need more data."
"Do not scare me with these exposed movements, I will not sell my shares, nor will I buy"
"Hello CEO FishmanPast couple days have shown that sharks are circling around ITRM small boat.They are right because Sulopenem has huge positive potential.Evidently they are taking advantage of current messed up phase 3 Sulopenem situation. Fortunately, Easy way to fence them of is to keep information flowing with correct and constant development status. Your silence is deafening and devastating to co reputation.Please speak upThank you"
Hey CB and other people fighting with each other… please do not ruin this board…The only thing that will help us all win is FDA approval…None of us can do anything on that… even if company releases the news early or late it won’t matter with approval process…
What are the odds of ITRM filing bankruptcy or having to settle some of these class action lawsuits?
Glad I bought another few thou yesterday. Holding
"Too bad, at the end, it looks more and more like it was the classic « pump and dump » involving thinly treaded bio pharm co with great drug potential but stuck in the mud because of FDA regulations and management that screwed up some during phase 3 process. It was fun while it lasted. "
"Instead of all these law firms news stories saying they want to ""remind us"" I think they should all be titled they want to ""plead with us"" to come forward so they have something. With just about all the SEC law firms having filed suit they ARE now desperate to get a plaintiff or two to fulfill their case that they worked so hard on taking boiler plate documents and turning them into a piece of artwork and filed. Note how there were two law firms a few months ago that said they were ""investigating"" and then silence for those few months and then poof everyone shows up trying to be the first one like in a horse race. The first time I saw all of this I was inexperienced and encouraged by all the efforts but quickly learned how rubber stamped these things are. As soon as one gets a lead plaintiff to come forward and they are set and then a judge throws out the case the rest will all run on to the next horror story as they see it and repeat the process. They rarely put in the additional work to file an appeal because they know the chances of success at that point are slim.I am down over $250,000 on this stock and I am not putting much faith in this process ever producing a thing like the last one I was lead plaintiff. Instead, I am trying to remain faithful in believing the company will come through. That is our best chance of recovery. Still, if one of this company's legal darts thrown hits the right spot on the dart board I will sign up for a possible chance of some recovery that will take years to materialize and amount to ten cents on the dollar of losses.I have not sold a single share and remain hopeful. I have no friend who is an employee or someone that knows someone as such and remain out in the field of silence in Tim Buck 2 hoping for the best and still worry about the worst here. Hope all goes well in the future. Institutions are generally smart, but can get caught with their pants down like anyone else and make a mistake. But still I know that a huge amount of the shares outstanding were bought by them at prices considerably higher than it is now. I just hope they knew what they were doing when they did so."
How does this company survive any longer? Their balance sheet looks like they should be going BK any minute?
This happens when a stock even tanks lower
“POP”️
Come on Sabby?..use those 7m plus shares and let?s get this into the .40s. Ya shook it up now let?s really shake it up you pri#$%$%s! ???
"Fishman, where's the buyback announcement? Please. It will rid us of CB here too!"
Institutions and insiders sold all their shares. Halting all planned trials. GLTA
"So much looking for CEO Fishman to provide some clarity about what happened earlier in the week. Most likely was pump and dump, was it ? And what is being done to prevent it to happen again and again ?"
I don't think that ITRM has another 10% in gains in it. Looks pretty bad here. I actually found http://alert-sounds.com/ the other day and their stocks are way better...
OMG whats going on !!!
"Was the increase in number of shares traded over the past week due to the lawsuit, or lack thereof, of a lawsuit?"
MAYBE PUMPING but nothing wrong with quick summary Huge potential for entering sweet spot.* FDA letter was surprise* phase 3 data were excellent just not extensive enough* $ 90 +M on hand* very much needed drug* management seems very good and qualified (saying seems because don’t know them)And more ?
Big D…..buying a few thousand more today??? 
"Pump dump, retail gets hosed, SeC does nothing. Story repeats"
this week is decisive! Type A meeting with FDA before the end of the week.
"This is dead. See it go around in the range of 50-55. Yeah it's done. It's never going to move, sell and move on to the next. This company has no hope except a miracle. Miracle don't happen if you got no connection. LOL"
"Once more volume comes back in the next sessions, ITRM will pick up the steam."
Bottom??? Nope.
"Absolutely no reason to do reverse split and even especially funds raising before new NDA resubmission. Especially after such good data released against 1 established drug.Hey, CEO Fishman , why not make it official and say it loud and clear."
Is CB still here trying to save us from ourselves and teaching us things we don't know. I was going to mute him or her but there is some entertainment value I can't ignore!
10/1….60 cents to 52.
"Sh#@Classic pump and dump,Makes little difference to my holdings because didn’t sell nor acquired any yesterday,BUT REAL DISAPPOINTING, it was so much fun this 40% increase."
Been so long waiting I forgot what they last told us. Have they disclosed what the FDA wants?
I like listening to people who make good calls not horrific misses:Capitalism 3 months agoDownside we go to $1.00. Upside we go to $10.00. I like that Risk/Reward ratio any day.BullishReplies:CB 3 months agoDownside is more like .50 cents but gamble away! 
I'm vibing on this for a few years until fda approval. Don't wah wah in the short term
Listened to the presentation at HCW. CEO seems pretty confident about the drug getting approved….. I just hope all the odds play out in ITRM favour at TYPE A meeting…. If so all Bag holders at this moment will be rewarded big time….
"Nice and clean presentation by CEO confirming that in co.’s view, currently collected data meet approval requirements for commercialisation. And data themselves, indicate that drug did meet all important endpoints. NOTHING very new was said but basically confirming it was huge surprise when FDA letter was received because earlier, FDA had approved test procedure. MOST IMPORTANTIs FDA meeting within September to find out exactly what was missing with just reported data and of course, what FDA is exactly looking for as complementary data.In other words, FDA will decide how easy next step can be ….. or not."
"Iterum Therapeutics (NASDAQ:ITRM) announced an update on the company's Type A meeting with the U.S. FDA related to the NDA for its sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid (oral sulopenem), and provided an update on its cash position.The NDA for sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid (oral sulopenem) is for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections ((uUTI)).In July, the company had received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA requesting additional data to support approval of oral sulopenem for the treatment of adult women with a uUTI.""We had a successful meeting with the FDA and have established various potential paths forward to address the request in the CRL for additional data in support of our NDA,"" CEO Corey Fishman said.""We are currently evaluating the optimal design for an additional Phase 3 uUTI study to be conducted prior to the potential resubmission of the NDA,"" he added.Iterum notes that cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $91.5M at the end of the second quarter of 2021.The company believes that it is well positioned financially to fund its operations into the second half of 2023."
"Doubt this is going anywhere until there is some positive news. Until then it looks like they will keep it in check. On the other hand, doubt it will go much lower as the market cap is close to the cash that obviously is decreasing over time. This thing needs some positive news in the worst way.One way to do it is for someone to connect with one of the law firms and ask to be kept informed. Better yet, a call weekly should do it. I may start doing it. All it takes is for one judge to throw out a class action case and they will all go away at once. Just like the patches of boxelder bugs on my house if I hit them with a 110 mph blower instantly gone! But, five minutes later they are all back again in the same formation. Unlike the bugs, the attorneys will move on to other cases and let this one go then because no one wants to invest the time on an appeal."
"Today was just confirmation that meeting happened which basically was expected,In other words, no bad news.Unfortunately zeros info about suggestion/request by FDA and procedure by co. to meet these suggestions/demands.In other words, no good news.Real good news is that plenty of money still available, but without clarity about what is needed by FDA to reach approval, no bad news is not enough for trend change. Time for management to show their talents."
The door still open for the short to close there positions before take off 
"Personally, I think it's a good entry point to buy - right now :)"
"Yesterday there was around 5 M shortToday only 4 MSeems they understand the direction of this share is up ,what do you think guys ?"
"The concern here is reverse split.Therefore, all shareholders should join me to ask CEO Fishman to officially take reverse split off the table for at least next 12-15 months. It should strongly assist (most likely be sufficient) bringing co back within NASDAQ $ 1 minimum PPS rules and give breathing room to complete new phase 3 program as per FDA request."
Plan to triple shares when it hits $0.55 and ride it out.
We need a little clarity on what it takes to get approval. Stock is cheap.
"Plenty of news to come, and soonTo get some today would not be a huge surprise. either way, very much looking forward to hear more"
"H.C. Wainwright 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference - September 13-15, 2021Eastern Daylight Time"
"ADTX = MC 32 m--Covid Pill PHASE 3 data THIS MONTH =Next 10 bagger bomb(ADTX)$1.58 --MEGA Covid PILL Phase 3 data within days/ under radar stock= 1000%++ Upsidee""Phase 3 clinical trial of Avigan/Reeqonus for treatment of COVID-19 completed enrollment of more than 1,200 patients in the U.S., Mexico and Brazil with topline results expected within 45 days""###"
It looks like this stock is picking up the steam after I sold today at .65I’m not sure why. I was 20% higher of what left fromMy shares after loosing 6k after it went down due to no FDA approval couple months ago. I can’t trust this entire process any more. Time to move on.
the FNCMX Fund reported an 5% increase in the amount of shares they own 10-26-21....maybe that's why it spiked up a little....plus two other funds....Fintel
Anticipating a relatively small/short trial to fulfill FDA requirements. Approval in 6-12 months.
Can someone explain the stock volume increase over the past week?
Anybody know anything today? Or did they forget that they knew something? I know something. Do you?
40% Jump would match expectations when co releases its plans for extended phase 3 as per FDA suggestions.
"Let me tell you my story, I was up 120% here back in july and didnt sell, now i am down 50% still not selling let me tell you why. First FDA will aprrove the drug next year, second I did my risk managment and I am ready to accept the swing. They also have a lot of cash on hand and this give me confidence to wait and hold my position. If something happen which I dont like I will instantly sell my position even with the loss, but for now everything is fine. So my recommendation is, or you buy and wait but with good risk managment or just sell and stop investing in this risk stocks. I was watching for months when to enter my position and my cost is arround 1 dollar. Biotech is hard to invest, you can get x10 or lose all. Be smart and give yourself a time."
in at .679 looking for a quick 3 to 10% intraday pop!!
Only thing I am nervous about here is a reverse split.
I’ll check back in…..in 2022. 
I agree with CB and Joe. Maybe somebody knows something.
https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT05026801They are doing a new trial on COVID
"When I look at the headlines for ITRM on Yahoo, most of them (Actually the majority of them.) are all about deadlines for filing class action lawsuits. Hate to see a small biotech laden with big legal fees. True, most of these class action lawsuits only make the lawyers rich, but fair or not, a company is forced to defend itself whether they like it or not. Dunno what's gonna happen. Have a feeling the pps is gonna drop below fifty-cents, and that ain't good."
"Bruce….these words of yours seem to apply here:Baudax Bio, Inc.Pump all you want Jo, the more you do the more you reveal who you are. This thing will live or die by its sales, not what you or I say about it. Either the sales are there or they aren't. I say they are not. Taking way to long and slow for a drug that is suppose to be so good."
(ADTX) $1.56--BIG PHASE 3 data NEXT week =1000% ++opp
Big volume up. Maybe some big news coming?
"Do not sell for small profit, be patient for decent reward."
AH will be interesting. :-)
"Yup, like what I said earlier. See you at 49 cents and lower"
another 10% down for today?
They pumped it in hoping people would let go. It's going to 55 then next year boom back to $1
"Maybe the FDA should have been more accommodating with first set of phase 3 results ?It seems that President Clinton had sepsis resulting from UTI infection !!!What about approving the drug with indication to provide extra data. ?With the kind of data provided, such procedure would not be the first time it is enacted"
"Back to normal, someone with deep pockets just moved this to turn around a quick 20%, no news anywhere"
If a judge throws out a class action case on ITRM by any of these law firms there will not be any news release on it.
"This drug failed to prove statistical significance on all phase 3 trials. I told u before it would never get approved based on the fact the FDA simply will never approve a drug that failed all trials submitted. That said, Mgmt data mines those failed trials and found some relevant success. I’m sure they knew chances of approval were very slim based on data mining and that a new trial would be required which is powered properly to prove out the data mined subset. All that said, I do believe this new trial will be successful and they will eventually get approval. I’ve bought back at this level as I do believe they have a valuable drug and share price will improve slowly from this bottom. Can’t deny though that Mgmt made a definite tactical error in submitting failed trials thinking they could get the FDA to approve."
What's going on? maybe insiders know something coming up?
thats a breakout with new comming shortly this will skyrocket when it comes
Meeting went well. Phase 3 suggestions received from FDA. Cash is good through 2023
Watch this……
CB - Ignored. Ahhh. Everything is better!
2K shares @2.25. still holding. any hope here?
Got my average down to $1.13 today. I've done a lot of research and fully believe this stock will rise to $5 in the next year or so. hodl'ing! ;)
Love me a good pump n dump!! This stock is for real tho. Trust me. I’m a poster on a public forum why wouldn’t you
"« No bad news » bounce makes sense, but why not yesterday could be that was upgraded by an analyst with “buy” rating and well over $1 PPS.After all, $ 90+M reserve is about $.50 per share and well enough money until 2023."
couldn't find an answer for the jump in the comments here
Party is OVER! Turn off the lights.
Amazing it sells of to .55 cents every time !
The only thing i need from this stock right now is those lawsuit news to stop.
There are few bad Short's who like to fool other ppl to gain profit.....always posting negative comments to lower the price .....Don't listen those looser ....do your own DD and play with this stock.... I see good return in this stock.....just buy & forget .....It will rise
My advice not to buy till things become clear ???!!!
whats going on AH ? huge volume with huge rise !!
Every day some snaky law firm begs for plaintiffs. Multiple times. Sounds desperate. The complaint sounds pretty weak unless they have more
Is their investors meeting over? Their site indicated 26 Oct but I don't see any news
"Playing otc right now, if this remains low for a couple of months I will buy more. A average of 1.2$ is not to compelling, especially at this prices. Still believe we will be fine, but it probably take longer than we initially anticipated. Good luck to all."
"Every day pass by in this market proves to me that there is some relation between those who sell short and those responsible for the company and the movement of the share Yo or down , do you think am right !"
"Wow, what's happening this morning.? Up big pre market."
Average daily volume is 9 million shares. We are 50% over that.
.55 at open tomorrow
This dip to almost the 52 week low is awesome. How’s that Brucey? Have a good weekend.
