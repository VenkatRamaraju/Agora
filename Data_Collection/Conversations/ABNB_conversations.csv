The slump was over fast!
Not huge but added another 15 shares on dip .
Is this the best travel/accommodation company out there? It sure is the most innovative and probably has the best talents as employees. I think this lull caused by covid has given us a very good entry point for investors.
goodabnb higher on high volume
gap filling today I think
Did the asylum give Grant's internet usage rights back? I still haven't seen any posts from him. How about his ABNB voodoo doll with pins in it? Guess that would be a danger to him and his fellow inmates.
Any news?
I'm looking for this to go to $282 in the next year once COVID fears subside. The growth potential on this is insane.
Price Target between $190 (JMP Securities) - $200 (Needham).
"From Expedias Earnings Report:""Expedia’s rival to Airbnb Inc., Vrbo, helped the company weather the pandemic as travelers, particularly in the U.S., sought regional vacations and remote work getaways. While the company doesn’t disclose Vrbo metrics, Kern said Expedia “benefited from strong vacation rental performance” in the quarter.""This is bullish for ABNBs business, which is almost entirely vacation rentals."
"I have decided against using Airbnd due to their cancellation policies. Covid has really brought this to the forefront. The customer, meaning renter, will find better deals, with better options with other travel, hotel, booking sites. When you don't put customers first, you will lose business over time. ABND stock has peaked and growth will slow."
This was a strong move today!! Congrats to anyone that added on that pullback last night!! I was one of them
All I know is I track airbnb rentals at popular spots near me and prices are up and inventory is very low. I expect a blowout qtr with strong guidance. It's by far my largest position and I'll probably shuffle some more in before earnings. gl.
$WIMI $ABNB $TLRY I’m never selling. Future dividends will pay for all my kids college.
ABNB was UPGRADED today - why the drop??
"I get the idea of this a 'hot' and the future - I just don't see the profitability... I might sink $500-600 - pick up a few shares, but not going over $2k in here..."
CV19 fears kept lid on the FOMO into ER. 2021 stock performance 17% lower than the market YTD. Yes we are optimistic but many still cautious(price action being the tell). To me that is much better setup than overhyped. GLTA
Congrats ABNB long!
Isn't it funny how it looked so grim after the earnings report and all of a suddenWE ARE UP!
This stock should be $1500 a share.
I personally think $ABNB will beat expectations for Q2 and raise guidence for Q3 whether this will reflect in the share price tomorrow we shall see regardless AirBnb is a fantastic stock that will continue to expand and crush it for the next 5 years +
Are we in the non-profit category? What is the financial impact on free stays?
US Housing and Urban Development to streamline emergency housing by contracting out with ABNB... worth Billions upon Billions $$$$$$

"Everyone gets a abnb nobody buys a hotel , why get a hotel room when you can get a abnb full house for the same price . Or pay a little extra and get a place with a pool or hot tub. It’s a no brainer."

"hedge-funds that specialize selling options manipulate the tape after hours, but what the do is a GAME STOP shillwhere these funds shorted GAME to $4 , that is called a bear raid, but it is a play with optionsAirbnb cannot be contained is it a huge fantastic NETWORK <<< networks are the best exponential companies i find ABNB better that Facebook - much better"
lol boom. who remembers boom.
Going to massively beat the estimates
This ABNB stock is a buy! Don’t trust the AH
7.5 MILLION ACTIVE LISTINGS - WOW
Can't wait to buy in at 140!
Added 110 shares in AH. This will rebound fast.
A good reputation for a socially conscious company is probably worth plenty to potential investors
I believe we hit the short term lows after hours and continue to go higher tomorrow.
BC was smart to do the PR announcement of free housing. But the real message in today’s note was booking numbers are back up to pre pandemic and with vaccine authorization this will only get better. Also he pointed That more ppl r seeking unique houses to rent which have much more margins. With Labor Day travels coming Abnb is stock to ride.

"C'mon, let's break 160 today, I want to see @grant lose his mind."
The business of ABNB is changing ! New piece of the market !!! Remember …. The revenues will surprise you !!
after earnings it will be a quick move to $200
With the LONG-TERM strategy the future is yours!
Another bubble....
so this goes to $152 on earnings and tanks to low $140s.. some free housing at it goes to $158+.. This market is inefficient
Rule #1 here for newcomers: Mute Grant and thank me later
"mostly sellers of calls do this - tomorrow we shall see how they fair, i bet not as well heheheh"
Soo we have homeless flooding our nations streets and many US citizens living in poverty and the mummy/hyena admin will bend over backwards for refugees and illegals. We should take care of Americans first!
185$ new target !!
"Grant, did you short more ABNB shares? Good luck to you!"
$ABNB heading up? Anyone? I'm expecting huge numbers just like $OPEN. $200+ later this year? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller?
"Underperform, Sell to now Hold, Buy, Outperform lol analysts"
fantastic initiative by Airbnb to provide shelter for Afghan refugees. very impressed with the company.
"Latest $ABNB price targets:•Brian Fitzgerald (Wells Fargo) price target $210 4 days ago • Colin Sebastian ranked 70th out of over 7,500 analysts - $200 price target within 12 months 5 days ago I think these are conservative too!"
"Quick note to the gents here expecting a bad ER: Shorties, just cover, and move on !"

Bought some calls ...let's go!!
Best marketing strategy
World is starting to reopen Airbnb earnings will go up including airbnb 200 .
told you all it would be green :)
"I host two house in Airbnb and it had been the best year ever. I dont know how many more nights the need to rent to have a good earnings season, but I have not anymore night to rents is my part."
I’m expecting good things and seems like a great time to buy
Let’s just break and hold $150 today! $ABNB

This should NOT be tanking on such a nice revenue and profit in 2Q earnings.
"Interesting, there are tens of thousands of homeless people in ABNB’s home state of California, but ABNB never helped their own countrymen who are homeless but instead the Afghans. I see this as being used as another excuse for ABnB not to make money. This is one of the reasons why Brian tried to delay the IPO for as long as possible because they never made profit and he doesn’t want to answer the hard questions. He is using this opportunity as another excuse to doge profitability questions while making himself look good at the same time. Keep in mind that ABnB “is” one of the big reasons that cause homelessness to soar in California. With so many people buying up properties and renting out like a hotel room, causing prices to soar and pushing out ordinary folks and pricing them out of the home buying market. Haven’t you noticed that the homeless problem skyrocketed after ABNB was created? While I applaud his gesture to help the Afghans, I believe that should be more of a responsibility of the government. I see him using his to make himself look good while not addressing the homeless problem that his company created."
Blow out earnings coming. You cannot stop people from traveling their well being is just as important as their lives. At least for me it is.
"Airbnb shares fell 4% after the travel company issued a warning about volatility due to the COVID delta variant.So, in spite of beating earnings expectations they are pessimistic days after borders reopened for non-essential US travel to Canada… This is a buying opportunity as two doses of vaccine provide a 100% protection against severe outcomes. Note theres only a 36% protection against infection with two-doses but its the outcome that matters. Soon enough we will see a booster shot."
"The funny thing is,is that now that the FDA has approved the Pfizer vaccine it is very bullish for travel leaders like Airbnb.One day Abnb will have a market capital valuation of 1 trillion dollars."
This is headed to 130's to last week's level.
I am raising target from $200 to $250 with strong buy call !!
"Since start of pandemic the only vacations my family took were via ABNB. They are safer for stay, meals and fun with family and friends as compared to hotels. During pandemic business will do well and even better post pandemic. It has a global footprint. Will never sell."
"A red day. A big, red day"
"I think there is a real risk for this stock going below 130 because of the delta variant, but it'll be a good value when covid is under control again"
"The Company is Giving a HUGE GIFT TO HUMANITY with The Free Housing for Afghan Refugee's. I've never Rented out a Property through The Company. However, after hearing The News this Morning about The Company Stepping Up to Do Good for Those in Need is a Great Thing. If I find myself needing a Vacation Rental I will look at Air B&B 1st and Use The Service.That's Corporate Responsibility Giving Back to Those in Need to The Highest Level that I have Ever Seen. AMAZING!!"
CANADIAN POLITICS -- As with many jurisdictions Canada is dealing with a housing affordability crisis. STRs have been identified as a driving force of the crisis. In the Canadian election politicians are vowing to rein-in STRs to negate their negative impact on the housing sector. Canada is not the only jurisdiction wrestling with this colossal problem.
There is no doubt that this will be a $300-$400.00 some day soon…
Beat on every metrics. Revenue on Q3 will break record. Shares pull back after market due cautious warning on delta variant. Buy on the dip.
"Fund led by PayPal, Airbnb backer Kevin Hartz targets $250"

Why is this stock down ?
Bullish chart ! Jumping in !!!
my Nvidia investment is up 50% since January. 
the crowd sold to collect but they will have to chase - and chase a lot - i just bought a mother load
thumbs up if you think this ends in green
"Every time the volume picked up a little , abnb got dumped next day. Last 2 months"
$160 tomorrow
Red to green coming ?
Initiated a small position in this stock today near the lows. Earnings (losses) to be reported August 12th.Will keep the position but may add if things are improving.
"ER for ABNB will come in less than two weeks. I believe ABNB will have a couple of good quarters so its stock will get to a ATH by 2021 end of year. If it is able to get to its ATH, it will then power thru in 2022, if the variant is under control here and around the world. Thoughts. God Bless and stay well."
"I bought one PUT before close to to hedge in case people freaked and started selling. So, tomorrow if we are still down 5+ points, I will take my 100% profit in my PUT and then buy a CALL because as soon as the DELTA slows up, next quarter and beyond will be FANTASTIC !."
Not sure the guidance was needed really? I guess a hedge in case delta spikes… hope this settles into a green pre market tomorrow
Load up or wait ?
"One way to distribute wealth is to rent out those ABNB units then the landlords are screwed later for non payment. If I was a landlord, I'll pull my unit from ABNB."

Crushed Q2 estimates but expect slowdown Q3 due to Delta.
"Red to green, here we go !"
$130 in a year . Firm on my prediction
"No matter what all shorties say, ABNB up and up"
Earnings will be a blast
You’re telling me Doordash is doing better than ABNB? Kidding me!
"Before people start bad mouthing what ABNB is doing, lets keep in a mind A TON of these refugees WORKED FOR THE US during the last 20 years. Translators, Service Staff, Drivers, Infrastructure workers. These people aren't coming here to sit around and do nothing. They are going to be producers and we owe them."
Pre market was up $2 and now down. Lol unreal
"$200 around the corner, great leadership, ABNB good pr! Let’s roll"
"BA er, confirmed travel rebounds, reopening recovery. See how abnb reacts, and insiders"
someone asked when earnings was. says 8/12 on schwab. just answering the question.
ABNB housing the refugees will influence the supply & demand. Good on the numbers in the next quarter.
Stock will jump 10% on earnings.
Invest in companies you think will generate future returns and sell them when that changes. Airbnb will make more money in the future than today.
Abnb blew away estimates buttttt they always have to throw that out to keep the stock from soaring!! Loll I’m not worried. A few years from now this stock will be 300-400
"the +10% jump in 1 day,was a bear trap!"
"Last wave of upgrade to 170$ leading to sell off to 130$, target 180$ actually capped the recovery hope. Go long term."

Next stop $200+?? :D
Added 400 shares on the drop!!! Incredible earnings report!!! Long term outlook is Top 3 company to own in the future
I can see price going to 400$ easy
They tried to take us down this morning... we prevail
Large Cap inflow after that $150 hurtle!
Soon 172$!
Isn’t this product better for skirting around covid though ? Decentralizing how many people can lodge and come in contact with each other ? This willBe just fine
Very nice day. After hours yesterday didn't seem right. I can see 200 by next spring then we stay in the 200s
"Ad , ad !! This company revenues are huge !!"
Can’t wait to buy tomorrow. Free money coming my way

"Wow. Strong move today for ABNB. Will it revisit its ATH and blow past it by the end of the year? If vaccine adoption percentages go higher now that there is full approval for use of PFE vaccine and MRNA vaccine gets the same approval soon with both vaccines affording protection from the Delta variant, it is definitely possible. As the world gets vaccinated, confidence will grow and travel will get a major spurt and ABNB will benefit globally like no other lodging or travel stock. The brand platform is global and as demand increases in a particular region, supply follows without much capital outlay, even in the face of the pandemic. When people avoid cities and opt for open spaces, ABNB platform allows hosts to sign on as they see demand and decide if they want to particpate. Thoughts. God Bless and stay well."
"Will ABNB bringeth, or will ABNB taketh away?"
"Rolled a put again, now shorting Oct 15 $160p. Rolling it since $140 !"
free to stay is best best marketing worldwide
$130 coming again!
"HOA's in desirable neighborhoods don't allow short term rentals, it cheapens the values and brings inrif raff."
this over $150 for free housing? LOL nice but
Waiting for ABNB to announce they will have a co-branded rewards credit card. Then take off !.
Guys news os mostly vaccine related plus some study said 18 states are trending back down on delta. A lot of travel stocks are up.
Any word from ABNB about the homeless American Vets that fought in the Afgan war?
"Abnb will be over $1,000 dollars one day.It will probably be over $2,000 actually."
its either 130 or 170 after the close. flip a coin...
Wooow making such a great PR and business initiative... good for Airbnb
"Two friends, my wife & I just recovered from covid this Monday and all I can say is that all of us got mild symptoms although the two women a little worst than the men. The good thing is that nobody else in our family or friends, that we interacted with, got infected. My point is people will soon realize that and won’t be afraid to travel."
Very close to adding today prior to earnings. Glad I didn't. But will add at some point going forward.
How does giving out housing for free help?
Wells Fargo raises price target to $210!!
"I like buying stocks where I actually use the product ie Visa, Google, Nvidia ect. Average is in around 140, however I have a real feeling this is going to take off. Took two trips over the last month and both times there was not much available and prices were pretty high. Usually I like going for a weekend plus a extra day or two, but this time to save a few bucks I booked for Sun-Thursday. Once we get back to normal, and costs come back to a reasonable level I could see 10-12 billion in revenue a year at 20% margins starting in mid 2023."
"As long as rich 1% decide our destiny there is always poverty ,homeless ,living paycheck to paycheckThey did in Vietnam,Iraq,Afghnistan and list goes on and on .Who paid for their mistake US taxpayers Lets hope our children's will have better leadership."
"In reference to the Motley Fool article today on key metric to watch----Unearned fees(advanced bookings not yet experienced) grew by 43% in Q1 21'---a key metric/sign of fwd confidence ahead by guests.Since then-->USA vaccinations are >3x higher than they were then>Europe vaccinations are 5x higher and now ahead of USWhat might unearned fees be in Q2?.. Q2 is seasonally the highest in unearned fees. This should be THE foundation of any change in fwd guidance which we all agree is ""what matters""."
I used their service a few times this summer and so as my friends. I think their earnings will be good.
And it's green...
Buying opportunity of a lifetime. Making money during Covid.
Travel restriction to Europe may slow down ABNB in the 3Q and 4Q.. So the stock price may drop some
I miss the times when numbers actually mattered...
Airbnb is up 4.90% to 153.99
"longs dont sweat it, the dumping is a combo of short term traders taking profits together with sellers of callsnothing to worry just keep your loot or add more like I am doing.They will have to cover and sellers will chase and chase they will and a lotafter hours is very volatile it is not a true market - understand this , and don't dare sale your gold nuggets"
i think you canbet 50 50 covid delta may not be so bad if so you buyjng this at a discount...we know business is going to be and its selling lower
Q3 earnings will be huge
Pretty sure we are looking at a beat and raise here.
$180 is still the objective
I can’t wait for earnings to come out and this stock go up as it should… so this guy Grant will crawl back into his bed at his moms house.
"After Airbnb has driven rents into the stratosphere and created homelessness everywhere, SuperGuru Chesky now pulls a PR stunt taking in refugees and this will make it all better. Curious!"
Can’t wait for ER!
Do we break 150 for good before earnings ?
Let’s add a couple zeros to the stock price.
300$ per share within 6 month max
300 coming soon
Why the big move?
"Balls deep in it, selling other puts today, going straight to $180"
Setting up a move higher!!

"Basically, Airbnb Thinks I’m a Liar for my ClaimsPosted on August 9, 2021I reserved an RV that was shown to be self-contained for a two-week stay while I was between homes. When I arrived to check in, I found the following: the couch pictured in the posting had been removed; the bathroom pictured in the posting had no water (no sink or shower), and the toilet contained dry brown material that emitted a foul odor; the kitchen faucet had no running water; the kitchen stove was not supplied with propane and did not function.The property manager stated she was aware there was no working shower or toilet, and there is no propane connection for the stove. She went to the main house briefly to ask about the water in general, and confirmed there is no running water. The host was not present, but I contacted her immediately to inform her that none of the advertised amenities were working, and I requested a full refund. She responded “the amenities work”, said I would not receive a refund, and “god bless”.I contacted Airbnb, and spent two weeks back and forth with “ambassadors”, and at the end of it all was told I didn’t request the refund quickly enough, and since I had no video evidence to prove the amenities don’t work, they will not issue a refund. Then said “have a lovely day”. I have repeatedly asked to have my case sent to a supervisor, and they just move it on to the next “ambassador”. I’m out over $400."
The initial reaction to the numbers is where it should be trading $155+++ any smart investor would add on this drop. It’s a gift
"Not sure i follow why folks are selling. Abnb beat revenue, eps, gross booking, and adjusted EBITDA. am i missing something here?"
"One of the class action lawsuits against ABNB from the Netherlands has 1,000,000 participants. If they are entitled to a modest $3,000 each that is a $3,000,000,000 liability from just one of the thousands of legal actions against Airbnb."
Thumbs up if Abnb is undervalued. Thumbs down if Abnb is overvalued.
Strong resistance around 160. Next it has to break to 180 otherwise retreat to 130
"If it will make it go up another $14.00, give out 20k more rentals. Not in my house though"
$50 is max value of this.
CoVID negatively impacts almost every publicly traded company. It should be built into price already and not used as a possible negative for Q3. ABNB expects a blowout Q3 and that's it. To the moon!
Sold all but one share…. I’ll buy back at 149.00 or less for free shares of Airbnb…
Grant was just placed back into the asylum with no access to internet. That is the real reason he is so quiet
Best marketing strategy in the last 5 years. Inexpensive too.

Living in Arizona I can tell you people don't care about Delta and are coming here constantly. They just rent a house and use the pool for a week then in the winter come here to escape the cold
Im really glad the 3 HOAs I'm a member of don't allow short term rentals.
Float has increased from 90M to 155M to 250M as insider shares unlocked. Thankfully institutions been piling in to absorb it all. It creates less volatility but will also take some patience.
going in green $160+
I just add another 50 more shares. $160 next week
"The shorts are killing me, ROFL !. I own ABNB and GE and the shorts on these two boards keep saying over and over how the stocks will crash. And, it never happens."
What a joke. Giving housing to 20k Arabs who won’t defend their own country. What about our homeless vets who did man up to defend our country? so many who defended us from the Muslim al-Qaeda live on the streets and we give these people housing?
"You would think hosting Afghan refugees would be good for PR, and the stock would jump! Not drop 5% "

"Travel is WAY UP. Don't be fooled, ABNB is doing GREAT !."
Back to $160 soon
This will open around negative 3 points but finish +2% tomorrow. Can’t wait to add more at opening bell

"breaking:Airbnb price target raised to $210 from $200 at Wells FargoAirbnb price target raised to $200 from $194 at NeedhamWells Fargo analyst Brian Fitzgerald raised the firm's price target on Airbnb to $210 from $200 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. Airbnb reported strong Q2 results, with continued momentum for long-term stays and nonurban markets complemented by rebounding demand for shorter, urban, and cross-border stays, Fitzgerald tells investors in a research note. He continues to expect that the post-COVID travel landscape will be one characterized by greater work flexibility and longer stays, and that Airbnb remains best positioned to serve emerging demand trends given its network effects and its ability to draw both pro property managers and individual hosts into its orbit."
Key bank upgrades to overweight with a price target of $180

Thanks for the gift shorties . Averaging up
no temporary housing for U.S citizens but for Afghans-lol-curry favors from guvmint
Will we see green again today ?? I believe so !!
"Thanks ABNB for all the cash I won with selling puts since your $130 (rolled 135, 140, 150, 155)"
when do we get the next insight into earnings?
"Nothing against abnb but their guidance was slightly weak? Why is only down 2-3%? If this was another name, 15-20% down forsure…unfair market….so racists"
"If this were any other stock with these earnings, it would be up 30. FB, all of the fangs"
i wonder if people on this board will get more cray if airbnb reports $5b in revenue eoy.... some analysts are above that and last earnings seems to be trending in the right direction.
Looks like big reversal to $200 again.
So happy when a plan works out…sell Hi….Buy Low
"Big wave of COVID just beginning. While a great long-term play, this thing is going down in the short term."
"company is losing a ton of money, but sales are growing and accelerating. added this to my portfolio as long term position. this will reach $500 in the next 3 years. ABNB is an absolute disrupter in the travel industry. hotels are growing sales at a 6 to 8 percent pace per year ABNB is more than tripling that!!! yes valuation is rich but warranted."

"I‘m looking forward to the next earnings. I‘ve 31 apartments in Vienna, seeing a huge increase in demand, which doesn’t mean that we‘re at the 2019 level in a city, but getting as close as you can during a pandemic as tourists try to avoid sleeping in hotels (more crowded/unsafe feeling- that‘s why we‘re having more „newbies“ on Airbnb - which are btw horrible because they guess they‘ll think they have a five star service but that‘s something different haha)Therefore I expect booking levels to at rural places to be above 2019 level and Airbnb will (hopefully) impress with there earnings. Just my view !"
"Wow beat on top and bottom line , yet people still panic selling? This thing is so oversold. Don’t let the MMs manipulate you. Guidance was good too. They’re expecting record numbers q3"
"All that good will from the other day is gone...Back to reality. Ugh! Wear a mask and get a shot, so people can travel. I need this to go up."

"The class action lawsuit in the Netherlands has 1,000,000 participants and growing. If each participant is going for a modest average of $3,000 (likely more) that is a $3,000,000,000 liability, plus legal fees, that will not be included in up coming Loss Report. There are literally thousands of other legal actions out there that are not reflected in the books. Extreme caution is warranted. Don't forget Airbnb's 'Black Box Ops Team' is out there dishing out tens of millions of dollars in hush money to victims in order stop the tsunami of litigation."
Wow 10% yesterday!
