"The Company is Giving a HUGE GIFT TO HUMANITY with The Free Housing for Afghan Refugee's. I've never Rented out a Property through The Company. However, after hearing The News this Morning about The Company Stepping Up to Do Good for Those in Need is a Great Thing. If I find myself needing a Vacation Rental I will look at Air B&B 1st and Use The Service.That's Corporate Responsibility Giving Back to Those in Need to The Highest Level that I have Ever Seen. AMAZING!!"
fantastic initiative by Airbnb to provide shelter for Afghan refugees. very impressed with the company.
"unfortunately, this is going to take another year to get going."
300$ soon
Will get back to $250; even with a snowflake lockdown. my birthday party will not include masks
Jumping in !! Bullish chart
BC was smart to do the PR announcement of free housing. But the real message in today’s note was booking numbers are back up to pre pandemic and with vaccine authorization this will only get better. Also he pointed That more ppl r seeking unique houses to rent which have much more margins. With Labor Day travels coming Abnb is stock to ride.
"C'mon, let's break 160 today, I want to see @grant lose his mind."
300 coming soon
Back to $160 soon
"company is losing a ton of money, but sales are growing and accelerating. added this to my portfolio as long term position. this will reach $500 in the next 3 years. ABNB is an absolute disrupter in the travel industry. hotels are growing sales at a 6 to 8 percent pace per year ABNB is more than tripling that!!! yes valuation is rich but warranted."
Airbnb is down 5.15% to 152.10
There is no doubt that this will be a $300-$400.00 some day soon…
ABNB housing the refugees will influence the supply & demand. Good on the numbers in the next quarter.
300$ per share within 6 month max
"Thanks ABNB for all the cash I won with selling puts since your $130 (rolled 135, 140, 150, 155)"
Price Target between $190 (JMP Securities) - $200 (Needham).
World is starting to reopen Airbnb earnings will go up including airbnb 200 .
Any word from ABNB about the homeless American Vets that fought in the Afgan war?
"Grant, did you short more ABNB shares? Good luck to you!"
Thumbs up if Abnb is undervalued. Thumbs down if Abnb is overvalued.
Guys news os mostly vaccine related plus some study said 18 states are trending back down on delta. A lot of travel stocks are up.
"A nice humanitarian gesture today, but where is the money in it? Why is the stock up so much today? Will they be reimbursed for the rooms?"
Strong resistance around 160. Next it has to break to 180 otherwise retreat to 130
Invest in companies you think will generate future returns and sell them when that changes. Airbnb will make more money in the future than today.
"When’s the next earnings? Hold this ten years, make a lot of money, enjoy"
They had some interesting insights about ABNB on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
13.4b in bookings
@D at home sitting on the deck watching the boats sail past.
Can't wait to buy in at 140!
gap filling today I think
CANADIAN POLITICS -- As with many jurisdictions Canada is dealing with a housing affordability crisis. STRs have been identified as a driving force of the crisis. In the Canadian election politicians are vowing to rein-in STRs to negate their negative impact on the housing sector. Canada is not the only jurisdiction wrestling with this colossal problem.
"Rolled a put again, now shorting Oct 15 $160p. Rolling it since $140 !"
"The funny thing is,is that now that the FDA has approved the Pfizer vaccine it is very bullish for travel leaders like Airbnb.One day Abnb will have a market capital valuation of 1 trillion dollars."
"Price well above moving averages now , $200 soon"
Airbnb is up 4.90% to 153.99
no temporary housing for U.S citizens but for Afghans-lol-curry favors from guvmint
"Ad , ad !! This company revenues are huge !!"
Finally
How does giving out housing for free help?
"Overall market down. People trade the news but in the end, fundamental will win, $200 in October, go long!!!!"

"Places booked everywhere. Rates raised. Still booked weeks and months out. Delta strain is peaking. Soon, so will Airbnb profits. Explosion time."
"$200 around the corner, great leadership, ABNB good pr! Let’s roll"
"I find it hard to believe that the refugee announcement is driving the stock today. It's great that it's helping others, but it's almost acting like reddit jumped in."
dang why didn't I grab those puts this morning. that $160 rally was BS.. ERRR
Congrats ABNB long!
Best marketing strategy
"Fund led by PayPal, Airbnb backer Kevin Hartz targets $250"
$180 is still the objective
I am raising target from $200 to $250 with strong buy call !!
so this goes to $152 on earnings and tanks to low $140s.. some free housing at it goes to $158+.. This market is inefficient
Are we in the non-profit category? What is the financial impact on free stays?
Bullish sentiment !
in one month we are at 200.. 
I feel there are more to this market than we know. Ask for a proper guidance before investing in this pretty much complicated market. I've made over 6 btc from an allocation of 1.5 btc over the last 2 months using Andrew Tubbs help. Things might get worse so just make the smarter move. He can be contacted via telegr*m @tradelikeandrew
I can see price going to 400$ easy
