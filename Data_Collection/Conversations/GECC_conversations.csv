I guess we now know why the stock tanked. Someone had info that there would be a miss and took action on that information prior to the announcement.
Why are there no recent comments from people with the knowledge of this company ?
Is someone taking out recent comments. I see them and a little while later they are gone.. Good comments don't seem to last on this site .
any idea whats going on with dividends? i still havent gotten paid anything.
"Fundamental: Balance sheet restructuring achieved with rights offering, portfolio repositioning, and dividend reduction to sustainable level -- all completed or announced in 2020-H2. NAV improving.Technical: Scarce resistance above $4.18/share. Will rise above $5/share in 2021-Q1 and likely into the $6-9/share range (or higher) through 2021."
I picked up some more this morning. Let it keep paying out.
"Sharing more Re: Stock Dividends. To confirm, tax is Not being withheld for any GECC transactions in my account - my YTD Withholding Tax total remains the same as it was in April. Secondly, brokerage notification dated Nov 2 indicates Nov 9 as the expiration date for choosing between dividends in cash or stock, as usual, but did not notice the wording ""TBA stock rate on the record date"" previously. Hope I'm just becoming more critical and not forgetful. At the current stock price I am opting for more shares."
"Special dividend of .24c announced up from last year, January, February, March 2019 dividend stable at .083c and Net Asset Value (NAV) is $ 12"
"I am searching for high dividend yield stocks. this is the highest at its current price (found like 15 with 15-20%), most are in this branch of work.So this one kept tanking consistently from the start, but i read that they needed to reorganize their portfolio and i think they still have a future. So right now i dont have any money left to invest and prob will have in 1 - 2 weeks. Just wondering if you guys could tell me your idea of this stock. I am not knowledgeable about this branch of work and are mostly looking for good (pretty stable) and also high dividends stocks (7+) ."
"Hi everyone , just purchased some shares at $3.16.....Yahoo finance says it pays 30% dividend !!!!! it does not look like it based on monthly dividens ......???????if anybody knows , a resonse would be appreciated ."
"Can someone explain to me how they are doing their calculations? I understand 90% is supposed to go to common stock and 10% going to cash. However; doing the math the 90% of stock is very strange. Here is what I am seeing on mine. 231 shares x .083 dividend = 19.173 total dividend19.173 total - 4.45 cash = 14.723 of common stock14.723 amount for stock / 4 (which are shares gained) = 3.68 price per stockHow did they determine the price for the stocks to be so high? Average for the month of Sept? Price of stock at closing day before ex date was 3.56 which is a .12 difference. And before anyone comments about such a minuscule amount, please know that I'm simply trying to figure out HOW they determine the price, not complaining about it."
Being paid 80% in stock is not good. It dilutes the stock. Cash is 1000 times better. I hope we switch back 3rd quarter..otherwise this stock is toast and I will sell all my shares at a 50% loss.
"I am relatively new to this stock. I do not mind a payout in shares. However, my question is regarding dividend amount. I see $1.00 annual dividend listed. Is that the correct amount currently? .083/month?"
10c quarterly dividend would be .40c yearly. At $3 stock price that would be a 13% dividend.
"Dividends in my opinion are in trouble. If you look at the history, they declare the next quarter's dividends the month of the last ex-div date declared. Last quarter on 6/25 they declared this quarter's divs 4 days before the ex-div date on 6/29. The quarter before that, they declared on 3/19 when the last ex-div was 3/30, etc. This time, there have been no claims of future dividends and we are past the last one declared. Debating just taking the loss now and put my money into a more secure monthly such as OXLC or ORC."
@topalano do you still have faith in this? The day after getting shares from the offering the price is LOWER than the offering price.
"I bought this stock back in May mainly for the monthly dividend. Shortly afterward it had some nice little spikes pushing up toward $9 per share. Since then it has been a very clear downward turn. I will hold as long as they keep making the dividend payments, but I wish I had just invested more money into proven winners that I own."
"Sharing only Re: Stock Dividend Basis. In April I owned 665 shares and opted for pmts in stock only and have received between 12-16 shares and $1-$2.50 each month on the pay date without fail. On Oct 21 (pay date) my 732 shares became 752, with 57¢ cash. My broker only details the cash pmt and the resulting effect on the total cost basis so I've done the calculating, but no matter what percentages and closing prices are used the results are inconsistent. i.e. 732 shares x 8.3¢ = ($60.756 - 57¢ cash rcvd) / $3.38 closing price < 18 shares, and I Received 20! Still, results are always acceptably close and I'm certain tax is not being withheld, and because the dividend is being maintained through Dec, I remain bullish, sort of - today's 32¢ drop on an ex-div of 8.3¢ on double normal volume does Not inspire confidence."
this is a good stock to turn your principle into taxable dividends. the frogs still do not feel the rising temperature of the water.
The NAV on this is 5.53 on Sept 30th. According to NAV this is way undervalued. I think we could see a steady climb to 5 over the next month or two.
