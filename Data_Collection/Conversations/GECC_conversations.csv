Avanti liquidity event in 2021?
Great Elm Capital is up 5.11% to 3.29
"Have you thought about a company giving shares. That can be (depending on where the shares come from), a zero sum game. Lets say a company doubles everyone's shares via a dividend. That is just like a stock split. No value added. You have more shares of a diluted company."
7.4....not gonna happen
Is there any shareholder rights action? I can't believe the shareholders voted favorably to this? Need class action law suit to hold board accountable!
dividend right on time....
GECCM reached an all time high at 25.38
I bet Rick wished he had stayed....
GECCM reached an all time high at 25.39
HI Did anyone get dividend pending from this stock in robinhood? I am not but I buy it before ex-div date. Any explanation?
"Beginning in 2021, GECC goes to quarterly dividend instaed of monthly according to its earnings state,ent"
Stonks
Great Elm Capital is up 5.14% to 3.48
Any guess on another December bonus dividend?
Company says they will pay full dividend in 2nd quarter so I will add shares of GECCL too
"Sharing only Re: Stock Dividend Basis. In April I owned 665 shares and opted for pmts in stock only and have received between 12-16 shares and $1-$2.50 each month on the pay date without fail. On Oct 21 (pay date) my 732 shares became 752, with 57¢ cash. My broker only details the cash pmt and the resulting effect on the total cost basis so I've done the calculating, but no matter what percentages and closing prices are used the results are inconsistent. i.e. 732 shares x 8.3¢ = ($60.756 - 57¢ cash rcvd) / $3.38 closing price < 18 shares, and I Received 20! Still, results are always acceptably close and I'm certain tax is not being withheld, and because the dividend is being maintained through Dec, I remain bullish, sort of - today's 32¢ drop on an ex-div of 8.3¢ on double normal volume does Not inspire confidence."
Down 20% after hours something coming down.....
special divi of .05 announced ex div 26 dec ..payable 27 Jan 2020
Why after I got my dividend it re-invested and i did not place the buy order ?? Any idea ??
Anyone hear anything concerning a special divi?
I'd be cautious in the absence of any information to explain the recent drop. Earnings will be reported Nov 12.
More insider buys on Friday. CEO now owns over 5 million shares. Insiders are loading up at this price.
best I got today was 7.70-7.72...…...i'll take it!
Earnings?
"Just another company that takes your dollar, pays you .10 a year for 5 years then buys your stock at .50. While getting paid big bucks."
report out on 19th was great..???
"Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad it’s going up, just wondering why?"

GECC is up 5.35% to $8.42
"This is a buying opportunity when it made new 12-mo low today at 7.76, right now traded at 7.99. That is about a 32.2% discount from its recent NAV of 11.79 and it already announced a monthly dividend of 0.083 for Oct, Nov and Dec, which equates a 12.47% yield at its current price of 7.99. Today's volume (10/24) so far is only 102,946, way below its daily average of 469,572. Probably panic selling. Small investors always bought and sold at the wrong time. Added some earlier at 8.45, just doubled down at 7.99."
Legal Tax question here: can anyone on the board address if there are any tax implications regarding this non-statutory option for shares held in a ROTH? I have been unable to find this by search.
Great Elm Capital is up 6.73% to 3.72
GECC is down 5.36% to $9.00
Now they are getting creative in ways to take your money.
GECCM reached an all time high at 27.76
Pay my dividend 20% cash and 80% stock. Solid balance sheet..
Last earnings report was amazing and NAV was $ 11.79. Net asset value doesn't change much. I am Buying.
The economy is down. This stock will recover with the economy.
HYLAS 4 TO LAUNCH ANY DAY NOW..or so they say...HYLAS 3 next year? elan musk to launch a bunch of global internet satellites also
Everything green except GECC...not happy or impressed with mgmt not addressing the shareholders on the block sell. I guess tooooo busy or did not care.
"I'm long gecc but the financials look bad, covid or management?"
Relent are you still accumulating GECC?
I would bet they beat ER tomorrow
This will be a buck in no time !
Would highly suggest IR and or CEO put out a statement to alleviate the fears of the shareholders who will panic and not understand the recent large block sell.
when did the dividend change??
GECCM reached an all time high at 25.24
this is a good stock to turn your principle into taxable dividends. the frogs still do not feel the rising temperature of the water.
My Bad.. Found it ..DIVIDEND RATE DECREASE: Great Elm Capital Corp (NASDAQ: GECC) on 02-25-2021 decreased dividend rate > 3% from $1.00 to $0.40
Are higher interest rates going to hurt them going forward?
I wonder if the dividend will go back up again when the market heals
Is someone taking out recent comments. I see them and a little while later they are gone.. Good comments don't seem to last on this site .
Ponzi scheme at its best!
wonder what happen to Rick?
"11/7/18, it looks to me as soon it will report its Q3 earning (according to ETrade it is today), it will either rise or drop sharply depending on its earning. Going to be interesting. Yesterday ABDC started rising and today it rose again, about 10% rise after its earning beat estimate while MRCC lost its shirt after it was being downgraded today."
I’m a buyer at these prices.. nothing wrong with this stock. Excellent price!
GECCM reached an all time high at 25.34
Rights offering is a Ponzi scheme. Dilute shares use proceeds to pay for dividend. That’s why this plunged. Shareholders got screwed again!
How do we buy additional shares if we want and how will we know the cost? Thanks. I am averaging 4.50 so deciding if I want more
"Dividends in my opinion are in trouble. If you look at the history, they declare the next quarter's dividends the month of the last ex-div date declared. Last quarter on 6/25 they declared this quarter's divs 4 days before the ex-div date on 6/29. The quarter before that, they declared on 3/19 when the last ex-div was 3/30, etc. This time, there have been no claims of future dividends and we are past the last one declared. Debating just taking the loss now and put my money into a more secure monthly such as OXLC or ORC."
they covered the distribution...i will stick around another qtr..
"As bad as shareholder's reaction is this morning, really gotta wonder if it'll be much worse when they announce a slashed NAV and dividend. Results from the RO prove that almost NO retail types participated. I bet most of them are just thinking about harvesting their tax loss at this point. They still have nearly 3 months to do it. Patience, patience..."
Great Elm Capital is up 6.58% to 2.77
Why down so much in AH?
The NAV on this is 5.53 on Sept 30th. According to NAV this is way undervalued. I think we could see a steady climb to 5 over the next month or two.
"I haven't checked in awhile, what's up with the div? Is it intermittent and partial stock or all cash again? Thanks."
Took a small position today. Should be interesting. GLTA.
expecting a little more here . but then again I fold many stocks not covering dividend with nii
Sell me shares at $8
good day to accumulate....off .25 is divi for next 3 month..good luck.
I did not buy any share rights(never did figure out how to anyway) because the stock plunged so badly it is probably at a lower price than the rights.
"i don't see any new items about GECC or Avanthi to justify any 10% drop so am hoping it is an anomaly and a buying opportunity because that is what i am doing today, and am very concerned as i am heavily invested for my financial level and have phone investor relations and not yet spoken to Meaghan who is ""away from her desk""...lunchtime? thought they were headed towards a special dividend"
Great Elm Capital is up 5.73% to 3.69
"Hi , i am new to GECC . Are they gonna keep the divs or they gonna cut it ?Looks like payout ratio is too high. And will Gecc be $6-$7 again . What are your toughts?"
The yield is 33%. That's amazing!
"A company with a LT plan..look at pre-market. 1.025 shares for 1 in Apr, May Jun..plus as a percent of shares and small cash dividend."
In at 7.52 out at 8.09 Thanks for the effortless $1000 GECC! I’ll be back for sure :D
"Why is it rallying this much?? Can’t complain, loaded another 2000k shares at 2,6$, but why??"
Rhonda?
"Do I have this right?For a normal 2 for 1 split OS double, SP is cut in half and the market cap stays the same.In this scenario the OS double, SP stays the same and the market cap doubles.We pay 85% for the new shares and hope the market accepts the new market cap."
I guess we start the average on the rights tomorrow right?
I picked up some more this morning. Let it keep paying out.
Falling knife the rights offering was a total disaster !
"I am relatively new to this stock. I do not mind a payout in shares. However, my question is regarding dividend amount. I see $1.00 annual dividend listed. Is that the correct amount currently? .083/month?"
Entered! 1500 @ 7.52 Have another 1500 block order at 7.40 Let’s see how we do here. GL
Anyone know why this is trending down? I’d need to stay 3 years to recover my investment .
Sounds like they expect to be able to meet or exceed the dividend going forward with net investment income. Already replaced Avanti income that had converted to equity and looks like another special dividend will be paid. It sounds like they would be very surprised if stock remains this low for much longer.
"Hi everyone , just purchased some shares at $3.16.....Yahoo finance says it pays 30% dividend !!!!! it does not look like it based on monthly dividens ......???????if anybody knows , a resonse would be appreciated ."
10c quarterly dividend would be .40c yearly. At $3 stock price that would be a 13% dividend.
"10/26/18 Well, DOW just dropped 525 points or down 2.1%, yet GECC rose 1.1%, currently traded at 8.27. If anyone had bought some at its 12-mo low of 7.76 two days ago (10/24) that would already be a 6.6% return after 2 days. Not bad. Of course, it could have dropped more, but why?"
"yes that was the snippet of info gleaned today....large block of shares sold off (overly cheaply) by original investors at Mast Capital for reasons their own, seemingly without much regard for fellow shareholders...decisions on special dividends upcoming forthwith by management...i bought more at new lower share price to adjust my cost basis downwards...as for my long term outlook..hoping within 5 years we humans learn how to clean up and harvest all the junk and garbage floating around near satellites and keep the militarization of space illegal...ho hum...just another day in trumpland..."
Help Me Out .. Looks like there switching there Div's over to 1/4 instead of monthly at .10 Thats not $ 1.00 a year
Any info on what's going on with the stock today
a lot of buyers before the next .08 divi. Cheers
"Ok I see something in my stock account that says GECC rights. However, it does not let me do anything with it. No price. No way of buying anything. Does anyone know what to do with it? Thanks."
Insiders own 18.75% of shares through GEC or GECC or both
so received $0.0192 per share 
"Hello all ,seemed like a good price at $8.22 in for the 12.1% dividends......….."
Just look at 5 year chart ffs
Nice net investment income and cash on balance sheets. Love getting stock at These prices too
"Amazing how the market is willing to pay this much, given that GECC's current price is only 15% discount to its projected post-rights offering NAV, and dividend is about to be slashed. JMHO."
Where are you “j”. I as a bagholders feel sorry for your short position man. Sure has been a great ride so far
"Disappointed in mgmt who decided against addressing shareholders during the big block sale. Better be a good report next week or I am out, plenty of companies where mgmt does care."
"from the looks of level II , this may get to the mid to low teens..."
"A special Dividend is doubtful,since they just acquired a company"
"Wow, look at all the volume in GECC's baby bonds today! Are they planning to call this debt early, or is somebody simply hedging a short? Either way, the real opportunity here -- clearly -- has been with those bonds rather than the stock. Condolences (and good luck) to the existing shareholders..."
"Great Elm Capital Corp (NASDAQ:GECC) major shareholder Mast Capital Management, Llc sold 43,890 shares of the business's stock in a transaction on Tuesday, January 8th."
Crazy low volume the last week! No one wants to sell at these cheap prices!
Why isn’t there more volume here?
got some more at $8.18......
who leaked earnings
why is my dividend being reinvested I didn't ask for that
Txs GECC for the special divi...
this was in the eights pre-covid.. Anyone think it gets back there at some point?
"Special dividend of .24c announced up from last year, January, February, March 2019 dividend stable at .083c and Net Asset Value (NAV) is $ 12"
Mast capital just raised their position from 6% to 25.4%
"think they did a lot of share buy back @ $11 ish, why not @ $7.75?????"
Divi unchanged and announced out to qtr 3. Cheers
T-minus 6 days till the start of the RO pricing window. And then a further 15% discount from that? Sure looks like a huge hit to NAV is coming soon...
Being paid 80% in stock is not good. It dilutes the stock. Cash is 1000 times better. I hope we switch back 3rd quarter..otherwise this stock is toast and I will sell all my shares at a 50% loss.
"Sharing more Re: Stock Dividends. To confirm, tax is Not being withheld for any GECC transactions in my account - my YTD Withholding Tax total remains the same as it was in April. Secondly, brokerage notification dated Nov 2 indicates Nov 9 as the expiration date for choosing between dividends in cash or stock, as usual, but did not notice the wording ""TBA stock rate on the record date"" previously. Hope I'm just becoming more critical and not forgetful. At the current stock price I am opting for more shares."
it's still a deal at 8
GECCM reached an all time high at 25.35
pay day....
looks like tne next dividend coming soon will be 10 cents which is 37% per year .......WOW
Dividend is now .083 pershr/per mo according to message on my e-trade acc

I own gecc in my Roth ira.Bought more at 8.20.buying for the long term.dripping the 12% dividends.And the 5 million share buy back is not so bad neither.Staying long  good luck to all.
Nice divi yesterday and the special coming up on the 28th.
Another nice pay day.
The Miss in ER was already priced into the stock! Didn't even move! Illegal insider trading was went on! Hope they burn
Has anyone calculated their total value of investment from purchase to today including price price (drop) and divs? Try it and share with us please.
"Hey Relent, are you buying more?"
Why are there no recent comments from people with the knowledge of this company ?
FREE FALLING FOR 2 MONTHS.
@topalano do you still have faith in this? The day after getting shares from the offering the price is LOWER than the offering price.
GECC is down -5.60% to 9.43
HYLAS 4 successfully launched by Arianespace this afternoon....
So what is the subscription price as mentioned on Aug 30?
"This may or not be strange but on TD Ameritrage when you look at GECC profile,select the summary tab,scroll down to NEWS it shows...……….11/14/19 06:04 Great Elm Capital 3Q Loss/Shr .96c > via Dow Jones...….am I missing something?"
Declared first quarter 2019 dividend of $.25 or .083 a month! Divi stays unchanged
Great earnings report...
when are the dates of the dividend payout and when do you have to own shares TIA
"Fundamental: Balance sheet restructuring achieved with rights offering, portfolio repositioning, and dividend reduction to sustainable level -- all completed or announced in 2020-H2. NAV improving.Technical: Scarce resistance above $4.18/share. Will rise above $5/share in 2021-Q1 and likely into the $6-9/share range (or higher) through 2021."
"Rhonda....Got a position today in GECC….excited ZTR, less seed money!!!!!"
Love this company!
"Can someone explain to me how they are doing their calculations? I understand 90% is supposed to go to common stock and 10% going to cash. However; doing the math the 90% of stock is very strange. Here is what I am seeing on mine. 231 shares x .083 dividend = 19.173 total dividend19.173 total - 4.45 cash = 14.723 of common stock14.723 amount for stock / 4 (which are shares gained) = 3.68 price per stockHow did they determine the price for the stocks to be so high? Average for the month of Sept? Price of stock at closing day before ex date was 3.56 which is a .12 difference. And before anyone comments about such a minuscule amount, please know that I'm simply trying to figure out HOW they determine the price, not complaining about it."
Also called IR Meaghan and no answer. Sent her a email asking for a call. Will let you know if I hear anything.
"At least they didn’t suspend div like so many. GECC, OXLC, and NBR-PA dividends have been cash machines for me. NBR-PA ex div July 14. OXLC ex div July 16. Great month."
maybe they can still do some open market stock buy back?
"hey relent, you buying?"
GECC reached a 52 Week low at $7.51
I do not trust this yield.
"My thesis sort of blew up with this one. Thought oversubscriptions to RO necessarily meant special knowledge. Instead, see Avanti debt fall to 3 cents on the dollar, and Avanti PIK revenue represent nearly all of GECC's NII. And then see RO cash thrown at SPAC's? In February, at the peak of that market? You gotta be kidding me. Maybe the RO really will prove to be a theft of property eventually. But it sure doesn't seem to be developing that way now, so I'm out."
I guess we now know why the stock tanked. Someone had info that there would be a miss and took action on that information prior to the announcement.
My broker got back to me and asked if I wanted to buy my exercise rights at 4.52 a share. Lol what. No thanks. That is the price they are officially offering and they will sell 0 shares at that price.
GECCM reached an all time high at 25.28
divi announcement out today...solid next 3 months.
GECCM reached an all time high at 25.30
"Was looking at this company until I read the Barron's review and some of the below comments.The Company's Fundamentals Look Very Poor Making an Investment in Its Shares Purely SpeculativeMarketGrader currently rates Great Elm Capital Corp SELL, based on an overall grade of 20.80 (out of 100)."
"Not short here at all. Actually hold concentrated positions in GECCL and GECCN. But as far as GECC is concerned, all hinges on the next earnings release. That's when we find out if the RO was a desperation move necessitated by collapsing NAV, or more of a land grab from non-participating retail types. Who knows, I could see the equity as a reasonable risk at some point."
FREE FALLING FOR OVER A MONTH
"I am searching for high dividend yield stocks. this is the highest at its current price (found like 15 with 15-20%), most are in this branch of work.So this one kept tanking consistently from the start, but i read that they needed to reorganize their portfolio and i think they still have a future. So right now i dont have any money left to invest and prob will have in 1 - 2 weeks. Just wondering if you guys could tell me your idea of this stock. I am not knowledgeable about this branch of work and are mostly looking for good (pretty stable) and also high dividends stocks (7+) ."
I doubled down with the share offer. Total hail mary by management.
GECCM reached an all time high at 25.32
Unfortunately I bought this dog ... now my only choice is to hold and recoup losses thru dividends. I’ll should have stuck with higher quality bdc. And not this speculative one
increasing in NAV per share 5.5$
any idea whats going on with dividends? i still havent gotten paid anything.
"I bought this stock back in May mainly for the monthly dividend. Shortly afterward it had some nice little spikes pushing up toward $9 per share. Since then it has been a very clear downward turn. I will hold as long as they keep making the dividend payments, but I wish I had just invested more money into proven winners that I own."
divi paid today.....GL
Is this stock worth keeping or a waste of time? I am only down 3 cents per share now and the dividends have been really horrible and this is happening with a nearly recovered stock market.
Earningsbeat + covid vaccine
Am I dreaming? Or is this in green?!
Divi right on time...
accumulated more today
GECCM reached an all time high at 25.31
I keep buying it between 8.05 and 8.30. Love the dividends
Anyone get paid?
"Wow the dive continues , they will definitely cut the dividend"
GECCM reached an all time high at 25.25
GECCM reached an all time high at 24.76
i'll have some of that too...if you don't mind
"Soooo, does anybody know why it's down so much today"
All time lows ... everyone here is a bagholder ... except me I own no shares!!

Did I not tell u guys this dog has fleas? As soon as the ex div comes this drops like a rock no support .. just hoping to get my money back
earnings?
Look like we are getting additional 10% discount :’)
I'll take it !
Got divi as promised...20% cash 80% stock. cheers
"Quick back of napkin: If NAV was $5/share at last check, and hasn't changed since then, then doubling share count @ $3 results in revised NAV of $4/share. So $3 is ""only"" a 25% discount. Is that enough considering the %^&* history of the portfolio?"
