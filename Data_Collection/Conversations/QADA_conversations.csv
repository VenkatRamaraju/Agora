Another good quarter. Nice transition to the cloud for its customers and continues to win against SAP. Even a modest dividend. Nice tailwinds for a stock that has had little interest from investors.
"I thought it was another decent quarter. Seems like a pretty steady, non promotional, company with good tailwinds. I find their conference calls to be worthwhile. Unlike many tech stocks, nice to see that they are not swelling the share count with stock based compensation."

"Also, a 95 PE means that it will take an investor 95 years of earnings to get back their hard-earned investments. Sell when you can"
