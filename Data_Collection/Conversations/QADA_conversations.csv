Another good quarter. Nice transition to the cloud for its customers and continues to win against SAP. Even a modest dividend. Nice tailwinds for a stock that has had little interest from investors.

"I thought it was another decent quarter. Seems like a pretty steady, non promotional, company with good tailwinds. I find their conference calls to be worthwhile. Unlike many tech stocks, nice to see that they are not swelling the share count with stock based compensation."
