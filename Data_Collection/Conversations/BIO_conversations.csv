"#HIDDENGEM To the #MOON #BIO #BITCOIN #SOLAR Stocks to BUY: IBIO, SANP, INND, SING & BLSP Here is my deep dive analysis of IBIO and why it will become a 30-50 dollar stock.

Why pre-market minus 12.19% ? I can't see any news about the company last 48 hoursThank you
$BIO Seriously undervalued with the lowest P/E (4.75) of all mid-large cap Healthcare companies.
"If you think a so called moon shot isn't possible here, just look at the MAX chart on Bio Rad Labs $BIO trading @ $3.33 in March of 1993 and now trading at $514 PS...27 years...It was $54 just 10ish years ago (1000% INCREASE IN 10 YEARS)...These things happen, don't kid yourself that it can't. More likely $BNGO will be a Bio Rad Labs than not!"
Bio Rad Owns 8 billion in Investments. Anyone know what company they have 8 billion invested in?

"Went Long 225 shares of BIO at an average price of $598.77, yesterday. This is a short/medium term value/momentum/company quality play. I am looking for a 30-60% stock price gain over the next 30-60 days. I find this stock to be incredibly attractive in terms of risk/reward ratio. Downside risk from the $600 level appears almost nil to me. BIO is a leader in its field, with outstanding financials. very low P/E ratio, and huge growth potential going forward. I love the sector and see it only growing in coming years. Health Care and Life Sciences equipment are guaranteed to grow in demand on a worldwide level in coming years. BIO is a huge company, well-known throughout the entire First World as a leader in its field. I believe the company will thrive regardless of any economic headwinds the USA may experience in the next few years. I bypassed a lot of other companies offering opportunities for 100-500% stock price gains, due to the increased risk those stocks carry if they fail to deliver on a specific technology or product. BIO carries no such risk. I believe current Fair Value for BIO is over $700/share, and it should actually price well ahead of fair value based upon growth potential. I put almost my entire liquid asset cash savings into this stock yesterday in anticipation this will quickly move up to the $750-$850 level within the next 3-6 months."

"OK, I haven't looked at this company for years. Can someone give a quick explanation about the earnings trend over the last 4 years. Surely these numbers from Yahoo are incorrect.Diluted EPS - 126.20 58.27 11.94 3.82"
Sold my 225 shares at an average price of $627.10 for a small profit. Tired of waiting and I see better opportunities in Shorting stocks ahead of earnings as Irrational Exuberance drives stock prices up to even more unsustainable levels. Good Luck Folks! :-)
This only dropped on vaccines news but testing still needed and will continue into 2021.
"The market is due for a correction, probably of at least 10%. Myabe worse. The average S&P PE ratio is 39The historic average is about 16, so a really big drop could be round the corner, It will bring dowb all stocks, including BIO. I am waiting in cash to buy BIO in the dip."
"The recent big ptofits were due to BIO supplying covid tests.So profits will fall as covid recedes, and the share price will probably fall,but once it settles this will be a great investment."
Panic selling is good for this stock and LT investors.. keep buying more at this discounted price. It will be up 25-50 $ in a week.
"Simply...who wanted to buy the discounted options offered with th $BIO new emission $1,18 has already bought. So there is a place for small price rise...And to all complaining colleagues ... the newly obtained money are ""for a reason"".. and the newly nominated Scientific Officer is ""for a reason""... we can expect something reasonably huuuuuge... and rather soon... Real investing is not a Las Vegas Cassino.."

"I have been using Bio-Rad products, specifically their NGC and imaging systems, for the past two years and love their products relative to other companies. The NGC and the Chromlab software blow GE's AKTA and the Unicorn software out of the water. Anyone else have opinions? I know this board is dead but would love to hear other's thoughts."
Why can‚Äôt a company like Bio-Rad produce tests for covid-19?
