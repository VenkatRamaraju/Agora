"Went Long 225 shares of BIO at an average price of $598.77, yesterday. This is a short/medium term value/momentum/company quality play. I am looking for a 30-60% stock price gain over the next 30-60 days. I find this stock to be incredibly attractive in terms of risk/reward ratio. Downside risk from the $600 level appears almost nil to me. BIO is a leader in its field, with outstanding financials. very low P/E ratio, and huge growth potential going forward. I love the sector and see it only growing in coming years. Health Care and Life Sciences equipment are guaranteed to grow in demand on a worldwide level in coming years. BIO is a huge company, well-known throughout the entire First World as a leader in its field. I believe the company will thrive regardless of any economic headwinds the USA may experience in the next few years. I bypassed a lot of other companies offering opportunities for 100-500% stock price gains, due to the increased risk those stocks carry if they fail to deliver on a specific technology or product. BIO carries no such risk. I believe current Fair Value for BIO is over $700/share, and it should actually price well ahead of fair value based upon growth potential. I put almost my entire liquid asset cash savings into this stock yesterday in anticipation this will quickly move up to the $750-$850 level within the next 3-6 months."
