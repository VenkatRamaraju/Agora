"The Korean banking sector, IMHO, seems heavily weighted towards retail. Gas station, car wash, motel, liquor store, etc. I think they will be hit especially hard."

"To me a great ""merger of equals"" candidate for Hanmi is Central Pacific Financial (NYSE:CPF) based in Hawaii. CPF offers much more of a multi ethnic customer base on which the Hanmi mainland branches hopefully can expand upon. Other than that they are very similar in most financial matrix. Hanmi could bring much greater geographic footprint for CPF. Unknown are computer systems and alloting top management slots in any merger. Perhaps they could also come up with a better new logo than Bank of Hope."

"Just speculating. But I’ve read many times that companies will skip earnings reports to work out the final leg of a buyout. I know that’s a trash rumor comment, but I figured this stock is so badly screaming “short me” that it could surprise everyone"

"Large portions of small biz loan clients at HAFC and HOPE do manufacturing/trading biz in China. The trade war between US-China is hard on bigger corporations while it can be devastating to smaller ones.I assume HAFC and HOPE clientele lean towards smaller independent companies.IMO, HAFC and HOPE will bounce back when the trade war is over (hopefully in near future).However 3Q & 4Q earnings will probably take a hit or stay flat.I'll wait for 15% lower entry point on these two."
