They had some interesting insights about PLAN on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.

Good luck all longs. I have been in PLAN for 2 years now. Really happy with its performance this quarter. This thing is going to get better and better in the future by the look of it. I did not sell during the pandemic lows and that reward is paying off now.

"PLAN just crossed its 200 day Moving average. With ER next week, and a good ER by WDAY, all bodes well for PLAN to do well from now until the end of the year. IT spending is picking up, and Enterprise Software for Planning and Modelling is in huge demand by large Enterprises."
