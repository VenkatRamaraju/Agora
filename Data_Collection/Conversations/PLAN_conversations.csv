$PLAN keep going up after George Soros purchased a large stake in his recent disclose.

Anaplan is up 4.98% to 62.39
What happened pre market?!?
looking for breakout next year
Look at SMAR....we could be next
PLAN doesnt make any money....they may need to keep prices lower because of tough competition....MSFT ORACLE NOW??? Who do they compete against???
Nice. Sold mine at 53.40.
"Anaplan Inc. lies in the lower part of a wide and strong rising trend in the short term, and this will normally pose a very good buying opportunity. A break down the bottom trend line at $55.95 will firstly indicate a slower raising rate, but may also be a early warning for a trend shift. Given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise 29.95% during the next 3 months and, with 90% probability hold a price between $72.70 and $84.83 at the end of this period."
The should have a great earnings report.
My guess is something to do with revisions
"Gurufocus issued an article about the risks associated with PLANs high valuation. I can issue the same ""report"" about any publicly traded stock. Nothing behind it. Guess what, investing in the market is inherently risky."
Needham and Barclays initiates with a $30 PT. Just the beginning.
They should start buying for 4th qtr in next 2 weeks
Glad that I sold out @65 last month! Will jump back @40 though..
"Well, this is just bottom out. Will be great opportunity to buy at some points in the future. Good luck guys."
on the move up with good volume!
This company has great balance sheet and quarterly revenue year to year is also outstanding.I’m taking position next week.
For the past month nothing has been happening
Where do you see plan in 2 years??
Just bought more. Bottom is in.
Anyone know why?
We waited too long but patience paid off.
"CEO sells 45,000 sharesCFO sells 30,000 sharesEarnings are May 26Why sell now??https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1540755.htm"
"PLAN is egregiously overvalued now, only 240 million in yearly revenue, Negative income. Market cap in the stratosphere at 8 billion. Sell half if you're up big."
"Monness, Crespi, Hardt analyst Brian White raised the price target on Anaplan Inc. (NYSE: PLAN) to $66.00 (from $62.00)"
Good earnings coming for analplan?
Is anyone holding this stock?
great price point right now and surely will be back up to the $40's. companies will need to handle their budgeting better in times like these
https://www.anaplan.com/connected-planning-xperience/2020-sessions/ - These videos explain why Anaplan is great company for the long term.
"RHT bought for 33 Billion, This should move PLAN to at least 6B or $50"
The Birds happy . NOw giddyup
Good luck all longs. I have been in PLAN for 2 years now. Really happy with its performance this quarter. This thing is going to get better and better in the future by the look of it. I did not sell during the pandemic lows and that reward is paying off now.
Time to buy before Monday. As soon as the stimulus passing stock market will recover significantly
Anaplan is down 4.94% to 53.91
Buy some shares management
"IBM losing cloud share, down big. Buying PLAN."
"PLAN market cap 5 Billion and DOMO just reached 1 Billion.. FY 20 revenues projects for PLAN is 310 million and DOMO 173 million, so PLANs MC is 16x sales, when DOMOs MC is 16x sales that will =2.76 Billion. That equates to $ 111/stock price."
Closed just shy of the 3 month high! Good earnings and guidance and it'll take a ride into mid 60s
I think its a mistake. My vanguard acct has $49.30 - $53.00 open
Way over bought!!
Looks like 70$ will be sooner
lets see 30 today
Anaplan is up 5.67% to 70.48
Boom!
trend is up
Over-inflated now….
Many companies didn't even dare to give a guidance for their Q2.
A very nice week so far. Let's see if growth stocks can hold tomorrow.
Anaplan's cloud platform is disrupting and replacing legacy spreadsheets enabling users to have a much better grasp on their business. Check out the many customer stories on the Anaplan's web site. The revenue growth looks promising to continue as the old fashioned spreadsheet for planning is being replaced by Anaplan's platform to enable companies to do better planning in nearly real time. All companies have plans. Lots of opportunities for Anaplan's biz
"Not much chatter up in these woods, is there"
isn't the lock up expiration 4/12?
Anaplan is down 18.67% to 46.35
this is a once in a lifetime buying opportunity
we finally gonna forge ahead into the 70-80's
Good morning all long PLAN holders!
So PLAN is lower than last below out quarter!!!!!!!!
how's FSLY doing
Calderoni and team nails it again!
"Anaplan, article good info. Anaplan: Steadily growing connected enterprise planningEnterprise software took one on the chin in 2020. Faced with uncertainty during the start of the pandemic, many organizations halted their spending on new tech initiatives. But purse strings have been loosening up again this year, especially on software that can help make a business more efficient.Enter Anaplan, which developed a cloud-based enterprise resource planning platform that connects data from across an organization to help teams make better decisions. Add in some machine learning (a branch of artificial intelligence) to help forecast outcomes and a collaborative workspace built for a new era of remote work, and the result is a powerful software offering that helps large organizations break down barriers between their various operating arms.In spite of a tough year, Anaplan reported having over 1,700 customers in total, 473 of which spend at least $250,000 a year (compared to just 367 last year).Those new customers, plus Anaplan lapping the first round of lockdowns last spring to halt the spread of COVID-19, resulted in a 25% year-over-year increase in revenue to $129.8 million. Free cash flow has also turned positive as Anaplan starts to reach a profitable scale. Free cash flow generated was $7.6 million in the fiscal first quarter, compared to negative $6.0 million a year ago. The SaaS company also had $328 million in cash and equivalents and no debt on its balance sheet, giving it ample room to market aggressively to new customers. Management expects current-year sales to be up at least 24% as it steadily adds new users and expands the use of its planning software with existing ones. Given this outlook, shares look like a long-term value at 13 times expected current fiscal-year sales, and Anaplan in the early stages of turning a profit should help the valuation going forward as well. I'm a buyer after this stock's recent 40% plunge from all-time highs."
Huge run up into earnings so this is acceptable reaction to me. Long term prospect is still great. No virus repercussions. EPS beat for 5th straight quarter.
"Research reports usually come from underwriters 30 days after ipo, so looking for them in early November."
See Workday
"I started a position in PLAN on Thursday as the 50 dma crossed above the 100 dma and the stock price tapped both of these lines and bounced back up. So, have some call options that expire in November. I think this company has a lot of potential in the SaaS realm and is currently undervalued compared to other SaaS names like DDOG, TEAM, ZM, WORK, etc."
"I worked for covad in 99, this aint 99 stuff"
I guess the CEO and CFO missed out on a few Mill'in dollars
"Short term selling by the big guys to fund purchase new IPO, Cloudflare."
The founders will continue to expand and raise more capital by diluting the share price with more shares as the price climbs. Buy on pull backs and take advantage of short gains until all shares are in the market.
Short
LOL open in 23.53?
After April 10 should start to see steady rise in price.

Best of breed PLAN and VRT
PLAN shares are on sale today!
"is there any substantial news causing a 10%+ selloff in Plan? chief revenue officer is resigning. other than that, no news that would cause this drop as far as I can tell."
"All I can say is ""wow"""
I think Barron's has a story about PLAN being overlooked. I don't subscribe to that service. Can anyone confirm?
Reclaim the loss. 60 it is.
Anaplan is so under-performed. It's only one cloud that was left behind.
What happened today?
Did someone say LILA
Just added 20k on margin MFkrs. bring it on
"Delighted to see the pre market bounce, great earnings.. Glad I held firm. Good look to all holders especially the long termers. Looking like it's going to be a very green day! Love it."
Anaplan reached an all time high at 64.97

"Anaplan price target raised to $75 from $70 at RBC Capital 07:56 PLAN RBC Capital analyst Alex Zukin raised his price target for Anaplan to $75 from $70 and reiterates an Outperform rating on the shares ahead of the company's Q4 results. The analyst's checks suggest a ""strong finish"" to the year for the company, benefiting from meaningful large deal activity. As a result, Zukin anticipates upside to guidance in-line or better than recent averages and increased fiscal 2021 revenue guidance. Unusual discounting was not needed to close deals nor did partners pick up any other unusual activity to close deals late in the year - both typical signs of a strong quarter, Zukin tells investors in a pre-earnings research note. The analyst feels ""incrementally more confident"" about Anaplan's pace of deal signings and pipelines than when he put the company on his top ideas list to start the year. He continues to believe Anaplan is ""at the tip of the spear"" for digital transformation of financial and operational planning systems, a $21B-plus market.Read more at:https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3032605feel free to read/view some of PLAN's customer stories available on PLAN's website.the legacy old fashioned SPREADSHEET is getting outdated in today's fast paced internet business world. PLAN allows companies to make more accurate decisions in nearly real time to better compete in the marketplace. All companies have plans. The opportunity here looks tremendous to me!"
Good upward trend last 2+ days
Another poor earnings report which may likely take shares price to a range of 41 tomorrow. Business as usual.
"Just bought 1k shares at $47. This seemed to be one of the more stable names, and very well managed company. Not stable today obviously but what is? Confident will be in mid 50’s when market calms down a bit"
Good price to buy now?
Crazy undervalued..been holding since 40ish when MF advised and bought more when it dipped recently..no sell until 100..
Already have profits from my purchases this morning. Long and strong for PLAN. Great qtr!!!
Just a survey and no pumpers/dumpers please.What percentage do you think PLAN will go up after a positive ER andwhat percentage do you think PLAN will go down after a negative ER?

Brutal. We were north of $50 several days ago.
"Stephanie Link on CNBC just announced she bought more Anaplan. Great fundamentals, got beat up for no reason."
Moved to FSLY.
"So Anaplan is basically advanced spreadsheets? like Excel? Competing with Microsoft Sounds like a recipe for disaster, correct me if I'm wrong."
ive been in since $26 how about you guys?
Any chance this would be bought out by anyone?
"Heads up investors...I did some pre-IPO consulting with Anaplan, specifically hired by Frank (Calderoni, their CEO). I got a call today from a well known executive head hunter asking me if I'd be willing to discuss my 1 on 1 experience with Frank and answer questions about his management style, how he regards corporate culture etc ""for their client"" in the next couple of days. Point is...some company is planning on trying to poach him and making him an offer to leave Anaplan. Considering his success with Anaplan, it will likely be an offer rich enough that he simply can't refuse it. I own PLAN stock, been long on it since IPO but am pretty sure the stock will take a considerable hit if Frank were to leave. ""PLAN"" accordingly."
"Nice beat, huge upside."
Revenues were padded to look good ahead of lawsuits.
Opening at 33 tomorrow. Check the news article out of AsIa.
"Stephanie Link of Hightower just said to buy Anaplan on CNBC, based on CFO news, and stock being down 22% this year... ""Still a wonderful story"""
SunTrust raises price Target from 65 to 68
Solid company at the core of business processes. Will be taken over in a buy out in the future at $50+. Buy and hold for at least a double from here.
Who is still hold this shares when it was at 22.16 a share
$50 is only a 6B Market Cap. WDAY is 29B ORCL 181B
Thank god. With tech getting crunched on each earnings this is breath of fresh air.
$TWLO will be using $PLAN to avoid earnings forecasting calculations mistakes. Kudos to $PLAN
"Wow, big selloff on no news I can find. Anyone have a clue."
PLAN expecting another big loss and huge market cap. DOMO improving big year over year and EGAN up guidance and is profitable already with best value in market cap.
TDOC is tearing the roof off on good ER. Looking at mid-hi 60s+ if we can do the same. Less than $2B mkt cap. Soooo much upside!
not interested in Ryan's random tickers
"Look at CDLX..gosh dang I had that in 30's 2 wks ago, That should be PLAN. PING moving, FSLY same. IIIV gonna move OVID creepin up"
"Insiders Bought 1,461,819 shares on 28-JUN-2019. Sold 45,000 shares on 28-JUN-2019."
Congrats to the IPO. Did any body here get in at $17?
Anaplan reached an all time high at 73.79
$PLAN will hit $75 easily in the next few days. Excellent ER Report. This pre-market down is temporary.
Wow indeed. Some of this may be a catch-up on recent selloff as PLAN was down less than similar names. But geez! Will use some free cash and add some.
"I have to roll my eyes at reactions like this. Another beat and a raise (they've beat and raised every quarter since going public ~2.5 years ago and because they don't turn in 100% per quarter revenue increases they lose 15% in an hour?Half a dozen blue chip analysts have Anaplan's median stock price targets at $83 bucks. The high end target is $100/share. ""Thanks"" I guess...Pretty rare opportunity to pick up shares worth conservatively ~$83 bucks a share now for 20% off, so I dumped 20K into it. This will be trading in the 80's again by mid March. My two cents."
Move move today. Heading back towards $60 on it's way to $80 in a year.
Anyone buying or holding ??
This one looks like a solid player. It attracts .cloud seasoned employees. Folks that don’t jump from one startup to the next.
"buy the Dip. this was a great year, considering Covid. Read the earnings transcript, there was lots of good news (i.e AWS Partnership, Mckinsey Consulting, etc.) to look forward to. this selloff is a complete over reaction."
Salesforce is coming their way. Obvious purchase for CRM. They are already investors in this awesome company. LONG
This stock gets hit harder than all my other holdings in every market pullback.
"my guess is 28-35 premarket monday, anyone else?"
PLANcoin going back up (4 whatever odd ball reason...)

Is this company considered a growth cloud base stock?
This thing will back near its previous close by the end of the day.
Went up 20% in the last 4 days with earnings ahead. How come this board is empty??
Sell it all and put it in WDC. You’ll be better off
Is it good to buy now PLAN???

"Lads, your thoughts on after lockup period please. Keeping or selling? I might keep as their product is very promising and trend for cloud stocks are heading up."
They had some interesting insights about PLAN on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Anaplan is up 10.63% to 68.87
hottest stock going.
slow and steady wins the race!
"AMRN, Wooow buyouts noise really hot just make sure it’s over $100 , a year or two will be Lipitor price, $ALLK $PLAN $QGEN $GTHX $TWTR all undervalued"

Moving some profits to EGAN. Cloud play with earnings and great growth.
￼Any news as to why this is up so big today? Or is it just up?
Finally getting some happiness with Plan. I only wish it was at $80 per share.
so with a good 3qrt report this thing should be in the 30's
What’s the consensus on PLAN here?

Still pricy
$55 by end of April seems to be a real possibility
"Anaplan's Top 25 customers spend on average $4.2M annually. These same customers started with an average spend $400K. Anaplan gets almost 20% of their overall revenue from only 25 out of 1600 total customers. And they have no competition in Enterprise Connected Planning. Long Term hold, with opportunity grow, grow, grow, or get bought out with a hefty premium."
$PLAN staying on plan. 90% probability hold a price between $72.83 and $84.80 in the next month or two.
I know it’s been a bloodbath day but this is without a doubt oversold territory.
RBC bull target $70
A good week overall. Nice that we touched $50.
PLAN bouncing off 28's again...get some BUYERS and volume!

Been a holder for about 2 years and have made some good profits on these 2-3 month price swings for PLAN. But I lost sight of the short positions which is about 14% as per Yahoo Finance. Nice squeeze happening 
going under $45 if not 40
$PLAN marching to $75 next few days. Profit taking morning.
"I love this stock. If you can catch it when it’s down, you can make a quick 5-8% in less than a week."
Anaplan reached an all time high at 75.42
"If we keep this up, price will be close to $70 prior to earnings!"
down 24%. wow. can we say overreaction for a beat on both top and bottom lines.
I missed the boat at 56
Nothing unexpected here. Should close green.
"PLAN is so much under value right now compare to its peers. If it can show that this pandemic has little impact on their business, it will hit all time high and more."
"From a healthy profit to down 11%. Curious as to why? Understand the tech crash and all, but good Lord. This is a great a company. Guess I’ll be adding hand over fist."
"Be careful but stay bullish: President and CEO of Anaplan Inc (NYSE:PLAN) Frank Calderoni sold 100,000 shares of PLAN on 06/28/2019 at an average price of $49.75 a share."
"PLAN just crossed its 200 day Moving average. With ER next week, and a good ER by WDAY, all bodes well for PLAN to do well from now until the end of the year. IT spending is picking up, and Enterprise Software for Planning and Modelling is in huge demand by large Enterprises."
The company doesn't have good earnings track record and trading on the losing side following earnings report is very likely.Take your profits before earnings.
Considering the worldwide pandemic they did extremely well. Hope it drops 10% ad I'll buy more.
just got in at $47.37 but only 500 shares scared it might go lower

Agreed. I'm already green on my morning dip buys
