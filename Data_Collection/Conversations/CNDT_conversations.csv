 might go straight to $6 this week
I was hoping for some Christmas cheer from CNDT guess I will have to wait.
"With the seller still around can we see something good? maybe the silver lining is the stock keeps closing over 8, also stock is being cleaned up. not as fast as we would like but it is happening. If the fed is nice to us this week I can see us going above 8 1/2 since we cleaned up a lot of stock on open orders last week.I have an order in to buy at 7.95 if it ticks down. long term should be safe."
"This stock has problems usually a stock will bounce not in this case the selling is relentless I don’t know the short sale rule if it still takes an uptick to sell the way it was years ago if anybody can reach the company let us know if they answer the phones in New Jersey when I called they answered the phone in the Caribbean not a pretty sight the seller just doesn’t stop i’m sure every owner of the stock is not a happy camper I understand company can’t say a word it’s in the quiet. Period, but where are the analysts? I cannot stay Bullish at this point who can? ￼￼￼￼￼"
400 k shares bought up ore market at 6.74Someone knows something
Company is turning around it just doesn’t have any sponsorship will take a couple of quarters making money we haven’t seen that yet if it can hold here and trade we all should be happy it has no reason to be A double digits stock at the moment. There are lots of losses in the stock long term holders probably will be getting out by years end offsetting gains in other companies. Let’s hope a large salesman and a major broker Chaus decides to take a position everybody have a wonderful Christmas and New Year’s and above all stay safe￼￼￼
Need to beat .19c and 1.03B as well as good guidance
"I am surprised the shares did so poorly this earnings Q. Earnings keep improving, and the stock kept popping up, except the Quarter. This company is doing very, very well. The shares do not reflect this."
Good quarter regardless if the seller it’s still selling stock is a hold for a long term. Refinancing they feel will happen in a couple of months and everybody is relieved thinking the worst because of the seller if the stock drops I’ll pick up more shares Have a good weekend everyone￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
Good morning maybe oh I do not want to get anybody nervous just going to give you the facts I called the company this morning the switchboard is overseas I asked for the number in New Jersey I was told by the operator they have no phone service I left a message for them to call me or email me this is not good as far as I am concerned if anybody knows how to get in touch with the main office please let me know or do so And let everybody know people have money invested in this company and that could create a major problem for them try to help each other I am no longer bullish on this company￼￼
"I am looking at Consulting companies that have cloud exposure and that I think will grow. Trying to get a handle on how much of CNDT is based on Cloud. I took a look at Rackspace, but they are over 1.x in Sales with 4B in debt, which makes this look extremely cheap. I still think we can get to 1x Sales in 1 year which would put SP close to $21."
"This is a tough prediction, not really enough volume today to make me feel the seller is finished, but there was a large print at 359:50 and it is the end of the month so my guess and that is all it is a guess the selling is over. We will know tomorrow. stock still in an uptrend long term. short term it could be choppy. good luck to all and it was interesting the last half hour. there were 15 trades of 10,000 shares or more. not bad for a low priced stock which trades almost by appointment."
New upgrade 6 price target
Easy 10 to 12 dollar stock. Hoping for the continued trend upward !
CNDT stock could very well open at $5.00 or more tomorrow! CNDT management has done an excellent job increasing revenue by signing up new clients but reducing expenses as well.
Today they announced they formed another committee what does that mean to current stockholders absolutely nothing all he could do is increase payroll expenses there’s a lot of publicity released by this company making me suspicious sometimes too much smoke and mirrors I see nothing adding to the bottom line when will we see that I’m holding a large position i’ve been bullish just don’t want to see more nothing information being released about this company if I see more they might be going down the road of pump and dump can’t wait to see the new short figures for April￼￼￼
"stock trading in the after hours much higher, top was 5.35 and it can't be because zacks upgraded from sell to hold either news coming or seller is complete. around 50,000 share buyer at 5:25pm and filled but not in one shot which is a good sign."
Long term
We now know some of this selling is because the short figures up 25% month over month but that’s only part of the selling
"Conduent Incorporated (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”) announced that it has decided not to proceed at this time with its previously announced intention to replace its Credit Agreement Term Loan due 2022, Credit Agreement Term Loan due 2023, and Senior Revolving Credit Facility. The Company has determined, based on the combination of deal structure and market conditions, to postpone refinancing efforts in order to pursue a more optimal outcome at a later point in time. (SEC FİLİNG) 27.05.2021"
"Not a pretty day today for CNDT. The buyer is trying to keep it above seven with nice size orders between 10 and 20,000 shares to no avail he runs it up the seller kicks it back down if he was smart he would make a stand and not run it up it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see this seller will not run out anytime soon. The market usually tells you things at this point I don’t believe a good learning report is coming if so the conference call will not be too positive it probably means the second half will be better than the first. With this market and the seller being there holding seven could be the impossible dream hope I’m wrong what direction is down keep the faith everyone￼￼￼￼￼"
"Good morning looks like a real good market today if you were thinking of adding to your position be careful the seller was there yesterday if you look at the stock around 3:45 PM you will notice the offering size at 7 1/8 the offering size what is 4500 at 7 1/4 the offering size was 5000 at seven and three eights the offering size was 10,000 and that 7 1/4 the offering size was 40,000 I did not see that stock trade don’t know if he comes back today he might let it go higher and scale into it which makes everybody happy he will get more stock off that way don’t be afraid if the stock goes up and you miss it you have a position anyway I am not saying don’t buy I am Saying be careful with your money￼￼￼￼"
How is everyone feeling about CNDT earnings coming up later today?
Continued ramp in new business signings and a divestiture and CNDT is at $5. Roughly a $1bn in equity and 1.2bn in net debt with 400mm + in EBITDA and growing. It'll still be inexpensive and well below comps.
For when is the next quarter announcement date? anyone.
"as we all can see the selling is not over, yesterday at the close a bid for 1011 was hit at 3:59 and last print was for 61mplus. this is a large seller in the millions since it's been going on for weeks. looks like the seller is scaling up instead of hitting it down into the 4 range. I hope the buyer would wait the seller out and not push it up too high, the old cat and mouse game. Seller who owns millions of shares? Carl Icahn owns a large amount which he received from xerox spinoff. he sold hertz as low as 60cents last year for a huge amount of loss,it would bother me quite a bit if it turns out to be him,since if the the stock goes from 5 to 6 it's a 20% gain for the year and that's good for any investor. besides he has a great investment team working for him. just a thought."
We have volume stock is up got to see the seller is finished makes for a good week I’m sure it is resistance at eight those round numbers are always difficult to go through but that’s fine￼
Up we go
I I guess all of us will have to live with low volume until a catalyst comes along. If the seller could live with it it means he’s basically over if anybody knows what rate of interest The company was paying on the debt they refinanced please let us know. It would be nice if they were able to reduce the rate￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
"It’s been a nice first hour of trading problem is only 67,000 shares Hope heavier volume comes in because at this rate it will not make the seller happy he will not be able to trade much stock and we all know what that means and if it continues The best strategy would be sell in the morning bye back near the close, I am not a day trader but if you could ring the register why not￼￼￼￼"
IMO CNDT as of late has caught the attention and interest of the hedge/mutual funds. It wouldn't be a surprise to find CNDT stock rise to $22 by the end of the year. At the current stock price it is a real bargin.
What a Great country we live in specially when everything comes together for a stock hopefully this partnership with Mercedes was not included in the earnings call so we can have higher sales for this year￼￼
"This down turn gives everyone the chance to purchase more shares if you are bullish for the long term. I purchased 1000shares yesterday at $7.30 and another 1000shares at $6.95 today, just adding to my position. this stock wants to go higher but market conditions dictates when it will happen."
Any idea who sold 12.74M shares at 2:07pm on 5/9 at $7.66/share?
when is this Dog going to hunt?
So basically after 2 blow out qtrs we are flatWish I understood this oneBasically no move at allAny clue on why?
"Interesting day today it looked like the seller was cleaned up stock went up like a rocket stalled at $5.24 the seller had 30,000 for sale there it was around 20,000 at 5:25 another 30,000 at 5:26 can’t tell you after that stock jump to 529 that was around 230 pm seller is still alive and a stock was pounded And the market was up so we can’t say the market fell and the stock went with it there was a lot of stock trading five thousand 10000 thousand shares and the bid size and offer a ring size did not change which meant stock was crossed with the seller. I have to admit I was licking my chops as the stock was flying up only to be disappointed but the good thing stock did move up and a lot of stock had to be cleaned up. Sure hope the market stays good so the buyer doesn’t pull away i’m Bullish And in it for the long run but it’s so much nicer when it goes higher good luck everyone￼￼￼￼"
"someone was trying to hold the price down to accumulate shares under 4 for weeks, no more next stop 7 before Xmas"
Just picked up 2000 additional at 3 1/4 take a shot for a bounce next week have to believe Carl will take them private at this level if it stays down here time will tell I have to be bullish at this level￼￼ have to see what comes out of the conference next week￼
Finally broke the $7 resistance
Did anyone see anynews on why the large haircut CNDT took on friday ??
CNDT is significantly undervalued. Under accumulation by savvy investors for the rest of the year! ! !
Any positive news and this rockets.
Solid EBITDA improvement
"All fundamentals: good news, solid volume, insider transactions, and future opportunities in a COVID environment lead me to believe CNDT is about to surge higher. I’m feeling good about this small cap company right now. It could double very soon...."
"WELL GUYS, 5$++ TOMORROW, STRONG EARNINGS, STRONG PERFORMANCE. THIS IS A 10$+ STOCK"
The stock has stopped trading I hope the volume picks up because the seller will want to sell stock today and he will and we know what that means lower pricing￼
"More than the excellent results, it seems that conduent has the right team now in place which is clearly evident in the turn arround this quarter. Right team is the most important factor for investors for long terms wealth generation. This is exactly what hapenned with AMD as well. After more than 50 years wealth destruction in AMD history with so many executives came and gone, then came Dr. Lisa Su and then rest is history.Hold on to Cliff !"
"SEEKING ALPHA wrote an excellent analysis regarding CNDT on January 19, 2021 Any investor consideringpurchasing CNDT should/must read the SEEKING ALPHA analysis!"
"The stock ticked up nicely this morning￼ on very light volume which says there were no sellers out there with the exception of the one we have been living with stock usually closes higher at the end of the week should be interesting there is a bid at $7.10 for 30,000 shares I wonder if the seller will hit it down there today if the volume does not pick up. Trading in the stock is almost like watching paint dry have a good day folks action starts around 3 o’clock￼￼￼￼"
$6+ Monday
Any ideas on the market open? How we looking you think?I’m thinking short term may b tough but next few weeks we slowly climb back up
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Thetraderguide.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
"Long and strong since $1.94, will not sell CNDT for less than double digit share price."
Just saw CNDT published on the daily alert watchlist at (https:// www.tradenow.xyz)
"Check out Vector vest you can get a free report on CNDT with out joining. Might be one of the reasons for pressure on the stock SHORT term. CNDT could be a great company, fair value much better than the current price."
"buy and hold this is not the stock to daytrade, takeover is 90% possible, business is on huge upswing and bight future, it is selling for less the book, probably best play in the market today"
IMO CNDT is going to $8.00 by the end of the year!
I wonder has Trilliums open letter started to gain traction on the board now?
"CEO bought 100k worth of common yesterday (out of his own pocket, not a stock award)...... doesn't hurt any does it?"
"CNDT is a misunderstood story due to the stock underperformance over the last 2 plus years, New management has created a new culture, replaced key executives, and improved service levels. For example, after replacing the chief revenue officer in Oct 2019 and creating a new go to market, CNDT has signed new business in the first half of 2020 which equals all of 2019. Pretty incredible in such a short time. Overall, the stock trades for a multiple of 4.5x EBITDA vs competitors at 10-15x. Their leverage is 2.6x (low) and they'll create cash throughout the rest of 2020. Revenues should start to grow in the back half of 2021 as these new business signings come on and margins will grow due to increased revenue and the permanent cost cuts currently being implemented.Short-term catalyst would be a divestiture and stock repurchase plan which (depending on what they sell) could see the stock double in a day. This is a $15 stock."
Decent action today. We have a reasonable chance to hit the upper 3.90s before the ER. Shorts are being very brave so far.
1b revenue = 20$+ easy
"Total Contract Value of signings: $623M (strongest quarter since spin1), up 90% year-over-year and 92% quarter-over-quarter"
Insiders buying shares!!! Good sign!!!!
Any news here?
"Again Friday 1, million shares trades at the close, after close 600,000 additional traded where is all of this stuff coming from I thought we were cleaned up last week I hope I only missed by a week and we might be finished we will see this week with what happens￼￼￼"
 $6 coming
What is happening to this stock? It goes down to 3.20s then back to 3.60s???
Triple digit CNDT stock price increase would be a nice surprise and plus going forward!
Activism if constructive for management can drive long term value. No reason why CNDT which has over $1 billion in revenue is priced so low. Icahn and others can clean house if necessary and light a fire to move things along. The trend looks positive now. God Bless and stay well all.
"CNDT is a buyout target - this is Icahn's specialty when he takes an activist interest (or takes major ownership)It's a fairly stable and boring stock but for those who plan to hold this for the next 6 months, it'll see the $5-$6's on a buyout (maybe even higher)."
They had a good conference call company is in the beginning stages of growing and becoming a growth company CFO is leaving next month now I know where the selling came from they have a large contract they will be announcing 178 million in Europe The fact that he stated it on the conference call Must be knowledge a lot of people have this stock will work higher in the future￼￼￼￼￼. It’s not an easy start to accumulate and that could be a deterrent for many institutions but it seems like a good stock to buy and hold and a lot of volume cleaned up today can’t be much more left around if there is any. ￼
Filing with the sec today about restructure Of debtGood newsNot done yet but filed it
"one has to wonder to understand that this stock has not made any progress since Aug, while the last quarter report was a blowout and they guided up while announcing numerous new contracts"
hold on to your CNDT shares. Carl Icahn owns 38 millions share.D.E Shaw Owns 3.8 millions as well.
I brought this stock a week and a half ago because of all the institutional ownership and the fact that I thought it was massively undervalued. I added more shares on the dip. I now have an average share price of 2.36. I haven’t sold one share because I truly believe this stock should be 15.00-20.00 right now and I believe it’s potential is much higher . I’ll probably sell at 20-25. This company is criminally undervalued. I think it’s be at least 15.00-20.00 in 3 months . Hoping for 10x on my investment. 36k shares
Cliff saying will meet or exceed q3 expectations !!! This can’t stay his low! Good luck everyone
"I think someone is pulling the wool over everyones eyes, i have read at least four good articles about how everyone just loves the future of CNDT, and everyone is left holding the bag as the smart money gets out, Does anyone else feel this way ?"
Don’t you just hate it when good news comes out and the sellers come out where are the buyers? Stock went from 6.90 to 6.85 in a blink of an eye. 90% of the Russell 2000 stocks are in correction territory we are almost down 20 percent since hitting a high of 8.50 ￼￼￼￼ we need for this selling to stop before the selling does￼
Nice to be back over 7.
CNDT is a stable Information Technology company with a annual revenue of over $4 Billion and growing.As the economy continues to recover CNDT revenue will increase as well as earnings. CNDT is IMOa solid long term conservative investment along with the possibility of paying dividends in the future.
"As everyone can see the seller is still around. We need to see higher volume in the stock to go up, other wise the seller will hit the bids to participate in the volume. the market maker when he gets the order has to make sure the seller gets his fair share of what has trader to keep the order. until the seller is complete no matter how long it takes. That is how it was when I was a trader and the way it has been trading seems like it is still that way. This is a tough stock to get in and out of since it just doesn't trade with volume. The best way to get out is to scale up when it trades, but near the end of the month and if the seller wants it off his books you just pound the stock until order is complete. There is a buyer and he wants it up for month end so it should be interesting tomorrow after 3 pm. keep you fingers crossed."
"this stock is waiting for news and with the lack of it seems to drift lower and no volume to help it out. What could be the news? I'll repeat myself only because the short figures jumped 25% month over month. refinancing, and why is it taking so long to get a commitment from a bank or any place else. If your books are in order. Just my guess but if anyone calls the company ask how it's going let us all know. terms have to be better this time around to help the price of the stock"
$5 PT todayBrace yourself
The sleeping giant is waking!!
Looks like seller was cleaned up Friday with a 3 1/2 million share print at close. With the seller behind us we can only expect hired days to be in front of us becoming an exciting investment looks great on a one year chart have fun still a good investment cheap stock why Chase highflyers when all we have to do is add to our position￼￼￼￼
Any idea why a lot of analysts are saying this stock will continue to go down in the next 5years?? I am looking for a good long term investment and quite like this stock! Any ideas or recommendations??
"One day last week when buying came in? Ohh You mean the Buyer. Who is this Buyer. Let's call him Buyer X, or Mr X. The guy who keeps buying shares? When will he run out of money to keep buying shares? Maybe the Buyer will be all cleaned out by July and have no more money to buy shares. What will we do when Seller X runs out of shares and Buyer X runs out of money buy July?"
"This seller is taking no prisoners he wants out in the worst way I’ve been buying on the way down and I just have to quit now I’d rather buy on the way up next week hopefully hate weekends after a large seller or just doesn’t seem to be finished I was hoping on the opening he was close to being finished when 250,000 shares printed have a good weekend folks how low it goes we’ll just have to wait and see still love this stock long-term￼￼￼"
"I'd expect a nice steady run up to earnings, which should be very positive. Think the train has started rolling."
Good financials but still not profitable. Need to turn a profitable quarter.
"for 2 quarters nothing but bulish news, tons of new contracts, yest the stock has lost over a buck since it hit 5.25 last quarterly report, bought 4K more"
CNDT $8.25 by weeks end. I called it after being an investor here for a year. GLTA
The global news wire Had an excellent news article on the company being selected by Mercedes for All of Europe￼￼
"there is a buyer for 60,000 shares at $7.21 and thats why the stock moved back up, sorry to say he bought 31000shares left with 29,200 left. smart just sitting on the bid. oops seller filled him. time 12:33"
Stock Holds well in lousy markets opportunity to buy on down days like to see stock above five and hold so institutions can get involved even though thin float. Have a hunch Carl Is adding to his position likee did xerox maybe he wants to put them back together again just a thought￼￼￼￼
CNDT new customers coming onboard will push the price of the stock higher in the short run! Don't miss the run up very shortly as the result of accumulation by hedge funds.
This is not good the seller is taking no prisoners he wants out and he doesn’t care at what price I thought 638 would have support chart shows no support. Maybe with a wipe out somebody will step up and buy the remainder but it’s hard to see good news coming out￼
The ER was solid all around. Maybe a little anti climatic because CNDT already said they would beat on earnings and we had a pretty strong run for the last 30 days.All depends on the conference call now but I think CNDT is got no where to go but up. Steady or fast is my only question
"stock not trading so the seller is hitting it down to a level where buyers will come in. how low will it take, I have an order to buy at 6 1/2 just adding and not really wanting to. This stock can't hold 7. it went there a couple of times not a good sign. news comes out sounds good but a dollar amount is NEVER attached to it. any thoughts why"
"Everything is down today. Freaking out unnecessarily about COVID-19 because it’s not reported on accurately. If you look at total new cases in April along with total deaths in April it’s massively different in terms of “death rate” than what it looks like today. Today the death rate in this past month is significantly lower than April. Because we’re well equipped now, we know what we’re doing, they treatment is so much better and so on. I expect people to wake up to these facts soon."
"time to take this baby over 5. someone accumulated a ton of shares,"
"From what I've seen with past earnings reports. Flat green performance after a huge drop (and not continuation of hard red after an earnings report) indicates an uptrend (institutions probably no longer desire to sell CNDT). I'm betting on a nicely green week, possibly even recovering last week's dip."
"Odd, but positive, action at the end of the day even though there was a lot of selling at the end of the day. Not sure we are out of the woods, yet but, so far, the price has held in the 4.60's range and has been tested multiple times. Have no idea where we are going next week but today, at least, could have been worse."
"The seller is still around there were 15,000 20,000 25,000 share Prints and immediately after there were 100 share printsTo hide the larger ones if you watch the stock the volume jumps The size does not change and the stock does not move the seller knows you just don’t hit the bids because you do not get off quantity by letting this stock rise you could make your prints this stock does not trade so you have to get it to a point where it will which was exactly what happened Friday on the opening at the close there was stock for sale. There is a smart buyer Who is cleaning up a lot of stock cheaply as possible on the chart the stock is still in an up trend and with a decent market we will do very well. But remember this stock went down a point on very little volume last week before recovering I missed the bottom frank was smart enough to pull the trigger I did the same a little early after the seven dollar close. I am sitting with a wonderful profit this year but I’m looking long-term as long as Carl Icahn has his stock I will have mine. I consider him smart money￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ and if you follow smart money you will win more often then lose. Let’s have a good week ahead but either way hold long term.￼￼"
"What am I missing? CNDT has yearly revenues of over $4B and a MK of around $750M? Again I ask, what am I missing?"
"Today could’ve been the cleanup, 659,000 shares printed after the close let’s hope so if that’s the case with all the good news that came out today we could be off to the races have a good one folks looking forward to tomorrow￼￼￼"
"Loaddeddddddd. $7 coming after earnings . It’s gonna be another blowout . Don’t forget about the 100mil of new business signed last year q1 or was it 300 mil? Over $20 in under 2 years time , mark this post"
"1% growth for past 3 month year over year is not much to hang your hat on, particularly when 6 month yoy is down and the difference is far less than changes in depreciation, litigation costs, restructuring, etc. Still a positive quarter. More sideways movement ahead. May drift up to 8 over the next quarter but don't expect too much more. Getting back to 19 is still a long way off."
another trap
I bought CNDT today because alot of insiders including CEO are buying and Carl Icahn is also a big holder. Take a look: http://openinsider.com/search?q=cndt

Nice bounce/Good volume today. Stay strong!
"with over 4 $ Billion in revenues, this company should be in the green for a long time, they need to align their expenses and devote all of their efforts to deliver profits on a bottom line, the board must demand some action fast"
Great company Read the analyst reports
"Who is loading up on CNDT now? I think they are on a solid track again and should look stronger in Q3, Q4. Could be back to the $7 - $9 range. Revenue has leveled off at $1.05 Billion per quarter / its no longer dropping. With several new major contracts signed this year the revenue could turn North. That, combined with cost cutting to return to profitability could be great news soon."
Confirmed News coming regarding a successful upgrade and multiple more contracts. Load up guys before you are too late !!!
"Major pump job - earnings was good but nowhere to justify 300m MC increase, when company is still losing money."
"The last hour we saw 533,000 shares trade. up til then only 645,000 traded all day. What does that tell us? it tells me the seller still has stock. from $6.95 to 7.03 it took trades of 10 to 25000 shares to move the stock 1cent at a time. The good thing is the seller is not hitting the bid, which he did at 7.03,7.02 and 7.01. seems stock is for sale at a price around here. soon we will be able to see whose position has decreased. stock still looks good."
Great quarter. Looking for more contracts signed in Q4 for share holder boost. Thanks guys.
This going be a money machine going forward. Looking for $10 by end of the year.
"Most undervalued stock in the market. It surely will go cross 20, 30 INSHA ALLAHHolding strongly"
"Unfortunately stock is not trading 94,000 shares traded prior to the opening so it seems the seller is back instead of selling into the rally he will hit the bids as we see. I’ll repeat stock is not trading if volumn does not pick up stock will go south.￼￼￼ Just have to complete this seller"
"I just bought in- heard and saw some unusual options activity- seems calls have spiked a bit. Small position, lets see whats what- earnings due on thursday"
"All: Very good call. Beat on all metrics and forward estimates should give good guidance from analysts. If these analysts know how to interrupt the numbers it's a no brainer to recommend buys. Unfortunately some have their own agendas and then there is always the MM's and short interest. Never a level playing field for us retail investors. I have traded for years and what amazes me is, that my pharmaceutical companies with no revenues trade at higher SP on speculation. Go figure. Stay long and don't sell your shares and make them pay the appropriate value. We have to do what we can as the retail investors to keep these thief's at bay. Thank you all for your positive input and intelligent thought process. GLTA."
"Almost 1/3 of the volume traded in the last hour 262,000 shares deal with 10,000 share trades 5000 shares trades 18,000 share trades 38,000 share trade and we saw the bids get hit from $.21-$.18 cents very little volume traded today they were size for sale at $7.23 at the close there was a seven dollar bid for 60,000 shares they knew they weren’t going to buy it the pump and dump theory I can’t see that because nobody is holding 133 million shares or anything near that we have a lot of things working in our favor yes the seller is there but it looks like we are finished with the correction small caps hopefully lead us higher. If the buyer was not so aggressive the seller will come to him regardless it was a good week for CNDT it was a good week for everyone on this site and everyone have a good weekend and let’s look forward to next week.￼￼￼￼￼￼"

"It makes absolutely zero sense for a tech company that generates 1b revenue in a single quarter to have 467m market cap. This is typical market manipulation for accumulation purposes. Carl Icahn bought millions of shares at $6, this is not a $2 stock, it's not even a $5 stock, it should be at $20 minimum. If you had bought this 8 days ago when I posted the insider activity, you should be up more than 100% today; however, I don't plan to sell any of my shares today because even at current share price, the market cap of the company is sitting at around 1b, but that's what they generate in revenue in a single quarter, does that make any sense to you? No right? then don't take that 100% gain, wait for the 1000% gain and it's coming sooner than you think."
"Yesterday the seller was alive and well at seven dollars there was 60,000 shares for sale and when that showed up stock went South not sure if he broke price, or lack of buying when he showed up. It’s a big deal refinancing it all depends on the terms hopefully reduced interest rates if not all they did was extend it to the future sounds like Congress working again￼￼￼￼￼"
average volume for this stock 2million shares
IMO it appears that investors are worried about the resurgence of the virus(s) and the impact it may or may not have have on the economies. They seem to be selling off or staying on the sidelines for the time being.
Massive moves in the market all weekAnd we are up pennies with no volumeI think it’s a sign to move on
"Simple good company, deals and significant growth"
"Many hedge funds are already invested here and some with an average of $6 - $10 and higher, they are happy to hold. We are therefore presented with a bargain. I will continue to buy at this price."
"19,000 shares for sale at 388 cleaned up in one trade stock going higher￼"
Keep in mind that whenever the new stimulus package is passed the economy as whole will benefit.CNDT will definitely be rewarded in severa ways from the increased revenue pumped into the states as a whole.While investors might be tempted to take profits from this short run up. IMO many investors will be rewarded for their patience in the long run.
Carl Icahn just picked up 6 mil shares.
Dont you just love owning a stock making a new low everyday ?
CNDT reportedly was priced at $23 less than three years ago. With 4 Billion in revenue CNDT IMO isa great long term investment with the possibility of paying a dividend as well.
"OMG, breaking news, billionaire Carl Icahn sent one of his dog to join the board of CNDT, when this guy is involved, the stock usually double or triple within a year. Conduent +3.2% as it names Icahn's Gary to board for settlement https://seekingalpha.com/news/3606903"
I would like to believe the selling is over the way the stock is acting $7.20 the only problem is I’ve been burnt before even though everything worked out fine since I purchased lower there is very little Volume today￼ so I believe I won’t have to wait too long for the seller if he is alive to stop the advance and hit the bid i’m sure he did not take this Friday off most of the volume will be after 3 o’clock Good luck everyone if he is complete stock could close quite well￼￼￼￼
"Despite CNDT dropping 0.70 management, Seeking Alpha and others view CNDT as a solid long term investment for the patient investor! Hopefully, the economy will begin to stabilize in the coming months. Additionally, with the feds pumping money into the country as well will only bring about increased institutional investment into companies like CNDT."
We are not out of the woods if the seller is the big guy don’t think it is but if it is going nowhere for quite a while

"Key HighlightsRevenue above Company expectations despite COVID-19 impactBusiness continuity planning successful with approximately 75% of associates working-from-homeContinuing to serve as trusted partner and meet client expectations throughout the crisisIncreased health and safety measures for associatesAdapting transformation plan beginning with immediate focus on post-COVID-19 cost savings initiativesIncreased new business signings by 44% vs Q1 2019FLORHAM PARK, NJ, May 7, 2020 - Conduent (NASDAQ: CNDT), a business process services and solutions company, today announced its first quarter 2020 financial results.Cliff Skelton, Conduent CEO, stated “Throughout this global crisis, we have continued to provide critical services to our clients, while ensuring the health and safety of our associates and keeping our company strong. We have been able to move approximately 75% of our associates to a remote work environment amidst the COVID-19 crisis while meeting very important commitments to our clients and their millions of end-users. In addition, while we are operating in this new hybrid environment, we have been able to implement measures recommended by the CDC and the WHO for those performing essential work in our facilities, while at the same time continuing to deliver at service levels expected by our clients, evidenced by client feedback and our operating performance.” Skelton continued, “Meanwhile, we understand that these are very trying times for many, including our associates who have been exemplary throughout this crisis. We want to extend our best wishes and concerns to our many stakeholders and partners who may have been adversely affected. We remain confident that while likely different, a new and even better horizon is around the corner.”Q1 2020 Performance CommentaryThe Company’s business continuity program enabled teams to respond quickly to COVID-19 impacts and ensure sustained client delivery. However Q1 2020 performance was impacted by COVID-19 with volume reductions in our Transportation, Transaction Processing, and Customer Experience solutions resulting in an approximately $14 million revenue impact. Conduent expects this volume pressure and associated profit impacts to continue in Q2 2020. The Q1 2020 COVID-19 impacts were partially offset by volume increases in the Government Healthcare and Payments businesses and the Company expects these volume tailwinds to continue in Q2 2020 given the scope of the government programs that it supports.The Company continued to show operational improvement with sustained, meaningful improvement in technology incidents and time to resolution. Conduent is now in the planning stage for migration to the ‘new normal’ operating model, which will allow for maximum workplace flexibility and Real Estate optimization.Additional highlights from Q1 include strong sales performance with $324 million in new business signings, a 44% increase over Q1 2019, primarily driven by sales to new clients or new capabilities to existing clients.From a client and partnership point of view, Conduent launched a new COVID-19 version of its Maven disease surveillance and outbreak management platform. Along with hosting partnerships with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, the platform is being used by public health agencies and could potentially be used by commercial organizations to manage and report on cases and potential exposures of COVID-19. It is also helping these agency professionals save time and resources by streamlining the contact tracing requirements associated with COVID-19.Conduent is well positioned for improvements in growth, efficiency and quality as the ramp back to normal from the COVID-19 crisis takes place.Key Financial First Quarter 2020 ResultsRevenue of $1,051 million, down (9.2)% year-over-year.Adjusted Revenue, excluding divestitures in Q1 2019, was down (6.3)% year-over-year, or (6.0)%in constant currency.Q1 2020 GAAP net loss of $(49) million compared to $(308) million in Q1 2019.Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impact of divestitures, was $96 million, down year-over-year primarily driven by the decline in revenue, impact of COVID-19 and non-recurring cost items. Adjusted EBITDA margin also excluding divestitures, was 9.1%, down (180) bps year-over-year.Pre-tax income was ($51) million compared to ($338) million in Q1 2019.Diluted EPS from continuing operations was ($0.24) versus ($1.49) in the same period last year.Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.05 compared to $0.14 in Q1 2019.Cash outflow from operations was $(192) million during Q1 2020 compared to cash outflows of$(49) million in Q1 2019. Adjusted Free Cash Flow, which excludes the impact of Texas Litigation payment and other adjustments, was an outflow of $(97) million during Q1 2020.As a precautionary measure, the Company borrowed $150 million from its revolving credit line in March 2020."
whats happening with this now? why such a drop from 2 days??
this company lost most of clients already...the growth from past 2 two years was from laying off employees.https://www.thelayoff.com/conduent
should be a good day.. but no matter what this is a long term stock.. will double with in the year..
Excellent news release this AM
"there is more then 50% chance this company will be taken out with a merger, over 4B in revenues, 3 profitable quarters and unguided selling below book and under 1B"
"We will all have to wait for the conference call if it’s not positive and if the earnings do not meet projections then everyone should try to participate and ask the question why did not the company give an update of the quarter like a lot of companies do? There has been a lot of pressure on the stock and evidently somebody knew something this company could lose their credibility on the street and with the stockholders. They did not refinance there debt, did not state why to the public but information had to get out. I am hoping it does not get to this point but the stockholders have got to participate in the call.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼"
I’m still loading up . Next week gonna be epic
Can’t find a reason for the stock acting this way other than the seller wants out tired of hanging around and maybe we will see a final print which would be wonderful ￼
"don't get shaken out for pennies, once it breaks 5 institutions will rush in"
"Me 2 days ago:""Decent action today. We have a reasonable chance to hit the upper 3.90s before the ER. Shorts are being very brave so far.""I really was not expecting to break 4 before earnings so this is great.Still not seeing a lot of short covering.Tonight will all come down to forward guidance.This is set pop hard if we get good guidance.I am guessing decent guidance is worth $5.25+"

Still buying stock on the five have a large position 12,000 shares taking a shot trying to make this is a wonderful year hope I’m right￼￼￼￼"
"That print at the end of the day hopefully is the end of the seller 990,000 shares￼"
Does anybody know why the PPS is going down ? Bad news ?
"One final note: one Hedge Fund in particular thought CNDT has been extremely undervalued as of late. With the solid earnings report and the recent signup of new business and the concerted effort to reduce expenses CNDT should be recognized as a solid investment for the future,"
Considering how bad today could’ve been. Not bad here! She’s holding up!
IMO CNDT investors/mutual funds are being too conservative regarding the Price Per Share in the foreseeable future. CNDT was trading at $23 about two and half year ago when it first was listed. CNDT will again become recognized as a worthwhile investment by individuals/mutual funds/stock advisors and so forth which will bring about a higher Price Per Share.bring about a higher stock market price.
JP Morgan upgraded stock this morning from 8 to 9$
Great news today
Stock is trading at 5:25 a share this morning does anybody know something a lot of analyst like to get in front of a stock prior to their earnings let’s hope we hear of one.￼
This is the most undervalued company I own and that will be corrected in time
more insider buying
Do i see insiders buying?
Quiet opening for the first time in a while stock did not open down from the close. The buyer is cautious this morning not knowing where the seller comes in took him a long time to figure that out. I guess we are all lucky that we have a good market can you imagine where the stock would be if the market was correcting. Like Frank said we wait and good luck￼￼￼￼￼￼
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4379941-cost-cutting-and-revamped-sales-process-improve-outlook-for-conduent?mod=mw_quote_news
Who is this seller when will he be done I guess we have to wait until July to get the buyers and the sellers of size when they file otherwise it’s only guessing but there’s been a large seller for those who follow charts.￼. Where is support I am guessing but when I look at the chart it’s around &7.68. Even though the stock has been going higher over the weeks the seller knows if you just hit the bids you really don’t get much stock off. Come Friday will see if the stock closes above $7.15 to keep it uptrend in tact let’s get peoples opinions where support is. There was one day last week when buying came in I’m sure it just wasn’t a one day situation the seller is trying to bring them back for more and if that’s the case he has a lot more to go I do believe six months from now stock will be much higher making this a great investment at this level I have a large position but I am nibbling stay strong￼￼￼￼￼￼
Well this was a really nice pop pre earnings.Good luck all. 30 minutes from now we will be laughing or crying
The trend is your friend and I believe the trend just flipped on this one. From $23 per share in 2018 to less than $2.00 /share in 2020. The positive Q2 result should bring this ticker back to life...particularly in a market that is flooded with over-valued companies. CNDT is a bargain under $5 per share.
"good thing: FCF positive, revenue up. bad thing, not up fast."
"does anyone know when earnings are due? I tried calling company and they answered in the Caribbean and could not get transferred to the correct area. not a good sign anyway seller is alive and selling small lots 5up to 10,000 shares at a time when he can. will he let it close higher today? my guess is yes, not near 7 like we would all like."
Upside earning surprise(3Q's) and stock buyback on its way. About time!
It does without saying that there is much to digest regarding CNDT going forward. Just the other day Seeking Alpha wrote a very favorable analysis of CNDT Then SCHWAB downgrades CNDT just before earnings announcement. Today there was lots of downward pressure on CNDT. IMO CNDT management will bring about positive earnings and CNDT investors will be rewarded accordingly.
As any investor can see that there is definite interest in CNDT bringing about stock appreciation!
It appears that CNDT is under accumulation by knowledgeable investors.
CNDT stock may see a triple digit stock appreciation today after today's announcement!~
This news must've come out late in AH trading? Can't wait to see how it is in pre-market as it could run hard tomorrow. Much better swing than $CNDT
Largest shareholder just sold 600MM of HLF and floated another 750MM of debt. Stay strong!
"seller seems to be scaling up which can help as long as he is selling stock. We know what happens when it stops he hit the bid. He sold 5000 share at 6.80 also 6.82, 6.85 he has 7500 shares for sale6.85 we see the volume picking up and that is a good sign. one could only hope he is close to completing his order. round numbers are always hard to go thru (6.90)"
I am not a chartist but I’m not bad at it and this is the perfect stock too short there is just no support underneath those with more knowledge than me please look at it and tell us where support may be I also tell you watch the size of the market the last half hour . The offering size keeps growing volume prints 20 times the offering size and the stock doesn’t move there’s just too much for sale at the moment tomorrow he probably will let it go up a little sort of by it doesn’t walk away which she should. The buyer if he moves it up a nickel or a dime should not go higher but try to hold that game for the day he uses his gun powder way to early just hold the gain any kind of gain. I hope some people lightened up a little I just don’t like seeing people losing money sometimes the market talks to you by the way it’s trading. It’s not a September issue Frank I brought up some good issues with the filing doesn’t mean the right but they just may not be wrong￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
CEO and Chairman bought some stock. Form 4s are out.
"56,000 shares for sale at 386 which were purchased in one trade somebody building a position in stock not aggressive letting stock come in what shows up when quantity is for sale tells me hold my 6000 shares and see where it takes me I have a target of 10 and will wait I am a buyer at 360 my orders are in FTC. I had NIO and sold at seven hindsight is 2020 big mistake on my part should’ve kept at least 1000 stay long keep fingers crossed company turning around￼￼￼￼￼￼"
Needham just put pride target to 7Cannot paste and copy hereLook it upJust came outGoogle cndt needham
IMO Mutual/Hedge Fund companies are pushing back the CNDT short sellers! Indications are that CNDT stock will see a considerable rise in the next few weeks.
Buying more here! Too much of a drop
Zacks has a buy rating.. and a VGM A rating .

Stock showing good Volume so far this morning seems to be plenty of selling also but the good long term effect. The stock is going into new investors probably with a long term objective which should bode well for a future increases in the stock. Insider purchasing￼￼￼￼￼￼ usually is an indication of good things to come this stock after the last earnings report should not sell below seven let’s all have a good day and it’s good to know Frank will be keeping his stock￼￼￼
just few minutes before it beat the yahoo target of $ 6.17. its time for a new target. $15 in next few months.
Hopefully this wipes the seller out. Crazy to dump 220k shares at 6.8 when opened at 6.95
"Yesterday was a good day for the stock,540,000 shares traded in the last 20 minutes, was the seller cleaned up? as long as the stock ticks up who cares. Always the last hour is when the action comes. In the morning it's nice to see the stock going up even if it goes back down because as it goes up it cleans up open orders on the books that could have been there for a long time and when the buying begins later near the close it can move quicker like yesterday. I will wait to see the stock close above 8 before I add to my position."

"Done a lot of home work on this company. Management needs to WAKE UP. Stock will explode if management just wakes up and unlocks the huge, huge potential in front of them."
Out of my 52 stocks in my portfolio this one is holding up the best....who'd a thunk?
I am fraily surprised that short covering has not picked up since earnings are Thursday and last ER burnt shorts really really hard. Remember a few weeks ago the CEO said CNDT will meet or exceed earnings. A pop above 4 seems inevitable this week.
Clearly the shares want to run..the market keeps dragging ..hopefully it floored at 6.50
Time to buy (I assume).
Be careful of that cat bounces as far as I can see the selling is not over and the short selling is not over until some kind of news comes out but that’s my opinion and I will cut my position on good days and hope I’m wrong because I built up a position that was just too risky fortunately I did cut it in half before I just don’t see A catalyst in the near future to go back to 7 1/2￼￼￼￼￼￼
I’ll take Under $2 all year long. No rush here . Company ain’t going anywhere they have their hand in everything
Stock is trading higher this morning￼ market is higher problem is seller owns the close The middle and the opening he allows the stock to go higher to make sales if stock does not look like it’s going to trade at least 1 million shares he hits it lower to force it to trade the other morning it went to 7 1/4 only to get hit. You could see the stock wants to go higher it’s all up to him let’s hope he runs out of stock sometime soon have a good day and a wonderful weekend let it close a little higher keeping The buyer coming back for more it would be nice if an institution would step up and buy the remainder and that is not the case since he keeps selling at this point￼￼￼￼
Looks like refi going through..lets hope it moves up frm here
when you see a 6 1/2 million share print you usually have it on a cleanup of the seller. when he comes back the next day like this one probably did the buyer will step away and let it go down just like it is doing and reach a level where other buyers and retail step up and chip away until the seller is finished. I believe this is what is happening right now. I am speaking with knowledge of the market.
You read nothing but good news on this company but the stock continues to slide only nine days to Earnings￼
The market makers recognize CNDT as a company that will in the long run become a steady income producing company within one to two years. The result for those investors that are patient will be a company that may provide a dividend and stock appreciation as well in the $12 to $22 range.
CNDT shorting covering may push the stock price to $5.23 today!
"Needham analyst Mayank Tandon maintained a Buy rating on Conduent (NASDAQ:CNDT) Inc on Friday, setting a price target of $7, which is approximately 21.11% above the present share price of $5.78. Tandon expects Conduent Inc to post earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.04 for the first quarter of 2021."
CNDT with renewed increase could perhaps move up along with the rest of the market to around $10 to $11 PPS.
Nice AH jump to 7 though
"Good morning I haven’t posted only because the seller is alive and well he will be around only because the stock is not trading , we would average over 1 million shares this week it’s like the buyer is taking a sabbatical The stock usually trades up on a Friday and it usually closes a couple of cents higher than the week before but with this Volume all bets are off￼￼￼￼ I guess we just have to sit it out I will eventually add to my position but I would like to see a close over eight dollars have a good weekend all and stay strong￼￼"
"SCHWAB downgrading CNDT IMO is due to the awful weather back EAST. Addtionally, it gives institutional investors an opportunity to buy CNDT at a much low price IF SCHWAB downgrade impacts the stock price in the short run. Conversely , STOXLINE positive analysis gives CNDT a buy signal and sees a higher stock price in the near future. That stated CNDT will announce earnings this week on February 18th."
Whatever happens tomorrow good luck to you all
If you watch level 2You can see Goldman sell 2700 at 7.15 and have a buy order in for 2700 shares at 7Over snd over Like I said it’s price manipulation They are keeping it down for a reasonWhen they are done this will compose to the upside
@ the end of the day this company has now become an interesting buy out candidate. 2 Q's doesn't make a trend but a good start. Going much higher. Rates will remain low for the foreseeable future.
Great rally let’s close the market here and walk away with a plus day. Seller not through stock not trading very high volume that is troublesome and again good news with Chicago contract problem is what does it add to the bottom line?￼￼￼
Nice performance today After all.What do you think in the short term?? In long term i know This Company could give us a lot!
I expect minimum of $6 tomorrow at the opening
Less than 4 weeks to ER. Remember CEO said he will meet or exceed expectations for the quarter. I am hoping we start the drift up from here
Charles Schwab this morning downgraded Cndt to a hold. Stock doing well in this market giving you an opportunity to pick up more so much inside of buying for something not to happen have a good day investors￼
How big of a beat are we thinking this quarter? Did Conduent guide for results this quarter? Excited to hear the CC.
Retail traders love dummy companies with no earnings. No one is interested in CNDT. Poor PR by the investment division of this company. No coverage by analysts for price target increase. I am holding since long for a decent return. but this stock is not paying well. disgusted
CNDT stock up after hours trading. Mutual/Hedge funds starting to take interestregarding CNDT! !
CNDT estimated stock price in the next few months of $15 IMO is too conservative! It is not too optimistic tosee $22 in the next few months with the increase institutional/mutual fund interest and daily trading volume.After all it is projected to have 4 billion in revenue in the next year or so!
Do you think the dems getting control of the senate effect us short or long term here in cndt?
How were the earnings?
Why is it taking so long to refinance there debt? With these low interest rates it should’ve been a no-brainer unless some numbers don’t pass the bankers requirements only guessing but it is as good as any other reason why the short numbers are going higher and you can’t fight the shorts they win if the stock goes lower they sell more if the stock goes higher and this is a stock that is difficult to cover due to the lack of trading You just don’t short a stock that trades by appointment but this one is being shorted￼￼￼￼
I’m thinking the selling is over the volume has picked up and the stock is holding .Now all we have to do is wait for either good news or bad news but the buyer will be buying and moving the stock back up let’s hope I’m right but the market seems to be indicating the way it’s trading now￼
"Am I missing something? A spinoff of Xerox that got rid of sleepy management and has revamped its salesforce - which proved to be a success according to last earnings report. Involved in a sector that's geared towards companies becoming more efficient - save money, time and effort. DE Shaw and Ichan just a few of the the buyers at years end. FYI: DE Shaw makes no mistakes, simply one of the brightest and best employees at this 'under the radar' firm. This could easily be a double this year. I'm in!"
"It was 150,000 shares for sale at $4.10 cleaned up at close at $4.08. Stock going higher￼￼"
Carl Icahn owns 10% of the company maybe he’ll just take them private he did buy 1 million shares the last time the stock collapsed you have to hold here what could your downside be less than four points￼￼
Well I guess the selling is not over just decided not to hit the bids too low. With all the short stocks going up people are dumping their long positions we will just have to wait it out I keep thinking Carl Icahn He’s selling some of his position this is too much stock being sold to be anyone else just have to wait and see who won loaded their positions￼￼￼
Added 1000 shares at 6.73 this morning will buy an additional thousand at $6.70 if it gets hit again stock is in an uptrend so I’m comfortable￼￼￼￼
"no volume today and all the action comes after 3pm my guess it gets hit at the end of day. I would love to be wrong, but odds are with my guess. when seller is gone this stock wants to go higher."
"How come people buy very overvalued stocks but not this one? Doesn't anyone care about fundamentals anymore? This company generates billions of money and here we are, share price under 2. Something is very wrong with market efficiency!"

"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now .

Clearly its turned in the right direction.. these prices are a steal.. stock is definitely worth minimum of 10..if not more.. strong back to back earnings.. if these institutions really want out.. they must need cash and should not be a reflection on cndt.. but a position on them
Hop on board folks Charles Schwab has an A rating on stock Zacks has a buy rating. Yahoo has a 525 target. Looks like a long term hold maybe it goes back to 20 after all Carl is not selling his stock. Stay on board folks. It’s amazing good ratings on such a cheap stock￼￼￼￼￼￼
Do you think we’ll ever see 22$ again? Lol
"I figured the seller has been cleaned up there was some large prints which indicates the cleanup. I did add to my position figuring end of month sellers been around couple of weeks due to the fact that doesn’t trade in size and the seller has it off of his position stock ended the month where it started. Now we can move in the right direction up. I’ve been right on a large seller and it wasn’t a short seller, and I will be right on the cleanup. Let’s hope this market does not go the way January went. As they say the way January goes The market goes but that was in the old world this is a new world we live in.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼"

"It appears that Institutional/mutual funds have recently recognized CNDT as solid long term investment based on the daily volume. Furthermore, after the FEDERAL stimulus is put into play CNDT will definitely positively benefit from the improving economy with the three to six months well IMO"

CNDT stock up again this morning! Climbing that wall of worry! Is it short covering or are investors finally taking note that CNDT is indeed going to have positive earnings this year?
Today should be a good day looking at level 2No large sells No low ball salesShould have room to finally run a little
What happened ? Why dumped ?
"1.5 million shares bought at the close @4.48, who sold today look in the mirror"
"300,000 shares trade in the last hour unfortunately looks like it’s not over for us unless we see a large print prior to Monday’s opening good luck folks keep your fingers crossed because something Hass to be wrong and this seller Has to be the one that started at 8 1/2 if he is he sold millions of shares and there are not too many holders that have the size we are seeing￼￼"
Breakout to over 5. Had to buying yesterday from Mr Icahn. My target 7-8
CNDT significant stock volume and price today demonstrates IMO increased investor interest and investment in CDNT. CNDT stock is up slightly after hours trading. This to me highlights a very bullish aura regarding CNDT stock
"If you are selling today to take profit, then you have alot to learn about the stock market. CNDT generates 4.4b revenue/year and revenue per share is at $20.76. Do you seriously think they are worth less than $4/share with market cap of less than 1b? Carl Icahn bought millions of shares of CNDT at price range of $6 - $9, company insiders are buying from $1.80 to $8, do you seriously think you know more about the price of this stock than the insiders and billionaires? Institutional Ownership of this company is at 78.27%, they are holding this for the long haul and you will regret it when this goes to $20, $30, $40, $50...."
This filing asks a lot of questions 1. Why didn’t they check the box it’s an emerging growth company. ￼2. At least the possibility that they will not be successful in restructuring the debt. ￼3. How much debt are we talking about￼￼￼￼ and what interest-rate. ￼4. If city has a good write up on the company why don’t they use them to refinance? 5. Did they try to restructure four months ago and work unable to since that’s when the selling really started. There is a a lot of uncertainty and Wall Street does not like uncertainty. I believe all of this selling is two to the restructuring and what happens if they are not successful?￼ ￼ everything we read about this company is good I wish Zacks would stop writing about them and is somebody hiring a publicity company to help pump this company up? It’s been done before not saying that it’s happening now because I do have a large position and I am holding but the market is telling everyone the prudent thing would be do not carry a large position and don’t be afraid of taking a small loss￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
Did anybody hear anything about CNDT there’s a higher bid in the after hours￼￼￼
I feel bad for whoever got shook for their shares . I loaded up at $2.98-3.05. This is not a company to panic sell. I been here since 1.88 and I’ll keep telling you $13 coming in 2021. I say $9 in January
"Not really sure why the stock went up so quickly the news that was out is no big thing. To refinance their debt should have been done six months ago when rates were even lower still I really wonder if the seller really is cleaned up . He fooled me a couple of times￼￼￼ while I added and additional 5000 shares which worked out quite well. This morning there were 30,000 shares on the offering at $7.30 and in a blink of an eye was purchased we will see at the end of the day when buying comes in as usual and selling picks up. Fortunately the buyer had a little more fire power than the seller.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼"
"Frank: I agree. They are paid a tremendous amount of money to grow the company and increase shareholder value. If you can't with this companies potential, which is undervalued, than find the team who can. I have seen it with other companies."
what do people here think earnings is going to look like?
I’ve been buying the stock as it comes in currently have 5000 shares cost 3.46 i’m comfortable knowing Karl Icahn Holding more than 10% of company he has a very good track record hope he keeps up the good work￼￼
"Similar competitors like Accenture and Cognizant, CNDT reset / withdrew their 2020 revenue guidance when COVID-19 hit. However, the analysis of Conduent’s book of government and commercial business is on solid footing therefore, when earnings are announced they are most likely going to be better than expected."
"At 3:30 the seller came back and had 78,300 shares for sale had $4.87 I guess he’s not finished and they hit the bids 26,130 shares printed as low as 8 market turn south also so I don’t know if the seller is complete who it was just a market conditions that kept the stock down hopefully it goes higher tomorrow￼￼￼"
"Investment counselors of Maryland I added 600,000 shares to the holdings still waiting to see who the seller is. Let’s hope for another good day should’ve been better yesterday but green is green.￼￼"
CNDT could open ten (.10) cents higher! Investors appear to have a positive take on CNDT'S future earnings..
Cleared $3.30 resistance level on the 6 month chart - should run to $4 ++ ??
"Not a lot of opportunities like this left out there. Share price under $5 bucks, moving $1Billion + in revenue during peak of Covid crisis while posting profit of $0.05/share. Next week could be very nice for this stock with big move to the upside!!"
Don’t forget they signed $300 million of new business in the first quarter. Tomorrow’s earnings will be crucial. I think a huge surprise is coming and I’m not selling nothing
