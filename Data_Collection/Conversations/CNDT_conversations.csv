Great company Read the analyst reports
I am not a chartist but I’m not bad at it and this is the perfect stock too short there is just no support underneath those with more knowledge than me please look at it and tell us where support may be I also tell you watch the size of the market the last half hour . The offering size keeps growing volume prints 20 times the offering size and the stock doesn’t move there’s just too much for sale at the moment tomorrow he probably will let it go up a little sort of by it doesn’t walk away which she should. The buyer if he moves it up a nickel or a dime should not go higher but try to hold that game for the day he uses his gun powder way to early just hold the gain any kind of gain. I hope some people lightened up a little I just don’t like seeing people losing money sometimes the market talks to you by the way it’s trading. It’s not a September issue Frank I brought up some good issues with the filing doesn’t mean the right but they just may not be wrong￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼

400 k shares bought up ore market at 6.74Someone knows something
JP Morgan upgraded stock this morning from 8 to 9$
"I don’t believe anybody thought it was a real move yesterday the seller was there he let it rise he did sell stock in the last 10 minutes he sold his 19,000 share piece knocking it down from 708 to 706 quite a few 5 to 9000 share lots. That’s why I didn’t write anything about yesterday’s move￼￼"
"Still stock for sale 35,000 at $6.81 big pieces are being cleaned up"
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Thetraderguide.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
Stock showing good Volume so far this morning seems to be plenty of selling also but the good long term effect. The stock is going into new investors probably with a long term objective which should bode well for a future increases in the stock. Insider purchasing￼￼￼￼￼￼ usually is an indication of good things to come this stock after the last earnings report should not sell below seven let’s all have a good day and it’s good to know Frank will be keeping his stock￼￼￼
This stock going to double digits after earnings
"I guess everybody saw 1 million she’ll print at the close. You would think that would be cleaning up the seller I fell for the trick a couple of times already with the stock so I will not participate on the upside I will just stay with my position and if it goes higher like it should I’m comfortable with my 10,000 shares good luck everyone enjoy the weekend ￼￼"
Don’t you just hate it when good news comes out and the sellers come out where are the buyers? Stock went from 6.90 to 6.85 in a blink of an eye. 90% of the Russell 2000 stocks are in correction territory we are almost down 20 percent since hitting a high of 8.50 ￼￼￼￼ we need for this selling to stop before the selling does￼
I hope the article by Zacks yesterday doesn’t stop all buying in the stock until after earnings if that’s the case the stock will go lower amazing how some people have information and others don’t not even the company Companies do pronounce￼￼￼ at times￼
Be careful of that cat bounces as far as I can see the selling is not over and the short selling is not over until some kind of news comes out but that’s my opinion and I will cut my position on good days and hope I’m wrong because I built up a position that was just too risky fortunately I did cut it in half before I just don’t see A catalyst in the near future to go back to 7 1/2￼￼￼￼￼￼
If you think the earnings Are going to miss￼ maybe you should sell some thing if you like the company long term. Buy it back cheaper somebody is selling a lot of stock they have this information the shorts will Cover lower because this is not a stock You want to be in￼￼￼￼ when they run through the door to sell you could sit tight hope for a good conference call but it looks like stock is going lower now And it is not trading￼￼
Guess they don’t like the refi
Clearly the shares want to run..the market keeps dragging ..hopefully it floored at 6.50
Why is it taking so long to refinance there debt? With these low interest rates it should’ve been a no-brainer unless some numbers don’t pass the bankers requirements only guessing but it is as good as any other reason why the short numbers are going higher and you can’t fight the shorts they win if the stock goes lower they sell more if the stock goes higher and this is a stock that is difficult to cover due to the lack of trading You just don’t short a stock that trades by appointment but this one is being shorted￼￼￼￼
Earnings announced nov 4 after the bell. Let’s go!
Filing with the sec today about restructure Of debtGood newsNot done yet but filed it
"this stock is waiting for news and with the lack of it seems to drift lower and no volume to help it out. What could be the news? I'll repeat myself only because the short figures jumped 25% month over month. refinancing, and why is it taking so long to get a commitment from a bank or any place else. If your books are in order. Just my guess but if anyone calls the company ask how it's going let us all know. terms have to be better this time around to help the price of the stock"
Nice combo of no volume and selling into earnings lol
when is this Dog going to hunt?
A large block of stock traded this morning you would think it would be a cleanup except there is still a lot of stock around 5000 share pieces hopefully they’ll buy all of that you would think the stock will close higher because if you can buy a block you should be able to keep the stock above water for the day. It would be nice if it goes higher today time will tell ￼￼￼
Volume dried up seller hit the stock. Hope the buyer understands and pulls back until he knows what he or she is looking at.
Nice to be back over 7.
I’m thinking the selling is over the volume has picked up and the stock is holding .Now all we have to do is wait for either good news or bad news but the buyer will be buying and moving the stock back up let’s hope I’m right but the market seems to be indicating the way it’s trading now￼
This filing asks a lot of questions 1. Why didn’t they check the box it’s an emerging growth company. ￼2. At least the possibility that they will not be successful in restructuring the debt. ￼3. How much debt are we talking about￼￼￼￼ and what interest-rate. ￼4. If city has a good write up on the company why don’t they use them to refinance? 5. Did they try to restructure four months ago and work unable to since that’s when the selling really started. There is a a lot of uncertainty and Wall Street does not like uncertainty. I believe all of this selling is two to the restructuring and what happens if they are not successful?￼ ￼ everything we read about this company is good I wish Zacks would stop writing about them and is somebody hiring a publicity company to help pump this company up? It’s been done before not saying that it’s happening now because I do have a large position and I am holding but the market is telling everyone the prudent thing would be do not carry a large position and don’t be afraid of taking a small loss￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
Hopefully this wipes the seller out. Crazy to dump 220k shares at 6.8 when opened at 6.95
Does anybody know why the PPS is going down ? Bad news ?
Looks like refi going through..lets hope it moves up frm here
Did anybody hear anything about CNDT there’s a higher bid in the after hours￼￼￼
CEO and Chairman bought some stock. Form 4s are out.
Hopefully next weeks earnings report will be positive and the PPS will increase and stay there .
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"
We now know some of this selling is because the short figures up 25% month over month but that’s only part of the selling
Today should be a good day looking at level 2No large sells No low ball salesShould have room to finally run a little
"I'm very positive on CNDT for a few reasons:1) The company has signed 3.1bn of new business within the last 18 months. This takes time to come on the P&L and initially starts to ramp at a lower margin, but gradually increases.2) The company has stated in the past that they're signing higher margin new business (again this will take time to show on the P&L)3) We are getting towards the end of attrition from legacy losses in 2019 and prior. The CFO states on last conf call ""And then secondly, there's the components of the legacy losses...we're really starting now to get into, what I call, the thin end of the wedge of those legacy losses. We haven't quantified them in terms of their overall number. But the number this year was more than twice as big last year, and the number next year is going to be half the size of this year. And the number in 2023 is going to be half the size of 2022.""As we burn through these legacy losses and new business starts to ramp, you will have revenue growth, margin expansion and increased free cash flow (FCF will also increase from less restructuring exp and more normalized capex). 4) The company has been investing in technology and training to improve service levels, which I believe you are seeing in the new business signings. For example, they signed $775mm in new business in 2Q:21 compared to all of 2019 when they signed just $996mm. 5) CNDT has long-term relationships, play in a large market with minimal share, has a very large opportunity to cross-sell their services and remove pain points for their clients. 6) Debt has been refinanced. 3Q is just another blip in the road (although I think it will be good simply because you had insiders buying stock in mid to late August) and I would concentrate on how they progress through 2022 (as stimulus comes off, but volumes come back due to diminishing COVID cases) and 2023."
Massive moves in the market all weekAnd we are up pennies with no volumeI think it’s a sign to move on
