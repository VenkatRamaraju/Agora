Added 1000 shares at 6.73 this morning will buy an additional thousand at $6.70 if it gets hit again stock is in an uptrend so I’m comfortable￼￼￼￼
 $6 coming
"I'd expect a nice steady run up to earnings, which should be very positive. Think the train has started rolling."
"What am I missing? CNDT has yearly revenues of over $4B and a MK of around $750M? Again I ask, what am I missing?"

Good morning maybe oh I do not want to get anybody nervous just going to give you the facts I called the company this morning the switchboard is overseas I asked for the number in New Jersey I was told by the operator they have no phone service I left a message for them to call me or email me this is not good as far as I am concerned if anybody knows how to get in touch with the main office please let me know or do so And let everybody know people have money invested in this company and that could create a major problem for them try to help each other I am no longer bullish on this company￼￼
Stock is trading higher this morning￼ market is higher problem is seller owns the close The middle and the opening he allows the stock to go higher to make sales if stock does not look like it’s going to trade at least 1 million shares he hits it lower to force it to trade the other morning it went to 7 1/4 only to get hit. You could see the stock wants to go higher it’s all up to him let’s hope he runs out of stock sometime soon have a good day and a wonderful weekend let it close a little higher keeping The buyer coming back for more it would be nice if an institution would step up and buy the remainder and that is not the case since he keeps selling at this point￼￼￼￼
"If you are selling today to take profit, then you have alot to learn about the stock market. CNDT generates 4.4b revenue/year and revenue per share is at $20.76. Do you seriously think they are worth less than $4/share with market cap of less than 1b? Carl Icahn bought millions of shares of CNDT at price range of $6 - $9, company insiders are buying from $1.80 to $8, do you seriously think you know more about the price of this stock than the insiders and billionaires? Institutional Ownership of this company is at 78.27%, they are holding this for the long haul and you will regret it when this goes to $20, $30, $40, $50...."
"Needham analyst Mayank Tandon maintained a Buy rating on Conduent (NASDAQ:CNDT) Inc on Friday, setting a price target of $7, which is approximately 21.11% above the present share price of $5.78. Tandon expects Conduent Inc to post earnings per share (EPS) of -$0.04 for the first quarter of 2021."
Easy 10 to 12 dollar stock. Hoping for the continued trend upward !
This stock going to double digits after earnings
"this stock is waiting for news and with the lack of it seems to drift lower and no volume to help it out. What could be the news? I'll repeat myself only because the short figures jumped 25% month over month. refinancing, and why is it taking so long to get a commitment from a bank or any place else. If your books are in order. Just my guess but if anyone calls the company ask how it's going let us all know. terms have to be better this time around to help the price of the stock"
"does anyone know when earnings are due? I tried calling company and they answered in the Caribbean and could not get transferred to the correct area. not a good sign anyway seller is alive and selling small lots 5up to 10,000 shares at a time when he can. will he let it close higher today? my guess is yes, not near 7 like we would all like."
IMO CNDT as of late has caught the attention and interest of the hedge/mutual funds. It wouldn't be a surprise to find CNDT stock rise to $22 by the end of the year. At the current stock price it is a real bargin.
Filing with the sec today about restructure Of debtGood newsNot done yet but filed it
Whatever happens tomorrow good luck to you all
IMO it appears that investors are worried about the resurgence of the virus(s) and the impact it may or may not have have on the economies. They seem to be selling off or staying on the sidelines for the time being.
CNDT stock could very well open at $5.00 or more tomorrow! CNDT management has done an excellent job increasing revenue by signing up new clients but reducing expenses as well.
Earnings announced nov 4 after the bell. Let’s go!
A large block of stock traded this morning you would think it would be a cleanup except there is still a lot of stock around 5000 share pieces hopefully they’ll buy all of that you would think the stock will close higher because if you can buy a block you should be able to keep the stock above water for the day. It would be nice if it goes higher today time will tell ￼￼￼
Great company Read the analyst reports
"SEEKING ALPHA wrote an excellent analysis regarding CNDT on January 19, 2021 Any investor consideringpurchasing CNDT should/must read the SEEKING ALPHA analysis!"
"Again Friday 1, million shares trades at the close, after close 600,000 additional traded where is all of this stuff coming from I thought we were cleaned up last week I hope I only missed by a week and we might be finished we will see this week with what happens￼￼￼"
Well I guess the selling is not over just decided not to hit the bids too low. With all the short stocks going up people are dumping their long positions we will just have to wait it out I keep thinking Carl Icahn He’s selling some of his position this is too much stock being sold to be anyone else just have to wait and see who won loaded their positions￼￼￼
"Who is loading up on CNDT now? I think they are on a solid track again and should look stronger in Q3, Q4. Could be back to the $7 - $9 range. Revenue has leveled off at $1.05 Billion per quarter / its no longer dropping. With several new major contracts signed this year the revenue could turn North. That, combined with cost cutting to return to profitability could be great news soon."
"19,000 shares for sale at 388 cleaned up in one trade stock going higher￼"
"Not really sure why the stock went up so quickly the news that was out is no big thing. To refinance their debt should have been done six months ago when rates were even lower still I really wonder if the seller really is cleaned up . He fooled me a couple of times￼￼￼ while I added and additional 5000 shares which worked out quite well. This morning there were 30,000 shares on the offering at $7.30 and in a blink of an eye was purchased we will see at the end of the day when buying comes in as usual and selling picks up. Fortunately the buyer had a little more fire power than the seller.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼"
"Am I missing something? A spinoff of Xerox that got rid of sleepy management and has revamped its salesforce - which proved to be a success according to last earnings report. Involved in a sector that's geared towards companies becoming more efficient - save money, time and effort. DE Shaw and Ichan just a few of the the buyers at years end. FYI: DE Shaw makes no mistakes, simply one of the brightest and best employees at this 'under the radar' firm. This could easily be a double this year. I'm in!"
"1% growth for past 3 month year over year is not much to hang your hat on, particularly when 6 month yoy is down and the difference is far less than changes in depreciation, litigation costs, restructuring, etc. Still a positive quarter. More sideways movement ahead. May drift up to 8 over the next quarter but don't expect too much more. Getting back to 19 is still a long way off."

"CNDT is a misunderstood story due to the stock underperformance over the last 2 plus years, New management has created a new culture, replaced key executives, and improved service levels. For example, after replacing the chief revenue officer in Oct 2019 and creating a new go to market, CNDT has signed new business in the first half of 2020 which equals all of 2019. Pretty incredible in such a short time. Overall, the stock trades for a multiple of 4.5x EBITDA vs competitors at 10-15x. Their leverage is 2.6x (low) and they'll create cash throughout the rest of 2020. Revenues should start to grow in the back half of 2021 as these new business signings come on and margins will grow due to increased revenue and the permanent cost cuts currently being implemented.Short-term catalyst would be a divestiture and stock repurchase plan which (depending on what they sell) could see the stock double in a day. This is a $15 stock."
What a Great country we live in specially when everything comes together for a stock hopefully this partnership with Mercedes was not included in the earnings call so we can have higher sales for this year￼￼

I feel bad for whoever got shook for their shares . I loaded up at $2.98-3.05. This is not a company to panic sell. I been here since 1.88 and I’ll keep telling you $13 coming in 2021. I say $9 in January
"From what I've seen with past earnings reports. Flat green performance after a huge drop (and not continuation of hard red after an earnings report) indicates an uptrend (institutions probably no longer desire to sell CNDT). I'm betting on a nicely green week, possibly even recovering last week's dip."
"Almost 1/3 of the volume traded in the last hour 262,000 shares deal with 10,000 share trades 5000 shares trades 18,000 share trades 38,000 share trade and we saw the bids get hit from $.21-$.18 cents very little volume traded today they were size for sale at $7.23 at the close there was a seven dollar bid for 60,000 shares they knew they weren’t going to buy it the pump and dump theory I can’t see that because nobody is holding 133 million shares or anything near that we have a lot of things working in our favor yes the seller is there but it looks like we are finished with the correction small caps hopefully lead us higher. If the buyer was not so aggressive the seller will come to him regardless it was a good week for CNDT it was a good week for everyone on this site and everyone have a good weekend and let’s look forward to next week.￼￼￼￼￼￼"

"Unfortunately stock is not trading 94,000 shares traded prior to the opening so it seems the seller is back instead of selling into the rally he will hit the bids as we see. I’ll repeat stock is not trading if volumn does not pick up stock will go south.￼￼￼ Just have to complete this seller"
CNDT could open ten (.10) cents higher! Investors appear to have a positive take on CNDT'S future earnings..
"no volume today and all the action comes after 3pm my guess it gets hit at the end of day. I would love to be wrong, but odds are with my guess. when seller is gone this stock wants to go higher."
"there is a buyer for 60,000 shares at $7.21 and thats why the stock moved back up, sorry to say he bought 31000shares left with 29,200 left. smart just sitting on the bid. oops seller filled him. time 12:33"
The ER was solid all around. Maybe a little anti climatic because CNDT already said they would beat on earnings and we had a pretty strong run for the last 30 days.All depends on the conference call now but I think CNDT is got no where to go but up. Steady or fast is my only question
Today they announced they formed another committee what does that mean to current stockholders absolutely nothing all he could do is increase payroll expenses there’s a lot of publicity released by this company making me suspicious sometimes too much smoke and mirrors I see nothing adding to the bottom line when will we see that I’m holding a large position i’ve been bullish just don’t want to see more nothing information being released about this company if I see more they might be going down the road of pump and dump can’t wait to see the new short figures for April￼￼￼
Why is it taking so long to refinance there debt? With these low interest rates it should’ve been a no-brainer unless some numbers don’t pass the bankers requirements only guessing but it is as good as any other reason why the short numbers are going higher and you can’t fight the shorts they win if the stock goes lower they sell more if the stock goes higher and this is a stock that is difficult to cover due to the lack of trading You just don’t short a stock that trades by appointment but this one is being shorted￼￼￼￼
So basically after 2 blow out qtrs we are flatWish I understood this oneBasically no move at allAny clue on why?
"Still stock for sale 35,000 at $6.81 big pieces are being cleaned up"
IMO CNDT investors/mutual funds are being too conservative regarding the Price Per Share in the foreseeable future. CNDT was trading at $23 about two and half year ago when it first was listed. CNDT will again become recognized as a worthwhile investment by individuals/mutual funds/stock advisors and so forth which will bring about a higher Price Per Share.bring about a higher stock market price.
Upside earning surprise(3Q's) and stock buyback on its way. About time!

"All: Very good call. Beat on all metrics and forward estimates should give good guidance from analysts. If these analysts know how to interrupt the numbers it's a no brainer to recommend buys. Unfortunately some have their own agendas and then there is always the MM's and short interest. Never a level playing field for us retail investors. I have traded for years and what amazes me is, that my pharmaceutical companies with no revenues trade at higher SP on speculation. Go figure. Stay long and don't sell your shares and make them pay the appropriate value. We have to do what we can as the retail investors to keep these thief's at bay. Thank you all for your positive input and intelligent thought process. GLTA."
How big of a beat are we thinking this quarter? Did Conduent guide for results this quarter? Excited to hear the CC.

"seller seems to be scaling up which can help as long as he is selling stock. We know what happens when it stops he hit the bid. He sold 5000 share at 6.80 also 6.82, 6.85 he has 7500 shares for sale6.85 we see the volume picking up and that is a good sign. one could only hope he is close to completing his order. round numbers are always hard to go thru (6.90)"
"Stock on able to hold five disappointing there is a large seller, probably a hedge fund Who else will have such a large position nice article today by Zack‘s stock is undervalue, stock as no sponsorship that’s the problem I have to wait till next time their earnings come out . Still buying stock on the five have a large position 12,000 shares taking a shot trying to make this is a wonderful year hope I’m right￼￼￼￼"
Carl Icahn owns 10% of the company maybe he’ll just take them private he did buy 1 million shares the last time the stock collapsed you have to hold here what could your downside be less than four points￼￼
How is everyone feeling about CNDT earnings coming up later today?
Clearly the shares want to run..the market keeps dragging ..hopefully it floored at 6.50
"Loaddeddddddd. $7 coming after earnings . It’s gonna be another blowout . Don’t forget about the 100mil of new business signed last year q1 or was it 300 mil? Over $20 in under 2 years time , mark this post"
Don’t you just hate it when good news comes out and the sellers come out where are the buyers? Stock went from 6.90 to 6.85 in a blink of an eye. 90% of the Russell 2000 stocks are in correction territory we are almost down 20 percent since hitting a high of 8.50 ￼￼￼￼ we need for this selling to stop before the selling does￼
400 k shares bought up ore market at 6.74Someone knows something
Nice combo of no volume and selling into earnings lol
@ the end of the day this company has now become an interesting buy out candidate. 2 Q's doesn't make a trend but a good start. Going much higher. Rates will remain low for the foreseeable future.
Volume dried up seller hit the stock. Hope the buyer understands and pulls back until he knows what he or she is looking at.
Great rally let’s close the market here and walk away with a plus day. Seller not through stock not trading very high volume that is troublesome and again good news with Chicago contract problem is what does it add to the bottom line?￼￼￼
It does without saying that there is much to digest regarding CNDT going forward. Just the other day Seeking Alpha wrote a very favorable analysis of CNDT Then SCHWAB downgrades CNDT just before earnings announcement. Today there was lots of downward pressure on CNDT. IMO CNDT management will bring about positive earnings and CNDT investors will be rewarded accordingly.
"This down turn gives everyone the chance to purchase more shares if you are bullish for the long term. I purchased 1000shares yesterday at $7.30 and another 1000shares at $6.95 today, just adding to my position. this stock wants to go higher but market conditions dictates when it will happen."
Great quarter. Looking for more contracts signed in Q4 for share holder boost. Thanks guys.
They had a good conference call company is in the beginning stages of growing and becoming a growth company CFO is leaving next month now I know where the selling came from they have a large contract they will be announcing 178 million in Europe The fact that he stated it on the conference call Must be knowledge a lot of people have this stock will work higher in the future￼￼￼￼￼. It’s not an easy start to accumulate and that could be a deterrent for many institutions but it seems like a good stock to buy and hold and a lot of volume cleaned up today can’t be much more left around if there is any. ￼
Activism if constructive for management can drive long term value. No reason why CNDT which has over $1 billion in revenue is priced so low. Icahn and others can clean house if necessary and light a fire to move things along. The trend looks positive now. God Bless and stay well all.
Any ideas on the market open? How we looking you think?I’m thinking short term may b tough but next few weeks we slowly climb back up
IMO Mutual/Hedge Fund companies are pushing back the CNDT short sellers! Indications are that CNDT stock will see a considerable rise in the next few weeks.
"Not a pretty day today for CNDT. The buyer is trying to keep it above seven with nice size orders between 10 and 20,000 shares to no avail he runs it up the seller kicks it back down if he was smart he would make a stand and not run it up it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see this seller will not run out anytime soon. The market usually tells you things at this point I don’t believe a good learning report is coming if so the conference call will not be too positive it probably means the second half will be better than the first. With this market and the seller being there holding seven could be the impossible dream hope I’m wrong what direction is down keep the faith everyone￼￼￼￼￼"
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now . I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line , that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said , the market is still all about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Steve program , an establishment that handles people who lack understanding on how maneuver the crypto space , to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns , with their program i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks.if you're interested in getting started just send Steve a message on whats<<<>>App + 1 ( 8 1 3 ) 6 8 3 ‑ 6 3 1 0 OR Te** le*gram @SteveFX01"
Any idea why a lot of analysts are saying this stock will continue to go down in the next 5years?? I am looking for a good long term investment and quite like this stock! Any ideas or recommendations??
"As everyone can see the seller is still around. We need to see higher volume in the stock to go up, other wise the seller will hit the bids to participate in the volume. the market maker when he gets the order has to make sure the seller gets his fair share of what has trader to keep the order. until the seller is complete no matter how long it takes. That is how it was when I was a trader and the way it has been trading seems like it is still that way. This is a tough stock to get in and out of since it just doesn't trade with volume. The best way to get out is to scale up when it trades, but near the end of the month and if the seller wants it off his books you just pound the stock until order is complete. There is a buyer and he wants it up for month end so it should be interesting tomorrow after 3 pm. keep you fingers crossed."
"One final note: one Hedge Fund in particular thought CNDT has been extremely undervalued as of late. With the solid earnings report and the recent signup of new business and the concerted effort to reduce expenses CNDT should be recognized as a solid investment for the future,"
"SCHWAB downgrading CNDT IMO is due to the awful weather back EAST. Addtionally, it gives institutional investors an opportunity to buy CNDT at a much low price IF SCHWAB downgrade impacts the stock price in the short run. Conversely , STOXLINE positive analysis gives CNDT a buy signal and sees a higher stock price in the near future. That stated CNDT will announce earnings this week on February 18th."
Be careful of that cat bounces as far as I can see the selling is not over and the short selling is not over until some kind of news comes out but that’s my opinion and I will cut my position on good days and hope I’m wrong because I built up a position that was just too risky fortunately I did cut it in half before I just don’t see A catalyst in the near future to go back to 7 1/2￼￼￼￼￼￼
CNDT stock up after hours trading. Mutual/Hedge funds starting to take interestregarding CNDT! !
JP Morgan upgraded stock this morning from 8 to 9$
"This is a tough prediction, not really enough volume today to make me feel the seller is finished, but there was a large print at 359:50 and it is the end of the month so my guess and that is all it is a guess the selling is over. We will know tomorrow. stock still in an uptrend long term. short term it could be choppy. good luck to all and it was interesting the last half hour. there were 15 trades of 10,000 shares or more. not bad for a low priced stock which trades almost by appointment."
should be a good day.. but no matter what this is a long term stock.. will double with in the year..
Does anybody know why the PPS is going down ? Bad news ?
"Monday, February 15 Charlie Schwab downgrades CNDT from a B to a C didn’t state why I am trying to find out what a C is Probably hold due to the price increase strange right before earnings but nobody is perfect time will tail stock still has a bright future￼"
I am not a chartist but I’m not bad at it and this is the perfect stock too short there is just no support underneath those with more knowledge than me please look at it and tell us where support may be I also tell you watch the size of the market the last half hour . The offering size keeps growing volume prints 20 times the offering size and the stock doesn’t move there’s just too much for sale at the moment tomorrow he probably will let it go up a little sort of by it doesn’t walk away which she should. The buyer if he moves it up a nickel or a dime should not go higher but try to hold that game for the day he uses his gun powder way to early just hold the gain any kind of gain. I hope some people lightened up a little I just don’t like seeing people losing money sometimes the market talks to you by the way it’s trading. It’s not a September issue Frank I brought up some good issues with the filing doesn’t mean the right but they just may not be wrong￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
Looks like refi going through..lets hope it moves up frm here
CNDT stock up again this morning! Climbing that wall of worry! Is it short covering or are investors finally taking note that CNDT is indeed going to have positive earnings this year?
Company is turning around it just doesn’t have any sponsorship will take a couple of quarters making money we haven’t seen that yet if it can hold here and trade we all should be happy it has no reason to be A double digits stock at the moment. There are lots of losses in the stock long term holders probably will be getting out by years end offsetting gains in other companies. Let’s hope a large salesman and a major broker Chaus decides to take a position everybody have a wonderful Christmas and New Year’s and above all stay safe￼￼￼
"I'm very positive on CNDT for a few reasons:1) The company has signed 3.1bn of new business within the last 18 months. This takes time to come on the P&L and initially starts to ramp at a lower margin, but gradually increases.2) The company has stated in the past that they're signing higher margin new business (again this will take time to show on the P&L)3) We are getting towards the end of attrition from legacy losses in 2019 and prior. The CFO states on last conf call ""And then secondly, there's the components of the legacy losses...we're really starting now to get into, what I call, the thin end of the wedge of those legacy losses. We haven't quantified them in terms of their overall number. But the number this year was more than twice as big last year, and the number next year is going to be half the size of this year. And the number in 2023 is going to be half the size of 2022.""As we burn through these legacy losses and new business starts to ramp, you will have revenue growth, margin expansion and increased free cash flow (FCF will also increase from less restructuring exp and more normalized capex). 4) The company has been investing in technology and training to improve service levels, which I believe you are seeing in the new business signings. For example, they signed $775mm in new business in 2Q:21 compared to all of 2019 when they signed just $996mm. 5) CNDT has long-term relationships, play in a large market with minimal share, has a very large opportunity to cross-sell their services and remove pain points for their clients. 6) Debt has been refinanced. 3Q is just another blip in the road (although I think it will be good simply because you had insiders buying stock in mid to late August) and I would concentrate on how they progress through 2022 (as stimulus comes off, but volumes come back due to diminishing COVID cases) and 2023."
CNDT stock may see a triple digit stock appreciation today after today's announcement!~
"1.5 million shares bought at the close @4.48, who sold today look in the mirror"
I bought CNDT today because alot of insiders including CEO are buying and Carl Icahn is also a big holder. Take a look: http://openinsider.com/search?q=cndt
"this stock cant catch a bid with great news in an up roaring market, sell the company book value almost 6, dead wood running it, should look for a buyer"
Hopefully next weeks earnings report will be positive and the PPS will increase and stay there .
What happened ? Why dumped ?
Don’t forget they signed $300 million of new business in the first quarter. Tomorrow’s earnings will be crucial. I think a huge surprise is coming and I’m not selling nothing
If you think the earnings Are going to miss￼ maybe you should sell some thing if you like the company long term. Buy it back cheaper somebody is selling a lot of stock they have this information the shorts will Cover lower because this is not a stock You want to be in￼￼￼￼ when they run through the door to sell you could sit tight hope for a good conference call but it looks like stock is going lower now And it is not trading￼￼
We now know some of this selling is because the short figures up 25% month over month but that’s only part of the selling
"I just bought in- heard and saw some unusual options activity- seems calls have spiked a bit. Small position, lets see whats what- earnings due on thursday"
"Not a lot of opportunities like this left out there. Share price under $5 bucks, moving $1Billion + in revenue during peak of Covid crisis while posting profit of $0.05/share. Next week could be very nice for this stock with big move to the upside!!"
"Alright just dipped in bought 2k shares today at 4.87- there isn’t 1 stock in the last year that I have at least doubled! Let’s goooo... love this business, I’m in the card processing business and these guys are only going up from here"
"It was 150,000 shares for sale at $4.10 cleaned up at close at $4.08. Stock going higher￼￼"
Did anybody hear anything about CNDT there’s a higher bid in the after hours￼￼￼
"I am looking at Consulting companies that have cloud exposure and that I think will grow. Trying to get a handle on how much of CNDT is based on Cloud. I took a look at Rackspace, but they are over 1.x in Sales with 4B in debt, which makes this look extremely cheap. I still think we can get to 1x Sales in 1 year which would put SP close to $21."
Continued ramp in new business signings and a divestiture and CNDT is at $5. Roughly a $1bn in equity and 1.2bn in net debt with 400mm + in EBITDA and growing. It'll still be inexpensive and well below comps.
"stock trading in the after hours much higher, top was 5.35 and it can't be because zacks upgraded from sell to hold either news coming or seller is complete. around 50,000 share buyer at 5:25pm and filled but not in one shot which is a good sign."
This is not good the seller is taking no prisoners he wants out and he doesn’t care at what price I thought 638 would have support chart shows no support. Maybe with a wipe out somebody will step up and buy the remainder but it’s hard to see good news coming out￼
CEO and Chairman bought some stock. Form 4s are out.
"I don’t believe anybody thought it was a real move yesterday the seller was there he let it rise he did sell stock in the last 10 minutes he sold his 19,000 share piece knocking it down from 708 to 706 quite a few 5 to 9000 share lots. That’s why I didn’t write anything about yesterday’s move￼￼"
"one has to wonder to understand that this stock has not made any progress since Aug, while the last quarter report was a blowout and they guided up while announcing numerous new contracts"
This filing asks a lot of questions 1. Why didn’t they check the box it’s an emerging growth company. ￼2. At least the possibility that they will not be successful in restructuring the debt. ￼3. How much debt are we talking about￼￼￼￼ and what interest-rate. ￼4. If city has a good write up on the company why don’t they use them to refinance? 5. Did they try to restructure four months ago and work unable to since that’s when the selling really started. There is a a lot of uncertainty and Wall Street does not like uncertainty. I believe all of this selling is two to the restructuring and what happens if they are not successful?￼ ￼ everything we read about this company is good I wish Zacks would stop writing about them and is somebody hiring a publicity company to help pump this company up? It’s been done before not saying that it’s happening now because I do have a large position and I am holding but the market is telling everyone the prudent thing would be do not carry a large position and don’t be afraid of taking a small loss￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
Dont you just love owning a stock making a new low everyday ?
"We will all have to wait for the conference call if it’s not positive and if the earnings do not meet projections then everyone should try to participate and ask the question why did not the company give an update of the quarter like a lot of companies do? There has been a lot of pressure on the stock and evidently somebody knew something this company could lose their credibility on the street and with the stockholders. They did not refinance there debt, did not state why to the public but information had to get out. I am hoping it does not get to this point but the stockholders have got to participate in the call.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼"
Do you think the dems getting control of the senate effect us short or long term here in cndt?
"I figured the seller has been cleaned up there was some large prints which indicates the cleanup. I did add to my position figuring end of month sellers been around couple of weeks due to the fact that doesn’t trade in size and the seller has it off of his position stock ended the month where it started. Now we can move in the right direction up. I’ve been right on a large seller and it wasn’t a short seller, and I will be right on the cleanup. Let’s hope this market does not go the way January went. As they say the way January goes The market goes but that was in the old world this is a new world we live in.￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼"
I hope the article by Zacks yesterday doesn’t stop all buying in the stock until after earnings if that’s the case the stock will go lower amazing how some people have information and others don’t not even the company Companies do pronounce￼￼￼ at times￼
You read nothing but good news on this company but the stock continues to slide only nine days to Earnings￼
I am fraily surprised that short covering has not picked up since earnings are Thursday and last ER burnt shorts really really hard. Remember a few weeks ago the CEO said CNDT will meet or exceed earnings. A pop above 4 seems inevitable this week.
"Investment counselors of Maryland I added 600,000 shares to the holdings still waiting to see who the seller is. Let’s hope for another good day should’ve been better yesterday but green is green.￼￼"
Stock showing good Volume so far this morning seems to be plenty of selling also but the good long term effect. The stock is going into new investors probably with a long term objective which should bode well for a future increases in the stock. Insider purchasing￼￼￼￼￼￼ usually is an indication of good things to come this stock after the last earnings report should not sell below seven let’s all have a good day and it’s good to know Frank will be keeping his stock￼￼￼
CNDT new customers coming onboard will push the price of the stock higher in the short run! Don't miss the run up very shortly as the result of accumulation by hedge funds.
"Good morning I haven’t posted only because the seller is alive and well he will be around only because the stock is not trading , we would average over 1 million shares this week it’s like the buyer is taking a sabbatical The stock usually trades up on a Friday and it usually closes a couple of cents higher than the week before but with this Volume all bets are off￼￼￼￼ I guess we just have to sit it out I will eventually add to my position but I would like to see a close over eight dollars have a good weekend all and stay strong￼￼"
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Thetraderguide.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."
"The seller is still around there were 15,000 20,000 25,000 share Prints and immediately after there were 100 share printsTo hide the larger ones if you watch the stock the volume jumps The size does not change and the stock does not move the seller knows you just don’t hit the bids because you do not get off quantity by letting this stock rise you could make your prints this stock does not trade so you have to get it to a point where it will which was exactly what happened Friday on the opening at the close there was stock for sale. There is a smart buyer Who is cleaning up a lot of stock cheaply as possible on the chart the stock is still in an up trend and with a decent market we will do very well. But remember this stock went down a point on very little volume last week before recovering I missed the bottom frank was smart enough to pull the trigger I did the same a little early after the seven dollar close. I am sitting with a wonderful profit this year but I’m looking long-term as long as Carl Icahn has his stock I will have mine. I consider him smart money￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼ and if you follow smart money you will win more often then lose. Let’s have a good week ahead but either way hold long term.￼￼"

"I am surprised the shares did so poorly this earnings Q. Earnings keep improving, and the stock kept popping up, except the Quarter. This company is doing very, very well. The shares do not reflect this."
Massive moves in the market all weekAnd we are up pennies with no volumeI think it’s a sign to move on
"The last hour we saw 533,000 shares trade. up til then only 645,000 traded all day. What does that tell us? it tells me the seller still has stock. from $6.95 to 7.03 it took trades of 10 to 25000 shares to move the stock 1cent at a time. The good thing is the seller is not hitting the bid, which he did at 7.03,7.02 and 7.01. seems stock is for sale at a price around here. soon we will be able to see whose position has decreased. stock still looks good."
"I think someone is pulling the wool over everyones eyes, i have read at least four good articles about how everyone just loves the future of CNDT, and everyone is left holding the bag as the smart money gets out, Does anyone else feel this way ?"
"Most undervalued stock in the market. It surely will go cross 20, 30 INSHA ALLAHHolding strongly"

"Interesting day today it looked like the seller was cleaned up stock went up like a rocket stalled at $5.24 the seller had 30,000 for sale there it was around 20,000 at 5:25 another 30,000 at 5:26 can’t tell you after that stock jump to 529 that was around 230 pm seller is still alive and a stock was pounded And the market was up so we can’t say the market fell and the stock went with it there was a lot of stock trading five thousand 10000 thousand shares and the bid size and offer a ring size did not change which meant stock was crossed with the seller. I have to admit I was licking my chops as the stock was flying up only to be disappointed but the good thing stock did move up and a lot of stock had to be cleaned up. Sure hope the market stays good so the buyer doesn’t pull away i’m Bullish And in it for the long run but it’s so much nicer when it goes higher good luck everyone￼￼￼￼"
Largest shareholder just sold 600MM of HLF and floated another 750MM of debt. Stay strong!
Today should be a good day looking at level 2No large sells No low ball salesShould have room to finally run a little
"Conduent Incorporated (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company”) announced that it has decided not to proceed at this time with its previously announced intention to replace its Credit Agreement Term Loan due 2022, Credit Agreement Term Loan due 2023, and Senior Revolving Credit Facility. The Company has determined, based on the combination of deal structure and market conditions, to postpone refinancing efforts in order to pursue a more optimal outcome at a later point in time. (SEC FİLİNG) 27.05.2021"
"All fundamentals: good news, solid volume, insider transactions, and future opportunities in a COVID environment lead me to believe CNDT is about to surge higher. I’m feeling good about this small cap company right now. It could double very soon...."
I’m thinking the selling is over the volume has picked up and the stock is holding .Now all we have to do is wait for either good news or bad news but the buyer will be buying and moving the stock back up let’s hope I’m right but the market seems to be indicating the way it’s trading now￼
Good quarter regardless if the seller it’s still selling stock is a hold for a long term. Refinancing they feel will happen in a couple of months and everybody is relieved thinking the worst because of the seller if the stock drops I’ll pick up more shares Have a good weekend everyone￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
"someone was trying to hold the price down to accumulate shares under 4 for weeks, no more next stop 7 before Xmas"
If you watch level 2You can see Goldman sell 2700 at 7.15 and have a buy order in for 2700 shares at 7Over snd over Like I said it’s price manipulation They are keeping it down for a reasonWhen they are done this will compose to the upside
"Me 2 days ago:""Decent action today. We have a reasonable chance to hit the upper 3.90s before the ER. Shorts are being very brave so far.""I really was not expecting to break 4 before earnings so this is great.Still not seeing a lot of short covering.Tonight will all come down to forward guidance.This is set pop hard if we get good guidance.I am guessing decent guidance is worth $5.25+"
"Similar competitors like Accenture and Cognizant, CNDT reset / withdrew their 2020 revenue guidance when COVID-19 hit. However, the analysis of Conduent’s book of government and commercial business is on solid footing therefore, when earnings are announced they are most likely going to be better than expected."
Nice to be back over 7.
CNDT is significantly undervalued. Under accumulation by savvy investors for the rest of the year! ! !
Hopefully this wipes the seller out. Crazy to dump 220k shares at 6.8 when opened at 6.95
"with over 4 $ Billion in revenues, this company should be in the green for a long time, they need to align their expenses and devote all of their efforts to deliver profits on a bottom line, the board must demand some action fast"
CNDT is a stable Information Technology company with a annual revenue of over $4 Billion and growing.As the economy continues to recover CNDT revenue will increase as well as earnings. CNDT is IMOa solid long term conservative investment along with the possibility of paying dividends in the future.
when is this Dog going to hunt?
"I guess everybody saw 1 million she’ll print at the close. You would think that would be cleaning up the seller I fell for the trick a couple of times already with the stock so I will not participate on the upside I will just stay with my position and if it goes higher like it should I’m comfortable with my 10,000 shares good luck everyone enjoy the weekend ￼￼"
"Conduent Inc. (CNDT) has been upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reflecting growing optimism about the company's earnings prospects. This might drive the stock higher in the near term."
"More than the excellent results, it seems that conduent has the right team now in place which is clearly evident in the turn arround this quarter. Right team is the most important factor for investors for long terms wealth generation. This is exactly what hapenned with AMD as well. After more than 50 years wealth destruction in AMD history with so many executives came and gone, then came Dr. Lisa Su and then rest is history.Hold on to Cliff !"
Insiders buying shares!!! Good sign!!!!
when you see a 6 1/2 million share print you usually have it on a cleanup of the seller. when he comes back the next day like this one probably did the buyer will step away and let it go down just like it is doing and reach a level where other buyers and retail step up and chip away until the seller is finished. I believe this is what is happening right now. I am speaking with knowledge of the market.
Confirmed News coming regarding a successful upgrade and multiple more contracts. Load up guys before you are too late !!!
"Key HighlightsRevenue above Company expectations despite COVID-19 impactBusiness continuity planning successful with approximately 75% of associates working-from-homeContinuing to serve as trusted partner and meet client expectations throughout the crisisIncreased health and safety measures for associatesAdapting transformation plan beginning with immediate focus on post-COVID-19 cost savings initiativesIncreased new business signings by 44% vs Q1 2019FLORHAM PARK, NJ, May 7, 2020 - Conduent (NASDAQ: CNDT), a business process services and solutions company, today announced its first quarter 2020 financial results.Cliff Skelton, Conduent CEO, stated “Throughout this global crisis, we have continued to provide critical services to our clients, while ensuring the health and safety of our associates and keeping our company strong. We have been able to move approximately 75% of our associates to a remote work environment amidst the COVID-19 crisis while meeting very important commitments to our clients and their millions of end-users. In addition, while we are operating in this new hybrid environment, we have been able to implement measures recommended by the CDC and the WHO for those performing essential work in our facilities, while at the same time continuing to deliver at service levels expected by our clients, evidenced by client feedback and our operating performance.” Skelton continued, “Meanwhile, we understand that these are very trying times for many, including our associates who have been exemplary throughout this crisis. We want to extend our best wishes and concerns to our many stakeholders and partners who may have been adversely affected. We remain confident that while likely different, a new and even better horizon is around the corner.”Q1 2020 Performance CommentaryThe Company’s business continuity program enabled teams to respond quickly to COVID-19 impacts and ensure sustained client delivery. However Q1 2020 performance was impacted by COVID-19 with volume reductions in our Transportation, Transaction Processing, and Customer Experience solutions resulting in an approximately $14 million revenue impact. Conduent expects this volume pressure and associated profit impacts to continue in Q2 2020. The Q1 2020 COVID-19 impacts were partially offset by volume increases in the Government Healthcare and Payments businesses and the Company expects these volume tailwinds to continue in Q2 2020 given the scope of the government programs that it supports.The Company continued to show operational improvement with sustained, meaningful improvement in technology incidents and time to resolution. Conduent is now in the planning stage for migration to the ‘new normal’ operating model, which will allow for maximum workplace flexibility and Real Estate optimization.Additional highlights from Q1 include strong sales performance with $324 million in new business signings, a 44% increase over Q1 2019, primarily driven by sales to new clients or new capabilities to existing clients.From a client and partnership point of view, Conduent launched a new COVID-19 version of its Maven disease surveillance and outbreak management platform. Along with hosting partnerships with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, the platform is being used by public health agencies and could potentially be used by commercial organizations to manage and report on cases and potential exposures of COVID-19. It is also helping these agency professionals save time and resources by streamlining the contact tracing requirements associated with COVID-19.Conduent is well positioned for improvements in growth, efficiency and quality as the ramp back to normal from the COVID-19 crisis takes place.Key Financial First Quarter 2020 ResultsRevenue of $1,051 million, down (9.2)% year-over-year.Adjusted Revenue, excluding divestitures in Q1 2019, was down (6.3)% year-over-year, or (6.0)%in constant currency.Q1 2020 GAAP net loss of $(49) million compared to $(308) million in Q1 2019.Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes the impact of divestitures, was $96 million, down year-over-year primarily driven by the decline in revenue, impact of COVID-19 and non-recurring cost items. Adjusted EBITDA margin also excluding divestitures, was 9.1%, down (180) bps year-over-year.Pre-tax income was ($51) million compared to ($338) million in Q1 2019.Diluted EPS from continuing operations was ($0.24) versus ($1.49) in the same period last year.Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations was $0.05 compared to $0.14 in Q1 2019.Cash outflow from operations was $(192) million during Q1 2020 compared to cash outflows of$(49) million in Q1 2019. Adjusted Free Cash Flow, which excludes the impact of Texas Litigation payment and other adjustments, was an outflow of $(97) million during Q1 2020.As a precautionary measure, the Company borrowed $150 million from its revolving credit line in March 2020."
Guess they don’t like the refi
"CNDT is a buyout target - this is Icahn's specialty when he takes an activist interest (or takes major ownership)It's a fairly stable and boring stock but for those who plan to hold this for the next 6 months, it'll see the $5-$6's on a buyout (maybe even higher)."
I wonder has Trilliums open letter started to gain traction on the board now?
