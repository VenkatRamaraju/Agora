everybody knows that's this stock Will eventually become a 500 dollar stock next year right?
everyone talks about Italia airforce flightis it bigger catalyst than FAA and Branson flight? I don't think so I believe the only way for this to go higher is high demands and unfortunately they won't give us ticket info until the earning
"I bet if the space ship blew up this stock would be higher , the guy went to space on Sunday we thinking we going to moon on Monday and he decided to sell shares and tank it I’m a bad holder at $52 should have sold at $60 but he went to space and I was to go to the moon next day"
bought an equivalent amount of money I have in VG into Virgin Orbit. They all help each other
"no cash equitry selling from big instiutions, i only think this is derivative instruments positioning"
I guess we will just have to see where this is going huh 
It goes to $27 tomorrow
Bought 3k shares @$44.00 … Not selling until $144.00
We need a assist Elon! We need a quick tweet!
Sept flight is on track despite all
Hoping this stock reaches its potential soon. Whether it is in the 40s or 50s. Let’s run up the numbers bulls!
"Things are getting clear. Virgin galactic will start with 1 mother ship and 4 delta class spaceships making 400 flights which will help them make $1B revenue per spaceport. This doesn't mean they can't generate more revenue per spaceport or add more spaceport. By 2023 they can meet 2400 passengers per year demand and as the demand goes up, they keep adding more motherships and spaceships. How fast they can build motherships with the help of Boeing and how fast they can build spaceships inhouse is a mystery we don't know. How fast they TAM grows is another variable we will only know in future."
Any reason why it's going down today?
"The Italian Air Force investigators and the Virgin Galactic crew are ready. They have worked with the Italian National Research Center (CNR), for the design of the experimental loads.Medical instruments will measure the biological effects of the transition phase from gravity to microgravity in the human body.The Unity 23 ... is in the preparation phase, before starting the flight and bringing new revenue for Virgin. It was another quarter with revenues, which multiplied the 570,000 dollars of the previous quarter"
"Why did VG increased the price from $250,000 to $450,000 per ticket? Too many people trying to buy a ticket? or does it cost more?"
"As I see it, the company follows their plan (yes, it’s not easy to put a metal thing in the space safely), they did well their tests and put his founder in the space proving that it really works. Insider selling: Branson sells because his group is suffering right now, covid still affecting in case you didn’t notice; Chamath Palihapitiya took his profit as everyone here would do to continue his spac journey. In terms of quality: Virgin’s product is good, they haven’t experienced fatal issues as for instance ASTR experienced recently, they preferred to delay their flights (wise move). Even in terms of dilution they did the right for the company at this stage you aren’t sure about financials, and money it’s very important in space industry, just remember there was no non governmental company doing something like this (maybe SpaceX but they were backed by NASA which saved them from the bankruptcy). And finally, yes the price is very high for the most of us, but vehicles like bugatti or ferrari or cloths like moncler or LV are expensive as well, and they still existing."
"I still consider myself a novice in trading and have been long in space since it was originally under $15 and since I've seen run up to max highs to fall completely back down to the bottom multiple times.... now to the present, This company has NEVER been in better position :) yea shares were diluted.. so what?! we now have over 1 billion in cash to support testing till we're ready for paid customers, add Sir' Richards trip to space and upgrades to our space fleet which will allow them to have more trips between maintenance periods. Add all the future utilities this technology will have moving forward.. what else I'm I missing? point is we are better today than ever before AND shares under 30? I'll take it "
"Good buy below $23.50. If you wait till early 2022, you will take it around $43"
This is a 1 trillion dollars per share stock. The poor are lining up to buy their 450k per 11 minute ride 
Is there any publicly traded company that is a better short than SPCE?
