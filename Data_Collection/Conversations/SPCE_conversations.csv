oversold.... market analysis expecting a better earnings...???? huh better earnings??? from where? another offering. company is painting the desert red with the cash burning.
"SPCE will look to show strength as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be November 8, 2021. On that day, SPCE is projected to report earnings of - $ 0.25 per share, representing year-over-year growth. after year. of 26.47%."
"SPCE’s RSI just dropped below 30, clearly oversold. Zacks is predicting an upward move, buying more"
It's being controlled by hedge funds to drive down to 15 before running back up is my bet.
any idea why the fall?
"Remember, in today's world. Stock exchanges, Hedgies etc employ Sophisticated Algorithm, Bots and programs to trade.Just do your DD and shut out the noise. Spce will be over $50 in several months time!Huge potential!"
Please bring this back to $25 
Any price below 20 is great to accumulate more shares and hold for at least a few years. Especially when everyone is negative you know it’s time to buy.
bought for $ 55
For the first time since all time high I’m genuinely feeling positive again. I believe a positive financial report on the 8th will include strong sales at the 450$ point which would hopefully lead to a much healthier share price. Thoughts welcome.
"SPCE's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates call for earnings of - $ 1.46 per share and revenue of $ 2.19 million. These results would represent interannual variations of -16.8% and + 820.17%, respectively."
Literally dodged a bullet selling a while back . Please do the same guys you can make that money back

This will go BIG soon !
"Bought at 25 , feels like no hope at the moment"
And we begin the climb back to $30.
I like SPCE and I am watching but not buying yet.
"I’ve made 100% twice on SPCE so far and looking forward to a third time. Hopefully gets down to $14-15 and then rockets with hype of launch announcement… in the meantime, sit in the Q’s and wait…"
"Time to dance for shorts who will burn this time... they miss calculated the amount it will drop and now they either buy back, which will drive the price up! Or they take a bet to wait and buy back later with a higher probability of the price to be higher, and also drive the price up. Either or, is good for people who actually own the stock and are patient with it!"
"I keep seeing more and more negative comments about SPCE here. Those of you who bought at $ 35-45-55, and now say this business is a scam, should learn the difference between investing and betting at the casino. If the company looked interesting at $ 35, how should it be now? It was known from the last earnings call that SPCE will enter a maintenance program of about 8 months. Nothing has changed."
