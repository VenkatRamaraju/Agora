"SPACE has had a very solid growth trend in recent days. It seems that at this rate, if we do not receive bad news, it will not fall below 20 for a long time. Now the BO flight is gone, we want news from SPACE."
"The communication department is planning the new news, which it can communicate to the market. The forecasts anticipate strong increases, for the next trading sessions."
And there it is! The delay we were waiting on hearing! I’m not short and once was long but this is not good for the short term share price!
Took a huge Loss ALMOST 200K ! I am OUT AND GOOD LUCK TO ALL.
time will pass and it will be like mrna $ 300
This is possibly better news than an Italian flight! The improved space planes will have no competition! Huge step upwards in customer experience 
Let's Go! 
I’m buying tomorrow
"Michael Colglazier, is the CEO of Virgin Galactic. He was president and CEO of Disney Parks International, where he was responsible for the operations, strategy, and commercial and experimental development of Disney's international parks and resorts. Logically his knowledge at Disney, he is transferring it to Virgin Galactic. Your strategy will be to wait for the Blue Origin flight to happen and then announce ours. Your business experience will be of great use to us in increasing sales of the new $ 450,000 banknotes. Sooner rather than later, they will have to provide that number to the market. Let's not forget that sales started on August 6, 2021. 2 months have passed and it would be interesting to know how those sales are going ... Let's not forget that sales also occur in subsequent months and in subsequent years ... It is similar to Netflix users ... New registrations are made every quarter ... Virgin Galactic, I think it will do something similar ... Those new users, willing to pay $ 450,000, will be a great catalyst, where to look to find out where the company is heading."
"If the news comes and with it a rush followed by a downturn, let's not be discouraged. I still think that a piece of news that we all expect and know in advance must be half discounted and should not imply a too large variation in the price, something else will be a successful second flight, that we all hope but no one can be 100% sure If it goes well and, above all, the announcement of how many reserves they have, this should be a good catalyst if they reach 4 figures. spce cheer, go go go."

Under 20 tomorrow?
Check the charts. No support below this level until it hits 15.50 which it most assuredly will based on all the bad news. Absolutely no reason to reverse the downward trend from here.
Buying under $20 tomorrow. I can wait !!!!
Your complaining that this is down today by 15%! It jumped 50% a few months ago.This is not a company yet $571000 in revenue for a 6 billion mrkt cap.You bought expecting this wouldnt fluctuate.Youre choked because you bought on a whim.who buys this at an ath?
"Here's the fact:1) Flight was to be started Q3 2022 delayed to Q4 2022Not a big deal2) Upgrade etc.. 3) No safety problems found4) No Cut in tickets purchase.In fact, there are evidence that tickets are being reserve for $450,000So, not much reason for this sell-off except it was options expiration, look at the puts and callsAnother fact is despite this news, the bears was not able to keep this lower then pre-market trading.I would expect Spce will at least gain $2 back next weektrading all."

"The headline reads, ""Branson trailing Bezos in space tourism,"" duh you think so!"
"From a new comment in FB spce group… sounds legit to me.“They, however, did not say an estimate about Italian flight.Just the new date of when commercial flight will commence(q4 of 2022).So, upgrade of the ship, more Test flights, Italian & possibly “others” if there are, flights.It is not too bad, if another news comes out outlining this.”"
i jumped out with 2k loss
"Michael Colglazier, is the CEO of Virgin Galactic. He uses a pseudo name to reveal company plans on a Yahoo message board. Look for the name Yancarlo and know that it is really the ceo of VG. How else could Yancarlo know there will be two space flights yet this year when the official company released info declares only one space flight before the long maintenance shutdown.Of course I am joking."
We don't hear of issues with new shepard rocket (blue origin) and it performs flawlessly. VG has a badly designed system that seem to have endless issues. Every time its something different and they have to delay. Stock is not worth investing in
Investors are getting tired
"@Ray, since you're such a believer in BO, assume you have no issues with employees saying they wouldn't feel safe going up in it."
Great buying opportunity for those with patience.
All u have to do is buy more and average down .
"I’m at 49.5, when this stock will go up?"
News after hrs?
"Oh, this is just TOO funny. You guys really thought it was back to business as normal???Next, they will issue more stock, just to keep operating because Branson is too cheap to use his own money.And BTW - Branson bribed a lot of inspectors to get his ride to fly. Just so you know."
So if the Red light will turn on Q4 2022 they will delay it again to Q4 2023?

"WoW...you want to get in on the future of Space, then here is a great opportunity to buy a company that is there and is going to be around for a long long time with all kinds of potential. Virgin Galactic is not just about Space Tourism but also doing business with other corporations that will need the manufacturing technology and the developments that come from space. This is a great buy"
"Just a little delay, what's the big deal. Have to give them credit to do it right."
"at $17 to close the gap, at $15 is main support, if need to add more , those are the entry point. but don't expect a big bounce, take profit if you have it, bc it will come back down , then buy it again"
This is why patiencePays offWhy pay $40 . Lol.
"Didn't Bronson sell multi-million dollars worth of SPCE just a few weeks ago? And, we should buy why?"
I had been waiting for a pull back on SPCE. I am very excited! Huge over reaction:)
"Liquidated my entire position before the market closed. Feel lucky, but also sad for the company. Not sure I believe in it anymore. Maybe will buy back at $15 ish range."
"Just look at the chart and ask yourself, Has it done this before? Perfect buying opportunity coming."
"11th September news:The earliest the company expects to open its flight window for Unity 23 is mid-October, Virgin said. Updates and a specific flight window will come once the inspection is complete, the company said.“We have a robust pre-flight readiness approach that is rooted in our thorough, proactive and safety-first culture,” Chief Executive Michael Colglazier said in a statement. “Our test flight processes and procedures are rigorous and structured to identify and resolve these types of issues. We look forward to taking to the skies again soon.”Definitely should fly tomorrow or next week… we will see"

Is $30 this week a wild dream?
"It doesn't matter who's the 1st to tour ""Space""!!!It only matters who can sustain...and make profits for the investors.In this upcoming higher borrowing cost environment, companies like these with the ""advertisement of future profits"" will be sold by investors in favor of companies already making huge profits and low debt.Do your homework!!!"
"The impatience on this board is confounding. VG is starting a completely new industry called “Space Tourism” and everyone expects the stock to be like an established 50 year company. You know this is a speculative stock and it will ebb and flow until they mature. And one day it will mature the revenues will flow like water so buy the dips if you can, stay off margin, and realize you need to sit on this for 5 to 10 years. Enjoy the ‘ride’ and enjoy the stories you’ll tell your grandchildren especially the part about how stock savvy you were too find VG when it was only a double digit stock price with a market cap around $6 billion."
"If you believe in the company, buy down. I will do it!!$100 Stock!!"
I will buy some at $20 tomorrow to average down and hold. The news totally crushed my portfolio….
every time I look at this stock it's either soaring or crashing.. not much in between ..

"Delay a month for better safety and people are panic to sell. If people are not mindless sheep they should applaud the delay and thank the management and buy. But again, mindless sheep don't think so and the big manipulators know it. So why now use this to scare the shht out of the sheep."
made 30k shorting
"To be honest, all I see is a decent rebound. It's only going to go up at the start of the week, right?"
come on $30.
Bought 324 shares at $19.99 just before close! I’m a happy man for the weekend :)
"I bought this around 19 and got out at 55 and change. So glad that I did. I have no further interest in this stock, but watch it with a certain degree of curiosity."

Bit of a over reaction no? 
People panicking and selling for a loss. Then they will buy back when it bounces up and pay more than what they sold for 1
"Would'nt this be funny if SPCE opens up on Friday instead of down like after hrs trading.Just a thought-Happy trading all.I have no position on SPCE but I do think Blue Orgin, Spce and Space X has tremendous potential going forward."
buy by dip
The previous time was worse I remember Branson stock sale + FAA investigation + flight postponement + downgrading. To date we have a flight delay ...
I hope big investors did not know the news yet!!
It's my best friends son's bar mitzvah this weekend.Beings that me and his pops go way back I figured I'd buy the kid 5 shares of SPCE for his special day.I'm hoping that buy time he turns 21 it might be worth $1000Any thought?Or should I just buy him some Golden Corral gift certificates?
Up 7% already after buying low during pre-market  too easy
"$RDW is trading today @ 50% discount... major contracts with NASA, NSA, $SPCE, $BORGN, revenues of $163M+ 2021 growing to $1.4B 2025. Stock trades at less than 2x 2022 revenues and is already cash flow positive with EBITDA of $20M+!!!!"
will go below $20 today.
Lol omg. I sold literally 2 days ago as I was fed up with this bs company. Thank god
Guess I'm a shareholder now. Way oversold.
They were always going to delay for 9 months after the Italian test so really this is no big deal. They don’t really lose much time
So surprise there are still people actually believe and invist in this company and the management after what they did RIGHT after the 2nd successful flight they did.. it was CLEARLY and without a doubt saying (investors?? go to HILL).. I sold instantly.. its 50% down now since then.
"The assumption is that VG is going to report good reservations numbers in nov 8, but that's not a sure thing. They were grounded from flying for weeks, can't be good for customer confidence. Also blue origin shown to be consistently safer with no technical issues and they clear the Karman line so they should take majority of the business. So expectations on nov 8 could be inflated and stock could loss 20% easy"
"Controlled action. 10 minutes before closing, they have brought it to 23.80. At that moment the big purchases begin. 30,000 or 50,000 shares. We can only wait. Big rises are coming. I do not move from this company until I see historical highs."
"The announcement of the flight with the Italians will arrive shortly ... if we all know, the news should not lead to big increases. If the flight is going well, nobody knows it anymore, if it should entail a significant climb, according to previous experience. For me the bomb news that should give the true indicator of the future potential of this company is the announcement of the number of flights already booked, hoping that this bomb will take it above 60/100 dollars."
Dollar store is hiringIn case you sold.
"6,710,050 shares traded today during the regular session. 4,613,176 traded after hours so far. This move is serious."
20% off? Buy more!! NOT....
All the bad news is out buy all you can now this is the lowest it's going Monday SPCE will close over 23! By the end of 2022 shares will be over 60!
"Over 50 million shares were sold today, and over 50 million shares were also bought. I honestly don't know which direction this will go next week, but I sure like to buy at a greater than 15% discount, so I opened a position at a little above $20. If it goes up, good, and if it falls more, I'll buy more. I'm not in a hurry and am comfortable waiting until Q4 of next year. Good luck to all, especially those who got hit today."
"Tempting to add here if your thinking 2 to 5 years away, maybe. However I'm going to wait. Imagine it might go lower the next time the markets drop and I'm thinking we may get a correction before Christmas. We really haven't had one yet, not when it bounces right back the next day after a drop."
next offload new shares for 1.5bln to keep operations
When is their next flight?
Wouldn't this be a good time to buy as much as you can buy?
"See you next year. I’ll put this one in the back draw, I can’t see it doing much in the next 6 months. Im still holding as I do see a future for it but my worry is cash burn. Are SPCE going to have to ask for more cash?"
"The company is always trying to stay transparent. If there’s a delay one year from now, they tell you before now. My opinion is telling you a delay is a good news that shows it’s democratizing transparency, reflecting its caution and integrity, and you don’t want a company hides you bad news about the space flight."
"Thank you for everyone that reply to me, bought at 49.5 and probably will hold."
This was a really nice gift
We will buy at $10
I JUST WOKE UP.
bought my grandson 5 shares. haha yeah 8 know its only 5 shares. will get more when it goes lower. long term for him 50+ years
"I rather wait for the Space X to invest when I simply compare the travel times between two companies. I could be wrong, but just my opinion"
Where are the shorts?
time to buy more
Let's take this  to .
Excellent opportunity to accumulate…
Is 20.80 a good entry point?
Rug pulled again. Ouch
"If SPCE isn't a falling knife, then why am i missing 2 fingers and a thumb?"
Back to $24 folks. Buy the dip!
Jeez. Glad I stayed patient and didn’t buy back in.. See you all in 2022!!!
Why panic? Just improve for a better spaceship. That why many people keep losing money. This is A easy 100 dollar shares. I aim for long term.
"SPCE was $10 in 2018 and shot up to $55 in few months at that time there was not much development or flight approvals. I think this is an over reaction the schedule is only delayed for 1 quarter. By the time commercial space flight starts, this stock will gain value"
"dead money for a very long time gl holding this, it will be for less than $10 by the end of the year"
"A month ago when I said I will wait for the price to dip below $20/share to buy, I was laughed at and ridiculed I guess I had the last laugh…"
According to Simply Wall Street… Fair value for SPCE is $7.25
"As David Clayton Thomas said: What goes up, must come down."
"SPCE. Of course we weren’t expecting this news. In fact yesterday I believe we closed AH up about +0.40 perhaps because of some rumors that the Hotel Encanto was booked for the 13-14 and that’s usually the hotel that the SPCE crew stays at or the team and whatnot. Anyways… I have a question for everyone as I am looking to establish a position in SPCE again. Last time shareholders got diluted was on a $500M offering. However there was in fact a filing of $1 Billion dollars of which they used up $500m to do the last equity raise. Leaving on the table another $500M. So it begs the question, now that they have their hands tied for the next couple of months and they aren’t making any money, all that cash is going to get dried up. Could they raise capital again to keep the lights on? They already filed for it so if they need it I guess they will. Second. Does anyone think that Social Capital (Chamath) will sell some shares? He’s done it before, when the test flight failed that first time Chamath sold on a dropping SP. so he could do it again and maybe buy back cheaper. Any other insider could also be in line to sell, SPCE merged with IPOA on October 28, 2019 which is coming up soon as it makes 2 years. Colglazier said that no insider was going to sell until October. He said this when the took RB up. Could the lockup expire 2 years after the merger hence October 28? Technicals. There’s a small GAP at the $17.27-$18.70 and there’s another one at 21.75-23.72 which I guess got filled today AH. Subsequently there’s also a GAP upwards in the $29 range but given the direction I think it’ll move lower rather than upwards. The 200-D is at $31.33 and we are substantially lower from it. If we slap on the FIBONACCI sequence we end up at a price of $14.82 which would fill the gaps. Other than this it would be macro market conditions, if the market contracts or corrects in the upcoming weeks or months it could be another gravity pull lower. Not sure, what do you guys think. This Ofcourse is not financial advice and it’s all my opinion. I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts and insights."
"some of you shorters are wishful thinking this will drop to 14 and 15. its not gonna drop 40 percent . 20 percent is a huge slap in the face if it does even hit 20 percent,which most likely it won't."
Brand damaging
So no revenue until fourth quarter of 2022.Who's gonna pay the bills until then?Can we expect some dilution on the road?
People saying yesterday:It can’t get any worse!!! Let’s buy.SPCE management team: Hold my beer! 
the financial report may drop this below $22.. will buy back in after the report
Let's all Hope that this flight will go as Planned w/ no delays.
in reality it is not more than $7 stock
It will recover just like that.
"I’ll double around 15.00, I can wait. There will be noBig news until next year so in the mean time they may even dilute again.I think 12-15.00 is a price target to buy more. Long termHowever this is a 500.00 -1,000.00 stock.BUT 7-10 years after 2022"
"Hope u guys got out after hours, cause if u didn’t you will wish u had!"
looks like Bezos and Blue Origin is making old grey hair look like the 2nd rate shope - Besos always win
"If You think you've failed in binary option and Forex trading I'm glad to introduce you to the most amazing manager Mr Brad Johnson In fact all hope was lost until I met him this amazing manager who changed my life within one week,My friends I will forever be grateful to him for helping me recover all my losses. Words cannot explain or express how grateful i am. If you have lost a lot while trading then give Brad a trial."
Here is your chance to buy under $20 a share
"Hope you guys are read for the slow drop to the 15’s. Today it might close at 19.5. Monday at 18. Then 18.5, 18.3 , 17.9, 18.10 and so on until 15."
"I am , NOT, lower price means more buyers.We will power this back to $60Just Buy/Hold"
Now we see why Branson sold all his shares long ago.
"finally down to 20 again, time to buy back"
There are too many available rooms at the Hotel Encanto for me to entertain the thought of a flight this weekend.
"There are no rooms available on October 13, 2021 to accommodate the number of guests on your request. Consider reserving multiple rooms.October 13, 2021 - October 14, 2021 is not available Hotel Encanto Las Cruces."
Nothing likely to bring it higher till mid 2022. They may have to raise cash by then as well. Has more room to go lower for awhile
Good opportunity to add in more. Will be buying at $16. Branson's gonna put his money to pump this.
Great stock for the long term. Will be 'bumps in the road'. Will add on 'opportunities'. Stock to put away in safe. Just hold and reap rewards.
$25 close....buy the stock not the calls.
"Today is certainly not an easy day. Good luck to all longs, and know that if it trades down to $17, I'll be joining you on the wait for a recovery."
How low will it go today?
can we see 50% growth?
I think $spce investors are coming over here... looking really good
Flight delay means Virgin will need cash to fund operations. Don’t be surprise next week for shares offering at $15 or less.!!!!!
"News – Virgin Galactic $SPCE is beginning its 8-month refurbishment process this month and delaying the Unity 23 spaceflight to next year, with commercial service now expected Q4 2022 at the earliest. Bad news guys..very bad news.."
That's it. I am done here. Taking the 30% losses and I am out.
How long is the enhancement period expected to be?
Should I buy more shares when it opens or see if it falls further during the day???
I I was short after hrs yesterday. I would cover at the OPEN!There is wide interest in SPCE in this level.
NOT AGAIN UH !!!
1 year waiting for nothing explain 5 quarters loses reports3 dilutions 2B loses Eventually only Test flight
getting close to very attractive buy zone
dont buy calls....BUY THE STOCK! and it will close at $25
"Sold all My $SPCE shares at a 15% loss today. It was my second biggest position. On the other hand, that money is now going into $RKLB. Expect seeing me a lot in here from now on. Will buy a rocket lab shirt if the company treats their shareholders well lol"
When is the Italian SPCE flight now?
"Bears are spreading misinformation, these are the actual facts below:- Commercial flight was previously scheduled for late Q3 2022 and got delayed by one month to Q4 2022.- Test flight got delayed to around mid 2022.- Virgin Galactic will make upgrades to their spacecraft during this time to make it even better.- This sell-off is purely based on emotion & fear, no logic behind it. Buy the dip."
"Waiting to get 1,000 more at 16. Dead money for a year, so all you margin calls go, weak hands bye. Gimmie my shares please. Don’t fight it"
I'm so tired of this stock crashing all the time.. When will we have relief.
Guesses on announcement date for Italian flight now that BO is done?
I got mine this morning at $$20.50!!!! Yehawww
Definitely the first person i can trade confidently with . I have been getting so much joy investing all because of my earnings. Thank you so much Michele Sperber You can contact via T**elegram> Michelesperberfx
Insiders have not sold since august. Big Wigs will put a spin on this monday. Evidence is they have already kept their price target
"Anyone who claims to have a source of material non-public information from within the company is lying. Look at it this way - if you knew, would you tell everyone, causing a premature spike in share price (assuming anyone believed you) or buy all the calls you can afford at a deflated share price and sit quietly, waiting for the news to break? The only loyalty anyone here has to anything, is money."
People's life are at stake.Good for SPCE.Safety is more important than SP.Sorry
No flight? what happened did they crash?
"I averaged in around 60, not worried! "
Let's create a short squeeze we are proud of!
"SpaceX is now a $100 billion valuation. If they ever decide to go public, I predict it will be the single largest IPO ever! He’s said he won’t but if he does, who here wouldn’t invest in Elon and SpaceX?!"
