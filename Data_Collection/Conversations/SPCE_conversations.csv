Just too much good news starting to pour in for the shorts. Holding down SPCE is going to become a dangerous game for them.
2 Space Stocks Wall Street Predicts Will Rally by More Than 50%https://stocknews.com/news/spce-maxr-2-space-stocks-wall-street-predicts-will-rally-by-more/
"Don`t sell or buy now, wait till afternoon! The manipulators activated the bots!"
The bulls will show up and keep it running from now until the next flight.
Stay focus we need a bull run
22% jump to $33 
"The rumors of purchase of Boeing to Virgin Galactic, do not stop. Yesterday we could read an article in which Boeing's interest in the Virgin chain was taken for granted. Let's not forget that it participates in its shareholding. A giant like Boeing is like a Trolla horse in Virgin Galactic. When you are interested, you can launch an offer for your shares. I do not rule out this operation in the future. I think Boeing will let Virgin Galactic grow ... but the day it presents the supersonic Match 3 plane, along with Rolls Royce, the truce will end and it will try to buy it. I do not rule out the $ 500 share."
"If u can not hold a stock, don’t buy"
"Someone already knows something. Nobody invests almost 18 million dollars and buys almost 700,000 shares, if they don't have inside information. It may be that someone already knows the real number of demand for new flights, with the price of 450,000 dollars. That can be a great upstream catalyst."
Lol shorts here are terrified lmfao. So funny to read their hopes and dreams on this board
"At 5:50 pm on Wednesday, a trader executed a block trade above demand for 684,824 Virgin Galactic shares at $ 25.25. The exchange represented a bullish bet of $ 17.29 million."
$15 tomorrow because somebody from company sold 10K shares (0.5 seconds living offer in the list of offers during trading day) for the price of a new expensive car. 7 billion dollars company will become 5 billion in 1 day because someone sold shares for the price of the farmer tractor.
"tha nasdaq is crashing, 19 coming"
Holding strong
"Cowen's Oliver Chan just reiterated TP $51, Outperform"
"According to the article from Barron's about bubble stocks. Sorry, but how can virgin galactic be a bubble stock with a solid business model and only 35% past 12-month return? I'll appreciate the explanation. Thank you."
"Oh my, it has gone very quiet on here, where are all the Branson cashpoint comments, where is the poor soul who suggested this was going to $15. Let's hope they didn't bet the house on shorting this one.....we did try and warn them"
$27 today????
Better cover.
"Hey Sir Richard Branscam, I got an idea! Let's make an IPO on every anthill around your mansion. When there's no more ant hills to IPO, we could IPO all the hornets nests dangling off your place."

market is getting positioned for the next VG move as i see elevated activity on the options board
"I wanted to share a rumor that has reached me ... Wall Disney sources would be interested in taking an equity stake in Virgin Galactic. The good relations between the two companies make the latter want to offer a space package, as a star, of its new creation, a theme park, focused on space."
"I still consider myself a novice in trading and have been long in space since it was originally under $15 and since I've seen run up to max highs to fall completely back down to the bottom multiple times.... now to the present, This company has NEVER been in better position :) yea shares were diluted.. so what?! we now have over 1 billion in cash to support testing till we're ready for paid customers, add Sir' Richards trip to space and upgrades to our space fleet which will allow them to have more trips between maintenance periods. Add all the future utilities this technology will have moving forward.. what else I'm I missing? point is we are better today than ever before AND shares under 30? I'll take it "
"Isnt there next flight coming in september. 2,2 million paid by Italians? This could drive price up in september."
"Just bought 20,000 shares at 25.57"
￼ my dear friends don't get too exciting just only the beginning remember Tesla electrical car in the future it's going to be Electrical spaceship potential of this company it's huge just be patient sincerely to all my dear friends￼￼
Any reason why it's going down today?
"Super Noticion ... Confirmed ... According to Aleanna Crane, Virgin Galactic vice president of communications, about 1,000 people have deposited the money in cash ... 450,000 X 1000 people ... 450 million dorares ... They opened the sales of new flyers on August 5, 2021. It's official."
Some Short sellers are trying despererately to lower the stock.They will be removed from the face of the earthGoing Up Brutally (when we will receive this new injection of capital)
"Okay, I'm out. Good luck to all that are still holding. I might buy back in later this year, but I'm going to pay my wife's car off instead of holding this and watching it continue to drop."
We need a assist Elon! We need a quick tweet!
They gave you time to buy at 25 remember this!going much higher!
"AMC Entertainment (NYSE: $AMC) Explodes +22% Higher As We Reveal Our Newest Trade Idea LIVE from Bora Bora, French Polynesia  Link >> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCbUjnc6j58"
Huge consolidation in the $25-$26 range which bodes well for a breakout soon…..
"Rumor ... Morgan Stanley predicts that Virgin Galactic could have a reserve list of 1,100 passengers (new millionaires) at the new price of 450,000 dollars per seat. This can be the fundamental catalyst, to go to record highs ... 62.5 dollars. Only the confirmation of the company is missing. It seems that the institution that invested 17 million dollars already knew this information."
"To say that Branson uses Virgin as his private cashier is not to understand things. This man has created 350 companies. With your money and your shares, you do what you want. If due to the pandemic, you have had to undo your Virgin positions, to help your other companies, you have the right to do so. Let's not forget that you are the largest shareholder. They want to make decisions on the board, buy 10 million shares and possibly give them an armchair to make decisions, but if you are an investor with 5,000 euros, you will not expect the founder to pay much attention to you. Here some believe a piece of investor, but they do not move even 10,000 euros and pretend to give advice and order, how things have to be done ... to a man who has a fortune of 5000 million. If you don't like it, sell today, not tomorrow and go to another company ... Or better yet ... with your 10,000 euros, create your company and get it listed ... Oh of course ... you don't have that capacity ... Well, if you don't have it ... don't criticize so much and let the board of directors make their decisions ... And if you don't like them, invest in the 200,000 companies that are listed in the world."
"Buy cheap and hold long. How hard is that, really?"
Tomorrow we will open $30 plus dollars￼ Huge huge short covering
Only patience.
Breakout?????
Smart investors consider a 25% haircut a buying opportunity. Nothing about the company or financials has changed. Not even the sale of a small amount of Branson holdings matters because somebody else owns those shares today.
"I'm in this game for the long haul, i see this as a $200 SP by 2025. and it will go beyond the longer we hold it. Believe in the future of the company and its profitability will come sooner than most people think. As WB says, you buy / invest in a company to never sell, you sell when you need some cash to suit and improve your life and lifestyle and or get financial freedom, This is TESLA 2.0"
"Lee W, don't pay any attention to Sam. The higher the price went and held today, the more desperate his posts were. From mentioning another dilution to Chamath selling shares. Sad and unoriginal."
Bought 3k shares @$44.00 … Not selling until $144.00
Why not just go straight to 100 and get it over with!! These down market days are too stressful!
Sept flight is on track despite all
36 coming
Breakout to $27?
"I believe that if you take the number of people on the site at any time, and divide the stock price by that number, and then take the inverse and multiply by the stock price, and then finally divide that number by 7.1264, you have an accurate guess of the stock price 12 days after the next earnings report."
"Whatsssss? 35 hahahahahah please!!!!! is inovation, is amazing . dont sell bellow 350 usd"
Any interesting books?

"I considering yahoo a good place to understand what ppl think about SPCE, I keep seen contrast between believer and negative regarding VG. So let's ""fight"" with our thumbs !!! (Always peace )I would like to see how many we are with VG and how many are against VGTo all genuine investors and believer in VG please hit the  Dear shorts please enjoy and hit I personal trust this company and the future of a global space revolution so for me is .

"I'm no expert in trading but have made $17,000 within $1500 investment, I had good guidance with Mrs Cindy Patty and her team, it's beyond eye opening with her teachings and trading skills. I've nothing but continued success... you can contact her via Telegram @ Cindypatty"
bought an equivalent amount of money I have in VG into Virgin Orbit. They all help each other
it just wants to fly again.
I’m going to remain patient with this before I buy my shares back. I think the first couple weeks of September to be a bit rough for the market and I don’t expect a flight announcement until September 15th at the earliest. I still think I’ll be getting my shares back around 22 or 23.. we will see.
See how all the  vanish on green days ?
No idea whats happening here but glad to be a part of it
"Konrad surveyed 223 people with net worths greater than $1 million and found about 37% were interested in going to space. What's more, 20% were willing to spend 5% of their net worth to get there. ""Coupled with rising wealth, this implies a potential[$120 billion] market for commercial space over time, "" added the analyst.That is based on about 250,000 people with the means, and willingness, to travel to space. It's the total market and not the annual market. But with 660 flights able to serve less than 4,000 of the 250,000 each year, Galatic demand can stretch out for years.A Galactic spacecraft seats six. Konrad's average ticket price in 2030 is $500,000 per seat.It's a needed bullish take for the stock. Overall, Wall Street has grown lukewarm on Galactic after shares had a big run in 2020. Back about one year ago, 100% of analysts covering the stock rated shares Buy. But the stock was trading at about at less than $18 a share.Now with the stock at $26.88, only 36% of analysts, or four out of 11, rate shares Buy. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&P is about 55%. The average analyst target price is about $35 a share, implying gains of about 30%.Back in September 2020, when everyone rated shares Buy, the average analyst price target implied gains of more than 40%. Those are big implied gains. Wall Street seems to want a large potential return for investing in new markets."

Did Boeing invest in Virgin Galactic or just in Virgin Orbit?
Hotel Encanto Las Cruces is reportedly fully booked Sept 15 through 17th
"Virgin Orbit is going public. Can someone explain more, what does that mean for Virgin Galactic shares holders? Thank you"
https://stocknews.com/news/spce-maxr-2-space-stocks-wall-street-predicts-will-rally-by-more/
"Things are getting clear. Virgin galactic will start with 1 mother ship and 4 delta class spaceships making 400 flights which will help them make $1B revenue per spaceport. This doesn't mean they can't generate more revenue per spaceport or add more spaceport. By 2023 they can meet 2400 passengers per year demand and as the demand goes up, they keep adding more motherships and spaceships. How fast they can build motherships with the help of Boeing and how fast they can build spaceships inhouse is a mystery we don't know. How fast they TAM grows is another variable we will only know in future."

We you least expect it. Then boom  Good news 
"SPCE – The commercial space sector is advancing rapidly, driven by significant investments in research and development. Given the industry’s solid prospects, Wall Street analysts expect space stocks Virgin Galactic (SPCE) and Maxar (MAXR) to rally by more than 50% in the near term. So read on to learn why these stocks may be worth a flier."
"Baggies are what the apple, microsoft, amazon, tsla, google and many more longs would have been called years ago. Ignore these shorts that want to steal your money."
"The analyst says Virgin Galactic has a simple business model focused on building spacecraft to meet demand. He expects the company to have four spacecraft by 2025. According to the analyst, the company's business model has been scaled down through recent flights and there are upcoming catalysts for actions, including the reopening of seat sales and concrete plans to increase spacecraft capacity"

Breakout happening….
2020 summary: $238K Revenue!?!? -$645mil Earnings!?!Is this a joke????
"I'm starting to think that Yancarlo, RT7, and Lee, are the only reliable sources on this board."
I am long on this stock but I am not happy with Branson treating this like an ATM machine and the way they keep quiet regarding to the offering.
Just thinking about the thousands of millionaires booking trips for 450000! Peanuts to them! When they see all their buddies booking trips that lead to several millions in stock being bought!!
"I recommend those holders who have US citizenship - to connect the United State Securities and Exchange Commission about Virgin Galactic SPCE share price manipulation evidence. Algorithmic bots were found in the list of offers since the time when the share price was $49 ($53 Pre-Market). The criminals use 6 algorithmic bots to control the price of SPCE totally. They switch it off to increase the price and turn it on to decrease price - so the bots offers in the list are the 75 - 100 percent of the ""right now price"" offers and so the criminals may control the price. The bots do not allow the price to rise and they drag the price down if the really existing shareholder is trying to sell. The bots offers are blinking in the center of ""sell and buy"" list of offers only during the New York stock exchange session simultaneously with the price starting to decrease. The criminal gang with SPAM shares totally control the share price of the company. This SPAM bots has quantity 4244, 3700, 3000, 1544, 1000, 100. Everyone can repeat this research during NY session. SEC employees can find the owners of these bots. According to anonymous information, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) employees trading the SPCE options may be suspected in this, so it may be a serious financial crime. If you don`t want the SPCE price to go down any more, then please connect to SEC as soon as it is possible. I don`t have US citizenship so I don`t have enough influence to change this sad circumstances created by the criminals."
There's enough time and opportunity to update these space planes for around-the-earth long trips :) Not that big of a technical change but very big news if confirmed! 
"#spce next week our mission guys.disclose asap the true information of virgin Galactic.Remember Richard ScamSon have a good company and he wants to dump us strongly.- flight 4x times without any issues.- Vice president & Communication Aleanna Crane needs to confirm the sellings. (almost sold out, they had a waiting list, you can verify)1100 tickets X 450.000$ = half billion min- Unity 23 mission mid September 2021. Italian Air Force Scientific missionpaid tickets 4x 600.000$ = 2400.000$ MinBasically you can presell tickets like any airlines for year and you are not obligated to deliver quickly. you can play stock with their money and improve vss imagine, the next model.So why the hell, Richard ScamSon and their team remain silent like he was in a library.It's obvious what he wants. help me disclose the true information. and if Richard ScamSon sell again he will loose the board."
Open 30???
everybody knows that's this stock Will eventually become a 500 dollar stock next year right?
Are you not entertained!?!?
"""Would you like to travel to Space?""Yes, I would like to"
Recommend not shorting this stock at this stage. Either sell shares or hold. Too risky. Jmho
"The Italian Air Force investigators and the Virgin Galactic crew are ready. They have worked with the Italian National Research Center (CNR), for the design of the experimental loads.Medical instruments will measure the biological effects of the transition phase from gravity to microgravity in the human body.The Unity 23 ... is in the preparation phase, before starting the flight and bringing new revenue for Virgin. It was another quarter with revenues, which multiplied the 570,000 dollars of the previous quarter"
What's' for breakfast? Fried shorts!
"I get the feeling this is fixing to go through the roof, Virgin Orbit spac is going to bolster investor sentiment"
Stock is changing from weak to strong hands
What's up with +4% pm. Any news?
Fasten your seatbelt we are taking off perfect home run just in the beginning strong strong strong bye
Can't get hyped too quick and honestly don't care much about these small gains as I'm a long term investor and believer in this company. I welcome dips as they allow me to increase my ever-growing position. It's a long but victorious road ahead so let's just enjoy the ride 
Read your technicals. RSI and stochastic are looking very positive for an uptick. Cheers.
cup handle almost complete
"Nothing is what it seems ... When the CEO sold shares for 70 or 80 dollars. Everyone saw it wrong and said they did not believe the company ... 18 months later it went from 25 dollars to almost 450 dollars. Market manipulation can make you panic and sell your shares at a loss ... I must be weird, I like to sell when it goes up and buy when it goes down. The prices right now are a bargain. In less than 12 months you can get 100% out of it. My decision is clear. I do not sell a single share and I want to see the three figures ... Minimum 100 or 150 dollars."
The train is slowly leaving the station…..
Does anyone know who was on the last eve flight??? Any passengers?
there goes Eve to skies todayhttps://twitter.com/virgingalactic/status/1430650482893238274?s=19
I hope no shorts actually thought yesterdays drop was SPCE stock on it's own. That would be ashamed not to have realized it was a maketwide drop.
Reddit is here!!!
"To all the longs, clame down. AMD and Tesla was like this a couple of years ago. Up and down 5-10% nearly everyday for ages. They are both up thousands of percent. Give this time until we start making money and sending normal people up. Probably another year or two and I'm sure we'll be $150+. I'm gonna wait. Just my two cents."
Very strong chart today pulling the price above $30 soon
$35+ Next week strong by and forever hold
Positioning above $30 today would be great. That's just the price when sudden spikes occur for this stock. 
By the look of it theyre taking the next 500 million.
What’s happening?
everyone talks about Italia airforce flightis it bigger catalyst than FAA and Branson flight? I don't think so I believe the only way for this to go higher is high demands and unfortunately they won't give us ticket info until the earning
Always hottest in the dog days...long

Spce has no plan beyond tourism. VO is a testament.If you can read between the lines.
one more day less to the blast off
So the $3.2 billion Virgin Orbit investment made by Boeing is actually great news even for Virgin Galactic IMO because they both use very similar technologies. But even so I honestly believe nothing much is going to drive this stock until revenue starts coming in!
"This company is the only one out there with innovative concept of space flight! The economy of the solution and the possibility of space tourism and civil space investigations is just a few of the elements that make this company one of a kind. So don’t listen to bashers, I am buying while is still undervalued"
"Good buy below $23.50. If you wait till early 2022, you will take it around $43"
Holding the bag @ 50$
"In light of all recent economical and geopolitical developments, the company and its potential look as lucrative and exciting as ever if not more so. One thing I'm really hoping for is that RB will merge all of Virgin companies especially Virgin Orbit and Galactic into one and will IPO it as opposed to SpaceX and Blue Origin which are majorly staying private and would only IPO a portion of them"
it will be back to $24 a peice.
May see $10 pop at some pt!
"Can't wait to see what happens first (1) secondary announcement, or (2) cancellation of the Italian flight. What's your guess?"
"Perfect storm coming!! Heavily shorted, super hip company, Italian flight coming up next month and the announcement of deposits!! Combine all together with Wallstreet eta!"
40 dollar soon
Is there any publicly traded company that is a better short than SPCE?
When I read negative posts on this board it makes me think... Why are people spending so much time and energy when they not invested in the company? Are they doing it just to be nice or (more likely) will they profit from this stock falling.
"In an interview with the Financial Times, Michael Colglazier said the company plans to replace its current prototype spacecraft with two new ships next year, which are designed for easier maintenance, leading to faster changes between flights. . ""At each spaceport we are going to have a goal of 400 flights a year,"" Colglazier said. ""I hope to have between 8 and 9 to 14 spacecraft. The company will also look to expand its operations at its first base in New Mexico and"" find other spaceports around the world and start taking this to more places, ""Colglazier said."
"Time IN the market, not TIMING the market. That's the only hope for VG share holders. This company won't be profitable and 'justify' it's price for a decade.That said, the market is due a massive correction, with tech overpriced and speculative stocks going crazy. Given VG will have a quiet year after September's flight, I'll sell if we hit $50 and then buy back in early 2023."
"Why did VG increased the price from $250,000 to $450,000 per ticket? Too many people trying to buy a ticket? or does it cost more?"
What happened? I bought shares months ago and I assumed when I logged in today I would be rich? Did branson not make it into spce?
"if I am reading correctly, there will be a spaceport in Italy as well."
$27 today?????
"On this stock, 1 good news is all it takes to see $30-$40! Be patient & GL!"
"Go for 50 this week, and 100 afterwards"
Never been a better time to short SPCE! There is no real business here. There is underlying asset worth anything. How long until BK or liquidation?
Italian flight cancelled?
"Seriously, the shorts are working overtime driving the price down on very small volume. I wish the SEC would investigate this practice.. With level 3 data, Shorts know where all the stop lost orders are and they try to trigger them. So, what we all need to do is to remove our stop-lost order and that way, the price will go higher. Believe me."
I’m not selling a single share.
Any SPCE longs that are watching WISH? I'm watching and waiting to see what happens it may be something?
lol what's this RACKET all about today!?!
28$ today?
THIS IS ME WRITING AN ANGRY LETTER TO MR BRANSON. WHERE MY MONEY BOI?
"The accounts begin to come out. If Morgan Stanley recognizes that Virgin Galactic has 1,100 new millionaires willing to pay $ 450,000. It will be because it is true. If, in addition, Virgin's communications department recognizes 1,000, it is because the estimates are realistic. The CEO acknowledged that the maintenance operations that will be carried out this year and the next. They will facilitate that the ships go from making 10 flights and revision to 100 flights and revision. The company itself has said that they want to make 400 flights a year, from each space airport. The estimates indicate that 3 will be made. If we add to this that they want to build 5 new spaceships ... The demand will be covered. According to statistics, there are 266,000 millionaires, with a net worth of more than 30 million. That is 1.5% of your wealth. It is logical that if you took 1.5% of your money away, to live something unique in life you would do it. Virgin Galactic, it will be profitable and the large shareholders know it. Between Vanguard, Blackrock, Morgan Stanley ... they have a billion invested in Virgin. It is curious that Morgan, has used his power to lower the action. Their only objective is to lower the shares, to buy them and a third party. For me the next climb will be the good one. Speculators and retailers, who wanted to get rich in a few days, have been thrown out of action. I believe that the institutions have already taken their position or are on the way to taking it."
"Link, where it is discussed why you should buy Virgin shares: ... https://finance.yahoo.com/m/14507c55-5e6c-39af-9077-9a7fa8119a8e/3-meme-stocks-that-might-be .html"

"@RPM. You actually question the Longs honesty. Do you read this board and the amount of false allegations, predictions and lies the shorts post. It's like 10 to 1."
"Is SPCE the scam of the year, decade, or century?"
"The igmorants who were looking at Virgin, a company with income and profits. They were wrong. Nobody put a gun to their head to buy Virgin. Those of us who are in it are because of its prospects and because it is a new sector with great growth. It only takes time and patience to multiply the capital. I do not understand, how some are scandalized that Virgin does not make money. That shows that they know little about the stock market. If you are looking for companies, with income and benefits, Virgin is not the one. For that they have hundreds of companies. The problem is that these companies do not multiply their price and Virgin does and will continue to do so ... Before buying a company, people should know what they want. Virgin is a forward-looking company ... a multi bagger."
"If you have 10 millions, would you spend 5% of your networth on a few minutes joyride? I wouldn't. I can think of much more exciting things to do rather than risk my life. Beautiful women, cars etc."
Under $100 a bargain!
"""Branson risks losing control over Virgin Galactic board"" <- he's not going to sell - this is his life and blood and hard work, why would he leave something he started? Makes no sense. Analysts are liking this stock, so boo hoo to news"

I thought this was going to 17? Lol
I was not able to attend the virtual annual meeting yesterday. Was there any mention of the up coming flight or any update to planned maintenance?

"Dear bagholders, this is a public service announcement. What would it take for you to realize that you have been scammed, that you have bought or are buying the insiders shares who have cashed out and are continuing to cash out, and for you to realize that there is zero future for this company other than bankruptcy and liquidation? All the facts are there already. The insiders have dumped and continue to dump. There is no way to run this so-called business profitably. There is no endless pipeline of business. There is no technology here to spin into another business. Knowing all of this, what would it take for you to come to your senses that you will lose all your money on this scam SPAC?"
"Shorts, don't forget. You will lose all your money!!!$100 Stock!!"
"Ok the war is on ! By the end of the day, volume with be higher.. Shorts will be covering or will have to do during after market hour at a higher price. Believe me."
Blue origin is losing a lot of its top brass. I’d be willing to bet this is going to increase confidence in SPCE as the markets find a bottom and investor confidence goes back up.
Take the money and run. Buy back at $24.00 again. Rinse repeat.
This is a lovely short term play. We are very bullish due to several technical indicators points SPCE to the moon. I think it's got the potential to reach $100+ in the near term. https://chart-analysis.tools/SPCE
Super cool to part of this new space age tourism Bonanza!! What super futuristic spaceship we have!! Glad to be ALIVE to see this through into the future!
"contrary to past couple days movement, I added to my short position again today. I see more downside ahead. puts set at $21."
"Same people who denied EV revolution are doing the same with space tech. smh we live in an advanced age, and don't need to wait for decades for events to move forward quick."
"As I see it, the company follows their plan (yes, it’s not easy to put a metal thing in the space safely), they did well their tests and put his founder in the space proving that it really works. Insider selling: Branson sells because his group is suffering right now, covid still affecting in case you didn’t notice; Chamath Palihapitiya took his profit as everyone here would do to continue his spac journey. In terms of quality: Virgin’s product is good, they haven’t experienced fatal issues as for instance ASTR experienced recently, they preferred to delay their flights (wise move). Even in terms of dilution they did the right for the company at this stage you aren’t sure about financials, and money it’s very important in space industry, just remember there was no non governmental company doing something like this (maybe SpaceX but they were backed by NASA which saved them from the bankruptcy). And finally, yes the price is very high for the most of us, but vehicles like bugatti or ferrari or cloths like moncler or LV are expensive as well, and they still existing."
I guess we will just have to see where this is going huh 
"this is a company everyone wants to give money,l guess its off to the moon"
16 September will be the lunch of the Italians
"Hey bagholders, this is a public service announcement. Please listen to the earnings conference call. Management will surely give you the inspiration to ride your investment to zero. A real confidence inspiring group LOL wow -> https://investors.virgingalactic.com/events-and-presentations/They talked alot about how they are almost done with new designs that will some day be complete, that when built some day will allow them to fly more often some day. WOW amazing. How is this a company?"
I'm confused please Help. The mother ship is going into maintenance for several months. Will there be the Italian flight next month?
His moves are obviously put more toward the development the Mach3 Delta Class being funded. Doesn't matter how he moves his money around to achieve the goal as long as it gets done. If you have stock in it it's gold.
Seriously did any one of you ACTUALLY READ the article instead of the eye popping headline .. he STILL OWNS 42.3 MILLION shares or 22% .. so he sold 10Million of his 52 million.. if he didnt believe in his own company he would not still own 42 million shares .. this headline was intended to help shorts and scare longs into selling... jesus people try READING things ...
I am still green. my average is 22 and change.
I am truly worried about our stock market. With all the problems Mr. Maggo is creating worldwide he is worrying about student debt. We are getting into some serious dodo.
"When will the secondary be announced? They will need at least another $500 million to stay solvent through 2026. They are burning around $375+ million per year with zero revenue, so in mid 2025 they will be out of cash. Do they raise more cash now, or do they wait?"
28.12 today
"Is it true that the chairman of this SPCE SPAC, Chamath Palihapitiya, sold all of his holdings in this scam?"
Huge consolidation this week at $25 range which is good thing going forward…Selling is done…
$33 price target by end of year when it’s about 6 months away from commercial flights not now that its 12 months away. Just my opinion
BRO... I TOOK A BREAK FROM VIEWING MY PORTFOLIO BEFORE BRANSON’S FLIGHT THINKING IT WAS GOING TO 100 AND I COME OUT OF MY BARN LOOKIN LIKE
"You can laugh at me ... it's free ... But it gives me a ride on Virgin Galactic ... until the new flight of the Italian Air Force ... and I think that before the flight, they will release the news of the real demand of new millionaires, who are willing to pay $ 450,000 ... Mr. Market, is able to put Virgin back to $ 60 between September and October ... Stranger things I have seen on the stock market ... And it is not a buy recommendation, nor sell recommendation ... nor a divinatory power ... just my intuition tells me"
at least Branson will have a choice what to sell down next timw
"The Virgin Orbit thing ... tells us one thing ... The market is willing to put a lot of money in this type of space companies ... Orbit, is dedicated to launching satellites from a modified Boeing ... and it is seen that the They like this idea ... It's similar to what Virgin Galactic does with its spaceship ... A mothership lifts it and drops it ... The engineers ... at Virgin Galactic and Orbit have shared ideas in that regard. ..And a whole giant like Boeing, has bought the idea from them ... So the market is real ... money that wants to enter too ... So the future is Virgin"
23% to go to $33 
33 by Friday
"My price target is $100+ , so not selling till we get there."
"But the upside could also be worth waiting for. At $450,000 or more per ticket, the company could generate nearly $3 million from each flight given the six-seat capacity. And if the company can reach its goal of 400 flights per year, a spaceport could generate $1.2 billion in revenue."
$27 here we come….
BRANSON!!!!!!
Funny how mentioning to sell it all you get is down thumbs. I sold at $54.00 a few months ago and got the same reaction because as we all know stocks always go up. LOL
Strong Bullish movement. Definitely
This is a 1 trillion dollars per share stock. The poor are lining up to buy their 450k per 11 minute ride 
What is a company worth today that has no business until 2024 and when it does begin business generates losses with each transaction?
"Some News, would be great!"
"When there's no news, this stock moves sideways for a couple of days then down.It pops on good news. Always the unanticipated happens as well like wall street recently liking the mothership upgrades. The only thing I can see that will make it pop that's imminent are the test flights we're expecting in September. If that's still on. Otherwise down."
"They said same things about Apple sales and look where the stock is. Virgin Galactic is they iPhone of space. People first question the rationale for the space travel and as people line up, you find the naysayers also in line."
Jefferies initiated SPCE rating to Buy 
"Virgin Galactic initiated with a Buy at Jefferies Jefferies analyst Greg Konrad initiated coverage of Virgin Galactic with a Buy rating and $33 price target. The company's ""attractive outlook"" is boosted by supply ramping with additional spaceships driving capacity to 660 flights per year by 2030, up from capacity of roughly 36 today, Konrad tells investors in a research note. The desire to explore space coupled with an addressable market that could approach $120B of potential future demand supports a rise to $1.7B of revenue by 2030 for Virgin Galactic, says the analyst."
Nothing to be worried about. Probably just insiders selling stock again.
"I bet if the space ship blew up this stock would be higher , the guy went to space on Sunday we thinking we going to moon on Monday and he decided to sell shares and tank it I’m a bad holder at $52 should have sold at $60 but he went to space and I was to go to the moon next day"
Over 50% down from when he went to space
"I am holding long term. Its all a sell the news event. Some understand the time frame for VG to really capitalize of its innovation which appears to be a few years. Always tough to make a commitment to holding watching all the shenanigans. I just keep looking at Amazon when I had it at 40 dollars, long sold, FB at 50 long sold. The list goes on. So moral of the story is do your DD and stick by your decision as long as nothing big changes and you will be rewarded."
400 space flights per year
Nice to see some green action for once. Hopefully the beginning of a new trend.
"Some believe that Branson, with a fortune of $ 5 billion, is thinking what a shareholder thinks who invests $ 5,000 or $ 10,000 in his company. This man has created a Holding of companies. This man has created 360 companies. He will know something about the business sector. Surely more than all of us together. Because surely all those companies have given you problems at some point. I don't understand, investor kids, when they say that Branson has stolen from them. Richard, has taken out 500 million dollars, to keep growing. Create ships and airports. It's just 10 million shares ... out of 240 million that Virgin has ... a 5% dilution. As it is a business name, he has decided to sell a part of Virgin, to continue to maintain his other companies. At no time has he ceased to be the maximum shareholder, with the power of the board, to direct the future of the company. To those kids, who are starting in this world of the stock market ... I must tell you, if they think they are smarter than Branson, try to create their own company and go public. I'm not saying they create 360 companies ... just get one. Stocks have volatility. Look at the Tesla chart ... Downs and rises of 50% and one good day ... It starts to rise and does not stop ... Result ... All those shareholders who remained calm today are millionaires. The rest will continue to insult Musk."
"Buy Virgin Galactic stock because 250,000 people want to go into space. (And you can afford it)."
"Sincerely. Does anyone believe their own words? When you say that until September 2022, Virgin will not offer any new news? This company, at any time can release a news and make the price go up 40/50% or more. And some will wonder ... and what can they say? One good morning they can release a piece of news, referring to an agreement with a space agency in a country in the world. Another day, an agreement with an airline, whereby the latter wants to buy 10 Virgin spacecraft for its fleet. Another day, they can tell us that 1000 new millionaires are willing to pay 450,000 dollars. On another occasion, Disney buys tickets to raffle at its space theme park. We can get up with the news that a multinational pharmaceutical company hires an exclusive plane from Virgin, for a year, to carry out medical experiments in space. They can tell us that they already have the supersonic plane ready and that Boeing wants to build 100 planes of this type. We can read that multinationals buy tickets for their managers, as a way to pay them, for their services. Even, as an idea, marriage agencies, hire all the places, so that a person gets married in the space or asks for marriage up there. I don't want to bore you by quoting news. But there would be many. It is a pioneering sector, untapped. With infinite possibilities. The impatient will lose money for sure. But the patient investor will become a millionaire. Ask those who invested in Tesla, Apple, Amazon ... and even bitcoin. Good investments are not made in months ... but in years. Some investors say that they have sold at a loss and that they will return in September 2022. They know little about investing. This company in 10 years, will be listed above 1000 dollars. No analyst, has made accounts, of the business possibilities of this company. Simply because they do not know each other. Amazon began by selling books. No analyst, saw his business in the future. Today it sells everything. The less intelligent, just see, that Virgin Galactic, is going to dedicate itself to going up and down from space. But the smartest, we see more potential, we see the innumerable business possibilities. You can cover countless companies and find synergies. If you are not able to envision the future, you should not invest in Virgin. If for you, the long term is a month and you cannot wait to see the events, you should not invest in Virgin. Many of us are not going to sell a single share, because we do not follow the herd. We want extraordinary results and those are only achieved by doing something different from the rest."
"what the great news now, start buying n the ceo will dump stock again hahaha"
"In addition to space tour, there are many other space events to be explored: space engagement, space marriage, space children, space UFC, space…………."

What’s everyone’s thoughts on ASTRA space
Here is the way I see it. Next year when they have third quarter earnings call in late October or early November we should get some clarity on flight frequency and earnings potential for2023. If the maintenance goes as planned and they start commercial flights in July or August they will have had several months of operations in by then. Hopefully enough flights to get a feel for future turn around time. Perhaps a third spaceplane will be in the picture by then. Just speculating on my part. Also an estimate of the number of spaceplanes to be built in 2023. I would guess we will hear something yet this year on the new ticket sales. Once the September flight is over it will seem like forever until things start to happen again. That is where the patient investor will struggle to remain patient.
They had some interesting insights about SPCE on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"There are many youtubers that you see when they go into their garage and have a couple of ferraris. lamborghinis, AMGs, and Bentleys. and live in a 10 million+ dollar mansion. That's just them, Musicians. Haven't even started on the big guys. The customer base is outrageious."
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Pick-stocks.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
Buy in the teens if-when it gets there. Likely goes up later this fall. Word up
imagine the statement if he sold the airline to fund spce instead.
"Confidential. All the data that you will read in this message has been provided by Virgin Galactic publicly. First of all, Virgin's CEO said they want to make 400 annual flights, from 3 different airports. Obviously, that will not be in 2022, but it will progressively happen. 400 flights through 3 airports ... We get 1200 flights per year. If we consider that each plane can carry 6 passengers, that gives us 7,200 space tourists (private astronauts). If 7200 passengers, we charge an average of 450,000 dollars. That brings us to a scandalous figure of $ 3.2 billion annually ... Worthy of one of the best companies. That income ... makes the calculations vary considerably. And give us a 4-digit number. Logically, for that capital is needed ... for the creation of new airports, new space planes and supersonic planes. We are inside a multibagger (what Peter Lynch likes the most). I do not recommend buying Virgin Galactic stock. What I can say is that ... if you are patient, you can become the new millionaires of the next decade. Virgin at $ 25 is a steal. People panic and don't have adequate vision. They are manipulated by what the bears, the analysts and the profiles who write on this page say. They do not affect me. I'm here ... to stay. I want to see the real potential of Virgin and honestly we have not seen anything of the prospects of this great company."
25% climb to 33% :) 
And the shorts making fun of me comparing to TSLA. If you put full page chact of 5 year candle and go back to 2-21 2013 beginning going forward Spce is right on schedule type of pattern. it's refusing to drop down completely but will take some dives. And actually taking a more progressive rise.
I hope we get back to 30s soon:)
It goes to $27 tomorrow
"VG will be quiet again until the next announcement. In the meantime in case anyone missed it:Mike Moses, Virgin president for space flight and safety, said an initial look at the data showed Unity came through its latest mission in great shape. “We’ve looked at the data, we’ve done our quick engineering walk around (and) the ship looks pristine, no issues whatsoever,” he said. “We’ll take our time, do all the detailed inspections, and then we’ll figure out when we’re ready to go again. But ship looked perfect.”NASA, the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Space Force agree that space effectively begins at an altitude of 50 miles where the atmosphere is so thin wings, rudders and other aerodynamic surfaces no longer have any effect. As a result, Branson, Bennett and Bandla are now considered full-fledged Virgin astronauts, a distinction granted to Mackay, Masucci and Moses after earlier test flights."
get positioned to the potential surprise announcements tmrw
Waiting for virgin galactic to introduce high speed point to point travel… now that will change the world and this company will be the biggest of them all
You shorts still here?
$100 + by the end of this year￼
$100 any day now …..
Big news 40 soon
I'm still holding all my shares but why was the maintenance window extended from 4 to 8 months pushing back commercial service in 2022?
"no cash equitry selling from big instiutions, i only think this is derivative instruments positioning"
"In Jefferies’ survey of individuals with over $1 million in net worth, a third of respondents expressed interest in going to space, with 20% willing to spend 5% of their net worth to do so.Millions of people have more than a million dollars.$100 Stock!!"
nice pump
Wow this board really died fast. It’s only 1 or 2 posts per hour these days…
Still 20% ahead to reach $33 
"You know, $100 Stock!"
"Jeffries iniciated, buy rating, Price Target 33$"
Some Shorts will have to cover this week imo.
"Virgin Galactic ... ""It is a train that starts, and then it will be very difficult to get on, as happened with the birth of the internet or with mobile phones,"" Ribas recalls. ""Whoever is not positioned in two or three years will only be able to enter by buying one of the companies that already exist. Let's look at Google, for example: it is barely 20 years old, but its position today is inaccessible. ”The sector will have a turnover of 1.1 billion dollars a year in 2040, a figure that the US Department of Commerce raises to 1, 5 trillion and quadruples the 350,000 million it generates now."
