VG wishes it could be SpaceX.
"No way do I sell....ride this storm people, solid gains happening soon!"
"Virgin Galactic said it wasn't clear if the issue is present in the company's vehicles and if any repair work is needed. It said that the delay is out of ""abundance of caution."""
After the successful flight with the Italians on board what will the price be up to?
VG is still the only space tourism company in the world already proving safe commercial service. How come investors haven't yet realised that SpaceX's mission has nothing to do with space tourism? It's far more riskier than that.
$27 today?
"Rhetorically speaking, how much would the Italians pay per person to use nasa as their shuttle service into space? Does the FAA determine the amount of time virgin stays suborbital or is it determined by mechanical durability? It may only be a 10min ride but time is money so could I pay more to stay longer?"
"Mission rescheduled for October 15 !!! No more wait and see vague launch windows. They encounter a problem, they pivot. VG is being proactive."
VG delaying a flight is as sure as the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.
"Check the video with the CEO respond, nothing really happens and everything on schedule for end of the month flight, easy $50 Virgin Galactic pushes back on 'misleading' characterizations, conclusions in report on historic spaceflighthttps://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/virgin-galactic-pushes-back-on-misleading-characterizations-conclusions-in-report-on-historic-spaceflight"
A buy order set for 18.50 if I can't get more oh well
"The bag was created, so that the impatient lose their money. It is very easy to guess in the forums, who is a smart investor and who has no idea about the markets. Here, many have come to play their money, as if they were in a casino. I have invested my money in Virgin, because I believe that the space sector will give a lot of money in the future. And not just with space flights. This technology will also be used for supersonic aircraft. Virgin is being born, as did Amazon, Tesla, Apple etc. Those who invested in the beginning, a decade later, are millionaires. Here many investors intend to become millionaires from one day to the next, and that honestly is almost impossible. Delays at Virgin are normal. They occur in all companies. Pharmaceuticals have delays, their drugs are not approved when they want. The FDA limits them, requires them to meet its requirements. Like the FAA, it is doing with Virgin. Those who don't know that get nervous. Those are the ones who lose money in the stock market. You will never see an intelligent investor get carried away by emotions and interested news from the media ... that are subsidized with money from bear funds."
Imagine caring about -4% when this stock does +50% in a day
"I take it for granted ... That daily, about 50,000 planes fly, more / less ... They all find winds in the sky ... Some suffer turbulence ... and have to go down to other heights or directly assume them ... That goes within pilot training ... The FAA knows this and knows that a pilot must be prepared for gusts of wind and must be prepared to improvise in the event of any inconvenience ... Is this research good? Well yes, better that, not that it had crashed. What happened is investigated and the go-ahead is given. The pilots have been able to solve a situation that occurs daily in commercial aircraft flights ... And for this reason, it is shown that in dire situations, you can fly and that no one is injured therefore ... I think that this same month, they give us the authorization, second, third week ... To start the flight at the end of the month, the beginning of October ... And in a while ... no one will You will remember the little light that lit up ..."
The red light has turn into green
The VG team needs to execute their plan and have results with successful flights. The stock will follow.
"Google space calendar = Unity 23 on schedule for October 15 mission. An ""all clear"" from the FAA (I am hopeful) will send SPCE rocketing to $30."
SPCE is not volatile stock anymore. It has a strong support at $25. BULLISH
Investors are tired
"News ... Susquehanna analyst Charles Minervino wrote that Virgin Galactic expects the FAA investigation to be resolved quickly, saying the company sees a way to fly its first trade mission within a month.The company acknowledges that Branson's flight dipped below its target airspace for about a minute and 41 seconds due to high-altitude winds, but says all protocols were properly followed and there was never any danger. Assuming the FAA agrees, the investigation is likely a formality and needs to be resolved quickly."
"First $33, then $55 and then $100.. No brainer.. STRONG BUY!!!"
"In certain investment circles, it is assumed that the FAA will give Virgin a yes to continue with its space flights. Relationships are cordial, they will work in space for many years. The inspectors have surely already made it clear to the space engineers to continue their flights. What if the FAA has demanded, that the flights must be monitored with them and know at all times the flight process. The agreement is total. The FAA wanted power and control in space flight from a private company and it has succeeded. Branson has been smart and has not wanted to go against the FAA. The two win and the flights will start shortly. Virgin continues with its preparations."
"Once VG starts flying $billionaires for real, this SPCE flies to $1000! I own 1000+ shares and am happy to HOLD."
"hmm, another bad day for the doom and gloomers. keep waiting for the teens and shorting..."
Simply Wall Street has a Fair Value on SPCE of $31.09.
"why is it so hard for people to understand that Virgin, Blue Origin and SpaceX are so dramatically different in their target markets. Even the analysts and these articles are clueless half the time. It's like clock work with this stock being up ONLY when the markets in general are getting clobbered. When the NAS is green.. this is always red."
someone knows something ... and the flight of spacex should get them to solve problems faster.
"We have not seen double-digit increases for a long time ... We deserve it ... And every day ... is one day less ... for the FAA to release its statement ... Spaceflight must continue and the FAA must not is going to prevent it ... security ... of course, nobody wants there to be an accident ... But science must advance ... and the conquest of space must continue ... Here we have a new sector ... it is a diamond in the rough, which many companies will have to polish ... Virgin is a purchase or a hold ... In the face of new catalysts ... Visionaries have much to gain in companies of this type ... Investor cleaning has been total ... and we only remain, those who do not get us out of value ... not even with boiling water ..."
I’m buying in tomorrow and averaging every 2k either way.
"Looking at Virgin Galatic, Blue Origin and SpaceX, it’s very clear that Virgin Galactic experience would be the best for majority of the space  travellers! SPCE is a clear winner and literally the stock price will go to the  "
just to think I sold all my shares before the launch a month ago (@ $51.00) and all the cheerleaders gave me a down thumb. So funny.
shorts are short lived.
This FAA news has to come immediately
Manipulation by hedge fund till Friday. They will keep price between 25 and 26.
Shorts are going to get blasted when FAA clears SPCE to resume flights. I for 1 don't feel bad at all.
Sam will lose aaaalllll his money!$100 Stock!!!
"This is my opinion, ok so they are going to delay. So what, it’s better than proceeding and have something catastrophic happen such as loss of life. Second, what two to four weeks, no big deal. Third and most importantly is that most will bail and we longs can average down. I’m buying more. BUY ON FEAR!!!!!! Fear will be bright and early Monday morning and will start to rebound half way through the day!"
Alright am back in sold at 50 and back in at 24.60. This airspace violation is no big deal they will be Airworthy soon to allow the Italian AF to fly.
"I’ve made good money on this stock twice before. Got burned somewhat on the last sell off to $40s vs selling at $55 because I was greedy and thought we’d hit an ATH post Branson. Still made great money though. Today, after months of waiting since I sold in July, I took this news and a down day in the market to purchase 20,320 shares at $24.75. Let’s see what the happens here when the FAA finally reversed course and going into the Friday before the Italian flight. Even mid to upper 30s or low 40s would be great!  I suspect others will be getting in soon as well."
Will hit 28 soon
Bought another 1000. Looking positive now.
"Don't listen to the bs that speculators and shorts write on this board, it's meant to manipulate your behaviour and expectations as investors. If speculators reject that this stock can act like a revenue generating company and rise on good operational indicators, why then do they expect it to fall on bad operational indicators? Don't panic, be rational and strategic. Cook those shorts!"
"Tired of hearing “bottom, buying opportunities” as a shareholder. When are we reaching all time high again?"
"When i was an investor in TSLA 6-7 years ago, UBS analysts and the likes almost every week downgraded stock refering to their old school metrics ))"
UP AGAIN UP AGAIN!!!!
"Finally starting to make money trading and learning a ton while following my guys on this platform https://dailytrading.tools/5p23p4 Their chat rooms are very friendly and comfortable, Lots of information given, seem really interested in helping people on their journey. I am so happy with this service that I have unsubscribed from every other stock market related email that I was receiving."
2 days in green and many more consecutive green ones in coming.. Its a no brainer. BUY $SPCE 30% upside when FAA approves again!!
FAA WILL LIFT SPCE GROUNDING NEXT WEEK. Be patient and Buy more. AND TO GROUNDING SPCE IS JUST ROUTINE CHECK OUT - NOTHING ELSE!35-37 by next FRIDAY
Alexander Elder already said it: - The rookies set the starting price of the day while the experts dominate the end of the same
Delay is necessary to lead to perfect test flight. THANKFULLY THEY CAUGHT FAULTY PART BEFORE ACTUAL TEST FLIGHT. ALL IS GOOD HERE.
"FAA leak , seems like things are about to get interesting.."
Close green today
They just have to remove the red lamp from the dashboard and the problem will be fixed.
I have to admit I am impressed on how Spce is holding up in this market. For some reason I just can’t get myself to pull the trigger and buy back in just yet..
Just checked google launch calendar: SEP25 mission still on schedule.
"With the overall market down this is holding support very well, think I’ll average down some. We will be getting three pieces of good news soon!"
"Virgin Galactic’s latest flight delay is not impactful to the long-term thesis on the stock, Truist analyst Michael Ciarmoli writes in a note. The company’s shares fell 3.3% in premarket trading on Monday on the news of the delay.The analyst notes that SPCE is working with a third-party supplier to determine if there is a need for replacement or just repairThe company also indicated that the issue isn’t related to the FAA investigation regarding the last flight in July, the analyst addsMaintained buy and PT of $50SPCE 4 buys, 5 holds, 2 sells; avg PT $35: Bloomberg data"
"The FAA was in the control room. Do you think the mission would have been completed if there was danger. In fact, the FACT that it moved from path and succeeded speaks to the viability of this endeavor, that's REALITY. Reality, is Virgin Galactic is creating infrastructure to send wealthy adventures to space and will rake money, several tons of it. Branson is uber connected and a visionary. Proven.Sending materials to space will also likely be a boon. The flight was an epic success and blasted on News Feeds Worldwide. Let that soak in...Opportunity for LONG TERM wealth when others are short sighted. P.S. Don't put it past Amazon for sneaking this hit job....Bezos ego is huge. Just saying, these things do happen."
Buy order in! I have a feeling good news is coming soon!
To the moon. And to the homeless shelter for the shorts
Who's still holding from $40 / 50 ? I'm not sold up there before the launch ($51.00) and got all down thumbs ... cheerleaders !
My Grandma's annual income is 5 times larger than $SPCE revenues. Can I trade my Grandma in the US Stock Market for $6 Billion? The US Stock Market is a Fraudulent system...
"Good news, faa removed grounding"
Inspiration 4
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Multistockalerts.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
Is this an actual company?
Wow.. Bought recently at $35. See ya at $10 dollars now maybe..
"WILL CLOSE IN GREEN !!! DELAY ONLY 2 wks TO CORRECT FAULTY PART IS A GOOD NEWS, indeed."
"So 1st FAA than the Parts issue. Both are good things happen to SPCE, you know why ? It shows the stability in SP as many bearish were saying 17$ SP. FAA approval will move the stock UP. Parts repair/ fix will further move the SP up. Italian Airforce next month flight will further move SP up. And than the game begin!!"
They had some interesting insights about SPCE on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
This job is getting tougher for shorts. The number of institutions holding shares has been increasing lately... Not small bets if you ask me.  The tide is turning!

"As soon as the FAA gives the green light, this will start to soar once again. Anybody have any info on a timeline? Are we talking hours, days or God help us weeks?"
We’re at the bottom  lesssss gooooo
Looks like some news going to come out soon
"WHERE SHE LANDS NOBODY KNOWS! Although I think this small correction during the Branson flight was probably not a bad thing, my guess is people are full of fear and the stock will go down down down. I mean look at the number of people still wearing masks who think it is protecting them and say it is protecting others. The fact is the mask doesn’t do anything to protect people based on science but people are afraid. I think there is a chance we could see 10-13$ inside the next month. Hold onto your wallet and wait this one out. I am long term bullish, but short term bearish. GLTA"
"Somebody has gone big into VG stock, id say a good few million shares, strong signal that news is coming !!!"
C'mon u can do it !
Shorts are shaking rn
Can't wait for all shorts here to go broke
"I know it's a different company, but I'm really excited about the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission that's happening right now - whilst it won't directly affect the share price, it will (hopefully) inspire a lot of people to want to make a spaceflight, and unless you have $50m to spare, VG is about the only way to go."
Rocket lab may be the better buy. I will put 50% into rocket lab and 50% into SPCE. One WILL take off in the near future
200$ stock let's go
Spce is going to have a big and strong future
Someone just bought big
The spring has started to coil. It has built-in a lot of potential energy and is about to Spring upside with full Kinetic energy to 40s.
This will go to 35 by end of September
"FAULTY PARTS DISCOVERED IS THE NORM IN ANY TECH COMPANY! THE MOST IMPORTANT MATTER IS THAT, they found out BEFORE THE TEST FLIGHT ACTUALLY HAPPENS ! IT IS INDEED A GOOD NEWS !"
"I do believe that VG has millionaires lined up still. Yet I haven't heard any lines forming over at Space X or Blue Horizon. Virgin Galactic is run by perfectionists. they'll get it right and sale a product like no other. besides, let's see how many spaceports are being built compared to......... Cape Canaverals"
"Things can change of course. But 10 days after a FUD article about high winds and an alleged component flaw, the Italian mission is still scheduled for the 25th of this month."
Close to 24.5 $
Up she goes on the top
Green Day.
"""High winds"" are no reason to suspend operations and everybody knows it. Maybe the SEC should take a look at who it is at the FAA sending emails to investment firms."
"Jefferies reiterates Virgin Galactic as buyJefferies reiterated its buy rating on the space flight company and says it’s not concerned about the timing delays of the next flight.“Recent events around the supply chain and a pending FAA incident report push out the next Virgin Galactic flight, Unity 23, and potentially could delay the following Unity 24 flight (Q3 2022). The offset is we view the Virgin Galactic story unchanged, with an expanding commercial space tourism market supporting a growing revenue base.”"
"New series on Netflix, Countdown, on Virgin galactic and tourism to space"

"I believe in this company and the the faa is doing this to protect virgin galactic, and the people that will fly on it. I believe as soon as they announce we’re flying again we will easily jump what we are losing today. Stay Long"
Go SPCE
"When the FAA clears VG, SPCE will jump into the 30s at Mach speed."
Wooo yes
Let’s see if it will bounce off 23.80 again. If not next stop will be around 22.50
I heard about SPCE the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"The day is approaching, the improvements are happening and soon we will be back in space.Virgin Galactic is the best space tourism company in the world.$ 100 Stock !!!"
"Folks, It is October end instead of September end. Thats all.."
"SpaceX vs VG. 3 days of zero gravity vs about 3 minutes of micro gravity. A view to see earth sphere vs you are not far enough to see earth curve. A proven spaceship that made it to ISS and back carrying astronauts vs an analog rocket like glider that had issues in every test flight that carried pretend astronaus. Watch Branson sell millions more because he sees the writing on the wall. VG will not be in business for long, except for what they can get by dilution"
Tax the rich.
"When is the flight? I heard Sep 14. If successfull, I expect us go to 40+, and establish a nice permanent support there."
"It is forming a triangle with the intention of breaking to the upside, attention, this may be the good one. I consider that the most negative scenario is already discounted in the price. Any positive news can catapult the action and take it to all-time highs. You just have to be patient. Today is one day less, to fly again."
Here we go 
"from reporting, it looks that UBS's clients were net buyers of more than 3m shares of SPCE for the last week on contrary to what bank says.. interesting"
"as an investor in SPCE, I am a better shock absorber now than few months before."
"Aww, just missed again. Only missed by $74.32. So close....."
SpaceX just eliminated every other space travel company and the wannabe space travel company Virgin Galatic who couldn’t even make it to space and was only in the upper atmosphere for like a minute
"Some of you invest based on news ... And then you lose. An investor when he puts his money in a company for 5 years ... does not live pending the quote, does not live pending news. Here it is not important that a flight is delayed, the important thing is that the flights continue and are successful. Nobody will remember that Virgin was a month late on a flight. It is logical that weak hands get scared. These people are herds and the media moves them however they want. I will keep tomorrow. I'm not going to go out to buy cheaper, or anything. Those who think they are smarter than others, let them do it. The rest of us will continue, because we believe in this successful project. Money in the stock market is earned with patience, not coming and going. Many do not know it, but 98% of people who are dedicated to trading lose. And most are believed to be in the 2% winners. Test your operation. I do not sell"
"Nice volume, change of pattern!!$100 Stock"
short are you ready to lose your money?$100 Stock!!!
Who is waiting for this to touch 75$
SPCE is the next Tesla. $100 stock in 3-4 months !!
Can't wait for the squeeze to take this up to 400$ where it belongs
"The FAA is unimportant.The Italian mission is unimportant.There is only one metric that will decide SPCE (and all current space tourism plays). That is: the SPCE earnings call in November.Until now, space tourism consists of trips with the Russians (20+ million), an auction with Jeff (28 million), and Inspiration 4 (guessed at 30+ million). These aren't businesses yet, just one-off deals. In November SPCE will release for the first time real numbers based on real people's interest in paying for space tourism. If they sell 150 seats (enough to cover operating costs) this company and the others will fail. If they sell 1000+ seats, it's a whole new market and SPCE is at the forefront.That is the only catalyst upcoming, the rest are swing trading indicators..."
"NEW CEO needed, INDEED."
Where do you see this stock in 5-10 years?
"I‘m a luxury market specialist, and I tell you one thing: This is going to be the absolute mega-hype. People will race to be among the first. Others will fake that they are on the list to participate in this exclusive experience. They already bring their cash personally to Branson. It is already starting"
"Soon or later people will realize, this is very low price we have now... so no worries, will go back to 60's"
FAA WILL Have an ANNOUNCEMENT NEXT WEEK. Merger Will Most Likely Happen Be fore 2022.
Hold!!!!
"I want this to just drop to below $24 once more just so I can buy a few hundred more before it starts rising towards $50. Sadly I feel I may have missed out, it looks like it is on a long run upwards now especially if the FAA report comes out and next flight dates are confirmed etc, may just have to bag a load as soon as the market opens today before it goes over $25. I have a feeling this price is going to look so low in 6 months time"
"It's funny how bassists and their media try to scare you. The investor who gets carried away by fear or panic is not a good investor. You should leave the market, because you are not prepared. The FAA will give the authorization, in a few days. Everyone wants the space to develop and private capital is necessary. In the future, governments will be the second to contribute capital. Virgin will exceed three figures. And whoever does not believe it, let him sell and buy another company."
Increased my holdings again today. Just could not pass another opportunity.Happy trading
Google calendar still showing next mission scheduled for October 15.
Will we have a +12% day? Still 29% up to $33! 
So the trend is sell before every flight because after a successful flight the stock follows it’s flight trajectory back to the ground…..
Sam where are you? Please try to cover your 10 shares
"The FAA is doing its job. But he is not going to back down from what he said a few months ago. It is rumored that he will lift the blockade on Virgin and they will be able to start the first commercial mission in history. It has already obtained the license to commercialize flights into space, the first and only one. In a month we will see each other again between 35/40 dollars. And the new fuel to go up ... will be the flight of the Italian Air Force. Virgin is a keep. Let no one get rid of their actions. The vertical rises are coming"

"History repeats itself ... And it will continue to do so ... At the beginning of the year, Virgin was trading at about $ 23 ... In a month and 4 days, it went to $ 62.5 ... No flights ... From Likewise, it went up it went down ... In May, we went to about $ 15 ... The first successful flight occurred and we went to about $ 60 ... In July, Branson went into space ... and When we all expected a new high, we took a cake and went down. The FAA leaked to their friends short investment funds, that a little light had lit up and that they would do an investigation ... When the FAA gave us the authorization to commercialize travel to space, we went 40% higher ... Maybe we will not do that vertical rise, but this month, they authorize us to fly the Italian Air Force ...
