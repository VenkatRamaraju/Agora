IDA is a sleeping bull. Population in Idaho is growing quickly which means more demand for power. I’m speculating that it could be a takeover target soon.
"a great Dividend stock. Bought it the day before ex, got my dividend and the next day it came back in price plus some :D"
Idaho is one of the fastest growing states in that people are actually moving into the state rather than leaving. Add that to the fact that idacorp gets most of their power from hydroelectric which is the famous “Green Energy” and you can see why this company is a great investment. Plus you get a dividend check every 90 days for doing nothing. Sit back and relax.

"I've owned IDA since 1985, put all dividends into the Dividend re-investment program, never have regretted it. I think if they split the stock on a 3 for 1 basis, it would be a positive move."
