"Comerica (NYSE: CMA) reported Q2 EPS of $0.80, $0.59 better than the analyst estimate of $0.21!"
CMA reached a 52 Week high at 89.15
"Solid high dividend bank with alot of upside still, beat earnings and revenue. Last dividend $0.68/share this September."
Beat 1Q 2021 earnings estimates by $1.05. The divvy is solid...I’m in!
"No dividend cut, rock solid balance sheet, plenty of reserves already taken and knocked an economic disaster of a quarter out of the park. This is going to go much higher. Well done CMA, lets go!"
"This stock’s yield, along with many other regional banks, is too juicy for me to ignore. Buying this, FITB, Huntington Bancshares, KeyCorp, and First Horizon on Monday. I’m convinced these stocks will rebound once Coronavirus passes."
"How are you all feeling about this stock? It's been on my watch list, will try to get in on the next dip."

"Whats to story with this stock? Trading well below book value, big dividend, and the company isnt at risk of going under that I can see. Why is this trading so far below its book value?"
What fraction of commercial loans in CMA portfolio are in the oil & gas industry?
"i think that this is not going to be a CMA much longer , that is the rummer on the street"
"Gross profit of 2.38B, sitting on 17.39B cash, debt of only 2.88B. Buying back shares, outstanding shares 133.92M. Down from 139M after recent purchase. Pay out ratio is 35.74% @ .68 cents per share paid quarterly. What am I missing? This stock should be much higher. Just my opinion."
Ouch should have picked up at 32 on Friday but didn’t pull the trigger.
CMA reached a 52 Week high at 86.29
Thinken it is time 4 Divy increase?? Any one else thinken the same?
"Thought we had turned the corner but selling back off 10% for what I assume is market realizing theres no more stimulus. But doesnt change the fact this is way below book value, will maintain its 7% dividend, and still trading at a deep discount. If this falls much more, I will be adding to my position."
"i have e question , what amount is CMA's quorterlly pay out , and when should the share holders get it ? thank you"
