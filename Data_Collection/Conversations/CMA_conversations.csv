"No dividend cut, rock solid balance sheet, plenty of reserves already taken and knocked an economic disaster of a quarter out of the park. This is going to go much higher. Well done CMA, lets go!"
"Thought we had turned the corner but selling back off 10% for what I assume is market realizing theres no more stimulus. But doesnt change the fact this is way below book value, will maintain its 7% dividend, and still trading at a deep discount. If this falls much more, I will be adding to my position."

"IMHO ……. Yesterday's decent dip was the current floor. The upcoming quarterly report isn't expected to be very good, and the bad news is already priced in. At the same time, CMA makes decidedly more that the dividend payment, and that coverage will remain robust. Look for a dividend bump, with the earnings report, in the neighborhood of 8-10% . 2020 ends with CMA at $73 ."
