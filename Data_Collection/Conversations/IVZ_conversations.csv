"You guys need to do your due dilligance. I havent seen 1 person here mention the most important thing. Read the transcript from the last earnings call on April 23rd. In it, they said this:""Then finally and perhaps most importantly, we have no debt maturities until Q4 of 2022""That means they have no debt due until the end of 2022. The pandemic will be over by then. There is no risk of bankruptcy. This is the perfect stock to buy and hold with a 8% dividend. Despite what you will hear on this forum, this company is well run. Right before the pandemic they paid their revolving debt off. They will be well positioned when the pandemic is over. I think $20/share by 2022 is realistic."
"Like usual they will beat expectations.Improvements in assets under management (AUM) and rise in revenues, driven by the OppenheimerFunds buyout.This should be the start of something good."
The hunt for yield is now on and IVZ is one of the greatest investment per Bill Gross in the whole market because they have increased their dividend for the last 10 years . Should get the dividend info by the end of Jan and should go ex dividend around Feb 15. Get your shares why it's still cheap and lock in that 6.77% yield . Plus we have great upside with the trade deal now signed. It just opened up all of China to Invesco. The maker of the QQQ. China is going to be very big upside for IVZ
IVZ goes ex-dividend on NOV 8 up to you what you want to do only pays 7.4% about that's like getting paid what the 10 years pays ever 3 months . Can't do much better and IVZ is still trading under value
added 1256 stocks today will see 30 by end of week
Rough 2 months for IVZ. Hopefully ER will bring this back around.
"Invesco (NYSE:IVZ) jumps 7.8% after Dealreporter speculates in its ""morning flash"" piece that JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) would be a good potential buyer for the asset manager."
"IVZ￼ has treated us all very well. Having said that, I’d love to see them take their success and use it to provide us an increased dividend."
"UBS Upgrades Invesco to Neutral From Sell, Adjusts Price Target to $11 From $8"
"Will it go on like it did today? If yes, I'm still in"
If they divest of everything the sum of the pieces have got to be higher than $7.62 a share. I'm not impressed with management or the performance of their portfolio managers.
"Low debt, 6.5% dividend even after the 50% cut, BV of $21. Incredible value."
"Where will this be in 5 years? $40ish most likely, just my opinion."
"So, people are now selling bonds, treasury yields are going up, so IVZ is going up??"
Buy here or wished you did. Will be over 18 when ex dividend hits in less than 30 days. From here on out this is an undervalued gem that has been overlooked.
"Per Yahoo GBL has twice the earnings of IVZ. Its P.E. is 6 compared to 14. It is up on a down day (12-3-19) and Gabelli Investment bought three million shares in Sept. Yahoo has GBL rated as undervalued. Compare asset managers: AMG, IVZ, GBL and BEN."
"IVZ’s Price to book .5 if you don’t buy it now, you’ll never buy it. It’s on sale in spite of lower AUM."
Bill Gross said IVZ is the best stock to buy in the whole market for long term growth and the dividend for income.
What would be a good buy in price ? Rookie looking for a good dividend stock
"Effective 1/29/20, CFRA has raised its 12-month price target for IVZ to 20, retaining its ""Buy"" opinion."
"37 Billion in assets bled last year (most in the industry), the high priced commissioned based model is done and IVZ has the 6th highest expense ratio in the country for active managers. Terrible service model and the International Investments are not performing now. This company needs to fire the management team!"
• Invesco (NYSE:IVZ): Q1 Non-GAAP EPS of $0.56 beats by $0.03; GAAP EPS of $0.44.• Revenue of $887.1M (-7.4% Y/Y) beats by $2.17M.
"going down daily , options end on friday 4 pm , Guys who bought puts need the stock below $10 if they choose that strike price on friday. those who bought calls need it above $10 on friday ."
"8% ,of IVZ is owned by small shareholders the rest, insiders, banks, funds, institutions..dont give in and sell your shares"
"we have reached the end of time. Tomorrow if the market is not red to start off the day , my guess is over $15 , with stimulus over $16. GLTA"
Brutal couple of days here for IVZ. OUCH. Anyone averaging down or just riding the red wave?
"Assuming the new dividend is sustainable this is a nice floor, 8.5% yield. It is also at an attractive price for a takeover. Would make a nice addition for a better run brokerage company. Or perhaps a hedge fund."
i got 5000 shares
Apparently some management shakeups being reported. Back under $20. They need a lot more management shakeups.
Dave insiders generally buy for one reason! You have one guess!
EARNINGS. When ivz was down 50% they cut the div in half which should work for ivz investors as the co. is saving .15 cents a share. This should give the earnings a boost.
price target on this stock is 26 for the year and march onwards the market has recovered so next quarter should be good in 3 monthe
Better go over $30 tomorrow
The next dividend will be the regular amount after that to preserve capital it will be 15.5 cents a share.
IVZ goes ex-dividend on Nov 8 only 2 weeks away. That over 7% at the price the stock is trading at for the year WOW and the 10 year is at what 1.77% WOW
I am in today. Bought LOAN yesterday and in my ROTH. Tired of dealing with pot stocks
"Barrons is a ""quite reliable"" source for stocks. I think their projection for a 20% gain this year (2018) in IVZ stock about right according to my own analysis of the income statement and balance sheet."
Why isn’t this popping on the merger news?
"We recieved a 10% dividend increase, now at .17c a share"
WOW now that's is something IVZ Quarter dividend pays you 1.82% at todays closing price on your money WOW and over 7.32% for the years WOW The 10 years only pays 1.77% for the whole year . Just holding IVZ and getting the dividend you will get 4 times the 10 year. Amazing . If you invest in IVZ the dividend will double your money in about 9.8 years just from the dividend plus you have upside in the stock price. because it is still trading under value. If you invest in the 10 year your money will double in about 40 year. Very safe but not real smart long term
Just wondering what this company would be worth if bought and then sold off the parts. Probably worth more sold in pieces.
What is the problem with ivz?
"I'm not a smart man, all I know is that IVZ has some of the most popular ETFs. I know they charge an expense ration to operate those ETFs. I see they have an okay balance sheet and pay a hefty dividend (one of the best in the S&P). I will admit I don't know any more about the company then that. If they can make a nice profit from operating those ETFs and continue to pay the dividend this will be an amazing, once in a lifetime investment opportunity because ETFs are not going anywhere. I am not going all in on this one, but I get a sinking sensation that I should. Just not sure if I am missing something."
I sold this Tuesday at a pretty respectable loss but I just couldn't see any positive move and time soon. I bought TKC and basically got my money back in two days.
"https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/smart-beta-etfs-position-invesco-to-help-you-any-market/Global investment management firm Invesco has come a long way since pioneering the first smart beta ETF.Through organic growth, nimble acquisitions and smart beta ETFs, Atlanta-based Invesco (IVZ) reached $1.2 trillion in assets under management, of which $273 billion is in ETFs. It is the fourth-largest ETF provider globally. Invesco offers more than 400 funds across multiple asset classes and investment styles."
we need higher dividend
"This should be a very bullish week for the market. Not so much about the underlying value of the market, but the animal psychology of Americans. For one, many things are opening up, and the people are fed up and are going to vote out democratic governors that keep this economy clamped down. And secondly, the rocket launch that will happen tomorrow will spur American optimism and a feeling of American can do. Top that off with good weather, and things are looking bright."
Billionaire Bill Gross select this Stock as his top pick on CNBC last Friday..
"just bought some more ,, down for no reason ...tks"
ivz earnings are estimated about the 3rd week of July. June AUM should be out any day now.
Big short squeeze today. How many are shorting IVZ? The more shorts the higher this will go. Capitulation all the bears will start buying stocks over the next few weeks. I am holding no reason to sell now.
they beat estimates
If you sold calls on IVZ you might want to check and make sure you still have your shares . I have been taking shares to get the dividend next week
Is this going to 5? Any thoughts?
"My main concern with IVZ is this quote from Value Line in their February 7th report on this equity:“We are cautiously optimistic about a partial earnings recovery in 2020. Indeed, we look for share-net to reach $2.60. This is based on the ramp up of cost savings, consisting of IT improvements and product rationalization benefits, and as restructuring cost abate. While a healthy backlog of new institutional wins in the real estate space is a positive, ongoing outflows and the mix shift to lower-fee passive products are concerns.”Not a particularly rousing endorsement; lacks inspiration. Plus some of that wording like “product rationalization benefits” are just too slippery.Also Expecting 2020 earnings to more than double from 2019’s showing - based mainly on cost savings rather than organically grown profit might be a real reach for some investors."
Any thoughts on tomorrow
"Go through comments and times I’ve posted. I haven’t missed a beat, called everything. I believe it will finish 7.20-7.30. But even now, this is a good buy point. Expecting a rise & sit around 8 flat next week."
"Forgot to mention @R, Dow futures indicate +277 right now. AT&T should really fly with all the upgrades and price increase from 28 to nearly 39. Come to the T board and chat.We love you there mate!"
"WOW!!! At this price another investment firm like BLK, TROW, SCWB, should just buy them. Shareholders would likely take $25 and be happy (20% premium)."
What do you think are the chances that IVZ is acquired by another firm?
"buy buy buy,panic... investors took out 10b in fear. Time for us sharks to feed."
"Lowest price in 23 years, and still a decent profit with this terrible economy. I'm in. Next quarter will be the real test though"
Anyone know how much we would pay for State Street Asset Management Business?
"Manipulation at its best. Every 4 weeks when options are set to expire...this gets walked down. Guess it creates a buying opportunity, but sure wish they would clean up (and enforce) the rules surrounding this."
"Here is the reason IVZ is down from $40 to $15 see if you can spot which firm on the list has the shares and power to control the movement of the stock , It is very easy to see which firm it is and to prove it all the SEC would have to do is look at the fake sell orders that will not filled and the inter firm stock transfers. Very easy to see and the funny things is they use your retirement funds to do it so they can make money shorting stocks. LOLhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IVZ/holders?p=IVZhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IVZ/holders?p=IVZ"
Massmutual owns approximately 20% of the common shares outstanding of Invesco. They also own $ 4 billion of preferred shares which may be convertible into common.Their cost basis for their shares of Invesco relating to Oppenheimer funds is approximately $ 150 million.They would receive at least $ 7 Billion...they would be crazy to take cash.There will probably be no cash component since even long term they would take a massive hit.Now wouldn't you like to have had an insurance policy with Massmutual!?
20+% loss since May!! Not worth the time or money at this point.
Why big rise today?
Improving economy should have IVZ continuing its upward trajectory
"This stock is strictly tied to the DOW, DOW up stock up DOW down stock down, very complicated formula. No concern here, be patient and you will be rewarded. Draw a decent return with dividends while you wait."
I can't think of any other reasons not to invest at this level. I am sorry I do not have idle money to put into this.
Big money managers needed it below 17 to have the options worth anything. this is just an options expiration day pulling this down.
Lowest price ever even during 2008 financial crisis. Dang right CEO and board should take pay cut. However is probably a good time to buy. Even though div cut 7.5% div still looks pretty good in today’s environment.
Getting more here
Good earnings report. i buy quality stocks like this to diversify between my gambling addiction #BB
Any down day with IVZ is institutional investors or hedge funds trying to steal your stock. Only 8% of this company is owned by small investors.
BlackRock exceeded expectations. Was that at the expense of IVZ? Or will the entire industry rally?
"this must be tax loss selling or something keeping this stock down...hopefully they finish soon. otherwise, this makes littlr6 sense to be below 19-20 per share."
Looks like Wall Street has set IVZ up to miss earnings and for sure the revenue They raised the Revenue whisper up like 31% higher about 300-400 million more they have ever made. LOL now that is what you call a real CON job . Here is the Whisper numberhttps://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/ivz
Invesco is up 6.47% to 18.59
"ATLANTA, Aug. 11, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Invesco Ltd. (NYSE: IVZ) today reported preliminary month-end assets under management (AUM) of $1,195.3 billion, an increase of 4.4% versus previous month-end. The firm achieved total net inflows of $5.1 billion this month. Overall net long-term inflows were $4.0 billion driven by net long-term inflows in the institutional channel of $5.9 billion from all regions and asset classes during the month, reflecting the global and diversified nature of our pipeline."
i think this will close at 8.40 today
With earnings this has been on our watchlist for potential day trades. Good luck to everyone out there. See what else is on our watchlist. https://daytrading.group/DayTradingAlerts
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
WTH Yahoo (Verizon) ? IVZ summary page states annual div/sh as $1.68 ($.42/sh/qtr) for 5.10% yield but historcial data shows $.29/sh/qtr for 3.57 yield.I made a buy decision based on $1.68.Thanks a pant load !
"Please read article ""investment chief Martin Flanagan faces toughest test of 15 year reign. Highlights show his 10 percent pay raise, 11.5 million of bonuses, plus 77,00 toward use of private Jet, despite 24 year of stock. Note, this was prior to the problems of the virus. The dividend by shareholders is being reduced by over 50% but Mr. Flanagan doesn't show at least a little bit of integrity and not accept this raise or even better, take a pay cut. The members of the BOD'S should be ashamed of this. Why don't they cut their salary as performance has been DISMAL."
"Earnings report looks strong to me, nice beat, wonder what it would have to have been to be up instead of down today."
CEO bought 3 Mil. Worth of stock a month ago! Barron’s speculated in Aug. 30 article that possibly IVZ along with a couple other companies were potential targets for purchase by larger companies. Any thoughts by anyone on upcoming earnings?
$0.29/quarter.Stock is a screaming buy at $30.
I heard about IVZ the other day on (http://newlife-stockalerts.tech). It’s looking like an interesting play.
this thing did very little on yesterday's up day and now on one down day it's up doesn't make sense
"I love IVZ, I think we bust thru the stops at $14.00..&go higher, plan to sell right before elections. A dem win -market down 1000"
the earnings news certainly was not good and we took the hit for it. But now we know where ivz stands and it looks like we are going to do well in the future.
"Amazing thrust upwards in very little time. If course its the markets mostly. Can we go much higher in the short term ... I am talking about the markets in general , with things generally in bad shape and rebuilding just starting and having almost reached the highs before the covid its hard to see how. STILL i WILL ASK THE QUESTION WILL BE SEE $11 THIS WEEK ? IVZ was really way undervalued to level that was nuts. It still is !"
"Headed for another 52 week low, it appears"
This stock has been hit hard options week each of the last 5 months. So predictable. Someone big must have a lot of $10 options expiring each month. I've used it as a monthly buying opportunity. I'm long here so will take the shorties games as an opportunity.
Earnings beat and down 5%? What was the expectation?!?
Donna what was price target on downgrade by Citi?
I have held the stock for a couple of years. I thought it was reasonably priced in the mid to high 30s. Are there any ideas why this company would decline 50% in the last year. The PE ratio is still only 10
Sell?
time for new management or a shake up
Another 6% jump on this today and still no chatter. I never intended it...but this has become my largest overall position after loading up in the $8s a few months back. All smiles here.
"the Ex-Dividend Date is 11/8/19, when will it be posted to account? thanks."
Any thoughts on if this move is due to activist taking a stake in IVZ? Thoughts?
"At IVZ current prices, the company can buyback 12% of the company and still pay almost a 6% dividend. What is the board and management doing for shareholders????"
Good buy right now?
Resistance wall coming at 7.7
I called this 27 days when I said investco will buy someone or someone will buy them. I see a move being made.
"Someone school me on calls options here if you would. Looking at the April 17th call. $16 calls are $2.30, $17 calls are $1.45, and $18 calls are $.80. Looking at the volume, there were a number of hits on the 18s, but not much on the 16 or 17s. When I look at it, buying the $16 would buy to cover at $18.30, buying the $17 would close at $18.45 and the $18 would close at 18.80....why would one buy the $18 over the $16 call?"
When they miss earnings like they did last year how low can IVZ go ? Do you think it will drop below $14? Where will the bottom be if they miss again?
March 2-Sept 2 2020 (6 months) this stock goes from $14.78 to $10.20 losing $4.58/share. That's 31%. But look at the bright side.........you collected 2 dividend payments worth $0.31 so really your loss was only $4.27/share or 29%. Gotta love those dividends.......right?

If you can't hold an ""investment thesis"" for more than 8 days......your research can't be TRUSTED! I'll stick with Barrons.....thank you very much."
Looks like earnings which I'm told will be April 24th might be decent as the action of IVZ wants to get up to 52 week high
increase of dividend probably next quoter. I guess $0.2 per quoter. overall good job
"As long as the dividend is around 4% I think this is still a buy. With interest rates near zero and staying there for probably the next couple of years, a 4% dividend looks good."
"I own this at $16 and like the rest of my life savings, it's toast.I hope to god this economy recovers. They have a sizeable portfolio of assets under management. Some day people will invest again?"
Let’s go! New high
"This supertanker has turned the corner. Consensus Estimate for the 4th quarter earnings has risen 3% over the last 60 days. Invesco has a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 6.70, compared with 13.60 for the industry. The company possesses a Value Score of A."

"Dang....good show today; now sitting at the bottom of the Big Red breakdown candle on 7-29-2019--yeah, that long ago :)---- grinding up to that $20.90 area"

Any stories out there today that would cause the decline today? Profit taking?
"Invesco's ""Roadmap to Recovery"" presentation online event is today, Wednesday 20th at 4pm ET. The link is on their site. This company is primed for a strong bounce back."
"I do not think this is a big problem. Huge volume but low margin.

It's you ,me and Buffett still buying stocks."
New position here at $7.62. I think it's a nice spot to be at.
Loading up at 7.6!!! It will recover at least to $8 by June before the dividend and after the dividend!
"LOL I did not know IVZ was a cruse ship or an airline it's trading like it is LOL,LOL"
Invesco is down 4.91% to 27.13
Invesco is down 4.91% to 23.84
I have 20k worth of this stock with an average of 7.57 so this is rather painful to watch.
We just have to stay patient.
Back on July 30 Citigroup cut the IVZ price target from $5.00 to $4.50. That was quite the prognostication!
incredible volume to...
"Now that I have done my research, a day late and several hundred thousand dollars later, I see why IVZ has been crashing..1. Tender option bond trusts that were highly leveraged and too difficult for anyone to grasp who is an average investor..they had what amounts to margin calls. It was reported 3/23 and I didn't know what was going on so I missed out on that BAD NEWS.2. IVZ had some closed end funds that tanked too ...no more detail but 20-30% probably leveraged and margin calls....3. AUM down 5% in a month. That's bad for one month.Anyway, at under $8 and a cost basis of $16 and depression and anxiety and fear, I guess I just hold and watch this pathetic investment go to $5 or zero. I don't know . I have a call and two emails into Investor Relations.So, the companies have ""no comment"" on this BS leveraged option trust that shouldn't be allowed. I cannot wait to find out what IR says to me on that one. These people criminals for taking money and playing with it like this. I wanted a dividend but not a bloodbath .Sorry for the rant. I also own all the other #$%$ that severely tanked so now I am sitting on 70% losses and no retirement money. Don't bother with your mean comments. I work very hard to stay afloat and this has been crushing. BEN hasn't done much better but I don't own a ton of that one.This virus has not only cost real lives, but it has destroyed people's securities in retirement that will NEVER COME BACK."
I miss when this stock was a dividend play.
"Folks, if the stock falls lower to 6 or less on a dip no reason to panic. If you are not on margin then nibble on the way down. I bought 8 grand in upper 8s, 2 more at 7.40 and ready to buy a boatload around 6. My plan was to buy 20K shares at around $175k total. Now, I can get the same for under $140K. Still same dividend!"
"State Street has a page-long list of subsidiaries, which were once companies like IVZ. Does anybody know how those acquisitions were carried out? What did share-holders receive? Cash, shares in STT, some of each? The word merger has been used, but it won't be a merger, given the 4X size difference. Any thoughts on what we will have after the deal is done?"
50% of the float shores. They are betting that a company with a trillion in assets under management will go to zero. How funny is that.
"My financial advisor thought I was being risky to buy IVZ at $7.43. I thought I was being a prudent investor, buying low on a company like Invesco. Did the same thing with RQI. Bought at $8.63. Did the same thing with AMLP. Bought at $21.48. Did the same thing with LUV at $31.58. It isn't risky to buy quality at discounted prices. I think it is just smart investing. Nine plus points is nice today. Looking for IVZ to go back towards to mid to upper teens. The takeover of Oppenheimer caused this buying opportunity. Take advantage of it,or not, Its up to you."
Price is approaching financial crisis 2009 low... I'll buy there
Glad I bought yesterday!
"According to yahoo a forward PE a little over 6 with a nice dividend! Good earnings from GS, BLK, & MS! Why isn’t IVZ soaring ? Thoughts?"
With the fed saying interest rates will be near zero for the next 2 years this stock should do well with still a 5% dividend. A lot of funds lost money during the pandemic they will have to catch up to meet their goals. I think this stock is still a good buy at these levels where else are you going to get a 5% return just from the dividend?
CNBC reports possible merger with State Street
when you buy more it keeps dropping
Bought at 7.65 and set a sell limit order at 8.89. Hoping to swing trade within a week. I don’t see holding this long-term. Thoughts welcomed.
Just an FYI. My investment company is writting a letter to the board asking for action regarding stock price performance. Asking for immediate return to share buyback etc. Will keep you posted.
This company has over a trillion dollars in AUM. What am I missing...7 dollar stock?
9$ is still elusive but its coming ...good dividend at the current price and surely Assets Under Management is start to grow with the market up about 35% from the mar. 23 rd. low. Those who fled at the darkest moment will have a long ride to break even . Besides the market where can you earn money that will even keep pace with inflation.
".35 cents ,Rev 1.03 billion"
Insiders appear to be holding tight. I think they are looking forward to a much higher stock price.
They make like >$500mm net income and the market cap is 3B. 6 years of earnings and you can buy this company out. Market has been unfair.
I believe that professional in financially run IVZ. I can say that those management just wasting my money based on stock price. what would you say?
"The problem with IVZ is it has almost $ 7.5 billion of goodwill and additional $ 4 billion of debt. SO you have to add $ 11.5 billion to existing market cap of $ 7 billion. Which it pretty high around $ 18.5 billion, they are further going to raise more debt for Oppenheimer acquisition. This market will beat you if you have debt and are looking for more. Add to that, financials as a sector are not looking good. Invesco did biggest mistakes on acquisition which is why it is so badly down"
anyone have an idea why this has dropped so much besides the virus scare? it was $18 Feb 20th and has plunged 25.5% while the Dow is down about 10% during the same period
"The Intelliflo acquisition is a VERY good move for Invesco. Also note that Invesco's stock buyback program will be re-initiated by the end of the year. For a stock trading near it's 52 week low, with a 4+% dividend yield and now a new source of growth........this is a great entry point. Mid $30's by year end."
Oversold - time to buy the blood on the streets.
consensus for oct. 27th earnings is 0.44 cents a share .... if so that would be a nice lift up from .0.35
Stock not moving figured would jump more on news
"The only positive I see is they didn’t cut the dividend again, at least not yet. I’ll take my 6% and wait 3 months for a better earnings report. I still firmly believe this stock is fine for the long term."
"Regardless of earnings, IVZ is a solid company and will bounce today, shorts will recover. We may see 7.20 before closing but will bounce back up. It is battered too low and I will keep buying. Last purchase 5k shares at 7.25."
In about 15 days or less ivz will post their AUM numbers for may. Market has been good so their numbers will be good.
"Q2 earnings scheduled to be be released July 23. Consensus $0.42, with a range of $0.32 to $0.53. Q2 of last year was $0.65. A lot of talk about the June 30th AUM - when you take out the market rise and foreign exchange then Invesco actually had a net outflow. My thoughts are the Invesco portfolio managers have been routinely underperforming their counterparts at other investment houses."
Buy volume last two minutes about million shares bought after announcing monthly pay outs on units of invesco funds. 
Is this a buy below 20??

Why is this going down so much? Does someone know something I do not.
"Here we go again ! AUM IN ABOUT 10 DAYS. Patience is an investing tool, one of the most important ones. As long as a div is coming in we are getting paid to wait."
did you get your dividend today?
"Sold for a nice 8% gain. Not bad for a 1 day trade. I do like this company though, I wouldn't hesitate to eventually buy and hold longer term when I'm ready for that. I actually spent half a day researching these guys and it is a pretty solid company"
"The stock keeps going up, almost like a big investor is accumulating shares. In a zero interest environment owning a stock with a big dividend is going to be very attractive. IVZ should outperform over long term. The lower interest rates go the more demand from large investors."
"Invesco (NYSE:IVZ) declares $0.31/share quarterly dividend, 3.3% increase from prior dividend of $0.30.• Forward yield 5.76%• Payable June 3; for shareholders of record May 10; ex-div May 9."
"IVZ you want to sell out of the money puts so you can pick up shares cheaper or you make big money by racking in the put money. Take like the Jan 2021 $13 strike put if you sell for a $1 and it gets put to you the dividend pay out would about 10% and if it does not you rake in the put money and that's 7.7% on your money either way it's a win ,win, for any year. LOL, LOL Love making money"
"If they beat earnings IVZ will be a screamer higher , If they miss I guess we will need to go have a talk will Bill LOL"
any faith in this stock? i bought for a steady div. all ive gotten so far is a steady drop.
Why has IVZ been tanking over the past few months?
"Be patient, this is a case of the Specialist accumulating shares, he was (caught)short last big rise, once he has his(greedy) fill, this goes higher..reason ?1. great earnings this quarter, even better then whisper # 2. possibility of divided raiseI see $25 in near future"
this is a good stock. buy and hold
Invesco is up 5.10% to 28.42
ivz there can only be one ! https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-qqq-reaches-100-billion-123000949.html
why is this going down
"LOL now it makes sense , now I know why IVZ has dropped so much. Same group involved in most of the stock manipulation and if they want it to go lower it goes lower and for sure it will not go higher until they want it to go higher."
I was talking to an a advisor and he said it could be a buy out by State Street Corp. at 20% above yesterdays closing price which would put it over $30 a share. This will be interesting.
"To get some real upward movement we need some positive news, first AUM , then in Aug. an improved earnings report. If the market slowly keeps going up that will keep us afloat until then."

"A look at ivz trading lately The losers always think there is a plot ...whenever their stock goes down , its the shorts its the position of the moon , Trump and other indicators .Last week IVZ drops to 9.77 at the close friday its up a buck from that point to 10.78... so by crushing the stock they are now up a buck , soon we will see the AUM # for july , if its a real winner even I will think there is a plot afoot."
Strong start for IVZ today. Usually on the date (today for IVZ) a stock goes ex-divvy the price is reduced by the dividend amount. Not so so today. In fact it gapped up from yesterday’s close. A very bullish sign. Congrats to all who bought yesterday or before and thus captured the divvy.
"$IVZ https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invesco-ivz-earnings-expected-grow-173105585.htmlThis investment management company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.69 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +56.8%.Revenues are expected to be $1.75 billion, up 39% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.17% higher over the last 30 days to the current level."
The last time the stock was this price the dividend was twice what it is now. Its time for a raise. We get out dividend on Dec 02 .
"I have followed this stock for over a year and half and yes it has underperformed and disappointed me. I bought with the lure of high div, low P.E, share buy back program, and a good balance sheet. I Started buying in the low 20s and sold off several times to play other more popular. I did well with the others and always stubbornly held some IVZ hoping to recoup and maybe even make using the div. Recently After doing well with the others and decided to liquidate, that didn’t last long as I wanted my money to work so I went back in big with what I felt safe, brkb and ivz at $16 ( ivz seemed to be making the right moves to increase value). Pandemic hits and both get creamed. I dollar cost averaged Ivz at 13 and 9. When it hit 7.80 I was depressed and impulsively sold all my brkb and went all in on ivz. I didn’t feel good making a move like that so I kept searching for information to try to make me feel better. All new reports scared me even worse, then I went into the fidelity research Link on them and I was immediately put at ease. I had read it before and was probably why I stayed so stubborn. Compared to their peers, they are strong, especially in the financial strength category ( they have the better Balance sheet than most). I realized they will stay alive and if they can hold a good dividend, my dividend income alone will break me even in the not so far future. I also realize if the ever come back to 13 I’ll make good money, but I may never sell if they can keep good dividends. It will bea steady income stream.It made me do what a I am supposed to do from the beginning, buy a god stock and hold for the long term. I know some of you aren’t fortunate enough to have dollar cost down like me but I’m confident this stock should come back to 16 and hopefully more over a 2-3 year outlook. In the mean time let’s pray they can hold their dividend strong. I wondered why Legg Masons stock price stayed so strong and the reason is the have much less outstanding and they performed better of course. If there are equal amount of shares outstanding, ivz would be at a similar price. I"

"There was institutional buying in the last 10 minutes. Over 1.2 million shares but the price only moved up a couple of cents. The trend is pointing down though. I am looking for another entry below $6.50 fairly soon. All of this aside, Invesco is one of a few stocks left (other than LPs) which pays safe dividend above 8%. The majority including airlines, cruise, or oil companies will either cut it or have already eliminated it altogether. Only a handful are still standing."
"Grabbed some cheapies on Friday.Great dividend and a big Global Equity with great re,profits and a great balance sheet with billions of cash at all time lows.Institutions have been quietly loading up lately added hundreds and thousands of shares of Invesco.Investco has huge ETFs on the markets.Investco is a value house of the markets.Zero worries.Investco just aquired Oppenheimer of Boston.Now assets under management is 1.2 trillion dollars maybe less now because of the markets have dropped because of the Coronavirus.Of course it's a bad virus and I don't want it,but we know that the markets,media,governments love to take an opportunity to crash everything so they can buy everything on the cheap."
Invesco is a Value house. When the market rotates to value this position should recover. Until then I’ll collect the dividend. Is my two cents worth of opinion worth anything?
"strong buying today , looks like in the next 2 weeks we will close over. $9 . Paying a dividend over 7% presently and big potential we just need patience while we collect the dividend."
In a few days when everyone figures out they cut the dividend & they likely report poor earnings and withdraw guidance I should have my double digit yield back!!!
Will there be a buyout?
"I too have been waiting, hesitant to buy back the call shares I optioned out of @ $18.85 last month.IVZ decent to new 52 week lows has been puzzling. However there may be some concerns in the market that it may have to cut its divvy as it may seem that earlier projections for a higher EPS to cover it better might not pan out."
Unless there's a market-wide crash starting tomorrow this is gonna rebound
WOW....I got out of this stock at $25/share and took a big loss. Thought I was maybe selling at the bottom. Never thought I'd see it with a $16 handle. BRUTAL
I sold this at $25.50 a share 2 years ago when everyone started going to ZERO commissions for on-line trading. I saw the low of $15 coming. Not sure if it will EVER get back to the $40's like in 2016.
Can't wait to buy some more tomorrow if the price stays around here.
probably won't happen but would be great if ivz reiterates their dividend is in tact
+9% so far today. Anyone know why?
"Will they be increasing their dividend to pre covid levels soon. I hope they do, it would definately be positive for stock price."
Consensus estimate is aRound 41 cents. That would be 10 cents above last quarter. Investors are cautious with this stock and it needs consistent performance over several quarters and earnings need to return to 50-60 cent range before we see pre pandemic stock price. Hopefully we get over 40 cents and they raise the dividend to 20 cents or above. That could get us to 13I’m sticking with IVZ as long as they Move forward and continually raise dividend. Otherwise I’m leaving to a more stable dividend like AT&T or even Wells Fargo if they can gain government confidence and lift restrictions
"So, I am thinking about adding some here. But, given all the interest rate cuts by the fed, trying to determine how they affect IVZ and their complex array of investments. Any thoughts?"
IVZ goes ex dividend on May 8 2020 and pays you 15.5 cents per share that is about 8% at todays price. They have already cut the dividend and should be safe now
IVZ is now at $22-$23 price range which calculates out to a PE of around 8. This is a time for value purchasers to buy as the historical PE average for this equity is 16. This is the biggest divergence of the equities I follow. It has an “A” rating from Valueline and a divvy in excess of 5%. Morningstar has given it its highest rating of 5 stars. I’m in it now at $26 and will be averaging down. I like the fact that I’ll collect some divvy while I wait for the negative sector sentiment to dissipate.Good luck to all.
This stock is godly undervalued
In a weak market IVZ appears to have a firming SP! If the market starts rising I am hoping we shall see a strong rise !
"If it opens here at $7.53 I'll be even, hope it climbs some more today!"
Earnings miss on Jan 29th has been priced in. The exdiv drop also has happened. It should go up from today. Buy today if you can.
very good earnings release. .35/share profit. dividend is .15/share so they should be able to easily pay dividend going forward. Considering that half the population is unemployed and this is the worst recession since the great depression the fact that the company can post a profit is very impressive. This isn't a growth stock. If you expect this to jump like Google or Tesla you bought the wrong stock. I care more about the long term than this quarter.
"Yes, Scott, it was a little ugly, closing at $18.58. Whoever executed my February 21 $18 calls last night and paid me $.85 just to get the divvy had a small loss if they did not flip it early in the day when IVZ hit $19 briefly.I like this stock and will add some more back to my holdings if it follows the retracement pattern the charts and technicals seem to indicate. It’s recent ER missed by $.02 so there is good reason to expect at least a small dip - small I say because of the large well covered divvy and a valuation well below it’s historical average PE ratio."
What brought this stock down?
"I bought this well under $10, and it has become about 11% of my portfolio with it being my biggest holding now by far, especially now that APPL is well off its highs. The experts say I should trim some, but hard to sell this as it continues to make me happy. Bout this and BAC late spring/early summer. Financials are now 32% of my holdings. My portfolio is outta wack but hard to drop the winners. Decisions decisions."
New to this stock. Considering buying. Anyone willing to share truth?
This should be trading at around $35/share
"Did someboday notice that Invesco invested in Jinkosolar for few weeks.source:https://fintel.io/so/us/jks/invesco Invesco Ltd. ownership in JKS / JinkoSolar Holdings Co., Ltd.2021-02-16 - Invesco Ltd. has filed an SC 13G form with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosing ownership of 10,785,500 shares of JinkoSolar Holdings Co., Ltd. (US:JKS). This represents 6.0 percent ownership of the company.---I am heavily invested in Jinko personally and it dropped like stone because as every stocks in Nasdaq. I think it is strong sign when Invesco invested these amount of money in a company? What you think?"
"Alright let’s gap up. Looking at a possible fluctuation shift today. Hopefully be able to see more of which way we’re going to go today about 20 minutes in, with supports."
Could reverse around 15 to 12 $.????
"Sharing my analysis of this stock tomorrow, through the comments again. Be on @ 9 sharp."
This will close at around 15
Ceo bought 245k stock.
Buy. The cut dividend is still over 7.4%. It’s been cut and is now much safer. A safer dividend that is higher? Others will cut theirs too. Some to zero. The stock market will recover.
Here was your chance to get shares on the cheap before earnings on Wed before we jump up over $2 on the big run higher . We get just a normal PE and the stock will more than double.
"Done well with IVZ, but I think company owes us further div increases !"
Tax lossSwapped out of IVZ and into JHGJHG has no debt while IVZ has massive debt.Both have similar yield
Unfortunately I believe my comments are being reported and are not staying on this platform.
"Share price is $21.62 vs future cash flow value of $35.69Invesco's share price is below the future cash flow value, and at a moderate discount (> 20%).Invesco's share price is below the future cash flow value, but not at a substantial discount (< 40%)."
i own 10k stock and i am very sure that this is a great buy. Before corona it was 17$ that means it will go up double. Which other stock gives you 2 times your investment in few months once this period is over & dividend? i spent a lot of time researching before investing my hard earned $. Trust me its the best buy during this season. Buy and Hold. Opportunities like these come rarely. People had bought this stock for 20 dollars last year just for the dividends. Why not buy now for the lowest price in years and get price hike & dividends in future!
Deutsche Bank raises IVZ Price Target from $17 to $20. Sure would be nice if IVZ restores the dividend to pre COVID levels of $0.31 per share per quarter.
"If the covid starts easing in the near future and ivz in Aug. repeats with great AUM numbers this may be the last chance to buy shares @ $10, just my opinion."
"Resistance being hit, small support, then expected drop coming."
why is this stock up so much?
"AUM for Sept. should show up this week , market was good in Sept. Janus stock is moving up a lot faster that is IVZ both companies I believe need the merger which is amusing ad value investing is just starting to come back. I think when ivz gets past $14 it's game on."
"Hey “R”...if you owned AT&T, you’d have a solid div today. We love your posts on T board and look forward to more of your wisdom!!"
