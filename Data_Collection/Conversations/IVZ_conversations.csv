"Done well with IVZ, but I think company owes us further div increases !"
I don't think State Street will be the buyer of IVZ...I think Janus board controlled Trian will buy out IVZ...PETLZ had disclosed of his intentions
Better go over $30 tomorrow
I said months ago they would make a move. I am out. Whatever happens they will have too much debt which means no dividend increase. They would have been better off buying a small company
When is the deal Going down?
I was talking to an a advisor and he said it could be a buy out by State Street Corp. at 20% above yesterdays closing price which would put it over $30 a share. This will be interesting.
Why isn’t this popping on the merger news?
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Pick-stocks.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
"State Street has a page-long list of subsidiaries, which were once companies like IVZ. Does anybody know how those acquisitions were carried out? What did share-holders receive? Cash, shares in STT, some of each? The word merger has been used, but it won't be a merger, given the 4X size difference. Any thoughts on what we will have after the deal is done?"
CNBC reports possible merger with State Street
"Hmmm. With State Street spiking today, you’d think that IVZ would follow it up."
Here’s an article about an Invesco and state street merger dated 2 months ago. He says that state street is wanting to sell its assets. https://www.etfstream.com/features/invesco-and-state-street-merger-would-create-big-four-european-etf-issuers/
I read that state street hired Goldman to evaluate possible options for its assets in December. And they nearly closed a deal with UBS for a new company spinoff. They even had the executive structure done before the deal collapsed.
Short squeeze tomorrow
Anyone know how much we would pay for State Street Asset Management Business?
I think the deal may be done soon IVZ acquired by STT
Well that bump was short lived.
I may be jumping the gun here but is it possible State Street already owns IVZ and is preparing to announce maybe in November.... just a thought.
Massmutual owns approximately 20% of the common shares outstanding of Invesco. They also own $ 4 billion of preferred shares which may be convertible into common.Their cost basis for their shares of Invesco relating to Oppenheimer funds is approximately $ 150 million.They would receive at least $ 7 Billion...they would be crazy to take cash.There will probably be no cash component since even long term they would take a massive hit.Now wouldn't you like to have had an insurance policy with Massmutual!?
Stock not moving figured would jump more on news
