This stock will be trading around 8-9 by summer
Should see a decent bounce today
If you do the math....the buyout price minus debt divided by number of shares you get $20.05. Anything above that is short covering. Sell at $22.
Probably will be down at least 5% tomorrow
"Will stop and have a beer now .. at 11 AM. Have not done that in 10 years but this is my largest holding/options bet, so indulge me. Congratulations to all longs!!"
Actual deal will be transacted at 4.8 billion dollars.
Why is it taking so long to announce a new CEO?
Are we all bears for this stock? LMAOOO :D
Why is WBT changing CEOs and CFOs so often since their spin-off from Manitowoc?This stock has had minimal upward traction in terms of share price since the spin.My patience is wearing thin . . .
They had some interesting insights about WBT on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Why didn't PriceWaterhouseCoopers catch these errors? PwC needs to bring in some international tax experts - not the B team.
Big players took their profit yesterday and retail investors who bought it late will loose more money if not selling yet
"My opinion, my guess at close, 21.56"
Thanks for the info Kimo will be watching closely and probably sell this week sometime
"It look like an institutional ? sell 226,253 shares at 21.74 16:58:35 ET PM in level 2"
"$3.3B Bid, any price higher than this will make it overvalued!"
"What is going on with this stock (WBT)? They are being investigated, yet it is going up. Investors don't read or care about the news, or simply they have money to throw away!!!!"
100 million volume today..10 million or less volume by tomorrow..I bet this stock will be down 5% or more tomorrow.No doubt about it.
reason for miss-tariffs. Thanks Trump.
"Absolutely the wrong decision! There is no upside potential by accepting Ali Group's bid. With Middleby's offer, you had the potential for significant share price growth. At the end of the day what do we get? Just another short-sighted money grab by WBT's board."
ALTO-and SELB =$$$$$
"Overbought. The acquisition price is $2.9B, current market cap is $3.2B. It's bound to shed about 10%"
WBT will have another offer of 25.00 and they will take it....!!!! Buy Buy Buy WBT Europe wants that market and will get it from the WBT share holders...!!!Buy
up down up down... confusing!
holding 8k shares I filed for suit.
"What goes up, must come down!! Profit taking and shorts"

Fair share price is $20.69
I’m talking about all the lawsuits what do they know that we dont
It will be better in most cases if you take the stock instead of the cash since it won't be taxable immediately.
"Trading higher than the all cash bid, investors thinking a sweetened bid to clinch the deal? Or a bidding war?"
Just wonderful. Now we have to pay taxes on the profit. Take the Middleby offer.
Don’t know what’s going on but too many people saying sell makes me want to hold
To the moon!
"Sold half of the stock holding, take profitsAll the short September 20 puts (sold at $2) looking real good.."
"I just found out today of the hiring of Bill Johnson as CEO. I purchased a large quantity of shares this morning. Not only is the stock low and a steal at the price I got it at, Bill is a winner. I have watched him now for years and have purchased stock after he joins a new company. He will make the shareholders of Welbilt a nice profit."
Any ideas where we going?
WBT should be at $12.00 to $14.00 with the market recovery. Great earnings last quarter. It is lagging behind but will catch up shortly once it breaks $7.00
Look out below..
