This Grabage is waaay ovr bought or short covering. Ridiculous skam. even Aftr Hrs. This will Fall hard tmrow
"What goes up, must come down!! Profit taking and shorts"
"Absolutely the wrong decision! There is no upside potential by accepting Ali Group's bid. With Middleby's offer, you had the potential for significant share price growth. At the end of the day what do we get? Just another short-sighted money grab by WBT's board."
Welbilt is down 14.81% to 4.20
very little insider ownership seems all insider acquisitions have been grants almost no sales of stock . interesting that chief financial officer has acquired more shares over past year than ceo. could be result of just timing but cfo may have better sense of how finances are going at wbt. about average amount of institutional ownership. remainder approx 15% ownership must be individuals.
WBT reached an all time low at 9.72
This stock is a scam
"And the Enodis acquisition rears its ugly head . . . again! Having to restate earnings due to ""a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting related to accounting for income taxes."""

Welbilt is up 10.32% to 11.22
Why didn't PriceWaterhouseCoopers catch these errors? PwC needs to bring in some international tax experts - not the B team.
i think if the offering is allowed the top price for WBT would be around $19.50. Because the offering says it has to go back 30 market days from 04/20/2021. Weekends do not count. I average it out and that's around $15.50. Then I added the 28% above and its around 19.50 per share. The price of the take over company average is about $162 to $164. I hope i did the math close. If you read the offering its not going to be the price it is now. Does this have to be voted on by the shareholders ? Thank you for your help. I hope i ddi this right
"Why is it the price not going up but rather falling a bit, when their report says that they have very good profits?"

"I just found out today of the hiring of Bill Johnson as CEO. I purchased a large quantity of shares this morning. Not only is the stock low and a steal at the price I got it at, Bill is a winner. I have watched him now for years and have purchased stock after he joins a new company. He will make the shareholders of Welbilt a nice profit."
"The offer says it is the average price of WBT back from 04/20/21. 30 market days back. I did the average and I came up with $15.50 about. Then if you add the 28% of the average price, i think its about $19.50 per share. If i did the average 30 market days and the % right. The take over company average was about $162.00 to $163.00 or a little more.. Does this have to be voted on by the shareholders ? To accept this offer. If i went back on the 30 market days correctly i should be close on that price. If someone out there could check this. We could find out exactly what the price would be if the offer is allowed or accepted. Thank you"

"Trading higher than the all cash bid, investors thinking a sweetened bid to clinch the deal? Or a bidding war?"
It will be better in most cases if you take the stock instead of the cash since it won't be taxable immediately.

doesn't seem likely wbt is selling a lot of restaurant equipment to restaurants since few restaurants are very profitable at this time. landlords however may be upgrading equipment in temporarily closed restaurant locations during what they hope is just a temporary lull in demand.
