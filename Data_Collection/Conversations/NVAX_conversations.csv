"Oct 29/21 Motley Fool: ""Why Novavax Stock Is Slipping TodayInvestors seem to be focusing more on a negative story than they are on Novavax's good news.Keith SpeightsOct 29, 2021 at 11:32AMKey PointsNovavax announced it has filed for provisional approval of its COVID-19 vaccine in Australia.However, the good news came on the same day that Politico ran another story critical of the biotech.Novavax says that additional regulatory filings are on the way soon.What happenedShares of Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX were slipping 2.8% lower at 11 a.m. EDT on Friday. The company announced earlier in the day that it has filed for provisional approval of its COVID-19 vaccine NVX-CoV2373 in Australia.Why would the vaccine stock fall on what should be viewed as good news? It wasn't the only news of the day.Politico published an article Friday morning that was highly critical of Novavax's efforts to develop NVX-CoV2373. The article stated that Novavax's ""manufacturing problems have left global distributors without enough shots for poor and middle-income countries."" So whatInvestors appear to be giving more weight to Politico's story than to Novavax's regulatory submission in Australia. That could prove to be shortsighted.Politico had already covered many of the details of Novavax's manufacturing in another piece published last week. But Novavax CEO Stanley Erck made a good point in an interview with Yahoo! News on Wednesday. Erck stated, ""You don't file for emergency use approval if you haven't solved all of your manufacturing issues.""That interview came on the heels of Novavax filing for authorization of its COVID-19 vaccine in the United Kingdom. Just as the company had promised, it quickly followed up with the submission in Australia. Erck was and is right: Novavax would be making a colossal blunder if it had not already solved its manufacturing problems prior to these filings. Now whatNovavax now plans to complete its regulatory filings for NVX-CoV2373 in several other key markets, including Europe, Canada, and New Zealand. It also anticipates submitting its full package to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by the end of 2021."""
"We had 3 Great News today (still in OCTOBER) :1) Novavax completes Australia EUA Filing- Approval in 1-2 weeks, as aussie jabs starts November. 2) India P3 Trial Data complete - last data needed for India Approval. Serum files for complete approval.3) South Korea - Completes Manufacturing for all 40 Million doses, and wants to extended and produce more Novavax vaccines. * Politico tried to cover it with their lies, smokes and shadows, even suggesting that UK filing seems not complete. The smog will clear next week with EU, Canada, N.Z filings, and ER."
"Interesting that Politico chose to follow up its hit piece last week with... another hit piece, coinciding with a major delivery milestone from Novavax. The timing is...curious, no? And just a week later? Hmmm. Maybe I missed it, but when I searched ""Pfizer vaccine"" (among other competitors) on the Politico website, I didn't see any recent headlines about waning immunity, side effects, etc.. Interesting also that Politico seems to be going it alone on this storyline. Which newsroom editor is setting Politico's reporting priorities these days? Note, I'm not a pumper, I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I am a long who believes that the results speak for themselves (and they seem to be doing just that at the moment). Now watch the handful of thumbs down roll in. SMH."
"The mRNA Vaccines Are Extraordinary, but Novavax Is Even BetterPersistent hype around mRNA vaccine technology is now distracting us from other ways to end the pandemic.By Hilda Bastian The AtlanticAt the end of January, reports that yet another COVID-19 vaccine had succeeded in its clinical trials—this one offering about 70 percent protection—were front-page news in the United States, and occasioned push alerts on millions of phones. But when the Maryland-based biotech firm Novavax announced its latest stunning trial results last week, and an efficacy rate of more than 90 percent even against coronavirus variants, the response from the same media outlets was muted in comparison. The difference, of course, was the timing: With three vaccines already authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the nation is “awash in other shots” already, as the The New York Times put it.Practically speaking, this is true. If the FDA sees no urgency, the Novavax vaccine might not be available in the U.S. for months, and in the meantime the national supply of other doses exceeds demand. But the asymmetry in coverage also hints at how the hype around the early-bird vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna has distorted perception. Their rapid arrival has been described in this magazine as “the triumph of mRNA”—a brand-new vaccine technology whose “potential stretches far beyond this pandemic.” Other outlets gushed about “a turning point in the long history of vaccines,” one that “changed biotech forever.” It was easy to assume, based on all this reporting, that mRNA vaccines had already proved to be the most effective ones you could get—that they were better, sleeker, even cooler than any other vaccines could ever be."
"This is the clinical trial that will have the biggest impact on the use of NVAX going forward. In late 2020 and early 2021 people in the UK were vaccinated with either PFE or AZ with a second dose 8-12 weeks later. It is this group where the clinical trial called ""CoV-Boost"" is being run. The trial is designed to give a third booster dose ""at least 84 days after the second dose"". They are testing 7 different vaccines including NVAX as the booster. The first dose was given June 14.21. and testing of blood samples occurs on days 28, 84 and 365.If accrual of volunteers completed by mid-July (I have no idea when they completed just an educated guess) this puts day 84 around mid-October. Then about 4 weeks to collect and analyze all of the data is mid-November.If NVAX is superior in the immune response to this 3rd dose it will become the booster of choice around the world.Sept 16.21 this report was published ""Data from NIHR-supported studies inform UK COVID-19 Booster Programme"" where the advise 3 doses of PFE induced strong responses etc.They can not comment on the results for the NVAX vaccine because at that time it was not approved for use in the UK. This does not mean it wasn't as good as the mRNA boosters it means they can't comment on it so its still privileged information.https://www.nihr.ac.uk/news/data-from-nihr-supported-studies-inform-uk-covid-19-booster-programme/28663Let's see how this works out :-)"
"Pretty good article from tipranks about Analyst commenting the approval, a few good quotes out of it:“Importantly,” said B. Riley analyst Mayank Mamtani, “The filing with MHRA includes all modules required for regulatory review, including CMC data from manufacturing partner, the Serum Institute of India.” This suggests whatever manufacturing issues the company encountered have now been resolved.There should be other regulatory filings ahead too, including in the EU, Canada, and Australia, for which Mamtani expects the application package will include the same dataset. An application for an EUA from the the FDA should also take place before the end of the year. The review process for other approved vaccines has taken between two weeks and a month, the analyst noted."
Novavax is mentioned in the article. Headline: “Canada Expected To Announce More COVID-19 Vaccine Donations As G20 Kicks Off”
"SII seeks Emergency Use Authorization for Covovax vaccine from DCGIThe Serum Institute of India on Friday sought permission from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to provide emergency use authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine Covovax, based on the US-based Novovax's protein vaccine.https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/general-news/sii-seeks-emergency-use-authorisation-for-covovax-vaccine-from-dcgi.html"
"Whenever you think about it just think about two major facts.1. Production capacity scaled up to 150mln/m till year end - means 1.8bln doses in 2022 + additional scaling up can easily push it to 2.2bln.2. MRNA market cap at 120bln with 1bln scale for 2022 and no other approved products, Nvax has imminent approval for Nanoflu once they get breathing space after scaling up covid jabs.Market cap at 11bln - this is priced for a disaster, only Nanoflu has 7-9 market cap potential, the rest is not priced in yet.Good luck."

If vaccines are going to be a part of life going forward Nvax beats mRNA and the others for all of the now obvious reasons. It will be a relief to me to have protein vaccine as a choice. Global pandemic response system and Nvax is at the heart of this effort!
"After several attempts to share a great article published this morning by Seeking Alpha, I am now wondering if it was a dream. Anyway, the article includes a wonderful review of the likely outlook for Novavax and a complete take down of the publication who will not be named’s recent hit pieces. Great article to read if you’re feeling run down by recent efforts to short NVAX."
"Oct 30/21: ""Novavax Stock Offers ‘Another Attractive Entry Point,’ Says AnalystByJames Carter OCT 30, 2021Well folks, it finally happened. After a series of delays which culminated in a recent Politico article saying Novavax (NVAX) was unable to get its Covid-19 vaccine (NVX-CoV2373) manufacturing up to the standard required for filing with the regulators, the company at last submitted its EUA filing to the UK MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency).“Importantly,” said B. Riley analyst Mayank Mamtani, “The filing with MHRA includes all modules required for regulatory review, including CMC data from manufacturing partner, the Serum Institute of India.” This suggests whatever manufacturing issues the company encountered have now been resolved.While questions have been raised whether Novavax has missed the boat with Covid once again on the backfoot, the UK has actually seen a new wave of rising cases with the emergence of the ‘delta plus’ variant. This suggests the pandemic is still an ongoing concern across the pond. As such, Mamtani believes NVX-CoV2373 “could serve as 2nd shot in mix-and-match and 3rd shot in the heterologous boost settings.”There should be other regulatory filings ahead too, including in the EU, Canada, and Australia, for which Mamtani expects the application package will include the same dataset. An application for an EUA from the the FDA should also take place before the end of the year. The review process for other approved vaccines has taken between two weeks and a month, the analyst noted.As the FDA authorized Moderna’s and JNJ’s COVID-19 booster shots with limited data, including the ability to mix-and-match boosters “within a matter of days,” Mamtani thinks this “paradigm sets a low bar” for Novavax to enter the booster market. What’s more, FDA’s latest statements suggest the EUA door “remains open” for Novavax’ offering.With upcoming catalysts including the first wave of regulatory approvals, FDA submission and the delivery of 100 million doses, Mamtani thinks the shares’ recent pullback provides “another attractive entry point.”Accordingly, the analyst reiterated a Buy rating on NVAX, backed by a $305 price target. There’s upside of a hefty 105% from current levels. (To watch Mamtani’s track record, click here)The Street’s average target is only slightly less bullish; at $290.33, the figure implies shares will gain 105% of muscle over the next 12 months. With 2 extra Buy ratings thrown into the pot, the stock qualifies with a Strong Buy consensus rating."""

"A couple of good posts, highlighting that the news tomorrow will be on the tech stocks, specifically lackluster news. A good opportunity for money to move into the Covid vaccine stocks.We know that on Nov EC, the CMA/EUA submissions will be announced, if not before. Furthermore, if they could file for CMA in the UK, we know the filings is fit for purpose for the EU. Not to mention, fit for purpose for the other markets. I am fine with 150 as of now, because we can quickly catapult to an ATH. It has happened before.I also don’t care about scheduled sales. This is how executives make money, Stocks and Bonuses. Their standard paycheck is not commensurate, for the level of stress they are under. If Stan and his team didn’t have this under control, they wouldn’t be able to submit for CMA with the MHRA. Stick with the facts and not conjecture"

"Novavax: A Great Buy On Quickly Growing Production, Super Low Valuation And Many EUA FilingsOct. 30, 2021 8:00 AM ETNovavax, Inc. (NVAX)12 Comments6 LikesUpside Research profile pictureUpside Research1.46K FollowersBioFollowLong/Short Equity, Deep Value, Value, Growth At A Reasonable PriceContributor Since 2013I search for companies that have strong fundamentals, but that are undervalued due to fear, so I can invest in them at a great price. I also search for companies that are overvalued due to greed that have weaknesses such as poor free cash flow or an unviable business model, so I can short them. As Warren Buffet recommends: buy fear and sell greed. When I find potential candidates, I research the daylights out of them and only choose the best opportunities. To give you an idea of some the stocks I’ve focused on, in the past I successfully shorted Twitter, GoPro, Garmin, TrueCar, FCX, Wayfair, Pandora and Transocean, and was successfully long Cisco, Expedia, Goodyear Tire, Facebook, Apple, Celgene, BioNTech and Novocure. Many of those are no longer good shorts or longs. For example, as of Sept 2021, Apple and BioNTech are overvalued. My current favorite long stock is Novavax (NVAX). I was previously a consultant for executives at companies such as Fidelity Investments and Google, including the Vice-president of Sales at Google. Prior to that I owned and operated two retail stores that I sold, and before that I was a journalist. I’ve been investing for 27 years in stocks, bonds, commodities and options. I spend a lot of my free time researching investments and donate at least half of the gains to charity. SummaryNovavax's manufacturing targets are on track and just increased dramatically to 2.4 billion doses per year. EUAs have been filed in multiple countries and more are coming soon.Novavax already has orders for about 2 billion doses, far more than most people realize. I expect it will sell about 2.7 billion doses between 2021 and 2022.I expect very high revenues of ~$22 billion in 2022 will result in high profits, and also a far higher share price.The stock is heavily undervalued, as illustrated by the consensus price target of analysts that is roughly 95% higher than the current price.A recent article full of inaccuracies caused the stock to unjustifiably drop 20%. Now Novavax is an even greater buy, one of the best buys I've seen in years. Vials With the Covid-19 Vaccine and Syringes are Displayed On a Tray at the Corona Vaccination CenterMorsa Images/DigitalVision via Getty ImagesIn investing, any time there is a major gap between popular perception and reality, a good buying opportunity often exists, and sometimes even a great one. Right now, there are three major informational gaps of this type related to Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX), making for a tremendous buying opportunity. Overall, it is one of the best I've seen in recent years. A few past articles I've written at Seeking Alpha have been followed by gains of 500% to 1,000%, as you can see here and here. While this gain likely won't be quite that high, it's still top-notch and I think it will likely end up being among the top 10 gainers that the majority of investors have in their investing lives."
"I am not saying the initial Politico article did not have it's basis in some kernel of fact. But its ""truth"" came from an Aug. 6th NY Times article about US funding being halted fir vaccine production due to issues at the FujiFilm plant in Tx. Politico's sin was to knowingly rehash that same story, vaguely written, as a completely new investigative story implying world-wide manufacturing issues (or leading readers to think so). And the fact they did so on the same day that the purchase by Alex Springer, SE was finalized is of itself suspect."
