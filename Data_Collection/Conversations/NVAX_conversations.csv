"The new study is testing a half dose of Moderna and Pfizer, clearly because of safety concerns! I would argue because of high level of antigen. With NVAX they are testing a full dose. If you read between the lines, it says it all- they don't have the same safety concerns with NVAX!!!"
"BEWARE Longs! ZOD the maggot is posting false info here about Trizzino's stock transactions saying Trizzino has zero stock now and I have reported him for posting criminally false info. The fact two days ago Trizzino exercised 7,499 stock options to buy at $19.08 and he still has 125,002 shares of such options left to exercise in the future. As many of us know, corporate granted stock options can be exercised only based on the pre-planned and agreed schedules it is nothing unusual. If one were to go by such actions we saw with MRNA not long ago with heightened frequency, then one would have expected the company to be out of business by now!"
Too much positive data and information on manufacturing partners out there for this to be down like this. Someone is holding the stock back to steal shares. Soon this culminates in huge gains for those who have endured. Holding at times is not easy here but it will be the right thing in the end.
"Does Yahoo delete all positive information on the possible benefits of the Novavax vaccine, over the Pfizer or Maderna?"
"I just found out the Gods at Yahoo's control room graciously (not) gave me back my account. I'm not sure when it was reinstated. I need to decide whether I use Jedi007 or keep using Jedi-007. Perhaps Real Longs will let me know.Anyway, this attack was expected. It was heading that direction yesterday. It was well planned and executed. Remember HF/Shorties borrowed several 100K of NVAX shares last week. Unfortunately, we can't go up against HF who have Billions of dollars. They are in control for now. Even the mighty AAPL got hammered by them the last few days, down from its high 157 to 147. Also FYI, NVAX is the second most shorted stock after TSLA.As I'm sorry to admit, HF/shorties will keep planning and executing attacks until NVAX management gives the market meaty boneS so the stock will have a solid foundation and enough munitions to thwart attacks.NVAX, ""Own It Don't Trade It"""
FDA rejected pfizer boost shot!! good for nvax!
"True Believers - This was a desperate coup attempt by HF and shorties to sink SP. Which begs the question: was it a pure coincidence to have this failed attempt alongside with the UK article written by a mediocre local newspaper? In my humble opinion, it was not. Too bad for the weak hands who jumped off quickly. Look where it closed, observe and learn. However, I thank you for selling them to me below 230.Although I muted them, I am certain I will be hounded by Tom Kasansky/Pete Mitchell after posting this. They can't resist.Have a great weekend, true believers."
Both of them looked very confident when they responded on the progress of regulatory filings and approvals.
"FDA staff declined pfe’s COVID boost shot, citing lack of verified data"
Found this on another forum.. he has a point I think… I don’t know that answer but Novavax doesn’t reveal to trial sites / peeps with these types of info . I’ve ask my handlers numerous times and they know as much as the internet. They only collect data. We will know soon enough though ! Hold tight to those shares and think critically with those contracts is my advice ! GL
"Breaking News, Mabion: “In recent months, the Company has also focused its efforts on implementing a joint venture with Novavax. In this area, Mabion completed works related to the transfer of the production process of the vaccine antigen against COVID-19 on a laboratory scale, which included both the stages of cell culture and the process of purification of the vaccine antigen. In accordance with the provisions of the framework agreement concluded in March this year. with Novavax, the Company completed the analysis of Novavax's process and analytical documentation, as well as prepared the quality system for the implementation of the new process and analytics. Other completed activities include the increase in the scale of the process of cell culture in bioreactors on a commercial scale, as well as the planned double implementation of this process under the contract.After these actions, the product was successfully cleaned and analyzed in accordance with the procedures and requirements of Novavax, also included in the previous transfer works. The results of the analyzes show that the Company obtained the desired high-quality product.In addition to technological activities, tasks aimed at securing the possibility of regular, commercial production of vaccine antigen in the form of purchase, installation and qualification of the necessary process and analytical equipment were also carried out. An important element of Mabion's activities was to secure the materials necessary for production in the subsequent periods.All work on the first order for the framework agreement that was planned at the current stage has been successfully completed. The company estimates that the stage relating to the entirety of the first order to the framework agreement has been completed in over 90 percent. The remaining work to be performed mainly consists in the preparation of some reports, which will be provided after the possible signing of a commercial production contract with Novavax. It is worth adding that the infrastructure and material base are ready to start the next stages of cooperation.Moreover, in July this year. The company received an advance payment from Novavax for the purchase by Mabion of materials and raw materials constituting the basis for commercial production of a vaccine antigen (protein) against COVID-19 (event after the balance sheet date), which is part of the implementation of another order from Novavax received in June this year. The contracting of raw materials for production at the present stage of cooperation, i.e. in advance, will allow for faster commencement of the provision of manufacturing services after the conclusion of a commercial production contract with Novavax. More information on this advance payment is available in the financial statements for 1H 2021.In terms of equipment and production capabilities, the Mabion plant is ready to start the production of antigen for Novavax on a commercial scale. All the preparatory works that were planned and possible to be carried out so far have been completed. We have strong confirmation that our facility can produce the vaccine antigen on a commercial scale. The technology transfer required a huge mobilization and dedication from the entire Mabion team, which is why we are proud that we completed the preparation for production process in a short time and we are very satisfied with the parameters of the produced antigen. If a commercial production contract is signed, production may take place in two bioreactors currently owned by Mabion in order to use the currently available, full production capacity of the plant.The next stages may be based on the capacity extended by further bioreactors - says Krzysztof Kaczmarczyk, President of the Management Board of Mabion SA”"
"""BRUSSELS updated 42 minutes agoCorona vaccination""Novavax"": Covid-19 vaccine amazes researchers - is vaccine now replacing Biontech, Moderna and Co.?The new corona vaccine ""Novavax"" is on everyone's lips. The EU has already secured hundreds of millions of vaccine doses. But why are experts so amazed by the ""Novavax"" vaccine?A new vaccine should soon be approved in the European Union.

"I don't want anyone to miss Javaid's post. Read it and feel better! Hold tight longs!""Javaid 3 hours agoIt has been very interesting and helpful to read all the posts especially those dealing with the science and technology.I am convinced that Novavax is the best in class for COVID vaccines and that what stands between the laboratory and getting it into millions of arms is manufacturing consistency and logistics, which will require laser focussed management attention. The question is ""when"" and not ""if""!I need to sell about 25% of my shareholding to fund a construction project and have decided this morning not to do so, and instead to borrow the required funds.Why? I believe it is only a matter of time, and not ""if"", and put forward the following:The recent 71 page presentation is management's attempt to set the record straight and to position all the key milestones conservatively - it is a plan they know they can beat.Senior management have exercised all their options and sold a few shares, to acquire the remaining and pay taxes, which is good tax planning. You wouldn't do this if the world was going to fall apart.A senior independent director has added to his shareholding.Europe and Japan and several major companies have recently signed procurement agreements albeit conditional on approval. The heads of Europe and Japan would not do this if their due diligence hadn't been positive. Why make a fool of yourselves?There are of course many other positive indicators.The SP will rise and exponentially very soon and will then be out of reach and keep going up on additional catalyst events coming into being."""
"Reading the transcript from yesterday's conference call, I am reassured that we have resolved all the technical issues and the filing process is well under way, delayed yes, but given the mammoth task across all sites and filing in multiple regulatory environments we are filing getting there. Still long and strong. Good luck to fellow longs."
"The reason why Valneva replacement, if any, will be done by Novavax is 1) only Novavax and AZ are produced directly in the UK, but not Pfizer or Moderna and 2) Efficacy against variants of Novavax is off the charts (antibody titers results). So why would you buy smt from outside that is not up to par to what you have at home?"
"Novavax Will Enter the Covid-19 Vaccine Race With a Bang • 9/13/2021 6:00am EDT • By Muslim FarooqueMany believe that Novavax (NASDAQ:NVAX) stock is late to the party with a Covid-19 vaccine.￼The company has been struggling for a long time to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration for its coronavirus vaccine approved. Multiple players are already in the U.S. market, complicating the approval process and leaving little room for growth.However, the company has massive potential to grow outside the U.S., including the highly lucrative booster market. NVAX stock offers an attractive risk/reward profile at this time that hasn’t fully incorporated the impact of Novavax’s pipeline and its global potential.NVAX stock has been on a roll since the beginning of the year, rising 117% in value. Its returns have comfortably surpassed those of the S&P 500. It now boasts a market capitalization of over $16 billion, which still pales compared to industry stalwarts such as Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA). Moderna’s market cap is over 9x that of Novavax.Hence, there is still a hefty upside to Novavax, considering how the market hasn’t captured the full potential of its candidates.An Exciting ComboFor Novavax to shift its priorities and focus on its Covid-19 program was a no-brainer. The opportunity was massive, and with the government throwing $1.6 billion it’s way to develop its vaccine candidate, it was an easy choice.However, Novavax hasn’t forgotten about its promising NanoFlu vaccine and the unique combination it serves alongside the Covid-19 vaccine. The company announced promising preclinical data evaluating the combo. A Phase 1 study should begin in Australia later this year. • 7 of the Best Large-Cap Stocks to Buy NowNanoFlu could become a key differentiator for Novavax in the future and has already demonstrated safety and efficacy. Add booster shots to the equation, and you have a mouth-watering value proposition with Novavax at the forefront.Its one-of-a-kind coronavirus vaccine is developed using traditional vaccine development methods, giving it the edge in safety and trust. Efficacy rates are staggering and are over 90% for high-risk populations. The Serum Institute of India, its contract manufacturer, filed for a WHO emergency use listing last month. The institute also approved Phase 2/3 trials for the vaccine on people age 2 to 17.The vaccine candidate is expected to release in India in October, which would be a robust catalyst in achieving approval in other countries.”"
was there a political decision to keep novavax out of the loop of emergency use authorization of vaccines in the us? did Dr fauci or the FDA or CDC put political pressure to push MRA vaccines versus traditional vaccines like novovax? it's newsworthy if fauci since falchi stands to gain royalties from moderna.
"The following is what Dr. Glenn explained at the conference on Monday in detail about the page 24 of the Q2 EC slides. The hACE2 inhibition capability of CoV2373 will be a key differentiator compared to others. As Dr. Glenn said, it prevents the infection as well as disease. Vernon BernardinoNow, there seems to be special things about your ACE2 inhibition assay. What have you seen there, particularly with the Delta variant?Greg GlennYes. So this is actually, as you know, measuring the immune responses can be done from fairly different angles, one is to measure spike antibodies. It’s not very specific. It’s commonly done. Neutralizing antibodies where you grow up the virus in itself setting they’ve generally been felt to be important and potentially predictive. We liked the receptor binding inhibition assay, because that is really specific to the variance. What we do is you make the spike, you make Alpha, Beta, Delta, as you know, they will – and the variations will be reflected in the spike structure and a very much affect what antibodies can recognize them.So we – they however all recognize the ACE2 receptor in human. So we make for common human ACE2 receptor. We make spike for the different variants. Both that interaction is extremely high affinity. It’s like superglue. That explains why these viruses are so very infectious. And so the – what we are doing in this assay then is measuring the ability the antibodies to block that very high affinity interaction.So it’s our opinion if you have receptor by any blocking antibody specific to the variants, it’s a very good indicator that the vaccine efficacy can be – will be high, because you’re blocking that initial event of infection. And so I think that’s what you see in our clinical data that we’re blocking symptomatic infection, which is really not easy to do mild, moderate, or severe at a very high rate.And I think that, that, that assays a reflection of the approach to block infection if you will. And of course, we have quite a bit of non-human primate data where it’s fairly easy to assess the block, the ability to block infection, then that again is a hallmark of our vaccine, is we can challenge these immunized non-human primates with virus and show that there’s no viral replication in the nose. And so that’s a really – that’s an important indicator that our vaccine can actually block infection as well as disease."
Pfizer's bad news is our good news. FDA panel rules against Pfizer booster for ages 16 and older! in my opinion novavax will not only gain approval but they will be the only company to offer the flu shot and booster together. Do not make the mistake of selling. I was in at $3 and made money on the way up but I could have been a millionaire I'm not making the same mistake twice.

"I got this response TODAY from Faberco Life Sciences who is the distributor of Covovax in the Philippines. Covovax is produced by SII under license to NVAX in response to query I made last week regarding Philippines FDA approval of the vaccine !.""We are still under FDA’s review process and we anticipate to get the response within the third quarter of 2021.”that's end of Sept so Philippines approval coming this month !!"
"Reposting it since I read similar discussion today.What a 1:6 share split would do for NovavaxNovavax has not announced any intention to do a share split at this stage. This is an evaluation of the advantages should they make such a strategic move.Novavax has 74mil shares in issue, while Moderna has 401mil shares in issue for a ratio of 5.4 Moderna shares for every Novavax share. Optics is a fact of life. It's not always rational nor logical, but it is very real. The optics here is that a Novavax share price of $230 “looks” expensive compared to a Moderna share price of $430, yes optics. The reality is that a $230 Novavax share price in comparative shares in issue numbers is only $38 relative to the Moderna share price. Again, optics, the excessive share price discount is patently obvious at $38. Novavax would do well to do a share split of 1:6 earlier rather than later to rebalance the shares in issue relationship for a more realistic reflection of the relative price relationship between Novavax and Moderna.A six for one share split would take a $230 Novavax share price back to $38, and then, all naïve market and the not so naïve market participants would see how the Novavax share price is trading at a very attractive discount to competitors in the face of significant progress and competitive standing at this stage.Let's suggest that the Novavax share price should be trading in the $400 to $450 range, Split the Novavax share six for one, and let's suggest that the share should be trading in the $67 to $70 range, and it sounds a lot more reasonable. Let's go one step further and suggest that the Novavax share price should be trading in the $540 to $600 range to be on par with the share price of Moderna in the pre-EUA application phase, and again, investors will balk at that suggestion but split the stock six for one, and a trading range of $90 to $100 is totally in line with where Moderna was trading prior to submitting EUA, and on top of it, Moderna did not have its Phase 3 trial data in hand at that stage.Everybody has a risk profile, but the $38 Novavax share price vs. a $430 Moderna share price based on the same number of shares, the trading ranges of BioNTech and Moderna in the after Phase 3 trial data and pre EUA applications stage and given currently available information, certainly ranks with the best risk/reward opportunities in the market presently."

"A new article titled ""Adar Poonawala's Big Announcement About Children's Vaccine""Posted on September 18, 2021, which reconfirms the Jan/Feb availability of Covovax for kidsIn a press conference held on Friday, Adar Poonawala answered a question in this regard. Tests for the covavax vaccine of serum for young children are running smoothly. ""If all the tests and procedures are carried out properly, the vaccine will be available for children in early January next year, January-February 2022,"" said Poonawala. Many volunteers have been given vaccine doses for testing. The tests are running smoothly. The tests will be reviewed by the end of this year, Poonawala said.Informing about the testing process, Adar Poonawala said, ""It will take us at least 3 to 4 months to check how safe the vaccine is for children."" We are working on this in stages. Children under the age of 12 are also included in the tests. All parents want their children safe. We believe that Kovavax will be approved by January-February next year. However, this can only happen when the DCGI deems it appropriate to do so."
Do you see the stars starting to align? Pfizer rejected for general population booster shots and Novavax being trialed in UK as a booster shot for those who already had Pfizer? Only Moderna and Novavax are being studied as a booster or even as the second dose after one Pfizer dose. I think that the powers that be already know the results from the 7 vaccine mix and match study and they are now proving that with this current study. I predict this will be the last study announced before approval. GLTAL.

"IMAGES.NVAX news：Multiple catalysts will make Novavax shares jump in 2021Taylor Carmichael (Novavax): Novavax stock has already doubled this year, running from $112 back in January to $233 this week. But there's plenty of gas left in the tank, and I expect another double by the end of the year.Right now, Moderna enjoys a $169 billion market cap, and BioNTech sports a $79 billion valuation. Meanwhile, Novavax is positively cheap with its $17 billion market cap. The difference, of course, is that the mRNA biotechs have both of their COVID-19 vaccines on the market now, while Novavax is still waiting for its first Emergency Use Authorization. But when the government agencies start allowing Novavax to distribute its COVID-19 vaccine, the stock will really start to soar.The majority of the world's population still has not been vaccinated. Novavax will have 2 billion doses of vaccine ready to distribute in 2022. And the biotech has multiple agreements for supplying locations around the world: 100 million doses for the U.S., 150 million doses for Japan, 200 million doses for Europe, and over 1 billion doses for the developing world. The U.S. paid $1.3 billion in advance to secure its 100 million doses of the company's experimental vaccine. That works out to $13 a dose. While the dollar amounts of the various purchase agreements are undisclosed, Japan and Europe will likely pay a higher dollar amount, while the developing world agreements will be discounted. It's entirely possible that Novavax's revenue next year will be higher than its market cap today.I'm expecting Novavax shares to spike higher as its vaccine starts receiving authorization around the world in the fourth quarter. Novavax's vaccine candidate will be popular both as a booster shot and as an initial vaccine for the majority of the world who are unvaccinated. And Novavax is leading in the race to combine the COVID-19 vaccine with a flu vaccine. The company just kicked off a combo trial in Australia involving 640 people who have been vaccinated against both diseases with a single shot."
yahoo deleted a post of mine that suggested that some people may not want an mRNA vaccine.
"Folks, I don’t know what better hint we can get than a draft White House targets list that mentions “if authorized, protein subunit vaccine manufacturing and tech transfer” IN THE SAME SENTENCE AS “procuring approximately 3 billion additional doses of safe and effective vaccines for LIC/LMICs.”I’ve been saying for months that Novavax will be key to the US vaccine-diplomacy effort. You are about to see it happen!"
"Couple of months for filing submission everywhere puts us somewhere in November. So, let’s say by Thanksgiving all sumbissions will be filed. Then a month or two to approve the vaccine, it means there will be no jabs in arms until 2022 the earliest. Just setting my expectations right. Everything before that would be great, but I’m not expecting anything until January. That means government gave mrna vaccines a year head start in comparing to nvax. And funny thing is they will call nvax a “second generation vaccine”…and they could have already approved it. Be patient - our time is Q1 2022 and onwards."
Dose sparing Half dose NVAX (2.5/25) is likely eliciting the immunological response comparable to 30 mcg of Pfizer and 50 mcg of Moderna in the Cov-Boost trial. This result alone might independently be a bigger catalyst then all approvals combined.
"Bill Gates quote, “There’s two big things that have made things less far along in getting to the end than I expected. One is that a number of the vaccines have just taken longer to ramp up big manufacturing — and that includes Novavax and Johnson & Johnson. I’m in no way impugning those companies. This is hard stuff, new stuff. So it’s very complicated. I was, in retrospect, over-optimistic about ramping up the volume of those vaccines.”"
"If your investing in NVAX for any reason other than backing scientist bringing amazing products to market you missed the boat. Take a seat and watch innovation coming from a small dedicated group whose impact with Covid-19, Nanoflu, RSV and Malaria are unrivaled in thier impact on future world health benefits. It's been thier life's work to get these products through the the international gauntlet of process, procedures and licensure. No small feat for the largest corporation let alone one if the smallest teams. So if profit is your only driver take time to observe the gathering of the international cooperation with trust these folks have developed in Great Britain, India, Japan, Germany, Korea, Phillipines and the USA. I could not be more proud for them. Quickly becoming the SpaceX of pharma. Oh and it's been a bumpy ride no doubt but in six years from a under 10.00 stock to as high as 340 it's made me 7 figures with no eua or bla as of yet. Im patient for blast off.. Good Luck to All Real Longs."

"Sept 10 (Reuters) - Vaccine developer Novavax Inc said on Friday at least 2 billion doses of its COVID-19 vaccine would be available in 2022.The company, which in June announced its vaccine was more than 90% effective in a late-stage U.S.-based clinical trial, said it was on track to file an application for emergency use of its vaccine to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the fourth quarter.Novavax, speaking at a Morgan Stanley healthcare conference, reiterated that it would have about 100 million doses per month by the end of the third quarter this year, and would increase it to 150 million doses in the fourth quarter.""We're already engaging in conversations about incremental procurement for the second half of 2022, as well as early 2023, especially given current vaccination rates around the globe,"" said John Trizzino, chief commercial officer at Novavax, adding that the booster strategy would create additional demand for its vaccines.In recent months, Novavax has entered several supply deals globally for its protein-based vaccine, including an agreement with the European Commission for 200 million doses."
"My wife asked me to some chores, I said in a couple of NVAX days. She said I want it complete this week, not in a couple of months."
"Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla feels that vaccine exports may ease out in the coming two months, provided India has created enough stockpile to weather any imminent third wave. Meanwhile, raw material supplies for the Novavax vaccine have improved compared to March, and SII plans to announce their monthly production plan in December.Speaking to the media Poonawalla said on Friday that “There were no ban on exports, but there were temporary restrictions, and rightly so. I think it will slowly ease in the next month or two, but I don’t want to venture a guess. But, it will happen very soon.”He added that India is coming very close to a point where there is more than enough vaccine stock. Poonawalla clarified that easing of export restrictions is a Government of India decision, and that they will go by what the Centre feels is appropriate.“The Centre has to balance the needs of the country and stockpile vaccines for India in case of a third and fourth waves. Taking lessons from what we have learnt in the first and second waves, the government is rightly being very cautious,” he added.SII is expanding its Covishield capacity, which now stands at around 160 mn doses a month, and from October it is expected to touch 200 mn doses a month.On the other hand, the production of the Novavax vaccine is not constrained by SII’s capacities, but by raw materials, Poonawalla said. SII was working on developing alternative vendor sources for critical raw materials. “Developing new supplies takes time. The silver lining is we have got people who can make quality raw materials, but they are inundated with orders from different vaccine companies – from Korea, China, Europe etc,” he added.SII is trying its best to scale up Novavax vaccine production, Poonawalla claimed, and that there have been major improvements in raw material supplies since March. “We will wait and see, and in December for sure we can comment on what our monthly production will be,” he said.As for Novavax vaccine’s clinical trials on paediatric population, Poonawalla updated that they started the trials, and three to four months is the minimum time-frame for that. By January-February, there is a possibility, that Covovax (SII manufactured Novavax vaccine) could be ready for approval for use in kids."

"Do you really believe that they withheld the mix and match results of Novavax because the results were bad? They withheld them because they are waiting on production to catch up so that when they do start releasing all of these studies’ results, that will be spectacular by the way, that they will already have approval and doses ready to deliver. If the results were the worst, they would have released them by now. No harm, no foul."

"It has been very interesting and helpful to read all the posts especially those dealing with the science and technology.I am convinced that Novavax is the best in class for COVID vaccines and that what stands between the laboratory and getting it into millions of arms is manufacturing consistency and logistics, which will require laser focussed management attention. The question is ""when"" and not ""if""!I need to sell about 25% of my shareholding to fund a construction project and have decided this morning not to do so, and instead to borrow the required funds.Why? I believe it is only a matter of time, and not ""if"", and put forward the following:The recent 71 page presentation is management's attempt to set the record straight and to position all the key milestones conservatively - it is a plan they know they can beat.Senior management have exercised all their options and sold a few shares, to acquire the remaining and pay taxes, which is good tax planning. You wouldn't do this if the world was going to fall apart.A senior independent director has added to his shareholding.Europe and Japan and several major companies have recently signed procurement agreements albeit conditional on approval. The heads of Europe and Japan would not do this if their due diligence hadn't been positive.

"“Overseas Deals Are Keeping NVAX Stock a WinnerIt may not be in the same position as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE right now, but Novavax is more similar to these three front runners than it is to the rest of the pack. That’s because, although NVAX has yet to enter the U.S. Covid-19 vaccine market, it continues to lock down big deals abroad. Most recently, this was seen with the company’s deal with Takeda Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TAK in Japan. As InvestorPlace’s Samuel O’Brient reported on Sept. 7, the company is licensing its vaccine to Takeda, which will manufacture 150 million doses for the Japanese government. This deal is particularly promising in two ways.First, the agreement further demonstrates how Novavax will not be held back by production and supply problems. Secondly, though, an order of this size could give the vaccine some much-needed social proof. That means that additional big-ticket orders from major countries across the world could follow.The No. 1 Stock to BuyThis is the only stock you should evenconsider buying today.Swimming in vaccine orders, this company appears set to deliver strong results in the coming year. But best of all? As I mentioned before, all the company really has to do to get NVAX stock moving higher is meet expectations.”"

"The fact that this UK manufacturing delay is being publicized in articles, and the data from the mix and match study in relation to novavax’s vaccine not being published could potentially point to the UK doing the same thing to the Novavax contract as they did to Valneva. I can only hope this is not the case."

"The following is full answer of John about the regulatory status at today's conference. Yes. So – yes, it’s a pivotal question, Vernon and so tremendous amount of progress has been made and continues to be made. I think it’s important for everybody to recognize that we’ve built a global manufacturing infrastructure over the last year that has a robust eight different antigen manufacturing facilities in seven different countries. And of course, the dozen different regulatory authorities that we’re engaged with in order to share our information, rolling submissions, as we’ve reported before, about how we’re sharing that information so that we can keep them as updated as we can in our progress.I think most everybody at this point is aware of the fact that we’ve now filed with our partner Serum Institute in India, Indonesia and the Philippines. Of course, there’s keen interest in what we’re doing in the high-income countries. And so there’s been a lot of work done, specifically over the past few weeks with pre-submission meetings that given us the chance to kind of engage with the regulatory authorities and get some input from them about the variety of topics that would be in that final CMC package, which is really kind of the gating event at the moment.And we, at this point have alignment with these regulatory authorities on what will be needed, we’ve made some adjustments and that’s taken a little bit of time to execute. But it’s all been, it’s all been very positive. This is resulted in a converging of what these different submissions look like. And so I think what we’re left with is that today, and then kind of through only a short, next couple of months, you’ll be seeing a variety of these submissions being made and complete submissions for review by these regulatory authorities.So I think, we’re confident in that position and what’s been going on, I think, we’ve also talked about the asset work that we’ve been doing and some of the challenges we’ve had with some of the assays that are generally speaking kind of very complicated to get completed. We’re happy to report again, like the other regulatory filings that we’ve engaged with the appropriate regulatory authorities have sought their comment and input on analytical methods. And that at this point, we were already to include those in the final submissions and that we have now validated all of these assays. And so we’re confident in what the output’s going to be. And we’ve also began testing the produced vaccine with these assays. So I think it’s a great setup for us to get to this emergency use authorization, accelerated approval, EUL and WHO and so across the board. So happy to report all that and provide that update."
"I take it that the Seeking Alpha article has been posted, because when I try to post the whole thing in 3 posts, Yahoo deletes it?So, here is the Conclusion of the article;""ConclusionNovavax's Covid-19 and combined vaccine enjoy a substantial edge over existing vaccines in the market. With the help of its contract manufacturer, SII, Novavax has made notable progress in the highly lucrative Indian market. New Zealand's recent confirmation provides strong validation for the company's foothold in the booster market. The company has ample capital required ($2.1Bn in cash) to undergo vaccine development and production seamlessly without interruption. The booster market and the underpenetrated international market offer massive headroom for growth which has not been fully incorporated in the company's valuation considering its relatively cheap valuation multiples. We are reinstating our 'buy' rating on the stock as it continues to offer a highly attractive risk/reward profile despite the 40% rally in the last month."""
"The FDA passing on booster shots for everyone is HUGE bonus for NVAX.The first is the reason they passed was the risk/reward profile did not justify it.Meaning they are well aware younger folks are a risk from mRNA vaccines but face little reward from getting a third shot.With NVAX the risk profile basically does not exist because it will be super safe from all side effects.....the data shows the side effects the placebo are equal to the real shot arm (vs about a 400% difference in mRNA vaccines).So there is no real downside to giving anyone a 3rd shot....only upside.The second reason the delay is HUGE for NVAX is it will mean NVAX will now be in play when the FDA finally does approve booster shots (that day has to come because mRNA vaccines, especially Pfizer, wane rapidly over time). Meaning that conditional order for 600M doses from the US will come into play shortly after the FDA does approve NVAX."
This Twitter post says she IS getting a third dose: “I participated in the novavax trial in the US...I am now in the third trial to test the booster.” Link in comments.
Gottleib was jabbering on about distribution and supply. The price and cost of his vaccine is 2-3 higher than NVAX which has higher safety and multi-variant protection and we only need trucks and a fridge. Pfizer was a rich persons bandaid.
"FDA votes ""NO"" for boosters will be positive for NVAX. For now... It's a matter of time coming this cold fall/winter cases will rise again and people will get hospitalized. Boosters will absolutely most definitely be needed. The timing aligns up to when NVAX will be authorized.NVAX is more appropriate & clearly the safest best option for booster of choice for ALL ages."

"NOVAVAX: FULL STEAM AHEADSeeking Alpha By Sarel OberholsterAll Aboard!Jeffrey Hung from Morgan Stanley posed this question to John J. Trizzino, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer and Chief Business Officer of Novavax. “Are there any aspects of the Novavax story that you think investors underappreciate?” His answer. “Just because you’re a few months behind, 9 months behind, from the first, does not mean that you’re bashed into second place. It doesn’t mean that you don’t have a good solution. So, I think sometimes a little bit slower but surer wins the race.”Behind that statement is the acute awareness that Novavax is coming from behind. A tunnel vision approach will see only the sales, manufacturing and delivery achieved by the two first mover mRNA vaccine manufacturers to date but there is a lot more to acknowledge. Yes, Novavax is behind on this narrow evaluation, but they are ahead on the stability (logistical and storage requirements) of the Novavax candidate vaccine. Novavax is ahead on the development of a flu vaccine. Novavax is ahead on the development of a Combo COVID/Seasonal Influenza vaccine. Novavax is ahead with a low dose vaccine. Novavax is ahead in testing with SII, variant specific vaccine candidates in monovalent and in bivalent format for boosters with the submission for a clinical trial on a multitude of formulations. Novavax is ahead in testing even smaller dose COVID vaccine candidates at only 3 μg per shot. Novavax is also ahead on targeting an annual rather than 6 monthly boosting regime by achieving high levels of highly functional antibody responses with their vaccine.When looking at Novavax from the perspective of an evolutionary arms race engaged with the SARS-CoV-2 virus then the picture changes and Novavax is ahead in the long game.Assays have been validated and manufacturing at scale is implemented and on track. Regulatory submissions for emergency authorization of the vaccine are on track on a parallel path which does not impede manufacturing progress. Filings are now formalities to be completed whereafter shipping and delivery can commence. The Novavax manufacturing partners around the globe are already all aboard and dedicated to the Novavax technology.The Novavax Express will soon sound the “All Aboard” call to investors as it accelerates into the next phase of its development. Do you have a ticket if this fits your risk profile, or your investment profile? Do you have a seat booked on the Novavax Express?"
Valneva was one of the seven in the UK Cov-boost study. Guess their results were not very good.
"The FDA did not say no to boosters yet.The decision this afternoon came from an advisory committee. The FDA can always overrule this recomendation and still allow the booster. Either way, this can a positive for NVAX. SoRELAX!!!"
"NVAX. I follow charts closely and study patterns. Just to make sure I was keeping it real, I had my chart guy who is not invested in NVAX look at the chart and give me his view. Downside is limited and support is well above our cost basis. Go look at CVAC. Even with a less than favorable press release, there is limited downside to vaccine makers right now. That’s the way it goes. That said, NVAX has so many irons in the fire, they will hit something or some things by year end 2021. Stay focused. Target  $500+. A breakthrough is coming. "
"Also, if the USG and UK Govts are purposely not mentioning NVAX because it isn't approved yet and they want people to get mRNA... that is irresponsible and just another reason why nobody trusts the government. Imagine getting an inferior vaccine because the Govt keeps pushing it and then one or two months later a superior vaccine is approved. Just keep building mistrust among your citizens. If this is the reason why NVAX isn't being mentioned then it will backfire on them."

"The Lancet paper ""Considerations in boosting COVID-19 vaccine immune responses"" is worth reading. It really isn't against boosting in the general population. It just recommends not to boost now since the benefit isn't clear and there are clear disadvantages such as increasing rate of serious adverse events. I've selected a few important observations from the paper below. My overall take of the paper is that general boosting is not needed now. The data, however, clearly indicated waning immunity so boosting will eventually be needed, likely closer to a year time. Then, boosters should be from a vaccine that show broader protection against variants and higher durability. That most likely will be Cov2373.1. ""Most of the observational studies on which this conclusion (boosting is needed now) is based are, however, preliminary and difficult to interpret precisely due to potential confounding and selective reporting... Randomised trials are relatively easy to interpret reliably, but there are substantial challenges in estimating vaccine efficacy from observational studies undertaken in the context of rapid vaccine roll-out. Estimates may be confounded both by patient characteristics at the start of vaccine roll-out and by time-varying factors that are missed by electronic health records.""2. ""...there could be risks if boosters are widely introduced too soon, or too frequently, especially with vaccines that can have immune-mediated side-effects (such as myocarditis, which is more common after the second dose of some mRNA vaccines,3 or Guillain-Barre syndrome, which has been associated with adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccines4). If unnecessary boosting causes significant adverse reactions, there could be implications for vaccine acceptance that go beyond COVID-19 vaccines. ""3. ""If new variants that can escape the current vaccines are going to evolve, they are most likely to do so from strains that had already become widely prevalent. The effectiveness of boosting against the main variants now circulating and against even newer variants could be greater and longer lived if the booster vaccine antigen is devised to match the main circulating variants.6 There is an opportunity now to study variant-based boosters before there is widespread need for them.""The first observation is worth keeping in mind just from a critical reading point of view. Statistics must be done right, else it can fool you. I've seen papers from places like Qatar with conflicting conclusions from paper to paper.The second says that it is yet unclear how to balance the risks and benefits profile of the current mRNA and vector vaccines. Boosting may be necessary in the immunocompromised population, but general boosting with these vaccines may lead to bad consequences both for individual health and people's attitude toward vaccines.The third is clearly correct in that new variants will mutate away from vaccines based on the original Wuhan virus. Initial titer is a measure of how well the immune system has learned from different features of the virus. A vaccine like Pfizer with low initial titer would not have learned much from features of the virus that could be used to thwart it. And, as such, new variants could easily escape the vaccine. The worst part is that these variants may evolve stronger from vaccinated people who were reinfected."

"Saw a post here a while ago about whitehouse vs FDA/CDC on booster. I’m getting the feeling we are now in an conundrum. The Pfizer vaccines for the fist vaccinated are probably about to the point of useless. The risk reward of boosting with a third dose of mRNA is probably questionable. Yet I get a feeling that the U.K. mix/match trial showed Novavax immune response on a third dose was possibly too strong. Hence the retraction of their commitment for boosting the P3 participants, and the testing of a half dose antigen in the followup mix/match trial. Don’t really know anything personally, just trying to connect the dots. However I’m feeling sorry now for those who took Pfizer in early 2021 as now is probably the worst time to be unprotected."

"Someone from yesterday HC wainwright conference pointed out that WHO will keep talking about supply issues so that they can keep blaming rich countries for very low rates of vaccinations in low income countries. But the issue infact is also caused by distribution network which WHO is responsible for. Take Polio for example, it took decades after the invention of polio vaccine to fully eradicate the virus of earth because they couldn't deliver the vaccine to remote places in low income countries. And WHO still doesn't have the network to distribute rna vaccines. Novavax vaccine will be their ticket out."

"Some things that are getting buried by the flood of people who have all this figured out.1. Prior to Covid-19 the fastest a vaccine had been developed and brought to the commercial market by any company anywhere was over 4 years.2. In early to mid 2020 it was reported that there were around 120 companies worldwide (and we know that didn't include all the efforts in countries like Russia and China to name a couple) that were attempting to develop and produce a covid vaccine. The fact that we now have a handful is a testament to the amount of money, intellectual capital and driving force that was behind this effort. But that also means that a hundred plus others haven't gotten over the finish line and most likely never will.3. Making the best vaccine in the world given all that pressure and money being thrown at the problem, is hard enough, but to do it coming from a nearly bankrupt beginning with no manufacturing at all is even more challenging.4. With all those other companies trying to make vaccines, raw materials and very specialized manufacturing equipment and the people to run them and certify them were in short supply. I don't know about you all, but I haven't listened to any financial news where supply chain wasn't an issue and it is certainly an issue in the company I work for and we don't have anything to do with a brand new product designed from scratch to treat a newly emergent threat to global humanity.5. Many say ""they should have partnered with a big pharma company"". Let's not forget that: A. PFE (big pharma) has already stated publicly that they now through this joint effort with BNTX have learned from their collaboration with BNTX how to make an mRNA vax and will start development of their own. B. JNJ (Big Pharma) had to dump a million doses because of quality issues at a production plant. C. Even the vaunted MRNA who wasn't big pharma but based on market cap kind of now is, has had a few quality issue (a hell of a lot more than a few if you listen to the news from Japan). D. Its true that others finished faster and if you look at it truthfully they didn't have to achieve the quality levels that NVAX is now having too, because CMC is harder now because the others messed up and FDA got egg on their face and cracked down. So part of the delay is that the goal line has moved.6. If you don't have vaccine proven yet and the manufacturing set up yet and then don't have supply chain then you can't start doing CMC. So the idea that they've not been able to get CMC done in ""all this time"" fails to look at the process objectively.7. When they get these issues worked out and get approval they will have gone from death's door to a significant player with a pretty impressive pipeline of new and emerging products in record time. Yes there are pitfalls and some mine fields that tripped the plan and then company up, but you can't just google how to make a world class leading vaccine, stop by walmart and pick up some vaccine supplies and equipment, call kelly services and have them send over some highly technically trained vaccine support staff and some assay lab techs and spit out a vaccine when you get home.IF you could do that we'd have no pandemic and 100s of vaccines. I'm sure many will hate on me for this post, but they aren't on their computer ordering their Ronco Vaxamatic production and qualification facility so they can do that. Do I wish they had EUA's done and SP well into $1XXX. Yes I planned to have retired already too, but I'm not giving up on that dream just yet. Am I feeling the roller coaster of emotions and seeing my financial life flash in front of my eyes more times than I care too recently, yes. I'm not naive, and I do get POed but try to step back and objectively analyze stuff before I jump off the cliff."
Who was talking about novavax trials in UK being cancelled? They just expanded mix and match trials to younger ages (12-15) lol. Just found in Reuters.
"The year-to-date chart of this company has never been negative (red) since January 2020. Most of the companies on NASDAQ or the SP 500 haven't achieved this remarkable advancement. This means that, despite the huge swings, the price slowly but steadily keeps going up. Check out the 5 year chart to see it visually. There is no guarantee that this pattern will go on forever but given the many upcoming catalysts this year it is quite possible that the year-to-date chart will be green for all of 2021 and probably 2022. The most challenging month is going to be February 2022 since the price has to be > 331$ in order for the year-to-date chart to stay positive. I personally believe it will be a piece of cake to do so, given the fact that the vaccine will have been approved much earlier than February."

I received email from my NVAX trial center in California this morning. We are eligible for booster shots. They have filed amendment to the FDA to approve this.
"Based on sell-side earnings projections of $32.30 per share in 2022, NVAX shares currently trade at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 7.25 times. Why so low? Well, unlike Moderna, 2021 has not been the year that Novavax gets to “cash the check.” That moment still hasn’t happened yet — and there’s some uncertainty as to whether or not it will.However, this uncertainty also means opportunity. All the company needs to do is meet expectations. If it can do that, NVAX stock could more than double from its closing price of roughly $234 on Sept. 13. So, what makes me think it can near $500?Given that it’s still unclear as to whether vaccine sales will be a one-and-done event, investors remain cautious when it comes to their valuations. For example, MRNA trades for around 14.2 times estimated 2021 earnings.This current valuation gives us an idea of how the market will value Novavax once its “cash the check” moment happens. Multiply this company’s estimated earnings for next year by Moderna’s current multiple and what do you get? Around $460 per share."
"So here's my take on Novavax strategy, in short steps. Since this is discussed often.︎Emerging coronavirus epidemic︎NVAX starts research︎when approach thought out, starts R&D incl. Trials︎confirmation of product quality︎realisation Corona's here to stay︎development of business plan. Aim: becoming a durable, global major vaccine developer and manufacturer︎implementation of business strategy (current; well under way)︎product(s) to market, incl approvals︎Status now: almost on finish line. That is also the new starting point for the new Novavax-"

"They are specifically looking at Novavax as a lesser risk for heart inflammation and the results of the adult study are due “very shortly.”“The trial will give all participants a first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. That will be followed eight weeks later by either a second full dose or a half dose of the Pfizer shot, a full dose of Novavax's vaccine (NVAX.O) or a half dose of Moderna's shot (MRNA.O).The trial is recruiting 360 volunteers, not large enough to directly assess the myocarditis risk of the different combinations, which Snape said was 1 in 15,000 after two doses of the Pfizer shot in young men.But, he added, it ""would be reassuring to see if there was a lower inflammatory response after one of these changes compared to Pfizer (followed by) Pfizer,"" and that it might be ""reasonable to infer that the risks of myocarditis might be lower"" in such an instance.Snape is running another arm of the trial in adults, giving mixed vaccine schedules both four and 12 weeks apart, and comparing the responses. He said the results of that would be coming ""very shortly"".”"

We should file for FDA before Mid OCT IMO. Thats 20 trading days from now.
"Per the latest PR, toward the end of it, it states that the results of the mix and match study are due to be released in the coming weeks."
"Things I gathered from today’s zoom meeting.1. Consensus that Covid will be with us for minimum of at least 2-5 more years. Possibly forever.2. Things won’t get better globally until we reach everyone, including the poorest of countries.3. It will be hard to get this under control always chasing the newest strain. We need something that can protect against multiple variants simultaneously, including all variations of the delta lineage.4. Possibly oversupply issue within a year. Except we know boosters will be required and much of the supply being considered come from companies producing inferior vaccines.There’s at least one company that I can think of who can solve all the issues. NVAX"
"Tokyo-based Takeda Pharmaceutical announced that the company plans to grow its vaccines business. CEO Christophe Weber discussed this today in an interview at Reuters Events’ Pharma Japan 2021 conference.In addition to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the company has a license to manufacture Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine, which is still being evaluated in clinical trials. The Japanese government had entered a contract to acquire another 50 million Moderna doses to be delivered in 2022, as well as 150 million Novavax doses.The Novavax vaccine, TAK-019, is known outside Japan as NVX-CoV2373. As part of an earlier announcement, Takeda is developing manufacturing capabilities for TAK-109 in Japan with a goal of being distributed in early 2022. The licensing deal allows Takeda to manufacture the vaccine antigen, and Novavax is supplying the Matrix-M adjuvant to Takeda that is used in the vaccine. Takeda will handle Japanese clinical trial and regulatory submission to the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) and distribute TAK-019 in Japan if it is approved by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW)."
As you all know early last week Novavax share were doing very well following some positive news but following the notice that EUA in India is going to be delayed led to the decline in share price on Thursday and Friday from ~$270 to $233. I understand that the delay is due to India asking for clinical trial data from NVX-CoV2373 (Covovax) which was carried out in India. Novavax has great products but unfortunately the management do not seem to have an handle on how to obtain EUA. All the companies that successfully obtained EUA in different countries done so only a few weeks after the trial data were available. These companies had prior discussion with the appropriate regulatory authorities and I believe they guided them to submit the data/documentation required for successful EUA. Is anyone familiar with Novavax procedure for submission for EUA? I feel that they just submit what they have without sufficient discussion/understanding of what the regulatory authority is looking for. Otherwise why would India ask for a second set of data from another independent trial? Why did Novavax submit the data from international trials when the regulatory authority in India really need the data from Covovax trial? I invested heavily in Novavax which is a great product and has other great products in the pipeline but I worry that mismanagement of EUA submission leading to one delay after another in damaging to investors’ confidence and the company’s ability to generate large revenues.
"In sum, public health folks know we need a vaccine for kids, and this is important for schools staying open. And…they aren’t thrilled with the moderately higher side effect profile for second mRNA shots, especially in teen boys. Okay. So … they have opted for giving just one PFE shot now (still gives 50% protection and lower side effect profile.) BUT they want something better for complete vaccination. Hence the trial. Hoping that Novavax will provide the same or better protection, with a superior side effect profile. Whew! So trials are good and necessary. Everyone had to be meticulous and careful, especially when kid health is at the forefront."
"**** From NVAX’s Morgan Stanley Conf Sept 10/21***Sept 10 (Reuters) - Vaccine developer Novavax Inc said on Friday at least 2 billion doses of its COVID-19 vaccine would be available in 2022. The company, which in June announced its vaccine was more than 90% effective in a late-stage U.S.-based clinical trial, said it was on track to file an application for emergency use of its vaccine to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in the fourth quarter. Novavax, speaking at a Morgan Stanley healthcare conference, reiterated that it would have about 100 million doses per month by the end of the third quarter this year, and would increase it to 150 million doses in the fourth quarter.""We're already engaging in conversations about incremental procurement for the second half of 2022, as well as early 2023, especially given current vaccination rates around the globe,"" said John Trizzino, chief commercial officer at Novavax, adding that the booster strategy would create additional demand for its vaccines. In recent months, Novavax has entered several supply deals globally for its protein-based vaccine, including an agreement with the European Commission for 200 million doses.**************Clearly the booster market is what the company is currently focusing on given the disappointing, rapidly waning efficacy of the current mRNA vaccines. Go NVAX! GLTAL!"
"Moderna enjoys a $169 billion market cap, and BioNTech sports a $79 billion valuation. Meanwhile, Novavax is positively cheap with its $17 billion market cap.when the government agencies start allowing Novavax to distribute its COVID-19 vaccine, the stock will really start to soar.the ride will happen very soon... in 2nd half od September with the fisrt aprove.we will it $500 in the end of September and $1000 in the end of the year with the government agencies from all over the world start allowing Novavax to distribution.we will win longers.longers give me your like!"
"Link/reference in comments""The reason such an amazing opportunity exists for investors is Novavax's multiple delays in filing for emergency use authorization (EUA). Though it's probably missed out on some low-hanging fruit, so to speak, the opportunity to be a difference-maker in developed markets and globally still remains. The company's U.S. EUA filing should be in the fourth quarter, with sales expected to skyrocket in the coming years.Equally exciting is Novavax's early stage work on a combination COVID-19/influenza vaccine. While it's not the only company working on a combination vaccine -- Moderna recently announced it's working on a combo shot, too -- it does have the ability to beat most, if not all, of its competitors to market with a combination treatment. With Novavax, we could be witnessing the birth of a true innovator in the biotech space."""
Don't make the mistake of selling on the Pfizer news. NVAX had the MOST efficacious and the FDA is flying by the seat of thier pants. NVAX will be the Only company giving Seasonal Flu injections. Hold and be rewarded!
"The stock could benefit from a short squeeze as well. The 6.08 million shares sold short make up 8.2% of the stock's available float, and would take 1.17 days to cover at NVAX's average daily pace of trading."
Give people a protein vaccine!!!
"I think it is inevitable that NVAX will get approved because it is the cheapest and most effective vaccine. High income governments will prefer to purchase this vaccine for use in lower income countries that cannot pay for themselves and COVAX doesn't have the committment it needs to vaccinate the world properly.High income countries purchasing NVAX for $16-$20 per dose is a ton of cash for NVAX, higher than what LIC would pay, and lower than what HIC would pay if purchasing BNTX or MRNA.$15B 2022 revenue. BOOK IT."
"Today should of been an amazing day for NVAX. The news at the conference is the best news we have heard since EUA filings. However, the WHO and the disgruntled ex-FDA employees who were most likely told to resign, did a hit job to support the WHO agenda. Even the CEO of Pfizer, said boosters are required. The WHO and ex-FDA are completely outside their swim line. They are completely inappropriate. Let’s hope the PPS recovers tomorrow and October is our month for a new ATH."
Booster for mRNA = NO Booster with Novavax = YES
"The best news for NVAX is the FDA delays boosters shots for everyone.That gives NVAX a shot at boosters when it will be approved....probably in Dec or Jan.Making it even more likely the US goes ahead with it's conditional order for 600M more NVAX doses (who won't want the best vaccine booster shot if it's available?). The FDA is playing into the hands of the WHO (the world should all get their first shot before the US gets their 3 rd shot) but spinning it (those unvaccinated in the world are causing mutations so giving the world their first shot will save US lives) so it's doesn't appear to be a World first US last thing.Of course, that's a bogus argument as current vaccines wane rapidly and you can't vaccinated the entire planet in the few short months they are effective against spreading and mutating COVID."
"Finally had time to listen to the morgan Stanley presentation. Much much better than Citibank with their poor moderation. Analysis:1. Really liked Flip Dubovsky. Straight shooting scientist. Gives me baseline reassurance that this is a powerful vaccine product and is needed. Greatly reassuring. This will be a better, more versatile, and more long lived immune response relative to MRNA and adenovirus products, and far superior to whole cell vaccines from China and Russia. Hence my abiding interest in Novavax.2. John Trizzino is a player, tasked with putting a spin in their newest delay. He is stating “many” applications in “a couple of months”. This is late, and also not what Stan said a month ago. 3. No clarity on what the holdup actually is. This is the most concerning part. What it isn’t: they have supplies. Have capacity. This is not a grand conspiracy. Fundamentally it is probabaly a challenge with manufacturing consistency. 4. 100mn doses by end September. Better do this. Nice to hear as was absent from citi presentation. 5. Contracts still in process but reassuring. 6. Sorry they aren’t submitting any delta variant info to FDA. They could, but aren’t. Are relying on their ace2 studies, which are reassuring. mRNA hasn’t done so either, but still.7. No info in pediatric results. This is really important and hope they address this ASAP. 8. Avoided any result or indication on UL mix and match studies, though tone fro Flip was reassuring here. I’m still a fan of this vaccine. Hope they get organized snd turn in their homework."
"As my bud Derrick said, PROUD believer here (or pumper if pleases bashers).Although Stan and management don't bother to read Yahoo's forum, or take any advice from PROUD believers ""pumpers"" in this forum. I posted the following (below) last week, and I still think it would be a great strategy if they would consider. FYI - I haven't changed the prices to today's trading. the prices reflect when I posted it, but you will get the point.What a 1:6 share split would do for NovavaxNovavax has not announced any intention to do a share split at this stage. This is an evaluation of the advantages should they make such a strategic move.Novavax has 74mil shares in issue, while Moderna has 401mil shares in issue for a ratio of 5.4 Moderna shares for every Novavax share. Optics is a fact of life. It's not always rational nor logical, but it is very real. The optics here is that a Novavax share price of $242 “looks” expensive compared to a Moderna share price of $450, yes optics. The reality is that a $242 Novavax share price in comparative shares in issue numbers is only $45 relative to the Moderna share price. Again, optics, the excessive share price discount is patently obvious at $45. Novavax would do well to do a share split of 1:6 earlier rather than later to rebalance the shares in issue relationship for a more realistic reflection of the relative price relationship between Novavax and Moderna.A six for one share split would take a $242 Novavax share price back to $45, and then, all naïve market and the not so naïve market participants would see how the Novavax share price is trading at a very attractive discount to competitors in the face of significant progress and competitive standing at this stage.Let me suggest that the Novavax share price should be trading in the $400 to $450 range, Split the Novavax share six for one, and let's suggest that the share should be trading in the $67 to $70 range, and it sounds a lot more reasonable. Let's go one step further and suggest that the Novavax share price should be trading in the $540 to $600 range to be on par with the share price of Moderna in the pre-EUA application phase, and again, investors will balk at that suggestion but split the stock six for one, and a trading range of $90 to $100 is totally in line with where Moderna was trading prior to submitting EUA, and on top of it, Moderna did not have its Phase 3 trial data in hand at that stage.Everybody has a risk profile, but the $45 Novavax share price vs. a $450 Moderna share price based on the same number of shares, the trading ranges of BioNTech and Moderna in the after Phase 3 trial data and pre EUA applications stage and given currently available information, certainly ranks with the best risk/reward opportunities in the market presently."
"Ok serious question for any long who hasn't muted me:Did Trizzino give any color yesterday morning as to what is the reason they cannot immediately file for EUA in the U.K.? If in fact all the problems are solved, why is the EUA not going in now?Serious question because if there were a glimmer of hope that that was imminent and not ""couple of months"" I would be happy to invest again. Not nearly as many shares, to be sure, but seriously."
"[Motley Fool] Is Novavax a Buy?Once Novavax launches its vaccine candidate, it may generate billions of dollars in revenue -- just like Moderna and BioNTech.In fact, in its first-quarter earnings call, Novavax predicted that would happen in the coming four to six quarters. Is this possible? If regulatory agencies give the nod, absolutely -- although at this point, I would expect revenue to roll in during the latter part of that forecast period. And, as mentioned above, Novavax's potential extends beyond these early days of vaccination. An eventual combined flu/coronavirus vaccine could ensure billions in revenue in the future.Right now is a great time to buy Novavax shares, especially if you're a long-term investor. Many catalysts lie ahead. And if all goes smoothly for Novavax's potential products, investors are likely to reap the rewards in the years to come."
"My interpretation of the recent PR - we’re not going to take out the other vaccines, we’re going to see if we can save them from going bankrupt by trialing them with ours to confirm their vaccines will work with ours. This is due to the fact we can only supply 2 billion doses a year this we need the others but want to prove our vaccine enhances the existing vaccines to be more robust and effective - Novavax. This was my interpretation lol :)….."
"We’re now going on 10 months with no significant progress after UK PH3. If there aren’t approvals and shots in arms before November, you’d have to start thinking countries will back out of their agreements and instead opt for Pfizer/Moderna. Pretty outrageous shareholder negligence on the part of management"
"The Lancet article also suggest there could be “bigger gains” from creating booster doses that better match circulating variants, much like flu vaccine is regularly updated, than from just giving extra doses of the original vaccine.“There is an opportunity now to study variant-based boosters before there is widespread need for them,” the scientists wrote. The above in particular is likely to augur well for Novovax as it’s platform has the ability to easily mix multiple variant specific antigens with the same adjuvant creating a Bi or Tri Or even a Polyvalent vaccine combined with Nanoflu. It is my personal view that they can successfully reduce the dosage of the spike protein even further to 2.5 mcg (half the current dose) especially If they are going Polyvalent. Cov-Boost mix and match trial will provide a proof of concept for such dose sparing formulation."
"NanoFlu could become a key differentiator for Novavax in the future and has already demonstrated safety and efficacy. Add booster shots to the equation, and you have a mouth-watering value proposition with Novavax at the forefront.Its one-of-a-kind coronavirus vaccine is developed using traditional vaccine development methods, giving it the edge in safety and trust. Efficacy rates are staggering and are over 90% for high-risk populations."
“PREVENT 19” say that a few times. Not “probably/maybe/? deter one from death” like Pfizer. NOVAVAX literally put the promise in the NAME!!!That is a smoke signal from Novavax to its’ investors if I ever saw one. They put it in their name. This vaccine is going to act like what people know as a traditional vaccine and stop you from being infected. No other vaccine can claim that - not one. Who will want to take Pfizer or Moderna once the superior preventative vaccine that is NOVAVAX becomes available. Literally no one. This is going to up end the WORLD.
Folks lots of misinformation being spread on the financial social media boards today. Tomorrow is quad witching and obvious there is a large position being defended going into expiration likely with a need to hold this south of $240. Watch your shares and IMHO stay away from stop losses as they will look to trigger them in order to accumulate.
"Mirror revealed some more results from Cov-Boost: Over-80s and care home residents could get Covid boosters from next month after data showed they give antibodies a seven-fold boost. Figures show a top-up Pfizer dose around three months after a second jab of AstraZeneca or Pfizer greatly boosts immune responses but millions of other older people will have to wait.They may not report results other than AZ and Pfizer next week; but we know that the peak antibodies produced from Novavax is over 10 times higher than that of Pfizer. The their dose of Novavax boost antibodies 8 fold over the peak; therefore, even after the third dose, the total antibodies would still lower than the peak level produced after the second dose of the Novavaix vaccine.See Mirror article: Covid booster jabs for elderly in weeks as data shows seven-fold antibody boost"
"Some not so good news. UK application is now confirmed as delayed as is being told to some trial participants. Now likely to be submitted with EMA, probably in October. Authorization is expected towards the end of the year. See below. Also, lack of booster follow on support is worrying:https://twitter.com/londonboyjohn/status/1438189581766103040?s=19"
"And another reply from a different forum:The consensus on investor village is that it’s fake news. Looks like somebody who is short trying to shake out weak hands. They think it’s fake news because it’s inconsistent with what Trizz said on the conference call. Also, that this would be considered a material event that they would’ve had to disclose."

CNBC actually listed Novavax on their Vaccines and Therapeutics daily stock chart.
Here’s my take on the FDA vote:1. The FDA had to balance the limited protection a booster dose would provide to population weighing the high possibility that a blanket recommendation for all to add a 3rd dose could potentially exert a pressure on Delta to mutate and drift even further away from original Wuhuan vaccine rendering completely ineffective and…2. Using a 3rd dose now from a less effective vaccine (ie mRNA) would then prevent the entire previously vaccinated population from getting the Best Booster which we now can rightly know FDA has already seen or at minimum has COV-Boost pre release data. Showing 2373 as best in show.The FDA would lose all credibility if they pushed 3rd mRNA on people and then boost data showed otherwise.Look for coordination of stockpiling and concerted effort for US gov to announce boost initiative with 2373. In the interim cover your high risk groups by boosting with mRNA
"Both MRNA and BNTX are having big old party today on the news of booster. We haven't even started the party yet booster or not. Wait til we get our first EUA and/or filling, we're gonna have a long sustainable party for a while."
Forget that I had the Moderna booster this week. I didn't have a choice since they are not entertaining mix and match at this point. The critical issue for us longs is that boosters are already being administered and will scale which is outstanding for us NVAX longs. Our addressed market opportunity is not going to evaporate as many of the shorts argue. There is still a ton of growth opportunity for us!!!!
"The booster discussion is whether we should offer a booster dose NOW. Risk benefit trade off meets threshold for older people, since younger people still getting good protection from hospitalization and vaccine given more recently. If novavax turns out to be effective in the cov-boost2 and 3 trials, with lower side effect profile, this calculus will completely change."
"Singapore has one of the world's highest vaccination rates at over 83% of the population fully vaccinated using Mostly BNTX.. however read this !! even the Pfizer Asia Pacific facilities have a covid cluster !!Singapore registered 1,009 new Covid-19 cases on Sept 18Of them, 1,004 were locally transmitted and five were importedPharmaceutical firm Pfizer Asia Pacific and waste-management company NSL OilChem were added to a list of active clusters being tracked There has been an uptick in patients with serious illness and under intensive care, compared with Sept 17"
"""The Taipei City Government recently set a budget of 2.8 billion to purchase 2 million to 2.5 million doses of vaccines. Taipei Mayor Ke Wenzhe was asked this afternoon which brand he would buy?

"From The Guardian: ""The JCVI recommended that all over-50s, frontline health and social care workers, and at-risk groups receive a booster of the Pfizer jab regardless of the vaccine they received first time around, to be given at least six months after their second dose. While the advisers stated a preference for the Pfizer shot, an alternative is a half dose of the Moderna vaccine – the amount Moderna is proposing for boosters in its applications to European and US regulators.""The hope for Moderna to take market away from Pfizer was a much better efficacy with a comparable safety profile at 50mcg. The above might mean that the data showed the half-dose Moderna shot was not much better than Pfizer in terms of raising Nabs titer. Hope Cov-Boost will release the full data soon so that we'll know how the full-dose and half-dose Novavax worked. Valneva is now out but it probably did not do much of anything anyway."
"I have not posted for a few days to wait for people to calm down from the recent hysteria. Investing in a pre-approval biotech is always an exciting roller coaster ride. But, the goal should be always at least an EUA/BLA approval, not on some particular dates. And, approval is 90% science and 10% manufacturing.The big picture here is that the science is great. Emerging data is showing that Cov2373 is cross reactive to a variety of variants of interest/concern, in particular, showing great immune responses against the important ones, Alpha, Beta and Delta. Great efficacy was shown in two major phase-3 RCTs and another phase-2 RCT. Nothing else comes close, and this includes the mRNA vaccines. So, the science part should be considered done.A variety of problems have plagued manufacturing to delay approval for several months. But, these engineering problems are always solved. The fact that the EU and Japan governments have signed contract to order hundreds of millions doses of the vaccine means that their regulatory agencies have seen data and believed that CMC is fine.The rapid succession of the Alpha, Beta and Delta variants says that this virus is going to be with us for a long time. Cov2373 is durable against a wide variety of mutations and can be administered to as many people as possible anywhere in the world as a primary or as a booster vaccine. The market for Cov2373 will dwarf what other vaccines have been used for.Once the hurdle of approval for Cov2373 is passed, NVAX will become a major vaccine pharma with its Matrix-M adjuvant and recombinant protein platform and a robust pipeline. That's worth waiting for."
Is tomorrow or Thursday the news on any EUA submissions or approvals 6 weeks since submissions to India Indonesia and Philippines Delta variant raging in all 3 countries So puzzling. GLAL
"Ok some serious talk...-Working out the testing and cmc timelines, if my company was doing it and working 16 hours days/7 days a week.-1 week to perform testing. This includes lab work, entering results in LIMS, review and issuing a CoA.-3 weeks for updating the CMC module. This includes source document generation, revision, second person review, publishing, and submission to the HA’s.-So, that is a total of 4 months. -Would expect CMC Submission to occur by Oct 15th.-Since everything is in a rolling review, all other modules should of already been reviewed. Therefore, let’s give it 3 weeks for the HA to complete their review, which includes any response to questions. HA may have questions, NVAX and/or SII will need to respond to the questions.-At the Nov EC, NVAX will most likely come in saying all submissions have been completed and here are our authorizations/approvals. PRs may come before, but who knows.-Still convinced the Third world markets are waiting for a western approval (most likely MHRA), because the module 5-Clinical, is too complex for them and/or they don’t want the liability.So what does this mean for NVAX PPS...I expect a PPS yo-yo, until the run-up right before the Nov EC. Most likely news will be leaked, which will cause the run-up. At this point it is clear the only way we get to an ATH is with an authorization(s)/approval(s). What does that mean for me...I am going into Zen mode-spending time with my family, focusing on training for distances races and ocrs, hiking, reading and dinners.What does that mean for you...As much as I enjoy the antics on this board, how often do you get to act like a 12 year old, posting ridiculous things...I will be taking a break from posting until closer to the Nov EC. I will read the top reaction posts morning and evening just to stay informed, but will not comment. Rationale: The risk on missing out on something critical is low, if my timelines hold true. Not selling until min of 350-400, I will hold until next year (April 2022) if needed.Go NVAX...but a big F to Stan and the NVAX BoD."
FDA advisory committee on boosters is meeting this Friday to discuss Pfizer booster plan. It will likely take a middle ground and delay the rollout of boosters for healthy adults till December. It will actually benefit NVAX as it will likely be included in the program to starJanuary. PFE and Moderna will get a nice haircut (10-15%).

"""Although the country has signed a number of contracts with the government for 2022, the company will face increasingly fierce competition in the next few years, including competitors from Novavax that later enter the market.""https://businesspress.in/pfizer-and-moderna-investors-worry-that-vaccine-sales-will-eventually-fall/"
"3pm - The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is the remaining jab among the Government's pre-purchase agreements that is under review by Medsafe, with doses expected to arrive early next year.The Science Media Centre asked experts to comment on how the Novavax vaccine works and its safety profile.Here's what Dr Fran Priddy, executive director of Vaccine Alliance Aotearoa New Zealand - Ohu Kaupare Huaketo, said.How does the Novavax vaccine work? How is it different from the other three New Zealand-approved vaccines?The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine (NVX-CoV2372) is a protein-based vaccine. Protein-based vaccines have a good safety and efficacy track record and are used in adults and children to prevent diseases such as hepatitis B, pertussis, influenza, pneumococcal illness and meningitis.They are typically given together with an adjuvant to boost the immune response and ensure both humoral (antibody) and cellular (T cells) responses. The Novavax vaccine is made from multiple copies of the SARS CoV-2 spike protein, formed into tiny particles (nanoparticles) and then mixed together with an adjuvant derived from tree bark.It is given as an intramuscular jab like other COVID-19 vaccines, with two doses given three weeks apart. After injection, the nanoparticles are taken up antigen presenting cells, which then display the spike proteins on their surface and stimulate the immune system to make antibodies and cellular responses.What do the data show so far about its effectiveness and safety?The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine had a good safety profile and was 90 percent effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease and 100 per cent protective against hospitalisation and death in large clinical trials in the UK, US and Mexico. These trials were conducted prior to widespread prevalence of the Delta variant.There is no data on efficacy against the Delta variant yet, but lab testing showed that vaccinees have immune responses that also neutralise the Delta variant. In a study of people vaccinated with the Novavax as their primary series and then boosted with a third dose 6 months later, neutralizing responses to the Delta variant increased more than four-fold.What is known about its potential use as a booster to the Pfizer vaccine?There are two studies ongoing in the UK looking at several different regimens, including using Novavax with the Pfizer vaccine.One study includes an evaluation of people who received one dose of Pfizer vaccine and a second dose with the Novavax vaccine as their primary series.The second study is evaluating people who received both doses of Pfizer vaccine as their primary series and then a booster with Novavax full dose, or Novavax at half-dose. Both studies are evaluating safety and immune responses, and the data is expected in the very near future."
"I keep going back to valuation. Naysayers say yeah but no EUAs, no WHO, MHRA filings etc... But we all know it's coming, as Trizzino said within couple of months. Let's review, NVAX market cap is now 1/10th that of MRNA. 2 billion to be produced, 2 billion already sold for 2022. $20+ billion revenue expected in 2022, SP currently sitting at less that 1 X projected sales. MRNA SP selling 11 X projected sales 2022. NVAX at 5 X 2022 revenue will put us at $1161.50. Just goes to show what kind of runway we have in front of us. I know we need approval but for that kind of reward, I am willing to stick it out. I had to painfully trim some last week because of way too much for me make me nervous and dictate my daily emotions. That told me it was out of my comfort zone. Just like everyone, it got that big by averaging down. Anyway I think end/new beginning is near. Just hang in there longs!!"
"I am not pumping! But, based on the conference, we understand more about the delays… the efficacy of this product is unreal.. if big pharma is blocking this it’s no wonder! Nvax seems to have the solution to this 2 year problem! This comment is based on the results! Not just me “hoping” this vaccine is better than it gets, on all variants and all fronts! And that’s data! Not opinion!"
"Polish company Mabion is ready to produce NOVAVAX antigen.Translator:“All the preparatory works that were planned and so far possible to carry out have been completed. We have strong confirmation that our facility can produce the vaccine antigen on a commercial scale. The technology transfer required a huge mobilization and dedication from the entire Mabion team, so we are proud that we completed the preparation for production process in a short time and we are very pleased with the parameters of the produced antigen ""- said Kaczmarczyk, quoted in the release.As he added, if a commercial production contract is signed, it will be able to take place in two bioreactors currently owned by Mabion in order to use the currently available, full production capacity of the plant. The next steps may be based on the powers extended by further bioreactors.“The company completed the analysis of Novavax's process and analytical documentation and prepared the quality system for the implementation of the new process and analytics. Further completed activities include the increase in the scale of the process of cell culture in bioreactors on a commercial scale, as well as the implementation of the process twice, planned under the contract. After these actions, the product was successfully cleaned and analyzed in accordance with the procedures and requirements of Novavax, also included in the previous transfer works. The results of the analyzes indicate that the company obtained the desired high-quality product, ”reads the release.Source: https://inwestycje.pl/biznes/zaklad-mabionu-gotowy-do-rozpoczecia-komercyjnej-produkcji-antygenu-dla-novavax/"
Lol I maybe the only one here holding here! down 50k BUT I’m absolutely confident that I’ll recover! Whole sector is getting hit badly today! I’m not as lucky as Gail who said she was a “Long” but sold all her shares at $270 last week! Go longs; stay positive and be confident that we’ll get back to $270 and much more! Very soon!
"The elephant in the room is that 8k containing a 71-page slide deck submitted to the SEC as a material disclosure (the point of an 8K). Upvote, downvote, I don't care. However, there is no arguing that the slide deck was submitted as a disclosure. As investors, we should focus on fully understanding this material update, particularly with more conferences scheduled in the coming days per recent PRs that could highlight something significant.Whether you consider it a delay or not, the ""couple of months"" was burried in 13 characters on this slide deck ""2H"" (page 52) and ""by end of 2021"" (page 68). Management waited for the citi conference call to elaborate on this topic when John stated they are not comfortable pinning down a date on a calendar and feel more comfortable with guiding as ""a couple of months"". I'm not bashing, I'm long and have been for some time. I just want to fully understand this update and if there are any more disclosures in the slides. I've been through those slides at least 4 times now. I listened to every second of the the citi conference call yesterday. The only other deviations from the Q2 earnings call that I've noted are:A) ""expect to submit for EUA to FDA"" (slide 52), which to me puts to bed the notion of filing BLA/full approval that Blue has been discussing for some time. Note that ""expect"" is a term covered by the Safe Harbor Statement.B) the order of submissions also appears to be provided on slide 52, but the footnote ""**list of regulatory filings not in chronological order"" provides an out for management to adjust this order along with the Safe Harbor Statement.C) combo flu+c19 product launch (slide 55), which I believe is a goal of all c19 vax manufacturers and NVAX is clearly a front runner. This was also discussed proudly by Dr. Glen in the citi conference. I do enjoy it when he speaks.D) trials planned for new B.1.351 variant-specific strain vaccine in fall 2021 (slide 57). This topic was also confirmed in the 9/9 citi conference by Dr. Glen.E) vaccine pipeline (slide 70) indicates there are no products in the ""marketed"" phase, which in my mind puts to bed the notion that Indonesia has secured any doses as of the 9/9 filing date with the SEC.During the citi conference, Dr. Glen also talked proudly about plans for improving the efficacy of existing vaccine products. I cannot find a slide in the slide deck on this topic, but I admit the science is likely over my head. I would greatly appreciate any other insights into changes in the 8K vs. previous disclosures. The slides are available on novavax's website under For Investors > SEC Filings, issued Sept 9, 2021. There could be more discrete disclosures planned for discussion at these upcoming conference call presentations. They must have been scheduled for a purpose."
"Another one out: “The approval of the Russian Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine at the World Health Organization (WHO) has been suspended until a new inspection of the manufacturing plant. This was announced to reporters on Wednesday, September 15, by the deputy head of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Dr. Jarbas Barbosa.”"

"Unfortunately this is getting closer and closer to my ""pull the plug"" price. I'll be sad if it gets to that. I made a big mistake by loading up a bunch last week at $258 thinking that was the bottom. I'm crossing my fingers we don't go down much more."
"So far the votes for boosting are 2 yes and 16 no. I completely agree with this.My understanding of the science says that the fundamental issue here is that the mRNA vaccines may not have durability against the ancestral Wuhan virus, and worse, may not even be able to deal with infections by new variants. So, boosting using the same weak vaccine is not going to change that equation.There is one vaccine that has proven to be effective against a variety of variants in a clinical trial setting and that is Cov2373. Further, in testing, boosting at six months caused the immune system to mature to the point that neutralization against all recent or current major variants, Alpha, Beta and Delta, happened at the same high level.So, going forward, the best way to stop this pandemic is to get Cov2373 into people's arms as soon as possible. I hope that the policy makers will take the advisory committee comments today into consideration and get serious about helping to get Cov2373 deployed. It's time to move the resources dedicated to making mRNA vaccines into making Cov2373."

Wow. Article publicly states that Novavax provides sterilizing immunity and will PREVENT further infection. Headline: “Second-generation vaccines seek to prevent coronavirus infectionPreventing coronavirus infection and thus stopping its transmission is the goal of second-generation vaccines against covid-19.” Link in comments.

"Scott Gottlieb ""Novavax will enter the market."""
"Covax has also warned that it would not be able to vaccinate as much of the world as it wants because wealthy countries bought much of the early supply, and because of obstacles such as “export bans” and “delays in filing for regulatory approval.”so USG needs to approve nvax and get moving !"
"Listen up carefully. Covid is not going away, just like the flu will never go away. You will always need a flu and covid shot each year. This is how we are going to live with this thing. Therefore, NVAX having a dual flu/covid vaccine will be worth hundreds or millions and the stock will easily be worth $1,000 a share. Holders don't panic. Instead buy on the dip."
Why all 3 major vaccine companies go down so much today ?Any commentsThanks
"Moderna Inc. has released a set of data which suggested its COVID-19 vaccine is effective in preventing serious health issues or death from ""variants of concern"" but admitting that efficacy decreases over time, such that those who received the vaccine last year were twice more likely to contract a breakthrough case of the coronavirus disease."
"This board has degenerated. There used to be many here who added thoughtful and factual insight. The majority now seem to cherry pick facts to suit them without understanding the full picture of pharmaceutical or business practices both domestically and internationally. The world is in a really bad state. Just go to the CDC travel advisory board to see for yourself. There isn’t one country that isn’t free from the statement “avoid unnecessary travel.” People on this board talk like there’s an infinite amount of vaccine to go around. The reality is vaccines are limited because less than a handful of companies currently make an approved vaccine. Owing that many countries have not begun to vaccinate, available booster shots in first world countries are going to be diverted to countries that need them so that mutation of the covid virus is slowed. Limited amounts of boosters (in first world countries) will be available, and they will be triaged for the immunocompromised and the front line workers. It’s going to be a shocker when access to boosters is denied to the remaining double vaccinated whose vaccine efficacy is waning. Therefore, everyone should hope (both short and long) that other vaccine companies in addition to BNTX, NRNA and AZN come on line soon. This includes companies like NVAX, plus many others that are working toward this goal."
"Multiple catalysts will make Novavax shares jump in 2021Taylor Carmichael (Novavax): Novavax stock has already doubled this year, running from $112 back in January to $233 this week. But there's plenty of gas left in the tank, and I expect another double by the end of the year.Right now, Moderna enjoys a $169 billion market cap, and BioNTech sports a $79 billion valuation. Meanwhile, Novavax is positively cheap with its $17 billion market cap. The difference, of course, is that the mRNA biotechs have both of their COVID-19 vaccines on the market now, while Novavax is still waiting for its first Emergency Use Authorization. But when the government agencies start allowing Novavax to distribute its COVID-19 vaccine, the stock will really start to soar.The majority of the world's population still has not been vaccinated. Novavax will have 2 billion doses of vaccine ready to distribute in 2022. And the biotech has multiple agreements for supplying locations around the world: 100 million doses for the U.S., 150 million doses for Japan, 200 million doses for Europe, and over 1 billion doses for the developing world. The U.S. paid $1.3 billion in advance to secure its 100 million doses of the company's experimental vaccine. That works out to $13 a dose. While the dollar amounts of the various purchase agreements are undisclosed, Japan and Europe will likely pay a higher dollar amount, while the developing world agreements will be discounted. It's entirely possible that Novavax's revenue next year will be higher than its market cap today.I'm expecting Novavax shares to spike higher as its vaccine starts receiving authorization around the world in the fourth quarter. Novavax's vaccine candidate will be popular both as a booster shot and as an initial vaccine for the majority of the world who are unvaccinated. And Novavax is leading in the race to combine the COVID-19 vaccine with a flu vaccine. The company just kicked off a combo trial in Australia involving 640 people who have been vaccinated against both diseases with a single shot."
"Novavax seems to set up their vaccine used globally for the next 5 years at the least. The combined flu-covid vaccine news was encouraging. A mix vaccination released today is a strong indicator that 2373 will expand potential market even further. You can see their future plans by looking at the trials. I think there are a lot bigger things beyond the EUA next month. To me this is a real, exciting investing."
The following is the fact. - Fujifilm NC plant in US : Stockpiling- Fujifilm Texas plant in US : ?- Fujifilm Teesside in UK : Stockpiling since April- Novavax Czech plant : Stockpiling- SK Bioscience in Korea : Stockpiling since April- Biofabri in Spain : Stockpiling- Mabion in Poland : Completed validation operation and starting commercial operation- Takeda in Japan : Completed validation operation and starting commercial operationThe delivery of 600m ~ 700m dose in Q4 of 2021 is really feasible reality as all stockpiled products will be delivered as soon as they win the approvals !!!!!!
I predict $750 in the near future.
