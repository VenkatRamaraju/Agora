Really...you are trading..and sitting here does not know why it up or down...then trading not your game...shzzzif you are trade and confuse or lost...something happenin..then...mostly you will lose your money...just my best honestly advice.
Very solid base here. Low volume but maintaining price level. Demand is out there but restrained as increased buying quickly drives up price.

Nice volume today
"Somethin' happenin' here, what it is ain't exactly clear....."
I'm out. It was great. Really great.
Any reason for today's 5% gain?
"Right or wrong, I'm out, at least for now. I may be wrong, but I don't like the stock price behavior and the time of year. I may be selling my winners early, but I'm okay with that. If we drop near $40, I may be back in. Just FYI, not that anyone cares. :)"
"$4 million in debt, inventory adding up by 4th quarter, sale of OEM product declined...god luck long...."
"I warned you guys already, this bad boys will continue head to $14, cash out your profit and buy when it dip, which currently market, not good do long term, trade war between China and US won't slow down unless bothside make deal."
Get ready for unload..by oct/24...good luck long.
"There's Better Trade, with advice over there,Tellin' me, I got to beware...The 5 day chart indicates to me that someone is optimistic about the next earnings report/conference call. My prediction 3rd and 4th quarters will beat the current street estimates."
Look to me workforce reduction coming near by..shzzz
"Base on research of the RMR Group, Piper Jaffray Companies, revenue reduced and EPS reduced to $0.07 of 2017 compare $0.89 ( down 92.13%) or $53.33 million compare to $66.24 million ( down 20%). I agreed and look to me Cybe need trim expense cost otherwise their cash will burn out faster than expected.Look to me price target will upgrade in next few weeks base on EPS and Revenue."

Goodbye $20 and hello $17 ...sweet...thanks all my team...
"Just saw this, maybe check my post from 2 months ago."
who ever bought at $16.05 yesterday really got burn...which currently market..not safe holding any stock...
Wednesday's CC may be the most important day in the history of CYBE.
Hmm...new 52 week high. Not bad.
"which currently market...US tariff China...one of them has to back down otherwise stock market will be feel the pain, the game not finish..my recommendation not holding any stock for long period right now, short and daytrade make huge money when US tariff China. Otherwise when the institutional owned many shares casue the stock won't be any big spike due to lack of big and ask..I just like empty shopping.As the same time volume the most enemy of Stock...less volume stock will move slow and less people interested."
revenue reduced compare with 2016 or previous years...that mean EPS also reduced..you guys know what to do...good luck...
"Due to the virus not stop spreading, it direct impact to China business and in coming weeks mostly US company will see their impact in the production, when will this virus over, it will take months and depend on what cause the virus.China has suspend a lot of order sent to US due the the virusAny company doing business with China will see the impacting for Q1 and Q2"

"Well, I added to my position yesterday when it suddenly took off thinking it might get bought out or something. I was wrong but I dont understand what drove it up so high on 4x the volume."
"Rule thumb for trading..Never and ever chasing stock no matter what, if bought high..sell higher.2nd..never and every holding thru the ER..even positive.3rd: Never and ever falling in one stock."
CYBE is down 5.38% to $20.33
"Pretty solid since earnings, despite the squishy market."
Corona. China hardly seeing additional cases. Death rate about the same. Did the lockdown work? Or is the virus much more prevalent and not nearly as terrible? And or some other thoughts....
CYBE reached a 52 Week high at 25.81
CYBE is up 13.77% to $19.00
Very good day for short...
"Tonight we learn more about the company's order flow. Do they predict $13M for 4Q and $50M for next year, or $20M for 4Q and $100M for 2017? Probably something in the middle."
lol...thought it better..but it does not looking solid in forecast..yeah...q2 revenue increase almost $2 million but q3 could declined 10%-15%...with expense increase almost $2 million wow...look to me operating income for Q3 will be negative...hahaha.time for short again tomorrow...
"Who ever chasing or bought $19.30 really really mess up...since ER out, not much going on until next ER...look to me heading back down $16.50. Good luck long...that why two rule I am holding with me. never chase or holding any stock for long period time...Just like Amazon..pump to $2000.."
Why is the comment section so quiet here? What do you guys think about the Earnings Report?
Hello $20. Again.
hmmm what going on..market up and this one Red...very very tricky.....
So if you are bought at $42...if go up $60 than profit $18...but which currently market covid19 and travel market mostly down than up..so will heading down $30 or lower than ..I guess not good investment unless it spike to $100..but not a change..
"Nice bounce back to a one month high at this point. Hmm, we might hit $17 before $10."
hmmm they are should correct the full time number of employee since workforce reduced?....look like they are tried hiding..
52 weeks low could be reach...caution
CyberOptics reached a 52 Week high at 36.40
Steady positive trade action.
See bettertrade post regarding earnings delay. Any idea where that information came from? That in combination with run up yesterday would be interesting. We will see if this sticks. CYBE has a way of running up and giving it right back.
"Outperforming it's sector by a wide margin, and great (relative) volume."
Yeah..chasing it and buy...few days or nextweek market crash and heading down $17....We are short winner again no matter what...
They are usually have $23 million cash in hand but now only $15 million left that mean $8 million burned in matter a year or two..as same time $4 million in debt I am surprise they are free debt last few years...what going on now?
"Let's see...they beat the street on revenue, they beat the street on earnings (even without the tax change), cash and market securities were up (even after share repurchase), they have 20 large sensor projects in the pipeline worth about $40mill (which they did not include in their guidance), KLA and Nordeen sales were up 100% last year and they expect faster combined growth in 2018. Yeah, it doesn't look good."
"oh boy..come on still dreaming $40 ps..really...first this stock has very low volume, that the most enemy of stock, just like shopping without customer, second, 65% owned by institutional, that mean it won't be any big spike unless purchase from them.Tariff with China,,,continue will high impact and could head to $13.00Next year still early and most importand has to wait how this holiday coming up, depend how consumer spending and any new technology.Good luck long...not good time do any investment..."
Too much promising but did not make it end up hopeless..sometime don't be lure into it...action more than talk...that the key...
Here we go..they just paid for Zack..posting Strong buy....
$21 by the conf call? Thoughts?
Very nice 3rd Qtr--Heading back up to $20
Caution everyone: I am not a basher but this stock way over value...the fair value should be $8.00-$9.00. You have been warned ahead. Don't be surprise why stock price will reduced $10 when correction time take place.You have been warned.I am not a basher..It is just not fair bought stock over value or someone pump it up.
I held thru the ER...
I am ready to short down $30.00 or lower good luck long...
Dougherty and Co. price target raised to $55.00
Bucking a weak trend in the sector today. There seems to be some optimism about the company's offerings.
CYBE is down -6.22% to 20.35
Today's drop was profit taking before tomorrow's earnings. I'm looking for a blowout number. I say $.40/ share and increased guidance. CYBE had many 2nd Q orders postponed to the 3rd quarter. Anyone have any thoughts?
That what I always told me junior....never and ever holding any stock thru the ER no matter what.Don't trust or falling in love with a stock.Know your time in and get out...that the rule..Who ever bought $22.52 already loss ( not much yet)Seem like they are soft on Q1 or could be lower ....not much going on...Look like good time for short take place.
"Nice week, very nice"
"No PR since three months, it doesn't looking good coming weeks.!!!"
Get ready to rock n roll today on that new order news!!
oh boy...$16 coming shzzz
"someone slowly pump stock, play with fire you will get buen, their pump target $21 ps, will see SEC caught this time"
"$40, $40, $40...do I hear $40?"
"Who sold 6.4k shares early..shzzz trust me..since I am in trading world I learn a lot a lot, lose a lot...but gave me a lesson and start up.I use to be holding a stock very long but I ask myself..how long it will pop, a year, 2 or three than your money sitting here.Just like the bank, when you are deposit money in, money won't sit still instead moving around that how the bank operation.Few rule I really learn:Never chasing.Never in love with a stock.Don't trust any company.Know your way in and out.Buy high sale higher.."
"Is the Rohinni order the same as the order announced today, aug 6? So two orders announced since earnings of combined $2.5M? Or is it three separate orders?"
Heavily unload...something..going on..Zack has been wrong many stocks..caution..Trade your own gut...
"volum so little, it won't hep if you are holding it, long...will lose their patience, next two months...will be for shopping & shipping stock not semiconductor...I will be short in next two months...I am predicted this one will be down to $17 ps..and if 01/24 if they are missed revenue for Q4 then...you know what to do.."
$15 coming..good bye $16.00 and hello $15.00
Blowout!!
I just want to congratulate all who have been as patient as I have been. Boom!!!!!!!!!
What is the logic behind the 10% drop in CYBE from the recent high?
So what's up?...I think a great earnings report and conf call later this month. At least $22 by then would be nice.
Would NOT want to be short.
some bad news...oh boy...short winner again..
Almost half million sold today...very strong sell...something going on.....
Nice to see us hanging over $30. Hope we can build on it.
oh my lord....
CyberOptics reached a 52 Week high at 38.78
Bettertrade01 what should I do?
Big delay on the Q2..should be around July 24th instead October...something going here...does not looking good when ER delay...
"No preannouncement this week. Last quarter, CYBE preannounced those strong revenues on 4/12. We didn't see something similar this quarter. Thought that might be a bad sign? But stock is doing great. Up to $17.30 today. I've been trimming some shares as Q2 bookings might be a bit light. Anyone have a guess as to revenues and earnings for Q2?"
Why the drop today? Was there a downgrade or something? CYBE was looking strong over $30 just yesterday.
And patients keeps paying
"they are just use old trick like Greece stock..or Drys, repurchase the shares...many investors bleeding because repurchase share..just like bait...so investors think...company look solid but too bad mostly long will get burn..good luck"
Wow! What lit the rocket fuel on this? Great little company.
"Weakness is in the front end and back end. Fang, Cloud, .coms and electric vehicles getting money flow ... for NOW. The conference call is very telling, the forecast was best. This unknown micro cap will get its days. as Micro LEDs explode."
"Net income three month of 4th quarter only $168K...shzzz almost negative...don't be so happy when back log of 1st 2020...Right now due to corona virus...consumer cut down spend, China stop order or export/import...not only hit Semiconductor..but anything included Amazon...Corona virus won't skip anyone and will take time before hit US manufacture production."
what a great trap setup short...hahaha...love it...
"Maybe this company start crypto currency machine, that could help stock spike like LTEA or NXTD....lol.Gzzz..people into bitcoin now babe....who has time go to store and buy electronic or money upgrade their TV when they are already owned..."
CYBE is down -5.95% to 18.10
"Just bought another 1,000 shares at $25, after my broker shared a report with a price target of $37.50."
No wonder the message board so quite...compare with other...because mostly institutional owned 65%..that not good that mean they are in control the price of stock..if somehow they are not decided keep it...and sold large of shares..stock could drop min $5.00 and depend on the company future...shzzz.$22.00 way over price to me for small company with small cap.
$12.3 mil in large orders in the last 3 months--includes the $4.2 mil order announced tonight
Any insight to what is causing this upwards movement?
"I always say..never chasing stock, cash out secure your profit, know the way get in and out..that carry with me all the time when I am trade. Just like Amazon..people chasing bought at $2000....and end up a lot people loss money or some holding not accepted loss.Never know what will happen tomorrow..one thing..never ever greedy with your profit even $50 still profit."
So....will this break through $44 before the earnings report and conf call?
Some of the $28B Tiawan semi is spending should trickle down to this company!
Stop short selling and buying back of stock.
"Up trend...Are you drunk? Even Amazon just post they are barely make it revenue on their Q4 and forecast Q1 will be soft or missed the guidance, as same time Apple reduce in their production 100 million Iphone due too decline of sale.As the same time China and US tariff talk won't go no where because both side won't back down.So do you think will be up trend?I still looking and search the source who ever pump to $41 last two year on Jan 16, 2017 and those two analyst since they are long gone. Of course when got all this,,will be justice."
ho hum just another $1.3 mil order--this is going to $45+ by EOQ3
Back in today. I liked the tone of the CC. I sense another good opportunity.
Corona virus has no vaccine40 million in WuHan under quarantine and maybe dieSo far has no clue where virus come fromThis will cause market crashGood luck
CyberOptics reached a 52 Week high at 30.16
like sad crashingbelow$15
Ouch down to $26's!? Kicking myself I didn't short a bunch AH yest at $33. Congrats to those who did. Thought the bullish guidance for Q2 might help stem the bloodletting today. But not helping much. Imagine if they didn't have that positive commentary. Stock would be crashing below $20.Amazing how this inflated junk got to $40. Can't wait to hear how the 2 analysts who kept raising their ridiculous price targets explain the latest poor earnings results. Those guys suckered in a bunch of investors.
"I like the news about new orders this week, looking forward to listening to the presentation today. Still long."
Hmm I'm just sayin'...we might hit $19 (or $20) before $10
"Yeah, looks like it's gonna hit $13 any day now shorties"
"I just wondering some of my friend...down their..really excited when stock market got hammer but this one up...Well it is not work that way..Rule for trade:Never falling in love with any stock.Never trust any companies no matter what.Know your way get in and out.3 days rule.profit taken, short...that your enemy.Never hold money somewhere too long...killed value.Just bad new today...share of Applied Materials fall 10%...due to weak forcast...you are know what gone happen in next few day..good luck.."
"CEO got paid almost $1 million shzzz...not only adding all employees so should be around $3 million come up paid those salary, not only paid rent, other ...shzzz look like they are need cut down...otherwise if revenue not making enough for a quarter..then will be loss.Just like you have $2.00 but you are spend $2.50..."
CyberOptics reached a 52 Week high at 31.98
Still wanting to go up. Likely to encounter significant overhead resistance from the August swoon and gap down. Looks like a decent reception for new products.
"Since no PR for the last 4 months, look to me will be soft ER, rule thumb never holding thru the ER no matter what.Buy dip sell high..and don't let money sitting do nothing.Good luck!!!!"
"dam..look like unload today...I don't think short somehow pick on the right day yesterday...Blue is right...if yesterday does not spike $2.00 for no reason, today should be drop around $9.00 - $11.00Look to me someone pump or manipulating the price.Some how I end up reading and I wonder...hmm...my rule: don't ever and never trust any companies...Since the Institutions holding about 65%..very scary if they are unload...Good luck long...you know what to do....."
The story is getting old--they need to land a big account or two or ten and start generating some real revenue growth and profits
CYBE reached a 52 Week high at 25.84

"dam their cash only available $6,670 ( correct me if I am wrong), compare $10,640 year of 2016..so that mean $3.7 million burn out..shzzz...I am only post the true base on their earning...so the cash would be run out next two quarter?..."
too high for buy..won't go over $40...wait next drop $11 ps
CYBE reached a new 52 Week High at 21.90
Any thoughts on the effects of the coronovirus on CYBE or how it will fare in this market going forward?
I thought it was a good conference presentation...take the time to listen to it. Chip shortage doesn't seem to cause a problem so far.
"Only 116,000 shares today? Will gradually rise in next few days."
It will red by tomorrow....Green won't be long..with Tariff going on...not good time investment any stocks..
CYBE is up 6.01% to 23.65
Oh boy even market massive sell off she closed green. It does not look that way to me....shzzz..enjoy the profit why you can...
FWIW I see Yahoo Finance now has a $35 one year target estimate. Works for me.
New 52 week high!!
Looks like small cap funds are buying into company. Every drop past 14 triggers buying.
The problem of this company...too much cost on expensetoo much in the inventoryDebt start adding up since they have no debt...Good luck tomorrow long...All I can say will head down in the range $22 - $25
"News good enough for everyone??? Earnings beat the street by 6 cents (Jeff has bragging rights), backlog up 41%, sales forecast to increase at least 28% next quarter. Rock n roll"
save your money...stock market will be crash when Delta spike in US..another shut down soon coming month around september...
"Shakin' the trees pretty hard today! Definitely a bad week for us CYBE longs, but that happens sometimes. I still contend that 6-12 months from now, we'll have recouped this week's losses and be sitting on some nice gains, but that doesn't make it any less painful!! Hang in there, folks -- it's only money. The best things in life are still free!!!"
not so fast...short setup at price $18.50....with 40k shares today of short...shzzz in next few days..the door will close and drop back to $15.00rule thumb...always discount price.more volume more shore joined the boat....unless insiders tried pump to $21 again...since they are already did....I just wonder where are those analyst....raised target price to $41????
"Micro LED looks like it could become a meaningful niche for the company. Don't know if a $1 million order can really move the shares, but we're having a good day, whatever the reason."
"Well, I guess all those that predicted the stock price to be back in the teens are gone from here. Taking their expertise to share their wisdom on other stocks."
Something is up. Up over 11% on almost 4 times the normal volume.
TMSC upholds capital expenditure target.
"who ever bought at $34 really big loss...never trust anyone, companies under sleepy Joe in white house.."
Analysts just raised their earnings estimate for this quarter from 17 cents to 29 cents!
Chip shortage worse than ever. Hopefully the company can procure chips necessary to produce their product. Only obvious risk I can see..
CYBE is down 5.31% to $18.91
"Customer pipe line, product pipe line...these two really know how set up bait...good luck..Consumer does not spend or buy electronic like before so Semiconductor will get hit hard in coming month.Good luck holding.sample look at Cybergate 360..what happen now....sale only two.....or none...Trust these two....writing good book..."
I'm back in.
If Mr Trump and Xinhu..meeting weekend coming up and both can not agreement then stock market will crash 700 or higher..then this one will be drop atleast $2.00My 100K ( profit from Amazon ready short)I usually long but then...if you are long have to waiting for long long time spike..Short always win...rule thum for stock..up a day..down 3 days..so I still make money ...
Anybody want to unload a large block?
"Blowout quarter, great guidance for next quarter!!"
Buyer had been taking off end of day last week or so. Gave up on that.
Yahoo 1 year target estimate up from $42 to $46.33
What does the thread think of earnings and where CYBE goes tomorrow?
$30 million of cash for previous years...but now...only $10 million or less left..shzzz so do the math...Do Cybeoptics making profit? If it does why the cash only $10 million left...If they are not having in their hand $30 million cash and keep business running until today...this company by now has atleast $20 million in debt or higher...No matter how much money you have..it will run out some day...
Cash your profit....it will continue heading lower due too US and China trade war...this girl could heading down $12-$14...good luck anyone.Dow could 1000 point in coming days.
nice...now..hello $17 and goodbye $18.00....
"Here an update:Should I do long term with CYBE? NO! Why?$13 million revenue reduced compare with $2016.Inventories increased to 14,393 compare with 11,531 of 2016.Almost $4 million cash burned during year of 2017 and cash remain only $6,944 and I expect it will last around only 2 more years.Selling, general and administrative and R&D expenses too high or $6 milion every quarter. They are need cut down.Fair price should be around $7.50 - $10.50Too many products has been written off or off set.Float too high same as OS.Too many promised but end of hopeless."

"Gosh, BT you're right...it dropped a few cents when the DOW dropped 700 points, and I jumped out the window.Yeah...dropped fews cents....here the tips:When are you walking...instead look 1 step you have to look 3 step ahead...Take that and used it for trading.."
One year target estimate $42
"If it drops to $25 again, I'm back in for more"
Looks like we've hit a bit of an equilibrium here at $18. Hopefully it will be broken to the upside in the next few sessions.
Good luck everyone...ER coming soon.
"First I always carry with me money making money...I used to be hold stock 1 year or 5 years..then waiting waiting.....rule buy low sale high..but then it spiked...cash out profit for 5 years..but when I do the math...during 5 years I could make more money than that.So from that day...I never and ever hold any stock more than a month..that rule when trading..Your money why you are let sitting dead place.For Cybe...look to me their income decrease 30%...what next 4th quarter..know body know..another net loss again due too tax income...I my prediction another loss in net income $700K or higher.Many long dreaming come back $41 ps...no it won't happen again.Economy forecast 2020...not anyone know either but one thing...people reduced buy electronic like TV, Smartphone and computer..so that will impact semiconductors business.I agreed, Cybe there annual income used to be $120 million but 2019 everything different..they are barely make it or even loss every quarter and tried stay float.Good luck holding it."

"Caution everyone: Trump tariffs deal impacted a lot of business. The US currently trade war with China, and if China retaliation by cancel deal with many US companies then stock price could badly deep plunge 50% or higher. Do your research which companies has business with China and should get out safe yourself in matter weeks coming."
Relative strength of these shares remarkable.
"Any prognostications for the upcoming earnings release? The street estimates 13 cents, and I think they'll beat that, so I'll pick 16 cents out of the air just to see who gets bragging rights."
Wow now up 15%!!? On a Dougherty target price raise? This market sure is nuts. Momo traders love to chase. CYBE now up almost 50% just this month. Have things really gotten that much better in less than 3 weeks?
"Guess no preannouncement. Earnings on the 28th. I'm a bit surprised the company didn't preannounce Q4 revenues well ahead of their $13-$15M guidance. I was thinking they'd be at least $16-$17M, based on the strong Q4 reports I've seen from other semi companies. But looks like Q4 might only be good, not great. We'll see later this month. Stock has priced in a blockbuster report, so could be some disappointment."
I like the sound of the new launches...so still long
New high going back to July last year. Probably going to see lots of resistance trying to fill the gap from that precipitous decline. It would appear that the evolution of the product line up has created some optimism that CYBE can grab a bigger piece of the pie.
Who ever bought $22 or higher already loss...that why I said...never and ever chasing any stock...Market will be crash around end of march or mid april...
"Hmm...up a decent amount on an otherwise red day, maybe someone thinks something positive might come up at the conference tomorrow."
"Revenues are up, estiamted, 70% average for Q1-3 2016. It is hard to believe anyone would conclude a workforce reduction was in order. The market is forecasting CYBERGAGE 360.Keep your eye on the ball.Q4 2015 webcast: CEO says""But longer-term we believe fundamentally MRS 3D sensor technology is really a -- we have invented a 3D microscope that can move at production speeds.""Q1 2016 webcast CEO says ""nothing like CyberGage exists today so we are kind of trying to find out what -- how much of the general purpose 3D scanning market is going to be available to us and it's really too early for us to quantify right now as to whether it's hundreds of millions of dollars or tens of millions of dollars or a bigger chunk of the billions of dollars, it's just too hard to quantify sitting here. It's a new product.""The market is trying to assign a value to CYBERGAGE 360. This niche semiconder inspection company has a BIG unknown and hopefully a completely different industry with Cybergage 360.Historical valuations maybe worthless.Waiting for the Cybergage 360 ordersGLTA"
Square root divided by b means up and the down or maybe across.
Very strong sale today..sure..who ever bought at $18.50 previous day already big loss...which currently market...not good time buy or holding any stock no matter how dip...which stock never has bottom..Many people mistake on Amazon...think $1500 bottom but not stop their. It is continuous head to $1200 or lower...
Lowered guidance.
stock market not looking good in coming month under Joe...good luck..my advise..hold your trade or stop.
Get out..huge crash tomorrow...down could loss 3000 point.Asia market already big lost...
Company has been hobbled by it's reliance on memory manufacturers. Breaking into another market niche is just huge.
sorry long..profit taken last two days...even green I am still made profit...with fund of $100k....easy money
Good bye $19 and hello $14.50 why Well look like their annual revenue will be $60 million and EPS will be $0.14 Unfortunately base on my prediction will be very soft on 1st quarter or revenue $11 million as the sametime has pay for the tax will impact their revenue.If I am long I just enjoy profit $19.40 or $20 otherwise it won't spike to $30 or $40Why base on future of it...price per share only base on revenue but if revenue reducing will impact their stock price and depend on market Good luck holding...
"load it up...we have very smart CEO and CFO of the year...come on sell your home, car saving, 401k all in...I just sold my home and favor car all in, great company, great future, down only 17 cents no big deal....wow if hit $41 like long time ago...you are millionair...You have to trust them...specially CFO and CEO..if they told jumb down brigde...you are must jump ok...Don't use it if you don't trust."

what happens if its a sales and earnings beat and no one notices? apparently if you watch cybe today you will get an answer
Up 19% now!?! Who would be chasing this thing? A year's worth of gains in a day. On no news. Let's get in!
CyberOptics reached a 52 Week high at 34.74
"I agreed...65% owned by institutional investors and if they are sold at once time stock could be big drop...never know...the Institutional won't hold any stock for long period because they have to move on...also small market cap $143 million, big company won't be interested unless the business has something special product for the big company interested on it.It is very scary and need work for more public interesting otherwise just like store with empty customer."
"Hi everyone. I'm following CYBER for quite some time. To me the situation seems moving from a lateral movement to a possible up trend. Is there someone that know how the sales of the company are going. How is the market trend like in automated vision systems? I think also CANON is doing well.http://www.canon.com/technology/future/3dmachinevision.htmlTalking from a Technical Analisys view point, the stock is ready to accelerate his up trend after a consolidation period quite long. JMHO"
"Love the numbers for last quarter...read the cc and I'm not worried about this quarter. They usually forecast conservatively, and even if they don't surprise, I suspect they'll make money. On the whole, 2019 looks good."
Long get out why you can...many companies in my state start let people go...why..mostly companies doing business with China or China part of their customer...between trade China n US...none of them back down and manufacture get hit...China retaliation US by stop order mostly electronic from US....Hope the trade deal get done..otherwise more people losing the job.Good luck guy...My predict should not hold any stock long..only day trade or hold on if interesting..then buy...
I'll go out on a limb and IMHO predict this hits $32 by the CC
S&p rating for this stock “strong sell” scary huh
"load it up....$18 ps so cheap....I sell my home, car ( 50K), 401k everything...CYBE great company...revenue great...load it up...oh it could hit $200 ps...love it.Load it up as much as you can.."
turning in to a buying opportunity
Let’s hope some rationality remains with this one. Company management seems to understand “ steady as she goes”. Still very concerned about what may be lurking in that inventory number.
"Just like Amazon, they are pump to $2000 ps and many trader chasing it now end up bag holder and got burn. I already advice them but not listen to me, sorry for them, Stock market not simple, in matter day could spike to $100 or -$100Do you think if a stock has many in Institutional holder will be up trend?If you are lucky, get in when good time and out when pump are over.Otherwise if you are chasing it...you will get burn.Even Amazon strong stock and they are struggle right now...what do you think market and this stock? Up trend..you are luck if get out at $22.00"
Unload before too late if ....after ER...the in Institutions unload their share..shzzz...head down to $5.00...not even $7.00 what I predicted.
Hope that new $4.2 million order is enough communication and confidence to satisfy some people
hahaha...that what exactly my prediction. next coming week down will be big drop due too job loss....investor loss of trust and massive sell off..We are short making money again...love it...thanks profit $100k from Amazon...$2000 ps...who every really pump did good job on it...
Rule for trade..never chasing..a stock...no matter what..$32 ps too high...won't go much higher..as same time short will push it down..
"Ok kids, here are the numbers to beat....-$.04/share and $12.7M. Any great prognostications??"
short setup trap at $18 then drop down $17...profit $1.00
CyberOptics reached a 52 Week high at 31.18
"Ok...so my prognostication was wrong. But I didn't guess as wrong as the people who bought yesterday, now that's bad timing."
Ok it's time for new bragging rights...what are your prognostications for earnings this afternoon? The street is guessing 29 cents; my hunch is 39 cents.
Whoops!
In again today. It's been a while. semi cap still has room and company more likely to surprise on the upside rather than dissapoint un this environment.
"Up trend? stock market, never know, even if you are experience, just like Amazon, many people think strong stock, $2000 ps no big deal, even if hit $3000 someone still buy it, and guess what they are barely reach revenue on Q4 that included holiday season, and CEO has post Q1 will be missed guidance.....So don't put a lot of hope on any stock, you will get burn.Don't ever in love with it and know your time get out."
"Better trade, what should I do now that it is almost 25?"
Dipped down to flat after a very strong open. An excellent opportunity to add a few hundred shares. Chart is shaping up very well.
Ouch. Has to hurt.
Nice $2.75 mill repeat order!!
"Oh boy people got trap, if without tax change, earning for 4th quarter only $89k...that does not look good. Earnings for the year reduced, came to $1.3 million or $0.19 per share, compared to $11.6 million or $1.64 per share in 2016Sales of SMT inspection systems declined 31% year-over-year to $4.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 CyberOptics ended the fourth quarter of 2017 with an order backlog of $11.4 million. reduced $2 million compare with average."
Great solid...do you know how to trade...drop to $11.00 from $23.00...that mean $12.00 loss...and still sitting here... post solid....50% loss...if you can not figure out then trading not your life.
I will use my profit $100k from Amazon and short this babe all the way...good luck long...next week will be interesting...

$5 million in debt..and what up with $17 million dollar in the inventory..something wrong here.....inventory add up...$2 million 1st quarter compare 4th of 2019....
Rule for trading: recognize when you've incorrectly assessed the situation.
waiting for $12.00 ...lower than I expected..
"Technically speaking...this company won't make any profit per quarter in coming months. Why..$6 million operating expense every quarter. So to avoiding negative on operating income, CYBE revenue must meet $12 million per quarter and if less than that will be loss in operating income.Also $10 million or higher paid for 170 employees.They are need reduced in the operating expenses otherwise every quarter will be even out or negative."
That what I predicted...thanks Tariff very good day for short..
CYBE showing some decent relative strength.

ouch..who ever bought at $19...already loss $1.00...I warned you already..which currently market....down could easily crash $800 or more...that why never and ever hold any stock for long period time...either short or day trade..that all..Your money..why let it seat and do nothing.
Caution long..short will bring up to $37 - $38 then drive down to $30 or lower...
Short....get ready full force.Volume so low that indication of not really active sign.Annual revenue reduced compare previous years that mean ...eps will reduceExpense cost more thang earningLong get ready unload that my advice...
should cash out profit at $19.00 because you won't see it for long long time....
No money but spend like wild that what you gone get....look like really soft for 2nd quarter. I warned you already. Cash out the profit...secure.
Good luck long..I don't know what to say but long will get zap..really really zap...
"down hill...shzzz lost $5 million in the revenue and net income loss almost half million ...look to me seem like their income revenue keep decline and forecast for 4th $13 - $15 million when your 3rd quarter don't even make it.As the same time they are even forecast 2020 ..really...Mostly holder are the Institutions, but if they are unload...stock could dive down $7.00I don't trust these two and the company...Look to me 4th quarter will below $11 million and net income loss could hit $1 million due too tax end of year...Good luck hold it.Just cash out short profit this money...big drop - $1.10...great..."
Took a chunk of the money and bought ORBC.
Why does Subohd even mention Q4? He should just wait and see what the status is at the next CC. He completely took the positivity out of the earnings report.
hahah..short win again...I already told you..which currently market..not good holding any long position..in and out..or short.Market will crash all the way end of January...after that will be better due too a lot companies will report annual net income...March will be soft depend on economic..and US and China...if make it solution...Huawei CFO will guilty of charge...and cause market crash 800-1000 point...Good luck.....
Cybe is a growth stock with fine financial results.
CYBE reached a 52 Week high at 24.56
"Any prognostications for tomorrow's report? I'm all out of ideas, although even the street is predicting an 8 cent profit (not all that great) and not a loss."
some guy still dream about $40 ps ..never and ever happen again....good luck...now they have $4 million in debt....and low on cash..if keep burned without increase income...share offering will be next....
Wow nice volume
I am ready short this one...my prediction will drop to $10 ps due too loss in 3rd quarter and revenue of 4th quarter will be less than estimation..Good luck long..Around 10/16 will find down.
I think we hit $35 this year
"Got out a few months ago with a decent profit despite the naysayers on this board. Back in today. Opening was gift, grinding higher all day, closed at the highs with the market selling off. Looks good to me."
I see the analysts have raised their earnings estimates for the next quarter from a -$.03 to +$.02.
