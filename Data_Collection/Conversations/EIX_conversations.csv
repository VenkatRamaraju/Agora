"I have been trading EIX for awhile now. This thing when ever it reach around $60's it will drop back down to $54's or $55's range. Base on your buy in price at $59's if I were you I would average it down at this low price range. The recently down trend I think is because summer is coming and fire season is here with dry weather. So most investor worry if there will be more fire damage that will cost EIX liabilities like couple years ago. But don't worry, they always can raise the electric price to cover the cost like we see on our electric bill every month. There are no businesses want to run with a lost and I think the dividend is pretty safe base of their history pay out."
"wondering if conversations here are as 'blocked' as on articles?I was simply commenting on the recent KO, EIX, ABBV article - that I need to follow this one; have KO but sold some for profits @ $57, and that ABBV was still too high for me..."
"I think I'll start a small position this am. Great div yield, well covered, nice steady DGR, no cuts ever. Reasonable debt and PR, under it's 5yr. blended P/E avg., decent cap-app possible. Fits into my early-retirement increasing div paycheck port. Works for me %^).."
"I'm going to add a few shares c. 56. I realize the E est. are flat for EOFY21, but the sterling 18 yr. history of divs and div growth, with a div hike coming next Q, which will be nearly 5% fwd. yield.... works for me %^)."

Why is this up?
Buy it at 50 to 51 and hold it for 2 years and collect dividend until the market corrects
"$1.5 Billion issuance is alot of money. Big Players are going to want in a lot lower then $57.00. If its a Convertible Share Offer , expect to see $52.00 the hardware. If they are going to Market with a new issuance expect $50.00. Can't touch this until the the $1.5 Billion yet again lowering Long Shareholder Equity Position and dilution of EPS. Dead money until the news the $1.5 Billion of dilution is filled."
Why the ~$1.00 drop today? Ex- date yesterday??
If you are buying this stock for the dividend that's fine but dont expect any stock appreciation.
Time to sell this dog.
I'm sure there are lots of dividend portfolios being built here. Hit me with your top 4 high dividend / safe plays! #NOC#EIX#ABBV#IBM
The panic from southern California fires for the short term is dramatically pushing price down and will possibly continue for a couple of days. Based on earnings and current over reaction presents a long term buy opportunity.
My dad worked for Edison for over 40 years and retired Director. He says Edison is NOT LIABLE FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM FIRES CAUSED BY DOWNED LINES DUE TO HIGH WINDS!. I personally just reallocated 150k of my 401k at 68.50. It will recover almost all of this 13$ loss by next march
Added a few more shares @>4.5% div yield... works for me in my ERIDP port..%^)

"$ES $NEE $DUK $POR $ED $EIX $AGR $PPL all have the current ROE below of 8,7%. Does it mean what all these companies are SELL too?"
"Entered 1/3 position under $55 and plan to add during the year. If you believe the Dividend Yield Theory the stock seems quite undervalued. With EIX five year average yield at 3.57% the shares would need to rise to $74 with no dividend increases to reach that target at the current 2.65 annual payout.Only one measurement but it has served me well over the years, which is how I invest. Over the years. Play the long game."
"This is probably oversold- panic spillover from PCG (which is genuinely in trouble). Evidence that EIX equipment started the Woolsey Fire is only anecdotal so far- they detected an equipment disturbance about 2 minutes before the fire was reported. I find it hard to believe that a wildfire was detected and reported only 2 minutes after breaking out; much more likely that EIX equipment disturbance was damaged by the fire. Regardless, the fire is more than 50% under control, and liabilities would likely be less than $1 Billion. EIX stock price has been basically lock-step with PCG (which is almost certainly responsible and will be liable for the far more devastating fires in Northern CA). Once information is updated to separate the two, EIX should recover substantially."
laws will change utilities cant have risks like unlimited exposure. no one can do business that way
