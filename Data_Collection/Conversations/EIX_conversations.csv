Technicals at 9trading are showing great signs of upside potential. Target: 91.29.
Today's announcement of the increase in dividend should propel EIX up at least a buck or two (dividend is now SAFE).
"Long term downtrend line has been broken recently. This is SUPER Bullish!! Short term target is previous intermediate top off the bottom (65.97), after that next target is 200 day moving average currently just over 66!!"
"Nice rally off the lows recently. Also, we just moved back above the 20 day moving average. We are doing this in the midst of a nice thick candlestick gap up. Also, both MACD and RSI look bullish. RSI is getting ready to punch through above the 50 line, which is BULLISH territory!! Only thing missing is high volume, which we are NOT seeing at the moment."
Time to buy some
Nice drop..I think I'll add a few more today...
Holding. SCE always comes back better. SCE checking every single line and has failsafe equipment to shut down in high winds. Expect to get back to $85.
Got in at $47...making money...
Golden State should own all the utilities in the state.
Most of my stocks are in a bear market including this one. This market is mainly interested in tech stocks.
"with the liabilities priced in, it's worth at least $66. So there is some value left. It's being punished equally with PCG."
"Okay, late trading action looks FANTASTIC on EIX!! Volume is low I'll grant you that, however we have two days in a row of candlestick with lower tail on the chart. Also, take a look at the accumulation very evident on the MACD line. Also take a look at the VERY Bullish RSI line (each successive low since the initial break is higher. Lets keep our fingers crossed and just sit and wait for better times ahead with EIX!!!"
EIX is up 4.99% to 65.65
Is any of Eix territory invoked so far?
Beep Beep Beep
The reason for the fall is that many families in Ventura have fill a big lawsuit against EIX.according to the LA times.
There is talk of only two interest rate hikes. It’s a positive for utilities.
EIX reached a new 52 Week Low at 59.66
"EIX will fall more this Monday, June 11, due to this news: https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/PG-E-blamed-for-12-Wine-Country-fires-faces-12979945.php?t=230f57020d"
"Investors, I pulled out of my long-time EIX holdings based on the unsettled fire issues. This is a great company; however with all the crazy things that have happened to Pacific Gas and Electric (PCG) and the blame and possible loss of litigation being aimed at them, EIX will most likely suffer the same losses. So as I watch closely the PCG news, I bailed out. I really had to take some gain on the EIX. My wishes are for a major law change happens to relieve both EIX and PCG of the potential of billions in liabilities. Good luck to all of you investors."
We live in a socialist democratic state that wants to blame business for everything.
Why the ~$2 hit today?
"BUT ISNT THE FIRE MOSTLY IN THE MALIBU AREA? ISNT THAT PCG AREA NOT EIXDOES EIX HAVE SERVICE DOWN THEREWERE PEOPLE JUST SELLING EIX WITH PCG THINKING THIS WAS FROM THE PREVIOUS WHERE SOUTHERN AND ALSO NORTHERN CALI HAD FIRES?IF SO, LONG EIX?"
"Why the large drop on December 12, 2017? I located no related story regarding the stock price action today."
If this goes down to 45 it will yield a 5.3% dividend then I can swap SO for this.
A business should not have to suffer for an act of god. Wildfires have occurred since the beginning of time. All of a sudden the gov't wants to hold businesses responsible for these fires. State and other local govt is screwed up.
"Very Similar Pattern in Oct and Feb, both times lead to break outs. Unique here is the $.066 Dividend announcement coming on Thursday ex-dividend July 1st or the 8th. I'm guessing. Payable July 30th.."
wonder why the insurance stocks have not taken a hit because CA damage
"Folks, this could be another Valeant in the making. Please invest carefully."
"Might be good news today, seems CA lawmakers drafting legislation to clarify utility liability on fire damage."
dividend increase
"Cramer just gave his ""buy buy buy"" buzzer on this and said it is oversold. Not sure if it will help at this point."
Why the ~$1.00 drop today? Ex- date yesterday??
looks bad for eix
Unfortunately I do. Bought the slop and it immediately dropped 5% day one.
"EIX rising again, still well under it's 5 yr. blended P/E avg., and historic P/E avg. (FV). Div coming up.. we will be in the 60's before EOFY21...%^)"
The EV sales in Cali will run to the grid every 250mi
I am also an EIX investor that stands in disbelief in the blame EIX is taking for the recent events in California. The latest lawsuit alleges the mudslides are intertwined with the results of the fires allegedly caused by EIX. I sure hope an earthquake does not strike very soon.
"The fires and mudslides in Montecito were obvious. It had nothing to do with EIX. I lived in Isla Vista during the past years drought. Based on previous years learning there very restrictive water use requirements imposed on the wealthy folks in Montecito, such as Oprah and Ellen. The water use by the wealthy was public knowledge and published. They all gave a middle finger to the ""poor folks"" and continued to water their landscape extensively despite the drought. So, guess what happened? All that fire fuel they created during irrigation through the drought caught fire during the Santa Ana winds and the following rains and mud flows wiped out their poorly planned evacuation roads. Check the Montecito water usage logs, these greedy scoff-laws are the real culprits, not EIX."
"This company is not going to be solve it within the next 2 and a half to 3 years. It will not be because of wildfires, either. Dan Johnson."
Both EIX and PCG did well today in contrast to other utilities. No news why but we will take it.
you will not see this low price again. Strong Buy. 66 coming back in few days.
laws will change utilities cant have risks like unlimited exposure. no one can do business that way
"With the TLT (20 year Treasury) bottoming, and with EIX earnings coming up on Feb. 22nd, I think we're in for continued rally here. The only thing that could stop its forward ascent is a double bottom on S&P and or an earnings or revenue miss!!"
Why is EIX guilty without any proof?
Wait until 2021 rate increases that will be justified with community charity programs improves safety and environment and higher labor costs
EIX reached a 52 Week high at 78.25
"WOW, this is horrible news..........who knows how long before dividend is reinstated/ I had just started buying a few hundred shares 2 days ago at $69......I am OUT!"
"Again, even if their equipment was involved, they are not totally to blame considering the Perfect Firestorm conditions before the fire began. Also, strong Santa Anna winds (in excess of 80 mph), may have brought down their power lines (70 mph is enough to bring down power lines in many areas of U.S.). So, this would be an act of God."
"wondering if conversations here are as 'blocked' as on articles?I was simply commenting on the recent KO, EIX, ABBV article - that I need to follow this one; have KO but sold some for profits @ $57, and that ABBV was still too high for me..."
"The panic will diminish, but not for a while. I'm holding this stock long term due to this, and the healthy dividend yield. There is a broader discussion though regarding California - and that one is not good. If PCG does not establish the court ordered restructuring by June, 2020, then they will not be able to buy into and ""benefit"" from the CA wildfire fund. You might say ""so what?"". Well, the problem with this is that the fund itself will be underfunded. So, as one of the big 3 CA IOU's goes, so goes the rest. All in it together, so to speak. Then there is the issue of EIX share dilution - announcing in March and diluting in July when other good companies are buying shares back. How it was announced and executed is another issue. So, the bottom line is that your ""long:"" window need to be really long - hold for the dividend and don't hold your breath too long on share value recovery."
With the virus many people and businesses are not paying their electric bill.
"Why the drop Southern California is now fully open and business is returning . That's why . You only make money when the FEDS print it. Actually, having to pay for your Electric what type of concept is that!"
ex-divedend day is here September 27. 0.605
this cut is nuts... still no proof the fire was caused by SCE equipment
Like I said before utilities in CA are no longer an investment so long as they can be held responsible for wildfires.
California.. Big difference then in 2020. No Heat wave it's been very cool spring unlike in 2020. I expect as much as a 20% drop in revenue for EIX in Q2.
"Stock has been as high as 67 and change, now way off the highs but still up about a buck. Something BIG must have been released but I'm not seeing anything!!!"
Today might drop more due to SB 819 bill being introduced even though it's not new information.
"zero containment..... and winds tonight.... I'd expect the price to drop more.... but, wow.... what an investment opportunity."
Buy it at 50 to 51 and hold it for 2 years and collect dividend until the market corrects
Why is this up?
"Just sold my very small position (10 shares), I purchased yesterday at 55 and change. Today's horrendous destruction of PCG stock and possible lawsuits against EIX made me a seller. Who knows what these stocks are going to do next????"
"wow ,did sce turn the power off in Calabasas due to fire threat. Neighborhoods miles from the fire dark! conditions changed as the winds calmed down . If the public wants to hold electric utilities liable for fires ,what choice do the companies have. Heard Saturday morning low water pressure in the Malibu area is that power related? Let the debate continue"
$EIX Maintains Wells Fargo Overweight USD 72 » USD 70Maintains Morgan Stanley Equal-Weight USD 60 » USD 59
I keep thinking there will be news to explain the collapse today. Too iffy to consider it an opportunity.
"Excellent revenues and earnings reported last night by good, old, EIX!! EIX handily beat street expectations on earnings (and probably revenues too, but it didn't mention that in the article!!). Stock FINALLY above 20 day average for the first time since early December!! Yes Ladies and Gents, looks like EIX is FINALLY coming out of the investment toilet!!"
New Leg DOWN for EIX stock!! Hopefully this dip is shallow and we can get back above the 50 day moving average soon!!
"Holy Toledo, now 19 people DEAD in Paradise, CA. (just North of Sacramento). Unbelievable this could happen in this day and age!!"
This goes to show that there is no safe investment.
This stock is way oversold. The key to be rich is to buy during recession or low and hold. It always works for me. Strong Buy.
This stock should be $80. The wildfire scare is a joke.
"$1.5 Billion issuance is alot of money. Big Players are going to want in a lot lower then $57.00. If its a Convertible Share Offer , expect to see $52.00 the hardware. If they are going to Market with a new issuance expect $50.00. Can't touch this until the the $1.5 Billion yet again lowering Long Shareholder Equity Position and dilution of EPS. Dead money until the news the $1.5 Billion of dilution is filled."
Why up AH?
Challenger Crash: Cape Canaveral. The market knew Lockheed Martin wasn’t responsible for the explosion and the stock rebounded from -6% to -3% on the day following the explosion of the rocket. The wisdom of the market knew they weren’t responsible.
#EIX steady progress. Looking for breakout at 71.
I'm sure there are lots of dividend portfolios being built here. Hit me with your top 4 high dividend / safe plays! #NOC#EIX#ABBV#IBM
EIX reached a new 52 Week Low at 58.17
"EIX should be rallying on this news:After nearly a month of battling the so-called ""Thomas Fire,"" fire personnel have nearly reached full containment. As of Dec. 31, the wind-whipped fire, which is the biggest blaze in California's history since detailed record-keeping began in 1932, was 92 percent contained."
Why is EIX down almost 5 bucks right now??? I've seen NO NEWS!!!!
"Looks like some tax loss selling on the stock today. If it goes back down into the 67 range, I'm doubling down. Best opportunity to buy a beaten down stock since Hurricane Irma pummeled FL. insurance stocks!!!"
Will go below 50 this time
"I Bought $150,000 of this Today at an average of $56.63. I don't see the reason for thebig selloff.. It's now all the way down to $56 !I'm putting together a big portfolio of divvy stocks, this is one of em."
One more day of high winds and low humidity may mean Friday could be the last chance investors will have to buy EIX below 70.
EIX is up 11.70% to $52.71
EIX is down 5.07% to $65.89
Utilities are.monopolies. Everyone in the service area has to buy. Pricing is fixed.
eix bagholders now buying pcg to the north
"This stock is the Biggest and EASIEST positive stock investment since the FL. insurance stocks collapsed ahead of Hurricane Irma, then bounce back with a VENGEANCE when the hurricane did far less damage then Hurricane Center initially forecast. Homes will be rebuilt no matter what happens with the fires. Sure, could go lower in the next few days, but damage to stock has already been done. I see an EASY 8 to 10 points on this stock in just 6 months or less!!"
"Can't believe this HUGE move and collapse today. Maybe someone made a mistake and bought a TON instead of a few shares. However, there was big volume yesterday so something is brewing..."
"someone is going to have a hard time proving these fires were caused by the utility, also I read they found a homeless camp where one of the fires started"
"Clearly, the Gov of California's Electric initiatives will triple stocks like EIX in the next five years. Also, the California liberals President PICK will increase energy prices by 100% over the next 48 months. Not going to see EIX at these historic lows pass the election."
This is an insane world if Edison is responsible when the power lines go down and sparks a fire due to high winds. Are builders also responsible when a building is destroyed because of an earthquake?
"Next question is: How low do we go with this current, VICIOUS, Crash?? Looks like good resistance from 58 to 59."
"Editorial: After 111 deaths, it's time to replace PG&E #PGE $PCG $EIX $SPY""Investigators found that the utility’s top management had diverted ratepayer funds intended for maintenance to pay for executive bonuses and shareholder dividends.""https://t.co/p4C6ItqGMH via @mercnews"
Like I said before this stock is uninvestible.
People wake up!! This isn't the only time in CA history that Edison power lines MAY have caused a fire due to inclement weather and guess what? They've never been found liable!!!!!!!!!!!
It's going negative soon. I think it's just rumors of a limited liability on the wildfires.
"Liked the chart sooooooo much (along with fires going out and overall fundamentals), that I bought more shares today!!!"
Wildfires in Ventura County. But such a drastic fall seems unwarranted given any costs are probably recoverable.
"Probably a good pickup right here @$62 for the near term. I'm surprised this thing didn't ""relief rally"" on the back of the news that it's getting blamed for the mudslides, too. Haha Silly silly, opportunistic. what's next, EIX getting blamed for North Korean missile launch?"
Heavy rain is predicted for the southern Calif. coast mountains Monday night through Tuesday night which will put an end to wildfire worries for many months and so EIX might rally 5% the week of Jan. 8-12.
This fire thing killing this stock is complete madness.
Wow let the law suites start.
"My Estimate for Q3 is $1.85 a Share is $.50 cents beat. Unprecedented, heat wave equals big Q3 EPS."
Missed by 1.07 vs .$94 missed by $.13 Cents. Revenue clearly rigged to the same amount as last year. Most were expecting higher revenues as business and companies came back on line in the Quarter. Will push to the $52.00 Range now.
EIX leading the pack today in my early-retired increasing div paycheck port...%^)
FLASH CRASH
There you have it you lost your annualized 4.9% dividend in one slow volume trading day. So much for Divvy stocks in a rigged market..
SANTA ANA condition always makes this stock drop.
Any news ?
POS
"This is actually the future of renewable energy, it’s just not in the name and, thus Robinhood doesn’t know it exists"
Anyone has knowledge on EIX what is going on? Overall energy market is also down. 1.43 Millions share transferred a couple of mins before closing.
"Well, just as I figured, 10 year Treasury yields up, EIX down. Stock currently below 200 day average. Wouldn't be surprised if it finishes the day at or just above 200 day average. Stay tuned race fans!!"
"As an investor in EIX I have seen the stock drop significantly during the years of massive supplier cost increases; I almost jumped with a purchase of additional stock when the stock fell to a bargain price. Well, here we are once again. Only this time I have purchased additional shares. By the way, fires and mudslides are a fact of life in California. However, so is the demand for power and its distribution. Finally, I wish the best to all who lost in these devastating events."
The only thing moving this stock is wildfires.
It is up almost 8% after hours. Dos anyone knows why?
Nice ride up today.
How low can it go?
EIX has been ON FIRE for 3 weeks now!! Looks like we're heading for a test of the 200 day moving average!! Stay tuned race fans...
Looks like the Socialist state wants to put EIX into bankruptcy now with the Bobcat fire.
Is Eix admitting fault?
WHY is EIX SOARING out of the BLUE???? Any info would be appreciated!!!!!!
Just sold my position. Afraid to stay with it as I know lawsuits will be filed. One of my long time holdings. Awful situation in CA. Feel terrible for the people there losing lives and homes.
What happen here
"Could be the SB 819 bill that was introduced today caused EIX to hit a new low. But a soaking rain is coming to southern California this coming Monday - Wednesday which means the fire season is over until at least May. So T's comment below could be right that we will ""not see this low [$62.20] price again"" and ""66 is coming next week."" My rationale side says I should double down tomorrow (Friday) morning...my emotional side says don't take the chance because EIX management may copy PCG's move and suspend the dividend which would send EIX shares down 20% to near 50. And then my investing money would be tied up for 1-2 years."
Edison is up 6.28% to 61.98
The panic from southern California fires for the short term is dramatically pushing price down and will possibly continue for a couple of days. Based on earnings and current over reaction presents a long term buy opportunity.
Nonsense! How to prove EIX caused the fire? Nothing! I am holding the stocks no matter what it goes
There goes my retirement. I guess I will have to eat cat food.
Can't believe the HUGE sell off today. PCG's woes must really be doing a number on EIX (which is WHY I wouldn't buy it again).
Yikes.. earnings miss !
"Nothing is safe. Utilities will find it difficult to maintain their dividends. With more business shut down, income will decline. It is possible EIX will take on more debt to finance expenses. More customers will not pay their bills as the Cares $ runs out. The sooner we get back to work, the more likely Utilities will be able to maintain their dividends. EIX seems over priced as investors look for stable income. Other utilities have higher yields."
Does anyone own this junk but me?
"Not sure WHY the stock is down today, except for lingering negative sentiments concerning the downgrade on Dec. 27th."
great price excellent dividend
"I have been trading EIX for awhile now. This thing when ever it reach around $60's it will drop back down to $54's or $55's range. Base on your buy in price at $59's if I were you I would average it down at this low price range. The recently down trend I think is because summer is coming and fire season is here with dry weather. So most investor worry if there will be more fire damage that will cost EIX liabilities like couple years ago. But don't worry, they always can raise the electric price to cover the cost like we see on our electric bill every month. There are no businesses want to run with a lost and I think the dividend is pretty safe base of their history pay out."
Is any Eix territory involved so far.
Big dividend increase. Obviously management is confident no significant liability from wildfires.
EIX is down 10.10% to $54.84
Fires are still raging big time out in S. CA. yet EIX chart pattern looking VERY stellar. We could have an easy 2 or 3 point rally once the fires are FINALLY put out (which could still take a few weeks).
Can't believe EIX isn't up at least 1% today on the favorable inflation news that came out this morning!! 10 year Treasury yield is now 2.85% down for the day!!
Okay just read the short blurb from JP Morgan. They just RAISED their price target on EIX from 65 to 68 bucks!! Not sure WHY the stock is down today.
Looks great for EIX
Cramer said this is ok safe to buy -time to buy a week ago.
"Don't be the last one out this time. Market is going to crash 10,000 points in the next five weeks."
Slow steady rising from the investment depths this morning!! Could be Bitcoin and block chain stock owners have discovered this stock??
Why anyone including myself who is holding this stock is beyond me.
"A few minutes before noon today both EIX and PCG spiked over 10% on a FAKE news report that some of the PCG fires in northern California last October were started by non-PCG owned hardware. So I think this proves the only thing holding the share price of EIX down to 61-62 is investor worry about legal liability for the Thompson fire in Ventura/Santa Barbara Counties. Once that issue is resolved EIX could jump 10-15% in an instant. Conversely, if that legal liability issue is not resolved in the coming weeks/months and looks hopeless, EIX management could suspend the dividend sending the share price down into the low 50's."
All Utilities may have little or no upside this year if this prediction hold true: https://finance.yahoo.com/m/03f4050f-55d7-3133-9a37-a4b3ee100955/10-year-yield-to-jump-as-high.html
"Just got back into EIX with a very small position. Once all the doom and gloom fades away (like an old soldier), this stock should eventually go back up to around 65 bucks or so. I get a pretty big dividend while I wait."
Republican mad at the election started the fires.
"Here's the only news on EIX I could confirm. This came out this morning: Edison International (NYSE: EIX) stock moved higher by 3 percent on heavy volume Tuesday afternoon after the public utility company in the state of California confirmed it will work with state legislators to improve natural disaster management and response time. A spokesperson from the company told Benzinga, ""Together we can deliver the solutions needed to save lives."""
EIX steadily moving up DESPITE 10 year Treasury yields moving higher. Very Bullish sign and chart!!
Earnings drop because many businesses closed therefore they are not using electricity. Edison stock price never really goes up in the long run because there is so much up and down action over time. If you go back 30 years ago you can find the stock price $55.
"Edison International’s dividendsEdison International (EIX) declared a dividend of $0.61 per share last week (ended December 8). This represents a sequential rise of 11.5%. The ex-dividend date is December 28, and this will be paid on January 31, 2017.Notably, EIX has increased its per share dividend for the 14th-straight year."
Short at $65.9
"Barrons says that EIX is not like PCG, small chance of bankruptcy. The dividend is safe and they have a $70 price target."
20 day moving average is currently 63 and change. That might be where the stock pulls back to short term...
It would be very nice if sp would go back to what it was before fires since last payment date was when it was very low. I reinvest divs so I picked up a chunk at low price.
"$ES $NEE $DUK $POR $ED $EIX $AGR $PPL all have the current ROE below of 8,7%. Does it mean what all these companies are SELL too?"
"Good support around 65 and change, with better support around 62. Hopefully we hit our lows at 65 and change!!"
"I think EIX is due for a pullback. What are your thoughts? Yo you should really check out awesomeS-TOCKS, they seem on point with their stocks."
My dad worked for Edison for over 40 years and retired Director. He says Edison is NOT LIABLE FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM FIRES CAUSED BY DOWNED LINES DUE TO HIGH WINDS!. I personally just reallocated 150k of my 401k at 68.50. It will recover almost all of this 13$ loss by next march
"I'm going to add a few shares c. 56. I realize the E est. are flat for EOFY21, but the sterling 18 yr. history of divs and div growth, with a div hike coming next Q, which will be nearly 5% fwd. yield.... works for me %^)."
Very good rally today in EIX considering the 10 year Treasury is surging to 2.61% as we speak. This is causing the XLU to break through pretty good support below 50 bucks (after going down over 12% since mid-Dec.).
I'm interested as to why EIX is moving down significantly while the market is slightly recovering. I would think regulated utilities would be viewed as somewhat of a safe haven. Thoughts?
Does anyone know how large the scope of damages are for the Woolsey Fire? I came across this website and its looks like Edison's equipment may have been involved with the Woolsey Fire: http://www.woolseylawyers.com/about-the-woolsey-fire
"Excellent, I was wondering WHY it was up 1.6% in AH."
Great defensive play EIX
Please can someone tell me if they cut the dividend ?and why is it falling so bad if they did not cut the dividend . the fire department clear them of any wrongs. thanks anyone.
62 coming
Stock is finally showing some stabilization this morning. Looking better then just an hour ago!! Love that Dividend Increase and prospects of company going forward!!
We dont know yet.....just speculation
EVs need to plug into Edison grid and EV sales are just running up
Question I have now with this massacre of the stock is: Is the Dividend Safe??
"I just DUMPED EIX!! I've been watching EIX skyrocket on the chart since mid June. The stock has gone Parabolic the past 10 days or so and is knocking on the 200 day moving average line. RSI is building a good area ABOVE 70 as we speak. If we punch through the 200 day average short covering could take the stock to 66-66.5 or so. I decided to take a VERY small loss and get out of this stock (its been a Dead Dog since I bought it and went MUCH LOWER then I had expected). Also, 10 year Treasury yield is down to 2.82%. Not sure how much lower this can go but if it goes lower utilities as you know go up and vice versa. So, if this yield does reverse higher (and it should), EIX should go down again (how much is anyone's guess). Anyway, I just freed up a nice chunk of coin to go shopping for better bargains!!"
If you are buying this stock for the dividend that's fine but dont expect any stock appreciation.
"Okay, here's the story no one posted concerning dividend cut: Shares of Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison fall 3.7% to $65.75 in extended trading following news that PG&E and Pacific Gas & Electric were suspending dividend payouts over potential liability from the California wildfires. Last week, Southern California Edison said it believed the investigations included ""the possible role of its facilities."" (maria.armental@wsj.com; @mjarmental)"
"So this quarter, 1.) They paid down the outstanding longterm debt by recalling it. 2.) Paid off 2017 Fire Obligations while taking no blame. and will still meet and beat EPS.. The Hot summer of California was a big winner for EIX. Maybe Q4 could be $1.98 a share. You have to figure 25% to 30% better then 2019. Just looking at my consumer bill."
"This is probably oversold- panic spillover from PCG (which is genuinely in trouble). Evidence that EIX equipment started the Woolsey Fire is only anecdotal so far- they detected an equipment disturbance about 2 minutes before the fire was reported. I find it hard to believe that a wildfire was detected and reported only 2 minutes after breaking out; much more likely that EIX equipment disturbance was damaged by the fire. Regardless, the fire is more than 50% under control, and liabilities would likely be less than $1 Billion. EIX stock price has been basically lock-step with PCG (which is almost certainly responsible and will be liable for the far more devastating fires in Northern CA). Once information is updated to separate the two, EIX should recover substantially."
"EIX above 20 day moving average, first time since early December!! Talk about Bullish!!"
EIX reached a new 52 Week Low at $54.84
EIX is being blamed for the recent Montecito mudslide too: https://finance.yahoo.com/m/c92d6bb2-c590-3de2-a00e-191102375995/edison-unit-faces-double.html Nearly all Utilities are down 15% from their highs a few months ago so even if there hadn't been any fires or mudslides EIX's share price would now be around 68 instead of 80. February is traditionally southern California's wettest month so if a big storm arrives and dumps 6-12 inches of rain on the Thompson Fire Area mountains there will be mudslides that are much worse than the ones that recently hit Montecito.
It should move to $55 to $56 range now and will stay in that range into 2021. Then around March of 2021 will pop to the $60 to $65 range. Based on my Tech Charts.
RSI..17...oversold!
Why is this down? fires again.
"EIX is a high reward, low risk short here."
"Entered 1/3 position under $55 and plan to add during the year. If you believe the Dividend Yield Theory the stock seems quite undervalued. With EIX five year average yield at 3.57% the shares would need to rise to $74 with no dividend increases to reach that target at the current 2.65 annual payout.Only one measurement but it has served me well over the years, which is how I invest. Over the years. Play the long game."
I'm accumulating shares below $63 with money I can afford to let sit for a year. I think a lot of institutions are doing the same.
Any price from 69.10 or lower and I'm doubling down on my position. All the Very Best to suffering home and business owners in S. CA. Hope the fires are put out ASAP!!
"I just can't believe this stock is having a 3rd Leg DOWN!!! Also, this happening with 10 year Treasury yields slowly going down, and the Dow breaking 26,000!!! Stock is DIRT CHEAP!! The XLU is also down fractionally, so its not just EIX. Maybe today's rally in the overall Market gives the FED more ammo to raise rates even more this year (which they won't do because they don't want to stop the party on Wall Street!!). Anyway, I'm not buying any more and will just wait and HOPE for better times ahead!!!"
"News reporting the Woolsey fire started on Santa Susana Field Lab property. Site where a partial nuclear meltdown occurred back in the 50's. Substation reported a ""disturbance"" about the same time. Fear that some contamination got spread in the smoke. This issue is not going to be resolved any time soon."
"Utilities generally have lot of headwinds going forward. Their P/E values will comedown as interest rates go up. EIX now has normalized or slightly lower P/E going forward. That’s rationally looking at the numbers. It’s going to trade like other utilities or XLU. The other piece is politicians. They will try to look good at the expense of the utilities and score points with people. That’s where hidden risk is. The next positive move for EIX is earnings report, but likely will be short lasting. Money could be tied up for couple of years."
Added a few more shares @>4.5% div yield... works for me in my ERIDP port..%^)
Interesting! so everyone posting here is on vacation? Are they even real investors?
"It would behoove management to provide a statement clarifying their intention to keep their dividend. Listen, not to take anything from the severity of the horrific and sever nature of the wild fires but, any and all potential outcomes including litigious have certainly already been baked into the PPS. One could make the argument, EIX was trading at a premium circa 24x and traders used and continue to use the headline to blow the foam. Personally, I believe the valuation argument to be harder to fathom when the over all market continues to residing the term “new high”. The state of California will soon recognize easier avenues to “quick dime street”."
Utilities are interest Rate sensitive so any talk about the Fed raising makes them tumble. Get in low prior to Ex-div (Now) and write calls to lower overall costs further.
"This makes no sense, the street will gladly pay 1200/share of AMZN, 1100/share for GOOG, etc. yet they won't buy with both fists EIX after a horrendous correction!! Sure interest rates going up will effect it slightly (but remember interest rates went up in 2017 and until the fires the stock was in the lower 80s)."
No one cares about this electric utility that will supply service to all these electric cars of the future.
look at PCG. out of bankruptcy within 45 days then to 20 by year end
"If you have 1-2 years to wait, EIX will be back up to 80, after all the dust settles"
"Here's what I posted just a measely hour ago:Shares of Edison International's (EIX) Southern California Edison fall 3.7% to $65.75 in extended trading following news that PG&E and Pacific Gas & Electric were suspending dividend payouts over potential liability from the California wildfires. Last week, Southern California Edison said it believed the investigations included ""the possible role of its facilities."" EIX is NOT cutting their dividend at this time, but the street is AFRAID they will follow suit and suspend it down the road. No one knows except EIX if they will or not."
Here's a post from the PCG message board: Rumor: PG&E up on speculation of limited liability in California wild fires $PCG @theflynews
"Utilities in CA are not an investment, only a losing proposition. Thank you socialist state."
This is not an investible stock because there are always wildfires in CA. and if this stock is going to react this way every time then no one should invest in it unless they want to lose money.
wow this is huge discount buy buy buy
"Another good rally for EIX, with 10 Year Treasury now up to 2.64%!! The chart looks even better then yesterday!! Bottoming process continues. Stay the EIX course, steady as she goes!!"
SCE monopolies the entire Ventura and Southern California can’t go wrong with this company and provides high dividends. EV is on the move that means more revenue for SCE.
EIX is down 5.44% to $52.52
Sounds like someone was reading my earlier post. They are finally coming in and scooping up the BARGAIN called EIX!!
EIX is going to be volatile for months. May be good trading stock between 62 and 63.
When Do I buy this? It looks like it's still melting down. I don't want to bet the house at $50 and have it drop to $25...
Approaching new 52 week low today. Not good. Stock still hasn't bottomed yet. Looking back at 3 year chart I noticed possible strong resistance line from breakout high in October 2016 at 62. If this is taken out possible move down to 56. I can't believe Big Money isn't buying this with both fists!!
"EIX and PCG are down sharply today on new ""pineapple express"" rainstorm related infrastructure damage and mudslide liability worries. By Thursday or early Friday we should know if the storm damage is substantial or not. If not, late Thursday or early Friday could be a good buying opportunities as both of these stocks are almost certainly going to rise 10-20% by Memorial Day with PCG rising more than EIX (but PCG pays no dividend)."
"Evidently whatever the news (that as yet to be revealed), is now fading FAST!!! Stock now only up .66."
California law makers are giving our tax money to solar company via tax subside and now forcing new construction to have solar. This distort the energy efficiency and not good to EIX. Could we Califonian start a proposition to stop state to give our tax money to solar?
49 and change!! Last time it was this low was mid 2015!! How could they go down soooooo much if they aren't involved in the recent fires???
"Looks like it will take around two more months or so for EIX's share price decline to stabilize and then another year for the price to recover, as the company faces potential liability damages of around 7 billion: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-13/edison-unit-faces-double-legal-whammy-from-fires-mudslides?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=bd&utm_campaign=headline&cmpId=yhoo.headline&yptr=yahoo"
"Wow! tough state for utilities. Both EIX, PCG going down. It' a different country. But people first."
"EPS is one of the hottest years in five. Can't even imagine what EIX Q3 will be. Huge, most likely why it decided to settle all it's outstanding Insurance Claims. One thing for sure 2021 Fire Season and 2022 will be low nothing left to BURN!"
"I understand the buy and hold for income mantra on this stock some of you tout but w-h-y is it going down? I bought this based on it being under consensus targets a-n-d to swipe the few day out dividend on March 26th at $59.863 and it's basically been a daily downer - 6.89% since my purchase. I'm a tiny investor with 1,000 shares but I've been in stocks before that keep going down and down and down. I hate to get out at the bottom but since I don't have a clue why its down I can't figure out what'll send it back northwards."
The stock market is full of BS.
This is the first time since early December that the stock has been over the 50 day moving average!!
"EIX rallying on pull back in short term yields on Ten Year, 2 year Treasuries, etc. Just bought some XLU due to this and Bottoming Process on the ETF. Love the dividend as well. Also, WHEN the overall Market sells off, Bonds will be purchased sending both XLU and good, old, EIX soaring!!!"
Now my electricity rate is rising because of this Newsom missmanagement. The forrest fire damage should have been paid by Federal and insurance companies instead of EIX stock holders and customers.
"Taking a look at the recent chart and the action today gets me HOPING the REAL bottom is trying to form here. Looking at the small rally in XLU also gives me some hope. With the overall market having a big time candlestick reversal yesterday, I think investors are looking for stocks that have been destroyed that have earnings and great prospects going forward (with dividends to boot). I think EIX has all those qualities, lawsuits notwithstanding!!"
"If they can take it from 70 bucks down to 45 in just two days, who's to say the Big Boys can't take it down to 25 next???"
"Another nice rally today for EIX. Much of it based on 10 year Treasury backing off a little bit more today, but continued strength from fantastic earnings!! Once blame for the Global Warming induced fires is placed on nature EIX will soar into the heavens (at least 10 points higher from here)."
"Hard to believe the stock is taking this HUGE of a hit with just speculation their facilities MAY have something to do with the fire. Remember folks, this was a Perfect Firestorm for S. CA. Tons of rain last winter producing TONS of extra vegetation, all of which dried out with no rain for over 7 months. Extremely strong Santa Anna winds also adding to Mayhem!! I don't like today's stock action, but will HOLD now waiting for better days ahead!!"
Just started a position in this boring stock. Great income. Not a traders/ get rich quick stock.
"Just noticed today's downgrade, which accounts for the big percentage fall from grace:CFRA LOWERS OPINION ON SHARES OF EDISON INTERNATIONAL TO HOLD FROM BUY9:49 am ET May 2, 2018 (CFRA) PrintWe raise our 12-month target price by $2 to $66 on higher peer valuations. We lower our '18 EPS estimate by $0.15 to $4.10 and '19's by $0.05 to $4.55. EIX posts Q1 EPS of $0.80 vs. $1.10, below our $0.98 estimate and the $0.91 S&P Capital IQ consensus. Higher operations & maintenance and parent corporate costs, a higher effective tax rate (excluding tax rate reduction), and other items were partly offset by higher FERC revenues in Q1. Our target price is a peer-discount 16.1X our '18 EPS estimate, which we think is warranted by our view of a below-peer three-year EPS growth rate coupled with liability risks surrounding 2017 wildfires. We see rising capital expenditures totaling $13.7 billion from 2018 through 2020 focused on the distribution system. As a result of this spending, We see a three-year compound annual rate base growth of 9.7%. EIX may get some protection from future wildfire risk under a bill being considered in California. The shares are yielding 3.7%."
"Long term dog, only good for trading."
"with all the fires over the years, I am shocked that there any trees left to burn. What a friggen tragedy. One of these businesses will survive, might as well be Edison. Prayers from Canada for all the people that are caught in this inferno."
Any insight on this would help
"I think I'll start a small position this am. Great div yield, well covered, nice steady DGR, no cuts ever. Reasonable debt and PR, under it's 5yr. blended P/E avg., decent cap-app possible. Fits into my early-retirement increasing div paycheck port. Works for me %^).."
