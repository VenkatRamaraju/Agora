What the heck is happening? Up 50% on no news?
They had some interesting insights about ORPH on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
you know what's before the strom coming?
No news so going back to previous level
Klinger and rsi say it’s going back up
Not sure should I hold it over night
"This is trading based on the exchange rate below our Danish listing, which ORPH should be at 5.37"
"need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 17, 2021 $7.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today."
"RVPH =CHEAPEST biotech OUT there ,next SAVA for your portfolio which went from $3 to $130(RVPH) MCap $46 m--a PHASE 3 company targeting several Blockbuster indications like Alzheimer ,Parkinson ,ADHD and so forth = Undiscovered Goldmine with 10 bagger upside potential guyshttps://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/8763/board/20210129182939-screenshot-2021-01-29-form-8-k-tenzing-acquisitio.png#+#+"
Closing @7 going up!!! Dont miss!!!
So with this promising news why is it tanking now??? Seems like it will be in red really bad
What is it???
Get in 7 is easy here !!!
"No announcement from the company. It would've been nice to see something, even if it was a same 36 data shown in a different light. An updated regarding the company's discussions with the FDA would've been nice too. I am sure they've had conversations. And finally, any updated regarding the EMA would be fantastic right about now."
This will break 10 + today
This daily drop doesn’t make any sense. Usually bad news is reflected in the short term and it doesn’t push it down for 10 days. Very boring
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pomerantz-law-firm-announces-filing-020300585.html I still don't see this as having much of an impact on it being priced at these levels. I see positive news coming out now to offset this
Just hang in there. The Aug 20 call option means something. Something Is brewing.. MM collecting cheap shares now
Why’s this trending right now on yahoo finance?
I am buying NOW!
"I’d like to initiate a class action law suit against all these law firms trying to benefit from ORPH shareholders and mislead them and prospect investors about investing in ORPH which has caused too much damage to current investors. The price has been tanking mainly from these announced law suits. The company is not done yet and since these crooks hope to milk the company, this means ORPH still has enough money to attract these attorneys"
"Going back to $75 as I said yesterday, solid financials, FDA & European approvals are on the way , bashers will learn lesson soon, as I mentioned Patience is key "
It will drop right after opening as there is no good news and dilution is imminent
$ROOT $HUT $JOBY $ANY $BLIN $PROG $AMC $BTBT $HVBT $WISH $SKIN $ORPH $SOFI#TOTHEMOON#APESTOGETHERSTRONG
"Once ORPH merges into Johnson and Johnson the drug will get immediate approval.I am suspicious that all US institutions are corrupt. FBI, IRS, and FDA to name just a few.O I forgot the SEC."
Why this stock doesn’t have any good news? All about the hundreds of law suits
I bought alot at $4 range and added 500 shares at $6.35. I'm average up. This stock should retest $23 in a month or 2.
"Just hold, patience will pay off"
I lost tons of money quickly selling $TPST and losing not selling $ORPH. Still need to learn trading.
Again 50 wow.....
There has to be a way to stop these law suit news.. it is too many and annoying .. no articles about the company whatsoever
"Dropping on very low volume. I’m not worried, but the volume does need to pick up. The investor call could have some interesting insights. I think this is a $7+ stock all day. The lawsuits are just noise!"
Will it turn green today?
I will buy back around $5
Is share dilution coming? They normally up the share price before announce share offering. Suspicious
Already 30% corrected from days high.. was it just a trap or a rumour?
the company is expected to publish its H1 Interim Report.
$AMC $ORPHREADY TO TAKE OFF!!!!
"Going on the past history of ORPH, I doubled down."
I believe this is worth $15 + .any of you do `?
Omg I forgot to sell at 7 cause I was visiting with my dad 
Moon tomorrow
Well looks like im a long term investor on this one bought at 17$ 
"Warren Buffett has said, ""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."""
What’s brewing!!!!!
50 Easy easy
The top is about to blow!
Cytr moving now
Big move on volume.Btw: what is ftd?
Things that make you say hmm. You got rid of the fat and now positive results. Planned or not planned.
So nothing #$%$itive coming out!!! Should take my losses and move on before this #$%$ crashes even more!!!
$GLTO much better play
9’s today
"There are lots of bag holders from the prior gap up that want to get out once they can get their money back. Once those are cleared out, we should be able to make a sustained move up."
i will never see my money back again. sp 23
My average is $6.39. Should I sell it for a loss now or wait?
Very deceiving and misleading
"Even without any news, based on its financials and cash in hand, ORPH still worth at least $20 plus"
Shorts have small botos
European approval
"Don’t underestimate this company value, share was at $75 a month ago, it will go back, PATIENCE is the key"
Why the pop up ?????
we fly soon 
Management hasn’t said a word. This is either very bad or something really good coming!!! Which one is it?!!! I am thinking to buy more
It will go back to $80 plus this time
Stay patient till a very fine morning with NEWS
Already fizzling. So frustrating!
Stay tuned.............this can go up 500% in a day.......extremely oversold by algos.................GL

"Type A Meeting – is a meeting that is ""immediately necessary for an otherwise stalled drug development program to proceed."" This type of meeting refers to meetings to resolve disputes, talk about clinical holds, special protocols. Think of them as a ""Type A Personality"" meetings. They should be scheduled within 30 days of the time that FDA gets a written request for a meeting."

Earnings report: Loss -454M Danish Kroner. Going to fire 100 staff. Zero assets left. Debt is 4x cash. Ready for liquidation.
"So, the class action never had any merit… The company never misled anyone. anyone. The crooks are the FDA."
"When you start tracking ftd's and borrow rates you'll see why ORPH moved today and not later in the month. That's why I place RELI and a few others to start doing runs within a week or two. It's all in sec ftd reports and fintel. Mix with good dd, the answers come clear"

"Orphazyme A/S has a target action date of June 17 for its NDA for arimoclomol to treat Niemann-Pick Disease Type C. Originally there was a PDUFA date in March, but the FDA extended the review period under a standard extension to complete the NDA review. The NDA remains under Priority Review and does not impede eligibility for a Pediatric Rare Disease Priority Review Voucher. The drug had previously received the FDA’s Fast-Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designations for NPC as well as Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations."
#$%$
Any law firm hasn’t sued ORPH yet?
https://orphazyme.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/orphazyme-presents-36-month-data-supporting-durable-response
Orph has solid company with tremendous products in pipeline for approval from authorities EU and FDA. Details analysis as required by FDA has not been shared with shareholders. I believe there is some big news to come in coming days and the share will be skyrocket.
The algos will push this up again to $25..........and all law suites will disappear.................GL
Today is the day
"Sold everything, accepted my loss. Close this chapter and never look back."
"So again, what do these lawfirms trying to do by suing ? Is this going to take the price back where it was? Very confusing"
Here comes the rocket. Going in
Buy the dip this stock is going back to the moon!

"This is ftd covering. And if you think this is a lot, look into RELI. 750k ftd's nested on a single day May 17th with a 40% borrow rate. Stocks move for a reason. Do your DD"

EU approval expected in 4th quater
$GLTO is the new play. Way better financials and future outlook than ORPH.
"You can thank management for ALL of your losses. If they simply informed investors during trading day that they did not receive approval, we all could have mitigated losses. Instead, they kept that information and FORCED you to lose AT LEAST 50% of your investment overnight! And to this day, management is not communicating with shareholders! This is a sinking ship on fire after hitting a radioactive iceberg."
Analysts price target $22.31

Only a matter of time until this thing pops.

i bought at 70$:(
"Take your PROFIT & Run on Pump& Dump deadcat bounce today!!~You will not see this price for the next 11 months. Massive dilution is on the way cuz ORPH is BLEEDING Q/Q, has no pipeline other than a tiny mkt share drug that rejected by FDA 3-times already since 2020."

"This thing needs to fly. If positive news came out and it didn’t move that much and actually went down yesterday because of shorts and other hedge fund manipulators, it should break out due to all positive things coming through. Can’t believe this is controlled by people who just want to force it on one direction."
"So far, no news!"

"Will tomorrow be a great surprise for Longs or a bad disappointment?? From the latest PR, it looks like something good is brewing!! Any insight??"
I heard about ORPH the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Next round 75% may be .. if we are lucky some good news and then boom… sorry.. just being optimistic
"A lot of Call-options at 7,5$."
"The data from the 36-month period had a p-value of 0.046 (previously calculated at p=0.0537). For those who don't know, a p-value less than 0.05 is statistically significant. The EMA approval is looking better and better."
The postpone of publication date of H1 results may mean something new?
OMG the selloff continue
Lot of Call option 7.50USD
"EU or FDA news could pop up anytime from now, hold your horses folks"
I am stuck with 15
Last call to get in.. the drop today was expected because some day traders making profit.. next will be very fortunate.. the chart tells the story.. add to that good things brewing
"Orphazyme's shareholders deserve better. Management appears to be sleeping at the wheel. We need information about their latest conversations with the FDA, updates regarding the European approval, restructuring, and additional information about the 36-month trial. Very disappointed."
FDA Approved ?
"Told you, don’t sell at cheap….solid company and huge potential"
Highest i see this stock has hit was $21. Where and when was it in the $70’s?I’m interested in the upside of this company and all they need is some good news and they could popI just don’t see where this was anything more then $21
Within one hour cytr will double
These law firms are very aggravating. How much money do they think will get from such a company with a stock that does down every day!
This volume needs to be the same as this morning if it’s to go up. It’s about 200k to 1mil volume less per minute for the last two hours from this morning and volume getting lower amd lower
diamond hands always win
BLAST tomorrow
I couldn’t be happier with the daily emails I get from (http://Pick-stocks.com). They give me the best daily advice based on stock market news and help me make wiser decisions when it comes to investing. An absolute must for any investor!
bought at $19 and average down today to $9. after a rough few weeks I am feeling very optimistic again!
What is the good news that is causing this to go up???
i got the need for speed 
Let’s break $6.68
$ORPH reached $70! Go LPCN.
OK they have $600 million in cash........without debt.......with the share count of 35 million shares gives SP of $17.......just based on cash......They have reduced the work force......The possibility is also good they may get approval in EU and at some point in US.........Have said above the stock should trade at at least $15 and above with no PE applied..............You heard it here first................................................GL
Hold your shares. Long way to go.
come in folks lets pump it back to 77 dollars lmao
Going back to $75
"No product, huge debts, No FDA approval and who will wait till 2022 for European approval thatmay reject after US? Meanwhile~ secondary offering is imminent that significantly dilutes the value of shares as Analysts downgraded to $3 last June after the FDA rejected its tiny marketshare of it's drug."
#ORPH help
"Take your PROFIT & Run on deadcat Pump& Dump bounce today!!~cuz you will not see this price for the next 11 months.ORPH is BLEEDING Q/Q, has barely any pipeline drug that only REJECTED by FDA."
"Solid balance sheet and huge future potential, never trust bashers, this stock worth more than $100"
squeeze time

"Up on no news and down on no news. If not 50% up today then this won’t continue. I want it $15 at least to believe, but we know this is fake spike. I hope I am wrong"

Never sell under $100

What happened to the 6.51 pumpers? Back to the 4's and the norm.
"strong buy, hold tight "
How does a stock go from $5 to $78 to $5 in a month?
Does anyone know how many shares traded for $77 on June 10th?
"Analysts Warned ORPH: “capital sufficiency is a real headwind for ORPH and Downgraded to $3 ""”ORPH investors can expect a secondary offering soon that significantly dilutes the value of any shares, Without any products to sell, the company burned through $101 million in 2020. It began 2021 with just $26 million in cash, so investors can expect a secondary offering soon that significantly dilutes thevalue of any shares they're holding now."
Closing day ahead be ready fo big move now
Very annoying.. even if it will hit $35 soon.. I’ll just have to wait for what’s brewing … very rewarding
Whoever sells under $80 is just giving his money away. IMHO.
Type A meeting requested with the FDA in coming weeks. Patience...

"Check news on yahoo ,that might be reason today about Sec investigation..."
They want your shares… Are you selling? Good.
(http://Pick-stocks.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
"Looking forward to the European approval and FDA update. “Following on the outcomes from the 12-month double-blind phase, which indicated a clinically meaningful effect on disease progression, these longer-term data provide an encouraging picture that arimoclomol could deliver a sustained benefit and consistent safety profile over time,” said Marc Patterson, MD, Professor of Neurology, Pediatrics and Medical Genetics, Mayo Clinic Children’s Center in Rochester, MN.Data from the 36-month period support the findings from the 12-month double-blind period, which showed a clinically meaningful difference on the 5-domain NPCCSS, with a significant p-value of 0.046 (previously calculated at p=0.0537)."""
Get ready for that 50+ pop incomming any moment now!
"ORPH even delayed the earning report to 8/30/21 from previous dated 8/24/21.They're bleeding quarter to quarter, Read SEC file~ no working capital left, Analysts sees massive stock offering any moment. The stock is worth no more than $1~$2 ."
I thought it is a pump and dump but todays movement/volume indicates different sign. Possibly it got under good market maker with potential good news in horizon. It should have a long uptrend move for months. But the road will be very bumpy with intraday swings.
Buy GLTO. it's much better than ORPH and also danish company. has enough cash to last until 2024.

About time that this turd dumped back under $5 which is where it started before that insane run up before the pdufa date. You can rest assure that it has been heavily shorted between $5 and $9 as the smart money knows they are gonna have to do massive dilution or worse will be BK. Add the tax loss selling factor in Q4 and we should be in the $3s then $2s soon enough.

"About Niemann-Pick disease type CNiemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a rare, genetic, progressively debilitating, and often fatal neurodegenerative disease. It belongs to a family known as lysosomal storage diseases and is caused by mutations leading to defective NPC protein. As a consequence, lipids that are normally cleared by the lysosome accumulate in tissues and organs, including the brain, and drive the disease pathology. We estimate the incidence of NPC to be one in 100,000 live births and the number of NPC patients in the United States and in Europe to be approximately 1,800 individuals. There are no approved treatments for NPC in the U.S.About Arimoclomol Arimoclomol is an investigational drug candidate that amplifies the production of heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSPs can rescue defective misfolded proteins, clear protein aggregates, and improve the function of lysosomes. Arimoclomol is administered orally, and has now been studied in 10 phase 1, four phase 2 and three pivotal phase 2/3 trials. Arimoclomol has received orphan drug designation (ODD) for NPC in the US and EU. Arimoclomol has received fast-track designation (FTD) breakthrough therapy designation (BTD) and rare-pediatric disease designation (RPDD) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for NPC. On June 17, 2021, Orphazyme received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding its New Drug Application for arimoclomol for the treatment of NPC.About Orphazyme A/S Orphazyme is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the heat shock protein response for the treatment of rare diseases. The company is harnessing amplification of heat shock proteins (or HSPs) in order to develop and commercialize novel therapeutics for diseases caused by protein misfolding, protein aggregation, and lysosomal dysfunction. Arimoclomol, the company’s lead candidate, is in clinical development for orphan diseases including Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) and Gaucher disease. Orphazyme is headquartered in Denmark and has operations in the U.S. and Switzerland. ADSs representing Orphazyme’s shares are listed on Nasdaq U.S. (ORPH) and its shares are listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen (ORPHA)."
