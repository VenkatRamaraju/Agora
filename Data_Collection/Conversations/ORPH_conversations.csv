Either they are going to declare BK wiping out the common share holders and the debt holders will take over the assets or they are going to have to massively dilute the stock IF they can find the money.
"70 bucks to 3’s is cheap enough, especially with a drug approval very possible. Hoping for a huge gap opening soon."
My average is $6.39. Should I sell it for a loss now or wait?

"About Niemann-Pick disease type CNiemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a rare, genetic, progressively debilitating, and often fatal neurodegenerative disease. It belongs to a family known as lysosomal storage diseases and is caused by mutations leading to defective NPC protein. As a consequence, lipids that are normally cleared by the lysosome accumulate in tissues and organs, including the brain, and drive the disease pathology. We estimate the incidence of NPC to be one in 100,000 live births and the number of NPC patients in the United States and in Europe to be approximately 1,800 individuals. There are no approved treatments for NPC in the U.S.About Arimoclomol Arimoclomol is an investigational drug candidate that amplifies the production of heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSPs can rescue defective misfolded proteins, clear protein aggregates, and improve the function of lysosomes. Arimoclomol is administered orally, and has now been studied in 10 phase 1, four phase 2 and three pivotal phase 2/3 trials. Arimoclomol has received orphan drug designation (ODD) for NPC in the US and EU. Arimoclomol has received fast-track designation (FTD) breakthrough therapy designation (BTD) and rare-pediatric disease designation (RPDD) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for NPC. On June 17, 2021, Orphazyme received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding its New Drug Application for arimoclomol for the treatment of NPC.About Orphazyme A/S Orphazyme is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the heat shock protein response for the treatment of rare diseases. The company is harnessing amplification of heat shock proteins (or HSPs) in order to develop and commercialize novel therapeutics for diseases caused by protein misfolding, protein aggregation, and lysosomal dysfunction. Arimoclomol, the company’s lead candidate, is in clinical development for orphan diseases including Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) and Gaucher disease. Orphazyme is headquartered in Denmark and has operations in the U.S. and Switzerland. ADSs representing Orphazyme’s shares are listed on Nasdaq U.S. (ORPH) and its shares are listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen (ORPHA)."

What is happening? Volume is growing fast too..
"Dropping on very low volume. I’m not worried, but the volume does need to pick up. The investor call could have some interesting insights. I think this is a $7+ stock all day. The lawsuits are just noise!"

"This stock is known for big moves...I enter at 4,86 to see what tomorrow can bring and if they will release a PR on the patents...and how the market will react...GLTA :) and we're now number 5 or 6 on yahoo so if we get to top 4 maybe we will get more eyes :)"
Is share dilution coming? They normally up the share price before announce share offering. Suspicious
Orphazyme are negotiating with Johnson&Johnson for a take over. Thats why they pushed their financial report
"nada. looking a today's spike volume, there will be a lot of new bag holders to join the rest of you."

Any news?
Good morning $77♬
"This thing needs to fly. If positive news came out and it didn’t move that much and actually went down yesterday because of shorts and other hedge fund manipulators, it should break out due to all positive things coming through. Can’t believe this is controlled by people who just want to force it on one direction."
"need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 17, 2021 $7.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today."

I heard about ORPH the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
At least $7 if after everyone knew what has happened.
I think we all agree with that many $7.5 options this will fly again soon. I advise we buy more now
Closes $5.50 then goes to $10+ AH tonight. Tomorrow $20
They had some interesting insights about ORPH on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
i bought at 70$:(
"With $600 millions cash with solid financials, ORPH could jump anytime from now, huge future potential & growth"
Nice … I didn’t get involved but that jump was nice ..
https://patentcenter.uspto.gov/#!/applications/16879198/ifw/docs

"$WIMI $ORPH you will know when it does, there won’t be any question."
I bought alot at $4 range and added 500 shares at $6.35. I'm average up. This stock should retest $23 in a month or 2.
Good reddit More sell
Analysts price target $22.31
P&D
"Comparing the stock price at Copenhagen market, in the US the price is undervaluated by around 7%!!!"
Tomorrow 20
How did this go to 77 on nothing ? Now it’s the real deal and it’s not surging
I'm still holding! This will shake short term trader and bag holders out. I'm not sell until it break $23!
"any biologist in this group? I am not one. Orph works with meds for protein folding disorders, which some doctors claim is a concern with covid (either natural or vaccine, not sure). orph also involved with niemann-pick. MSM just starting to discuss Marburg virus, which needs Niemann-Pick protein for infection. seems like two big markets down the road. anyone knowledgeable have thoughts?"
Will touch 
"I hold from very green to very red, back to very green, now red again lol. Man patient is hard."
Will hit at least 5 by noon!
Holding for 100
some law firms are sending me the class action case against ORPH. Should I join them to sue this company? Anyone has been joining the class action and any thought?
"Sold last week, the positive news came as a surprise, but as things stand now no regrets."
I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Pick-stocks.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
I told you after I cut a big loss it will fly.... LOL man this is hurt.
Look at thatMy money justJumped ORPH a cliff.
Orph drugs save lives. EU approval expected in 4 quarter.
"I'm from Denmark where the company is located - this could go crazy again, like it happened in June where the stock went all the way to 77 USD."
next week meeting with FDA must be good ..
Do not sell this is my advice for you long

"There are lots of bag holders from the prior gap up that want to get out once they can get their money back. Once those are cleared out, we should be able to make a sustained move up."
No news so going back to previous level
to the moon
may see 4ish . Buying below 4 is a good idea imo.
"3 Wall Street analysts have issued ratings and price targets for Orphazyme A/S in the last 12 months. Their average twelve-month price target is $16.00, predicting that the stock has a possible upside of 189.86%."

who is buying all big blocks???
"Tomorrow morning is big news, going back to $75 , Patience is the key"
EU approval could be comming any day since we see this movement when the market is closed!
Whoever sells under $80 is just giving his money away. IMHO.
What do you think ORPH will do today? Thumbs up if it’s going to be green or thumbs down if it’s going to be red.
Go back to 77
something is happening. it's time
20$ coming soon
if this stock gets volume it will explode - there are no shares available to float
This is the LAST TIME you will see $BIIB this low. Did you see that $48 million BUY yesterday? We could close WELL above $305 today.

I hope they listened. The trend is BULLISH again. If u can't tell. NEW ANALYST Neddham initiated a BUY coverage Yesterday with a target price of $400! $400 is kinda low to me but at least it's better than where $BIIB is now! Free money  imo.

"Does not happen often but, occasionally, an FDA type A meeting concludes with a conditional approval and required post-study. Could see that occurring in this instant."
"Type A Meeting – is a meeting that is ""immediately necessary for an otherwise stalled drug development program to proceed."" This type of meeting refers to meetings to resolve disputes, talk about clinical holds, special protocols. Think of them as a ""Type A Personality"" meetings. They should be scheduled within 30 days of the time that FDA gets a written request for a meeting."
