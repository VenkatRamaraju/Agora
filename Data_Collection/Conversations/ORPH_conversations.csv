"This is trading based on the exchange rate below our Danish listing, which ORPH should be at 5.37"
Why all the pm dumping
"70 bucks to 3’s is cheap enough, especially with a drug approval very possible. Hoping for a huge gap opening soon."
I hope this thing gets halted again 22 times and we see $20 mininun
"any biologist in this group? I am not one. Orph works with meds for protein folding disorders, which some doctors claim is a concern with covid (either natural or vaccine, not sure). orph also involved with niemann-pick. MSM just starting to discuss Marburg virus, which needs Niemann-Pick protein for infection. seems like two big markets down the road. anyone knowledgeable have thoughts?"
"This stock is known for big moves...I enter at 4,86 to see what tomorrow can bring and if they will release a PR on the patents...and how the market will react...GLTA :) and we're now number 5 or 6 on yahoo so if we get to top 4 maybe we will get more eyes :)"

"Guys, check out http://the-alphatrader.com/. They have been crushing it lately while ORPH barley does anything at all."
"This thing needs to fly. If positive news came out and it didn’t move that much and actually went down yesterday because of shorts and other hedge fund manipulators, it should break out due to all positive things coming through. Can’t believe this is controlled by people who just want to force it on one direction."

Holding for 100
They announced they have roughly 10 mill dollars left in cash...That means they have no way of getting anything approved without finding more money somewhere. Either they crash or another company buys them up. The odds of this going well are terrible :(

"About Niemann-Pick disease type CNiemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a rare, genetic, progressively debilitating, and often fatal neurodegenerative disease. It belongs to a family known as lysosomal storage diseases and is caused by mutations leading to defective NPC protein. As a consequence, lipids that are normally cleared by the lysosome accumulate in tissues and organs, including the brain, and drive the disease pathology. We estimate the incidence of NPC to be one in 100,000 live births and the number of NPC patients in the United States and in Europe to be approximately 1,800 individuals. There are no approved treatments for NPC in the U.S.About Arimoclomol Arimoclomol is an investigational drug candidate that amplifies the production of heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSPs can rescue defective misfolded proteins, clear protein aggregates, and improve the function of lysosomes. Arimoclomol is administered orally, and has now been studied in 10 phase 1, four phase 2 and three pivotal phase 2/3 trials. Arimoclomol has received orphan drug designation (ODD) for NPC in the US and EU. Arimoclomol has received fast-track designation (FTD) breakthrough therapy designation (BTD) and rare-pediatric disease designation (RPDD) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for NPC. On June 17, 2021, Orphazyme received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding its New Drug Application for arimoclomol for the treatment of NPC.About Orphazyme A/S Orphazyme is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the heat shock protein response for the treatment of rare diseases. The company is harnessing amplification of heat shock proteins (or HSPs) in order to develop and commercialize novel therapeutics for diseases caused by protein misfolding, protein aggregation, and lysosomal dysfunction. Arimoclomol, the company’s lead candidate, is in clinical development for orphan diseases including Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) and Gaucher disease. Orphazyme is headquartered in Denmark and has operations in the U.S. and Switzerland. ADSs representing Orphazyme’s shares are listed on Nasdaq U.S. (ORPH) and its shares are listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen (ORPHA)."
Is invtr_oc a positive shareholder OR negative short seller? I think the BARRAGE of his negative comments can answer this.

Either they are going to declare BK wiping out the common share holders and the debt holders will take over the assets or they are going to have to massively dilute the stock IF they can find the money.
news is leaking. stock was $70 and was not too long ago.
"I'm from Denmark where the company is located - this could go crazy again, like it happened in June where the stock went all the way to 77 USD."
