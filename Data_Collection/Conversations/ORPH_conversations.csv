"There are lots of bag holders from the prior gap up that want to get out once they can get their money back. Once those are cleared out, we should be able to make a sustained move up."
"new publication date for Orphazyme’s Interim Report H1 2021, which is now being made public on August 31, 2021 (previously: August 24, 2021)."
"About Niemann-Pick disease type CNiemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a rare, genetic, progressively debilitating, and often fatal neurodegenerative disease. It belongs to a family known as lysosomal storage diseases and is caused by mutations leading to defective NPC protein. As a consequence, lipids that are normally cleared by the lysosome accumulate in tissues and organs, including the brain, and drive the disease pathology. We estimate the incidence of NPC to be one in 100,000 live births and the number of NPC patients in the United States and in Europe to be approximately 1,800 individuals. There are no approved treatments for NPC in the U.S.About Arimoclomol Arimoclomol is an investigational drug candidate that amplifies the production of heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSPs can rescue defective misfolded proteins, clear protein aggregates, and improve the function of lysosomes. Arimoclomol is administered orally, and has now been studied in 10 phase 1, four phase 2 and three pivotal phase 2/3 trials. Arimoclomol has received orphan drug designation (ODD) for NPC in the US and EU. Arimoclomol has received fast-track designation (FTD) breakthrough therapy designation (BTD) and rare-pediatric disease designation (RPDD) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for NPC. On June 17, 2021, Orphazyme received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding its New Drug Application for arimoclomol for the treatment of NPC.About Orphazyme A/S Orphazyme is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the heat shock protein response for the treatment of rare diseases. The company is harnessing amplification of heat shock proteins (or HSPs) in order to develop and commercialize novel therapeutics for diseases caused by protein misfolding, protein aggregation, and lysosomal dysfunction. Arimoclomol, the company’s lead candidate, is in clinical development for orphan diseases including Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) and Gaucher disease. Orphazyme is headquartered in Denmark and has operations in the U.S. and Switzerland. ADSs representing Orphazyme’s shares are listed on Nasdaq U.S. (ORPH) and its shares are listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen (ORPHA)."
They had some interesting insights about ORPH on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.

Orph drugs save lives. EU approval expected in 4 quarter.
It’s coming
"No product, huge debts, No FDA approval and who will wait till 2022 for European approval thatmay reject after US? Meanwhile~ secondary offering is imminent that significantly dilutes the value of shares as Analysts downgraded to $3 last June after the FDA rejected its tiny marketshare of it's drug."
What is happening? Volume is growing fast too..
$1 coming!
"This thing needs to fly. If positive news came out and it didn’t move that much and actually went down yesterday because of shorts and other hedge fund manipulators, it should break out due to all positive things coming through. Can’t believe this is controlled by people who just want to force it on one direction."

"Tomorrow morning is big news, going back to $75 , Patience is the key"
I heard about ORPH the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Me no worry. Short 10,000 shares in your account."
"I'm from Denmark where the company is located - this could go crazy again, like it happened in June where the stock went all the way to 77 USD."
Eu approval expected in 4th QUARTER
This is the LAST TIME you will see $BIIB this low. Did you see that $48 million BUY yesterday? We could close WELL above $305 today.

Something coming. Looks like someone knows something.
"any biologist in this group? I am not one. Orph works with meds for protein folding disorders, which some doctors claim is a concern with covid (either natural or vaccine, not sure). orph also involved with niemann-pick. MSM just starting to discuss Marburg virus, which needs Niemann-Pick protein for infection. seems like two big markets down the road. anyone knowledgeable have thoughts?"

I thought it is a pump and dump but todays movement/volume indicates different sign. Possibly it got under good market maker with potential good news in horizon. It should have a long uptrend move for months. But the road will be very bumpy with intraday swings.
we fly 
50$ here we come again
"need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 17, 2021 $7.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today."
may see 4ish . Buying below 4 is a good idea imo.
I'm still holding! This will shake short term trader and bag holders out. I'm not sell until it break $23!
@SAPKOTA What is the Meeting with FDA abut please ?

"Check news on yahoo ,that might be reason today about Sec investigation..."

"Does not happen often but, occasionally, an FDA type A meeting concludes with a conditional approval and required post-study. Could see that occurring in this instant."
"nada. looking a today's spike volume, there will be a lot of new bag holders to join the rest of you."
Will touch

"This is ftd covering. And if you think this is a lot, look into RELI. 750k ftd's nested on a single day May 17th with a 40% borrow rate. Stocks move for a reason. Do your DD"
it.s time to go up!!
What do you think ORPH will do today? Thumbs up if it’s going to be green or thumbs down if it’s going to be red.
Go back to 77
"When you start tracking ftd's and borrow rates you'll see why ORPH moved today and not later in the month. That's why I place RELI and a few others to start doing runs within a week or two. It's all in sec ftd reports and fintel. Mix with good dd, the answers come clear"
orph news under Summary tab. I wouldn't short this stock.

Look at thatMy money justJumped ORPH a cliff.

some law firms are sending me the class action case against ORPH. Should I join them to sue this company? Anyone has been joining the class action and any thought?
"Google the following company all received CRL recently, see their wording $ACAD $ARDX $ATNX $ATXI $CRMD $ETON $FGEN $ITRM $MDWD $ORPH $PLX $PRVB $SESN $SPPI"
Either they are going to declare BK wiping out the common share holders and the debt holders will take over the assets or they are going to have to massively dilute the stock IF they can find the money.
Never sell under $100

I think we all agree with that many $7.5 options this will fly again soon. I advise we buy more now
Orphazyme are negotiating with Johnson&Johnson for a take over. Thats why they pushed their financial report
"This is easy going to 20+ tomorrow and then down again. Buy now, sell tomorrow, be happy."
"RELI will move, you'll see. ORPH moved for the same reason RELI will. 2 good quarter earnings in a row. 37% borrow rate. Naked shorting. Another pr catalyst any day now. Keep your eyes open"
