"It's not hope, it's fundamentally undervalued. Fourth-quarter EU approval is the ticket.Squeeze baby squeeze."
Orphazyme are negotiating with Johnson&Johnson for a take over. Thats why they pushed their financial report
I hope One day will go 20.
Whoever sells under $80 is just giving his money away. IMHO.
"About Niemann-Pick disease type CNiemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a rare, genetic, progressively debilitating, and often fatal neurodegenerative disease. It belongs to a family known as lysosomal storage diseases and is caused by mutations leading to defective NPC protein. As a consequence, lipids that are normally cleared by the lysosome accumulate in tissues and organs, including the brain, and drive the disease pathology. We estimate the incidence of NPC to be one in 100,000 live births and the number of NPC patients in the United States and in Europe to be approximately 1,800 individuals. There are no approved treatments for NPC in the U.S.About Arimoclomol Arimoclomol is an investigational drug candidate that amplifies the production of heat shock proteins (HSPs). HSPs can rescue defective misfolded proteins, clear protein aggregates, and improve the function of lysosomes. Arimoclomol is administered orally, and has now been studied in 10 phase 1, four phase 2 and three pivotal phase 2/3 trials. Arimoclomol has received orphan drug designation (ODD) for NPC in the US and EU. Arimoclomol has received fast-track designation (FTD) breakthrough therapy designation (BTD) and rare-pediatric disease designation (RPDD) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for NPC. On June 17, 2021, Orphazyme received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA regarding its New Drug Application for arimoclomol for the treatment of NPC.About Orphazyme A/S Orphazyme is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering the heat shock protein response for the treatment of rare diseases. The company is harnessing amplification of heat shock proteins (or HSPs) in order to develop and commercialize novel therapeutics for diseases caused by protein misfolding, protein aggregation, and lysosomal dysfunction. Arimoclomol, the company’s lead candidate, is in clinical development for orphan diseases including Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) and Gaucher disease. Orphazyme is headquartered in Denmark and has operations in the U.S. and Switzerland. ADSs representing Orphazyme’s shares are listed on Nasdaq U.S. (ORPH) and its shares are listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen (ORPHA)."

I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Pick-stocks.com)! I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!

50$ here we come again
"ohh boy , can yu imagine what may happen the sp happen tomorrow morning if tonight , wsbs or amc gmes boyz hear the story of this baby which had a spike of 77 fter a huge squezze in june ? lol."
They announced they have roughly 10 mill dollars left in cash...That means they have no way of getting anything approved without finding more money somewhere. Either they crash or another company buys them up. The odds of this going well are terrible :(
Great news today boys read up.
I told you after I cut a big loss it will fly.... LOL man this is hurt.
Do not sell this is my advice for you long
okay what is new this time?
"So much strength, y'all went for the doors during the dip. I'm doubling down cause this is a winner.$WIMi $ORPH"

"Type A Meeting – is a meeting that is ""immediately necessary for an otherwise stalled drug development program to proceed."" This type of meeting refers to meetings to resolve disputes, talk about clinical holds, special protocols. Think of them as a ""Type A Personality"" meetings. They should be scheduled within 30 days of the time that FDA gets a written request for a meeting."
Going to 77$ again?
"This thing needs to fly. If positive news came out and it didn’t move that much and actually went down yesterday because of shorts and other hedge fund manipulators, it should break out due to all positive things coming through. Can’t believe this is controlled by people who just want to force it on one direction."
$4.50 eod. Reversing now.
"If you’re looking for a short and sweet guide to the day’s biggest news, I recommend (http://Pick-stocks.com). They breakdown the most important pre-market news and it only takes a few minutes to read."

"70 bucks to 3’s is cheap enough, especially with a drug approval very possible. Hoping for a huge gap opening soon."
Good morning $77♬

"too many catalysts coming up not to invest some more here..any announcement takes this to $ 15-20..several announcements togethertake this to $ 25-50...with potential quick rise above..Heck, #ORPH went to $ 60.plus at one time before coming back to earth..not missing my moon shot for a lousy $9 buck investment"
Earnings report: Loss -454M Danish Kroner. Going to fire 100 staff. Zero assets left. Debt is 4x cash. Ready for liquidation.

something is happening. it's time
"Does not happen often but, occasionally, an FDA type A meeting concludes with a conditional approval and required post-study. Could see that occurring in this instant."
The calm before the storm. Get ready for 50% jump shortly

Either they are going to declare BK wiping out the common share holders and the debt holders will take over the assets or they are going to have to massively dilute the stock IF they can find the money.

I heard about ORPH the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"any biologist in this group? I am not one. Orph works with meds for protein folding disorders, which some doctors claim is a concern with covid (either natural or vaccine, not sure). orph also involved with niemann-pick. MSM just starting to discuss Marburg virus, which needs Niemann-Pick protein for infection. seems like two big markets down the road. anyone knowledgeable have thoughts?"
This company has no clue
$17 next week if news is good..
They just filed a $75M shares offering.... we going to see shares drop next week.
I hope this thing gets halted again 22 times and we see $20 mininun
