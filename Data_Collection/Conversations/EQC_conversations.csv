Sam You Sure Know What You Are Doing. Why Don't You Show OPI What To Do?
What is happening to this year dividend?
"Equity Commonwealth buying Monmouth is a good deal for shareholders of both companies. It allows EQC to complete the transition from office properties to industrial properties and deploy their $3 billion of cash. EQC will be able to use their cash to add buildings and parking lots to existing land that Monmouth owns, payoff Monmouth's preferred shares and invest in new industrial properties through Monmouth's connections to builders of new industrial buildings. Monmouth's shareholders get to share in the upside of the merged companies instead of getting a one-time cash payment and not have anymore upside. With leverage and all of EQC's cash used in new deals, this company will likely generate a significantly higher dividend yield than Monmouth has now if the shares don't go up value. What will likely happen is that the shares will rise as the dividend eventually rises over the next four years or so."

"Book value about 25.65 and it was announced May 5th EQC taking over MNR. MNR is a high quality company. Result will be a high quality realestate company. I think EQC will start paying a cash dividend after the merger. Overall, good for both companies. Sam Zell is top quality."

"I am curious. How is it that EQC, a REIT, keeps selling properties & accumulating cash, but they have no significant dividend distributions? The cool thing is that they have huge reserves and equity. But can a REIT do that??"
"zell is in a win-win position, as usual...If MNR votes against merger,EQC gets $72M ($1 a Eqc per share) as break-up fee. GO SAM!"

"Interesting thoughts from Whitney Tilson's email today regarding Sam Zell and inflation. I am a big fan of Sam Zell. The guy has the nickname the ""Grave Dancer,"" as for decades he has been a buyer of distressed properties and made billions. According to this Bloomberg article, Sam Zell is seeing inflation everywhere, and has bought gold as a hedge – something he says he used to knock others for doing.""Obviously one of the natural reactions is to buy gold,"" he said in a Bloomberg Television interview. ""It feels very funny because I've spent my career talking about why would you want to own gold? It has no income, it costs to store. And yet, when you see the debasement of the currency, you say, what am I going to hold on to?""Zell, 79, said he's concerned not only about the U.S. dollar but other countries printing money as well, and questioned whether inflation will be transitory, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated last week. ""Oh boy, we're seeing it all over the place,"" Zell said of inflation. ""You read about lumber prices, but we're seeing it in all of our businesses. The obvious bottlenecks in the supply chain arena are pushing up prices. It's very reminiscent of the '70s.""So Sam's worried about inflation and EQC is buying MNR. Interesting"

Seems Like Something Is Going On. Price Up On Heavy Volume?
"I would actually vote against this merger as a Monmouth owner, I have had this stock since it was 5.50 per share, and have reinvested dividends for over 20 years.Not only has the price of he stock risen, but with the dividends, it has been one of my favorite stocks that I own. After researching this company, I just do not see the same growth possibilities, unless something changes after his merger."
"Distribute $25 cash per ahare and liquidate....Stop chasing this. Im a NO vote on ""merger""!"
