Good Deal!
"With $3 billion in cash, no debt to grow mnr portfolio!!! Zell is soooo good, and trusted!"
"Distribute $25 cash per ahare and liquidate....Stop chasing this. Im a NO vote on ""merger""!"
Looks like no Special Dividend this year unless they declare during earnings?
Hope to see another nice dividend! It should happen soon.
"zell is in a win-win position, as usual...If MNR votes against merger,EQC gets $72M ($1 a Eqc per share) as break-up fee. GO SAM!"
Cash In The Bank Is Almost Equal To Market Cap.???????????? No Debt.
No Merger. GOOD. Collect That Fee!
Thanks for the $3.50 per share dividend!!Keep up the good work EQC.
Let it go Sam and collect $62M. Let Sternlich pay top of the market cash price.
"Interesting thoughts from Whitney Tilson's email today regarding Sam Zell and inflation. I am a big fan of Sam Zell. The guy has the nickname the ""Grave Dancer,"" as for decades he has been a buyer of distressed properties and made billions. According to this Bloomberg article, Sam Zell is seeing inflation everywhere, and has bought gold as a hedge â€“ something he says he used to knock others for doing.""Obviously one of the natural reactions is to buy gold,"" he said in a Bloomberg Television interview. ""It feels very funny because I've spent my career talking about why would you want to own gold? It has no income, it costs to store. And yet, when you see the debasement of the currency, you say, what am I going to hold on to?""Zell, 79, said he's concerned not only about the U.S. dollar but other countries printing money as well, and questioned whether inflation will be transitory, as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated last week. ""Oh boy, we're seeing it all over the place,"" Zell said of inflation. ""You read about lumber prices, but we're seeing it in all of our businesses. The obvious bottlenecks in the supply chain arena are pushing up prices. It's very reminiscent of the '70s.""So Sam's worried about inflation and EQC is buying MNR. Interesting"
What is happening to this year dividend?
Sam Should Buy OPI.
Sam Don't Pay Too Much For This Company!
"Their equity value decreased about $400 mm, where did it go? Anybody noticed that?"
"Equity Commonwealth buying Monmouth is a good deal for shareholders of both companies. It allows EQC to complete the transition from office properties to industrial properties and deploy their $3 billion of cash. EQC will be able to use their cash to add buildings and parking lots to existing land that Monmouth owns, payoff Monmouth's preferred shares and invest in new industrial properties through Monmouth's connections to builders of new industrial buildings. Monmouth's shareholders get to share in the upside of the merged companies instead of getting a one-time cash payment and not have anymore upside. With leverage and all of EQC's cash used in new deals, this company will likely generate a significantly higher dividend yield than Monmouth has now if the shares don't go up value. What will likely happen is that the shares will rise as the dividend eventually rises over the next four years or so."
"Book value about 25.65 and it was announced May 5th EQC taking over MNR. MNR is a high quality company. Result will be a high quality realestate company. I think EQC will start paying a cash dividend after the merger. Overall, good for both companies. Sam Zell is top quality."
Price Went Down To Reflect Big Dividend Being Paid To Holders As Of 10/07?
Sam Is A Pretty Good Chess Player. We Will See What His Next Move Is!
"I would actually vote against this merger as a Monmouth owner, I have had this stock since it was 5.50 per share, and have reinvested dividends for over 20 years.Not only has the price of he stock risen, but with the dividends, it has been one of my favorite stocks that I own. After researching this company, I just do not see the same growth possibilities, unless something changes after his merger."
