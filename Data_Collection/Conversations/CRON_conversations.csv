"You know why I like this company, because they don't seem to chase headlines. About a year ago, people on this board were like, ""What are they doing?!"" Then, BMO invested $100 million. After a few months, people on this board were like, ""What are they doing?!"" Then, Altria invested a cool Bill. As analysts downgrade (maybe rightfully so to a degree, as we were super hot there for a while), I'm excited to see many of you say again, ""What are they doing?!"" Leadership is strong (ever looked into Gorenstein's background - Penn J.D., IU Kelly Finance undergrad). Direction and partnerships are innovative and exciting (e.g., Ginko Bioworks, Juul, etc.). Time is ripe (e.g., just walk around any street in California or follow the conversation on new legislation). Thanks for coming to my TED Talk."
What is going drop under $6?
Tomerrow is red or green?
what's CRON doing in Canada today?Thanks
Altria's investment here makes me feel like I can set it and forget it comfortably. The Marlboro-maker has the marketing prowess and the distribution network that's unmatched. You have to think long term here with this one. The short-term action of the price is just noise.
This stock is super stressful
A $2.75 Billion market cap with $15m in quarterly earnings???? no thank you!!
"No idea what the panic is about, I'm focusing on the next six months..."
"Altria ( Marlboro Co ) Has The Inside Connections, Distributors Already In Place, Billions For Experienced Marketing & Advertising."
"Just a friendly reminder, Altria (MO) own 40% of CRON. Invest 20% of your 401K into CRON, few years from now your return will triple or more. That what I did when CRON PPS below $10, but still not too late to get in GLTA."
"Ed, the fact is the company likely committed fraud. As you know, two high level executives left the company in January, outlined in a filing on January 22, 2020. David Hsu and William Hilson stepped down as its chief operating officer and chief commercial officer, respectively. Hsu's LinkedIn profile indicates that he had been at Cronos since September 2016 as COO. Hilson, who is also listed as founding CFO of the company, has the same date as the beginning of his tenure at the company on his LinkedIn page.Both men resigned effective Dec. 31, 2019, and have signed separation agreements with stipulations that include a ""general release of all claims against the Company and its affiliates and the executive's continuing obligations with certain covenants under his respective employment agreement with the Company."" The agreements also contain nondisparagement provisions, among other obligations.Hsu received a severance payment of 400,000 Canadian dollars ($305,373), less certain deductions and withholding. Hilson got CA$167,500, also with some deductions and withholding. I find it very interesting that just 2 months after they resigned, CRON is now suspected of cooking the books. Perhaps these two individuals were the culprits and the new CFO Jerry Barbato (been at the job for 11 months) discovered things that Hilson was doing. Time will tell."
Hold = Win Big
Why all cannabis stock not moving? It is all over the pot store in US /
So do you baggies still believe in the Ginko science fiction story about making THC with mutated yeast and doing it better and cheaper than cannabis plants. Never mind that it's not legal whatsoever to sell experimental drugs brewed up in a lab. This never bothered the pumpers at all.
Great job today holding off the short squeeze guys! Y’all had a good day considering how it could have gone. Enjoy the long weekend and hopefully next week will only get better.

Altria already has plenty of shelf space in the US. When it’s legalized nationally they will be selling Cronos products along side Marlboro & GPC.
"I consider the Negative people on this site Angels. Because every time an Angel complains about this stock I buy more. Rule number 1 in investing the majority is always wrong, so don't follow the herd, the only reason the stock is down is so the market makers and the wealthy can accumulate. And when the stock goes up and the herd starts to follow, thats when they get out... So I declare today National Angel day."
"I am bullish on this stock.This stock has very strong values, and good report, when there us an increese in net income.In all Canabis stock, it seems to be the best.I don't understand why is this stock not going up for long time..."
Sold mine at $13.50. I'll buy it back at $5.99.

"Technical Update: For those of you following technical readings on CRON, here's a basic update as a follow up on my posts dated 11/17/20. As previously discussed, CRON pricing has remained elevated long enough for the 50 DMA to cross over the 200 DMA late last week. This generally points to further gains as weaker hands have now been washed out for a long enough period of time that if price action goes up, it forces the 50 DMA to move higher. Buyers are now overcoming sellers for the past 50 days and when it crosses the 200 DMA, a bullish scenario is occurring. Many technicians call this a ""golden cross"" for a reason - it can create ""gold"", profits, etc. CRON has many of the shorter term DMAs now moving above the 200 DMA which bodes well for both the short and long term. With the fundamental story behind MJ stocks improving recently, it's no wonder this name is confirming a bullish scenario, just with the moving average analysis. Both the MACD and Stochastics studies are in very bullish territory, and a bit stretched at the moment. Please note both indicators can remained overbought for extended periods of time so this is not a harbinger of doom, but worth noting the name is extended, and could easily become more extended as well. Range pricing would wash some of this extended action out of the name and create a lot more room for larger upside action. So if it gets stuck in a price range for a period of time, this would be viewed as a bullish consolidation, not negative price action. Bollinger bands are rising quickly, also showing further upside is likely. Anything is possible, up and down, but technicals are certainly pointing towards higher prices, a continuation of a new uptrend and a good story for the bullish case. IMHO GLTA"

I posted a comment saying I can’t wait to see 4.20$ that comment was meant for ogi sorry all this red got me a little off balance
"Anyone watch the interview with Goldstein and MarketWatch? "" you look at the investments Altria has made -- I can't speak to 20 or 30 years ago -- but the company is very, very focused on reducing risk and expanding choice. And that's kind of the defining characteristic in the investments they're making. I think we're in a position that it doesn't hurt Altria if we put out more medical products, it doesn't take away their existing market share. Same thing with recreational products; same thing with CBD products."" https://stock-watch.market/marijuanastocks"
Gink going public tomorrow 9/16 with market cap greater than CRON who is the beneficiary of the artificial CBD. Better trade is sell CRON and buy SRNG ( new symbol DNA on Friday) . Stock is up 10% today ..
"cron will breakout, they have good credit, strong diversification, and not much debt. they are positioning themselves for real long term success. this is exactly what SQ did. do not fall for the hoopla. Long and strong. buy the dips and get rich"
"A thought to ponder, discuss and vet out: Two insiders sold a meaningful amount of their holdings. Generally, nobody long the stock likes to see insiders selling any part of their position. Rather, longs get excited when they see insiders buying stock in the companies they manage. However, there are many, many reasons why insiders would sell. Certainly, the one feared the most by longs is that they don't like what they see going on in their own company and reduce their exposure to potential asset declines by selling. But there are many other reasons they would sell. Ponder this. Altria is a HUGE shareholder in CRON. The money is sitting in the bank and doing nothing for them right now. With the current political climate potentially changing, there's more optimism and confidence that more states will legalize marijuana in order to balance their budgets from new tax revenue. Altria's board certainly sees this and perhaps is working behind the scenes to push this along. With Gorenstein no longer at the helm, maybe Altria is putting pressure on him to unload his holdings and allow Altria to be in a stronger position to accumulate a larger position in CRON at a much cheaper price than their original investment. Altria stands to benefit greatly by owning 100% of CRON if the conclusion is the MJ will become legalized in more and more states, perhaps nationally very soon. Altria has an outstanding management team, tons of positive cash flow and a strong balance sheet. For them to acquire 100% of CRON might just be what they're shooting for and having large shareholders like Gorenstein and others ""out of the way"" just might be another stepping stone to making this a reality. There are many, many other folks here much smarter than I so i'll be curious to get their comments here and see where it goes. Just maybe, insider sales is a good thing in this instance, for this name. GLTA"
So how's the mutated yeast treating you baggies. It's busted all support and looks to be heading to all time lows.
This stock is a book marker for Mo. They'll pick up the book and a few more years and see where their at.
"Altria is a dividend king that’s paid a consecutive, growing dividend for 51 straight years. They’ve paid more dividends than any stock in the market in the last 50 years. These are the people backing Cronos, and shorts are taking a major gamble trying to bring this down. Cronos will soon have 10 cents per gram product, and peers won’t be able to compete with the margins and pricing power. Altria is all about pricing power; now, its baby Cronos is learning the ropes from daddy."
"Low volume today with the .25 drop. Will likely drop to meet option chain incentives, then bullish."
Holy Moley! Was the SP really$12 in February? What a beauty pump and dump. I'm sad I missed the boat.

I wouldn't be selling any shares at all right now unless I was just playing the stock for the quick point or two. Lots of institutions are holding shares and CRON hasn't really released any news of late. Lots of shorts involved. Just stay for the party - you know the overall projection will be UP!
This will be 13.0 by the time markets open tomorrow then another $1 on top after than. :$14 EOB tomorrow
Would be nice if they have some kind of ginkgo status update?

This is time to buy not sell !
Buying more $CRON. Best cannabis play.
Hi guys! I jumped in at $11.08. Hope I made the right decision.
I see this and Canopy and Tilray as the best of class. I own 8 stocks sold CVSI and KSHB this week probably helped accelerate the loss a bit.Anybody see any other bright spots ?
"As soon as big money realizes Altria plans to sell packs of Marlboro branded MJ in every 7-11, Circle K, and convenience store across the USA (Altria owned prime shelf space behind the cash register), CRON will jump 100%++ to ATH and beyond."
It don’t matter in wish cannabis company you are invested in they all trading in the same pattern
Cronus should breakout soon... it has been investing the billions secured from Altria wisely. They have no effect of Corona and just needed to plan and invest liquidity at hand to setup for future growth. I am expecting announcements in near future. Wouldn’t be surprised to see at all time highs in 2020. Up to 300% potential!

"No one knows what's going on the inside with CRON, that would be insider trading. So lets look at the facts. 1. the relationship with Altira is a strong one, with huge upside potential and right now Altira is on fire with plenty of cash to burn.2. Its other partnerships. CRON has strategic relationships, with a US dispensary plus other companies that can only enhance CRONS growth.3. US legalization and the fact customers have to replenish inventory opens more opportunity for growth.So the point is, the companies that are positioned for consolidation and growth will lead this field..."
Two Canadian pot companies I like are Cron and Hexo...I hold both and of the two Hexo is not yet profitable but they are making huge moves positioning themselves to compete in the global market.
Slowly but surely. I'm seeing $13 by lunch time.

I see a lot of potential here considering 50% is owned by insiders. I see $50 in the next 2-3 years. Funds are scrambling to hold a position which will lead to a short squeeze sooner than later. Do your own DD.
Did I make a mistake buying this at today’s price ?
"I love the negative comments from the arm chair investors, if they are as smart as they think they are why aren't they running CRONOS or any other company. CRON isn't going anywhere... It has strong partnerships, foot in US, and plenty of cash. This industry is ripe for consolidation, expansion and new innovative product line. So many things could push this industry through the roof is, legalization, acceptance by insurance companies, and it's a product that you need to keep purchasing. I am accumulating at these low prices low prices, and expect this industry to explode very soon."
Altria buyout anytime soon??
MO figures the company will be bankrup in another year -￼ they exercise control and then transfer Ginko to them for a few billion and tells CRON good luck.
"Technical analysis:Recognia has detected an ""Ascending Continuation Triangle"" chart pattern formed on Cronos Group Inc (CRON on NASDAQ). This bullish signal indicates that the price may rise from a close above 9.17 to the range of 11.50 - 12.30. The pattern formed over 22 days which is roughly the period of time in which the target price range may be achieved.An Ascending Continuation Triangle is considered a bullish signal. It indicates a possible continuation of the current uptrend. This pattern occurs because the lows are moving increasingly higher but the highs are maintaining a constant price level. The technical event occurs when the price breaks out of the triangle formation to close above the upper trendline, thereby confirming the pattern."
"Hello! Ups and downs will always happen in this sector, especially within these next couple years during its infancy. We all know this company will reveal more good news...it’s on the horizon.

Distribution is key in investing in pot stocks. Everyone can grow weed which is why we will see an influx of suppliers which will drive the price down. Companies like CRON that have their distribution strategy mapped out will be the long winners.
"Are their any real sellers down here, you really must not know much to sell this below 6, lol"
"Cronos GroupThe next pot stock to avoid like the plague in October also hails from our neighbor to the north. Ladies and gentlemen say hello to Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON).Similar to Sundial, Cronos Group is absolutely swimming in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. When the curtain closed on June, Cronos was sitting on almost $1.1 billion. This equates to more than half of the company's currently market cap of $2.1 billion. But unlike Sundial, Cronos brought in this mountain of cash by selling a 45% equity stake to U.S. tobacco stock Altria Group (NYSE:MO) for $1.8 billion in March 2019. Unfortunately for Cronos, a beefy cash position hasn't masked the fact that so much has gone wrong for it and the Canadian weed industry.From a macro perspective, Cronos' ability to sell its pot products has been negatively affected by the coronavirus pandemic and supply chain issues. The latter is a direct result of regulators slow-stepping the approval of retail licenses in key provinces (e.g., Ontario) following the legalization of adult-use weed in October 2018.But Cronos has shot itself in the foot, too. Whereas most Canadian licensed producers overextended their capacity, Cronos arguably hasn't done enough. The meager $15.6 million in net sales recognized in the second quarter represents the company's highest quarterly sales after nearly three years of Canadian legalization. What's more, Cronos Group's partnership with Altria Group isn't paying dividends. Altria has a clear vested interest in seeing Cronos succeed, and is expected to help with derivative product development, marketing, and possibly even distribution efforts. However, this dynamic duo depends on the U.S. federal government altering its stance on marijuana. With reform efforts stalling in Congress, Cronos has few avenues to generate revenue in the U.S.With the company's expenses ticking higher and its losses widening, Cronos has burned through or spent $700 million of Altria's $1.8 billion cash payment since March 2019. That's more than enough reason for marijuana stock investors to keep their distance."
"Are we seeing a turnaround? Is this the inflection point for CRON?As I see it, the US federal government will be in need of a NEW source of significant and dependable income to pay for ""unpaid"" projects that soon will be in the pipeline. People, however, are very sensitive about new conventional taxes. However, I think, politicians won't be hurt by taxing cannabis products. In other words, it would be politically safe for politicians to decriminalize and... tax cannabis, permanently. It just makes sense. Timing is the issue. This all might happen sooner than we think. If so, CRON will soar."
Volume speaks volumes. New base establishing and forming solid foundation.
"PharmaCann going public! Looking at +$1B valuation. If true, Cronos got a good price on PharmaCann. Things are turning around! On the article I read several companies have stepped forward to buy PharmaCann."
Will we open up over 150? Maybe.￼
The catalyst is creating more partnerships before legalization. Keeping their debt under control and keeping cash. This is the beginning of a sideways pattern as the sector stabilizes. I'd rather have my money in a profitable company like Cronos and Aphria. These stocks may be the next Amazon or Microsoft.
"Solid open, heading towards higher highs. feels great to see some positive directional movements. Breakouts Bagging profits today http://summers.watch/popular"
CRON is the only MJ TECHNOLOGY company that can produce product much more cheaply than the field of competitors. A lot of money went into research and development. I believe and hope it will pay off in the near future.

The amount of buying in CRON today versus CGC is interesting. It almost looks as if we had institutional buying in CRON and institutional selling in CGC. Is it possible that the stock was downgraded so a big buyer was able to come in at a lower price?

"I usually don't say too much in the conversations here, but with the Altria deal I have to. Back in February 2017 I owned many shares of Altria and studying their chart it seemed like it was peaking at $75. ps. That is when I told my broker that I wanted to sell all my shares and buy shares of Cronos. My broker said with Altria you get a good dividend, blah, blah, blah.Against the advice of my broker I proceeded to sell my Altria and buy shares of this unfamiliar company from Canada called Cronos. Since then I watched Altria go from $75 per share when I sold it, to $54 ps. and watch my Cronos when I bought it $2.10 ps go up to $12.72 US. Sometimes you have to follow your gut and not your financial advisor."
Cron needs to buy Organigram or something equally attractive. Yesterday would be good
"Love the NEW line of gummies from CRON, this is a game changer!"

"Below my average. I guess I should be buying more today, but without knowing what’s up with the report, I’m hesitant. Below 7 I’d buy more, if only for selling more covered calls. But I don’t see how this company can stay below $50 when the federal law is retracted."

"Let's put this all in perspective. On 1/17/19 just under 6 million shrs. traded. On 1/18//19 it jumped to 23 million shrs. and then kept growing until 2/4/19 when 67.6 million shrs. traded and the price topped out at $25.10. That was your capitulation. Now trading has slowed down some to 32.4 million shrs. today. Also, during the time period of 1/18 - 2/4 there were only two days where the stock closed down. As I've said in an earlier post the price had increased over 234% in three months. There was no way that pace could continue. This is a good thing. Unfortunately, we may see some of the same thing happen in reverse. That's why I'm not rushing back into this. I'm keeping my gains ready to come back into the game...at some point...as I do believe in the company/industry. GLA"

I'm sure that all mj Canadian companies are going to have there eyes on this stock tomorrow..... Very interesting indeed.....
CRON only did $10 million in sales last year? Compared to Aurora who did $67 million and Canopy that did $70 million. No way this is worth as much as Canopy on valuation when CGC has 7x the revs and over twice as much cash that Cron does not even have yet
"Keep buying this Altria-backed company as it makes its gigantic rise. Don't look for 3-5 years is the sauce. Too many manipulators will try to psyche you out of your shares; best to just find the big ones that are backed by the big tobaccos and big alcohols, and buy and hold for a long time."
Looks like big money will be piling in after earnings. There are a lot of catalyst coming in the next 6 months but there has been unusual amount of paid articles that are negative. Let's be honest there are no friends here so no big money does not pay for these articles to save you money. Look beyond the message!

"This is an ""Illuminati-run company"" and one day will blow up. Do I have any stake in it? No, but it's sure a GREAT time to buy in. Will I?

And traders are buying the April 12.50 and 15.00 calls too! Very Bullish imho! Options interest and volume are a good indicator for future stock movement."
"Cron is the only stock in this sector that has a PE ratio, it is 45% owned by a huge company with major distribution skills. Altira will probably be buying all the outstanding shares when the time comes.

If CRON paid its shareholders in “gummies” the share price would soar.
Ahead of schedule for the various cannabinoids production. Beat earnings estimates--plenty of cash on hand. I bought more.
Time to back up the Airbus on CRON. It's a steal.

Holding the 50 DMA is the most important thing today. We don’t need to break 8. As long as 7.35 holds we are looking more and more bullish moving forward.

Ginkgo Bioworks is the company doing all the synthetic biology work for $CRON. Ginkgo Bioworks is entering into a SPAC with $SRNG which will close sometime in the next 3 to 4 weeks. $SRNG stock will convert to the new ticker $DNA. This is a long-term play with huge upside potential. Check out the impressive Ginkgo Bioworks story. Their business model is genius.

MRMD still under a buck. Very profitable with double the revenues of CRON. Soon to have 10 dispensaries. It has gone up ten percent since I first mentioned on here about a month ago. And they increased guidance at last quarterly report.
"As a shareholder I’m not the least bit worried about this company. Listening to the conference call and hearing drug/grocery store chain in both Canada/USA, I’m stoked! Having the price drop for me is a blessing so I can buy more. The cannabinoids they’re producing will dramatically change self wellness/healing. Just Google CBG and you’ll see for yourself. While your at it Google “Cannabinoids In Health & Disease”. Guys/Girls please loud up I want everyone to do well. Just saying I did well for my family the first time around with Canadian legalization. This company may look lost but they’re definitely on the road to profitability."
Congrats Canada
"Pondering Part II - First, a commentary on the chart. The 50-Day Moving Ave has been declining for a loooooong time, but has recently bottomed out and is rising around 4 cents/day. If CRON continues to hold up or even go higher, the proverbial ""golden cross"" above the 200-Day Moving Ave is likely to occur on November 26/27th - late next week. Many technicians look for such occurrences and could provide recommendations to their followers, thus adding volume to the move higher. Speaking of volume, it has increased nicely on this move up since the election. It's likely that shares are moving out of weaker hands and into stronger hands. CRON has now traded in the 7 handle for 8 days in a row. The name has not done this at all for the past year, again displaying stronger hands, higher bases, upside momentum, etc. MACD and Stochastic studies are bullish and show room to improve/grow even further. In summary, the technical picture is looking the best it has in over a full year. Meanwhile, doesn't it make sense for Altria to want to just buy the remaining shares in this company, take full control over it's direction and use the funds it already invested into CRON the way they want to rather than leaving it to CRON management? My bet is they will do it since the MJ environment is opening up faster and faster and they stand to be in a top position by using their money, their marketing and their management. Long and strong. Patience is finally paying off here. IMHO GLTA"
"For simple reason to own Cronos. Merely teach investors about Juul being bought for $12.8 billion and this Cron for $1.8 per investment JV by Altria. Idea of course to reinvent change to tobacco traditional paper rolled filter smoking to mechanical healthier vapes with use of hemp and in some places weed. Where hemp legal. The entire USA passed Hemp legalization. Altria has regulatory experience to get business moving. Cronos has been and still is a target of Andrew Left. The Matt Bottomley analyst from Cannacord Genuity looked suspicious. The SP analyst target has now gone up $1.50 ""yesterday""to $23.50 at my brokerage.Summary this company is pure growth oriented. Minor tute wash gives new lower prices to buy Cron cheaper now. Look for spike back to 22.00 when China trade deal announced. Chinese growing economy will be major buyer of Juul products. GL longs"
"I love that CRON's insider ownership is really high, but unfortunately so is the short position..... Where Are The Reddit Warriors? looking for a place to park some $$$$ while stocks are down.... this is just one of many I'm looking at"
how do I buy
"The last daily higher low was alllllll the way back at ~$14usd. A 54% from that last daily low to the high today without any consolidation. We all know that we haven't gotten any substantial consolidation with CRON since its run straight up. In 27 trading days only 2 of those trading days formed a lower close on the daily than the day prior. Monthly RSI - 79.75....Weekly RSI - 78.29...Daily RSI - 85.97...4HR RSI - 73.93...bearish divergence formed on the 1hr and 4hr rsi....volume climax with a shooting star daily candle. Now fundamentally, the Altria deal price was for $12.25....no reason that CRON should be worth almost double that when the partnership still didn't go through and they don't have the cash. Not just that, but the valuation at these levels for CRON has them trading at a 5x greater multiple to their earnings than CGC (which is absolutely absurd). CGC is earning over 7x in revs than CRON and already has over twice as much cash in hand than CRON is waiting to get in the future.Also Cramer came out Monday saying for his viewers to wait to buy after a pullback in down the road and that he can't justify these levels. Zack's has a sell on CRON. Now Citron shorting this. Anyone in their right mind knows this is way too high for where it should be and we formed no daily support in a 54% move and hardly any support in ~120%. Im joining them and opening shorts."

"There are a handful of MJ companies that stand a very good chance of thriving, none of them more-so than Cronos- The recent dips are completely understandable considering the rapid climb that likely caused some to either panic or simply take gains that were impossible to ignore- that being said, CRON and Altria are going to be massive, this is what was envisioned years ago- a marriage between MJ and a major tobacco company- here it is, don't miss out- keep seeing great opportunities from SmallCapCanada, they do an excellent job of locating the Canadian companies that are showing strong signs of growth and delivering quality reports that are packed with insightful info and market analysis- just a great resource for any investor- SmallCapCanada"

Edibles outperform cannabis industry growth in 2020 on COVID-spurred sales surge
"Charlie Schumer, promised Federal Cannabis legalization.Charlie (Kitten) did not deliver on his promise."
"CRON is backed by MO+PM = ~$180B market cap, with its literally tens of thousands of retail outlets across the USA and vast network of contract tobacco farmers that can easily convert over to MJ. Out of the blue, Altria will announce plans for dominance in this sector. Because they have to for growth. The small fish will get eaten alive. That's why you own CRON; don't get distracted."
What is the reason for such the jump? I looked but can’t find any.
"This is from an article called I watch stocks.Cronos Group is a company that's nearing profits, and I believe that the Canadian market is going to push the company into that territory. Also, comparing supply agreements in the coming-soon industry, Cronos seems to be the clear winner. Although the stock has seen dramatic gains over the past month, I'm expecting to see more of the same as I believe we've only reached the tip of the iceberg.Cronos Group Is Taking A Market That Doesn't Even Exist Yet By StormThe Canadian recreational cannabis industry is one that doesn't quite exist yet. With adult-use cannabis not becoming legal until the October 17th of this year, we're still about a month and a half away. Regardless of this fact, Cronos is already working to take the market by storm, and their efforts seem to be paying off. Although we've seen supply agreements among all three of the names mentioned above, Cronos has entered into more agreements, covering more turf than any other company in the newly-forming industry."
"CRONs newest deal gets it into the retail space in US, a place to sell product. Other partnerships allow it to cut cost per gram, develop super strands, and a major distribution partner with Altira. When legalization happens there will be nothing stopping this freight train!!!"
"There's new interest in CRON, probably due to behind the curtain progress in getting cannabis decriminalized at the federal level. If so, there's no reason why this CHEAP stock can't double or triple very quickly when that happens. As I see it, we will see multiple jumps in the weeks ahead for ""pre-pre-positioning"" by deep-pocketed investors."
CRON market cap is equal to cash plus other assets - basically no premium for Ginko or the cosmetics company they paid a 100-150million for.
Why does Cronos even sell cannabis? They should just invest the $1.3 billion in cash in a index fund and they would make more then $17 million in interest per quarter and have no loss. Unreal

"Feel free to correct or add to my thoughts. I think this is the pullback prior to our next leg up. RSi is pulling off the 70 overbought mark, 50 day is trading above the 100 day and the 200 day while the 100 is about to cross the 200, the MACD is showing bullish momentum although its starting to turn slightly over indicating momentum is slowing down (histogram shortening), price has slightly broke above the upper bollinger band causing it to pullback indicating higher price rejection ($14 resistance level).I'm no professional but i think this is profit taking prior to our next run up. I'm not concerned but there's probably more profit taking tomorrow. After all it's been a hell of a run since Jan 1. Good luck everyone! #long"
Did I miss the big new product announcement ?
One red day people relax! Set a limit sell order at $30+ and go on with your day
Does anyone read the financials anymore? 90 mill cash. Revenue grew from 640k (Q2 2017) to 3.4 mill (Q2 2018).
"hope all have listened to last Fridays conference call .. have telephone info in my thread. Michael Gorenstein was asked if Cronos could partner with other companies besides Altria and he started out his answer by "" Thats a great question"" I think Cronos will make more alliances and strategic partners of course..He talk also about the wealth of resources Altria brings to the table. Advertising, regulations, distribution, and so many other areas a multinational has at their disposal. This will give Cronos ab advantage that few have."
new to this. my very first stock purchase lol. Not looking good today.
In a few years from now Cron will be over $50.
Buy all pot stocks here
"After months of uncertainty on which marijuana stock to invest in, I finally decided on Friday to purchase CRON stock for my LONG-TERM portfolio based largely on an article published on BNNBloomberg on Jan 29, 2021. The author, David George-Cosh, revealed what I find most interesting and promising about CRON. It' about the innovations this company is initiating to become a leader in lab-produced cannabinoids, quoted here:""Cronos Group Inc. plans to release the first lab-grown cannabis products to the Canadian recreational market later this year, a move that could usher in a new wave of cheap pot that isn't derived from the plant at all. While Cronos Executive Chairman Mike Gorenstein didn't provide specifics, he said this year the company will commercially release products containing cannabinoids created using biosynthesis, an engineering process similar to brewing beer that can make THC and CBD for pennies on the dollar."" For me, this is the stock that I want for a LONG position. As far as I can tell, from my own limited research, this company is an innovator of lab-produced ""bio-ceuticals"" that can make THC and CBD far cheaper than its growing list of competitors. That certainly tipped the scale for me.Being half owned by ALTRIA (MO), the largest tobacco vendor in the USA provides this company will have the shelf space it needs to be marketed in every retail outlet in the USA... when cannabis is legalized. Not if. When."
Something is happening...Long on CRON.
"In a ""Motley Fool"" online article titled ""Which Canadian Cannabis Company Is In the Best Position to Enter the U.S. Market?"", this excerpt stood out: ""Cronos could have the potential to become a significant player in the U.S. pot market, rivaling both Canopy Growth and Tilray.""Nice. Very, very nice."
"Bought at $12.75 USD and you dont see me complaining. Research this gem, see the forces behind it, and value their intuitive drive of lab grown products. This is the future baby. Long and strong!"
"I'd like to share some key points of a Motley Fool May 7, 2021, 11:15 PM article written by Keith Speights. That article provided an analysis of CRON's 2021 Q1 results. Most of the analysis describes dismal financial results of a $0.44 per share LOSS instead of the widely anticipated $0.08 loss per share. That's lousy. The company is losing money because the cost of sales is higher than Q1 net revenue. That's lousy, too. The overall reaction, of course, is that the company is losing money hand over fist. But, according to the article, the real culprit is the ""loss on evaluation of derivative liabilities"" which amounts to a whopping $117 million! This involves the loss of value of the Altria warrants. Do I really understand this? No. However, it does sound TEMPORARY to me even though the consequence on CRON stock price, at least for Q1, is real. However, as I see it, there is a silver lining. I am still long on CRON because of these summarized developements, based on my interpretation of the article:#1 Health Canada approved a ""processing certificate"" for Cronos Fermentation in April, 2021. That's very significant, and in my mind, extremely promising. That means that CRON can commercialize cannabinoids that are produced in the lab. The quality, potentially, be signifiantly higher at much less cost... going forward. Interestingly, this implies a lot of previous investment in research and innovation that led to this happening. If so, that money may have been very well spent.#2 New edible products will be introduced in the near future, at least in the Canadian market. That's interesting. #3 A marketing campaign for Lord Jones is underway. Perhaps, just perhaps, ""Lord Jones"" will be the equivalent analog for ""Marlboro"" in the tobacco realm. #4 New topical beauty products (serums and creams) are being marketed. If successful, this is a long-term high-profit revenue stream.#5 Huge jumps in the stock price will occur if and when the US legislates federal cannabis reform. Already, in the banking sector, there are major congressional initiatives to allow US banks to process financial transactions involving the sale of cannabis products.... instead of the present situation of a cash-only business. So, IMHO, it's a waiting game for a LONG investor to get positioned for the next major developments. It could be months; it could be years. Inevitably, when marijuana is decriminalized in the USA at the federal level, the massive swell will lift all boats, especially CRON that has these 2 key competitive advantages:A. Altria owns nearly half of CRON. Altria sees huge growth potential in cannabis. When the time comes, Altria will have CRON products in every retail location the USA. Yes, every single retail location. Bottom line? Huge and immediate marketing advantage.B. Of all of the cannabis-related stocks, CRON seems to have the research/lab advantage in ultimately reducting overall production costs by an order of magnitude. Bottom line? CRON could, potentially, have the greatest profit margin for selling cannabinoid products.LONG on CRON."
"I think that patience is required for any investor who is willing to wait until the product that this company produces... becomes legal. Yes, that will happen. It might happen soon because there is so much money in the legalization of pot. I believe that a bill is in the pipeline, supported by both parties (surprisingly) that would allow banks to accept cash deposits from pot companies. Up until now, all companies working in this grey area have had to use cash only, not a good or safe choice for an entrepreneur. It all comes down to waiting. We all, I believe, can agree that when legalization is in the works, CRON will double or triple immediately. There is that much pent-up demand for this product. And, with a partner that nearly controls tobacco sales in North America, marketing will actually be very much accelerated ""right out the gate""."
"I don't really care what reddit says about CRON--in fact I would prefer they ignore it so the price stays low so I can buy more.I don't really care what some pundit says--or Amazon, or really any of the short term hype that creates short term bumps.I care about September. That's when they are supposed to start production of the fermented CBDs. I care about the huge state-of-the-art fermentation facility they bought. I care about all the people they have been slowly hiring for that facility.Its also nice they have a billion in the bank and a huge tobacco giant in their back field. I have until September to load up on this stock. Fermentation, fermentation, fermentation."
Some of this pre- market loss can be attributed to some natural selling. Some due to Tim Seymour saying this was a sell on Fast Money last night. But look at the ownership of shares here as it reads the cream of the crop of hedge funds. I am betting that 5 hedge funds collectively can do more due diligence than Tim Seymour so I am a buyer on this big dip!
ETFMG fund adds another 100k Friday on top of the 100k Thursday surging CRON to the no.2 spot over Aurora at 9.21% of holdings.

The great thing about today is that it is just the BEGINNING!
CRONOS has a plan. A vision. I’m just an average jo smo and I bought in. Having MO buy in says potential is unlimited. Our CEO isn’t a talker. Isn’t making headlines. He is working. Silence is a good thing. Developing trade secrets and building the infrastructure to sustain and conquer in this evolving and most certain industry that will dominate the economy. Good to be married to CRON!
"The bloggers over here sound like the same ones over on the Canopy site. Wait til next quarter, next year, when the US market opens…. It’s always just around the corner…. The facts are Cronos loses $3 dollars for every dollar of revenue… sounds just like Canopy doesn’t it………"
Cton another scam stock stay away and don't loose money.
"CRON is for sure in focus today, congrats to the longs https://medium.com/@charlieday_trader/marijuana-stocks-in-focus-as-u-s-voters-see-marijuana-on-ballots-61591d1dff9e"
"At the rate they are burning cash they can only last...hold on, oh yeah another ten years. I think this maybe partially an endurance contest. Companies that burnt their capital buying all that square footage are hurting right now. Cronos has enough in the bank to easily float till they get to fermentation which will be the death blow for some of their competition."
In the current market it's not easy finding undervalued stocks. I've moved into this stock due to long term growth prospects. In the long haul. Nice addition to my tech and healthcare stocks. Be patient and don't respond to propaganda or get emotional. Patience will make you a nice chunk of cash in the next few years.
"No question that MJ market is set to explode and Canada could very well be the leading player in just a few short weeks when they vote to legalize recreational MJ. Already the medical MJ market is anticipated to hit $55.8 billion by 2025 and the recreational side is significantly higher. You better believe CRON is in a great position to be a force in MJ. Check out the reports from SmallCapCanada, they consistently deliver detailed profiles packed with insightful information about Canada's best plays. Good luck to all this week."

"Correct me if I'm wrong $13.77 looks to the lowest price Altria is going to pay for shares of CRON.Cronos Group Inc.Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial StatementsFor the three months ended March 31, 2020(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for gram and share amounts, unaudited) The fair values of the derivative liabilities were determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model as of December 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020, applying the following inputs:December 31, 2019 As of March 31, 2020 Altria Warrant Pre-emptive Rights Top-up Rights Altria Warrant Pre-emptive Rights Top-up Rights Share price at valuation date (per share in C$) $9.97 $9.97 $9.97 $7.99 $7.99 $7.99 Subscription price (per share in C$) $19.00 $16.25 $16.25 $19.00 $16.25 $16.25 Weighted average risk-free interest rate (i)1.69% 1.73% 1.71% 0.49% 0.44% 0.36% Weighted average expected life (in years) (ii)3.18 1.25 1.66 2.93 2.25 1.29 Expected annualized volatility (iii)82% 82% 82% 80% 80% 80% Expected dividend yield —% —% —% —% —% —% (i) The risk-free interest rate was based on Bank of Canada government treasury bills and bonds with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the derivative liabilities. The risk-free interest rate uses a range of approximately 0.21% to 0.62% as of March 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019 – 1.66% to 1.73%) for the Pre-emptive rights and Top-up rights.(ii) The expected life in years represents the period of time that the derivative liabilities are expected to be outstanding. The expected life of the Pre-emptive Rights and Top-up Rights is determined based on the expected term of the underlying options, warrants, and shares, to which the Pre-emptive Rights and Top-up Rights are linked. The expected life uses a range of approximately 0.25 year to 5.75 years as of March 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019 – 0.25 year to 6 years).(iii) Volatility was based on an equally weighted blended historical volatility level of the underlying equity securities of the Company and peer companies.The following table quantifies each of the significant inputs described above and provides a sensitivity analysis of the impact on the reported values of the derivative liabilities. The sensitivity analysis for each significant input is performed by assuming a 10% decrease in the input while other significant inputs remain constant at management’s best estimate as of the respective dates. A decrease in the inputs noted below would cause a decrease in derivative liability and as of March 31, 2020, there would be an equal but opposite impact on net income (loss)."
"The knocks on CRON is that they haven't acquired growing capacity and they're only in the game because of Altria's investment.Given CRON's focus on synthetic CBD/THC for vapes (look up Ginko Bioworks) I am not sure buying cultivators at a premium is the way for them to go long term.As for the Altria's investment? We're talking an A+ manufacturing and distribution partner/part owner. I suspect Altria bought the huge stake because of CRON's focus on synthetic.Only bad move I can think of is the Lord Jones transaction, but I believe that leadership team is out."
"So as I see it, Citron looks for something to cause panic and buy in later when it is down, probably cause missed the opportunity. Now some lawyer see's the story and wants to take more money from people who bought in at the higher amount and are losing (for now). Rich always want to get richer at the cost to us little guys. I am not buying it, I am staying put."

"Raymond James analyst Rahul Sarugaser recently wrote in a note to clients that Cronos has more going for it than most investors realize. Sarugaser mentioned both its relationship with Altria and its move into the U.S. CBD market as critical reasons the company has a bright future. That said, the analyst believes Cannabis 2.0 benefits won’t kick in until the second half of 2020. “We predict a rebound among strong, fiscally prudent operators beginning ~May 2020, materializing more fully in 2H20 with the realization of Cannabis 2.0 sales and, perhaps, the expansion of retail cannabis store footprint across Canada, particularly in Ontario, driving accelerated sell-through,” Sarugaser wrote. The analyst pointed to Cronos’ significant cash balance of almost $2 billion and its fiscal discipline as reasons why it’s positioned better than most."
Calling all LONGS. Like a family taking sides we all must stick together. Let’s give each other a “thumbs up” on all positive posts about CRON. It does make a difference. Best to each of you. Johnny

"Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. It seems like we went through some rough turbulence. The good news is the flight for the rest of the trip seems like it will be very smooth. On behalf of Cronos Airlines, I thank you for flying with us around Canada!"
Stop your fear selling. You'll only lose in the long game. This selling is bringing down the entire MJ space. One positive for me is I can buy more at the lower price.
"On a national level, recreational cannabis sales hit a record of 298.1 million Canadian dollars ($247.4 million) for the month, with sales increasing in every province and territory. Ontario's growing market led the provinces with a 19.2% month-over-month increase in sales to CA$103.4 million."
CRON is heading higher as growers are beginning to multiply.
"Pot stocks down across the board. Be patient, there will be a rebound."
At one time Amazon was a book store. Giants will rise from the ashes of the pot stocks. Cron is well positioned to be one of them.
"my understanding/ opinion as to the reasoning behind the ""red"" is because: 1. the price is already incorporated into the stock ? but that cant be??? so it had me think more ""outside the box"" maybe decimalization is not equal to legalization as in more space for an illegal market? BUT again, I had to ponder longer... this cant be right? People will want to, in the future, to smoke non trailerparck made weed? My guess/take on it then is the whole marijuana sector is lagging the news a bit.... shoudl be green all next week. If anyone else has an opinion or knows the reason behind the sell off please let me know in the comment section below.Please like and subscribe to my youtube channel"

"The logic of saying ""they will be worth more in the future so buy now"" is like saying buy Amazon back in the December 2014 $400 bucks bc its worth more in the future. The fact is people that think like that would have held Amazon for almost 2 years before being in the green again. That time period was not in a bear market either....the point is there are times to buy and times to sell. An investor wants to get the most bang for their buck. No investor should chase tops."

"CRON has been one of the most strongest Cannabis stocks around. Specially in the last 7 to 8 trading days. I think something is going on but, of course I don’t know what it is. It would be nice, to hear if an employee, or someone close to CRON could give us a any tip.Thank you"
"too much available$$$$ cash for this company CRON not to a giant success, or simply their 40% shareholder just buying these guys out $25+ just buy and go too sleep"
"(""Cronos Group"" or the ""Company""), is pleased to announce that it has entered into a joint venture agreement with an affiliate of Agroidea SAS (""AGI""), Colombia's leading agricultural services provider with over 30 years of research, development and production operations. This partnership establishes a newly formed entity, NatuEra S.à r.l. (""NatuEra""), in Colombia that will develop, cultivate, manufacture and export cannabis-based medicinal and consumer products for the Latin American and global markets."
This is another dead meat not moving at all/ this pot worker by seasonal made $6000-$7000 ? But stock keep dropping? Why ?
"For a company that is only 3.5 years since its IPO date, and low rate and good reports, the way is only up.The best Canabis stock ever!"
Down everyday. Looks pretty bleak.
Can we all agree that if we are stating the share price please note if it is the US (NASDAQ) based trade or on the Canadian exchange?? I think there is a lot of confusion on that one point alone.
in short term CRON will hit 15 by friday
"Unfortunately, so many of you are going to blow up your accounts. The price of any stock is going to go where it goes regardless of what anyone 'wants' or 'hopes'. I don't really care which direction it is going, only that I accurately predict that direction and position accordingly.... we are in the market to make money, not to pretend we are in Disney World (Disney World is a pretty expensive place by the way). Good Luck to all, stay sharp, and keep learning/improving."
I think tomorrow will be a big jump ^
"RUE the day you didn't BUY,accumulate and hold CRON for blue sky at this PPS"
Zacks rating is strong buy.https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/CRON?q=CRON

Here is the good news. No matter whom Diageo buys or does a deal with...their competitors will see an opportunity to invest in mj trade and follow suit with a different deal.All good for us.
"Crono’s group announced today it is acquiring 4 units of Redwood Holding group, a maker of Hemp-derived cbd infused skincare and other products for 300 million in stock and cash. 225 million in cash, the remaining in stock. The deal will be finalized this quarter."
"~ $6.11 multiple indicators of resistance as of today.. Lets see if Cronos releases their own earnings date, the sites posting dates are just estimates. If they release it tomorrow, it would be using the same strategy as the FED move. Wait till the bottom has a natural bounce then hit the accelerator. Full Disclosure sold some at 5.94. Large majority still long. As disclosed on previous post bought at 5.46"
Huh...just what I said 5 minutes ago...https://www.investors.com/news/marijuana-stocks-coronavirus-outbreak-vice-of-choice-is-cannabis/
Cramer says Cronos is a winner. I’m a buyer at these suppressed levels. Will reach new all time highs in less then 24 months. Buyer here
"With well over a billion in the bank and additional backing from Altria, Cron could scoop up any profitable MJ company in the U.S. When the time is right they will pounce and this will go from under $10 to over $20 in less then a day. Look at the 300 million deal Aphria just made. That is small change for what Cron has the ability to do. There is also the possibility with results from the election that Altria will buy out Cron and have 100 percent of the company vs 45 percent. This is a hidden jewel and the patient investors will profit huge!!"
"Finally !!TORONTO, March 01, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cronos Group Inc. (CRON.TO) (CRON.TO) (“Cronos Group” or the “Company”), will announce its financial results and hold its Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 at 8:30 a.m. EDT. Senior management will be available for questions from the investment community after prepared remarks."
"I added more at 6.86 USD. After researching all available material I think this is a homerun. Good down to Earth mgmt, long term, large scale focus. Diversification, international with a strong Canadian “recreational” surge nearly guaranteed. This has potential to be a life changing holding in 5-6 years. Could be acquired too for a nice short term gain, but I’m thinking long."
"Time to start buying big its coming in 2022 SAFE Banking Act,"
"Oh the irony, POT is finally being legalized and all this hoopla over companies hasn't worked out in the stock market. These stocks lag....and now with mushrooms, etc on the horizon....it's not going to be an easy ride."
Reefer !
Hey guys. Food for thought. Do you think a company valued in the billions would make an investment in a company without a plan. It doesnt matter what earnings are right now its the future and what Altria brings with it.
The planned Cannabis ETF (managed by Hyman Moskowitz);GTBIF & CRLBF will be two largest positions in ETF.Would be great if Cron could be included in this ETF.
"Personally, I would rather get my CBD from the plant, not grown in some vat."
"Think about it, all Altria CEO would have to say is ""BOO"" and CRON would instantly double. Altria will dominate using their prime shelf space behind tens of thousands of cash registers in every gas station and convenience store across the USA. MJ grown by Altria's vast network of tobacco farmers. Fill Er' up, case of Bud and a pack of Cronos/Marlboro branded MJ please."
"Well, this was a great week. Enjoy your weekend"
looks like Jeffrey David Jacobson - Gen. Mang. of Canada & Europe just got a nice 120k option grant dropped in his lap and quickly unloaded 40k+ shares at $5.64 -- nice to see that high level of confidence in our top guys
"From an article by Motely Fools,First, I fully expect the company will report sizzling sales growth in its next quarter. This will be the first quarter to include revenue from the recreational marijuana market in Canada. I think it's likely that Cronos will enjoy a bump from its next quarterly update in a few weeks, ending the pullback if it hasn't already ended before then.I also think that the Canadian government will meet its goal of opening the legal market for cannabis edibles, beverages, and concentrates used in vaping in October 2019. This new market should provide another boost for Canadian marijuana stocks, including Cronos.My take is that Cronos Group will begin to reap the rewards from its partnership with tobacco giant Altria later this year. This relationship is more important than just the money that Cronos will receive, although that's not an insignificant factor.Altria CEO Howard Willard said a few weeks ago that ""there are opportunities really across the world in a variety of product categories, both recreational and medicinal, that would involve [Cronos] entering new product forms and developing new products and new product brands."" His words underscore that there's a much bigger opportunity before Cronos than what we've seen in the past or even what we'll see in much of 2019. I think the big picture for Cronos Group continues to look very good. The current breather is probably nothing more than a breather for this high-flying stock. Buy Cronos on the dip? In my view, that sounds like a pretty good move for aggressive investors."
"These are important numbers for determining the company's value. The company is expected to be able to produce some 110,500 kg. per year based upon there building projects and supplier contracts. At a price of $7.21 USD per gram, that would amount to revenue of $796.7 million per year. On that revenue, with 17% profit margin, the company can expect to earn $135.5 million. With 177 million shares outstanding, EPS would be $0.76. If we valued the company along the lines of the general market at 20-times these earnings, that puts each share worth $15.00. Currently, the stock is trading at about $8.35, about half of its possibility."
Will someone explain how call options work say I buy two options for the 12 for the stock to hit 6.5 and it hits today what willMyProfit be
Long way to go to $12.... but I’m hoping....
Sleeping giant!
Who is holding over $12 here like me 
Fast money reported bright future for pot stocks. I'm buying more tomorrow.
I'm just curious how many on this board are long and how many are short or short term.If you are long show by a thumbs upIf you are short or short term show by a thumbs down
"Cannabis stocks were mostly higher Tuesday after three Democratic senators led by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said they would make reform legislation a key priority in the current Congress , bolstering hopes for an end to federal prohibition."
I will be purchasing my first shares this morning. Expect a drop in price soon after.
This is my 1st stock purchase..I bought in at 8.33..im trying to stay in long term ;)
Im glad I didn’t panic and sell like so many did yesterday. I’m in since 7.15 @ 450 shares.
"it only makes sense for tobacco to make its way into the industry, this is going to be huge if it all pans out. congrats to the longs https://medium.com/@CHasting98/todays-trending-marijuana-stocks-22ff378f6940"
This is still a great buy at this price
Hey pumpers have a sip of some mutated yeast... heh heh.
somebody just picked up 2 million shares
"MF article means they are accumulating and good things are coming in the last quarter of the year. IMO, the SEC should be investigating these people."
"We all recently seen the article by the street where they mentioned a future price range between $28-$42 for CRON. If you haven’t, you can find it in one of my recent posts (scroll down to the bottom). Some are skeptical but here is why I believe it is actually possible to see this come to fruition in the next few months. My “conservative” technical analysis, provided in the chart below and if accurate, demonstrates a strong bull move starting January 2nd with a close of $11.31. Cronos then goes parabolic until February 4th where it hits a high of $25.10. It begins to consolidate on February 5th and continues to do so forming a bullish pennant AKA a bullish continuation pattern. On the “conservative” side, the consolidation is roughly around an average of $20.00. If we take the difference between $11.31(the start of the bull run) and $25.10(the high of the run up) and add it to the consolidated average price of $20.00, that would give us a price target of $33.79+ give or take on its next leg up. Good luck Fam! #long https://www.tradingview.com/x/IcayAcjT/"
guess I should have sold at $15
"Folks, here me loud and clear! Ignore the noise. CRONOS is a keeper. Don’t dare put it up for adoption. Why do I post? Because I’m passionate about this company. I believe in the CEO. That’s why."
Extremely quiet on this board. Is it the calm before the storm?
Sure glad I bought in at $8...in it for the long haul!
Calm before the storm.... Reuter’s and financial times are two very respected sources and they both reported a likely buy out... be patient I’m Accumulating on the dips... shorts would not want to hold this going into weekend with a deal almost done any day. I would sell only above the $25-30 mark minimum if you need short term cash and beyond 55+ if you can hold longer. Good luck Longs our day is coming :)
"Don't get caught watching the paint dry...BUY, Accumulate and HOLD for BLUE SKY"
@MMadness101 7m7 minutes ago$CRON Today's filing by $MO would certainly seem to follow my postings on Fri-Sat that Altria is setting things up to make a complete buyout of $CRON by owning 55% of the company after the warrants are exercised. Hard to believe this will stay under $30 for long
"I added today, do they expect people to sell here at 5 bucks, really? Who cares about the rest of the market"
Great quarterly report. Still waiting expecting $50 as soon as fermentation process goods hit the shelves. Big on Cronos and CuraLeaf. I can’t imagine shorting a cannabis company right when laws are changing to accommodate them. A short could wake up to a $25 jump but m this stock or more.
CgC is buying out Wana. Cronos should be buying Organigram or something equally attractive. What’s holding them back?
"MJ market isn't going anywhere but up- doesn't matter if it's medical or recreational, CBD-infused beverages or edibles, vapes or smoke- it's only getting bigger and Cronos along with Altria have an incredible advantage in that they have established roots in two of the biggest pieces of the MJ pie- Love it- if you're looking for the next great play in the Canadian markets check out SmallCapCanada, they always find the companies that are flying under the radar and deliver quality reports that are packed with insightful info and market analysis- just a great resource for any investor- SmallCapCanada"
"Dear CRON Friends old and new,I know these times can be frustrating but stop a moment and think beyond these temporary price swings. If you weren’t here after the Q2 ER then I can understand a creeping fear of the bottom falling out. I promise you. Don’t worry.In the 3+ month flux prior to the run was simply accumulation time. Very reminiscent of our current fluxing range.Don’t forget the run was simply a reaction to Q3 report. Now with some gusto behind them, run ups prior to ER much more likely. After unprecedented sales in Q2 they were able to sell more for Q3! An impressive feat considering they stated in Q2 they were scaling back production to meet the market needs they saw.Pro hint: I could (will...) go on for too long on the Pro’s we’ll be seeing in the next ER and beyond. Chill on the temp price swings and don’t stress about the pennies, this is simply the next base before the next inevitable run. CRON is my #1 pick for pot stocks in 2021."
