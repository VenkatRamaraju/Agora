Just another money burning pot stock. Never should have invested in this scam !!!!!
You may want to look at Bioharvest Sciences (BHSC on TSX). They can grow MJ is bioreactors in liquid media vs what Cronos is doing with Biosysthesis. Much more cost effective and full spectrum canabinoids with biofarming.

"Canadian Cannabis Sales Increased 44% in August to Record $357 MillionOctober 22, 2021 at 8:44 am"
Finally a news release! It will be interesting what SP does with this bit of news after yesterday’s run up.
"Spinach has the best quality and priced, legal Cannabis on the Canadian 1.0 Flower market."
"Cronos GroupThe next pot stock to avoid like the plague in October also hails from our neighbor to the north. Ladies and gentlemen say hello to Cronos Group (NASDAQ:CRON).Similar to Sundial, Cronos Group is absolutely swimming in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. When the curtain closed on June, Cronos was sitting on almost $1.1 billion. This equates to more than half of the company's currently market cap of $2.1 billion. But unlike Sundial, Cronos brought in this mountain of cash by selling a 45% equity stake to U.S. tobacco stock Altria Group (NYSE:MO) for $1.8 billion in March 2019. Unfortunately for Cronos, a beefy cash position hasn't masked the fact that so much has gone wrong for it and the Canadian weed industry.From a macro perspective, Cronos' ability to sell its pot products has been negatively affected by the coronavirus pandemic and supply chain issues. The latter is a direct result of regulators slow-stepping the approval of retail licenses in key provinces (e.g., Ontario) following the legalization of adult-use weed in October 2018.But Cronos has shot itself in the foot, too. Whereas most Canadian licensed producers overextended their capacity, Cronos arguably hasn't done enough. The meager $15.6 million in net sales recognized in the second quarter represents the company's highest quarterly sales after nearly three years of Canadian legalization. What's more, Cronos Group's partnership with Altria Group isn't paying dividends. Altria has a clear vested interest in seeing Cronos succeed, and is expected to help with derivative product development, marketing, and possibly even distribution efforts. However, this dynamic duo depends on the U.S. federal government altering its stance on marijuana. With reform efforts stalling in Congress, Cronos has few avenues to generate revenue in the U.S.With the company's expenses ticking higher and its losses widening, Cronos has burned through or spent $700 million of Altria's $1.8 billion cash payment since March 2019. That's more than enough reason for marijuana stock investors to keep their distance."
"I love the negative comments from the arm chair investors, if they are as smart as they think they are why aren't they running CRONOS or any other company. CRON isn't going anywhere... It has strong partnerships, foot in US, and plenty of cash. This industry is ripe for consolidation, expansion and new innovative product line. So many things could push this industry through the roof is, legalization, acceptance by insurance companies, and it's a product that you need to keep purchasing. I am accumulating at these low prices low prices, and expect this industry to explode very soon."
More than happy to keep buying at this level. Thanks to whoever is selling
"TLRY looking strong, but of course this #$%$ still sitting at 5 dollars..."
"In a ""Motley Fool"" online article titled ""Which Canadian Cannabis Company Is In the Best Position to Enter the U.S. Market?"", this excerpt stood out: ""Cronos could have the potential to become a significant player in the U.S. pot market, rivaling both Canopy Growth and Tilray.""Nice. Very, very nice."
"I consider the Negative people on this site Angels. Because every time an Angel complains about this stock I buy more. Rule number 1 in investing the majority is always wrong, so don't follow the herd, the only reason the stock is down is so the market makers and the wealthy can accumulate. And when the stock goes up and the herd starts to follow, thats when they get out... So I declare today National Angel day."
Remember that time in late 2018 when Altria invested and sucked in a ton of bagholders early 2019? That was a ton of fun.
what happened? where did 6 go?
Does Cronos Group Inc. make products to help old cronies with their aches and pains? Inquiring minds want to know.
when people say I'm in this for the long term
They should send some samples of their new product to the shareholders so we can write a review.
"Just recently added these stocks to my portfolio . . . ready for big gains:$CL - Colgate (Oral Healthcare & Dental Products): $75.5- Earnings on Oct.29th, just in time to release forward-looking statements for the holiday season including Halloween when their revenue typically spikes higher.$CRON - Cronos (Cannabis & CBD) $5.8- Vote taking place in November regarding the Federal legalization of Cannabis. $CTEK - CynergisTek INC (Cyber Security) $1.79- Recent contracts including one with a US based federal credit union$DPLS - DarkPulse INC (Laser Technology and AI Systems) $0.085- More of a long-term play here, because I truly believe this stock could reach well over $1 in the next year. Riskier than my other stocks, but you've gotta risk it for the biscuit, period."
"This industry is about to explode, earnings, banking, legalization, consolidation, oh my...."
They received a positive mention on CNBC.
When do they start selling the CBG gummies?
CBG sounds like an innovation that should start with a small private and be sold to a big public
looks like Jeffrey David Jacobson - Gen. Mang. of Canada & Europe just got a nice 120k option grant dropped in his lap and quickly unloaded 40k+ shares at $5.64 -- nice to see that high level of confidence in our top guys
Cron needs to buy Organigram or something equally attractive. Yesterday would be good
does anyone here know if the new spinach products are a little less expensive than the comparable plant based products? and has anyone tried the stuff?
CRON.TO is up 5.26% to 7.01
"I think that patience is required for any investor who is willing to wait until the product that this company produces... becomes legal. Yes, that will happen. It might happen soon because there is so much money in the legalization of pot. I believe that a bill is in the pipeline, supported by both parties (surprisingly) that would allow banks to accept cash deposits from pot companies. Up until now, all companies working in this grey area have had to use cash only, not a good or safe choice for an entrepreneur. It all comes down to waiting. We all, I believe, can agree that when legalization is in the works, CRON will double or triple immediately. There is that much pent-up demand for this product. And, with a partner that nearly controls tobacco sales in North America, marketing will actually be very much accelerated ""right out the gate""."
"So about 85% of the stock price represents cash on hand, but apparently no one is interested in that?"
At one time Amazon was a book store. Giants will rise from the ashes of the pot stocks. Cron is well positioned to be one of them.
It don’t matter in wish cannabis company you are invested in they all trading in the same pattern
"HUGE NEWS WAS RELEASED WEEKS AGO AND NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT IT!!! FIRST TIME EVER THC (psychoactive elements cannabis) HAS BEEN IMPORTED FROM COLUMBIA into USA!

"Cronos will use Altria's 200,000 distribution network of stores to sell their products.Cron to $25.00.Buy before US Federal Legalization and news."
Cronos finally has something to sell and run with. Price and quality will tell the story!
My God this board members are making some serious money running this company
"Chief innovation officer to retire. He’s got his millions from Altria, no need to work anymore."
"Cannabis producers in Canada have sold less than 20% of their production since the country launched adult-use sales in October 2018, according to an MJBizDaily analysis. The newest data – which runs through 2020 – implies that most of the cannabis produced from 2018 through last year was either stored in inventory or destroyed, and less than one-fifth ended up in retail stores."
I bought at $12 now is down to $5 ? What ?
Sleeping giant!
here we go watch this cannabis sector EXPLODE NOW rest of the year! Greed needs somewhere to go and retail is pinched by logistics... BIG MONEY COMING IN TO CANNABIS REST OF THE YEAR.
