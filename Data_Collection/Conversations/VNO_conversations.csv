Does vornado realty management still have that swagger. Doubt it.
"Why is the VNO-PM low, I purchased it much higher. Well I guess it is because it is considered long term and interest rates are going up. The 5.25 doesn't seem that attractive now."

Does VNO have the funds to buy out Trumps' interests?
Surprised this REIT is dropping right now amidst all the good news.
"NYC is falling apart! Everyone is moving to Florida! Crime rate is through the roof! Druggies and prostitutes are setting up camp on every other corner in midtown! Why does that mean VNO is going to make a big comeback? . . . Mayor DeBlasio and his failed policies are becoming extremely unpopular, even among progressive media backers who have long and dutifully enabled his ""look at the shiny social justice thing and please ignore my incompetence"" routine . . . In a counter-intuitive way the WORSE it gets in NYC right now, the better the chances voters will back one of the more responsible of the mayor candidates to replace DeBlasio (there are over 35 of them!) . . . Don't look now, but at return to the ""bad old days"" could be just what NYC needs to convince voters to select a reasonable leader, even if it means no more ""defunding the police"" . . . . Once enough people get mugged and assaulted, the attitude of the public starts to shift . . . And if it does? . . . NYC will be back in business faster than most would think possible . . . It's all still there, waiting for the lights to be turned back on again . . . Vaccine distribution and new leadership are coming . .. You can work from home, but without ANY office space? Not really, and why would you if you are one of the white collar people with an office in midtown? You CAN work from home, but you'll keep a nice office too . . . NYC will turn itself around BECAUSE the political dysfunction is so bad right now (nowhere to go but up!), and VNO stock will rally LONG BEFORE that actually happens . . . Book it."
