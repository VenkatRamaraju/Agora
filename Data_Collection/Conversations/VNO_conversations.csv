NYC recovery into the spring will drive this higher.
Goldman bullish on dividend paying REIT
earning surprise coming? Dividend maintained?
SOFI top pick of billionaireMatthew Barnard!
K.K Moskowitz a Buyer.
one of the last smart real estate play.
"Why is the VNO-PM low, I purchased it much higher. Well I guess it is because it is considered long term and interest rates are going up. The 5.25 doesn't seem that attractive now."
"Physical buildings and stores are valued pretty lowly. Cloud and e-commerce websites are rocking ....SHOP, WIX, FSLY and so on.Virtual realty estates are hot now."
I am thinking about buying stock in vno. Can anyone tell me if it is a good investment?
"Mean reversion is the most powerful force in the Universe . . . We all know VNO and SLG are different companies with different assets, but every time the performance of the two stocks has diverged over the last 5 years, the gap has been closed within 6-12 months . . . Will it happen again?"

"With multiple vaccines in sight, it is time to buy."
Pretty large drops on earnings hit. Will it follow the December or February path now?
Debt review holding stock down?
Way undervalued wow.
"NKLA, is now a publicly traded company.NKLA, manufactures electric trucks, NKLA, hasover $10 billion in advance sales. NKLA, will rivalTesla, in electric truck sales. VNO, could offerto develop show room space nationwide for NKLA."
I knew this would be back up. Simply too many assets worth too much to be low.
"PLD, a Great REIT, Buying Opportunity."
VNO entered bear market. GG. Sold my shares today
VNO is seriously undervalued. The real estate itself is more than double its valuation. Major increase coming!
This VNO message board is useless and should be thrown in the trash.
They got two headwinds IMHO. NYC RE values are in free fall and they have ties with the Donald.
"Can anyone explain any reason that this stock is still going up?I know there is a vaccine in sight @Jules, but it will be a very long time before it gets to the population at large, and in the mean time, Corona infections are on a rise, they weren't able to sell their building and they diluted their stock a secondary offering... IT MAKES NO SENSE..."
Surprised this REIT is dropping right now amidst all the good news.
VNO cheapest REIT to get paid in this prolonged low interest environment. Making no sense residential/commercial building worth less than stay-at-home software like ZM.

"NYC is falling apart! Everyone is moving to Florida! Crime rate is through the roof! Druggies and prostitutes are setting up camp on every other corner in midtown! Why does that mean VNO is going to make a big comeback? . . . Mayor DeBlasio and his failed policies are becoming extremely unpopular, even among progressive media backers who have long and dutifully enabled his ""look at the shiny social justice thing and please ignore my incompetence"" routine . . . In a counter-intuitive way the WORSE it gets in NYC right now, the better the chances voters will back one of the more responsible of the mayor candidates to replace DeBlasio (there are over 35 of them!) . . . Don't look now, but at return to the ""bad old days"" could be just what NYC needs to convince voters to select a reasonable leader, even if it means no more ""defunding the police"" . . . . Once enough people get mugged and assaulted, the attitude of the public starts to shift . . . And if it does? . . . NYC will be back in business faster than most would think possible . . . It's all still there, waiting for the lights to be turned back on again . . . Vaccine distribution and new leadership are coming . .. You can work from home, but without ANY office space? Not really, and why would you if you are one of the white collar people with an office in midtown? You CAN work from home, but you'll keep a nice office too . . . NYC will turn itself around BECAUSE the political dysfunction is so bad right now (nowhere to go but up!), and VNO stock will rally LONG BEFORE that actually happens . . . Book it."
Preferred eligible for call in Aug. Anybody think VNO will call them?
Vornado Realty is up 8.08% to 40.26
Does VNO have the funds to buy out Trumps' interests?
"PLD, great REIT-Buying Opportunity."
Hopefully this will go back up..

Looks like The Street doesn't think NYC real estate is coming back...
7.38% dividend. Staying long and collecting dividends. $$
I sold my Twitter and VNO. Didn't like the ties to our soon to be x president.
"Smart money piling into silver, gold, and New York real estate right now!"
did they miss?
