"THE Revolutionary and Innovative CGM product that $Dexcom, $Medtronic or $Abbott wish they had :$SENS Eversense XL is the revolutionary and innovative CGM product that $Dexcom, $Medtronic or $Abbott wish they had. Just imagine $Apple in 2007, unveiling revolutionary iphone that changed our concept of what smartphones should be. $SENS Eversense CGM will do the same thing for healthcare and diabetics around the world. Don't sell your shares until FDA approves 180 day CGM very soonest and further 365-days FDA approval CGM which I am sure $SENS shall dominate Diabetes Markets worldwide!!A small patience is kindly much needed to be more bigger wealthy for YOU and all your family? Strong Buy and Hold tightly and Do not give any single share to any Shorters per FREE of Charge!!! Good Lucks to All"""
"If we surpass above $5, we will see $15-$25 in a very small span due to drastic increase of investors numbers including big whales incoming and additional big investments by institutions, and so forth together with a lots of Meme stock investors!Let’s screw the shorts with all our best and only solutions are ""Strong Buy and Hold tight!"" Also another key thing to remember is 'low to zero risk' because 'FDA approval can happen literally any day effective now!'$SENS must be such disruptive Game changer in all Diabetes business sectors, in which I find it shall dominate and TOP-lead this industry exactly just like Apple  who had killed Blackberry completely to date. $SENS($4.00) vs$DXCM ($500.00) : Guess WHAT will happen!//Glta!"
"ok my thoughts about the potential, after the 365 there Will Be a device also for non diabetic, so i think prof athletics, but also pre surgering measering , o my God that would be huge. and al the patents are defending IT wow."
"let's be for real, once approved selling 100,000 unit's @ a cost of 5000 per year = 1/2 Billion easy"
Who mentioned yesterday that today sens would go to $3.5. Jump out!
"Whenever I see InvestorPlace issuing warnings about this stock, I know something’s good will happen."
Crazy that people in today’s society will believe anything that is put out. It is tough I get it. Especially when you are served a turd sandwich around every corner. Lies and BS surround all of us at the current moment. Do your own research and base your findings on that. The actual truth is available you just have to put in the time. Cheers!!!
Wondering why I haven’t seen anybody talking about Douglas (director) selling $867k worth of stock last two days…
"18 million shares today , almost 2 billion $ market cap "
Dexcom has increased their advertising as of late because they know the Eversense 180 is a game changer.
Geez my limit order didn’t fulfill. I had to add on the market price. Because I would hate to have to chase this stock as it goes up .
shorters be like

I'm so tired of hearing about MEME stocks. SENS lifechanging innovation is why I purchased this stock and I think all the longs have the same mindset. Let's get 180 approval and then 360 approval and watch organic growth.
gotta say I'm extremely okay with the daily growth as of late
SQUEEZE SOON !
"H.C. Wainwright analyst Vernon Bernardino initiated coverage of Senseonics with a Buy rating and $6 price target. As the only long-term continuous glucose monitor system on the market in both the U.S. and Europe, Eversense is ""highly differentiated"" from other systems, Bernardino tells investors in a research note. He believes Eversense has proven safety and efficacy in real-world management of diabetes."
There is this publication by the name of InvestorPlace. During the last month they have published 2 articles trashing the company and its stock. This is a great sign we are going higher because short sellers seem to be panicking to pay for a publication to convince people this is a poor investment!!
Set your limit-sell orders! My previously made one was rejected just now (read my past posts here for my theory if interested). Just set it for some random high number (I go anywhere between $400-499/share lol) and hopefully others will do the same! Good luck everyone!
"feel bad that some of you sold too early...""You have to Risk it for the Biscuit!"""
"Lets not be late to the party....any moment FDA approval, Europe 180 already approved and making a lot of sales, DEXACOM killer for sure, dexacom stock valuation way way over compared to SENS. Folks already switching to SENS, way cheaper and newer technology. BUY BUY BUY. Big investment banks has loaded on this stock"
I will be adding more to my 12k shares. I will be holding for at least 3years. I have 3 family members waiting for the 180 days approval they are currently on Dexcom and can’t wait to get off it.
Hahaha all this reaction when People see RED . Hey boys here is not a lotto play. You can not win 1 million in 7 days . Go read more about investissement and then come back.
"SENS ""Moments"" : It is going to be "" historic SENS Moments"" by its having real own ""updated solutions and good news"" and""Wow!! Big Rally is now all stand by and ready to go!!"" The points are ,as per recent many good news and articles to have been released to the public on $SENS CGM XL 180 by CNBC, Yahoo Fanance Video, and Healthline, Investor Place ,Stockinvest.us, Zacks Equity Research, and etc, all they currently forsee, ""Big Rally is just about to start!"" due to such big Momentums and Catalysts like1) Recently released good Promise Study report - Efficacy is fully verified like #1 quality levels of Accuracy 2) Very sound Revenue streaming via Q1& Q2 earnings reports to date3) FDA180-DAY approval is imminent 4)Big Institutions & whales are entering into SENS familyy 5) Stock transactions daily average volumes by more than 100 million and more 6) Every day the share VALUE of $SENS is drastically increasing as such big momentums and Catalysts are coming near up to $SENS 7)Russell 3000 Indexing,and so forth.IN THIS REGARD,: In earnest, it looks it is very clear and certain that Big Rally is likely to start very soon! BE prepared in advance!At this juncture,I believe,Anything under $5.00 must be ""a super bargain"", considering they beat earnings, the landmark results, and additional catalysts moving forward.FDA approval is basically in the pocket. Again Everyday is a day closer to it, and,""so everyday $SENS is increasing in VALUE! Strong BUY and Hold tight, and please enjoy $SENS Big Moments very comfortably effective next week. Do not miss your chance to be on board per on time without hesitation again,and this must be ""real Gold mine and Gem"" all for you and your family!!!Glta and Very Sincerely!"
The short squeeze is forming now. There is little doubt. FDA approval catalyst will not be required for the squeeze. Even a positive PR on FDA progress or an expected date of the decision would ignite the squeeze faster and more violent. The momentum created by buyers and Diamond hands has put the shorts in a pickle. Most shorts are in the money. They can not get it if you do not give them your shares. Consider setting your sell at double figures. At $6 you will probably get taken out quickly. The long/short war is on. Thank you Diamond hands.
SENS is near invisible now. There is no question a major increase in sales will be required to maintain 3X. Major free press will hit upon FDA approval. This will dramatically affect invisibility. SENS is unquestionably the technology leader. Means little with anemic sales. Technology leaders with FDA approval of a game changing medical technology either get their marketing/sales ramped up or one of the big boys will take them out. The Big Boys have excellent technology and SENS has leapfrogged them. Either way we win big time. I believe sales will ramp up exponentially and we can help. Get the word out. Not one of my four friends and family members who are afflicted with diabetes even heard of SENS and neither has their doctors. This will change. That is our bet.
""" No Doubt"" that $SENS shall dominate this Diabetes markets soonest even by 180-days FDA Approval device while $DXCM currently has only 10 to 14 days! And, the FDA approval is just around corner!!! Please be prepared for it in advance!!! And further,in case $SENS has 365-day Device by FDA approval by early 2023 or a bit earlier(end 2022), it is to be 100% second to none products in this Diabetes business markets, and it is Game Over! "
"1 step back, two steps forward"
4.20 today
We don’t even need FDA approval yet! We just need the shorts to panic & cover!:)))
"Investor Place, what a joke. Literally the 2 & 3 sentence are wrong. Sense did pull back, over 50% in fact from its winter highs and it never went below 2 in July. It was basically above 3 the entire month. If the authors can’t do basic research then you have no need to pay attention to what they have to say."
My question:what will bring SP down before FDA decision on the 180 days Device? It looks to me that all sort arguments have already been tried.
"Big time squeeze is forming. If we duplicate this performance next week the squeeze will be on full blown. We do not need it but it is happening, like it or not. Plenty of room to run."
"The incessant posting of pending/imminent FDA approval is ridiculous.The best info we have is still what was said at Q2 earnings, which pointed to some potential delays (covid related, and with Delta ramping up it makes sense) and an expectation that approval should happen before year end.The rest is just noise."
Not selling a single share.
okay all you experts/geniuses....lets hear what your thoughts on today's action will be .....Red or Green??
$AABB backed by gold 
Nice nice adds up more...thanks to the panic penny traders...
Are y'all sure about the FDA approves it oris that a way to keep one from taking a quick profit? I know it's a thumbs down post so I will start the action on myself
"FDA Approval :Good News ""excerpted"" from Woodland Report today on August.19th.2021. With FDA approval for the Eversense XL expected by the end of the third quarter(September. 30.2021), Senseonics will start to eat at the market share of the incumbent companies in the industry! In addition,the real game changer will come with the Eversense 365, as it will open up the Type II market to this new type of CGM devices. Here the opportunity is really huge and they face no competition and none is expected anytime soon either as their product is already patented.Senseonics (SENS) Path To Glory and Its Potential To Secure Dominance and Revolutionize Diabetes Care///Excerpt ends. Wow! This is a real good news for all investors here at SESN and please be prepared for all boarding per on time. Glta "
"That's it. Short are running for cover.Longs, please hold tight and we'll squeeze them to bottom and they never come back to us.Go SENS Go."
Big shots threatening by price dropping small investors like meBe careful we will win hold hold
"Fantastic product, highly likely to get FDA approval and then it’s full focus on marketing and distribution this product in US and WW. Product is great and 10% of us people have diabetes, great potential. It’s all about if they make good and right actions in marketing and distribution process now. Costs for sales and revenues from sales. And scale it up big time."
"Never before have I been in on the ground floor of a stock with the potential that SENS possesses. I believe that it has what's needed in terms of technology, management, marketing and distribution to be a true market disruptor over the next several years. Patience and the ability to handle volatility will be required, but the rewards may be significant in a few years."
"SENS (a gift at these price levels; can you say DIABETIC monopoly coming) & ACRX my top 2 buys. Yahoo Finance PT on ACRX = 600% upside! ACRX 2022 a huge year, read some of the posts out today..."
The people who wait before buying are going to pay more money to buy SENS.. Buy and be patient no worries .
Do not even waste your time reading the investor place article. I made the mistake and definitely killed some brain cells. Good news when this starts to happen that means the shorts are getting nervous. Cheers!!!
"Although Sens is going up (great), I am seeing many other similar stocks going up so it looks like $ are going back into small cap pharms. Awesome!! I have CTXR and the trend is very similar in the last few days."
Hold your shares and not give them away for nothing here. We have FDA soon! It’s a good long term investment. Sens will crash the other diabetes companies with their new products.
Ascensia Diabetes Care has the right to terminate the partnership with SENS today. The excuse for SP is going up may reflect no serious issue between those two company. GLTA.
"Google is either ""foolishly"" on our side here, or we actually have something!Me: Everyone keeps hyping up Dexcom's G7.... what's the deal?Google:What is the difference between dexcom G6 and G7?The G7 will be about 60% smaller than the G6 – slimmer, more svelte, and easier to disguise under clothing so you can dig out your skin-tight leather pants and flaunt your spandex bike shorts worry-free.

Price getting a lil' out of hand for the shorts; expect a large sell off sometime soon as they try to scare us to take our mild profits. I'm in this for loooong haul with my small 1000 shares-- both my sister and I are diabetic so we know all to well how life changing this companies technology is. The senseonics product is not yet approved up here in Canada but the moment it is we are running to our endocrinologist to arrange for us to get one.And just so y'all know-- we are a single payer healthcare system that is ran through our provincial governments and funded via taxes. When this gets approved by the provincial healthcare you will see hundred of thousands of Canadians lining up as it will in no way be 'out of pocket'. Ahhhhhh... I love our socialized medical system ;)

Sometimes I dream of FDA approval hitting in October and then Cathy Woods revealing she's investing in SENS. We'd go from 3 to 30 overnight!! That would be a helluva ride wouldn't it?
"Don't know why people expect FDA news today, it's estimated around Oct with optimism. Today is just the contract expiration date with the marketing engine. They have the right to extend it or cancel without FDA news as of end of today. People just hoping on for the wrong reason, but hey, keep it coming. I'll be selling at around $100 in few years.

"So what would be cost of the implant, and how many people would have a pill implanted (I'm not sure I would) will insurance cover it? New to biotech just asking on this board who is familiar with this treatment"
"Please review the numbers. Market cap for Dxcm is $50 billion on 2b in sales97 mm shares outstanding equates to $23 revenue per shareSens has 445mm shares so getting to DXCM price is virtually impossibleIf Sens revenue goes to $200mm in 2-3 years which would be an aggressive suggestion, we could see $10-12 from this metric alone. Growth would give us another boost so we could have a $20 stock with a $9b market cap.My bet is that we get bought out within 6 months of approval at $12-15. That result would be a very successful investment for all of us"
Buy this stock and forget… come back in a 2 years and surprise yourself. This stock is gonna make many people millionaires. But the key is buy and hold
shorts be like on FDA approval day
"Cup and handle: Feb-June, cup; June-July, handle. August-Sept, breakout."
I invest upon two fundamental understandings. At the end of the day medical stocks will reign supreme because diabetes is only going to increase. And in bad times the central banks will support medical institutions over electric cars.

That means 49 more days. So this weekend and premarket Monday is 6% of the remaining time.

I am so looking forward for the FDA approval soon for the 180 days system. Question I don’t have answer why the company is unable to sell the 90 days system that is approved by the FDA?
The Institutions are relaxing..the day traders are busy..the penny profiters are getting their penny..the panic sellers are buying back...lol...lol..the longs are watching in the sideline...lol
You can tell clueless investors by looking at their portfolio. They have more tech stocks than medical.
I'm not a diabetic but I belong to an Eversense group to get a gage on the product from an non-invester view. Here is a comment from this morning.'I drove 2 hours before the Crack of dawn to have a consult with my Eversense endo. My insertion is scheduled for October 7th. Her schedule is jam packed.'
I was just reading articles on SENS and both articles said that in December it would be a couple months for the fda approval here it is 8 months and also looked on fda calendar don't even see SENS listed am I missing something
"I am holding long and strong.. I am so excited about sens and make more than 10 of my friends and relatives to buy.. they are all holding for few years. I am sure that many investors did the same.After the institutions got in, big shorts volume and fda Approval around the corner. It is hard to see big correction. Maybe we can test $3.5 but not less..Sens is 45% of my portfolio, this is a huge risk which I am willing to take. I think that we will see $6 before fda and the approval will push sp higher to $10-12 Cheers from Sweden"
Up in pre market. USD 4 comes today my friends! Shorts starts to cover
Good luck today to all of our dedicated $SENS investors
"Zom had $0 revenue in 2020. Sp went up from $0,1 to $3. Market capital became more than $3 billion at one point with 0 revenue.Sens can go soooo high before and on fda approval"
My prediction is that when Sens gets FDA approval Dexcom well fall much faster than Sens Goes up.
"You don’t know what you’re talking abou!!!You do know the market cap is listed on the summary page, right. Or maybe not. You can calculate it yourself # of shares outstanding time’s the price. In this case, SENS market cap is 1.612 billion. Market cap of dxcm is $49 billion. Next time you post, please educate yourself"
Thanks guys. We got back to $4.Go SENS Go.

The bears are camped out at 4 bucks
"Sens. I am holding. My prices are from 2.57 to 4.35 Haven’t sold a single share. Accumulating and institutional buying and holding is more the 30% of float There is absolutely no reason to sell this stock unless you're so impatient that you just can't wait for FDA approval and subsequent quarterly increase in revenue. With Ascenia on board for marketing and distribution, the high number of institutional investors (as so well-researched by @J.K.), and the unrivaled technology of Eversense, this stock is a hidden gem at this point. Soon it will no longer be hidden. Just need patience ... that's it. Buy, hold, and be patient. Don't even look at the share price day-to-day right now because there are no catalysts expected until FDA decision in Sept./Oct. Until then the price will just move slightly up/down as it has been for months.This is gem like I found NIO and sawa. Hold it and this will take care of your retirement and future of kids."
let's see if shorts can keep price lower till September 3rd. then there should be no pressure after the 4th. Shorts have a lot to lose on the 4th if price is above $4.
Read what FDA had to say about sens when approving the 90 day in 2018. This should be the best indication on what's to come .https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-continuous-glucose-monitoring-system-fully-implantable-glucose-sensor-and
You have to love how the stock is performing...I feel lucky to have bought in 2 weeks ago
What a recovery 
$4 today!!
4 percent a day isn't very exciting but I'll take it everyday.
Very soon..People will be saying any price under $10 is a steal...This gem is a solid investment.It only requires patience...What you see now is market manipulations to weed off inexperienced investors.
Let’s make the shorts nervous today ! Let’s make those institutions who try to profit off the man sweat! Could this be GME or AMC? 20 plus percent short! Power to the people! Let’s make shortie pay for their SENS:))))
"Looks like the market's giving more credibility to SENS. The diabetes industry is so lucrative that if you're able to hold on for the next five years, SENS will be able to pay off your mortgage and kids' tuitions...that is, if they're not acquired by a prudent suitor. HODL!"

"One cent increase in the share price, means $100 increased profit in my investment account. I guess this indicates how much I believe in the company and its innovation! Good luck"
16.97 million share buy at 2:54 on Friday for SENS? Am I seeing that correctly on the chart
Watch this week …FDA coming waiting for this - year …loading
"Im a type 1 since childhood. Been on Medtronic pump since 2002 and on their cgm since 2010. The pump is great but the cgm is #$%$ in my experience. The inaccurate readings and constant issues I've been having have forced me to look elsewhere for a better cgm.I called Sensionics and am in the process of getting this implemented. For a type 1 diabetic accuracy in readings is imperative, and a 90-180 day lifespan for a sensor is incredibly promising. Only issue is that it will not communicate with my pump but I'll figure it out.Medtronic told me the they focus on their pumps and cgm is secondary which in my opinion makes little sense. I even told them to buy out Sens or even Dexcom so they can own cgm technology that actually works. I've been dealing with diabetes for 35yrs now and to say its frustrating is an understatement. Good luck to all longs."
"There is no need for this to be the ""next Dexcom"" or where they have to match sales figures or become a threat to the big boys, ect...Think of a small soda company-never going to put Coke or Pepsi out of business--but if they are making good revenue, whittling away debt and eventually turn profit, that's all that matters"
"$SENS : ""The sooner entering the better rewardings!"" : Sens investors need to understand the attractiveness of this stock is because it is only $4. The potential for it to double triple quadruple are very high and quickly compare to investing in a mature company like $500 Dexcom.Diabetes is a huge market and Sens gives patients a new options for treatment and it will take time to adopt just like how electric car first began. Sens is the future just like electric car is. 180 days FDA approval are extremely critical to proof Sens science team capabilities to advance product. Once FDA approved 180 days product, investors will be much more confident on the 365 days approval.///Glta!"
Thanks for the dips this morning. I added more.
"Notice how EVERY article bashing SENS turns off their commenting..... You know what the real problem is? The people at the top do NOT want us ""lower class people"" potentially making oodles of money. All of this downward movement is a constant calculated strategy to scare away investors, but hopefully these repeated FAILED attempts to tank this stock are noticed by the people running the show at Senseonics, and it's only fueling their drive to succeed more! Forget and ignore any negative sentiments regarding SENS because they are just ""opinions"" (with an agenda) that are INTENTIONALLY leaving out the part where Senseonics' promise study was a HUGE success. Now why would ANYONE believe this company isn't going anywhere after that?! This is a guaranteed win, and the people at the top know this. Maybe we should start playing their game and really upsets them - tell your family and friends to buy in on this gold mine, and lets show Wallstreet what the people are REALLY made of. Here's the kicker, this ISN'T a meme stock! Good luck everyone!"
"Black Rock owns more than 26 million shares, institutions holding is up"
"This is the part of the 8/27 article investors should focus on, not the rest of the blah, blah, blah:“As you may know, the company may have massive potential down the road with its Eversense diabetes monitoring product.In the coming years, the growth of this product could push the company’s sales from the $14 million projected for this year, to as much as $200 million by 2025.”"
"how utd is Yahoo? number of institutional holders increased, 235 now"
This is not a short squeeze. It is just increased accumulation period. when the volume will jump to 100+ million shares a day than the short squeeze will commence.
So? 5 dollar pps today or 3.00..Come on WALL you answered me last night.. 
I can guarantee that the FDA will announce tomorrow. It'll happen right after I sell my shares for a tiny and high taxed profit.Thank me later.

"@molly. As a husband of a type 1 diabetic I have an idea of what you are going through but not to the extent of being a parent of a child living with it. I believe if any company could produce a CGM that is implanted and really works for great length of time would be fantastic. Many people don’t realize the struggle a type 1 goes through. My wife has tried several pumps and sensors and they work great one time and the next time not so much. It is a constant daily struggle a type 1 has to go through. Your levels are to high or to low. The chance of a diabetic coma always lingers. It’s no fun to find your loved one in that situation. Stay strong, your daughter needs you to be as well as she doing the same. I sure hope for all type ones out there that this CGM can be a life changer"
The battle for…4 bucks
Shorts would be wise to cover while shares can be found.
" FDA approval is imminent! Get in before it flies! Dont sell until FDA approval. Not even after that! 365 days CGM in the pipeline.SENS value stock is positioned to gain in appreciation. It can easily reach double digits as the demand for implantable glucose monitoring systems are on the rise. The American Diabetes Association published results on June 21 2021 of their Evaluation of the Next Generation 180-Day Long-Term Implantable Eversense CGM System, the conclusion was Hyperglycemia at 180mg/dL was detected in 99%.AMAZING!Glta and Very Sincerely!"
I wonder if Schwab knows this is about to get approved and is looking for shares to short when it pops— well look somewhere else you can’t have mine
"Looking back at the price change the day after the 90 day FDA approval, the stock went up a little-biggish but not major-but there are differences from then and now. I think most of the anticipated approval is baked in and the bigger test is sales for it after approval. I think more realistically we can see a jump to maybe $10 on FDA approval but a pullback to $6. Hopefully we will be seeing commercials of people skydiving and horseback riding while wearing the new 180 day Eversense-then the real good will start to come...."
Pretty impressive climb after some heavy accumulation. Volume hitting 3 million shares in the 1st 10 minutes.
"Will have to see how this finishes the day… but volume seems on the lower side compared to the 10 day average. Personally, I think a lot of it early on, was short covering…. Will be glad to be back at the screen full-time starting next week. Hard to trade and hold a job "
"Sell your $AMC and buy $SENS; get 10:1 now, and a company with a positive future"
"Tom, 100%? FDA approval will result in 300%. Sales will increase dramatically and fast. The key is, supply lines, manufacturing and distribution are all in place. Seamless ramp up. You will see. SENS is near invisible now and that will change rapidly. Big boys control the market now with very good products but SENS has leapfrogged the technology. FDA approval is certainly still a question mark. That is why you can steal this stock if you are a firm believer in FDA approval. If you are not a believer in FDA approval stay away. SENS is a big time risk/reward play."
I sold some other stocks on friday and have $5000 which will be used to add more sens on any dip.
"I saw 800K shares buying at $4.05 at the close. Looks like this could be good news, this should take off real soon."

WHERE'S the bottom today? I'm buying more. Thanks weak hands!!!
"Upper resistance on the 4 hour is $4.07 or $4.08. Looking at the barcoding on the chart, it makes me think that a large Fund is exiting from their short position very slowly. We will see if this takes off after hours."
"To summarize: 1) sp increasing2) FDA pending3) institutions buying4) a revolutionary, soon to viewed essential medical monitoring deviceThe rest is ‘blah, blah, blah, ad nauseum’Long $SENS. expect fluctuations glta. Fun ride"
Elevator going up
"DXCM G6 vs SENS CGM 180-days XL :SENS twice a year is much better than having a needle insert to your tummy Diy DXCM 36x(times) a year. The transmitter is cheaper and is all you need when you travel. The sticker is also change out everyday instead of 10 days so it will stay on. G6 downside is sensor always fall off and Sens solve that problem. If you read all the complaint with G6 calibration free you will know it it still need calibration and it is more than you think. Sens offer the most accurate reading compare to all the other machine. SENS 90 days is the first generation, and they are making rapid improvement to the next generation product. Compare technology to technology in the long term, SENS will win. Even when G10 comes out, it will just be longer battery, smaller transmitter, better calibration free... Etc, but the root is the same. When SENS 4th generation comes out, it would be 365 days sensor, calibration free and transmitter free. Big difference in technology./Glta"
Diamond hands keep positive posts on the top whenever you have time. Don't let negative posts take over people minds. Let everyone do to their own DD rather than decision made of negative comments. This has become mind game rather than real value and power of the company I believe in.
"Today is probably the WSB moderators buying their positions. Then tomorrow they squeeze, SENS goes to 30, FDA is like ""uh oh, we better approve this now!"" So FDA releases approval but with typos because they rushed it. SENS shares the letter showing 1800 day device approved, stock skyrockets to $90.I sell every share. Amended release comes out at 3:59, stock crashes to $8 and i buy back in"
Anyone else wish tomorrow were Monday?
I'm betting on a close around 4.30 today. Any takers?
"There is absolutely no reason to sell this stock unless you're so impatient that you just can't wait for FDA approval and subsequent quarterly increase in revenue. With Ascenia on board for marketing and distribution, the high number of institutional investors (as so well-researched by @J.K.), and the unrivaled technology of Eversense, this stock is a hidden gem at this point. Soon it will no longer be hidden. Just need patience ... that's it. Buy, hold, and be patient. Don't even look at the share price day-to-day right now because there are no catalysts expected until FDA decision in Sept./Oct. Until then the price will just move slightly up/down as it has been for months."
.35 cents year ago. We out of the woods????
"Molly, John, etc. -- Many manufactured products are recalled, the problems are fixed, and the products are returned to service. Happens all the time. And that's the case with the 90-day Eversense hydration issue of two years ago. It will have no effect on the FDA's review of the 180-day sensor, IMO."
Knocking on the $4.00/Share door. Sheesh that was a quick recovery
It looks a little extended but I think I will be adding more pre tommo morning! Good luck this week everyone

"Senseonics’ flagship product is known as the Eversense CGM system, where “CGM” stands for Continuous Glucose Monitor.For the medical sub-community that’s focused on diabetes care, Eversense could be a real game changer.It features a water-resistant transmitter with on-body vibe alerts, as well as a very small fluorescent sensor.Plus, Eversense includes a mobile app with real-time glucose readings.It’s the only Food and Drug Administration approved long-term continuous glucose monitor. Thus, if you’re going to bet your hard-earned capital on the success of a single device, this could be a good choice.As PHC Holdings Corporation owned (and for all we know, might still own) a whopping 68,300,652 shares of Senseonics.Now, that’s what I would call a confident investor. PHC’s stake equates to 24% of the beneficially owned Senseonics shares.You know who else seems pretty confident in the company? Senseonics’ current directors and executive officers, who collectively hold 24,421,606 shares.Insider ownership demonstrates that they have skin in the game — and when it comes to investing, actions speak louder than words.Major Revenue Driver :Turning to another SEC form, a Form 8-K reveals that Senseonics is collaborating with a Swiss company, Ascensia, to distribute Senseonics’ 90-day and 180-day sensors throughout Europe.Granting Ascensia the global rights to distribute Eversense could turn out to be a major long-term revenue driver for Senseonics.///Excerpt ends.

Blackrock loading up on shares of SENS... Most undervalued stock on Wall Street...
"People pay too much attention to stock price, which means very little and you can not compare this between companies. Market capital is a way more accurate indicator. MarkCap for Sens is already 1.5-1.6B for a company with no revenue and disaster fundamentals. This value already considers future business expectations. However, FDA approval offers a lot brighter future, and will make the stock to jump, but don't think it will do like a Nuro (super low market cap), and in the long run looking at Dexcom with a 60B market cap can be a good reference for Sens (this is a 30X). However, Dexcomm is a 5000 employee company whilst Sens has only 82. To escalate the business a lot of things need to come and happen, and they will not overnight. Growth will take time. Sens is a long holder if you believe and support the technology, as I do. However, not a stock to take a big % in your portfolio, if you want to balance the risk, but this is also very personal.Good luck to all!"
The partner for marketing Sens 180 day product have rights to cancel the partnership when they want from tomorrow when no fda approval came before 1 October. It’s one of the agreements in the contract.
You are watching a 100 dollar stock in the making.
Does anyone know why advertisement has not ramped up in the United States? I would love to hear other comments.
The Short Bots are out in force today! I'm holding long though so I don't get upset when I see this.
"$SENS : When you look back next week, the today was the Dip. Buy at any price today because it will be a lot higher next week!!! Do not miss the chance to be on board for Skyrocketing per on time and "" Make Hays while Sun shines!!!"""
"I dont wanna be Mr kill joy, I've been here since the $1 days but I'm just going to say, FDA approval might and most likely won't be this month. Many and good sources have speculated October which would make since cause 1. FDA are busier than they ever have been and 2. It'll be in line with the same month of the Q2 earnings...just saying. But that doesn't mean sell because SENS from now until 2024 minimum is a solid hold."
"Many people shorted or sell sens after earning and sp rises, many have done that as well on the different resistance and sp keep rising.. I think short are covering now and people who sold to buy back at lower prices bought back.Now almost everyone is holding and waiting for fda"
No wonder HC Wainwright starts SENS at BUY with $6 target. H.C. Wainwright & Co. is one of the country’s oldest and most trusted financial institution. They are specialized on medical sector.
No FDA call today maybe tomorrow
$ coming soon
sometimes i just do not get the market.lets say sens is the absolute best product.dxcm market cap is 50 bilsens 1 bildxcm could offer 8 to 10 $ a share and just take over the company

"I accidentally bought SENS about a month or so ago. This came about after I read some article about a Billionaire named Gus, who recommended only 2 stocks- TTOO [T2 Biosystems] and SESN [Sesen Bio]. How can you not follow a recommendation from a guy named Gus.Somehow I screwed it up and bought SENS instead of SESN. The order went in and I realized I screwed it up but decided to not try to change it. I went ahead and ordered SESN and TTOO. As of now SENS is up 90%, SESN is down 70% and TTOO is down 20%. The moral of this is that if you don't know what you are doing in the first place, it doesn't matter that much if you screw up along the way."
"Good News on Senseonics today by InvestorPlace. As FDA 180-days device approval is coming very soon, I find there are many good news and articles available in favors of $SENS and below is ""Excerpted "" : ""Senseonics is a Solid Bet on Potential $42 Billion Diabetic Market""By Ian Cooper.Senseonics (NYSE:SENS) has been one of the most explosive stock on the market.Here is the Benefit of the Eversense CGM :With an implanted sensor, a transmitter, and a mobile app, patients can get accurate real-time blood sugar numbers, and act with insulin if needed. There is no need for pin pricks to test blood. Plus, users are alerted to blood sugar issues, helping them to avoid the sugar spikes and crashes some have to put up with.Better, while many implanted CGMs need to be replaced every couple of weeks, Senseonics CGM can remain implanted for up to 90 days. In fact, according a company press release, it indicated for continually measuring glucose levels in persons age 18 and older with diabetes for up to 90 days in the US and 180 days in Europe.In addition, according to Fierce Biotech contributor Conor Hale,The sensor was able to spot moments of dangerously low blood sugar, warning the user of hypoglycemia when levels dipped below 70 mg/dL 93% of the time and below 60 mg/dL 87% of the time.The Bottom Line on Senseonics Stock :With a growing diabetic market, Senseonics CGM could be a massive game-changer in a potential $42 billion market. In addition, the CGM outperforms its competition. Plus, it can measure blood sugar for up to 90 days in the U.S., and up to 180 days in Europe.We also have to remember the diabetic market is sizable.Right now, about 463 million people all over the world are dealing with it. In the U.S. alone, the US CDC says 34.2 million Americans or one in 10 are diabetic. On top of that, 88 million Americans (one in three) are pre-diabetic.With that said, there's no reason the SENSE couldn't double, or triple with patience.///Excerpt ends.Wow,Wow, I believe THIS is one of very good news from InvestorPlace today for investors and Please be blessed in advance for your boarding as early as possible and ""Strong Buy and Hold tight and Do not give any single share to any Shorters per FREE of Charge.""Glta and Very Sincerely!"

Researchers found the Senseonics Eversense implantable CGM to be more accurate than the Dexcom G5 and the Abbott Freestyle Libre Pro, the professional version of the CGM, devices.“It should be noted that the Eversense and the G5 were calibrated twice daily, and the Libre Pro is designed not to allow calibrations,” Rabab Z. Jafri, MD, a fellow in endocrinology at Massachusetts General Hospital, told Endocrine Today.Jafri and colleagues assessed the accuracy of the three systems used by 23 participants as part of a 6-week, free-living, outpatient bionic pancreas study. Researchers compared the glucose measurements obtained with the Nova Biomedical StatStrip Xpress meter, which was used to calibrate the Eversense and G5 devices, with readings from all three CGMs when they were recorded within 5 minutes of the meter readings (n = 829 sets) and also compared a greater number of readings between the G5 and Eversense (n = 2,277 sets). The primary outcome was mean absolute relative difference. Lower mean absolute relative difference indicates greater accuracy.Among the three systems, the Eversense had the lowest mean absolute relative difference at 14.8%, with the G5 (16.3%) and the Libre Pro (18%) higher (P = .004). The Eversense again had a lower mean absolute relative difference than the G5 in a comparison between the two (15.1% vs. 16.9%; P = .008).//Excerpt ends."

Also SENS is primed for a major short squeeze. Any significant catalyst will drive the squeeze and fast. It could happen pre-FDA approval and the squeeze SP will be maintained or revisited upon FDA approval.

95% of diabetic patients prefer Senseonics glucose monitors over DexCom....
"Of courses there will be a lot of volatility after the FDA approval of 180 but I am betting buy out rumors, whether true or false, will start soon after sparking even more demand for the stock. I believe PHC/Ascensia will buy them and change the ticker to Ascensia to basically go public (they are private now). If that turns out to be wrong, how would Abbott or Dexcom not buy them? They are years behind in developing an implantable like SENS has and would probably need to license SENS patents if they did want to develop."
"William, you are are a larger whale than me. I must disagree. Short interest is going down daily. It is clear and absolutely no question. You will see in the next report available to all retail investors. My heavy investment in SENS had nothing to do with a short squeeze. The fact is a short squeeze is forming. Look at the momentum moves on green candles. 12 million shares less than average volume. Diamond hands are here! Shorts can not get there profits from me or you and many SENS holders who possess the same psychology. Not because of some MEME BS. FDA failure is a huge risk. FDA approval will trigger visibility and astronomical sales growth (not astronomical sales). It is clear holders of SENS are believers. Profit taking from weak hands has actually allowed shorts to escape with some pain but not as much as what is to come. 30 days ago we were trading around $3 and early June $2. ""S"" says: ""20%+ shares are shorted, that's 3X the average daily volume. Recent volume is about 14M so that's 6X recent avg. daily volume. Do I smell a major short squeeze coming? WSB are waiting for the right moment to pounce."" I agree. The beauty of it is FDA approval could hold the short squeeze driven price. The FDA approval possibility has been around for a long time. No news and $3.88 from 3 in a month. Short squeeze is forming, weak hands are diminishing; and strong hands and strong believers are increasing. 4 friends and family members afflicted with this terrible disease have all informed their doctors of their interest. Many average guys and gals like me are doing the same thing. Powerful it is. SENS has true game changing potential. With a 365 day device in the works."
Today their partner for marketing and selling their 180 day product expires. The partner have now rights to cancel the contract because no approval from FDA. Huge risk and price regarding their sales and growth forecast.
As soon as share price goes down.. shorts come out.. as soon as they will get squeezed they will not even find the place to hide…Don’t listen to shorts.. they just want to steal your money.. do your own DD and decide
Just a thought If day traders sell prior to close of market each day- then they’re taking a bigger risk by missing a big announcement

Does the Ascensia agreement expire tomorrow without FDA approval of the 180 day unit?

"$SENS : ""Extremely Undervalued "" This stock has been extremely undervalued to date, and it can surely deserve just to ride up to $6.00~$7.00 without any news! People who have already done this research already knows what they are investing, in which they called it as “Gem or Gold mine! ”And, everybody is just worried about what if they don’t get approved by the FDA. If you really have done your research, then you shouldn’t even be worried at all because such good reports and records of FDA180 days sensor device have already been released to all investors and to the public. Senseonic fully understand what FDA will be looking forward for their device to get that approval. 99.99% it will get approved. I wouldn’t be surprised to see this stock at least $50-70 by the end of 2021 right after FDA180-DAY approval device and we'd better wait and see together! ""Super Strong Buy and Hold tight and Do not give any single share to any Shorters per FREE of Charge and sell it WHEN YOU are much satisfied!!!"" Glta"
The reason the stop went down without any reason is because there is huge open interest for $4 call expiring pn 09/03/21. Do not sell the stocks. this is all manipulation by Market Maker
Up 4% again on no news and 10 million shares less than average volume traded and shorts are trying to cover. Diamond hands are very strong as they came here as believers in SENS to buy and hold. Shorts can not get our shares. The pickle is tightening. Word is spreading in spite of SENS near nonresistant marketing. SENS is near invisible. We all know that is going to change.
You have no SENSE if you sell SENS now.
"Sens has the 90 day , sure the 180 would be better but 90 days is already better than 10 to 14 day devices . The last earnings report , Sens is gaining traction/ marketshare. Fda approval of the 180 day may come by eoy but another earnings report will be here soon . I'm more interested in the report , sales than the potential 180 for to me , everyone that uses the 90 will eventually use the 180. Sales! , move stock prices . 2022 will be exciting,2023 to 2025 will be unforgettable . Buy the dips."

"Diamond hands are not allowing shorts to cover. The price action on lower volume is clear. Yesterday when we were down $.10, I predicted we close strong green. Why, because shorts are desperately trying to cover. We will close higher from here today. Short squeeze is beginning before FDA approval. FDA approval will hold short squeeze share price. Get ready for the ride. Thanks to Diamond hands."

"SENS Stock : Why CGMs Are a Diabetes Game-Changer? : ""Excerpted from InvestorPlace"" Diabetes is a big problem and it’s only getting worse. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 10.5% of the U.S. population was diagnosed as diabetic in 2020. That’s 34.2 million people. In addition, 88 million adults are pre-diabetic. And, those who have diabetes have an elevated risk of heart attack, stroke, lower limb amputation or even blindness. Diabetes is even a leading cause of kidney failure.Treatment for this disease requires insulin to manage blood sugar levels. This, in turn, requires monitoring those levels. Historically, that has meant physical pin pricks through the day to test blood — a practice that can be painful, intrusive and limited in terms of data. After all, diabetics are only able to draw blood so many times a day.But there is now another solution to the problem : CGMs. Essentially, they use an implanted sensor that constantly measures blood glucose levels, then send that data to an app or device via a transmitter. Someone wearing a CGM gets real-time data and a warning if their levels are starting to spike or drop. That’s a big deal, because they can just adjust their insulin or food intake proactively in response. So, given the size of the diabetes market, you can already see the potential for SENS stock here.Additionally, while diabetes management is the primary goal of CGM manufacturers like Senseonics, another secondary market has developed. The market? Wellness-focused individuals — from professional athletes to tech personalities — have been popularizing CGMs. Basically, having instant blood glucose readings helps these people optimize their diets based on blood-sugar spikes.The World’s First Long-Term Implantable SensorSo, why the excitement over the Eversense CGM in particular? Well, it’s actually the longest-lasting sensor by far — and that’s huge. Why? Because having an implanted CGM sensor replaced is a medical procedure, an appointment that takes time and money. Competing CGMs usually have to have their implanted sensor replaced every seven to 14 days.On the other hand, though, the Eversense CGM fluorescent sensor is the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved long-term implantable sensor. In the States, it can be worn for 90 days at a time. In Europe, it can be worn for 180 days before replacement (Senseonics has applied for the 180-day window in the U.S. as well). That makes Eversense far more convenient — and cuts down on expensive, inconvenient medical appointments. Which would you rather use? And which option do you suppose your insurance company would rather pay for? That’s why I see big growth in the future for SENS stock.

Had a conversation with another SENS investor about a rumor that the FDA will give decision on SENS on October 15th of this year. I haven't seen or heard anything. Anybody hear anything?
"Best predictor of future behavior is past behavior, I bet she closes at 4.25 ."
What do y’all think is realistic after FDA? Obviously something like NURO would be insane but highely unlikely.. $8-$10 perhaps??
"$SENS : ""The sooner entering the better rewardings!"" : Sens investors need to understand the attractiveness of this stock is because it is only $4.00. The potential for it to double triple quadruple are very high and quickly compare to investing in a mature company like $500 Dexcom.Diabetes is a huge market and Sens gives patients a new options for treatment and it will take time to adopt just like how electric car first began. Sens is the future just like electric car is. 180 days FDA approval are extremely critical to proof Sens science team capabilities to advance product.

Ok somebody knows something. This is continuing to trend up daily now. And yes we all know the FDA approval is pending. But with all that the FDA has going on and how backed up they say they are right now who knows when they will get around to approval for this. So thoughts on why this is trending up now without any news or guidance? And does anyone have any updated info on when they expect approval?
"Comparing to 90 day EverSense, 180 day EverSense is so much more improved CGM system in all aspects, and 180 day EverSense FDA approval is just matter of time. FDA just completed its major task to approve PFE's covid19 vaccine, should have more resource back to its normal process, hopefully 180 day Eversense FDA approval will happen before the end of 2021."

"Hey Folks.Throughout my daily investing travels I have gotten a bit more into the Bio-Techs lately. As SENS came across my radar over the past few months, I started doing my DD. My biggest question is this for anyone who would/could be willing to help:Why has this stock basically gone nowhere since its June 2018 approval of its 90-Day device? I am thinking that the company is basically a “one-trick pony” per se and that the Eversense device alone really is not a big revenue generator? I see that its share price peaked at about $4.91 in June of 2018 only to continuously drop over the next three years to as low as about $0.38. WOW! Obviously, it became a Reddit stock for awhile but I think that phase has passed. I do not see why the FDA would not approve the 180-Day device. If approval does happen, then what? Another short-term uptick and then back down again? Any thoughts. Anyone. Thank you in advance for any, and all, that may respond to my inquiry."
"Grandview Research, the market for the cgm device industry this year is approximately $5.28 billion. By the end of 2028, it could almost double to $10.36 billion. SENS shareholders will get their FAT piece of cgm pie if they hold long and strong."

"Whenever you see a 5% drop with no news, it shows that a Hedge fund is involved. Also if you look at the precise chart pattern of the takedown, its very obvious.

"It doesn’t matter if they get approval if they can’t show any impressive growth and profit. 180 day in EU haven’t been any success. There are no marketing here at all anywhere. No one knows about this 180 day product here, not even doctors!"
FDA approval is pending and no one is a maven as to date of approval but it’s coming. Meantime holding is the move I am taking. Even at $6 a share by year end it will break through its current 52 week high. At this point holding is the smart move to bet on.

They post scores of meaningless responses to the original post., which is often a cut and paste from posters right here, to make it appear legit and give themselves multiple thumbs up to rank to the top instantly. A key thing to look at is an embedded URL. Yahoo does a poor job distinguishing these things.. They rely on the community.. When you see it, report abuse.

Hello my SENS longs. Any new news on the FDA approval?
One thing tho is the FDA approval sure doesn't look 'baked in' at all!It's my opinion that we're going to see a significant spike in SP. Timing will be crucial since so many want quick profits and like to pay enhanced taxes.
Have a feeling the FDA approval is close the way the stock is trading
Shorts are working really hard to spread FUDS to steal your shares...Make no mistake about selling..This is a $6 to $8 stock before FDA...
I am subscribed to SENS email list. Today I received email notification of SEC filings related to insider buy or selling. Can someone smart explain these filing?
Is this the calm before the storm?
The date of the contract August 31st with Ascensia got redacted. We should be good.
"End of the month margin calls, Shorts be like"
"Nice to see, most are holding, really short play."
"If you could compose songs that would be top hits on the radio earning $millions, would you do that or become just a grade school music teacher? That's the same difference Between great investors or investment advisors."
They are back to wanting to short again— I received an email about enrolling my SENS shares in a fully funded program— go you know what Schwab— I’m not interested you can’t have them…it’s disgusting to me a broker would do this— basically bet again you their client.. go pound sand..

"SENS and IDEX If only you know how the market works. The system was designed to take advantage of retail investors. Shorts and WS sharks and greedy and will make you panic selling and add more in to their portfolio while retailers small gullible people loose. But if the 'little guys' band together and HOLD together, it's a guaranteed win. This is not speculation, it is a fact. If we collectively buy and HOLD, and put higher sell order then no one ca borrow your shares and short sell and use against you. no matter what, we will win BIG and walk away wealthy. Our resistance is not the short selling hedge funds. It is our emotions: Greed and Fear. Greed when we see it make $10 or $20 jumps and want to grab small profits at the expense of others. Fear when we see it start dropping and panic sell. Ask me why! Okay, I'll tell you why........... hedge funds are still shorting this stock today because they believe we are not capable of overcoming these two emotions as a collective group. Those of us that have been in this for weeks and months have had a rollercoaster ride as they tried to force the price down, but we eventually drove the price back up because we stuck together collectively. So, a warm welcome to the new planet of APES. Now, this is not financial advice, it is more about......... Do you have what it takes to stand your ground and make history and change your lives for you and your family? Or are you just after peanuts that you will spend in a couple days? At Starbucks. ?Be prepared to ride the storm, no matter how long it takes. Get rid of greed and fear, and put on the ARMOUR of PATIENCE and RESILIENCE. Like Warren Buffet said....."" the stock market is a tool for transferring wealth from the impatient to the patient."" And as Mark Cuban said......""Hold if you can"" and ""Now we will see what WS is made of."" So, Enough is enough! The 'little guys' will win this because we are strong together. They are going to put up a fight. Just HOLD, and keep buying if you can afford it. We do not get charged interests for holding our shares. ""STAY THE COURSE""! All will be well in the end.I believe in CMG technology and Solar technology for our farmers. They do not have luxury to run to gas stations so solar tractors are new John deer of tomorrow and IDEX is front runner up like NIO and Tesla and TTM With population and growth. I haven’t sold a single share. But adding more every chane I get. See you all at Bar cheers with Blue label."
I truly believe this will run like NURO did.I know our float is different but I believe we have great interests just lurking waiting to pounce close to approval time.until then smart money is playing other movers.just my opinion. I'm really not that smart but I have great intuition. been holding and buying the dips for months. (March 2021).I have influenced many people to look at and invest in SENS.I believe!
Got me a few more today. Also check out October calls got some of those as well. Hopefully my timing is good

congrats longs for a great month! up over $1 in one month! have a great weekend!!
I can please have a thumbs up if anyone on this board feels that we can close at or over $4 today.
So being as the 90 day sensor is already out I’ve just been thinking that why would there be a massive increase to 20 or more even thought a 180 sensor is a big thing but don’t you think it would just jump the stock to either 10-12 then drop back to like 6 or something? Thoughts on this anyone ?

"Quick reminder to all long term investors, if you have done your DD and are investing for the long term expecting double digits pps, is it that important if you got in at 2, 3 or 4.

Not one stock has seen massive returns without such a volatility. Know what you own and best of luck to all longs. Our best days are ahead, that's for sure!"
