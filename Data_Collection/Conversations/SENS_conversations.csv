They had an order from big boys and it was do Not let this stock to go over $4 and if it did bash it… they play their owe games and we play ours and if we hold we will win. This stock has been over $4 several times as every time they tried to manipulate it and pull it down but real investors know this gem and its bright future so it bounced back
Diamond hands keep positive posts on the top whenever you have time. Don't let negative posts take over people minds. Let everyone do to their own DD rather than decision made of negative comments. This has become mind game rather than real value and power of the company I believe in.
Shorts are working really hard to spread FUDS to steal your shares...Make no mistake about selling..This is a $6 to $8 stock before FDA...
16.97 million share buy at 2:54 on Friday for SENS? Am I seeing that correctly on the chart
"This is the part of the 8/27 article investors should focus on, not the rest of the blah, blah, blah:“As you may know, the company may have massive potential down the road with its Eversense diabetes monitoring product.In the coming years, the growth of this product could push the company’s sales from the $14 million projected for this year, to as much as $200 million by 2025.”"
"Remember, buy the dip if you're confident long."
"Black Rock owns more than 26 million shares, institutions holding is up"
The reason the stop went down without any reason is because there is huge open interest for $4 call expiring pn 09/03/21. Do not sell the stocks. this is all manipulation by Market Maker
sometimes i just do not get the market.lets say sens is the absolute best product.dxcm market cap is 50 bilsens 1 bildxcm could offer 8 to 10 $ a share and just take over the company
"If you have done your due diligence and a long term investor..Whenever they are manipulating this gem,you should just be smiling and laughing.."
Breathe In.....Breath Out folks. We'll be just fine.....
Got me a few more today. Also check out October calls got some of those as well. Hopefully my timing is good
"ok my thoughts about the potential, after the 365 there Will Be a device also for non diabetic, so i think prof athletics, but also pre surgering measering , o my God that would be huge. and al the patents are defending IT wow."
We see $100 on fda approval screen shot this post
I sold some other stocks on friday and have $5000 which will be used to add more sens on any dip.
I get some solace and enjoyment knowing the paperhands are cashing out for pennies (often high taxed pennies) when we're on the literal 'eve' of a big climb.
Not selling a single share.
I was just reading articles on SENS and both articles said that in December it would be a couple months for the fda approval here it is 8 months and also looked on fda calendar don't even see SENS listed am I missing something
I'm so tired of hearing about MEME stocks. SENS lifechanging innovation is why I purchased this stock and I think all the longs have the same mindset. Let's get 180 approval and then 360 approval and watch organic growth.
Huge potential for SENS to have a market share of $200 million in a matter of 2-3 years !!HOLD STRONG AND BUY MORE IF YOU CAN !!
"FDA, there calling it tomorrow ! glta"
95% of diabetic patients prefer Senseonics glucose monitors over DexCom....
Buy this stock and forget… come back in a 2 years and surprise yourself. This stock is gonna make many people millionaires. But the key is buy and hold
It looks a little extended but I think I will be adding more pre tommo morning! Good luck this week everyone
another day of half volume...shorts and panic sellers had their day.
Does the Ascensia agreement expire tomorrow without FDA approval of the 180 day unit?
I can guarantee that the FDA will announce tomorrow. It'll happen right after I sell my shares for a tiny and high taxed profit.Thank me later.
"Quick reminder to all long term investors, if you have done your DD and are investing for the long term expecting double digits pps, is it that important if you got in at 2, 3 or 4. Buy in fraction and put it away. Let the big boys play thier games with daily price manipulations and DONT fall a victim of thier games. Not one stock has seen massive returns without such a volatility. Know what you own and best of luck to all longs. Our best days are ahead, that's for sure!"
"WHY? : Institutions shares increases : JPMorgan,Barclay,BlackRock,Vanguard,Rockefeller Capital,BankNewYork Mellon, CITI Group, Geode Capital...

Strong Buy and Hold tight, and we are NOW just starting! In earnest, the pullback time is starting this week,and BooM BooM BooM time is all ready to go ~!, and please be prepared for big Catalysts of FDA 180-days approval in advance///Glta."
Up 4% again on no news and 10 million shares less than average volume traded and shorts are trying to cover. Diamond hands are very strong as they came here as believers in SENS to buy and hold. Shorts can not get our shares. The pickle is tightening. Word is spreading in spite of SENS near nonresistant marketing. SENS is near invisible. We all know that is going to change.
I will be adding more to my 12k shares. I will be holding for at least 3years. I have 3 family members waiting for the 180 days approval they are currently on Dexcom and can’t wait to get off it.
just bought 140 more shares patiently waiting for approval
"We need to test $3,7 again before visiting $4,6 and we will test $4 before $5,5 and so...This is so healthy.. there is no stock go just one way."
"Great Job my brothers, we Longs are not playing around and holding strong...we have confidence in the future of this company...wake us up when you shorts have stopped playing around..."
"Investor Place, what a joke. Literally the 2 & 3 sentence are wrong. Sense did pull back, over 50% in fact from its winter highs and it never went below 2 in July. It was basically above 3 the entire month. If the authors can’t do basic research then you have no need to pay attention to what they have to say."
"Diabetes has increased 10 fold in adolescents and young adults the past 20 years as these people get fatter and fatter and get less and less exercise. This is a huge negative for America's future but also destructive and expensive for the health care system. Diabetes glucose monitoring companies should prosper big time from this disturbing fact. SENS will benefit greatly, especially if they can succeed in marketing their 180 day product. So far marketing has been graded as an F, so lots of room for improvement."
The people who wait before buying are going to pay more money to buy SENS.. Buy and be patient no worries .
There is this publication by the name of InvestorPlace. During the last month they have published 2 articles trashing the company and its stock. This is a great sign we are going higher because short sellers seem to be panicking to pay for a publication to convince people this is a poor investment!!
"Notice how EVERY article bashing SENS turns off their commenting..... You know what the real problem is? The people at the top do NOT want us ""lower class people"" potentially making oodles of money. All of this downward movement is a constant calculated strategy to scare away investors, but hopefully these repeated FAILED attempts to tank this stock are noticed by the people running the show at Senseonics, and it's only fueling their drive to succeed more! Forget and ignore any negative sentiments regarding SENS because they are just ""opinions"" (with an agenda) that are INTENTIONALLY leaving out the part where Senseonics' promise study was a HUGE success. Now why would ANYONE believe this company isn't going anywhere after that?! This is a guaranteed win, and the people at the top know this. Maybe we should start playing their game and really upsets them - tell your family and friends to buy in on this gold mine, and lets show Wallstreet what the people are REALLY made of. Here's the kicker, this ISN'T a meme stock! Good luck everyone!"
Set your limit-sell orders! My previously made one was rejected just now (read my past posts here for my theory if interested). Just set it for some random high number (I go anywhere between $400-499/share lol) and hopefully others will do the same! Good luck everyone!
