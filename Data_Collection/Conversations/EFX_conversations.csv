Wouldn't trust this company to walk my dog. Value should be ZERO.
Be a patriot Sell this stock.
When is their ER out? This is getting ridiculous.
https://finance.yahoo.com/video/equifax-lays-hack-related-costs-203200957.html
They cooked the book on ER. unbelievable. ENRON ENRON ENRON Alert!!
Somebody got a spanking and it was not the shorts for once.
RALLY REJECTED
"Nikole, I just shorted more $EFX at 104.35. I'm just leading by example. It's never too late to short an Enron or a Lehmann Brothers. It's never too late to short a stock that's worth $0.00."
"A top House Republican is moving to boost federal oversight of credit-reporting companies, which would include a phase out of the use of Social Security Numbers. Oversight is another way to say they are taking control away from credit-reporting companies, which could crush Equifax's business model. As reality sets in, institutional investors will be forced to take their losses and sell their positions in Equifax."
The holdup on Earnings I'm sure is 4th Quarter Guidance which no one has no way of knowing and Wall Street hates uncertainty . The longer the wait the lower the stock will go!
"If you own Equifax shares, you are helping people steal my credit information. perhaps the biggest shareholders like t.rowe price and vanguard should also reimburse us for mental anquish of having our information practically given away."
Looks top heavy here. Anyone have any valid arguments why analysts won't drag it down just before ER?
"this is so predictable. Sheeple. Guess what happens to the stock on the day of congressional hearings? What possible good news is coming for this thing - it will take years to dig out of this hole. Maybe not a BK, but put leaps are the way to play this. It's going to grind down for the next 6 months at least as story after story comes out about their incompetence followed by the realization that their liability is high."
This is a joke. These guys should be bankrupt for what they did to consumers.
"""Equifax, reeling from hack, still has no earnings report date"" ""Equifax Inc is running out of time to schedule its first quarterly results report since the massive breach that exposed sensitive data on 145.5 million people and erased more than $4 billion of the credit reporting firm's market value.The company has yet to announce a date for its third-quarter earnings and management's first conference call with Wall Street analysts since it disclosed the breach last month. That is a departure from its normal practice of scheduling earnings by mid-October.Equifax has until Nov. 9 to release its results or seek an extension from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which gives large companies 40 days after the close of a quarter to report their financials to investors.""Company representatives declined to say when the results will be issued."
"when is earnings?? seems sketchy they keep postponing, is this common?"
Adding shorts today. Rally is over.
GS just put a investors report to stay away from efx. more bad news are on the horizon.
Straight. To. Zero. PLEASE.
13B market cap. 3B in rev. Even if there is no liability the growth story is over. Best possible case scenario is that this trades at 2X revenue which puts this at $65. But we all know there is more disclosures coming.
Randy. Looks like the PHOENIX has a broken wing today !
"Who will congress critters yell at if Richard Smith and all the other executives ""retire early"" before the hearings? Who is in charge of this garbage company?"
You'd have to be insane to long this stock now
Over 50% of credit reports have errors.
"Unlike the data breaches of specific businesses, this is far more severe. Most businesses only have information based upon their interactions with you. Equifax is a data warehouse containing all the data of all the businesses, banks, etc. that you interact with. The hackers will now know all the banks and businesses you do business with, and can do more targeted phishing attempts and other tactics to compromise your identity. This breach could potentially be 2-3 times worse than any other breach to date due to the sensitive nature of the data."
It will be going lower than you can even think about.
papers being signed not looking good. lawsuits coming
"The 7 million dollar contract is small potatoes. The stock price is moving on speculative trading. Don't get caught up in the day to day nonsense. Equifax's problems have not gone away. Their gross negligence has triggered an avalanche of legal problems. In addition we will move away from the credit agency function and find a more secure way to apply for credit. Their business model will fall apart, as it should."
End of day should be interesting....might go red from people afraid to hold over the weekend.
"I wouldn't touch this share even with a stick. Sooner the later banking and insurance institutes which taking their time to see how congress will react and going through their own internal evaluation process, will cease to work with Equifax and start to relay on the two other agencies. I wouldn't be surprised that opening bank account or moving to different mobile operator will require physical presence in the branch and wouldn't be possible over the phone or the internet."
"The lawsuits and coverup potential here is limitless. Further, they have competitors, most of which are taking full advantage of this. I saw an Experian commercial that listed Equifax by name. This stock will get lawsuit after lawsuit. Then an investigation by congress, and then criminal charges against insider selling. All the while they will get downgrade after downgrade as customers flee and costs to give everyone lifelock will pile up. This stock is likely to see 70. Don't just sell it, short it."
New company replacing Equifax WE THE PEOPLE.
"Strong signs of the top of the up-move. The only people buying this are idiots, or speculators with very tight stops. Fact. The same people who bought from me when I was selling at 125 and 115 and 105. People buying are too dumb to evaluate fundamentals, but can look at a chart and say ""hmmm, looks like it's going up and to the right, I guess I'll buy.""It's a good rally. I should have anticipated it. The heat comes off, and speculators like cockroaches creep in at first, then turn into an avalanche. Sometimes, they push the stock so far that even the dumber fundamental investors start to think they're missing something and make the mistake of following. And then there are people like me, who should have anticipated this herd of cockroaches and taken more off the table to save some ""dry powder"" for later, but didn't. So I had to cover higher, adding to a short squeeze.But that's all getting exhausted. Unless some other fool analyst pumps this, it won't cross 110. In fact, I said it before the Wells analyst, that it wouldn't even get much past 100 without some fool analyst and I was right.You will see sub 100 again. Quite likely in days, certainly within months. And you will see new lows. 80, 70, 60. You don't understand it now. Maybe you'll understand it after I've made 40 points more to the downside."
"""EFX says it may have been hacked again""...? #$%$?"
"this isn't anything like Enron, but at a 21 PE, it has a long way to drop yet. There simply will be no reason whatsoever for it to go up with literally millions of potential lawsuits, and lots of reasons to go down. Terrific short."
Did you hear that will not hold $90.00 Come aboard Randy and Emperor we will teach you how to short.
"Some of these fools think it is going back to $120. Like everyone will just forget and pretend like nothing ever happened. I call that ""happy-talk"" and it is BS."
"The FBI needs to arrest these guys tonight! The share sales, by Chief Financial Officer John Gamble, Joseph Loughran, president of U.S. information solutions, and Rodolfo Ploder, president of workforce solutions, took place on August 1, SEC filings show."
Equifax nears 'historic' data breach settlement that could cost up to $3.5Bhttps://finance.yahoo.com/m/b6123fcd-2e8e-3476-b494-d84b1ec23de8/equifax-nears.html
Any earnings yet? Lol!
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lawsuits-against-equifax-pile-185244496.html
"They estimated earnings at 1.5 and reported .79 that's a -.69 per share miss or nearly 50% Earnings miss . Nobody even expected them to lose that kind of money. Emperor is talking about a beat, lol!"
"Tick tock, tick tock - 1 week left and counting until they can seek an extension"
EFX longs after hours today
"Following the massive breach at Equifax revealed in September this year led to the loss of information on at least 145.5 million people, another massive leak linked directly to Equifax and friends. These are very valuable data fields, constituting the essential details of a core of 120 million American households. Information on more than 120 million American households was sitting in a massive database found left exposed on the web earlier. It included an extraordinary range of personal details on residents, including addresses, ethnicity, interests and hobbies, income, right down to what kind of mortgage the house was under and how many children lived at the property. In total, there were 248 different data fields for each household, according to the researcher who uncovered the leak data this week.It was simple to determine who the data was linked to, either by looking at the details or by crosschecking with previous leaks. The data was sitting in an Amazon Web Services storage ""bucket,"" left open to anyone with an account, which are free to obtain.As long as they knew the right URL to visit, an Amazon Web Services user could retrieve all the data, which was left online by marketing analytics company Alteryx. It was apparent that the firm had purchased the information from Experian, as part of a dataset called ConsumerView, on top of which Alteryx provides marketing and analytics services.Vickery thinks the data was part of a product - the Alteryx Designer With Data - that sells for around $38,995 per license. In its own marketing for the Experian service, Alteryx notes that the database contains ""consumer demographics, life event, direct response, property, and mortgage information for more than 235 million consumers."""
The dialogue is now shifting to eliminating Social Security numbers and questioning the viability of companies like Equifax. You know congressional leaders would love to see Smith and his crooked executives lose a ton of money.
"Funny stuff....Horrible fundamentals going forward but stock can be juiced up because its all held by institutions so the market maker just floats the price on low volume and sells put options sold to you. collect premium, wash and repeat until the downside pressure is too great to hold it up anymore. The earnings might be fake but the broken fundamentals will eventually catch up to this dumpster fire. These institutions will be looking for bagholders to unload this @!(!"
"While you guys bag hold EFX, watch this great video on why buying it was a mistake.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72Pq5zKEi_g&feature=youtu.be&t=23m22s"
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/equifax-reeling-hack-still-no-181726769.html Never good for stocks that delay earnings releases I am surprised this has not dropped to $100 or less by now!!
"EFX is still circling the toilet, but we have not yet heard the flushing sound. Far too much glib, ""happy talk"" floating around. For example, CEO essentially denying all liabilities. Plenty of happy talk to lift the stock price but we will see how much longer it lasts. This article lays it out nicely. The next shoe is yet to drop. p.s. Randy. Shorts do not control the price of this stock with short interest less than 3%. If there is a sell off of any kind, it will be the long holders doing the bulk of the selling. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4111012-equifaxs-lehman-moment-looms"
The insiders already sold. But still believers left eh? It's gonna hurt.
Move over big boys coming in to short this POS. See you at $100.00
Equifax: Do not catch a falling knife..
"These complaints are largely due to the missed investment oppertunities, I will see you gentlemen at 150"
"Data breach scandal aside, dividend yield is still less than 2% at $91/share. This stock was over-valued before the breach, and it's still over-valued now."
"KNEEL Emperor and Randy, 3% whole 2 weeks of gains wiped out in one day."
"There is $ to be made by suing Equifax the lawyers will be suing, not only on basis of the breech but class action for anyone who paid for coverage in the last 3 months EFX will have to pay for anyone that paid a fee, no brainer."
THIS IS GOING INTERNATIONALEquifax Hack Disclosed Driver’s License Data for More Than 10 Million Americans Company also said file containing 15.2 million U.K. consumer records also affectedEU is going to destroy them
short it
Equifax is done. There is no way they can recover such a big disaster.
Was not able to listen to the CC. Any guidance on the accrual for legal fees and consumer costs going forward? My read on the earnings report was that the $87MM charge was for already incurred expenses. Hard to believe this amount won't be double for Q4 along with potential regulatory & compliance costs.A $150MM Q4 charge would put GAAP earnings to zero. Did they just gloss over this?
"Shorted 14,000 shares."
Still no earnings???

"Whenever the economy is on steroids, EFX earnings are usually a blowout. I hope to see this stock at above $150 post-earnings."
"I’ve gotta admit: this stock is a tough nut to crack. Big quick ride down and it has been holding amidst increasingly bad news. Still bearish, but I covered much of my short position."
EARNINGS MEGA MISS
"Wow, up 2%....won't mean it drops by 35% after their ER (someday!) in one day. Just look at EVHC today if you don't believe me."

"Anyone notice how it sells off at the close?? That is the big boys (smart$) getting out. They paint the tape on low volume days to sucker the retail investors in just like a pyramid scheme and then ""look out below !!"
"This comes down to culpability, liability based on what levels of hack protection the company had in place. Hacks do happen and no company is 100% hack proof so it really comes down to did the company have what would be considered ""reasonable , , exceptable"" levels of protection based on industry standards. Equifax will have some level of damages that they will be on the hook for which will probably not be fully known for years as it will take that long for cases to emerge that can be directly linked to the hack.There will be hearings, company will be second guessed about what they did to protect information but it isn't as easy as everyone here is thinking to show they ""willfully"" or were criminally negligent.Class action lawsuits have and will continue to pile up and will all be rolled into one massive lawsuit eventually but it isn't a 100% slam dunk case against the company like everyone seems to think here on the board. To many questions need to be answered before reaching that conclusion...What we do know is1)company had a hack event and didn't notify the 143 million affected for over a month...why? I have read that many times companies wont make public as they are trying to trace the hacks to source and by going public it makes it harder to catch the bad guys. Still one month is not exceptable2)company response was VERY POOR....making people go to their website and put in last 6 ss digits was plain crazy and the wording which said in small print if you check to see if you are part of the group that got info compromised then you cannot join class action suits....that is just SLEAZY!! The company has now back tracked and said that language doesn't pertain to this event.3)companies executives stock sales look VERY bad...could be a huge coincidence but looks bad!"

The CEO and all insiders who sold any shares after 7/29. All the needs to be Clawed BACK! These Freaking Stinking #$%$s. The Libility to people for life is easy 50K plus and free credit monitoring for LIFE! The CEO needs to Resign and reverse his sale of shares. Stinking #$%$! Class Action for $500 Billion in order here for the harm they caused."
Why dropped so much after hour ?
Who the f— is buying this POS?? I can’t believe it’s clawed its way back to green.
Who's buying this ??? Going to $90- after missed earnings and guidance.
Martha Stewart went to prison for making only $50K These guys need life!

Their company list of customers will shrink by a huge number; these companies and banks to not want to have a relationship with these clowns!! EFX's revenue will be cut by 65% before this is over"
@Tom: I'm eager to receive those Cuban Cigars. This one is going to $90 by Monday. The shorts have won. Grab the puts.
Cut your loses and walk away
I think this is up because no one is able to put an exact number on the damage. This will take a serious bite out of upcoming earnings. Well duh.
"What a #$%$ show this next earnings report will be, where management will either(1) quantify liabilitiesor(2) say they are still trying to determine liabilities. In either case, the stock will drop. Once the growth narrative is gone, PE multiple must contract."
The accounting department is having a hard time rigging earnings to show a profit. It might just have to give up and report the first of many losses.
Equifax took down there “Discounted Credit Report” part of their web site due to hack.
this will slide back to 90s by next month
"What Mr. Smith said today can be used against Equifax on every court case. Equifax put your info out here by not doing their job. End of case. Question is how much will be paid per case. Every state will get a cut. Every person effected will surely be made whole, I know black market pays a thousand $ for IDS. So court will probably look at $100.00 per incident no more $5.00"
"Why not make the banks require photo identification via an in-person meeting before they eagerly hand out credit cards? Wouldn't that solve a portion of this SSN problem?

"Smoking Gun - so the guy that approved the stock sales for the 4 execs was head of security at that time!! So how can all 4 be exonerated by this independent committee?? You can't even make this stuff up!! In addition to his legal duties, Mr. Kelley was also in charge of security at Equifax and the company's former chief security officer reported to him. That executive, Susan Mauldin, retired after the breach disclosure. Mr. Kelley is no longer overseeing security, according to people familiar with the matter. The change occurred after the breach disclosure, they added.The report didn't address the level of knowledge John J. Kelley, Equifax's chief legal officer, had about the suspicious activity when his office approved the share sales."

Shorts you crushed me today. Panicked went out at 104.00
shorts just need to short more....no way this won't tank just before or after earnings...even the new contract is doubtful.
When are they reporting 2017 Q4 earnings? Should be this week right?
Lord have mercy 230 dollars for this tulip mania valuation?
Another scummy company with scummy leadership. The new normal in America. Their only job was to collect and safeguard personal information and they failed at it. Like a pencil that doesn't write.

I talking biggest scandal since Enron. Chief security officer has a music major? What was the CEO major in? Dance? It only gets worse what happened..."
Shorts are not covering
How can I jump on the bandwagon of class action lawsuit?
Short this POS. This company is overvalued even without that scandal! It's $20.00 stock at best
Lost my butt on $90 put I didn't take expired today. Down $2700. I am a real rookie
"Just 100 people tracing a credit breech back to Equifax, will take this down."
The negative news on EFX is not over ;I would be surprised if 60 Minutes does not have a segment on this in the near future which will cause it to fall just like Lumber Liquidators (LL). Then the fines and lawsuits and loss of business will surface and retest recent lows.
The trouble will not end any time soon. People who bought into pump And dump will learn hard lessons. 10 dollar stock.
Red in the morning is the EFX longs warning. Sell now cuz today will be bloody
"If Equifax is allowed to profit off this scam and no prison time for theft by deception, USA might as well throw in the towel F laws this is theft by deception and no one should go to work due to no taxes need to be paid cause government is not doing the job we pay them for. I am #$%$."
It is our duty as investors to crush this company.
This company is garbage
"In the SEC filing, Equifax noted that it faces more than 240 class-action lawsuits related to the breach, and is cooperating with investigations by all 50 states’ attorneys general and an alphabet soup of governmental agencies (SEC, FINRA, CFPB, FTC and FCA among them). In addition, the company has received subpoenas from the SEC and a U.S. Attorney’s Office in Georgia regarding stock sales by executives after the breach was discovered but before it was disclosed.Charges equal to the low end of that estimate were accounted for in Equifax’s standard earnings number, which lives up to the U.S.’s Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, resulting in the $87.5 million total. However, the company stripped the charges from a non-GAAP earnings figure that it provided, which allows Equifax to claim that profits are growing even as it takes a hit from the data breach.To help with the costs of all that, Equifax said in the filing that it has insurance specifically for cybersecurity-related instances, with a $7.5 million deductible. However, it admitted that it doesn’t know how much, or even if, that insurance policy will pay."
Trust is lost in this company.
"Hey Randy. What happened? Gains from last two or three days gone just like that. At earnings, EFX will have two choices. (1) Talk about liabilities and lawsuits; or(2) Punt. I think they are going to punt. Basically just say their lawyers are evaluating and it will be some time until they have a clearer picture. This will help to hold up the price a little bit, but in the end, this thing is going lower, much lower."
Caught red handed insider trading.
Time to take this company down to ZERO.
Equifax was hacked again today! A company that can't control their own website security doesn’t have the ability to safeguard our personal information.
Please just explain to me why this company is actually worth $112.00. Really believe worth only $85.00 right now.
Hackafax is going slowly down.
Tell me why ANYONE would hold this stock in a long position overnight. At 3:30 the usual stampede will start. Watch.
"Bad News is coming-----from EFXEquifax has until Nov. 9 to release its results or seek an extension from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which gives large companies 40 days after the close of a quarter to report their financials to investors.Company representatives declined to say when the results will be issued."

you'd be stupid to hold this now...probably downgrades coming before earnings...

If they do NOT pay for frozen reports, then what happens if 14 million people freeze their credit? What if 28 million, or 70 million freeze it? What happens to Equifax's earnings? They probably go up a lot, right?"
to bad it's going back down next week... watch
Social Security Administration to not renew $5 million a year contract with Equifax in December and ban them permanently. Another lost client for life.
"Now instead of the Trustedid.com site timimg out, it now says trustedid.com refused to connect."
"Does anybody know how to have personal credit information totally removed / deleted from Equifax? I was just told today by an Equifax representative in the Philippines, that a correspondence mailed out from Equifax was a ""computer system error"". This company is reckless with our information."
"A unique company with an irreplaceable data base, but priced for perfection. How high the moon?"
Freefall! Glad I got out with my skin.
Free credit locks for life. They used to make good money on that. NOT ANYMORE. Watch Experian and TransUnion follow suit now. What else are we going to get free? I think LifeLock for life should do it.
"Here is what I get when I try to activate the TrustedID service. I have tried multiple times today. So here is how it works. You first check to see if you may have been affected. If so, the give you an enroll date. You enroll on the enroll date and they say that they will send you an email in a few days. Two weeks go by and still no email. So you re-enroll. Then the next day, they finally send you an email saying to go to this site to complete your activation. Then finally, you get this message saying service not available. Wonderful. These guys are really on top of it. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B_-qlV1K_3TDTGpya3BaajgwRVk"
"I just found out it's actually 3 different, separate hearings that Richard Smith will face on the 4th. That's 3 different hours-long opportunities for him to screw up and send the stock tanking during market hours. LOL I'm actually glad I didn't sell the puts. I thought it was just a single small hearing! This stock is going to $50"
Equifax: the falling knife. The worst has yet to come when more cockroaches in a castle.
"What makes this data breach more serious then others is the fact that Social Security numbers were compromised.Wait until banks and other large companies contracts with EFX come up for renewal, they will drop them like a bag of dirt.Do not go by income data that is published months ago. Their company list of customers will shrink by a huge number; these companies and banks to not want to have a relationship with these clowns!!"
This ain’t no pullback. This is Act II in The Demise is Equifax. I am short again.
I can see this one at $90 again on Monday. Just saying.
"Moving forward how can we trust a company that has lied again about the four executives who sold shares. Without our consent they have our private information at their disposal. All of our private information should be erased from their systems. Let the other credit bureaus continue on knowing that if they screw up like Equifax, they will be met with the same fate."
Allow me to thank again to Equifax for handling our information so carelessly and making our life miserable. Moving between mobile operators required me to drive to the branch so they will have to identify me in person although my excellent credit. I wish to the new year to go chapter 11 or at loss substantial oration of your market value.
I'M GONNA SUE!!!!!!!!
Mr. Smith is looking a bit uncomfortable...
I think the most destructive comment hurting the price of this stock occurred when the CEO answered a question before a congressional committee. He was asked if all your data encrypted?His answer: I DO NOT KNOW.A real vote of confidence for everyone!
Any earnings yet on this piece of $hit?
Going to tank after earnings because of weak guidance and overhaul of credit system
"My credit report on Equifax is mixed with some one else with similar names, my credit score is affected with someone else late payments, is that usual, what a irresponsible company?"
Why can't anyone tell me if our data is encrypted??
"Bought 110 PUT, sold 105, for next week expiration. Also shorted a bunch. This pig is ready to roast."
"Guys and Gals, Down 10 today!"
I hope this company goes bankrupt after today's security breach.
seriously how is this company around
I found the idiot who's buying up all the EFX shares. This guy is so dull he set up a bunch of limit orders that keep buying the stock as it crashes. Eventually it will be 100% of his soon-to-be-defunct portfolio. Lmao I always wondered who the crazy people are who sell puts on a stock like that but there are evidently even more insane people out there....https://seekingalpha.com/article/4107477-great-equifax-hack-2017-opportunity-lifetime
"It is gross negligence: Encryption at Rest is a standard practice for consumer data. The failure to encrypt social security numbers, mothers maiden name etc while the data is at rest in the database is unforgivable. This is not hard. Or at least its not hard if your systems are younger than 30 years old."
"Guys, time to take profit now... back to 95 next week."
So when do you think EFX files for Bankruptcy? 2018 or 2020?
Lowers earningsUH OH! Lol
Ok is that it? Shorts finally own this POS again? Time for randy and Emperor to bend over?
wouldnt be surprised to see EFX debt get downgraded tomorrow....
"Can not wait for EFX s earnings, this thing will drop another 10 percent that day."
EFX Caught selling your info to a third party while you go online to their site. They will burb for this. Allowing you to be transferred to another site while checking your credit so the other site can rip off your info EFX I am suing you are a bunch of #$%$.
Where the Hell are the 3rd Qtr earning and more importantly Guidance??
Everyone relax....low volume....CEO leaving is not unexpected and should have happened much more quickly...150k shares traded....give me a break
Equifax management is untouchable and too big to jail.https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/10/equifax-breach-preventable-house-oversight-report/?yptr=yahoo
"Equifax discovered the hack on July 29, but waited until Sept. 7, 2017 to warn consumers. Equifax executives sold shares days after the company learned of a massive hack. Equifax executives sold the Equifax shares in the time between the discovery and the announcement, none of which were part of planned divestments, just days after it learned of a hack that might've exposed the personal details of almost half of the US population. The share sales, by Chief Financial Officer John Gamble, Joseph Loughran, president of U.S. information solutions, and Rodolfo Ploder, president of workforce solutions, took place on August 1, SEC filings show."
"Stock is going to $80 or lower. Their viability is in question. The essence of their business model was just violated. Why would those clients sharing data with them continue to do so thus placing themselves in legal jeopardy. If JP Morgan shares data with them at this point knowing of data breach, they are liable for negligence. Equifax is cooked."
"A news report out that Equi-suck is the most complained about company in the United States.Yet their stock has almost recovered after a huge ""Data Breach""; time for a full investigation on a company that could care less if our personal information is hacked and stolen. We should hope every bank that uses these bubbling bozo's drops them like a rock. Sending them in to ""bankruptcy is to good for them!!"
Let the dump begin.
My credit report from Equifax shows me working for a company I never worked for
Personally had only problems with this corrupted compagny. They messed up all my personnal info and lost them twice. Ive been trying to sort this mess for now 5 months and no progress. Clearly they dont care and one of their employee even laughed at my situation. Equifax is a disgrace and should go bankrupt. Equifax is a JOKE. A JOKE CONTROLLING ALL YOUR PERSONNAL INFO.
"Have to be nuts to buy this stock here future unknown, government contract will be shredded."
This is the beginning of the end for EFX mark my words 11;51 10/4/2017 by this time 2018 EFX will be under $30.00
I just got $45000 wired to my brokerage account. What is the best PUT distribution for Monday. I wanna buy more PUTS
Anyone know when these morons report earnings?
"Short order in at $185. Refis will be hit by new fee, and real estate market is out of control. A house near me, abutting a freeway, 1400 sf, just sold for over a million bucks. I am putting my house on the market, and renting an apartment with the interest on my gain. Within 3 years, I will be able to buy it back at a 30% discount, at least. Bankruptcies will explode in a year, because people are spending money they don't have. Recessions are caused by too much debt. During the years leading up to the Great Depression, it was people buying the new technology-vacuum cleaners, radios, refrigerators, etc., ""on time."" Which was a loan from the seller. Well, people bought more than they could afford to pay back. The same is happening, today. People are spending $1200 for an i-phone, and taking equity out of their houses to finance their spending. This will not end well. It might take a few years to work out, but keep some cash on the side, because in a recession, cash is king."
All clients will leave this company
"Mick Mulvaney & CFPB will protect Equifax...Wells Fargo has its own protector.Report: CFPB's Equifax Probe Stalls as Mulvaney Defangs WatchdogUnder Mick Mulvaney, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has dramatically downsized its regulatory footprint.https://www.usnews.com/news/economy/articles/2018-02-05/report-cfpbs-equifax-probe-stalls-as-mulvaney-defangs-watchdog?int=news-rec"
"with all the negative news, efx will have new bomb shells every morning."
***NEWS*** Chief security officer just retired. She was last seen playing the flute while walking out of Equifax after receiving her retirement package.
"Smith already got his 18$M, which will be reported as a huge reduction in profits in Q3 earnings, and he already sold his stock. He doesn't care what happens to EFX or anybody who works there. Richard Smith will send this stock tanking and laugh about it later when he buys back his shares at $15 a share lol"
Equifax just plain sucks at cybersecurityEquifax employees need a refresher course from the Society of Internet Professionals.Equifax will give customers the use #$%$ - a free years worth of credit monitoring.It is time to hit them in the pocketbook - a 1 million dollar fine for each consumer impacted by their neglect and stupidity.
"Mgmt finally reacts: ""there will be no more earnings report ever again""."
EFX confirmed they were hacked again lol
Is anyone on this board able to reach the trustedid.com setuo by Equifax to enable security monitoring? I haven't been able to reach it after numerous attempts over many days. This is the site to get to your Equifax account.
"No skin in the game but I may short this on Monday, The tainted name as well as potential government fines, lawsuits,and loss of business will not bode well. A 60 minutes episode r other mainstream media report will send this down hard. It will not go bankrupt but I see it retracing it's recent low to $90 then once all is behind it it will be a buy again!"
Honestly surprised this stock isn't lower.
Investing 101- Never invest in a company with growing legal issues.
you f in morons. It's not the CEO-it the CIO who's at fault and the whole IT dept.Don't trust this company with anything!
"Down AH on a whopping 21,756...wow...."
Their debt is trading like junk bonds stock will follow!
"Apache Struts patch was released on MARCH 6. Hack was discovered JULY 29! That's nearly FIVE MONTHS. That's criminal negligence. They will be fully liable for 143 million people's identities being stolen, credit cards, phone numbers, bank accounts all at risk, even tax returns. There could very easily be over $1k in average losses per person, which would be $143 BILLION in liabilities for Equifax, not to mention punitive damages! This company is going TO ZERO. LITERALLY, ZERO!!!"
This pos should b at zero
"Equifax, Experian and TransUnion are untouchable with protection from FTC and Republican Congress. For one of the most damaging breaches to the U.S. population, Equifax faced zero fallout. Equifax alone has $3 billion in revenue in the year, according to quarterly earnings filings — or more than $500 million in profits. Former chief executive, Richard Smith, who retired with his full $90 million retirement package, adding insult to injury. Credit Rating Agencies continue to vacuum up our 147,000,000 sensitive data and personal lives (names, addresses, Social Security numbers and more — and millions more driver license and credit card numbers, etc.) were stolen in the breach. — knowingly and otherwise — and don’t do enough to protect it. As much as we can have laws to protect consumers from this happening again, these breaches will continue so long as the companies continue to collect our data and not take their data security responsibilities seriously.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, FTC Chairman Joseph Simons and Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, federal regulators have shown little interest in pursuit of legal action. All talk, much bluster, but otherwise little action. Shut them down.To date, only the Securities and Exchange Commission has brought charges — not for the breach itself, but against three former staffers for allegedly insider trading. When Equifax first announced the breach on September 7, 2017, the company also reported that three senior officials had sold EFX shares while the company, but not the public, was aware of the data breach. In the press release, the company stated that these three individuals had not been made aware of the data breach and that Chief Legal Officer John Kelley approved these trades that were made during Equifax’ selling window, beginning on July 28 after earnings had been released on July 26 and each of the three officers sold shares on August 1 or 2.After the tumult, Equifax then hired WilmerHale to do a review of the trading by the senior officials for the Special Committee. When a summary report was released in early November by the company, WilmerHale had found that a fourth employee, who was also not informed of the data breach, sold Equifax shares during this period (his sale was also on August 2, 2017).However, on March 14, 2018, the SEC and DOJ sued another Equifax employee during the time of the breach, Jun Ying, who until shortly before that date was the Chief Information Officer for the U.S. Information Solutions division, for insider trading. I believe that future oversight at Equifax should be strengthened and go beyond the existing board at Equifax, especially given this Board’s past issues and failures! Two years after the Equifax breach occurred, board members and C-level execs across the US can make the case that data breaches are a non-issue financially.Consider the settlement costs... Equifax will NOT pay $700m.- While Equifax has names, phone numbers, & both email & mailing addresses for everyone impacted, it is the VICTIM's responsibility to file a claim.- The claim website is run by a 3rd party on a non-Equifax domain & asks for the last 6 (not 4) digits of the victim's SSN. Breach-weary consumers are already telling me ""it's not worth the risk"" because they think that it may be an elaborate social engineering attack.- Filing a claim isn't enough to receive a portion of the settlement. Claims can be rejected if they don't meet certain criteria.148 million people were impacted by this breach. That means a $700m settlement translates to an average of $4.73 per record. For a company making close to $3.5 billion per year, absorbing that cost is manageable.On August 1, 2017, Equifax stock traded at $142.47. Today, it's at $141.40. Ultimately, the risk of a data breach impacting their stock price proved to be almost non-existent."
My january puts rise from the dead
"Down despite very good numbers for the Q3. I think that the reason is that the numbers made it very clear how much the good report was the result of an extraordinarily hot mortgage market and big searches by firms rehiring. These good results may continue through the end of the year but will make for tougher comparisons going forward. I love this company for its very wide and deep moat, but it has a very high PER given probability of much smaller earnings gains next year.l"
Regardless of their earnings tomorrow it will be all about guidance which will be cautious and may cause the stock to dip. Companies under this much scrutiny never sound overly optimistic as if nothing happened.. I learned this with Phillip Morris way back when they were being sued!!
F wall street! Time to hold the company accountable and forcing them out of business.
This stock should be zero and all execs behind bars
Let's hope it drops to ZERO & all the execs end up rotting in jail. Equifax Inc is a true example of American Greed and corruption at its finest.
I am calling my Senator to demand they shut down their business NOW.
My best guess at this point is this will trickle down toward $100 or below as suits and fines start hitting the news ..all the good news is out
Who invests in this stuff?
"Still think he did get caught lying about the sale of stock, think he is going to be in trouble for lying for insider trading. H e perjured himself"
This means Bad News is coming ------ sell now before it is too lateThe company has yet to announce a date for its third-quarter earnings and management's first conference call with Wall Street analysts since it disclosed the breach last month. That is a departure from its normal practice of scheduling earnings by mid-October.
Sell randy
All I see here is a dead cat bounce that will enable the big boys to have a new profitable shorting level. Call buyers are being set up for a huge fall. This stock is headed below $100 by Friday.
Breaking news: Equifax placed on credit watch. Credit rating might be downgraded any day now. This is what the start of a downward spiral looks like.
Sad... Potentially ruin the lives of millions of Americans and all that happens is a temporary fall in stock prices and some lawsuits that probably wouldn't do much damage to the company in the long run. I'm still wondering why this company still exists.
Please see news in today's WSJ.More evidence of incompetence
"""Equifax last week delayed scheduling its quarterly earnings announcement in the wake of the incident that has sparked several investigations."""
I️ am guessing that someone is either going to jail or jumping out of a window.
"Take down this Oligarchy, it is anti democracy."
How low will it go tomorrow? I believe 109.00.
Below 100 and this goes into freefall mode
"Emperor more than one roach in the kitchen, more to come out on stock trading and the length between knowing and letting public know. JAIL FOR SMITH."
"With the Desjardins crisis, Equifax just got 3 millions new members for the next 5 years... The stock price should explose soon"
They lost the IRS contract.
Pretty Pretty Sneaky - only an earnings press release later today and then conference call tomorrow on a holiday. Probably hoping people take day off and no one calls in to listen.
I can't believe there are people out there who are still buying this pos. Ceo took advantage of insider information and billions in claims coming.
I've predicted this...https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senators-call-irs-7m-deal-015700817.html
"still holding my puts, it's all bad news again."
i was long at 95 but short now for pull back to 105
"When a company is facing $18-$20 Billion in lawsuits, lost business and fines and is woth about $4B you know it's over"
