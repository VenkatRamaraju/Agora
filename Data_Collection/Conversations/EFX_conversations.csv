"In the SEC filing, Equifax noted that it faces more than 240 class-action lawsuits related to the breach, and is cooperating with investigations by all 50 states’ attorneys general and an alphabet soup of governmental agencies (SEC, FINRA, CFPB, FTC and FCA among them). In addition, the company has received subpoenas from the SEC and a U.S. Attorney’s Office in Georgia regarding stock sales by executives after the breach was discovered but before it was disclosed.Charges equal to the low end of that estimate were accounted for in Equifax’s standard earnings number, which lives up to the U.S.’s Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, resulting in the $87.5 million total. However, the company stripped the charges from a non-GAAP earnings figure that it provided, which allows Equifax to claim that profits are growing even as it takes a hit from the data breach.To help with the costs of all that, Equifax said in the filing that it has insurance specifically for cybersecurity-related instances, with a $7.5 million deductible. However, it admitted that it doesn’t know how much, or even if, that insurance policy will pay."
"Short order in at $185. Refis will be hit by new fee, and real estate market is out of control. A house near me, abutting a freeway, 1400 sf, just sold for over a million bucks. I am putting my house on the market, and renting an apartment with the interest on my gain. Within 3 years, I will be able to buy it back at a 30% discount, at least. Bankruptcies will explode in a year, because people are spending money they don't have. Recessions are caused by too much debt. During the years leading up to the Great Depression, it was people buying the new technology-vacuum cleaners, radios, refrigerators, etc., ""on time."" Which was a loan from the seller. Well, people bought more than they could afford to pay back. The same is happening, today. People are spending $1200 for an i-phone, and taking equity out of their houses to finance their spending. This will not end well. It might take a few years to work out, but keep some cash on the side, because in a recession, cash is king."
"I've been frauded and after months of going back & forth between Equifax and the bank that the frauster opened on my behalf, these fellows still cannot clear my credit score. Equifax is a total nightmare. Shorting this one to 0$"

I think the most destructive comment hurting the price of this stock occurred when the CEO answered a question before a congressional committee. He was asked if all your data encrypted?His answer: I DO NOT KNOW.A real vote of confidence for everyone!
When are they reporting 2017 Q4 earnings? Should be this week right?
This means Bad News is coming ------ sell now before it is too lateThe company has yet to announce a date for its third-quarter earnings and management's first conference call with Wall Street analysts since it disclosed the breach last month. That is a departure from its normal practice of scheduling earnings by mid-October.
Why is this down if earnings were good ?

How can I jump on the bandwagon of class action lawsuit?
"Following the massive breach at Equifax revealed in September this year led to the loss of information on at least 145.5 million people, another massive leak linked directly to Equifax and friends. These are very valuable data fields, constituting the essential details of a core of 120 million American households. Information on more than 120 million American households was sitting in a massive database found left exposed on the web earlier. It included an extraordinary range of personal details on residents, including addresses, ethnicity, interests and hobbies, income, right down to what kind of mortgage the house was under and how many children lived at the property. In total, there were 248 different data fields for each household, according to the researcher who uncovered the leak data this week.It was simple to determine who the data was linked to, either by looking at the details or by crosschecking with previous leaks. The data was sitting in an Amazon Web Services storage ""bucket,"" left open to anyone with an account, which are free to obtain.As long as they knew the right URL to visit, an Amazon Web Services user could retrieve all the data, which was left online by marketing analytics company Alteryx. It was apparent that the firm had purchased the information from Experian, as part of a dataset called ConsumerView, on top of which Alteryx provides marketing and analytics services.Vickery thinks the data was part of a product - the Alteryx Designer With Data - that sells for around $38,995 per license. In its own marketing for the Experian service, Alteryx notes that the database contains ""consumer demographics, life event, direct response, property, and mortgage information for more than 235 million consumers."""
"No more volume....1/8th ....that can't be good, they're going to try tool some European investors...brace yourselves."
