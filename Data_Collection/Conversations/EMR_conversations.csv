"Love this gal. Purchased a few years ago at around 49, should have purchased more last March. Great reliable dividend. A money making machine."
Why down so sharply today? Rare move.
Emerson Electric reached an all time high at 85.29
"Stock is drifting,while market keeps ratcheting up. We had good mo two weeks ago. What happened?"
It sure seems that the market likes the fact that EMR did not buy Rock at way too high a price.
Nice gallop today. I think there is more to go on this stud
"There aren't many comments on this board, but EMR is a great stock to own that has durable competitive advantage and long, steady growth in earnings and revenues whose dividend has been raised for 60 straight years!I own it through it DSPP (DRIP through which you can buy your initial shares) administered by computershare.com. You can set up automatic, no-fee investments of as little as $25/month and it's a great way to build a position by Dollar Cost Averaging. It took a hit into the $40's through 2015 due to its exposure to oil: it makes the controls that run ocean rigs among many other things, but it's bouncing back now and it's earnings are not mostly dependent on oil."
Going to take some time for new CEO to make up for past CEO mistakes Hope he can bring it back to Chick Knights days
What's up with EMR that past few days?
Long since 1992. Nice to see this baby finally gain some value. Been stagnant for awhile and now growing nicely. Keep up the good work guys! Chuck Knight would be proud of you.
Has Emerson ever grown its top line revenue or does it just buy companies to artificially grow?
We hit all time high little while ago. I was thinking that the dividend increases have been too conservative the last few years but now I realize that the direction of the company is to build up its portfolio and I agree with that.
"Beat estimates, raised divi, want to u lock $20B in shareholder value....what Am I missing? Seems we got room to run!"
EMR VS ROK.Maybe ROK should buy EMR and run the company so well that it would be evident to somebody else that it is undervalued.
Time to buy EMR
Book Value (Shareholder net worth) has been flat for 10 years. Seems like something to take up with management. Operating cashflow has been flat or declined in the last 10 years.
Why emerson down today so much?
Looks like stayed to long in china
"Fairly high beta. With inflation rising, isn't this a good time to sell?"
Great week
Nice week for EMR.
Dividend increase?
Awaiting earnings. They better be stellar or down she goes
I think itâ€™s a good buy for long term investment. Nice divy and room for the price to grow.
"Why is the price down after a big positive revenue and earnings surprise? Negative cash flow.In any case, I own EMR through it's DSPP (DRIP through which you can buy your initial shares), administered for EMR by Computershare, where there are NO fees for purchases (as small as $25 allowed) or reinvested dividends, so I automatically invest a small amount every month, taken from my checking account on the 8th or next business day of each month. It adds up over time and is a form of dollar-cost-averaging, where you are buying fewer shares than avg. when the price fluctuates higher than normal and are buying more shares than avg. when the price fluctuates low, meaning the avg. price you pay is less than the avg. price of the stock for that period!"
"#EMR, Martin Marietta, Kinder Morgan, Nucor....all up strong today. Conundrum as they should only be up on positivr Stimulus news. I'll be first to admit, I have no direction where market is heading here."
"When EMR dips below $58, back the truck up."
Does EMR has any involvement in the coming electrification part of green power?Wind mill management comes to mind with preventive maintenance to reduce down time and or catastrophic failure.
Moving up nicely.. PT raised to $71..
steady-decent divedend
Here we go again
love it when chinese companies like EMR are down
"I worked for Emerson as an EE for many years. The company gave out annual stock bonuses each year, and I bought 1 share per month for nearly 40 years and still doing it. I'm not yet retired but close and Emerson dividends (along with select other equities) will power my retirement lifestyle."
EMR are going to supplies the AC units needed to transport and store all those vaccine shipments
Looks like a stock split is due? based on historical?
"The is the ONLY stock in my entire portfolio today that is down?????? any reasons out there why??? I know that hit a 52 week high, but with the market numbers way up today, I figured to see it up a least a dollar or so................"
SO WHATS PLAN B AND C?
The next dividend should be increased by more then half a penny this time. Increases have been steady but too conservative.
Emerson should be a big winner with tax reduction.
Is Emerson involved with hydrogen fuel cell technology ?
