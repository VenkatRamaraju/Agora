"what should i do, hold or sell?"
"In case anyone doesn’t understand exactly what’s happening.Per the prospectus: they issued shares at the closing price Friday January 8: $160.74. After the issuance, if you owned shares at that price, your shares are now worth $143.38."
it was $80.28 this morning. Thanks for hanging in there. There are some of us that own at over $100
It can easily reach 105 dollars again
150 really soon
Up with no news? Glad I added more at the dip
Hope it can reach to 200 by end of Jan! Any thought?
65 next week...to much flood payout which will hurt earnings.
$60 stock is for real.. not today.. maybe tml if not monday
"big volume, i guess today they decided to sell"
Just popped 5%...up over 3% in pre?
RELI LMND HIPO all will run together. The recent drop is just the beginning of their next run of covering
This happened three month ago. Will be up in a month
Time to buy! Let's Go!
What makes this run so high just trying to understand.Any one can share Revenue not even 50 mill plusNo profitNot a product just a regular insurance.providerCan some one enlighten
"Hippo to Report Second Quarter Financial Results on August 16, 2021"
Citron knows they’re going to get squeezed into lemonade right? 
Well this was a bad buy $20 ago....
ten dollar stock in a year
"I am a licensed insurance agent. The money is in selling life insurance. Property insurance is just a loss leader to get those life insurance leads. If $LMND falls back to the IPO price ($29), I am loading up. If you already own $LMND, I recommend holding. I know it’s painful. But it’s really hard buying at the bottom. Much easier to buy and hold and accumulate more as it drops."
I just wonder what happens to this stock when they announce the start of auto insurance??? Going down big??? Lets see!!
"LMND. Industry, Insurance. Founded, April 2015; 6 years ago (2015-04) ... fast forward .... August 2021 ... this disruptive company generates revenues of about 100 million per year, after 6 years of being in business in 4 countries. USA insurance TAM, 2019 $5.2 trillion! USA homeowners market segment TAM $104 billion. Considering the slow growth and relatively low revenues, LMND needs to reconsider the effectiveness of its business model. Considering the TAM and to justify its lofty market cap, the revenues of this company should be doubling every year for the next 3 to 5 years. Such impressive growth rate would justify premium market cap and investor excitement. No doubt in my mind that there are insurance brokers working for some of the large insurance companies write annually as much insurance as LMND does with staff of 500 employees!"
Short covering rally???
https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/5-stocks-that-could-double-your-money-2021-01-18
Will finish green again on down market day!! Long live lemonade!!
Doesn’t matter how good or bad ER is doesn’t justify price
$9 billion company with approximately $100m in revenue? Talking about a bubble.
"If LMND can hold on a day like today, what do you think will happen on a day when they announce a new European country, or a new type of insurance? $200 is in the cards for 2021."

Sub60 coming
"Bought a tiny tiny bit .......was making a 2 day 6% return......and then KABOOM ! haha, okay, I have some more money to add....let's see in a couple of days....."
"Guidance for rest of the year $173 million loses, why would anyone buy this stock right now? I’m sure even next year it will be worse, $25 IPO price was more than enough"
I should have sold this before earnings and took my loss elsewhere js
"I'm not a share holder, but I'm a customer. I saw the article from left and I can assure you that he wants to cover his back.Lemonade is the MOST pleasurable company to deal with. You click, click and you have a policy. Their technology is 100X times better."
"we are in a 10% correction which is long overdue. All the MEME and MOMO are going to drop 20-40% at least.watch especially Cathy woods picks. many shorts against her, she will be in big trouble. The game is over for now.. get your cash ready."
"If your losses are twice as much as your revenue, you’re not a company, you’re a Ponzi scheme."
"This turd posted revenues $28.2M, $1.7M lower than last year same period. They lost $56M close to 2x revenue. With a $4.8B valuation this is priced for hyper growth it's not delivering on that. Mgmt keeps dumping shares. https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1691421.htm"
What’s the short term bottom on LMND? It always bounces back. My only fear is there are no buyers until after the fed makes its decisions regarding tapering....
"Lemonade will never make money , nor will ROOT , sellBoth !!!"
SoftBank bought Lemonade
Buy buy buy!! All day long!! Don’t kiss the big upward movement by end of this week. Forever stock!!
this may be the greatest investment since Amazon and tesla
"Really starting think that I should be betting heavier on this. This is better than $LMND, yet it trades for 10x less. Absurd. This will be corrected overtime. This will be a millionaire maker."
Anyone else down a lot on this one??
"What do you guys think, short at $88?"
I mean where in the worldIs this going to?
"Where are all the ""experts"" that post everyday about LMND? Stock drops 13% and the ""experts"" are dumping their shares but no longer share their bullish projections? Stick with the SPY and the QQQ and don't try to beat the market. Invest in stocks like LMND and you will never have to do any tax planning."
Does not look good...
Might be going back up over $100. $200 by 2022. Very possible. Hurricanes not as powerful as expected. This year is ok.
Looking like 50 for entry
I made some gains in the first round entering at 112 and selling at 180. I am holding now at an average cost of $104 . Somehow have faith in its business model
"ok i get the enthusiasm, but what's going on here?? no news and this stock has almost doubled in the past month???"
"So... I just had a daughter, and I decided to buy some term life insurance. After shopping around, the rates for me were around $85-$100/month. Then I said to myself, I’ll check out lemonade. Turns out it was $55/month, without having a full in-depth screening. That’s a $1m policy for 20 years. Crazy cheap. I’m not an investor of lemonade, but I’m seriously considering it just based on my customer experience. Just felt like sharing. Cheers to a bright future."
"All these comments, does nobody look at fundamentals?"
The most I can value this turd at is $8/share. But with the thin float this can go anywhere. I think the best play is based on it not staying here. I bought November $75 call and $55 put. It’s going to $30 or $90…maybe both.
If current trend continues and break $70 we are going to $50s
I am not going anywhere.. will ride to $180 again.
Snatched a few shares here …
What’s happening? Did they beat?
Above expectations. What's impressive is growth rate. Just shy of a million customers already. Lookin' good.
Can buy at 50
"For one year LMND stock is up 30%, not a bad return."
I think shorts are in control?
"""Gross Profit""??? I have never seen an insurance company talk about Gross Profit. And that is because it is ridiculous and meaningless (and actually deceitful) for an insurance company. LMND is looking at revenues and taking out losses to get a ""gross profit""!!! Uhhh, that is usually what is called a ""Loss Ratio"" and theirs is almost 100% for the year. What they are doing is excluding the biggest piece of the pie - their enormous expenses for Sales & Marketing, Technology and Administration. These came to $113.2M for the first 6 months, which is a staggering number against $51.7 in revenue. I know they are young but those numbers are staggering.Their ""combined ratio"" (THE basic standard in the insurance industry) is roughly 300% - for every $1 they take in, it costs them $3..... wow, UGLY.... (I won't even get into the fact that they take the deceitful ""Gross Profit"" and then create a series of admittedly non-GAAP terms that work off the Gross Profit number....)Bottom line: for an insurance company to be successful, they have to be either great at underwriting (Loss Ratio) or great at efficiencies (Expense Ratio). LMND is currently terrible at both."
Will keep buying the dips from here. This is long term play for me . End of the story!
"This is going back to 40. As soon as some value and growth opps can be identified, investors will drop this"
Behold this for this behemoth: 5 trillion dollar industry worldwide No one in the market has more than a 4% market share Traditional and old companies lead the industry; the average age of their competitors is 125 years 12 of the fortune 500 companies are insurance companies
Stock will rebound in a month or two. Take a look at last two earnings report. Down for month and rebound to high 90’ s
I believe in chicken genius foresight.
Buy HIPO it is better then LMND !!!
$19 more dollars to go!
IPO price coming
Easy 1000$ per stare in ten years. Millionaire maker stock. Tomorrow I'll buy
"Over Lemonade, Inc, the car insurance marks as ""soon"".After this service becomes available, the SP will be going to the moon!!!"
earnings will be good but again we will see the stock price drop!
No thanks
"Down another 6%. If this wasn't such a small part of my investments I would be scared. As it is I am just irritated. I've put it in my Luckin Coffee portfolio, something I'll get a tax break on next year."
"They didn’t do terrible they missed expectations by .10, so if your long term then this may be a good time to buy more"
$25 PT
LMND showing true colors.
Really wanted this company to succeed. Love their brand identity and marketing and the way they conduct business. Really is too bad that most Americans aren’t aware of their business..
"investing some as they expand to car insurance, the money maker of the insurers!"
When life gives you lemons ... - Thank you #cathiewood !
Cup/handle formation...!!
"Took a quick look at the earnings. Rev beat but down YOY, earnings not great. Tough Q for shareholders"
RELI will soon have direct ties with LMND once the app releases. The app is likely releasing any day this month.
Tsla offering car insurance in texas now
Green at close tomorrow
"Longs here, here's my thoughts on this company. If this company over the next x amount of years, can become a typical player in the insurance industry, it's a decent investment. If the way they structure it they become a pioneer and start to dismantle the industry, then they can become a fast growth winner. What are the odds they disrupt this industry? How many insurance buyers care about the policy change in donation to charity, aside from the app and faster application and premium payment time?"
Going buying price?
Looks like someone removed my warning yesterday. Again large claims coming. Buy back in after the drop.
$200 by 2022. Mark this price target. This target might be too conservative.
LMND not approved on car insurance yet. Waiting on regulation approval. I thought they were. Might buy after sell September is over.
"Will be back to $40 soon, that's about the right Market Cap it belongs!"
"Lemonade (NYSE: LMND) reported Q1 EPS of ($0.81), in-line with the analyst estimate of ($0.81). Revenue for the quarter came in at $23.5 million versus the consensus estimate of $22 million."
"@Yahoo Member. You're wrong, Legacy companies haven't embraced AI yet. In fact, 10 years ago, the same was said about Geico and Progressive. They weren't even top 20 carriers. Today they're #2 and #3. Legacy co's don't adapt well"
Insurance companies not good during Hurricane season coming up.
Making money is the plan and with Bitcoin Investment your plans can be fulfilled.
I will load more as soon as it hits 48/45 again
"In my personal oppinion this is very simple. It is growing quick, customers are delighted, marketing spend per new customer is continuously reduced, while spend per customer is increasing, loss ratio is reduced, new services are added -> The company is awesomeThe valuation currently is sky high for the size of the company. They are making losses but the path to profitability is clear and relatively simple.So buy as much as you can for as cheap as you can and enjoy the long term gains!"
"I was waiting for a pull back to get a position, but now I’m a bit sketched out... why would they do a offering after Q4 is over but before they announce the results. Their company open trading window is closed. Something feels off. I’m all in on the business model and lemonade as a 10 bagger long term, but it feels like they are trying to capitalize on the price before Q4 results."
Today price 64$. Will keep buying all its lows from here
Only buy at 30
"For all of us that didn’t listen to Dennis, congrats!! "
It is time to question this management
VIX is above 23 today and taper news is not good for this stock…
i am holding 3500 shares from $50s. Should i be scared?
Not sure why they are in Europe already. They are only in few states in US. Now new auto insurance business? They only have 556 employees. Maybe they should concentrate their core business first. Then they may come up with better business model??? Just a thought
Still overvalued
Looks like I bought to early this morning. Doubling down if it goes back to 58 and below again.
"I was impressed with what the CEO had to say on CNBC yesterday. I will trust his views over those of the yahoo LMND shorts any day of the week. I remain convinced that LMND has major staying power...online insurance will supplant traditional insurance overtime the way EVs will supplant gas cars. It's not a question of it will happen but when. If I were All State, State Farm, and Geico I would be worried right now."
"i see i received many thumbs down. Good, getting under bagholders skin since they all bought in the 120-160 range. you can take your capital loss this year, or carry forward next 30."
Earnings are not out yet. Don’t read into this downward spike just yet.
"$23M in rev and burning cash everyday - meanwhile, the company is valued at $5B?!!!This is why the stock will fall much more from here - even if it drops by 50%, the market cap is still at $2.5B.In other words, the company is generating $1 in sales and you are paying $200 for $1 in sales - simply outrageous.Big clap goes to all LMND executives who dumped their shares when it was trading at $150 in Dec while luring main street / middle class investors to be burned."
$VENA $LMND $GME market dipped so did everything else. Heres your chance to buy on the dip folks.
Wondering if now is still a good time to buy?
Should merge with Mile and Roots to take on the big insurance industry. All 3 together will be force in the insurance sector. Legacy insurance companies will be scared if these 3 insurance combine. I have no shares on all 3 as I sold everything last month.
Is there any news that is making the stock move up????
Don’t be panic! Will back to above $100 soon!
RELI is a safe bet to start moving. 750k ftd's generated may 17th. No signs of covering. 40% borrow rate. LMND and HIPO both signed on with them to coincide with their new app launch/release literally any day now.
I'll double up at 60
Look at LMND rally!!! GO LMND GO!!!
I remember Cramer saying to buy this at 140
For everyone here from last Q they didn’t report until 5pm eastern.
yeah... Loving my predictions. $100 by the end of May was missed by a few bucks. $120+ in June!!!
I expect a beat on revenue and larger than expected loss on earnings. A drop to $80 or below and but back up in a couple months
Now this is the LMND we know and love
No need to be panic! Will pop up within 1-2 weeks
regret not buying this when it was on my watchlist at 80
"Do people understand it will take one little bitty announcement to send this to $200? If your are shorting, you’re in trouble."
"A lot of people do not understand how insurance and reinsurance work. 75% of their premium are ceded, that means they could pull that lever and increase topline revenue whenever they want. It’s wise for them not to take on so much risk right now. People need to be looking at #of in-force and gross premium"
Can someone explain why the stock is up? I'm following it. Is it because Metromile is going public? But they sell completely different insurance products and seems the auto insurance is a bigger market than the online home owners and renters insurance.

If you are a powerful stock advisory service then the your recommendations should show stock increases no more than one week after your recommendation and the increase should be sustained for no less than a month anything other than this should be considered scamming which my 9 year old boy is able to do and get the same results if not better
Maybe a bottom?
Seems 48-50 is the bottom. Next resistance is around 60 bucks. Happy to hold this for 2-4 years.
"Looks like they beat all their top line and bottom line estimates. They spent a little bit more than planned, but seems positive for the company"
Will LMND get into the car insurance business?
ZERO GROWTH
James remember what I said. Pumpers and bagholders beware. First stop is $50.
I bought at $90 couple of weeks ago and never look at it. Check again today price went up to $180.
When $55?
I had to add :) !!!
"Lemonade is doing what it said it would be with charity. Lemonade takes 25% of its premium income to cover operating expenses and uses the other 75% to mainly purchase reinsurance policies— which limit losses — and to pay claims. If anything is left over, it goes to charity. In 2020, Lemonade’s “Giveback” was more than $1.1 million,"
The director sold shares again..
"For the current insurance services, this stock will increase easily by another 100%.After the auto and others insurances are available in the US, the SP probably has great potential to go 10X. This company goes both digital and AI technologies so it has great potential for growth with low cost.The Global market is over $5000B so the growth is incredible if it goes to foreign countries. By USNEWSPros:Ability to sign up for coverage within minutesCompany donates a portion of revenue to charityFast claims processCons:Only available in 27 states and Washington, D.C.May not be a good fit for those who prefer working with an agentCoverage amounts vary by state"
90 by next week
"LEMONADE (NYSE:LMND) INSIDER BUYING AND SELLING ACTIVITYInsider Buying (Last 12 Months): $0.00Insider Selling (Last 12 Months): $97,580,523.26"
It seems like there is a stock lockup expiry next week. Any idea how many shares will be unlocked for sale?
CITRON recommending LMND short? isn't it the same firm that shorted Tesla? Hmm..
$81 million of quarterly expenses on $28 million of revenue. Now losing $55 million per quarter. Disrupting nothing.
"$LMND $50 is the bottom.. October great month! Load up .., short, mid, and long terms are all good from here"
"I really feel that MF is off the mark big time with this pick. It might be innovative in how it gets quotes quickly, and using AI, but there are so many insurance companies in the game, and they can easily mimic whatever LMND is doing that is trending now. This is one of those times as of late, that Robin Hood investors need to dig deeper on this one and not get caught up in the hype."
Company donations are at all time high. Which means sales and cost cutting are also going to be all time high and continuing.
Tesla offering their own insurance based on driving records only. They didn't even need a feel good marketing program and soft colored app design to coddle their tarket audience. Not sure if they allow a parent's credit card to pay 90% or not though. Charlotte's Web 2.0 except someone who actually provides insurance could buy it.
Showing support at 60 so at least it won't drop that much.
"not surprised, posted this months ago that this was so overvalued it was just insane. Now you can compare to a real insurance company - AIG just posted earnings yesterday and they were great. Real revenues, real earnings. And doesnt trade 60X sales. Never going to compete with a legacy multinational ins. company. Just another Millenial idea (e.g. Beyond meat) and change the world disruptor attitude which will FAIL."
LMND holding very well. RELI releasing the 5 minute insure app any day. Both should run steady together. Definitely a revenue boost come next earnings
I’m so glad I jumped ship at a profit. This thing is headed to limbo for years!
Stop dropping
"Once RELI catches wind, LMND and HIPO should see some more volume"
Any huge claims from Storm Ida?
"Wow, this is amazing, any good news?"
Wall street is valuing stocks like the banks values houses in 2007. the dilapidated house down the street sold for 1 million so the house next to it is also 1 million...but a year later both were valued at 375k...whoops
Do not buy. We have major Puts and shorts in play. We will just take your money. This buy in isto close out the calls we have in place. Check Fintel.io
"According to Bloomberg, it seems that there is going to be 44mil shares unlocked tomorrow.“Insurance provider Lemonade Inc. is trading more than 350% above its July 1 initial public offering price, the best of any 2020 debut above $300 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But roughly 44 million additional shares -- mostly held by insiders -- will be eligible for sale on Tuesday, according to the IPO prospectus.”"
17.8m total revenue - 30.5 million net loss (Q3 2020)73.9m total revenue (9 months) and 87.8 million net lossTotal value company 5.64 billion - What am I missing?
Ummm this company has declining revenue and growing losses? Goodbye. Prob only bigger investors holding it up. This one is a sinker
Can anyone explain why the CEO is selling stock? Or is it a very small amount of his total ownership?
RELI had another good earnings
Going to 100 all day!!
"BUY >>>BUY>>>BUY ... earnings should be a phenomenal beat. At least $1,000, 000 above analysts estimates!"
that was my worst investment
Have 65 shares at 126 avg shud i sell
"Stocks down big today are $lmnd, $etsy, $uber, $fsly, $gm, $roku, $lyft, $sklz. I own none of these. Feel better lcid is not down that much. Lcid will bleed slowly."
Guess I’ll be holding for 10 years
"History lesson Stan. 20 years ago, Geico and Progressive weren't in the top 20 US carriers. Now they're #2 and #3, so yes it happens. And how did they do it? Technology"
I lost nothing today because I didn’t sell!
Motley pick. See how they spin this one.
Bullish Engulfing. Next week will be likely be a good one
Would love to buy back in at some point. Just want to see a good point. Want this bad boy to calm down a bit. It seems to be so volatile.
so glad i sold at 160

You can call me crazy but I just bought 500 shares of LMND where 30% short position. Very danger of me buying today but will average down if drops more. Just sold my Chinese stocks so I have money to buy other high growth stocks like LMND. Keeping IQ and QS for long term. My price target for LMND is $200 in $2022 but I got a feeling Shorts are going to attack this company down more perhaps to the $50 level. Hope Robinhooders come to the rescue. Shorts did the same attack on Quantumscape from $133 down to $19 levels. You see powerful these shorts are? These huge short hedge funds coordinated to kill any stocks. Either huge short squeeze coming or we head down to $50. Hope weak hands won't sell. I'm holding to 2022. Will buy more averaging down. This company is very disruptive in the insurance industry.
LOL
people are entering at this level?
"WOW .. IT""S TIME TO BUY SOME MORE LMND .. ;)"
stock should be on the pink slips
Short position very high for sure probably due to bad earnings season with several hurricanes coming our way.
Buy BROS the next Starbucks. Buy Quantumscape the next Tesla.
29% is shorted
Market is down so the lemonade.. nothing much to worry.
When life gives you lemons…
Wow. What a comeback. Congrats to those who didn’t sell :)
I am a long and I only come to this board to get entertained by Dennis and his always wrong frustrations 
Easy short in my opinion due to lack of fundamentals...
"This is a great company, will see $200 within 1-2 years."
Will try to buy around mid 65 or so. I’m not sure it’ll drop that much though. Don’t want to miss out
IMO this will continue to lose value until the low $40’s. ROOT is a better buy as of now. It got beat down hard but at under $10 a share it’s looking good for online insurance bet.
Eyes on RELI to move by next week. 5 minute insure about to launch. LMND will get a boost from sympathy as well
Earnings are going to be solid for sure!! Long live lemonade. Long term greatness!!!
ok then. This is low enough for me to start a position. Added for medium/long term
CNBC is having the CEO of Lemonade speak in a couple of minutes...no idea what he is going to say but you might want to tune in!
Wow.. my $75 put expiring Friday starting to look good!
Release the kraken!!!
buy now and thank me after earnings.
Free fall if hurricanes this year going to impact some smaller insurance companies.
Looks like we are getting rid off the weak hands… $lmnd $root $ever
High of $188. Lots of talk of it going back to all time highs ! I’m in
These guys need car insurance in a bad way. Can’t compete if you don’t have the ability to bundle coverages.
Why does this stock tank hard most days???
Bearish volume getting exhausted and RSI is oversold. We’re currently in a wedge and if we breakout we’re headed back to test 110$ then if a breakout takes place we’re going to 180$.
Seems like MF is the only one pumping this #$%$ Looks like it's heading back to May lows.
Might pop next week to around 70
"Tesla or Amazon wasn't profitable for a long time. If this venture succeeds, easily $100b market cap."
Just bought! Calling the bottom here! Run it back to 99!
"Some said IDA was not that bad of a hurricane,"
It's a Tesla of an insurance market.
Remember when the CEO sold at the top
I finally got the confidence in the company to be able buying the stock. hope that will succeed in the long term. good luck for all.70.07$ 300 shares
Another hurricane is heading to Gulf states due to climate change as if these hurricanes are getting bigger with more force. This is reason I'm on the sideline.
Double bottom or down to 60?
"I heard about Lemonade last year, really like this company. I was thinking about buying after IPO but it went up too quickly. I was hoping it was going back to 30-40 after that but finally opened a position at 60 last week. I'm gonna hold this for at least 5 years no matter what naysayers say."
"I don't know why it is hard to accept it, that Lemonade is growing and expanding its wings on the globe. They are providing multiple types of insurance and term life insurance is going to be launched very soon. That clearly indicates that their revenue is also going to be increased multiple times. Low price + increasing number of clients. That has huge potential to grow, yet they are using tech which requires less number of employees. The price given to this is because of it's vision and recent results which clearly indicates the model is working great."
Bad investment? Asking for a friend.
"I've got PING, FSLY and LMND with earning today... Wish me luck!At least LMND is delivering so far today..."
When Lemonade intros auto insurance stock will rocket.
Lemonade will skyrocket when they intro auto insurance and start lighting up other countries.
"I hated hurricanes. This is why I hesitated to buy LMND but just in case IDA won't make too much harm, I bought small amount of 500 shares. Just in case IDA is not major concern, stock should explode back up next year. Perhaps $200 is very possible."
I'm in long at 62 since last Friday.I feel like there's potential in the long term.
I am lowering target from 80 to 20 with STRONG SELL CALL !
"It won't always trend down.. This is temporary. The market will trend up soon about 4-6 weeks. Patience, the year isn't over yet."
"Wow, this was at 180 in Jan? Ugh."
"zero revenue growth for the year projected and widening losses, the stock should be priced as 30 max because zero growth, price to sales at 35 times should come down to 15 times or less."
I am so happy I can load up tomorrow . and if goes down further it makes me more happy
"I had 100 at 50$, guess I shouldn't have sold at 110"
What people are missing is that 33% shares are exiting lockout period this week . Flood of shares are coming up. Hopefully it doesn’t affect price too much
Maybe I’ll buy at 40 but chances are if it ever gets there it’s heading to its true value of $20
Major flooding in NY and NJ should result in a deluge of claims. No reaction yet.
I'm not a short but want to understand why LMDN insurance Yoy comparisons are negative? Was there an accounting change?
$30 is possible downside
"So much love from Motly Fools for this stock… don’t get it. Every earnings report, this stock tanks and there is a build up. Last earnings report there was a reason (deep freeze) not this time. One more bad earnings report, lemonade will go to ipo price. Too much hype from Motly and others…"
"As per LMND 1 day ago they are starting with work in following countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom"
Would I be okay to buy into this today and make money?
"this is Uber of Insurance. wait till they get regulatory approval for car insurance. everyone want cheap insurance. if you ever own a pet , $10 a month insurance is a blessing and a half. everyone will sign up."
This stock really short 30%?
Heading to 60$.
Why trading at 40X 2021 revenue with 20% growth?
Where my fellow bag holders at
$60 stock

"Heard storm and hurricanes coming much stronger this year by November. Not a good time to buy insurance companies. Buy Quantumscape, baba, bidu, IQ, Open instead since they are still down a lot but going back up big time."

"I finally got 500 shares , even if goes down I ll load again."
