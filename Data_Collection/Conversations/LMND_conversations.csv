We need the car insurance come on hurry up !!!!
"Over Lemonade, Inc, the car insurance marks as ""soon"".After this service becomes available, the SP will be going to the moon!!!"
Got homeowners pricing from LM. 2x’s what I am paying.
Losses are increasing
"Anyone guessing the Price target in Jan, 2022 ?? Let’s see who’s got right !!!!!"
Today price 64$. Will keep buying all its lows from here
This is going to Single digit. Reason u know very well. Losses with revenue doesn't make any sense.
Will keep buying the dips from here. This is long term play for me . End of the story!
This stock is not turning lemons into lemonade. It's turning lemons into rotten fruit.
Just bought! Calling the bottom here! Run it back to 99!
"I think LMND will surprise us like LC today did! I thin it will be after when they go car incurrence, might take little-bit time. We are early investors thats why i am not in to big but good to be in this one!"
Easy 1000$ per stare in ten years. Millionaire maker stock. Tomorrow I'll buy
Trying to decide if I would buy this at 39… guess it depends on fundamental circumstances at that point in valuation. We shall see
"this is Uber of Insurance. wait till they get regulatory approval for car insurance. everyone want cheap insurance. if you ever own a pet , $10 a month insurance is a blessing and a half. everyone will sign up."
Might be going back up over $100. $200 by 2022. Very possible. Hurricanes not as powerful as expected. This year is ok.
People realising it’s still overvalued

"I have a feeling many ppl misread the Q2, even some of the CNBC hosts. Q2 topline was not like-for-like and hid the 90% sales growth unless you go into the details.Q3 results will probably be similar to Q2, but with a like-for -like reporting dur to migration to the reinsurance model in Q3/20. Hence, LMND should show +100% topline growth and that should drive the stock up."
Wall street is valuing stocks like the banks values houses in 2007. the dilapidated house down the street sold for 1 million so the house next to it is also 1 million...but a year later both were valued at 375k...whoops
Let's go! In a green market how has this been lagging. Green days ahead
"For the current insurance services, this stock will increase easily by another 100%.After the auto and others insurances are available in the US, the SP probably has great potential to go 10X. This company goes both digital and AI technologies so it has great potential for growth with low cost.The Global market is over $5000B so the growth is incredible if it goes to foreign countries.

Why the downward movement today?
Looks like no bottom for this stock until I sell it ! Then it will go up 30 -40%
"Really starting think that I should be betting heavier on this. This is better than $LMND, yet it trades for 10x less. Absurd. This will be corrected overtime. This will be a millionaire maker."
Bad investment? Asking for a friend.
$200 by 2022. Mark this price target. This target might be too conservative.
Well I will be sellling beloved $dis and pick up more tesla. Selling my $lmnd and buying $Tslaselling NIO and buying teslaSelling the biggest scam $qs and buying tesla.ONLY ONE STOCK for me to hold is Tesla and maybe $pltr( long term @least 5 years.)
here comes car insurance. I work in property management and practically every single renters insurance policy is lemonade. about 90%. Once they launch car insurance its too the moon. Loading up while its still low.
29% is shorted
guys was told 23and me might buy this company how can I findout if it is real or fake 
Showing support at 60 so at least it won't drop that much.
This stock really short 30%?
I finally got the confidence in the company to be able buying the stock. hope that will succeed in the long term. good luck for all.70.07$ 300 shares
The CFO sold shares at Oct. 18th for USD 65.

The director sold shares again..
"I finally got 500 shares , even if goes down I ll load again."
