LMND holding very well. RELI releasing the 5 minute insure app any day. Both should run steady together. Definitely a revenue boost come next earnings
$60 stock
High of $188. Lots of talk of it going back to all time highs ! I’m in

"I'm not a share holder, but I'm a customer. I saw the article from left and I can assure you that he wants to cover his back.Lemonade is the MOST pleasurable company to deal with. You click, click and you have a policy. Their technology is 100X times better."
"Buying dips helps to cost average. Fortunately , in at 86.. sold 1/2 at 112."
"So... I just had a daughter, and I decided to buy some term life insurance. After shopping around, the rates for me were around $85-$100/month. Then I said to myself, I’ll check out lemonade. Turns out it was $55/month, without having a full in-depth screening. That’s a $1m policy for 20 years. Crazy cheap. I’m not an investor of lemonade, but I’m seriously considering it just based on my customer experience. Just felt like sharing. Cheers to a bright future."
"LMND is oversold at these levels. Very oversold. There isn't much more downside to go. I've been buying all the way down. Shorts have a false sense of security. When common sense kicks back in the growth names will be bought like they are going out of style. Shorts will watch their gains disappear as quickly as fire underneath water. The long term story is still very much intact. LMND will head back towards 200. I expect the shorts on here to attack me, call me names, and make fun of me to their hearts content. I don't care. This selling is almost over with."
guys idk what to do now... hold buy sell?
I think shorts are in control?
IPO price coming
"LMND is as fundamentally bad as any company I have ever reviewed. They have no idea how to profitably underwrite business. They have obscene acquisition costs for accounts. They make up terms to show how well they are doing (ADP anyone?) They have no infrastructure to handle claims (those pesky issues that happen to be the raison d'etre for an insurance transaction).It is all smoke and mirrors, with Insiders making an absolute fortune and presumably laughing at Investors all the way to the bank. In an industry with razor-thin margins I can't see them EVER turning a profit - or even coming close! They only seem to care about growing the top line, a strategy which has failed literally every insurance company who has ever gone down that road."
I am a long and I only come to this board to get entertained by Dennis and his always wrong frustrations 
"I don't know why it is hard to accept it, that Lemonade is growing and expanding its wings on the globe. They are providing multiple types of insurance and term life insurance is going to be launched very soon. That clearly indicates that their revenue is also going to be increased multiple times. Low price + increasing number of clients. That has huge potential to grow, yet they are using tech which requires less number of employees. The price given to this is because of it's vision and recent results which clearly indicates the model is working great."
Now this is the LMND we know and love
I expect a beat on revenue and larger than expected loss on earnings. A drop to $80 or below and but back up in a couple months
Going to 100 all day!!
When $60ish? I wanna get in
How does an insurance company lose money? I think they have a good idea going (albeit easily replicated by other companies) but they’ll need to raise rates to survive. $5 for renters insurance is unsustainable.
"I had 100 at 50$, guess I shouldn't have sold at 110"
So when does lMND announce their official start to auto insurance business? Tomorrow?
"Stocks down big today are $lmnd, $etsy, $uber, $fsly, $gm, $roku, $lyft, $sklz. I own none of these. Feel better lcid is not down that much. Lcid will bleed slowly."
Look at LMND rally!!! GO LMND GO!!!
17.8m total revenue - 30.5 million net loss (Q3 2020)73.9m total revenue (9 months) and 87.8 million net lossTotal value company 5.64 billion - What am I missing?
SoftBank bought Lemonade
"Lemonade (NYSE: LMND) reported Q1 EPS of ($0.81), in-line with the analyst estimate of ($0.81). Revenue for the quarter came in at $23.5 million versus the consensus estimate of $22 million."
Is there any news that is making the stock move up????
$20 mil in Revenue....$4 Billion Market Cap. Enough said.
This stock is an IPO. Relax and cost average shares under $70. Then sit and watch your money double in 12 months.
"Just signed up for home insurance with LMND. Compared to my previous insurance company, LMND's rate is less than half of what I paid to my previous insurer, saving me more than 50% (exactly the same coverage and deductible and everything else). Signup took only 5 minutes on my cell phone; app was easy to use. LMND is also the home insurance provider/ partner for SoFi."
No thanks
71.35 -0.52 (-0.72%)After hours: 04:45PM EDTwhy is this dog with fleas cut in half? wasn't it trading 180's?
"Looks like they beat all their top line and bottom line estimates. They spent a little bit more than planned, but seems positive for the company"
stock should be on the pink slips
I should have sold this before earnings and took my loss elsewhere js
"Upon further review I have changed my sell order to $90 from $101. Why can't this company be acquired by someone who can use there technology? I actually am insured by them now and really like the way it works, the cost, and the customer service."
"BUY >>>BUY>>>BUY ... earnings should be a phenomenal beat. At least $1,000, 000 above analysts estimates!"
Will LMND get into the car insurance business?
"History lesson Stan. 20 years ago, Geico and Progressive weren't in the top 20 US carriers. Now they're #2 and #3, so yes it happens. And how did they do it? Technology"
Lemonade sure turned into a lemon
It seems like there is a stock lockup expiry next week. Any idea how many shares will be unlocked for sale?
Bought at $52 sold at $90.. now I wait and listen to Goldman’s advice:)
$60 stock is for real.. not today.. maybe tml if not monday
Doesn’t matter how good or bad ER is doesn’t justify price
Behold this for this behemoth: 5 trillion dollar industry worldwide No one in the market has more than a 4% market share Traditional and old companies lead the industry; the average age of their competitors is 125 years 12 of the fortune 500 companies are insurance companies
A friend has recommended LMND to me so I took a look at their income statements. Can someone explain why last Q revenue was massively down from the previous two Qs? I'm totally new to this sector. Thanks.
105 today
"A very disruptive company indeed, it disrupts your gains you have with other stocks in your portfolio."
RELI LMND HIPO all will run together. The recent drop is just the beginning of their next run of covering
Don’t be panic! Will back to above $100 soon!
Anyone else down a lot on this one??
Not sure why they are in Europe already. They are only in few states in US. Now new auto insurance business? They only have 556 employees. Maybe they should concentrate their core business first. Then they may come up with better business model??? Just a thought
"All I can say is that LMND is a fabulous company! Let me explain: My homeowners insurance expired in July, and I got a notice from my mortgage holder. I accessed my insurance account on Progressive. I could not renew it there, so I tried calling Progressive, with no results. The reason is that Progressive as well as most other insurance companies, do not write their own homeowner policies! I got on line and clicked on insurance companies, and filled out a question form to receive an 'immediate' quote. Well, after filling out the form, it brought me to a window with four different insurance companies, and they all said 'click here for quote'...WELL on each one that I clicked on, they all went in circles and gave me a phone number to call to 'complete' my quote! What a total waste of time! The biggest mistake that I made was giving my cell number and email address. For about one hour I received phone calls as well as emails from at least a dozen companies. I actually accepted the first phone call that I received, and spent 10 minutes going over all of the previous info that I had provided. Once I had finished, the women that I was talking to said that she had to turn me over to someone who could further give me a quote because she was not licensed to access the required information, but not to worry, because he would already have all of the information that I provided her and that he would just give me the exact quote...NOT! He proceeded to ask me for more information, and gave me a quote of $1326 which was much higher that the $890 that I was paying Progressive (who actually turned it over to ASI). So frustrated, I just hung up. Here is the best part; after learning that not many insurance companies handle their own homeowners insurance, I google 'Insurance companies that provide their own homeowners insurance policies'. I actually go a list of some (very few, actually) and I recognized one that just recently had their IPO. How can you forget the name LEMONADE? Well, long story short, when I went to the cite, they asked me minimal questions, and came back within 3 minutes (yes, THREE minutes) with an exact quote, and they gave me the choice of paying in full, making monthly payments, OR (I just LOVED this) the option of contacting my mortgage holder and having the payment added to my mortgage payment in an impound account so that I never have to worry about my policy lapsing like it did with Progressive. WoW!Not for the best part of the story! My quote??? $571 or $46 a month! I have had my home for over 40 years, and this is the lowest it has EVER been! If any you own your own home, I challenge you to try them out.. I was so super thrilled that I just purchased some shares. It won't make up for my selling FB just yesterday at close of market at $280.74, but it will help me to keep my mind off of it! I may just check out the options on this. GOOD LUCK, AND STAY SAFE!"
Have 65 shares at 126 avg shud i sell
"we are in a 10% correction which is long overdue. All the MEME and MOMO are going to drop 20-40% at least.watch especially Cathy woods picks. many shorts against her, she will be in big trouble. The game is over for now.. get your cash ready."
I just wonder what happens to this stock when they announce the start of auto insurance??? Going down big??? Lets see!!
"I am a licensed insurance agent. The money is in selling life insurance. Property insurance is just a loss leader to get those life insurance leads. If $LMND falls back to the IPO price ($29), I am loading up. If you already own $LMND, I recommend holding. I know it’s painful. But it’s really hard buying at the bottom. Much easier to buy and hold and accumulate more as it drops."
"This is going back to 40. As soon as some value and growth opps can be identified, investors will drop this"
I’m so glad I jumped ship at a profit. This thing is headed to limbo for years!
"Just got email from LMND, asking what format I preferred for the car insurance app. Looks like an announcement is coming soon. Hard to not imagine big pop before market open and continue to new highs when gets announced, jmo."
"Do people understand it will take one little bitty announcement to send this to $200? If your are shorting, you’re in trouble."
LMND = SNOW
"Hippo to Report Second Quarter Financial Results on August 16, 2021"
Selling $250 policies you will never make money
Why trading at 40X 2021 revenue with 20% growth?
They are done selling?...
Going back to 100$ by this week
"i see i received many thumbs down. Good, getting under bagholders skin since they all bought in the 120-160 range. you can take your capital loss this year, or carry forward next 30."
Sold too early at 130
What’s the short term bottom on LMND? It always bounces back. My only fear is there are no buyers until after the fed makes its decisions regarding tapering....
"This turd posted revenues $28.2M, $1.7M lower than last year same period. They lost $56M close to 2x revenue. With a $4.8B valuation this is priced for hyper growth it's not delivering on that. Mgmt keeps dumping shares. https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1691421.htm"
Can anyone explain why the CEO is selling stock? Or is it a very small amount of his total ownership?
Will come to 80 again
longs are so happy it seems when stock drops so they can buy more. They will be ecstatic at 40
Watching the shorts be wrong so often is the best entertainment out there
It is time to question this management
people are entering at this level?
"It’s all about earnings and inflation which is bound to go up near term. Lemonade has good business plan and so far, execution has been good, but it is bleeding money. Adding the auto business will drain more money and prolong losing money period. Be patient everyone. Investors of lemonade will be happy in 5 years. Long term investment."
I will load more as soon as it hits 48/45 again
Bearish volume getting exhausted and RSI is oversold. We’re currently in a wedge and if we breakout we’re headed back to test 110$ then if a breakout takes place we’re going to 180$.
This happens after every earnings report. It will go down for two weeks and slowly it will go up. Watch out for falling knife. I would wait till recent low of $55 before going in.
$10BILLION CO????EPS (TTM) -2.50 P/E (TTM) -59.09 Fwd P/E (NTM) -50.84 EBITDA (MRQ) -119.10M Revenue (MRQ) 98.60MNet Margin (MRQ) -123.02%
I remember Cramer saying to buy this at 140
This was on my watch but after reading the law suite I’m not going near this. Shorts be jumping on this big time. Say hello to $60’s soon!
Wow. What a comeback. Congrats to those who didn’t sell :)
"Will be back to $40 soon, that's about the right Market Cap it belongs!"
"A lot of people do not understand how insurance and reinsurance work. 75% of their premium are ceded, that means they could pull that lever and increase topline revenue whenever they want. It’s wise for them not to take on so much risk right now. People need to be looking at #of in-force and gross premium"
what was the EPS for this quarter?
Heading to 60$.
Time to buy! Let's Go!
"Once RELI catches wind, LMND and HIPO should see some more volume"
Citron knows they’re going to get squeezed into lemonade right? 
"I heard about Lemonade last year, really like this company. I was thinking about buying after IPO but it went up too quickly. I was hoping it was going back to 30-40 after that but finally opened a position at 60 last week. I'm gonna hold this for at least 5 years no matter what naysayers say."
Seems like MF is the only one pumping this #$%$ Looks like it's heading back to May lows.
"It won't always trend down.. This is temporary. The market will trend up soon about 4-6 weeks. Patience, the year isn't over yet."
What’s happening? Did they beat?
Holding strong from $50. Even though I only own 6 shares LOL
I bought at $90 couple of weeks ago and never look at it. Check again today price went up to $180.
"According to Bloomberg, it seems that there is going to be 44mil shares unlocked tomorrow.“Insurance provider Lemonade Inc. is trading more than 350% above its July 1 initial public offering price, the best of any 2020 debut above $300 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But roughly 44 million additional shares -- mostly held by insiders -- will be eligible for sale on Tuesday, according to the IPO prospectus.”"
CEO on CNBC. LMND entering in auto insurance!! CEO says tremendous demand!! Buy buy...
I own it but I can't buy it up here
Look at LMND rebound!!! GO LMND GO!!!
It can easily reach 105 dollars again
"For one year LMND stock is up 30%, not a bad return."
Solid month so far....
65 next week...to much flood payout which will hurt earnings.
Is this the breakout?
Looks like I bought to early this morning. Doubling down if it goes back to 58 and below again.
Looking for sub 70….
Whenever I am in doubt about my long position on lmnd. I come to this forum and seeing so many haters is very reassuring . Just do the opposite of majority’s sentiment on this board and you will win everytimen
Stock will rebound in a month or two. Take a look at last two earnings report. Down for month and rebound to high 90’ s
"Where are all the ""experts"" that post everyday about LMND? Stock drops 13% and the ""experts"" are dumping their shares but no longer share their bullish projections? Stick with the SPY and the QQQ and don't try to beat the market. Invest in stocks like LMND and you will never have to do any tax planning."
"I was impressed with what the CEO had to say on CNBC yesterday. I will trust his views over those of the yahoo LMND shorts any day of the week. I remain convinced that LMND has major staying power...online insurance will supplant traditional insurance overtime the way EVs will supplant gas cars. It's not a question of it will happen but when. If I were All State, State Farm, and Geico I would be worried right now."
When life gives you lemons ... - Thank you #cathiewood !
Buy HIPO it is better then LMND !!!
"LEMONADE (NYSE:LMND) INSIDER BUYING AND SELLING ACTIVITYInsider Buying (Last 12 Months): $0.00Insider Selling (Last 12 Months): $97,580,523.26"
ok then. This is low enough for me to start a position. Added for medium/long term
Lemonade will skyrocket when they intro auto insurance and start lighting up other countries.
"In case anyone doesn’t understand exactly what’s happening.Per the prospectus: they issued shares at the closing price Friday January 8: $160.74. After the issuance, if you owned shares at that price, your shares are now worth $143.38."
Where my fellow bag holders at
Anymore pending share lock-ups on this??
Making money is the plan and with Bitcoin Investment your plans can be fulfilled.
This happened three month ago. Will be up in a month
"What do you guys think, short at $88?"
earnings will be good but again we will see the stock price drop!
Market is down so the lemonade.. nothing much to worry.
Hope it can reach to 200 by end of Jan! Any thought?
"$23M in rev and burning cash everyday - meanwhile, the company is valued at $5B?!!!This is why the stock will fall much more from here - even if it drops by 50%, the market cap is still at $2.5B.In other words, the company is generating $1 in sales and you are paying $200 for $1 in sales - simply outrageous.Big clap goes to all LMND executives who dumped their shares when it was trading at $150 in Dec while luring main street / middle class investors to be burned."
Looks like someone removed my warning yesterday. Again large claims coming. Buy back in after the drop.
Will finish green again on down market day!! Long live lemonade!!
$19 more dollars to go!
Does not look good...
"ok i get the enthusiasm, but what's going on here?? no news and this stock has almost doubled in the past month???"
I'm in long at 62 since last Friday.I feel like there's potential in the long term.
150 really soon
Short covering rally???
I'm not a short but want to understand why LMDN insurance Yoy comparisons are negative? Was there an accounting change?
What makes this run so high just trying to understand.Any one can share Revenue not even 50 mill plusNo profitNot a product just a regular insurance.providerCan some one enlighten
"As per LMND 1 day ago they are starting with work in following countries: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Cyprus, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom"
Going back to $100 by end of the month 100%
Why does this stock tank hard most days???
If current trend continues and break $70 we are going to $50s
I'll buy when it tests all time new lows. They're coming folks
This looks ready to go...how about a $LMND like move?
Me waiting for $200 a share
Going to $100!! May the longs be with you.
ten dollar stock in a year
CITRON recommending LMND short? isn't it the same firm that shorted Tesla? Hmm..
"what should i do, hold or sell?"
Just popped 5%...up over 3% in pre?
90 by end of the week!! 100%%
Easy short in my opinion due to lack of fundamentals...
Sub60 coming
When Lemonade intros auto insurance stock will rocket.
Do not buy. We have major Puts and shorts in play. We will just take your money. This buy in isto close out the calls we have in place. Check Fintel.io
https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Root-Insurance-Leveling-the-playing-field.pdf.
Horrific stock to own.
"said this at much higher prices. They cant ever compete with Legacy insurance companies. These folks can hire talent and eat this company's lunch in the future. Buying premiums and having a loss ratio > 100 is a fools way to grow-- way overvalued, trading like 30 years worth of earnings. Target is IPO price. SELL"
IMO this will continue to lose value until the low $40’s. ROOT is a better buy as of now. It got beat down hard but at under $10 a share it’s looking good for online insurance bet.
You had your fun LMND shorts. Now it’s time to lock in your gains. This is headed back toward the highs. The market selloff is over. You don’t want to get caught holding the bag on your shortie gains. If you’re doubling down on your short positions here you are going to be in a world of pain soon. All your money will be gone.
also lemonade is offering more and more stocks because of the high market. Every 2 days they are offering 100k stocks. also insiders are selling their stocks fully. if you want do research. This fall even even more soon
RELI is a safe bet to start moving. 750k ftd's generated may 17th. No signs of covering. 40% borrow rate. LMND and HIPO both signed on with them to coincide with their new app launch/release literally any day now.
Wondering if now is still a good time to buy?
Remember when the CEO sold at the top
LMND showing true colors.
No need to be panic! Will pop up within 1-2 weeks
"If your losses are twice as much as your revenue, you’re not a company, you’re a Ponzi scheme."
After hours we looking good! Not looking for a one day trade here but long term were golden! Insurance industry online will be mammoth. May the longs be with you!!
When life gives you lemons…
Hurricane season in the gulf and south East and forest fire season in the pacific west. I won’t touch this unless it’s under $80.
What people are missing is that 33% shares are exiting lockout period this week . Flood of shares are coming up. Hopefully it doesn’t affect price too much
"This is a great company, will see $200 within 1-2 years."
"Longs here, here's my thoughts on this company. If this company over the next x amount of years, can become a typical player in the insurance industry, it's a decent investment. If the way they structure it they become a pioneer and start to dismantle the industry, then they can become a fast growth winner. What are the odds they disrupt this industry? How many insurance buyers care about the policy change in donation to charity, aside from the app and faster application and premium payment time?"
I made some gains in the first round entering at 112 and selling at 180. I am holding now at an average cost of $104 . Somehow have faith in its business model
"Since its establishment, Lemonade has incurred losses of some $250 million and is still bleeding money, The underwriters originally planned Lemonade will go public at a fair price value of $23 per share but the high demand led them to raise it to $26-$28 on Wednesday evening... will be nice short after the pumping hype"
"Wow, this is amazing, any good news?"
"Stay away… forest fires, floods and hurricanes. Eval in December. As it stand right now, this is for sure overpriced"
Will try to buy around mid 65 or so. I’m not sure it’ll drop that much though. Don’t want to miss out
Back over $100 fast and easy!
RELI had another good earnings
Would you like a cup of LMND on your ride?
Guess I’ll be holding for 10 years
Major flooding in NY and NJ should result in a deluge of claims. No reaction yet.
Seems 48-50 is the bottom. Next resistance is around 60 bucks. Happy to hold this for 2-4 years.
Great company and excellent customer service. Selling some $90 PUTS. I wouldn't mind owning this stock
"They didn’t do terrible they missed expectations by .10, so if your long term then this may be a good time to buy more"
Release the kraken!!!
I lost nothing today because I didn’t sell!
$100 Closing time Monday.
"not surprised, posted this months ago that this was so overvalued it was just insane. Now you can compare to a real insurance company - AIG just posted earnings yesterday and they were great. Real revenues, real earnings. And doesnt trade 60X sales. Never going to compete with a legacy multinational ins. company. Just another Millenial idea (e.g. Beyond meat) and change the world disruptor attitude which will FAIL."
I had to add :) !!!
"@Yahoo Member. You're wrong, Legacy companies haven't embraced AI yet. In fact, 10 years ago, the same was said about Geico and Progressive. They weren't even top 20 carriers. Today they're #2 and #3. Legacy co's don't adapt well"
"Why customer to give to Lemonades favorite charity? If customer wants give to a charity, can do so freely. I want next-gen insurance company like ROOT that's run by scientists and accountants, not millennial social justice venture."
"When it gets below $90, time to buy"
"I really feel that MF is off the mark big time with this pick. It might be innovative in how it gets quotes quickly, and using AI, but there are so many insurance companies in the game, and they can easily mimic whatever LMND is doing that is trending now. This is one of those times as of late, that Robin Hood investors need to dig deeper on this one and not get caught up in the hype."
"$LMND $50 is the bottom.. October great month! Load up .., short, mid, and long terms are all good from here"
ZERO GROWTH
70 soon
Looks like we are getting rid off the weak hands… $lmnd $root $ever
Wow.. my $75 put expiring Friday starting to look good!
"Lemonade will never make money , nor will ROOT , sellBoth !!!"
Maybe a bottom?
Last chance before the drive to $200!!
"Guidance for rest of the year $173 million loses, why would anyone buy this stock right now? I’m sure even next year it will be worse, $25 IPO price was more than enough"
"In my personal oppinion this is very simple. It is growing quick, customers are delighted, marketing spend per new customer is continuously reduced, while spend per customer is increasing, loss ratio is reduced, new services are added -> The company is awesomeThe valuation currently is sky high for the size of the company. They are making losses but the path to profitability is clear and relatively simple.So buy as much as you can for as cheap as you can and enjoy the long term gains!"
People who are begging you to short LMND:Shorted TSLAShorted PTONShorted TRUPNow wanting to short a disruptor in a $5 TRILLION industry. Look at the company and the model. Would YOU not switch to it once you read about that? Make your decisions based on that.
Motley pick. See how they spin this one.
I bought their pet insurance for my Pit Bull....then the stock price went up...good enough reason!
this may be the greatest investment since Amazon and tesla
"Lemonade is doing what it said it would be with charity. Lemonade takes 25% of its premium income to cover operating expenses and uses the other 75% to mainly purchase reinsurance policies— which limit losses — and to pay claims. If anything is left over, it goes to charity. In 2020, Lemonade’s “Giveback” was more than $1.1 million,"
I believe in chicken genius foresight.
I am not going anywhere.. will ride to $180 again.
"""Gross Profit""??? I have never seen an insurance company talk about Gross Profit. And that is because it is ridiculous and meaningless (and actually deceitful) for an insurance company. LMND is looking at revenues and taking out losses to get a ""gross profit""!!! Uhhh, that is usually what is called a ""Loss Ratio"" and theirs is almost 100% for the year. What they are doing is excluding the biggest piece of the pie - their enormous expenses for Sales & Marketing, Technology and Administration. These came to $113.2M for the first 6 months, which is a staggering number against $51.7 in revenue. I know they are young but those numbers are staggering.Their ""combined ratio"" (THE basic standard in the insurance industry) is roughly 300% - for every $1 they take in, it costs them $3..... wow, UGLY.... (I won't even get into the fact that they take the deceitful ""Gross Profit"" and then create a series of admittedly non-GAAP terms that work off the Gross Profit number....)Bottom line: for an insurance company to be successful, they have to be either great at underwriting (Loss Ratio) or great at efficiencies (Expense Ratio). LMND is currently terrible at both."
It's a Tesla of an insurance market.
These guys need car insurance in a bad way. Can’t compete if you don’t have the ability to bundle coverages.
"LMND. Industry, Insurance. Founded, April 2015; 6 years ago (2015-04) ... fast forward .... August 2021 ... this disruptive company generates revenues of about 100 million per year, after 6 years of being in business in 4 countries. USA insurance TAM, 2019 $5.2 trillion! USA homeowners market segment TAM $104 billion. Considering the slow growth and relatively low revenues, LMND needs to reconsider the effectiveness of its business model. Considering the TAM and to justify its lofty market cap, the revenues of this company should be doubling every year for the next 3 to 5 years. Such impressive growth rate would justify premium market cap and investor excitement. No doubt in my mind that there are insurance brokers working for some of the large insurance companies write annually as much insurance as LMND does with staff of 500 employees!"
$9 billion company with approximately $100m in revenue? Talking about a bubble.
Is LMND will be same as NKLA? 5 week from 300% up to back to IPO price?
Would love to buy back in at some point. Just want to see a good point. Want this bad boy to calm down a bit. It seems to be so volatile.
Can someone explain why the stock is up? I'm following it. Is it because Metromile is going public? But they sell completely different insurance products and seems the auto insurance is a bigger market than the online home owners and renters insurance.
Green at close tomorrow
"Wow, this was at 180 in Jan? Ugh."
Would I be okay to buy into this today and make money?
so glad i sold at 160
this is the easiest 2-3x in the market if you relax and remain long
"Down another 6%. If this wasn't such a small part of my investments I would be scared. As it is I am just irritated. I've put it in my Luckin Coffee portfolio, something I'll get a tax break on next year."
Love holding through all the pain! Only makes the gains that much better and bigger! May the longs be with you!!
"For all of us that didn’t listen to Dennis, congrats!! "
To the bottom we sink
i am holding 3500 shares from $50s. Should i be scared?
This may be the most bipolar stock lol
For everyone here from last Q they didn’t report until 5pm eastern.
"If I had to guess, I'd say LMND back to $180 in one month"
"More sell-off tomorrow and Friday as insiders and non-insiders can exit, limited to 33%. Interesting to see what comes next after 180 days after IPO when they can sell all, good opportunity to jump in ahead."
yeah... Loving my predictions. $100 by the end of May was missed by a few bucks. $120+ in June!!!
regret not buying this when it was on my watchlist at 80
buy now and thank me after earnings.
"big volume, i guess today they decided to sell"
"zero revenue growth for the year projected and widening losses, the stock should be priced as 30 max because zero growth, price to sales at 35 times should come down to 15 times or less."
Bullish Engulfing. Next week will be likely be a good one
"I've got PING, FSLY and LMND with earning today... Wish me luck!At least LMND is delivering so far today..."
I think retail investors without insurance background or understand insurance fundamentals should stay away from this stock. Tired of seeing these uneducated and quite frankly moronic comments.
lemonade needs to use the charity money as a tax deduction to the holder
"they say it went to the public at $29, but it started trading at $49.02, why? How come for many IPOs it is never the price they say it will open at, but rather much higher?"
"Took a quick look at the earnings. Rev beat but down YOY, earnings not great. Tough Q for shareholders"
"Just wait until they offer auto insurance.Auto Insurance is required by law in most, if not all states.Umbrella insurance is also another hole to be filled"
Up with no news? Glad I added more at the dip
Double bottom or down to 60?
When $55?
"Really starting think that I should be betting heavier on this. This is better than $LMND, yet it trades for 10x less. Absurd. This will be corrected overtime. This will be a millionaire maker."
James remember what I said. Pumpers and bagholders beware. First stop is $50.
I’d get back in at $80. July is proving out to be a month of retreating from fear of inflation. Honestly this year may end flat of down. Repeat of 2018. Although 2019 was a year of growth. I’m betting on 2022!
"So much love from Motly Fools for this stock… don’t get it. Every earnings report, this stock tanks and there is a build up. Last earnings report there was a reason (deep freeze) not this time. One more bad earnings report, lemonade will go to ipo price. Too much hype from Motly and others…"
Man these $nio and PLTR and $lmnd are tanking like there is no tomorrow!TOTAL CRASH! TOTAL LOSSS........Help Me God!
90 by next week
"Looks like I was right about the sell call yesterday. Hopefully y’all bought back in today at 8% discount. Ride it back up. This time it should break resistance. I think in the next short term company will be announcing the tremendous increased demand for their product. Home sales, especially for millennials continues to boom! That means all new insurance premiums baby! Check out their site and get a quote if you have any doubt. You’ll be buying this stock in no time!!!"
it was $80.28 this morning. Thanks for hanging in there. There are some of us that own at over $100
45% in 6 months 
RELI will soon have direct ties with LMND once the app releases. The app is likely releasing any day this month.
"Tesla or Amazon wasn't profitable for a long time. If this venture succeeds, easily $100b market cap."
Earnings are going to be solid for sure!! Long live lemonade. Long term greatness!!!
Maybe insiders can't sell today. Volume is really low for a lock up. CEO could have shared some information to cause a blackout from insiders trading.
Earnings are not out yet. Don’t read into this downward spike just yet.
Buy buy buy!! All day long!! Don’t kiss the big upward movement by end of this week. Forever stock!!
Buying above 60 is absolutely crazy
Might pop next week to around 70
Hard to see the upside when margins get worse every quarter.
Why don’t you drop 50% while you’re at it
Still overvalued
"All these comments, does nobody look at fundamentals?"
Well this was a bad buy $20 ago....
Eyes on RELI to move by next week. 5 minute insure about to launch. LMND will get a boost from sympathy as well
"Check out RELI they are doing much better then lemonade with their company that's called Nsure! They have thousands only 5 star Google reviews, and that company is just worth $30 million dollars! Do your due diligence and it will speak for itself!! HUGE GAINS WILL COME ONE DAY"
"If LMND can hold on a day like today, what do you think will happen on a day when they announce a new European country, or a new type of insurance? $200 is in the cards for 2021."
LOL
CNBC is having the CEO of Lemonade speak in a couple of minutes...no idea what he is going to say but you might want to tune in!
$100 by EOW. Very strong company and passed the risky phase
Above expectations. What's impressive is growth rate. Just shy of a million customers already. Lookin' good.
Only buy at 30
Going back to $100 by EOW.
"when is the ER, can we expect a surge back to 70 before ER?"
"WOW .. IT""S TIME TO BUY SOME MORE LMND .. ;)"
Going buying price?
Really wanted this company to succeed. Love their brand identity and marketing and the way they conduct business. Really is too bad that most Americans aren’t aware of their business..
Company donations are at all time high. Which means sales and cost cutting are also going to be all time high and continuing.
VTNR - safe haven
Even after this huge crash this stock still trades at 60 times sales. that is just crazy!
GO LMND!
What the heck is going on with this stock? Why is it down so much?
$25 PT
Cup/handle formation...!!
"I was waiting for a pull back to get a position, but now I’m a bit sketched out... why would they do a offering after Q4 is over but before they announce the results. Their company open trading window is closed. Something feels off. I’m all in on the business model and lemonade as a 10 bagger long term, but it feels like they are trying to capitalize on the price before Q4 results."
I see a bullish trend for Monday!
If you are a powerful stock advisory service then the your recommendations should show stock increases no more than one week after your recommendation and the increase should be sustained for no less than a month anything other than this should be considered scamming which my 9 year old boy is able to do and get the same results if not better
that was my worst investment
VIX is above 23 today and taper news is not good for this stock…
Easy buy the dips here! Will go right back up
"Bought a tiny tiny bit .......was making a 2 day 6% return......and then KABOOM ! haha, okay, I have some more money to add....let's see in a couple of days....."
What’s causing the pull back? Good time to enter?
