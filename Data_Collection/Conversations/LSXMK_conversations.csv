Were gonna eat shorts here very soon. stockbets is all over this and on the list and i can't wait!!!!
"Just curious as to how you guys view John Mephistopheles Malone’s SiriusXM share price suppression program? I’ve spent months and months highlighting the blatant and manipulative actions employed to keep SiriusXM from trading higher so that they can get the cheapest possible shares on the buybacks￼, which, in turn, gives Mephistopheles and Liberty greater and greater ownership for free.This highly manipulative practice is completely unethical and lacks integrity at a minimum. Any notion of fiduciary duty to the common retail minority shareholder is nonexistent."
Liberty Broadband is another tracking stock of Malone's Liberty Media which owns 25% of Charter Communications. After Spinoff price started off around $30 per share in which Liberty Media shareholders received 4 for 1 ratio. Liberty Broadband is now trading at $130 per share and Charter Communications above $500 per share
LSXMB is up 6.93% to 47.80
When do ya'll think Malone going to execute the spinoff by merging Liberty Sirius XM Radio with Liberty Sirius XM Radio Holdings? Nobody wants to talk about it on Sirius XM Radio Holdings message board but it fixes the share outstanding problems because the 3 investors share Class structure will take care of Malone's 3.2 billion shares by putting them into Class B shares then doing 10 for reverse stock split only on his Class B shares bc he will be receiving 10 for 1 voting Rights for each share allowing Malone to keep control of company. Just my humble opinion!!!
i am in guys
"Lsxma trading two times normal volume down almost 2% yesterday while Siri was up about half a percent on normal volume. Even after Barron’s pump of the trackers trading at a 40% discount to Siri, it seems an elusive goal to close that gap. After all these years trying to close the gap I can only conclude institutional investors don’t believe, trust, or like what Liberty is doing."
"Oversubscription request reduced by 90%, disappointing yet promising going forward."
What did I miss on that? long investor here
"Malone is getting Live Nation Entertainment ready to transfer 34% ownership of Ticketmaster into Sirius XM Radio holdings either before or after spinoff of Sirius XM. Paying off margin loan early so that he can start moving assets. Iheartmedia should come out of Bankruptcy next month which will also be moved into Sirius XM Radio holdings either before or after spinoff. Just my humble opinion!!!!Liberty Media Corporation Proposes Private Offering of Exchangeable Senior Debentures https://seekingalpha.com/pr/17341400?source=ansh $FWONA, $FWONK, $LSXMA, $LSXMB, $LSXMK, $BATRA, $BATRK"
"So basically this is a tracking stock of Siri ..... but Siri only has one business . A true tracking stock was designed for a conglomerate that had many different businesses ie: ge .. healthcare , energy , etc. so what is the purpose with this ?"
"Starting on Jan 11, this wont be able to be purchased on Robinhood."
"Question I read article on Seeking Alpha should you buy Sirius XM holdings or discounted tracking stock Liberty Sirius XM Group Hypothetically speaking if the spin off occurred today with merger between Liberty Sirius XM Group (LXMSA) and Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI).The ratio is currently 9.5. does that mean if someone owned 1,000 LSXMA shares after spinoff would they own 9,000 shares of SIRI in new company after spinoff. How many shares would 1,000 shares in SIRI shareholders get in new company after spinoff? I'm a little confused on ratioShould You Buy Sirius XM Or The Deeply Discounted Tracking Stocks?Should You Buy Sirius XM Or The Deeply Discounted Tracking Stocks? https://seekingalpha.com/article/4222659?source=ansh $SIRI, $BRK.A, $BRK.B, $LSXMA, $LSXMB, $LSXMK"
This company is owned by some big time players. Im waiting for someone to come in and swoop them up but the question is who would be a good fit looking for this mega radio entertainment conglomerate. Its built quite an empire and recently got approval to aquire 50% of Iheart radio. Malone did the same thing with them(bought it out after bankruptcy) as he did with Sirius. Paid pennies on the dollar. This will have to be a big payday someday when the right suitor comes along.
No doubt C agreed. Greg and John are savvy business extraordinaires and are setting it up. https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/liberty-media-moves-live-nation-stake-formula-one-siriusxm-1291487
"Malone and Maffei have been shrewd investors in media and cable TV properties like Charter Communications (CHTR) and Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI) over the past 15 years. Neither shrinks from using leverage to magnify returns.Malone exercises control or near-control of nearly all of the Liberty companies through supervoting class B shares. This includes flagship Liberty Media and its three tracking stocks: Liberty Braves (BATRA), Liberty SiriusXM Holdings (LSXMA), and Formula One Group (FWONA), as well as Liberty Broadband (LBRDK)."
I would love to see a takeover(Verizon according to Barrons) of LXSMA...huge upside plus you would start to get a nice dividend...this happened a few years ago when I held DTV for years only to be taken over by ATT
"Q1 2019 Update Of Liberty Sirius Discount To Underlying Assets https://seekingalpha.com/article/4270415?source=ansh $SIRI, $LSXMA, $LSXMB, $LSXMK"
ANYONE have thoughts about this post from the SIRI board this AM ?Duke: A Change In Strategy--Part 3SIRI purchased about 70M shares in the quarter at a cost of $6.10-$6.20. Do the math and they spent about $425M which equates to the company's FCF. In other words they are using you money to fund the BB. The dividend that Liberty receives is being used to BB the outstanding float of LSXMA and here is the key Maffei suggested that SIRI's FCF could be used to BB the shares of LSXMA which I considered crazy at the time.It would appear that Liberty is on a dual track of freezing out both SIRI shareholders and LSXMA holders or at least reducing the outstanding float of LSXMA.The interesting thing is that the convertible bonds don't mature until June 2023 so it looks like Liberty could strip mine both issues until then and then do a buy out. You have lived through almost four years with a stock that has gone nowhere.Team Malone is betting that you won't be able to stomach another two years of this pain. Don't let them beat you. Hang on to the last day.I have already booked three more vacations this year and can't afford to lose this gig so it would be nice if you pledged your undying allegiance to the stock.
Problem is that most NEW cars will allow your phone to be the computer and radio all in one so--why have sirius? Just like Garmin -GPS etc..why have it when phone has it all for free?
"When is notice of oversubscription available, I haven't received such as of now. (discount %, or instructions.)"
"So glad I chose to sell my rights, I knew this would happen. Now buy at a bigger discount!"
LSXMB is up 16.35% to 46.97
I'm still confused about a tracking stock. Is this just tracking Liberty's shares of Siri?
"Amazing how article only talks about Formula One Group and Buffett buying 3 million shares but nothing about Buffett buying Liberty Sirius XM (LSXMA,LSXMB,LSXMK) and moving ownership stake to 17% plus 3% ownership stake in Sirius XM Radio Holdings (SIRI). Formula One Group and Atlanta Braves will have an horrendous year while Sirius XM Radio is doing well and still growing during these conditions"
"Time for Spinoff this tracking stock has underperformed tremendously since the beginning. Why waste anymore time and money? Malone and Buffett together owns the 80% needed to finally do Spinoff. Merging Liberty Sirius XM Group (LSXMA,LSXMB,LSXMK and Sirius XM Radio Holdings (SIRI)Combined ownership between Malone and Buffett. This has been the longest Malone has ever allowed a tracking stock to underperform. He usually absorbs it back into Liberty Media Corporation or does spinoff. Just my humble opinion!!!"
"The hardware, the potential. Sirius is put into a lot of cars. Seems like many opportunities ."
LSXMB is up 10.31% to 48.03
"WDLF, a very interesting social media company with a bunch of very interesting platforms would be a great acquisition for LSXMA. Extremely inexpensive."
Sirius XM Radio should acquire 17% ownership of Live Nation plus 34% Liberty Sirius XM Group already owns would give it 51% majority share ownership stake. Instead they wasted money on acquiring small Podcasts companies. $500 million could have been invested in Live Nation or Iheartmedia
"WESCHLER, R. TED, Member of 10% owner group of Liberty Media Corp BOUGHT 450000 shares on 2020-06-01. https://formwhispers.com/s?t=LSXMK"
LSXMA will eventually buy ALL Live Nation. I believe LSXMA will one day be the biggest music media giant in the world!! Long and Strong!
"LSMXA is the least expensive growth stock I know of. If anyone knows of a better GARP stock, I'm all ears."
LSXMB is up 5.60% to 41.47
Why the big drop? The F1 losses? $36 Seems a nice price to buy in for the long term
Vivendi is putting up 50% ownership stake of Universal Music Group for sale. Any opinions for Sirius XM Radio Holdings to acquire minority ownership stake or 50% ownership stake with of course help from Liberty Media Corporation
"Time for Spinoff tracking stock has underperformed tremendously. Merge Liberty Sirius XM Group (LSXMA,LSXMB,LSXMK) and Sirius XM Radio Holdings (SIRI)Obviously the market hasn't liked tracking stock."
30% discount to the underlying SIRI stock. What is it going to take to close the discount?
