My stocks to buy and hold.$FB $PH $NIO $T $BABACash cows and huge growth potential mix.I love $FB now.
Congratulations to Parker Hannifin for a fantastic quarter!
Parker Enoloyee here .. It’s a solid buy .. can’t go wrong ! I’m all in.
I work for Parker - extremely solid - and Aerospace sector is only approx 10% of the Parker business. We are booming. And much of our work is military anyways - our stock will likely bounce back once all this hype is over. We have a massive cash flow base too.
For the past 10 years PH has grown organically. I hope that continues. I’d like to remain a long term investor in this as a store if value with consistent growth. I’m not getting excited about acquisitions and market cap financial tricks.
Bought my initial purchase today at 290....Long term hold
Best stock ever...bought 2000 shares at 89....love you PH!
this is a buy and hold .. simple
Not a glamor stock. But has been a core holding for years. Just letting the dividend keep buying more.Venerable company. Congrats on the high!
Would like to see a 5-1 split. Not been a split since I believe 2007. Get this back into a range to bring in more investors. 3-2 wont do it now. To high of a price. Been in this thing since 2001 when I worked there and was buying shares a couple splits ago at 25-30 bucks a share through payroll deduction. Been a long time I might be off a couple bucks on the share price I paid
"nice earnings, no love. i keep seeing a stream of upward earnings estimates but the stock seems stuck here"
You don't raise the dividend 17% unless you're going to beat earnings.
PH has started to rise and I hope it continues. Barron's had some article suggesting good things for PH. Any views?
"And with the games with the gme amc and BB. Come on, that will be short lived. Ultimately, people will gravitate back to value, earnings and reality.Or true companies. Not burning low life short sellers cashing in on weak, or close to bankrupt companies.Buy $T Buy $NIO BUY $PHAnd consider $PYPL $BABAThere are gems out there. The phenomenon with attacking low life short sellers will not end well for both sides.Stay safe, financially and health wise.Cheers!"
$PH acquisition of Meggitt UK. Bloomberg news.
"PH is a really good company. A truly diverse market presence that has held up through the oil industry fluctuations. PH is in petroleum aerospace motion control filtration automotive. I’ve seen this company reorganize and refocus, and the value has steadily increased. That said I’m over allocated and will take profits each time we hit a new high. Once I’m at my target allocation I’ll buy dips again. Long $PH."
"I'm a buyer at 250. Lots of uncertainty in the stock market. One or two bad market days and this could easily hit 250. September is historically a volatile month, so we shall see."
Back to $154-$155. Stock ran up for no reason. I will buy more around $155
"British defence firm Meggitt has moved a step closer to falling into foreign hands after shareholders gave the green light to a £6.3 billion takeover by US group Parker Hannifin.The majority of investors voted in favour of the deal at a general meeting held by the group, with the backing of 99.8% of votes cast and 86.8% of investors."
"PH is on sale, until 11am today.... Better take advantage of this buying opportunity."
