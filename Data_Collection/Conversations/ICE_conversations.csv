"Could their best investment be an reinvestment in itself? — a respectable buyback of their own shares would be a good investment as everyone knows this stock is worth much more than it’s currently trading. The most appealing of this company’s attractive facets is it’s consistency in market performance. It would send a positive message overall, and I too many historically positive references to site, GOOG, V (Visa), SCHW, AMGN, PEP, T (AT&T), VZ, CSCO, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN..."

"ICE just reported a 20% increase YOY on option & futures trading volume, which most definitely will increase profit dramatically going forward. Their Bakkt cryptocurrency exchange is also a groundbreaking move for the company. Remember, ICE makes money regardless of which direction the market moves. It's the ultimate combination of safety & growth. It won't take long for momentum to build to the $85-$88 range IMO."
The current valuation on Coinbase is 77B. When they go public ICE will recognize income on their investment gain. 77 x .018 = 1.386 B valuation in investment most of which will be gain
Best way to own the exchanges is through ICE...Wide moat stock with relative stable cash flows and less likelihood of getting disrupted over the long-term.

Good news / bad news? Bad news is they sold their stake in Coinbase. Good news is gain of $ 900 M gain net of taxes. Bad news is no ownership of Coinbase which is the leading exchange and disruptor. Good news is it really improves the balance sheet and should help the stock price.

"So the WSJ reported a rumor of an informal meeting, let the shares fall and rise as anyone could have guessed, which forced the hand of Intercontinental Exchange to confirm it had approached them, but they weren’t interested... hmmm... right before a positive earnings announcement... that’s either reporting with low professionalism — or potentially shorting on a whole other level to buy up low shares of a very solid stock — maybe both — thoughts on this? No disclaimers by the “journalists” at WSJ as to any interests held in either company or not... Sorry to say this, but something reminds me of the salmon I forgot about in the fridge last week... Did anyone else see a flag on the field is this a unique line of thought?"

not understanding the selloff in ICE given the huge volume of trades on its exchanges in the last month. seems like it would be a beneficiary of the market turmoil.
I am sure ICE will be involved in the near future with NFT's. Possibly having a exchange to trade intellectual property.

"I hope Kelly Loeffler doesn’t become involved with this company again after leaving the Senate. She doesn’t have a philosophical core, so what’s the point of leading others as a CEO?

Her retraction today was inadequate and doesn’t excuse her campaign or self-serving trading and messaging in the early days of Covid-19."
