I'm not crying. I am saying from a financial aspect. There will be investigations and lawsuits. That will cost them money and state contracts.
When does this downward spiral end? Do I invest more?
"Centene posting huge revenue gains year over year. Centene is a modern insurance company that cares about its customers. This is reflected in their recent profit, which declined, while their revenue increased substantially. Thats an indication on the culture at this company. Other health insurance companies will deny as many claims as they can for treatments, sometimes leading to patients deaths (for profit), there are many unethical health insurance companies... but this isn't one of them. With this ""rotation"", money will be flowing into value like this. If they are treating their customers well, you can probably trust that they will continue to grow quickly and become a larger player. Raj like the stock "
This is heading to $60 and beyond
"I guess investors like the new CFO, lol. What else is driving price up?"
"Long 1700 shares on CNC at $62.74. This is a Pure Earnings play., I bought the shares just a few hours ago, specifically to hold through earnings release tomorrow. I am expecting beats on EPS and Revenue consensus estimates, along with good Guidance, to drive this stock up in price to the $68 level. Why did I choose CNC over 70+ other stocks that I analyzed? Here is a quick summation:CNC: Excellent earnings history, beats on both EPS and Revenue for the past 6 quarters, and 11 of the past 12 quarters. Very good Guidance history, very good stock price reactions to earnings, historically. Currently trading at fair value, not cheap, but certainly not an expensive valuation. Recent, positive news media articles. Excellent EPS growth over the recent past. Company is very profitable. Analysts are generally bullish, giving very good upside potential on PT's. Many positive and recent analyst comments on numerous aspects of CNC, including merger with Wellcare. Very good overall financials, stable and growing business in a sector I like. Of course this is all just my subjective opinion, and Best of Luck to everyone with whatever stocks you choose to play! :-)"
"CNC focuses on Healthcare for low income and disadvantaged people. Medicare, Medicaid, and open market plans.With the new administration in place, I believe CNC is very well positioned to benefit from this political landscape."
Cramer s pick
It's going to go down.
Triple average volume. Big boys starting to pile in.
Why up a couple of bucks in after hours? I can't see any news.
will this ever get back to the 70s?
Oh baby! Did the shorts close their positions or what!? Keep going!
CNC will continue to make money and grow. That’s all that really matters long term.
Another 52 week low!
"At $134, this is a good quick buy for today's selloff. It will bounce back to $138-$142 in a matter of days."
Why no dividend?
In at $60.15. Liked the positive outlook for 2021. We will see how it goes. Hope any of the bad news is already priced in.
A lot of people are going to wish they bought in at these levels. Great value now. Adding more tomorrow.
sweet run
"Rising with good volume. Bullish indication in Stochastic oscillator and RSI, according to stoxline."
Buffet stock also at some.point maybe revenue could get to 75b in a heart beat with all 50 states
3/27 news says deductible will be waived. Will that result in increased business for Health Care Providers like CNC or is that lose of income?
"Wellcare seems to be the perfect acquisition at the perfect time for Centene. The combined company has a lot of potential, cheap valuation, I am long CNC. Shorts better search for another target."
Great earnings and great management. Just a overall great company that is not affected by tariffs and is a great hedge to the tech influenced market.
on a tear!! long and strong!!! great value with huge growth potential in market cap and future.
Watch for new highs soon.
Centene is down 4.98% to 62.71
Closing above $60 today would be a great start toward a rebound of stock price.
Love this stock!!! This will go up to>100 before the end of this year. Go cnc!!!!
My guess is that company said they are not bidding on potential divestitures. Comment was made during conference call.
You can save 15% by switching to Geico
It looks like we are taking the tender offer!
CEO to be on Mad Money tonight. Hope he can clear up the picture for the company with all this Medicare for All making all the headlines.
This should still be an $80 stock and will do well under Trump.
"Listened to the conference call. Niedorff had a very bad cold, coughing and hacking throughout and sometimes seeming ""out of it."" Analysts had many questions but nothing of particular note. Sell-off has been brutal. Not something I understand. Anyone have any thoughts?"
"Getting ready for higher prices. Both technical and fundamental are looking strong, according to stoxline and stockFA."

"Sold all my shares, this one is not going anywhere for now until close of merger. Bought sftbf instead."
I loaded too much of this stock in my IRA account today @ 51.18. keeping my fingers cross.
"The traders should pay attention to this stock, CnC. The earnings will announce on July 23rd, EPG is huge around 28-30%. With WCG buy out, completing in 2020 first quarter will increase the growth both top line and bottom line. I kind of like the stock unless the market tanks, this stock should be in good hand."
what just happened to these healthcare stocks?
"What the problem with this stock, keep dropping to new lows with no news !"
"CNC focuses on Healthcare for low income and disadvantaged people. Medicare, Medicaid, and open market plans.With the new administration in place, I have a feeling there may be some money to be made with CNC"
"Will hit $65 tomorrow. Way, and I mean way, undervalued. Look at their balance sheet"
"Fair Value Calculation USD $116.36Analysis of the stock’s current worth, based on CFRA’sproprietary quantitative model suggests that CNC isundervalued by USD 50.99 or 78.00%"
Is this massive sell off because of Bernie and the progressive social medical agenda? If so I would be buying all I can! After all socialism will not prevail!
CNC is up 4.92% to 60.55
Govt pay n it is wellcare who puts this over the top great move
God bless people selling today. So generous.
"Looking at performance of ""relatively young"" Healhcare provider stocks: both $HUM and $CNC grew 12x over last 10 years. Cost of healthchare is not getting cheaper any time soon, and US 65+ years old population is only growing. So 12x stock price increase for $CLOV (~$100) can be achieved way quicker than in 10 years."
Did I miss something? why is CNC crashing today?
Cup and handle forming. Bullish.
Can't get any momentum. I fear I will never get back to even.
if you in this for good today is a great day to buy I got some
I am long!
"I think earnings can beat and with how beat down the stock is, there can be a nice pop. Any thoughts?"
this happens every single election period where Democrats risk of winning sinks health care stocks.......just wait it out and stay short until Warren is in the rearview mirror and get long quickly thereafter
I remeber when there was more than spam on this board. Is there anybody still interested in conversing?
Someone is going to make a lot of money on this over sold stock
This stock has been abused
"expecting 1.52-1.68 in Q4, compared to .93 (3 thumbs up!)"
$CNC Maintains Credit Suisse Neutral USD 73.5 » USD 70Maintains Morgan Stanley Overweight USD 88 » USD 79
"What's going on with this co. After we approved the deal, it just continue to nose dive. I think the CEO and managers are the only ones happy now."
Whats wrong with this #$%$
"As well as this has done lately, I believe it's still undervalued."
I listened in on a call last week with PA mediciad reps and a multitude of Centene mediciad partipants reps who complained about the poor services they received resulting in increased hospitalizations and one group Liberty resources participant had died. This is not a socially responsible company and do not deserve your investment dollars. They are also receiving pushback from the direct care workers union for their practices.
It’s good to accumulate down here but the stock is probably dead until merger is complete in 1H 2020
"Tax Increases Under 'Medicare For All'So, how much would taxes have to increase?As it stands, a family earning more than $250,000 annually pays 24% toward taxes. To pay for a ""Medicare for All"" single-payer health care system, their tax bracket would rise to 40%, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said, citing a white paper from Sanders.Further, ""if you add up the Sanders estimate on revenue raised from these taxes, it's barely half way to the actual cost of the plan as estimated by conservative Mercatus Centers ($32 trillion),"" he said."
CNC will be at $70+ by months end.
Has anyone seen what the 2020/2021 EPS estimates would be when the Wellcare merger is completed early next year??Thx
will be at the Street's target price of 81 by June!
8 billion has been shaved from the market cap of CNC because of investors afraid of MFA. This isn't going to happen. HUM should come in and just buy the company at this lower value.
What a steal! Accumulate! Fear of Medicare for all. Not gonna happen.
Uptrend coming soon. Especially with Morgan Stanley cutting their price target to stir more weakness
"About to be a year since I opened my position in this stock, and ever since it’s been nothing but good news, yet I’m down big"
IF deductibles are waived is that less revenue for managed care Providers like CNC or more business for them?
Just bought some. Can't go much lower.
CNC is a good company and I feel this is an over reaction of the news. This will recover.
Completely under valued! Best time to buy!
CNC eps flat revenue beat. And IOWA caucus result delayed. What are your views guys ?
Just bought this morning premarket @49 and change. I will either be out by the end of the day or most likely long hold
Bought yesterday at ~$63 to diversify from my Tech holdings.Great that it has a forward PE of only about 15.5. And no China exposure.
No runup on this rumor so why the big drop?
What is going on today?
Momentum is growing in the upward favor! - Bullish
Centene is up 4.90% to 73.43
Does the market still believe ACA get can overtuned with a Biden president but Republican Senate? Lagging other MCO a LOT today.
"Best gig economy play, which will grow. They have to have insurance"
Why is it down so much pre
"Reactions to earnings are so biased its incredible. Read the tremendous difference in the headlines on CNC's quarterly report today - it borders on being comical. ""CNC Misses Q2 Earnings Estimates"", ""Centene Posts Better Than Expected Adjusted Profit - Offers Upbeat Guidance"" take your pick but you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't read beyond the headlines."
New low very likely today.
Trump is not helping things
just got my limit order filled....seems way too beaten up
Sharon just posted complete lies and we will see if the SEC will do anything...probably not. You can get away with anything on these boards. Stock will be up tomorrow ...small amount but will most likely erase the after hour MM's shorts. We shall see...good luck to all.
Good buy here today right under 52 week low.
This makes no sense. Great earnings. Great growth and Beyond Meat up 600 percent! This keeps falling.
Buy more!
Why is this tanking
Imagine all the people that would be out of work if there is a single payer healthcare system. Let's see what the unemployment figures would be
"if the market goes down tomorrow or day after tomorrow, will it keep up its upward trend? coz of positive earning?"
Wondering if CNC will have a runup from these levels prior to annual year end dividend distribution?
"After I close my ABG Long position on Monday, I will be using almost all of my available hard capital to go Long CNC. This is a Pure Earnings play, CNC reports earnings on Tuesday, PM, and I am expecting a very good earnings report, beats on EPS and Revenue, along with good Guidance, to lift this stock up in price by 4-8%. I analyzed a whole heck of a lot of different possible plays for Mon AH/Tue PM, and CNC came to the very top, in terms of excellent odds of success and a top risk/reward scenario. Here is a short synopsis of my thinking, along with the second and third place runner-up:#1 CNC Long: Excellent earnings history, beats on both EPS and Revenue for the past 6 quarters, and 11 of the past 12 quarters. Very good Guidance history, very good stock price reactions to earnings, historically. Currently trading at fair value, not cheap, but certainly not an expensive valuation. Recent, positive news media articles. Excellent EPS growth over the recent past. Company is very profitable. Analysts are generally bullish, giving very good upside potential on PT's. Many positive and recent analyst comments on numerous aspects of CNC, including merger with Wellcare. Very good overall financials, stable and growing business in a sector I like. #2: RACE Long: Good earnings history. Excellent Guidance history. Very good reactions by stock to ER's. Slightly overvalued right now, but an extremely well-managed company executing on all fronts right now. The rich are getting richer and they want their Ferrari's. Very positive comments by analysts. Good upside potential on PT's. Company has absolutely excellent overall financials at this time. I am especially bullish on forward Guidance for this one. Rates very high, but for me definitely below CNC. 3: BECN Sell Short: This is a very attractive Short Sell play. Company appears very badly managed. They should be profitable, but they are not. Very poor earnings history, have missed either EPS or Revenue consensus for 7 of the last 10 quarters. Recent Guidance has been poor, they guided Down 4 out of the past 6 guidance revisions. Overall financials are below average for the sector. Analysts are mixed, with some seeing a recovery in 2020 for the company, and at least one company insider is buying shares recently. But at this time, based on my analysis, stock is still genuinely over-valued. I am expecting a poor ER, to be followed by a drop in stock price, potentially as much as 8-12%. But I'm still not gonna play this one, CNC still looks better to the upside, in terms of risk/reward analysis. Other stocks I like a lot on this date, all to go up, include:FNNXPIHAELHXAny comments or opinions, positive or negative, are welcome and appreciated. :-) Best of Luck to All! :-)"
institutional holders are loading and keeping the price down to accumulate more. once they are done all analyst will upgrade and rally begins once it crosses 64.5 then the party is on
I investigated this company and bought it due to its lack of volatility and solid business practices and if Obamacare gets repealed by the Supreme Court what can I expect from this company as far as a long-term return
Oops.. activist investors decided to back out of recommending Humana?
"According to Marketwatch, short interest is 30 mil shares as of 8/30/19. That’s a 5 mil increase from 8/15. Someone is playing with fire because no way is “Medicare for a All” is going to be implemented. None of the democrats have a definite plan on how to finance it! They won’t say for sure that only the rich will be taxed. Seems like everyone will bear the cost together."
Every time the CEO goes on Mad Money it goes down the next few days. Watch.
Cnc should give up buying wcg and allow humana to buy the co. Cnc price will explode and everybody wins.
"Who is selling?... Who cares, Ill buy your shares! Thanks."
Zacks posts are useless. Anybody that buys and sells on their commentary deserves what they get!
Higher than its ever been
"UBX - Unity Biotechnology, Bezos Expeditions invests in living longer!"
"Agree ! i am selling the week. After merger news is over, so is the price increases"
Don’t see how shorts can cover without paying 60+ for this.
"SVB Leerink analyst Ana Gupte called the ISS recommendation unsurprising and said that shareholders will likely vote in favor of the deal on June 24, when both companies are set to hold meetings.""We expect, in the short term Centene stock will be volatile, with risk arbitrage funds shorting the name,"" she added.Last month, Reuters reported that hedge funds Corvex Management LP and Sachem Head Capital Management LP, which have stakes in Centene, were exploring challenging the WellCare deal, citing people familiar with the matter.Some healthcare investors had also speculated Humana Inc would make a bid for Centene, but the company earlier this month confirmed it had no intention of doing so."
"Bought at 52, sold at 50, bought back today at 47. Happy!"
take over
I bought an sold when it pop a couple of weeks ago waiting for the 47s again that might be the go green again
Say what you want about CNC’s value. It is trading at 1.26x book value - unbelievably undervalued even if they lose a chunk from Obamacare rulings. If it drops any lower - the market cap would be under $30B. I wonder if a United Healthcare or Humana might take a shot at a merger/acquisition...esp with CNC holding over $14B in cash.
Growth n govt payer 20 to 30% eps grower
Medicare for all idea is fizzling out of favor. Cnc is a 70 dollar stock after the merger.
thoughts on earnings?
Just a massive beat! 40% YoY revenue growth.
top of my watchlist
I am in for another round of options in CNC. Hit good last time. Bought the Sept 57.5 @1.74 so far up 70%.Wish I would have bought more. Not enough to make big money.
All the recent positive analyst updates took a backseat to the real news today that CNC pharmacy benefits arm overbilled states - Ohio and Mississippi suits are being settled for $143 million while - in addition to that amount - the company is setting aside an additional $1.1 billion to settle similar lawsuits in other states. I keep getting bit by companies bending the rules - last year it was First Energy this time it's Centene. I'll wait another day to see how the dust settles on this but inasmuch as I got in at the end of April for just under $60 I'm leaning towards bailing out. Other not great news is that an arm of Humana is moving into the Atlanta market going after the same senior market Centene is after.
The upgrades coming tomorrow morning - get long before the close!
"Good morning longs, I thought this was a good opportunity to add to my portfolio last Thursday. GLTA!"
I just read an article from Zacks. They have a (5) rating on CNC which is a strong sell. That's a sure buy signal for me.

"Wellcare, who CNC bought\buying, had positive ER, therefore, CNC is up."
Any see a $100 this year
"The one remaining overhang on the stock is the ACA case. If the court decision is reversed, as all the experts say it will be, this is a $160 stock."
Centene is the most corrupt thing to ever happen to Medicaid. They cut benefits as soon as they get the con tracts and hassle the recipients with endless paperwork and reviews. please invest in more socially responsible companies. This is like investing in Tabacco.
"Nice to see money into undervalued stocks like Centene. The great rotation from growth to value has legs. Stay long, this one could see $90 before too long..."
The performance in the last 5 Years is horrible considering the market we have been in. Time for a change and perhaps set a dividend
"CVS will report earning on Wednesday will bring Heath Care sector up , I hope ."
Just initiated a position in CNC. Strong cash flow generation and its focus on tech make this one of the most interesting stocks in the insurance space.
Must be profit taking by long-term holders like myself...while I don't see why that makes sense. I bought at $63 and while taking money out would seem logical it would be in conflict w/ CNC RAISING their guidance in the earnings call. Bullish on this stock and think it will be heading upward again in just a few days.
We are waiting on the guidance?
"Numbers and outlook very positive, expect MM to try and drive down early and then lift off later today or tomorrow!"
"So far this stock has been my worse investment of 2019. Earnings were good. They have growth. Seem to have good management. Not effected by the trade war. Some where I went way wrong on this one. My stock is way down and my Sept calls are almost worthless.Can't be right all the time, but usually it becomes obvious where you were wrong. Still trying to figure it out here. Thinking about averaging down some but feels like a falling knife at this time.Good luck longs."
"Out CNC at $62.18 for a loss of just about $950.00. Didn't work out quite as I had hoped and planned, but...can't win them all, and when I lose, I like to lose SMALL. :-) Immediately jumped into BOOT, long 2500 shares at $41.61. Got a very good fill price in BOOT, bought just before 12 Noon, and in just a few minutes we should have an idea of how smart or dumb this latest Pure Earnings play of mine might turn out to be. :-) Best of Luck to All! :-)"
great acquisition news...buying thru 70...great trigger in an expanding market for insured mental/addiction health treatments
Im thinking Im out until for a little while and see what happens this week..
Great numbers! This stock seems to be greatly underappreciated by the market.
Been in since 62 and it’s getting rough
CNC is not a company that is in trouble. I just doubled my position at 48.70. Looking to see $60 by end of year
"A little overreaction here, Axiom is an asset every other managed care organization has in its back pocket already."
"Thank you Linda Z. Saw your post on the CVS board this morning about Centene. Didn’t catch the bottom this morning but in for a cost basis of $47.80. I’ll be honest, I hadn’t even been following Centene but have found numerous way oversold companies in the healthcare sector recently. Always looking for blood. Thanks for directing me to this one."
"investing in this company is like investing in a tobacco company. They take over state medicaid, cut services and pocket the difference. They are in Pennsylvania and taking away home health services from Severely disabled adults like my son, and many other I know."
"Wow, What an opportunity, first thing out of the gate. Will finish positive for the day."
I bought this stock on a whim that it would go up. It hasn't disappointed me.
"The market makers try so hard not to let CNC run away. At this price it is a bargain. With EPG is under 1 and the earnings growth rate is around 28-30%, it is real no brainer stock, low risk."
CNC is up 8.94% to 59.48
It is still cheap here IMO. It's just way too undervalued to remain at this 55 level so makes a good solid play.
#CVS #WBA I am not sure if this is how I share my comments on my other healthcare boards. I don't pump stocks but if you did not see Cramer last night talk about Centene please look at the video and you can determine if you should add this to your portfolio. I am already holding this but I will be adding more. GLTA and have a great day!
Soon to be back in the $70’s
"I’m holding CNC. Deal can take 2 years for full integration. Lastly, political cross currents will effect this stock but i think there’s some upside before 2020 election"
Spam sucks.
Cash flow from operation is 2.2 billions in the 1H of 2019. 4 billions projected for the year and this currently has a 18 billion market cap. Very undervalued especially if the acquisition of WellCare goes through !
The acquisition is full steam ahead and this is way undervalued. To 55 by eoy - jmo.
"Michael Bloomberg as new presidential candidate is gamechanger for managed care. News should boost stocks like Centene, Humana, Anthem and others."
bought 40 shares
It's a bargain but difficult to own.
This drop is hard to explain. Beat and raised. Did not hear the CC so maybe something said the street didn't like.They will be on with Cramer so will probably get pump this evening. I bought at $103. Thinking about picking up a little more down here. Company seems to be doing well.
I think selling was driven by news that Trillium (subsidiary of Centene) is having a hard time to secure a contract with Portland.
I’m holding until earnings. It’s going up to around 55-60.
I like the price at the moment. It's a solid company and undervalued.
Lots of bashers piling on hereGood signBuying at these levels is going to look genius within a year
I added in the pre-market at $93.70. I love when investors panic. Great company at a discount now.
Long and strong in this one! $CNC and $BNCH both promising mining companies
Sold on April 11th @56.50 stop loss triggered haven’t bought back in....any thoughts on repurchase?
I heard about CNC the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Someone is doing everything they can to get this stock lower. You have good numbers today and a buyback, stock does nothing."
Why does CNC keep dropping in the past 10 days after it reached $72?
A yahoo bot came in here and downvoted all the quality posts
Pa Health and Wellness is owned by Centene. My son is insured with them through Medicaid. They are the most dis picalble company I have ever dealt with. They are currently sweeping through our state and cutting the hours of homecare for many disabled individuals. The previous PA CEO Todd Fartha was sentenced to 3 years in prison for Medicaid fraud. I imagine there will be class action suits and INVESTIGATIONS. Do not get insurance from any company owned by Centene.
