I’m eating all I can and still the price drops
Horrifying news. Target 10.Kraft Heinz (KHC) said on Wednesday that its comparable sales in the third quarter rose 1.3% from a year earlier. The company posted higher profit and raised its expectations for the full year.
"I believe KHC and KO will be two of the great earnings surprises with the reopening sticking....watching the sport, games on TV and one look at the stadium and it's hard not to see the max crowds which impacts the stadium and grocery store $. These are companies which dominate those areas."
"Market is just not in love with Consumer cyclicals right now. Strong earnings, this should be moving closer to $40. Just gotta wait it out I guess."
"As inflation takes over, more will be eating Kraft offerings."
"According to yahoo finance data, khc has a 91%+ payout ratio. Good for dividends but bad for future growth and future operations."
Pandemic effect didn't dissipate that much at all. Good news imo.
"KHC may not provide the biggest ROI in the next few years, but I'd argue it could potentially provide the least downside risk in an overvalued market all while collecting a respectable yield as it continues to trade substantially under book value of about $41. KHC is a solid play on being fearful when others are greedy..."
"The stock makes no sense finishing on the high yesterday and today it sells off with an up market. Regardless, I'm long and strong. The company is a good inflation hedge."
I think major inflationary costs and inability to increase prices will greatly hurt all these types of companies..and rates ticking higher won’t help going forward..I saw hints at Costco marked way cheaper than Heinz showing brutal competition and Kirkland will eventually make its own ketchup..I understand kHc has many products but ketchup is king and that time may be coming to a slow death
"This is a good company and well diversified. A 5% dividend is a gift. They own and produce a very good coffee brand in Yuban coffee, better than Hills Bros, Maxwell House, Folders, even Starbucks as far as I'm concerned. Simply great coffee that sells relatively cheap in the store."
",Great earnings and Up PM."
Heard these dudes are raising prices everywhere. If you want to eat you gotta pay. Not sure if they have growth and all but they will make money unless you stop eating.
"The higher rates of obesity in Black, Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC) compared with other groups in the United States can be attributed in large part to systemic racism. BIPOC suffer chronic stress from experiencing racism in their environments, which can increase the severity of obesity. Also, BIPOC who want help losing weight have a harder time accessing health care, and when they do, they face real and perceived systemic racism within medicine. Furthermore, marginalized BIPOC are more likely to live in areas with an abundance of stores that sell unhealthy food and a lack of stores offering affordable, nutritious options. Even with access to supermarkets, processed food is usually cheaper than fruits or vegetables, and processed food companies engage in disproportionate marketing towards BIPOC."

$44 was the high..drifting sideways or lower is what I see..inflation and generic competition will destroy these kinds of companies
