JAMF is up 5.20% to 31.96
Just look at Slack now ... are we all retails and institutional waiting (wishing) for similar to happen for Jamf soon or later
Seems like going below ipo price if results not very good
"The bottom is in boys, if you think that Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan, BofA Securities and Barclays are acting as lead book-running managers for the proposed offering. RBC Capital Markets, Mizuho Securities and HSBC are acting as joint book-running managers will let this fall below the offer price of $32, you have another thing coming. This will run up to $40 in no time."
Good luck to all 
Anyone know when they are going to report earnings?
Will this company go up?
Quite a run! Lets if it more sustainable then last time
This better go up after earnings........
no momentum here
"JAFM will double in no time, check comparison between JAFM and FSLYFSLY-Market cap 10 bill, revenue 220 mil and net profit -22%JAFM has much better numbersMarket cap 4.5 bil, revenue 250 mil and net profit -14.14%Same thing happened to FSLY when it first reported and look where it now, I added more when it first reported Same thing I will be do add more JAFM and no time this will be atleast 200% upIm still holding FSLY up 400%"
This stock stuck at bottle neck 
Capitalize on This drop. Recurring revenue numbers are stellar and will be sky high in a year. People who dump this are just silly - this will be for generations to come as long as apple products are around
this is going to fly after ER
keep selling as I am buying!
Did we just get EIGHT (8) buy ratings this morning?!?!?!
JAMF reached an all time low at 31.62
Selling at $40 this stock is trash
It’s your chance to RUN .. sell as soon as you can.
"Bad day, looks like some investors are in panic sell mode. time to load on those cheap shares!"
JAMF is up 5.03% to 37.58
"Will pop after earnings, about to cash out baby"
"Sorry, i dont see the earnings miss. They met top and bottom line.. Why the stock bashing? Can someone explain this?"
JAMF is up 5.80% to 40.84
"@john You know how I know you're a amateur clown? because you are claiming to know about insider trading and S/1s when you don't know squat. Time to put you down little man once and for all -- TRY ACTUALLY READING THE S/1. I'll give you a hint: its on page 15. I guess you stopped reading after page 14? If you can actually read up to the 15th page, I'll give you a REAL challenge and tell you to read up to page 176 or at least skip ahead. Back to the kiddie pool for you little girl."
Proxy Apple play many don't seem to know about
Was selloff today (on higher volume) essentially just unlocked shares being ELIGIBLE to be sold?
Is IDIOT john aka corrupt CEO aka gif boy seriously bragging about ONE up day out of 37? lol
"@john You are such a amateur childish clown. Somebody disagrees with you and they are a troll? lol... grow up. Then again, your last argument was a gif so its to be expected. One only has to look at the block trades to know it ain't shorts. But you were too lazy to read the S/1, so why would you look at charts? Yes, I do think Jamf sucks. It's down -25% from the day 1 high, but you don't really concern your self with details like block trades and highs, so... back to gifs?"
"Lovely rise in price after earnings, I think people will soon start to realize that this is a great investment."
This will explode after earnings release.
All aboard! Let’s get this train moving now!
"I wonder if IDIOT john aka corrupt ceo aka gif boy is going to claim the 50k+ shares just dumped in 5 mins a few hours ahead of earnings is ""shorts""? Weeeee.... the corrupt ceo is on a dumping spree now... haven't seen a chart this vertical in a loooongg time."
hello
Hey IDIOT john... so? Where's your big pop on earnings? Looks red AF to me. Should have cut my losses the 1 second it popped to 43 before tanking.
I wonder when this stock will start getting more attention
JAMF is down 5.21% to 34.18
The corrupt CEO finally stopped dumping his shares?
"Can't believe how #$%$ this stock has performed since IPO in such an extremely bullish environment. Bound for a rebound sometime, probably soon. Just 4.99 points away from an oversold reading in RSI. https://schrts.co/JJFCNFVA"
IDIOT john aka the corrupt CEO aka gif guy at it again with the pump and dump. And yet another red day and another new 52 wk low. What is that 37 days in a row? #LOCKTHECEOUP
buying these dips.
JAMF is down 5.02% to 35.37
Jamf Holding is down 5.91% to 34.20
JAMF reached an all time low at 29.46
"XMET - sleeper play, DD is bullish."
"IMO, Goldman Sachs is advising them to raise as much cash as possible at these levels. Why else would you do a follow on offering?Thus, JAMF should raise the money while the market value is high. Clearly, GS likes to take the banking fee so I wouldn’t read too much into it. It’s hard to watch these stocks go theogh investment banking schemes while they build their businesses. Look at the bright side, the company that you own is better capitalized after the add on."
Haha wow the volume is so low I've never seen it this low at this time
JAMF is down 5.00% to 36.10
This is a really trash.
"premarket slow build tomorrow. 9:30 +1.2%. 11:15 tops out at +2.7% until after lunch. 12:30 to close, it will have extreme price change. flip a coin whether it goes up or down."
I believe this is a good investment but wow this stock is depressing to hold. Only going down from here for now lol
Guess the corrupt CEO is back at it... must have been at lunch at the yacht club.
JAMF is down 5.53% to 35.67
"The New Golden Apple! This is gonna be juggernaut now ahead of time! EIGHT BUY RATINGS AND UP- North America, Europe, Asia and Australia( CNBC strong buy )"
why this is bleeding?
Are we retails being played here?
"Hey look, a new closing low, 3 days before earnings. What a surprise. Where's the SEC when you need them?"
As long as apple falls this will fall as well.. expect more Red days then green until election is over. Apples new support line is under 100.
Royal Bank of Canada increased their price objective on shares of Jamf from $45.00 to $49.00 and gave the stock an “outperform” rating in a research note on Friday. Mizuho reiterated a “buy” rating and set a $45.00 price objective (up previously from $43.00) on shares of Jamf in a research note on Friday.
Now what????
JAMF reached an all time low at 34.25
"I sat with this losing me money for the last 2 weeks, sold yesterday to put into tesla.. and tesla down today. I feel like I'm in the truman show."
Yikes. new 52 week low
Earnings after hours?
"Apple devices for business are on the rise, though, and Jamf built on its 39% revenue gain in 2019 with a solid Q2 2020 report -- its first since it made its high-flying debut in July -- led by a 42% year-over-year gain in its SaaS segment (which was 85% of total revenue). Annual recurring revenue, the yearly value of all subscription-based sales, increased 36% to $241 million in Q2."
JAMF is ready to jump
"Back down to under $32 we go, never fails to deliver…jeez!"
$50 says IDIOT john aka gif boy aka corrupt CEO never shows his face around here again... -10%.
Don’t understand this tanking? Report was decent
Crazy this has been dropping....when it should be closely correlated to Apple’s rise.
an after hours poopy dump is coming when the earnings misses reported
Time to unload again....
nice after hours gain
"It refuses to go up, good thing I own Tesla haha..."
this thing is like sleepy joe in his basement
JAMF is down 6.53% to 34.35
#$%$ just happened? Jamf got some shady stuff going on. Selling next time it's over 37
No seriously.. what is going on with this beast. Why all this pull back. Don’t expected on a good ER. Though I am all the way long but it just ￼ surprise me. Any real reason ?
When is earnings?
#$%$y stock still alive... get out of this poor company.. if you like Apple then buy Apple SP.. get out there is nothing here for you.
I think it’s a good stock for long term... a slow steady climb
downtrend
Relaaaaax! It will be green by lunchtime tomorrow. Lock up isn't until 1/17/21!
Down she goes
Lots of insider sells in sec4 filings lately
why its dropping？Is it possible to +40??
JAMF is down 5.63% to 28.18
Jamf Holding is up 5.03% to 33.00
JAMF is up 5.61% to 37.30
Get out ASAP .. this is trash. I hold it for 3-4 months and only going down. I jumped out of this sinking ship 10 days ago and never look back. ￼
"Goldman Sachs Adjusts Price Target for Jamf Holding to $52 From $47, Maintains Buy Rating"
@john the clown... Yup... mighty impressive stock. -10% in 2 days on no news and green markets heading into earnings. Gee... I wonder which way those'll go.
What happened to IDIOT john aka corrupt ceo aka gif boy... +2 to red INSTANTLY and nose diving now. Yup. This is all on the up and up for sure lol...
I can’t believe that there is still some people hold this junk. God bless you. ￼
Sell if you can‘t handle it.... otherwise you will be rewarded big time!
"This one is indeed a painful journey for investors. However, from the macroscopic perspective, I think ‘hope’ still exists given the below reasons ...(1) Almost 90% institutional ownership (ie. these are professionals who went through sufficient research & analysis before committing their positions)(2) Vista just sold another 10M shares at $32 few weeks ago where the majority of these shares go to other institutions (ie. the demand is still there, and their expected gain from it should be much higher than this price)(3) There could be 2 reasons for such institutional interest - either they buy into the growth story of this company, and/or waiting for a buyout much like Slack?!(4) The earning reports are getting better and its forward guidance beat the street’s estimatesThe dropping in these few days are perhaps mostly due to the casualty of claiming tax lost for the year."
Everything but this up today...
"Extreme low volume today, still only 5 figures after few hours ... weird"
JAMF is up 6.07% to 33.89
Best kept secret opening up
JAMF is down 5.40% to 34.50
"this appears to be good, but the actual volume is dismal"
Looks like this will be hitting 20’s before the ER. I am not sure ER will be that great given the big boys in the FANG stock pumped their numbers with lower EPS to beat the numbers and the crooked TEsla and APPLE doing the split to remain above water and stay contenders. This will be dropping next week so fast given there is no stimulus until September. Glad did not buy this at 38-39 and i would sell if you in this. Total garbage. When insiders sell you need to get out fast .
buy now while it's on sale...20% discount from high
Earnings report on march 4th
I got in when it was $37 
How should I interpret the recent 8.5M shares being sold? They still have to determine the final public offering price - I see future growth but may not be a good time to buy now.
Jamf Holding Corp is up 5.57% to 34.67
I hope everybody has loaded up properly. This will never see 30 levels again!
Nice bump up today
@john -- You should really learn how ipos and insider selling works before bashing somebody who actually does. Lockups and SEC filings are for CEOs & insiders that play by the rules. You don't think there is a way around it? Lol... you're naive kid. Happens every day. Like for example... the CEO just hides his shares under somebody elses name? Yeah... who would have ever thought of that?
what? no body got any trash to talk today? 40.70-Monday.41.93- Tuesday????? - Wednesday43.20- Friday
Bought in today. Good revenue growth that's they claim will exceed analyst benchmarks for Q2 and the year. Good market for their business. Employee ratings show they like working here. Lots of positives. Let's hope they can rein in on expenses and turn a profit soon.
Any reason why Apple won’t acquire JAMF ?
JAMF is down 5.14% to 32.70
"-9%, but IDIOT john promised us a big pop!!! He posted a gif of a snail with a jet engine on it!! LIAR!!!"
JAMF is down 5.93% to 37.75
"Volume on this stock is low. Once Wall Street ""discovers"" this stock (a strong earnings report would do), its got a chance to take serious flight."
here she goes! 50 tomorrow!
Worse than watching paint dry. I’m losing money every day holding this. What is going on here?
"I can kind of see this company do well in the near future. Although, they are directly competing with Apple, some people would prefer to deal with a “little guy” rather than the “monster”, simply because of supporting small businesses. Apple is huge as it is and not adding extra 10 or 20 customers doesn’t make a difference on its bottom line but for JAMF, it’s a growth opportunity. With well run customer service and word of mouth, the company has a chance to be one of the leaders in support for Apple products."
I wonder when it will close at 40
"40% YoY increase in recurring revenue, raising guidance for 2020, strategic acquisitions, 18.6 million Apple Devices using JAMF, this is insane.."
JAMF reached an all time low at 31.00
"This stock will take some time to hit new highs. When and company goes IPO and doesn't beat their first earnings the market begins to loose faith in mgt. On top of that ""certain parties"" sold shares recently.. Never a good sign when early investors sell when the stock is on the way down.. If Jamf beats their numbers this quarter we should see an uptick and if more analysts give a buy we can see new highs by spring..."
50 day SMA just crossed the 200 day SMA! Bullish upward momentum.
Got in again. Great deal!
going to close green?
Why this one is so quiet? Come on! Move up
i just bought more
Thought we were turning around after Mon & Tues. And here comes the corrupt ceo dumping his shares again.

Price/sales is only 13 for this 30%+ yoy high growth company and almost all revenue is from ARR ... it’s a screaming buy now
The financials on JAMF website look very impressive for 2020.
JAMF is down 6.71% to 34.10
calm down folks... it's just happy little pullback
It closed at 40! Cool
JAMF is down 9.42% to 37.30
JAMF is down 6.89% to 35.02
Here we go again…I predicted under $32 before earnings…now inching under $30… after earnings any prediction on price?
This stock seems to have a hard time gaining momentum to get above 40. Part of the issue is insider selling. This happened when they first went public and again just after the most recent earnings. For this stock to get above 45 it will need loyal investors and a C suite who is loyal to the investors.
I was expecting apple’s run would affect this stock. Guess I was wrong again
What if MSFT buys this?
Terrible stock. Stay away!
Such a frustrating stock. Used the upside from last week to get out of this junk!!
well these last 2 day could have been a total disaster but its at least held during the selloff. Dont think we are going to get huge returns anytime soon but at least feel better holding this now than I did last week.
why it is dropping?
Holding for many years.
Under 30 boys

Time for a few green days in a row. Let's see it get back to $33 plus.

"Nice earnings! Great company, this is just the beginning!"
"If you think Apple will continue to be successful with enterprise customers (think businesses and schools), then JAMF will be a good investment - the stock closed strongly on Friday, on its high of the day and over the last month it has traded much better - i'm a long term investor and like what i see"
"LAST chance to load up... good earnings, bigger contracts and partnerships, potential acquisition."
Nice
does this thing ever go up?
too much fake news here. need a decent er and this can easily go to 50
"It should be a bullish stock, just a matter of time!"

@S sooo... still think the corrupt CEO isn't dumping shares?
"Frankly speaking this is one of the most pathetic stock to own currently ... But provided almost 90% institutional ownership and big names like BlackRock, Vanguard, Tiger Global, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, etc. etc. are holding it, don’t think these professionals just happened to have an impulse buy though ... really puzzling the real thesis behind it or any hidden agenda that we retails don’t have a clue yet"
MM's took out stop-loss'
Woah what happened here? Is this just running with Apple earnings? I am a bag holder with an average of 37.5(quit buying the dips and paying attention until earnings) should I take the small loss now or is there hope for this to get past 40 after earnings?
Well there you have it folks... an instant $2 drop a few hours before earnings... talk about corruption.
"thank goodness my set purchase price didn't trigger today. Otherwise, I would have been at least 15-20% when this will open at $35.75 and drop to intraday low of $31.50"
I thought that the earnings report was excellent. AMZN made a huge investment in safety equipment. The stock missed its number last quarter and yet the stock skyrocketed.JAMF is very well positioned to make a major long term run. I don’t think that it will be long before we see $45.00 per share.
"surprised it didn't drop intraday low of $33 as I was expecting. Nevertheless, it will be in the high $20s in coming weeks due to global market pullback"
JAMF is up 5.79% to 31.24
"Still got long ways to go as it's gone down for such a long time, but it showed that it definitely isn't a 29 dollar stock."
JAMF reached an all time low at 32.20
no more legs SELL SELL
JAMF a steal at this mornings prices. ER beats and someone shakes the tree to scare weak hands. Shame!
Oh .. this garbage company still a live.. you have wasted your time and money in this JAMF Scam where everyone is making money  you make nothing. Sell this ￼ garbage and find a real company. Just imagine if you invest the same amount at the same time in Apple .. not in a company that may have some benefit from Apple. Let it go .. you are holding a fire ball that no one want to touch. ￼
"The lockup period has probably expired. Those who bought at IPO price (not sure what that was, but lower than it opened on day 1 of trading) now can sell their shares at a profit. That will drive the price down, temporarily at least."
What is going on with this stock... it just keeps going DOWN!
Is this ever going up?
JAMF is up 7.15% to 37.00
This will rally for the coming days…
