"IMO, Goldman Sachs is advising them to raise as much cash as possible at these levels. Why else would you do a follow on offering?Thus, JAMF should raise the money while the market value is high. Clearly, GS likes to take the banking fee so I wouldn’t read too much into it. It’s hard to watch these stocks go theogh investment banking schemes while they build their businesses. Look at the bright side, the company that you own is better capitalized after the add on."
This better go up after earnings........
Time to unload again....
Woah what happened here? Is this just running with Apple earnings? I am a bag holder with an average of 37.5(quit buying the dips and paying attention until earnings) should I take the small loss now or is there hope for this to get past 40 after earnings?
Thought we were turning around after Mon & Tues. And here comes the corrupt ceo dumping his shares again.
Best kept secret opening up
Is IDIOT john aka corrupt CEO aka gif boy seriously bragging about ONE up day out of 37? lol
Loaded up at 30ish. No brainer here!
JAMF reached an all time low at 30.40
"Will pop after earnings, about to cash out baby"
"I sat with this losing me money for the last 2 weeks, sold yesterday to put into tesla.. and tesla down today. I feel like I'm in the truman show."
This stock seems to have a hard time gaining momentum to get above 40. Part of the issue is insider selling. This happened when they first went public and again just after the most recent earnings. For this stock to get above 45 it will need loyal investors and a C suite who is loyal to the investors.
"surprised it didn't drop intraday low of $33 as I was expecting. Nevertheless, it will be in the high $20s in coming weeks due to global market pullback"
hello
"Volume on this stock is low. Once Wall Street ""discovers"" this stock (a strong earnings report would do), its got a chance to take serious flight."
Some are sneaking in just before earnings. i see you!
JAMF is up 5.74% to 36.10
#$%$ just happened? Jamf got some shady stuff going on. Selling next time it's over 37
buying these dips.
"Sorry, i dont see the earnings miss. They met top and bottom line.. Why the stock bashing? Can someone explain this?"
Lots of insider sells in sec4 filings lately
Did we just get EIGHT (8) buy ratings this morning?!?!?!
JAMF is down 6.75% to 32.33
Crazy this has been dropping....when it should be closely correlated to Apple’s rise.
"2021-01-22 10:13:50 2021-01-19JAMF Jamf Holding Corp. Hager Dean Chief Exec Officer, Dir S - Sale+OE $33.65 -115,971 23,557 -83% -$3,902,042"
Don’t understand this tanking? Report was decent
I am really suspicious about this stock outlook 
"I can kind of see this company do well in the near future. Although, they are directly competing with Apple, some people would prefer to deal with a “little guy” rather than the “monster”, simply because of supporting small businesses. Apple is huge as it is and not adding extra 10 or 20 customers doesn’t make a difference on its bottom line but for JAMF, it’s a growth opportunity. With well run customer service and word of mouth, the company has a chance to be one of the leaders in support for Apple products."
too much fake news here. need a decent er and this can easily go to 50
JAMF is down 6.45% to 36.10
calm down folks... it's just happy little pullback
JAMF reached an all time low at 32.20
downtrend
"@john You are such a amateur childish clown. Somebody disagrees with you and they are a troll? lol... grow up. Then again, your last argument was a gif so its to be expected. One only has to look at the block trades to know it ain't shorts. But you were too lazy to read the S/1, so why would you look at charts? Yes, I do think Jamf sucks. It's down -25% from the day 1 high, but you don't really concern your self with details like block trades and highs, so... back to gifs?"
100 @ 35.00 today.... a little bit at a time
JAMF is up 5.26% to 30.63
Oh .. this garbage company still a live.. you have wasted your time and money in this JAMF Scam where everyone is making money  you make nothing. Sell this ￼ garbage and find a real company. Just imagine if you invest the same amount at the same time in Apple .. not in a company that may have some benefit from Apple. Let it go .. you are holding a fire ball that no one want to touch. ￼
Holding for many years.
Have to stay long on this to really profit
why its dropping？Is it possible to +40??
Worse than watching paint dry. I’m losing money every day holding this. What is going on here?
How should I interpret the recent 8.5M shares being sold? They still have to determine the final public offering price - I see future growth but may not be a good time to buy now.
Jamf Holding Corp is up 5.57% to 34.67
JAMF is down 6.71% to 34.10
Can someone tell me why I should hold this dog? Really don’t get it
Will this company go up?
i just bought more
This is a rock solid company. Awesome long time investment. Also thanks to Apples great new Mac Lineup
Pure manipulation whatsoever
Guess the corrupt CEO is back at it... must have been at lunch at the yacht club.
JAMF is down 9.42% to 37.30
JAMF is down 6.53% to 34.35
Was selloff today (on higher volume) essentially just unlocked shares being ELIGIBLE to be sold?
Capitalize on This drop. Recurring revenue numbers are stellar and will be sky high in a year. People who dump this are just silly - this will be for generations to come as long as apple products are around
Why is this up?
I think it’s a good stock for long term... a slow steady climb
Will jamf manage AppleCar??? Rises on no news in a red market. Suspicious
JAMF is up 6.07% to 33.89
"40% YoY increase in recurring revenue, raising guidance for 2020, strategic acquisitions, 18.6 million Apple Devices using JAMF, this is insane.."
"JAMF provides enterprise and security functionality for Apple products for use in business, education and government."

Pretty much the only tech stock that has tanked on earnings. IDIOT john the corrupt CEO must be so proud.
What happened to IDIOT john aka corrupt ceo aka gif boy... +2 to red INSTANTLY and nose diving now. Yup. This is all on the up and up for sure lol...
When is earnings?
This is about to strike back    congrats to everybody that stayed or got in!
"Hey IDIOT john aka the corrupt CEO what happened to your ""strong support"" at 37.75? can you tell your equally corrupt wife to stop selling please?"
This will rally for the coming days…
JAMF a steal at this mornings prices. ER beats and someone shakes the tree to scare weak hands. Shame!
JAMF is down 5.40% to 34.50
About to pop…
why it is dropping?
"Frankly speaking this is one of the most pathetic stock to own currently ... But provided almost 90% institutional ownership and big names like BlackRock, Vanguard, Tiger Global, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, etc. etc. are holding it, don’t think these professionals just happened to have an impulse buy though ... really puzzling the real thesis behind it or any hidden agenda that we retails don’t have a clue yet"
no more legs SELL SELL
"Still got long ways to go as it's gone down for such a long time, but it showed that it definitely isn't a 29 dollar stock."
Here we go again…I predicted under $32 before earnings…now inching under $30… after earnings any prediction on price?
JAMF is down 5.93% to 37.75
What is going on with this stock... it just keeps going DOWN!
Any reason why Apple won’t acquire JAMF ?
Yikes. new 52 week low
Sell if you can‘t handle it.... otherwise you will be rewarded big time!
this is going to fly after ER
Everything but this up today...
I wonder when this stock will start getting more attention
JAMF is up 5.61% to 37.30
MM's took out stop-loss'
$JAMF Target Raised by RBC Capital Outperform USD 45 » USD 49 Target Raised by Mizuho Securities Buy USD 43 » USD 45
Check out XMET - sooner rather than later!
Noooo go back up 5 pct
The corrupt CEO finally stopped dumping his shares?
"if your average cost is already below $35.50, buy as much as you can to average down. if it's above $35.50, you should have sold last week..."
Relaaaaax! It will be green by lunchtime tomorrow. Lock up isn't until 1/17/21!
"this appears to be good, but the actual volume is dismal"
going to close green?
I wonder when it will close at 40
Get out ASAP .. this is trash. I hold it for 3-4 months and only going down. I jumped out of this sinking ship 10 days ago and never look back. ￼
no momentum here
"Apple devices for business are on the rise, though, and Jamf built on its 39% revenue gain in 2019 with a solid Q2 2020 report -- its first since it made its high-flying debut in July -- led by a 42% year-over-year gain in its SaaS segment (which was 85% of total revenue). Annual recurring revenue, the yearly value of all subscription-based sales, increased 36% to $241 million in Q2."
Nice bump up today
JAMF reached an all time low at 31.62
"The bottom is in boys, if you think that Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan, BofA Securities and Barclays are acting as lead book-running managers for the proposed offering. RBC Capital Markets, Mizuho Securities and HSBC are acting as joint book-running managers will let this fall below the offer price of $32, you have another thing coming. This will run up to $40 in no time."
"premarket slow build tomorrow. 9:30 +1.2%. 11:15 tops out at +2.7% until after lunch. 12:30 to close, it will have extreme price change. flip a coin whether it goes up or down."
#$%$y stock still alive... get out of this poor company.. if you like Apple then buy Apple SP.. get out there is nothing here for you.
JAMF is up 5.79% to 31.24
50 day SMA just crossed the 200 day SMA! Bullish upward momentum.
@john -- You should really learn how ipos and insider selling works before bashing somebody who actually does. Lockups and SEC filings are for CEOs & insiders that play by the rules. You don't think there is a way around it? Lol... you're naive kid. Happens every day. Like for example... the CEO just hides his shares under somebody elses name? Yeah... who would have ever thought of that?
Down she goes
Just look at Slack now ... are we all retails and institutional waiting (wishing) for similar to happen for Jamf soon or later
Now what????
Jamf Holding is up 5.62% to 35.72
Why this one is so quiet? Come on! Move up
what? no body got any trash to talk today? 40.70-Monday.41.93- Tuesday????? - Wednesday43.20- Friday
are we there yet?
nice after hours gain
JAMF is down 5.53% to 35.67
"This stock has >90% institutional ownership, is it good or bad?!"
does this thing ever go up?
JAMF is ready to jump
JAMF is down 5.63% to 28.18
It’s your chance to RUN .. sell as soon as you can.
I can’t believe that there is still some people hold this junk. God bless you. ￼
"LAST chance to load up... good earnings, bigger contracts and partnerships, potential acquisition."
Ohhhh.... NOW I get it... IDIOT John *IS* the corrupt CEO.
Seems doing good even on an insider unlocked day. Hope its healthy fundamental will play out from now on.
this thing is like sleepy joe in his basement
I was expecting apple’s run would affect this stock. Guess I was wrong again
I got in when it was $37 
"This stock will take some time to hit new highs. When and company goes IPO and doesn't beat their first earnings the market begins to loose faith in mgt. On top of that ""certain parties"" sold shares recently.. Never a good sign when early investors sell when the stock is on the way down.. If Jamf beats their numbers this quarter we should see an uptick and if more analysts give a buy we can see new highs by spring..."
Wow up 4 percent now down 1 percent. Sad
why this is bleeding?
@john the clown... Yup... mighty impressive stock. -10% in 2 days on no news and green markets heading into earnings. Gee... I wonder which way those'll go.
$50 says IDIOT john aka gif boy aka corrupt CEO never shows his face around here again... -10%.
As long as apple falls this will fall as well.. expect more Red days then green until election is over. Apples new support line is under 100.
This will explode after earnings release.
I believe this is a good investment but wow this stock is depressing to hold. Only going down from here for now lol
"Goldman Sachs Adjusts Price Target for Jamf Holding to $52 From $47, Maintains Buy Rating"
Terrible stock. Stay away!
Well there you have it folks... an instant $2 drop a few hours before earnings... talk about corruption.
Under 30 boys

keep selling as I am buying!

Outstanding ER. Up from here on.
I think Jamf has met the resistance line. Time to buy buy buy!
Wait... this was green today? Odd
JAMF is down 8.65% to 28.82
IDIOT john aka the corrupt CEO aka gif guy at it again with the pump and dump. And yet another red day and another new 52 wk low. What is that 37 days in a row? #LOCKTHECEOUP
Anyone know how this management system works for Apple ?
"I wonder if IDIOT john aka corrupt ceo aka gif boy is going to claim the 50k+ shares just dumped in 5 mins a few hours ahead of earnings is ""shorts""? Weeeee.... the corrupt ceo is on a dumping spree now... haven't seen a chart this vertical in a loooongg time."
JAMF is down 5.02% to 35.37

Selling at $40 this stock is trash
Seems like going below ipo price if results not very good
It closed at 40! Cool

Good earnings
JAMF is up 5.61% to 35.69
Price/sales is only 13 for this 30%+ yoy high growth company and almost all revenue is from ARR ... it’s a screaming buy now
JAMF is up 5.80% to 40.84
"XMET - sleeper play, DD is bullish."
"If you think Apple will continue to be successful with enterprise customers (think businesses and schools), then JAMF will be a good investment - the stock closed strongly on Friday, on its high of the day and over the last month it has traded much better - i'm a long term investor and like what i see"
Wow. Everything in my portfolio is down today except JAMF. I’m shook.
"This one is indeed a painful journey for investors. However, from the macroscopic perspective, I think ‘hope’ still exists given the below reasons ...(1) Almost 90% institutional ownership (ie. these are professionals who went through sufficient research & analysis before committing their positions)(2) Vista just sold another 10M shares at $32 few weeks ago where the majority of these shares go to other institutions (ie. the demand is still there, and their expected gain from it should be much higher than this price)(3) There could be 2 reasons for such institutional interest - either they buy into the growth story of this company, and/or waiting for a buyout much like Slack?!(4) The earning reports are getting better and its forward guidance beat the street’s estimatesThe dropping in these few days are perhaps mostly due to the casualty of claiming tax lost for the year."
35.- by next week.
buy now while it's on sale...20% discount from high
"If you like them Apples (I do), you should like JAMF."
Haha wow the volume is so low I've never seen it this low at this time
this is my absolute worse stock I own. bought in low 40's thinking it was going to 60 in short order. I don't get this drag because the company is making $.

"@john You know how I know you're a amateur clown? because you are claiming to know about insider trading and S/1s when you don't know squat. Time to put you down little man once and for all -- TRY ACTUALLY READING THE S/1. I'll give you a hint: its on page 15. I guess you stopped reading after page 14? If you can actually read up to the 15th page, I'll give you a REAL challenge and tell you to read up to page 176 or at least skip ahead. Back to the kiddie pool for you little girl."
Nice

JAMF is rocking in revenue.
Jamf Holding is up 5.03% to 33.00
Going to touch $40+ soon
Anyone know when they are going to report earnings?
Looks like this will be hitting 20’s before the ER. I am not sure ER will be that great given the big boys in the FANG stock pumped their numbers with lower EPS to beat the numbers and the crooked TEsla and APPLE doing the split to remain above water and stay contenders. This will be dropping next week so fast given there is no stimulus until September. Glad did not buy this at 38-39 and i would sell if you in this. Total garbage. When insiders sell you need to get out fast .

here she goes! 50 tomorrow!
well these last 2 day could have been a total disaster but its at least held during the selloff. Dont think we are going to get huge returns anytime soon but at least feel better holding this now than I did last week.
Time for a few green days in a row. Let's see it get back to $33 plus.
The financials on JAMF website look very impressive for 2020.
Proxy Apple play many don't seem to know about
Buy few stocks at closing. Will add more if it drops but I think we will be back to 40s shortly. 
"Extreme low volume today, still only 5 figures after few hours ... weird"
JAMF is up 5.03% to 37.58
I bought hoping this will get to $100 in 12 months. so far big disappointment
Earnings after hours?
Bought in today. Good revenue growth that's they claim will exceed analyst benchmarks for Q2 and the year. Good market for their business. Employee ratings show they like working here. Lots of positives. Let's hope they can rein in on expenses and turn a profit soon.
JAMF is up 5.20% to 31.96

A software company that works with Apple which is at ATH is dropping before earnings... hmmm 
JAMF is down 6.85% to 34.15
"The lockup period has probably expired. Those who bought at IPO price (not sure what that was, but lower than it opened on day 1 of trading) now can sell their shares at a profit. That will drive the price down, temporarily at least."
I thought that the earnings report was excellent. AMZN made a huge investment in safety equipment. The stock missed its number last quarter and yet the stock skyrocketed.JAMF is very well positioned to make a major long term run. I don’t think that it will be long before we see $45.00 per share.
