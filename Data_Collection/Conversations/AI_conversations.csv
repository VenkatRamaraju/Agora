buyer @$25 and it will come
"i wouldnt consider insiders constantly selling as ""fine"". nor would i think a stock that goes down 75 percent and hedge funds pulling out as ""fine"". if this is true by what you say what would consider ""not fine"""
"options expiring, you’ll see this hit $50 by friday I bet"
lots of bottom fishing now...congratsbubgetting the lows on the way to 100
Time for Independent to buy more. 
is this 100 yet?
Nice price action on a day the market is up big ……………..
"For the people who are so upset by the insider selling and let's face facts, all longs would rather see it stop rather than continue, long term what would you expect the insider position to be? Currently, it is just under 16%, of the five hundred companies that make up the S and P 500, only fifteen companies sport insider positions at 15% or higher and most of them are just slightly above that level. Agree that when insiders sell, more inventory is on the market and the Keynesian theory of supply and demand do dictate that all other things held constant, higher supply means lower prices, so not good for longs, but what level do you honestly believe it should be at?"
it wants to be green
You can measure the amount of concern for both bears and bulls on this board. It directly correlates with the length of their posts
starting look like aol:)
"Maybe, I made a mistake buying this. Should I sell it and buy a different software company like PLTR or, SNOW?"
"@C3-BS, appears I have been censored by Pravda, however, I am here monitoring the constant daily excuses.my attractive associates continue to advise me of any new creative excuses, lately they have been the same ones used for nine months now.."
"Why would we care if you think this stock is ""done for now"", or that ""30's are coming""... Sell your shares and don't be bothered, go somewhere else. I'm here because I think this company has a lot of potential, this market is crazy right now, so don't judge a stock by the overall market performance. We're pretty much at the all time low, so it will most likely go up from here. HOLD, HOLD, HOLD and don't sell your shares, that'll just make it worse for everybody else..."
"HEY, CHIEF GARGLE ON THESE walNUTS."
"Hands down, the best presentation I have seen Siebel do yet. His spirits seemed very upbeat. This will take time as I always say but the future is very promising. Besides the tech stocks getting hammered, I will continue to dollar cost average here and if it goes lower."
the a nos have it
If C3.ai stopped advertising on CNBC they would turn a profit! Holy moly. There's a commercial every hour!
"Oh you are so right, Paul. Did I mention that the Titanic ROCKS too!"
"Someone told that someone who has long since been muted called me a pumper and I predicted 100+ and 176. Truthfully I don’t remember this, but I’ll back up the allegations now. I am long and bullish on this company. I do believe it will reach 100-176 and even higher. But that is in 2-5 years. I also believe we will be able to look back at this in 6-9 months and see where the bottom landed. Short term I am looking at a narrow trading band until next ER with a slight upward drift. Call it pumping if you like. This is my opinion and I hope some find it interesting while others find it irritating. This is just the C3.AI entertainment channel after all."
AI should be at least $65.00 by now
"Does anyone else think it is a issue that The CEO, CTO, and directors sell substantial amounts of stock every month regardless that the stock price is down about 70% from all time highs?"
First 30 min. I see some sizeable blocks being purchased. Maybe we are finally inching our way back up. Slow and steady wins this race longer term.
"Looks like the manipulators at the funds are using their algorithms again, they will take it red by end of day, they will drive it back to the IPO price is their goal. They have to frustrate enough retail investors to get them to let go of their shares so they can buy them up and accumulate enough shares, so they can pump the price and make serious bank, so until then they will work on driving the price lower."
AI rocks!!
"I can guarantee this makes a run to $55-60 in next two weeks, good luck"

"Oil's up. At least a few oil companies use AI tech. Baker Hughes (GE), Shell, etc."
Management needs to stop selling. How about start buying!
"A great presentation as always by Tom Siebel today. It really comes down to this: Either Tom Siebel is a fraud or he is not. Considering his track record and his accomplishments, I will say that he is not. If everything goes the way he predicts (which is no reason why it shouldn't), this company will be HUGE. Only a matter of time when the money flowing in, does show it as a growth company. Question is when will that time be? I think very soon (a quarter or two). But again, I will give it the 5 year time frame as I do not believe this company will go belly up and keep adding at depressed levels."
"Google is reducing the amount of revenue it keeps when customers buy from other vendors on its cloud marketplace, as the top tech companies face increasing pressure to lower their so-called take rates. The Google Cloud Platform is cutting its percentage revenue share to 3% from 20%.At the start of this month, Google and C3 announced a partnership in which the Google global sales team will sell C3 AI's enterprise AI applications, running on Google Cloud. So as I understand it, the Google percentage share of the revenue is now down, and the C3 percentage share is up."
I loaded up some more and love it at this price
"I have said this before and I will say it again. I have seen these software stocks IPO, go way up and tank or stay flat for a year or two. They slowly begin to grow into their evaluations and then skyrocket! The list is endless really. IMO $40s is a gift and this time I STOCKED up literally for the long haul here. Siebel is a beast and everything he has touched that I know of, has turned to gold."
The weak hands have finally left the building. It’s now just us and the shorts. Bring it on.
"Wells Fargo is out with a note on Thursday: ""We still expect some short term noise in stocks, but ultimately we think equities will melt up into year end as the worst of Covid/Delta is behind us.""In the April-May-June quarter, Wells Fargo bought 12,000 shares of AI, and ended the quarter with a relatively small position of 41,000 shares. My feeling is that the Google partnership will result in more buying by institutional investors in the future."
"AI is the reason you buy msft and apple. lulu at 58P/E, all of these companies are manipulated, SPACs are a joke. I should be lucky I'm only down $11k on AI. Learned my lesson"
"wow, Pravda hasn't deleted my posts yet today........What's going on here???"
"Gaurav Mallik, the Chief Portfolio Strategist at State Street, was on Squawk Box on CNBC on Friday. He said State Street remains very overweight in equities. They see the economy starting to pick up and they like growth stocks right now. State Street is investing in long term trends such as digitization.In the April-May-June quarter, State Street more than doubled their position in C3 with a buy of 173,000 shares. I think that with the Google partnership, investors like State Street will continue to add to their positions in C3."
whatever im out!
"Damaged pipeline near Orange County should be a good news for us. If they utilized C3Ai , it could have been prevented"
i just got a personal loan...if i dilute my share price then it wont look like i lost so much
I am positive that this stock will be valued at $100.00 a share or more one year from now.
Jeff brown. Brownstone. Says it’s the best stock. I hope so!
a picture says a thousand words
Why isn’t this company already in 100+ what is holding it back
"That's why I said the stock should going down $20. Siebel is too old,and the company growth too slow can't hold $50+ price"
"Alicia Levine, the market strategist at BNY Mellon, was on Bloomberg - The Close on Thursday. She sees economic growth picking up heading into 2022 and believes that the market will close 2021 higher than where it is now. In the April-May-June quarter BNY Mellon more than doubled their position in C3 with a buy of 40,000 shares. I expect institutional buying to pick up as more investors realize what the Google deal will mean for C3."
"Goldman Sachs economist Jan Hatzius has lowered his forecast for US economic growth. To a certain extent this is negative for all US stocks, but for a growth company like C3 this change in the outlook has its positive aspects. Unlike a company like Walmart or Boeing, growth at C3 can mostly continue regardless of what is happening in the economy, so a lower growth outlook could cause some money to shift from cyclicals like Walmart to growth stocks like C3.Although Goldman has lowered its economic forecast, the firm's Chief Equity Strategist David Kostin is maintaining his year end forecast for the S&P of 4,700. Goldman bought 208,000 shares of C3 in the April-May-June quarter, and ended the quarter owning a total of 591,000 shares. If Goldman is expecting a shift from cyclicals to growth, then it's likely that they will continue to buy C3."
"I'm a bull. I've been following this company and their tech long before they IPOed. When the price shot up after the IPO, I knew that was an unsustainable and unrealistic speculative event, so I sat on my hands. As Warren Buffet says "" in the short term, the market is a voting machine, in the long term, it is a weighing machine."" I think the next increase up to triple digits will be of the weighing machine variety and over the next 2 years or so. I got in on the way down at $55 and $50, but with a long term holding strategy."
AI is so dead someone need bury this dead stock. Even CEO don’t believe in his company lol.
Small holding here and got out early 50s. So disillusioned list interest and do jot even bother checking anymore on daily basis.

"AI slowly continues to lower... to what I suspect will be a 3 handle soon enough. CEO, CTO, BOD, Directors continue to dump. Some commenters hype execs 10b5-1 plans. Get real... some folks may be aware of their existence (virtually all finance coursework covers it -- old news)... but don't understand how they can be structured / changed. That's right, execs can change their plans at will... correct, at will... if they attest they don't currently have material information driving their change. Need one say more... really!Reality is execs continue to believe AI sp remains too high... and they KNOW what they're doing... unlike 90% of retail investors who don't... nor fully comprehend the technical services they provide. I think there will be a much better entry point with a 3 handle... at which time I may well invest. Keep an eye on execs... who yep... it's a miracle, will believe the company is undervalued and modify their yep... 10b5-1 plans to acquire. There are many names for this... execs choose -- capitalism."

"We are treated to a rambling , disjointed, incoherent pseudo economic analysis ; bordering on the bizarre. Regardless of what you think of the causes of inflation (some would point the finger at prolonged near zero interest rates); I was presenting one point. When interest rates begin to recover towards normal- stocks/companies like C3.ai (start-up/ no earnings/ no dividends/ no proven, necessary product/ no moat) are the first to be sold. It may not go much lower, but it won't be $85 by Earnings/Pearl Harbor Day. Newest wrinkle in the ""shell game"" with C3. Almost bragging about the failed Stock Price; as a debating tool; when we were all promised in the summer it was headed toward the skies. Always- an excuse."
"And to think I owned this when it was $184/share, I deserve my $10k loss for not selling then."

Bought at $75 . Story ends it’s going lower and lower everyday. No bottom
"Good morning my friends. As promised, I am posting a message at 9:44 today and another one tomorrow to announce:- today / a handle change to Chief Wahoo 2021.

And- My first post as Chief Wahoo tomorrow will include my next “call” a la QUAD QUAD which NAILED a 40% collapse of AI from 75 to 44.44.Hail Chief Wahoo. BIG CALL this time tomorrow,,"
Green during a red Nasdaq is a strong sign for AI.
insiders are still dumping tons of shares. its like legal robbery
100 is realistic
It was green for a minute then farted
In market correction this goes to 20s now it’s 30s there is too much competition now and coming for ai to hold this type of valuation. My alert jist went off to buy this again. I’ll pass
Stay strong! If it goes under 40 im considering to sell half of my positions and add more c3ai and just come back in 5 years
Ai equals ilose my money

"I’m trying a finger in this now. 1,000 snares current price. Got it back cheaper then I sold. I wanna see what happens."
"Honestly it is very frustrating that the company seems to be in a position to really start ratcheting up true growth and proving their products to the world... but the insiders keep dumping shares.I hope they stop selling at some point, and they just planned to sell like half their positions following the lock up or something.I got in at $52 and I'm surprised by the continued drop. Worried I will have to hold through the $30's, and God forbid, possibly the $20s. FML."
"This stock is not SAFE until Siebel & CO stop selling their millions of share on the open market. $1,318,378,169 worth of stock and counting in just 6 months after the IPO lockup passed. Shorts are shorting this stock right along with the inside-sellers. It's why it never gets a break, and every rally in this company is sold-into.See: https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1577526.htmAI could be the greatest company ever, but if Siebel and Friends drown the market with supply, it's never going to go up. The shorts can see that too. At $46-49/share WHO HAS MADE ANY MONEY IN THIS STOCK AS AN INVESTOR? NOBODY, except Siebel and Company, and the 14% short interest that rides their insider-sell orders down with them."
"Highlight from the Deutsche Bank Virtual Technology ConferenceMost of the AI projects underway in the world right now are ""science experiments"". C3 is the exception to this. C3 technology is way, way, way beyond a science experiment. For example, Royal Dutch Shell is applying C3 AI technology across the entire company. C3's top line revenue growth is acceleratingThey now have 4,000 Google salespeople selling C3 products worldwide - this increases the reach of their marketing organization by one or two orders of magnitude. Through this partnership they will close some business this quarter, and by next year it will be pretty significant.Over the last several years, the C3 sales cycle has decreased from 17 months to 4.5 months. The sales pipeline is getting longer and the sales cycle is getting shorter, the ecosystem is getting larger, the number of large production applications is growing quite rapidly. They hope to become THE leader in enterprise AI, they're sure they will be at least a leader.In 5 years they believe the addressable market will be a third of a trillion dollars."
"Amy Wu Silverman, a strategist at RBC, was on Bloomberg-The Close on Thursday. She closely follows the options market, and she said that she's been seeing some really large trades betting on further upside for stocks through year end. RBC has been building up a small position in C3. In the April-May-June quarter, they bought 10,000 shares, and they were holding around 20,000 shares as of June 30. I personally think that the Google deal will cause some investors who have had small positions in C3 to take much larger positions."
Speculation never pays off ..
"DOD will be next. Missile Defense Agency (MDA) had to clear the contract with DOD prior to award. DOD must stand up to China's AI. $1B in cash, the best AI enterprise!"

"13F forms for the July-Aug-Sept quarter will be filed with the SEC by institutional investors over the next month. The Caprock Group, which has $1b under management in Boise, has filed already. They had a small position in C3 on June 30, then they came in during the quarter and bought 88,000 shares, making C3 one of their larger holdings. They have more money invested in C3 than in Netflix, Cisco, Salesforce, or Nike. You can't tell from the filing exactly when they bought their shares, but my guess would be after the Google partnership was announced at the start of Sept. I personally think that this partnership is going to be a game changer for C3 and I wouldn't be surprised if Caprock agrees."
"Hey Chief- do remember a guy in this Conversation, who said inflation in the economy is not real, and would be of little consequence; and would not affect the Markets, at all. It appears he may have missed this one. If the Fed responds with a rate rise, stocks like C3 will be in trouble. Who was that? Wish he would explain what happens now- and makes it brief."
Sitting on 52k potential loss if I sold today. This is my worse investment in 30+ years!
I'm looking at my current $13k unrealized loss as a reminder not to invest in these spac's and hyped IPO's. Hopefully it pops back up over the next few years. Don't chase these stocks.... stick with the big and proven names or index etf's

Would love for someone to ask Siebel what his exit strategy is? Every smart business person should have one. Good to see us slowly comeback. Let's hope the bottom has been set now.

"Scott Wren, Wells Fargo's market strategist, was on Bloomberg - The Close on Tuesday. He's recommending to Wells Fargo clients that they buy the dip in the market that we've had over the last few weeks. He's predicting the market will move higher between now and the end of 2022. He's expecting good economic growth, and he thinks inflation will moderate in 2022. He's telling clients that they should continue to have exposure to growth stocks like those in technology. Wells Fargo owned 41,000 shares of C3 as of June 30, including 12,000 shares that they bought in the second quarter. There was some institutional buying on Tuesday morning, including one large block that traded a few minutes before 10am. Who knows, maybe Wells Fargo is increasing their position in the stock."

"Seriously when I hear someone say that this company is a scam, I wonder if they are also flat-earthers. What Siebel and team have done at C3.ai is nothing short of phenomenal. Sooner or later the factors keeping the share price down must correct. (1) I think there are other platforms and business built out on them that already ensconced in this space that are trying to figure out if partnering with C3.ai will enhance what they already do (and clearly it will) or just make their customers realize that they don't really need them now that C3 has a superior software solution that doesn't require expensive teams of gunslingers from the world of coding. (2) Clearly insider sales need to run out, though I'm convinced the sales are not because they don't believe in the company but because they can to make bank now as well as later. The fact that large numbers of shares are still held by insiders and institutional entities means they are in for the long haul. Most indexes down again today, but AI up -- clearly some folks watched the B of A interview with Siebel and came away like I did that AI really does have the goods and hopefully not far from the rest of the world knowing it."

"Hey Independent, remember some guy who lives in his Depends who pretends he's talking to different people meanwhile it is always himself? He thinks that inflation will for some reason disproportionately impact a stock that it only ten percent higher than its original IPO price and half of its original debut public price. Meanwhile, its primary customers are all in heavy commodity markets which can easily pass costs on to consumers and thereby not being negatively impacted by higher inflation. Furthermore, all of the issues that are driving inflation are applications within the c3 portfolio to help address. Whether it be supply chain issues, reliability issues, cyber fraud, manpower issues, line balancing, process control optimization, all things that help mitigate the ""inflationary pressures"". Which most of them can be traced back to this person's favorite person in the world, Uncle Joe in the White House."
"The majority of Wall St strategists are remaining bullish today. Bernstein is out with a note today: ""US markets rallied into the close on Monday, suggesting that investors are already seeing this as an opportunity to add to equity positions against a backdrop of current strong earnings and economic growth.""Fundstrats's Tom Lee is saying today, ""We believe stocks will soon be bought hard."" Chris Senyek at Wolfe Research: ""It's likely to be a very bumpy ride, but we're buying the dip.""And David Kostin at Goldman Sachs has reiterated his year end target for the S&P of 4,700. Speaking of Goldman Sachs, in the April-May-June quarter, Goldman bought 208,000 shares of AI, and ended the quarter owning a total of 591,000 shares. They obviously like the stock, and there's no reason why they wouldn't still be buying in the current quarter."

I heard about AI the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Jonathon Golub, the strategist at Credit Suisse, was on Closing Bell on CNBC on Thursday. He's got a target for the S&P of 4,600 for the end of 2021, and 5,000 for the end of 2022.On March 31, Credit Suisse owned 300,000 shares of C3. Between then and June 30, they bought a million more shares, so I'd say that this is one of the stocks that they expect to take the market higher."

"Changes to or Termination of Rule 10b5‐1 PlansCan a Rule 10b5‐1 plan be modified?While amendments to Rule 10b5‐1 plans are permitted as long as the modifier does not possess material non‐public information at the time of the modification and meets all of the elements required at the inception of the plan, modifications should be avoided because they create the perception that the person is manipulating the plan to benefit from material non‐public information, jeopardizing the good faith element and the availability of the affirmative defense. As a result, Rule 10b5‐1 plans should be modified rarely and should be designed to prevent the need for amendment. See “Best Practices to Consider for Rule 10b5‐1 Plans.”Can a Rule 10b5‐1 plan be suspended?Voluntary suspension of a Rule 10b5‐1 plan should be avoided. The affirmative defense will be unavailable if it appears that the person trading under the plan is exerting subsequent influence over the plan, so such persons should not be permitted to suspend and reinstate trading. In addition, suspension of a Rule 10b5‐1 plan can lead to the same issues as modification of a plan: it may appear that the plan is being manipulated, jeopardizing the good faith element and the availability of the affirmative defense.

"Just for many on here that complain or are worried that insiders are selling their stock--Here is a peak at one insider's selling. He is exercising his options and selling for ENOURMOUS profit. This article shows that he is getting shares at 1.86 dollars per share. Now selling those shares --Usually 15 thousand a month or 30000 thousand shares a month. Now you do the math at his profit. He also has a TON more shares that he owns--so only a fool would not be selling to enjoy the high life.Therefore, don't let those that keep saying that insiders do not believe in company and are selling.

"David Kostin, Goldman Sach's strategist, was on Squawk on the Street on CNBC on Thursday. His 2022 S&P target is 4,900, so he's predicting around a 10% increase in the stock market over the next 14-15 months. He thinks software is a good sector to invest in right now, because it doesn't have the problems that other industries such as manufacturing and retailing are having right now with supply chain disruptions. He thinks software has 15-30% upside at this time.As of June 30, Goldman owned close to 600,000 shares of C3, so they like the stock. Goldman will be filing their 13F with the SEC sometime in the next month, so it will be interesting to see if they buy any more shares."

it looks like tom started with about 16.5 million shares and now has 7.8 million left. thats awful. hes also selling the usual 33 million bucks per month on auto sell. i dont get how you can sustain this.

On Tech Check on CNBC on Thursday, CNBC reporter Jon Fortt stated that the last time he interviewed Kurian, Kurian stated that he was moving Google Cloud towards an industry led strategy based on trying to provide industry specific AI driven solutions in order to gain market share more quickly.With 10% market share in the second quarter, Google trails well behind market leader Amazon, with 33%, and Microsoft, with 20%. It has made progress, though, since Kurian took over in late 2018. Google had only about 7% share as of the fourth quarter of 2018.Now, Kurian is shaking up Google Cloud’s engineering organization in order to focus on selling industry specific AI driven solutions. I think this is going to be huge for C3 - a game changer that will take C3 sales to a whole new level."
shortest bull market ever
"Just a tougher time in the market right now. Nibbled at Ai again here. To me its a long term gift, to most of you it seems like it's the end. Siebel is a beast and 1 billion cash with a technology that can be used with most everything. Only takes one piece of news to turn this around."
Again C3 insiders are selling unfortunately
Evil shorts
"I jist got another alert for ai! Lol that’s all it was, I set a new one. Pole back in the water. 30s coming"
I don’t see this company can help the world. We can live without. This stock is probably worth $10 or less
"UBS is out with a note today: ""Equity market sentiment was hurt by a combination of worries over growth, central bank policy, fast rising yields, and the US fiscal impasse. But we believe such concerns are overdone, and we expect the rally to resume.""In the April-May-June quarter, UBS more than doubled its position in C3 with a buy of 61,000 shares. They like the stock, and will most likely buy more since they expect the market to rally here."
Next alert is 45.25 this is not a good buy right now
"History repeats itself, and people that panic will always end up losing the most. I'm holding 500 shares at an avg price of $50. Will I sell, yes when it hits $100 I'll sell a chunk. Will I buy more if it dips 15-20% from my avg? Yes, without a doubt. $AI is the future and I'm not missing the boat on this one. GLTA all longs!"
What to do now ? Sell or hold maybe one day tech will rally again. ?
Keep waiting Tom boy dump his shares again. Feel like insiders the next sell time come in soon.
what up BTC... ??? Myself and my assistant have missed you..
"—Soon it’ll be time for the Shorts to change their name(s), sorry, their ”handle” -again and go long. And for the investors: $77+ soon."
Driving the price down to set up for a large volume buy at the close.
Here is a Fact. Someone predicted C3.ai would reach $85 by Sept. 1. It is now $45. Excuses and conspiracy theories just keep flowing.
"Did that explain it well enough for you Mr. Depends? I know it is most likely you will mark my post as inappropriate to get it taken down because you really can't refute anything that I said which is also your typical mode of operation. Inflation is still being driven mostly by poor judgement on the part of the current administration and ultimately by supply chain issues, none of that has changed. The thing that you need to be worried about and again it will not impact companies like c3 as much as your ""chip"" stocks is a faltering economy. Thanks to these supply chain issues, vaccine mandates and other draconian liberal policies, the work force participation rate will continue to collapse as it has in the past year since the elections, I predict that by the time Uncle Joe gets run out of office we shall see a participation rate below 60% and it will be sustained, not just a one time blip as we saw during the draconian economic shutdowns. Companies will not be able to sell products because they will not be able to make products due to labor shortages, these companies will be losing huge sums of revenue and this will lead to the first supply based recession in the history of modern economics. It won't be demand driven though demand will also longer term be impacted as American consumerism will change dramatically as more single income families chose to home school, though that will not create this upcoming recession, though it will dramatically elongate it."
One of the most awful charts out there.
This baby is starting to Rock!A rock star in the making!AI Rocks!!
"only day traders here, this is going to take forever to hit my target"
—Looks like I’ll be buyin’ tomorrow. -Great!
All in or nah ?
Why is this stock intentionally being held down??!
"Mr. Independent (Indi-Pendi) You have called me a ""Short"". I cannot thank you enough for your confidence in, admiration for, and worship of- Me. It is heartwarming. Because - if true, ( I am ""selling short"" shares of C3.ai) during the year 2021 than I have performed very well, and enriched myself, to the detriment of the C3 stockholders, who have seen the stock price steadily fall, with few interruptions. I wish I was as cool and savvy as you think I am. I generally just buy stock in great companies, and hang on. Thanks, for your support. I will try to do better."
Had this in December out Feb. What a diaster!!This and qs. Wow
"Hello Easties....so the big news of the week was the arrival of Chief Wahoo. Welcome Chief. Love your call of Quad Tres based upon ""margin compression"". Let's see how that is reflected in the stock between now and the next Quarterly Losses Call."
Next alert is 44-45.00 low 45s and that’s just to get my attention on it again. It’s wayyy to over valued I almost burned myself again on this ine wow
Time to head back to $50s
Siebel getting pretty old that should also be factored into price. This should be at 20$.
"As we approach the 4th quarter, Wall St strategists are becoming more bullish. UBS is out with a note today: ""Overall we think this is a good environment for equities."" Bank of America is out with a note today: TINA (There Is No Alternative) remains a compelling argument for investors to buy stocks."" JP Morgan is out with a note today: ""So far, the S&P 500 index is holding above 4420-4435 support. We believe the index will hold that support and rally in Q4."" In the April-May-June quarter, UBS more than doubled their position in AI with a buy of 61,000 shares. Bank of America bought 41,000 shares, and owned a total of 234,000 shares as of June 30. I think institutional investors will continue to buy in Q4, especially as the importance of the new partnership with Google becomes more apparent."
"Raymond et al: As of 9/30/2021 Caprock has 101,850 shares of AI. And when I see highly respected entities like Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, Dow Chemical, B of A, Citigroup and many others holding sizeable positions in C3.ai, it puts more perspective on my personal investment beyond the simplistic ""Tommy boy is a scammer"" and ""timber"" etc. One would imagine, I mean I'm just saying, that international players like these just might have done the kind of DD that made them invest millions in AI. I remember when so many on boards like this one were calling doom and gloom on the likes of Marvel (which Disney bought at what is now a steal) and even Apple. Some of these same wads now act like they weren't naysayers. I hold 2530 shares of AI and from the beginning I assumed this was a long term investment that would take some time to be profitable. Whadaya know. A new disruptive tech company that takes a while to be profitable. Who woulda thought? All the best to longs."
"Good morning Easties. I got up early this morning to hear the BTC news. So as it turns out, I gotta get up early again tomorrow to hear his forecast. Come on man, don't play with me. I still can't believe that you called QUAD QUAD at 75 and then it closed at QUAD QUAD today. How'd you pull that one off???? I'm impressed and anxious to hear what you have to say in a few hours."
I wonder if c3ai software can predict where AI stock price will be next year
I can't believe this stock still below $50!The freaking CEO sold millions of shares in the last breakout.
maybe the commercial frequency should be increased. every 30 minutes on all the business channels is not getting the message across...
"So, will it be a buy at $35 or should one wait for the $20's? Only going to make 50-60 cents a share next year. $20 a share is still a P/E over 30."
UPST better AI?
$30’s are coming
An old tech dog doing new tech and selling shares along the way...I sure hope that my contrarian bet does not make me a bag holder.
"Come on guys, give it a rest. The whole market is unstable, patience... hold, hold, hold "
Insiders STOP SELLING
No surprise. Remember RED is Shaggy and Indy’s FAVORITE COLOR!!
"Looks like Tom boy should come here listen the dreamers said"" hold"",""don't selling"", I think those dreamers bought a lot his shares from $180,Lol"
this is one of those stocks where if i sell it it will go up and if i hold it..itll consolidate for 3 yrs
"SNOW has p/s of 108, and it is holding up very well. As inflation increases, corporations paying higher wages but still can't find workers. Costco, FedEx, Amazon all have profit margin down. The future will depend more on AI for sure"
"AI and AFRM were two hot stocks few months ago. now looks AFRM is the favorite, not long ago, analyst were worry about the defaults in the consumer loans and downgraded AFRM"
"so, you people who are picking on the ones who are invested in this company, are you shorting C3 AI? or just here to build your ego by bringing others down to your level? see thing is, those who are invested won't just pack up and leave when the share price is going down like you do when it goes up. if you have no skin in the game, what are you doing with your lousy life's? yes, negativity is a lousy life. you get off on putting others down sitting behind a screen. I feel very sorry for people like you. it saddens me to no end. you have a guy here calling himself God for Pete's sake. the mental issues I see is frightening."
Google and AI= True Love!AI Rocks!
"To ""da moon baby""....""ready for launch, Capn' Seibel""....76+...116+...""Here we go""...""we need more volume""...""insider selling""...""wait until earnings""...""shorts are manipulating"".....yadda, yadda, yadda...."
This is almost dead company now.
CPO Behzadi Houman sold 15887 share $43.76 on 10/04/21. Insider keep selling.
Interesting …. I see the first three posts…. All of them project a 3 handle. The fourth through sixth are from suffering investors and the seventh is more BS from Indy. Big picture - people are increasingly seeing that Emperor Tommy has no clothes. PGO (Pumpers Get Out)!!!
"You guys all overlook the market. High growth and tech are pretty much all getting hammered. This one falls into that category. If you believe in Siebel and the long term story, then this is a gift. Market always comes back."
120$ stock to lame stock
Identifying signatures- using #AI - we can identify and predict who will respond to certain therapies in certain classes around 87%+ accuracy. Can also identify who will respond to next-gen therapies. @Agenus_Bio @jbuell01
"y’all overreacting, or just bots. We fine"
"CFO David Barter sold 170333 shares,$45.04 on 10/12,insiders non stop selling."
Setting the stage for Tom's 10b5-1 outing this month.
"A new low - no surprise. In fact, I’m surprised that anyone is surprised. Those of us who have been begging innocent victims for months now to not drink the pumpers poison KoolAid expected this and more. We were criticized, attacked, cajoled… for simply stating the obvious - AI the industry has promise; AI the company is a FRAUD. The self-proclaimed “experts” are shameless pumpers who have cited every lame excuse in the book to explain the felonious theories like “you don’t have a loss until you sell” and “see you at 76++, 176+++…We need BTC’s clairvoyance and funny GIFs back here ASAP!"
it closed good at least..but a lot of headwinds...just not a lot ofnbuyers here i guess with all the other stuff to buy..but if they start increasing sales shouldnturn around..see u at 100
"The director House Patricia sold 46000 shares $49.5 on 09/23, If insiders non stop selling shares, don't believe the dreamers said something, only insiders know the fact."
Maybe they should use their AI to figure how to get the stock price higher. Love the ads on tv!
Should have gone into upstart another ai price rocketed since start of year. Learnt my lesson start small. I see that multibagging but c3ai hard to gauge if not already making large earnings.
"Hello all of my children. This is a special celestial announcement brought to you by the Holy Spirit. As the noon hour approaches, we all stand in anticipation of deja vous - the second coming if you will of.....QUAD QUAD. Will we once again cross that magic level? Will BTC come back to us in celebration of that glorious call for QQ when the stock was at 75? Will the pumpers finally capitulate, confess their sins and be forgiven? Keep those prayers coming my flock. Amen!"
We need to hire PLTR sales people
Oversold. Look for some upward movement next couple of days unless market tanks.
ok ok 20 bucks by the end?
"Chief says - beware the Ides of October- and I'm getting a little nervous. It is 10/15 on the Roman calendar. Hope we don't give up all the huge gains of the past week. I already caught a falling knife, when I bought this thing."
"the re-gift that keeps on taking....76+....116+......to the moon baby, ready for launch, 5,4,3,2,1.....oops.wrong way Cap'n Siebel....we're already down, supposed to go up.....what, call Bernie..? He's dead ain't he, or at least in jail...C3-AI-PONZI, oh ok, we got cha..."
Yeah the volume tells me somebody is getting a bit bored hold that thought
"A good presentation today by Tom Siebel at the Bank of America Digital Energy Forum. A replay of the presentation is available in the C3 investor relations website.For the Oil & gas industry, C3 aggregates all of their data sources - subsuface data, ERP data, telemetry from all of their devices, offshore oil rigs, pipelines, refineries, commodity prices - C3 software processes all of this data as it arrives through machine learning modelsExamples of usesAI based predictive maintence for devices on offshore oil rigs - can predict device failure with very high level of accuracySame thing in a refinery - production optimization - predict failure and replace device beforehandA company the size of Shell is getting annual economic benefit of $3-5 billion per year from using C3 software - they're using 100 different C3 applications - this is a massive digital transformationC3 software is based on ""model driven architecture"". They have the patents on use of model driven architecture for data aggregation, for enterprise AI, for analytics, and for data presentationThey're just getting started with their partnership with Baker Hughes - lots of future potential - One example is LNG - Baker Hughes is strong in that marketMy thoughts - C3 has the patents on use of model driven architecture for data aggregation, for enterprise AI, for analytics, and for data presentation. They're in an extremely strong position as oil and gas, and the entire world, uses more and more artificial intelligence."
"It takes a lot of time to program, implement, test, de-bug, test, revise, test, de-bug such AI driven applications. Due to Sarbox rules you can only book revenues for new project once the customers signs an acceptance form. Also, recurring revenues occur after such periods (e.g. license fee, subscription fee, etc.).Looking forward to reading the upcoming ER's after so many new BIG customers and now also having Google's sales team onboard!"
Would be nice if insiders had faith in the company and quit selling their shares at prices below $50
is it 100 yet
What’s wrong with this stock? Is it going to 70 or going to 30?
The sky is falling. It is time to go shopping.
I think the stock chart will eventually look like Affirm Holdings (AFRM). There isn't even many shares held by management anymore that could drive it down if sold so I don't believe this short sellers thesis. Watch the stock gap up.
"Underwhelming article by Stavros Georgiadis. I was waiting for great analysis behind the charge that AI has ""a severely flawed business model"" and what is the analysis? The common knowledge that the company is not yet profitable and has a 22 P/E. By this reckoning, many companies would fit this analysis and turn people away from past start ups like AMZN or AAPL or GOOG all of which went through their initial stages of lack of profitability, high valuation and cash burn. Nothing speaks like profitability and I have no doubt that it's coming and I am going to exercise patience for an incredibly promising disruptive company in the AI space -- the kind of patience that rewarded early buyers of say AMZN. The question is does C3.ai have the goods to expand market share in the emerging AI enterprise space. I'm banking on Yes."
"hey guys, yeah im all in. this stock is fine. sarcastic"
"There are people saying that you should only invest in big established companies one of them recommends Nvidia. What happens to TSMC, the primary contract manufacturing company that supplies Nvidia and AMD if China decides to invade Taiwan? We know Sleepy Joe won't stop them."
"I can understand peoples' frustration. I am down $20 from my buy, and holding a sizeable chunk of shares. I did not take as big a hit because I did not learn about AI until after the exuberance following the IPO when techs like this were drawing a lot of buys and I think many of those were FOMO buys because the CEO was blunt that AI was not profitable yet and likely would not be for two to three years post IPO. But clearly the upside potential is enormous here as witnessed by the stellar partnerships and growing customer base. The CRM stream alone can be massive. About the price? Yeah, insiders have been selling but not because they do not believe in the company but to cash in, and who wouldn't in their shoes? Bummer for retail shareholders and I'm with you there. But I am a firm believer in what this company has to offer. When selling stops and customer base grows, this will give strong returns to investors. In some ways C3.ai software could become to enterprise AI what Photoshop became to graphics editing. Anyway, it's an encouraging sign that when the S&P, Dow, and Nasdaq are all down, C3.ai is up nicely. All the best for brighter days."
"Continuous commercials on cnbc, press releases coming out on a daily basis about new partnerships and stock cannot move. Sold Unity software to purchase AI, great investment NOT..."
And it's red!
Hey Joe. Someone can read all the posts if they don’t log in. That someone happened to be my wife. Too funny 
"76..???-----116..???? @Ind-impotent, you really are FOS..."
You only need to know one thing - accumulate. You will be rewarded immensely.
boat load incoming
Just got a price alert. I’m throwing it back in the water. Looking for 39s
Eva research came with underweight. I guess time to let go this
"—I don’t care if it goes to $44 again -or lower. I do care that I’m golfing today. I bought again in the $44’s and I’ll buy again there, below there if it goes there and I don’t care where it goes -short term. Don’t care -is the theme Vanilla if you were feeling confused again. Have a good day everyone!"
All-time low volume on weekly. Turn around is imminent.
"well, my latest posts have been deleted again, so I must say Thanks to GOD, VTH, GJ, BTC and others I may have missed....The msg's have been passed and the truth be known, even for a little while....Good luck, until we post again...Taxpayer....aka, Prime Minister"
What a way to close the day...Quad-Quad.....day before Chief Wahoo's 2021 announcement.....
All in
"@independent, let'sget a few things strait here...I was the one that lost money, no-one else caused me to. I like others got caught up in the hype and joined in and yes we lost our shirts...I am not blaming others and never have. I do call those out that continue to exclaim, 76+....116+....ready to launch, to the moon baby....I say to all of that BS. So you can get off your high horse and stop making exclamations of and to others that you know nothing about. And beieve me, you really don't know JACK....and bless you in closing...TAXPAYER.."
"First I'd like to say how nice it is when you have all the annoying characters here muted. 2nd I'd like to mention that to think this stock will run to the moon yet is unrealistic. Siebel even stated they will have some lumpy quarters for a bit, hence part of the reason you can buy the stock in the 40's. Lots of other software names did the exact same thing the first year or two after they IPO'd. I have listed numerous names so I won't need to do that again. Price predictions are a waste of time. With the right news and patience, I do feel long term this could be an enormous payoff. Siebel knows exactly what he is doing and I would doubt that he doesn't already have an exit strategy. Siebel=Master of unmet needs in the software industry."
with 74 million float when the upgrades come which they will this stock will fly up
Has this board gotten quiet or did I finally block all the annoying characters?
I see they re-released some news about Google and potential upside. Don’t suppose that has anything to do with Tommy’s auto sales coming up.
"Today is the type of day we want to see often. Very strong (large blocks) buying so far! key word, so far and the market is looking better."
up .56 cents down 4 dollars...means bad
