"Paul Reilly, the CEO of Raymond James, was on Power Lunch on CNBC on Friday. Their business has been going well. They're adding more investment advisors, and the ones they already have are adding more clients and bringing in more money from existing clients.Raymond James has been building a position in C3. In the April-May-June quarter they bought 34,000 shares, which roughly doubled their ownership of the stock. As the company brings in more investment assets, I think it's likely that their ownership of the stock will continue to increase."
"This is the worst stock in the market, the market is historically high but it is at the hitorical low."
"All time low volume 2 days in a row. Robots are running out of available shares. Leaving no more easy profit on the table by dictating insane price action. Most logical conclusion is to 180 and now burn capitulated shareholders and existing shorts rallying hard. Add the fact there are massive technical divergences with other indicators recently spiking, is a signal that the accumulation has been persistent and turnout imminent."
Anyone else think that last bit of price action was a bit strange
"Google is out with their quarterly results:MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. – October 26, 2021 – Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet and Google, said: “Five years ago, I laid out our vision to become an AI-first company. This quarter’s results show how our investments there are enabling us to build more helpful products for people and our partners.********************************************************So Google is now an AI-first company. Obviously this is fantastic news for C3. The entire Google sales team is now out there selling C3 products."
"Well I see some mysterious force has deleted my answer to rgp1234. So let me post it again for everyone to see. First, its too early to predict what will happen two weeks out from the earnings call since the next twenty-five days will set up the big money moves. If the money boys drive the price up to the mid seventies, even the mid sixties, it will be vastly different than if the price is still in the low fifties. If it does what I suspect, it goes to the 65-75 range by mid November, the big money will drop the price going into earnings rather than drive it up. They will be setting it up for a major jump after the earnings call. Everything that they did for the previous three calls will be the opposite this time. Raise the price several weeks out from earnings, tank the price going into earnings (may even be new all time low), then after earnings regardless of the numbers blow it out of the water, possibly even back to late February numbers. Whenever small investors begin to believe they can predict the action of the big money moves, the big money changes those moves."
Management needs to re-think their strategy on potential clients...large fish are nice but small ones are what keeps you fed otherwise this is thing is going to lag behind other AI companies and badly which it is currently doing.
Big buy orders showing up. Commence the November 50% pre-earnings run-up. :)
"S & P 500- 11 year performance (2009- 2019) (rounded) %- +26/ +15/ +2/ +16/ +32/ +13/ +1/+12/+21/ -4/ +31. Don't know who was responsible- but you had to be trying extra hard to not make a bunch during that period. One way to accomplish a negative return; is to load up on a stock(s) with no earnings; and valued at Price to Sales. May work out, but the stress is tremendous. Everyone should consider an Index Fund as part of their plan."
"A company with $3b under management called La Financiere on the Avenue D'Iena in Paris has filed their 13F for the July-Aug-Sept quarter. During the quarter they bought 102,000 shares of C3, and as of Sept 30 they owned a total of 428,000 shares. This is a large position for this company. They have more money invested in C3 than in JP Morgan, J&J, or Nike. A nice vote of confidence for C3."

$25 I buy
Any idea why this move?
"Mohamed El-Erian, the Chief Economist at Allianz, was on Squawk Box on CNBC on Monday morning. He's got some concerns about the stock market right now, supply chain issues and upcoming tightening of monetary policy, but overall he's comfortable with stocks right now, mostly because there really is no alternative to stocks at this time. As he put it, ""You can't replace something with nothing.""In the April-May-June quarter, Allianz bought nearly 3m shares of C3, and they were holding close to 4m shares as of June 30. They'll be filing their 13F for Q3 sometime in the next few weeks. It will be interesting to see if they bought even more shares in Q3."
"David Kostin, the strategist at Goldman Sachs, was on Bloomberg Markets this morning. We're halfway through Q3 earnings and he said it's been excellent - he's considering raising his targets for the stock market for year end and for 2022. He said investors are looking for companies that have good long term growth prospects, which is mostly in technology.In the April-May-June quarter, Goldman bought 208,000 shares of C3, and they owned a total of 571,000 shares as of June 30. This is a company with excellent long term growth prospects, so it wouldn't be a surprise if Goldman was buying more shares now."
"—I’m responding due to Vanilla deleting (typical) his “I’m making money/Sorry you were left behind” post. And pay attention wannabe Shorts. I still own and have owned for years: Google, Berkshire, PayPal, Facebook, BABA and now AI @ $48. I did sell 11 including: Disney, Apple, WFC, GE, F, Delta, GM, Twilio, NIO, Halliburton and Pinterest (due to market correction -coming). I’ll buy back *then and add. So, I’m fine. I have zero debt, I don’t need any money and own several properties (paid in full) including my house. I’ve bought a few stocks that were “too cheap” to me: SKLZ @ $8.71 and $8.07, etc. for shorter term. I’m in AI *long term. $176+ long."
Is this correct? 17% short interest for AI?
"come on people, patience! Pretty much the whole market is red today, chill "
This should run before earnings.
