"BIG ER tonight!I like this company a lot because they are undervalued for their growth potential and I am very bullish on semis... plus we get the added bonus of the robotics, which should be great in a few years."
Pointed out on cnbc...... increased production by 40% and training of ee's from 10days to 2. WOW
"Wow, a 10 cent dividend on a $110+ share. Does my grandma run the show?"
Tepid Q4 will take the stock down tomorrow
"Quick to take a beating, Ter. is trading below its all time high from the year 2000"

"You'd think this company could throw investors a bone here and raise the dividend just a little bit, lol. I realize it isn't a dividend stock but geez 0% divi growth over a year now."
"Thanks to TER! Keep it going, dividend bump would be nice, as someone else mentioned. Very best ATE and well managed. New highs will be coming in a few months."
"Are You Looking for a Top Momentum Pick? Why Teradyne (TER) is a Great Choicehttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-170005768.htmlBottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that TER is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Teradyne on your short list."
Just keep this for 20 years and you'll be happy about that decision.
"ARK's purchase of TER shares continues - about another 50K today. ARKQ 02/5/2021 Buy TER 880770102 TERADYNE INC 49,277 0.1818On Monday, there will be a summary news release on ARK's purchases over the prior week. I believe for the first week in February it will state that ARK's largest share purchase for that week was in Teradyne. That can only help the share price as there are many investors that try in part to mirror the moves made by Cathie Wood at ARK Investments."
"worrisome pattern, Ter is experiencing lower highs for the last 4 mos. as follows:all time high 147then comes 140 and dropping then comes 135 and dropping then comes 130 and dropping then come 124 and droppingyesterday 123today 120much different behavior by Amat and Lam"
We sell components to TER and their forecast is the stongest I have seen it. Why the price decline? Anyone know much about their margins?
"TER is my pick for next Pure Earnings play. Sometime tomorrow I will be going Long with almost all of my available hard capital, to hold the stock specifically through earnings release tomorrow AH. I am expecting an excellent earnings report, and I think the stock price will react by popping to the upside. I think a 5-8% move up is very possible, as long as both EPS and Revenue beats consensus, and Guidance is in-line or raised higher. This company has an OUTSTANDING history of consensus beats, and the stock generally reacts well to these beats. Valuation, especially for a tech stock, is reasonable. Feeling very bullish about this play, but of course I could be totally wrong, so do your own Due Diligence and research! Best of Luck to All. :-)"
"Ter. is always under attack as soon as a small gain is achieved, it happened on Fridays yesterday and today.You can not deny it the sentiment is BEARISH!"
Info on Yahoo shows only 164MM shares outstanding and Citadel is not listed as a major holder.
"May be stating the obvious here, but Teradyne's customers include AMD, Broadcom, Intel, Marvell, Nvidia, Qualcomm and TSMC, all of which are experiencing major supply constraints. Expanding capacity = more semiconductor test equipment. Great near term prospects with a long term collaborative robot kicker. Plus a $2B stock buyback program. I'm in. I've been adding shares all week."
"Beat on top and bottom line even while Industrial Automation shipments were delayed by supply chain issues. Good quarter , let’s see how tomorrow’s conference call goes. Will be a Green Day tomorrow."
"Looks like a really good report, but I will believe a good price bump is coming when I see it…."
"Always believed in the company, always will!!!!!!!!"
"let's see, we've had several consistent surprise Beats on earnings, we hit our 52-week high today during Trading, and its 10% above the one-year Target. Where is the well deserved Applause and upgrade from the analysts?"
Teradyne is up 5.63% to 130.00
"Surprise upside earnings for the last several quarters, with glowing forecasts. No evidence that this trend will change. This is a very well-run company with outstanding products."
"Great GUIDANCE EVER !Teradyne +8% after beats, upside outlookJan. 22, 2020 5:13 PM ET|About: Teradyne, Inc.

Today growing because of Intel's announcement on significant capex expansion over next 3 years. Confirms growth for WFE market in 2022. $AMAT $KLAC $LRCX $ASML $TER.
among WFE companies this one has given one of the worst guidances for Q3 and growth wasn't that impressive. And why is it upgraded now by piper? Or they simply watch CNBC?
20% down over past 6 months. That’s a bear market for this stock. When does it go bullish again?
"AH activity is very bearish, somebody must something that we do not know."
"Out TER at $77.50 for a VERY nice profit on 1300 shares. Was looking for more, but when she started to drop I put in my Limit Sell and got out with a heap of Green, about $5.7k worth. Very happy to have somehow scored another big winner. :-) Hope this baby also worked out nice for some of you folks, and if so, congratulations. :-) Currently Short 6200 shares of NXGN at $15.75. They report earnings right after market close today, and I am expecting a poor earnings report, to be followed by a drop in the share price, hopefully to below $15.00 tomorrow. We shall see what happens! :-)"
"need more evidence that Ter. is out of favor ?look how the stock is behaving today, no conviction."
I opened a position in Teradyne a couple days ago. I meets every criteria I use to invest in technology and related companies. Margins are excellent as well as the ROE and ROA. The debt to equity ratio is low and cash exceeds long dated debt. The cash flow is solid and the overall growth metrics are positive. The product lines are well positioned for the present economic trends. I'm in long and will stay in this stock for awhile.
"Im 28 years old and I do believe that this stock will be in my profolio for life. Its just hard to see this company not growing in years to come. Testing electronics, semi conductors, and automation are the surest future we have in our current times."
"IMO, what we have here is a typical, prepare for the weekend selling and mm, and electronic trading which as the CEO of the NYC said yesterday....that switching to electronic trading n etc will take away the ‘human’ elements of trading n may cause some short to mid term Volatility... Funny... b/c the $VIX -Index measure of S&P Volatility actually has decreased quite a bit from it high of 80$s to around mid to high 60$s... Also, remember, the Historical crashes going back to the Great Depression , and going fwd to 1987... and the Dot Com. Crash... “911” ... and the Crash of 2008 couples with the Housing / Mortgage Swaps and Both Oil n Gold Crashing and etc ... are historical events from which a great deal has been learned from.FROM EVERY CRASH / Recession ... LEADS TO A REBOUND EVERY TIME...￼A RESPONSE ...Yes, $AMD, $TER , $SWKS... Have had their Share prices driven Down Immensely... BUT... each of the above have not issued any warnings, AS OF YET, and have excellent FWD GUIDANCE. IMO, the Tech, Semi, , IoT, SaaS, Sectors, will be least impacted . It’s not like we are talking about AUTO , RETAIL sectors, that are closing production, have a huge supply and virtually such small sales due to this epidemic.Consumers will buy The new Xbox n PlayStation Consoles and Lap Tops and server upgrades will be necessary and such infrastructures for these platforms (Software as a Service) will need updating and expansion as we realize that the efficacy of Tech actually is multifaceted - from applications n etc from ALL SECTORS, from the medical sector and etc."
"Yesterday's gain evaporated in less than 10 mts.Component shortages will hamper results and lead to a sell off tomorrow,going under 110 tomorrow"
"Up just about 10k on TER right now, that's about...3 1/2 months worth of hard manual labor for me. Oh yeh, that's the way I like it!"
"On July 29, investment advisory Susquehanna upgraded Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ: TER) stock to Positive from Neutral with a price target of $165. Mehdi Hosseini, an analyst at the firm, issued the ratings update.Out of the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Chicago-based investment firm Citadel Investment Group is a leading shareholder in Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ: TER) with 128 million shares worth more than $493 million."
Automation growing at 30%+ with no end in sight. TER in strong position to grow that even faster. Anyone who can bring proven efficiency to e-commerce can charge whatever they want in this market.
"Big Beat by INTC and the stock is jumping up now, just as I had anticipated. But I did not do the play, unfortunately... :-)"
"From past experience whenever Ter. delayed an earning report it does not bode well, this time again the report is delayed from next week to the following week. Something 'smelly' is brewing at Ter. which is already the weakest in the group so get the ready for more downside, look for the stock to settle between 95 and 100."
"This is one of the most under-rated stocks out there, it is still viewed as just another semi co, people don't realise yet that their automation business has a huge runway especially as countless industrial jobs are increasingly being filled by robots."
