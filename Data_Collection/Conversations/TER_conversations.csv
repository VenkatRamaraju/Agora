"these dividend payments is just teasing, better use this money to invest in growth"
"TER is my pick for next Pure Earnings play. Sometime tomorrow I will be going Long with almost all of my available hard capital, to hold the stock specifically through earnings release tomorrow AH. I am expecting an excellent earnings report, and I think the stock price will react by popping to the upside. I think a 5-8% move up is very possible, as long as both EPS and Revenue beats consensus, and Guidance is in-line or raised higher. This company has an OUTSTANDING history of consensus beats, and the stock generally reacts well to these beats. Valuation, especially for a tech stock, is reasonable. Feeling very bullish about this play, but of course I could be totally wrong, so do your own Due Diligence and research! Best of Luck to All. :-)"
"another surprise earnings beat, with nice guidance. moving on up!"
"bada bing bada boom! Old Faithful comes through once again. Quarter after quarter beating earnings, revenue and favorable guidance."
"Out TER at $77.50 for a VERY nice profit on 1300 shares. Was looking for more, but when she started to drop I put in my Limit Sell and got out with a heap of Green, about $5.7k worth. Very happy to have somehow scored another big winner. :-) Hope this baby also worked out nice for some of you folks, and if so, congratulations. :-) Currently Short 6200 shares of NXGN at $15.75. They report earnings right after market close today, and I am expecting a poor earnings report, to be followed by a drop in the share price, hopefully to below $15.00 tomorrow. We shall see what happens! :-)"
I bought this morning at $108...27% off the 52-week high.
"Once again, another earnings beat with sweet forward guidance! Does anyone see a pattern here? Of course that is a rhetorical question. 5G will be the Golden Goose for Teradyne, and us longs."
"nice 4Q earnings and outlook, increased dividends, future looks bright for Long's!"
Diluted EPS for TER is around 3.46 giving it a current PE of 22.71...Tesla has a forward PE of 333. Imagine if this was selling at a Tesla multiple. At $400 a share TER would be a 115 multiple as an example. Still way below Teslas but lets be conservative. Say TER traded at its growth rate of 48 with a 48 multiple. Than this stock should be selling at leat $168 a share. Can you say TER is ridiculously cheap
"Still very fairly valued. I like these kind of companies, not much news and financially very healthy:)"
"BIG ER tonight!I like this company a lot because they are undervalued for their growth potential and I am very bullish on semis... plus we get the added bonus of the robotics, which should be great in a few years."
"Teradyne, Inc. (NASDAQ: TER) reported revenue of $819 million for the third quarter of 2020 of which $592 million was in Semiconductor Test, $118 million in System Test, $41 million in Wireless Test and $69 million in Industrial Automation. GAAP net income for the third quarter was $222.7 million or $1.21 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, Teradyne’s net income in the third quarter was $205.4 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, which excluded restructuring and other charges, acquired intangible asset amortization, non-cash convertible debt interest, discrete tax adjustments and included the related tax impact on non-GAAP adjustments."
Does anybody know what happened today with TER?
"eps beat by 10% (.77 vs .70 est), rev beat by 3% (565 expected, 582 reported). up 5.6% in after hrs."
"buy now at this lower level- the short ratio is 7, so several more days of upside"
The 'shellacking' continues with additional $5 drop and maybe more unless the buyback machine gets into action.
where are the 150 bulls ?
Guidance increased to 700M for Q1 from 570M..1B share buyback proposed for 2020..easy 120 by end of year
Mute button cleans up message board nicely like a perfect picture
$10 From all time high hit over 20 years ago
Nothing more than a mini temper tantrum. This is a rock solid stock and company.
"worrisome pattern, Ter is experiencing lower highs for the last 4 mos. as follows:all time high 147then comes 140 and dropping then comes 135 and dropping then comes 130 and dropping then come 124 and droppingyesterday 123today 120much different behavior by Amat and Lam"
"Dumping, dumping , dumping and no buyers to 'scoop'."
Great Q2 guidance !
Very impressive earning and strong out look for next quarter.. expected0.70 and 0.77 per share actual ...
Unless Ter. reports 'off the charts' Q2 numbers and bullish Q3 estimates the stock will go back to trade between 120 and 125.
"This dropped because people are trading on the sentiments surrounding earnings report rather than the recognition for Teradyne’s value. The company’s strong Q2 report during this bad time shows the potential it carries and how automation is trending in their favour. Eventually, this shorts will come to their senses. LONGS on this."
Bargain price...addition to index will mean more steady buying
"Most of today's gain will be gone tomorrow, hedge funds do not like the stock.Ter. lost favor and is trailing badly 'front-end' cos. such as Amat.Today's gain will not propel it above 130, it does not have the momentum.Yesterday's CC was ho-hum. Ter. is a tired stock and will soon drift below the 120 mark.Remember one day does not make a trend, Ter. lost heavily in the prior three days."
Info on Yahoo shows only 164MM shares outstanding and Citadel is not listed as a major holder.
I opened a position in Teradyne a couple days ago. I meets every criteria I use to invest in technology and related companies. Margins are excellent as well as the ROE and ROA. The debt to equity ratio is low and cash exceeds long dated debt. The cash flow is solid and the overall growth metrics are positive. The product lines are well positioned for the present economic trends. I'm in long and will stay in this stock for awhile.
"Amazing how two stock treated completely differently.$TSLA S&P 500 inclusion hoax (Which done by fraud street very openly and yet no one even asking to inquire about clearly & perfectly coordinated stuff which not possible without billions on table by powerful group.) bring it 50% higher in just few days.$ETSY hardly moving$TER hardly moving$CTLT hardly moving.Amazing yesterday they gone solid negative as well similar to other stock. First trading day.What S&P 500 inclusion means nearly 30% of stock get brought by various different fund (14% directly by ETF /Other funds tracking S&P 500 100% accurately, Other 19% also try match S&P 500 performance but not always follow 100% so I put 30% total.)"
"To those who did not want to take the risk of buying more ahead of the earnings, know that TER always comes back to its 20-day average - ALWAYS. Now that the short-term traders have had their meal and are selling, we should be there in a few days."
Good earnings why down ?
"Surprise upside earnings for the last several quarters, with glowing forecasts. No evidence that this trend will change. This is a very well-run company with outstanding products."
Their future guidance was too low and conservative. They will have easy beats on ER. On top of that their robotics division is picking up.This is an easy buy at these levels.
Why Teradyne is down 5% after last earnings report?
"Lol , all my Long Call Options positions are down in after hours from $AMD, $MSFT, $NVDA , $BABA The $QQQ ‘s n futures are all down, esp due to the Cancellation of the MOBILE CONFERENCE- due to corona/ COVID And some positions are down due to the article mentioning the FTC will investigate patents in Google, MSFT , AAPL , AMAZON .... IMO, from reports to articles ... the CHINESE tried to keep originally keep this virus a SECRET...Arresting the original DR. in Wuhan. Also when ‘clusters’ of a virus are realized...it is ‘supposed’ to be reported...This virus is also a “NOSOCOMIAL” , meaning it will spread with hospitals or treatment centers. There is a cure. It’s realized that quarantining people together who may have the virus with people who do have the virus increases the rate of transmission! And, as of last night ,there’s also a Cruise ship that they won’t let arrive and export the passengers ... which actually increases the chance of those infected to spread to the uninfected. Also it’s stated that it may be close to reaching its peak. If this was reported BACK IN JAN ...we would be AHEAD in this outbreak if the CHINESE, didn’t silence this and the original Wuhan Dr. to discover and treat the patients, died due to being arrested , to be “silenced” .... But we are catching up. The vaccine(s) , reportedly from $GILD , GILEAD PHARMA. RUSSIA has a vaccine -for animals- that treats SARS & MERS= Corona / COVID It also can be determined by the fact that of how A great deal of CHINESE TECH stocks like $TSM and $TER , have blow out EPS and guidance n yet their stocks , among other, slowly fell. IMO, the Chinese traded on this outbreak, without the US initially knowing . GTLA"
among WFE companies this one has given one of the worst guidances for Q3 and growth wasn't that impressive. And why is it upgraded now by piper? Or they simply watch CNBC?
"Big Beat by INTC and the stock is jumping up now, just as I had anticipated. But I did not do the play, unfortunately... :-)"

"Im 28 years old and I do believe that this stock will be in my profolio for life. Its just hard to see this company not growing in years to come. Testing electronics, semi conductors, and automation are the surest future we have in our current times."
"earnings report tomorrow, July 24th. They are well known for surprise to the upside. Expecting some good news and a pop!"
We sell components to TER and their forecast is the stongest I have seen it. Why the price decline? Anyone know much about their margins?
"No upgrades as of yet, its moves are triggered mainly by hedge funds and high IBD score in the 90's.Its strategy of diversification went unappreciated for a long time and it has become 'bulky' with the last acquisition few days ago. Nevertheless it's maintaining technological prowess in the semi sector.It's all time high of $115 was reached in 1999 so we are a long way from matching it."
"If anyone think entire market isn't manipulated by very powerful peoples, Think again.We have 3 different stock ($TER, $ETSY, $CTLT) getting included to S&P 500. Also since everyone focus on Tesla Inclusion Hoax, No one likely predicted 3 stock they choose instead to replace falling behind stocks.Yes those stock are down significantly even when S&P 500 is about same level it was when announced.While Tesla which hyped 50% based on S&P 500 trading about same level. Normally without even inclusion, those stock would gone twice as much #$%$P 500 go up.So how S&P 500 nearly $11T+ tracking funds not buying any stock and why anyone selling if $11T fund need to by 30%+ stock. If they are buying already then why stock price is not going up.I can think only thing possible.Entire game was fixed way ahead, They already loaded this 3 stock and dumped Tsla to over excited crowd.So When Tesla Pull back they have enough buying power to pop again and excite crowd again (Already stole Billions and using same game to stock more billions)Given tesla now value 10 time those 3 combine company it's huge benefit they got."
As per management. In 2021 they will resume their share buyback program. (only stopped because of covid)
Just exactly what happened?
"@kelvin! I know the feeling- I’ve gone to all cash several times this year! I last about 24 hrs unless it’s a weekend... went from my all time high yesterday and all cash to buying $BA, $SDC, $PFE, $TER, $CVS, and $BMY... down .7% now... but looking to the future with those!!!"
20% down over past 6 months. That’s a bear market for this stock. When does it go bullish again?
"The profit takers are coming very quickly, Ter. can not sustain gains."

Anyone getting in before earnings next week?
Where and who are the analysts covering this. Any upgrades yet? Will they ever accept they were wrong and adjust their price target?
"New gaming systems, proliferation of 5G networks, new cycle of 5G phones and future demand and growth in the semiconductor industry will Propel this stock for the next several years. Get in while it's still cheap!"
"I own a decent sized position purchased last year in the $70's and lower $80's. I haven't purchased since, but will happily start buying again if/when we see sub-$100 prices. Interested to hear what others are thinking about Teradyne right now."

"Hard to believe that after this long rally, continued upside earnings and future strength, that no one has issued an upgrade, or even thought about raising the 1 year guidance, which has been overtaken by almost 20 points. incompetence? Or someone trying to keep a secret."

"NEVER BELIEVE in Susquehanna Bancshares ! Otherwise U 'll kill your investment in the long run.B/C big problem from Analyst Susquehanna :1) Susquehanna 's ridiculously predicting very low target for this great TER stock.2) Susquehanna 's the only one among all other Analysts predict TER so low,3) Susquehanna 's prediction not based on TER 's great earning beats ( both ESP and REVENUE) and its great outlook / guidance.. 4) Susquehanna 's prediction 's been all time at fault with lowest target ever in the past, so they have been completely nonsense and wrong !."
I find it hard to relate to the negative sentiment against this company. It has a lot going for it both in the immediate and long term. If you shorties get this pushed down I will gladly buy as I still regret missing my chance to open a position when this was in 70s not so long ago.

"if you own/like $ter check out $intt, a vendor to teradyne, a top customer of intest. while $ter trades for 6x's sales, $intt is valued at 1.5x's 2021 revs and 13.5x's 2021 eps. with a new semi cap ex cycle just beginning, all semi cap ex stocks should have multiple quarter run. $intt also has an industrial induction heating division growing strongly in the EV assembly business. assuming $intt can get to peak eps of $1.50-$1.75, the stock can rally to $25. $intt is a good small cap compliment to $ter imho."

It'd be great if these 2 companies can work together."
stock is 5 + points higher then it's 1 year estimate. Time for the analysts to give this a well-deserved upgrade.

"Today's report better be exceptional to live up to the 'run-up' in share price,"
"I think this thing is going to continue to trend up in a healthy and sustainable manner, and we will continue to be rewarded for owning this high quality stock.Also their stock buyback program is on hold and they said they are going to restart it in 2021!"
"Question from a TRADER (v. ""investor""): If you thought that TER - this morning - would NEVER reach the heights of yesterday's post-market highs (ca. 82.15) - would you have taken these yummy profits last night . . . or do you anticipate that TER will go higher over time. I guess I'm asking - Why not take huge, one day profits when you see 'em - especially due to great earnings/forecast for mid-year . . . then use these quick-gotten profits to buy back in to TER when it INEVITABLY falls after that terrific spike last night (it's ALREADY falling from last night's spike)??"
It is a opportunity to buy at dip. The future is bright for 5 years plus

I would have to say regardless of earnings that this company should see an up tick in the middle of 2019. The 5g phones will be coming out toward the end of 2019 so they will depend on TER to test the phones. Everyone will want 5g. Who wouldn't want to surf 100x faster.

"Litepoint (aka TER), just made an agreement to provide 5G test cells to Qualcomm. Between its semiconductor business, robotics division and litepoint, teradyne is poised to take off with all the 5G build-out that's starting to proliferate. Get in, if you haven't already."
Overlooked and unappreciated by the market is the benefit to Ter. the switch of Apple from Intel to a different chip. It goes as follows: Intel's microprocessors have 'zero inside' from Ter. who never penetrated this co. to become a major supplier of test equipment.Apple is going to TSM a major (top 5) customer of Ter. This new scenario offers a real shot for Ter. to land this business and this will be a real prize and within reach.
Im long on this company. Specially because of Universal Robots. 72% sales increase. Hell yeah.
"Evercore raises semi price targets, calls now a buying opportunity https://seekingalpha.com/news/3344417?source=ansh $INTC, $NVDA, $LRCX, $ASML, $TER"
Trending up in A.H.
Half of yesterday's gain vanished in pre-market.
"This was the clearest buy in the market last week, let's go go go..."
"My best stock of the year - up and steady. Great company with a great future, thanks to its diversification into automation"
"IMO, what we have here is a typical, prepare for the weekend selling and mm, and electronic trading which as the CEO of the NYC said yesterday....that switching to electronic trading n etc will take away the ‘human’ elements of trading n may cause some short to mid term Volatility... Funny... b/c the $VIX -Index measure of S&P Volatility actually has decreased quite a bit from it high of 80$s to around mid to high 60$s... Also, remember, the Historical crashes going back to the Great Depression , and going fwd to 1987... and the Dot Com. Crash... “911” ... and the Crash of 2008 couples with the Housing / Mortgage Swaps and Both Oil n Gold Crashing and etc ... are historical events from which a great deal has been learned from.FROM EVERY CRASH / Recession ... LEADS TO A REBOUND EVERY TIME...￼A RESPONSE ...Yes, $AMD, $TER , $SWKS... Have had their Share prices driven Down Immensely... BUT... each of the above have not issued any warnings, AS OF YET, and have excellent FWD GUIDANCE. IMO, the Tech, Semi, , IoT, SaaS, Sectors, will be least impacted . It’s not like we are talking about AUTO , RETAIL sectors, that are closing production, have a huge supply and virtually such small sales due to this epidemic.Consumers will buy The new Xbox n PlayStation Consoles and Lap Tops and server upgrades will be necessary and such infrastructures for these platforms (Software as a Service) will need updating and expansion as we realize that the efficacy of Tech actually is multifaceted - from applications n etc from ALL SECTORS, from the medical sector and etc."
"In 2019 Teradyne earnings grew at a 20% CAGR, and in 2020 the CAGR increased to a whopping 62%. ARK investments only holds stocks that they believe will grow at a minimum CAGR of 15%. Listen to Cathie Wood's comments here about 23 minutes in: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ark-invest-cathie-wood-typical-day-142448727.html. I am certain when aggressively buying shares of Teradyne the way they have been over the last 2 weeks, they foresee a significantly higher CAGR - probably 20-30%. Clearly ARK views the recent drop in share price due to the overly conservative, anemic growth forecast on the earnings call as a buying opportunity. I agree."
"The sector is zooming and Ter. is 'fahrting'.Ter. will not stay above 120 for long, look for 110-115 new trading range.Lots of selling pressure with very few buyers stepping in after Cathy Wood's exit.Today's CC was not bullish. The bottom line is that Ter. out of favor and will driftlower."
Favorable mention of TER in Barrons. (article on robotics) Probably get a couple % bounce off that. The article pumped me up myself. I like TER as a growth company but I am mainly a value investor so I just own a modest amount of TER shares. The article pumped me up I wish I had a little more. If it doesn't bounce very much on the Barrons article I might buy a bit more.
Ark invest just added more shares of TER on Tuesday this week

Bought in for the for the first time at 132.24. I hope it eventually moves like the other cloud stocks.
"Our Baby TER is now trading at over $82 here in the AH session! But I am not selling, want to hold this tomorrow and see how much higher she can go. Planning to hold until about 2 PM tomorrow. A risky strategy, for sure. But the best way to succeed as a Pure Earnings trader is to RIDE UP your winners, because it is a fact that you will have a few losers that ride you down really hard. :-)"
"Take a look at how much higher EPS just was last Q compared to January of this year when the stock went to 147.9. EPS back then was 1.05 $, not 1.91$."
Pointed out on cnbc...... increased production by 40% and training of ee's from 10days to 2. WOW

"Gonna sell any minute, right mr perfect?"

"So enjoying this day while mourning the Covid numbers... $BA biggest holding... soon to be overtaken by my second largest holding $SDC. Have smaller positions in $BMY, $TER, and $PFE.

"If you are wondering why it went up, it’s because I bought more. Time to rock."
What about the $2B stock buy back? Has to be good news.
