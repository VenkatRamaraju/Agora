"Rate hike again weighing on REITS, why would you sell with a div this month?"
"I am adding another 1000shares, Cim is now my larger holder beside TTD"
"Chimera Investment Corp. (CIM) reported second-quarter net income of $163.3 million, after reporting a loss in the same period a year earlier.Chimera(CIM) said it had net income of 60 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for investment gains, were 54 cents per share.The mortgage investor posted revenue of $252.7 million in the period. Its adjusted revenue was $172.1 million."
Adding more share today.
"Just purchased my first 200 shares of CIM. I've owned NRZ for a while and this seems to be the same, so I thought I'd split my addition between the two this time. I know I just missed the divy, but 14.50 looks to be a decent price."
"The current technical condition for CIM is strong and the chart pattern suggests that upward momentum should continue. The stock has outperformed the market over the last 50 trading days when compared to the S&P 500. The MACD-LT is confirming that the intermediate-term trend is bullish. CIM's chart formation indicates a strong rising trend. Over the last 50 trading sessions, there has been more volume on down days than on up days, indicating that CIM is under distribution, which is a bearish condition. The stock is trading above a rising 50-day moving average. This validates the strong technical condition for CIM."
Great time to buy mortgage REITS ! Yield curve is finally steepening + huge book discount + low and certain financing cost = perfect environment for REITS... #NLY #CIM #TWO
"All this talk about when you can sell and keep the dividend. Notice how the price is quickly recovering? One dividend capture strategy, is to sell, just before the ex date, then buy on ""dip"" that occurs the following day. So you ""capture"" the dividend early. Thats why the price rises so quickly. So do you reeeeeeally need to own it at the close yesterday to get paid... no. You just have to be extremely good at timing."
"sell order at 19.30, thoughts?"
"finally got my dividend this afternoon. Long past 7/30, but talked to IR and they took care of it. Thanks."
"Because I am insane I literally doubled my position in CIM a few days ago. Now I am ""just"" 10%-ish down overall.No, I take that back - I am not insane; this Market is insane.Throw money, hope for the best.Insanity."
Every time you collect dividend it drop down more then you collect but what you can do is ignore the up and down trend and collect your dividend.

Nice I'm glad I picked up shares avg 6.52
Keep add on more share now.The next leg up is $20
"Latest reports says June existing home sales are up 21%.What's it mean here?Well, homes being sold typically means mortgages being created and, interestingly, CIM is in the business of making money off of mortgages.What's good for the country is good for CIM, almost directly measured.The earnings call should be interesting especially w.r.t. ""Forward Looking Statements""."
I wonder how such low volume can lead to such a huge drop in price. You would think this would have traded 50MM shares already with a 50% haircut today and here we are with only 5MM shares traded for a company with 185MM o/s. .
"Chimera Declares Fourth Quarter 2020 Common and Preferred Stock DividendsBusinessWire1:15 PM ETThe Board of Directors of Chimera Investment Corporation announced the declaration of its fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.30 per common share. The dividend is payable January 29, 2021 to common stockholders of record on December 30, 2020. The ex-dividend date is December 29, 2020."
"Diane, I am a long term investor and I am buying CIM and IVR at these low levels and holding long term. The Virus is a bump in the road for these stocks and when people look back, they will say what an opportunity this was to buy at these levels and return to the high dividends pre Corona."
"People have no idea what this stock is going to do. FORGET the market cap which is already in the B’s. CIM numbers are CRAzyyyyy. It’s Revenue is through the roof, it’s leverage funds are solid etc Trust me CIM can/will do GameStop numbers. I know I sound crazy, well fine stay tight there while I keep add to my portfolio because WITH or WITHOUT you we’re going to the moon, it’s only a matter of time. To all my ppl holding long see you on the moon."
$300 per 1000 shares just showed up today in my brokerage account.There is something to be said about buying into a stock as an income investment rather (or along with) as a growth investment.
"One more like this, they will have to increase or announce a special divi.. Way too much spill-back in there at this point.."
"Released : February 13, 2018 BOARD DECLARES FIRST QUARTER 2018 DIVIDEND OF $0.50 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK BOARD EXPECTS TO MAINTAIN A $0.50 DIVIDEND ON COMMON STOCK FOR THE REMAINING THREE QUARTERS OF 2018"
"The share price has been beaten down the last few weeks by expectations of a poor earnings report, which should have been baked into the price. However, we got a slightly positive report, so if the market is rational (big if) I would think this recovers quickly to around $9.00"
4.5 billion in dividends since inception try getting 10% at the bank. The people who do the real thinking should get paid ..... a lot!!!
Will be a good ER. Bears get rekt.
Long CIM for Income!!!
My bet is today is the day the dividend is announced. The BOD would have to vote on it and BOD's generally follow a meeting schedule that is the same except for holidays. They have announced on a number of first Tuesdays of the last month of a quarter. That would be today.
Last dividend announcement for the preferred shares was May 20 with an ex date of June 9. Expect an announcement this week on the preffereds.
Adding 440 more share from my dividend
This has been my best performing stock over the past year (+77%).
Q2 dividend is due out in a couple of weeks.Adding more now while you all still have time.
All dividend are taxable.
TIME TO SOAR!BACK TO $20 WE GO !!!!!JUST NEED TO ANNOUNCE DIVIDEND FOR COMMON!GO CIM!
Volume is rather significant today - already well above average full-day volume after only an hour of trading.
"$TWO $CIM $NLY $NRZ $ARCC $MFA $IVR $NYMT $ORC alright guys..based on the earnings so far, which one you think is recovering the best and why? I am in all of these but need to park some more money in some of these. feel free to suggest outside this list as well. thanks."
Predicting CIM dividend will be in a range of $0.40 per share coming up.
Does everyone think the dividend is sustainable long term?
"My first post! From the UK been looking at some some exposure to the USA Housing market, 13% div looks very very tempting whats the history like with this company? the drop in share price from april also looks interesting, I tend to hold for at least a year if the fundamentals don't change. Also thinking about GMRE Thanks All."
"People? Any idea why we are underperforming so badly of late? The sector, I mean. Thank you!"
"Something to keep in mind - This is a company that leverages mortgage credit . Assume that their agency book is fine . So the Freddie ,Fnma agency position is fine and so is the Agency commercial book. The issue for the management team is the residential non agency part of of the portfolio. One would assume if the current economic conditions continue delinquencies will excelerate causing valuation and financing issues. So expect the dividend on the common to come under pressure. There is a huge risk reward payoff here ..at current prices even if the dividend take a hit . When I listen to the investment calls every Q I walk away feeling confident in the management team doing the right thing. Patience in this case will prevail."
Prime rate from the fed will not affect the current book of CIM and has very little if any effect on future purchases.
"This is very good for CIM (and all REITs for that matter):""...Pending home sales, based on contract signings, rose 8.8% in August from a month ago, far surpassing analysts’ estimates of a 3.1% increase, according to Bloomberg. It marked the fourth straight month of increased activity and exceeds pre-pandemic levels. Pending home sales increased 24.2% from the same month a year ago, according to the National Association of Realtors, noting that pending home sales transaction rose in all four regions of the country. The results follow record existing and new home sales results for the month..."""
"If you look back from 2007to present, you'll see the stock price has stayed in the same price range. As I said recently, this is a dividend machine, it is not a growth stock..... just think of it as a very high yielding CD, but with more risk. Good luck to all."
11.6% yield!! Great Earnings and Cashflow! 6.8 PE!!CIM going much higher!Buy Buy Buy!see you at $20+

I bought 1000 shares today. I took gamble and hoping I made a right decision with great dividends. What do you think?
Well Getting back in yesterday was a good idea... I expect this will pop up even more with news of a dividend increase. I'm looking for $0.45.
"2020 Common Stock DividendsOn February 11, 2020, we announced our first quarter 2020 common stock cash dividend of $0.50 per common share.

We paid the first quarter cash dividends on the issued and outstanding sharesof our preferred stock on March 31, 2020."
according to Yahoo CIMs payout ratio is 62% right now so there should be a nice special divi if this is correct. their projected earnings for the year is quite a bit more than 2 dollars than they are paying now
last day to #$%$ the $.50 dividend on the preferred B stock.... CIM/PRB Seems to have been continuous payer.
How many senior people have left since the pandemic started?
"Added another 25% to my position @ 8.59. Avg now 14.47, love this divvy here. Long and strong."

11/17/2017...New home construction reaches highest level in the last year...I guess they don't need any more loans....I will hold this ...and add on dips...good investing to all....
This stock is 1/2 of what it was a year ago. Pays 10% and has been rising steadily. Still has room to run.
picked up 7000 shares at 16.66 thank you
Who is holding down CIM?????
"Today being ex-dividend date for CIM, does the stock fall tomorrow?"
"Does anyone have information on purchasing or researching ""CIM Prd"" 8% series D preferred stock? I tried researching independently with no luck."
I think a special dividend may be announced before spring.
if you are retired and taking your divis as cash you don't really care what the sp is. like I own 2900 shares I get a little over $480 a month and it doesn't matter if the stock is 19 or 16
"Mon September 13 2021Board Declares Third Quarter 2021 Dividend of $0.33 Per Share of Common Stock NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Directors of Chimera Investment Corporation announced the declaration of its third quarter cash dividend of $0.33 per common share.

"7 different insiders made market purchases of total 288k shares on 18 March. There were also 3 insiders that purchased a total of 153k shares several days earlier at significantly higher prices. Obviously insiders dont know everything and couldn’t predict the rapid market implosion, however, once the implosion occurred 7 insiders used the opportunity to increase their positions. Unlikely that insiders would buy shares on the open market if they expected the current conditions were going to render CIM insolvent."
"Does anyone know how $CIM is similar to or different from $TWO in terms of businesses they are involved in? I know I can check their 10-K but if someone has any insights, I would appreciate it."
In @ $8.20 / 50k shares... / Awesome
"By law reits must pay 90% of earnings, end of story."
Chimera Investment Raised to Outperform From Neutral by Credit Suisse8:35 AM ET 1/25/18 | Dow JonesNo reason for the dip
"CIM will survive, the uncertainty around commercial mortgages, bankrupties, etc will play out. Dividend will be adjusted to meet REIT requirements. I'm in for the long haul, will dabble to bring avg cost down a bit and just hunker down and wait it out."
"Ex dividend soon, and real estate market strong. Mortgages are much stronger than back in the crash in 2008. Was watching something on TV where they stated that over 90% of outstanding mortgages are mortgages lent to people with credit scores near 800."
"Home construction still going gangbusters.And as we all know (we all know, right?) when homes get sold, mortgages get created and when mortgages get created certain companies package them together and make money by selling those securities to investors and and and...And we know at least one company that does that, right?"
Gurufocus shows 10 insider buys from 2/28 to 3/18 total >3M$. Does anybody have more updated insider buy information? The stock seems so over punished and dividend yield is so tempting. Insiders should have much better visibility of loan leverage and default risk than us. Am I wrong?
"Expect this to go up to $15 before next dividend. Their preferred stock is another good steady payer. The dividend increase would not have taken place unless there is cushion. Unless there is another market collapse, I expect this to be solid for awhile. It may take some time to get back to its all time highs, but I can see that happening within a couple of years and meanwhile, collecting dividends isn't a bad hobby."
funds are loading back up with cim shares!! 20 by end of summer
I'm happy with their Div. The down day gave me the opportunity to buy back some of my covered calls.
Very happy I held this
Best dividend stock now !!!
"Buy CIM, NRZ, PMT, and TWO. This is opportunity of a lifetime."
"Just curious-What are shareholders doing with this stock who bought in the 20's in Feb. of this year losing over 1/2 the value? Still holding? Added to lower your cost average? Dumped for the loss and reinvested in tech? Many stocks are at all time highs but REITS, banks, airlines, retail, and many others are at or near 52 week lows. I trade bio stocks for faster returns. The drug stocks pay dividends unlike the bio stocks but do not rise and drop to do quick trades. Anyone loading up on REITS at these low high yielding dividend payouts or are you staying away? Always nice to get other investor takes."
Just saw they announced the dividends for the preferred classes. Think there is an increase coming on the common stock dividend?
This is a stock that I slowly but surely increase my position on just for the dividend. Much better than having it in a savings account. No brainer!
My accountant talked me into buying this stock a little over a year ago ($8.11 a share). My only regret is that I didn't buy more!! I'm up 89%. I will be buying more even at today's price.
The steadiest stock in my portfolio with a huge dividend
"$0.30/share quarterly dividend - Forward yield 13.64% - ex-div Sept. 28.These guys are solid, have kept a good dividend throughout the worst times, beat earnings and rev on last report"
Just bought another 2000 shares... $1000 dividend Monday... great deal...
Cim Whisper dividend increase from $.33 to .45 this upcoming period.
Hey Bond if the dividend goes to .43 cents the stock would immediatly rise to above $17.20. LET'S HOPE YOU ARE RIGHT !!!!!!
not taxable only in roth n retirement accounts!!
NWS I also bought some IVR and holding and waiting ! All the talk on the dividend it should be announced late next week !!
$NRZ vs $CIM which one is better in terms of future increase in stock prices and annual yield? where would you drop 100 K right now between these two? Thinking long term.
I own 3000 shares. Tomorrow is ex dividend date so you have to own the share's BEFORE that date to recieve the dividends. Tomorrow buying is too late...If i'm right you can sell your shares tomorrow and still recieve the dividends on 31 July.If i'm wrong please correct me ;-)
special div payed 08 and 14
NICE dividend coming. Ex date 9/27.
not bad. cim paying .48 dividend for common shares. i am used to dealing with monthly dividends which comes out to .16/share monthly. during these times of the corona this not bad. agnc dropped their dividend to .11/share and they are around 13.00/share. i guess there are a lot of people that do not like quarterly dividend payout. the research shows that they set themselves up in case this type of situation happened again like in 2008. i just dumped my shares on arr (a loosing battle) and bought cim. good luck trading. :)
Last quarter they announced preferred shares on May 20 they announced common shares on June 10 Everything is in line think positive
"Speaking of placing a positive spin on things...:The latest reports are that the estimate of the number of COVID-19 cases has skyrocketed while, of course, the number of known deaths has remained not as an estimate but as a hard fact and has NOT skyrocketedWhat does this mean?It means the lethality of the COVID-19 virus has been GROSSLY overestimated - as number of cases skyrocket with no accompanying skyrocket of deaths the mortality rate, of course, declines.One comment I read noted that the mortality rate is now down to the ""flu level"" (certainly not a GOOD thing but not a PANIC NOW thing either).How long before The Markets note the numbers?"
"It's not that uncommon for CIM to announce their dividend after March 15. They did this quite often before 2016, so personally, I'm not reading anything into CIM not yet announcing their dividend amount and date.I'm still holding Long."
Buy more now
so it appears cim will open at 8.46 Monday on ex date. question: where will it close on Monday? I'm hoping above 8.77.
What is the September 2020 Ex-Dividend date? I couldn't find it on chimerareit dot com. Thanks.
I am holding CIM since 2010 and collecting 10% dividends. Bought more during Covid crash at $6.00
"Question.. If I buy CIM today at say.... $10.72. I hold it into ex day, which is tomorrow, and pick up the .30 div but then sell it at $10.42 on the open... Do I get to show the loss for tax purposes for the year 2020 and get the div gain put on tax year 2021?"
I believe CIM will declare a special dividend by the end of the year. Just my opinion.
Now that most of my big pandemic buys have recovered and made some nice cash CIM is my main GO TO stock to just keep buying and hold for the dividend. There is easily still 50% upside here and the dividend will get back to the $2.00 pee share it was at pre pandemic. May as well buy in while the price is still low to capitalize.
Let the markets drop - let Cim Rise to the top. MMMMM its good to have a real stock.
Cim will heading into $24 range before the next earning release.
Just used my dividend reinvestment to add more shares.
"This is a buy and hold. As the vaccine goes out, businesses will reopen and borrowing will occur and CIM will flourish big time pumping out big dividends for years. This is not a quick flip stock. It has paid dividends for years, and there is no reason it should not continue."
"....,.I just Rebalanced my portfolio and bought a boatload of CIM at 8.88 Thumbs up if this is a good move....."
"Bob posted something about a REET, does anyone know what that is? He will not answer my question for whatever reason. his post give no info just makes claims about investors that do not know what they are investing in."
"Picked up 3,500 shares at this price I don't see how it can be to awful"
"GAAP net income for the second quarter was 145 million or $0.60 per share on a fully diluted basis. This was from the recent transcript of earnings. Which annualized would be $2.40 indicating a $22.00 stock value. Buy now or be left in the dust. Also the dividends on this are not a taxable event, let me repeat this, dividends on CIM are not Federally Taxed !"
"Chimera Declares Third Quarter 2020 Common Stock DividendBoard Declares Third Quarter 2020 Dividend of $0.30 Per Share of Common Stock NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Directors of Chimera announced the declaration of its third quarter cash dividend of $0.30 per common share. The dividend is payable October 29, 2020 to common stockholders of record on September 29, 2020. The ex-dividend date is September 28, 2020"
"I'll go out on limb here and say CIM is fine. I looked at insider trades for ANH, IVR and MFA, all three are down big time today, IVR had no insider buying in March. ANH and MFA had very little. CIM on the other hand had huge numbers from eight officers. That leads me to believe their prepared to use there own money to stay solvent."
Just like I did last x-div. I sold the day before and bought the day after. This stock seems like it always drops far below the dividend amount. You can make a ton of money on this stock when you figure this out.
"Earnings came in at $.32 a share, slightly beating average expected $.31"
Look like CIM is reserving for a special dividend in December.
Crazy situation. Current book value is $21+ Price to book at $7.50 is approximately .355 You can buy the stock at a 65% discount to book.
when will the common divvy policy be announced?
"I'm already quite invested in MFA, NYMT, and TWO. Saw this dip to $6.64, did some research, and decided to throw a bit in."
Am I the only one reading that they blew away their forecast and seeing that its either down or up a few pennies? What does it take to get this over 15 its like a stubborn mule
anyone buy @ 13.80? Your a legend
"Very strong financials, very low P/B value, and high Earnings per share. RSI oversold and slow STOCH indicates a strong BUY. Finally, lower price than March 18th, lower than 2008 financial crises price, lowest price in its history.. Entered a position at $6.49.. Buy it with both hands "
they have issued this same thing over the last several years and never cut div!! share holder since 2006
Cim has a blow out earning.
"When I can't pronounce the names of the key executives, I take a big step back."
Nice earnings report - smashed estimates by 25% (57 vs 45 cents). We are trading at the largest discount to book in the industry (64%) when you look at the larger REITs. We should be at least $10 @ 80% BV. I will keep my current holdings and add if the general markets tank this summer.
Just got back into CIM it hit my low price target I held it for years on the run up from 12 to 20 collecting fantastic dividends all the way now back for dividends and next rise up
They just announced.30 dividend next quarter $1.20 equates to $15 could go higher quickly
"In January of 2008, CIM was $94.75 per share.Let THAT sink in."
"No one cared that the old CFO was announced outta there on June 22nd and no one cares that the new CFO is in as soon as possible.[historically, the CEO and CFO did not see eye-to-eye awhile back with the CEO (then CIO) turning out to be correct. I wonder if the head-butting had continued or the CFO just desired to retire. Whatever it is/was, no one seems to care!]"
Please help me understand why CIM stock is priced at mid $18 when last 12 month earnings are $2.62 and forecast to be over $2.20 in 2018. With a 90% dividend payout of $2.00 plus a possible special dividend payout the stock price should be north of $20.
CIM is a $20 plus before pademic.Now it is heading back to $20 in near term and going to top $26 before the year end.
"This is the exact discussion from the call transcript from Lee Cooperman's question; "" Our last question for the day will come from the line of Lee Cooperman with Omega Family.Lee Cooperman -- Omega Family Office -- AnalystThank you. Look, clearly you guys have been very surprised by developments, you've used the term twice on this call being cautiously optimistic. Could we assume that the $0.30 dividend, which you declared I guess in connection with this offering you did, was something you felt was sustainable, assuming no surprises and things unfolded as you anticipate?Matthew J. Lambiase -- President and Chief Executive OfficerLee, I think the market is very -- I still think it's a little difficult to really figure out. I've never seen a lot of the things that we're seeing in this marketplace. I've never seen the unemployment rate and the number of unemployed people going up as far as it has. I've never seen mortgage forbearance programs coming into play and that's just stuff that we have never ever seen before. I can tell you that when we started the first quarter and when we started the second quarter, we are in totally different worlds with regard to the economy and projections and thinking about the business. And I just don't think it's a prudent thing for any manager in this environment to say that they have a clear focus of what's going on in the future. And we look -- we want to pay the highest dividend possible, we're all shareholders. But I think with just the visibility, currently in the market with our business and I think a lot of other businesses, it's just not -- it's not what it was a month ago or two months ago. It's very complicated and I think we're being very cautious here, optimistic, but being very cautious.Lee Cooperman -- Omega Family Office -- AnalystThank you. Good luck, and stay healthy.Matthew J. Lambiase -- President and Chief Executive OfficerThank you."
"Well today has been a shock. Solid earnings, analyst buy recommendations recently, now a 17% single day drop? I can't find news on what might be moving CIM today, hopefully not accounting irregularities or missed filings."
I wish I could divine which way the market will move ahead of time like some of these people posting here I would be rich beyond compare.
"special div , nice christmas present"
Cim might gap at open tomorrow.Look at 16.50
Anyone have any sentiment towards Q1 earnings?
Yahoo is projecting 2020 earnings or $1.58. By law 90% has to be paid out as dividends. That would imply a dividend of around 35 cents per quarter.
Forget the class action suite is a fishing expedition by these lawyers.
I like the price rise but it's gonna hurt my DRIP.
Remembered CIM is $20+ stock
Strong like bull.
22 million dollars a year goes out to the top 5 executives in salaries. There are not enough employees to lay off to save money unless they start at the top.
"Divi paid, guess it drops like a rock today...."
$0.33 in dividend is in the book
Cim third Q dividend is come in at what whisper had put out around $0.33 rather than $0.45 but anyway it is still 10%.
Wasn't that the $.50 dividend
It’s seems MichaelS is selling short. Will be tough for him to cover dividends.
I AM AMAZED BOOK VALUE $14.64 PAYING DIV OF 13% AND PRICE HOLDING AT NINE BUY MORE STOCK.

"awesome, the stocks jumping upward nicely."
hello?....does anyone else own this or just me...that was a great report...whats with the low vol....THERE IS A 11.5% DIVY HERE PEOPLE.
Book value of $12.36/share - that is actually somewhat more than the CEO - as Chief Investment Officer at the time (he's both now) - predicted a call or two ago.Today's earnings call is in about an hour at 08:30 EST - more info is on their site at chimerareit with standard URL suffix.[I'm interested in the CEO/CFO interaction to see if they are agreed now on the future...lol!]

"go to yahoo finance ...charts... enter CIM and then click Compare and enter TNX10 you will get two line one CIM the other the US 10year . as you slide across the chart look to the upper left corner of the chart and you will see two boxes one with the price of CIM and the other the YLD on the US 10yr for the exact same date. Your thought process is the correct one, the two are highly correlated . You can do the same with the five year and 2yr. A few observations 1. the levered assets create the dividend. 2. in general the portfolio has high yielding assets . 3. A steep yield curve helps the portfolio. 4. A flat curve is good (the last two years the curve was flat) 5. An inverted curve (short financing rates spike higher then US2yr and US5yr for an extend period of time ) will hurt the portfolios net spread impacting the dividend which will cause the stock to go down. These portfolio manages do a good job hedging this risk but you can't control everything. Another thing to keep your eye on is if they come to market to raise capital by issuing stock or perferred stock diluting your share value. If you believe that interest rates in general are going higher hold off buying. Higher interest rates will force managements hand on the dividend impacting the price. In past years, management has declared the quarterly 50cent dividend as a sure thing for the year but with the fed tighting I'm sure they'll play it much more conservative ."
Looks like a nice pop at opening with pre-market strong. Maybe $8 today?
1/25/18Credit Suisse Group Upgrades Chimera Investment (CIM) Neutral -> Outperform $18.01 -> $19.00
High of $22 last 12 months. I can see no reason it wont match that in the next 15 months with a vaccine and treatments for COVID coming online. I've bought 10000 shares the past 2 weeks. Looks like a no brainer to me.
Time to add more. I’ve been adding since COVID hit. This will be over $20.
A solid performer. Buy and hold.
"Jim kramer said he doesn't understand how cim invests, and how it generate the high dividend. Quite frankly either do I but I own 2600 shares and I love the drip. A risk I'm willing to take"
"First time dividend guy here.... I have Robinhood, do you guys typically get the payout at end of day? TIA."
52 weeks high today. This my one of longest holding since 2011.
"Yet Another $0.30/share deposited in my broker cash account; Thank you, CIM!"
"I own 566,000 shares of CIM at an average cost $12.88 per share."

"I didn't read anything in the CC transcript addressing the dividend. Historically they have announced end of July or the beginning of August. Noting that the last div was announced late, I'm thinking this one may be announced late as well. Failure to get back to a normal div announce schedule along with the drop in book value, may have shook some investors out over the last couple days. After reading between the transcript lines, I think we longs and div collectors will be fine. I believe the liberals will fail at their attempt to upset the economic apple cart in order to gain election votes. I trust most people in the USA are smarter than what the liberals give them credit for and can see right through their miserable, selfish and transparent games."
Cim is the stock to buy and let it do it things for minimum 5 to max 20 years.
The bond buyers are shorting $250M of the common to hedge against new $250 convertible. So 20% of market cap is being shorted today and maybe tomorrow. what I dont understand is why they dont wait for $10 PPS before they start to short ! any insightful response?
"FWIW: The stocks that appeal to investors looking for a steady stream of income are back in favor and may continue to beat bonds in a world of historically low rates, according to BlackRock Inc.After several companies cut or suspended their dividends earlier in the year and “arguably scared investors away,” expectations for payments have stabilized, said Tony DeSpirito, chief investment officer of U.S. fundamental active equity at the world’s biggest asset manager. That’s good news for high-dividend firms at a time when interest rates around the globe are set to stay low for longer, he added.“Investors will increasingly come to the view that it’s not only safe but advantageous to return to dividend payers,” said DeSpirito, who oversees $137.3 billion in assets at the New York-based firm. “Company dividends are likely to provide better income than bonds for some time.”"
Management seemed to announce Q4 dividend earlier than past quarters post-COVID-19 adjustment and remains consistent which seems to bode some confidence in what management has always done and has been doing. Does anybody have any concern over recent announcement of CEO retiring?
"The whole market gapped up, hmmm. Once we get back to that mode where the only time anything reaps a gain or loss is through gapping, I need to place an opposing Put or Call on anything I buy. I've always thought stocks should be required by law to open at the previous day's close and let the market move the price, not some questionable mm. I feel much more secure about gains when they come with a steady climb on volume."
"Cim had just finish the quarter.Report due in early August, anyone dare to predict?.I am predicting a blow out quater"
"The loss in paper value of my income portfolio of stocks could have paid for MONTHS of living expenses.Then again, tomorrow CIM is distributing that WUNNERFUL dividend!Buy, never sell, and one quite frankly doesn't even notice a paper loss.====For me (and many others) an ""income"" investment (as opposed to growth) is ""forever"". Buy into a COMPANY after doing one's Due Diligence then pass the position on to heirs after you croak and let THEM think about worrying about STOCK prices - or not if you've advised them right."
ahh 15 for a flash
"Still very cheap. They are well run, lost share price with the virus. Share price rebound, dividend is solid and will perhaps go up. Best to all. Great retirement stock especially in a ROTH."
How many here have actually received their dividend?
Cim future earning prospect should put it at the level before Covid19.Which is at or around $21 per share.Covid19's sell-off is not based on the fundamentals.Cim earning is much better during covid19 as compares to pre-covid.That is my assessment.Anyone can add to it or ignored it entirely.
......Earnings here in 2 weeks.....Today will be a glorious GREEN day.....Cheers long and strong......
What is ex-div date for the preferred shares as it’s usually a month before ex-dividend date for common shares? I didn’t see it posted in Q1 div declaration.
I'm buying on these dips.CIM will continue to shine over time!And it goes ex-dividend next month
So we just got news on the preferred - but not on the regular stock. Still an unknown on the regular.
Very surprised trailing eps is greater than forward eps.
Buy now before it moves higher than this.
Cim will be at $16 before Sept dividend announcement.
The woman handling the conference call is great - lol!
Where is the common stock dividend announcement?
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-never-bullish-chimera-161040660.htmlGreat to see the big boys all over this stock!
Div announced .50 ex-div Dec 29th
"I am not a financial weenie, apologies for that with this comment since I may not know what I'm typing about, but it appears to me that the Moody's report (see Summary above) says CIM has some really high quality mortgages in the discussed/rated pool.This is good."
Share price increase is just a bonus. I am here mainly for the high dividend yield earning $650 per quarter.
"Released : February 14, 2018 4TH QUARTER GAAP EARNINGS OF $0.52 PER COMMON SHARE 4TH QUARTER CORE EARNINGS(1) OF $0.62 PER COMMON SHARE FULL YEAR GAAP EARNINGS OF $2.61 PER COMMON SHARE FULL YEAR CORE EARNINGS(1) OF $2.34 PER COMMON SHARE GAAP BOOK VALUE OF $16.85 PER COMMON SHARE"
there is no for sure div cut !!! the statment was if market does not improve they would cut to 30 cents in q2 but would be looked at before time to announce . the cut if happens is to insure stronger balance sheet and in prove cash on hand for the short term till the market improves.
why the sell off
Good to see over 10 again
Started at 9$ with 200 share. I've been adding and now at 325 at 8.69. what y'all think keep buying cim?
Great place to park your money and collect a juicy divy while the stock price just keeps on going up... really slow but still :) Just added more shares.
"This is one of my worse stocks, but feel it will be my best in 2022. Paid to wait."
I know what has caused this recent decrease in price. I bought another 100 shares.
New investor to CIM. Looks like it can have a great run back to the high teens. Trimmed my gains from SFIX.
"Chimera Investment (CIM) on Wednesday reported Q1 adjusted diluted EPS of $0.36 per share, compared with $0.56 per share a year earlier.Analysts polled by Capital IQ expected normalized EPS of $0.30 per share.Revenue, represented by net interest income, totaled $135.1 million, compared with $158.2 million last year. The consensus estimate was for $119.1 million.The company's board increased Q2 dividend by 10% to $0.33 per common share."

"In a Bloomberg news editorial it was noted that cash is now flowing into dividend equities, especially high quality high yield stocks as a defensive measure against recession fears. Also noted was that the real estate sector has surpassed technology in terms of growth."
"Beavis: re. your question regarding indicators we should be looking for in advance of a raised divvy.......IMO....1. The market screaming that it will rise regardless of who sits in the WH next year.2. Powell says 0% is the foreseeable future.3. CIM handily beat on earnings.4. The market liked the beat.There are no difinates here but given the above, I’m optimistic re. a dividend increase next Q."
"Once the dividend for common is announced, CIM takes off!Expect to be back to $20 by year end!Buying more everyday!"
Price is creeping up ahead of annual report on Feb 10. Must be some better than expected results leaking out.
"Steve, I know you were joking, CIM has a great management team and us long term dividend investors are doing great. Where else can we get such a large dividend with so small a risk? Banks are certainly not the answer.."
CIM is a $20 plus stock
"A typical factor against ""book value"" is 0.9-ish. During the last earnings call (and on the Fact Sheet at CIM's website) the book value was stated to currently be $10.63, thus the ""factor"" times that results in about $9.60/share.However, this is the hard value as of the last earnings call.If one assumes - and I certainly do - that the business will improve from the Covid Crash then the extrapolated book value for 2020 (*) rises to the $12-14-ish range. Multiplying by that factor thus gives a predicted soft value of $11-13-ish (the 12-14 range came from the Chief Investment Officer during the earnings call; the $10.63 comes from the CFO).So, plan accordingly![with the daytraders bouncing the price around, of course, any price stated can vary - as we have seen - by huge amounts]====(*) Actually, I didn't check if that was the best-case =2020= range; it might be the range for a time period that is bounded by business factors, not the clock.Related aside - at an average cost of about $14/share, my long-term income investment in CIM eventually depends on the price passing that. However, since this IS an income investment that I intend to hold on to, like, ""forever"" the actual stock price for ME doesn't matter too much - I bought into CIM for the dividend(s) for me and can let any heirs I might have worry about the value of the stock they inherit!"

"Why do I get the feeling that some large holders are manipulating this stock. Given the dividend, insider buying, and financials, I do not see any reason for CIM to continue to decline like this."
it will rise for earning on 2/2 and also volume for sellers is drying up; all good signs to bring it back to 19
"well, I bought $100K worth at 17.559. Just looking for income, hope it works out long term"
"I bought 500 in March, $11.42 average. Held ever since and got some distribution. Should I just unload? I don’t see this going back close to $20 for a very long time. I get the dividend, but I bought too high. Thoughts?"
Some people that do not believe in CIM future growth have gotten smack yesterday before the close.That is because of no confidence.
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-ranked-income-stocks-buy-144002902.htmlZacks rates CIM a strong buy today!Great news for everyone LONG!
"My guess is div. announcement first week of June, stock of record 2nd week and pay date June 30."
Divi announce early is like . We are still good here....Was looking for that bounce off the bottom and got in over 10. 13 is my Sell and probably pick up a Div or two along the way. GLTA!
"I have over 3000 shares, I'm not going anywhere. I've been with CIM over 15 years. Hang in there, reinvest div., buy on the dip, you'll be fine!!!!!"
"The recent surge in share price, and insider buying, bode well for my hope of a somewhat less drastic dividend slash, to .30 , which should support a share price of $11+ . GLTA"
Buy more Cim now....another dividend raises is coming
This will end (corona) and when it does (like china and south korea) those that bought in the panic will make awesome returns!
Better than expected with upbeat projections tomorrow. Moving up from here.....
All high dividend stocks are selling for some reason- southern company is low as well; it may be rotation out of high dividend stock; we should hit a low point and then it should rise; always a lot of selling pressure after dividend
I'm very surprised with the drop in CIM shares. I hope we aren't in for the volatility we saw a couple years ago. Earnings couldn't have declined in 4q2017 enough to warrant the losses since last ex-div date of over $1?
This was $11.00 in June after COVID tanked many stocks. I see a quick recovery by 2021.
In March the div was .50 but the last two were only .30. The share price is in the tank so even if you owned this stock for a few years it is way off its high. The dividend is nice percentage wise at todays PPS though so if you can buy the dips and hold you should eventually be up if you get your cost down by buying more shares at these lower prices.

"After this earnings call, I look for the price to to increase $2 to $2.5 buck from here over time."
Why the big drop today? This stock rarely moves so much?
Don't Panic....This is a dividend machine...check back from Nov. 2007 to Present. Share price has been pretty level for the past 12 years and the dividends keep coming in.
I loaded at $11.01. No regrets.

Is anyone joining the class action lawsuit ? Getting emails and requests from lawyers. Not sure I understand the premise and if I'm wasting my time.
16.9 was the bottom and Chimera Investment Initiated at Market Perform by Raymond James
Anybody else not yet received the current dividend?
"I bought over 400 shares for under $10, when I sold my last position and it was above $23, I was scared I would regret it. I think this stock is solid and will perform like in the past."
Think we’ll see 20 again?
"Earnings release early tomorrow with earnings call shortly thereafter:""...Chimera Investment Corporation (NYSE: CIM) ... announced today that it plans to release its financial results ... on Wednesday, August 5, 2020 prior to 7:00 a.m. EDT.

CIM will begin going down next week as we near earnings and as always goes down as it nears divididend payment in September.
I have not bought this since it was over 20.00 I bought back in at 14.91 almost the lowest since it was 3.00 when I was first in. Great buy!
If you had a million dollars would you buy CIM and retire off the income from the dividend?
Should see 18.00 a share again soon

Looking for thoughts on this stock as a long term hold in retirement
"in the year of the split the div hit 20 % yield and never was cut , has you know the price increase in share will lower yield as it did 11 years ago"
Overdone on inflation worries. CIM should be cranking out dividends for a long time. Good time to dip in today.
hey If the stock stats higher as is in pre-market. I'm finally at profit again. would be great if it could recover it's stock price within months.
I just bought CIM few days ago. Then bam got this email today about it. Looks like there may be some positive coverage starting to occur. Calling for an increase in the next dividend and a special dividend at years end. The math works for what they are speculating?http://mvpstockpicks.com/chimera-investment-corporation-ticker-cim/
I bought 3 shares for the Divy I hope they don't cut it
"Been with CIM over 10 years, prior split in 2015, have nothing to complain about. Dividens per shares has been good for me. Most likely will hold for many years."
If i buy today will I get divi?
Is CIM paying a dividend this quarter? They nomally declare by mid Feb. and pay the end of Apr.
Adding until i hold 2000 shares. Then hold forever.
"I have had this for 12 years , bought it at 8 and at 18 , if div ever gets back to 50 cents it will go to 20$ , with a stable company and huge div don't understand why everyone wouldn't buy it"
"Is CIM the best REIT value right now? Even if they reduce divvy to 30 cents in 2nd quarter, that is a 16% yield and stock is currently trading at 60% of BV. Only issue is that their agency MBS portfolio is only 25%? So, there is a big risk if the mortgage market collapses as a result of an extended virus season? Is that why it has not run up with the the other MREITs? Trying to do some DD before adding more..."
