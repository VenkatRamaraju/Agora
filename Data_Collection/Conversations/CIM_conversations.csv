Just saw they announced the dividends for the preferred classes. Think there is an increase coming on the common stock dividend?
"GAAP net income for the second quarter was 145 million or $0.60 per share on a fully diluted basis. This was from the recent transcript of earnings. Which annualized would be $2.40 indicating a $22.00 stock value. Buy now or be left in the dust. Also the dividends on this are not a taxable event, let me repeat this, dividends on CIM are not Federally Taxed !"
Cim need to be able to hold at $14.80 before the close or it will see 12.50 next week.
Cim is heading back to near term of $17 and then moving upward to $21
Look like CIM will trade sideways for a few weeks till the new divi date coming out.
Cim might trade sideways or slightly lower today...expect to close around $14.80
Cim future earning prospect should put it at the level before Covid19.Which is at or around $21 per share.Covid19's sell-off is not based on the fundamentals.Cim earning is much better during covid19 as compares to pre-covid.That is my assessment.Anyone can add to it or ignored it entirely.
"ka ching, i few pennies here and there on this one. NOT like one of my oil stocksHappy with paying 10.97 a share only up 45% compared to 500% with silverbow"
"Could somebody help me with this? According to Yahoo the EPS (TTM) of $CIM is 2.99. But when I add up the EPS of the previous four quarters (according to Yahoo's chart), I get 1.52, not 2.99. Now it strikes me that EPS for the ""trailing twelve months"" is the same as EPS for the trailing 4 quarters, more or less. The use of the number 1.52, by the way, would be in line with the 0.33 dividend payment coming this quarter (1.52/4 x .90 = 0.37).But I have no idea where the EPS (TTM) 2.99 comes from. Does anyone know? It's important to me because I hold this stock for income and I want to be able to see what the income should be."
Cim third Q dividend is come in at what whisper had put out around $0.33 rather than $0.45 but anyway it is still 10%.
Bond: Step away from the ledge.

"This is the same trading patterns for the past month, peak at 1 or 2pm and sell toward the end of closing.Either institution pump it up and unloaded at the closing."
NWS I also bought some IVR and holding and waiting ! All the talk on the dividend it should be announced late next week !!
"Just switched from NRZ to here. This has better management, lower payout ratio, less dilution."
