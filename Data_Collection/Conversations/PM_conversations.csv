Comical.
looks like there is some sort of news out
We should get tomorrow morning our annual dividend raise. I'm saying we go to $1.25
"Medicago, partly owned by PM, producing plant based COVID vaccine will be going to Canadian regulators by end of year. Wonder if this will MOVE PM???"
"Excellent post and a must read from the investor village message board.IQOS ILUMA eliminates the heating blade by using a technology that PM has trademarked as Smartcore induction technology. I'm not an engineer, and the process is likely somewhat proprietary. However, in general, I assume it works similar to induction stoves and ranges to generate the necessary temperature to heat the tobacco in the HEET. The key appears to be the design of the new ILUMA HEET stick that PM also developed that heats by computer control without any blade being inserted into it. That then keeps the HEET stick from being pierced and thus eliminates any ash and cleaning like current blade devices require. As for ILUMA needing to go through red tape for approval, there are widely different rules & regulations in various countries about tobacco, cigarettes, and next generation products. However, in general, most countries are not as restrictive as the US has become with the law giving the FDA oversight over such products, and needing to approve every single product. ILUMA is already being sold in Japan since July. It was planned to be introduced in parts of the EU and Russia this year until the semiconductor shortage hit, so in all those countries it is already allowed to be sold. So yes, all countries have some red tape and regulation, but most are easier than the US. The bigger problem in the US is that the FDA constantly misses their own deadlines because they are backlogged. So not only are they restrictive, they are slow. Which is why I said it might take a year or more to get ILUMA approved here. As far as the European patent cases and rulings, I don't have the specifics. I am going by what PM CFO Emmanuel Babeau presented in the Barclays consumer staple conference earlier this month. If you can speak the languages, I'm sure you could find some of the various decisions online. However, it appears that most of the various rulings in favor of PM in those cases are due to BAT's patents being unenforceable due to vagueness or prior use. I don't think that BAT even believes they will eventually prevail. They are simply using law and/or political clout to slow down IQOS where possible to give them time and opportunity to generate their own competing products. In the US, they have now been successful with the patent angle (for now anyway) despite not prevailing anywhere else in the world so far. However, as I said, even if IQOS is slowed for a year or so in the US, it isn't really clear that makes much difference given how slow MO was taking the rollout along with the semiconductor restraints that are likely to persist into 2023 anyway."
Watch out here comes that annualized 5.23% dividend on Thursday. DRIP all he way to the bank.
I was just thinking this morning WAY back when PM first got spun off from MO. And how their first dividend payment was $.46 LOL. Now its $1.25! Good to be a shareholder!
"Man down $11 a share since August, they must be getting management collaboration from MO, HAR!"
"Most recent from Micocap Daily and why the case is heading for the trash bin: Exhibit J is PM’s FDA report where the FDA was discussing the marketability of the IQOS device determine whether it combusts or not for health reasons. Judge Timothy C. Batten, points out that because it was attached to the complaint it can now be part of the lawsuit and the battle to dismiss. Judge Batten decided he was not going to decide Summary judgement, the problem is that HCM is arguing that there is combustion but their attachment says there is no combustion. HCMC now has 14 days to provide new documents that show the IQOS device does in fact combust as they have been alleging all along. If HCM can show that the IQOS device does in fact combust than the case will move forward, if not than HCMC lawsuit against PM will be over."
Just unloaded my 20 - Jan 21 $95 call options this morning. I bought them the day the IQOS news came out last week. Knowing it was a non factor to PM. I knew the stock would recover....and it did. Picked up around $1200 profit. Not bad for a weeks work of doing nothing :)
He said that Iqos ruling coming at the end of October and expects to be back on shelves with FDA approval soon after.
Beat! Q3 earnings. Gain up 20% plus dividend YTD.
"As I suspected, excellent earnings in a still difficult environment, especially international travel and the farce of the BTI complain about IQOS sales in the US, which btw will probably be either overturned or a mute point (with the new cutting edge technology PM is rolling out) by early 2022. If you people want to buy a great company that rewards its shareholders with great dividend and long term growth at a discount now is probably your last chance."
How much share do i need to have to get 1 share with the DRIP ? 67?If not enough dividend to get New share is it possible to pay to complete the ammount for 1 share ?
"Added more PM this morning. Schwab continues to list it as one of its favorite stocks and noted that it just beat earning. Chip issue, I believe will resolve itself as shipping issues are addressed."
VUSE received FDA approval today (10/12) RJRenolds
Make the Deal!
"Done a little reading. Iqos makes up a very small portion of pm and altrias American sales but the guy has already tried this in other countries, all of which sided with pm. Would almost bet it will be a successful appeal. But until then ill get a few shares a bit cheaper for nothing at all lol"
"It is down over 1% today (at the time of this post), yet New Constructs issued their analyst report today that ranked it ""1 - Very Attractive"". Not sure what the divergence is here. Some of the analyst commentary:We strongly recommend investors buy PMPM ranks in the 95th percentile of the 2800+ stocks we coverPM earns our Very Attractive ratingPM ranks 10th out of 141 Consumer Non-cyclicalsSo ... I will HOLD and look forward to more gains going forward (not to mention the outstanding dividend)."
As most of us thought PM raised the dividend to $1.25. Man this stock is just printing money for its investors. Long and strong.
"333.2 Billion OS. 199.9 Million market cap. If $PM settles, the market cap is actually not that bad, and if all these shares get bought up, could you imagine how high this would go, because I can't."
PM is a good inflation play as long as they keep increasing that dividend
"Going ex dividend today, will see a drop in price"
How much do I like the 4.2% dividend increase..alot but how about MSFT's 11% increase. I like that alot as well.
In at $95 yesterday into close....way oversold with lQOS restrictions only with Altria as worldwide use of IQOS continues unscaved.
"Hardly anyone is making money in the US on IQOS yet, and it's part of the LT vision, --not ST or MT, so why the steep drop in SP? IQOS ILUMA could potentially take the place of the previous IQOS, which uses different heating tech compared to the heating device in question. I don't see this harming the LT vision. Seems like a great opportunity for buybacks and high-yielding shares."
divy increased to 5 bucks a year
Dividend on Thursday =$1.25.
Wow down $1.50 today! Hoping for more weakness so I can add.

I think earnings are going to be terrific. Total overreaction to the IQOS news in the US being pulled. In fact if anything I think this will be reversed. But everywhere else IQOS is growing faster than anything else.
"If you did not know that there was a chip shortage or supply constraints, you would have to had your head in the sand. This is already built into the current price (IMHO)."
"Anybody thinking Juul being taken off the shelves is delusional. The paperwork has been submitted, MILLIONS of users are also over age 18 and also voters. The small mom and pop, cottage industry types will be thrown under the bus for sake of a good show. Who's the winner? #MO, #PM of course. People can evade taxes by home rolling, (and they have) but you can't make homemade juice and electronic devices that fill them. Competitors will be essentially wiped out. Government needs that tax base, so they will keep a few around for revenue. And it is a lot of revenue!"
Each day on very low volume. I don't mind it as we are going to be buying for stock with the buyback program.
chip shortage now …doesnt matter what they do always something
If PM goes any lower I'm going to have to consider selling. I fear that their dividend will be impacted.
FDA just opened the door for Pm Mo
Philip Morris raises quarterly dividend to $1.25 a share from $1.20
