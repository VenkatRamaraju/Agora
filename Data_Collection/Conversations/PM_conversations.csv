trading like this is an earnings warning
"Since 1965 , 40 % of all smokers have quit . How can tobacco companies recapture these smokers ? The answer is VLN tobacco . Then these former smokers can smoke and quit and smoke and quit and smoke and quit ETC. Management has to commit to this strategy !!"

Need a stock split
"IQOS is an innovative technology that is going to revolutionize the tobacco industry. This nicotine delivery system can convert longtime smokers with few puffs and can mitigated health risks. Combine this with unique flavor profiles only possible with heat not burn, and a potential AI integration you have potential S curves with this company."
highest we've been since 2017
"Most recent from Micocap Daily and why the case is heading for the trash bin: Exhibit J is PM’s FDA report where the FDA was discussing the marketability of the IQOS device determine whether it combusts or not for health reasons. Judge Timothy C. Batten, points out that because it was attached to the complaint it can now be part of the lawsuit and the battle to dismiss. Judge Batten decided he was not going to decide Summary judgement, the problem is that HCM is arguing that there is combustion but their attachment says there is no combustion. HCMC now has 14 days to provide new documents that show the IQOS device does in fact combust as they have been alleging all along. If HCM can show that the IQOS device does in fact combust than the case will move forward, if not than HCMC lawsuit against PM will be over."
VUSE received FDA approval today (10/12) RJRenolds
Congratulations PM shareholders on the dividend raise. I was happy to them raise it that much for y’all.
Piper Sandler raised target to $116 from $114.
its sep 15 when does Pm announce if they got 50 percent of Vectura stock
Dividend on Thursday =$1.25.
On sale....buy this dip!
Did we not fully recover from the chip shortage story. We moved up smartly from $102.
Just unloaded my 20 - Jan 21 $95 call options this morning. I bought them the day the IQOS news came out last week. Knowing it was a non factor to PM. I knew the stock would recover....and it did. Picked up around $1200 profit. Not bad for a weeks work of doing nothing :)
"Man < 5% in 5 days, this #$%$ is starting to look like MO, has MO management been advising PM?"
"The battle for Vectura Group Plc may be nearing the final stages after Carlyle Group Inc. said its 958 million-pound ($1.3 billion) offer is final, opening the door for Philip Morris International Inc. to potentially walk off with the U.K. drugmaker."
"Added more PM this morning. Schwab continues to list it as one of its favorite stocks and noted that it just beat earning. Chip issue, I believe will resolve itself as shipping issues are addressed."
In at $95 yesterday into close....way oversold with lQOS restrictions only with Altria as worldwide use of IQOS continues unscaved.
Really hard to believe
If you take a step back for a moment and look at the bigger picture PM is actually doing really well. The IQOS thing is a massive undertaking. I mean think about it for a minute. A product that people have been using for decades. And they invented something to replace it. Convinced 10 million users world wide in under 5 years to use it. Then spend a ton of money to build up the infrastructure to support it...all while paying out about 90% of their profits to share holders....AND investing heavy into more R&D for the further development of IQOS. Add in hits on currency exchanges. And still they kept it all together? Oh and convinced the FDA to let them sell their product in the USA.That is impressive if you ask me.
Case has been dismissed!#HCMC case has been dismissed and Motion to Dismiss filed by #PM has been granted by Judge Batten in the case.
vol higher than usual pre earnings…3.30 intrinsic for the 97 four day straddle
Beat! Q3 earnings. Gain up 20% plus dividend YTD.
Growth in the tobacco market will come from products that address the needs of those who have quit.That product is VLN tobacco which will allow former smokers to smoke and then quit and then smoke and then quit.
make the deal!!
"Ladies & Gentlemen, time to get on the right horse. No wonky restrictions. Upside will be life changing.https://www.linkpicture.com/q/Screenshot_20210930-185010-2.png"
not a good ruling yesterday. PM will appeal
Each day on very low volume. I don't mind it as we are going to be buying for stock with the buyback program.
Our boys at PM must really find Vectura a great fit for the future growth. Not giving up on the offer and PM has very deep pockets.
JUUL Products Will be Approved....If they roll out the technology that was presented to the FDA and Congress.https://www.regulations.gov/document/FDA-2015-D-2496-0051This technology addresses the dual mandate of reducing underage access to E-Cigarette products without infringing or limiIng access by legal age tobacco consumers.This is a critical factor that demonstrates that JUUL products embedded with this technology is appropriate for the protection of public health.Former FDA Commissioner Gottlieb has stated repeatedly the importance of preventing youth initiation of e-cig products.“The youth use will be a critical countervailing factor in weighing against application approval. It’s incumbent on the e-cig makers to prevent youth initiation on their devices if they want to succeed through the regulatory process that’s prescribed by the Tobacco Control Act.”
So is the Dividend increase coming or not?
make the deal with HCMC and stop the bleeding
"Such hate for PM due to Pharma acquisition. Why? Smoking is a consumer choice. If PM doesn’t profit from it, then criminal drug cartels will. At least PM pays taxes unlike Juan in Colombia with his golden gun. Media has people brainwashed."

"The company is now expecting full-year heated tobacco unit shipment volume to to come in toward the low end of its 95-to-100-billion-unit range, if shortages persist, and for third-quarter heated tobacco unit shipment volume to range from 23 to 24 billion units."
Waiting on that annual dividend increase. Hoping for $1.25 per quarter. Anyone know when the announcement is scheduled for?
"As I suspected, excellent earnings in a still difficult environment, especially international travel and the farce of the BTI complain about IQOS sales in the US, which btw will probably be either overturned or a mute point (with the new cutting edge technology PM is rolling out) by early 2022. If you people want to buy a great company that rewards its shareholders with great dividend and long term growth at a discount now is probably your last chance."
"Looking back, $HCMC down .004 over last nine months, trading sideways. $PM up $32 share last 12 months with about $1.20 share divvy paid each quarter. Choose your investments wisely"
"PM Jacek will appear on CNBC shortly. talk about chip shortage,"
"Don't forget PM has a repurchase stock program between $5 and $7 billion just announced and kicked in with Q2 results. PM is monster of a corporation and I expect a nominal increse in its dividend. Barrons just reported that the Tennessee Dept. of the Treasury dramatically increased it position in PM stock (473,350 more shares) for a total of 1.57 million shares. Long and strong and DRIP all the way to the bank."
"So they beat earnings and revenue estimates. Down 1% while MO is up. If it had missed estimates by the slightest amount, it would have really tanked. Makes no sense."
"I'm new to researching PM, own shares in MO, can any longs tell me enroads PM has made looking forward toward marijuana legalization? things maybe like iqos, vaping, partnerships/investments in companies in that space currently. Thanks for any info, regards."
"To management : How to get a growth multiple for tobacco stocks : Consensus of stock holders say, expand the product line by recapturing those smokers who have quit smoking . How ? By introducing VlN tobacco because they can smoke and then quit and then smoke and then quit and then smoke and then quit ETC. This choice will command a higher price than regular tobacco and because it is a choice , prevent legal action against tobacco companies !! Good politics as well ."

"This is from a Barrons article on MO's acquisition of Juul. This is the close of the article in which Bonnie Herzog addresses a merger of PM & MO:While neither management team commented on the WSJ's report of a deal being in the works, Herzog said she expects Altria ( MO ) to invest between $4 billion and $7 billion for a 30%-40% stake in Juul. She estimates Juul has $2 billion in annual revenues. Longer term, Herzog thinks that a merger between Altria ( MO ) and Philip Morris International ( PM) will take place, with ""reduced risk"" as a catalyst."
How much do I like the 4.2% dividend increase..alot but how about MSFT's 11% increase. I like that alot as well.
"Listened to the cc, had a hard time understanding anyone."
I think earnings are going to be terrific. Total overreaction to the IQOS news in the US being pulled. In fact if anything I think this will be reversed. But everywhere else IQOS is growing faster than anything else.
looks like there is some sort of news out
"People saying we aren't being shorted are mistaken. Block Salea in LARGE LARGE amounts through private entities every morning.Look at $HCMC stock market record 25 BILLION + V. a few months back. On that day the judge grants extension with $PM and the cEo of $HCMC increased OS by double!! adding 150BILLION. Insider 101. $PM previously used OConnor and now he's representing $HCMC... AND THATS LEGIT!?$WDLF MY FAVORITE STOCK, prior to $NEAV and still love it, just no money there right now. $WDLF IS suing for security fraud for 60MILLION!! CitiGroup all but admits what they do, personal investors and banks buy very large amounts at a discounted % usually about .04% + they buy on the dips. And in morning highs the sell their whole block purchase rinse and repeat. $MMEX is another prime example..It makes it so easy when the CEOs work with them. Perhaps that is why the other stock are considered legit, yet with such a small market cap, such a low float/time ratio we are still not traded on the atfo me of the ones I mentioned above. Anyone have ho says these stocks, the whole OTC is being manipulated is mistaken. And the profits are being dinner into the main market. That is why LOYALTY is so so so important!!!It took the whole OTC To rally behind tsnp and that they did. Fact is, it happens, always has and always will. When she goes there is no stopping her, it's just a matter of time. Until then these s gains might as well be barcoding for the big boys. $NSAV FAM KEEPING IT ."
"Vectura has been barred from a major medical conference because PM is buying them. What has our world come to where idiots like these rather shoot themselves in the foot rather than give in to the ""evil"" cig companies. This world we have been creating with all these progressives is very similar to #$%$ Germany in the early 30s where the German public was spoon fed every day with propaganda. Crazy man."
How much share do i need to have to get 1 share with the DRIP ? 67?If not enough dividend to get New share is it possible to pay to complete the ammount for 1 share ?
the money they dropping for end of day pops can make the deal.
Will we make new yearly high today?
I don't smoke but love a great dividend
"Total overreaction to something that PM has no control over and will be fixed eventually, probably very soon."
"No need for a better dividend when they can use the cash for accelerating IQOS transition. They can start to increase revenue, at better margins, increase in market share, with less of the health hazards (an “healthier” brand). $MO and $PM have the disruptive capability of a whole new paradigm for the tabaco industry, I am in it for the long run, and expect a very big upside when the market catches on to this capability for Altria Group"
Did the divi get increased?
"What will do the best in this inflation driven recession? Tobacco, Liquor and dividends, Check, check check, your crazy not to be buying here"

It was a nice run
What has really been in the news as one of the most profitable investments? I really wanna understand much about one
PM takes 23% stake in Vectura ahead of the vote.
Over-reaction as usual.
93 coming. Make the Deal!
Great deal for PM on its acquisition of Vectura. This company is in growth mode.
I was just thinking this morning WAY back when PM first got spun off from MO. And how their first dividend payment was $.46 LOL. Now its $1.25! Good to be a shareholder!
"Philip Morris International Announces U.S. Food and Drug Administration Authorization of IQOS 3 for Sale in the United StatesBY Business Wire— 3:32 PM ET 12/07/2020NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today confirmed that IQOS 3, Philip Morris International’s electrically heated tobacco system, is appropriate for the protection of public health and has authorized it for sale in the United States. FDA’s decision follows an assessment of a remarket tobacco product application (PMTA) filed with the agency in March 2020.The IQOS 3 device contains a number of technological advancements, compared to a previously authorized IQOS device, including longer battery life and quicker recharge between uses. In its decision the FDA noted that: International survey data reviewed by the agency found no evidence of increased uptake of IQOS by youth or young adults, while use patterns available for a previously authorized version of IQOS within the U.S. have not raised new concerns regarding product use in youth and young adults. Commenting on the FDA’s announcement, André Calantzopoulos, PMI’s Chief Executive Officer, said: “The agency’s decision to authorize IQOS 3 for sale in the U.S. is another important step forward for the tens of millions of American men and women who currently smoke. In just five years, approximately 11.7 million people around the world have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS, and we believe bringing a more modern version of IQOS to the U.S. will only accelerate switching by adults who smoke.” He added, “The order is subject to the same comprehensive commercialization requirements set in the April 2019 PMTA marketing orders for IQOS 2.4, which aim to maximize the opportunity for adults to switch from cigarettes, while minimizing unintended use. We, along with our licensee Altria, are committed to guarding against unintended use and fully support FDA’s focus on protecting youth.” Editor’s Note: On July 7, 2020, the FDA authorized IQOS 2.4 as a modified risk tobacco product (MRTP), finding that an IQOS exposure modification order is appropriate to promote the public health. The IQOS 3 PMTA authorization is independent of the MRTP authorization for the IQOS 2.4 device. PMI expects to file an application seeking a modified exposure marketing order for the IQOS 3 device.On April 30, 2019, the FDA authorized IQOS 2.4 for sale in the U.S. through issuance of premarket tobacco authorization marketing orders. IQOS is available in the U.S. market through an exclusive license with Altria Group, Inc."
Never seen an earnings report they didn't sell
If this was msft we'd be up 5%
"Negative book value, you dont see that too often. I dont have anything against PM or tobacco companies, but I feel like they, in combination with the govt, killed the goose that lays the golden egg. I used to smoke plenty of cigarettes (and I enjoyed every single one of them to the max, from the 1st one to last, and regret none of them), but the tax and price increases made it totally unaffordible. By the time it was $10+ I was so mad and unable to keep paying I forced myself to quit at great difficulty. Since then I have watched the price decrease, seemingly because other people felt similarly to me. Keep pushing taxes on fewer people, more people will quit, and you will need to add more taxes....feedback cycle. Most regressive tax imaginable, on the weakest and those who can least afford it. Who will they tax when everybody quits? PM owns a lot of that too as they allowed govts to tax their customers, demonize their industry, and nickel/dimed their customers to $10/pack. Industry complacent in its own destruction"
"""Despite a very challenging quarter due to the pandemic, we delivered results above our previously communicated expectations for both net revenues and reported diluted EPS,"""
"Hardly anyone is making money in the US on IQOS yet, and it's part of the LT vision, --not ST or MT, so why the steep drop in SP? IQOS ILUMA could potentially take the place of the previous IQOS, which uses different heating tech compared to the heating device in question. I don't see this harming the LT vision. Seems like a great opportunity for buybacks and high-yielding shares."

"Philip Morris (PM) to Boost Smoke-Free Options With Fertin Pharma https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-pm-boost-smoke-141202596.htmlAs part of its ambitious plans of building a smoke-free future, Philip Morris International Inc. PM agreed to acquire Fertin Pharma A/S, in a transaction worth approximately $820 million. Fertin Pharma is a leading manufacturer and developer of innovative pharmaceutical and well-being products that are based on oral and intra-oral delivery systems. Let’s take a closer look at the aspects associated with this buyout.Benevolent Steps Toward Building a Smoke-Free PortfolioPhilip Morris expects to complete the acquisition in fourth-quarter 2021, by funding the same through existing cash. On completion of the buyout, Fertin Pharma will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Philip Morris. The acquisition is expected to be immaterial on Philip Morris’ full-year 2021 adjusted diluted earnings per share.Fertin Pharma is a contract development and manufacturing organization, and is currently owned by the global investment organization EQT and Bagger-Sørensen & Co. This privately-held company’s operations are spread across Denmark, Canada and India.

It is well-known for its unique Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) solutions.Both Philip Morris and Fertin Pharma share the common goal of delivering a smoke-free future and enable people to live healthier lives. Moreover, Philip Morris expects that Fertin Pharma’s superior scientific insights and technologies will enrich the company’s innovation capabilities, especially in the oral delivery platform. This is likely to aid in the formulation, development and commercialization of existing and additional smoke-free platforms. The company is likely to be able to accelerate presence in the fast-growing modern oral category, by providing a broad range of smoke-free products such as nicotine pouches and lozenges.By leveraging Fertin Pharma’s technological capabilities, Philip Morris expects to develop scientifically substantiated botanicals and other selfcare wellness products including over-the-counter solutions and supplements in areas such as sleep, energy, calm and focus.

Wow down $1.50 today! Hoping for more weakness so I can add.
Why didn’t PM raise this as a risk in last earnings call? Not a secret chip shortage is hitting all sectors. HMMMMM

"Big tobacco is in trouble, and the writing is on the wall. It's a no-brainer. If this stays above $50 for more than one-year, I'll be shocked, unless they transition away from tobacco......."
FDA just opened the door for Pm Mo
Philip Morris raises quarterly dividend to $1.25 a share from $1.20
Why has PM been going down the last couple of days?
He said that Iqos ruling coming at the end of October and expects to be back on shelves with FDA approval soon after.
PM is a good inflation play as long as they keep increasing that dividend
when is the exdate
"Excellent post and a must read from the investor village message board.IQOS ILUMA eliminates the heating blade by using a technology that PM has trademarked as Smartcore induction technology. I'm not an engineer, and the process is likely somewhat proprietary. However, in general, I assume it works similar to induction stoves and ranges to generate the necessary temperature to heat the tobacco in the HEET. The key appears to be the design of the new ILUMA HEET stick that PM also developed that heats by computer control without any blade being inserted into it. That then keeps the HEET stick from being pierced and thus eliminates any ash and cleaning like current blade devices require. As for ILUMA needing to go through red tape for approval, there are widely different rules & regulations in various countries about tobacco, cigarettes, and next generation products. However, in general, most countries are not as restrictive as the US has become with the law giving the FDA oversight over such products, and needing to approve every single product. ILUMA is already being sold in Japan since July. It was planned to be introduced in parts of the EU and Russia this year until the semiconductor shortage hit, so in all those countries it is already allowed to be sold. So yes, all countries have some red tape and regulation, but most are easier than the US. The bigger problem in the US is that the FDA constantly misses their own deadlines because they are backlogged. So not only are they restrictive, they are slow. Which is why I said it might take a year or more to get ILUMA approved here. As far as the European patent cases and rulings, I don't have the specifics. I am going by what PM CFO Emmanuel Babeau presented in the Barclays consumer staple conference earlier this month. If you can speak the languages, I'm sure you could find some of the various decisions online. However, it appears that most of the various rulings in favor of PM in those cases are due to BAT's patents being unenforceable due to vagueness or prior use. I don't think that BAT even believes they will eventually prevail. They are simply using law and/or political clout to slow down IQOS where possible to give them time and opportunity to generate their own competing products. In the US, they have now been successful with the patent angle (for now anyway) despite not prevailing anywhere else in the world so far. However, as I said, even if IQOS is slowed for a year or so in the US, it isn't really clear that makes much difference given how slow MO was taking the rollout along with the semiconductor restraints that are likely to persist into 2023 anyway."
"Philip Morris is just a great American corporation. I have been a shareholder since 1978. It pays a great dividend. In the future, PM will be a leader in the burgeoning cannibis industry. Hold onto your shares. I also look forward to the next meeting of shareholders. Hopefully, this will be an in-person event in NYC. Always the class operation, PM supplies great food to all attendees."
Dividend raise doesn't matter. Ilmao
 congrats all 
HIGHER PRICED VLN TOBACCO WILL PRODUCE MORE TAX REVENUE !!!
When is dividend announcement
"It is down over 1% today (at the time of this post), yet New Constructs issued their analyst report today that ranked it ""1 - Very Attractive"". Not sure what the divergence is here. Some of the analyst commentary:We strongly recommend investors buy PMPM ranks in the 95th percentile of the 2800+ stocks we coverPM earns our Very Attractive ratingPM ranks 10th out of 141 Consumer Non-cyclicalsSo ... I will HOLD and look forward to more gains going forward (not to mention the outstanding dividend)."
should be early sept.
"PM preannounced lower EPS not higher as I originally stated = selloff this morning,"
Comical.
"Tell you what. This is a great article not because it says Altria wanted to play it ""safe"" and have both e-cig as an option but because it describes what I have been saying ever since PM got the approval from the FDA to sell IQOS here. They will have a monopoly and actually Altria has been slow-walking the rollout of IQOS. No more. Now they even have something a lot more valuable. FDA's approval as a safer alternative and NO OTHER cig company has submitted such a request. https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/15/iqos-reduced-risk-label-victory-shows-altrias-dual.aspx?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&yptr=yahoo"
Watch out here comes that annualized 5.23% dividend on Thursday. DRIP all he way to the bank.
"333.2 Billion OS. 199.9 Million market cap. If $PM settles, the market cap is actually not that bad, and if all these shares get bought up, could you imagine how high this would go, because I can't."
"$PM really doesn't want this going back to the FDA. Then it comes out that they lied? About to get caught with their pants down??Confidence still low, had so much faith in $vpor who is $hcmc last company, after 3-4 MULTI MILLION deals with $wlab the swept it under the rug and closed shop. Still at this price, 5 million shares for the same reason I had TONS of $vpor, if the CEO is a snake oil car salesman, he's always gotten me to bite, but I still keep wanting to believe, as much of a boZo and clowns the whole $hcmc team looks like, wom one is doing something right behind the scenes . The wizard of OZ? Imma follow the yellow brick road. The small man behind the curtain is controlling the bricks of gold, and soon, hopefully they start selling by the Oz. and we reap some rewards."
"If you did not know that there was a chip shortage or supply constraints, you would have to had your head in the sand. This is already built into the current price (IMHO)."
Is IQOS going to get banned by FDA along with other E cig?
"Is Dividend safe?Philip Morris InternationalPhilip Morris International, the second largest publicly traded tobacco maker in the world, was spun off from Altria (NYSE: MO) over a decade ago. PMI sells its flagship Marlboro cigarettes and other brands overseas, while Altria remains in the US.This means that PMI can expand in countries with higher smoking rates and avoid tighter regulations in the US, but it remains heavily exposed to fluctuating exchange rates and regional economic headwinds.Shipments of PMI's traditional cigarettes declined in recent quarters, but it offsets those declines with price hikes, lower manufacturing costs, and other cost-cutting initiatives. It's also expanding its IQOS lineup of heated tobacco products to offset its weaker shipments of traditional cigarettes."
#HCMCArmy we have a scientific/expert in combustion that will testify & demonstrate the reason why there is partial combustion in the Phillip Morris $PM IQOS device. You are toasted $PM! I am a long term investor & no matter what happens I will hold long on $HCMC & Keep buying. Stay strong 
Make the Deal!
"Analyst Adam Spielman reiterated a Buy rating and $100 price target on Philip Morris ( PM ) . He writes that Tuesday ""was one of those results days when the share price reaction was more interesting than the press release,"" as the shares -- which were initially higher on the beat-and-raise report -- ultimately fell nearly 6% by the close. He attributes the decline to ""positioning and rotation. It shows (yet again) there is a disconnect in tobacco between fundamentals and the shares.""Spielman notes that shipments of its heat-not-burn product IQOS were a bit below consensus, and Philip Morris's ( PM) market share growth slowed. Yet he says investors are overlooking that inventory issues weighed on the shipments to the tune of about 8%. Excluding that, underlying IQOS volumes were up 28% year over year, picking up steam from the second quarter. In addition, the number of users also grew by more than a million; there has only been one other quarter when it reported higher user growth, he notes."
funny but I posted this twice and it keeps getting deleted. My post was does anyone know when the lawsuit by BTI will be decided by the International court on whether PM can continue to sell IQOS in the US? Lets see if they delete this...
"PM and MO will own the POT business when it goes legal across America. No one will compete with them and the states will love all the easy tax collecting. It is a simple deal and will be the new business of the future vape or no vape , you decide."
