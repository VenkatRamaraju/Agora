Packers playoff games provides exposure for $ASB aka AssBank. They have a gate and a meeting area outside the luxury boxes named after them. Also a new branch in Titletown next to the stadium. Sounds like a good way to waste operating profit.

And opened $ONB branch office downtown Milwaukee in space abandoned by $HBAN when they sold out to AssBank $ASB Wonder if they left any body bags behind? Must want to die from excess overhead.
I will use my $2mm line of credit from $ASB aka AssBank to do some trading today. No way I trade $OESX until they agree to co-market the carp light.
Will this be sold in the next 2-3 years? What endering quality would allow it to remain independent?

Went to $ASB aka AssBank near my house 3 weeks ago before I left for NC. The $ONB across the street is being converted into a strip club (supposedly) which should bring some great ATM traffic to $ASB. Could be som great co-marketing opportunities but cashless transactions probably tough unless AssBank could rig the girls up with some card slots for tips and table dances. Let your imagination wander.
