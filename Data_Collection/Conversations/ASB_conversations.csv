ASB-PC is up 6.22% to 22.36
Been waiting to sell at $25..... May have grand kids by then.
Went to $ASB aka AssBank near my house 3 weeks ago before I left for NC. The $ONB across the street is being converted into a strip club (supposedly) which should bring some great ATM traffic to $ASB. Could be som great co-marketing opportunities but cashless transactions probably tough unless AssBank could rig the girls up with some card slots for tips and table dances. Let your imagination wander.
