DTM down 10% in only a couple days - not a good sign as DTE fell almost the same
Does anyone have thoughts regarding what you will do with your DTM shares? (ie. Keep or sell?)
I usually sell stocks on spin off. This one is the first one I kept because it was a large portion of assets. Was waiting to see what happens to the stock dividend! Decided to keep it!
When will we see our holdings?
"Congrats to ALL who held. Natural gas will be the fuel that will be with us for decades to come. Even California knows that renewables will not help with its energy needs, especially starting in 2022."
I contacted the company. At tax time they will issue a 1099 not a K-1. I wasn't going to hold my shares if there was going to be a K-1. For the time being I still own my DTM but I don't have an opinion on whether or not it is a good investment for my needs. I am retired and bought DTE originally for its dividend and that it was increasing annually.
"Hi, I would appreciate if someone could tell me what my DTM shares cost. I divided the cost by the number of shares, and came out to $6.13. Is that right? Thank you."
"Why own DTM? We see six reasons to ownDTM. First, it boasts a high quality, well-covered dividend with an estimated 6% yield in ’22.Second, its balance sheet is top tier with a clear path to investment grade and <3.0xleverage by 2025. Third, DTM generates on average a 10% FCF yield through 2025 andfunds all its growth without the need for external capital. Fourth, DTM’s exposure to growinggas basins drives a first-quartile EBITDA CAGR of 5%. Fifth, DTM’s contract structure limitsvolatility with 70% of revenues supported by minimum volume commitments (MVC) withalmost no direct commodity exposure. Finally, DTM is a C-Corp with ambitious energytransition goals – an ESG attribute we would expect to widen the investor pool."
"Admittedly this is a woefully uninformed question, but I just saw that DTM was added to my portfolio. I own DTE but was unaware of its connection to DTM. How did it show up in my portfolio?"
The dividend for DTM would need to be about $2.08/share annually for the total yield of both DTM and DTE to equal what DTE was before the spinoff.
"I now have DTM in my VGD account. It would be nice to see earning, debt, dividend, PE, etc. That information should be readily available being their revenue has been tracked through DTE. I am very skeptical on holding this company. Neutral to bearish. Thoughts?"
"Earnings released this morning and 5.4% dividend announcement;The DT Midstream Board of Directors declared a $0.60 per share dividend on its common stock payable Oct. 15, 2021 to shareholders of record at the close of business Sept. 20, 2021"
When will we get proof that we have these shares
"Kinder Morgan news just out and DTM smack in the middle of Haynesville shaleIn the Haynesville shale formation in Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas, Kinder executives said there may be need for additional takeaway capacity in three to five years as drilling activity in the basin increases due to its proximity to Gulf Coast liquefied natural gas export plants.Haynesville is the nation's third biggest gas-producing shale field."
Does anyone know why DTE employees are being forced out of their DTM shares from their 401k? I received a notice in the mail saying my DTM shares within my 401k will be liquidated after 06/30/22.
"Detroit News-Old Farmer's Almanac forecasts 'Season of Shivers' winter in Michigan, U.S. Good for natural gas prices, good for DTM, hope that dividend help paying those bills.Clearwater ,FL."
"I will keep my DTM for the long hall. Looking at their latest presentation, May 19-20, assets are in great locations for many years of growth. Page 23 shows pipeline/storage locations"
If DTM becomes a acquisition target any idea what someone might pay. Someone would get an FERC stablecash generating machine in all the right places. Hard to build new pipelines these days-Keystone
Anyone know the market cap of this thing. I don't have a share count. Thanks
