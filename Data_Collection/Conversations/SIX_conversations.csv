STRONG BUY...NEXT YEAR WILL BE GREAT...MAKE SIX FLAGS GREAT AGAIN...BUY BUY BUY?
"scott, investors hungry for yield and safe dividend ...i think six has both ...as fed lowers rates to zero it could go higher .."
blame 46 and the dems for this
The only way today becomes even funnier is if the CEO puts out a release saying he assumed everyone knew they only got 1/2 of a percent of revenue from China. Lol
seems like this will touch $20 today!!...
"Had a great day at Six Flags today! They checked our temperatures, cleaned the rides between turns & had plenty of sanitizer available stationed throughout the park. Everyone wore masks, but you were able to take them off on the rides...most including I... just pulled them down under our chins during the ride. Lines weren't long...the longest was Thunder River at a 40 min wait. They had the 6 foot stickers to control the 6 foot rule for all lines to a ride. All-in-all, well worth the visit & I have already made 2 more reservations for upcoming dates. Our Six Flag water park opens July 10th & I made reservations to visit it too. I believe if you visit Six Flags once this summer, you will feel safe & happy enough to visit again."
"I've been going to Six Flags Magic Mountain in California since I was a teenager, I'm in my 30s now and I still go. Every time I'm there, park is packed, lines are long, and I spend a lot of money on food there. Most importantly, the patrons are having fun. I feel good about SIX and it's future. Just my 2c."
"So, a new CEO comes in and probably has a good portion of his compensation tied to share price growth based upon the current price at issuance. If you were getting a 2020 plan you would of course want the stock to be low when issued and reap all the rewards provided by the fear mongers in the market when a business shares some of it's challenges.Do you really think all other businesses have effortless paths to growth and profits?? I like that this dropped so significantly, easy money in a week. I'm long here anyway! Solid market position, continuous improvement and a consumer oriented CEO. Don't be surprised if you see some interesting cross marketing promotions and partnerships coming soon. Scooby-Doo where are you?"
"It was due for a drop, just gonna buy more."
CNBC Interview was EXTREMELY POSITIVEMakes me want an annual pass This guy KNOWS WHAT HE's DOING FOR SURE
fortunately most banks that reported had awesome number. strong banks = strong economy.
"when I turned 10, my buddy and I both got season passes and his mom would drop us of at Six flags with a couple packed lunches every day as daycare. From 8:30 to 6:30, we were at the park almost every weekday. That was a fun summer"
"Once the sellers are out the stock should recover a bit. The dividend is well covered and hard to resist, I added today under 45."
They will have another record breaking quarter. I'm picking up more shares at this price. Looks like some insider buying is also happening.
"I saw the former CEO's interview on CNBC again from Feb 2019 when SIX dropped 15% after earnings. He blamed then macro in China and associated it with Apple, which was also down to 140. I bought his pitch and bought all the down in from the 50s to the 40s. As you know Apple went to 300s and SIX is at a 2012 low at 36. So it is not all of macro, it is some of SIX. Something happened in the last 2 years. When is the new CEO gonna say something? They have a goal of 750 million of EBITA - how far off are they?"
CEO bought shares worth 1 million dollars between Mar 8- Mar 12...what does it tell you?This is just a Wall Street/shorts game to bring the stock down so that they can make money both ways. Wait for another month and this stock would be above $55...earning is April-23..one months away
Humorous....stock is higher than it was pre-COVID when no one is at the park and the debt level (which was the reason for the drop from 60 to sub 40's in 2019) is more than doubled....lol
"I am going to interject here though I do not a position either way, have played a little with the stock, made a few bucks on the rebound, but here are my thoughts after having endured a very good and harsh year with retail stocks, which i believe this is copying pretty much here. They attack the stock based on what really amount to insignificant and non-accretive events. Six Flags has not lost any money, nor have they made any money from this arrangement prior to this event, there was obviously some positive expectations that this new park(s) would create new revenue streams, well it didn't happen, so at the end of the day, it is really a non-event for a stock that has already been beaten down badly though it does have a new CEO who actually raised the dividend. The P/E is very reasonable both for the overall markets and the sector, it has all of the makings of a value play. Do I believe this is at the bottom, who knows, the market makers have used very little news or slightly negative news to tank stocks only to blow them up over several sessions or several weeks. Case in point Children's Place, bad numbers, weak guidance, stock tanked, the huge short position made huge money, then they ran the price up over the past month, so the shorts who then became longs profited both on the drop and the comeback. The markets are so rigged right now, there is no telling what the big money will drive this stock to. I don't feel for a second this is at the bottom, though also would not be surprised if this is 50 by the beginning of February. If I was long, I would hold, since I do not own, I won't touch it."
"SIX has $2.5B in debt, far in excess of its market cap. It is slated to continue to lose money, most likely through next year. All those foreging expansion projects? Not happening any time soon. So what is there to be excited about?"
"WHAT IS THE PLAN to operate the rides once they re-open? Can someone explain how they intend to deal with the issue of touching everything? Forget about masks and staying 6 feet apart for now. I'm concerned about touching everything. Little kids won't wear gloves, and even if they did, the virus will still spread from what they touch with the gloves. Kids have to hold to everything -- on every ride. Is SIX going to wipe down thehandles of every single ride aftery ever single ride? It just seems impossible to me to picture an amusement park operating without hands touching everything. It's not a museum. So, for the longs, can you please explain what solution is in mind, if any, to deal with that? Thanks."
Yep. Miss. This market is punking everyone. We are headed for a recession. We have possible new highs for the S&P and my account hasn’t budged. Not sure where the money is going but it ain’t over here.
"Looks like it's gonna be a red day for SIX today, unless it makes a comeback ninja style."
"If you look at 2010’s financial statement before six flags went bankrupt, its similar to current balance sheet where $2.7 b assets with $3.9 b liabilities means negative networth of $1.2b. Furthermore, management has extended all passes for one year in order to prevent further cancellations which means they lose $0.5b revenue from their season pass. Also, they cut their maintenance costs for two quarters, which is why we see so many incidents now. Last but not least, they are running on their revolving credit from Wells Fargos who generously pay for Six Flag’s situation during Covid-19 When six flags go bankrupt, their stock goes to zero and the bondholders (debtors) will become the new owners."
"Just bought a lot... i have been doing this for a year, buy under $49 sell over $55"
"I never thought of owning, but my buy the dips after earning reports led me here. 6% yield ,yes please!"
"I have taken my kids to almost all the Six Flags parks, I am convinced, this is a bottom. The dividend appears to be in no danger and is near 8%. I loaded up the truck at $41.50 today."
Helicopter money coming. Bat soup sniffle ending. Bored people cooped up in the house. Time to have some fun and go out to eat. #play #fun #six #dri
Just bought the Jan $25 puts. Easy money
"Conference call solid...div is covered by cash flow, share buyback continues, and capex spending going forward."
This stock looks healthier today. Above average volume but there’s plenty of interest.
"Omg, they raised the dividend. Very surprised."
"H Partners Management activist investor with over 6% stake is not happy with performance and wants a board seat to get involved and make suggestions for improving performance. I don't know what their thoughts are on the dividend. They may or may not want to see it reduced, at least temporarily, until progress is shown. I don't know that the company has done anything wrong. Seems like they were doing the right things. Just bad stroke of luck in China with their partner having issues. China is a minefield."
"Quarterly ResultsEarnings per share were up 150.00% year over year to $0.81, which beat the estimate of ($0.07).Revenue of $459,787,000 up by 2301.85% year over year, which beat the estimate of $330,820,000."
"Dropping pretty hard and fast on relatively low volumes going into ex-div. Is this computerized trading dropping so big volumes come in at the end of day to take advantage of dividend, if so they would then set the computers to drive price up so they can exit the position higher, might be worth a try again at 3:30."
I added some today and will add more if it goes lower. I consider anything sub 50 a gift...
"Since I'm gonna be here the next couple months... I'm gonna let you guys/gals in on my view of what's getting ready to happen... I don't mean just with SIX, I'm talking Macro... and I realize there are plenty that probably don't care what I think... apologies if that's the case.This of course is my own original opinion and I'd love to hear other original ideas/takes...So this is what I see happening based on my intelligent albeit admittedly layman's opinion...Currently it seems like the market is split 50/50 as far as sentiment goes. It seems like large brokerage houses are waffling weekly. Last was GS that said bottom was in as of I believe, yesterday with JP Morgan saying on the same day that a severe recession is coming. So yeah, 50/50. This 50% variance in sentiment equates to about 100% uncertainty in my mind. Equally divided = no one knows. I told you I was a layman. And the market hates uncertainty.I am not in the V-shaped recovery camp and it this is the reason...I'm shocked I haven't heard anyone discuss this yet but I think it will become more and more apparent as the shutdown continues and people like those that are convinced that SIX is opening in May will finally start to get it....I would put them in the V-shaped camp.Here's the crux of it...It does not matter what the CAUSE was that got us to this place. Virus (2020) vs. Corporate impropriety (2008). It does not matter that all businesses are ready to open if they can't without another severe outbreak which cannot be permitted to happen or we will be right back where we are.What DOES matter is where we're at. That there are currently 17 million unemployed Americans + the number that gets added tomorrow.I fully believe that these kinds of unemployment numbers and the radical stimulus spending that's occurring to artificially prop up the markets at close to priced-for-perfection valuations, has put in motion a chain of events that cannot be stopped until a natural equilibrium is reached through a massive correction. You might say The Great Correction ;)Structural flaws in our systems will most likely be exposed that can only be seen during rare events like these. When the systems are under great stress. I'm talking about problems that people WAY smarter than me haven't even considered yet. If this correction happens... Even great names will be dragged down, much riskier equities will be turned to dust.I also believe on the other side of it, if/when it happens, we could see a multi-decade buying opportunity.Anyway, that's my take. We'll see if it happens.Good luck to you."
"One yr ago, SIX traded in the 70s. Now, shares are 30% lower. Did any theme part close? NoDid they cut their Div? NoDid their attendance decline? NoSo what changed?Expectations of growth in income, especially via international (China) have been ratcheted back.With that new dark cloud, the growth in dividends is now also seen to be on hold.Did the share prices get ahead of themselves 1-yr ago? Yes.Has the share price decline been an overreaction? YesWhat is a fair value? Closer to $60 than to $50"
"As soon as the stimulus goes through, this stock goes to $25. Along with The airlines. AAL will hit $17. Bottom line , these are the recovery stocks. You have to look at where they will be after the vaccine. These all have the biggest amount of upside. 100-300%. Just leave your money , and add on the down days. Think long term."
"Bought a couple more shares today. So many things sky high, one of the few things left at decent price."
"Has no one looked at a 10 year chart to see how this stock trades cyclically !? I think basically every year but one it pulls down in the fall, (end of summer), and then moves up towards the end of the year and into the 1st and 2nd quarters. Of course this makes perfect sense on a fundamental level as well. I wait every year to buy around this time, and then sell around late Spring when the fun starts ;-) I did something a little different this year, I sold some Put contracts at $47.50 with a Nov. 15th strike date. When ever I can sell a put that averages out to over 10%/year, on a company I like, I give it a hard look."
"Nice move on the day so far. Not worried about some ""dividend cut."" If you see the free cash flow decrease over the next couple of quarters then get worried. At the moment, I see nothing to be alarmed about. Attendance at the park is up."
great buying opportunity 7% dividend to wait out till international parks come online.
"If we do make an acquisition of Fun there won’t be much overlap, most theme parks are spaced apart a good distance. Price is the great denominator of what we pay for."
41.50 will come back today
"After bottom picking this stock, I didn’t know there was a deeper bottom! Bag holder with half of my shares sold."
"Sounds like Good news to me.. “Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (SIX), today announced that the company has entered into a new 7-year $800 million senior secured term loan facility and 5-year $350 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The proceeds will be used to refinance the $584 million outstanding Term Loan B under the company’s prior credit facilities, to pay off the balance of the prior revolving credit facility, and for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and payment of refinancing fees.The company’s borrowing rate for the new term loan will be LIBOR plus 200 basis points with a Zero floor on the LIBOR rate. In addition, the agreement provides the company with more flexible covenants. As a result of the refinancing, the company now has no debt maturities prior to 2024."
"Wow, on CNBC they were just saying SIX was a buy...even if dividend was cut, the stock had fallen so much that it would barely affect it. Crazy stuff. I have my convictions but not so sure of that one lol..."
Halted
SIX mentioned improved conditions in China. A trade deal will be beneficial for SIX. Stick with it.
"this is the CEO said in the Q3 conference call: Finally, we continue to expand our world class Fright Fest and Holiday in the Park offerings, adding new attractions and event days to accommodate growing demand. We are making progress on our international development projects, which represent about 3% of our annual company revenue. Unfortunately, the Chinese market remains difficult and we are likely to continue to recognize lumpy international agreements revenue until we see progress there for the macroeconomic real estate and trade perspective."
"Six Flags faces a rough ride in ChinaDecember 30, 2019, 12:48 PM · Six Flags' cash cow might have just run out of milk. The amusement park's Chinese development partner appears to be in trouble, which could mean the end of much of the international licensing income for the chain.Trading has been halted on Riverside Investment Group's stock, according to a Chinese news report. The developer posted a statement to its website earlier this month noting a depressed real estate market and suggesting layoffs across the firm"
"""H Partners boosted its position in the amusement-park operator, as it ""continues to be optimistic about [Six Flags'] long-term prospects."" H Partners acquired 100,000 Six Flags shares on Aug. 19 and Aug. 20 at prices of $37.68 to $39.18. H Partners now holds 7,900,000 Six Flags shares, equal to 9.2% of the outstanding stock."""
It’s amazing how market reacts to short term trends and negative news. Even though nothing significant has changed in terms of how SIX is run. Not to an extent of this type of market reaction. Those who hold for another 6 months will reap the benefits of patience. Not sure if it will go to $50 but I see it going to low 40s during summer. HOLD
"Absent a recession, in which case everything will take a beating anyway, I’m of the belief that anything accumulated sub $50 is going to look very good a year from now. 4th largest position I’m holding now thanks to the recent dip, which I seized as a huge buying opportunity"
"Stifel Summary of CEO planned departure...their iconic star, as Analyst claims:News: This afternoon SIX announced that current CEO Jim Reid-Anderson (JRA) has announced his intent to retire by the end of February 2020. SIX has retained an outside search firm to find JRA’s replacement with both internal and external candidates vetted. Recall, this is the second time that JRA has essentially “retired”. JRA served as Chairman, President and CEO of SIX from August 2010 thru February 2016 before turning the CEO reigns over to John Duffey while JRA still remained Executive Chairman. When John Duffey suddenly retired in July 2017, JRA stepped back in to take over as CEO and has served ever since.Key PointsOur Take: We think some investors will try to read too much into today’s succession plan announcement and try to jump to conclusions about the health of SIX’s fundamentals. Honestly we don’t think this decision has anything to do with SIX’s fundamentals. Remember when JRA stepped down as CEO back in February of 2016, he stated he wanted to spend more time doing other things, especially spending more time with family. That plan was only temporary lived given Mr. Duffey’s sudden retirement announcement that essentially forced JRA out of “retirement”. When JRA returned to his CEO seat he was asked about how much longer he wanted to serve as CEO and he responded with this quote: “I have to tell you that I’m here for the long-term, I’m absolutely committed, and I love what I’m doing.” I guess the only question would be is two and a half years considered “long-term”? We would have thought JRA would stick around for four to five years but we also understand his commitment to wanting to do other things.Given the company just backed off its 2020 long-term EBITDA target of $750M and essentially pushed it out until 2021, we believe JRA decided this was the right time to start looking for a successor. Our biggest fear is that given JRA has somewhat of a cult following given his impressive track record of running this company and the impressive shareholder returns he has created, do certain shareholders start to look elsewhere and move on given his impending departure? It’s a question we can’t answer but we do know that JRA is staying on for another year which makes us feel better and will help find his successor and hopefully groom him or her to make this transition seamless.In the end, although we suspect there could be some irrational selling around today’s news, we would use any weakness to accumulate shares given we continue to identify a 12-month total return opportunity well north of 20%. Looking more closely at the core operations, we believe management has built a relatively resilient business model and we see potential upside from further successful execution of its membership strategy. Lastly, although the dividend growth rate could decelerate below management’s previously articulated high-single digit target, we continue to view management’s commitment to returning excess capital to shareholders and the current ~6% dividend yield as key tenets of our Buy-rated investment thesis. All told, we believe investors are being presented with an opportunity to derive a reasonably defensible total return in excess of 20% over the next 12-months, an outcome we view favorably in light of the current volatile market conditions."
Is this a good stock to short ?
My gosh... where is the bottom for SIX hahahahah this is actually mind boggling to me such a great company in my opinion to see their share price at so much higher for so long and to see this is kind of sad
Hope everyone understands they were only consultants on the China projects. They were going to get a couple million in royalties like Disney did. Even if they get zero makes no difference.
"Within the next 2 to 3 months, the government will lift restrictions and the parks will open for the busy summer season. The parks might have to close again over the fall if coronavirus resurfaces, but by December a broad vaccine will be available. The current interest rate is essentially 0% and the government is more than willing to loan money to keep big businesses going."
any input from the field? any investors been to a six flags park lately? like what you see?
FUN at $58 and this at $50. Don’t think I’ve ever seen that. Historically SIX normally a little higher even though they typically trade together. Anyone have any insight on this?
"There are a massive amount of assumptions buying this stock here.I could go on and on.I know Lots of people that will never take a vaccine that hasn't been thoroughly tested for safety.Buyers here are thinking everything is going to snap back to normal because a vaccine is FDA approved.People's behavior patterns have changed.What happens when a large percentage of the population refuses to take the vaccine?Another Billion in debt here.The risk this company faces IS NOT being reflected in the price.You're out of your mind (IMHO) to buy here but hey, it's your money.I have no position BTW.Lost 10k in Puts in April and haven't been able to look away since.After Ibout those Puts the stock ran from $10 to $27 when the parks were COMPLETELY CLOSED. Good Luck here. Nothing about the movement is rational."
"i bought a few today.. it may go lower, but its principally an outdoor activity.. except water park.. it may not be affected as much as indoor activities.. dont know if chlorine will kill this.. i think so.. if so, the selling may be over done, imo"
"""As a result of the refinancing, the company now has no debt maturities prior to 2024.""That is all anyone new to SIX needs to know. Debt matters in times of crisis only if its maturity date were near. It isn't remotely close. 4 years away."
New potential buying. What are your bullish thoughts? Bearish ?
is the dividend REALLY safe? Fidelity shows a 103% payout ratio.
"Liking the seasonal and overreaction pullback to start a position. Long term this company will only go up. It's too costly to for a new entrant to create new parks especially in a rising interest rate environment. Besides Fortnite, theme parks are the next thing kids get excited about."
So strange that this is up today. Investors definitely ruled out the likelihood of a China park.
Insider buying today? We’re up nicely today!
"People are afraid of the the virus and as such people think no one will go to SIX or Fun and the the shares go down, but why have my VZ , BCE, and VOD shares not gone up way more and instead are still going down on account of people just being on their phone and online and avoiding the work. Just a lot of shoot first and ask questions later"
"There is a new investment report out on Six Flags from a company called New Constructs. Frankly I have never heard of them. But the report considers Six Flags stock to be ""Very Attractive"" at $38/share. That report may explain why the stock rose today. It is dated 2/8/20"
Good stretch of weather this week for the Holiday in the Park @ Six Flags NJ. Was there with the kids last night and made my contribution to profits. Nice crowds for a Monday
Check out my analysis on $SIX:https://ericthomson.substack.com/p/six-flags-entertainment-corporation?r=fgeno&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy
Heading For A New 52 Week Low.I thought this high div was beaten up too much earlier this week.Vail is up hugh today.Normally someone in the same industry should rise all boats.I'm out. Keep Six on short leach.
"Now trading at a 7.9% yield. If you feel the div is secure for yrs to come, then there is little to think about concerning purchase. The international growth is a wildcard to the upside, not a headwind since the shares have all but discounted any progress on foreign development for the coming yr.They are the largest US operator, with highly reproducible revenue stream, with little competition. Only fear of a recession hurts their valuation, and posses a risk to their revenue, and hence their dividend."
Smart people love this stock.Smart people are vaccinated.
thank God I loaded the boat at $42 a share.what a great dividend I'm getting to o
I was Talking to someone on the Bloomberg terminal on vanguard and he was telling me this is a unanimous buy from all the analysts he can see.
Wedbush: Price target on Six to $55 From $62. Keeps Outperform Rating.
Fears of Bankruptcy and Chinese investment. I think investors are pricing in parks closing for the whole year which is a bit exaggerated IMO
Think we'll be back over 40 in the spring......these summer momentum stocks usually gain in march/April then sell off in August if you look at the long term charts......this year a little more extreme but not surprised at overreaction given the seasonality factor.....
To be had at 6.4% yield today....but the fact is that almost 2-yrs worth of distributions were lost in share price decline just in the last 2 weeks.
Hurry Close the Parks for wInter.Cut costs Thanks
Is there risk of bankruptcy for SIX ? Do they have enough money to survive 2 more years without revenue ?? Last thing on peoples mind in rescission is to go to Six flags with their kids ... Many questions ..
What does everyone think will actually happen with thus stock here come earnings?
what an easy short..revenue at $0. too high too fast
"Six flags is closed, airlines are atleast running and they got the bailout, yet airlines are dumping.I don't understand the stock market at all."
Well go Down 2% today because the macros are doing so strong
"Thinking about getting this. Pays a nice dividend and despite missing a few earnings, it makes sense to invest in the entertainment industry. People always go to these foe enjoyment.Does anyone see this dropping and by how much? High 30's? Slow season, thus, lower quarterly earnings? Am I correct in assuming this?Thanks in Advance..."
"If they drop the China project completely, does this end their losses in the project? Was this paid for with a line of credit that they will still need to repay or was this 'cash'? Just curious. My assumption is that they would only have to cut the dividend if they continue the project OR have unpaid debt for the project. Thoughts?"
Been looking to buy. Put an order in and then canceled as I saw it free fall. Any reason for this? Why the sudden drop from 48? Still looking to get in. Any longs know the reasons. Thanks in advance.
Sure would be nice to go to the Arlington Tx location without worrying about gangs shooting at you or fighting!!!!
Down 2% on an average volume day. This is not good
"Never would consider myself the panic selling type, but I unloaded my entire position today. I can second guess myself for not selling a portion yesterday as I intended, however I do not see any reason to continuing to hold at the time for a measly dividend. This seems to be dead money for some time unless there is news in the mix that is currently unavailable to retail investors. I may buy back in later but with the market in a strong upward movement I believe there are better options out there where I can recoup some of the losses in a quicker manner. GL to all holders!"
"from S&P, issued 1 March (Hold, $60), when shares were price at $56---my hunch is that the subsequent 10% decline would make the shares a ""BUY"" given solid total gains ability over the next 6-12 months____________We project revenue growth of about 8.7% in2019 -- with some currency headwinds fromcertain operations in Mexico and Canada. Thisassumes a low- to mid-single-digit increase inattendance -- including five domestic parkswhose operating licenses were acquired in May2018 -- aided by continued strong growth inthe Active Pass membership base (recentlyexceeding more than 60% of total visitation).Also, we factor in a low-single-digit increase intotal guest spending per cap, with targetedticket price increases of 3% to 5% partly offsetby lower in-park spending. With incrementalcontributions from nascent sponsorship andinternational licensing, we see revenues up3.0% in 2020.We project 2019 adjusted EBITDA margin of37.6% -- little changed versus 37.8% in 2018.Results should be partly constrained by""significantly lower"" margins at the newlyacquired parks on relatively higher operatingexpenses. Still, we expect a meaningfulrecovery to a 39.0% margin by 2020.After depreciation, amortization and stockcompensation, as well as interest expenses,and with reduced taxes (post-tax reform), weforecast EPS of $2.79 in 2019 and $3.22 in2020.Investment Rationale/RiskDespite a relatively healthy 5% increase inattendance for the Q4 and 2018 full-yearresults, the company in mid-February struck acautious tone on its near-term outlook.Management cited certain delayed parkopenings in China amid a âchallengingmacroeconomic environmentâ, precipitating asharp Q4 decline in some nascent (andotherwise high-growth) revenue streams(including international licensing). Still, we seesome notable bright spots on a continuedstrong growth in the customer loyalty program(Active Pass base). A recent multi-year cycle ofcapital spending on new attractions andacquisitions could sustain a low- to mid-teensreturns on invested capital (ROIC).Risks to our recommendation include a sharpslowdown in U.S. consumer discretionaryspending, dilutive acquisitions, relatively highearnings volatility, and highly disruptiveweather conditions.Our 12-month target price is $60, onEV/EBITDA of 12.7x our 2019 estimate, anotable premium versus peers, while trackingits 10-year average of 12.3x. Also, we notealmost $6 billion in recent carryforward netoperating losses (NOLs) and a 5.9% recentdividend yield on the stock."
"Are kids really still going to Six Flags ? That would mean they have to venture out into the real world and breath fresh air and walk , did not know they still did that . I use to love Six Flags when I was a kid, many moons ago and before video games and the internet . Even thou I have fond memories of Six Flags I think it was a bad investment before Covid ,and now they have been pushed so far backwards financially during this time I really think it is just a matter of time before BK."
seems like it is willing to reverse… higher high and lower lows..summer is coming! I doubled my position at 47 and I am not selling before 60! Great company and good dividends. Long run
"well, worse than even i expected ...the dividend got slashed to 25 cents ... they had to do it .. it was not sustainable. they terminated china park deal due to default in payments. will it ever come back? don't know. will someone else take it over or gov't step in with bailout for the chin real estate company? not looking good. too late to sell. just gotta hope they can turn it around ...."

"""The amusement park company beat on earnings, bringing in 93 cents per share, well above Zacks Consensus Estimate of 28 cents"" They are doing great but are having difficulties with their parks in China this is a buying opportunity."
"SIX gets upgraded, rallies, then goes down. Classic pattern. Short term traders. I had bought more before the upgrade. What's not to like? Big fat dividend. Potential for significant international growth {China, Middle East}, and reasonable valuation.Just give it time ....""Time is on our side ...yes it is....."" ... remember the Rolling Stones song?"
usually i am long and not short .. but today i could not resist and shorted SIX at 20.96
sell this one at $40
Chance to get in at 2016 share prices? Woo hoo!!
"New CEO, seems promising...."
spring and summer will be great. consumers will be traveling and spending. this is an opportunity. JMO

"This seems like a good short play after a double off the Mar 30 low. Huge debt load and low cash position. If you take out the goodwill and intangible assets, there is negative shareholder equity."
"I did not want to be buy, because my position is larger than I would like in my portfolio, but since the price has dropped so much it has compelled me to buy some.FUN is trading in the same direction as SIX for the last week."

Going to Six Flags today as I'm a Season Pass holder & we get dibs on first week opening. Had to make reservations in advance & we must wear masks. Will be interesting wearing a mask on the rides. I currently own $FUN but am interested in $SIX. Will post my thoughts when I return.
"You guys are funny.....the share price has nowhere to go but down.....this bloated debt ridden pig is ripe for the slaughterhouse.....The stock market, housing market, its all peaked...interest rates going up ... free money is coming to an end...whats even worse for this stock is its seasonal....by the time everyone gets vaccinated season will be over in most northern parks...2 seasons lost now....historically for the last 20 years best time to sell this stock is spring....best time to buy August to October....after it get hammered when they blame poor attendance on weather every year.....thats when i used to buy the stock and make a nice profit....but this year I wouldnt do that...I think next time this falls it goes down for the count....dim prospects for a sustainable recovery at six...."
"Well, looks like the computers are driving it to my price point of 41.00, even though for the life of me, still do not understand how trade impacts this stock short term. China expansion will occur whether trade war or not, if the Chinese nationals can make money they will make it happen."
"I cannot take a dividend cut period! For me this is a dividend play only. I am dependent on the income. EPS=3.161 and dividends are .83 per Quarter. 4 X .83 = 3.32. So, More income is needed or drop the dividend some. SIX can't continue paying this dividend forever. I also look for stocks that pay higher than the average gain for the average market. so, as much as I like SIX, I won't buy it until the price drops a bit more. The idea of sailing with a large crowd is a caution these days with a potential plague going around doesn't encourage a potential investor. I am not a short seller or holder of this stock."
Don’t know about the rest of you but I’m starting a position for the inevitable takeover by Disney. Why do you think they brought in the Pepsi guy. 6mths to a year to work out the details and you all get $60/share
"Keep thinking about this but this is too much like watching my retail and fashion plays, they can drop this at a tip of a hat and it is pretty much defenseless until next earnings report. Good luck longs, think it is oversold, but it just hasn't showed me that it can withstand the constant bombardment of false narratives about economy or analysts downgrades. Like I said originally, may look at it once it recovers to the 46/47 range, if things go well, maybe by Christmas. Happy Holidays and don't get too bummed out, it a rigged game and its meant for the small investor to just make enough so he doesn't take his ball and leave the field, they want to milk us slowly."
"I’m thinking analyst upgrades to follow earnings beat, normalizing div ratio.. meaning at least 10% increase in sp over next several weeks.."
Dividend investors will gravitate toward this stock over time. Theme park industry has better dividends than oil stocks and better sustainability.
"Nice, could be another green day today. Cramer recommended FUN over SIX, all the more reason to buy SIX instead..."
"This stocked gapped up big time, if it’s a healthy bullish trend it will fall back down fill the gap and keep going up otherwise they pumped this to get all retail shorts out until it hits single digits. See no value in this stock. Way overpriced just like wayfair W...."
"Sold all of it. I could handle stock falling to 25, but not such a drastic dividend cut. there is next to no redeeming reason to hold this company with low dividend payout and declining forecasts."
"Where will people go for fun when things start improving? When I started thinking about this, there are a lot of risky places out there. I don't feel comfortable with indoor settings - bars, restaurants, movie theaters, etc. all have risks via contact and ventilation systems.I think outdoor venues will recover first, where there should be less risk. I think this makes SIX a good play, and yes, I have invested in it."
they won't cut the dividend. that would cause further price erosion as it would be a sign of lack of confidence going forward. no worries here.
"Bought my first ever shares of SIX today. Went to the Arlington Tx park the first year when the company began. Great memories of the park from many years ago. Also liked what the CEO had to say and like the direction with the new parks planned to open in the future. Recently saw an article that Six Flags introduced the world to Tex Mex many years ago when few were familiar with tacos, enchiladas, guacamole, etc."
why did a director Muchim investment firm but $66 million in stock?
Who is buying this stock?
"Norwegian Cruise Lines up another 13% today!!!!!!Doesn't matter that they have 7B in debt and no one is ever going on a cruise again.BUY BUY BUY!!!!!Identical phenomenon here.This phase that we are currently in, I'd call it DENIAL, will go down in history as one of the most irrational market eras in the last century. There is no way this is going to last.Congrats to whoever picked this up at $10."
"Leadership taking the right steps to secure the long term success of the business, glad to see the announcement today. Can't wait for the parks to open in May and for China expansion to start in Q4 again."
The Wells Fargo analyst downgraded the stock but said dividend appears secure.
Maybe SIX needs to announce that they are going to start selling Meatless burgers or a Burrito and the stock will jump.
I picked up 500 shares this morning. Good dividend. Growth will continue.
"i buy some shares today. and pray the dividend is safe. if it is, then the stock goes higher. if it is not, then the stock goes lower."
"Looks like SIX will soon be yielding 6% again, unfortunately at a share price below $20."
Why is everyone so bearish on this stock? From what I can see outside of an immediate negative earnings report everything is upside. But on the earnings does anybody have any predictions?
"I bought six flags at around $13 without having done much research. Now it's up to $17 and I got into doing some research to figure out if I should ride out this increase and then sell or go long with it and wait it out for a while. I think that they are currently in a pretty good position with 75% of their revenues coming between memorial day and labor day. Also, I think they have taken positive steps to protect themselves from corona by securing available credit and cutting expenses. As they stated, "" the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash obligations until the opening of the 2021 operating season."" What scares me is the position they were in before all of this happened was not a great one, and they have huge amounts of debt that they have to repay in 2023/2024. On top of this, I think there are three very big questions; When will they be allowed to re-open? Will people be scared to go there after they open? and How hard will a recession hurt their attendance? Would love to hear some thoughts and what you think would be a good move in my position."
"This will make a run upwards, no doubt"
"doesn't make any sense.I'm long. I'm in since march and made good money.I'm starting to believe this is a nice point to get out and take profit.Up 123% , almost the same with $FUN and $SAVE.Already sold my Cruise stocks.It was a nice ride.what do you think?Cheers,"
i think we've bottomed ... for awhile ... we've absorbed the bad news ....hopefully mgmt will paint a better picture on conf call and show some confidence by maintaining the dividend ..
Tax loss selling going on.... not many stocks are down this year
"Please, someone explain how this stock continues to rise under the bleakest of outlooks and the pandemic Surging world-wide.How many covid cases is enough to make this market pull back? 200k?300k?500K?I'm not talking Dow 11k or anything. I'm talking about ANYTHING BUT all-time highs.The markets have never been more detached from reality (over 100 years) than they are at this very moment.Utter madness."
"Rumors --- no confirmation that Ive seen- of SIX possibly buying FUN.That might explain the fact that during the last 2 weeks when SIX shares have done nothing but fall, FUN shares have done nothing but rise."
If the parks don't open this summer... Single digits are coming.I for one don't see any way that can happen. Reopening is going to be MUCH slower than people expect and the new normal is going to be highly restrictive.Stock is up over 100% off it's march lows on hope and the Fed. The hope is going to wane.https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/11/asia/china-south-korea-coronavirus-reopening-intl-hnk/index.html
"Honestly, this is laughable. I bought 3,000 shares Friday at $35.78, and will only sell when it hits $45 in a couple of months. Sooner - if they announce they rectified the Chinese issue. I absolutely LOVE these kinds of gifts !!!!!"
"Dividends are safe, although its payout ratio is 100% its because all the money left they do buybacks... so its normal... China represents less than 3% of revenue, although its not a good sotuation to delay and not have the revenue growth, it also dont impact balance sheet."
This hurts the only thing I’m thinking now is to spend money within and not through acquisitions. The land we still hold is growing in value and this form of entertainment can’t be duplicated.
I'm thinking this starts pushing $49 by ex-dividend date.
"Good news!! No more short term debt. Closest expire only in 2024. Also lybor +2% great terms... UK central bank is dovish so it will go down...Also it was mentioned the money will be used, among other things, for buybacks. This means higher EPS and higher dividends. $65 soon"
"This was a gift! Algo's saw the word ""China"" and sold. I sold out of VZ and added more to SIX. With a dividend over 6% at this level, and the booming revenue, its a no-brainer for a dividend play. Also, SIX always recovers from these sell offs. Look for 60+ in a week or saw."
Everytime SIX sells off like this it recovers. I think today is a great day to add!
Maybe I'm just not very intelligent but I don't understand why SIX is still going up. I opened a small short position today at $17 but I wouldn't be surprised if SIX hit $20 by the end of the week. Are people betting on a fast return to normal and full revenues over summer? I just don't see that happening.
Easy recovery to $60 in few days from now...Growth stock with great divided ...
"It appears this will be the stocks direction for the next little while.....a lot can happen.. but I think when this is all over share holders will be wiped out again....i don't see saving a roller coaster as part of any aid packages ....the company already on shaky ground before all this, will fall under the weight of its own debt....There is so much uncertainty and lack of confidence in our government officials.......even if this ended tomorrow and the parks open....crowds would be sparse. On top of health concerns, there's financial, every day that goes by more damage is being done.....theres a lot of preplanning and steps that need to be taken to get the season started...extra costs ....not to mention biggest factor if schools are closed and the school year is extended into the summer....that will be the biggest factor that impedes crowds and revenue.....The parks aren't going away though it's just that someone else will own them....the odds are not in current stakeholders favor....."
"This is oversold, Should go back to at least $60 which would be a ~10% increase +5% dividend. I just bough some at $53+ b/c this is a no brainer at that price."
"How can you enforce the 6 feet apart rule on lines? And on the coasters which seat 4 people next to one another? It’s a crowded place, can’t see them doing a lot of business this summer."
$Six Forty plus for IAG by end of next week! Today to be Up $1++++
They can stay open for all of 2021 without collecting a dime. Uber announced the same thing and went up 50%. SIX is better than a startup pre revenue. This stock goes up from here. I wish I could buy more BUT I already have a Full position.
"If you are still holding this stock, you are living in a dream world. At best, this stock is worth $13 in our current situation."
interest rates going lower...race to the bottom ....sadly ......meanwhile SIX paying over 6% and it's a growth stock as it has big expansion plans. can't beat it as long as they execute ....glta
"doesn't make any sense. I'm long. I'm in since march and made good money.I'm starting to believe this is a nice point to get out and take profit.Up 123% , almost the same with FUN and SAVE. Already sold my Cruise stocks.It was a nice ride. what do you think?Cheers,"
"""What is going on..""Ever heard of:DieBold, dropped to 2 bucks at end of December of last year, stock rose on a decent (not great) report 600% in six weeks.Adient, dropped from the high 80s to 12 bucks, after four analysts (surprisingly all on the same day) came out with upgrades, the stock jumped to 26 in under three weeks, the pursuing earnings report was horrible and the price dropped again, but no where near its low.Bed, Bath and Beyond, dumped to 7 and change, after earnings report again, not great, just good, it jumped 100% in ten weeks.Michael's, dumped to 4 and change, after earnings report again, not great, just good, it jumped 117% in nine weeks.The market beats the tar out of stocks when it has them on the ropes, only after the big money gets their price and their desired number of shares in their pockets do they allow the price to climb. As I said after the report, the company will recover, but it won't be some magical one day climb or some imaginary power hour, it will be a hard road. The big money needs you to get disgusted with this stock, they will push you to your breaking point, they will drop the price hard when the rest of the market explodes, they will drop the price even when the GDP beats expectations, they will drop the price when the Fed drops rates, they will drop prices when the trade deal with China is signed, they will drop it everytime you think it should go up and only after you are beaten down like a sick puppy, will they relent and then they will profit handsomely as they pump it back up."
Here is the Feb 2019 Interview on CNBC. See how that panned out. https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/02/14/six-flags-ceo-share-price-doesnt-align-with-our-record-performance.html
Sometimes risks can make you money! And we do not know what is going to happen next. So i take the risks. If they went bk its my mistake i will take it if they dont went bk this stock will be my long term investment and i will not selling it in the future!
Btw. My charts show me that we topped today so don’t think it is getting back to $45 anytime soon. Sorry.
"Shares trading at 4 yr lows. Four yrs ago, the annualized div was about $2.30/sh, and the shares yielded 5%.Now shares are yielding over 7%, and their revenues are record levels..."
"Buy, collect the dividend, and wait for the price to climb. Easy money"
"Several things to pay attention to:1. Very heavy Insider buying of SIX shares. Directors and CEO bought around 50 million dollars worth of shares just now. 2. The decrease in profit from 2018 to 2019 was due to a 1 time occurence of additional expenses, it was not operational profit decrease. Revenue actually went up. 3. Dividend getting cut by new management is actually a GOOD thing. Why? Because now all that profit is going to go into growing the business. The new dividend rate of 4%+ is extremely sustainable. 4. Will people go to Six Flags? Guess what folks - Wait time both forecasted and live in Six Flags is checable online! There is a website that shows Six Flags Magic Mountain wait times by ride. Guess what - ""Full Throtle"" had a wait time of 60 minutes today in line. People are going to Six Flags."
Six Flags is up 11.07% to 22.77
If this is 15% of my portfolio would you recommend selling or holding?
"Question: Why did SIX gain 60% in April? Ans: So that it can fall 50% in May, it is a roller coaster after all. Roller coaster ."
Is anyone else concerned that the new CEO might not want to pay such a large dividend which is essentially equal to the Company's free cash flow? If the Company were to cut the dividend I am afraid that the stock price would REALLY tank. Just curious if anyone else shares my concern.
Come and get it folks!!! 2.4 Billion of debt and no cash flow!!! Woo Hoo!!!
We will close above 52 today. Slight dip is always needed for a bigger boost in the future.
"Six Flags stock has crashed 50% in the last 15 months, while market is way up"
Everyone just realized that the default in China is pennies in the grand scheme.
Great buy here.. a little better yesterday... season gonna be getting up to speed soon and great div yield
Six Flags buy Seaworld ??? I highly doubt it. I think it makes more sense for Seaworld to merge with Red Lobster ....
didnt someone say on the conference call that they would be more transparent. I havent read any updates on what their plan is to deal with the virus issue. Is there a plan? Are they going to sit and pray it goes away? investors want to know....thank u
"There has been so instance of a DIV cut for SIX shareholders, since at least 2010 - a Decade of sustained growth in div.To be sure, the rise in div is likely to be stalled till the next growth hits the bottom line, but barring a 2008 meltdown, there is every reason to believe that the current $3.28/yr payout will continue in 2020."
"When most of the retailers are out, it's the time for institutions to push the price higher! Long HOLD for reopening boom!!!"
Been trading in and out of this for about 20 years.....if you look at the long term chart this is predictable sells off every year at this time ....this year probably more then usual because the expectations were higher......cant imagine the big institutional holders aren't taking this for a ride playing the trend...big buys into the spring and summer then the dump usually use the excuse (weather) for missing expectations..then they come out in a few months and say spooky world was a big success ....then the stock starts to recover.....
"Just hold and add more, dont expect a big jump for a while."
"this company is so disappointing. I have been following it for many years and it never fails to take my hard earned $. Lets see if the new leadership can make some positive statements and provide a good action plan to grow this company, otherwise its time to part ways."
No masks Means more funMore Fun= more profits.Buy Buy Buy
"This isn’t a day trade stock. If you want a fast 50% you’re in the wrong place, if such a place exists. If you want a solid return over the next 5 years and a nice divi to top it off, then hit cruise control and relax a bit."
what is saving this company is that interest rates are low and will be for a long time. gives them time to fix this and afford the divvy
"Hi guys,2 days were not so good for Six flags. I started to read again Q2 results and want to remind you that things are improving and Q3 should bring some profit instead of loosing cash. Here are the facts from Q2. The liquidity position as of June 30 was $756 million. This included $460 million of available revolver capacity, net of $21 million of letters of credit and $296 million of cash.Cash burning rate is $25 million per month, a significant improvement compared to the average $30 million to $35 million per month that we projected on our last earnings call.We now have 14 of 26 parks open."
Can someone explain why this is up today 10%
Earnings BEAT Wall Street expectations by .04.. active pass base UP 5% .. going up tomorr
I understand that it did not beat expectations but it still did better than previous years. Land is not getting cheaper and competition is not going to pop up that fast.Im here for the long ride.
"Alright, I bought in earlier than planned, but this looks like a legit move, hope I am right."
always wait out the first 20-30 minutes when news is involved in a stock whether there is crazy selling or buying going on and then make your decisions. always be level headed when buying or selling whether the price is going up or down. It will find a level and you will have plenty of time to trade
"Should announce dividend between 11/8 - 11/15: If dividend goes up, as it has in Novembers past, should see a nice increase in share price. If dividend stays the same, should retrace some of these losses. If dividend gets cut, look out below. Although, some of a div cut may already be factored in. Hoping for the best."
nothing negative on conference call that would prompt this reaction. this is an opportunity to pick up shares ...
"Analyst Tim Conder of Wells Fargo recently put a $17 price target on the stock, noting that among surveyed guests, only ""80% would come in 2020 if appropriate protective measures are adequately implemented."" He also noted that he expected the second half of 2020 revenues to be ~35% of 2019's levels, and for revenue to fully recover to 2019 levels only in 2022."
"If they can continue paying the dividend the new money I added will be at 9% plus dividend. I was also able to drop my cost basis considerably. I think Monday if the market goes up it will carry SIX up with it, now that some of the questions have most likely been answered."
"Keep buying December calls on the dips, seems to be working so far"
Doubled my position today. Great dividend and long term growth prospects.
"The stocks fair valuation appears to be around $45. Some bad news today, but clearly not devastating. Overreaction, it will climb back"
"Bought in today, first time with SIX, new position, Covid’s over and everything’s opening"
"Interesting how many bears comment on this stock. I’m not really persuaded it’s heading lower, however. I listened to the earnings call, and management made it pretty clear they don’t need much to break even, and that they’ve taken appropriate measures to cut costs where possible. It’s also not at all true that they are not taking in revenue—they are, though seasonal passes that people are paying for and, as of the call, haven’t cancelled. Finally, some 90 percent of all customers live within 150 miles of each park, so they don’t have to fly to get there, and states are now opening up. In sum, it doesn’t take much to make a (somewhat) positive case for the future of SIX."
"The Dividend is now ""really"" 6.26% (SIX shares @ $52.39)That is the highest yield for SIX shares in over 5 years.And, the CEO left no doubt that the payout was solid and secure.At&T has a similar yield, but may not have the same growth prospects."
"It has been years since I even looked at SIX and I was supervised to see the stock price so high given the situation . I seen the price even jumped on the news that they were going to open all their sights, but in limited capacity. I remember years ago, well before covid ,they were having trouble making money while at full capacity . Now today ,to my surprise, I see them at these levels and it really makes me scratch my head ."
"Bottom feeding has been great this past year. CCL 5 year low, bought at $40, now $50. Expedia at $95, now $110, FEDEX $137, now $159, and FIVE this week was a gift at $97.Six is a buy and hold for 6 months, it will get back in favour, maybe $42, or 20% gain."
How do you guys think the stock will react after the dividend is distributed?
"The Trading Volume today is insane, is everyone loading the boat?"
"stock price will be much higher when new parks open in roughly three years time. until then, i am happy to continue to collect the fat dividend. dividend will eventually go up with new parks coming online. just give it time."
I am so pleased to have loaded the boat at the lows of $42. it's going to be a great year in 2020
"Not sure if I see a new low, though I am a bit surprised that they have been able to drop the price on this stock when of any sector that is pretty much immune to trade concerns should be amusement parks, though I know they associate the opening of the first Chinese park to the overall trade tensions, but the park isn't open yet and therefore not really impacting revenues or earnings and wouldn't be for some time either way."
Hold on to your shares! SIX is estimated to produce a profit of .32 cents per share for the 3rd Qtr. It's only going up from here on out. Good luck to all Longs.
"Why would this go down like this. The 40% upside dividend yield, this seems like a golden goose. Is there a downside risk that I’m missing ??? Someone tell me anything negative here?"
"from Reuters:Exclusive: Six Flags in bid to acquire Cedar Fair-sourcesReuters Reuters•October 2, 2019(Reuters) - U.S. theme park operator Six Flags Entertainment Corp has approached peer Cedar Fair LP with an acquisition offer, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.Cedar Fair is considering Six Flags' cash-and-stock offer, and there is no certainty that a deal will be reached, the sources said. Details of the offer could not be learned.The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment."
There had to be some good reason that insiders bought close to a million dollars worth of the shares at market when share price was approximately $49---that's when I started to accumulate
A drop of 18% is way over done; when well over 90% of the their revenue is domestic sourced. Bump in the road. Will climb back in the 40s. Currently a great buying opportunity.
bought some more today ...now gonna kick back and watch the dividends come in as i wait for additional park openings throughout the world. i am sure they are not done expanding. plenty of room for additional growth in China and rest of the world. The dividend will go higher too as money comes in from additional park openings ....
Anyone think it's odd that this is trading above where it was in October 2019...Before taking on Another B in debt...They went bankrupt before under better conditions... No?Yes.
how soon do we see $5? I give it within a month so by end of April....what is your estimate?
Bought a handful of more shares today. 50 is very doable in the next few months here with this momentum.
"Will buy at $5....good luck. Even after vaccine comes out it will be quite a bit of time (few years) till they start getting the same traffic. This pandemic is no joke, that no one alive today has experienced in their lives. People will keep their kids and themselves away from the park until majority of folks are vaccinated, few years ahead. Not worth risking your life for a day of rides."
"almost 10% dividend, PE ratio great, business in profit and growth. What else do you want?"
"Yee Haw!!! $4 more till this is back to pre-pandemic levels in Feb.Not much difference in the business now... Just getting crushed under another 1B in debt (what's another B?), parks more or less all closed. Revenues down 90% YoY. Hemorrhaging cash to the tune of 25M a month.Vaccine will take a full year to roll out assuming there are no hiccups in the process so nothing is going to change here in the short to mid-term.Stock on the verge of doubling in about a month under these conditions.BUY BUY BUY!!!!!"
"People so quickly forget, Six was in troublebefore the pandemic. Why wouldanyone own this."
"Wow, dividend of 7.11%....it could go to 8% though, smh."
"I'm curious, does anyone have a feel for the real value of their real estate portfolio, I know the majority of their theme parks are near or in large MAPs, though I know they tend to be on the outskirts of these areas for the very reason of low cost land. Though as with many things to include retail stores that have been in areas for decades, sometimes the cities build up around the entity and the value of the property becomes more valuable than the business."
"The good news with these drops is that management can’t use this stock to make acquisitions ,but instead to focus on organic growth."
i am buying this at 5 year low lol.
started a position today in SIX
"A few things...yes, the news was not good. I am going to stick with it though. The park in Saudi Arabia is 2.5x the size of Disney World. That's still on track for 2023. Six Flags does not have money invested in overseas ventures. They have licensing and management revenue streams. This goes straight to bottom line. If parks in China never open, this will definitely hurt their growth plans. But there will not be current losses beyond what they took in Q4. China gov't wants these parks, and Riverside is ""partnered"" with Chinese gov't. So while there will be delays while some wrangling goes on, I do expect some or all of this development to be completed ...eventually. I do think the dividend is at risk. And the other big disappointment was soft comparable 4Q revenue. This is tough, but I am here for long haul and think ultimately SIX prevails ....GLTA"
"I believe that an investor with patience buy between $50-$52 will be rewarded greatly. Just buy it and put it away.Collect your 6.6% dividend while you wait. This stock is way out of favor so will take some time to gain momentum, but should start up just before next quarters earnings are released.Only thing that can hurt this company is if oil jumps over $80."
"if they cut the dividend, it could hurt the stock more ...it will be interesting to see what the company does ..interesting and painful"
Only bright side is that my dividends will be invested at a lower share price.
"If this was great news today on the debt re-structuring wouldn't the stock be up today? Issuing junk bonds and debt on top of a mountain of debt may be the only option. Diluting shares would most likely trigger a death spiral in share price. It seems like they are just kicking the can down the road as they should be. The lenders probably feel like they have no other choice but to try and work with Six at this point. The fate of the parks will ultimately be decided by the operations and revenue. If they don't open and cant service the debt they will be bankrupt. This company is a one trick pony with a broken leg. Unlike Disney and other companies that have other revenue streams, Six is relying solely on the gate. I think the day of reckoning is coming for shareholders because it doesn't seem the current share price reflects the level of uncertainty surrounding this situation."
"With today's news of record breaking unemployment and great job report, the general population has tons of extra income to blow on amusement parks. This should allow SIX to raise prices and keep the cash registers flowing this year. And a rocketing stock price."
amazing the market cap got cut 20% over a China project which is just a sliver of the whole company probably less that a 1/2 of a percent of revenues
Today sold 30.000 stocks @26. Let's see if i was wrong or right after 50% gain in 2 weeks. I would have kept them but better not risk.....What do you think ?
Holding on to 75000 shares bought at $41.00. Collecting the divy forever. No need to worry what Mr. Market does.
Beat everything!!! Low unemployment and higher wages will make this go to $80 in the summer
I would expect SIX to move up $3-5 on a China trade deal
"david, the only question that I would have to ask is why would you sell the day before ex-div when you can sell it two days later and get a very nice dividend that you are going to pay 15% tax rate on anyway. It would be foolish to sell for tax loss at this point."
I'm seeing things is SIX green?
I read the earnings transcript and I really liked what the management has done. They mentioned that the burn rate while parks are closed is 30 millions a month which gives more then enough room to survive the year with current financial means and with very little additional income. I think in 2 years time and in case we get a vaccine it is quite probable that the price is back at around 40$ with a good sized dividend and in 5 years 60$ aka 200% upside is very probable. Long story short I opened a small long position today at a price of 20$
