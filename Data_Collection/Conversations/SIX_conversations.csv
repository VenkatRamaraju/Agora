"""H Partners boosted its position in the amusement-park operator, as it ""continues to be optimistic about [Six Flags'] long-term prospects."" H Partners acquired 100,000 Six Flags shares on Aug. 19 and Aug. 20 at prices of $37.68 to $39.18. H Partners now holds 7,900,000 Six Flags shares, equal to 9.2% of the outstanding stock."""
Just in time for fright fest….when they bring back that 6% dividend I’ll buy lmao…
Smart people love this stock.Smart people are vaccinated.
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on What*sapp>>>>>>> +447901191306 or Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"
Check out my analysis on $SIX:https://ericthomson.substack.com/p/six-flags-entertainment-corporation?r=fgeno&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=copy
Crushed earnings as expected. 2022 they expect 500-600 million per year which gives us a P/E ratio in the single digits. Very cheap!!
Guess someone did not like this report?
Ouch down 8%
Anyone still in the park after all of this needs their heads examined. You had all the time in the world to get out of SIX FLAGS!
"SIX has $2.5B in debt, far in excess of its market cap. It is slated to continue to lose money, most likely through next year. All those foreging expansion projects? Not happening any time soon. So what is there to be excited about?"
Hurry Close the Parks for wInter.Cut costs Thanks
Six Flags Entertainment is up 5.73% to 44.46
"The Dividend is now ""really"" 6.26% (SIX shares @ $52.39)That is the highest yield for SIX shares in over 5 years.And, the CEO left no doubt that the payout was solid and secure.At&T has a similar yield, but may not have the same growth prospects."
"Had a great day at Six Flags today! They checked our temperatures, cleaned the rides between turns & had plenty of sanitizer available stationed throughout the park. Everyone wore masks, but you were able to take them off on the rides...most including I... just pulled them down under our chins during the ride. Lines weren't long...the longest was Thunder River at a 40 min wait. They had the 6 foot stickers to control the 6 foot rule for all lines to a ride. All-in-all, well worth the visit & I have already made 2 more reservations for upcoming dates. Our Six Flag water park opens July 10th & I made reservations to visit it too. I believe if you visit Six Flags once this summer, you will feel safe & happy enough to visit again."
Earnings beat! Stock down as usual! Time to BUY!!!
"Where will people go for fun when things start improving? When I started thinking about this, there are a lot of risky places out there. I don't feel comfortable with indoor settings - bars, restaurants, movie theaters, etc. all have risks via contact and ventilation systems.I think outdoor venues will recover first, where there should be less risk. I think this makes SIX a good play, and yes, I have invested in it."
"ZERO flags needs to bring back that big dividend, lol…"
Six Flags Entertainment is down 5.84% to 43.50
"Several things to pay attention to:1. Very heavy Insider buying of SIX shares. Directors and CEO bought around 50 million dollars worth of shares just now. 2. The decrease in profit from 2018 to 2019 was due to a 1 time occurence of additional expenses, it was not operational profit decrease. Revenue actually went up. 3. Dividend getting cut by new management is actually a GOOD thing. Why? Because now all that profit is going to go into growing the business. The new dividend rate of 4%+ is extremely sustainable. 4. Will people go to Six Flags? Guess what folks - Wait time both forecasted and live in Six Flags is checable online! There is a website that shows Six Flags Magic Mountain wait times by ride. Guess what - ""Full Throtle"" had a wait time of 60 minutes today in line. People are going to Six Flags."
"Never would consider myself the panic selling type, but I unloaded my entire position today. I can second guess myself for not selling a portion yesterday as I intended, however I do not see any reason to continuing to hold at the time for a measly dividend. This seems to be dead money for some time unless there is news in the mix that is currently unavailable to retail investors. I may buy back in later but with the market in a strong upward movement I believe there are better options out there where I can recoup some of the losses in a quicker manner. GL to all holders!"
