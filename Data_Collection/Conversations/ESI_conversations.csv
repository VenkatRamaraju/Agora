ITT Tech and ACICS debacle were in Inside Higher Education Today. https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/08/04/tough-times-itt-tech-accreditation-line
"It's nice to have someone to talk to.For the record I deal in value stocks , and have no insider information. However I am a tecnition and deal with in the money options without some exceptions. At present I hold 47 September 20's at $2.86 , The next question your going to ask me is why?? Option's can only be purchased with cash. So no margin interest but similar leverage,also only purchase short term, usually two months ( very small premiums) if necessary can easily rollover. As you can see my % profit is fairly good for small investment."
YeeeeHa!!!!!!!!!!
"Wondering where this piggy might bounce, besides into the roaster. I'm thinking Tuesday after a moderate fall to around .40 might be a place to start. I know it's risky, but we could see a bounce to .70"
"Gap closed, looking to resume trend."
"Up a few hundred percent on my options so far May $20's mostly, Some Feb $20's as well and a few Aug 30's"
Foster I to purchased in the money calls but only short term with small premiums Have 48 July small premium easy to roll over. Up 2300 today. Premium today was 10 cents picked up 6 cents for plus 2300+

"ESI has a plan in motion which I think will surprise most people. Their strategy to cut recruiting expenses was mentioned publicly back in July, along with projected reductions in general. This will create the cash necessary for the LC demands, and they can maintain accreditation by removing the programs and locations lagging behind the benchmarks. They're still eligible for GI bill funding everywhere except CA, and I think the decision to not enroll new students reduces pressure from the VA to align with ED until ESI can ""clean up."" Insider sell off would be much higher if they knew back in July that the ruling would force bankruptcy."
"ESI is halted ""news pending"".I guess completely shutting down the schools wasn't news enough."

"HOW TO KILL A COMPANY without proving a single allegation!Say what you will about the Obama Administration, it isn’t slowing down as it heads for the exits. The Education Department wants to put as many for-profit colleges as possible out of business, and last week it gave ITT Technical Institute a de facto death sentence. The ITT story is worth telling because it shows how a regulatory assault can kill a company without proving a single allegation. The department first targeted ITT in August 2014 when it put the school on probation and demanded an irrevocable $80 million letter of credit. This was a signal for some 20 state Attorneys General, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to pounce, probing everything from the college’s student recruitment and graduate job placement to its third-party private student loan program. ITT denies their allegations, but that is irrelevant when the feds have marked you for termination. The investigations triggered a review by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, which in April threatened to withdraw ITT’s accreditation because the government litigation challenged the company’s financial viability. The Education Department then used the accreditor’s warning as the reason to raise its collateral demand to $123 million.ITT has also warned investors that it might not be able to meet the department’s financial metrics because “a significant amount of the Company’s cash is and will be held” in an escrow account with the department. So putting up the cash collateral has made it more difficult, if not impossible, to fulfill other regulatory demands. How’s that for a Catch-22?In July ITT notified investors that it expected new student enrollment in the fall to drop from 45% to 60%, after falling by half to 45,000 since 2010. Revenues have shrivelled to $850 million. The department announced last week it would delay federal student aid disbursements and cut off aid to new enrollees. These actions alone could precipitate ITT’s demise, but department regulators have MADE BANKRUPTCY EVEN MORE LIKELY by demanding $153 million more in collateral in 30 days. If the company fails to comply, the department CAN REVOKE FEDERAL AID for CURRENT students. This would likely force the immediate closure of all 130 some ITT campuses. Hundreds of millions of dollars of student loans could be eligible for discharge. Unlike in a corporate bankruptcy, the company won’t control its dissolution. The government has barred “out of the ordinary expenditures without department approval.” Money held in escrow won’t be available to creditors.The department justifies all this in the name of protecting taxpayers who finance student loans, but an ITT bankruptcy could strand thousands of students who have already borrowed to attend but would get no degree. When the feds killed Corinthian Colleges in 2014, they triggered a chaotic collapse that has resulted in more than $170 million in student debt relief. Taxpayers may get a similar bill for ITT. As recently as January 2014 parent company ITT Educational Services ’s shares traded at more than $45, but on Monday they were worth 45 cents. The government has never had to prove its claims in court. When angry voters refer to a “lawless” government, this is what they mean. - WSJ Aug 29, 2016"
"Wow, good move Modany. Now ESI has no employ expenses and no students to deal with but still has $70 million in cash and building worth $100 million or so.ESI did not declare bankruptcy because they are NOT bankrupt!"

close the door and turn off light. A classical example how any company with no respect to her financials and operation success can be destroyed by the politicians. If tomorrow e.g. the government wants to kill AAPL they are able to do it too. The stock market is nothing more than a big speculation. What I do not get why the government wants to destroy american education. Probably it is easier to control uneducated people.

"Check out this blog from ""HOMEROOM"", the official blog of the U.S. Department of Education:The U.S. Department of Education blog says:Question: ""I already completed my degree at ITT. Is it worthless?ED: ""No. You completed your degree at an operational and accredited institution. Nobody can take away your credentials or the skills you gained.""Question: I already completed my ITT program but I feel like I was defrauded. Can I get my money back?ED: ""The actions we’re taking against ITT today are based on the operational and financial risk they pose to students and taxpayers, not on a finding that they defrauded students. There are, however, a number of open federal and state investigations into ITT campuses. If those investigations find evidence of fraud or other illegal behavior surrounding your specific program, you might be eligible for relief. You can also go to Federal Student Aid’s borrower defense page to learn more about how to file a claim if you believe the school misled you.""Do you get the feeling that the DOE is setting up students to tell them they can't get debt relief because there has been ""no evidence that ESI defrauded students"". If someone does find fraud, then students MIGHT be eligible for relief.The ED must comprise the lowest of the low government employees!They screw students by closing their school, then tell them the SCHOOL DID NOTHING WRONG (as far as they know). Bernie Madoff would be proud of the ED.On top of that, the ED says their actions were taken based on financial risk! The ONLY financial risk ESI had was from the ED stealing ESI's money. ESI would be in fine financial shape now if the ED had not intervened!How many nutcases does it take to make a Department of Education? Not many.ESI is a lot better off without the ED bloodsuckers to ravage them.Students? Never trust the ED."

BK may be a blessing in disguise if you are long at a reasonable entry price as there are 11M shorts that need to cover in order to cash in their profit. Yes it could dip under 30c but it could also spike to $1-$2. I've seen it before and could happen with ESI especially during a short squeeze.
ACICS and ESI Meeting Tomorrow
"Looks like the ESI saga will go on for possibly years.Assets = $585 millionLiabilities = $420 million, means ESI has $6 of shareholder valueandITT might sue the ED.""But the bigger issue is going to be the likely litigation that ITT will bring against the Department of Education. The school, like many other for-profit institutions, has been under investigation by state and federal authorities for a while, as concerns rose that such schools represent a poor cost-benefit proposition for students. But the immediate cause of ITT’s shutdown was the Department of Education’s decision last month to prohibit ITT from enrolling new students in federal aid programs.ITT has already telegraphed its intent to sue the department over its actions, calling them “unwarranted” and “unconstitutional.” Such a lawsuit might form the basis for any payout to ITT’s creditors, and perhaps even shareholders, because it is hard to believe that its other assets will result in real value. Its 10-Q securities filing in July showed assets of $584.9 million, stacked against total liabilities of $419.8 million, but some of those assets include about $52 million in student loans and $134.4 million in “property and equipment.”"

Having said that I'm surprised the sale did not provide a catalyst for the share price."

King Jr.""Good Luck with that appeal!"

"There's a lot to like here, a sensible profitable value play trading at relatively low multiples.

Bought some Nov $25 calls and looking forward to strong guidance for 2022. Excellent write up by Simply Wall St. on why it's a safe bet -- management has skin in the game and they are demonstrating strong fiduciary responsibility."
"What has happened to this stock? Is there some underlying issue that I don't know about? This stock was hot, then it got warm, then it looked like we we off to the races with all of those upgrades.

"Here's what I think Modany should do.First: he should immediately cease all activity at all ESI school. He should tell everyone to go home, students, teachers, administrators, etc.He should shut everything down. No more school.Second: He should get on his private jet and head off to his Caribbean hideaway under the protection of some dictator.So what would happen? Let's see.All of the students who paid their own money to go to the school would be screwed. Or would they? The students receiving Title IV funds, however, would fare much better. Since, through no fault of their own, the school shut down, they would be eligible to have all of their loans forgiven by the evil ED. They would lose no money, just time.Say 75% of the 40,000 students at ESI received $30,000 in Title IV loans to attend ESI. That would mean the ED doled out (30,000 students X $30,000) = $900,000,000.Also, many former students would come forward and claim that they also got a bad deal at ESI and they could file a ""defense to repayment"" claim. Let's say about 100,000 students file these claims at $30,000 each. That's additional $3,000,000,000 the ED would have to dole out to creditors.So far, we have $3,900,000,000 that the ED is on the hook for.Just to make sure all the students got back ALL the money they paid to ESI, Modany could send a letter (from the safety of his Caribbean dictator's hideaway) substantiating all of the complaints that students have made over the years. He would admit that some people (not him) were scamming ALL of the students who ever attended ESI over its 40 year history.Now the ED would be on the hook for about $50 Billion or more.Then he could just chuckle to himself and take another sip of his margarita."

Why did ESI file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy instead of Chapter 11?Because Chapter 11 is for companies that want to reorganize and stay in business.ESI obviously was not going to be allowed by the ED to reorganize and stay in business.There is no way the ED would approve ESI for Title IV funds.So it make sense that ESI opted for Chapter 7 (Liquidation) bankruptcy.The Chapter 7 filing does not mean that ESI is bankrupt in the sense that no funds will be available to shareholders (although this may be the case). It's entirely possible that a liquidated ESI will have some payout to shareholders. Happy trading to all!

Market up and a drop of .12 cents or 5.5% means this company is headed back down. Let the Zhangs buy this toxic waste. They have lost much more on other stupid investments.
I bought a bunch of this for $11 at the end of last summer. The addition of the water treatment organic chemicals plus lots of insider buying convinced me this would take off. Now I’m holding for another year because there’s no reason it shouldn’t double again. There are manufacturers and labs that rely on tons of this stuff and they apparently like this vendor. I know options are dag sexy but don’t yinz guys like to tuck away some solid assets?
"I'm here looking four some insight on this stock had about 5000 shares took 4800 profit still holding about 500 shares will most likely pick up some in the money 30 to 45 day in the money options,don't have any idea about its future but the technicals look great."
"This is an intriguing buy, and Fibonacci alone spells out at least a 10% pop short term."
"OK. I am going to throw in my .02 worth which is actually worth -.02 for intents... I do find it interesting that the SEC filings were all amended to show Father Zhangs address in China instead of Young Zhangs address only (the CA address)(previous docs seemed to show citizenship of both to China but not the elders China address). This stock is going to bubble on volume only as there is no big announcements being made by the company, The ED or ACICS at this time. The show cause meeting in my opinion is likely to be a non issue as it appears on the surface that ESI still maintains the standards... now... with that said..the downsizing as I have seen is of concern as the staffing may not meet the accrediting standards in some areas. It will be interesting to see how this end plays out during the time of re-accrediting which I believe for the majority of locations is at the EOCY17. Also take into account that should the regime be changed in Washington come Nov16 (Jan17), it could mark a very large reversal in how this plays out with ED chasing the for profit market in general. From the information I have gathered there was a marked change in operation from the time of leadership change at the top, perhaps getting back to the roots instead of expansion and max saturation would bring these guys back into an environment that is more like people report that it was prior to this leadership. One can only speculate on anything at this point though. IF nothing else changes and ED continues its long reach to push the FP Ed industry to the ground... it will be interesting (some may say comical) to watch the Two Clan Zhang buy up what appears to be another non profitable venture like their vacant apartment enterprise that flourished."

ITT Tech (or whatever the new name is) could become a new entity, a school, a REIT, etc.Will ITT be sold off in pieces or as a whole?With the American economy doing well, and real estate doing well, ESI's properties are a hot item.Modany is already rich but he does have millions of shares of ESI stock.
