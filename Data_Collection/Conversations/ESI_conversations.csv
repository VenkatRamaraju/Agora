"The Obama Administration did current and future students a HUGE favor by protecting them from this scam. It has been proven time and time again that this diploma mill is a fraud. Pumpers Like JS are crooks who have profited of the misery of this failing scam. Crime doesn't pay, and that's why this school has been terminated."
"The ED is effectively forcing ESI to declare bankruptcy.By requiring ESI to put up $200 million which they obviously do not have, the ED is shutting ESI down.ESI's best move might be to declare bankruptcy now and get it over with.The ED has done it's job again (ala Corinthian). The ED goal is threefold:1. Make sure the US government will not have to pay off student loans2. Show ACICS who is boss.3. Cause chaos for students.Next step, Cerberus tries to get it's money in court."
ESI! YAY! keep it going!So pleased. Great company!

ESI earnings. Ho hum. Does it really matter? But...2016 EBITDA guidance raised from $110 million to $125 million.Earnings were 18 cents/share.ESI transitioning to a much smaller school.

"HOW TO KILL A COMPANY without proving a single allegation!Say what you will about the Obama Administration, it isn’t slowing down as it heads for the exits. The Education Department wants to put as many for-profit colleges as possible out of business, and last week it gave ITT Technical Institute a de facto death sentence. The ITT story is worth telling because it shows how a regulatory assault can kill a company without proving a single allegation. The department first targeted ITT in August 2014 when it put the school on probation and demanded an irrevocable $80 million letter of credit. This was a signal for some 20 state Attorneys General, the Securities and Exchange Commission and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to pounce, probing everything from the college’s student recruitment and graduate job placement to its third-party private student loan program. ITT denies their allegations, but that is irrelevant when the feds have marked you for termination. The investigations triggered a review by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools, which in April threatened to withdraw ITT’s accreditation because the government litigation challenged the company’s financial viability. The Education Department then used the accreditor’s warning as the reason to raise its collateral demand to $123 million.ITT has also warned investors that it might not be able to meet the department’s financial metrics because “a significant amount of the Company’s cash is and will be held” in an escrow account with the department. So putting up the cash collateral has made it more difficult, if not impossible, to fulfill other regulatory demands. How’s that for a Catch-22?In July ITT notified investors that it expected new student enrollment in the fall to drop from 45% to 60%, after falling by half to 45,000 since 2010. Revenues have shrivelled to $850 million. The department announced last week it would delay federal student aid disbursements and cut off aid to new enrollees. These actions alone could precipitate ITT’s demise, but department regulators have MADE BANKRUPTCY EVEN MORE LIKELY by demanding $153 million more in collateral in 30 days. If the company fails to comply, the department CAN REVOKE FEDERAL AID for CURRENT students. This would likely force the immediate closure of all 130 some ITT campuses. Hundreds of millions of dollars of student loans could be eligible for discharge. Unlike in a corporate bankruptcy, the company won’t control its dissolution. The government has barred “out of the ordinary expenditures without department approval.” Money held in escrow won’t be available to creditors.The department justifies all this in the name of protecting taxpayers who finance student loans, but an ITT bankruptcy could strand thousands of students who have already borrowed to attend but would get no degree. When the feds killed Corinthian Colleges in 2014, they triggered a chaotic collapse that has resulted in more than $170 million in student debt relief. Taxpayers may get a similar bill for ITT. As recently as January 2014 parent company ITT Educational Services ’s shares traded at more than $45, but on Monday they were worth 45 cents. The government has never had to prove its claims in court. When angry voters refer to a “lawless” government, this is what they mean. - WSJ Aug 29, 2016"
"@landmanre Since you and I are the only ones who visit this message board, I guess I will just discuss the earnings report with you alone. Everything looked in order to me and it all looked positive. I am extremely impressed by the kind of revenue growth they had before including the recent acquisition. The next quarter should include everything and should be stellar. Perhaps we will break through that $24.00 wall tomorrow and hit new all time highs!"
"Major breakout, I’m in!"
I’ve been reading your posts and consider selling a November 22 put. Thanks for your insights
"I worked for this company; generally good employees at the local level, but the administration was not good. While I feel for my colleagues still working there, the national folks deserve the collapse and more. Fraud and deception was everywhere."
Why is there no one intrested in having a conversation about what's going on with this stock.
I wish they would not halt these things for the entire day. Its not fair for those pole who want to sell are stuck with there shares for even a possibly larger loss tomorrow.
"Looks like recent shorts being covered before earnings, I see 20+ post earnings jmho"
"The stock has done nothing for over 4 years, and the company hasn't been able to find a way to grow organically. I guess this is what happens when you put kids in charge who have been fed everything in life from a silver spoon. It's clear Ben and Carey are holding this company back and are flying from the seat of their pants without a clue as to what they're doing. Steer clear until a change in management inevitably occurs!"
We play the game differently. I buy in the money September 20's lesspremium less of a risk make money on smaller moves can role it over easily. Purchased at 3.7066 last 3.60
I bought a bunch of this for $11 at the end of last summer. The addition of the water treatment organic chemicals plus lots of insider buying convinced me this would take off. Now I’m holding for another year because there’s no reason it shouldn’t double again. There are manufacturers and labs that rely on tons of this stuff and they apparently like this vendor. I know options are dag sexy but don’t yinz guys like to tuck away some solid assets?
Today will be a HUGE day and expect in this one single day that all or most shorts will cover after waiting 1-2 years. 46% of outstanding shares are short - 11M. Cash value of company is $6.87 so you decide what a fair price is - hint -- a lot more than 36 cents. Good luck and even if you buy at 50 cents and sell at $1 today you did good.
Element Solutions is up 5.24% to 19.87
Bullish from here. ITT needs to reconstruct their program and retrain staff.
"What has happened to this stock? Is there some underlying issue that I don't know about? This stock was hot, then it got warm, then it looked like we we off to the races with all of those upgrades. Studently we turn around and it has dropped from 24 to 21 and just sits here. Note, no news of any kind for months now. The press release of the buyout completion was just a notification, it wasn't exactly news. I can't figure?"
chart says accumulation by institution today June 11. forward p/e is 16
"I'm here looking four some insight on this stock had about 5000 shares took 4800 profit still holding about 500 shares will most likely pick up some in the money 30 to 45 day in the money options,don't have any idea about its future but the technicals look great."
seems like a great stock
yes Manuel the first day is bad the next days the share price wil climbing......
How many jobs we lost? This is how it works when DEMS aka socialists at work.
"another run is bound to happen soon, cannot consolidate forever stay strong!!"
What college doesn't get students in a pile of debt. What a crock DoE is.
"ESI, Stopped the enrollment and will file Bankruptcy soon, the stock will be Deleted."
Element Solutions is up 6.20% to 21.93
"There's a lot to like here, a sensible profitable value play trading at relatively low multiples. My only concerns are their margins aren't great and revenue somewhat flat (but eps is steadily improving). And they have some debt, but it's serviceable. Bought some Nov $25 calls and looking forward to strong guidance for 2022. Excellent write up by Simply Wall St. on why it's a safe bet -- management has skin in the game and they are demonstrating strong fiduciary responsibility."
"My company, so pleased!"
Half a million traded at .25 cents in the last 10 minutes of trading.
"I've been following this company for a while without taking a position. It is possible that management was piling on the bad news to repurchase shares at a lower price. The ackman deal was not the entire repurchase plan. They still have 42% of the approved repurchase plan remaining, and a projected EPS of .82-.87 for the year. Having said that I'm surprised the sale did not provide a catalyst for the share price."
Element Solutions is up 9.31% to 10.80
Cramer just did a nice piece on ESI during Mad Money. It was a couple minutes at least. He says buy.
Nice pre market let's see what happens at opening.
