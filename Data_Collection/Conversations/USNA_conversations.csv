"This is a big buying opportunity, the 100 day crackdown on direct selling in China wasn’t mentioned by USNA but was in HLF and NUS’s filings, must mean USNA isn’t affected. Don’t think BabyCare’s numerous investigations, arrests, management reshuffle, asset freezes and fines would make USNA more vulnerable during this current crackdown. Put in stoploss at $43"

"A lot of money in China Be ware!!!!!!!!!!!Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $194.1 million at March 28, 2020, from $234.8 million at December 28, 2019. The decrease is primarily due to cash paid for share repurchases of $57.0 million. This decrease was partially offset by $30.8 million cash provided by operating activities. Of the $194.1 million cash and cash equivalents at March 28, 2020, $12.2 million was held in the United States.
