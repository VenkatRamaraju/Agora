"I love this stock,,, i own a few big name stocks, i own a bunch of little tech stocks, train, airlines, oil companies, copper mineand electric car companies,,, so this one helps me stay diversified,,,, the returns aren’t like NIO or MGNI but its steady and outside of what the typical robin hooder owns,,, any positive or negative views on the company would be very much appreciated"
I am down 10% after owning this for 6 months. Bought on the infrastructure hype. DE is not doing much better either. Down 4% today.
AGCO is down 5.01% to $51.35
AGCO reached a new 52 Week Low at 59.68
"SANW, S & W Seed Company, is an interesting agriculture stock. Michael Price seems to own 16,000,000 shares. Has been buying more during the past year."
Somehow we figured out how to fudge last quarter numbers to calm investors. Lets see what they have prepared in the worst quarter yearly for AG sales to hit numbers. I guess we try to sell our $#$ off again with promotional orders to dealers for that is the only shot we have!
"So AGCO sales continue to drop even with all of the new combines, Fendt product and production facilities around the world to take advantage of cost structures. The problem is that the JD, CNH and Kubota's of the world are growing at AGCO's expense. Being at the top end of technology and cost in Europe will not help when the other manufacturers can sell a full-line. You can buy back all of the stock you want, this is a dead stock."

Dealers indicate all the Massey Ferguson tractors are all sold out. They need to manufacture in the states as they cannot keep up with demand.
your CEO is lieing through his teeth on cnbc. covid questions
"Another dead stock going forward. Fendt and Valtra in Europe is not enough as Deere and CNH have lapped AGCO in SA. NA is a disaster as Martin and Crain has overseen its destruction of dealer base that is not CAT. Only a handful of CAT dealers left selling Ag Equipment. New Fendt combine I am sure is world class, but cannot replace Gleaner sales that were sold to smaller customers in NA. I am sure Fendt is losing its MS in Germany to JD and Claas."
Saw interview of CEO last night and was very impressed leading me to buy AGCO in extended hours!
"So Richenhagen is finally calling it quits at AGCO. So when he took over in 2008 for Ratliff, sales were 8.2B. Revenue in 2019 was 9.1B Basically 12 years of losing marketshare around the world. Consider 2B in acquisitions Precision Planter, GSI and Cambria (sp?). If you consider material and labor cost yearly increases at 4% - this stock with the same marketshare should be at 12B. Then look Tier III, IV, V and cost increases along with increases for precision guidance and electronics and that is probably another 4B in lost revenue if the company was maintaining marketshare. So standing still that 8-10B that Martin has screwed over AGCO. In contrast Deere went from 28B to 39B - still up but probably some losses to Kubota in its main market the US. Also big equipment is dropping in sales but increasing in per unit price! I hope the new AGCO guy is interested in growth and not status quo like Martin - at least Martin made his millions while accomplishing little at AGCO."
At least they pay their ceo 12 million a year.
"Briben sold out to China, Iran & the one world govt. He’s on camera stating he doesn’t even know what he’s signing!"
AGCO reached an all time high at 89.98
beautiful graph with beautiful potential. will be buying this stock very soon.
Come work for AGCO at the DC's. Best place around. K.P.I goals are the lowest in years and non factor anymore. These use to be pushed and the law not just in the DC by management but by above them and there managers. Upper management that use to care about things and visited us never come around anymore. Our DC's are completely filthy and wood and banding everywhere so we dont have to pick up anymore. We just work at a good pace for no expectations which gives us every Saturday to make easy overtime for we don't do anything above and beyond during the week anymore. We use to be dominate at 2 or 4 locations but now it is just average at best. Amazing we are doing that well with the stock price.
Good buy at $35

"No Deere equipment being made, AGCO is the only game in town. Goes to 180."
Why is this downafter beating the estimates?
"Company is about to have a rough fall and winter. Sales are dropping, harvest season will be way off the pace, management only looks out for themselves and is weak, distribution centers across the country are not hitting the goals, and they continue to try to do more with less. Going to catch up with them soon!!!"
