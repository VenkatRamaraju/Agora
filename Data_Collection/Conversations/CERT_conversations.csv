I wouldn’t be surprised if the share price reached $100 a share before the end of the year!
I think this is an awesome buy at $22
CERT is down 9.70% to 27.56
What does this company do again?
Certara is down 8.32% to 24.90
"This company is already profitable, not many IPO's can say that!"
I bought more shares today. I'll buy through the dip if it keeps dropping. This is a company to hold for the remainder of the decade.
"Get your Kool-Aid right here, Bruh."
When lockup period expires
Buy if it doesn't double at open?
any chance we can buy a pre IPO stock? and how?
"Just a little factoid here, CERT was profitable before it went public. How many companies can say that?"
It got to the floor at $29.90Hopefully it climbs like the other IPOs this week.
how high can it go? halted?
more share delution. Great
Certara is up 5.83% to 31.05
"I am looking to Buy, within the week! V. promisingly Bullish, as far as I can tell. Happy first Holdings, everyone!"
This stock has attracted too many short.

Certara is up 5.74% to 27.82
Now we probably know why it dropped so much around ER. Downgrade can't stop it from rising.
The insider 6-month lock-up period from the IPO expires June 9th so there will likely be some selling on June 10th ...
anyone know what is up today...29 Dec? why the big swings.
CERT is down 8.73% to 28.65
"Did buy small share on Cert, just 105 at 33.85.. if it deeps will increase my stake for another 105 at 31 range"
Anyone know the lockup expiration date? Thanks.
Terrible.

CERT is up 9.04% to 29.92
"Thinking of an entry today. Im all in PLTR now, but gonna be like 80 PLTR and 20% here. Soon im gonna add WISH and thats all for me."
"850 employees, and no news??? please CERT, say something...where is PR"
Hard to decide whether to get back in or not. Lots of potential but would love to get back in at lower prices.

CERT is down 9.10% to 30.83
"CERT is very weak, seems no support. Added more today."
I am actually a scientist in pharmaceutical company and I work in the area that is directly related to certara. They are helping companies in all aspects off drug development And their softwares are really really good. Have you seen another company ICON? just look at their growth pattern and I expect certara to have a similar growth pattern. I am definitely buying more of it as much as I can afford.
"Based on the stock price movement since last EPS, there might be many bad things hiding. I don't know what else bad things CERT has."
go CERT today
What closing price do you anticipate ? I am hoping for 40$ with momentum towards the end
Could be a massive buy in coming...
Offering price?

I like what I read about this company. Looking forward to being a shareholder.

Disappointing results
What price are you all anticipating once it hits the floor?
Why halt?
Some shorts continue shorting while some shorts are covering.
Geez good thing I didn't hold from the 30s. but dropping to 25 bucks that's unreal.
"I bought this one, I think this is going to be a great add to the portfolio!"
CMMON YEAHHHH BUDDY
nice run today. GLTA who got in at a low price!
"This company was established in 2008, it is not very likely may go bankrupt but I have lost so much and I won't sell at such a big loss (not likely but still may go bankrupt judging by its stock performance which I suspect a lot insider selling) and at least this is dead money for a long time. I regret my decision averaged down many times."
"$CERT is medical software company with exploding revenue with the PROFIT. Yes, I repeat PROFIT which is a rare gem for unicorns. I believe both $CERT and $AI will be undiscovered winners while people focus on like names like $ABNB $DASH $SNOW $PLTR."

this is a good company i will say.. just look in their website. what research they are doing and how many country they are serving ..  This stock gonna fly high ..
I'm still buying
what are differences between CERT and SDGR? are they in the same market?
2x gonna be the 7th ipo
"I consider this company to be a compliment to Schrödinger (SDGR), analogous to being the opposite side of the same coin. While they are different businesses, they work within the same industry and operate in the same circles. They also have a number similarities in their business models from what I've been able to discern. I liked SDGR right out of the gate and I like CERT for the same reasons. Perhaps CERT will experience some of the same challenges faced by SDGR (secondary offering, lock-up period expiration, etc). Should this be the case, I will view them as buying opportunities. Long term, I see CERT becoming an established power within Big Pharma (perhaps it already is), just like SDGR will be/is. Both companies are strategically positioned to benefit from markets that will always be flush with money. I will continue to add shares when pull backs occur. In 10 years I am expecting both stocks to be in the mid three digit numbers. Good investing to you all."
