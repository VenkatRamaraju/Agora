I'm still buying
Hard to decide whether to get back in or not. Lots of potential but would love to get back in at lower prices.
Lot of volume today wow. Wonder if this will start getting more attention from other investors.
The insider 6-month lock-up period from the IPO expires June 9th so there will likely be some selling on June 10th ...
Offering price?
When lockup period expires
Started this am with 1500 shrs @ avg 37.65 GL longs
Great price action with good momentum at closing
Certara is up 5.83% to 31.05
I think this is an awesome buy at $22
Why halt?
$31 offering price.
when can we buy
"Bought a bit today, the valuation is starting to become cheap imo"
"Bought at 32 , hopefully a good buy"

I am actually a scientist in pharmaceutical company and I work in the area that is directly related to certara. They are helping companies in all aspects off drug development And their softwares are really really good. Have you seen another company ICON? just look at their growth pattern and I expect certara to have a similar growth pattern. I am definitely buying more of it as much as I can afford.
Why down so much? Can’t figure it out based on conf call and earnings results 
and it continues...
what are differences between CERT and SDGR? are they in the same market?
headlines section has the opening indication https://www.benzinga.com/stock/cert

"I bought this one, I think this is going to be a great add to the portfolio!"
"I am looking to Buy, within the week! V. promisingly Bullish, as far as I can tell. Happy first Holdings, everyone!"

What price are you all anticipating once it hits the floor?
Anyone knows how to register to buy WISH on Dec. 15 at IPO price?
Why?
Certara is down 5.51% to 27.94
It got to the floor at $29.90Hopefully it climbs like the other IPOs this week.
"I consider this company to be a compliment to Schrödinger (SDGR), analogous to being the opposite side of the same coin. While they are different businesses, they work within the same industry and operate in the same circles. They also have a number similarities in their business models from what I've been able to discern. I liked SDGR right out of the gate and I like CERT for the same reasons. Perhaps CERT will experience some of the same challenges faced by SDGR (secondary offering, lock-up period expiration, etc). Should this be the case, I will view them as buying opportunities. Long term, I see CERT becoming an established power within Big Pharma (perhaps it already is), just like SDGR will be/is. Both companies are strategically positioned to benefit from markets that will always be flush with money. I will continue to add shares when pull backs occur. In 10 years I am expecting both stocks to be in the mid three digit numbers. Good investing to you all."
