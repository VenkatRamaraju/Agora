If one goes back to March 4th when Google did the same thing TTD closed at a little over 64.00. A week later stock was trading at over 75.00. So this is a buying opportunity because according to CEO Jeff Green they have a work around on this situation.
"Sam still needs the price to go back into the upper 60s to make all the money back from the puts he bought. Let him celebrate and drink himself into oblivion...when he comes to he'll likely not only have a major headache but realize he is still deep in the hole. Let's not even talk about the fact the stock has to go below 49 for him to tell you ""I told you to sell at 49."""
"looking forward to a strong cc…digital advertising seems strong generally, growth in europe/asia, continued adoption of unified id, updates on retail ecosystem plays (walmart, would love it if there’s more.)economic headwinds for sure with supply chain issues but offset by marketing dollars in aggregate moving to programmatic. net/net: these guys are where advertising is going and in 3 years i’d expect it to be a lot higher than where it is now. google jeff greens stock price-based compensation plan over the next few years. you would assume they picked targets they expect to hit…350 in a couple years."
Whisper number @ .19. Consensus. 15-17. Maybe there will be a suprise?
"Google just beat earnings. TTD will beat earnings as well, get ready folks!  ""Online advertising remains robust"""
I love earnings season with this stock! The manipulators come out in force trying to send the stock lower. Watch now for the shorties to come in. After great earnings come in a massive short squeeze will start.Buy and stay long my friends.
"ttd, apps, fb and goog no stocks to go wrong, ads kings"
"Yes earnings in 1.5 weeks. Last 3 earning rpts, we saw stock take a little dive. Are revs, and earning expectations lower due to the last few events, and overall tech market news cycle that we may see a surprise?"
"Sam, who hurt you?"
"Sam, I was ok with all this ribbing until you started making fun of fractional shares. Now you crossed the line."
"As explained by TTD’s CEO Jeff Green, TTD is only using 10% of APPl’s IDFA, the technology for tracking APPS. Yahoo declines to post the link. Just Google TTD Apple Security Issue."
what is digital advertising?
"Sam, what we doing now, selling puts, buying puts, covered calls?"
@CathieDWood Are you buying the dip?$SNAP $FB $GOOG $TTD
"s(P)am this one is for you: ""Inflation pressure now ‘brutal’ because of supply squeeze, US companies say"" - Source: https://twitter.com/FT/status/1451859372913606662"
TTD will be up BIGLY on the positive FB earnings. FB up 4% after hours -- back up to $80 we go!!!
hopefully apple earnings will push us back over $80  1 like=1 prayer 
"METAVERSE is going to be huge for Trade Desk with there marketing campaigns,https://www.thetradedesk.com/us/news/the-metaverse-how-brands-are-boldly-embracing-marketings-new-frontier"
Hedge Funds are dumping Trade Desk?….hehehehe….This is going to $200 in 18 mos
Snap downfall is due to TTD is taking the share of the advertising pie.
"Sams.... lol..... As you know, or should know, i'm long 2,200 shares and sold calls against it. also, owned some puts that I sold already..... I'm long, but hedged and wish I was hedged more..... im just going to sit on what I have for mow"
Going to be an interesting earnings report!! Not sure what it will do...... .... just a gamble at this point.....
"TTD main growth driver is ads for streaming television, not mobile .. market overreaction imo"
AMZN reported just under $8.1 billion in ad revenue in q3….49% YoY growth and slightly up over q2.
"mexigro. 16 days ago. Replied to a reactionThe Trade Desk, Inc.@Richard I've been in this business 20 years and ad spend always, ALWAYS ramps up for 4th quarter, and those ad bookings are happening now -- so good news coming.BWHAHAHAHA...... 20 years huh!!?? tell me what you do..... whats your title?? What did you LEARNT today?? Yeah, you're in the business alright.... hilarious."
"strong cash flows, IMO is this the holy grail of stocks. Even in rising rates? Everyone will still advertise and rush to cash flow rich companies like TTD"
"Made good gains here today, with apple down I’m moving out of tech going to coffee ( bros) be back Starbucks missed rev expect bros to jump fri I hope"
"Perion knocks it out of the park and ups revs for 2021 and 2022...sees no budget pullback or any impact at all from the supply and labour issues reported by SNAP.These results should lift the CTV adtech sector today, particularly Tremor International which is way undervalued.https://wp-cdn.perion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/26103601/PERI_Q3_2021_PR-26.10.2021-.pdf"
While today's drop comes as a result of SNAP I see this as a buying opportunity considering that the CEO Jeff Green stated on the quarterly conference call weeks ago that this situation concerning Apple and there change in policy regarding tracking was already taken care of with a work around. So those who see this today just remember the stock price because it won't be here long.
hey sam what's the name is this successful ad agency you owned 40 years ago? 
News Flash Sam is very smart. He said so.
$SNAP comments taking down $TTD. Jeff Green already addresses the Apple issues
brought 2K @76.80 after the bell.
"Ok I’m in cfo for Spotify on CNBC sees revenue growth in advertising growing, so ttd should be fine"
"Apparently I'm the only one here that works in advertising, and I can tell you right now that my client has boosted their ad spend 300%. And our scope of work is INCREASING for next year -- clients are planning to spend more in the coming 18 months. With most of those dollars going to programmatic as well as ""tried and true"" platforms --- Google and Facebook. Connected TV and DRTV spend is also on the rise but still a fraction of tried and true.also I have headhunters reaching out to me 3x a day because there is so much work in advertising -- so no, there is no ad apocalypse.SNAP just didn't know how to integrate the new iOS targeting parameters so THEIR clients pulled dollars or spent less because they couldn't measure or track the investment, so the share price collapsed -- also SNAP is a dog and I'm surprised they didn't fold after Kylie Jenner tweeted that it sucks and made the stock tank 2 yrs ago TTD and SNAP are totally different and not related platform or technology wise."
Uh oh. Trade desk announces a Monday morning before open earnings call. This is always a precursor to a 10% drop
Sam regale us again with tales ' O ' Notre Dame we never knew anyone with so much book learnin before.
"Sams, I've read them all 4 times..... I have to admit, I have no idea what he is saying, or to who.....sorry!"
Good partnership with Xiaomi.
"Sam, since you seem to be able to understand unusual writings, please translate Cash 3's posts. Thank you."
