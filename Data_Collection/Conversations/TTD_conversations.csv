Go TTD
"if all other ad companies did well in earning, this wasn't a surprise that TTD will do well as it is the best in class. Hold forever and you shall be rich. Thank you for the discounted shares yesterday"
100 by end of August. Great great company.
Why the drop? What happened
"I picked up 100 shares of TTD after the split. I wished I had them before the split because today I'd be sitting on 1,000 shares!"
im buying. TTD>>roku
It’s a $35 stock until proven otherwise
100 this week
Ok buy on any dip
Just sold another 10 calls!! loving this pop!
it seems to me DSP is less and less important for CTV advertising since CTV are controlled by the publishers who can use any DSP s they wish.
"I'm back here again trying to convince anyone who will listen to what I have to say about this new kid on the Nasdaq block....Tremor International. It's a long established UK full stack adtech exchange that IPO'ed on the Nasdaq just last month. Tremor‘s Q2/H1 earnings and CC are due next Thursday. It’s going to be a blow-out and the valuation gap between Tremor and it’s US Peers is large and palpable. That will close very quickly.Brought forward from the LSE bulletin board….Set your horizon for next year. The run-up for Tremor International starts next week and will continue through and beyond Tremor’s full year earnings report, expected in Feb/March 2022.Fill your boots while you can."
"Yep, and RED it is! watch and learn Selig......LMAO.....market is rolling over as predicted....yawn...."
Doubling revenue from the same quarter last year in the middle of a pandemic is great work from TTD.
"Been slowly selling the losers in my portfolios to make more room to add more shares of TTD, SHOP, AMZN, etc. Successful strategy is to make a time horizon of around a year for your stocks to perform, and if they don't, sell them and use the proceeds to buy more of your winners. TTD's share price initially rose so rapidly when I bought in several years ago that I could barely keep up with the price growth to add more shares on the rise. Shorts made fun of me when this sold off from 975 to 490 pre split, but at the current price my buys on the way down are looking quite smart. TTD will reach $100, not a question of if but when."
"Great company, but so overpriced. Must re-enter when it hits low 70s again"
Sam’s face when TTD is down less than 1%
What a joke?Rosenblatt Adjusts Price Target on The Trade Desk to $60 From $40.
"Stock has a lot of momentum. Still way overpriced, as a positive. The margins they achieve really are pretty amazing"
"feels like this stock is going to break out soon.. I bought in early on and still haven't taken any profits, but not selling any just yet.."
"Spencer, I realize you aren't very bright. Thats a given. However, most kids like would know you can go to the Nasdaq website and many others and see every trade for the day. You can go to the time of the trade which lists the exact second of the trade and see the number of shares, the amount, the date, etc. and confirm every trade ive posted!! I also realize, you and Selig are rookies and of low intelligence to begin with, so i've told you how to do it if you want to... However, if you would like to argue, why not bet me on them?? Got 10K you want to put?? make some easy money!! or ill bet all you want! bet the propane tank in your back yard if you want... just say the word and ill set everything up!! I'll give you my email address and we can set it all up!! I have nothing to hide..... other wise just go back to the hole you crawled out of and #$%$! kids that hide behind computers disgust me quite frankly....."
"So tempting to short this into earnings. I’m almost positive it will tank, but it’s just too risky of a game to play. I’ll decide next move after earnings"
I have only done this once or twice before but I put in an order the night before for TTD - I bought 100 shares
I was here 250 - 400 range in/out. I'm honest I made some good hits but missed the big run (in this stock). Its a solid company. Trading - a different story.
Bought TTD when it was low. Will continue to buy in. Also bought acuity as I feel it will have a good rise in SP.
"Not many reasons to sell, millions of reasons to buy. I was planning on selling at $90 but the hype is just beginning on this. Snowflake partnership opens doors to all of their clients which if you understand the business of digital advertising means 100% margins at a certain point. Price target $135 at a valuation of $65-70 billion is fair."
I got in at 48 - pre split - and if TTD cant hold the 20 day EMA I'm out and will live to fight another day. My concern for the market is that appears that QQQ is beginning to roll over. Your thoughts please.
Schwab just put out a message that Walmart is partnering with TTD and TTD is down this morning -- why ???? also why isn't yahoo posting it ????
"Bet Sam and Richard are claiming they shorted at 79. LOL. Congratulations on your pocket change. Compared to what I've made since buying at 490, 49 post split, you two are literally riding the bulls' coattails, and given the intellectual level you two presented in your comments back before I muted you, I seriously doubt you have the skillset to know when to short. I'm buying the dip today."
down to 20 short calls ..... started the day with 65 short calls! made money on every one so far!
Well that was fun. As promised I’m closing my short position at the 20 ema and here we are
Still below where it was before earnings........ I tried to tell you to sell the pop!! and you rubes were screaming for $115..... kind of funny.
best stock EVER
"I'm Kabuled. It is one of the worst days for America and you do not need to read WSJ to learn that - it is ‘Saigon on Steroids’: The Desperate Rush to Flee Afghanistan. It is unseemly to watch. This event emboldens America's enemies and erodes the confidence of its allies. America and the whole world is less safe today than yesterday. I invested about 500k into $TTD and $Roku less than 2 years ago hoping 1 of them would hit a home run, boy I was wrong- both excelled beyond my expectations (more than tripled for the period). I never considered trimming until last week and put in some stop-loss orders. I technically took out all my principals this morning and will let the majority of the rest shares ride for the next 5 years. While the USA is still strong there is no doubt that we unfortunately have weak bureaucratic amateurs in charge of the federal government, we'll all pay for it - my punishment is less share #s than I planned, I guess I will take my share of humiliation as an American. With MSM's help, you can pretend our southern border crisis is non-existent, the higher inflation is transitory and arguing high crimes are just ""gun"" violence however there is no hiding the utter failure of Afghanistan collapse in front of the world's eyes - and the worst is we still do not know how bad it'll end. Also headwind $3.5 T spending bill is another shoe to drop, in the next few months the closer the final bill to that #, the worse for the overall market. In a nutshell, I'm still super bullish on $Roku, $TTD and other picks individually, my holds are long term, but my confidence in the foreseeable big economical background is on a shaky ground."
in a cookieless world TTD auction based DSP model needs to prove to big brands for their ROI.
Great call so far. Going green!
Wow this stock is price to perfection lmao.
Today before market close $85 after market $86 next week Monday morning earning report beat up $15 see you all $100  to the moon ...consensus .22 vs .13 revenue $300 million good luck everyone
sold another 500 shares at $89....... this will drop today or tomorrow...
Walmart is one of the biggest plus largest footprints worldwide.It sees tremendous growth opportunities to partner with TTD.
"Here?s a thought for you TTD in-and-out traders and option gurus. Take the amount of money you had to invest in. TTD and imagine you had just bought the shares when you started fooling around in the stock and held on to today. How would that scenario compare to your current one? I started buying TTD in January 2018 and continued until May 2019, and I?ve never sold a single share. Never paid a penny tax. Someday, I?ll take some long-term cap gains. Could it go against me? Yeah, it could. There are no sure things in this world. But it?s a good business and I like my odds.Well, consider today to be day one again. You can buy and hold on for the next few years, or you can continue the trading game. But four years from now, I?ll bet some guy is going to be describing how he bought TTD when it was just 84-85(!) and held on, and all the smart day traders and option guys on this board are going to give him #$%$ just like you?re going to give it to me."
"Hey, Sam: just moved one of my trust accounts to another custodian. It’s the largest of four in which I hold TTD; 28850 of 35410 shares: The custodian sent me a receipt statement which I thought you’d be interested in since you’re always posting your tiny short-term gains, on which you pay taxes—or are supposed to. Although you apparently have never lost, I thought you’d like to see what the old buy and hold strategy looks like. Unfortunately, I can’t copy and paste the receipt statement, but I’ll reproduce below. I hope the columns work when I post but you’ll figure it out, smart boy that you are.

"People starting to figure out the disaster Biden has created in the US and all over the world.... Oil, Inflation, Covid, Afghanistan , Budget... not to mention crime raging.... TTD might be a great company, but it will be $50 fast if this the panic button gets hit..... Im just saying......"
"There's a chance TTD could decline on earnings with the tough year over year comparisons. 2020 was a year likely not to be repeated and there is no debating TTD is a COVID darling. However TTD unlike other COVID darlings is a company that thrives in an open economy as well. My gain is so huge on TTD that Sam and Richard can't possibly scare me out of my investment. If there is a selloff I will simply buy the dip. Traders will never be able to enjoy gains as mammoth as mine. We'll see how much the Terrible Two fares..if they are fortunate enough to profit off an earnings decline they had better lock in their gains before TTD erases the decline within days to 2 weeks. It's not that hard to make money in TTD if you keep in mind that the direction this company is trending in is skyward, not downward, and that the real money is made as a long term investment, not a trade."
"Hey Richard , APPS closed down $4.40 I thought it was better?"
This is who is ruining the country.
TTD will get push northward to near term of $100 to $120 when report come out
$100 tomorrow
"Timmy, how that dance working out for ya?"
My prediction TTD will be in mid 90 by lunch on Monday.
just picked up 500 shares at $84.......
"Things our traders know: be careful of the hype, lock in profit while you can, and don't be stuck holding the bag."
hopefully up 4% today
My price is $115 before September
"Chief very happy!!! Chief love being long term shareholders of great companies, like The Trade Desk! Chief thinks $100 per share very soon. Chief not worried about extended valuation because Chief long term."
I have done great with $TTD but my money now is moving on this new gem $TBLA earnings out Tuesday....Q2 revenue expected 50% higher than $TTD and a Market Cap that will catch up soon to match this

Why is TTD stock falling after earnings. Don't get it
Going well below $70 (eventually)
Just bought some ZOOM at $307.... had to play it........
I buy TTD when it goes bellow $80
Whats a CFRA? anyone heard of them? expect more downgrades from real analysts tomorrow...
"Remain reason for high profile company that has some share in advertising money such as TTD.TTD do a forward split, so it is difficult to do a hostile takeover since it is very hard to convince the general public to tender their shares to hostile takers and when the share price at $900+ then only so few who owning the shares and make it easy to convince one or two rather then 100 or millions share holders."
Watch and Learn rookies!!! wait til the market opens....its already dropping..
We need a close clearly above $82.50 for a breakout.
TTD. Stay long. Upward movement looking good.
This just keeps getting better. I should have bought more.
Selig and lil Johnny....
"Would prefer more of a slow steady climb. The more this goes up into earnings, the more likely it will be a sell the news event. I'm a big bull in the long run but would hate to see this get too far ahead of itself."
Solomar or SoloMarket is now the go to thing all businesses are looking for to get their products to consumers worldwide.
This market is weird when you need to “shake off” a good earnings report. Stay long my friends and let the day traders on this board loose by playing with the negligible volatility.
LMAO.... $257 Million in sales projected by Wall Street.... Most hardware stores beat that!! Most fruit stands could beat that!! AND a $40 BILLION market cap!??? INSANE valuation..... 40 times sales.. LMAO!!!

Sam and his looney toon aliases must be so angry to see this stock rise and rise and rise while he sits on the sidelines talking about how rich he is lolol. Sam. We need weak investors and weak humans like you to remind us what strength looks like. So thank you xoxoxoxo
"It's great company. But on last earnings report TTD crashed from $66 down to $48. Its $18 point in one day. I want this to go up as high as possible so when it's crashed can go down more points than last earning report. I am not shorting, just buying puts. IMO."
"Wow.... up $20,000 exactly on my 2500 shares!!! nice day!"
"Basically right where is was before earnings! ..... so only nimble traders who understood what was going on made money.... Volatility is a must!....Yes, there was no certainty, but good traders love earnings days, and Wall Street shills are a traders best fiend.... Over time thats all they are good for... You will learn to lose all respect for them.... my day is probably done... going to start making lasagna for guests tonight!!"

Sales more than doubled on both new client growth and rising gross spend from TTD's existing client base attached to the programmatic advertising market. Adjusted EBITDA of $118M (42% margin) was well above last year at $15M and consensus view of $86M, as higher volume sharply outpaced operating expense growth.

"Strong push to the earnings reports next month, Hoping for blowout earnings to bolster the tailwinds into the fall & winter advertising season. Hold on to your shares and be rewarded..."
MGNI announced strong earnings tonight and GOOG had strong ad income last week so I’m thinking TTD will have a solid earnings report next week.
Some technical analysis for those of you questioning whether now is the time to buy TTD. It is approaching extremely oversold levels on the relative strength index and depending on what time period you're using for the chart the MACD line is either below the signal or directly on it. If you're betting on a collapse like Richard and Sam the technical analysis should show you a move to the upside is coming. That's how to use technical analysis to filter out the garbage of yahoo TTD trolls and bears. Not to mention the fact TTD is receiving a slew of price target increases amongst analysts. Only a moron believes TTD is going back to 49.

dont plan to buy any more shares today... have enough of this one..... probably just sit it out... I like having the 20 short calls to sit on... they are September calls and ive made enough on the 45 I covered to not lose on them no matter what.....
"I don’t know how to spent load of money made from this stock, maybe I should buy a new Toyota to replace my 20 years old one."

"If it hits $85 today, I'll sell my 2500 shares..."
It’s been a while so I thought I would come on and slap Sam around for a bit. I see he’s still giving us his every “move” in the classiest of ways. Good job fish you keep up the good work. Can you give me the list of TTD competitors again? It was so helpful.
"TO: You're probably right. Buy and hold. However, I made a quicker P than was expecting, so I took some. Moral of the story......always do the opposite of cynical Sam."
"I can’t imagine sitting on a short position right now. Huge year over year comps, rebounding spending, great ad revenue growth from early announcers, etc. I listened to the Solimar launch event (available on the TTD website) and the strategic opportunity this company presents is compelling."
"Every share page on yahoo has a Sam type creature rattling about - the weird species of idiot that is half attention seeker and half moon howler. Anyway, each to their own but it's bizarre to me that people act this way when life is very short."
Help me here people. Why does tremor trade at such a discount to TDD with better financials and growth now that it also trades on nasdaq.
"This is dead investment due to low growth rate and low margins when compared to $TTD, $PUBM, $MGNI. Unless they improve revenue growth rate and margins, the stock price is not doing to improve. Till now Illumin is just hype. It is not doing anything to improve growth rate and margins. I am long since $6 per share. Will wait till next quarter results."
"well guys, superstrong earnings and forecast, see you at 100$+"
"Sure glad I dumped at $88 and $89!! I tried to tell you what was going to happen..... Most of you wouldn't listen again.... Down 15% from earnings date pop..... Which I said would just be a POP!! easy call really.... then I sold calls and made money all the way down!!! Yes, I bought back in, but thats at least hedged and im up so much now it doesnt really matter after trading this for 7 months,."
I wonder if it is TTD taking a look at buying DMS. They are reviewing strategic alternatives and seems like it could be a good fit.
sold at 82 going to wait till it settles to rebuy.
pumpgrades didn't work.
I was a bit to harsh with my numbers. Looks like anything over 300m in guidance would have pushed this up
You know that people like Sam aren’t listening to the cc if they are selling calls

"Interesting stats in business wire release: 44 percent of subscribers plan to cut or pull back cable service in the coming yearAdvertisers shift budgets toward Connected TV at accelerated rateNEW YORK, June 29, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cordless TV consumers are on track to become the predominant TV consumer in the next year, according to the fourth Future of TV survey of more than 4,000 U.S. adults by The Trade Desk (Nasdaq: TTD). The data shows that nearly half of American TV viewers are already cordless (47 percent), while 44 percent of Americans with cable TV anticipate pulling back or cutting service in the coming year.Cord-cutting accelerated as television programming such as live sports became unpredictable through the COVID-19 pandemic and as consumers’ hunger for on-demand content grew. The shift to CTV appears to be solidifying with the majority of TV viewers aged 18 to 34 and 35 to 54 (60 percent and 53 percent respectively) already without cable. These age groups are among the most coveted by advertisers.Streaming skyrocketed in popularity even for sports viewing, which has traditionally been a driver for linear TV viewing. According to the survey, only 19 percent of TV viewers are returning to their pre-pandemic sports viewing habits. Meanwhile nearly half of viewers (44 percent) who watch sports are choosing a primary viewing source outside of linear TV. That number increases to 65 percent among sports viewers aged 18 to 34.""We are entering a new TV normal, where new streaming viewing models sit side by side with traditional TV formats,"" said Tim Sims, Chief Revenue Officer, The Trade Desk. ""From an advertiser’s perspective, this shift presents a tremendous opportunity. They can reach those streaming TV viewers with more precision and accuracy than ever because they can apply data to those TV campaigns in a way that’s not possible with linear. So, it provides incremental reach that’s an important element of a comprehensive TV ad campaign.""The research also indicates the current TV content arms race cannot be financially sustained for providers or consumers without relevant ads, and consumers are becoming more receptive to advertising even on CTV. According to the study, more U.S. TV viewers report watching streaming content with ads (44 percent) than without ads (33 percent). Indeed, nearly two-thirds of U.S. TV viewers (64 percent) don’t want to spend more than $30 in total per month on streaming services, making free or lower-cost ad-supported services more attractive to consumers.Advertisers Embrace the Power of Data-Driven Targeting on CTVJust as consumers have doubled down on streaming TV, advertisers are also embracing CTV for its data-driven advantages and incremental reach. A separate survey of 150 advertisers conducted with Advertiser Perceptions found that 92 percent of advertisers believe that CTV is as good as, or outperforms, linear TV advertising, compared to the eight percent who say it’s not as effective. Their advertising budgets support this view, with 45 percent of advertising professionals increasing their CTV budgets over the last year. What’s more, among those who shifted budgets to CTV, 91 percent said they will maintain those shifts or increase investments in CTV.Among the reasons most often cited for this shift, advertisers called out the following benefits of CTV: • Audience quality (young consumers, cord-cutters, etc.) • Incremental reach to linear TV • Ability to target consumers more precisely • CTV measurement toolsThese benefits are particularly apparent for marketers when thinking about TV event advertising. In fact, 74 percent said that buying CTV ads in conjunction with live sports events can be more cost effective and impactful than classic sports sponsorships.""Today's marketers are under a lot of pressure to prove the ROI of every advertising dollar, and that has encouraged marketers to think about how CTV can provide incremental value as part of a TV ad campaign,"" said Sims. ""Advertisers want better cross channel measurement and the ability to tie that measurement to actual business outcomes. That means CTV is becoming an increasingly important component of most contemporary marketing plans.""Methodology for YouGov surveyThe fourth Future of TV consumer survey was conducted for The Trade Desk by YouGov. Fieldwork for this survey was conducted from April 27 to May 5, 2021. It’s a representative survey with a total sample size of 4,019 adults in the U.S. The survey was carried out online. The figures have been weighted and are representative of all U.S. adults (aged 18+).Methodology for Advertiser Perceptions surveyAdvertiser Perceptions conducted an online survey of 150 TV advertising planning and buying decisionmakers with an annual TV ad budget of $5+ million. Fieldwork for this survey was conducted from April 22 to May 5, 2021."
Monster day ahead!!!!
Evercore has raised TTD price target from $ 70 to $ 95 and maintains a outperform rating. Hopefully Q3 results will further lift this stock to greater heights. GLTA
This is how market maker manipulated TTD...my price still at $115 in September.
"Richard and Sam have likely been in the bathroom all morning, both to avoid looking at their trading screens and due to the fact that more of their money belongs to the bulls. Only 13 more points and their shorts assuming they started them at the top will be completely wiped out. Thumbs downers don't bother me. Maybe when they realize the bulls have this one right they'll pack their bags and go home. But given the IQ of some of these people I highly doubt that will happen anytime soon."
Below where it was before earnings...
ROKU/ETSY/FSlY are red and they all put pressure on TTD after market.
Why the sell off today.
Joe and the Ho.......what could go wrong?? Two highly intelligent democrats.... at least they are to your average democrat..

"Sam, who sold calls at 81, 82 and 85, is now broke."
"LMAO.... cleaned up on the calls I sold! I told you this would happen on Monday!! easy call..... the pop was very predicable in Premarket on Tuesday after all the price target changes.... then a little short squeeze as I posted... and I also posted it would settle and go back down!! watch and learn... made a killing with my ""fake trades"".....yeah, right."

"The Trade DeskJason Hall: It's been an incredible run for The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) investors, with the ad-tech stock generating almost 2,500% in total returns since going public less than five years ago.Yet even with this incredible run, I expect that The Trade Desk will continue to deliver market-beating returns for years to come as more and more advertising dollars shift away from linear TV and other platforms and move to programmatic ad platforms. And that's a huge tailwind for the company, which is partnered with some of the world's largest ad agencies, positioning it for plenty more growth to come. On the other side of the coin, The Trade Desk has been and is likely to remain a very volatile stock. We saw this play out to the extreme during the 2020 coronavirus crash when shares plummeted more than 50% in less than two months:Add it all up, and The Trade Desk is a great growth stock because of its prospects. But it's also one that's worth adding to your portfolio over time when Mr. Market gives you opportunities to buy. There's a very good chance that the next market crash will prove to be one of those opportunities."
Adding 200 more shares...i am continue to buy on the dip
MGNI vastly outperforming TTD lately! up over 4% again today..... all due to valuation....glad I bought some..meanwhile TTD is down again...
How do you find these videos of Selig?

"Betty, I understand your anger...you lost again!!!.. any time you want to test your thesis about making a lot of money and not posting on boards, just let me know.... we can make a wager.... im up well over $300,000 trading this stock alone.... want to dispute that??.... we can bet on it... all you want!!"
"4k shares at a bias of $84 :(, what do you think guys?"

Lil Johnny and Selig finally hooked up!!! Isn't that sweet!!!
Fish thinks Google isn’t a competitor
Stephens resumes coverage of TTD with a price target of $85. That’s why the stock is up today and why Richard and Sam are exploding in their pants yet again.
"TTD, to 20X, over next 5 years! Feeling pretty good!"
"If anything, providing no market snafu, this should trend upward to earnings date."
"Sam, I'm surprised yahoo lets your comments through their liberal gauntlet. Maybe its the speed at which you post. Keep 'em coming."
This stock will need 325-350 on revenue with 400-425 guidance to push the rock up the hill on monday
Remember when Sam told the whole world to SELL SELL SELL at $470 ($47) a few months ago. It’s $290 a share ($29) higher now. Sam could have been rich and stopped posting/lying on message boards if he did the opposite of what he told everyone else to do. Sorry Sam!
Wow TTD is flying now after the CEO's bullish outlook esp. International Business. Get on the train now. This will be green today.
Put a sell order in on 500 shares bought this morning at $88.50..... ill hold the other 1000 shares..
"TTD is the gift that keeps on giving, bought first share pre split 2016 @ 38's"
Sold yesterday. Back in today.
"Ok , sorry that was too hard on him."
"LMAO.... I called lil Johnny out and my other Human Piñata didnt let me down!! You Selig move in together yet, lil cupcake?? Let me know when you do... I'll invest in whoever makes KY Jelly! You still have your fractional share lil fella, or mom make you sell it to pay for that new skateboard?"
LMAO...... Bought SQ at $235 this morning in premarket....... Its up to $270 now!! what fun!!
There is huge chance it will drop after earnings.
"There was once a woman who decided to give a highly touted diet a try. She weighed herself every thirty minutes from morning till night. The varied results drove her crazy. She lose a few ounces, then a few ounces more, and then, suddenly, she gained some back. One morning she was a pound heavier than the previous morning. She quit the diet after four days. At the same time, her husband bought stock in a young growth company with a characteristically high beta. Like his wife and her scale, he checked the stock price every day, many times per day. It would go up and then down, up and down. After several days, the direction wasn’t clear. Sometimes it would go several weeks in the wrong direction. The man was confused, despondent. He forgot why he bought the stock. He found himself seeking the opinions of other people who owned the stock about why it didn’t go up all the time, people who knew no more than he did. Worse, he was subjected himself to the abuse of some jerks, the kind that are inevitably found in every corner of the internet. These sad sacks with no lives claimed fantastic investment expertise—as if someone who was truly successful would even bother. One nut job actually claimed—for a period of years—that he made money on every trade, multiple trades per day. Never took a loss. I know, I know: who would ever believe an emotional cripple like that? So, in the end, who was more foolish: the husband or the wife?"
Already soaring back up 
Bought the pullback at 80.30… to much promise in CTV to pass up
"Choosing to listen to the trolls on the TTD board is like choosing to listen to the radio over Spotify. Only someone who wants to be miserable would do it. Spotify is the solution to radio in the same way that professional analysts are the solution to listening to Richard, Sam, and Benjo. Spotify and professional analysts make life ten times more enjoyable both in having freedom with the music you listen to and the ability to count the greenbacks you go home with every week. The radio has garbage commercials, no variety to the music they play, and the same playlist for years upon end, just like the Three TTD Stooges have no variety to their posts, verbal abuse, and the same things said over and over again even if the times no longer apply. Tune out the noise that the radio and these three stooges spill out and life will be ten times more enjoyable."
Sam sold a call when TTD was trading at $81 hahaha!!! He called it a “pop” hahahahaha
"I’ve got some TTD, but MGNI seems to have greater growth prospects at this point. In fact, some think MGNI would be a logical acquisition target for TTD. Thoughts?"
Any growth tech stock that drops 40-50%+ is always a great entree point. Got in in May around $50. Been very good since then! Happy with my entrée point and stock.
"Sam, you sound like Sybil. You ok?"
"$TTD and $SHOP are the 2 future horsemen of tech. Both are likely going to be household names, a few years from now."
"There has not been one time in TTD’s history when the stock has failed to rebound from every selloff. Richard continues to call for the end on every dip, launching personal attacks on people who disagree with him as he does. Sam fraudulently claims to have shorted prior to every decline as well. Assuming they are really short they continue bet on things getting worse instead of wisely buying every dip. Karma will come to them like it always does. Betting against a company that has a monopoly, appears expensive but on a historical basis isn’t, etc. Shorting for the occasional trade might make sense, but being a perma bear like Richard will only Lead to bankruptcy and homelessness. And Sam will only ever have pocket change from his trades compared to longs like me. He probably makes fun of me because through no fault of mine I had to switch accounts, but I don’t apologize for announcing it instead of practicing deception. Unlike these shorts I don’t need to use multiple accounts at once to do damage to my opponents."
Looking at a steady climb higher throughout the day. The call needs to be good
Just 500 shares
the calls I sold are making me money!! glad I hedged.....
Would Google be interested in TTD?
"earnings and rev. doubled, good forecast....b at peace my friends, patience is key to making money in mkt"
meh. look at the nasdaq chart since june…it’s gonna happen. guarantee solimar platform will deliver for clients. see you at 100
will be amazing if this hit $90 today.
YES!! making some sweet money on the calls I sold!! WHAT FUN!! I told you this would happen...!! watch and learn.... and yes I sold my shares at the top!! it was an easy call if you know what youre doing...
"Brief pull back in tandem with with all stocks that have been pulling back immediately after good results, but will see spring back and head towards 100 in a few days. Hang on for the long and you will not regret."
"Now down 60% from highs. Nothing about the business has changed. Momentum and outlook only getting better. $MGNI, $TTD, $PERI, $APPS, are all ""skating to where the puck is going""."
TTD has tried to Green since 9:30am today. it should be up to 90s before coming ER
"Blaming a president ain't gonna get you anywhere. In your life you will go through probably 10 presidents, no reason to be upset half your life. It's cyclical like the market. People out there are looking for things to be offended by. If you look, you will find issues with everyone and everything. Enjoy what you got, not what you don't"
TTD will go red today...... $60's on the way.
"Greetings fellow shareholders and haters! A tremendous quarter it was!!! Chief very pleased with revenue growth!! Chief think CEO guide down to keep stock stable, but Chief know stock price eventually reflects long term value creation. Chief always say that any shares purchased under $70 are a steal. Congrats to all longs who have owned this gem for years!"
There is not a thing wrong with this investment.

Remember when that loony toon know it all Sam was telling everyone to sell at $470 ($47)?! Dude could have made so much money for himself and his sorry family.
I made a lot of money trading $TTD in 2020 but definitley sold too early. same with $roku.$MGNI has the same type of magical potential.It could also be an acquisition target for some big dog...
"Sold. $60 to $88. Thanks for your money Sam and Richard. Officially out. Good luck to all longs, this is a great company!"

I am still stand at $115 before September.
"Ad dollars being spent everywhere!! Roku taking off, FB, SNAP etc $100 let's go!"
$85 price target by many firms quickly and swiftly achieved today. Richard and Sam likely had their price targets at $60. Once again common sense prevails over idiocy. $90 is next. Congrats to those of you who ignored Sam's advice to sell and bought in the upper 40s. You have now almost doubled your money.
Where's BERNARD?
$90 is my prediction before earnings
TTD didn’t have new news for long time. If any or some news come early this can push $100 if not then $65 to $70. Imo
Goin to $115
"Temporary ad tech re-trace or not, Tremor International's earnings report, out today, beat all its peers by a mile. FinnCap have just upgraded its price target to £14 GBP (US $19.18). Because there are 2x Tremor shares per ADR that puts Tremor at $38.36, it’s currently sitting at $19.88 pre-market. This gap won’t remain for long."

"Terrific action into earnings, as predicted by the bulls on this board. I’m looking forward to making a fortune after earnings!"
Joe sure did a nice job with the Afghanistan pullout!! He's really smart! has a long history of competence and intelligence!!
I got in at 500 pre split so I haven’t been around to long. What are some of the catalyst some of you longer holders see in the future. I am comfortable holding for years to come.
"Richard,How is APPS trading?"
Rocket ship to $100!
This stock is so overvalued it's disgusting. Classic; hot stocks will split so the young kids will buy it up and not realize it's actual valuation based on the price change.
"sam6 .....hours agoWOW.... seems stuck at $85........ $12 off its peak.... looks overextended and tired..... hmmmmmm... tempting to short it hear, or sell some calls.....BWHAHAHA... another perfect call!! sold calls and already in the money!!!! make it going up and make it going down!!!"
"My greatest fear of having a large unhedged long position in TTD is the overall market tanking... I believe its on thin ice and the macro economic outlook does not look that good to me.... hence my short calls. I usually trade around core positions especially high Beta stocks..... I always have a hedge on high PE growth stocks as obviously they get hurt the most if the market crashes, and it will at some point...."
Digital ads are on fire! TTD over $200 by end of year!
Sold some calls today!! very happy to hedge my 2800 shares.....
Good report! See you at 90 soon!
"If you are on this board and not long on TTD, it’s clear to me that your money is short."
"Clearly tons of people saw through the initial smoke and mirrors of the guidance and tough year over year comparisons, which are univeral to almost every company that did well last year. Hope Richard and Sam covered their shorts but I doubt it. They'll say they did, but we all clearly can tell that their lack of common sense when it comes to financial analysis likely spills over to their skills as traders, assuming they even have the capital for those operations, which I seriously doubt."
"TTD must go up with good ERs from GOOG, FB, MGNI, etc. To the CEO - You better deliver vs. your talkies, otherwise remember what happened the previous ER? TTD WAS DOWN -$172. Do not let this happen again or your company will tank."
Looks like TTD reading water.
yea and this is easy $1000 presplit and 100.00 post splittttt....
"Nice earnings! The institutions will resume accumulating shares once more. Enjoy the ride. Go Long, Stay Strong!"
"This drop in TTD since the earnings report is unreal, its understandable that the market is in a decline but good stocks like TTD seem to be punished compared to stocks in this same field. Serious ideas only. TIA.."
Next week beat earning  $10 reach new high $100  to the 
Why is it down in after hours
Why has TTD been dropping???
SnowFlake is now involved with or supports the TTD platform.$115 is the number I support for TTD.
"Sam it reached $85 today. Peace out, glad you sold. You done here now!!!!"
Great numbers!
"Buy on the dip, you all will be rewarded handsomely, this is a institution manipulation."
"Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) reported quarterly earnings of $0.10 per share which missed the analyst consensus estimate of $0.13 by 23.08 percent. This is a 89.13 percent decrease over earnings of $0.92 per share from the same period last year. And you rubes say... duh, they had great numbers!!! then they guide the same revenue they had this Q.... $2 million higher....lol"
"Will open $85+ tomorrow, see Google's ad revenue??"
Rider after earnings.
"The decline today likely was in part due to institutional rebalancing. Hedge funds have to take profits after a runup to keep stocks like TTD being too overweight in their portfolios. They will resume their purchases again soon. I don't know the exact institutional ownership of TTD but I am almost 100 percent certain it is not only extremely high but increasing almost daily. Sam and Richard can think they have the power to manipulate this stock, but they are gnats and the institutions are Godzilla. You tell me who would win the fight. If you have to think about that you don't have any business trading or owning TTD."
Had to buy some puts and sell a few calls at open......Dementia Joe is destroying the economy and country faster than I thought he could.. TTD could go to $60 easily.
Today's closing price is the highest since last Feb. 19.
@Sam. I’m still dancing.
"This is going to drop down faster than Rider in front of Don Lemon, Tuesday!"
TTD will surpass it earning projection by 25% for this Q report
"Will TTD get past 90 today, or tomorrow?"
"TTD passed Golden Cross last week, Bullish and loaded more."
I swear everytime I buy a stock the very next day there’s a market correction... just won’t stop
"Now up $200,000 since $500 pre split. Tell sam to drop dead"
Not long ago TTD traded at $900+before someone traded it down due to they do not like the split even with good earning.And now they were all so disappointed in their actions. But it is not too too late
"dumped 100 shares at 81.10. took $400 profit and reduced my position... down to 2700 shares...small reduction, but Took a little off the table..."
Seeking Alpha: “TTD valuation will take years to catch up”
"Interesting Perion preliminary report for Q2 that may help indicate what TTD could report in Q2: Perion Network PERI reported strong preliminary results for second-quarter 2021 on Jun 28. The advertising technology company now anticipates revenues of $105 million, which suggest 74% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter and 17% growth on a sequential basis.Moreover, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $13.5 million, indicating a whopping increase of 440% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter and 53% growth on a sequential basis.Notably, in first-quarter 2021, revenues soared 36% year over year to $89.8 million, while adjusted EBITDA surged 41% to $8.8 million."

With owners of TTD expressing confidence in the future of this company with a 10 for 1 stock split you know they're going to crush earnings August 4th. I love it and can't wait. Stay long. GLTA

Glad I added on this mornings dip. :)

"Hey, Sam! Long time no talk to! Do me a favor, would you?

Roku’s advertising is record breaking in revenue. This should trickle down to TTD.
"Closed out 2/3 my position today. Wouldn't mind if it keeps going up, but I'd really like to buy back in after a pull back"
"TTD has been in my long portfolio for awhile, but this stock is so predictable, I set aside some cash to swing trade the dips. Even before the split, buy in the 700's, sell in the 800's. Was doing that easily once a week. Now, I buy in the 70's, sell in the 80's. Wash, rinse, repeat. I love TTD!! Not only is it a great company, but easy to short term trade! And with Motley Stooge pumping it from time to time, it's a win win ;)"
"All tech is giving low guidance because of economic reality in the future. Check it out, all of the FAANG is low guidance. Playing it safe. This is no different and TTD will be up as soon as it becomes clear it is making a ton of money."
Poor Sam. Always on the wrong side of the trade. Waiting for his next lie about how he is long when this hits $100 in September
Rider doing some pre-bar action before meeting up with his grnder date
@Sam’s wife @Richard is whooping his sorry aiss now.
snowflake partners with ttd is this true or just rumor
I'm a little nervous about this earnings release. Since I'm long from $52 I set up a collar at $89 & 78. I think the downside is much more risky at the moment.
How much resistance do we get around 90? I have a hard time expecting to blow past the old high on the first try. I would bet we bump around between 82-92 for a few months. But who know...we could shoot past it without issue. What do you all think?

Down AH because of ROKU.
This is $150-200/share comnpany. I am buying more. No worries at all.
All Time Highs coming soon
What did I say? ITS GOING GREEN!!!
"Strong day holding onto over 25% gains since the split, TTD moves to $100+ soon. Short term, easy money. Long term TTD is a jewel!"
DSP seems to be more competitive and less in demanding since more and more big guys like P&G want to do in house.
Figures. I had just added to my TTD position today and ROKU goes ahead and ruins the day. Roku reported 55.1 million active customer accounts for the quarter and 17.4 billion streaming hours. Bloomberg Consensus estimate had been for 55.8 million active customer accounts and 19.19 billion streaming hours.
Sam was calling me cupcake prior to before I muted him. The fact he apparently still does that tells me he has a fetish for men. I'm behind a screen so I just laugh at it but if that is how he talks in real life to people it explains why he hangs out on here rambling away...because other than Richard and his teddy bear he has no social life.

"Roku missed on active accounts and hours viewed, by a couple billion hours in streaming hours watched, by a few million in viewers. Steve Louden, their CFO, stated they feel good about viewers moving to streaming from conventional TV, and about advertising dollars continuing to move to streaming. That's TTD's main thing."
Trade Desk is the Shopify of advertising going up against Google and being highly sucessful just as Shopify does in the e-commerce industry against Amazon. I love this company long term.
"I actually am surprised it isn't down more, to be honest. This stock is definitely loved by the street."
What’s everyone’s price targets over the next 12 months to 5 years? I’m up over 50% in a matter of 6 weeks or so after earnings & 10/1 stock split. Thoughts appreciated I’m not sure if I should hold long term or take my profit I’m normally a long term investor!
Honestly. SNOW and a few other cloud stocks are trading at almost or over X100....If TTD was in the same boat. TTD should be around 83-100 Billion. Which is about $150-$200 per share where it is at now.I bought at the last large dip and up already over 50% in 3 months. Not bad!
Just wondering why TTD makes 10 to 1 split. Why not 2 for one? Is split make it buy easy for help from downturn ?
"@Bernard, what a great assessment of Sam ,you are right on target."
"Well, I laughed so hard the other morning I nearly spit out my coffee. I came across a posting by a certain guy in which he described his affluent lifestyle: winter and summer homes, holding company, golf on the best courses, deep-sea fishing, etc. You would think that a person who had achieved success on that level would be expected to be happy and spend his days enjoying the fruits of his labor and generally approach the world with a smile and equanimity—and why not? But this guy spends every single day, seemingly all day, on a message board, putting people down while claiming to be making money—money he doesn’t need—by making high-risk bets that pay off by always correctly guessing the direction of the market for this stock. Ask yourself this: what’s wrong with this picture? Well, everything. It doesn’t compute because it isn’t true. This guy is successful only in a virtual world of his own making. And his wounds are so deep that he’s not satisfied merely being the greatest short-term trader in history; he also needs to put everyone else down. The clues are everywhere, and you have to feel sorry for a man who’s fallen short so often, and so tragically, that he has to reinvent himself each and every day, squatting on some obscure message board in a small corner of the internet. His loneliness and desperation oozes through every post. He is dangerously close to self-destruction. Save his life by reassuring him. Tell him you’re in awe of his financial acumen and the life-long success that has brought him luxuries. Make him feel good; his ex-wives couldn’t do it and the loneliness haunts him. No wife, no kids, no friends. Just a sad little man and his keyboard, getting even for every slight. Keep trading, fella. Keep pounding away on that keyboard as you microwave another frozen dinner and polish off another six-pack. You’re the king of the world."
Seems like a rinse and repeat of AMZN earnings. I think it all depends on guidance they offer Monday AM for balance of year and if there’s any delta virus hedging in the forecast.
dead money as I said weeks ago....... told you to sell the pop after earnings.... I sold at $88 and $89 and told you to do the same......... easy call.... bought back in the $70's..... most of you sad it was going to $115 by September...... I just laughed.....
glad I hedged now......

There will be serious dumping following earnings release no matter how much company beat and guides.

Katie bar the door.... ive been watching for 6 days now... even AMZN, FB, goog, have been lagging lately..."
So Sorry sir. I was out of line.
This is almost 5% below where it was right before the earnings release. It's like the positive earnings never happened.
