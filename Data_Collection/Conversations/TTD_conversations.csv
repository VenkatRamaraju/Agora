"Not many reasons to sell, millions of reasons to buy. I was planning on selling at $90 but the hype is just beginning on this. Snowflake partnership opens doors to all of their clients which if you understand the business of digital advertising means 100% margins at a certain point. Price target $135 at a valuation of $65-70 billion is fair."
"feels like this stock is going to break out soon.. I bought in early on and still haven't taken any profits, but not selling any just yet.."

dead money as I said weeks ago....... told you to sell the pop after earnings.... I sold at $88 and $89 and told you to do the same......... easy call.... bought back in the $70's..... most of you sad it was going to $115 by September...... I just laughed.....

"My greatest fear of having a large unhedged long position in TTD is the overall market tanking... I believe its on thin ice and the macro economic outlook does not look that good to me.... hence my short calls. I usually trade around core positions especially high Beta stocks..... I always have a hedge on high PE growth stocks as obviously they get hurt the most if the market crashes, and it will at some point...."
Remember when Sam told the whole world to SELL SELL SELL at $470 ($47) a few months ago. It’s $290 a share ($29) higher now. Sam could have been rich and stopped posting/lying on message boards if he did the opposite of what he told everyone else to do. Sorry Sam!
Doubling revenue from the same quarter last year in the middle of a pandemic is great work from TTD.
"dumped 100 shares at 81.10. took $400 profit and reduced my position... down to 2700 shares...small reduction, but Took a little off the table..."
"All tech is giving low guidance because of economic reality in the future. Check it out, all of the FAANG is low guidance. Playing it safe. This is no different and TTD will be up as soon as it becomes clear it is making a ton of money."
I wonder if it is TTD taking a look at buying DMS. They are reviewing strategic alternatives and seems like it could be a good fit.
"This drop in TTD since the earnings report is unreal, its understandable that the market is in a decline but good stocks like TTD seem to be punished compared to stocks in this same field. Serious ideas only. TIA.."
"FinnCap raises Tremor International price target to $38. RBC raises Tremor price target from $27 to $32, says Tremor delivered a ""strong"" debut in its 1st Q since listing on the Nasdaq in July - Those numbers outpaced all of Tremors US peers."
This is almost 5% below where it was right before the earnings release. It's like the positive earnings never happened.
"TTD passed Golden Cross last week, Bullish and loaded more."
CHIEF LOVE TTD AT THIS LEVEL. CHIEF SEES TTD AT $110 A SHARE BY END OF 2021. CHIEF LIKE WHEN TTD TRADES AROUND A LEVEL LIKE THIS BECAUSE SWIFT MOVE TO UPSIDE AHEAD
"Nice earnings! The institutions will resume accumulating shares once more. Enjoy the ride. Go Long, Stay Strong!"

MCAP OF TTD IS OVER 23 TIMES THAT OF TRMR. Er hang on a minute????"
Bought TTD when it was low. Will continue to buy in. Also bought acuity as I feel it will have a good rise in SP.
just bought some puts.
"But How's Hunters paint by number gallery doing? That whats important.... Sad the Russian Utility company had to stop the $50,000 a month payments... That had to hurt!"
"$TTD and $SHOP are the 2 future horsemen of tech. Both are likely going to be household names, a few years from now."
"Basically right where is was before earnings! ..... so only nimble traders who understood what was going on made money.... Volatility is a must!....Yes, there was no certainty, but good traders love earnings days, and Wall Street shills are a traders best fiend.... Over time thats all they are good for... You will learn to lose all respect for them.... my day is probably done... going to start making lasagna for guests tonight!!"
Walmart is one of the biggest plus largest footprints worldwide.It sees tremendous growth opportunities to partner with TTD.
"There has not been one time in TTD’s history when the stock has failed to rebound from every selloff. Richard continues to call for the end on every dip, launching personal attacks on people who disagree with him as he does. Sam fraudulently claims to have shorted prior to every decline as well. Assuming they are really short they continue bet on things getting worse instead of wisely buying every dip. Karma will come to them like it always does. Betting against a company that has a monopoly, appears expensive but on a historical basis isn’t, etc. Shorting for the occasional trade might make sense, but being a perma bear like Richard will only Lead to bankruptcy and homelessness. And Sam will only ever have pocket change from his trades compared to longs like me. He probably makes fun of me because through no fault of mine I had to switch accounts, but I don’t apologize for announcing it instead of practicing deception. Unlike these shorts I don’t need to use multiple accounts at once to do damage to my opponents."
"I’ve got some TTD, but MGNI seems to have greater growth prospects at this point. In fact, some think MGNI would be a logical acquisition target for TTD. Thoughts?"
"msft. aapl. Amd, all green.... hi PE stocks mostly red... tells me many investors are moving into lower PE stocks with strong balance sheets and out of Hi PE Momentum stocks like TTD.. might me the start, but if theres me follow thru next week.... Katie bar the door.... ive been watching for 6 days now... even AMZN, FB, goog, have been lagging lately..."
Looks like dead money to me...... Has for awhile. Going to need a catalyst to move this up anymore. none on the horizon either....Priced to perfection.... Think im going to sell some calls an any pops. I used to love the volatility before the split!! I knew it would calm with a 10 for 1 split.. such a shame....
Wow TTD is flying now after the CEO's bullish outlook esp. International Business. Get on the train now. This will be green today.

At what point does somebody seriously start taking about impeachment? or are they to fearful of the rest of the C team taking over?
"I'm Kabuled. It is one of the worst days for America and you do not need to read WSJ to learn that - it is ‘Saigon on Steroids’: The Desperate Rush to Flee Afghanistan. It is unseemly to watch. This event emboldens America's enemies and erodes the confidence of its allies. America and the whole world is less safe today than yesterday. I invested about 500k into $TTD and $Roku less than 2 years ago hoping 1 of them would hit a home run, boy I was wrong- both excelled beyond my expectations (more than tripled for the period). I never considered trimming until last week and put in some stop-loss orders. I technically took out all my principals this morning and will let the majority of the rest shares ride for the next 5 years. While the USA is still strong there is no doubt that we unfortunately have weak bureaucratic amateurs in charge of the federal government, we'll all pay for it - my punishment is less share #s than I planned, I guess I will take my share of humiliation as an American. With MSM's help, you can pretend our southern border crisis is non-existent, the higher inflation is transitory and arguing high crimes are just ""gun"" violence however there is no hiding the utter failure of Afghanistan collapse in front of the world's eyes - and the worst is we still do not know how bad it'll end. Also headwind $3.5 T spending bill is another shoe to drop, in the next few months the closer the final bill to that #, the worse for the overall market. In a nutshell, I'm still super bullish on $Roku, $TTD and other picks individually, my holds are long term, but my confidence in the foreseeable big economical background is on a shaky ground."
This is how market maker manipulated TTD...my price still at $115 in September.
"TTD currently in oversold territory, it is off by nearly 30% from high.Adding more share now."
Schwab just put out a message that Walmart is partnering with TTD and TTD is down this morning -- why ???? also why isn't yahoo posting it ????
"earnings and rev. doubled, good forecast....b at peace my friends, patience is key to making money in mkt"
in a cookieless world TTD auction based DSP model needs to prove to big brands for their ROI.
"Hey, Sam: just moved one of my trust accounts to another custodian. It’s the largest of four in which I hold TTD; 28850 of 35410 shares: The custodian sent me a receipt statement which I thought you’d be interested in since you’re always posting your tiny short-term gains, on which you pay taxes—or are supposed to. Although you apparently have never lost, I thought you’d like to see what the old buy and hold strategy looks like. Unfortunately, I can’t copy and paste the receipt statement, but I’ll reproduce below. I hope the columns work when I post but you’ll figure it out, smart boy that you are.

"Brief pull back in tandem with with all stocks that have been pulling back immediately after good results, but will see spring back and head towards 100 in a few days. Hang on for the long and you will not regret."
