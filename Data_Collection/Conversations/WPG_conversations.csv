"The sheep are buying, that is what keeps this garbage above $1. They want 'equity' in the new scam operation. They figure the current bag-holders got robbed, economy will improve, and under the new company real estate prices will jump up in a year or two and they will sell off this garbage piece by piece at a huge profit that will go to the share holders. But will it?? This new stock will be private, won't trade, means you can't sell on the market, only with insiders, and they set the rules, the price, if you don't like it you can't sell it unless they say so. Same shyster CEO, same cronies will be part of management that bk-d WPG. The made out very well in the bk, they got bonuses, get a huge salary. All for what? WPG is nothing but a huge scam, and they are getting away with it now, and will again."
Wrecked!
"Timothy asked why does it keep going down if it's so good? Same question I'm asking but here's one.theory.... I think hedge funds have to short something and this is the popular thing to short right now. We have Corona virus and now L Brands is struggling. All reasons to keep shorting retail reits. But looking at wpg specifically, you do the numbers and L Brands isn't likely to take down WPG even if they start closing stores. maybe if they wouldn't have back-filled the box stores, bit they're now 2/3 done with that maybe more ...also, There are other stores expanding and backfilling vacancies such as H&M, athleta, Lululemon, madewell, Ulta, warby Parker, etc. So they close 25 Victoria secrets next year, ok, throw those guys in the space. And Corona virus is on track to infect and unfortunately kill about as many people as seasonal influenza. It's horrible, but it's not SARS, it's not killing 10% of those infected it's more like 2-3% based on what has come out so far. I think it could slow down commerce because of the panic that's coming with it but not enough to kill brands unless they're already almost dead and we all know who those players are and they're already on WPGs short list as discussed on the last earnings call.Anyway point is, they want a reason to short retail reits categorically - and you probably can categorically, but WPG is appropritely converting vacating space to it's new highest and best use and they're doing it fast and they're doing it effectively - with signed leases and FFO to prove it."
"I live In Boynton beach, fl and the city voted just 30 minutes ago to approve wpg tearing down 40% of the mall(old sears wing) to build apartments and a hotel. This will be a huge money maker as apartment rent is sky high hear and not enough supply."
"Dear Mr. Conforti: To my everlasting regret, in 2017 I began purchasing common stock In WPG, eventually accumulating a holding of about 30,000 shares in several brokerage and retirement accounts. As this represented one of my largest single holdings, I assiduously listened to quarterly earnings calls and tried to perform an in-depth analysis of your financial results. Two things stood out. First, you seemed to have an intelligent and workable plan to reposition the company; secondly, you seemed to have come up with a way to finance the program without seeking new debt or cutting the dividend. Indeed you were quite adamant that neither of these steps was necessary. I will admit that I found your “comedy routine” to be juvenile and insulting to the intelligence of the investors and analysts. But I also recall in every call you complaining bitterly that the company and you were not getting the respect from the market that you deserved for the work you were doing, as reflected in the declining pps. In retrospect, if anything, you were getting more respect than you deserved. You clearly should have listened when the market told you the company needed to cut its dividend 3 years ago. Instead you doggedly stuck with it. Think what the company could do today with an extra $220 million. While you finally, belatedly cut the dividend, you continued to maintain it on the preferred stock for reasons that entirely escape me. Perhaps all of this was due to your personal financial needs and those of other directors. But these were clearly imprudent payments. Last year when the company paid the $250 million loan, you were quite certain that this meant the company now had no debt challenges until 2023. How quickly that “optimism” turned to ashes. When you finally admitted last fall that the company had engaged financial advisors, you were again most clear that this in no way meant the company was looking to reorganize through a recapitalization or a bankruptcy. I don’t know if this is actionable misconduct under the securities law; however, I do know it was a reprehensible misrepresentation.While I know that you will surely blame the pandemic for the company’s financial failure and your mismanagement, that fault will be misplaced. While the pandemic exacerbated the problems, this company was headed for financial ruin long before March 2020. It was just being covered up. In looking back, I now realize you have engaged in a continuous pattern of misleading those of us who invested our hard-earned money in this scheme and are likely to lose it all. Of course you and your cronies will undoubtedly reserve for yourselves a large chuck of any new equity coming out of the restructuring via a generous MIP, to top off the $11 million you took last month (which should have been paid to the creditors). Hopefully someone will lead the effort to require that unearned money to be disgorged. And you can be sure I will file an objection to any plan that allows you to further benefit at our expense. What an outrage!"
"FYI either today or tomorrow is the last day for WPG to work a deal with their bond holders, or get an extension (if such a thing exists), but then the company has up to 3 days to make a SEC filing to reveal the information. So don't get your hopes up for today or tomorrow. This is worth a little risk, so just buy and hold if you are interested in owning shares as a long-term investment. I don't care what day traders do. Good luck!"
"Added a few shares as well...Time will tell, but at these price Risk/Reward is pretty good IMO"
The court hasn't really addressed the shareholder committee or the shareholder who wrote the letter.
Ok - what happened? Who would be buying a stock for $1 that’s about to be delisted and only worth $0.82?
What's the news on the RSA ? Bookings are down COVID rising; the dive to $0 is coming ..
(http://Thetraderguide.com) is a must for any trader. Their watchlist which covers pre-market movers is one of the best researched in the industry. I don’t start trading without reading their daily email each morning!
Pfds should be trading at $5.00++….don’t see how common could be worth more than $0.75-$0.80.
"Earnings of -$0.04 per shareEstimated-$0.21 per share, Stock should be going up not down"
So they said it will be tradable… but then they said its a ltd…??
See you guys at .5
Well that’s all she wrote. Wpg will be delisted and holders will lose it all. Shareholders got creamed by incompetent management. Too bad. Luckily didn’t hold any shares but wanted to see how this played out
Won't they have to declare a dividend before the end of the year? Or did the one they pay in the first quarter qualify them?
Who is pumping this? The absolute most you’re getting from bankruptcy is $0.80/share. This is going to be a massive lawsuit.
Government should invest to build low rent apartment and new shopping centers with WPG lands.
"WPG is the best run company listed on the NYSE, most honest CEO and cronies, great future, very profitable, and management is so mindful if the bag holding sheep. This will go only one way."
is there any change for a Short Squeeze for this stock untill the delisting date? is it better to just sell asap?
Anyone know the url for the official WPG equity committee website? Thanks.
Any idea how bond holders who aren’t able to submit their bonds for the new shares will be treated?
Any news on the BK RSA yet ?
I have above 300 shares what should i do? Sell it or keep it?
"Where are we headed? Well it’s clearly no place good for those of us who own common stock. The skipped interest payment seems intended to kickstart the “deleverang” the said they were working on. Unfortunately it is going to be done by equitizing unsecured debt. Last year they used half their unmortgaged properties to obtain a waiver of incipient covenant breaches, so they have much less unencumbered properties to offer the unsecured bond holders than before.They will use the next 28 days to negotiate a prepackaged BK that will give the unsecured bond holders the vast majority of the equity. I would expect the preferred shareholders to get enough of the new equity to close to unimpaired and and use poor common holders to get 5-10%. The good news is that unlike CBL, WPG doesn’t have a lot of preferred shares outstanding.I don’t like it because I’m going to eat a six figure loss. But that the price we are paying for Lou’s dogged refusal to cut the dividend 50% or more three years ago. They simply don’t have the funds necessary to repay their debt and finish funding the the repurposing program otherwise."
Delay in bankruptcy is only bad news; that means a bigger hair cut for common and preferred
"For owners of preferred <4000 is there a cash number being tossed around, or is that depentant on how much the higher ups peal off the top?when was the last time anyone felt bullish about this piece of -------?"
"Dividend will come soon on the common shares....preferreds are being paid without interruption. Good conference call considering we knew that Q2 numbers were going to be devastating due to forced closures. 'We did finish the second quarter of 2020 with available liquidity of approximately $144 million when including cash on hand. Based upon cash collection trends since the reopening of our properties, including over 70% rate for July, we're assuming improved cash flow for the second half of the year, which should result in the company finishing 2020 with $150 million to $175 million of liquidity. The cash forecast does include approximately $50 million of redevelopment spend over the next six months. It also assumes that minimal common dividend payments are needed over the remainder of the year to address REIT distribution requirements.'"
"Right or wrong, I take my stance with the CEO and Director who just last week took money out of their pocket to purchase open market shares. The Direct bought $300k. That's a lot of moola and shows a lot of confidence."
When is the RSA expected to be Approved (approx.date)???

Am I the only one still holding this bag?
"Some interesting comments on WPG""I'm told by two analysts whose knowledge of WPG is impressive that management is committed to maintaining the $1.00 annual dividend. And the strong balance sheet tells me WPG can afford it.""""And -- surprise, surprise -- CFRA, the world's largest institutional research firm, which acquired Standard & Poor's Equity and Fund Research in 2016, agrees and has a buy rating on WPG."""
I hope this gets back to $8.
How was the earning guys?
"WPG is a criminal enterprise, as are many of the Wall Street operations. Obvious that the politicos are paid off and don't care about the sheep. If there was any justice, this CEO and all his cronies would be arrested and held in prison for trial, and convicted for 20+yrs."
Wpg     I have 5000 share
Any news on the BK RSA yet ????
The big dive is coming soon; it will happen quickly too ...
"Going back to $50 + soon. Shows how well this company is managed by a great CEO and his great cronies, they really care about the bag-holding sheep. A wonderful guy, deserves every penny of his multi-million $ paycheck and million $ bonus, and all the perks . Simply wonderful. Great future for WPG, should be paying high dividends soon."
Going to $0 quickly .... You'll fell for the bear trap yesterday ...
Wow 40% up
Normal vacancy rate is 5 Percent so 8 Percent is not Terrible
"I am extremely nervous and downright depressed about this entire situation. However, I've emailed WPG investor relations several times and they are adamant that management is negotiating with debt holders and no decisions have been made. Of course they have to say that, but if you think management is actually doing what they say they're doing, there could be hope yet. It sounds like debt reduction is critical to their survival at this point, so let's hope this drop in the stock price, intentional or not, will be effective at convincing bond holders to take the deal."
The price of WPG-PH and WPG-PI preferred shares are down more than 20% this morning. The price movement in the preferred shares for WPG nearly erases all of the gains in preferred shares over the last few months.
WPG-PH is up 21.72% to 2.69
"Read this article. WPG is already benefitting from this. What the article is referring to is that often the anchor stores either own the real estate separate from the mall or they pay almost nothing in rent to the mall operator to be an anchor store.About 2 years ago WPG bought several stores from Sears - the real estate - for cheap. Significantly less than they could build a building for. now these stores are becoming anything from more relevant retail to entertainment and restaurant uses. And these are folks that are paying rent, quite a bit more than their predecessor department stores, and bringing in just as much, if not more traffic to the mall. The question isn't: is retail dying or not? The question is: with the transformation in the retail landscape, what is the highest and best use for the underlying real estate? And for the real estate owners that understand that, this is a potential windfall, Not a handicap. And WPG has demonstrated that they understand this and they are making the necessary changes to not only avoid problems but capitalize on the transformation of retail.https://www.forbes.com/sites/sanfordstein/2020/02/07/macys-and-j-c-penney-have-a-real-estate-problem--among-other-things/amp/"
Pure gambling.
"OFFICAL EQUITY COMMITTEE IN ACTION and appoitned by the US TRUSTEE.They filed a motion to reconsider the approval of the order. Basically saying a lot of what we have been saying here already. That it's a smash and grab by SVP, that the cash hurdle and the compressed timeline is to discourage other bidders.That the value of WPG is far higher than what SVP and the lenders are claiming.Things are getting interesting.They have asked equity holders to wait on their recommendation before voting / electing."
"I see WPG as the most outrageous opportunity in the entire NYSE at this point in time. When I starting buying I knew instinctively as I looked at the world around me that the physical marketplace that has been around for millennia was not going to suddenly disappear. Every day it becomes more apparent the notion of Amazon totally destroying bricks and mortar retail is indeed a misguided belief. Most of the bad news is behind us now. Most of the irrelevant big box retailers are now gone. The tenant mixes are changing with the times, working towards the right balance of lifestyle tenancy and progressive retailers that have a strong online presence.I also see WPG's technical price action starting to improve. Shorting the retail REITs has become a very crowded trade at this point. Mostly amateurs shorting now as each each wave of selling fails to drive the price down near the September low of 3.11/sh. If we see the price rise to 4 in the coming weeks it will signal the bottom of a long downtrend as it will confirm that the stock price can't be driven to new lows. The short covering rally will be truly spectacular as the points I mentioned above become more obvious."
Don’t be tempted to buy WPG because it will definitely go below $1 when it starts trading on OTC.
what will happend to the pref? the price looks good
"EZ MONEY for 30 years Lou Conforti, CEO and Director stated: “We continue to prove our ability to access attractive capital to satisfy our redevelopment program whether via traditional or more creative means. This serves as a testament to our commitment to become the leading landlord of dominant town centers situated within secondary catchments.”Conforti added, “This transaction with Perennial illustrates our ability to arbitrage the unproductive land component of an asset by securing long term (30 year) capital at an attractive interest rate while still maintaining operational and financial control. When combined with the two previously announced outparcel transactions with Four Corners Property Trust, WPG has sourced approximately $206M in new strategic capital which satisfies approximately 40% of our previously announced department store repositioning plan.”"
I have been telling y'all for over a year that WPG was going BK; the next one is AHT ...
"WPG filed the form 25 to the NYSE making official their request for delisting. There will be no new ticker nor any stock trading after Sept 29th. Common shareholders will get 82 cents, give or take a penny"
"folks please read commentary on wpg on stocktwits....very good news, especially for bondholders"
"For reference, the original 2020 $0.50/yr dividend was going to cost $0.68/yr of FFO, including the preferred dividend. So a $0.25/yr dividend would cost around $0.34/yr. WPG will have an FFO of $0.80 to $1.00 in 2021, so they should be able to easily cover a $0.25/yr dividend next year."
"UPDATE: Two recent announcements are in addition to the 17 'addressed' vacancies.WPG announced that they had addressed 17 of 29 big box vacancies. To get to that 17 number, it's a combination of Opened stores, leases signed, LOIs signed or in two cases, demolition planned. According to supplemental data on Q3 financials, the new leases at Johnson City and Southgate announced this week were listed as 'active planning' in Q3 financials, thus are NEW announcements and not just LOIs becoming signed leases. I would extrapolate that WPG will be announcing that at least 19 of the 29 have now been addressed.(Note: WPG often refers to the 23 vacancies oy looking at tier one and open air centers. Both of the above were at enclosed malls, thus, the 29 figure which counts enclosed malls vacancies as well. This is probably even better considering these are harder vacancies to fill)"
Earnings 105 less RSA of 62 so loss is 43 MillionCompared to 82 Million in 2nd Qt of 2020Is that Correct?Also 92 percent of stores rented n paying no dividend and losing money Does not make senseIn 2019 9 times as many shares and paying a 1.00 Dividend Numbers just don’t add upJMO
This BK is really not looking good for common and preferred shareholders ...
I’m looking forward to when they start trading OTC. will purchase after the new ticker is WPGQ
"FYI It's virtually certain WPG is done trading, even on the OTC. Shares will be cancelled soon, mainly depending on logistics and paperwork, and shareholders will get 81, 82 or 83 cents depending on formula from the BK, everybody get the sameFor option holders, the OCC (options authority) will soon issue a memo moving the expiration date of all options to today. The share price determining options will be around 82 cents. OTM options will be worth less and ITM options will be paid out based on about 82 cents. Shouldn't take a long time but situations vary and brokers etc have to get their act together. Those on the short side of options will have some money deducted from their account to settle the payout but keep the rest of their premium. Just some common questions people have."
WPG-PI is up 21.97% to 2.72
Hearing that WPG common shares safest play.Friday bankruptcy deal is perilous and preferred shares could halve in value.
Are the preferreds going to pay a dividend?
"Sorry, I can not find any public news driving the big move up on WPG share prices today on above heavy volume. The common and preferred share prices are showing a lot of energy. I am happy for all of you.Is there some new investment analysis covering the long suffering commercial REIT sector? The price of shares in a few other beaten up REITs are doing well this morning. But not on the same magnitude as WPG so far. Check out today's charts on in PEI, SRG and AHT."
"what's the verdict, guys? sinking ship, or long term?"
Washington Prime is up 29.20% to 1.62
"Irony here is that the shares are worth well north of the current share price. I'm not sure what recourse commons have (injunction and class action?), but any price south of $3 is a rip off."
"Okay pundits, especially seeking alpha, let's remember two things going into Monday 1. They just refinanced a huge block of assets at a much lower interest rate. ""We refinanced a portfolio of four Open Air assets replacing a $47.6M mortgage loan with $117.0M. As the collateral is the same in both instances, it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out the value proposition as new proceeds are 2.46 times higher. By the way, the new fixed rate of interest is 3.67%, replacing a 7.5% coupon."" And 2. Now that that is closed they're really not as interest rate sensitive in the near term, they don't have any major refis for a while. The critical factor now is leasing, whichnis going very well. Leasing a former Sears to Fieldhouse is a huge increase to NOI and multiply that by 17 more leases coming on line in the next year or two. Seeking alpha is making a case for his own short position, hopefully he gets out of the weeds on interest rates and looks at the big picture - leasing. And sheds his short position. S&P at least was focused on the right factor when downgrading. But again, the big boxes are the x-factor. WPG doesn't have huge exposure to any one retailer. Basically the department stores and no name brands are going out of business and everyone is shopping factory direct like the Nike Store, Kate Spade, or Gap brands, everyone knows that and viable malls are adjusting. I don't see continued bankruptcies trickling in from old-hat, has-been brands being a huge surprise to WPG or any other mall operator and I don't see why bankruptcies would increase in the current envrironment. Many of the has-been brands have already died or it's at least apparent they are dieing at this point. I'm not an analyst but I am in the business and I think s&p is at least overreacting by downgrading WPG due to potential bunkruptcy exposure and like they are just plain wrong."
"The way I see it - There are real assets here with real tenants, paying real rent with the real sales coming in from real customers. The assets far outweigh the obligations. Traditional stock traders have little or no insight into REIT’s, or the current CRE market environment. WPG preferred stock issues are trading at an outrageously deep discount. I hope I’m right, and this is a true arbitrage."
"Atta boy, Lou, way to keep our spirits up! ""Lou Conforti, CEO and Director of Washington Prime Group stated: ""We continue to take advantage of the glaring disparity between our share price and noncore assets owned. The most recent definitive agreement for the sale of the fee interest or leasehold interest in eight outparcels totaling $14.2M equates to a ~6.5% capitalization rate.""""In addition to the Spirit transaction, Washington Prime Group anticipates various other sales of outparcels and other non-income-producing parcels to close by year end, which are expected to result in ~$50M of proceeds which will be utilized to fund previously announced redevelopment."""
if you read the last company info release or wait and listen to wensdays broadcast youll see why its a buy and several stock watchers agree its gonna go up maybe to 2.50 a share next month then again to $5.00 dollars after the commons start thier dividend again. they are already at 7% better occupancy then BEFORE COVID-19 LOL and still getting MORE clients.
someone wants to take over company very cheap
Tomorrow this will reach $3
CBLAQ better bet
"P/S=.07 P/B=.15 P/C=.45Even a complete liquidation of assets would give you a yield higher than share price. Not to mention squeeze potential. if 10,000 people each invest $1,000 in common shares we smoke shorts and raise price to only half the book value."
"What's the news on WPG? Are the meme traders focusing on WPG and PEI again today? At the moment, the WPG share price is up around 25% for the day. And the share price for PEI is up around 12% so far today."
"If you take the stock instead of the nothing cash, the new stock will be even more of a nothing. It will not be allowed to be sold for XX amount of time, and keep in mind the same CEO and cronies will be running this new scam of a new WPG, getting paid millions $ after bk-ing the old one. It's so profitable for them, they will do it again."
Why the preferred dropped after closing?!
2$+ Coming on the News
delist stock
Great news
"What doesn't the market get about this? The stick tanked because they lost 22 leases to Sears and Bonton Stores bankruptcy. They have solved 17 of 23 of those vacancies. Current quarter income is irrelevant we already knew it was bad. But it's going to good as soon as these 17 tennats start paying rent. Likely they can pay dividend with just the 17 tenants (75% filled at higher rates than before) , let alone once they fill all 23."
Investors will be short selling today thru 12/22. Most likely when they complete the reverse split this stocks will continue to go down. Still a good move for the company because lesser dividend obligation but a lost for common share holders.
"Next dividend of $.25 a certaintly, at least according to Conforti. He has reaffirmed $1.20 free cash flow coupled with $1.00 dividend for full year 2019. That includes the fourth quarter, which will be reported in late February or early March 2020. Dividend follows thereafter. Thus, he is indicating $.34 estimated free cash flow for the fourth quarter. If overall conditions continue to improve as he thinks they will, I doubt that a dividend reduction will follow in better times. Stock should be bottoming in current range and trend slowly but surely higher in coming weeks and months."
"I've been through a few bankruptcies, including Chesapeake, PEI, and CBL, and there has been a pattern to how events unfolded. This stock has been following those patterns. The question is always are they playing chicken with the bondholders while common and preferred stock holders face a high probability of extinction? It seems most of the time they go for the bk. They are being advised by attorneys and fees are always higher in bk than a settlement. To me, it seems they look at the total value of the stock and since the market cap is so small it is easy for them to write it off. PEI was a rare occurrence where the stock made it through untouched, but it sure was cheap while it was in proceedings. While I have lost a lot on bks I bought a fair amount of PEI at around $.43. The return has been very nice since they came out. CBL was another story. I lost significantly on that one as I accumulated more stock as it got cheaper. I stopped at some point and figured it out. I bought the bonds. The bonds are going to be converted to stock when they exit bankruptcy so I will have a significant stake in the new company. CBL is also throwing the shareholders a bone - 11% of the new company. FWIW you can see it is currently valued at about $.11 a share. Pretty big drop from $12.50 in 2017.Chesapeake was a case of cancelled shares. They took the opportunity to eliminate $7.75 billion in debt even while there cashflow would have likely covered the interest on the debt with the recovering price of oil. Shareholders got 0. Bondholders got the company with only $1.25 billion in debt.I didn't get out of WPG in time even though I was watching the hand as it wrote on the wall. Sold some in the $6s, some in the high $3s, and still have a couple thousand shares.Just because they have significant FFO doesn't mean they won't take this opportunity to convert bond debt to equity. If they do that the shares will likely be $0 or very close to it. On the other hand, they could pull off one of those rare restructurings of debt without canceling shares. But even when PEI announced that shareholders would not be cancelled the stock dropped significantly from its already low point as it went through chapter 11. If what you own is not significant to your portfolio, like it is not to mine, roll the dice and hope for the best. If your betting heavily on this going up I would be betting elsewhere."
Potential squeeze on WPG (common)?
Why short shares are coming out more and more? How?
Book value per restructuring agreement is $2.4 per preferred and $0.80 per common.
Lol Hedgies are desperate aff for that extra tax free cash.
"For anyone still thinking it will trade on the OTC, here is the relevant quote from the PR...The Company does not intend to arrange for listing or registration of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock on another stock exchange and does not plan to take any action to facilitate trading on an over-the-counter market."
how to get back to 16?
Likely they haven't established the effective date yet when the payout will occur. Likely the shares will stop trading altogether as soon as the payment is ready
Why people are buying this. I dont understand is this gon to bc.And going to delisting right.
PPL don't fall for the bear trap; common shares are going to $0 in the BK RSA ...
should i accept the plan and opt out?
"The ad hoc committee of preferred holders has filed an excellent objection to the Plan based on several issues. They include the argument that the company wasn't insolvent when it filed, was able to meet its obligations, that the company was grossly undervalued in the RSA and that the ""go shop"" provision required anyone making a offer to put up at least $2.3 billion in cash, whereas SVP, the Plan sponsor was deemed a qualified bidder and it was only required to put up $325 million. While I only own common, I may file a ""me too"" objection."
"After six months suffering, today I sold my entire position in WPGpH. I was bullish about the company, but this management is HORRIBLE and doesn´t protect shareholders.Good luck all longs here!!"
No other bids received that meet the required cash amount. the equity committee will have to fight now
"Unfortunately, this REIT won't liquidate, so nobody really knows the market value of these mall assets. Really bad for investors within the retail/mall industry."
"Strong selling into the end of the year drove the pps down 41.75. But volumes have returned to historic levels and the price is recovering, slowly but nicely, as investors realize negative headlines surrounding the Sears BK and likely liquidation is not really a negative for several mall owners including SPG and WPG.

"Since WPG's IPO in Nov 2015, the stock delivered 20 dividend payments totaling roughly $5 per share. ($0.25 quarterly over four years)Since then the stock price declined with a lost totalling $15.55 per share.If a person invested $100,000 (5,000 shares) in Nov 2015.They would have received $25,000 (Roughly $21,250 after tax) in Dividends.On paper they would have a $77,725 loss.last quarterly earning report and this quarterly report both have a .02 cent loss.You dont need to be Warren Buffet to know that the dividend will be ""adjusted"" soon.with this type of performance, how can anyone say this stock or the CEO is doing good.During the same time frame one could do better by investing into NOBL index fund which provides a better secured dividend and increases in value.If I'm wrong please tell me what I'm missing here?"
"Does Any Body Know This?All current WPG equity holders should read through the latest reorganization plan to understand the risks of ownership.

"Four Corners Property Trust (NYSE:FCPT), a real estate investment trust engaged in the ownership of high-quality, net-leased restaurant properties (""FCPT"" or the ""Company""), closed on the purchase of three additional restaurant properties today from Washington Prime Group Inc. (""WPG"") for $3.0 million. The three properties include a corporate-leased Chick-Fil-A, a corporate-leased Red Lobster and a franchisee-leased Hardee's restaurant located in Iowa. All are occupied under triple-net ground leases with an average remaining term of approximately 5 years. The transaction was priced at a capitalization rate consistent with our investment thresholds and past transactions."
"Another cocked-up BK. The winners--the incumbent management, the lawyers and the reorg advisors and accountants and the lenders to the reorganized company who steal the majority of the new equity. The losers--the common and preferred shareholders."

"WPG represents the darkest side of Capitalism, and a government that is run by shysters. CEO and cronies bk the company, walk away with pay and bonus, and even get high level positions in the new company that is formed out of the bk. Meanwhile, the everyday sheep stockholder is the bag-holder, they are ruined, all is lost. CEO is not even held accountable for his actions, promises, the misinformation. No wonder Socialism is getting such traction now."

"$WPG After officially filing for delisting with sec form 25, It's a virtual certainty now that WPG will be worth 82 cent when delisted (Give or take a penny) That certainty will make it very hard to pump last minute. For those still holding long, selling now at 95 cents is 13 cents more a share you can do something fun with instead of throwing away. Since the end game is fixed, I have no personal stake in people selling, just saying, no particular honor in going down with the ship"
WPG-PI is up 28.96% to 4.23
"Lou and his team ducked a question on the last earnings call about whether they could pay the dividend id stock rather than cash and still qualify for the 90% payout requirement. Given the cash needs to cover redevelopment costs, this seems a reasonable approach, especially if they will need to pay out a hefty dividend again next year to phantom income from forgiveness of debt on underwater properties turned over to the mortgage holder. As long as it is an elective dividend with at least 20% cash component, it qualifies. I would not be surprised to see this done for next year and I would have no objection to that approach. They could maintain the dollar dividend with 20 cents in cash and 80 cents in shares. This also avoids any dilution of existing shareholders while adding equity to the balance sheet."
"URGENT: Blackrock, the world's largest asset management firm, has quietly purchased 1/5 of the common shares of WPG. this was disclosed in an SEC filing late yesterday, look it up!Follow the money!!"

AMZN will take over WPG!
I will have 12800 of WPG which I would get because of option assignment .Will I be eligible to get post emergence company shares or I will get cash. Can anyone tell me.
"Could it be owners of less than 12,000 shares accumulating the minimum 12,000 shares necessary to get the new stock instead of 82 cents cash per share?"
After delisting who much will the common stock holders shall get in cash? I am reading 0.82$ somewhere. Am I right?
Amendment to credit agreement and update on July rental collections bode well for the future. I am finally beginning to feel positive for my investment in the common.
WPG shareholders you haven't seen the dive yet .. Its coming ...
Important fact. If the common stock has no value left then nobody should buy this stock. But watch stocks will be bought when trading resumes at discounted price . Why? When the company has no value then who is buying these stocks and for what ?
Not much additional information in the CC. They were very cautious in avoiding giving any real guidance for any expected 2020 results and shied away from commenting on the dividend beyond reiterating that they feel the current policy is maintainable (whatever that means). I do get the sense that they have the maturing debt situation for next year and much of 2021 well in hand. They sold off or returned most of the poorly performing assets to the secured lenders. A very good quarter not yet being recognized in the pps.

This stock is definitely going to be under a dollar when he goes to OTC that’s when I’m buying it.

"The long term trend here is for Malls to be one stop shop for everything from grocery's, entertainment, offices, restaurants, movies, bowling. As the population continues to grow in city centres, RE becomes more valuable. The flawed view is to think the Amazon/Walmart can replace all this. People don't want sprawling behemoths like Sears or JC Penny. That doesn't mean there isn't a place for new offerings."
There's a huge problem. There were no transactions and hence there was zero price discovery. We need to see some liquidations to see the real value of retail real estate assets! $WPG $PEI $MAC $SPG
"The current market prices of the common and preferred shares for WPG do not reflect the risks to the current equity holders as articulated in the latest RSA, imho. If you are an optimist, the RSA currently contemplates that common equity ""holder’s pro rata share of (A) $20.0 million or (B) 3.0625% of new common equity"" That's the max. The preferred shareholders appear to have a similar, separate distribution equation for new common equity as well. The possible risk is that the equity distribution in the nRSAc ould be changed or withdrawn at any time. Wait, there's more. The RSA also contemplates a follow along ""equity rights offering to raise up to $325.0 million in cash from the offer and sale of new common equity"" in the new organization. It's unclear if the offering transaction would be closed. TB"
Lets see who's falling for the bear trap this time ....
"Washington Prime Group ((WPG)) agrees to delay certain key bankruptcy deadlines to Aug. 30 from Aug. 12, after its equity committee challenged the speed of the proceedings, Bloomberg reports, citing WPG's lawyer in a hearing on Thursday.

No forbearance extension between the company and debtholders announced thus far this morning. Stay tuned as the status could change at any time. How much is the total legal and professional fees on the negotiations so far? The total cost must run into the of millions of dollars in fees per week by now. Let's hope the company is getting something for their money.

WPG Vs CBLAQ (CBL).WPG: stock price over 0.82 is a gift and bonus. Take it when you can.CBLAQ: Equity Class get 11% of Newco. Stock now below 20 cents. This can pop big time.
"Still believe in management. While they cannot control a pandemic, they continue to manage their business well. It won't be easy and won't be fast, but WPG will come back. They are making smart moves: Washington Prime Group Inc. (NYSE: WPG) today announced that it has launched Fulventory, an initiative which allows tenants to utilize space within the Company’s assets for last mile fulfillment and BOPIS (buy online and pickup in store), as well as inventory clearance. As BOPIS and BORIS (buy online and return in store) continue to gain traction with consumers, Fulventory captures the nexus between physical space and eCommerce and advances the symbiotic relationship which exists between the two."
"I am following the CBL bankruptcy because I hold preferred shares. In the market you need to learn from your mistakes to thrive and prosper. As near as I can tell WPG has a very similar capital structure, namely top heavy with preferred shares that were used for expansion. The management seems to have a similar lack of regard for shareholders. What I have learned is the the preferred shares are viewed as a convenient source of fodder. They can declare bankruptcy and they have no representation in court unless you have a million dollars to pony up for lawyers and accountants. In CBLs case they are writing off 600 million of obligation and unpaid dividends and they have no representation other than the board of directors who have other priority's. Lesson learned is there is no value in preferred shares to a company other than a convenient source of capital and an obligation to drop from the books in times of stress. Better to buy bonds for income. At least if the company is pushed to consider bankruptcy you have a seat at the table when reorganization is negotiated and you can always throw the preferred share holders to the wolves."
Is WPGGQ Trading New Company Shares?
"They called off the bidding process...no white knight is coming to save the common. As it stands right now, common may get gifted an 82 per share recovery that they are technically not legally entitled to. However, CBL bankruptcy hearing on Aug 11th may throw a wrench into this, if the judge in that case determines that CBL common shareholders are not entitled to any gift recovery at the expense of the preferred holders. If the judge were to rule that way in the CBL case, it could set precedent for the WPG case, and lawyers would argue that WPG commons should be entitled to nothing. In short, I think 82 cents in best case scenario for the commons here, and it is far from guaranteed that they will even receive that much. GLTA."

Department of justice is involved now. Bankruptcy will NOT be approved as is.
"One of the latest SA articles made it clear that WPG had a number levers they could pull, even before the updated covenant requirements expire next year.One of the scenarios includes leasing volumes continuing at the current pace and NOI improving due to rent collection going back to normal. In this scenario, WPG wouldn't even need an extension of the covenant modification, let alone any financial restructuring. If they were having rent or leasing issues, they could sell some of their properties (as they've done previously) to come into covenant compliance and/or extend the covenant mod.To require a financial restructuring, the economy would have to completely tank with leasing and rents falling off a cliff. Essentially, if you think the economy will be strong in 2021, be long WPG."
"WPG is headed down the same road as PEI and CBL. They canceled their common dividend then their Preferred dividend then missed an interest payment which everyone said was a negotiating tactic with their creditors. Next came the RSA which in the case of PEI was accepted because it did not impair share holders. CBL tried to do an RSA with its unsecured credit holders and leave out their secured creditors as unimpaired. Wells Fargo (secured creditor) called a non monetary default of the covenants and pushed CBL into bankruptcy before they were ready. It has turned into a complete mess and there is no telling where the bankruptcy is headed. Bottom line and I am a bottom line kind of guy, don't invest any money unless you are prepared to lose it all."
"If you remove the costs from filing bankruptcy (62.5m) the earnings would have been approximately -$1.76 so they would have beaten estimates by 40ish cents. Hopefully, this doesn't turn into another CHK but we'll see how things play out. Lots of value for an investor with deep enough pockets."
