"$WPG Interactive brokers on 10-10-21 suddenly assigned me a huge number of short shares of WPG.TEN3, a placeholder for the new private sharesDid this happen to anyone else? I know of one other person at IBKR.They claimed the shares were tendered attached to my short on 9-15 but didnt inform me until 10-10 at which time they took all the shares I used to cover my short in the meantime and made me greatly long the common stock instead and retroactively changed the borrow fees etc that had been assessed to my account dailyI am not happy to be trapped in a new short that can’t be covered. Collecting knowledge and others experience for the purposes of fighting this action"
"Was anyone contacted by WPG to keep their shares As it is my understanding that if You had 12,000 or more shares you did not have to sell your shares but you had to submit a formI believe in September If so how were you contactedEmail ?Date of emailOr did your Broker Contact YouWould be greatly appreciated"
"P/S=.07 P/B=.15 P/C=.45Even a complete liquidation of assets would give you a yield higher than share price. Not to mention squeeze potential. if 10,000 people each invest $1,000 in common shares we smoke shorts and raise price to only half the book value."
Likely they haven't established the effective date yet when the payout will occur. Likely the shares will stop trading altogether as soon as the payment is ready
"$WPG After officially filing for delisting with sec form 25, It's a virtual certainty now that WPG will be worth 82 cent when delisted (Give or take a penny) That certainty will make it very hard to pump last minute. For those still holding long, selling now at 95 cents is 13 cents more a share you can do something fun with instead of throwing away. Since the end game is fixed, I have no personal stake in people selling, just saying, no particular honor in going down with the ship"
Press release on the company website announces completion of restructuring. Article elsewhere said Conforti stepping down.
"Could it be owners of less than 12,000 shares accumulating the minimum 12,000 shares necessary to get the new stock instead of 82 cents cash per share?"
Ok - what happened? Who would be buying a stock for $1 that’s about to be delisted and only worth $0.82?
"Per the third amended plan supplement docket 1115, it sounds like people have 6 months to file the paperwork to get stock shares for their notes or stock. Sound like it to me, but it is all very confusing."
After delisting who much will the common stock holders shall get in cash? I am reading 0.82$ somewhere. Am I right?
I will have 12800 of WPG which I would get because of option assignment .Will I be eligible to get post emergence company shares or I will get cash. Can anyone tell me.
Is WPGGQ Trading New Company Shares?
and to all those that laughed at me yesterday for going long at 0.915. seriously good luck all.my target is only 1
"For anyone still thinking it will trade on the OTC, here is the relevant quote from the PR...The Company does not intend to arrange for listing or registration of the Common Stock or Preferred Stock on another stock exchange and does not plan to take any action to facilitate trading on an over-the-counter market."
Any idea how bond holders who aren’t able to submit their bonds for the new shares will be treated?
The big dive is coming soon; it will happen quickly too ...
"FYI It's virtually certain WPG is done trading, even on the OTC. Shares will be cancelled soon, mainly depending on logistics and paperwork, and shareholders will get 81, 82 or 83 cents depending on formula from the BK, everybody get the sameFor option holders, the OCC (options authority) will soon issue a memo moving the expiration date of all options to today. The share price determining options will be around 82 cents. OTM options will be worth less and ITM options will be paid out based on about 82 cents. Shouldn't take a long time but situations vary and brokers etc have to get their act together. Those on the short side of options will have some money deducted from their account to settle the payout but keep the rest of their premium. Just some common questions people have."
I have been telling y'all for over a year that WPG was going BK; the next one is AHT ...
WPG Vs CBLAQ (CBL).WPG: stock price over 0.82 is a gift and bonus. Take it when you can.CBLAQ: Equity Class get 11% of Newco. Stock now below 20 cents. This can pop big time.
"Does Any Body Know This?All current WPG equity holders should read through the latest reorganization plan to understand the risks of ownership. Or check out WYCO's comments on the WPG reorganization at Seeking Alpha. The most importantly, be aware that the plan indicates that equity in the new company will not be listed or traded on the OTC or any other markets. There is a minimum ownership requirement of 12,000 common shares or 4,000 preferred shares to receive shares in the new organization otherwise you will receive cash for your shares."
