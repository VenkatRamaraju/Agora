"Well I was going to put a detailed analysis of the 1st quarter results. Not the rosy picture WH released and parroted by the news services which apparently don't have any accountants checking results. However since nobody looks at this board I will save the effort and merely state that this stock should not be up 9+% based on what they reported, unless of course whoever is buying doesn't understand the accounting either."
Don’t see how you can be long here
Buying today with ccl and htz. This is so overblown
"since the split, both stocks going down...guess not the best management move."

Shares of Whirlpool Corp (WHR) continue to decline but finally the stock chart has hit major support. The $115 level is a major pivot from 2010 with Whirlpool now almost 50% off its 2018 highs. Swing traders should look for a bounce back to $125-$130 in the coming weeks. This is a classic technical setup for investors.
Going nowhere fast.
One of the worst hotel systems In U.S.
Wyndham back on its way to $50.00/share..... Giddyup.....
"Wyndham Hotels and Resorts (WH) Guests are not happy. The net is full of complaints. The hotels working under the Wyndham umbrella are not run according to customer demand. Obviously, Wyndham is selling their brands to everybody and has not been able to integrate all new hotels. Stock Market Performance; Today, the value of the WH share consists mostly of the goodwill of the name brands. But that value is being quickly eroded.All time high in June 2018 at 63.38 usd, shortly after the introduction. In July 2019 it had dropped to 58.79 usd. Price/book value = 4,19 and historic p/e = 40,77. A 50 % decline in near future is likely to happen..Jonas Bernholm (jonasbernholm@yahoo.com)"

1.6% dividend yield. Yahoo Finance doesn’t have the numbers up yet.

"Stayed at 3 different Wyndham hotels as we were driving the South East in the last week and a half and I wasn't real impressed with the quality. All were supposed to be business ""Suite"" type hotels, but the reality was they seemed pretty low end to me. Maybe I am turning into a hotel snob.Just an observation. I don't hold the stock and after seeing what they are selling, I won't be buying any time soon.I would be interested to see if anyone else has had good or bad experiences.At one in particular, the hotel desk clerk was particularly rude which made me wonder what kind of quality control the franchise has over the franchisees.If that clerk were my employee she would have been terminated on the spot. Traveler staying at your hotels need to be treated with respect. Without them you don't have a job.I guess it was just southern hospitality. Maybe they should launch that as a brand name and hire that clerk as the President and CEO."
WH just quietly cut the dividend from $1.28 to $0.32. It’s disappointing but not surprising.
What a dead board
Wyndham has been going HEAVY on ads lately. all my youtube video ads are wyndham

"It is strange that the listed companies WH and WYND still uses the name WYNDHAM. They are hotel operators. But they have dumped their properties to a number of Vacation Clubs. I made the mistake of becoming a member of the Club Wyndham Access. It cost 58379 usd (sic). The staff used a hard sell technique during 8-10 hours and finally I gave up. Afterwards you are left with lies and promises not kept. While the staff disappears and e-mail addresses don’t work…When you google on search words like “Wyndham Scams” a flood of dissatisfied people tell their tales. Whistleblowers, who reveal the Wyndham selling technique, have to be paid 20 million usd. The vacations offered are seldom available and extremely expensive. Wyndham Club and subsidiary RCI have 5 places on Sri Lanka (but nothing was available when I was there). A 5 % interest/dividend on 58379 usd will give circa 2919 usd/year.And the Condo maintenance costs for the Wyndham Club members cost 2632 usd/year.These 5551 usd will give Club-members 27 days of vacationI used hotel booking site Booking.com instead. They had more than 10000 items to choose from on Sri Lanka. They were mostly close to beach, clean, air-conditioned and with private toilet and bath etc. I paid circa 25 usd/night.This way I could get 222 hotel-nights on Sri Lanka and save the 58379 usd for myself. I believe that most people scammed by Wyndham like myself don’t use their services any more. The badwill will hurt WYN and WHs stock market performance. jonasbernholm@yahoo.com (Sweden)"

I expect WH and WYND to continue recovering nicely into the summer. It always seems to take the pros about a year to decide which piece of the spin off they want to buy.

"Nice write-up in Barron’s this weekend. Unfortunately no new insights. WH is asset-light, franchisees are able to pay their bills, and the hotels are less exposed to business travel. We already knew that but it’s still good to hear it confirmed."

Looks like the 16% dividend increase went unnoticed. Not many companies out there raising their payout as quickly as Wyndham over the last few years.

Once the PR comes out with the $WH deal I expect to see $OZSC gain some upward pressure. That's a great project that will prove fruitful for the pps of ozop energy!
