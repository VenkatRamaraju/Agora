1.6% dividend yield. Yahoo Finance doesn’t have the numbers up yet.
Once the PR comes out with the $WH deal I expect to see $OZSC gain some upward pressure. That's a great project that will prove fruitful for the pps of ozop energy!
Going nowhere fast.
Looks like the 16% dividend increase went unnoticed. Not many companies out there raising their payout as quickly as Wyndham over the last few years.
"I was inactive on my account so they took my points away. Tried to get back in but they had locked me out, wasted a hour trying to reset password. (may be I did not travel because of pandemic DHAAAAA).I do not work and can choose and afford to stay anywhere, it wont be here unless it is last room available.I took your points away WH"
Don’t see how you can be long here
"Well I was going to put a detailed analysis of the 1st quarter results. Not the rosy picture WH released and parroted by the news services which apparently don't have any accountants checking results. However since nobody looks at this board I will save the effort and merely state that this stock should not be up 9+% based on what they reported, unless of course whoever is buying doesn't understand the accounting either."
WH is down 13.10% to 33.94
shares are at 56. would this be a good time to get in? earning next week on 8/1.
"Wyndham Hotels and Resorts (WH) Guests are not happy. The net is full of complaints. The hotels working under the Wyndham umbrella are not run according to customer demand. Obviously, Wyndham is selling their brands to everybody and has not been able to integrate all new hotels. Stock Market Performance; Today, the value of the WH share consists mostly of the goodwill of the name brands. But that value is being quickly eroded.All time high in June 2018 at 63.38 usd, shortly after the introduction. In July 2019 it had dropped to 58.79 usd. Price/book value = 4,19 and historic p/e = 40,77. A 50 % decline in near future is likely to happen..Jonas Bernholm (jonasbernholm@yahoo.com)"
Buying today with ccl and htz. This is so overblown
WH just quietly cut the dividend from $1.28 to $0.32. It’s disappointing but not surprising.
"It is strange that the listed companies WH and WYND still uses the name WYNDHAM. They are hotel operators. But they have dumped their properties to a number of Vacation Clubs. I made the mistake of becoming a member of the Club Wyndham Access. It cost 58379 usd (sic). The staff used a hard sell technique during 8-10 hours and finally I gave up. Afterwards you are left with lies and promises not kept. While the staff disappears and e-mail addresses don’t work…When you google on search words like “Wyndham Scams” a flood of dissatisfied people tell their tales. Whistleblowers, who reveal the Wyndham selling technique, have to be paid 20 million usd. The vacations offered are seldom available and extremely expensive. Wyndham Club and subsidiary RCI have 5 places on Sri Lanka (but nothing was available when I was there). A 5 % interest/dividend on 58379 usd will give circa 2919 usd/year.And the Condo maintenance costs for the Wyndham Club members cost 2632 usd/year.These 5551 usd will give Club-members 27 days of vacationI used hotel booking site Booking.com instead. They had more than 10000 items to choose from on Sri Lanka. They were mostly close to beach, clean, air-conditioned and with private toilet and bath etc. I paid circa 25 usd/night.This way I could get 222 hotel-nights on Sri Lanka and save the 58379 usd for myself. I believe that most people scammed by Wyndham like myself don’t use their services any more. The badwill will hurt WYN and WHs stock market performance. jonasbernholm@yahoo.com (Sweden)"
