Congratulation Summit. Fantastic results announced today giving many patients new found hope.
Need some good news double digit coming soon.
"HM...do you expect any kind of feedback about 48 week results, I know they can't elaborate, but do you feel you can get a feel for what is up by their actions and words in cc, and agm these next few days"
Any word on JPM presentation this am.?
Hm..do you expect to hear anything about 48 week report in this week's cc or annual meeting
"Indeed Billy ... read my note to Mike just sent (after his note ""coming to the conclusion"") SRPT played a blinder this week ... but there is much PR smoke and mirrors that may have worked so far ... but the science is the science ... TRADERS DO NOT UNDERSTAND THIS (and can't possibly expected to) ... but it's the science that they are trading! Not just PR and marketing)"
Stock always flies day after good news. Expect buying to accelerate today
"the calm before the storm, eerie how quiet stock is"
Time to load up as they begin their next set of trails shortly. These new Super Hybrid antibiotics will be the future as traditional antibiotics have stopped working. Good morning America had a piece on it early this week saying more investment and products are needed.
There will be a huge return for those SMMT investors who have the patience to stay the course.
"As of 2 minutes ago the AIM market has seen nothing but buying all morning in the UK with increase of 3% SP ... although I'm not a huge advocate of wasting money on PR & marketing, perhaps the few lines in `The Times' about a less immediately profitable aspect of this company's portfolio has moved the SP? (Or perhaps an RNS about funding?) ... this will be interesting due to either reason!"
"EUREKA! I’ve been researching a direct way to interpret the early DMD 24 wk results that presents a simple meaningful but accurate explanation, beyond the detail of technical jargon and discovered something that is to me very profound:Glyn Edwards (CEO) in presenting a lecture at the HC Wainwright Conference on 10th April did just that! (for context link below … listen 12 minutes in on slide 9) He explains a 23% decrease in mean development myosin (MHCd) at wk 24s … this is a potential end point. Glyn says:In order to show a meaningful change “this is getting close to what we see in a related much milder form of the disease called Becker Muscular Dystrophy … this is clinically meaningful and significant.” For those who aren’t aware of Becker MD .. this is a much milder form of the disease and people with it usually survive into there 40s / 50’s and beyond.Crikey … if at 24 wks Ezutromid is already producing a reduction in the onset of the disease that can be compared to the effects of Becker … this for me is the easily understood layman’s poof. Any of the families affected by DMD would grasp an opportunity like this with open arms.IT’S WORKING IN A WAY THAT CAN CHANGE LIVES!http://wsw.com/webcast/hcw2/smmt/"
"HG.. kudos to you for hanging in with smmt for 6 years, don't know if I could have done it, hope your years of loyalty will be hugely rewarded in the near future"
"posted once on srpt site about looking into smmt, the responses were that even if smmt drug worked would soon be obsolete"
If you read the report from today Serapta gave them 22MM to complete enrollment.It Read Strategic Partner Serapta. Summit has a better more effective drug and SRPT is financing it untilit reaches the point to just take it over. Provided that the results are legit and they continue to shine there is no doubt SRPT willtake them out.
very disappointed this week with this stock
"now we know why he was so unprepared for that investor meeting. I knew it didn't feel right but too late to react now. lessons of biotech, don't keep your eggs in one basket."
Any reason for the recent move? or do you think it just has to do with PLSE and AUPH that Duggan owns a lot of getting FDA approvals?
Boyz - I think you are missing a good move today. SRPT is actually in a better position for an acquisition of SMMT than ever before. You have a superior drug with SMMT and a team from both Oxford and MIT working on other indications. This is a stock swap waiting to happen. Go SMMT!!!

Very sound results and sensible cut backs including the Board. Company now well positioned to develop the existing products with cash until Sept 2019. Up pre market in US and London.
any reason?
"This Yahoo Summit message board seems very quiet. Just Billy, Mike and me! I'm based in the UK and wonder if there are other USA message boards that we should post this info about the 24 wk DMD trial results already producing much improved prognosis akin to Becker MD. (i.e. extending life for late teens early 20's toward 40's / 50's) This is the first time IMO that there's a way to explain what this is about to ordinary P.I. folk. and there's finally a simple way to express this."
@mike... not sure if you are still around but if you are why It's Going up a little bit
Looks like there’s another major breakout of Ebola. Does anyone know if Summit has anything in the pipeline with their new mechanism antibiotic candidates. Seems to me that this would be a good fit for a new treatment?
EOY results now published on 11th April (this Wednesday) + CONFERENCE CALL
any mention of the 48 week results timetable
Tic Tock Tic Tock news anyway on the Corporate Update.
"I think like many of you ... given that we're so close to top line 48 wk results, it seems difficult looking at the facts, to understand why the SP isn't now moving up considerably. Over the years that I've been an investor, I've come to the conclusion that the devil is in some complex detail and not very sexy for new investors. That is exacerbated by the fact that Sarepta seems to operate in another universe where everything works in the polar opposite ... their gargantuan SP equally makes no sense, given the way FDA approval was so contentious and conditional on further trial results. Their investors seem little concerned with the reality that Summit is weeks away from a successful drug that may well go straight for FDA approval, taking their market share (which can only currently work with 13% of the boys ... whereas Summit is also designed to work with 100%!) If Summit produce the goods in a few weeks time and as likely, decide to go straight for FDA approval, will many of the Sarepta shareholders jump ship? Their Yahoo Finance forum reads like the wild west ... we don't want them here!"
"Great RNS : Summit Presents New 24-Week Analyses from PhaseOut DMD at the 2018 American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting ""Data show correlation between decrease in muscle damage and reduction in muscle inflammation in patients treated with ezutromid"" There is now enough positive data to kick the SP upwards towards expectations of an FDA approval coming as a result of 48 wk results Q3. Reaction in the UK SP is very strong ... I imagine the NASDAQ will finally go for this today."
"Up 10% in London today, should be a good day here today."
Looks like the big seller that was in there for the past week has exited. Getting out the week hands is good ￼news going forward.￼
"5,1 million shares, equal to 500.000 ADS, have been traded today in London at a price of 34,50 p per share, equal to USD 2,22 per ADS. Pretty interesting with the company presenting on Sep 6th"
They clearly believe that both solutions will be approved. Lots of advertising for pre launch positions.
"Latest thoughts from UK after various personal chats. At least they aren't doing an IMM or FARN in keeping a zombie drug going. (Companies in similar situations that pretended that a few weeks would turn things around and carry on) Much better to make the decision now and save on costs, as difficult as that will be for staff etc. They recently reported £27m cash, which will now go a lot further to ramp up the antibiotic work. Anti-biotics was the reason many became interested in Summit before it went to NASDAQ. C Diff work has $62m of Barda funding and are phase 3 ready. Over the years they have had many approaches for C.diff. One scenario could be we see offer being made for the whole lot (including all the tax losses).I would also think this will be the desire of Lansdowne (largest holder by far). They were in it for the big DMD prize so will want to get what they can out with a sale (IMO).Consensus of opinion amongst more knowledgable UK P.I.s who know the Summit B.O.D. is that the dust will settle and value will be brought back for most likely outcome - a sale. I will not sell this cheap when C Diff work alone will bring SP back in the meantime. If you have cash to spare, the current SP in the USA is well below current cash value of the company. My commiserations to everyone ... few P.I.s will see as much financial loss as I have today. Gutted."
"In the UK, we have company law which states anything being reported in a meeting that is SP sensitive, has to be published just before in what we call an ""RNS"" (so nobody in a meeting has information that they can call their broker with to buy or sell shares) ... is that how it works in the USA? So for example today, if Sarepta had their R&D day in the UK, any SP sensitive info would have to be published beforehand in an ""RNS""."
"Not a good day for me, I have seen what I thought was a good entry point several months ago turn into a red figure today and k owing we have at least another month to go till 48 week results , may drift lower till results, would have liked to dollar cost down but all in too soon!!"
"Congress passes 'right to try' experimental drug bill, allowing the critically ill to bypass FDA. Can’t help thinking this will be good for Summit."
"Quick summary by me ... if we have now reached a point where the drug is shown to have been well tolerated in boys who have all passed now the 48 wk stage, there are no reports of bad side effects, one must conclude that the effects on muscle in boys must follow the trend as expressed in mice. One presumes that the safety and efficacy of using this drug on the young boys is now well proven, and whether it's a question of just sustaining similar results to the 24 wk data, or indeed as seems likely, an improvement on those results, the mouse data is showing to be hugely relevant and following on through in humans. Sorry Billy but we don't seem to be able to correlate any info in the mice experiments that might state how long we expect the actual cumulative effect of muscle deterioration to carry on improving in humans?"
"Ok, HM...just wanted to let you know how much I appreciated the info,and have been doing my homework....added 500 more shares today....stock volume is not what I would have expected at this point...BUT DMD results are clear...and should be as good at 48 weeks...or better...N.Gonn.therapy research along with ridinilazole has great potential,and bio-platform for new antibiotic therapies in ever increasing resistance to current treatments in societal effected disease and potential “life changing” and potential “life saving” biologicals are just simply impressive....I’m in...not to a 6 figure belief...but to the “All in” belief that my funds allow....I’m also invested in another Biotech company currently involved in cancer and immuno therapy that could improve life and extend life for many (just lost my roommate from college to melanoma about 2 yrs ago now and saw what that dreadful disease does to a human...so just wanted to say thanks...will be patient and ready for results but also wanted to mention that this company’s value not merely based on DMD research but others as well..."
"being that srpt was brought up with its 6 billion market cap for 13% of dmd market, what will smmt market cap be with hug for 100% of dmd patients?"

STEPHEN A Cohen point72 Asset now own 5% of Summit - see recent SEC filing. This is huge that a leading Hedge Fund is a major investor in Summit.
Back to 8
"From the August 11 press release....""The trial’s primary endpoint seeks to prove ridinilazole’s superiority in sustained clinical response as compared to vancomycin.""From the trial page for Ridinilazole at clinicaltrials.gov .....Primary Outcome Measures : Sustained clinical response defined as clinical cure at the Assessment of Cure (AOC) visit and no recurrence of CDI within 30 days post end of treatment (EOT) [ Time Frame: Day 40 ]*************************So I guess those aren't the same thing? They sound the same. Did they actually change the primary endpoint when they announced they were going to combine the studies? Is the FDA being their usual peculiar bunch?"
Does anyone have an idea of how the value potential for MDGL compares with Summit @ 48 wk DMD result? I must admit that I would hope for more than additional 100% on 48 wk EZD results being what we anticipate. Would the value of Summit's EZD with approval through FDA be around say $1.5 billion? (It's very difficult to compare Summit to Sarepta which would give the value of the drug 5 times that figure if they owned EZD) I would expect x 3 of where we are now for the result we expect (i.e. that would make at least an application to FDA approval definitely on the cards?) ... maybe 7 times where we are today on EZD FDA approval. Has anyone done any guesstimate maths?
"just reached out to a good friend that works for a brokerage company, ask him to get some info and feedback on Summit,, got nothing back of substance told me they didn't see anything anything special and didn't see anything worth investing in"
"More great news everyone .....""FDA guidance to Sarepta could speed Summit's DMD path, says JMP Securities JMP Securities analyst Liisa Bayko noted that the FDA recently communicated to Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) that it would allow a statistically significant increase in de novo truncated dystrophin to serve as the basis for accelerated approval for golodirsen. She thinks this could also open the door for Summit Therapeutics (SMMT) to utilize utrophin as a potential biomarker for accelerated approval of ezutromid, its own Duchenne muscular dystrophy candidate, adding that she sees an accelerated path as upside to her valuation. Bayko keeps an Outperform rating and $42 price target on Summit shares.""Read more at: https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=2705462"

52 week high after hours
"Summit Therapeutics plc (NASDAQ: SMMT, AIM: SUMM) announces that Glyn Edwards, Chief Executive Officer, will present at the JMP Securities Life Sciences Conference on 21 June 2018 at 9:30am EDT in New York City."
really interesting how this stock suddenly moved up today with much more volume than usual lately. I feel a big announcement coming early next week
"After hours drop in price seems to reflect the Sept 21 General Report to SEC, where it looks like it will be a longer time to formal results and FDA OK of third stage."
"think we all need to relax and let this play out, if 48 week results as we expect we will be fine, if not, then we can figure out what is our next move if any!!"
"HOLD THE BUS!!! NEWS FLASH ... NEWS FLASH .... Some important info that's come to light having just talked to a DMD expert: Sarepta's new Gene Therapy work will still have an unmet need with 40% of the population who would reject the vector due to the genetic variations in effect of anti-bodies. This genetic therapy will NOT help 100% of boys. Summit's Ezutromid is the only therapy currently designed to work with 100% boys.This was mentioned at yesterday's R&D day delivery by Sarepta, but perhaps not heard under the sound of champagne corks popping!"
Enough money now support remaining programs for 3 years. Just hold on and we will get our money back in 2 years.
What incredible news! CONGRATULATIONS EVERYONE! Here comes SUMMIT ... especially for the DMD boys and their families. How long before Sarepta make a bid for Summit's DMD.
@mike...whats your take on HM report on AGM
"I've noticed that the SRPT YahooFinance message board seems to be slightly less hostile to SMMT info. I think they finally understand that the companies are supposedly partners and SRPT's interest in Genetic Trials even propelled its SP upward on the same day that their DMD drug Eteplirsen had EU approval turned down! They now see Summit as less of a threat simply because of the wide range of other partnerships. If GT work does produce results, IMO it's going too be several years and in the meantime Summit's partnership with them will also make them huge profits. Perhaps we may see some Sarepta investors take a look in this direction as additional investment opportunity. Over the past year or so, I've found the negative attitude to SMMT on by SRPT investors board quite shameful ... maybe the tide's turning? If you feel inclined to post stuff over there, I find the best way is to approach any Summit information as if you're simply seeing it as a huge endorsement for Sarepta (not competition) I think SRPT investors may also be interested in Summit as they realise how close this is all getting. I've always hoped that we may see a steady rise in SP towards results and in that way minimise our own exposure by selling some shares at profit before."
Great info Mike ... we have a Bank Holiday here today ... but interesting day on the NASDAQ!
"This is going to run like AXON. Even though the data did not meet the expectation, the company was offered 850 million for the study. This is huge potentials."
"all things considered, not a terrible day"
"Mr Glyn Edwards, Chief Executive Officer of Summit, commented: “The strength of the interim data from our PhaseOut DMD trial has bolstered our belief that ezutromid could become a new standard of care for all patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (‘DMD’). Thats a pretty powerful statement."
Summit completes initial dosing trials on Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug http://dlvr.it/Q23bbj Q1 2018 - Not long now before initial proof of concept for Professor Dame Kay Davies's team at Oxford University! This belt and braces approach to testing leaves NOTHING to chance! Designed for 100% of DMD boys ... not just akin to Sarepta's potential drug designed for 13% of sufferers. Summit has a market cap of $160Million compared to Sarepta with it's market cap of $3.62 Billion. Then if proof of concept in the New Year ... those with Becker MD (with the same number of sufferers will also want to be considered for Summit's drug. In addition ... Summit already has a C Diff cure running through P3 trials. The institutions will start to pile in here as it gets close to Q1 2018 .... DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!
"Sarepta's Eteplirsen has just been officially turned down the Europe. As expected, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a negative opinion against approval for Sarepta Therapeutics' (NASDAQ:SRPT) DMD med EXONDYS (eteplirsen). About a month ago, the company disclosed that a negative opinion was expected following the oral explanation trend vote."
We’ll this explains the big seller that was out there since the beginning of the month. Likely that this negative FDA outcome leaked out a while ago. The seller appears to be a large shareholder who was opportunistically unloading shares. Highly unlikely to be Duggan or a senior exec. SEC enforcement where are you??
@Mike Don't worry about Summit's less glittery PR ... the science is what's going to fix the boys ... not the spin of a marketing dept.
Well very interesting news out today that will see SH shares reduced to one fifth of their current holdings. We will then be listed on the Nasdaq gaining far great visibility. Expect the Share price to drop initially but in the long term to double from where it is today. Just hold and wait...
Offering?
"Something positive that I remembered from last weeks AGM that was skimmed over briefly. There was much excitement about the fact that Summit is very visible with PPDMD.(Parent's groups) If there is a positive 48wk RNS, simply the arithmetic involving numbers of boys eligible for Ezutromid compared to Eteplirsen will mean we surely have parent support in the proportion 87 to 13 banging on the doors of the FDA ... much larger compared to the numbers involved with Sarepta.One must remember it was the American parent groups and their posse of politicians that dragged Eteplirsen through the FDA crying and screaming ... NOT Sarepta shareholders."
"There's a great poster and longer term investor than me on ADVFN in the UK called Waterloo, who has a fine understanding of both the science and an ear to the ground re: status quo at Summit. Initially with reference to interest this weekend about Summit anti-biotics in The Times and Sunday Times, there's been interesting exchanges that I'm sure he won't mind me quoting a couple of extracts. Of particular interest is the reference to a ""natural history group ... running alongside"" (a control experiment of sorts ... not quite a placebo) : waterloo 28 May '18 - 12:47 They must be near some funding for either/both antibiotic programmes given the press piece. If most or all is via non dilutive grants (aka the $62m Barda grant), that in itself should raise sentiment and hopefully the SP. Might know pre AGM in 10 days.Lot's of moving parts but a rather important few months ahead.Hugus Maximus 28 May '18 - 14:44 - 23582 of 23584 Good points Waterloo. Many of us simply sitting on our hands in wait!I wonder if there's ever been what might be conceived as some sort of DMD placebo research carried out by Summit? Studies must have been carried out to look at the deterioration of muscle strength in DMD boys without the drug. My thinking being that if significant FDA endpoint is achieved (i.e. MRI / biomarker work) ... is there existing comparable data of boys muscle health who are not on the drug? That's not by any means a traditional ""placebo"" but something to argue a really strong case for approval before P3.Doesn't it also seem likely, (not a ""given"" but a good chance)that the FDA will see a case to allow Ezutromid onto the market whilst P3 trial continues. i.e. If a reliable EZD endpoint results at 48 wks, the precedent set by Sarepta's Eteplirsen surely suggests Summit should also be granted market access with a proviso that the decision is re-viewed after P3 results?waterloo 28 May '18 - 15:27 - 23583 of 23584As I understand it they are running a natural history group alongside. Not quite placebo but should give an indication, along with other collected natural histories, of disease progression against EZD dosed kids.In terms of FDA, the noises and recent paper by them is encouraging in overtly saying they will look at alternative endpoints (such as the MRI's) so it's certainly 'in play'. If the 48wk data shows continuing improvement they might well get conditional approval. Would be a different basis from SRPT, and in my view better, as it's an objective measure. If they also reported some functional improvements, such as 6MWT, then that would certainly help!"
In addition .. Glyn suggested SRPT expertise would be a huge asset in EU where they have a license. I suggested this is surely a conflict of interest as their helping us in the EU would also give us the ability to compete with them in USA? But I was told this was not the case and SRPT would have great earnings from RZD in EU. I personally still find this an extremely complex and bizarre scenario.
"Wow. This board is dead! Phase III results to come in the next few months - since they are combining the two studies now. Based on phase II trial, this looks promising to me. And, even if efficacy is only equal to that of Vanco, it's a win. Vanco is the last drug to be used - the medical community is afraid of resistance since it is what we use for MRSA. The community wants to not use Vanco unless absolutely necessary. Could be a good win here."
Anyone know the market size for ridinilazole? 600 mil market cap seems pretty high for this risky of a stock if ridinilazole only makes 50 mil per year
"Morning all ... if you haven't done so please would you look at my reply to Jim on Brad thread ""Ok, HM...just wanted to let you know"" re: SRPT. I'm worried that this morning on my MacBook with Safari, none of my very much considered replies appear. This Yahoo site is sometimes contrary and when you see ""Replies: 8"" to Brad's post ... you can only view 5. Can you all see my long comments in that thread?"
Billy ... flattery will get you everywhere ;-/ But seriously I'm very happy to supply any information in the gaps that I also had no idea about. There's a good Summit BB in the UK called ADVFN that I've learnt a lot from that over the past 5 or 6 years and we're lucky to have had input (though not so much recently through illness) from a clever medic whose a blood specialist and really understands the detail in the biochemistry ... the best thing about these BB's is the space to exchange information. Please do ask as many questions as you like and I'll get help from others in the uK if there are areas I don't understand fully. This is all looking good.
"Heading to $14 by Friday, news coming soon."
"I've just taken a look at the Sarepta BB and can barely believe the number of P.I.s discussing their Gene Therapy treatment as if it's simply sitting in the back room awaiting trials. There are a hugely large number of contentious issues with this ... namely the aspect that has been inducing cancer problems. Summit's Ezutromid should soon be waiting on the starting blocks for FDA approval in anticipation of helping a potential 100% of patients. Parent Groups are clearly primed and ready to endorse this ... and unlike Sarepta children and parents, they will have no need of motivation by money."
"In fact follow this guestimate timing for RNS with 48 wk results: Following the same schedule: 24 wk ""fully dosed"" announcement @ 20th Nov = data RNS @ 25th Jan (9 weeks INCLUDING Xmas and New Year)48 wk --------- ---------------- @ 20th April = data RNS @ 21st June (9 weeks INCLUDING 2 UK Bank Holidays)So RNS could be as early as 21 st JUNE following previous data RNS ... SO FIRST WEEK OF JULY?"
Clearly the Investors at yesterday’s conference were not impressed with him. He should give up doing presentations and stop praising the competition.
"What's up? Something is surely cooking... This 18% spike in SMMT stock price today on 20 times (2000%) volume is astonishing! This could not be simply because Summit CEO and Chairman Bob Duggan, a successful Pharma Executive, Scientologist, and Venture Capitalist invested another $50 million of his own money in this company. That is old news, the deal was completed one week ago, and cannot be the driver for today's stock action. Is something up with Ridinilazole?"
"40p in LOndon right now equals 2,64 USD in the ADR traded in NYC"
SRPT will definitely make a bid for Summit in the summer after the 48 weeks results.

Wow! buy the dip is sure on . . . in volume.
"<<>> So I decided to research companies that if one did enough homework, it might be possible to get good returns without suffering the problems involving international price of commodities which I did. I've not come across anything that's floated my boat like Summit ... flirted with IMM (lupus cure) but didn't stay in long as it didn't feel right and in the UK a company called Optibiotix which has an alternative fix to bringing down cholesterol. I had £5k in both for a while but after more and more research, I didn't like the fundamentals of their science and ended up over invested in Summit."

"$3 will be here tomorrow folks, Mark this post. Bill and myself have been on this board for 3 plus years and suffered the ups and downs. The pipeline is exciting and our new investor as a strong success history. Big breakout will happen."
"'Am confused why SMMT, which is partnered by SRPT, (who own its Ezutromid European license) are talked about regularly, both here and on sites like Seeking Alpha as ""competition""? Folk in the USA regularly attempt to diss what is actually great news for Sarepta investors? We are all in this together but perhaps there's fear that SMMT will steal SRPT's DMD market? SMMT is often trashed on BB's here ... not sure why when chances of success look good ... perhaps after 48 wk data possibility of an FDA approval aimed at helping 100% boys (not just 13% .. though as has been jumped on by naysayers ... at the moment SMMT has ""only"" approaching 70% success .... ""ONLY?????"") If the drug goes through, SRPT will undoubtedly simply buy SMMT or license the drug in all major territories (SMMT mkt cap $190 million SRPT mkt cap $4 Billion) Surely SRPT investors should be cheering on every small incremental utropin increase?) Data for the FDA will be belt n braces + 6MWT. Eteplirsen was not looking so good at this stage ... surely it's amazing news for SRPT shareholders? Yet I recognise many names on this SMMT BB who come over from SRPT to trash what is very positive data. Sadly the SP reflects this."
"pretty big haircut today, not happy!!"
Interesting Interview with the Telegraph yesterday. Some light for the future and he is correct about further investment. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/06/27/disappointment-summit-therapeutics-rare-disease-drug-flops-trials/amp/
one take i got from this call was that the relationship with SRPT was very strong. the CEO was very complimentary of them almost to the point of me questioning why he was.
"In addition Pfizer has just entered the DMD market by acquiring a company which has initiated a Phase 1b clinical trial for its mini-dystrophin gene therapy candidate, and one can't help wonder where all this might lead? Sarepta's $5.4 billion market cap with Eteplirsen helping 13% DMD sufferers versus Summit $235 million to help 100%. I've been a UK investor for 5 years and several years back Summit suggested that once this was proven to work for DMD ... there's good reason to assume this will fix Beckers MD (with same number of sufferers as DMD) Simply all this needs is for the 48 wk results to continue to increase along the lines of results for the 24 wk data ... no brainer. If progress follows the previous schedule, results expected around 12th July. This weeks positive Y/E figures will act as a wake-up call for the analysts to get on board and the SP will start to fly."
I seem to see that a UK holding company (Polar) filed on Tuesday that within the previous 10 days they'd bought up 7% of the company's stock. The float is getting pretty small.
"85% inside ownership plus great experienced pro investor management Any kind of good news and this explodes to the upside. Get in now, because in a couple months this is gonna be out of reach."
I'm bullish.
Expect more news in the next couples of weeks re their antibiotic compounds. Will be more positive news while we wait for the big results.
New IPO for UK stock only. Good news for US holders. Also money will be used for taking new product to market so clearly expect it to be approved 
"Hi Billy .. the work done on mdx (DMD) mice was phenomenal … I’ve cut and paste some basics below IN CHUNKS AS THIS USES MAX WORD COUNT (I promise you this really is a ""brief"" edit of the full document) but given the difference in the speed of mouse development to maturity (after 35 days female will be sexually mature) it’s really difficult to compare ongoing changes with that of humans. The longest dosing was only just a period of 5 weeks'ish. The only""end points"" discussed years ago with this trial were of course physical ... mice had physical endurance tests. It was much later that Summit found ways of negating the ambulatory tests as the only end points. However … I have attempted to cut together a precise of the work here (in least technical English as possible) and though still full of jargon, is worth taking some time to read because the results were really amazing. SMTC1100 is now called “Ezutromid”Conclusions and SignificanceOur work in the mdx mouse, which demonstrated that the loss of dystrophin could be compensated for by increasing the levels of the dystrophin-related protein, utrophin, we have developed novel small molecules which can transcriptionally upregulate the utrophin gene. The demonstration that increased utrophin can reduce the muscular dystrophy in the mdx mouse has been confirmed by others. Our early data from the mdx mouse suggested that increasing the levels of utrophin over two-fold would be of great benefit .Sedentary mice and drug treatmentThree week-old male mdx littermates were randomly split between 2 groups and treated with SMT C1100 (50 mg/kg) or vehicle only (phosphate buffered saline (PBS), 0.1% Tween-20, 5% DMSO) via daily i.p. injection for four weeks. Contractile properties were measured in EDL muscle dissected from eight week old untreated mice obtained at 4 week of age from Harlan (n = 5). In all other experiments described using the sedentary mdx mice dosing was by the oral gavage using a canula to deliver SMTC1100 or vehicle only on a daily basis for 28 days. At the end of this period the mice were sacrificed and muscle and blood samples were taken. Quantification of muscle and plasma levels of SMT"

"Here's a quick resume for NEW READERS! In terms of SMMT investment. What's clear - right here - right now, is that if you had $100 to invest today, Summit's current market cap of $220 million may well be worth $2 billion by end of year. ie if EZD 48 wk trials (results due July / Aug) simply follow on from 24 wk data (see results published in January) and EZD is taken to FDA who will likely approve it on qMR ""endpoint"" info alone, (See latest FDA approval terms for endorsement - MRI and biomarker info is now endpoint of choice) ... one can assume that the drug value would likely be $2 billion. I base this conservative figure on a company like Sarepta with a fix for only 13% DMD boys achieving mkt cap $5 Billion. Summit has a fix intended for 100% boys. However Summit have valued their treatment on the market at being around $100,000 per boy, per year as opposed to for example Sarepta who are currently charging $300,000 per boy per year. $2 billion is therefore a conservative comparison IMO.If this drug is then made available for 100% of DMD boys and mrkt cap is say $2 billion ... investment of $100 would be X 10 by year end = $1000. IMO the only risk folk are taking here is the very remote possibility that EZD 24 wk data was some fluke. (So there is a small risk still attached) We know the trial has been completed and NO safety issues. Just slight improvement in figures (continued build up off drug most likely to show improvement) will most likely result in a pass for qMR endpoint and in response the 6MWT and ambulatory functions will show actual positive effect. (Though as in Sarepta's case this was only shown to be tiny improvement at end of P2 ... not IMO relying on those figures which have historically been hard to show elsewhere) We also know that this drug will in principle help Becker MD sufferers ... that's the same number of sufferers again. Summit will also carry on increasing in value as C Diff and Gonorrhea drugs complete trials. C Diff has already passed P2 and shown to be very best in class .... keeping thousands of people alive who simply go into hospitals and pick up C Diff whilst undergoing routine operations. C Diff P3 trials 2019. Over the next few years millions will die from this without help.If I were to recommend someone investing $100 where to put it ""right here - right now"" ... there aren't many companies capable of such reward with this low risk. However ....DYOR."
News out - Summit Doses First Patient in Phase 3 Clinical Trials of Precision Antibiotic Ridinilazole for C. Difficile Infection • Trials Aim to Show Superiority of Ridinilazole Over Standard of Care Treatment Vancomycin • Health Economic Outcomes Included to Support Commercialisation
Hoping for a bump this week after the JPM event. Glyn needs to put on his Sales Hat on and increase market awareness about the firm. Enthusiasm and optimism should be the theme of the presentation rather than just clinical data.
Summit valued @ $44 :-https://seekingalpha.com/article/4135902-summit-therapeutics-undervalued-potential-blockbuster-pipeline?
Why are there no people discussing how great SMMT is and their management? I am happy to scoop up shares at low prices all day knowing Bob Duggan is running this ship. Look at what he did with PCYC and ABBV. Once word gets out on this volumes should start rising and share price as well.
"I’m coming to the conclusion we will be sold. If both of our lead products are successful we have no marketing or Sales Team. Obviously there will be Licensing opportunities and or Partnerships but the quickest route to market will be acquisition. We just don’t have the management team to take us to the next level. Although we won’t make as much money, we will be put out of our misery in the next few months. We can then all move on to other investment opportunities. I would take $25 a share here and now. Two years of stress will be over for me. HM, don’t know how you have held this for 6 years."
"Breaking news - OXFORD, U.K. and CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Aug. 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Summit Therapeutics plc (NASDAQ: SMMT, AIM: SUMM) announces today the publication in the journal PLOS ONE of microbiome analyses highlighting ridinilazole as a precision antibiotic in development for the treatment of C. difficile infection (‘CDI’)."
"@mike Summit make shelf filings every year, giving them the option to raise if and when needed. This is a standard annual submission."
What’s up with this now?
@mike...what are chances smmt goes for conditional approval after 48 week results?
"Funny how stock market works, smmt who may have a drug to help 100% of dmd patients gets no love, while srpt has a drug that only treats 13% of dmd patients and probably doesn't even work and yet srpt going to the moon while smmt barely even noticed"
"HM, hope you don't mind my questions, why 5 for 1 price and share difference between U.S. and U.K."
recent buyout of Discuva is game changer here. we will be much higher in a year's time.
"Whatever SRPT PR and marketing machine achieved last week, SMMT are still the only outfit with a fix aimed at <100% boys with 48 wk trial finished and P2 results due July (Aug/Sep) .. if as successful as 24 wk data, SMMT confirmed at AGM it will file for FDA approval. The science is the science. Even if SRPT get over the major hurdles of Microdystrophin not producing a “normal” protein amino acid sequence (making the “dystrophin” protein immunogenetic,) and get approval IMO 4-5 years ... this will still only be for 60% of DMD boys ... by which time Summit's drug should have a firm grip on the market. This is science fact and will not change because the CEO was honest about the first achievements in SRPT's crusade to use Gene Therapy ... it was apparently groundbreaking. However in the 60's scientists told us that they would have the cure for cancer by the 70's .... Gene Therapy is early days. The fundamental mechanism still can't get the gene delivering vector to stay in the DNA for long periods of time, and yet the treatment cannot be repeated of the same patient. SRPT's perfect PR delivery (and fabulous management skills) cannot yet make a DMD drug with the potential to fix 100% boys ... SMMT can! However - it seems that shareholders do not understand the science until it's staring them in the face ... which this will. So meantime, tell your families, friends and neighbours."
Will jmp presentation be available on the web?
Back to 7
Wonder where it is going to stop.
Moving up into close. Should hit $3 and then $4 by next week. Any buyout if needed would be at $10 min. SRPT will buy Summit in the next few days to save face having invested $400m in them.
This is worth $25 right now. Hold long term for a Buy Out at $1B or $75.
SRPT results this week. I have a feeling SMMT will be mentioned again during CC.
After weeks of Hype that Summit will present new data at JPM we are all proud to introduce our next speaker the CEO of Summit...applause“As CEO of Summit I just wanted to note how awesome sarepta is...um Um. Sorry forgot what else I was supposed to say.” Have a Good Day!
"I put the following query on ADVFN UK message board: ""In response to recent DMD trial endpoint research & FDA approval changes, is Ezutromid approval no longer conditional on some sort of functional stability or improvement data?"" A respected UK medical knowledge replies ""I guess it’s a possibility, Hugus. And a pretty good possibility at that."" Does anyone else agree that this notion puts Summit's FDA approval likely if simply replicating 24 wk data at 48 wks? (Though of course it's likely that the data will improve.)"
"@Keith Perhaps I've missed your posts but get the impression you've not been on the SMMT message board very long but I see that you have a general interest in pharmaceuticals. The multi-billion dollar question being asked by long term investors (either AIM like me from the UK and involved for 6 years or more recent NASDAQ P.I.'s) is:- ""why don't investors looking at this share not beg, borrow or steal money from their grannies in order to buy in big time, as after much analysis there is certainly no hidden agenda? Given the current outlook for this share, do you have any insight as to why the NASDAQ SP isn't at least $30 dollars? I can think of many scenarios where a far great risk versus reward scenario has seen the SP rise significantly as a company like this approaches such a huge potential zenith. (i.e. The approach to 48 wks) We know that investment analysts don't have the time to look beyond charts but I'm surprised not see more P.I.'s simply doing their own research and finding after a few hours reading, that this statistically represents such returns for little investment?"
"Little action at the moment, expect this will be the norm until July. May see a pick up late May/June as we build expectations."
"Things could hot up here if Glyn Edwards is currently pushing through MRI as an ""end point"" for the FDA. Summit's MRI work has already shown good results in 24 wks ... if this continues on through to 48 wks and becomes the way to conclude Utrophin Modulation is the way forward, ... be good if an RNS to this effect woke the market up to quite how close Ezutromid could be to bringing in something truly miraculous for the boys. Meanwhile Summit still pursue their David and Goliath modus operandi ... it looks like paying off this summer. (Dame Professor Kay Davies said today in her role as Vice President to the UK Muscular Dystrophy, the ""spring"" should see quite some turn around for good news)"
"HM... I've asked you this similar question but I'm going to rephrase it maybe you will have the interim looking for, in the mouse trials as time went on have the effects of ezd. increased, for instance did they to a 24 week study and then in 48 weeks increase in the benefits of ezt. treatment as time went on"
"@Brad Welcome ... you've joined at an extremely critical moment for DMD. We guess that 48 wk data report should be out in July (Though RNS suggests ""Q3"" ... following the 24 wk analysis report timetable, similar timing would suggest mid June ... so adding an extra month for such important announcement would make mid July) There is no need to pump up some nonsense because you have already bought shares ... therefore a quick summary: Out of all the DMD work currently available to <100% DMD boys, Summit is the only potential one. The multi-billion dollar Sarepta currently only has a drug on the market (called ""eteplirsen"" or ""Exondys 51"") that can help <13% of boys due to a genetic effect.(they have involvement in a pipeline drug additional potential <18%) Even the new Sarepta Gene Therapy work announced with such a spectacular SP ""up"" this week, can only treat 60% max. That is some years off FDA approval. Summit will take Ezutromid therapy immediately for FDA approval if 48 wk results are simply as good as 24 wk results. (A promise made by CEO at AGM earlier this month) Summit approx market cap $200 million ... Sarepata current market cap $9 Billion ... it's that simple! Summit have a NON EXCLUSIVE development deal with Sarepta and pipeline promise of $500 million, 45% shared development cost in return for just EU rights ... and some small territories) If successful ... worry of T/O or DMD drug being bought out ... but after 48 wks that would have to be at least IMO SP worth X 5. Only two major institutional shareholders involved and main one is Lansdowne who have been (like me) here over 5 years ... so they won't be selling out cheap because the SP is not a million miles away right now of where it was when I bought. So far this company seems to have been the best kept secret. IMHO ... that's because 1. The DMD market has always been seen as dodgy by investors until Sarepta had their very controversial decision made by FDA after parent and political pressure to pass Eteplirsen ... that made them a multi-billion dollar company 2. Basic American chauvinism for Sarepta who have been very cleverly managed ... their SP astounds many but Summit has never been fully understood by most investors .... 3. the science is complex and will most likely put off many folk. (the premise of utrophin modulation to change dystrophin levels seems odd to grasp?) 4. Summit research has been fronted here in UK by renowned scientist Dame Kay Davies who has spent her life on this project with her team at Oxford University ... she and her team are awesome. In England the title of ""Dame"" is akin to a Knighthood ... she is the real deal and the pipeline of drugs set to come in on the back of the one awaiting results is also wonderful. There is very much fine detail in the science that would take pages ... and PLEASE anyone reading this, now add to my comments which will most likely have missed some basics."
I suspect today's RNS is as close as they'll get to being critical of Sarepta's poor research data ... here's Summit wallowing in it's forensic modus operandi ... great work Summit :http://inpublic.globenewswire.com/releaseDetails.faces?rId=2176045

Hi ... Billy The capitalisation seems to work well for me at this figure. I'd be very happy if the company made it onto the DMD market at just say (in UK currency) £2 Billion ... that makes the shares worth £24 ... and that's 15 times my purchase price £1.60 . However if one takes into account the success of Sarepta at $5 billion with 13% boys accessible ... Summit only needs to hit the first 24 wk P2 Ezutromid success rate of 65% of boys to see a market cap many more times than $2 Billion. I'm certainly not worried by 81 million shares with a market cap of around $200 million. BTW - they've been a public company in the UK for years and years (I'm a new comer and only been investing for 6 years!) They came too the NASDAQ just 3 years ago after a long run on AIM in the UK. Professor Dame Kay Davies (the head of the research team at Oxford University) has been working on this for 25 years ... this is her life's work and she will doubtless see the fruits of her work start to come to fruition this later in the year.
Up 16.06% today on increased volume. Something dramatic must be going on with their ridinilazole phase 3 trial.
Absolutely correct Mike ... I just took a look and analysts anticipating results 4th April.
I also want to mention that there are now listed opens in the US on SMMT. From what i can see someone purchased 233 oct12.5puts @ 3.10. they question is this a hedge or someone collecting a rich premium here willing to get put stock below 9.5 bucks.
"AGM was today, anyone out there who attended?"
"And now up 7% in US pre-market. Think folks need to understand the significance of the $62m grant locked in. When you factor in the cash we have plus the $4.5m recently announced, we have enough cash now to take both products to market. That’s huge!"
I joined. I'm ready to party with Mike and Billy
"why the pop?, anyone know anything?"
"To Summ up ... the C Diff drug RZD, is still 18 months away from access to market as it needs P3 trials (unlike EZD, there are other old fashioned anti-biotics dealing, albeit badly, with the problem ... so RZD can't apply for Orphan Drug status where Big Pharma sees the many multiple billion dollar deals)"
Hi Billy ... The article covers four other dreadful conditions but i've quoted the DMD specifically HM
"Summit extract from interesting Madison .com February article on summary of risk / reward for 3 Boom-or-Bust Biotech Stocks to Buy in 2018 (Edit by HM - NOTE RE COMMENTS about 48 wks following on from 24 wks it agrees with our sentiment ...""IF THAT DATA HOLDS UP, THEN REGULATORS MIGHT CONSIDER AWARDING EZUTROMID ACCELERATED APPROVAL"" i.e. If data continues as 24 wks ... the result will be a success) Article here >>>>>>newsfeedback @ fool .com (Todd Campbell) Feb 4, 2018Sarepta Therapeutics (NASDAQ: SRPT) Exondys 51 is the only drug approved to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in the U.S., and it can only be used in about 13% of DMD patients. New treatment options that can address everyone with DMD are needed, and Summit Therapeutics will find out later this year if it has a shot at doing that.Summit Therapeutics is developing ezutromid, a drug that works differently from Exondys 51. While Exondys 51 skips mutations to boost production of dystrophin, a muscle-building protein, ezumtromid increases production of utrophin, another protein that has a similar muscle-building roll.In healthy people, utrophin is produced in the early stages of muscle development, however, it shuts off as muscles mature and dystrophin takes over. Since DMD patients don't produce enough dystrophin, boosting utrophin production may slow disease progression.Recently, the company presented 24-week interim phase 2 study results that were intriguing, and final results from its 48-week trial are expected in Q3 2018. At the 24-week mark, ezumtromid patients had increased utrophin expression and a reduction in muscle damage. If that data holds up, then regulators might consider awarding ezutromid an accelerated approval.That could be a big win. Despite only being used to treat a small percentage of DMD patients and only being on the market a little over a year, Exondys 51's selling at an annualized pace north of $228 million. An eventual approval wouldn't be bad news to Sarepta Therapeutics, though. It licensed rights to ezutromid in 2016, so if it's successful, both it and Summit Therapeutics investors could be rewarded.While ezutromid has the potential to be a nine-figure drug, investors might want to keep some of their optimism in check. After all, Exondys 51's approval was far from a lock, and it remains to be seen how regulators might view an increase utrophin production as a surrogate endpoint worthy of approval."
Ok @HM and others...bought shares today...I’m liking the C.Diff story for sure and bought shares on that basis alone...still researching THE DMD story..and would love some insight from y’all guys if willing to share...but I’m glad to own the shares I do....may add more as I go...

"An up day and hopefully the bleeding will stop. Next stop $3 with the upgrade of $4 a share. Next week we should get an update on the cost cutting measures and revised cash flow forecast. Don’t get me wrong, we all had a painful week but we actually have a better opportunity of making serious money at these levels than we did before.
