"$3 will be here tomorrow folks, Mark this post. Bill and myself have been on this board for 3 plus years and suffered the ups and downs. The pipeline is exciting and our new investor as a strong success history. Big breakout will happen."
Wow! buy the dip is sure on . . . in volume.
"From the August 11 press release....""The trial’s primary endpoint seeks to prove ridinilazole’s superiority in sustained clinical response as compared to vancomycin.""From the trial page for Ridinilazole at clinicaltrials.gov .....Primary Outcome Measures : Sustained clinical response defined as clinical cure at the Assessment of Cure (AOC) visit and no recurrence of CDI within 30 days post end of treatment (EOT) [ Time Frame: Day 40 ]*************************So I guess those aren't the same thing? They sound the same. Did they actually change the primary endpoint when they announced they were going to combine the studies? Is the FDA being their usual peculiar bunch?"
Anyone know the market size for ridinilazole? 600 mil market cap seems pretty high for this risky of a stock if ridinilazole only makes 50 mil per year

"85% inside ownership plus great experienced pro investor management Any kind of good news and this explodes to the upside. Get in now, because in a couple months this is gonna be out of reach."
STEPHEN A Cohen point72 Asset now own 5% of Summit - see recent SEC filing. This is huge that a leading Hedge Fund is a major investor in Summit.
"Ok, HM...just wanted to let you know how much I appreciated the info,and have been doing my homework....added 500 more shares today....stock volume is not what I would have expected at this point...BUT DMD results are clear...and should be as good at 48 weeks...or better...N.Gonn.therapy research along with ridinilazole has great potential,and bio-platform for new antibiotic therapies in ever increasing resistance to current treatments in societal effected disease and potential “life changing” and potential “life saving” biologicals are just simply impressive....I’m in...not to a 6 figure belief...but to the “All in” belief that my funds allow....I’m also invested in another Biotech company currently involved in cancer and immuno therapy that could improve life and extend life for many (just lost my roommate from college to melanoma about 2 yrs ago now and saw what that dreadful disease does to a human...so just wanted to say thanks...will be patient and ready for results but also wanted to mention that this company’s value not merely based on DMD research but others as well..."
"Wow. This board is dead! Phase III results to come in the next few months - since they are combining the two studies now. Based on phase II trial, this looks promising to me. And, even if efficacy is only equal to that of Vanco, it's a win. Vanco is the last drug to be used - the medical community is afraid of resistance since it is what we use for MRSA. The community wants to not use Vanco unless absolutely necessary. Could be a good win here."
Moving up into close. Should hit $3 and then $4 by next week. Any buyout if needed would be at $10 min. SRPT will buy Summit in the next few days to save face having invested $400m in them.
"And now up 7% in US pre-market. Think folks need to understand the significance of the $62m grant locked in. When you factor in the cash we have plus the $4.5m recently announced, we have enough cash now to take both products to market. That’s huge!"
Absolutely correct Mike ... I just took a look and analysts anticipating results 4th April.
"After hours drop in price seems to reflect the Sept 21 General Report to SEC, where it looks like it will be a longer time to formal results and FDA OK of third stage."
"the calm before the storm, eerie how quiet stock is"
"Wow EOY results better than I thought, now for the CC"
Clearly the Investors at yesterday’s conference were not impressed with him. He should give up doing presentations and stop praising the competition.

We’ll this explains the big seller that was out there since the beginning of the month. Likely that this negative FDA outcome leaked out a while ago. The seller appears to be a large shareholder who was opportunistically unloading shares. Highly unlikely to be Duggan or a senior exec. SEC enforcement where are you??
any reason?
"<<>> So I decided to research companies that if one did enough homework, it might be possible to get good returns without suffering the problems involving international price of commodities which I did. I've not come across anything that's floated my boat like Summit ... flirted with IMM (lupus cure) but didn't stay in long as it didn't feel right and in the UK a company called Optibiotix which has an alternative fix to bringing down cholesterol. I had £5k in both for a while but after more and more research, I didn't like the fundamentals of their science and ended up over invested in Summit."
"anybody know what the shares outstanding is for summit, have seen several different figures I don't know why"
"Nearly all Sarepta followers saw this coming.MoreBio Stocks Retweeted Bio Stocks$SMMT Ezutromid Development to be Discontinued.Bio Stocks added,"
Looks like the big seller that was in there for the past week has exited. Getting out the week hands is good ￼news going forward.￼
"What's up? Something is surely cooking... This 18% spike in SMMT stock price today on 20 times (2000%) volume is astonishing! This could not be simply because Summit CEO and Chairman Bob Duggan, a successful Pharma Executive, Scientologist, and Venture Capitalist invested another $50 million of his own money in this company. That is old news, the deal was completed one week ago, and cannot be the driver for today's stock action. Is something up with Ridinilazole?"
Hi ... Billy The capitalisation seems to work well for me at this figure. I'd be very happy if the company made it onto the DMD market at just say (in UK currency) £2 Billion ... that makes the shares worth £24 ... and that's 15 times my purchase price £1.60 . However if one takes into account the success of Sarepta at $5 billion with 13% boys accessible ... Summit only needs to hit the first 24 wk P2 Ezutromid success rate of 65% of boys to see a market cap many more times than $2 Billion. I'm certainly not worried by 81 million shares with a market cap of around $200 million. BTW - they've been a public company in the UK for years and years (I'm a new comer and only been investing for 6 years!) They came too the NASDAQ just 3 years ago after a long run on AIM in the UK. Professor Dame Kay Davies (the head of the research team at Oxford University) has been working on this for 25 years ... this is her life's work and she will doubtless see the fruits of her work start to come to fruition this later in the year.
Offering?
"Here's a quick resume for NEW READERS! In terms of SMMT investment. What's clear - right here - right now, is that if you had $100 to invest today, Summit's current market cap of $220 million may well be worth $2 billion by end of year. ie if EZD 48 wk trials (results due July / Aug) simply follow on from 24 wk data (see results published in January) and EZD is taken to FDA who will likely approve it on qMR ""endpoint"" info alone, (See latest FDA approval terms for endorsement - MRI and biomarker info is now endpoint of choice) ... one can assume that the drug value would likely be $2 billion. I base this conservative figure on a company like Sarepta with a fix for only 13% DMD boys achieving mkt cap $5 Billion. Summit has a fix intended for 100% boys. However Summit have valued their treatment on the market at being around $100,000 per boy, per year as opposed to for example Sarepta who are currently charging $300,000 per boy per year. $2 billion is therefore a conservative comparison IMO.If this drug is then made available for 100% of DMD boys and mrkt cap is say $2 billion ... investment of $100 would be X 10 by year end = $1000. IMO the only risk folk are taking here is the very remote possibility that EZD 24 wk data was some fluke. (So there is a small risk still attached) We know the trial has been completed and NO safety issues. Just slight improvement in figures (continued build up off drug most likely to show improvement) will most likely result in a pass for qMR endpoint and in response the 6MWT and ambulatory functions will show actual positive effect. (Though as in Sarepta's case this was only shown to be tiny improvement at end of P2 ... not IMO relying on those figures which have historically been hard to show elsewhere) We also know that this drug will in principle help Becker MD sufferers ... that's the same number of sufferers again. Summit will also carry on increasing in value as C Diff and Gonorrhea drugs complete trials. C Diff has already passed P2 and shown to be very best in class .... keeping thousands of people alive who simply go into hospitals and pick up C Diff whilst undergoing routine operations. C Diff P3 trials 2019. Over the next few years millions will die from this without help.If I were to recommend someone investing $100 where to put it ""right here - right now"" ... there aren't many companies capable of such reward with this low risk. However ....DYOR."
"Mr Glyn Edwards, Chief Executive Officer of Summit, commented: “The strength of the interim data from our PhaseOut DMD trial has bolstered our belief that ezutromid could become a new standard of care for all patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (‘DMD’). Thats a pretty powerful statement."
I seem to see that a UK holding company (Polar) filed on Tuesday that within the previous 10 days they'd bought up 7% of the company's stock. The float is getting pretty small.
Why are there no people discussing how great SMMT is and their management? I am happy to scoop up shares at low prices all day knowing Bob Duggan is running this ship. Look at what he did with PCYC and ABBV. Once word gets out on this volumes should start rising and share price as well.
EOY results now published on 11th April (this Wednesday) + CONFERENCE CALL
Hoping for a bump this week after the JPM event. Glyn needs to put on his Sales Hat on and increase market awareness about the firm. Enthusiasm and optimism should be the theme of the presentation rather than just clinical data.
"Summit Therapeutics plc (NASDAQ: SMMT, AIM: SUMM) announces that Glyn Edwards, Chief Executive Officer, will present at the JMP Securities Life Sciences Conference on 21 June 2018 at 9:30am EDT in New York City."
w/o a doubt one of the most exciting stocks ive been in
I'm bullish.
"Billy where are you based? Same to you Rob, We know HM is in the UK and I’m in Massachusetts"
"Sarepta's Eteplirsen has just been officially turned down the Europe. As expected, the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a negative opinion against approval for Sarepta Therapeutics' (NASDAQ:SRPT) DMD med EXONDYS (eteplirsen). About a month ago, the company disclosed that a negative opinion was expected following the oral explanation trend vote."
