How many stocks in the EV space have a prospective PE of around 5?
"Over the years, the Bel B shares normally trade at a $1 to $2 premuim over the A shares - which would make them $16 to $17 - when will they adjust?"
Just need Boeing to make a small comeback.
"CFO bought some shares. According to today's Form 4 filing. Well that's a bit of positive news, on an otherwise ugly market day."
Trading seems to be halted after hours - anyone know why?
Biggest position of my portfolio! Cheers to all the longs!
If these numbers don't drive the stock up today I don't know what will
"Back to the $12's. Wow didn't think I'd be able to buy BELFB this low after the terrific Q2 report. Stock is pretty much back to where it was trading before the funky index removal dip, and the Q2 results. Even though Q2 showed a dramatic sequential improvement in earnings over Q1 (the Q1 earnings were all from a 1-time gain) and a HUGE jump in Q2 bookings & backlog. I'd like to know what the seller is buying that looks cheaper than this!"
There was also a $0.05 charge for the recent refinancing - so adjusted earnings were $0.51.
"Bel Fuse is very cheap. Good fundamentals, New CFO. Stock should be a solid trade to $20 which it every year for the last 20 years."
"This is clearly one of the most undervalued stock in the market right now. They present a historic 2Q and have a record backlog for Q3, the CFO has bought some shares. P/E y very low, P/FCF very low. I dont undestand how someon can sell Belf stocks. Buy cheap. Good investment!"
This worth 20 usd. I will keep on buying!!
Excellent results. Bright future with the accelerating orders. They do need to increase prices faster.
Break out level on the charts is at $15.50 - should happen relatively quickly.
"Tesla is one of BelfB customer, with the expasion of TESLA, Belfus is in an excelent position."
Is the EV business outside of Tesla kicking in as well? Lucid?
Bel Fuse is up 10.53% to 14.70
Awesome time to buy.The dip b4 the rip.Earnings tomorrow am!
"Great buy, good fundamentals, great report and technicals. Weekly MACD about to cross and every time it did that, the stock jumped or starting a new bull run. If algos see that, it will be huge!"
Bel Fuse Inc. has Tesla as a customer do they not??? Why on earth would a small profitable company like this not put out a PR announcing this???
