"This is clearly one of the most undervalued stock in the market right now. They present a historic 2Q and have a record backlog for Q3, the CFO has bought some shares. P/E y very low, P/FCF very low. I dont undestand how someon can sell Belf stocks. Buy cheap. Good investment!"

"Hmm...$21.95If I may, take a look at my post back on February 19th under the my prior board name ""bran_in_my_jelloLooks like I hit it close to right---------------------------------------------------------------------bran_in_my_jello • Feb 19, 2016 4:21 PM Remove 0users liked this postsusers disliked this posts1ReplyWell there you go... Did you take the opportunity at $13.50?Lets look at my prior posts..January 13 -- ""I'd say at $14 or anything lower, say 13.75, you stand a fair chance of being over $18 within 3 years, a annualized return of 10%. Might not get to $13.75 but you have to be ready to pull the trigger at some specific point. $14.50, or $13.75, or even $12.50.Have your entry point well defined. I don't think $11.50 is in the cards.""As I said before, I last sold at $38.70 after management fended off a $42 offer. Good move my part.Now, while I'm not too keen on management, today and on a few previous days there have been good entry points.Today, you had the opportunity to get in at $13.50... some even below that.That price, $13.50, was good enough for me. Might go down a buck or two , but as you know, you never catch the bottom.I'm back in and am willing to wait 2 to 5 years for a solid return.We'll see how it goes.-----------------------------------------------------------------------"

"Is anyone lurking in his message board? The last time a bought and sold this stock was in the summer of 2007.I'm not sure why I didn't check it every so often to see if here was another opportunity for an entry point since then.Perhaps it's because the volume is so low that it is difficult to buy and sell an order in a day, and because there is usually a HUGE Gap between the Bid and Ask prices.This is one of two stocks I have bought and sold several times for over 20 years, and is the ONLY stock I have always made a profit on."

"Back to the $12's. Wow didn't think I'd be able to buy BELFB this low after the terrific Q2 report. Stock is pretty much back to where it was trading before the funky index removal dip, and the Q2 results. Even though Q2 showed a dramatic sequential improvement in earnings over Q1 (the Q1 earnings were all from a 1-time gain) and a HUGE jump in Q2 bookings & backlog. I'd like to know what the seller is buying that looks cheaper than this!"

"Where were all you BELFB promoters at the bottom? A year or more ago, you were all touting BELFB when it was 20 and 22, then you disappeared when it dipped under 15.Look at my post below from 3 months ago, wherein I reprinted my Feb 19th post.That very day I jumped back in at $13.50 and alerted all of you, including the prior proponents, of the opportunity to act rather than wait and wait..Now, only 9 months later, the stock has doubled to over $27.00How come the stock was so good at $20 but you wouldn't touch it below $15?Where are you... why did you not buy in at 13.5 the same stock you were promoting at over $20.I'd be willing to take my double now, but will probably wait another 3 months for tax purposes."

"How has this EV play not been discovered by Wall Street yet?? Terrific opportunity here imo. BELFB is super cheap based on their fundamentals. Big earnings turnaround the past 2 quarters, higher margins & lower expenses, tons of cash on the balance sheet...stock should be in the $20's. Then check out the Needham investor presentation last month. They said Tesla is a customer! The guy even says BELFB fuses go into every vehicle Tesla makes (hello!!). They also talk about how a lot of their EV customers are in a prototype stage right now, and will be ramping up to a production stage in the coming year or 2. Exciting stuff! With everything EV on fire lately, and so many absurd valuations in the sector (companies with no revenues having market caps in the billions)...BELFB sure looks like a steal around $16."

Wow why the big pop today?? Earnings on Monday. Think it'll be a decent report and they've got an easy comp. But the commentary is likely to be cautious given all the component shortages.

I had to add this.morning. Very close to a 20 year low and back where it was at the bottom in 08/09. The market sure hates it but this has to be a rare buying opportunity. That's my story and I'm sticking with it.

"Held since Feb 19, 2016--- Sold today at 27.47 ave. price. LT cap gainA few of you have followed my posts over the past years.You can see more of the discussion 7 threads below this one under microcapguru's post.As you will read, I have followed this stock for over 15 years and was out for many years, only to see a rare opportunity to jump in on Feb 19th of 2016 at $13.50I would have sold weeks ago, at easily over 30 but was hanging on to get the sale as a long term capital gain.However my first possible sale day was Tuesday of this week. Unfortunately the stock has taken serious drop of over 10%.These past couple days I was hoping for a bounce back, but have decided to take a wonderful gain instead of facing a potential loss of my great gain...drop by drop.So, to recap.. I purchased Feb. 19, 2016, at $13.50.... was given a wonderful ride up, and have now exited at a average price of $27.47, for a 103% long term capital gain.If only the price could have held for 1 extra week, but I have to be happy with the investment.I can't wait and watch it possibly drop any further... though I really have no idea what will happen in the next few weeks.It could go back up over 30, but it may well drop under 25. I will keep you apprised of my next re-entry into the stock, as I will continue to follow it. I would note however that my last waiting period to re-enter was over 10 years.By the way, in that below thread by Microcapguru, I also mentioned that I thought Sears SHLD was destined to drop lower and lower, nearly guaranteed. At the time of that post, it was $12.12. Today it is $7.74 (-36%)... and I am convinced it will drop much lower over the next 12 to 24 months. The company is doomed and there will be no savior in the form of a buyout. Keep a eye on it."

"For those who have followed my previous posts over the past many years I have now made another move.I have re-entered a BELFB position at a average price of $11.12 thus far this morning.Will evaluate further buying if significant downward movement takes place,.My previous exit was on Feb. 19, 2016 at average price $27.47 as indicated in below posts.My goal is to own this position for a 5 years gain averaging more than 10% annual.However I may find a earlier exit as was the case last time when I entered at $13.50 before exiting at $27.47.I have followed this stock for 19 years and tend to see patterns such as this repeat."

"A truly strange price..As a former long in BELFB shares, I confess to being utterly mystified by the current price. I will offer two comments of varying length, but as always, you have to make up your own mind. Investing is hard.1) Two years ago, the company radically altered its profile and balance sheet by taking on a large amount of debt to make two substantial acquisitions. I supported these in hopes that the larger footprint and economies of scale would be dramatically accretive to the earnings power of the company. As we know,the businesses they bought rapidly deteriorated to the point that about half of the value was written off after 18 months. Of course, the debt still remains.And yet, the market is claiming that the firm is worth about 25% MORE than before the deals. This makes no sense to me on any level.2) Because of the eventual intangible asset writedown, the company was required by its auditors to go through a very detailed valuation exercise in order to determine the amount of the writedown. If you look in the 10-Q filed with the SEC, the footnotes contain a great deal of information about the parameters used during this exercise. Applying this information to the company's actual results, I keep coming up with a value per share of about $15-17. I suppose I could be wrong, but I doubt by 100%.There has been a huge amount of money flowing into microcap index funds, and I suppose that could continue to buoy the shares. I just prefer to focus on fundamentals and I have great disdain for momentum and trend following strategies.I am not a short seller, just a confused little investor."
