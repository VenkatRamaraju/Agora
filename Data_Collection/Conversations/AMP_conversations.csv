"Amp is a well run company. Smart management team. Their clients are loyal. The advisors are the best in the industry and do not leave the company to other firms and many advisors from outside firms are coming to amp for two reason. The franchise owners have a lot of power to keep the company from doing anything to run the advisors off like the other firms have ie Merrill lynch, ubs, Morgan Stanley. Stock price is conservative based on fundamentals and continued growth. The second reason is the company invested in the best tools for their advisors to help their clients. It is all about doing the right thing for the client."

$AMP is  one token to rule them all..AMP will have Its day just like ethereum & bitcoin did.
"I decided to actually research this ($AMP) and Crypto in general.. i justify large coin purchases mainly targeting any coins that are below $0.10. It seems to me that Crypto' acts almost like a ""Barometer"" with a constant measuring of societal sentiment and market mood.. It seems like the lesser known coins are brought to the forefront when we the people need a coin like $AMP..But what kind of coin, token is $AMP? I don't know how to answer that.. Even with all the research prior to buying, I still think about all the other coins i should've bought before i even confirm my current transaction..The ""Sky is the Limit"" for $AMP and so many more utility rooted type coins.. Coins that can contribute to better ""Crypto"" exposure for the ""not so engaged"" market space..My description of the nature of this coin may be out of the lane a bit, but that is the intrinsic beauty of the ""Crpto Universe"" as i see it.. And i'm inclined to believe there are just as many interpretations of Crypto as there are coins in this new way of storing and utilizing digital currency. Things are going to be so different in the not so distant future, and Crypto' is serving as a conduit to get people to understand how necessary it is to overhaul the current ""Lopsided"" financial infrastructure is now.When a 17 year old can become a Millionaire without ever leaving his or her bedroom..Taking a $20 a week allowance and turning it into a fortune seems to have blown the secrete of wealth out of the game."
"Nice 10% drop since Friday. Nothing like losing. Oops, the yield curve inverted. Like the market will rally 800 points if the curve makes the minor correction to reverse the trend?? Right - fundamentals."
