"@oliver Letters, videos and empty words. How about some results. WOW SORRY no results. BIOTECHNOLOGY IS HARD . We have to wait few years. Perhaps 2025 or so"
@Austin. You're Dirtkacz newest pumper face. How do you recover all the money investors lost because of Dirtkacz. Any ideas?
"This is actually becoming a bit comical. I will give this until the end of December and if it can't begin to run by then, so be it. This will never recover."
"Durkacz got new faces in pumping; Bobby, Neil, Sam, etc. Cheap money for you Durkacz."
"There is a pattern in FSD management development “strategy” or better a scheming scheme. Interim CEO buy a company without a professional preliminary study. Then he wakes up or see around negative opinion or no results about his “achievement” then buy the next one to patch his previous sloppy job. And probably there is next one to come. This way FSD is bleeding shareholders money because this nonsense practice shows that there is no plan to move forward. This is why even if management has access to cash they choose to continually dilute shareholders. If management were confident in past and present acquisitions and their ability to execute then there's no need to continually do so, spending for a proper planning. FSD balance sheet, is needed because it has been used to lure in retail investors over the years."
"Interesting excerpts from SA article ::The LUCID 21-302 molecule for multiple sclerosis (MS) was developed over many years, by doctors, scientists and researchers at the University Health Network (“UHN”). UHN is the largest health research organization in North America. Lucid has exclusively licensed LUCID21-302 from the UHN which recently received patents for it. LUCID 21-302 represents an entirely new approach to MS.The global multiple sclerosis therapies market was estimated to be worth 23 billion dollars a year in 2018 and projected to increase to 28 billion by 2026. A brand new approach to MS could quickly grow in a market this big."
@Neil. Oi Durkacz the hustler. Prove yourself. For 4 years you fail consistently and continously.
"Anyone going to be transparent by sharing the details of the Covar/FSD agreement, potential cost to shareholders, or just continue to blindly pump the agreement without providing the full details as usual. FSD has had a horrible track record with more than several agreements in place over the years."
I couldn’t have said it better myself!
"Simply...who wanted to buy the discounted options offered with the $ new emission $1,8 has already bought. So there is a place for small price rise...And to all complaining colleagues ... the newly obtained money are ""for a reason"".. and the newly nominated Chief Executive Officer is ""for a reason""... we can expect something reasonably huuuuuge... and rather soon...Real investing is not a Las Vegas Cassino.."
How about another 201/1 split jail time
"Hi Dirtkacz, THE KING PUMPER. New Pumper faces on the deck; Juliette (15 post), Ted (1 post), Cristina (1 post). Shame on you Dirtkacz. You're a good for nothing."
When's bankruptcy? My 98% loss looks good but not 100% good. Biggest scam in the market.
This company is nothing more than a banker gambling at the expense of it's shareholders imo.
@ Business Financial. Wow this is a new pumping tag. You're problem here pumper is you are 32 minutes old with 7 posts all over the place. Same old same old habit Durkacz.
Here goes the sinking ship again... Down she goes..... 
"Negative comments come from shorters and from those that lost a lot money. And yet FSD is still the game, just look at what happened today! Maybe a sign of whats to come."
@ Austin = AD Your close circle knows very well AD you're a gambler. No problems with that but here you gamble shareholders money. For you this doesn't make any difference.
Hexo CEO left 7 days ago...amid strategic reorganization.
"Shareholders simply want true value derived from hard work and results, enough promotion of what is intend to be done, do it. How can you expect to get anything accomplished when continually starting something then halfway through pulling the plug to chase the next great thing?"
Why the 10% jump today? Another big acquisition news?
Get to know your CEO. https://youtu.be/QGcw50YomPY
"Dear pumpers and especially the Master Pumper Mr. A. Durkacz. What did you announce? A bright future for FSD and shareholders after your deal with Lucid? What kind of structure has Lucid today? Johny, your pumping face announced that Lucid is hiring: Join us | Neurosciences | Neurobehavioral sciences | Lucid Psycheceuticals Inc. | TorontoIf they hire all the below positions Means they did not have too much. Once again Durkacz you cannot achieve a project. Don’t be sad you never achieved anything. • Process Chemist (ideally experience in process chemistry, GLP/GMP) – 1 position • Scientist/Senior Scientist (neurodegenerative disorders, preferred background in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease, preclinical/clinical) – 1 position • Scientist/Senior Scientist (Mental health, preferred background in major clinical depression and anxiety, preclinical/clinical) – 1 position • Business Development/Marketing (experience in neurosciences space, synergistic partnerships, product planning, market analytics, licensing, deal flow) – 1 position • Intellectual Property Manager (background in drug substances and drug product patents, neurosciences and pharmaceutical chemistry) • Clinical Director (background in neurosciences, product development, experience in managing multi-site clinical trials in multiple jurisdictions)"
"@ Shaq. What is so exciting Pumper? Dirtkacz working at the office and figuring out Lucid, his latest ""acquisition"" cannot complete anything because they don't have the team (a while back you scrim hopefully they hire) and today they ask somebody else to do trials? This is the turnaround and spinning wheels development from Durkacz. Nothing good for shareholders return here. lol "

"I keep reading that investing in FSD is just a waste of money, same management, same money taking scheme. FSD already knows that if they do the same thing they did in the past they are not going anywhere, so what would be the point? I don't know if FSD will recover , no one does, but I do see promise in psychedelics, maybe this will be the golden egg they have been waiting for."
"There are a lot of new companies making treatments with psyquedelics, but I undestand the molecule of Lucid, has a better quality and future on market, and now they are with FSD. I'll do more research."
"Let's face it, there's a lot we DON'T KNOW about what is in the works with this company.What we do know is that if we get even a shred of hope that whatever they do will go forward without a huge delay, the stock will rocket into the stratosphere. What happens between now and then really doesn't mean too much in the grand scheme of things. It could go either way at this point. They spend a lot and continuously. The history of this stock wasn’t always clear."
"Apparently, HUGE is doing fain and A Durkacz need more money for next .....NOBODY KNOWS WHAT but following his record it will be something that cannot be achieved within 6 months, no sir because 6 months doesn't reach his personal goals. Shareholders return? Doesn't exist on Durkacz agenda. No just to line up his pockets as long as possible. The problem with PUMP is there is no plan and never results. Nonsense projects stopped and repeated. THEY NEED TO draw in new investors, bleed them dry and move on, while management and promoters are compensated. This company is nothing more than a banker gambling at the expense of its shareholders."
"The Devil is in the details:Could AD have possibly chosen Lucid in part due to his self interest already being a shareholder and warrant holder of Lucid? Lucid Transaction Details: The Transaction will be effected by way of a three-cornered amalgamation between Lucid, FSD Pharma and a wholly-owned subsidiary of FSD Pharma. The Transaction will involve the issuance of approximately 4.5 million Class B subordinate voting shares in the capital of FSD Pharma (each, an ""FSD Share"") as the acquisition consideration (the ""Consideration Shares""), with a deemed aggregate purchase price of approximately US$9 million (CAD$11.3 million based on an exchange rate of US$1 to CAD$1.255) at a deemed price of US$2.00 (CAD$2.51) per FSD Share. The Consideration Shares may be adjusted slightly in the event the market price of the FSD Shares changes significantly prior to closing of the Transaction. Additionally, all of the outstanding Lucid stock options and warrants will become exercisable into FSD Shares, with the number and exercise price of such securities to be adjusted in accordance with the Transactions exchange ratio. The closing of the Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions for a transaction of this nature including, among other things, Lucid obtaining the requisite shareholder approval at a special meeting of Lucid shareholders to be called to consider the Transaction (the ""Lucid Meeting""). The closing of the Transaction is expected to occur in September 2021. The Transaction will require approval by 66 2/3% of the votes cast by Lucid shareholders at the Lucid Meeting. Lucid shareholders holding at least 66 2/3% of the shares of Lucid, have entered into support agreements with FSD Pharma (the ""Support Agreements"") pursuant to which, among other things, they have agreed to vote all of the shares held by them in favor of the Transaction at the Lucid Meeting, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Support Agreements. Additionally, it is a condition to closing of the Transaction that Lucid shareholders holding approximately 44% of the shares of Lucid, shall have entered into lock-up agreements with FSD Pharma pursuant to which: (a) 20% of the Consideration Shares received by each such locked-up shareholder will be exempt from any contractual transfer restrictions imposed by FSD Pharma; and (b) 80% of the Consideration Shares received by each such locked-up shareholder will be subject to contractual transfer restrictions, with such Consideration Shares to be released from such transfer restrictions over an 18 month period from the date of closing the Transaction. Completion of the Transaction is subject to various closing conditions, including: the approval of the Nasdaq and CSE, the approval of the boards of directors of FSD Pharma and Lucid, the approval of the security holders of Lucid, and completion of due diligence by the parties. Anthony Durkacz, a director and control person of the Company, is also a shareholder and warrant holder of Lucid, through a company he beneficially owns, and consequently the Transaction constitutes a ""related party transaction"" within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (""MI 61-101""). In its consideration and approval of the Transaction, the board of directors of the Company, with Mr. Durkacz recusing himself, determined that the Transaction will be exempt from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements of MI 61-101 on the basis of the exemptions in Sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101."
@oliver oi pumper. With Dirtkacz around FSD has...
"Perhaps those who have been involved since the IPO or even pre IPO and would like to see the seemingly endless cycle and destruction of retail shareholder value under ANY form of management cease in all companies under the direct supervision and involvement of one Mr. Durkacz. ""New"" chance? No, same OLD chance looking for NEW $$$$$ and yet another chance. Recent filings show Anthony and crew have rewarded themselves yet again, and for what exactly? Every time they have rewarded themselves when the price slips they always seem to award themselves more. Retail shareholders don't have that luxury as they are required to invest more of their own capital in order to cost average down whereas management - AD & Co. continually grants and awards themselves more FREEBIES."
This will never recover
It's a no-brainer as to why FSD Pharma currently trades @ net asset value.
"Interesting, see what pops up when you Google: Goyal vs FSD Pharma."
"Equity guru: Is FSD Pharma getting into psychedelics to avoid being delisted from the nasdaq?The company filed an Investigational IND with the FDA in August 2020 and was given the green light just a month later to initiate a phase 2 clinical trial for the use of FSD201 to treat COVID-19. But last month announced they were terminating the study. Another L for FSD Pharma. Can we please change this company’s name to SMDH Pharma. They were cannabis, then they were Covid, now they are psychedelics. They can’t seem to make up their mind, it all feels pretty random and fly by night. They also seem to burn their bridges after each phase instead of integrating a series of different verticals under one rooftop kind of like Revive (RVV.C) did. It’s been a bizarre strategy and the company’s share price has been nothing more than a flatline with the occasional blip for years now. Whatever trend comes after psychedelics I wouldn’t surprised to see another pivot, CEO, rollback, etc."
"On this forum people can be trolls, bashers, shorter, looser, etc. if they are critical and ask return on investment after 4 years. Callers ask for a fourth or fifth chance to AD to do what? there is no strategy to get some money back in short, medium term. Just hope and need of more money to finalize some poetical projects. Why is that? there is no strategy at all."
"@ Jesse There is the same management as it was in 2017. Durkacz replaced Thomas, Sara and Raza. Now Durkacz the king of hustling got finally CEO and use shareholders money irresponsibly."
"I was on this stock a few years ago and I can tell you that in my opinion, this isn’t a real company but rather it’s a mechanism for the principals to extract as much money as possible from shareholders. There is no real strategy to return on investment. I see people here asking for money and Daniel your advice to loose before you win is redundant here, People including myself lost money here. What is FSD fighting? His CEO or what?"
With access to cash why would management choose to continually diute shareholders? If management were confident in past and present aquasitions and their ability to execute then there's no need to continually do so. Balance sheet has been used to lure in retail investors over the years imo.
"AD the paper boy, always promoting and pushing that paper based on ""plans"" or ""intentions"" instead of RESULTS."
"@Austin You 7 posts charmer. Every single person here knows how it works. no need to be lectured by a pumper or better YOU TO APOLIGISE FOR DURKACZ CONTINOUS FAILURE> But to keep continuously Anthony Durkacz who made just errors at all levels, around, it is more than accepting risks when investing. You fool me once it's your fault, you foul me twice it's my fault, You foul me three times...FGY you the face and Durkacz"
@V you're around for 10 months and FSD did not make any progress for more than 3 tears. Dirtkacz you're a hustler and lying for you becomes a habit.
"@NN Why keep coming back to check on FSD if you think it's going to fail? Let us who actually care about this stock and actually want to see it grow leave the comments. FSD knows what went wrong in the past, you actually think they will make the same mistakes again? I think not, thats why Im hopeful."
"The rise is due to the heavy promotion campaign they are currently undertaking. It will take impeccable management and real results due to their execution in order to attain true value, this rise is once again due to promotion not results. This companies track record for promotional activity is high, results and execution not so much A+ for promotion F on results and execution to date."
Markets turning to green and this toilet cant stop taking a ???????????????????????????
"The future of the company looks incredible and best of all, the shares are less than $ 1.5 is a good time to invest with a low risk. FSD Pharma"
@William. There are many companies developing psychedelics. Professionals. With FSD today's management YOUR EGG IS ROTTEN.
"Another red day in psychedelics. All my holdings $MMED, $CYBN, $HUGE, $CMPS and $FTRP are in the red today.  I believe in the medicine. HODL."
I can smell another psychedelic acquisition coming by FSD Pharma. Wonder which company they will acquire next!
Later today on Sunday (15:00 east time) usually will start DURKACZ PUMPING PROGRAM to be ready for Monday morning TO FACE EVENTUAL NEW INVESTORS.
A.D.
"Sooner than later Durkacz, is coming your time to pay for your scam and Ponzi scheme. Pay back's a beatch...https://ca.yahoo.com/news/netflix-hbo-scammer-arrested-feds-163731934.html"
Ok who tossed out the anchor  cause it's going down again...
Durkacz is desperate. His Ponzi scheme works just with continuous pumping and deceiving. It is obvious these pumpers/Clones are doing the job and keep real investors away. They pump too hard and push too hard to promote THE NOTHING DURKACZ CREATED.
Great company! HUGE is really undervalued. It will hit 10 $ by year end at least
Huge joke if the year
Any bet with FSD pharma is one that requieres a lot of patience. Im holding my 1000 (bought at $1.37)stocks until the end of next year. So far I haven't lost which is a good sign. FSD is holding in there and their new strategy with psychedelics.
Does anyone know what's happening with this stock? Lost my 20 K here and with PUMP. no hope.
This is a real dump. It is obvious an extra pumping effort.
Been holding onto $HUGE for a few years now. I think we will finally reap the benefits of our patience with FSD. Not worried as long as they continue to chug away and make progress.
never gain trust no more
"Isn't it strange that all of these pumpers suddenly show up right while the company is undertaking yet another promotional campaign? They spoon feed the information they want potential investors to have and tell them to ignore anyone who shines light on any of their questionable practices. Short interest is 3% of float, share price is a reflection of the management and it's inability to execute over the years blaming shorts is laughable here."
Psychedelics market for mental Illness: CAGR of 16.3% during 2020–27 and expected to reach US$6.9 Billion by 2027 from $2.0 Billion in 2019. FSD Pharma is definitely going in the right direction
"Seeking Alpha Article on Lucid / FSD ::""The LUCID 21-302 molecule for multiple sclerosis (MS) was developed over many years, by doctors, scientists and researchers at the University Health Network (“UHN”). UHN is the largest health research organization in North America. Lucid has exclusively licensed LUCID21-302 from the UHN which recently received patents for it. LUCID 21-302 represents an entirely new approach to MS.Current medical thinking sees MS as an autoimmune disorder and the drugs used to treat or lessen the effects of MS all begin with the immune system. Lucid and the researchers at the UHN looked at MS from the perspective its being an issue of neurodegeneration. This new approach looks to reverse and prevent neurodegeneration without interacting with the immune system. Lucid hopes that LUCID 21-302 will be very complementary to existing MS therapies, helping people regain the muscle function they have lost."""
I see around here a lot of pumping break-down. People/pumper Clones get offensive. AD new drug can help first here ... Lol
AD pumping the balance sheet fishing for new investors yet again with more promotional videos and articles.
"Perhaps those who have been involved since the IPO or even pre IPO and would like to see the seemingly endless cycle and destruction of retail shareholder value under ANY form of a management cease in all companies under the direct supervision and involvement of one Mr Durkacz.

"@ David Rosenburg. You look like a fair pumper not like a Dirkacz face ex. V, Nicky, Juliette, Simon, Oliver, Oleg, etc. Please rephrase your precious 3 hours ago statement: WE ARE GO FOR THE 4TH LAUNCH after 3 PREVIOUS FAILURES. All failures were expensed to the class B shareholders."
If you take into account the share price before that criminal reverse split this isn’t even worth one cent.
"This is an example of just one of the many paid promotions currently underway. BFN (Business Financial Network) is greasy. They claim to be ""Gem hunters"" I kid you not, when in reality they don't hunt anything they simply promote or pump companies that pay them too.https://youtu.be/oTheCLruu9k"
"The problem with PUMP is there is no plan and have never been results. Nonsense projects stopped and repeat. Draw in new investors, bleed them dry and move on, while management and promoters are compensated. This company is nothing more than a banker gambling at the expense of its shareholders."
"@ Daniel. Excellent idea Mr. Daniel Sir, Let's get real here... You're an F PUMPER FACE. Sorry Sir, DIrkacz the pumping king face. Durkacz did bring HUGE, PUMP, and PWWR to hit the rock bottom. The new money will not help. It is too insignificant; Durkacz got fat and needs more and more and more shareholders' money because he is hungry. But the most important there is a point in the near future than people will ask him for money. the shareholder's money he simply volatilized since the beginning."
@Juliette. With same management for four years there is no hope FSD will ever recover. AD and FRC will make sure money will be drained consistently
"@ pratik Dear Sir you assume ""interim"" CEO"" is forever for AD? If yes means AD seek just to be CEO no matter what."
"@Simon Dear Sir, you're a veeery pumped pumper. lol"
@V. V what's going on Dirtkacz? This is negative pumping. What's wrong? Did you have some of those psychedelic medicine or probably just the usual daily stuff.
"On this forum, it is a MUST to mention all efforts made by the management to underline some positive if they do whatever dream on. Nothing positive in CONTINOUS PUMPING. A new pumping face after another Austin, Jane, Sam. You call people names or whatever you desire if there is one single opinion against the interim CEO AD. This company is nothing more than a banker gambling at the expense of its shareholders. Pumpers on multiple chat boards. HERE New FAKE FACE for AD; JESS, DON, BOBBY AXELROD, OLEG, ARYA START, MATT, V, ROBIN, OLIVER. Last week each post comes up with 9 to ten thumbs up in two minutes' time. This week they changed the strategy, less instant thumbs up. Nice work to you AD. Nothing more to say, you embarrass yourself again."
"AD the dilution pumper king at it yet again with another round of paid promotion and another acquisition at the expense of shareholders via more dilution all while trying to spin facts and portray himself as some sort of savior. With a balance sheet showing plenty of cash on hand, why would they choose to dilute shareholders yet again?"
Haven't been here since March (mid $2 range). I got a lot of hate for telling people to cut their losses on this scam. Seems like there are A LOT of paid pumpers on here trying to mislead people that this fail of a company (if we can even call it that) will turn things around and make them some money. DO NOT BUY THIS unless you are looking to minimize your taxes through a tax loss. LOL
"Another interview by Anthony. Just interviews to settle his image and his reign. Nothing positive whatsoever for class B shareholders. Anthony ran the grow op into the ground, nothing more than a heavily promoted pump and dump that ultimately failed to hold any value after hype died and the failure to execute by Anthony and crew. Anthony got CEO after they appointed inept management just as he did with all his start-ups. Now he is about to get another cash up round and bums money from retail and other potential shareholders."
"Spending almost 2million a year on promotion, pumpers on multiple chat boards, YouTube pod cast interviews, and other promotional outlets. Why not allocate that money to further clinical trials, R&D and other such activities that work to bring true shareholder value. Instead of spending that money on pumping what you intend to do, how about working hard execute and then promote what you have accomplished instead of continually wasting time and money looking for handouts from retail."
"??? How do we pay for expansion of new endeavor of the new CEO?. He expects another 70 mil,to be completed in 20-36 Mos. Guess we wait for a long while"
"Psychedelics development requires money in excess of 100 mil, strong management and a skilled team in order to get results fast. Durkacz burned 40 mil. with WCE without having any working prototype for cannabis or hemp oil extraction. They ended today doing delivery after acquiring another company. With FSD this is the fourth attempt to do.....""R&D"". Durkacz lost credibility in front of shareholders. For how long is this interim CEO ?!?!?"
"It is time to consider FSD in the investment portfolio, the shares are below $ 1.5 USD low risk investment and with a promising future."
"Sprinkling sugar on #$%$ doesn't make it chocolate. Anyone remotely involved in this market is already well aware of this train wreck and the underhanded tactics employed by management through promotion and other means. Don't quit your day job, on second thought please do. lost money will neve come back. gfy"
"Problem is there have never been results. Rinse and repeat. Draw in new investors, bleed them dry and move on, while management and promoters are compensated."
"I love the slow and steady climb for FSD! A hidden gem that is, nice cash flow for Mr. Durkacz, Mr. Saeed, and Mr. Bockhari. Very comfortably adding to my position, B shareholder, on every red day. I think $0.9, not more by year-end is a realistic outlook here. By next year the funds of 40 mils will be more than half gone. Top management will have a nice life for the next two to three years, is not life wonderful?"
@V Hey Durkacz pumper face! Dirtkacz is the best spending shareholders money uselessly. For four years since he got lucky with cannabis shareholders money he simply sink everything. Same case here so far and with his last R&D project there is no hope for future. Real investors get to something that make sense.
On this forum Anthony Durkacz pumping faces/clones work tirelessly not to promote HUGE but to scuze AD the hustler for the mistakes over mistakes he did before with all his startups. They ask for PATIENCE and UNDERSTANDING from people who lost money here. WHAT FOR? To get back on track the stock? NO SIR! TO CONTINUE WITH AD because AD NEEDS ANOTHER CHANCE. During last four years AD bad decisions and his own interest cost class B shareholders tens of millions just with FSD and PUMP. DESERVES AD ANOTHER CHANCE AND ANOTHER TRUST PAID WITH NEW MONEY? If you trust him pay him. It's up to you people.
"One billion shares.No matter what FSD Pharma (HUGE.N) does, I will always remember them as the company that bragged endlessly about having more than a billion shares outstanding. That was their whole philosophy, they went so far as to go with HUGE as their ticker. They also completed the biggest reverse split I have ever seen. With news that FSD Pharma, a Nasdaq listed company is getting involved in psychedelics I thought there might be at least some excitement, maybe some investors who weren’t around in the cannabis days. The general consensus from what I have seen is to stay away at all costs unless something fundamentally shifts, there are other more qualified and better run companies out there. FSD Pharma has been a gong show since its inception."
"Nice to see Walter here. But, wrong stock kiddo. This is far out your control or area of expertise. Stick to ruining the $HUGE board lolWhen TRIP IPO’d Walter got on all of his accounts and littered the $TRIP board for about 4-5 days steady until his comments just sort of drifted with the wind LOL"
"@Sam. You PUMPER cannot tell anyone when, how or what to post here. You Durkacz are arrogant. You should know that being a leader (as you pretend) isn't about who's willing to take it the furthest or chosen the right path, it's about how far is too far and choosing to stop."
"@ Oliver Durkacz Simply...who wanted to buy the ""discounted"" offered today with the $R&D new acquisition of yours. So there is a place for a management change to have a PUMP rise...And to all pumpers & clone colleagues ... the money you obtained three years ago is ""for a reason"".. and the newly nominated CEO is ""for a reason""... we can expect something reasonably huuuuuge cash out for AD&FRCC... and rather soon...Real investing is a Las Vegas Casino instead FSD."

"@William & Court . Players/pumper ask for a chance. How many times Dirtkacz had a chance so far? Three times already. This is the fourth time. You fouled me once is my fault, you fouled me twice is your fault, you fouled me three times. . ., you got the habit and it is in your gut. You're made this way DIRTKACZ THE HUSTLER. FSD CEO's shoes are too bog for an accountant. Let professionals do the job and step out ! Otherwise you prove again how arrogance destroy a corporation and everything you touch."
@William. Let's examine your new PUMPING FACE DURKACZ. 9 POSTS and crazy pumper night. AD you've got all needed money to do something good within last 4 years and yet you're coming here to ask more time and money.
"Let's examine the last few strides FSD has made to make a comeback: Collaboration with the University Health Network, Acquisition of LUCID, and now COVAR agreement. Seems to me like FSD is laying the ground work for future success. I know we need some legitimate results, but they could be coming in the next few months."
@Paulo Thanks for your concern. Why do you care about my life? I am doing great pumper. I see all Dirtkacz faces struggling and being concerned. AD why do you want so much to control Huge? It's the money isn't it? Or your arrogance? I believe both.
Huge is controlled today by sick people The stock is continuously under 2 $ for 2 years in row. BEST PONZI SCHEME ON THE MARKET.
"@ Curt 7 posts you have WHAT ARE YOU? A pumper I presume ( 7 posts). Whomever wrote here SIR, you're a pumper and YOU OVERSIGHT THE MAIN FACT . IN BIONTECH DEVELOPMENT YOU NEED professional top management to show shareholders care. AD it is not. AD is simply a HUSTLER. DO NOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH BYOTHECH DEVELOPMENT. HUSTLER Aims the money"
"I feel that with all that their technology is capable of ""doing"", not much because they have to patch up the team very often, more no capabilities are yet to be discovered. With increasing payment to research, labs, cancer facilities, and others, the possibility that one or more may make a discovery to be of use will blow this stock wide open. They spent a lot of money and plan the future on the money they don't have. 40 mil is not enough. Other biotech spent next to 0.5 to 1 billion in research to get to some results"
@William. You're the third new PUMPER with only one post here who announce last Durkacz R&D project that cost 9 mil. Same question to you When we can expect return on investment?
@Austin. You're the newest pumper.
@Daniel. Hi the new one. Told the other Dyrkacz faces; as long as he is around I am around. Can you explain how you plan to take care of class B shareholders? Also tell me where can I go to recover the money I lost because AD deceived me?
@ William and Daniel. You right you Dirtkacz faces. AD shows a lot of determination in spending without any preliminary feasability study. He doesn't know what this kind of analysis means. He wants the money no matter what.
@ Barren Wuffett. New Dirtkacz face but built in two days and 15 posts. Dirtkacz the CHIEF PUMPER this is what you learned from last 2 mil investment? You don't care. Not your money. Sorry shareholders money.
@ William and Don. Dirtkacz always reset the past and give himself chances. This is always on shareholder expense. Dirtkacz you're embarrassing yourself continously. Lol
"@ Shaq, Jane new vintage pumpers and J dusted pumper. This is payback for last 2 mil lost money by Durjacz Hey hustler you want to move pumping at next level. Good luck with that."
"The $45 mil is used to lure investors in, they've had it on the balance sheet for years. Then once in they continue to hold the cash and dilute shareholders and expect them to be greatful for it as if they are doing shareholders a favor. This company leverages it's risk at the expense of it's shareholders imo."
Wow another year down the tubes this will never recober
@William 1o posts but you pump wisely.
"Lots of talk on FSD everyday.Seems like Lucid don’t work as expected by AD, (nothing new) the working relationship and planned marketing is likely all scrapped. Lucid doesn’t have the works.This is all unravelling like a scam."
ive shorted a lot of pennies off this stock over the years I come back here for memes
AD the dilution pumper king at it yet again with another round of paid promotion and another acquisition at the expense of shareholders via more dilution all while trying to spin facts and portray himself as some sort of savior. With a balance sheet showing plenty of cash on hand why would they choose to dilute shareholders yet again?https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210922006009/en/FSD-Pharma-Announces-Engagement-with-Capital-Markets-Communications-Providers-and-Market-Maker
great company lololol
"Dr. Kotra on Lucid's acquisition, “Energized by the tremendous opportunity that the combination of the two companies represents, I am thrilled to join the FSD Pharma team at this pivotal time as it works to accelerate the development of a robust pipeline of innovative treatments that address significant unmet needs in neurodegenerative and mental health disorders. Lucid recently licensed novel compounds from UHN for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, and is also developing a psychedelics-class of compounds for mental health disorders. These add to the current anti-inflammatory pipeline under development at FSD. As we move forward, we will be adding complementary expertise to the Company’s team, as well as partnering with experienced organizations globally. We are laser focused on completing advanced preclinical studies and scale-up activities to successfully move FSD Pharma’s assets through the clinical trials. This transformative transaction is a mutually synergistic step toward addressing total brain health, and the Company’s team is excited at the new possibilities and therapeutics.”"
$HUGE is by far one of the most undervalued psychedelic stocks in my opinion. Their LUCID-Psych molecule is far more superior than the $CMPS psilocybin molecule. Not to mention it is a proprietary molecule with IP around it. $CMPS is currently trading at $40. $HUGE is trading at $1.40. Both on NASDAQ.
@oliver. Dukacz you FINALLY got interim CEO FOREVER and you never did anything good for any of your startup companies. You just spent shareholders money with no result or return on investment.
