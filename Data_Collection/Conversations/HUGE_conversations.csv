@oliver. Oi DURKACZ. Shame on you HUSTLER. You started your clone pumping again today. Better go to work and do something good for B class shareholders. Your trademark is DECEIVING everyone around yu and youre shameless to deceive retail shereholders.
"Hi is anyone also here like me trusting every single thing FSD Pharma was doing? Yes maybe the CEO you talking are not good but hey there still hope in everything,"
GOING STRAIGHT OVER $3.70
All I can say was I'm just trusting FSD Pharma no matter what.
@ Robin Are the one who makes money PUMPING boyo?
"Anthony Durkacz, a director and control person of the Company, is also a shareholder and warrant holder of Lucid, through a company he beneficially owns. With the knowledge of Mr Durkacz performance history or lack thereof within the cannabis industry it will be interesting to see if shareholders of Lucid approve this transaction or if management have a strangle hold on voting as is such with HUGE/PUMP. Already put a black eye on the cannabis sector, now looking to kick the psychedelic sector in the teeth?"

@seth Thank you for your insightful message. The lemon you show is the image of WCE and FSD bank accounts that Dutkacz the hustler and FRCC drain the money for they personal use. Lol
"Hello PUMPERS: Nicky, V, oliver, Durkacz, Sam, Matt. How is life? pumping"
It’s the shorts that’s killing this stock. This should be above $2 by now considering the acquisition news.

FSD Pharma will give us a high hopes this coming month. I believe.
Look at that four year chart! “We lost him Doctor!”…………………….
"Changes take time , if raza was ceo there would likely be more payouts and nothing to show for"
Look at all the shortsellers complaining
@oliver if bathers are pumping negativity. You master pumper are pumping money strait to your own pockets and FRCC. Isn't it Durkacz?
"Durkacz is the schmuck who set this up. It's not the efficiency of the structure that's in question, it's the absence of clean and clear business practices. This company's business practices are diverted to the good of a few people; Durkacz, Saeed, Raza, and FRCC acolits."

Look at the dates of the last few news releases you can sorta estimate if things are going to pick up soon based on how they do promo etc. the number one thing a company needs are proper exposure and a clear way to explain the business model to potential investors retail investors along with institutional investors are what drive stock prices up. FSD today become a political stage for a few individuals that want just to keep control; Anthony Durkacz and Zeeshan Saeed. Raza Bockhari is still around. We cannot make money here.

@oliver. Oi Dirtkacz! This is how you call people that lost money with your P&D schemes? Basher shirtseller trolls. What are you? Because they way act seems to be irresponsible or you have a plan to drain everything within next three years. Any you beat your record. All you startups are down.
Hello Oliver ..
So where is Dr. Bokhari right now? That is the question you should all be asking?Dr Brennon is his buddy remember. What does he have to say about Dr. Bokhari being fired ?
"@ oliver. Not everyone is called PUMPER, Durkacz the hustler; just mama clone oliver and clones; nicky, V, Sam, Matt and for sure Durkacz the master pumper."

wonder if this’ll ever get back to my average price of $130. HA!
"@ oleg You get very upset and very fast tired you the youngest of Durkacz pumper with only 4 posts here. Durkacz transformed himself from ""concerned investor"" to ""concerned CEO"" and then ""interim CEO"". His goal is to be a ""permanent CEO"" in order to drain all remaining money in the FSD account. Nice recovery plan for Durkacz and FRCC."
I can't wait to see how this company will bloom in the future. No plans on selling my stock.
"FSD Pharma Inc. (Nasdaq: HUGE) (CSE:HUGE) Bokhari's stint as CEO was investigated by a special committee, which looked into ""a number of accusations."""
Durkacz has no MORAL COMPASS in anything he does.
Random Person without degree can do better than this bunch of crapes. Keep burning money without any outcome.
@Margaux Same old...same old
"The wings of change are coming average down now if you can , or sell if you don't like the company you have options , but stop complaining, and stop listening to the shortsellers spewing FAKE NEWS Anthony Durkacz and Zeeshan Saeed could have walked away from this nightmare but stayed to choose , you can stay or you can leave you can also choose. Golden and NN are short sellers they want to scare you into selling your shares that is how they make money. It's an ugly world out there. RAZA Destroyed the company same like he did with Ackers bioscience and rosetta genomics. If the stock ever does well again, you guys better praise the ones that helped instead of making up bs stories."
The Lucid acquisition is an attractive one that will allow advance development of novel compounds for the treatment of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases! Big Daddy Moves!
"I've been here since FSD was start but it didn't disappoint me. Well I trust every FSD thing was doing, So back off haters."
Let’s go guys I think the time is near because we already got the hints more acquisitions in the psychedelic and cannabis space

So manny questions and nobody seems to be addressing the Bokhari firing aftermath ?
Why this is Green today? LOL
These guys have no sales what so ever. Earnings it will be .10 cents again
"Durkacz has total control over the shareholder's money of this company, his arrogance and ego should come with a price."
i'm waiting? anyone? looking for someone more stupid than me who has invested in this garbage scam currently ? If the cowered CEO past or present has anything to say please enlighten us with some bs answers for us to laugh at.... Durkacz you lost your moral compass and credibility.
"@Choppa You sir are the hypocritical image at its best and a pumper for Durkacz. Are you Durkacz?Anyway, it doesn't matter. How much b class shareholders money travelled this company to Mr. Durkacz pockets without any result. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? It is your job to do a campaign for NEXT DURKACZ MONEY? He doesn't have enough fraud shareholders money? For those 50 mil are Durkacz and Saeed + Raza stil here."
Let’s wait and see lucid drug pipelines
WHO IS STUCK AT $50
HUGE potential. Best company in all the stock market!
"So damn tired of the clearly paid naysayers and shortsellers on here! FSD Pharma’s recently appointed management team is genuinely trying to lead an organizational shift and strategically positioning the company to pursue growth and sustainable value for all stakeholders. Through its acquisition of Lucid, FSD is pioneering a new treatment approach for mental health and neurodegenerative diseases, pairing a novel family of myelin restoring molecules with psychedelic/cannabis focused therapies. It doesn't get better than that. Give it time and I think we'll see some real results here!"

"@Larry answer to WalterWhite. Raza doesn't have anything to do with WCE - PUMP. Why do you try to divert the discussion? Durkacz closed the deal with Quadron Canatech from Vancouver in spring 2019.

JJ Chamberland funneled WCE money through his own company. Both Shane and JJ employed family members on WCE payroll; children with no experience or necessary background. All the above was possible with blessing from Zara Kanji, CFO (Quadron and WCE), Tamas Josza (appointed President of Soma Labs) on February 2019, with no experience in cannabis/hemp extraction), A. Durkacz and Donal Caroll. Nothing new that these unscrupulous individuals leave unsuspecting investors in the lurch, with money in an empty company that has just seen its stock value tank. They transformed WCE into WCGarbage. This is another proof of Durkacz Pump&Dump setup."

You have a tremendous improvement in weed applications testing and more guided by your new and very knowledgeable streets mart individual new friends and collaborators. This is your cannabis millionaire profile. The reverse of this is you lost all investors trust. Way to go cheap.
"$HUGE has 150,000 retail investors. All these nay sayers trash talkers on here are not one of them. They are all hired by short sellers to post negative comments on this board.

@Pratik. How about Durkacz and Saeed scams? Can someone at least acknowledge past mistakes done? No transparency. Just class A vs. class B shareholders. Same old same old scam.
"The recent 4 years' big no profits were due to Raza + Durkacz + Saeed covid failure tests and no real plan.So profits were never around,and the share price will probably fall lower investing in R&D for the next two years, but once it settles and the bank account will be empty this will be a great investment."

How do you sleep by night? Thanks again."
"Great, so the man who holds a track record of an over 90% failure rate in start-ups with his involvement along with the destruction of retail shareholder value has regained the reigns and is back for more. He's doing such a wonderful job with PUMP (World Class Extractions) and others, investors should have no worries with such leadership back in control. Bokhari had to go and still around, but don't fool yourselves into thinking previous management who regained control is any better......Durkacz people know you and with each day you embarrass yourself more and more. You deceived your friends and close collaborators. You stink and you're dirty. You lost all credibility in front of shareholders like me who lost money following your promises.

He was the guy and Zeeshan who were in their ""friends"" ears telling them lies about what was about to transpire, big huge global deals, around the height of the share price. Yet not a single one of them came true. He pumped and dumped on the friends and acquaintances that trusted him. Durkacz you’re a disgrace. You cannot be trusted."
"@BK, @NN, @NF is the same person. Likely folks sitting in South East Asia, hired by shortsellers. Fellow Investors be ware."
@Verner why so salty against the world? P.S Your English has gotten better :-)
Everyone roasted me for buying shares yesterday. LOL
"By partnering with KCSA, FSD was able to build a more robust investor relations function and better explain its value to the investing community."
This company is a HUGE success! go long!

"Durkacz is an accountant and he cannot fill a bioscience company CEO shoe. This is what happens when a micro-cap stock has been flagrantly pumped to death with the claim of one day being the world's largest hydro premium cannabis producer during the height of promo in the cannabis sector. Back to pumping the balance sheet, further dilution via acquisition, and more heavy-handed promotions. Look at the dates of the last few news releases you can sorta estimate if things are going to pick up soon based on how they do promo etc. the number one thing a company needs are proper exposure and a clear way to explain the business model to potential investors retail investors along with institutional investors are what drive stock prices up. Instead they invest in R&D programs. THis means no return on investment at all."
Durkacz and Saaed lost shareholders trust last three years since they replaced Thomas. Today they ask for another money round to give another chance to another management team being put in place always by...themselves first for themselves.
Bottom line = Durkatz is a sliyiyiyiyiiiiiiim Boaoaoaoawwwwl !!!!!!

Good things come to those who wait
I just bought $5000 worth of these stocks. I heard that this is a can't miss. Hope to make lots of money here.
This red flag was just for now. Be patient man.
"Dr. Raza Bokhari, FSD’s Chief Executive Officer, and his hand picked board members have: failed to address the dramatic loss of shareholder value, with the Company’s shares trading over 97% lower than when Dr. Bokhari was appointed Interim Chief Executive Officer; massively diluted shareholder interests by issuing almost 16 million shares at low prices, increasing the number outstanding by over 83% in just seven weeks; awarded over $5.7 million of bonus share compensation to Dr. Bokhari in February 2021 for services yet to be provided and close to $1 million in shares and/or cash to the other directors (Stephen Buyer, Robert Ciaruffoli, James Datin, Gerald Goldberg and Larry Kaiser), the latter amount being almost twice the previous year’s compensation; caused FSD to reimburse Dr. Bokhari’s privately owned and controlled company for over $1.4 million of expenses in 2020, with limited transparency or explanation; failed to effectively implement the Company’s business plan to become a pharmaceutical and biotechnology company, having to date failed to meet any of their modest stated goals; and denied shareholders any say on the change of the Company’s strategic focus, failing to hold a shareholders’ meeting in 2020 and seeking to delay holding a meeting in 2021."
All the bashers = https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/huge/short-interest
I trust FSD Pharma has a newer solution for this COVID will give us a vaccine.
Like I said. Happy I got a position :)

"@Robin Comment to John post. Why are you so disappointed? Why do you want to knw who John is? It is hurting. What John said there, all related info you can Google. Also every single person here know more or less AD history and the fact that he got his money from cannabis. This is the beauty of being a public figure with good or bad intentions. Anyhow AD is not an inspiration for potential retail investors."
They never answer any shareholders questions. Dose anyone works in the office or just taking a salary from shareholders money. Professional Robbers are right here.

"Nothing says ""red flag"" like a board full of spamming pumpers who have limited posts and constantly change accounts and or names. What's with the spamming? You can post multiple times on your original post to avoid spamming the board, it's almost like someone is trying to intentionally hide something or perhaps they are paid per post. This board and company reeks of deception."
FSD pharma will be great soon ! Expecting a dividend or forward split anyday
$HUGE is going to rise from the ashes.

Back to pumping the balance sheet, further dilution via acquisition, and more heavy handed promotions. Horrible interview by Anthony on Rich TV imo. Anthony playing dumb as to why this company trades below asset value, patting himself on the back for the amount of I'll be nice and say ""shareholders"" he's managed to amass, even going as far as comparing share structure to Apple which may be true to a degree but that's where the similarities end in that little delusion."
We’re sine
@Oleg Oi pumper and clone. A typo it is so important for you?
"Today show up some ""big time"" help for Durkacz the hustler. Small-time pumpers are usually complaining and annoying with no opinion just STERILE PUMPING. Oi, big-time sharks here PLEASE TELL DUKACZ THAT HE IS AN IDIOT that he invested in UHN which is a big hospital organization that does research. Two times FSD money today is not enough to finish some project and do sell something to make some positive for class B shareholders."
"Tell your friends , family to buy HUGE . Borrow as much money as you can cause this is gonna be HUGE !!"
"Don’t forget August 1st, 2021 is a Sunday. There is a tremendous rush to buy and invest today from the likes of 401k, 403b, pension funds, IRA, tuition plans, private investment, foreign investment for their pension plans such as from Norway Denmark Sweden Canada even India China, and Japan. All buying into the United States market due to stability. Yes EU is doing better yet the United States is definitely a more attractive buying opportunity. So I expect the market to end much higher today. For this PUMP stock nothing good. TO get positive you have to make changes. Here nothing changed during the last 4 years. Not good this stock."
@Peter oi Champ . How about you keep it less defensive
What making you stay here with FSD? Me Is that I know that in the next month it will hit up.. I'm seeing the green line going up.
One day FSD Pharma will be great again
Durkacz created politics in FSD and WCE. As long as he is there and do not recon any of his past mistakes he is not to be trusted.
"There is no rocket science. Durkacz, Raza and Saaed are very bad new for shareholders. Retail share holders lost confidence in Anthony Durkacz and his skill to appoint for the fourth time a management for FSD. He wants just next round of cash out..."
FSD Pharma also provides opportunities in skill development through-on-the-job training programs. This directly affects many people in the area by providing them with improved lifestyles and skillsets that they would have otherwise not have received. :)
"I really don’t see this being this low of a marketcap , things should improve as more updates are released giving a clear indication where things are going"

Ugh…when shorts have to write a novel to try and scare you …
What a joke this ended being
"FSD has 150,000 retail shareholders. We are not going to let a handful of short sellers drag this stock down."
"All investors want is great economic returns on business, so if you have a strong management team like we see right now things can go up and down depending on their actions and how they lead the company, if CEO does good moves and deals usually stocks go up, but even with good deals sometimes stocks go down, or sometimes they fly high if it’s a specific niche which shines in the markets"
"@oleg. Boyo, all I want is a return on my investment not to ""pioneer"" anything you cannot sell. You pumpers are all Durkacz. Arrogance and ego."
@oleg. This Lucid is another of Durkacz tricks and endless projects. This kind of development requires 100 to 500 mil . Another way to divert attention from funnel founds
Winds of change are coming soon with new management leading the way

FSD today become a political stage for a few individuals that want just to keep control; Anthony Durkacz and Zeeshan Saeed. Raza bockhari is still around. We cannot make money here.
"Thanks David Rosenburg for your advice. Dear new retail and all categories of investors; hear David here and go on Facebook to see Durkacz Pumping team at work how they cheer each other and plan of how better to do pump HUGE, PUMP stock. Anyway it will be for few years from now because even with Durkacz & Co. efficiency in lining up his own pockets 40 mil + assets represent a lot of money to drain."
"Great, so the man who holds a track record of an over 90% failure rate in start-ups with his involvement along with the destruction of retail shareholder value has regained the reigns and is back for more. He's doing such a wonderful job with PUMP (World Class Extractions) and others, investors should have no worries with such leadership back in control. Bokhari had to go and still around, but don't fool yourselves into thinking previous management who regained control is any better......Durkacz people know you and with each day you embarrass yourself more and more. You deceived your friends and close collaborators. You stink and you?re dirty. You lost all credibility in front of shareholders like me who lost money following your promises. People stay away of this #$%$"

You're an inept individual, a plague within investor community. Are your sons proud of you? How daddy provide with money stolen from shareholders ? you're simply a low life like like your recent friends..."

Buy the dip ! The dip that keeps on dipping .
I guess no news is good news
@oliver You're right Durkacz the hustler.There are four tears since you and your friends chop shareholders money with Huge and Pump. Now you started another failure in fuel cell in Europe; PWWR. Another inept management team; amateurs who faced the court of law more often than a laboratory. Once again your moral compass is missing and you lurch in human swamp.
The company is a joke. Took them 1 year to find that it’s not going to work for commercialization for COVID treatment. Who knows how many patients they tried for Phase-2. Ridiculous.
Durkacz a.k.a. Oliver you're awesome in your despair. Your aliases posting for five times at the time show your true pumping colors to retail investors. You should buy more shares as you did during last five minutes of the market opening yesterday. Did you save the day You're? No sir. You're inept and a disgrace. You embarrassed yourself in front of friends and family. Arrogance is not good. Learn how to be humble. There is always a price to pay.
"Following the termination of Chief Executive Officer Dr. Raza Bokhari for cause, FSD Pharma Inc. appoints Anthony Durkacz as Interim Chief Executive Officer and reinstates Zeeshan Saeed as President."
"Nothing makes sense here for years. Endless projects, no goals, no specifics, no plan. Shareholder's money spent on lawsuit without any goal. People around, probably clones pumpers and people that lost continously money with Durkacz, Saeed and Bockhari. No hope whatsoever."

Swift Changes are coming guys New management will be working hard to delivery shareholder value.... Not sure why RAZA BOKHARI is still the CEO?
"If Raza was still CEO, no project would be brought to completion, At-least the founders are doing what they have committed to do. They said they will investigate and fire Raza, review the feasibility on COVID trials, end it if not feasible, start acquisitions of psychedelic companies and biotech plays. They have done all 3. Hopefully they will execute on them and bring them to completion unlike Raza."

@peter pumper at best
"No significant news. Nothing Since Durkacz and Saeed got “back” ?!?!?! the company. Who was it that appointed Bokhari again? Some are under the impression incoming management is new, not so. The so-called ""New"" management is actually the old management pre-Raza which is comprised of individuals responsible for the world's largest hydro facility promotional P&D and the appointment of Bokhari."
"@Beef. Good morning Durkacz, clone& clowns. You're again ready to start fresh your new pump to cash from FSD and WCE. Whatever you do it is for sure you want to keep control forever. Durkacz, FRC created thosec"
"Saying ""Make FSD great again"" or ""Restore FSD Pharma"" is laughable. Restore it to what? And it was never great to begin with. FSD Pharma is known for breaking volume records on the exchange due to capitalizing on hype and heavy-handed promotion for which they were warned. That's it, nothing more. Who was in charge when investors were misled about the world's largest hydro build out? Anthony constantly placing blame and pointing his finger elsewhere will only go so far. Investors want a full investigation into this company and ALL management involved. Some are under the impression incoming management is new, not so. The so called ""New"" management is actually the old management pre Raza which is comprised of individuals responsible for the world's largest hydro facility promotional P&D and the appointment of Bokhari."

"Just take a step back and take a look at what is going on....cannabis and biotech companies all reporting incredible ERs with tremendous growth WITH very positive guidance going forward. Manufactures all reporting beats with significant growth and constantly guiding upwards with positive outlooks going forward. Other manufacturers will likely report similar strong ER's this week. Extraction equipment companies (destroyed earnings) are and will likely continue reporting even more significant earnings and growth due to unprecedented demand. The biotech industry is looking outstanding right now and has an even brighter future. ER's are reflecting this nicely. I'm severely bullish on this company right now and many of the stocks, particularly FRCC stocks that are just stopped or going down. This Durkacz should go and try politics. Their people make promises and do not care about; remember just once in four years they have to cash out at elections."
In the first place we all here to watch our money grow. So yes to FSD
I lost money with this #$%$ Nothing changed. No hope to get my money back with those guys back.
How much have you lost when they went up from the last split?
$HUGE vs $CMPS that's what I think will happen
"@Pratik, Oliver other Clones and Durkacz. Can you please tell us how much money and time cost shareholders to CORRECT YOUR MISTAKE made three years ago? Now, for the fourth time YOU CLAIM you need support . You did make same mistake with WCE. Your past is failure Durkacz. You become a rich cannabis hustler that CANNOT BE TRUSTED."
"Is this company real? Have they ever produced anything since 1998? Can I take a tour of their facilities? These are all real questions. I would like to see the progress on the cat and dog gastrointestinal disease program. Frankly, it sounds made up, Jerry."
@ Pratik. Random accountant cannot be CEO in bioscience but Durkacz can. His arrogance and ego cover everything and doesn't matter the results for shareholders. All that matter to him is to stay on top of the rest of the money for his and his friends benefit.
@oliver. Everybody knows THAT APPARENTLY RAZA IS OUT BUT IN FACT HE IS NOT. Durkacz you embayourself again.
@ Larry. Oi Durkacz the Hustler; you're a pitiful cheap and continuously embarrass yourself and people that know you with this arrogant behavior. Your clon here Larry has 32 posts total and a month lifetime. You're forfeit. Nobody trust you anymore. People lost confidence in you.
"@ Peter; you're a CLONE issued 30 days ago with 30 posts. Anthony Durkacz your THADE MARK is DECIVING. You deceived every single person who was depending of your ""advice"". On this post every single individual who show your failures automatically is called, shorter, basher or whatever else. Instead of pumping with your clone army YOU BETTER GET TO WORK! You replaced 3 CEO and now finally you're there. Nothing is happening; this is the proof that YOU DO NOT DESERVE ANY TRUST."

"Hey dum dum ,$LOVE has the best weed in quebec, PUMP is generating $10,000,000 a year roughly in revenues, Pill has hard pill patents which were impossible to get and took a while, High tide also doing well why don't you mention that? How about Gratomic from 5 cents to $1.60 and it's still stable. Why don't you speak facts oh yeah that's right you come here to spew nonsense to trick people. Also I predict FSD Pharma is going to be solid one day and that all the problems arose because of raza bokhari . Zeeshan and Anthony used their own money to hire their own lawyers to fight a battle which was backed by fsd pharma money that raza used so almost ulimited funding , yet the courts sided with Anthony and zeeshan and the newly elect directors. Sometimes in life not everything goes in straight line, but i promise you think. If they are able to ever achieve on bringing back shareholder value everyone will start to be FICKLE. If you don't know what fickle means go google it."
Also probable that we get a dividend announcement!! Don’t sell
All the neighsayers are going to regret things soon
One time on my portfolio biggest % holding was Bombardier and FSD. After new management Bombardier recovered really well. Less chances for the same with FSD but anything is possible. Hoping for the positive Phase 2 results so most of long here can recover there money and if we’re lucky enough to make $ on top of it. Time will tell.
"Durkacz, Raza, Zeeshan are equally responsible of FSD decline and shareholders money lost."
razaaaaaa bout to make vaccine for covid 20 using his PP technology 
Fun fact Auxly Sunens facility is 1.1 million sqaure feet. Which is also 25 acres.and 10 Hectares. #huge
We’re done another 201/1 split lololol shame
Durkacz and Saaed are...
Durkatz during his moments of wisdom;
"Stock price is .02 (pre-reverse split) what a sad joke! And no nobody is coming to save the day, thus dog is dead in my opinion, and we all lose our money. Just need to be honest with yourselves here. No hope for this “company” bankruptcy for sure on the horizons, unless more scamming occurs before that."
"I love the slow and steady climb for FSD! A hidden gem that is, nice cash flow for Mr. Durkacz, Mr. Saeed and Mr. Bockhari. Very comfortably adding to my position, B shareholder, on every red day. I think $0.3, not more by year-end is a realistic outlook here. By next year the founds of 40 mil will be more than half gone. Top management will have a nice life for the next two to three years, It is not the life wonderful?"
"Look at VRPX, MMS019 product candidate to inhibit viral replication caused by influenza or SARS-CoV-2. HUGE Management is busy fighting and sleeping and burning Shareholders money on Court and lawyers, Keeping research a side. Some people are treating company like their personal assets. All should be jailed."
"On this post become a habit that if a investor make an aversive mark to Anthony Durkacz, to be qualified shorter or whatever else. It is obvious that Durkacz want the control of the money for his and friends own benefit. This is why he just gets shareholders money on projects whish never get finished."
"Bokhari's stint as CEO was investigated by a special committee, which looked into ""a number of accusations."""
Let’s goooo
"Great, so the man who holds a track record of an over 90% failure rate in start-ups with his involvement along with the destruction of retail shareholder value has regained the reigns and is back for more. He's doing such a wonderful job with PUMP (World Class Extractions) and others, investors should have no worries with such leadership back in control. Bokhari had to go, but don't fool yourselves into thinking previous management who regained control is any better......"
@oliver Durkacz and Saeed keep FSD changing for 4 years. I understand from you that changes take time; how long sir? another 4 years? Durkacz will run out of money ... because credibility is gone
"Before FSD first raise in 2018, Durkacz had a rental at pier 1 and owned a average car. After 2018 he bought the condominium at 1.3 mil and last year bought a Maserati. Saeed own from 2018 a SUV Lamborghini. They continuously cash out from PUMP (Durkacz is Chairman) and FSD. They appointed just inept people CEOs in order to keep money coming. Today Durkacz is arrogantly lining up his pockets on class B shareholders money. PUMP and HUGE are Ponzi scheme and more to come in green energy setup by First Republic Capital and Co."
"Lots of hate here , why?"" because over 1,000,000 shares short ... lol listen big changes are coming at FSD Pharmahttps://youtu.be/UL5Jk8SaFFI"
Time to buy the dip.
"PUMP, HUGE, LOVE, PILL tickers alone should have been HUGE red flag along with companies founders and managements. These stocks were hype based/driven and heavily promoted or ""pumped"" as many invested or ""gambled"" on future promises of companies and their managements word alone instead of on companies’ performance, execution of business plans, results, or track record."
"Glad I got in on this last week. Psychedelic market will be bigger than Cannabis and is the next gold rush. Lucid currently has 2 novel molecules targeting mental health, that alone is a ten bagger."
FSD today has a well-balanced board of directors that will assist the company in reaching its full potential.
"Hello PUMPERS or MAMA CLONE and MAIN PUMPER = ANTHONY DORKACZ. How it's life other than pumping? You don't have one, I am pretty sure, why? BECAUSE YOU ARE DESPERATE AND REDUNDANT. No worries we will be always around for HUGE, PUMP and....THE nEW FACKUP PWWR."
Look at all the shortseller bashers here
What a terrible company. No future. Still have their free money sitting at 58 after 201/1 split. Crooks
"@ Simon Hey bro, you kill us with your false PUMPED hope. If Durkacz HUGE EGO deflates a bit and his arrogancy getaway there is probably hope for some improvement. Otherwise this is a DEAD END"
"Over 1,000,000 shares short , these guys are talking bad all the time to get you to sell your shares hold strong !"
Just came in the check on the pumpers who got their bags depleted by this tragedy of a company. SELL YOUR SHARES!
"I'm looking for a job. I have no experience so I would be a good fit working for this company. I promise to be a #$%$ just like the CEO and learn how to steal shareholders money. What a great job that would be. And when they fire me I can get a million dollar settlement. Dam I want to work, for HUGE.."
"@oliver. If Raza scammed everyone means Durkacz, Zeeshan, Caroll are simply once again inappropriate to continue. It is not for first time. Why are they still within FSD. It is because from first beginning they are ..."
"FSD recruited another consultant to do a more thorough evaluation of its principal pharmaceutical component, ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), or FSD201, in order to determine its present commercial viability."
"Message to Dirtkacz & FSD aka Goldstein family. For all your actual PONZI schemes and next you will already propose in Green Energi, if you do not do your job properly..."
"The news release hints at a high level description on what catalysts are coming, nothing is ever for sure if deals go through but if the deals to go through and the company is generally in a bull market stock prices reflects with confidence on business model and investor sentiment"
"Raza Bokahri LOST , Now the cheerleeders = shortseller trying to attack anthony ! Pathethic!"
"I’m on the phone with Oli , hodl on"
Can we get our money from this #$%$
Only three years too late.
Don’t miss the boat . Tomorrow it’s load up day ! This is going to $50!
"Honestly, I have followed this stock for a long long time; fundamentals and growth are as solid as apple pie. Sure thing. Price will never go up. Steady down."
"YEA, FSD has all jammed up again on pumping job – Clones are Robin, Jesse, Keith, Andriana, Larry, Lisa, Peter, Seth. All of them have up to 24 reactions and 35 days on the post. Maybe cause all the various economic damage is like a new thing to them? Ground Hog day politics I guess coming up from Anthony Durkacz, Saeed, and in shadow now Raza. Recovery is just going to take infinite time because there is the OLD MANAGEMENT in place. DURKACZ YOU’RE A DISGRACE AND YOU EMBARRASS YOURSELF CONTINUOUSLY. FSD is also going to need a sustained dependable yearly payment for 2 more to 4 more years. Forget all the added programs or collaborations - trickle up, everyone gets the needed help then. It's really really easy to forecast guys. ---Were NOT done yet! FSD NEVER WILL BE of any help for Class B shareholders."
This has to be the most undervalued stock in the sector. Cash + assets > market cap.
$HUGE is looking great. Steady growth this week. Looks like the new management team is finally working some magic! Next stop psychedelics.
Where the bulls at
Time to bring this to new levels

Look at the dates of the last few news releases you can sorta estimate if things are going to pick up soon based on how they do promo etc. the number one thing a company needs is proper exposure and a clear way to explain the business model to potential investors retail investors along with institutional investors are what drive stock prices up
"What a great year is it to invest in Huge, I am sure you wouldn't regret investing here."
@ Verner - Maybe you should learn to spell 'companies' first before you spew your hate on here? You seem like one of Raza's offshore guys who can't even speak english!
It's going up Monday
Durkatz is not only a Jack #$%$ ; he?s also a very sly fox !!
Choppa. Oi clone. You have the same profile as oliver. lol
FSD Pharma is one of the best company to invest on! So let's buy more shares!!!
At the beginning I hoped the profits from this stock would let me help my grandson go to college. Now it looks like he better get a job so he can lend me a few bucks. Total disappointment
@ george. It is right. No earnings. Durkacz brand is deceiving and always has no plan but excuses and a lot of pumping. The value will be always in his and his friend's pockets. They need just time to squeeze to the last dime. lol
I wish the managent is checking the forum periodically so they know what the shareholders are thinking about them and their confidence.
"@ Appopeeso. With all due respect the way I know Durkacz, Raza Bockhari had a deal with Durkacz and Saeed. The show in court ended up in a deal and Bokhari got all his rights and a part of the pie ( shareholders money). Raza Bockhari is always around. Everything is at shareholders money. The cost of all this show is many millions. Durkacz is a jerk. He doesn't have any moral compass, figure of speech of his hypocritical character. For this egomaniac and arrogant persona he can be CEO in bioscience and setup CEO in fuel cell. He is just a poor accountant that got on hype with cannabis and now false business investor banking = hustler"
