"There is a pattern in FSD management development “strategy” or better a scheming scheme. Interim CEO buy a company without a professional preliminary study. Then he wakes up or see around negative opinion or no results about his “achievement” then buy the next one to patch his previous sloppy job. And probably there is next one to come. This way FSD is bleeding shareholders money because this nonsense practice shows that there is no plan to move forward. This is why even if management has access to cash they choose to continually dilute shareholders. If management were confident in past and present acquisitions and their ability to execute then there's no need to continually do so, spending for a proper planning. FSD balance sheet, is needed because it has been used to lure in retail investors over the years."
@William. There are many companies developing psychedelics. Professionals. With FSD today's management YOUR EGG IS ROTTEN.
If you take into account the share price before that criminal reverse split this isn’t even worth one cent.
On this forum Anthony Durkacz pumping faces/clones work tirelessly not to promote HUGE but to scuze AD the hustler for the mistakes over mistakes he did before with all his startups. They ask for PATIENCE and UNDERSTANDING from people who lost money here. WHAT FOR? To get back on track the stock? NO SIR! TO CONTINUE WITH AD because AD NEEDS ANOTHER CHANCE. During last four years AD bad decisions and his own interest cost class B shareholders tens of millions just with FSD and PUMP. DESERVES AD ANOTHER CHANCE AND ANOTHER TRUST PAID WITH NEW MONEY? If you trust him pay him. It's up to you people.
"@ David Rosenburg. You look like a fair pumper not like a Dirkacz face ex. V, Nicky, Juliette, Simon, Oliver, Oleg, etc. Please rephrase your precious 3 hours ago statement: WE ARE GO FOR THE 4TH LAUNCH after 3 PREVIOUS FAILURES. All failures were expensed to the class B shareholders."
Hexo CEO left 7 days ago...amid strategic reorganization.
"Simply...who wanted to buy the discounted options offered with the $ new emission $1,8 has already bought. So there is a place for small price rise...And to all complaining colleagues ... the newly obtained money are ""for a reason"".. and the newly nominated Chief Executive Officer is ""for a reason""... we can expect something reasonably huuuuuge... and rather soon...Real investing is not a Las Vegas Cassino.."
"@ Curt 7 posts you have WHAT ARE YOU? A pumper I presume ( 7 posts). Whomever wrote here SIR, you're a pumper and YOU OVERSIGHT THE MAIN FACT . IN BIONTECH DEVELOPMENT YOU NEED professional top management to show shareholders care. AD it is not. AD is simply a HUSTLER. DO NOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH BYOTHECH DEVELOPMENT. HUSTLER Aims the money"
"@oliver. AD how much did cost your letter? 10, 20 large? We know you're nice and you aren't chip when we talk spending shareholders money to cover your inept activity and push your image. How about a letter you tell us for how long your ""interim"" status keeps you around? Probably forever but I believe it's going to be just about to spend FSD money. You need it."
"I feel that with all that their technology is capable of ""doing"", not much because they have to patch up the team very often, more no capabilities are yet to be discovered. With increasing payment to research, labs, cancer facilities, and others, the possibility that one or more may make a discovery to be of use will blow this stock wide open. They spent a lot of money and plan the future on the money they don't have. 40 mil is not enough. Other biotech spent next to 0.5 to 1 billion in research to get to some results"
"Perhaps those who have been involved since the IPO or even pre IPO and would like to see the seemingly endless cycle and destruction of retail shareholder value under ANY form of management cease in all companies under the direct supervision and involvement of one Mr. Durkacz. ""New"" chance? No, same OLD chance looking for NEW $$$$$ and yet another chance. Recent filings show Anthony and crew have rewarded themselves yet again, and for what exactly? Every time they have rewarded themselves when the price slips they always seem to award themselves more. Retail shareholders don't have that luxury as they are required to invest more of their own capital in order to cost average down whereas management - AD & Co. continually grants and awards themselves more FREEBIES."
It's a no-brainer as to why FSD Pharma currently trades @ net asset value.
"This is actually becoming a bit comical. I will give this until the end of December and if it can't begin to run by then, so be it. This will never recover."
@Juliette. With same management for four years there is no hope FSD will ever recover. AD and FRC will make sure money will be drained consistently
"??? How do we pay for expansion of new endeavor of the new CEO?. He expects another 70 mil,to be completed in 20-36 Mos. Guess we wait for a long while"
@ William and Daniel. You right you Dirtkacz faces. AD shows a lot of determination in spending without any preliminary feasability study. He doesn't know what this kind of analysis means. He wants the money no matter what.
"@oliver Letters, videos and empty words. How about some results. WOW SORRY no results. BIOTECHNOLOGY IS HARD . We have to wait few years. Perhaps 2025 or so"
@ Austin = AD Your close circle knows very well AD you're a gambler. No problems with that but here you gamble shareholders money. For you this doesn't make any difference.
great company lololol
Haven't been here since March (mid $2 range). I got a lot of hate for telling people to cut their losses on this scam. Seems like there are A LOT of paid pumpers on here trying to mislead people that this fail of a company (if we can even call it that) will turn things around and make them some money. DO NOT BUY THIS unless you are looking to minimize your taxes through a tax loss. LOL
