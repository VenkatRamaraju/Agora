"I keep reading that investing in FSD is just a waste of money, same management, same money taking scheme. FSD already knows that if they do the same thing they did in the past they are not going anywhere, so what would be the point? I don't know if FSD will recover , no one does, but I do see promise in psychedelics, maybe this will be the golden egg they have been waiting for."
I can smell another psychedelic acquisition coming by FSD Pharma. Wonder which company they will acquire next!
"Anyone going to be transparent by sharing the details of the Covar/FSD agreement, potential cost to shareholders, or just continue to blindly pump the agreement without providing the full details as usual. FSD has had a horrible track record with more than several agreements in place over the years."
"Perhaps those who have been involved since the IPO or even pre IPO and would like to see the seemingly endless cycle and destruction of retail shareholder value under ANY form of a management cease in all companies under the direct supervision and involvement of one Mr Durkacz. ""New"" chance? No, same OLD chance looking for NEW $ and yet another chance. Recent filings show Anthony and crew have rewarded themselves yet again, and for what exactly? Every time they have rewarded themselves when the price slips they always seem to award themselves more. Retail shareholders don't have that luxury as they are required to invest more of their own capital in order to cost average down whereas management continually grants and awards themselves more FREEBIES."
A.D.
"@ Daniel. Excellent idea Mr. Daniel Sir, Let's get real here... You're an F PUMPER FACE. Sorry Sir, DIrkacz the pumping king face. Durkacz did bring HUGE, PUMP, and PWWR to hit the rock bottom. The new money will not help. It is too insignificant; Durkacz got fat and needs more and more and more shareholders' money because he is hungry. But the most important there is a point in the near future than people will ask him for money. the shareholder's money he simply volatilized since the beginning."
"@oliver Letters, videos and empty words. How about some results. WOW SORRY no results. BIOTECHNOLOGY IS HARD . We have to wait few years. Perhaps 2025 or so"

"Sprinkling sugar on #$%$ doesn't make it chocolate. Anyone remotely involved in this market is already well aware of this train wreck and the underhanded tactics employed by management through promotion and other means. Don't quit your day job, on second thought please do. lost money will neve come back. gfy"
"FSD & COVAR Pharma partnership - ""Clinical development of Lucid-PSYCH is continuing under the leadership of Dr. Lakshmi P. Kotra, B.Pharm.(Hons), Ph.D. , the Chief Executive Officer of Lucid Psycheceuticals Inc., of FSD’s wholly-owned subsidiary, with Investigational New Drug (“IND”)- enabling studies currently underway, and preclinical efficacy studies being conducted in collaboration with the University Health Network , the largest health research organization in Canada.

"This is actually becoming a bit comical. I will give this until the end of December and if it can't begin to run by then, so be it. This will never recover."
Here goes the sinking ship again... Down she goes..... 
Markets turning to green and this toilet cant stop taking a ???????????????????????????
@V Hey Durkacz pumper face! Dirtkacz is the best spending shareholders money uselessly. For four years since he got lucky with cannabis shareholders money he simply sink everything. Same case here so far and with his last R&D project there is no hope for future. Real investors get to something that make sense.
@Juliette. With same management for four years there is no hope FSD will ever recover. AD and FRC will make sure money will be drained consistently
"Simply...who wanted to buy the discounted options offered with the $ new emission $1,8 has already bought. So there is a place for small price rise...And to all complaining colleagues ... the newly obtained money are ""for a reason"".. and the newly nominated Chief Executive Officer is ""for a reason""... we can expect something reasonably huuuuuge... and rather soon...Real investing is not a Las Vegas Cassino.."
@ William and Don. Dirtkacz always reset the past and give himself chances. This is always on shareholder expense. Dirtkacz you're embarrassing yourself continously. Lol
Huge joke if the year
This will never recover
Psychedelics market for mental Illness: CAGR of 16.3% during 2020–27 and expected to reach US$6.9 Billion by 2027 from $2.0 Billion in 2019. FSD Pharma is definitely going in the right direction
great company lololol
@ Austin = AD Your close circle knows very well AD you're a gambler. No problems with that but here you gamble shareholders money. For you this doesn't make any difference.
Ok who tossed out the anchor  cause it's going down again...
"Equity guru: Is FSD Pharma getting into psychedelics to avoid being delisted from the nasdaq?The company filed an Investigational IND with the FDA in August 2020 and was given the green light just a month later to initiate a phase 2 clinical trial for the use of FSD201 to treat COVID-19. But last month announced they were terminating the study. Another L for FSD Pharma. Can we please change this company’s name to SMDH Pharma. They were cannabis, then they were Covid, now they are psychedelics. They can’t seem to make up their mind, it all feels pretty random and fly by night. They also seem to burn their bridges after each phase instead of integrating a series of different verticals under one rooftop kind of like Revive (RVV.C) did. It’s been a bizarre strategy and the company’s share price has been nothing more than a flatline with the occasional blip for years now. Whatever trend comes after psychedelics I wouldn’t surprised to see another pivot, CEO, rollback, etc."
Been holding onto $HUGE for a few years now. I think we will finally reap the benefits of our patience with FSD. Not worried as long as they continue to chug away and make progress.
"Apparently, HUGE is doing fain and A Durkacz need more money for next .....NOBODY KNOWS WHAT but following his record it will be something that cannot be achieved within 6 months, no sir because 6 months doesn't reach his personal goals. Shareholders return? Doesn't exist on Durkacz agenda. No just to line up his pockets as long as possible. The problem with PUMP is there is no plan and never results. Nonsense projects stopped and repeated. THEY NEED TO draw in new investors, bleed them dry and move on, while management and promoters are compensated. This company is nothing more than a banker gambling at the expense of its shareholders."
"@ pratik Dear Sir you assume ""interim"" CEO"" is forever for AD? If yes means AD seek just to be CEO no matter what."
"It is time to consider FSD in the investment portfolio, the shares are below $ 1.5 USD low risk investment and with a promising future."
How about another 201/1 split jail time
"@ Shaq, Jane new vintage pumpers and J dusted pumper. This is payback for last 2 mil lost money by Durjacz Hey hustler you want to move pumping at next level. Good luck with that."
This is a real dump. It is obvious an extra pumping effort.
@ William and Daniel. You right you Dirtkacz faces. AD shows a lot of determination in spending without any preliminary feasability study. He doesn't know what this kind of analysis means. He wants the money no matter what.
"@ Shaq. What is so exciting Pumper? Dirtkacz working at the office and figuring out Lucid, his latest ""acquisition"" cannot complete anything because they don't have the team (a while back you scrim hopefully they hire) and today they ask somebody else to do trials? This is the turnaround and spinning wheels development from Durkacz. Nothing good for shareholders return here. lol "
"@oliver. AD how much did cost your letter? 10, 20 large? We know you're nice and you aren't chip when we talk spending shareholders money to cover your inept activity and push your image. How about a letter you tell us for how long your ""interim"" status keeps you around? Probably forever but I believe it's going to be just about to spend FSD money. You need it."
@ Business Financial. Wow this is a new pumping tag. You're problem here pumper is you are 32 minutes old with 7 posts all over the place. Same old same old habit Durkacz.
$HUGE is by far one of the most undervalued psychedelic stocks in my opinion. Their LUCID-Psych molecule is far more superior than the $CMPS psilocybin molecule. Not to mention it is a proprietary molecule with IP around it. $CMPS is currently trading at $40. $HUGE is trading at $1.40. Both on NASDAQ.
"@Austin You 7 posts charmer. Every single person here knows how it works. no need to be lectured by a pumper or better YOU TO APOLIGISE FOR DURKACZ CONTINOUS FAILURE> But to keep continuously Anthony Durkacz who made just errors at all levels, around, it is more than accepting risks when investing. You fool me once it's your fault, you foul me twice it's my fault, You foul me three times...FGY you the face and Durkacz"
@ Barren Wuffett. New Dirtkacz face but built in two days and 15 posts. Dirtkacz the CHIEF PUMPER this is what you learned from last 2 mil investment? You don't care. Not your money. Sorry shareholders money.
@V. V what's going on Dirtkacz? This is negative pumping. What's wrong? Did you have some of those psychedelic medicine or probably just the usual daily stuff.
Hexo CEO left 7 days ago...amid strategic reorganization.
@William. There are many companies developing psychedelics. Professionals. With FSD today's management YOUR EGG IS ROTTEN.
"Lots of talk on FSD everyday.Seems like Lucid don’t work as expected by AD, (nothing new) the working relationship and planned marketing is likely all scrapped. Lucid doesn’t have the works.This is all unravelling like a scam."
"One billion shares.No matter what FSD Pharma (HUGE.N) does, I will always remember them as the company that bragged endlessly about having more than a billion shares outstanding. That was their whole philosophy, they went so far as to go with HUGE as their ticker. They also completed the biggest reverse split I have ever seen. With news that FSD Pharma, a Nasdaq listed company is getting involved in psychedelics I thought there might be at least some excitement, maybe some investors who weren’t around in the cannabis days. The general consensus from what I have seen is to stay away at all costs unless something fundamentally shifts, there are other more qualified and better run companies out there. FSD Pharma has been a gong show since its inception."
"There is a pattern in FSD management development “strategy” or better a scheming scheme. Interim CEO buy a company without a professional preliminary study. Then he wakes up or see around negative opinion or no results about his “achievement” then buy the next one to patch his previous sloppy job. And probably there is next one to come. This way FSD is bleeding shareholders money because this nonsense practice shows that there is no plan to move forward. This is why even if management has access to cash they choose to continually dilute shareholders. If management were confident in past and present acquisitions and their ability to execute then there's no need to continually do so, spending for a proper planning. FSD balance sheet, is needed because it has been used to lure in retail investors over the years."
"Another red day in psychedelics. All my holdings $MMED, $CYBN, $HUGE, $CMPS and $FTRP are in the red today.  I believe in the medicine. HODL."
never gain trust no more
"The problem with PUMP is there is no plan and have never been results. Nonsense projects stopped and repeat. Draw in new investors, bleed them dry and move on, while management and promoters are compensated. This company is nothing more than a banker gambling at the expense of its shareholders."
"Let's face it, there's a lot we DON'T KNOW about what is in the works with this company.What we do know is that if we get even a shred of hope that whatever they do will go forward without a huge delay, the stock will rocket into the stratosphere. What happens between now and then really doesn't mean too much in the grand scheme of things. It could go either way at this point. They spend a lot and continuously. The history of this stock wasn’t always clear."
@Daniel. Hi the new one. Told the other Dyrkacz faces; as long as he is around I am around. Can you explain how you plan to take care of class B shareholders? Also tell me where can I go to recover the money I lost because AD deceived me?
@William 1o posts but you pump wisely.
"??? How do we pay for expansion of new endeavor of the new CEO?. He expects another 70 mil,to be completed in 20-36 Mos. Guess we wait for a long while"
"@William & Court . Players/pumper ask for a chance. How many times Dirtkacz had a chance so far? Three times already. This is the fourth time. You fouled me once is my fault, you fouled me twice is your fault, you fouled me three times. . ., you got the habit and it is in your gut. You're made this way DIRTKACZ THE HUSTLER. FSD CEO's shoes are too bog for an accountant. Let professionals do the job and step out ! Otherwise you prove again how arrogance destroy a corporation and everything you touch."
"Psychedelics development requires money in excess of 100 mil, strong management and a skilled team in order to get results fast. Durkacz burned 40 mil. with WCE without having any working prototype for cannabis or hemp oil extraction. They ended today doing delivery after acquiring another company. With FSD this is the fourth attempt to do.....""R&D"". Durkacz lost credibility in front of shareholders. For how long is this interim CEO ?!?!?"
"I feel that with all that their technology is capable of ""doing"", not much because they have to patch up the team very often, more no capabilities are yet to be discovered. With increasing payment to research, labs, cancer facilities, and others, the possibility that one or more may make a discovery to be of use will blow this stock wide open. They spent a lot of money and plan the future on the money they don't have. 40 mil is not enough. Other biotech spent next to 0.5 to 1 billion in research to get to some results"
"There are a lot of new companies making treatments with psyquedelics, but I undestand the molecule of Lucid, has a better quality and future on market, and now they are with FSD. I'll do more research."
Huge is controlled today by sick people The stock is continuously under 2 $ for 2 years in row. BEST PONZI SCHEME ON THE MARKET.
@William. Let's examine your new PUMPING FACE DURKACZ. 9 POSTS and crazy pumper night. AD you've got all needed money to do something good within last 4 years and yet you're coming here to ask more time and money.
@Neil. Oi Durkacz the hustler. Prove yourself. For 4 years you fail consistently and continously.
"Dear pumpers and especially the Master Pumper Mr. A. Durkacz. What did you announce? A bright future for FSD and shareholders after your deal with Lucid? What kind of structure has Lucid today? Johny, your pumping face announced that Lucid is hiring: Join us | Neurosciences | Neurobehavioral sciences | Lucid Psycheceuticals Inc. | TorontoIf they hire all the below positions Means they did not have too much. Once again Durkacz you cannot achieve a project. Don’t be sad you never achieved anything. • Process Chemist (ideally experience in process chemistry, GLP/GMP) – 1 position • Scientist/Senior Scientist (neurodegenerative disorders, preferred background in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease, preclinical/clinical) – 1 position • Scientist/Senior Scientist (Mental health, preferred background in major clinical depression and anxiety, preclinical/clinical) – 1 position • Business Development/Marketing (experience in neurosciences space, synergistic partnerships, product planning, market analytics, licensing, deal flow) – 1 position • Intellectual Property Manager (background in drug substances and drug product patents, neurosciences and pharmaceutical chemistry) • Clinical Director (background in neurosciences, product development, experience in managing multi-site clinical trials in multiple jurisdictions)"
ive shorted a lot of pennies off this stock over the years I come back here for memes
Haven't been here since March (mid $2 range). I got a lot of hate for telling people to cut their losses on this scam. Seems like there are A LOT of paid pumpers on here trying to mislead people that this fail of a company (if we can even call it that) will turn things around and make them some money. DO NOT BUY THIS unless you are looking to minimize your taxes through a tax loss. LOL
"AD the paper boy, always promoting and pushing that paper based on ""plans"" or ""intentions"" instead of RESULTS."
"The $45 mil is used to lure investors in, they've had it on the balance sheet for years. Then once in they continue to hold the cash and dilute shareholders and expect them to be greatful for it as if they are doing shareholders a favor. This company leverages it's risk at the expense of it's shareholders imo."
"On this forum, it is a MUST to mention all efforts made by the management to underline some positive if they do whatever dream on. Nothing positive in CONTINOUS PUMPING. A new pumping face after another Austin, Jane, Sam. You call people names or whatever you desire if there is one single opinion against the interim CEO AD. This company is nothing more than a banker gambling at the expense of its shareholders. Pumpers on multiple chat boards. HERE New FAKE FACE for AD; JESS, DON, BOBBY AXELROD, OLEG, ARYA START, MATT, V, ROBIN, OLIVER. Last week each post comes up with 9 to ten thumbs up in two minutes' time. This week they changed the strategy, less instant thumbs up. Nice work to you AD. Nothing more to say, you embarrass yourself again."
"Interesting, see what pops up when you Google: Goyal vs FSD Pharma."
@Austin. You're Dirtkacz newest pumper face. How do you recover all the money investors lost because of Dirtkacz. Any ideas?
Wow another year down the tubes this will never recober
"@ Curt 7 posts you have WHAT ARE YOU? A pumper I presume ( 7 posts). Whomever wrote here SIR, you're a pumper and YOU OVERSIGHT THE MAIN FACT . IN BIONTECH DEVELOPMENT YOU NEED professional top management to show shareholders care. AD it is not. AD is simply a HUSTLER. DO NOT ANYTHING TO DO WITH BYOTHECH DEVELOPMENT. HUSTLER Aims the money"
@oliver. Dukacz you FINALLY got interim CEO FOREVER and you never did anything good for any of your startup companies. You just spent shareholders money with no result or return on investment.
On this forum Anthony Durkacz pumping faces/clones work tirelessly not to promote HUGE but to scuze AD the hustler for the mistakes over mistakes he did before with all his startups. They ask for PATIENCE and UNDERSTANDING from people who lost money here. WHAT FOR? To get back on track the stock? NO SIR! TO CONTINUE WITH AD because AD NEEDS ANOTHER CHANCE. During last four years AD bad decisions and his own interest cost class B shareholders tens of millions just with FSD and PUMP. DESERVES AD ANOTHER CHANCE AND ANOTHER TRUST PAID WITH NEW MONEY? If you trust him pay him. It's up to you people.
Does anyone know what's happening with this stock? Lost my 20 K here and with PUMP. no hope.
"@ David Rosenburg. You look like a fair pumper not like a Dirkacz face ex. V, Nicky, Juliette, Simon, Oliver, Oleg, etc. Please rephrase your precious 3 hours ago statement: WE ARE GO FOR THE 4TH LAUNCH after 3 PREVIOUS FAILURES. All failures were expensed to the class B shareholders."
When's bankruptcy? My 98% loss looks good but not 100% good. Biggest scam in the market.
AD pumping the balance sheet fishing for new investors yet again with more promotional videos and articles.
"AD the dilution pumper king at it yet again with another round of paid promotion and another acquisition at the expense of shareholders via more dilution all while trying to spin facts and portray himself as some sort of savior. With a balance sheet showing plenty of cash on hand, why would they choose to dilute shareholders yet again?"
@oliver oi pumper. With Dirtkacz around FSD has...
It's a no-brainer as to why FSD Pharma currently trades @ net asset value.
"The Devil is in the details:Could AD have possibly chosen Lucid in part due to his self interest already being a shareholder and warrant holder of Lucid? Lucid Transaction Details: The Transaction will be effected by way of a three-cornered amalgamation between Lucid, FSD Pharma and a wholly-owned subsidiary of FSD Pharma. The Transaction will involve the issuance of approximately 4.5 million Class B subordinate voting shares in the capital of FSD Pharma (each, an ""FSD Share"") as the acquisition consideration (the ""Consideration Shares""), with a deemed aggregate purchase price of approximately US$9 million (CAD$11.3 million based on an exchange rate of US$1 to CAD$1.255) at a deemed price of US$2.00 (CAD$2.51) per FSD Share. The Consideration Shares may be adjusted slightly in the event the market price of the FSD Shares changes significantly prior to closing of the Transaction. Additionally, all of the outstanding Lucid stock options and warrants will become exercisable into FSD Shares, with the number and exercise price of such securities to be adjusted in accordance with the Transactions exchange ratio. The closing of the Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions for a transaction of this nature including, among other things, Lucid obtaining the requisite shareholder approval at a special meeting of Lucid shareholders to be called to consider the Transaction (the ""Lucid Meeting""). The closing of the Transaction is expected to occur in September 2021. The Transaction will require approval by 66 2/3% of the votes cast by Lucid shareholders at the Lucid Meeting. Lucid shareholders holding at least 66 2/3% of the shares of Lucid, have entered into support agreements with FSD Pharma (the ""Support Agreements"") pursuant to which, among other things, they have agreed to vote all of the shares held by them in favor of the Transaction at the Lucid Meeting, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Support Agreements. Additionally, it is a condition to closing of the Transaction that Lucid shareholders holding approximately 44% of the shares of Lucid, shall have entered into lock-up agreements with FSD Pharma pursuant to which: (a) 20% of the Consideration Shares received by each such locked-up shareholder will be exempt from any contractual transfer restrictions imposed by FSD Pharma; and (b) 80% of the Consideration Shares received by each such locked-up shareholder will be subject to contractual transfer restrictions, with such Consideration Shares to be released from such transfer restrictions over an 18 month period from the date of closing the Transaction. Completion of the Transaction is subject to various closing conditions, including: the approval of the Nasdaq and CSE, the approval of the boards of directors of FSD Pharma and Lucid, the approval of the security holders of Lucid, and completion of due diligence by the parties. Anthony Durkacz, a director and control person of the Company, is also a shareholder and warrant holder of Lucid, through a company he beneficially owns, and consequently the Transaction constitutes a ""related party transaction"" within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (""MI 61-101""). In its consideration and approval of the Transaction, the board of directors of the Company, with Mr. Durkacz recusing himself, determined that the Transaction will be exempt from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements of MI 61-101 on the basis of the exemptions in Sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101."
If you take into account the share price before that criminal reverse split this isn’t even worth one cent.
@Paulo Thanks for your concern. Why do you care about my life? I am doing great pumper. I see all Dirtkacz faces struggling and being concerned. AD why do you want so much to control Huge? It's the money isn't it? Or your arrogance? I believe both.
