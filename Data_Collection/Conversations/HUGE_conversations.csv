"Durkacz is now trying to play the savior role, Given his negative track record, he failed miserably. He was the guy who was in their ""friends"" ears telling them lies about what was about to transpire, big huge global deals, around the height of the share price. Yet not a single one of them came true. He pumped and dumped on the friends and acquaintances that trusted him. He got the money then: with PUMP he switched from extraction to delivery; with PUMP he switched from the largest indoor grow to bioscience and now to some new R&D technology. All these schemes are dust in the eye of investors to hide his real Ponzi schemes who line up his pockets. No return on shareholders money for the next two years or ever."
Great News for $HUGE! Onwards and Upwardshttps://seekingalpha.com/news/3741862-fsd-pharma-completes-acquisition-of-lucid-psycheceuticals
Doesn't get better than thishttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210921005755/en/FSD-Pharma-Announces-Closing-of-Lucid-Psycheceuticals-Acquisition
"Another interview by Anthony. Just interviews to settle his image and his reign. Nothing positive whatsoever for class B shareholders. Anthony ran the grow op into the ground, nothing more than a heavily promoted pump and dump that ultimately failed to hold any value after hype died and the failure to execute by Anthony and crew. Anthony got CEO after they appointed inept management just as he did with all his start-ups. Now he is about to get another cash up round and bums money from retail and other potential shareholders"
FSD Pharma enlisted the help of Capital Markets Communications Providers and Market Makers to improve its visibility in the market. This move will connect the company with investors and other market participants.
Ignore the haters = do you notice a pattern that they are trying hard as soon as they smell success? because they are short against the stock that's why they tell lies and make up stories because they doubt FSD will succeed and short ithttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210921005755/en/
"Shareholders simply want true value derived from hard work and results, enough promotion of what is intend to be done, do it. How can you expect to get anything accomplished when continually starting something then halfway through pulling the plug to chase the next great thing?"
"157,000 shareholders for $HUGE! That sure is a lot of them! Hopefully with recent/potential acquisitions they can make some real money! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1CSLboNVIM"
We’re sine
"FSD is just getting started in psychedelics with Lucid. With $45m cash on hand, can only imagine there will be more acquisitions coming!"
Mr. Durkacz uses those companies the way he pleases. Not sure that all his companies should be together. He probably wants to manage the money in his own interest. LOL
I’ve put $33.73 target on FSD. These fundamentals are amazing . Great management team !
This will never recover
https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210921005755/en/
Down goes the ship..... Again. Lol
"Interesting excerpts from SA article ::The LUCID 21-302 molecule for multiple sclerosis (MS) was developed over many years, by doctors, scientists and researchers at the University Health Network (“UHN”). UHN is the largest health research organization in North America. Lucid has exclusively licensed LUCID21-302 from the UHN which recently received patents for it. LUCID 21-302 represents an entirely new approach to MS.The global multiple sclerosis therapies market was estimated to be worth 23 billion dollars a year in 2018 and projected to increase to 28 billion by 2026. A brand new approach to MS could quickly grow in a market this big."
so this company has wasted billions on never finishing projects and has driven the stock to the ground. there have been more losers and executive winners here. FSD is doing what real estate scammers are doing in Bilize. They take your money on projects that's never going to get finished.
"The devil is in the details ::Lucid Psycheceuticals acquired by FSD Pharma is part of UHN. Lucid recently licensed novel compounds from UHN for the potential treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, and is also developing a psychedelics-class of compounds for mental health disorders. These add to the current anti-inflammatory pipeline under development at FSD. As we move forward, we will be adding complementary expertise to the Company’s team, as well as partnering with experienced organizations globally. We are laser focused on completing advanced preclinical studies and scale-up activities to successfully move FSD Pharma’s assets through the clinical trials. This transformative transaction is a mutually synergistic step toward addressing total brain health, and the Company’s team is excited at the new possibilities and therapeutics.”"
FSD is committed to its growth. They are involved in all aspects of a marketing campaign for the company. To reach new clients.
"Through the Lucid Psycheceuticals acquisition #FSDPharma is working to advance two unique drug candidates, LUCID-21-302, which targets the treatment of #MultipleSclerosis, and LUCID-201, aiming to treat #depression. Exciting times ahead for FSD Pharma!"
"@ Jordan Dirtkacz. With this inept permanent ""interim"" CEO you're right. We are all screwed all right"
So funny reading the shortsellers spew misinformation. FSD Pharma journey has a HUGE Reset happening right now.
"On this forum, it is a MUST to mention all efforts made by the management to underline some positive if they do whatever dream on. Nothing positive in CONTINOUS PUMPING. A new pumping face after another Austin, Jane, Sam. You call people names or whatever you desire if there is one single opinion against the interim CEO AD. This company is nothing more than a banker gambling at the expense of its shareholders. Pumpers on multiple chat boards. HERE New FAKE FACE for AD; JESS, DON, BOBBY AXELROD, OLEG, ARYA START, MATT, V, ROBIN, OLIVER. Last week each post comes up with 9 to ten thumbs up in two minutes' time. This week they changed the strategy, less instant thumbs up. Nice work to you AD. Nothing more to say, you embarrass yourself again."
"A unique strategy to treating neurodegenerative disorders called ""Total Brain Health"" will be applied by FSD Pharma through the acquisition of Lucid Pharmaceuticals, which will enter the medical psychedelics market. Although it is an early stage industry, the potential of psychedelic health care is growing, and the market is expected to reach 10.75 billion US dollars by 2027."
"Helloo PUMPERS! How is life, V, Nicky, Oliver, Saam, Oleg, Matt, and others? Why so many? The answer is simple: Durkacz, the arrogant hustler set up his PONZI schemes with HUGE, PUMP, and now in Europe with PWWR, and it is simple IF THERE IS NO PLAN and Durkacz appointed crooks there is no other way than to pump hard. Retail shareholders stay away. WIth Durkacz around is no future just lining his pockets in present."
When is bankruptcy?? Not today MF’ers to the moon moment coming . Congrats to all longs !!!!!
$HUGE is coming back stronger. Most undervalued psychedelic company currently on the US stock exchange.

@oliver this is the worst place ever I put my money
Durkacz track record for last 4 years is horrible. No return on any investment on startups. FSD today under Durkacz invests in R&D. No return on investment.
"I know what many people may be sceptical about FSD´s future, but with its new acquisition of Lucid Psychedelics, for a price of 11. 3 million, things will now get very interesting."
https://youtu.be/1pvs9M7mXnU
Get to know your CEO. https://youtu.be/QGcw50YomPY
@Compte. Oi you're THE NEWEST PUMPER EVER SEEN. ONE POST TODAY. Durkacz creates new pumpers names. HONEST INVESTORS STAY AWAY
Hello Jane! Did you invest 22 minutes ago and your first post here it is about the NEW R&D PROJECT that your Master Durkacz inept CEO put this company in? There is no money to finish such a project. For class B investors there is no hope to see some money back
"Anthony Durkacz, a director and control person of the Company, is also a shareholder and warrant holder of Lucid, through a company he beneficially owns. With the knowledge of Mr Durkacz performance history or lack thereof within the cannabis industry it will be interesting to see if shareholders of Lucid approve this transaction or if management have a strangle hold on voting as is such with HUGE/PUMP. Already put a black eye on the cannabis sector, now looking to kick the psychedelic sector in the teeth?"

Horrible stock. Samme people in top for four yeras asking for money and time . No plan. No return here.
@NN @NF @BK @verner Why is it that all you short seller accounts have only posted on the FSD pharma / $HUGE board and no where else. We all know you don't own any $HUGE stock for growth. But is this is the only stock you are short selling.
Another Green Day for $HUGE. Slow and steady wins the race!
"Thanks David Rosenburg for your advice. Dear new retail and all categories of investors; hear David here and go on Facebook to see Durkacz Pumping team at work how they cheer each other and plan of how better to do pump HUGE, PUMP stock. Anyway it will be for few years from now because even with Durkacz & Co. efficiency in lining up his own pockets 40 mil + assets represent a lot of money to drain."
Thumbs are unpredictable. Not much to say about Dirtkacz CEO abilities. He is inept
https://biotuesdays.com/2021/06/14/lucid-psycheceuticals-in-pact-with-uhn-to-develop-neurodegenerative-therapeutics
I think investing in the cannabis industry is a good bet. Estimates foresee that only in the United States it could move up to 30 billion in 2025.
Durkatz is not only a Jack #$%$ ; he?s also a very sly fox !!
"$HUGE is huger today than yesterday, and can be HUGER tomorrow than today."
"From the research I have done on Lucid this is what I found. Lucid will be doing a phased trial on its psychedelic molecule Lucid-201. Through this stand-alone compound Lucid plans to target conditions like Major Depressive Disorders, Psychiatric disorders and potentially Neurodegenerative disorders.Furthermore, the uniqueness of Lucid approach called the 'Total Brain Health' will be to eventually use psychedelics in conjunction with the application of proprietary molecules. Lucid will attempt to achieve this with its psychedelic therapies. The best comparison to Lucid in terms of a Psychedelic company comparison would be Compass Pathways. I'm definitely very hopeful with this development."

"@Juliette. For the brand new pumper image you created here, Dirtkacz you know very well that there is a lot of opportunities for real companies in the industry, BUT FOR FSD as long as you are there draining money for NONSENSE INVESTING ""OPORTUNITIES"". YOU'RE A ARROGANT INEPT PERSONA"
"@NN - ""Pumpin in weekend?"" Atleast Reza should hire some higher caliber demoters who can actually convey an intelligent sentiment versus just mindlessly spewing negative content out there that makes no sense. Same goes for your little clones @NF, @Verner etc. And what's with ""Oi?"""
"really funny , after Anthony won Gold proxy and tried to turn the company around , all the shortsellers started talking bad are they scared and smell success?"
"Lots of hate here , most likely short positions spreading rumours etc"
Being CEO and direct responsible of shareholder money is a privilege that is earned - not a right that is granted by Anthony Durkacz to Anthony Durkacz. You should be embarrassed of yourself. It is disgusting how you used everyone's trust. With this R&D new hopeless merger you put this company into grave.
"@Nicky You forgot about Anita. She is the new demoter. She is one of Raza Bokhari’s short seller clones who just reacted on comments but has now started to comment as well. Keep in mind all these accounts involved in Anthony & FSD defamation only comment on $HUGE and no where else. These are NOT real investors, just hired bashers."
"Why so many bashers and people complaining about HUGE, it looks like paid people. Who would spent that much time just complaining, if you don't like the stock just leave, let it go!! There are new investors who don't care about what happened a few years ago and see potential today. I like the Lucid deal and don't care what anybody thinks, did my DD. Please respect what other post"
How much have you lost when they went up from the last split?
Dividend announcement coming any day now !
Lucid Psycheceuticals focusing on Total Brain Healthhttps://biotuesdays.com/2021/08/17/lucid-psycheceuticals-focusing-on-total-brain-health/
"@oleg. Boyo, all I want is a return on my investment not to ""pioneer"" anything you cannot sell. You pumpers are all Durkacz. Arrogance and ego."
"I think FSD is committed to growth. Therefore, I consider keeping an eye on their new strategy. It is an engaging proposition."
FSD pharma will be great soon ! Expecting a dividend or forward split anyday
"@ Appopeeso. With all due respect the way I know Durkacz, Raza Bockhari had a deal with Durkacz and Saeed. The show in court ended up in a deal and Bokhari got all his rights and a part of the pie ( shareholders money). Raza Bockhari is always around. Everything is at shareholders money. The cost of all this show is many millions. Durkacz is a jerk. He doesn't have any moral compass, figure of speech of his hypocritical character. For this egomaniac and arrogant persona he can be CEO in bioscience and setup CEO in fuel cell. He is just a poor accountant that got on hype with cannabis and now false business investor banking = hustler"
"Problem is there have never been results. Rinse and repeat. Draw in new investors, bleed them dry and move on, while management and promoters are compensated."
Buyer beware. This company is run by scam artists. I am genuinely surprised they are not in jail. The literal definition of milking investors.

"Oliver, oleg, Robin, you're some of Dirtkacz faces. Shameless pumper."
@oliver. WHAT ARE YOU on this post?
At the beginning I hoped the profits from this stock would let me help my grandson go to college. Now it looks like he better get a job so he can lend me a few bucks. Total disappointment
Durkacz is desperate. His Ponzi scheme works just with continuous pumping and deceiving. It is obvious these pumpers/Clones are doing the job and keep real investors away. They pump too hard and push too hard to promote THE NOTHING DURKACZ CREATED.
"You seem to have your sights set on manipulation,there is a battle happening to confront global warming and human health as I am sure you are well aware,I think we need another battle confronting dishonesty, it being the motivation or more so the vector behind manipulation,I cannot see us solving global warming or any other major dilemma until we become enlightened to the importance of honesty. AD here is the most dishonest arrogant hustler I ever meet. All the best."
"Honestly, I have followed this stock for a long long time; fundamentals and growth are as solid as apple pie. Sure thing. Price will never go up. Steady down."
“Hi I’m calling for Oliver”
Down she goes again 
"I was on this stock a few years ago and I can tell you that in my opinion, this isn’t a real company but rather it’s a mechanism for the principals to extract as much money as possible from shareholders.This is what happens when a micro-cap stock has been flagrantly pumped to death with the claim of one day being the world's largest hydro premium cannabis producer during the height of FOMO in the cannabis sector. Back to pumping the balance sheet, further dilution via acquisition, and more heavy-handed promotions. I pray the universe takes a world-class dump on the management of this company and everything they are involved with!"
"@ DIRTKACZ THE HUSTLER, Jordan and Larry. Oi pumpers you're desperate. Nobody trust you anymore."
Lucid's website has some great info on their pipeline and their mission :: Psychedelics-inspired company focusing on “Total Brain Health”Lucid Psycheceuticals (Lucid) has two active pipelines under development::Mental Health DisordersNeurodegenerative Disorders
"Spending almost 2million a year on promotion, pumpers on multiple chat boards, YouTube pod cast interviews, and other promotional outlets. Why not allocate that money to further clinical trials, R&D and other such activities that work to bring true shareholder value. Instead of spending that money on pumping what you intend to do, how about working hard execute and then promote what you have accomplished instead of continually wasting time and money looking for handouts from retail."
@ george. It is right. No earnings. Durkacz brand is deceiving and always has no plan but excuses and a lot of pumping. The value will be always in his and his friend's pockets. They need just time to squeeze to the last dime. lol
"We all know mental illness is one of the worst health crisis in the world, growing research in the field of psychedelics has shown promsiing results. FSD's investment in this sector will bring a large growth in the coming years within this multi billion dollar market."
"Finally FSD Pharma closed something solid, OLD CEO Raza Bokhari is tone deaf and doesn't know how to sell the image of the company made bad strategic moves. Going forward UHN and LUCID and FSD Pharma are here to stay. Good luck to everyone"
"Just take a step back and take a look at what is going on....cannabis and biotech companies all reporting incredible ERs with tremendous growth WITH very positive guidance going forward. Manufactures all reporting beats with significant growth and constantly guiding upwards with positive outlooks going forward. Other manufacturers will likely report similar strong ER's this week. Extraction equipment companies (destroyed earnings) are and will likely continue reporting even more significant earnings and growth due to unprecedented demand. The biotech industry is looking outstanding right now and has an even brighter future. ER's are reflecting this nicely. I'm severely bullish on this company right now and many of the stocks, particularly FRCC stocks that are just stopped or going down. This Durkacz should go and try politics. Their people make promises and do not care about; remember just once in four years they have to cash out at elections."
$HUGE and LUCID the next MMED and CMPS
"This isn’t going anywhere, patience and game is over on investment."
"@ Austin Dirtkacz. Oi master of pumping and failure. This shifty face has just 2 posts. Durkacz you're desperate. By the way Oliver, where's the rocket?"
With the rest of the psychedelic sector taking a nose dive. I’ll take the 0.5% dip with $HUGE any-day.
did anyone received payment from settlement?
"11 down votes. All Walters accounts. Lol anyways, it fun to come here and poke the bears…. Very sensitive bunch since the Lucid acquisition. Can’t wait until this hits double digits."
"Mr. Durkacz, Sir. Nobody's perfect. If you really want he best of FSD or WCE just step up and speak what is in your mind. Not nonsenses and useless videos. strait from you if you got something good inside. Best to reinsure investors. lol"
"Despite its past, FSD is making the right moves to move forward in the right direction wth the acquisition of Lucid (Not to be confused with Lucid Motors) a Canadian-based specialty psychedelic pharmaceutical company focused on the development of therapies to treat critical neurodegenerative diseases."
@Daniel. You're the fourth NEW PUMPER TODAY with one post. Same old Durkacz pumping scheme.
@William. You're the third new PUMPER with only one post here who announce last Durkacz R&D project that cost 9 mil. Same question to you When we can expect return on investment?
"The time will come. Patience for another 4 years with one ""concerned"" CEO"
"Dr. Kotra commented, “Energized by the tremendous opportunity that the combination of the two companies represents, I am thrilled to join the FSD Pharma team at this pivotal time as it works to accelerate the development of a robust pipeline of innovative treatments that address significant unmet needs in neurodegenerative and mental health disorders.

"Equity guru: Is FSD Pharma getting into psychedelics to avoid being delisted from the nasdaq?The company filed an Investigational IND with the FDA in August 2020 and was given the green light just a month later to initiate a phase 2 clinical trial for the use of FSD201 to treat COVID-19. But last month announced they were terminating the study. Another L for FSD Pharma. Can we please change this company’s name to SMDH Pharma. They were cannabis, then they were Covid, now they are psychedelics. They can’t seem to make up their mind, it all feels pretty random and fly by night. They also seem to burn their bridges after each phase instead of integrating a series of different verticals under one rooftop kind of like Revive (RVV.C) did. It’s been a bizarre strategy and the company’s share price has been nothing more than a flatline with the occasional blip for years now. Whatever trend comes after psychedelics I wouldn’t surprised to see another pivot, CEO, rollback, etc."
@ William and Don. Dirtkacz always reset the past and give himself chances. This is always on shareholder expense. Dirtkacz you're embarrassing yourself continously. Lol
"@NF, @NN maybe you should post during market hours and not offshore hours? You paid outsourced stock bashers you!"
"Why is it that the pumpers here have very little posting history and continually change names?Remember to divide current sp by 201, you know to account for one of the largest RS's on record. Sp in reality currently resides under a penny.Anthony Durkacz say ""I am not a robot"" and don't forget to check the box please."
Price should be above $2.01 so you don’t feel too bad for that 201 RF investment.
@ Pratik. Random accountant cannot be CEO in bioscience but Durkacz can. His arrogance and ego cover everything and doesn't matter the results for shareholders. All that matter to him is to stay on top of the rest of the money for his and his friends benefit.

@oliver You're right Durkacz the hustler.There are four tears since you and your friends chop shareholders money with Huge and Pump. Now you started another failure in fuel cell in Europe; PWWR. Another inept management team; amateurs who faced the court of law more often than a laboratory. Once again your moral compass is missing and you lurch in human swamp.
"Oi Larry, John, Arianna, Jesse, Robin and the other Dirtkacz the Hustler pumpers. Gentleman, because you are only one person here, with all due respect even if you do not deserve it, YOU ARE REDUNDANT! You are stalling as usual and pumping Durkacz to get your next money. You'll a disease on this penny market."
"How come? Now interview today, Durkacz if you do not do any you will improve your image. People start to think you have some decency. LOL"
"On this forum people can be trolls, bashers, shorter, looser, etc. if they are critical and ask return on investment after 4 years. Callers ask for a fourth or fifth chance to AD to do what? there is no strategy to get some money back in short, medium term. Just hope and need of more money to finalize some poetical projects. Why is that? there is no strategy at all."
"Thanks to the lucid acquisition, stock price for FSD has seen a very slight increase. This could be the start of a new beginning for FSD."
"Interesting, see what pops up when you Google: Goyal vs FSD Pharma."
"Seeking Alpha on FSD Pharma ::""So HUGE is not a “cannabis” company, it was and remains a bioscience company with a portfolio of assets designed to take advantage of the rapid advances in the pharmaceutical use of canniboids. Plus, because of its exposure to the medical potential of cannabis derivatives, HUGE has also gained exposure to the emerging therapeutic psychedelics world. The combination of cannabis and psychedelics puts HUGE at the forefront of two frontiers in medicine.HUGE has one other big advantage: throughout the cannabis market collapse it has managed to hang onto its very full treasury. As of June 30, 2021 it had $43.2 million USD in the bank. This means the company can afford to execute on its new plans."""
"FSD Pharma is the only psychedelic company on a US stock exchange, currently valued at around $50mill. All other psychedelic companies on US stock exchanges are currently valued upwards of $500M. There is HUGE 10x opportunity here."

Nice recovery plan for Durkacz and FRCC."
"The Devil is in the details:Could AD have possibly chosen Lucid in part due to his self interest already being a shareholder and warrant holder of Lucid? Lucid Transaction Details: The Transaction will be effected by way of a three-cornered amalgamation between Lucid, FSD Pharma and a wholly-owned subsidiary of FSD Pharma. The Transaction will involve the issuance of approximately 4.5 million Class B subordinate voting shares in the capital of FSD Pharma (each, an ""FSD Share"") as the acquisition consideration (the ""Consideration Shares""), with a deemed aggregate purchase price of approximately US$9 million (CAD$11.3 million based on an exchange rate of US$1 to CAD$1.255) at a deemed price of US$2.00 (CAD$2.51) per FSD Share. The Consideration Shares may be adjusted slightly in the event the market price of the FSD Shares changes significantly prior to closing of the Transaction. Additionally, all of the outstanding Lucid stock options and warrants will become exercisable into FSD Shares, with the number and exercise price of such securities to be adjusted in accordance with the Transactions exchange ratio. The closing of the Transaction is subject to customary closing conditions for a transaction of this nature including, among other things, Lucid obtaining the requisite shareholder approval at a special meeting of Lucid shareholders to be called to consider the Transaction (the ""Lucid Meeting""). The closing of the Transaction is expected to occur in September 2021. The Transaction will require approval by 66 2/3% of the votes cast by Lucid shareholders at the Lucid Meeting. Lucid shareholders holding at least 66 2/3% of the shares of Lucid, have entered into support agreements with FSD Pharma (the ""Support Agreements"") pursuant to which, among other things, they have agreed to vote all of the shares held by them in favor of the Transaction at the Lucid Meeting, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Support Agreements. Additionally, it is a condition to closing of the Transaction that Lucid shareholders holding approximately 44% of the shares of Lucid, shall have entered into lock-up agreements with FSD Pharma pursuant to which: (a) 20% of the Consideration Shares received by each such locked-up shareholder will be exempt from any contractual transfer restrictions imposed by FSD Pharma; and (b) 80% of the Consideration Shares received by each such locked-up shareholder will be subject to contractual transfer restrictions, with such Consideration Shares to be released from such transfer restrictions over an 18 month period from the date of closing the Transaction. Completion of the Transaction is subject to various closing conditions, including: the approval of the Nasdaq and CSE, the approval of the boards of directors of FSD Pharma and Lucid, the approval of the security holders of Lucid, and completion of due diligence by the parties. Anthony Durkacz, a director and control person of the Company, is also a shareholder and warrant holder of Lucid, through a company he beneficially owns, and consequently the Transaction constitutes a ""related party transaction"" within the meaning of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 - Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (""MI 61-101""). In its consideration and approval of the Transaction, the board of directors of the Company, with Mr. Durkacz recusing himself, determined that the Transaction will be exempt from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements of MI 61-101 on the basis of the exemptions in Sections 5.5(a) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101."

I can smell another acquisition coming. They certainly have the money

When is the next split??
FSD Pharma Inc. has entered a definitive agreement to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares Lucid Psycheceuticals Inc. for approximately US$9 million. They will be able to expand their commercial market through the position of said company. Wich makes them an attractive option for investment.
@V. V what's going on Dirtkacz? This is negative pumping. What's wrong? Did you have some of those psychedelic medicine or probably just the usual daily stuff.
"Durkacz is an accountant and he cannot fill a bioscience company CEO shoe. This is what happens when a micro-cap stock has been flagrantly pumped to death with the claim of one day being the world's largest hydro premium cannabis producer during the height of promo in the cannabis sector. Back to pumping the balance sheet, further dilution via acquisition, and more heavy-handed promotions. Look at the dates of the last few news releases you can sorta estimate if things are going to pick up soon based on how they do promo etc. the number one thing a company needs are proper exposure and a clear way to explain the business model to potential investors retail investors along with institutional investors are what drive stock prices up. Instead they invest in R&D programs. THis means no return on investment at all."

FSD today become a political stage for a few individuals that want just to keep control; Anthony Durkacz and Zeeshan Saeed. Raza bockhari is still around. We cannot make money here.
@ Pierre Did you invested in HUGE 10 minutes ago and then you are concerned with your first post? For sure this forum is pumped like hell. LOL
"Pretty tired of all the naysayers, bashers and short sellers in this board. Clearly nothing FSD can do to convince these short-sellers, their only goal is for this stock to tank so they can capitalize from this. Investors, do your own diligence. In my personal opinion, LUCID acquisition is a game changer for FSD pharma, and gives it great exposure to the growing psychedelic market."
Nasdaq had the worst day since March and when you look at all of the time and effort wasted by shorts on this board just for the stock to close greenCan’t wait until lucid updates!
"@Sam. You PUMPER cannot tell anyone when, how or what to post here. You Durkacz are arrogant. You should know that being a leader (as you pretend) isn't about who's willing to take it the furthest or chosen the right path, it's about how far is too far and choosing to stop."
"Anthony Durkacz, in my opinion, you deserve an Oskar award for your worthless video presentations on whatever paid sites on the net you performed during last four years. How much cost each of your worthless apparitions? You have no plan and what you do is you continue to your Ponzi scheme started with Raza and Saeed 4 years ago; you finance dead-end projects COVID 19 or R&D, etc. in order to stay there long enough to drain all the money from FSD. I am so happy I am not the only one who has seen you're a big ZERO in whatever you start. I was so stupid to trust you. Shame on me."
Just give up huge no one is trusting this scam no more.
"Perhaps those who have been involved since the IPO or even pre IPO and would like to see the seemingly endless cycle and destruction of retail shareholder value under ANY form of a management cease in all companies under the direct supervision and involvement of one Mr Durkacz. ""New"" chance? No, same OLD chance looking for NEW $ and yet another chance. Recent filings show Anthony and crew have rewarded themselves yet again, and for what exactly? Every time they have rewarded themselves when the price slips they always seem to award themselves more. Retail shareholders don't have that luxury as they are required to invest more of their own capital in order to cost average down whereas management continually grants and awards themselves more FREEBIES."
"I love the slow and steady climb for FSD! A hidden gem that is, nice cash flow for Mr. Durkacz, Mr. Saeed, and Mr. Bockhari. Very comfortably adding to my position, B shareholder, on every red day. I think $0.9, not more by year-end is a realistic outlook here. By next year the funds of 40 mils will be more than half gone. Top management will have a nice life for the next two to three years, is not life wonderful?"
When's bankruptcy? My 98% loss looks good but not 100% good. Biggest scam in the market.
@Austin. You're the newest pumper.
FSD and AURORA both amazing companies! Both are lining up for a dividend!
This failure is Durkacz & co cash out for next years. There are still 50 mil to be drained to their own accounts.
Sometimes you have to lose in order to win in the future. FSD is not giving up the fight.
"Nice to see Walter here. But, wrong stock kiddo. This is far out your control or area of expertise. Stick to ruining the $HUGE board lolWhen TRIP IPO’d Walter got on all of his accounts and littered the $TRIP board for about 4-5 days steady until his comments just sort of drifted with the wind LOL"
"Just interviews and hopeless projects within domains that requires 250 to 500 mil. This is the way to ask for more money and to settle his image and his reign. Nothing positive whatsoever for class B shareholders. Anthony ran the grow op into the ground, nothing more than a heavily promoted pump and dump that ultimately failed to hold any value after hype died and the failure to execute by Anthony and crew. Anthony got CEO after they appointed inept management just as he did with all his start-ups. Now he is about to get another cash up round and bums money from retail and other potential shareholders."
"FSD has 150,000 retail shareholders. We are not going to let a handful of short sellers drag this stock down."
https://biotuesdays.com/2021/08/17/lucid-psycheceuticals-focusing-on-total-brain-health
Nasdaq-listed FSD Pharma To Advance Psychedelics Pipeline With $9 Million Acquisition Of Lucid Psycheceuticals. Good move if they can stick to this and make it work!
"Having personal experience with mental health issues, psychedelics will be a welcome form of treatment. Companies such as FSD are determined to brigh about meaningful treatments."
"New clones today: Brylle, Sean, Tristan, Paul. Durkacz is desperate. Nothing is going on here other than PUMPING."
@ Matt Dirtkacz. For sure this is the only stock on US stock exchange because is R&D you idiot. You define by yourself that there is no return on investors money before 2025 IF DURKACZ THE HUSTLER DOESN'T DRAIN THE MONEY. As I know him he is an looter. NO HOPE CLONE
AD himself is the primary lab rat for LUCID ; He is so far gone that they wanted to do studies of his brain now and compare it to the future studies when he donates his brain to science so as to try and figure out what madness makes this guy tick?
Hello Oliver
FSD refused to surrender and is well positioned to pursue acquisitions in the psychedelics and biotech markets. This could be its way back into the spot light.
I think investing in psychedelic research can be part of new financial avenues. We probably have to see how companies like FSD react.
That 5 day chart looks amazing! Up 13%. Gives us an insight on what’s to come this year!
Also probable that we get a dividend announcement!! Don’t sell
"@ Hello Jane & Juliette Dirtkacz. New PUMPING FACES for the arrogant mushroom forever interim CEO. Same habits , pumping, pumping to hell"
@ Jordan you do not get any return on shareholders money with research projects. This is another idiotic plan coming from Durkacz stalling strategy.
"Another red day in psychedelics. All my holdings $MMED, $CYBN, $HUGE, $CMPS and $FTRP are in the red today.  I believe in the medicine. HODL."
"@ oleg. Dear Sir Mr. Oleg or maybe... V, Nicky, Sam, Matt, thank you for let me know. I probably misspelled ""company"" but in fact I was right. 95% of the startup companies promoted by FRCC aka Anthony Durkacz are P&D or failures or simply built to give people like you to pump hard and make a buck. How do you sleep by night? Thanks again."
FSD Pharma has completed acquisitions of Lucid Psycheceuticals Inc. Thanks to this strategy the company will achieve its goal of developing a strong healthcare platform aimed at enhancing mental wellness.
"Choppa, Matt, V and the other Clones and Dirtcacz SERVANTS. Be more efficient otherwise"
Know one will ever trust huge again
"Today show up some ""big time"" help for Durkacz the hustler. Small-time pumpers are usually complaining and annoying with no opinion just STERILE PUMPING. Oi, big-time sharks here PLEASE TELL DUKACZ THAT HE IS AN IDIOT that he invested in UHN which is a big hospital organization that does research. Two times FSD money today is not enough to finish some project and do sell something to make some positive for class B shareholders."

$HUGE value play here. Almost $45M in assets. No debt. $60M market cap. This is a no brainer.
never gain trust no more
"So damn tired of the clearly paid naysayers and shortsellers on here! FSD Pharma’s recently appointed management team is genuinely trying to lead an organizational shift and strategically positioning the company to pursue growth and sustainable value for all stakeholders. Through its acquisition of Lucid, FSD is pioneering a new treatment approach for mental health and neurodegenerative diseases, pairing a novel family of myelin restoring molecules with psychedelic/cannabis focused therapies. It doesn't get better than that. Give it time and I think we'll see some real results here!"

"Isn't it strange that all of these pumpers suddenly show up right while the company is undertaking yet another promotional campaign? They spoon feed the information they want potential investors to have and tell them to ignore anyone who shines light on any of their questionable practices. Short interest is 3% of float, share price is a reflection of the management and it's inability to execute over the years blaming shorts is laughable here."
@ Barren Wuffett. New Dirtkacz face but built in two days and 15 posts. Dirtkacz the CHIEF PUMPER this is what you learned from last 2 mil investment? You don't care. Not your money. Sorry shareholders money.
This company is nothing more than a banker gambling at the expense of it's shareholders imo.
"Sooner than later Durkacz, is coming your time to pay for your scam and Ponzi scheme. Pay back's a beatch...https://ca.yahoo.com/news/netflix-hbo-scammer-arrested-feds-163731934.html"
"The recent 4 years' big no profits were due to Raza + Durkacz + Saeed covid failure tests and no real plan.So profits were never around,and the share price will probably fall lower investing in R&D for the next two years, but once it settles and the bank account will be empty this will be a great investment."
Message to SHAREHOLDERS. Larry post 18 times today!?!?!? Why? Is Durkacz a PUMPER ? It is evident YES. Can he be trusted? NO. Just excuses and false hope.
Lucid acquisition is leading molecules designed to focus on treatment for neurodegenerative and mental health disorders in a unique manner.
Hello Mat the pumper. Where you go on that rocket? Because FSD is really in deep wormhole.
@oliver. Dukacz you FINALLY got interim CEO FOREVER and you never did anything good for any of your startup companies. You just spent shareholders money with no result or return on investment.
"FSD Pharma has completed acquisitions of Lucid Psycheceuticals Inc, acquiring shares in FSD Pharma for approximately US$11.3 million. This provides the company with new assets that are at the forefront of new medicines."
"Durkacz is the schmuck who set this up. It's not the efficiency of the structure that's in question, it's the absence of clean and clear business practices. This company's business practices are diverted to the good of a few people; Durkacz, Saeed, Raza, and FRCC acolits."
@oliver if bathers are pumping negativity. You master pumper are pumping money strait to your own pockets and FRCC. Isn't it Durkacz?
"Why is it that the pumpers here have very little posting history and continually change names? Just today: William, Juliette, and Jane with just one post each. Durkacz you embarrass yourself again. You spend again 9 mil of shareholders money on HO HOPE R&D PROJECT. Just a Ponzi scheme."
I have been following FSD's management news and I believe that it is leading an organizational shift and is positioning the company to pursue growth and sustainable value for all stakeholders. This could be huge in the next year or so.
"@ Paolo Nobody likes you here brother, your comments without fundamentals. You're spending time talking about people who are trying to diminish a stock that never performed in the past 4 years. This was anyway better than you will ever perform in anything in your life. I know what you are doing and trust me is not worth it, whatever they are paying you which I guess is very little, it is not worth spending your day and your life like that. You are not creating any value, pumping. I don't mind people not liking Durkacz. In your case, it is just difficult to try to make someone like you understand.Go and buy some cand, go to a park, don't mess here with your childish behavior. Grow up and do something good with your life."
"The $45 mil is used to lure investors in, they've had it on the balance sheet for years. Then once in they continue to hold the cash and dilute shareholders and expect them to be greatful for it as if they are doing shareholders a favor. This company leverages it's risk at the expense of it's shareholders imo."
@oliver Durkacz and Saeed keep FSD changing for 4 years. I understand from you that changes take time; how long sir? another 4 years? Durkacz will run out of money ... because credibility is gone
"I was on this stock a few years ago and I can tell you that in my opinion, this isn’t a real company but rather it’s a mechanism for the principals to extract as much money as possible from shareholders. There is no real strategy to return on investment. I see people here asking for money and Daniel your advice to loose before you win is redundant here, People including myself lost money here. What is FSD fighting? His CEO or what?"
AD pumping the balance sheet fishing for new investors yet again with more promotional videos and articles.
"Hello PUMPERS or MAMA CLONE and MAIN PUMPER = ANTHONY DORKACZ. How it's life other than pumping? You don't have one, I am pretty sure, why? BECAUSE YOU ARE DESPERATE AND REDUNDANT. No worries we will be always around for HUGE, PUMP and....THE nEW FACKUP PWWR."
big scam im from Toronto Canada and beed watching the scam sene 2018 say away thank me later

AD the dilution pumper king at it yet again with another round of paid promotion and another acquisition at the expense of shareholders via more dilution all while trying to spin facts and portray himself as some sort of savior.

"@ Jesse There is the same management as it was in 2017. Durkacz replaced Thomas, Sara and Raza. Now Durkacz the king of hustling got finally CEO and use shareholders money irresponsibly."
Pay close attention. Per credible sources (twitter) likely another merger with a psychedelic company primed to take off soon. $3+ next
"You know what keeps Anthony up at night? The fear of this company trading under a buck, recieving non compliance letter and being placed back on the pinks where it belongs. Same pumpers pumped past acquisitions and attempted acquisitions as well. 17.5 mil for Prismic for bio pump now lucid, 9 mil for psychedelic pump. Anthony desperately trying to buy his way out of this mess, let's see if this is yet another case of Anthony throwing good money after bad yet again."

"Durkacz got new faces in pumping; Bobby, Neil, Sam, etc. Cheap money for you Durkacz."
"I love the slow and steady climb for FSD! A hidden gem that is, nice cash flow for Mr. Durkacz, Mr. Saeed and Mr. Bockhari. Very comfortably adding to my position, B shareholder, on every red day. I think $0.3, not more by year-end is a realistic outlook here. By next year the founds of 40 mil will be more than half gone. Top management will have a nice life for the next two to three years, It is not the life wonderful?"
@stufflebwwm. You're a baby new pump face. Just two posts. Same old tactic ....
"By the year 2025, the global legal cannabis market is anticipated to be worth $66.3 billion, which includes both recreational and medical use. Looking at these figures we can notice that FSD's strategy, through the acquisition of Lucid, is a good move."
Buy it ! This could go to $50/share tomorrow !
"@ Austin Dirtkacz. New face with just three posts, clone and pumping hard as usual. Durkacz you're an arrogant hustler using shameless and irresponsible the shareholders money."
"Nothing says ""red flag"" like a board full of spamming pumpers who have limited posts and constantly change accounts and or names. What's with the spamming? You can post multiple times on your original post to avoid spamming the board, it's almost like someone is trying to intentionally hide something or perhaps they are paid per post. This board and company reeks of deception."
"What happened to the honest, fair, truthful, without malice, without ulterior motives, Frank, benevolent, sacrificing, level-headed, sound advising, equitable people? Why is everyone giving wrong advice? Why the nefarious designs and ulterior motives and self-interest and indulgence? So you need examples. One person tried to run Apple down but did not succeed and ended up tendering an apology! Another person tried to run Nvidia down but Nvidia almost or will triple. So what goes my sweet friends? What goes my brothers and sisters? What is happening here with people posting the five times same phrase or same rochet? After posting so many times this becomes nonsense like Durkacz CEO for FSD in bioscience."
Look at the dates of the last few news releases you can sorta estimate if things are going to pick up soon based on how they do promo etc. the number one thing a company needs are proper exposure and a clear way to explain the business model to potential investors retail investors along with institutional investors are what drive stock prices up. FSD today become a political stage for a few individuals that want just to keep control; Anthony Durkacz and Zeeshan Saeed. Raza Bockhari is still around. We cannot make money here. Another Durkacz wreck

"The rise is due to the heavy promotion campaign they are currently undertaking. It will take impeccable management and real results due to their execution in order to attain true value, this rise is once again due to promotion not results.

"$HUGE has 150,000 retail investors. All these nay sayers trash talkers on here are not one of them. They are all hired by short sellers to post negative comments on this board. If they were actual current share holders they would not be trash talking when a company is making progress. A real share holder knows trash talk will not help his / her share price. Share holders beware. HUGE is finally turning things around, patience pay. The share price will increase after these acquisitions. Decide to SELL or HODL after the increase."
FSD is the best stock in the Market. I added 20k shares today!
Reverse splits are good and healthy. They raise the stock price ! Who wouldn’t want that ?
Look at that 4% jump pre-market. Nice! Going to be another green day today!
"The problem with PUMP is there is no plan and have never been results. Nonsense projects stopped and repeat. Draw in new investors, bleed them dry and move on, while management and promoters are compensated. This company is nothing more than a banker gambling at the expense of its shareholders."

Don’t forget 201/1 split they are going nowhere

This could be a game changer for $HUGE if done right."
"Durkacz is blinded by arrogance and his narcissistic ego. He appointed Raza Bockhari, he appointed Rosy Mondin and JJ Chamberland. Few days back he made the worst decision for FSD; give money to RESEARCH PROJECTS. There is NO HOPE TO GET ANY RETURN. Anybody from street can make a better decision here."
NO earnings lol terrible company
"If Raza was still CEO, no project would be brought to completion, At-least the founders are doing what they have committed to do. They said they will investigate and fire Raza, review the feasibility on COVID trials, end it if not feasible, start acquisitions of psychedelic companies and biotech plays. They have done all 3. Hopefully they will execute on them and bring them to completion unlike Raza."

$HUGE to the moon
@V Hey Durkacz pumper face! Dirtkacz is the best spending shareholders money uselessly. For four years since he got lucky with cannabis shareholders money he simply sink everything. Same case here so far and with his last R&D project there is no hope for future. Real investors get to something that make sense.
"Loved to post here. AD is the master of manipulation,There are many battles happening today I am sure you are well aware,I think we need another battle confronting dishonesty, it being the motivation or more so the vector behind manipulation,I cannot see us solving global warming or any other major dilemma until we become enlightened to the importance of honesty. AD here is the most dishonest arrogant hustler I ever meet. All the best."
Durkacz a.k.a. Oliver you're awesome in your despair. Your aliases posting for five times at the time show your true pumping colors to retail investors. You should buy more shares as you did during last five minutes of the market opening yesterday. Did you save the day You're? No sir. You're inept and a disgrace. You embarrassed yourself in front of friends and family. Arrogance is not good. Learn how to be humble. There is always a price to pay.
"Nothing makes sense here for years. Endless projects, no goals, no specifics, no plan. Shareholder's money spent on lawsuit without any goal. People around, probably clones pumpers and people that lost continously money with Durkacz, Saeed and Bockhari. No hope whatsoever."
"No share holder even with a penny’s worth of stock in a company, no matter how bad it’s doing will try to bash a company with false misleading info like @walterwhite @NF, @NN and @verner.

Ignore the stock bashers
Ignore the haters FSD Pharma is doing brand new things now with solid management behind the helm. FSD Pharma and LUCID is very promising to grow shareholder value wait and see
"This company is nothing more than a banker gambling at the expense of its shareholders. Pumpers on multiple chat boards. HERE New FAKE FACE for AD; JESS, DON, BOBBY AXELROD, OLEG, ARYA START, MATT, V, ROBIN, OLIVER. Each post comes up with 9 to ten thumbs up in two minutes' time. Nice work to you AD. Nothing more to say, you embarrass yourself again."
@oleg. This Lucid is another of Durkacz tricks and endless projects. This kind of development requires 100 to 500 mil . Another way to divert attention from funnel founds
Here we go!!! 5% jump in the first hour.
$HUGE and LUCID the next MMED and CMPS Check it out guys
"Psychedelics development requires money in excess of 100 mil, strong management and a skilled team in order to get results fast. Durkacz burned 40 mil. with WCE without having any working prototype for cannabis or hemp oil extraction. They ended today doing delivery after acquiring another company. With FSD this is the fourth attempt to do.....""R&D"". Durkacz lost credibility in front of shareholders. For how long is this interim CEO ?!?!?"
"Why is it that the pumpers here have very little posting history and continually change names?Remember to divide current sp by 201, you know to account for one of the largest RS's on record. Sp currently resides under a penny.Say ""I am not a robot"" and don't forget to check the box please."
Lucid brings an Exclusive world wide patent to a family of network from UHN to FSD pharma. UHN - University Health Network is the largest health research organization in North America.
A.D.
"Saying ""Make FSD great again"" or ""Restore FSD Pharma"" is laughable. Restore it to what? And it was never great to begin with. FSD Pharma is known for breaking volume records on the exchange due to capitalizing on hype and heavy-handed promotion for which they were warned. That's it, nothing more. Who was in charge when investors were misled about the world's largest hydro build out? Anthony constantly placing blame and pointing his finger elsewhere will only go so far. Investors want a full investigation into this company and ALL management involved. Some are under the impression incoming management is new, not so. The so called ""New"" management is actually the old management pre Raza which is comprised of individuals responsible for the world's largest hydro facility promotional P&D and the appointment of Bokhari."
Bad management. Here comes another rs 201/1 don’t worry I’m sitting at 58 bucks free cash. But looks like death now.

$HUGE $2 Break coming soon IMO
"The recent rise is people waking up to the magnitude of the recent Lucid acquisition. Walters just been a salty short for years on multiple accounts. Once lucid trials get underway , FSD who has more than enough cash, will simply provide the capital. Good…no, GREAT times ahead :)"
@oliver. Oi Dirtkacz! This is how you call people that lost money with your P&D schemes? Basher shirtseller trolls. What are you? Because they way act seems to be irresponsible or you have a plan to drain everything within next three years. Any you beat your record. All you startups are down.
With access to cash why would management choose to continually diute shareholders? If management were confident in past and present aquasitions and their ability to execute then there's no need to continually do so. Balance sheet has been used to lure in retail investors over the years imo.
@seth Thank you for your insightful message. The lemon you show is the image of WCE and FSD bank accounts that Dutkacz the hustler and FRCC drain the money for they personal use. Lol
"It's time to give FSD Pharma a second chance, its new strategy aims to pay off."
"Finally Competant management at FSD Pharma , AD is working 24/7 to grow the company , if you don't like it feel free to short it"
"Good morning Pumpers aka Lisa, Keith, Johnny, Robin, Jesse, Peter, Seth, etc. Mama clone Dirtkacz you're a terrible actor. Retail investors can see what it is all about with this OLD MANAGEMENT here. Durkacz, after appointed and removed Thomas, Sara, Raza finally appointed himself interim CEO permanently. All these nonsense changes , unfinished projects and lack of vision to reach return on investment for 4 years proves Durkacz personal and only personal interest in FSD money management. NO HOPE TO GET ANY RETURN ON SHAREHOLDER INVESTMENT HERE"
@NN - How much is your going rate you paid stock basher?
Bad day for the short sellers / stock bashers on this group today huh.
Just came in the check on the pumpers who got their bags depleted by this tragedy of a company. SELL YOUR SHARES!
@ simon Your empty head ....
They had some interesting insights about HUGE on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Durkacz now is your turn https://ca.news.yahoo.com/u-authorities-freeze-assets-charge-161656082.html
"Durkacz has total control over the shareholder's money of this company, his arrogance and ego should come with a price."

Looks like FSD is ready for a breakout. Been green consistently for the past week!
Later today on Sunday (15:00 east time) usually will start DURKACZ PUMPING PROGRAM to be ready for Monday morning TO FACE EVENTUAL NEW INVESTORS.

huge mistake
We are DOOMED with this AD M O R O N S K Y dude !
"@ Oliver Durkacz Simply...who wanted to buy the ""discounted"" offered today with the $R&D new acquisition of yours. So there is a place for a management change to have a PUMP rise...And to all pumpers & clone colleagues ... the money you obtained three years ago is ""for a reason"".. and the newly nominated CEO is ""for a reason""... we can expect something reasonably huuuuuge cash out for AD&FRCC... and rather soon...Real investing is a Las Vegas Casino instead FSD."
@ Austin Dirtkacz New face with only one post. YOU'RE DESPERATE. YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ELSE THAN PUMPING
"AD the dilution pumper king at it yet again with another round of paid promotion and another acquisition at the expense of shareholders via more dilution all while trying to spin facts and portray himself as some sort of savior. With a balance sheet showing plenty of cash on hand, why would they choose to dilute shareholders yet again?"
Choppa. Oi clone. You have the same profile as oliver. lol
Ignore the pumpers
"Now with Durkatz the Derk, your trip to the moon is more like this;"
"@NN You are clearly not vested in this stock for its growth, otherwise why else would you hate on it day in and day out. You are one of the many shortsellers bombarding this page with negative comments or you are all the same people posting negative comments through different accounts. Your only purpose is for this stock to go down so you can profit from your short position. You do not want this stock to grow or the company to prosper. Sad."

@ oliver Brother you're so redundant.
"FSD Pharma, Developing Treatments for Mental Health Disordershttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h62zhPH_dNs"
"No significant news. Nothing Since Durkacz and Saeed got “back” ?!?!?! the company. Who was it that appointed Bokhari again? Some are under the impression incoming management is new, not so. The so-called ""New"" management is actually the old management pre-Raza which is comprised of individuals responsible for the world's largest hydro facility promotional P&D and the appointment of Bokhari."
@Julitte. This is your second post. When did you invest with FSD? Or you're another pumper announcing Durkacz dreaming R&D plans? When is first return on investment?
"Dear pumpers and especially the Master Pumper Mr. A. Durkacz. What did you announce? A bright future for FSD and shareholders after your deal with Lucid? What kind of structure has Lucid today? Johny, your pumping face announced that Lucid is hiring: Join us | Neurosciences | Neurobehavioral sciences | Lucid Psycheceuticals Inc. | TorontoIf they hire all the below positions Means they did not have too much. Once again Durkacz you cannot achieve a project. Don’t be sad you never achieved anything. • Process Chemist (ideally experience in process chemistry, GLP/GMP) – 1 position • Scientist/Senior Scientist (neurodegenerative disorders, preferred background in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease, preclinical/clinical) – 1 position • Scientist/Senior Scientist (Mental health, preferred background in major clinical depression and anxiety, preclinical/clinical) – 1 position • Business Development/Marketing (experience in neurosciences space, synergistic partnerships, product planning, market analytics, licensing, deal flow) – 1 position • Intellectual Property Manager (background in drug substances and drug product patents, neurosciences and pharmaceutical chemistry) • Clinical Director (background in neurosciences, product development, experience in managing multi-site clinical trials in multiple jurisdictions)"
LUCID is hiring !!! https://www.lucidpsycheceuticals.com/careers
Love to see silly pumping from paid pumpers. Something that really doesn’t make any sense!
"As of rigt now, FSD price is green, if there was ever a time to invest it is now. FSD is not ready to give up."
"@ oliver. Not everyone is called PUMPER, Durkacz the hustler; just mama clone oliver and clones; nicky, V, Sam, Matt and for sure Durkacz the master pumper."
@ Robin Are the one who makes money PUMPING boyo?
@golden and @verner are the same people masking under different names. Both are Bokhari’s short sellers trying to throw negative comments at other investors. Take this hate to another page. You are clearly not invested in HUGE.
"Another interview by Anthony. Just interviews to settle his image and his reign. Nothing positive whatsoever for class B shareholders. Anthony ran the grow op into the ground, nothing more than a heavily promoted pump and dump that ultimately failed to hold any value after hype died and the failure to execute by Anthony and crew. Anthony got CEO after they appointed inept management just as he did with all his start-ups. Now he is about to get another cash up round and bums money from retail and other potential shareholders."
Durkatz during his moments of wisdom;
"@Matt. You can say what you please. You're a clone; your master Mr. Durkacz does what he knows better; pump , pump, pump and lineup his pockets. if you're not Durkacz, you're very close."
FSD knows they are in trouble. They have to come up with results soon. Lucid is just one piece of the puzzle they have to figure out. I don't think they will recover soon but I do see a future in which they will come put on top.
"I have been looking at FSD for some time now. I know they have a bad rep but they are way in too deep now to just call it quits. Saying that they are the underdog would be an understatement, however I dont think think they are close to calling it quits."
"@Oleg - With all the loosened restrictions, definitely see this as a significant opportunity in becoming an early mover in developing psychedelic assets. They are making the right moves and heading in the right direction"
