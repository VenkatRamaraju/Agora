"I haven't seen the dividend announcement yet, but some sites are showing a bump already? Nice yield of 4.88% for the newly offered shares??"
making money off gamblers is easier than stealing candy from a baby
MM's really want this at 30
I’m doubting VICI will turn a big profit soon. They’d have to time their offerings with enough cash on hand to repay all the debt & keep steady books and dividends. They know what they’re doing but looking outside in us shareholders may see some flat spots for a while.
I was on 'the call' today. The special Shareholders Meeting in regard to the merger. It lasted all of about 12 minutes.
used some the cash from the offering to pay down debt... I LIKE IT! Always good to see that extra cash to into good use
I see Blackstone is selling the Cosmopolitan on the strip. Wonder if VICI is interested....
just purchased my 2nd full lot of VICI today ($29.50) Long VICI
"We are climbing the wall of worry over the secondary. We should be back up next week. When the pandemic finally eases, 2022 will be a gangbuster for VICI. They have command of the best properties and will likely acquire additional properties. A true inflation hedge. People will ALWAYS gamble no matter what's going on.And dividend increases will be coming"
Why would Vici issue more shares?
WE HIT 5% YIELD BOIS! Going to slowly start to load this up
"For anyone new an overnight offering/public offering normally tanks the stock price (This was only a 4% drop, which it recovered a little in after hours). This is a great time to pick it up or add to your position as the stock normally recovers in a few days or week. High hopes for this stock lets hope it runs higher next time we get to $31.75 :D"
Bought 10 more today now got 80 slowly building
picked up another 100 #$%$ $30.03. Computer trading always pushes prices lower a little bit. Longer termthis financing will be very helpful. Lots of interest in the stock due to MGM merger.
"Dam this looks interesting as hell... Good acquisition, good earnings, good foreseeable future, Vegas as a whole looks to be recovering nicely, increases dividends by around 9% - 10% annually (ignoring 2019's increase), and the growth (Which I don't care much for) looks promising...God how have I not heard of this REIT before?Call me Mr. House cause I'm going to make this a decent size in my portfolio (If you get this joke I love you)"
"The way I read it, AFFO guidance reflects dilution from new shares but does not reflect the FFO that will be created from pending transactions. Hope this is clarified on conference call tomorrow. But that sounds like once the investments start to payoff then the AFFO will go up accordingly."
I'm looking to add more but when would be a good price point after this shelf?
Paul what does that mean. seriously
“VICI expects to use the net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock and expected cash proceeds received upon full physical settlement of the forward sale agreements to pay down current indebtedness and for a portion of the purchase price of the previously announced acquisition of the Venetian.“At least they’re using the money for a good cause. Shareholders will probably get diluted up until the MGP deal closes.
"I was doing some more research into this REIT before I buy any more in this REIT, and I'm very impressed with its results. Let's go over what I found.for those wondering ""what is this merger actually brining to VICI.. well its diversification from rent will be more diverse and evenly ""cut""Current VICI Rent Diversification:- Caesars - 68% (Remember VICI is a spinoff from Caesars so this makes a lot of sense)- The Venetian - 16%- Penn National 5%- Jack - 4%- Hard Rock - 3%- Century Casinos - 2%- ??? - 2% (I literally can't find the company's name, only its symbol)After the MGP Acquisition:- Caesars - 41% (-27%)- MGM Resorts - 40% (NEW)- The Venetian - 10% (-6%)- Penn National - 3% (-2%)- Jack - 3% (-1%)- Hard Rock - 2% (-1%)- Century Casinos - 1% (-1%)- ??? - 1% (-1%)This is great as it means VICI will be less reliant on Caesars! It will also get:2 of the largest hotels in the U.S, 7 Iconic resorts, 2 of the 3 largest Las Vegas resorts by room count, 8 premier regional assets, four 4-diamond AAA rewarded resortsBasically meaning:6K+ hotel rooms, 20K slot machines, 670 table gamesThis will also heavily spread out the REIT to be less reliant on Las Vegas having locations in: New York (2 but 1 is pending), Detroit, Atlantic City, Philadelphia, Metropolis, North Kansas City, Biloxi, Tunica, LOTS of Las Vegas, New JerseyVICI will own 660 acres which includes iconic places like: Mandalay Bay, The Park Las Vegas, Park MGM, Luxor (The pyramid thing), Excalibur, MGM Grand, New York-New York, the MirageThey will literally own a nice chunk of Las Vegas with this acquisition and I'm excited to see what will happen! I'm going to use my monthly dividends and just shove it in here for the near future. Obviously not financial advice but thanks for reading"
