"my wife considers a Louis Vuitton bag an ""investment"". i am not so sure about that. can a handbag go up in value over time? i suppose it can retain some value. what i will say is that she does not consider a Coach bag to be in same category. I do own shares in this company because it's cheap and generates decent cash flow. But I do think it needs to improve its game and become more exclusive. I am afraid that the Coach brand will turn into another Kate Spud and not the other way around."
Nice upward trend into earnings. Good sign for an earnings beat.
why does this stock randomly drop dramatically in price(to a few $/share) then return to its previous pps. it's happened a lot in its history
Thank you Jesus....
trading like bad news is coming ...i hold shares and i am not encouraged. ...too cheap so i am thinking it is cheap for a good reason ..hoping that's not the case..
next stop is 40 bucks per share!!!!!!!!!WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT
Looking to add any suggestions where I should come in at
my checkbook looks a lot better than tapestry's balance sheet ...
i still think this company is a bargain ... folks wanna get out and shop again ... and since life is now shorter with covid ... it is no holes barred spending .... a lot of folks dont even look at price tags any more ... they just throw things in the cart and pay with credit .... sad but true. ...
My wife has ordered a Coach handbag online. The delivery is quick and lovely. Coach has adapted very nicely with ecommerce. Great quality and products on sales
"yield at this price is 6.65%, but I'm just hoping it goes back to $25-$30"
"Time to buy JWN to add with TPR. Both great value stocks that were oversold, and strong companies."
No brainer for pvh to buy tpr or Cpri At 45 a share cash deal likely 5 dollars a share accretive to pvh

"This is almost comical, beats on both earnings and revenues and giving good guidance. They had great numbers for both of the purse and leather lines, they obviously have done a great job integrating the Kate Spade acquisition and the only minor miss was on the shoe line and that was almost insignificant. Simply amazing."
"Good day for buying.Luxury consumers shopped online more than ever in the past year, forced by coronavirus-related restrictions to stay away from city-center stores and airport duty-free concessions.e-commerce sales have skyrocketed, with many if not most brands reporting increases in online revenue.Online sales at Gucci's parent company Kering, for example, more than doubled in the third quarter, the last period it reported on. They rose by two-thirds at German premium-apparel company Hugo Boss AG in the same period, and increased by triple figures at Swiss group Cie. Financière Richemont SA in the second half of its fiscal year. As a whole, online luxury sales almost doubled in 2020 to account for 23% of the market, Bain & Company said in a recent report with Italian trade association Altagamma.Online channels will account for a third of total luxury sales by 2025, from 12% in 2019.""The pandemic has fast-forwarded changes that were already happening in the online world,"" said Francesca DiPasquantonio, Deutsche Bank's head of global luxury research.

Great operation.
Just bought a bunch of the Jan $32.50 calls yesterday for under $1. Looking awesome!!
"well, kind of expected this. but i think if it drops a chunk again it will be oversold. tpr is a cash generator with a good balance sheet, and will be able to continue to pay out a fat dividend and buy back stock. if it becomes too cheap, my concern is that someone tries to come in and take it private ....gl"

This TPR message board is completely inert.

anyone have an idea on earnings Tuesday...hoping for something positive
U bought the stock instead of buying the coach bags for my wife...she cried but i'm happy
"Bunny, I personally don't believe that trade concerns have anything to do with the drops in retail and fashion. For every supposed issue, retail has been disproportionately impacted over any other sectors. The two sectors that were first impacted by the imposed tariffs was industrials and tech, both sectors have had great returns. Goldman Sachs has only recently turned negative on the industrial sector after many of them reached 52 week and all time highs, ITW, IR, RPM, FAST and even DE which should have been hurt hard by the tariffs and the Chinese response to not buying agricultural products from the US. Everytime that tariffs were imposed even though they never impacted apparel or shoes, the retail and fashion sectors took huge hits, meanwhile companies like Apple, Universal Display, Advanced Micro and Nvidia were continuously pumped."
I passed by the Kate Spade store at my local mall on Sat and it was empty....
"LVMH trying to get out of deal with Tiffany to buy the entire aspirational brands market of American fashion houses, Tapestry, Capri, Fossil, PVH, RL and possibly VFC, but VFC may fight a take over and the cost would be too high. If this happens actually VFC may enter some counter bids."
Why the pullback?
"The end of the Corona virus scam is so very near. We know that 98% of the people dying in Italy are over 65 and have at least one pre-existing condition. We also know that 80% of the people who are neither of those classes prove to be completely asymptomatic, therefore very good carriers. We also know that you probably shouldn't be taking certain OTC pain relievers if you are at risk. We now have one of the most liberal governors in America saying that forced shutdowns were probably a mistake. We also will know that by this weekend we will have substantial data as to the effectiveness of the Hydroxychloroquinne and Z pack treatment which the French have been using on a large scale now for six days, the original study showed that after six days, the viral loading dropped from 100% to 0% in 75% of patients."
how is this possible! Up to 7% pre market and open red?! I do not understand anything in this market !
Not a bad idea to buy the $30 calls here.
"I was a little surprised by the revenue miss but I also didn't realize how many locations they had as Coach stores along with Dillard's, Macy's and Nordstrom's locations were actually located in the coastal regions of Texas and Florida. I also assume their Key West store is probably not operating right now either. Several locations in and around Houston and Tampa/Orlando. While a little disappointing the fact that they had earnings that beat consensus by 15% is promising. I am sure that the market will focus on the revenues miss of course to drive the price down to create an even better entry point for big money. If prices stay depressed for long in the retail sector in the USA due to the Amazon effect we very well may see many American retail staples be acquired by European and Asian competitors buying into the US market for pennies on the dollar what organic expansion would cost."
If it goes to $16 Im buying..this will be an acquisition target ..JMO
Wonder if the dividend will come back? any at all.
"darren, three problems with your analysis. One, the ""overexposure"" to China is mostly with the Coach brand which actually did quite well for the quarter. Also, if you check LVMY and RL reports you will see that at least in fashion, the concerns about an impending trade war are not leading to any serious reduction in sales to the Chinese or other Asian countries. A tired Kate Spade line, not really, the ""under-performance"" was based more on both company and analysts' expectations for continued growth after a blow out quarter which saw double digit growth. This was also the quarter that immediately followed the news of Ms. Kate Spade's unfortunate passing. It heightened awareness of the brand and led to much higher and also unlikely to be sustainable growth rates. Coach has discontinued the vast majority of their outlet and discount retailer businesses, you are talking about something that they have been working on for the past three years and just like Capri (Michael Kors) they have been very successful at increasing margins. Unfortunately, as is almost always the case, when you maintain margins, you do lose some revenues, yet those revenues were gained at grossly discounted margins. Moving on, what is your next false narrative?"
"they are shutting down everything, why not stock exchanges for next 2 weeks. so at least investors have a better picture to make decisions"
"Upgraded to buy from GS today, let’s go!"
Uh oh SEC investigation. That can’t be good for longs
"If you are not planning to sell, you plan to lose your precious profits...."
"So what happens if Tapestry just has blow out numbers? Does that change the entire narrative for the fashion and retail sectors? Everyone has been waiting for Macy's to post to totally destroy the sector and they got their wish even though in total their numbers really had some strength in them. Revenues met and same store sales were better than anticipated. Where they fell down was in profitability and that was explained by the CEO by poor execution of the inside brand designs and poor inventory mix, neither of these items is systemic. The only systemic point that he brought up was a reduction in international visitors buying product from their domestic stores. The decrease came on the heels of two years of increases based on the dollar's exchange rate. We also saw that Capri had decent numbers, we saw that the KTB spin off had decent numbers just last week. Revenues in all of these cases are indicative of a strong consumer, how individual companies have executed and individual brands within those companies has been the issue not the economy. The reaction today is grossly overplayed and is being used by the uber wealthy to create even greater entry points into the sector."
way over sold like all retail.
Any tea leaf readers want to speculate about $50 being over head resistance from August/September 2018? Seems like a good opportunity to sell some short dated out of the money covered calls.

My wife has just bought 5 purse from Tapestry online this month. This is why I know the products are excellent and very well priced.
"Bought for the wave and sold today, wish the longs the best of luck."
i don't know if i have guts to buy more shares. i don't think i do. i already own enough shares. but i do think it will recover when trade war ends ...and it will end at some point ...whether it is before or after the election ..gl
Good time to buy at 13 a share?
"pulled the trigger on 300 shares. that dividend is too good at these levels, with a 55% payout and a very healthy balance sheet.I honestly want to buy a lot more, but I'm gonna bide my time and see where things go from here"
LVMH complained about cost of tariffs in China. TPR has moved most of their manufacturing out of China and this should not infect their biz. The sell off from the last earning down from $54 is a gift. $45 right now should be the low.
Well that wasn't what I was expecting though I think the early market is over sold.
"What to do with Kate Spud is the big question? You can't take a brand that isn't upscale and make it so. If you cheapen it you lose margin. Either way you are boxed in. Big mistake was buying it. Perhaps they should spin it off and jettison it, take the pain up front rather than gradual erosion."

"well, i found courage to buy some more shares. gonna ride it out and wait for turnaround. 7% yield. and i think it is safe. TPR still generating lot of positive cash flow. plus buybacks. They just gotta turn around Kate Spud. Not sure how they will do that. Maybe they need to bring in a star designer, like Burberry did."
"As the shopping malls open, I see the SP approaching $30 again. Higher after the Christmas holiday shopping season."
"I was out shopping and finally decided to buy some TPR. Why? I had overseas visitors in December and then in March this year. Every time I am at the outlet mall, the Coach store was packed, especially with Asian tourists snapping up multiple bags. Demand for the brand is very strong, so that's why I pulled the trigger. Thoughts?"
"In his research note, 4-star analyst Paul Trussell says, “The Coach brand sustained its international momentum and saw a sequential acceleration in North Americ, reassuring investors that the brand remains healthy with its FCF generating power intact.” Trussell’s $33 price target reflects his confidence – it suggests an upside of 57% for TPR stock."
"I am one of Tapestry’s 1,000,000 new customers . Love my new Kate Spade bag and buying more . I think women will take this opportunity to gift themselves . Tapestry has been flat , but as we come into the holiday season , sales will rise ."
Its down nearly 6% today due to the scrutiny on the management. Is this a red flag for this stock? Are you guys selling it off?
TPR and JWN in trouble with Amzn news. Amzn will now directly compete against them with its news Fashion store its opening. Not good.
Anyone considering buying after this?
To bad their purses didn’t come with a burrito. The stock would be ‘soaring’ right now.
"I just bought 1200 shares @ $20.78 and plan to buy more if it pulls back. This stock last sold at this level in April 2009 at the depths of the great recession when the company was half its present size. I have a midterm target (3-5 years) of $54.Facts:Dividend of 6.76% with lots of cash to sustain the payout.70 % of sales are in north America where the economy is booming and 15% in China. Plans to increase revenue in China where the products are hugely popular.Expenses were incurred to restructure and increase Kate Spade sales. That's affecting current profit numbers temporarily. Top level long-term management team in New York, the fashion center of the world, with a growth agenda. Only 4% of manufacturing is currently performed in China to avoid US tariffs. Manufacturing has been gradually moved to safer regions."

"People taking advantage of the Covids to buy shares even though the company blew numbers off the wall during the past six months of Covids and now making large inroads with digital and China both will not be impacted by the second wave, because China never shutdown the first time except for the Wuhan province. Too funny have they are able to tank the markets nearly nine percent on a virus that has already ran its course."
"Here we go again, they are dropping the price with small orders, then as we get closer to the close the big orders will sneak in and start jacking the prices back up, they are doing the same thing with Capri, PVH and RL and have been for a couple of weeks now."
"They worked hard to drop the price today, to get it to a point where the heavy hitters could buy in at 52 week lows, actually multi-year lows, traded over a million shares in the final hour."
I don't think PVH will pay much more then $38-40/share..I do believe this would be a super acquisition for PVH
Strong earnings and guidance and the stock still slips nearly 5 percent. Go figure.
I like the consolidation. I think we see new Highs before Oct 1st.
I needed up closing my position on this and jwn I will prop regret it great stocks good luck to all longs I wanted to put my money in something that had a chance of higher growth

"People on all of these boards continue to ask the same ignorant question, why is THIS down so much? The ignorance isn't because of the question per say, but are you really looking at the macrocosm which is the fashion and retail sectors? Tapestry is not alone with dropping very fast and very furiously. Look at Ralph Lauren, PVH, CPRI, FOSL,LB, the list goes on and on, the entire fashion sector is getting pounded at least domestically, you think as if Tapestry is trading in a vacuum, no it is trading with its peers who are all getting blasted even though they have reported decent numbers in the case of Capri. Then you have to look at the even bigger picture, the fashion houses have somehow been linked at the hips with the big box department stores who are supposedly dying a slow death because of the ""failing"" mall paradigm. So that is why the likes of Macys, Nordsroms, Neiman Marcus, Kohl's, Saks, etc. are all on the verge of ""collapse"". Brick and mortar retail is dead is the on-going mantra, on-line and Amazon are taking over. Okay, let's examine all of these narratives, all of which I believe are false. There is a tie with domestic fashion houses and department stores, sure there are sales through those outlets, those sales tend to be higher margins, but there are numerous other outlets for Tapestry and all of the houses, their own name brand stores, on-line sales, large international sales, etc.. Malls are dead, okay if that is the case why is America's largest mall property owner Simon Properties REIT not getting hammered like the big box retailers or for that matter any mall retailer, such as Signet, American Eagle, Abercombie, Pier 1, Kirkland's, Finish Line, Dicks, pretty much the entire sector. Most of the retailers are pushing stock prices that we haven't seen since the Great Recession, Simon is at 154, sure, close to its 52 week low, but no where near the lows of the Great Recession which were in the upper 30s. How is it, that the mall owners are doing quite well, yet the stores that inhabit those malls are apparent Pariahs to the investment communities. Okay, now to look at how Amazon is destroying brick and mortar, well if that were the case, why is Amazon so focused on increasing its brick and mortar footprint? Purchased Whole Foods, opening Amazon store fronts, creating collaborations with Kohl's, Stein Mart's for returns and even exchanges, and now they are trying to acquire the largest brick and mortar retailer in India. Then we have to continue the discussion, how does Amazon fare if Trump gets re-elected? He has made his intentions well known that he wants the FTC and the DOJ to break up the FANGs and in the case of Amazon, if you break the retail business away from its AWS, you have the largest on-line retailer who has lost millions of dollars without its cash cow. How long can Bezos keep a purely retail version of Amazon in business, mainly if now they have to pay revenues to the now separate AWS independent company? Amazon if Trump wins re-election becomes a wounded animal."
"Linda, actually the Cramer effect can have positive outcomes as well. Yet it may still be awhile before either one of us is green on this."
"TPR has 3 very strong ""Brand"" names.. we could see some consolidation in this area like Tiffany's. I could see PVH trying to acquire TPR"
"Gary, it could be a turn around story long term, but the EU has not been kind to fashion houses outside of France, pretty much all of the Italian houses have been eaten up by LVMH and Kering and the British houses are all gone with a few exceptions to include Burberry, but they are struggling very hard currently. As I said, it could become a takeover target, but not sure that is worth the risk at these prices. Good luck, but holding on to TPR will pay off in the near term I believe as will CPRI, RL, and PVH."
"Hey Shaggy, I sold my CI on Friday and got in RH. Now I have both health care and retail. So doesn’t matter if recession comes or not, I will benefit either way."
Going to the moon
"Though not a big fan of financial engineering, prices are so ridiculously low throughout the retail and fashion sector I believe we will see many more companies rotate from equity to debt models. Guess was the latest to begin the switch after Restoration Hardware so successfully jump started the value of their stock from the low 30s to the upper 160s in a matter of a few quarters after they make the switch. It is very tempting for companies, mainly those with high dividends which TPR has in relation to other fashion sector plays."
Do we know when they report earnings yet?
"Kate Spud CEO is ""leaving"" ... doubt it was voluntary ... that should help the stock price ...hopefully they get someone really good to reinvigorate the brand...that is, if it is possible.."
Good luck shorting this stock snoop! Going to $30 by Christmas.
I am sorry my post adds no value to the board but I am sick over this owning it at $48. I own too many shares to even consider averaging down at this point.
"I have been a shareholder for about 20 years, originally purchasing COH.

"Apple is actually up today and Tesla is pretty much flat. News from Vietnam, twelve cases discovered all patients fully recovered, one patient was hospitalized.

The facility is capable of producing millions of doses of vaccines for pandemics without the need for chicken egg incubation, therefore the synthesized process can complete runs that would have taken months in days. Sorry for your luck but there will be no carnage, as the Corona virus is merely a strong strain of the flu."
Love this company and they have great merchandise and the stock has done will.
Always a good buying opportunity before the holidays.
"No telling Linda, I have had many posts deleted as well. It seems the money laundering uber wealthy are not wanting the small retail investors to converse about how the markets are being gamed. Heck, they can buy their kids into Harvard, what makes anyone think they can't tank a stock at will or pump one up at will. The reality is that the big money boys are selecting individual winners based on suspect information and using false narratives to justify unjustifiable moves in all sectors right now. There is absolutely no reason that NVDA is blowing up after the horrible acquisition of Mellanox and there is absolutely no reason that Tapestry, Capri and Ralph Lauren are dropping meanwhile in the Paris exchange we have LVMH blowing up, because they have a much harder time gaming the European markets which have limitations on computerized trading. Currently less than 10% of trading is done based on a person deciding to buy an individual stock, 40% are people choosing to buy an index fund, EFT based on sector, country, etc. and the remainder is computer versus computer trading. Or as most refer to it as HFT, high frequency trading, if the computers can work against each other, who is to say that they can't work together. Eventually they will have no option but to let the retail and fashion sector climb, just like they did in June, July and August of last year. The one thing they can't allow is to create such a huge chasm between the realities of fundamentals and the manipulated stock prices that it raises the ire of the SEC. They are willing to accept the fact that many small retail investors are being gamed so long as the bigger retirement funds and endowment funds are doing okay, but once that isn't the case then they will be forced to intervene."
buy this stock it is a good one for longterm with high dividend and high potential for growth with their brands
"Fossil reported better than expected both top and bottom lines, though just marginally better, good report from Capri, beat on bottom line, slight miss on the top line, though forecast in line. Asia numbers looked good for both as well, the Chinese issue has been grossly overblown, should be a good quarter for Tapestry."
"Louis Vuitton doesn't have sales. I went to the website. Nothing on sale there. I guess it cheapens the brand. I went to Coach website.There are bags and items 50% off. Coach needs to become more exclusive. Otherwise they will become more like Kate Spud rather than becoming more like Louis Vuitton. American ""luxury"" brands need to model themselves after their European counterparts if they want to become as successful. Otherwise they will continue to wallow in the retail discount dustbin."
buy now
"Let me think, there is probably a 75% we beat given that KORS blew it out of the water due to Asia, where Coach, aka Tapestry has a very strong presence, the price raises by 20%, there is a 10% we meet and the price goes up by 5%, there is a 15% we miss and the price drops by 10%. The cost benefit analysis gives a return of .75(41.25*.2)+.1(41.25*.05)-.15(41.25*.1) = $5.78 per share, I think I will buy more. Let's not even look at the similarities of the KORS story (Jimmy Choo acquisition) and the TPR story (Kate Spade acquisition). Also, the hurricanes in TX and FL will be extremely additive to the bottom line, I saw it in NOLA after Katrina. The American Red Cross ended up buying a lot of Coach purses."
"Though of course, Tapestry financial situation much better than Capri's, so maybe management is confident in being able to make it through without any long term impacts."
Bought in at $14 and selling out today. Good luck to all!
New call for $35
"Let's see, they take it red with a hard drop at open and then drive the price up through the day, hopefully we end up at 28, but would not be surprised to see 25.50 at some point today. Of course, its all about the spread, use the HFT algorithms to drive it hard to create buy points and then drive it hard up to create sell points and create ten to twelve percent spreads. Seems to be pretty typical in the fashion sector anymore."
"new ceo wont jettison Kate Spud. well, that's what he says. however, if the company can't turn around Kate Spud they will look to offload it to some other company that thinks it could do better, and TPR will take a loss on their investment. Perhaps if they bring in an italian designer, preeferably someone who is gay and talented."
"Tapestry (TPR) – The company behind the Coach and Kate Spade luxury brands was upgraded to “overweight” from “neutral” at JPMorgan Chase.

Did some research into S&M and have to change my outlook on TPR.. product offering isn’t compelling relative to competitors in their space. TPR maybe do ok if their lucky.. LVMH and high end brands certainly will maintain stronger sales. Stuart weitzman brand is probably the most balanced-exciting and holds a defined position in the shoe space with loyal shoppers. Coach design is outdated and is low ranked compared to LVMH and luxury brands. Loyalty is droppingKate although more appealing to millennials than coach needs ad/marketing push to really bring it to shine. Sold and will wait for signs of S&M turn around. If they are good they will have it streamlined for 4qtr 2020Will evaluate again mid year 2020

"Gary, I think Silver would have been a much better choice, at least you hedge your bet. Once the truth is found out about the virus, the markets will correspondingly react. The reality is that the current strain of the flu is much more dangerous than the Corona virus among relatively healthy individuals with adequate health care access. I appreciate the fact that you are trying to preserve your wealth in rather trying times, but gold is strictly a precious metal which is slowly losing some of its preciousness with the advent of cyrpto currencies. Silver meanwhile has the distinction of being both a precious metal and an item that is used in industrial applications, so at least if you are wrong about the oncoming abyss, the run up in industrial production will at least provide a floor for your silver investment. Once the shock and awe of Corona virus is gone, gold again creeps down to its most recent floor of 1450 to 1500."

why the sudden 9% pop ?
"Computerized trading dropping the price on both Capri and Tapestry at the same rate, this has been the case multiple times this past year, they drop the price of both in sequence, if it weren't so obvious it would almost be funny."
"If I use the risk free rate of 2.25% and 4% risk premium to the expected return, and discount the cash generated using discounted rate of 6.68%, TPR should worth at least 42 dollars. The current price is under valuing this free cash generating with growth stock."
Tapestry reached a 52 Week high at 32.09
"Linda Z, it has been painful, but I believe they post good numbers, other aspirational brands in fashion, such as PVH have shown good numbers and the brands are all strong, I think Hydrogen may have some ammunition in regards to the shoe line up as they were weak last quarter but I believe the Spade line is still very strong and probably going to be a growth leader as I believe the brand and the designs speak strongly to the millennials who are slowly creeping into the big consumer phase of their lives. Also, believe with the pronounced weakness coming from China a trade deal will not be far away and I believe that allows the economy to kick back into high gear. In regards to Macy's sales, you may want to read the whole report, very specific sectors didn't fair too well but others did quite well, it was actually lower end segments that didn't fair as well as the upper end segments."
china people see brand name clothing and accessories as status symbol. coach hand bag is more expensive in china than it is in U.S {due to tariffs} even though china people make much less than Americans. as China and asia become more affluent luxury brands will make gobs of money. the trick is to retain that brand status and don't sell down to the masses..
this company is best in breed. Surprised not more interest.
tapestry straight to the moon
"Market edge analysis looks good:The current technical condition for TPR is strong and the chart pattern suggests that upward momentum should continue. The stock has outperformed the market over the last 50 trading days when compared to the S&P 500. The MACD-LT is confirming that the intermediate-term trend is bullish. TPR's chart formation indicates a strong rising trend. Upside momentum, as measured by the 9-day RSI indicator is very strong. The stock is in a short-term overbought condition based on a Slow % K stochastic reading of 80 or higher. Over the last 50 trading sessions, there has been more volume on up days than on down days, indicating that TPR is under accumulation, which is a bullish condition. The stock is trading above a rising 50-day moving average. This validates the strong technical condition for TPR. The stock is above its 200-day moving average but the 200-day is pointed down indicating that the intermediate-term trend is still in question."
"darren, are you shorting the stock now?"
Nice thing the return ratio on handbags have to be low
"Price target has been increase from $32 to $38 by Wells Fargo, Also recently Cowen & Co. Oliver Chen increased the price target from $30 to $40Defenitly Top pick of the year!"
Today’s dip is artificial! LOL love market makers’ manipulation! No one can stop TPR rallying up from here!
Up day coming for Tapestry tomorrow. Behold the Jeremy effect! Roni Rona don’t stand a chance
"Never in my life did I believe that the evil that exists in our world could ever exist. I knew that I should have invested in the liberal love fest stocks of Jeff Bezos's Amazon, Tim Cook's Apple and a few select others, but just thought that it would be short lived and that they couldn't tank the overall markets and the fashion and retail sectors which they had already tanked so much more. Yet they did, the 0.1% who own 80% of the world's wealth are very greedy and working with the likes of China and the WHO to create a Black Swain event that will end up making them even greater wealth. So sad that I knew what was happening but never thought that so much evil could survive in our current world. Are we truly near the end times?"
"So when LB separates into it's two halves (which each have about the same sales volume), 2 related questions:1. When does LB plan to reinstate the dividend?2. What will the dividend be for each half after they split.I didn't see anything related to the dividend in any of the recent articles concerning the upcoming separation, earnings release, or sales & earnings guidance. Did I miss something?"
"Does anyone know if TPR has a Poison Pill takeover provision to prevent what is happening right now with Tiffany's? LVMH has announced they are buying shares on the open market at much discounted prices to their agreed upon acquisition price in an attempt to reduce the overall cost. Could they potentially be buying up the entire American fashion industry at ridiculously low valuations as well, could they be having multiple private equity players buying up to the maximum reporting limits to join forces to force a sale at much reduced prices."
"strong brand, holding thru earnings, key is Kate spade turn around story, any insights from folks?"
All retail down except CAPRI and TPR meanwhile JWN (that is doing better than the other two) is at its lowest levels since the beginning of the pandemic. Why ? Stock manipulation? It seems to me there are some ppl trying to hold these two stocks... and then... they dump them like they always do
"Gary, Burberry has something in common with LVHM and Kerring, they are APRs which trade in markets which have serious regulations and oversight so there is little manipulation and big money control of prices."
"I had to sell. not that I dont think this can run more but its hard to turn down a 3 week 20% return.good luck to longs, I'll be watching to see if this drops back down"
Back to 40 by Christmas.
"Anyway who bought before today is obviously feeling the pain. TPR is way oversold. Great time to get in and/or buy more Profitable company, brand precognition, strong balance sheet, growing low single digits (slower than previous forecast but it's still growth), great dividend (especially in this low rate env), strong balance sheet, safe divy, stock buyback. Expected FY20 earnings of $2.60-$2.80 per share. Mid point $2.70 per share x a below average P/E of 13, this is a $35 stock. Even if you apply a rock-bottom P/E of 10, this should be $27."
"Tapestry is a beat up company right now. Stores are closed and very few people will rush to buy luxury goods, after quarantine. Although, if life will turn around to previous behavior. Patient is investors, who are buying now, will double its investment."
Broke even and sold this
Why is this dropping so bad today?
"Dividend coming back, baby!"
With shops close and changing shopping habbits I doubt if this is going much higher...I see more losses to this company...dont look at the year ago price ...we are in a totally different time ...
"TPR will move nicely up in the next year, i hope there will be a market crash because i own some good value stocks. they will probably drop but not as much as some overvalued stocks"
"No body is really looking at this company? No reactions in the board at all. Anyways, I am holding 2500 shares average cost 13.5 dollars. Once the dividend is announced back or vaccin is found, this stock should jump right back to 18-20 dollar range."
"Corbin, there is a reason that Coach and Kate Spade as well as Michael Kors are called aspirational brands, these are people who are making decent money who are looking to show off some of their new found wealth, I don't think anyone who buys one of their purses is making a decision between food or a purse, or at least very few. Recessions tend to hit the lower demographics harder, these are not the typical Tapestry customer."
"good brands, luxury items are kinda the forgotten stocks on wallstreet. what will people do with all that stimulus money, it will go to a new iphone and once people also go out they will buy that beautiful luxury bag they always wanted"
"Now that the tech sector and primarily the chip sector is getting pumped by the analysts at Goldman and Morgan Stanley who both have been saying that the chips were in a major inventory correction, it will probably delay the sector swap into retail and fashion that happened last year at this time, so it is to be expected that they would pressure individual stocks on a revolving basis to push them lower for their high dollar clients before moving into the sectors. Its all a game, which the big money always win. That is why the vast majority of my portfolio is invested in ADRs, much harder to play games with foreign markets, mainly the EU markets."
"Luckily , Tapestry has strong balance sheet and was buying shares back."
"Stores in China, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong are all opened with pend up demands"
Earnings beat!
TPR looks good to buy here. Loading up 1000 shares to start.
they need a new ad campaign ...maybe team with the Russians and launch the first handbag in space ...Kate Spudnick...
I think we need a day or two for it to reach its entry point
It will close $51 or below today....
only here because of YouTube financial education
perhaps they shouldn't have bought kate spud ....
"Maybe we should consider a name change to Sky Works, pretty much similar numbers in terms of percentage misses and they were up by 15%, too funny. Not really, kinda sad, I think we will find out more information on this miss though, seems like the expectations for Kate lines were in my opinion unrealistic to begin with. The fact that the two other lines, mainly Weitzmann which was the laggard last time is very good news."
Holy smokas this ain’t NOOOO Jokas
Tapestry is up 10.57% to 26.89
"Revenue beat was a very big positive, earnings really weren't that bad though I really didn't quite understand the jump in SG&A, unless that was due to the transition from brick and mortar to on-line."
Jeremy effect incoming lmaooo
"What a long time coming. The Board, including the new interim CEO must share responsibility. They sat back and allowed an egoist, inexperienced CEO make vanity project acquisitions that have failed and allowed the top executive talent to depart. Investors have been badly let down. More change is needed."
Credit Suisse sends it higher on good report! Over $40
TPR reached a new 52 Week High at 55.38
buy the stock not because It still has great potential its going to go up im telling you my friends
