"Louis Vuitton doesn't have sales. I went to the website. Nothing on sale there. I guess it cheapens the brand. I went to Coach website.There are bags and items 50% off. Coach needs to become more exclusive. Otherwise they will become more like Kate Spud rather than becoming more like Louis Vuitton. American ""luxury"" brands need to model themselves after their European counterparts if they want to become as successful. Otherwise they will continue to wallow in the retail discount dustbin."
This stock is an under the radar sleeper stock. Wait till Wall Street wakes up. Maybe after their next earnings report which I believe will be on 11/4.
"Tapestry (TPR) – The company behind the Coach and Kate Spade luxury brands was upgraded to “overweight” from “neutral” at JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan cited confidence in healthy earnings growth following a meeting with management, and sees the stock’s current price as undervalued. Tapestry shares rose 6% in the premarket"
"Let's see, they take it red with a hard drop at open and then drive the price up through the day, hopefully we end up at 28, but would not be surprised to see 25.50 at some point today. Of course, its all about the spread, use the HFT algorithms to drive it hard to create buy points and then drive it hard up to create sell points and create ten to twelve percent spreads. Seems to be pretty typical in the fashion sector anymore."
My target price is 30 dollares a share! My opinion is that in 3 months we see this hiting that
"Maybe we should consider a name change to Sky Works, pretty much similar numbers in terms of percentage misses and they were up by 15%, too funny. Not really, kinda sad, I think we will find out more information on this miss though, seems like the expectations for Kate lines were in my opinion unrealistic to begin with. The fact that the two other lines, mainly Weitzmann which was the laggard last time is very good news."
earnings same as last year...TPR was at $50now $20 buying for a dividend 1.3B cash on hand should announce buy backs
Today’s dip is artificial! LOL love market makers’ manipulation! No one can stop TPR rallying up from here!
only here because of YouTube financial education
how is this possible! Up to 7% pre market and open red?! I do not understand anything in this market !
China's not buying luxury bags much especially the middle class. Earnings miss most likely.
Good luck shorting this stock snoop! Going to $30 by Christmas.

"my wife considers a Louis Vuitton bag an ""investment"". i am not so sure about that. can a handbag go up in value over time? i suppose it can retain some value. what i will say is that she does not consider a Coach bag to be in same category. I do own shares in this company because it's cheap and generates decent cash flow. But I do think it needs to improve its game and become more exclusive. I am afraid that the Coach brand will turn into another Kate Spud and not the other way around."
My wife has just bought 5 purse from Tapestry online this month. This is why I know the products are excellent and very well priced.

"I just bought 1200 shares @ $20.78 and plan to buy more if it pulls back. This stock last sold at this level in April 2009 at the depths of the great recession when the company was half its present size. I have a midterm target (3-5 years) of $54.Facts:Dividend of 6.76% with lots of cash to sustain the payout.70 % of sales are in north America where the economy is booming and 15% in China. Plans to increase revenue in China where the products are hugely popular.Expenses were incurred to restructure and increase Kate Spade sales. That's affecting current profit numbers temporarily. Top level long-term management team in New York, the fashion center of the world, with a growth agenda. Only 4% of manufacturing is currently performed in China to avoid US tariffs. Manufacturing has been gradually moved to safer regions."

"TPR has 3 very strong ""Brand"" names.. we could see some consolidation in this area like Tiffany's. I could see PVH trying to acquire TPR"
Love this company and they have great merchandise and the stock has done will.
"Computerized trading dropping the price on both Capri and Tapestry at the same rate, this has been the case multiple times this past year, they drop the price of both in sequence, if it weren't so obvious it would almost be funny."

My wife has ordered a Coach handbag online. The delivery is quick and lovely. Coach has adapted very nicely with ecommerce. Great quality and products on sales
bought TPR at 15 in my sons IRA to introduce him to stocks. asking him to hold into the 50s.
Up day coming for Tapestry tomorrow. Behold the Jeremy effect! Roni Rona don’t stand a chance
tapestry straight to the moon
New to this board...but based on my wife’s anticipated purchasing plans I now have a position in TPR. Probably buy more if it dips again.
playing this ER hard. they would have to really miss to break the current trendline
Nice upward trend into earnings. Good sign for an earnings beat.
"Good day for buying.Luxury consumers shopped online more than ever in the past year, forced by coronavirus-related restrictions to stay away from city-center stores and airport duty-free concessions.e-commerce sales have skyrocketed, with many if not most brands reporting increases in online revenue.Online sales at Gucci's parent company Kering, for example, more than doubled in the third quarter, the last period it reported on. They rose by two-thirds at German premium-apparel company Hugo Boss AG in the same period, and increased by triple figures at Swiss group Cie. Financière Richemont SA in the second half of its fiscal year. As a whole, online luxury sales almost doubled in 2020 to account for 23% of the market, Bain & Company said in a recent report with Italian trade association Altagamma.Online channels will account for a third of total luxury sales by 2025, from 12% in 2019.""The pandemic has fast-forwarded changes that were already happening in the online world,"" said Francesca DiPasquantonio, Deutsche Bank's head of global luxury research. ""Companies that were already better positioned and had invested [in the online channel] since a long way back, they've found themselves in the best place to benefit from this shift. Companies that have neglected this channel find it hard to catch up,"" she said.The global luxury goods market is expected to grow with a CAGR of 10% from 2019 to 2024.Earnings Date: 2/25/21$CPRI $TPR $LVMHF $JWN $WSM $FTCH"
Geez another director? Maybe she can do something to increase stock price. Performance last 5 years has been dismal to say the least.
"Though not a big fan of financial engineering, prices are so ridiculously low throughout the retail and fashion sector I believe we will see many more companies rotate from equity to debt models. Guess was the latest to begin the switch after Restoration Hardware so successfully jump started the value of their stock from the low 30s to the upper 160s in a matter of a few quarters after they make the switch. It is very tempting for companies, mainly those with high dividends which TPR has in relation to other fashion sector plays."
This will double after the holidays. Digital sales tripled!
"So what happens if Tapestry just has blow out numbers? Does that change the entire narrative for the fashion and retail sectors? Everyone has been waiting for Macy's to post to totally destroy the sector and they got their wish even though in total their numbers really had some strength in them. Revenues met and same store sales were better than anticipated. Where they fell down was in profitability and that was explained by the CEO by poor execution of the inside brand designs and poor inventory mix, neither of these items is systemic. The only systemic point that he brought up was a reduction in international visitors buying product from their domestic stores. The decrease came on the heels of two years of increases based on the dollar's exchange rate. We also saw that Capri had decent numbers, we saw that the KTB spin off had decent numbers just last week. Revenues in all of these cases are indicative of a strong consumer, how individual companies have executed and individual brands within those companies has been the issue not the economy. The reaction today is grossly overplayed and is being used by the uber wealthy to create even greater entry points into the sector."
Huge pressure from the loss of Chinese clients!
"Linda Z, it has been painful, but I believe they post good numbers, other aspirational brands in fashion, such as PVH have shown good numbers and the brands are all strong, I think Hydrogen may have some ammunition in regards to the shoe line up as they were weak last quarter but I believe the Spade line is still very strong and probably going to be a growth leader as I believe the brand and the designs speak strongly to the millennials who are slowly creeping into the big consumer phase of their lives. Also, believe with the pronounced weakness coming from China a trade deal will not be far away and I believe that allows the economy to kick back into high gear. In regards to Macy's sales, you may want to read the whole report, very specific sectors didn't fair too well but others did quite well, it was actually lower end segments that didn't fair as well as the upper end segments."
"Anyway who bought before today is obviously feeling the pain. TPR is way oversold. Great time to get in and/or buy more Profitable company, brand precognition, strong balance sheet, growing low single digits (slower than previous forecast but it's still growth), great dividend (especially in this low rate env), strong balance sheet, safe divy, stock buyback. Expected FY20 earnings of $2.60-$2.80 per share. Mid point $2.70 per share x a below average P/E of 13, this is a $35 stock. Even if you apply a rock-bottom P/E of 10, this should be $27."
"Price target has been increase from $32 to $38 by Wells Fargo, Also recently Cowen & Co. Oliver Chen increased the price target from $30 to $40Defenitly Top pick of the year!"
