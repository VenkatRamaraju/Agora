What a great day for shorts. Congrats are in order for shorting above 50 and haveing net profit of 40% in single day. Pretty hard to do when you are long in stocks...Always buy on heavy dips and sell on pops and not the other way around...Human nature is to buy on pops and sell on heavy dips. Hard to control the reflexes...Good Luck to all and do yourd due diligence always..
"Looks like a huge spread between BMO Capital and CraigH. I wonder if they attended the same conference call or if BMO Capital is carrying water for the shorts? bombaywala46 Nov. 13 at 8:00 AM $EBIX For whatever it's worth. Here is CH commentary. Ebix, Inc. BUY (EBIX – $37.47 intraday) Price Target: $110 Encouraging Revenue Outlook Offset By Near Term Margin pressure. IPO On Track. 10x P/E Very Attractive. Maintaining BUY Rating And $110 Price Target. Bullish: o The US based Insurance Exchange business is expected to grow 8-10% in ’20, solidly reversing the declines of last year. This was a large point of investor concern over the trailing year. o The IPO remains on track for June or July of ’20. We’ve laid out thoughts on valuation here, suggesting $3B+ for the EbixCash unit alone (~$100/share to Ebix). o Yatra acquisition appears to remain on track for a close and was delayed by audits and other process related issues. o EbixCash business grew 23% y/y on an organic basis, excluding acquisitions since taking place in Q3’18 and beyond. This has not been broken out previously"
Perhaps Robin needs to tweet he’s taking the co private for $420.
To Robin: How about taking some of those earnings and buying back some shares. It’s incredible how your company stock can be manipulated !!
Imagine if Ranai announced shareholders of this date would get shares of the new IPO based on some formula based on total shares they anticipate. future shareholders would get something less. The result is nobody would sell and the shorts would get squeezed big time!
It's very interesting that they still have such a big revolving line of credit from YTRA offer. But actually small long term debt.
"' but the stock has since pulled back largely because imo investors simply don't trust the mgt. It's got some good days ahead, but it'll be a grind.'AGREED! Investors have a lot to distrust in mgmt, particularly the lack of any semblance of reflection.abs ZERO seems to have been learnt by EBIX EGOS, even though 1.5m of legal costs incurred on RSM debacle, a 45% tank in market worth and ZERO initiative for reform.How Ebix can simply brush the entire saga under the carpet with nonchalance is beyond me, and probably beyond most inst holders...such a pity the only way full intrinsic value will be realised is if there is a takeover of this megalomaniacal mgmt"
need to know if RR is going to keep his word - about being paid with shares until stock price is $150 per share
After $MOMO Ebix is the most undervalued quality stock in the market right now imho. Easy money.
"That's about a 30% drop on NO NEWS from $36 to $29 in last 3 weeks,granted small volumes but still THE MARKET PRICE!!and IPO of EBIXCASH is now less than 9 months away!!IF we can trust mgmt date of 1q '22 for IPOthis is either the biggest arbitrage opportunity on marketORthere is a serious negative announcement imminent on Ebix.any comments or opinions?"
"the EBIX discussions on StockTwits is pretty good, if anyone wants to come over... Lots of longs, a couple insufferable shorts, good commentary and steady stream of links ppl find."
To Robin: Based on what I heard today it’s hard to believe the stock is trading down. It still appears that the short interest is in control. Please use some of that cash on hard to purchase stock and drive the shorts out.
This is a huge buy $80 in 6 months buying more now
Why the PE is so low? I am buying it under 20.
"Well, it looks like the Redditters are rampaging again against the GME shorts (stock is up 90% again today). I hope these Redditters discover Ebix, which is a perfect candidate (huge short interest, has been screwed by hedge funds for years) for what they are doing."
"Interesting action today. I expected the opposite, honestly. I still think this is a huge candidate for a short squeeze, once it gets on people's radar."
Good to Know RR is piling up his shares as the small investors are going broke.
There is the threat of short squeeze. It will help lift the price in the next couple weeks
"1/31/18 short interest 3.9M, lowest its been since i've been an investor in the last 5 years. Shorts are running for the hills 3.9M/ 156k average volume = it would take 25 days if 100% of the volume was short covering to close out of their position. Asymetric upside 100M in sales this qtr is a lock (don't forget medical sales get a boost at year end), 60M gross profit."
"went ahead and picked up 300 shares on aftermarket at $33, will see on Monday if I just throw away some money"
Now that another good quarter is in the books we are down 17-18 % from the recent highs. I hope that EBIX management decides to give us some support. If they refuse to buy why not give us some positive news. I listened to a conference call full of positive news or so I thought. How about an update or two. The silence is deafening.
Shorts are trying to take down early again...this will be up over $1 or so by end of day.
Ebix will be hugely success in next 5 to 10 years with their focus on India. The company will be worth 10 times more than current market price.
Nice time to buy ?
"IPO IS ON SCHEDULE !!! here we goooooSOME DELUDED SHORT INVESTOR is trying to push Ebix down today after this epic news that almost casts a shareprice above $60 as soon as the market understands that :-if IPO plans are announced today cf deferred, it almost guarantees 2020 audit is going smoothly and there is NO FUTURE RESTATEMENT imminent-the valuation of EbixCash - given unicorn funding this year in India - is north of a MINIMUM OF $1.8 BNlol i jus luv crazy markets"
The S-4 SEC form for the merger with Yatra was filed on January 17. Time is running out for the shorts since this is one of the last steps required before the IPO announcement is made. They may not be as worried as I would be about that.
This market is weird at best. Hyped stocks with earnings or $1-2 a year with 30% growth are trading at $150++. This guy with earnings of $4+ trading at PE of 8?????
"I have studied the short actions and listened to Viceroy podcasts and they tend to wait for some catalyst to attach too when shorting significant stock volumes. It seems they are using the tariff on steel, fruits and vegetables as a catalyst to cause panic by dumping/selling shares. Don't fall for it, EBIX reaffirmed $800M in revenue guidance at 30% gross margins that's $240M in operating income income less $40M in int expense gets you too $200M for FYE in 2020 with 30M shares OS that's around $6.50 in EPS for a PE of 7. Don't be a sucker the shorts are counting on it."
"Won't the EbixCash IPO cut off EbixCash's cashflow from Ebix, thereby depriving Ebix of its largest division's revenue and profit ? Is the IPO really a good idea? Unless Ebix can consolidate, Ebix would become a much smaller company."
"This was posted at the Marketbeat Social tab this morning:ValueTrapeze Sep. 5 at 8:57 AM $EBIX shorts are in denial about what is happening. Ebix has retained top-tier underwriters who will sell 25% of Ebixcash in the IPO for ~$500m. I suspect use of proceeds will be about $300m to pay down inter-company debt back to Ebix Inc., and the remaining $200m will be retained as growth capital. This IPO will substantially de-lever Ebix, and provide a transparent valuation benchmark for Ebixcash for U.S. investors to properly value Ebix Inc. New analyst coverage in India and in the U.S. (legacy Yatra coverage + whatever international IPO underwriter joins the syndicate) will draw in more investors in a virtuous cycle. · Reply"
"Shorts are going to be so screwed 7M shares short to buy back, CEO forgoing cash to take stock only compensation until share price is $150, India IPO Q4 2019/2020, company immediately deploying $100M to buy back stock....This will be a histrically bad short...Go Longs"
"Price Action 34 to 44 since 8/15 till today, 7.9M short to 7.6M short (probably a bit lower now), what happens when they really start to cover?"
"Once selling ends in couple week, there may be knockdown shares by MMs (Market Manipulators) to shakeout medium term holders. May be good time to buy on second fall or tother shoe dropping before compnay announces new auditr and then 10Q filing in anohter 3-4 months afterwards...Looking like summer before any new action !The MARKET is a casino in ST and investment in LT. Go buy GE and sleep well and wait couple years to double or triple!GLTA in stock casino!"
This will be back to $40 this week.. Hope you bought that dip
IPO of ebixcash will correct the significant undervalue situation. Short will be toasted.
"This seems like a perfect investment. Very little downside with well established business and low valuation AND most importantly a huge asset in the pocket with multi-billion Ebix Cash IPO that the management has confirmed is on target for H1 2022. Analysts compared the IPO valuation to peers and gave a range of 5 to 12 billion - 5 to 12 BILLION of which Ebix owns 100% and the company market cap is right now just under one billion... free money anyone? I guess the poor mistakes and legal battles of the near past have driven off the interest in EBIX, but now those battles are over and once the momentum changes I for one believe we will see a drastic jump in valuation as the dust settles and the IPO of Ebix cash nears. To me this is a no-brainer to jump in now and enjoy the ride."

Ebix is up 5.05% to 32.85
"If anyone wants to see the affect a narcissistic egomaniac can have on the price of a stock, pull up a five-year chart on EBIX. RR’s ego is written all over it. In a recent earnings call, he had the audacity to use the phrase “my companies” when referring to all the businesses that make up EBIX. This is why we need an activist investor to come on board and shake things up…the stockholders need better representation."
Will the current Ebix shareholders get any of the EbixCash shares through the EbixCash IPO or Ebix will be keeping all the EbixCash shares and IPO proceeds?

The market's reaction to nothing changing is evident - RR needs to be replaced - he is not concerned with shareholders - with the stock price low - and him being paid with shares - he gobbles up the company - the BOD is no doing their job - they are afraid of him - the legal system will get involved before this is over - RR has robbed the average shareholder - we were > $80 / share - now we are at $20 / shares - and no increase in the dividend - and the revenue has doubled - this is wrong wrong wrong -
WHEN are the shorts going to buy back the shares they sold and did not own ? I suggest longs hold hold hold hold hold - hold today - hold tomorrow AND hold until we pass $150 / share - then sell some of your shares !

Fast.The surge of unicorns created in India this year lends credence to the view the EbixCash IPO will be highly successful.Last call for the clearance sale on Ebix, the digital e-train to Mumbai.

"RR will probably make investors wait until next Friday after market close to release earnings and hold CC. RR seems to be interested only in RR, and not EBIX investors. The EBIX companies are solid, management needs a shakeup. Good luck to all."
"ATTN Stuart - If you're here and listening, I'd love to know your current take on EBIX. Thanks, from a long back in the ol' days who invested (and held on) in large part because of your analysis."
Anyone care to comment on the February 60 calls?
Interesting isn’t the word you would use if you owned EBIX in the mid to upper 70’s. I think catastrophic would be a better term. Some positive news would be appreciated.
"Today's stock action really made no sense, but it's consistent with EBIX's manic stock price action in the past. The good news (and most important news) is that the business is vibrant and growing. The less good news is that the street still doesn't seem to like this stock. Overall, I'm very pleased with the CC today, and the outlook for tomorrow."
T-minus 20 days until ER deadline. Any announcement from company that they are reporting early should send this higher. Shorts are on the clock to cover.
Low float with a high short interest of 25%. Will be squeezed to 40 by tomorrow.
Went all in at an average price of 28$. I played earnings and we will see how much money I make. Don’t plan on losing any that’s for sure.

"With solid, clean earnings and huge amount of short position (25%), my target for this is $50 by end of April. So undervalued."
The problem seems to be the retaliatory tariffs by India. I'm not smart enough to know how to calculate the effects on earnings or to estimate how long this issue will persist.
EbixCASH will be huge in processing payment just considering the population and digitalization effort of India

Added more at $25. Thanks.
Can’t believe about 25% of outstanding shares are short...can you say squeeze is coming?!
"This will probably rally to $32+ at the bell, and another 10% tomorrow to $35. Sell off today is a bit overblown in my opinion."
no news on mid-May decision on acquisition ? and - I read some time ago - stock split 6 - 1 and keep same dividend - which would have meant the dividend would have increased to $0.45 per share - what happened to that plan from management ?there seems to be something fishy about how this company perceives rewarding loyalty of shareholders -
RR talked about salaries - did not hear any mention of him not accepting a paycheck until the stock price hit $150 per share - as he stated he would do - some time ago - if he is now paid with shares as he said - then when he resumes paying himself a paycheck again - salary expense goes up - margins goes down When does he think the PPS will be $150 per share ?
"ebix got away within a hair's breath from being successfully sued by Yatra.Ebix had committed itself to paying $358m -fixed price, no warranties - for a co now worth $35m = Yatrawow that was a close shave for ANOTHER 'MISSTEP' BY OUR CLOWN TROUPEwww.lexology.com/...Termination of Merger Agreement Prevents Suit for BreachBlog Dodd-FrankStinson LLPMEMBER FIRM OF TerraLexStinson LLP logoUSA September 6 2021Yatra Online, Inc., v. Ebix, Inc. concerned an abandoned merger that Plaintiff, Yatra Online Inc. (“Yatra”), asserts was sabotaged post-signing by Defendants, Ebix, Inc. and EbixCash Travels, Inc. after Ebix determined the deal was no longer attractive.Delays were encountered as an S-4 was awaiting SEC clearance and Ebix sought to renegotiate certain matters. Fed up with Ebix’s behavior during the extended renegotiations, and after the final outside closing date lapsed, Yatra terminated the Merger Agreement and filed a lawsuit against Ebix. The complaint included an action for breach of the Merger Agreement amongst other things.The relevant provision of the merger agreement read as follows:“In the event of any termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, the obligations of the parties shall terminate and there shall be no liability on the part of any party with respect thereto, except for the confidentiality provisions of Section 6.4 (Access to Information) and the provisions of Section 3.26 (No Other Representations and Warranties; Disclaimers), Section 4.17 (No Expenses), this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 (Termination Fees) and Article IX (General Provisions), each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect; provided, however, that, subject to Section 8.3(a)(iii), nothing contained herein shall relieve any party from liability for damages arising out of any fraud occurring prior to such termination, in which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or equity. The parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Section 8.2 shall be deemed to affect their right to specific performance under Section 9.9 prior to the valid termination of this Agreement. In addition, the parties agree that the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 in accordance with its terms.”Ebix argued that Yatra’s decision to terminate the Merger Agreement barred its claims for breach of contract. Yatra responded that the phrase “with respect thereto” can reasonably be read to modify “any termination of this Agreement” (as opposed to “obligations”). Under this construction, the provision cannot be understood to eliminate damages owed for prior breaches of “obligations,” but only damages caused by the act of terminating the Merger Agreement.The Court found Yatra’s reading of the provision stretched the words beyond their tolerance. The comma following “Section 8.1” breaks the sentence, reading naturally to indicate the Merger Agreement’s drafters intended the phrase “with respect thereto” to modify “the obligations of the parties” as opposed to “any termination of this agreement.”Yatra’s position—that the provision only extinguished liability arising from “any termination of this Agreement”—was inconsistent with the language immediately following “with respect thereto,” which “except[s]” certain obligations under the Merger Agreement, as specifically enumerated, from the effects of the contractual limitation of liability. That clause would be superfluous if the effect of the provision was to limit liability only arising from the act of terminating the Merger Agreement.Moreover, contrary to Yatra’s contention that termination leaves claims for breach of contract based on prior acts unaffected, the Court noted Section 8.2 expressly carved out only liability for “fraud occurring prior to such termination,” implying that liability for all other claims (including contract based claims) for acts “occurring prior” to termination did not survive post-termination.The Court also considered the precedent set by AB Stable VIII LLC v. Maps Hotels & Resorts One LLC. The court in AB Stable expressly observed that “[u]nder the common law, termination results in an agreement becoming void, but that fact alone does not eliminate liability for a prior breach.” The court went on to explain that when parties include a provision stating that “there shall be no liability on the part of either party” upon termination, they “alter[] the common law rule” and “broadly waive[] contractual liability and all contractual remedies.”"
"Meanwhile, we will continue to see our consulting unit benefit from the implementation as we work with the carriers. Also in Q2 2020, RBC Wealth Management deployed the AnnuityNet solution. And we are seeing a steady flow of requests from customers that are looking to digitize the order entry process. On the life illustration exchange, we added Forrester's Insurance, our first Canadian client on the platform.We are in discussions with several others in the market. We also signed up Zurich Insurance and Fidelity and Guaranty Life on the WinFlex analytics platform. We have at least another half a dozen carriers that are in various stages of evaluating our life analytics platform. Our life underwriting exchange was marginally up in Q2 relative to Q1. All our clients stayed stable and committed to the long-term transformational initiatives.We added Prudential Insurance to our life exchange platform."
"If the plan is to keep paying RR with cheap stock until he can take the company private at the expense of current shareholders, the plan is really working. If not please do something/anything to support the stock. Shorts have absolutely no fear of this company and management."
How many fraud companies pay a dividend? This could touch 40 this week I have a small long position in the 26-27 range
Why the steep drop today? I bought more shares because of it.
Quarter was better than good. Shorts playing games. PayPal might be interested .
took a beating on good earnings. only 23 M shares in float. earnings almost 400M debt 779 M and 14% short. Well if it gets low enough they can buy back all the stock. so what happends when all the issued stock is out of the market and the shorts still have 6M shares. How can you force shorters to buy back -- I dont think you can. Once they get the stock down low enough and buy back most of the shares all that can be done is pay massive dividends - make the shorters which they never owned the stock

However this will make HUGE losses of $300m.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/71572074.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppstSo we have an approx. Price/GMV valuation ratio of 0.5 for this transactionNow remember Ebix makes PROFITS in Ebix India. So this obviously should merit a higher P/GMV value.I expect EbixIndia GMV to be approx.for 2020 to be roughly $30bnThis is a very imprecise guesstimate, as we do not know the GMV of Ebix Travel in IndiaOne then has to add travel, GMV $10bn, giving a rough GMV of $30, THAT IS PROFITABLE.As from 2q ’19 transcript just about half the division (just remittances) has rev of $12bn .Our outward remittance, ForEx, inward remittance and retail card operation revenues sequentially grew quarter-over-quarter, not only individually, but also as a business unit. Cumulatively, the combined business unit sequentially grew its revenues 28% in Q1 2019 over Q4 2018. Between these units, we now handle gross merchandise value approximately $12 billion annually.SO ON A ROUGH CALC, EBIX INDIA ON A GMV RATIO OF 0.5 COMES TO $15BNDid you notice Ebix the entire company, EBIX US and INDIA HAS AN Enterprise value today of $1.7bnI have Nothing else to say"
"Dear Ebix investor relations The Bollywood Clowns and YatraPlease help me and readers understand the confusion regarding Yatra. As per your SEC disclosure, the Extension Date has expired. There has BEEN NO UPDATE, there has been a time lapse, so the deal is terminated as per your disclosures to the SEC. Yet on the conference call for 1q 2020 results, Chief Clown Raina says https://seekingalpha.com/article/4346251-ebixs-ebix-ceo-robin-raina-on-q1-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript""The courts basically issued an order on May 4th, and so we are working now with the court process that we have to follow and we are right now working with the court appointed resolution professionals to follow all of that. Coming back to Yatra, I've already said that basically we – the expiry date was May 4th. The date hasn't been extended as yet. I can't talk more about Yatra simply because we – whatever the next announcement is, we'll announce it at the right time, whatever the announcement is.We are highly limited, but what we can say at this minute because our attorneys – and we got to follow the confidentiality and the processes that we have to do between the both sides. ""So the deal has lapsed, the time line has passed, there is no new extension, AND YET YOU CLAIM YOU ARE LIMITED IN WHAT YOU SAY!!!"" DO YOU SEE THE TOTAL INCONGRUITY OF THIS For your shareholders? Ebix price is down another 12% yesterday, making it close to 85% capital destruction over 3 years. Yet you carry on with your clowning. Chief Clown Raina has the audacity to add:"" I can only tell you, rest assured that we want to – we will always want to protect our shareholder rights in anything we do.."" Do you see how ridiculous you appear and how investors perceive you. That's a rhetorical question."
"I’ve been in this since $21 (last November), and I thought this might happen with 25% short on a company that’s making good profit with a dividend, that’s both a value and growth play. Not to mention earnings release in 30 days...I’m holding until $70+."
"Shorts.... company is dirty...SEC clean exam 2017, Shorts....company is cheating IRS, IRS exam completed 2017, Shorts.....Company is deceiving auditors... EBIX hey let's switch from the guys we have been deceiving for years to go to a new top 5 firm, because hey what's the risk if we have been getting away with bad stuff for years and switching to a new audit firm with a new set of eyes scrutinizing every line item. Shorts stock is worthless....Robin hey why don't I hold onto my 3.8M shares and while i'm at it let my foundation hold onto another 3.2M shares with almost no sales ever....Shorts stock is worthless......Robin I'll take all of my compensation in stock no more cash salary for me.....just doesn't seem to add up does it!"
"This hits $75+ after ER. Growth and value. I added since $21 after last ER, and there’s plenty of positive momentum and plenty of short squeezing left. Good luck to all."
"Schizophrenic market activity in EBIX, as this bullish story (analyst targets are $46 (mkt perform) & $110 (buy) vs. $32.25 current price and $2.72 in LTM EPS and $4.21 in adjusted EPS (excluding 1-time items) - yet share action couldn't be more negative. Given the attention deficit of Wall Street as we cycle through the holidays to year end, combined with tax loss selling where Ebix is certainly vulnerable given its performance vs. the market - we very likely could see a great opportunity to buy the stock for newcomers and some pain and/or frustration for existing holders. Moving into 2020 and through the year it seems the stock should benefit from continued growth in the business each quarter, new business deal flow in insurance biz and at EbixCash, launch of BSE JV to sell insurance across 620,000 outlets in India, progress reports on Yatra acquisition effort, synergies/cross selling in EbixCash businesses, forex expansion at airports, ramping of earlier-stage entities in complementary areas and forward progress on EbixCash India IPO efforts, etc. But I'm a long-time shareholder and consultant to the Company - so not unbiased."
"Anyone have an update on the YTRA suit vs EBIX? I understand that the judge has until month's end to determine whether the suit moves forward. Thanks, Triplewitch"
"the low dividend - and continued ""investment"" to build more revenue does not benefit the current shareholders - and the lower the price per share , the more shares RR gets in place of his salary - for a large retirement - when the stock price eventually increases - this is not a stock for a 6 month / 2 year investor - this is for RR -"
great growth - outlook - and the stock goes down more ? what happened to $90 per share this year ?

"@jbardet'do you think EBIX's two bagger+ potential from here relies upon a more proactive IREbix has destroyed Investor trust by a litany of egregious blunders. That's clearly evident from share collapse, way before covid. It has to be rebuilt, along with scaring off the shorts. A once-in -a-decade opportunity was handed to them in the last week by the short panic Re GME. YES! IF they had any market savvy (cf appointing an Indian sweatshop auditor in 2019 to gloss over the cooking of their books via a series of dodgy Indian acquisitions) they WOULD HAVE CAPITALISED ON THE SHORT SCARE WITH SOME VALID ACCURATE INVESTOR PR ON THE COVID-AFFLICTED BIZS IN INDIA. You play the game by the rules of the game, and that game has a 25% of Ebix float as short. What don't you ( and the Clowns at Ebix management) understand? Share price is down about 40%!! In last 2 days as short panic dissipated. Yes Ebix could and should have been proactive in warding off the renewal of shorts conviction. I'm interested, what don't you agree with. This management has EXCELLED at incompetence in last 3 ish years, eroding the vestiges of any investor trust that could have been restored. What's your response? Thanks in advance."
"Anyone shorting EBIX is playing with fire. This will gradually go up from here, and when management does report strong, clean earnings it’s probably back to $50+. EBIX Cash IPO could send it flying."
EBIX issues update with great news and stock tanks again on low volume. You have to have a high tolerance for pain owning this stock. Management must start buying back or we will visit the 40’s again. Short sellers own EBIX.
"I noticed the huge open interest on put option contracts with a March 20 expiration date and have been adding a few shares on this drop. The manipulation continues. I can't be certain that it will end soon, but March 20 isn't that many days away. The shorts might choose to cover in conjunction with the expiration date. The Corona virus is being used along with lies about a lack of audit coverage for the quarters results.CatalystIR Mar. 4 at 8:25 PM We are not one for conspiracy theories but we have heard from more than one reputable source of heavy options activity in $EBIX a few weeks ago that would signal a coming short attack - and recent trading activity does seem VERY abnormal. Note a few minutes back their were about 17,000 open Put option contacts to sell 1.7M Ebix shares (9,000 or 900,000 shares of which expire March 20th in addition to a short position of 5,996,574 shares at 2/14/20 - which together represent about 25% of total shares out. We point out these factors because we are confident the audited fundamentals filed with the SEC are strong and do not warrant the share price swoon which is to some degree being orchestrated by those who stand to gain from the fear they are creating"
Watching level II trading today and the shorts refuse to let EBIX out of the penalty box. Trading at well below volume just makes it easy for the short interest. The only way to break this cycle is large insider or Corp buybacks. Retail investors have been so burned without management support.
"From EBIX Transcript: In Q1, we announced that we were in late stages of engaging with one of the largest distributors in the country. We are pleased to report that in Q2, we signed a master agreement with one of the largest banks in the U.S., JPMorgan Chase. This is a major deal that I referenced in my last call without providing the name at that time for confidentiality reasons.We are on track with the implementation to onboard JPMorgan onto the platform by Q4 of 2020. While specifics of this engagement cannot be disclosed due to confidentiality, all the carriers within the JPMorgan network have been notified and we are working closely with them to set up their products on the exchange. We expect a healthy uptick in transactional revenue once the implementation is completed in Q4."
Another great quartet but no real answer about IPO!Some thoughts. Ebix’s cab and bus business in India….wonder if the likes of Uber or Let might have interest in acquiringt that?Many individual Ebixcash businesses have partnerships with competitors like Paytm. How productiveare those partnerships and will that eventually lead them to acquire Ebixcash prior to an IPO.

"A MarketBeat posting on the plight of the shorts: Stuart60611 Oct. 30 at 2:52 PM $EBIX Looks to me like shorts are making a full court press today. Will know for sure tomorrow when short data for today is released, but it sure looks that way based on the typical high volume. 6 months or so before the Indian IPO when it will game over for the shorts. Based on the news flow, a lot of new deals and new revenue streams coming online very near term. These new sources of revenue will provide a nice catalyst for the IPO whose road show has yet to even begin. Soon Yatra will close, Ebix will pass its yearly audit, and the international IPO underwriter will be named. BNSL receivable will also be likely paid near term based on the big injection of capital to BNSL from the Indian government. Ebix numbers should really impress in the coming next couple of quarters. The short thesis is falling apart on every level and about to completely and irrevocably implode. The short covering that will soon happen is going to send share price up massively!"
"you may recall that Ebix built PPL for Lloyd's underwriters, a big win in 2018 as the winner of a competitive tender in the Underwriting space. It was transformational for Lloyd's from going to on-face to digital. PPL was powered by Ebix.PPL has now transitioned to phase 2, where they needed a specialist insurer to upgrade the platform. They have just chosen Deloitte. But AFAIW, THE BACKBONE IS STILL BUILT POWERED AND MAINTAINED BY EBIX.IT WOULD BE NICE IF EBIX IR CLARIFIED ON THISPPL to partner with Deloitte to build NextGen platformhttps://www.insuranceinsider.com/article/293lib38u539mb1exwykg/ppl-to-partner-with-deloitte-to-build-nextgen-platformMarcel Le Gouais | 24 September 2021The PPL board has decided to partner with Deloitte to build its NextGen platform, in a long-awaited decision on how it will deliver a pivotal component of the London market’s modernisation.Insurance Insider had previously revealed that Whitespace and Deloitte were in a two-horse race for the PPL NextGen contract and this morning PPL’s board finally came to a decision, which had to be unanimous for the project to proceed.Bronek Masojada, chair of the PPL board, said: “This was an important decision for the market in its journey towards more efficient and effective electronic placement of risk.“PPL has undertaken extensive work to look at the two main options available: to continue to build our own platform or to partner with an existing offering. The pros and cons for each choice were explored thoroughly and presented to the board.“The choice of Deloitte offers the market the control that it wants on the development of the platform – both now, and in the future, and a partner that has been deeply involved in the build so far, offering expertise and continuity.“We are very much looking forward to building on the strong work done so far on NextGen and delivering the platform that the market wants and needs.”"
"Now that the Annual Meeting has been scheduled for August 15 and the auditors payment schedule is posted for stockholders and the SEC to see, do the shorts really believe that there is a problem with past accounting? The Yatra merger seems to be one that expands earnings growth without doing damage to the balance sheet other than some minor dilution. I've been adding shares."
The more they short the more the stock goes up....This can't be good for short prospects.
$EBIX this is a great opportunity to average down or enter... short squeeze will be epic! This company didn’t have a good quarter or a good year.. they have already 5 years constant growth! It’s insane! PE is 10 which is unheard of... plus dividends. Say thank you for once in a life time opportunity $TRIT $FROG $ASAN $SUMO
"Steve, regarding the IPO, I have asked EBIX what this means for us existing shareholders. They said they dont know. Rania is using our shareholder equity to finance exansion that falls under Ebiscash, the entity that they will IPO. Logic would say if you sell off half the compny the sareholders would get that half but they aren’t saying that. Could be the great stock robbery of 2019"
"EBIX down on change in auditor???????From my understanding they are going to switch to a top 5 auditing team. I don't see how this can be a downer, but dealing with a foreign stock any news is met with uncertainty. Does anyone else have info or an opinion?"
"Good NewsAsh Sawhney, President - Insurance Solutions North America said, ""We are pleased that Liberty Bankers chose the EBIX platform for Annuity Processing after looking at various solutions in the market. AN4 is today the most widely used Annuity exchange in the United States. We continue to see good momentum on our Annuity Exchange since we released the new AN4 platform. This is the fifth new carrier on the platform that we have announced this year.”Ash added, “With each carrier addition, Ebix generates multiple streams of revenue, including license fees, professional services, and recurring transactional fees. It also opens up new streams of revenue from distributors that are part of the carrier network as well as opportunities for consulting and platform-based process outsourcing."""
"As a retired MBA/Corporate Finance guy, I see the panic selling in EBIX as a major investor overreaction to a few minor, nit-picking issues by an outside auditor--not a big deal. Analysts have rated EBIX as a Buy (2) rating with an average Target Price of $54. I bought 300 shares at $28 this morning. Great time to buy!"
"Opening up their books and records to 5 investment banks. They will review audit files, transactions verify balances. SEC and IRS concluded their investigation years ago. The short thesis is dead, now its just stock manipulation tactics."
"Value destroyers are running this outfit. During one of the greatest bull markets of all time, Ebix has lost 42% of its value over the past 5 years. It is down 71% from its 2-year high and has lost 59% in the past 4 months. This type of performance should be criminal…BOD is not doing its job."
Rupee has appreciated 5% in the last month vs the US dollar should bode well for earnings.
"To EBIX management: Now that we have lost more than 1/3 of our value, I think it’s time for that repurchase. My understanding is that job one is supposed to be supporting shareholders value. Please help !!"
It must be a great feeling to be short EBIX. management seems to have a long term plan but hasn’t a clue how to manage the shorts. Us bag holders have no option but to watch the slow carnage.
"I believe they will have 100M in revenue next qtr. Their EPS took a hit with all the marketing/ads for Ebixcash in India and acquisition related costs. They didn't reflect Paul Merchants, Wall Street or Via in Q3. an additional 7M in revenue @ 30% margin is 2.1M to the bottom line, which is .07 additional EPS over the previous qtr .76 Q3 eps + .07 EPS makes EPS .83 for the coming qtr. Love this company!!!! Have for years."

"8-K filed yesterday (4/15) by EBIX provides that financial statements don't need to be delivered to the bank until May 15, 2021 (not April) in the new 12th Amendment to the Credit Agreement.If Ebix plans to delay its release of audited financial statement until mid-May, which can be inferred from this amendment to the Credit Agreement, then Ebix should release this information clearly and appropriately, not in this cagy and backhanded manner."

nay news?
Been a long time holder of ebix and everytime one of these fly by night ambulance chasers or short attack tools announces a conspiracy theory and people jump ship but nothing ever sticks. I was concerned for the first year or 2 but I believe RR is a straight shooter who uses every advantage to the companies benefit. so far so good.
"However, the real big opportunity in insurance is ahead of us in India in the form of our Bombay Stock Exchange, BSE-Ebix insurance exchange venture. Recently, we announced that we have secured approval from the insurance regulators for the BSE-Ebix venture to be deployed in India. This is possibly going to be one of our biggest ventures ever from my perspective. The BSE-Ebix venture is targeting to handle insurance distribution and back-end insurance processing in a manner and scale that has never been attempted in India with 300,000 BSE terminals across who's who of India's financial institutions and 320,000 EbixCash franchises across the length and breadth of India. We are attempting to take insurance sales to the last mile in every nook and corner of the country into rural areas, last-mile street, across all cities, banks, agents, stockbrokers, wealth management advisers, et cetera. The BSE-Ebix business model on the distribution of insurance will focus on a pure commission-based model since that is the most lucrative financially while selling life, property and casualty, equipment, travel and health insurance, et cetera, to the prospective 1.3 billion population of the country.Recently, a mid-sized insurance distributor in India with approximate revenues of $60 million decided to launch its IPO in India and got valued at $1.5 billion. The valuation was based on the opportunity ahead of this distributor. We believe that what we are attempting with BSE is way larger and expansive than this distributor. Besides, we have India's most trusted and oldest financial institution by our side in the form of Bombay Stock Exchange. More on this later.We are presently trying to draw a balance between our efforts to grow our EbixCash margins and our attempts to be a leader in the market. EbixCash performance is particularly noteworthy when compared it to its key competitors with high valuations, who collectively lost $1 billion last year in the Indian market and delivered much less top line growth than EbixCash. We are clearly very pleased with our EbixCash growth story and where we are headed with it. Let me give you 3 examples to illustrate how aggregation, network effect and leadership leads to new revenue streams, substantial opportunities and great operating margins.Example one is a remittance deal from the past year with an international money transfer operator who paid EbixCash a $16 million signing bonus to get access to just 35,000 of our franchisee network. That was pure profit added for the signing bonus, and the actual remittance transaction got us our traditional charges anyway as an addition.Example two is a recent deal we announced with a few travel exchange players, wherein we got paid in advance of $25 million with a committed transaction fee arrangement of $75 million upward over the next 5 years based on commitments from us in terms of volumes of segments that we will provide to them.The aggregation and fee arrangement allows us now to consolidate the market and also aggressively grow our travel business with the awareness that we can make these additional fees beyond our traditional travel commissions and other fee payments. It also opens up an opportunity for us to pass part of these fees to the consumer and price our competition out while booking commissions on business that we may not have otherwise secured.The third example is -- of an aggregation deal, is a deal that we are presently negotiating in the financial services arena wherein we want country level exclusivity and possibly a large signing bonus to provide a large international financial services player access to our franchisee network in India. More on this when we finalize the deal.We are very proud about the emerging status of EbixCash today as the largest end-to-end financial exchange in the Indian subcontinent. We are fully aware of the responsibility that comes with being a leader in any segment. Towards that extent, I recently led the financial industry's efforts in India to convince the Finance Minister of India to successfully reverse a tax at source on remittance operators. This tax had been announced by the government of India in early 2019 during its budget announcement, causing a lot of heartburn amongst the remittance franchises.EbixCash and myself took the lead towards laying the industry's concerns to the finance ministry. And thanks to the humility and prudent approach of the government, the tax was canceled on 16 October 2019, through a government notification. We thank the government of India for listening to the industry.We have a number of material key initiatives that are expected to add substantially to our EbixCash revenue and income stream in the coming quarters. I'll name a few for you. One, a multi-million dollar agreement that we have in hand today for the UAE airport ForEx counters where we await central bank approval. We also are in the midst of the acquisition of Trimax bus exchange, wherein"

"140k shares short covered from 4/15 to 4/30. I'm not sure what they are clinging too, IRS exam concluded, SEC concluded, 30% operating Margins, Cash flow robust, Q1 revenue was $143M at the pace that's $570M , but they guided to $800M run rate by Q4 (included $30M from prospective acquisitions in that qtrly number), that's a lot of growth trades around a current PE of 13 based on non-gaap eps of 1.04, buying back stock (avg price around $44), CEO taking all stock compensation (no cash until stock price gets to $150, signing lots of new deals and this looming IPO Q1 2020 target could crush the shorts, I mean really crush them. Assuming $800M annual run rate in q4 the forward PE will be under 10 at today's price. If your sitting on the fence, go long there are a lot of built in buyers, around 7.4M shares will need to cover, the eps growth, margin stability, cash flow generation and looming IPO its all lining up against them. Reminds me of the Kevin Costner movie No Way out."
is it there are very few buyers ? extraordinary - this company has fallen off the radar - folks have lost interest in this company because of management
is it time for RR to go ?
"i've been around ebix since before the last 3 for 1 split. the one thing that is very refreshing about mgnt is usually when they announce they are buying a company they give much more detail then most other companies. We owners want to know this, i like it. Let's see where this offer goes."
Crushed it. This will be an epic squeeze in the coming months. 7M shorts / 40+% of the float

Listened to the earnings call recording last night. While I like Robins vision his communication skills are lacking. May be time to turn the CEO role to someone who can deliver more succinct message to analysts and shareholders alike.
Typical short action down over 2% on small volume. Hope we take them to the woodshed when earnings are announced.
http://ebixcash.com/ebixcash-prepaid-card.htmlGreat info for investors of Ebixcssh. Most of India still can’t handle digital payments w their existing phones so this is a the prepaid card is the way to go.

(EBIX - $32.77 intraday – BUY - $110 Price Target) Trading at ~13x PE on GAAP ’20 earnings, we believe shares are a coiled spring entering 2020 as the fundamentals have improved and embedded call options have grown in number while the shares continue to lag. The US based insurance business is expected to grow 8 – 10% in ’20, solidly reversing the flat to modest declines on the top-line over the last two years. New leadership and focus in the US business appears to be taking hold and is likely to be a key part of the Ebix story in 2020. The recent takeout of top US insurance competitor iPipeline by private equity (20.3x EBITDA) pins the valuation of the domestic Ebix business alone at ~$61/shr."

So they paid $10M for Trimax and its operating income for the year will be $10. Now that is the type of acquisition i can get behind.
Fantastic numbers.
cant afford this.. gonna drop it if we see further losses. No reason for price reduction. 42.50 and I gone!!
"MSCI's India Index trades at 17 times earnings. Ebix Cash with $450M in sales (run rate projected by Robin Q4 2019) @ 20% gross margins (lets be conservative here, should really use 30% margins which they are currently running at) = $90M X 17 pe multiple equals $1.5B. $1.5B is the current market for all of Ebix and 75% of their enterprise value. This is a powder keg that will blow up in the shorts faces. I can't believe they are going to destroy their careers and risk their fund investors capital with such a clearly impending event on the horizon. With 36% of the float short, there are a lot of built in buyers to go along with an enormous buy back that will take place late 2019/ early 2020 IMO."
does anyone know how we might learn how the current Ebix stockholders will be rewarded with the EbixCash IPO ? are we just providing the financing for RR to get richer ? will we receive shares of EbixCash ? will be get a lump sum dividend ? will we be left behind ? how will the current shareholders fair by splitting off a chunk of the money source ?
"Chart is starting to look predictable on a daily basis...shorts try to take down in the morning, but learning they can’t by end of day. Touching $50+ by end of week, in my opinion."
I received my email proxy vote this AM. I voted against RR and the BODs. Time for SHs to be proactive and remove them. Raina and the BODs have ignored their fiduciary duties to SHs. SHs have lost many millions in share equity due to Raina's governance and the lapdog BODs. VOTE WITHHOLD (AGAINST) RAINA AND THE BODS.

"any idea how long it takes for the investigating firms to finish their audit? If their results come out fine, the stock can get a big boost. Alternatively, the mgmt can think of paying special dividend or announce buyback. I guess they will quickly need to come up with a strategy (even before the earnings). 40% yesterday, 24% today, these are humongous drops."
"probably expect securities commission to do an investigation on them mayput ahalt on stock ormayban stock ,when your auditor quit after management refuse to give paper for usual transactions , then i see an investigation coming soon if management dont explain the 30 million unusual transaction.,plustheycannotdo thierquarterly report or yearly report unless they explian the30 million unusual transactions"
SOMETHING GOING DOWN AT EBIX....tiny vol and up 4%Does anyone know whats up?thanks in advancebtw there are still 7m shares short.THAT IS HUUUUGE - 20 days trading volume during which the short could lose +100% if there is a rush to cover!!
If you listened to the call yesterday it’s no wonder these were the price results. While the numbers were great my 2nd grader could have presented the results better and addressed questions succinctly. Lots of rambling. Robin needs to focus on strategy and pass the CEO role to someone with more polish!
"Afternoon action should take this to $30+. Not worried, but I would feel better if we knew they satisfied Nasdaq requirements and had accounting firm sign off on audited report. Need the 10-K."
Wow...what happened here? I was not expecting this to be back in $30’s. How many auditors does EBIX need? Business looks great...management not so much.
don't recall a 4 % drop in one day - and not on light light volume - need company news offset - raise dividend -
"Ebix: Reject The Equity Incentive Plan For Personal Enrichment Of CEOAug. 31, 2020 11:34 AM ETSummaryThis article focuses on the voting at a shareholders meeting on 14th September 2020.Ebix is compelled to require a shareholder vote, not due to a need to address gross corporate misgovernance, but because a 10-year clause needs your vote.The board of directors has illustrated a total lack of accountability to the true owners of Ebix, the shareholders; it is subservient to the whims of a dominant CEO.Vote ‘No’ to the re-election of the same band of ineffective directors.Vote ‘No’ to the Equity Incentive Plan which would award the CEO an 8-digit bonus this instant on a takeover, while shareholders have suffered a 60% loss of capital."
The recent Simply Wall St article suggests that Ebix is under-valued with a PE of 12.95 and the peers at a PE of 49.66Were Ebix to have the same PE as its peers - the Ebix stock price would be 3.83 times current price - or $132 per share
Decent call..the 10-K filed later today should answer any concerns.
Does anyone know when EBIX is reporting? Thought it was supposed to be yesterday.
"according to the company there is no issue, full recovery today?"
Was on the call today but didn’t understand comment about a future IPO in India?
"More good news:bombaywala46 Oct. 28 at 12:45 PM $EBIX CH: Ash Sawhney (appointed President of North America on 8/28/18) is rapidly remaking the base/legacy Ebix business (new people and process) and we believe the probability of top-line acceleration has greatly increased. Services have been the challenge for this unit as the company has worked to push away from staff augmentation type engagements to be more focused on higher value project work. We believe the bulk of the pain has been felt here and we have put in a bottom with respect to the associated revenue pressures. Following a range of discussions, we believe Ash has focused on building/training the sales team to “solution sell”, as opposed to operating in individual silos or on individual products. In addition, we believe much has been done to streamline/improve common CRM visibility and to enable broader/more robust and more precise pipeline tracking."
Which firm will cover first Bodenholm or Viceroy?
i think this will hit 80$ that was my price target way back when it was 24$ I was in the comments here saying its undervalued

"Nice bump today on no news. There is no reason for EBIX not to get back into mid-upper 80s. I thought it might be possible for EBIX to hit $100 by the end of this month. Too bad EBIX didn't cooperate. It will be interesting to hear Q2 results the first week or two in August. EBIX needs to establish a solid base around $85, then edge up from there. Huge potential, but just need some more analysts touting EBIX potential."
"my article about to be published on seeking alphaEbix Will Walk From Yatra- If Shareholders' Interests PrevailSince my last absurdly bullish article on February ‘18, Ebix has lost +80% of its valueReason: Over 3 years, an Indian CEO led the company to a promising opportunity in India, but the acquisitions have been extravagant, were poorly integrated, thus decimating shareholder valueYatra could well be the terminal blunder. In July ’19 Ebix committed to pay $338m (cash). The buyout currency, Ebix shares, have lost 80%, but a collar fixed the price.Yatra is a loss-making e-commerce business focused on international travel. Nothing should be more obvious than to walk, using exit clauses in the deal. Sound hopeless? Wait, just a few changes in governance could unlock a three-bagger in Ebix.Alas a leniant BOD has allowed an extravagant and poorly integrated takeover binge, neglecting their responsibility to shareholders. It is my honest opinion that Raina’s judgement has been severely impaired in India. One can only wonder why a CEO would wear orange sunglasses, with a shirt unbuttoned to his navel, to a company gala supper. But I digress, the CEO needs better oversight and discipline from a competent BOD.https://seekingalpha.com/author/sunil-shah#regular_articles"

Times of India Sep 23, 2019 Travel bug hits small town India: Tourism demand sees spurt .. HIGHLIGHTS In one year, the demand for doorstep delivery of visas across India grew by 144%, with the highest demand coming from Goa, Lucknow, Nagpur, Bhubaneswar, Mangaluru and Gurgaon . NEW DELHI: If you are familiar with the remarkable story of Vijayan, the 69-year-old tea stall owner from Kochi who has travelled to over 20 countries with his wife despite his meagre means, you’ll know travel and wanderlust is no longer the domain of the privileged few. As more Indians hit the road to explore uncharted territories for work or holiday, it is travellers from the farthest corners of the country who want to be out and about. What’s more, travel companies have spotted this fast-growing market and are rolling out the red carpet to woo the backpacker and the budget traveller, the adventure enthusiast and well as the luxury vacationer."
Wow about 10 M new shorts on 31 M float. This should move the shorts to near 50% . If some one with a lot of cash wanted to make some quick $$ they could buy the 750 million of outstanding stock this would cause a short squeeze the shares. Could go to 200 fast. the purchaser would reap 3* 750 for a tidy profit. Just make sure your a Dem because Then its not a crime.
"The time has come to have a management change at EBIX. First - two years ago a 3 for 1 stock split was announced and then retracted. Last year a 5 for 1 stock split was announced and nothing has happened for that one. The management team is not worried about the investor for their company, they are only worried about themselves. It is time for the Board Of Directors to do their duties and remove the current management team. The stock keeps going down, no stock splits executed and no dividend increase. How long are the stock holders going to allow this to continue ?????"
"There are two things that are beneath the revenue and profit. First, whether the management has integrity. Second, whether the growth by acquisition strategy is right one. The two may be interconnected. Some companies use acquisition cooking the book like GE in the 90s and early 2000s. The numbers of this company look good but it seems the market does not trust the numbers. We may be in a little binary situation. It could be very good or very bad."
When Yatra is finalized this could jump 20% in a week easily. That is the barrier to the IPO once that is cleared it's lights out for shorts.
"Is it not apparent that RR has no incentive now to promote the company to have the PPS increase ? - as he is being paid in shares - if the stock is 1/3 of it true value - he gets paid 3 Xs his salary - and ""down the road"" - he can cash in - in the meantime - us small loyal investors take the short stick - RR is no dummy - he uses Ebix for HIS advantage - and this is why Wall Street stays away"
I have no position in this stock. came across and checking it out. something I have noticed lately is the number of lawsuits filed just before earnings against companies. not just this stock but tons. its constantly and every time puts the breaks on the stock. just throwing that out there. wish you longs good luck I'll do some dd and see about buying some options before earnings.
"'Ebix Is A Strong Buy Here After Auditor RSM's Exit""https://seekingalpha.com/article/4414354-ebix-is-strong-buy-after-auditor-exitummaryEbix, in the last three years, has faced a number of challenges, many of them I would categorize as missteps by management.The dramatic resignation of their auditor (RSM) was the latest (self-inflicted) crisis. Their departure strongly implied impropriety, and a 40% collapse in market value added more salt to shareholder wounds.Yet a close examination of RSM’s rationale revealed the crisis might have been easily avoided. Also, the issues raised strongly suggest Ebix's incompetence rather than something graver, as RSM implied.If Ebix’s 2020 results remain largely intact, the current share price is a strong buy. Read why.But hurry up, the clearance sale is likely to end by April 20th, the proposed date for audited 2020 results by the newly appointed auditor."

Following the flurry of acquisitions since May’17, the EbixCash business is starting to take shape, with much tighter product integration and improving cross-sell. In addition, management bench strength was on full display as more than 50 managers took the stage and shared their outlooks on competitive landscape, industry direction, growth opportunities, and more. For the legacy/core business, substantive changes made by new (Aug’18) leader Ash Sawhney appear to be taking hold.
