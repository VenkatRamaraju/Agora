Viceroy research is the firm with the big short interest.
"QUESTION IF we can trust mgmt , IS THE date of 1q '22 for IPO STILL ONor is it dependent on covid decline?what is the current statement by mgmt?thanks in advance"
"Q2 revenue annualized is 498M and the eps annualized is 3.68, with 2019 forecasted revenue of 650M in 2019 that is 650M/498M or a 1.3 factor 3.68eps x 1.30 = 4.80 eps in 2019, that takes us down to a PE of 13 for 2019. Ebix cash will be huge in 2020!"
"I have studied the short actions and listened to Viceroy podcasts and they tend to wait for some catalyst to attach too when shorting significant stock volumes. It seems they are using the tariff on steel, fruits and vegetables as a catalyst to cause panic by dumping/selling shares. Don't fall for it, EBIX reaffirmed $800M in revenue guidance at 30% gross margins that's $240M in operating income income less $40M in int expense gets you too $200M for FYE in 2020 with 30M shares OS that's around $6.50 in EPS for a PE of 7. Don't be a sucker the shorts are counting on it."
"@jbardet'do you think EBIX's two bagger+ potential from here relies upon a more proactive IREbix has destroyed Investor trust by a litany of egregious blunders. That's clearly evident from share collapse, way before covid. It has to be rebuilt, along with scaring off the shorts. A once-in -a-decade opportunity was handed to them in the last week by the short panic Re GME. YES! IF they had any market savvy (cf appointing an Indian sweatshop auditor in 2019 to gloss over the cooking of their books via a series of dodgy Indian acquisitions) they WOULD HAVE CAPITALISED ON THE SHORT SCARE WITH SOME VALID ACCURATE INVESTOR PR ON THE COVID-AFFLICTED BIZS IN INDIA. You play the game by the rules of the game, and that game has a 25% of Ebix float as short. What don't you ( and the Clowns at Ebix management) understand? Share price is down about 40%!! In last 2 days as short panic dissipated. Yes Ebix could and should have been proactive in warding off the renewal of shorts conviction. I'm interested, what don't you agree with. This management has EXCELLED at incompetence in last 3 ish years, eroding the vestiges of any investor trust that could have been restored. What's your response? Thanks in advance."
Just checked and there is still a large short (put) in options for March . We’ll see if people start dumping it
"Afternoon action should take this to $30+. Not worried, but I would feel better if we knew they satisfied Nasdaq requirements and had accounting firm sign off on audited report. Need the 10-K."
Watching level II trading today and the shorts refuse to let EBIX out of the penalty box. Trading at well below volume just makes it easy for the short interest. The only way to break this cycle is large insider or Corp buybacks. Retail investors have been so burned without management support.
Decent call..the 10-K filed later today should answer any concerns.
"Good NewsAsh Sawhney, President - Insurance Solutions North America said, ""We are pleased that Liberty Bankers chose the EBIX platform for Annuity Processing after looking at various solutions in the market. AN4 is today the most widely used Annuity exchange in the United States. We continue to see good momentum on our Annuity Exchange since we released the new AN4 platform. This is the fifth new carrier on the platform that we have announced this year.”Ash added, “With each carrier addition, Ebix generates multiple streams of revenue, including license fees, professional services, and recurring transactional fees. It also opens up new streams of revenue from distributors that are part of the carrier network as well as opportunities for consulting and platform-based process outsourcing."""
RSM a great choice for auditor. Chicago based.
My Guess --First Q Revenue 118 Million Earnings of .94 cents
Now that another good quarter is in the books we are down 17-18 % from the recent highs. I hope that EBIX management decides to give us some support. If they refuse to buy why not give us some positive news. I listened to a conference call full of positive news or so I thought. How about an update or two. The silence is deafening.
"Nice bump today on no news. There is no reason for EBIX not to get back into mid-upper 80s. I thought it might be possible for EBIX to hit $100 by the end of this month. Too bad EBIX didn't cooperate. It will be interesting to hear Q2 results the first week or two in August. EBIX needs to establish a solid base around $85, then edge up from there. Huge potential, but just need some more analysts touting EBIX potential."
Interesting isn’t the word you would use if you owned EBIX in the mid to upper 70’s. I think catastrophic would be a better term. Some positive news would be appreciated.

"It appears that the shorts are getting the message. Here's another from Marketbeat Social Media:ValueTrapeze Sep. 12 at 7:39 AM $EBIX short interest down 300,000 shares as of Aug 30! Short thesis is busted. September numbers likely to show even heavier covering. The trap is set and jaws are closing fast."
It's very interesting that they still have such a big revolving line of credit from YTRA offer. But actually small long term debt.
don't recall a 4 % drop in one day - and not on light light volume - need company news offset - raise dividend -
i think this will hit 80$ that was my price target way back when it was 24$ I was in the comments here saying its undervalued

One of the largest Insurance Exchange deals in company history is progressing ahead of plan. We have previously made mention that Ebix has signed what we believe is one of the largest deals in company history in the insurance business. On today’s call, the customer was noted to be “one of the largest banks in the country/world”, a large distributor with 15 life insurance carriers and 12 annuity carriers. The deal is expected to be live by the end of the year and it was noted that COVID has accelerated the timeline/progress. Both the PS work to get the customer up and live and the recurring revenue stream to come later on were noted to be in the “multi-millions.”"

We see this as a very lucrative and high margin intensive deal. MoneyGram will be handling the inward remittances and EbixCash will be doing the servicing job,” said Robin Raina, Chairman, Ebix, without disclosing the commission structure. Through this partnership, EbixCash is expecting to clock net revenues between $20-$35 million annually. “This is a very conservative estimate. We expect to scale up revenues further and could look at annual revenues of about $50m over the next 2-3 years via this partnership,” said Raina. “We intend to do a soft launch in the second week of February for the insurance business.

"Global payments paying 20 billion for Total systems....I believe this is the next market area for consolidation and Ebix is right there. Note, Global has a similar strategy across markets. Wishful thinking!"
great Q report. strong cash flow with such a bad business environment. It shows businesses underline resilience. It will play out great in 2 to 3 years.
Which firm will cover first Bodenholm or Viceroy?
"Look forward to the 10%+ pop tomorrow, although management will need to instill confidence from investors in the ER call in a couple of weeks."
does anyone know how we might learn how the current Ebix stockholders will be rewarded with the EbixCash IPO ? are we just providing the financing for RR to get richer ? will we receive shares of EbixCash ? will be get a lump sum dividend ? will we be left behind ? how will the current shareholders fair by splitting off a chunk of the money source ?
What are the chances that RR moves to India when EbixCash IPOs and guts Ebix ? leaving Ebix stockholders with a shell - and he is sitting pretty in India - never to return ?
Will the current Ebix shareholders get any of the EbixCash shares through the EbixCash IPO or Ebix will be keeping all the EbixCash shares and IPO proceeds?

(NASDAQ: EBIX), a leading international supplier of On-Demand software and E-commerce services to the insurance, financial, healthcare and e-learning industries, today announced that its joint venture with Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), Asia’s oldest exchange, has received formal approval for Certificate of Registration to act as a direct insurance broker (Life and General) under the IRDAI (Insurers Brokers) Regulations, 2018. The venture, branded as BSE-Ebix Insurance Broking Pvt. Ltd., will enable distribution outlets, wealth management advisors, Point of Sale Persons (PoSPs) to sell life and non-life insurance products.BSE-Ebix confirmed that it will soon announce a formal date for the go-live date of its distribution franchise.

"The time has come to have a management change at EBIX. First - two years ago a 3 for 1 stock split was announced and then retracted. Last year a 5 for 1 stock split was announced and nothing has happened for that one. The management team is not worried about the investor for their company, they are only worried about themselves. It is time for the Board Of Directors to do their duties and remove the current management team. The stock keeps going down, no stock splits executed and no dividend increase. How long are the stock holders going to allow this to continue ?????"
"The early evidence that the shorts were starting to cover is confirmed by this posting from Marketbeat social media:jeffhawthorne Sep. 25 at 6:46 AM $EBIX short interest for 9/13 was 7,357,431 shares, down from 7,609,391 on 8/30"
Wow about 10 M new shorts on 31 M float. This should move the shorts to near 50% . If some one with a lot of cash wanted to make some quick $$ they could buy the 750 million of outstanding stock this would cause a short squeeze the shares. Could go to 200 fast. the purchaser would reap 3* 750 for a tidy profit. Just make sure your a Dem because Then its not a crime.
Rupee has appreciated 5% in the last month vs the US dollar should bode well for earnings.
Don’t forget to vote against the Ebix Board of Directors. All of them deserve to get booted. Voting is happening right now.

"Debit card payments through POS terminals, or card reading machines — a good indicator of the adoption of digital payments for merchant transactions — increased to 366 million in July from 301 million in January, RBI data show.The growth in debit card payments through POS terminals is an interesting trend, showing that people have started using their cards more for direct purchases than only for withdrawing cash from ATMs, says Vivek Belgavi, FinTech leader at PwC India."
"Ebix Chairman, President and CEO Robin Raina said, “Essel Forex has a rich focus on the corporate clientele with strong partnerships with many leading banks. Their geographical, product and client overlap with EbixCash made the synergies rather compelling. We remain committed to establishing the Indian sub-continent’s largest Financial exchange and this is another step in that direction.”There are 1.3B people in India!"
"Looks like a huge spread between BMO Capital and CraigH. I wonder if they attended the same conference call or if BMO Capital is carrying water for the shorts? bombaywala46 Nov. 13 at 8:00 AM $EBIX For whatever it's worth. Here is CH commentary. Ebix, Inc. BUY (EBIX – $37.47 intraday) Price Target: $110 Encouraging Revenue Outlook Offset By Near Term Margin pressure. IPO On Track. 10x P/E Very Attractive. Maintaining BUY Rating And $110 Price Target. Bullish: o The US based Insurance Exchange business is expected to grow 8-10% in ’20, solidly reversing the declines of last year. This was a large point of investor concern over the trailing year. o The IPO remains on track for June or July of ’20. We’ve laid out thoughts on valuation here, suggesting $3B+ for the EbixCash unit alone (~$100/share to Ebix). o Yatra acquisition appears to remain on track for a close and was delayed by audits and other process related issues. o EbixCash business grew 23% y/y on an organic basis, excluding acquisitions since taking place in Q3’18 and beyond. This has not been broken out previously"
Only 25 million shares float- this will be squeezed to $60
"Schizophrenic market activity in EBIX, as this bullish story (analyst targets are $46 (mkt perform) & $110 (buy) vs. $32.25 current price and $2.72 in LTM EPS and $4.21 in adjusted EPS (excluding 1-time items) - yet share action couldn't be more negative. Given the attention deficit of Wall Street as we cycle through the holidays to year end, combined with tax loss selling where Ebix is certainly vulnerable given its performance vs. the market - we very likely could see a great opportunity to buy the stock for newcomers and some pain and/or frustration for existing holders. Moving into 2020 and through the year it seems the stock should benefit from continued growth in the business each quarter, new business deal flow in insurance biz and at EbixCash, launch of BSE JV to sell insurance across 620,000 outlets in India, progress reports on Yatra acquisition effort, synergies/cross selling in EbixCash businesses, forex expansion at airports, ramping of earlier-stage entities in complementary areas and forward progress on EbixCash India IPO efforts, etc. But I'm a long-time shareholder and consultant to the Company - so not unbiased."
"With solid, clean earnings and huge amount of short position (25%), my target for this is $50 by end of April. So undervalued."
"Here's a Motley Fool article that is being tweeted:bombaywala46 May. 2 at 8:05 AM $EBIX $MDXG $YTRA $GWRE 3 Bargain Stocks You Can Buy Today You shouldn't have to look for these high-quality companies in Wall Street's bargain bin, but that's exactly where you'll find them today. Ebix (NASDAQ:EBIX) stock has fallen 41% year to date. The maker of cloud-based software and services for the insurance industry now trades at a minuscule six times trailing earnings and 13 times free cash flows, and the company is valued a 1.1 times book value. I'm sorry, but that's a blatant error. The company's full-year sales rose 17% in 2019 and earnings increased by 7%. The coronavirus may trounce the insurance industry as a whole, but Ebix stands an arms-length away from that danger. Even a struggling health-insurance or life-insurance carrier will need to use Ebix's tools for processing claims and evaluating coverage risks. You don't have to take my word for it."
"Does anyone here know if the SEC is enforcing a policy against naked shorts? It is clear that two or more hedge funds are able to squeeze the price down because of the very limited amount of float and the low buying volume. I checked the options open interest numbers. For June expiration there are 1131 Put options contracts open at $45 and 1610 contracts open at $50. The number of call options open is small in comparison. When the auditor change was announced, the bears have taken full control of this stock by shorting and buying put options. I guess that this is legal, but it is no fun for us longs."
"i've been around ebix since before the last 3 for 1 split. the one thing that is very refreshing about mgnt is usually when they announce they are buying a company they give much more detail then most other companies. We owners want to know this, i like it. Let's see where this offer goes."
Just got back from India. The mobile wallet solution (Itzcash/ebixcash) is widely used. Will be interesting to see how this plays out in the long term against Paytm and others. The analysts should make a trip over there to get to see this phenomenon of cashless society
Why the PE is so low? I am buying it under 20.
"Ah, it's a Indian company, which likes to bribe clients for business. Probably that's what the gift cards were used for, thus, cannot not show to the auditor. May be EBIX would lose some big clients over this."

Times of India Sep 23, 2019 Travel bug hits small town India: Tourism demand sees spurt .. HIGHLIGHTS In one year, the demand for doorstep delivery of visas across India grew by 144%, with the highest demand coming from Goa, Lucknow, Nagpur, Bhubaneswar, Mangaluru and Gurgaon . NEW DELHI: If you are familiar with the remarkable story of Vijayan, the 69-year-old tea stall owner from Kochi who has travelled to over 20 countries with his wife despite his meagre means, you’ll know travel and wanderlust is no longer the domain of the privileged few. As more Indians hit the road to explore uncharted territories for work or holiday, it is travellers from the farthest corners of the country who want to be out and about. What’s more, travel companies have spotted this fast-growing market and are rolling out the red carpet to woo the backpacker and the budget traveller, the adventure enthusiast and well as the luxury vacationer."
Squeeze play once it starts but it may take bit of time!It does not happen right away. Shorts always wait until the squeeze starts due to margin calls to cover instead of covering when there is a lot of shares available as funds sell!GLTA in stock casino!
To Robin: How about taking some of those earnings and buying back some shares. It’s incredible how your company stock can be manipulated !!
Probably realistically need to get to 55 to squeeze shorts as most prob sold at 57 after the big drop. I think short will not pursue this stock anymore as all news points to higher returns.
"Steve, regarding the IPO, I have asked EBIX what this means for us existing shareholders. They said they dont know. Rania is using our shareholder equity to finance exansion that falls under Ebiscash, the entity that they will IPO. Logic would say if you sell off half the compny the sareholders would get that half but they aren’t saying that. Could be the great stock robbery of 2019"
Need to adjust the balance between additional investment and rewarding current investors - this is a great stock to own if you wish to realize a return years from now - yet - current investors - including for the past 3 - 5 years are bag holders - great to build a fortress - yet if there are no survivors to protect - then feed the patient - feed the patient now
T-minus 20 days until ER deadline. Any announcement from company that they are reporting early should send this higher. Shorts are on the clock to cover.

This market is weird at best. Hyped stocks with earnings or $1-2 a year with 30% growth are trading at $150++. This guy with earnings of $4+ trading at PE of 8?????
"I don't mean to be critical of RR. He and his team have worked hard and it shows. This was an excellent report and I believe that when the institution s read the numbers and look at the plan, the stock will be fine. I don't pretend to know how big money folks and MM's are able to manipulate a stock down, but it should be illegal."
"so many shorts to cover such little time before IPO up 4% on 300,000 shares just 23X this volume and they will close out their shorts, so hosed."
SOMETHING GOING DOWN AT EBIX....tiny vol and up 4%Does anyone know whats up?thanks in advancebtw there are still 7m shares short.THAT IS HUUUUGE - 20 days trading volume during which the short could lose +100% if there is a rush to cover!!
"any idea how long it takes for the investigating firms to finish their audit? If their results come out fine, the stock can get a big boost. Alternatively, the mgmt can think of paying special dividend or announce buyback. I guess they will quickly need to come up with a strategy (even before the earnings). 40% yesterday, 24% today, these are humongous drops."
nay news?
Any one knows the stock split date?
"EBIX price still at point post RSM audit resignationthe entire scandal has been put to bed, with NO misstatement or irregularitiesi.e there has been zero fallout from the RSM scandal.as ebix was around $50 before RSM, that is simply bizarre, l!!2q results tom at 11 am.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ebix-hosts-q2-investor-call-125500038.htmlIf EBIX posts a good report (shows growth, discloses segmental results & margins, and maintains its timeline for EBIXCASH IPO, we could be going somewhere...AND IF EBIX SCREWS UP AGAIN, EITHER OR 2Q RESULTS, OR COMMITMENT TO IPO FOR 1Q 2022Then....Ebix and the current clown troupe management can kiss goodbye to any institutional interestforever."
Hot off the press...https://www.ebix.com/press-release/ebix-subsidiary-ebixcash-commences-ipo-exercise
"EBIX down on change in auditor???????From my understanding they are going to switch to a top 5 auditing team. I don't see how this can be a downer, but dealing with a foreign stock any news is met with uncertainty. Does anyone else have info or an opinion?"
This will be back to $40 this week.. Hope you bought that dip
Imagine if Ranai announced shareholders of this date would get shares of the new IPO based on some formula based on total shares they anticipate. future shareholders would get something less. The result is nobody would sell and the shorts would get squeezed big time!
Why the steep drop today? I bought more shares because of it.
"WHEN WILL THIS MANAGEMENT STOP SCORING OWN GOALS???arrrghYet another 'misstep' by our Ebix Clown TroupeBut Has EBIX INFORMED ITS OWNERS, THE SHAREHOLDERS?NO!Supreme Court rejects Ebix’s plea to withdraw Rs 400 crore offer for Educomp https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/company/corporate-trends/supreme-court-rejects-ebixs-plea-to-withdraw-rs-400-crore-offer-for-educomp/articleshow/86192853.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=cppstThe Supreme Court has rejected Ebix’s plea to withdraw its Rs. 400 crore offer for Educomp Solutions Limited on Monday as per a court order. In its ruling, the Supreme Court stated it did not find merit in Ebix’s arguments that the resolution professional (RP) of Educomp, Mahender Khandelwal, had failed to disclose information about investigations into the company by law enforcement agencies."
"If the plan is to keep paying RR with cheap stock until he can take the company private at the expense of current shareholders, the plan is really working. If not please do something/anything to support the stock. Shorts have absolutely no fear of this company and management."
So they paid $10M for Trimax and its operating income for the year will be $10. Now that is the type of acquisition i can get behind.
Can U say pucked on. 600M in MC lost for 30M or so cash that is not missing just misplaced...Bottom fishing and short covering will give a pop tomorrow. Auditor resignation is not uncommon as it used to be...It should be interesting ER CC once they announce it this week for next week. ER is always un-audited until 10Q gets filed with SEC...Good Luck to all and do your due diligence always...

Listened to the earnings call recording last night. While I like Robins vision his communication skills are lacking. May be time to turn the CEO role to someone who can deliver more succinct message to analysts and shareholders alike.
Ebix: Low-Risk Way To Participate In Red Hot Indian IPO Markethttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4457882-ebix-participate-in-indian-ipo-market#comments
The market's reaction to nothing changing is evident - RR needs to be replaced - he is not concerned with shareholders - with the stock price low - and him being paid with shares - he gobbles up the company - the BOD is no doing their job - they are afraid of him - the legal system will get involved before this is over - RR has robbed the average shareholder - we were > $80 / share - now we are at $20 / shares - and no increase in the dividend - and the revenue has doubled - this is wrong wrong wrong -
"Is it time for RR to leave the company ? Is it time for new management ? he is being paid $4,000,000 per year - and the stock is down 70% from 2 years ago ?? Say what ?? I don;t need a handsome return 10 -15 years from now - I need one sooner - where is the buy back ?? what happened to the 6 for 1 split ? I don;t see the follow-thru - and he is making himself wealthy - yet not the stockholders"
"RR will probably make investors wait until next Friday after market close to release earnings and hold CC. RR seems to be interested only in RR, and not EBIX investors. The EBIX companies are solid, management needs a shakeup. Good luck to all."
Good to Know RR is piling up his shares as the small investors are going broke.
WHEN are the shorts going to buy back the shares they sold and did not own ? I suggest longs hold hold hold hold hold - hold today - hold tomorrow AND hold until we pass $150 / share - then sell some of your shares !
"I believe they will have 100M in revenue next qtr. Their EPS took a hit with all the marketing/ads for Ebixcash in India and acquisition related costs. They didn't reflect Paul Merchants, Wall Street or Via in Q3. an additional 7M in revenue @ 30% margin is 2.1M to the bottom line, which is .07 additional EPS over the previous qtr .76 Q3 eps + .07 EPS makes EPS .83 for the coming qtr. Love this company!!!! Have for years."

What a relief!, Remember this is a recurring revenue stream. It should NEVER have negative yoy or qoq comparisons. Tell VP of that lest he forget again!! Ebix cash also had smart qoq which is anticipated. However non gaap margin - 28% - excluding non recurring costs is materially Below your target of 30%.And why did you buy a mere 45k shares around 40$. When you have guaranteed a price of ""$51 to Yatra buyout. You need to explain this v clearly in your cc. Best Ss"
"you may recall that Ebix built PPL for Lloyd's underwriters, a big win in 2018 as the winner of a competitive tender in the Underwriting space. It was transformational for Lloyd's from going to on-face to digital. PPL was powered by Ebix.PPL has now transitioned to phase 2, where they needed a specialist insurer to upgrade the platform. They have just chosen Deloitte. But AFAIW, THE BACKBONE IS STILL BUILT POWERED AND MAINTAINED BY EBIX.IT WOULD BE NICE IF EBIX IR CLARIFIED ON THISPPL to partner with Deloitte to build NextGen platformhttps://www.insuranceinsider.com/article/293lib38u539mb1exwykg/ppl-to-partner-with-deloitte-to-build-nextgen-platformMarcel Le Gouais | 24 September 2021The PPL board has decided to partner with Deloitte to build its NextGen platform, in a long-awaited decision on how it will deliver a pivotal component of the London market’s modernisation.Insurance Insider had previously revealed that Whitespace and Deloitte were in a two-horse race for the PPL NextGen contract and this morning PPL’s board finally came to a decision, which had to be unanimous for the project to proceed.Bronek Masojada, chair of the PPL board, said: “This was an important decision for the market in its journey towards more efficient and effective electronic placement of risk.“PPL has undertaken extensive work to look at the two main options available: to continue to build our own platform or to partner with an existing offering. The pros and cons for each choice were explored thoroughly and presented to the board.“The choice of Deloitte offers the market the control that it wants on the development of the platform – both now, and in the future, and a partner that has been deeply involved in the build so far, offering expertise and continuity.“We are very much looking forward to building on the strong work done so far on NextGen and delivering the platform that the market wants and needs.”"
"This was posted at the Marketbeat Social tab this morning:ValueTrapeze Sep. 5 at 8:57 AM $EBIX shorts are in denial about what is happening. Ebix has retained top-tier underwriters who will sell 25% of Ebixcash in the IPO for ~$500m. I suspect use of proceeds will be about $300m to pay down inter-company debt back to Ebix Inc., and the remaining $200m will be retained as growth capital. This IPO will substantially de-lever Ebix, and provide a transparent valuation benchmark for Ebixcash for U.S. investors to properly value Ebix Inc. New analyst coverage in India and in the U.S. (legacy Yatra coverage + whatever international IPO underwriter joins the syndicate) will draw in more investors in a virtuous cycle. · Reply"

"Interesting action today. I expected the opposite, honestly. I still think this is a huge candidate for a short squeeze, once it gets on people's radar."
Held above yesterday's low...good sign.
Ebix is still under value at this level. Shorts are wrong on Ebix.
"Very good 4th qtr and '17 results. From Yahoo, ""Q4 2017 diluted EPS increased 11% to $0.84 from $0.76 in Q4 2016. Full year 2017 diluted EPS increased 11% to $3.17 from $2.86 in 2016."" Also, Robin said some 4th quarter acquisitions revenues had not been fully realized in the quarter and EBIX incurred one time expenses for the acquisitions. Looking forward to tomorrow's CC. You can hear the CC live. Just log into EBIX.com and click the appropriate link."
"Is it not apparent that RR has no incentive now to promote the company to have the PPS increase ? - as he is being paid in shares - if the stock is 1/3 of it true value - he gets paid 3 Xs his salary - and ""down the road"" - he can cash in - in the meantime - us small loyal investors take the short stick - RR is no dummy - he uses Ebix for HIS advantage - and this is why Wall Street stays away"

"I noticed the huge open interest on put option contracts with a March 20 expiration date and have been adding a few shares on this drop. The manipulation continues. I can't be certain that it will end soon, but March 20 isn't that many days away. The shorts might choose to cover in conjunction with the expiration date. The Corona virus is being used along with lies about a lack of audit coverage for the quarters results.CatalystIR Mar. 4 at 8:25 PM We are not one for conspiracy theories but we have heard from more than one reputable source of heavy options activity in $EBIX a few weeks ago that would signal a coming short attack - and recent trading activity does seem VERY abnormal. Note a few minutes back their were about 17,000 open Put option contacts to sell 1.7M Ebix shares (9,000 or 900,000 shares of which expire March 20th in addition to a short position of 5,996,574 shares at 2/14/20 - which together represent about 25% of total shares out. We point out these factors because we are confident the audited fundamentals filed with the SEC are strong and do not warrant the share price swoon which is to some degree being orchestrated by those who stand to gain from the fear they are creating"
Nice time to buy ?
"It's really hard to figure out a reason behind such a drop, particularly post the earnings call which rather went well. 10K was filed, the audit rumours were addressed, the company beat revenue big time. The stock was rising before the earnings, don't know what was said during the call that caused the stock to drop so much. Pandemic can also not be attributed to such a drop because the other indices are holding much better comparatively."
RR talked about salaries - did not hear any mention of him not accepting a paycheck until the stock price hit $150 per share - as he stated he would do - some time ago - if he is now paid with shares as he said - then when he resumes paying himself a paycheck again - salary expense goes up - margins goes down When does he think the PPS will be $150 per share ?
can / would anyone chime in on the topic of how the ipo would impact share price for current stockholders ? I have tried to call Investor relations and sent an email - yet neither methods get a response - no phone answer - no return email message - maybe someone here -- another stockholder can shed needed light

"Well, it looks like the Redditters are rampaging again against the GME shorts (stock is up 90% again today). I hope these Redditters discover Ebix, which is a perfect candidate (huge short interest, has been screwed by hedge funds for years) for what they are doing."
"As a retired MBA/Corporate Finance guy, I see the panic selling in EBIX as a major investor overreaction to a few minor, nit-picking issues by an outside auditor--not a big deal. Analysts have rated EBIX as a Buy (2) rating with an average Target Price of $54. I bought 300 shares at $28 this morning. Great time to buy!"

It must be a great feeling to be short EBIX. management seems to have a long term plan but hasn’t a clue how to manage the shorts. Us bag holders have no option but to watch the slow carnage.
"Owning EBIX and watching it be manipulated is just a brutal experience. Management must divert money to buy back stock or this manipulation will continue.

"If anyone wants to see the affect a narcissistic egomaniac can have on the price of a stock, pull up a five-year chart on EBIX. RR’s ego is written all over it. In a recent earnings call, he had the audacity to use the phrase “my companies” when referring to all the businesses that make up EBIX.

Another great quartet but no real answer about IPO!Some thoughts. Ebix’s cab and bus business in India….wonder if the likes of Uber or Let might have interest in acquiringt that?Many individual Ebixcash businesses have partnerships with competitors like Paytm. How productiveare those partnerships and will that eventually lead them to acquire Ebixcash prior to an IPO.

"Now that the Annual Meeting has been scheduled for August 15 and the auditors payment schedule is posted for stockholders and the SEC to see, do the shorts really believe that there is a problem with past accounting? The Yatra merger seems to be one that expands earnings growth without doing damage to the balance sheet other than some minor dilution. I've been adding shares."
IPO of ebixcash will correct the significant undervalue situation. Short will be toasted.
"From EBIX Transcript: In Q1, we announced that we were in late stages of engaging with one of the largest distributors in the country. We are pleased to report that in Q2, we signed a master agreement with one of the largest banks in the U.S., JPMorgan Chase. This is a major deal that I referenced in my last call without providing the name at that time for confidentiality reasons.We are on track with the implementation to onboard JPMorgan onto the platform by Q4 of 2020. While specifics of this engagement cannot be disclosed due to confidentiality, all the carriers within the JPMorgan network have been notified and we are working closely with them to set up their products on the exchange. We expect a healthy uptick in transactional revenue once the implementation is completed in Q4."
Perhaps Robin needs to tweet he’s taking the co private for $420.
Glad EBIX had a great quarter or who knows what the price of the stock would be. What is truly vexing is that the short volume has been greatly reduced and they can still achieve these type of results. Wish I had learned my lesson and never reinvested in EBIX as I have now lost more than I gained previously. Guess I’m a slow learner as history has a way of repeating.
Crushed it. This will be an epic squeeze in the coming months. 7M shorts / 40+% of the float

Was on the call today but didn’t understand comment about a future IPO in India?
"I'm really hoping EBIX can catch a bid and a squeeze, based on FED warning of froth in the markets. I would see EBIX as a value play based on P/E under 10, especially in the face of stretched valuations across the rest of the market."
"However, the real big opportunity in insurance is ahead of us in India in the form of our Bombay Stock Exchange, BSE-Ebix insurance exchange venture. Recently, we announced that we have secured approval from the insurance regulators for the BSE-Ebix venture to be deployed in India. This is possibly going to be one of our biggest ventures ever from my perspective. The BSE-Ebix venture is targeting to handle insurance distribution and back-end insurance processing in a manner and scale that has never been attempted in India with 300,000 BSE terminals across who's who of India's financial institutions and 320,000 EbixCash franchises across the length and breadth of India. We are attempting to take insurance sales to the last mile in every nook and corner of the country into rural areas, last-mile street, across all cities, banks, agents, stockbrokers, wealth management advisers, et cetera. The BSE-Ebix business model on the distribution of insurance will focus on a pure commission-based model since that is the most lucrative financially while selling life, property and casualty, equipment, travel and health insurance, et cetera, to the prospective 1.3 billion population of the country.Recently, a mid-sized insurance distributor in India with approximate revenues of $60 million decided to launch its IPO in India and got valued at $1.5 billion. The valuation was based on the opportunity ahead of this distributor. We believe that what we are attempting with BSE is way larger and expansive than this distributor. Besides, we have India's most trusted and oldest financial institution by our side in the form of Bombay Stock Exchange. More on this later.We are presently trying to draw a balance between our efforts to grow our EbixCash margins and our attempts to be a leader in the market. EbixCash performance is particularly noteworthy when compared it to its key competitors with high valuations, who collectively lost $1 billion last year in the Indian market and delivered much less top line growth than EbixCash. We are clearly very pleased with our EbixCash growth story and where we are headed with it. Let me give you 3 examples to illustrate how aggregation, network effect and leadership leads to new revenue streams, substantial opportunities and great operating margins.Example one is a remittance deal from the past year with an international money transfer operator who paid EbixCash a $16 million signing bonus to get access to just 35,000 of our franchisee network. That was pure profit added for the signing bonus, and the actual remittance transaction got us our traditional charges anyway as an addition.Example two is a recent deal we announced with a few travel exchange players, wherein we got paid in advance of $25 million with a committed transaction fee arrangement of $75 million upward over the next 5 years based on commitments from us in terms of volumes of segments that we will provide to them.The aggregation and fee arrangement allows us now to consolidate the market and also aggressively grow our travel business with the awareness that we can make these additional fees beyond our traditional travel commissions and other fee payments. It also opens up an opportunity for us to pass part of these fees to the consumer and price our competition out while booking commissions on business that we may not have otherwise secured.The third example is -- of an aggregation deal, is a deal that we are presently negotiating in the financial services arena wherein we want country level exclusivity and possibly a large signing bonus to provide a large international financial services player access to our franchisee network in India. More on this when we finalize the deal.We are very proud about the emerging status of EbixCash today as the largest end-to-end financial exchange in the Indian subcontinent. We are fully aware of the responsibility that comes with being a leader in any segment. Towards that extent, I recently led the financial industry's efforts in India to convince the Finance Minister of India to successfully reverse a tax at source on remittance operators. This tax had been announced by the government of India in early 2019 during its budget announcement, causing a lot of heartburn amongst the remittance franchises.EbixCash and myself took the lead towards laying the industry's concerns to the finance ministry. And thanks to the humility and prudent approach of the government, the tax was canceled on 16 October 2019, through a government notification. We thank the government of India for listening to the industry.We have a number of material key initiatives that are expected to add substantially to our EbixCash revenue and income stream in the coming quarters. I'll name a few for you. One, a multi-million dollar agreement that we have in hand today for the UAE airport ForEx counters where we await central bank approval. We also are in the midst of the acquisition of Trimax bus exchange, wherein"
"' but the stock has since pulled back largely because imo investors simply don't trust the mgt. It's got some good days ahead, but it'll be a grind.'AGREED! Investors have a lot to distrust in mgmt, particularly the lack of any semblance of reflection.abs ZERO seems to have been learnt by EBIX EGOS, even though 1.5m of legal costs incurred on RSM debacle, a 45% tank in market worth and ZERO initiative for reform.How Ebix can simply brush the entire saga under the carpet with nonchalance is beyond me, and probably beyond most inst holders...such a pity the only way full intrinsic value will be realised is if there is a takeover of this megalomaniacal mgmt"

"A MarketBeat posting on the plight of the shorts: Stuart60611 Oct. 30 at 2:52 PM $EBIX Looks to me like shorts are making a full court press today. Will know for sure tomorrow when short data for today is released, but it sure looks that way based on the typical high volume. 6 months or so before the Indian IPO when it will game over for the shorts. Based on the news flow, a lot of new deals and new revenue streams coming online very near term. These new sources of revenue will provide a nice catalyst for the IPO whose road show has yet to even begin. Soon Yatra will close, Ebix will pass its yearly audit, and the international IPO underwriter will be named. BNSL receivable will also be likely paid near term based on the big injection of capital to BNSL from the Indian government. Ebix numbers should really impress in the coming next couple of quarters.

"The silence from EBIX is deafening. You would think that after a stock is cut in half there would be more PR defending it. As a long term holder and someone who is selling other holdings in an effort to maintain my EBIX position, I’m losing faith. Please give shareholders something to hang our hats on."
"Short Interest grew from 7,167,000 on 6/15/2020 to 8,378,084 on 6/30/2020, an increase of 1,211,084 shares.A total of 5,805,600 shares were traded in the same time period, 20.86% of all shares traded were NET short.Stock price dropped from $24.94 to $22.36 in the same time period.The shorts own this stock (and always have). With all the issues EBIX has with investors historically, what can ever be done to reverse this trend? Is their future really this gloomy? Have they been faking their numbers for nearly 10 years?! That would be impressive given all the questions over the years regarding those figures. Analysts are still calling for strong growth, are they all wrong?"
"JEEZ this stock is unfathomableDOWN 2% !! ON 40K SHARES!!!no one and his dog is interested in Ebix, after the ""management missteps"""
EBIX issues update with great news and stock tanks again on low volume. You have to have a high tolerance for pain owning this stock. Management must start buying back or we will visit the 40’s again. Short sellers own EBIX.

"Ebix: Reject The Equity Incentive Plan For Personal Enrichment Of CEOAug. 31, 2020 11:34 AM ETSummaryThis article focuses on the voting at a shareholders meeting on 14th September 2020.Ebix is compelled to require a shareholder vote, not due to a need to address gross corporate misgovernance, but because a 10-year clause needs your vote.The board of directors has illustrated a total lack of accountability to the true owners of Ebix, the shareholders; it is subservient to the whims of a dominant CEO.Vote ‘No’ to the re-election of the same band of ineffective directors.Vote ‘No’ to the Equity Incentive Plan which would award the CEO an 8-digit bonus this instant on a takeover, while shareholders have suffered a 60% loss of capital."
need to know if RR is going to keep his word - about being paid with shares until stock price is $150 per share
The recent Simply Wall St article suggests that Ebix is under-valued with a PE of 12.95 and the peers at a PE of 49.66Were Ebix to have the same PE as its peers - the Ebix stock price would be 3.83 times current price - or $132 per share
I have no position in this stock. came across and checking it out. something I have noticed lately is the number of lawsuits filed just before earnings against companies. not just this stock but tons. its constantly and every time puts the breaks on the stock. just throwing that out there. wish you longs good luck I'll do some dd and see about buying some options before earnings.

The more they short the more the stock goes up....This can't be good for short prospects.
"140k shares short covered from 4/15 to 4/30. I'm not sure what they are clinging too, IRS exam concluded, SEC concluded, 30% operating Margins, Cash flow robust, Q1 revenue was $143M at the pace that's $570M , but they guided to $800M run rate by Q4 (included $30M from prospective acquisitions in that qtrly number), that's a lot of growth trades around a current PE of 13 based on non-gaap eps of 1.04, buying back stock (avg price around $44), CEO taking all stock compensation (no cash until stock price gets to $150, signing lots of new deals and this looming IPO Q1 2020 target could crush the shorts, I mean really crush them. Assuming $800M annual run rate in q4 the forward PE will be under 10 at today's price. If your sitting on the fence, go long there are a lot of built in buyers, around 7.4M shares will need to cover, the eps growth, margin stability, cash flow generation and looming IPO its all lining up against them. Reminds me of the Kevin Costner movie No Way out."

Has anyone heard any more developments on the 5-1 split announced in November??
Does anyone have ANY idea why Ebix is down every single day for the last 2'ish weeksI dont see any negative news on Ebix or India Pandemichave i missed something?Thanks in advance
After $MOMO Ebix is the most undervalued quality stock in the market right now imho. Easy money.
no news on mid-May decision on acquisition ? and - I read some time ago - stock split 6 - 1 and keep same dividend - which would have meant the dividend would have increased to $0.45 per share - what happened to that plan from management ?there seems to be something fishy about how this company perceives rewarding loyalty of shareholders -
"There are two things that are beneath the revenue and profit. First, whether the management has integrity. Second, whether the growth by acquisition strategy is right one. The two may be interconnected. Some companies use acquisition cooking the book like GE in the 90s and early 2000s. The numbers of this company look good but it seems the market does not trust the numbers. We may be in a little binary situation. It could be very good or very bad."
"probably expect securities commission to do an investigation on them mayput ahalt on stock ormayban stock ,when your auditor quit after management refuse to give paper for usual transactions , then i see an investigation coming soon if management dont explain the 30 million unusual transaction.,plustheycannotdo thierquarterly report or yearly report unless they explian the30 million unusual transactions"
"This will probably rally to $32+ at the bell, and another 10% tomorrow to $35. Sell off today is a bit overblown in my opinion."
"Two days before earnings and shorts still in control, once again on low volume. Please RR give us something we can hang our hat on. Very disheartening seeing previous gains accumulated over years washed out and turned to losses in last 2 quarters."
"my article about to be published on seeking alphaEbix Will Walk From Yatra- If Shareholders' Interests PrevailSince my last absurdly bullish article on February ‘18, Ebix has lost +80% of its valueReason: Over 3 years, an Indian CEO led the company to a promising opportunity in India, but the acquisitions have been extravagant, were poorly integrated, thus decimating shareholder valueYatra could well be the terminal blunder. In July ’19 Ebix committed to pay $338m (cash). The buyout currency, Ebix shares, have lost 80%, but a collar fixed the price.Yatra is a loss-making e-commerce business focused on international travel. Nothing should be more obvious than to walk, using exit clauses in the deal. Sound hopeless? Wait, just a few changes in governance could unlock a three-bagger in Ebix.Alas a leniant BOD has allowed an extravagant and poorly integrated takeover binge, neglecting their responsibility to shareholders. It is my honest opinion that Raina’s judgement has been severely impaired in India. One can only wonder why a CEO would wear orange sunglasses, with a shirt unbuttoned to his navel, to a company gala supper. But I digress, the CEO needs better oversight and discipline from a competent BOD.https://seekingalpha.com/author/sunil-shah#regular_articles"

"'Ebix Is A Strong Buy Here After Auditor RSM's Exit""https://seekingalpha.com/article/4414354-ebix-is-strong-buy-after-auditor-exitummaryEbix, in the last three years, has faced a number of challenges, many of them I would categorize as missteps by management.The dramatic resignation of their auditor (RSM) was the latest (self-inflicted) crisis. Their departure strongly implied impropriety, and a 40% collapse in market value added more salt to shareholder wounds.Yet a close examination of RSM’s rationale revealed the crisis might have been easily avoided. Also, the issues raised strongly suggest Ebix's incompetence rather than something graver, as RSM implied.If Ebix’s 2020 results remain largely intact, the current share price is a strong buy. Read why.But hurry up, the clearance sale is likely to end by April 20th, the proposed date for audited 2020 results by the newly appointed auditor."
"This Ebix correction has gone far beyond the most dire projections. Even with the most dire assumptions :-Ebix US Exchange not GROWING (although the 24 month stagnation is forecast to rise) -EbixCash is worth half the prevailing valuations of current e-commerce Indian listed (unprofitable whereas EbixCash IS) companies. EVEN Then, The aggregate valuation after debt is about $48 per share."
ER tomorrow at 11:00am EST
took a beating on good earnings. only 23 M shares in float. earnings almost 400M debt 779 M and 14% short. Well if it gets low enough they can buy back all the stock. so what happends when all the issued stock is out of the market and the shorts still have 6M shares. How can you force shorters to buy back -- I dont think you can. Once they get the stock down low enough and buy back most of the shares all that can be done is pay massive dividends - make the shorters which they never owned the stock
Low float with a high short interest of 25%. Will be squeezed to 40 by tomorrow.

Cash flow Q1 2019 was 40% of all of 2018 cash flows from operations...Off to a good start
Can’t believe about 25% of outstanding shares are short...can you say squeeze is coming?!
"Today's stock action really made no sense, but it's consistent with EBIX's manic stock price action in the past. The good news (and most important news) is that the business is vibrant and growing. The less good news is that the street still doesn't seem to like this stock. Overall, I'm very pleased with the CC today, and the outlook for tomorrow."
What a great day for shorts. Congrats are in order for shorting above 50 and haveing net profit of 40% in single day. Pretty hard to do when you are long in stocks...Always buy on heavy dips and sell on pops and not the other way around...Human nature is to buy on pops and sell on heavy dips. Hard to control the reflexes...Good Luck to all and do yourd due diligence always..
"I said it before, Robin please start buying. They know you spent zero in Q4 and believe they can walk this back to wherever they want the stock price."
Just one final comment on the change of auditors. It is my understanding that the change of auditors concerns only the Indian subsidiary. The Rest of the international branches will continue to be audited by the current Auditor. Of course short sellers just add to the confusion in order to tank the stock.
The problem seems to be the retaliatory tariffs by India. I'm not smart enough to know how to calculate the effects on earnings or to estimate how long this issue will persist.
"MSCI's India Index trades at 17 times earnings. Ebix Cash with $450M in sales (run rate projected by Robin Q4 2019) @ 20% gross margins (lets be conservative here, should really use 30% margins which they are currently running at) = $90M X 17 pe multiple equals $1.5B. $1.5B is the current market for all of Ebix and 75% of their enterprise value. This is a powder keg that will blow up in the shorts faces. I can't believe they are going to destroy their careers and risk their fund investors capital with such a clearly impending event on the horizon. With 36% of the float short, there are a lot of built in buyers to go along with an enormous buy back that will take place late 2019/ early 2020 IMO."

Why no buyback this quarter when the stock hit 52 weeks low?
If you listened to the call yesterday it’s no wonder these were the price results.

OUR CALL We recently spent two days in India at the company’s annual kickoff and come away very bullish on Ebix shares. Following the flurry of acquisitions since May’17, the EbixCash business is starting to take shape, with much tighter product integration and improving cross-sell. In addition, management bench strength was on full display as more than 50 managers took the stage and shared their outlooks on competitive landscape, industry direction, growth opportunities, and more. For the legacy/core business, substantive changes made by new (Aug’18) leader Ash Sawhney appear to be taking hold. We believe pipeline has shown a material improvement and that accelerating top-line growth is in the cards for 2020."

Who knows why crashed 7% today?

"Price Action 34 to 44 since 8/15 till today, 7.9M short to 7.6M short (probably a bit lower now), what happens when they really start to cover?"
Been a long time holder of ebix and everytime one of these fly by night ambulance chasers or short attack tools announces a conspiracy theory and people jump ship but nothing ever sticks. I was concerned for the first year or 2 but I believe RR is a straight shooter who uses every advantage to the companies benefit. so far so good.
Ebix will be hugely success in next 5 to 10 years with their focus on India. The company will be worth 10 times more than current market price.
Only difference with this short squeeze = EBIX makes money with good fundamentals and pays dividend.This is not AMC and GME folks. This is long term hold. Wait for next ER later this month or early March.
Don’t panic sell. It’s not a big deal. The 30 million they are talking about was sent back to the account and it only happens in the December quarter.

Typical short action down over 2% on small volume. Hope we take them to the woodshed when earnings are announced.

The US based insurance business is expected to grow 8 – 10% in ’20, solidly reversing the flat to modest declines on the top-line over the last two years. New leadership and focus in the US business appears to be taking hold and is likely to be a key part of the Ebix story in 2020.

"More good news:bombaywala46 Oct. 28 at 12:45 PM $EBIX CH: Ash Sawhney (appointed President of North America on 8/28/18) is rapidly remaking the base/legacy Ebix business (new people and process) and we believe the probability of top-line acceleration has greatly increased. Services have been the challenge for this unit as the company has worked to push away from staff augmentation type engagements to be more focused on higher value project work. We believe the bulk of the pain has been felt here and we have put in a bottom with respect to the associated revenue pressures. Following a range of discussions, we believe Ash has focused on building/training the sales team to “solution sell”, as opposed to operating in individual silos or on individual products. In addition, we believe much has been done to streamline/improve common CRM visibility and to enable broader/more robust and more precise pipeline tracking."

The parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Section 8.2 shall be deemed to affect their right to specific performance under Section 9.9 prior to the valid termination of this Agreement. In addition, the parties agree that the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 in accordance with its terms.”Ebix argued that Yatra’s decision to terminate the Merger Agreement barred its claims for breach of contract. Yatra responded that the phrase “with respect thereto” can reasonably be read to modify “any termination of this Agreement” (as opposed to “obligations”). Under this construction, the provision cannot be understood to eliminate damages owed for prior breaches of “obligations,” but only damages caused by the act of terminating the Merger Agreement.The Court found Yatra’s reading of the provision stretched the words beyond their tolerance. The comma following “Section 8.1” breaks the sentence, reading naturally to indicate the Merger Agreement’s drafters intended the phrase “with respect thereto” to modify “the obligations of the parties” as opposed to “any termination of this agreement.”Yatra’s position—that the provision only extinguished liability arising from “any termination of this Agreement”—was inconsistent with the language immediately following “with respect thereto,” which “except[s]” certain obligations under the Merger Agreement, as specifically enumerated, from the effects of the contractual limitation of liability. That clause would be superfluous if the effect of the provision was to limit liability only arising from the act of terminating the Merger Agreement.Moreover, contrary to Yatra’s contention that termination leaves claims for breach of contract based on prior acts unaffected, the Court noted Section 8.2 expressly carved out only liability for “fraud occurring prior to such termination,” implying that liability for all other claims (including contract based claims) for acts “occurring prior” to termination did not survive post-termination.The Court also considered the precedent set by AB Stable VIII LLC v. Maps Hotels & Resorts One LLC. The court in AB Stable expressly observed that “[u]nder the common law, termination results in an agreement becoming void, but that fact alone does not eliminate liability for a prior breach.” The court went on to explain that when parties include a provision stating that “there shall be no liability on the part of either party” upon termination, they “alter[] the common law rule” and “broadly waive[] contractual liability and all contractual remedies.”"

"Dear Ebix investor relations The Bollywood Clowns and YatraPlease help me and readers understand the confusion regarding Yatra. As per your SEC disclosure, the Extension Date has expired. There has BEEN NO UPDATE, there has been a time lapse, so the deal is terminated as per your disclosures to the SEC. Yet on the conference call for 1q 2020 results, Chief Clown Raina says https://seekingalpha.com/article/4346251-ebixs-ebix-ceo-robin-raina-on-q1-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript""The courts basically issued an order on May 4th, and so we are working now with the court process that we have to follow and we are right now working with the court appointed resolution professionals to follow all of that. Coming back to Yatra, I've already said that basically we – the expiry date was May 4th. The date hasn't been extended as yet. I can't talk more about Yatra simply because we – whatever the next announcement is, we'll announce it at the right time, whatever the announcement is.We are highly limited, but what we can say at this minute because our attorneys – and we got to follow the confidentiality and the processes that we have to do between the both sides. ""So the deal has lapsed, the time line has passed, there is no new extension, AND YET YOU CLAIM YOU ARE LIMITED IN WHAT YOU SAY!!!"" DO YOU SEE THE TOTAL INCONGRUITY OF THIS For your shareholders? Ebix price is down another 12% yesterday, making it close to 85% capital destruction over 3 years. Yet you carry on with your clowning. Chief Clown Raina has the audacity to add:"" I can only tell you, rest assured that we want to – we will always want to protect our shareholder rights in anything we do.."" Do you see how ridiculous you appear and how investors perceive you. That's a rhetorical question."
