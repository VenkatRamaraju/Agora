"This seems like a perfect investment. Very little downside with well established business and low valuation AND most importantly a huge asset in the pocket with multi-billion Ebix Cash IPO that the management has confirmed is on target for H1 2022. Analysts compared the IPO valuation to peers and gave a range of 5 to 12 billion - 5 to 12 BILLION of which Ebix owns 100% and the company market cap is right now just under one billion... free money anyone? I guess the poor mistakes and legal battles of the near past have driven off the interest in EBIX, but now those battles are over and once the momentum changes I for one believe we will see a drastic jump in valuation as the dust settles and the IPO of Ebix cash nears. To me this is a no-brainer to jump in now and enjoy the ride."
"I noticed the huge open interest on put option contracts with a March 20 expiration date and have been adding a few shares on this drop. The manipulation continues. I can't be certain that it will end soon, but March 20 isn't that many days away. The shorts might choose to cover in conjunction with the expiration date. The Corona virus is being used along with lies about a lack of audit coverage for the quarters results.CatalystIR Mar. 4 at 8:25 PM We are not one for conspiracy theories but we have heard from more than one reputable source of heavy options activity in $EBIX a few weeks ago that would signal a coming short attack - and recent trading activity does seem VERY abnormal. Note a few minutes back their were about 17,000 open Put option contacts to sell 1.7M Ebix shares (9,000 or 900,000 shares of which expire March 20th in addition to a short position of 5,996,574 shares at 2/14/20 - which together represent about 25% of total shares out. We point out these factors because we are confident the audited fundamentals filed with the SEC are strong and do not warrant the share price swoon which is to some degree being orchestrated by those who stand to gain from the fear they are creating"

I don;t see the follow-thru - and he is making himself wealthy - yet not the stockholders"
"This is the ULTIMATE insult added to injury to shareholdersEBIX HAS LOST 70% OF ITS VALUE OVER THE LAST 3 YEARS AND THE CEO HAS JUST HAD HIS ""PERFORMANCE GRANT"" RAISED TO $3.6M-Please explain to me how this aligns interests of management with the owners of Ebix the shareholders?-it appears all the CEO Raina has to do is EXIST AND HE RECEIVES THE ""PERFORMANCE GRANT""?-what are the targets the CEO should meet to QUALIFY FOR THIS EXTRA $3.6M ?-was this compensation put to a shareholder vote?-on what basis does the CEO merit a higher salary, when the company's owners have faced a material capital attrition the last one three and five years?-this grant appears in addition to Raina's golden parachute worth 8 digits on a base price of Ebix of $8/share-is there any rational basis for this new performance grant of $3,600,000?-MOST IMPORTANTLY, did institutional investors approve of this?https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/814549/000119312521307945/d249211d8k.htm%5D(e) Compensatory Arrangements of Certain OfficersOn October 20, 2021, after reviewing the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman’s performance under his compensation plan, the Compensation Committee of Ebix, Inc. approved a retention grant of $3,600,000 in cash to Mr. Raina.

"ebix got away within a hair's breath from being successfully sued by Yatra.Ebix had committed itself to paying $358m -fixed price, no warranties - for a co now worth $35m = Yatrawow that was a close shave for ANOTHER 'MISSTEP' BY OUR CLOWN TROUPEwww.lexology.com/...Termination of Merger Agreement Prevents Suit for BreachBlog Dodd-FrankStinson LLPMEMBER FIRM OF TerraLexStinson LLP logoUSA September 6 2021Yatra Online, Inc., v. Ebix, Inc. concerned an abandoned merger that Plaintiff, Yatra Online Inc. (“Yatra”), asserts was sabotaged post-signing by Defendants, Ebix, Inc. and EbixCash Travels, Inc. after Ebix determined the deal was no longer attractive.Delays were encountered as an S-4 was awaiting SEC clearance and Ebix sought to renegotiate certain matters. Fed up with Ebix’s behavior during the extended renegotiations, and after the final outside closing date lapsed, Yatra terminated the Merger Agreement and filed a lawsuit against Ebix. The complaint included an action for breach of the Merger Agreement amongst other things.The relevant provision of the merger agreement read as follows:“In the event of any termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, the obligations of the parties shall terminate and there shall be no liability on the part of any party with respect thereto, except for the confidentiality provisions of Section 6.4 (Access to Information) and the provisions of Section 3.26 (No Other Representations and Warranties; Disclaimers), Section 4.17 (No Expenses), this Section 8.2, Section 8.3 (Termination Fees) and Article IX (General Provisions), each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect; provided, however, that, subject to Section 8.3(a)(iii), nothing contained herein shall relieve any party from liability for damages arising out of any fraud occurring prior to such termination, in which case the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or equity. The parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Section 8.2 shall be deemed to affect their right to specific performance under Section 9.9 prior to the valid termination of this Agreement. In addition, the parties agree that the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 in accordance with its terms.”Ebix argued that Yatra’s decision to terminate the Merger Agreement barred its claims for breach of contract. Yatra responded that the phrase “with respect thereto” can reasonably be read to modify “any termination of this Agreement” (as opposed to “obligations”). Under this construction, the provision cannot be understood to eliminate damages owed for prior breaches of “obligations,” but only damages caused by the act of terminating the Merger Agreement.The Court found Yatra’s reading of the provision stretched the words beyond their tolerance. The comma following “Section 8.1” breaks the sentence, reading naturally to indicate the Merger Agreement’s drafters intended the phrase “with respect thereto” to modify “the obligations of the parties” as opposed to “any termination of this agreement.”Yatra’s position—that the provision only extinguished liability arising from “any termination of this Agreement”—was inconsistent with the language immediately following “with respect thereto,” which “except[s]” certain obligations under the Merger Agreement, as specifically enumerated, from the effects of the contractual limitation of liability. That clause would be superfluous if the effect of the provision was to limit liability only arising from the act of terminating the Merger Agreement.Moreover, contrary to Yatra’s contention that termination leaves claims for breach of contract based on prior acts unaffected, the Court noted Section 8.2 expressly carved out only liability for “fraud occurring prior to such termination,” implying that liability for all other claims (including contract based claims) for acts “occurring prior” to termination did not survive post-termination.The Court also considered the precedent set by AB Stable VIII LLC v. Maps Hotels & Resorts One LLC. The court in AB Stable expressly observed that “[u]nder the common law, termination results in an agreement becoming void, but that fact alone does not eliminate liability for a prior breach.” The court went on to explain that when parties include a provision stating that “there shall be no liability on the part of either party” upon termination, they “alter[] the common law rule” and “broadly waive[] contractual liability and all contractual remedies.”"

"More comments from todays announcement. Also, short interest is down 150K shares.ValueTrapeze Jan. 13 at 7:38 AM $EBIX Additional comments from Robin Raina on $MGI Moneygram partnership: EbixCash will be MoneyGram’s exclusive partner in India. We see this as a very lucrative and high margin intensive deal. MoneyGram will be handling the inward remittances and EbixCash will be doing the servicing job,” said Robin Raina, Chairman, Ebix, without disclosing the commission structure. Through this partnership, EbixCash is expecting to clock net revenues between $20-$35 million annually. “This is a very conservative estimate. We expect to scale up revenues further and could look at annual revenues of about $50m over the next 2-3 years via this partnership,” said Raina. “We intend to do a soft launch in the second week of February for the insurance business. We are also planning to launch India's first re-insurance exchange in 2020,” shared Raina. https://www.cnbctv18.com/startup/ebixcash-signs-strategic-partnership-agreement-with-moneygram-5048791.htm ·"
"you may recall that Ebix built PPL for Lloyd's underwriters, a big win in 2018 as the winner of a competitive tender in the Underwriting space. It was transformational for Lloyd's from going to on-face to digital. PPL was powered by Ebix.PPL has now transitioned to phase 2, where they needed a specialist insurer to upgrade the platform. They have just chosen Deloitte. But AFAIW, THE BACKBONE IS STILL BUILT POWERED AND MAINTAINED BY EBIX.IT WOULD BE NICE IF EBIX IR CLARIFIED ON THISPPL to partner with Deloitte to build NextGen platformhttps://www.insuranceinsider.com/article/293lib38u539mb1exwykg/ppl-to-partner-with-deloitte-to-build-nextgen-platformMarcel Le Gouais | 24 September 2021The PPL board has decided to partner with Deloitte to build its NextGen platform, in a long-awaited decision on how it will deliver a pivotal component of the London market’s modernisation.Insurance Insider had previously revealed that Whitespace and Deloitte were in a two-horse race for the PPL NextGen contract and this morning PPL’s board finally came to a decision, which had to be unanimous for the project to proceed.Bronek Masojada, chair of the PPL board, said: “This was an important decision for the market in its journey towards more efficient and effective electronic placement of risk.“PPL has undertaken extensive work to look at the two main options available: to continue to build our own platform or to partner with an existing offering. The pros and cons for each choice were explored thoroughly and presented to the board.“The choice of Deloitte offers the market the control that it wants on the development of the platform – both now, and in the future, and a partner that has been deeply involved in the build so far, offering expertise and continuity.“We are very much looking forward to building on the strong work done so far on NextGen and delivering the platform that the market wants and needs.”"
Don’t forget to vote against the Ebix Board of Directors. All of them deserve to get booted. Voting is happening right now.
RR talked about salaries - did not hear any mention of him not accepting a paycheck until the stock price hit $150 per share - as he stated he would do - some time ago - if he is now paid with shares as he said - then when he resumes paying himself a paycheck again - salary expense goes up - margins goes down When does he think the PPS will be $150 per share ?
what is wrong with this company ??
"140k shares short covered from 4/15 to 4/30. I'm not sure what they are clinging too, IRS exam concluded, SEC concluded, 30% operating Margins, Cash flow robust, Q1 revenue was $143M at the pace that's $570M , but they guided to $800M run rate by Q4 (included $30M from prospective acquisitions in that qtrly number), that's a lot of growth trades around a current PE of 13 based on non-gaap eps of 1.04, buying back stock (avg price around $44), CEO taking all stock compensation (no cash until stock price gets to $150, signing lots of new deals and this looming IPO Q1 2020 target could crush the shorts, I mean really crush them. Assuming $800M annual run rate in q4 the forward PE will be under 10 at today's price. If your sitting on the fence, go long there are a lot of built in buyers, around 7.4M shares will need to cover, the eps growth, margin stability, cash flow generation and looming IPO its all lining up against them. Reminds me of the Kevin Costner movie No Way out."
"The following was extracted from the Craig Hallum Analyst's rnotes:bombaywala46 May. 12 at 2:38 PM $EBIX $YTRA From CH notes: Before the year ends! One of the largest Insurance Exchange deals in company history is progressing ahead of plan. We have previously made mention that Ebix has signed what we believe is one of the largest deals in company history in the insurance business. On today’s call, the customer was noted to be “one of the largest banks in the country/world”, a large distributor with 15 life insurance carriers and 12 annuity carriers. The deal is expected to be live by the end of the year and it was noted that COVID has accelerated the timeline/progress. Both the PS work to get the customer up and live and the recurring revenue stream to come later on were noted to be in the “multi-millions.”"
"As a retired MBA/Corporate Finance guy, I see the panic selling in EBIX as a major investor overreaction to a few minor, nit-picking issues by an outside auditor--not a big deal. Analysts have rated EBIX as a Buy (2) rating with an average Target Price of $54. I bought 300 shares at $28 this morning. Great time to buy!"
