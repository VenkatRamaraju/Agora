"I rode this from $28 to $43- a quick run too. I'l back in this week for a longer-term hold, on any dip.

"solvay couldn't buy HXL because - 1. it already owns cytec and it would not meet antitrust requirements - it would control too much of the carbon fiber and adhesive supply base and 2. HXL possess the technology for stealth aircraft and weapons - the US government would not allow a foreign company to own that. it was a fakeover - there have been a bunch of those lately. i hope the federal marshals find out who started the rumor, arrest them and make them pay penalties for market manipulation."

"I was pleased to see that Fairlight, a shareholder, delivered a letter to the Board decrying the merger, or at least the terms. I don't know how management can claim there was a strategic purpose to the merger with a straight face. I believe shareholders will have to approve the merger, and I intend to vote no. My only concern about HXL had been exposure to the 737Max, and it appears that Woodward has more exposure, doing less business with Airbus."

"The recent price strength in HXL leads me to the conclusion that some institutional players have found a new goldmine to price to perfection. I like the company, but when these guys step in it becomes a trade rather than an investment. It's in-play even as the BA 737MAX issue drags on. I just can;t convince myself everything is fine and dandy, so I are reconciled to watch by the sidelines for now."

Wish I discovered Hexcel long ago. I hold BA and HA as aerospace stocks.
"From the CC, HXL sees redeployment of most of any underultilized 737Max materials capacity to other programs, and consequently, maintains FY19 guidance despite potential fallout from the 737 grounding. Very encouraging, but how accurate this assessment will be remains to be proven. If those other programs really do represent sufficient demand to fill out a 737Max demand shortall, then why wasn't HXL expanding to fill that unment demand prior to the 737Max fiasco?@@@As of today, we have seen very little, if any, impact from Boeing's announced rate reduction. We will continue to meet all demands for Boeing 737MAX materials and if there are any reductions in demand throughout the supply chain, we are confident that we will be able to repurpose the vast majority of our manufacturing and material capacities to take advantage of other short-term commercial opportunities. And just to reiterate, after taking into account the potential impact we see at this point in time for the 737MAX revenues in 2019, we have made no changes to our annual guidance based on the offsetting, broader market strength we see before us.@@@ In our forecast and in our commitment and confidence in maintaining our guidance, we certainly have modeled in an impact -- a negative impact on the 737MAX. And based on what we see, that will be more than offset by the robust growth we're seeing in other aspects of the business.@@@Well, specifically, we're very -- our opportunities with our carbon fiber are continuing to go up. Demand is quite honestly one of the reasons why our sales growth this year is so strong. So repurposing fiber assets for another opportunity we have would be similar to MAX margins. It basically wouldn't be noticeable. If you look at honeycomb core, again, it's another area where our engineered core business is just growing significantly, even faster than we're able to put in some assets. So we would divert that honeycomb core very quickly, again, at comparable margins. And we've said it before. If you look in our aerospace business, the margins are comparable. Where you have differences are if you transition and look into our wind business. And I can tell you, none of these assets would be redeployed to support wind or the wind turbine business. So overall, from a fibers, from an engineered core, from a matrix, very quick and easy to sell that where demand is strong. A little bit harder on the structures business, harder to backfill that and it would take a little longer, but it's just a portion of the MAX's overall shipset value we sell."

"CFRA MAINTAINS STRONG BUY OPINION ON HEXCEL CORPORATION""We keep our target price at $53 using a discounted cash flow analysis that assumes HXL won't recover its pre-pandemic free cash flow (FCF) peak until 2028. $53 is also 30x our 2022 EPS estimate (started at $1.79; 2021 cut to $1.17 from $2.11; 2020 to $0.55 from $1.43). Q3 EPS of -$0.29 vs. $0.90 missed consensus by $0.36. Q3 Commercial Aerospace revenue (68% of 2019 total) fell 67% YoY driven by lowered aircraft manufacturer production rates amid the pandemic, particular for wide bodies which are being built at 50-60% lower rates. More surprising was HXL's 36% YoY drop in industrial revenue (13%), driven by the loss of a key U.S. wind turbine customer. Nonetheless, HXL still holds strong global market share in supplying wind turbine producers, in our view, and generated material FCF in Q3 ($76M) even while many peers are burning cash. We think shares are significantly undervalued based on HXL's still sizable long-term FCF potential, with our target price a conservative 38% below HXL's pre-pandemic peak.""Colin Scarola 10/20/2020"

Travel will suffer big as business travel segment will almost be killed for ever. Companies will be using video conferencing and computers to do the deals and business discussion. Expect ing military segment to be transformed in the next decade to servicing the nation via social duties. There will not be need of many fancy war planes.

Under the program, the Company may purchase its common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchases will be funded from cash from operating activities and, if needed, existing borrowings.

It seems this deal is aimed at geographic expansion to serve the EU aerospace markets.@@@STAMFORD, Conn., June 01, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hexcel Corporation (HXL) announced today that it has entered into exclusive negotiations to acquire all of the shares of Structil SA (Structil), a French producer and supplier of high-performance composites to the aerospace, defense and industrial markets. The proposed transaction is subject to review by relevant employee representative bodies and approval from the applicable French authorities. Assuming those reviews and approvals are successfully completed, the acquisition is expected to close in 2017. Structil is a joint venture between Safran Ceramics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Safran, and Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (formerly Mitsubishi Rayon Corporation). The company employs approximately 70 people at a 68,000-square-foot production plant on a seven-acre site in Vert-le-Petit, France, about 25 miles south of Paris. Structil`s 2016 sales were approximately $21 million.

Under the terms of the multi-year agreement, Hexcel will supply Vestas with advanced prepreg (glass fiber-reinforced resin systems) manufactured at Hexcel plants in Neumarkt (Austria), Windsor (Colorado, USA) and Tianjin (China). Hexcel developed a new prepreg system specifically to meet the requirements for large thick structures such as wind blades. This product represents state-of-the-art technology in wind energy prepregs, allowing for significant energy savings in the curing process thanks to the low temperature cure cycle. It also enables much shorter cycle times for higher throughput, providing a highly cost optimized and efficient manufacturing process.https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/10/16/1148061/0/en/Hexcel-and-Vestas-Expand-Composite-Materials-Supply-Agreement-for-Wind-Blades.html"
