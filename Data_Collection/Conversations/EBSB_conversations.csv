This company will have a lot of exposure to the Boston area housing market - Loan portfolio will likely show a lot of stress over the next 3 years - this is a prime example of a local bank overreaching

Q2 was another good quarter. Another $0.29 in earnings which is up $0.02 year over year. Equity is also increasing. They are expecting growth above their current annualized rate of 6%. They just opened branch #39 and will have #40 open by the end of the year.Right now there doesn't look to be any reason for this thing not to increase in price through the end of the year.

Nice Q1. They finally continued the buyback. Beat estimates by $0.01. Organic growth of +20% for loans and deposits is awesome.

No share buy backs last Q but will resume when conditions are determined to be favorable. What in the world has to happen for conditions to be more favorable?
