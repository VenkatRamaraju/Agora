"Just want to say again as it's been a while - but I still find it bullish that Benefit Street purchased approx 900,000 shares Last Year this time at just under $4/share. While there are many good reasons why some one would sell a stock, there is generally only one good reason why someone would buy a stock. My 6th sense is that Benefit Street wasn't thinking that a $6 share price is what they had in mind for a target price when they purchased. Just saying."

"Over the last three years, Berry Corporation has shrunk its earnings per share by 25% per year. Its revenue is down 27% over the previous year.Few shareholders would be pleased to read that EPS have declined. And the fact that revenue is down year on year arguably paints an ugly picture. So given this relatively weak performance, shareholders would probably not want to see high compensation for the CEO. Historical performance can sometimes be a good indicator on what's coming up next but if you want to peer into the company's future you might be interested in this free visualization of analyst forecasts.Has Berry Corporation Been A Good Investment?With a total shareholder return of -41% over three years, Berry Corporation shareholders would by and large be disappointed. This suggests it would be unwise for the company to pay the CEO too generously.To Conclude...Given that shareholders haven't seen any positive returns on their investment, not to mention the lack of earnings growth, this may suggest that few of them would be willing to award the CEO with a pay rise. At the upcoming AGM, the board will get the chance to explain the steps it plans to take to improve business performance.CEO compensation can have a massive impact on performance, but it's just one element. We did our research and spotted 2 warning signs for Berry that investors should look into moving forward."
"In about 2 weeks...hedges for 5,000 BOE will fall off.Q1 & Q2 BRY had 19,000 BOE/day hedged at $46/barrelQ3 & Q4 BRY will have 14,000 BOE/day hedged at $49/barrelThat 5,000 BOE/day drop in hedges will add $9M in profit for each Q3 & Q4 assuming Brent at $64. Higher Brent - higher profit."
"okay...how much stock does Benefit Street need to buy back before others start buying? Yet another Form 4 filed today. They bought yet another 88,452 shares yesterday at $3.67 per share. So the running total is ~ 818,000. Not certain what's driving these sellers to sell, but I wouldn't be selling if a major shareholder is buying a lot of what's being sold."

Wow....just checked the short-interest....there was a big spike between 3-31 and 4-15. Perhaps the recent uptick activity was driven shorts covering.....I'm wondering if the shorts were going large thinking that SB 467 would make it out of subcommittee. Clearly - the shorts weren't banking on the price of oil dropping.
This stock is so cheap... the baby has been thrown out with the bathwater.

"Moving up + a dividend, sweet!"
"""We have significant concentrations of credit risk with the purchasers of our oil and natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2019, sales to Andeavor, Phillips 66 and Kern Oil & Refining accounted for approximately 36%, 24% and 13%, respectively, of our sales. This concentration may impact our overall credit risk because our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions or commodity price fluctuations. We do not require our customers to post collateral. If the purchasers of our oil and natural gas become insolvent, we may be unable to collect amounts owed to us. Also, if we were to lose any one of our major customers, the loss could cause us to cease or delay both production and sale of our oil and natural gas in the area supplying that customer.Due to the terms of supply agreements with our customers, we may not know that a customer is unable to make payment to us until almost two months after production has been delivered. We do not require our customers to post collateral to protect our ability to be paid.""Notice that this is going to become a major risk for many companies like Berry as they must hope that their customers can continue to take the oil being produced having places to store it as well as the ability to pay for that oil. So while hedges look good, they don't mean much if the customers cannot pay for it."

"@greg; Damn you called it again. I 100% agree with your hot take on Arthur ""Trem"" Smith and his ""spin"" speak. Furthermore, my equity firm is not allowed to take major position in BRY for the fact that he is both board chairman (of BOD) and acting CEO. It is a precarious position with much influence for one. Think ""Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely"". Also note his annual compensation of ~$5.4MM is almost 3 times the average for similar companies. Talk about spin...Here is Trem's quote on the Q1 call, """"More recently, on April 23, Governor Newsom directed CalGEM to initiate regulatory action to end the issuance of new permits for hydraulic fracturing by January 2024. This directive does not materially impact bry's operations and, as defined, does not affect our current or future thermal diatomite production..."", said Trem Smith, Berry board chair and CEO. I would think this pretty wishful thinking to say there aren't major regulatory challenges for BRY. C'mon man? lol."
"That's actually big volume, relatively. I just wonder how much is short-covering. I am surprised by today...but heck - $70 Brent and thoughts of potentially a $100 Brent if there's a short squeeze - that could be some wild cash flow, even it only lasts a quarter. LT @ $60 Brent - this thing could pay a $1 per share annual dividend. Still a good buy at $7, especially if they paydown & refinance debt."
Well - at least yesterday was a good day. Just another buying opportunity today.

"I just don't get how the company can be valued at such a depressed level. Brent is now at $45-$46 - and the worst is behind. Rig Count did increase last week, but that increase is so negligible compared to the YoY decrease.....but I guess a few more months/year of sub $50 oil - and the global oil market will have the shake out it wanted and then oil will likely be very nicely rebalanced. I guess the other factor you got going on is supply v demand for O&G stocks. O&G is the new tobacco. And when retail and institutional investors say ""I don't want to own O&G stocks - funds sell, and they sell rather indiscriminately. I think the only thing that will save/help the share price is that ""once they've built up a good/great cash cushion - is to reinstate the dividend and start buying back shares. Ideally - that can start near the end of the year - once the cash cushion gets to $100M."
"Clearly good report, I didn't listen to the call yet....but did see in the release where they announced that they have access to storage, ~ 1 months worth of production. So that is great news."

"California is proving Itself a typical anti-diversity state. The tyrannical left wing overpaid and over controlling government wants to eliminate affordable oil and natural gas production. They support a monopoly on “green” energy which is unaffordable for lower and middle class incomes. Natural gas, oil and gas is much more affordable than expensive solar panels and battery cars. California also opposes mining for the minerals needed to produce battery power which is self defeating. Californian policies are made by left wing extremists, many of whom own stocks in solar energy, who don’t understand the burdens they place on the working poor, the middle class, the poor, and those looking for affordable housing. They oppose Mining, manufacturing and oil drilling which are foundational to an economy and are replacing it with taxing the middle class which will prove to be unsustainable and the state will end up bankrupt just like its public pensions are in unrecoverable debt today."

The best case for BRY bulls = Black Night Energy buys BRY for $6/share. Lets get the rumor mill going and boost this stock!!
In the end CA needs oil revenue to fund one of the largest unfunded pensions in the World. Even Gov. Brown understood that. My understanding is BRY does lil to no fracking in CA holdings. Crazy how this Governor is willing to always choose the worst course of action. CA has some big inland oil reserves and its the kind that are not hard to bring to the surface.
Great buying op!
I agree the hedges come off and we should see serious movement.

"Wow... Benefit Street files yet another Form 4 today and it disclosed that it has purchased another 475,000 shares between 9-9 and 9-10 at approx. $3.87 per share. That's on top of the 255,000 shares that they bought last week. Hard to be more bullish than that."
just listened to the call. It was good. I think the call exuded good confidence that they will nicely be a good survivor.

If the oil price can up for the next few quarters - it'd be good to see Berry starting using some of its excess cash flow to start paying down some of that 7% debt (7% is a steep rate for a well capitalized company). I'm starting to view the debt as a negative overhang - the debt only looks good when things are wildly good for oil - but when oil is okay/mediocre or not good - the debt is a hindrance on valuation and raises concern. I'd forgo a couple of years of dividends to lower the debt and refinance it at a much lower interest rate.

"No reason for this to be below $7 if their production has been flat. Reasonable amount of debt compared to size of resource and production, good cash flow, just happens to be in CA. In a perfect world we would get some good regulatory guidance tomorrow. I can't see LOE or CAPEX being as high as previously forecast either, but that is just my gut feeling being in the industry."
What happen? Down almost 5%
"Good dividend, great company!"
"Hedges work both ways. What was good in 2020 is no bueno in 2021 with oil north of $60 now. They now HAVE to drill some wells in areas with no steam permit (UIC) due to a Chevron JV/farm out with poor ROI projects in pipeline. If Oak Tree liquidates their BRY/CA position this thing could tank with 400MM in debt at 7% the dividend is just a pump ploy. The decline rates are 20% or more and they have no solid project permits in hand to grow production. California is a low cost logistics challenge and without experienced CA leadership/management they will struggle. Probably will have to spend CapEx in UT instead due to lack of permits and opportunity in CA and a ops VP that only knows UT. Too bad it’s only half the ROI of CA projects. That’s all the new “RE-org” leadership team knows, small time production and garbage assets in CO. They lost key CA management experience in 2020 (former AERA) and CA thermal is high risk investment."

Interesting on how many shares traded yesterday above $7. There was some big buying activity. Yes - there were lots of sellers. As I've said before - there's lots of reasons why someone would sell a stock - but there's only one reason why someone would buy a stock. Clearly - once the buying stopped - the price dropped - but clearly the Buyers saw lots of value of at $7.
"As a CA resident, this was a Contrarian investment I usually avoid but truth is CA has such a crazy unfunded pension employee system they need oil tax revenue to continue. Previous Governor has oil hammer heads on his own family property holdings. BRY does very little steam or fracking in CA so it has very little affect on their production capacity. That with cheap transportation cost to Los Angeles refineries keeps me long on this stock. Basically, CA for all its green talk needs oil tax revenue."

"I'm kind of underwhelmed with the PR. They tout a $100M cash, strong financial position, nicely hedged, good CapEx budget of $120M range. Um - they announce a $.04 qtrly dividend - which costs approx $14.8M for the whole year at that rate ($3.2M/qtr). Wow. There's something more to this. I can only trust that the large investors are on board with this and there's a strategy in play that we aren't privy too. I am thinking that they talk about increasing scale...and that kind of reads to me as ""acquisitions"" - as for 2021 - they are looking at production being relatively flat to 2020 - so the ""increasing scale"" doesn't seem to be coming from ""increased production"" - so there's not much else you can do to increase scale. I still think it's good value - but it would have been nice to hear about something like ""restructuring debt"".... something a bit more pro-active. G&A is up because of 'accrued compensation""... no comment, other than must be nice. I am disappointed by the paltry dividend. So much for meaning or significant dividends."
"You can’t compare BP to BRY anymore. Just look at California crude prices. It’s a little obvious but BP had a terrible year and is focused on spending billions on hydrogen and wind.

"Just listened to the call. It was good, okay - nothing notable really or new. No comments re 2022 hedging...but the slide deck shows that 3,000 BOE of oil are hedged at $60 for 2022....so that cold be 6,000 BOE/day for Q1 & Q2 - who knows ... I'll call IR next week to see if I can get a breakdown on the hedging. No comments are refinancing. On the CA politics front - no bills impacting oil are in the que. 2022 permits have all been applied for. So seems like the the next few years seem good at this point. I'm bullish and would look to add to my position on any serious pull back (10-15%)."

I feel like there is a big bad secret out there - that is obvious to everyone else but me. HHmmm.... I like the idea of OPEC+ incrementally increasing production... that will help keep oil lower, longer - which will further diminish the potential for U.S. Shale to come gushing back. I think BRY and most everyone is okay with LT oil at $55 Brent. BRY will do just nicely at that price."

"Llyod.... I just saw this post on another board... any thoughts?The Wild Card: Acquisitions! Management is focused on acquisitions. If BRY decides to do a roll up, I sincerely hope it's in California. Sounds crazy but oil is going to be sorely needed for decades. Today, XOM was put on notice from Shell that they are leaving the AERA Energy partnership. Hope, BRY finds a way to play in this opportunity...."

"Wow, interesting. I did hear BRY actively got rid of a ton of California tenured experience that was pointing out internal process deficiencies. Specifically around permitting process, safety and environmental concerns. They brought in a bunch or folks from Utah last year in Ops and even contractors from Utah to help them with their CA permitting struggles. Seems odd to need Utah consultants for CA regulatory, surely more experienced and knowledgeable people in CA for that in CA, right? Also heard from a pretty high source Trem was actively trying to remove Gene Voiland from the BOD. Gene Voiland was former CEO of Aera, the largest CA producer, only behind Chevron. Sure seems like some sort of anti-CA bias over there going on. Been losing CA experienced folks like crazy over there. I hear the culture is pure toxic and anyone with ability to jump ship would. I do know Trem's background is mainly in Russia. Regulatory compliance comes second to propaganda over there, for sure."

"Simply Wall StTue, August 31, 2021, 3:37 AMIn this article:The truth is that if you invest for long enough, you're going to end up with some losing stocks. Long term Berry Corporation (NASDAQ:BRY) shareholders know that all too well, since the share price is down considerably over three years. Unfortunately, they have held through a 64% decline in the share price in that time. Furthermore, it's down 15% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders. We note that the company has reported results fairly recently; and the market is hardly delighted. You can check out the latest numbers in our company report.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Berry the TSR over the last 3 years was -60%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Berry shareholders have gained 50% (in total) over the last year. And yes, that does include the dividend. What is absolutely clear is that is far preferable to the dismal 17% average annual loss suffered over the last three years. We're generally cautious about putting too much weight on shorter term data, but the recent improvement is definitely a positive. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Berry that you should be aware of before investing here.Ok. To the noob stating, ""Trem is doing a great job."" Only if you consider growing your CEO compensation by more than 100% over the past 3 years, while Reducing revenue 17% YoY at the same time."" I guess it depends on your definition of ""doing a job"". He sure is doing a job on the shareholders and I would think the board of directors might want to intervene. Oh wait, Trem is also Chairman of the Board and removed the Board member over ""compensation"", Gene Voiland (former Aera CEO). Aera just a company 500% more production than BRY with no history of Bankruptcy. No wonder he wanted to get rid of the Aera folks around there. They had no problem seeing through the smoke screen that is Trem speak. Good luck trusting this shitster. His career was mainly in Russia, were fraud and BS work well. I must agree, lining your own pockets while running a company into lower revenue and zero profits at 5 year oil price high's is quite an accomplishment."

My read is lower stock prices for any oil company trying to survive in California.....

I haven’t checked the secondary debt markets in a while, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they bought back debt if it gets cheaper than $.90 on the dollar. It’s getting to where there is a solid financial return there"
BRY is down 6.93% to $9.94
BRY is down 6.79% to $10.57
"After debt restructuring this looks appealing to larger oil companies scooping deals. I am in with 10,000 shares and 832 $7.5 calls if we pop we pop to 11/12/15 I want leverage."
Whats going on with this?
Some one is going to buy this look at lonestar
This a good COVID rebound stock?
Back to $7 this goes. Q3 + Q4 will be good.
Crickets huh?
"In my opinion it was a great call (given the current times). Emphasis on strong balance sheet, strong hedges, and cash in the bank. I know the div wasn't much to write home about, however, it's too early to pop the champagne cork and I appreciate management's caution."
The results are a disappointment and they attempted to soften it with the declaration of a small dividend. Adjusted EBITDA is about about the same for Q1 and Q2 and production was only margina lly better. Higher prices for crude (92% of Brent in CA) were wasted by hedge losses. There will be an opportunity to buy at distressed prices at the open tomorrow. Hopefully they will spin a good story of the impact of hedge extinguishment for the second half or this will be dead money.
BRY is up 14.35% to 2.55
I hope their earnings report will be good as their hedge position is strong. come on $5.00

"Sorry I meant $45 and $40. Berry is such a well run company, it’s just too big of a secret. Needs to be taken private, they have no need for this circus, go private and enjoy less stress"
So why the bullishness all of a sudden? Thanks
"Claim growth potential yet newly named VP’s have little experience in CA and mainly tenure from small-time operators (Nuevo etc.) and the old family owned biz which went bankrupt after Lynn acquisition. Lost key Management with greater than 100kbbls/day experience in 2020. Can’t grow production without permitting efficiency in CA. Operations Upper Management and is severely underwhelming and myopic and came from assets outside CA (CO, UT) making no profit and lacking basic thermal production understanding. Look for type curves and falling project ROI’s in the face of double oil price. Obvious issues and lack of accountability. Lawsuits in 2021 from understating internal process deficiencies and overstating permit/project value. Pump and dump CEO. Buyer beware."
Marathon Petroleum announced that they will be temporarily idling an oil refinery in NorCal. The carnage is coming.
BRY is up 6.17% to 11.71
This thing goes to the moon. Not selling till 16 minimum
"Really quiet guys,what do you all think of the call?Personally I think they are moving in the right direction,with their shoring up the bank account and increasing production plus able to sell outside of hedges at today's and projected future prices ,it may take a while but i believe she will go up,, with my cost basis yielding 4% I will hold and wait with some in and out trading at the appropriate times"
They beat me in Linn don't know if I want trust them again....?

Looks like a new 52 week low on the open this morning for this stock. $ 6 . 8 5 . . . . . Not good.. Try to keep your powder dry or have an exit strategy if this goes below $ 6 . 5 0 . . . Next support is in the 5's... The dividend will be at risk in this environment of risk off and survival.. California is NO Help......

"A bit up today on low volume ,Hope's for a decent report, no dividend payout should put a little toward the coffers, and strengthen the bottom line ,got a lot of confidence in this management team of experienced people"
"High volume today,jitters from election and 3rd quarter results i guess ,but looking forward Bry has good prospects .Won't be surprised if another company takes a run at them ,stock way too cheap.Holding at approx. 23,000 bod"
BRY is up 11.93% to 2.44
Barry should immediately cut ALL spending and be ready for the Demand Destruction that the Pandemic is going to cause. Bloomberg is reporting that $20 a barrel Oil is coming because of OPEC & Russia now releasing unlimited amounts of Oil onto the world markets.. Unfortunately Oil is going down even lower...
To 16
BRY reached a 52 Week low at 5.45
...and 1/2 of their production is hedged at $46/bbl for 2021. Ya - I'm just kind of in total disbelief at the share price.
"I'm sure you all know but the CA bill SB 467 did not make it out of the subcommittee meeting. That is a big sigh of relief. That was the bill that had the very broad definition of fracking in it, among other things. Next up - the LLL-CalGem report.... but again - it was just so good to see rational minds prevail in CA."
"12% dividend rate at this price. Even if they drop the dividend 50%, it's still a 6% yield rate. Let's hope this oil price war doesn't last too long and that calmer minds prevail."
Berry Petroleum is down 9.86% to 2.56
Wells Fargo just downgraded BRY on the regulatory risk that the company is facing in new California oil drilling regulations and potential risk.. State may reduce oil drilling and permits for future environmental protection...
