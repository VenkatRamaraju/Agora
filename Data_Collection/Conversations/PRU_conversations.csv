"Prudential Financial EPS beats by $0.36Feb. 4, 2021 4:21 PMPrudential Financial, Inc. (PRU)By: Gaurav Batavia, SA News EditorEven better than the earnings report...“The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of its outstanding Common Stock during the period from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021. In addition, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share of Common stock, payable on March 11, 2021, to shareholders of record as of February 16, 2021, representing an increase of 4.5% over the prior year dividend level and a 4.9% annualized yield on adjusted book value.”https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/news/3658783-prudential-financial-eps-beats-0_36"
When is dividend?
"How can PE be just 5,8? Is this a typo? I checked other sites too.. it was around 12 a month ago ? Comments?"
Well PRU has been a very pleasant surprise. I came in at $61 as an dividend income play. The capital gain has been pretty stunning and I haven't even collected my first dividend yet.
This stock is so under valued . their p/e is 15/1 while met life is almost 50/1 while Metlife has a eps of .33 and Pru is 6.38. Pru could easily be 150 share price makes no sence why Metlife PE ratio is more than 3 times pru
"The Fed needs have a program to provide near term capital, in the event that these companies have any liquidity issues due to the market and virus. Prudential should be ok, but the market needs reassurance that a safety net exists."
"Lesson learned, always buy tons under 100"
Today is dividend payout day. Has anyone got theirs yet? Still waiting for mine.
"Don't understand why PRU isn't worth a lot more given very low price to book, low PE ratio, strong cash flow, high dividend yield, higher than normal annual dividend increases, and good EPS growth projections by analysts covering the stock. Consensus EPS $9.89 going up to $11.71, an increase of 18%! Every time I want to sell covered calls, I look at the price and conclude it's way too cheap to risk losing. Can anyone on this message board tell me why this stock isn't cheap as it appears, and what risks I need to consider before investing even more money into PRU?"
"just in : PRU) announced today the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share of Common Stock, payable on September 16, 2021, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 24, 2021."
Credit Suisse raises the PT on Prudential to 131 dollars from 125 dollars.
Down almost 7% in pre-market trading?
A solid company trading at a big discount. Yield 9.5%. I am accumulating at these levels and using DRIP. Before the bear is over I should have about 10K shs. Income you can retire on.
If I was to sell tomorrow my total yield would be just shy of 35% in less than a year. Total surprise as I just bought for the dividend. Sweet.
Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) reported quarterly earnings of $3.79 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $3.02 by 25.5 percent. This is a 104.86 percent increase over earnings of $1.85 per share from the same period last year.
"PRU on the Muve..hit 52wk high, near all time high, and still sporting a >4% div yield. Not too shabby..%^)"
"Net tangible assets ended up at $66 billion, an increase of nearly $6 billion over year-end 2019. Market cap less than $32 billion. $11.71 consensus EPS for 2021 and $13.08 for next year, an increase of 11.7%. The PE ratio for this year is only 6.8. Dividend yield was previously 5.3%, but PRU just increased it again by nearly 5%. Short ratio only 2.62%. This stock is cheap, and don't understand why the analysts hate insurance companies and have such low price targets. This stock should be trading at over $100! The board should consider taking this company private, or it should be acquired. PRU gets no respect, and should be part of everyone's diversified portfolio at this low price given the valuation, high dividend yield, and history of strong annual dividend increases."
up both days after ex-div..not too shabby
Prudential Financial reached a 52 Week high at 113.28
"what's up with pru. book value 167.00/share, 5.3% dividend yield. this is a screaming buy."
I don't think the earnings are sustainable.
oh yay - 52-Week High 110.12 10/08/202
buy buy
"""Prudential Financial Inc has agreed to sell its full-service retirement business to Great-West Lifeco Inc's U.S. unit Empower Retirement in a deal valued at C$4.45 billion ($3.51 billion)"" how will this effect the dividend and earnings?"
"It's a mystery why this isnt higher. They keep beating earnings by a lot, they are generating a ton of cash, and every year they increase the dividend. When interest rates go higher they should make more money. I wouldnt be surprised if someone tries to buyout the company it's so cheap."
We are going to 120
"Nice beat in quarterly earnings.Regardless of short term trade, bodes well for the future with dividend support and increases.Cheers to all longs!"
Credit Suisse went from a neutral to BUY—-with a price target of $ 124. today!
The world is not ending and strong companies adapt. People will need life insurance as well as other financial products and a company like PRU may get bruised but will survive and thrive in the future. Buying below $50 give a current high dividend and a lot of upside. If they happen to cut the dividend believe me they will have it back to these levels as soon as things level out. A fairly safe bet in these markets IMO
"I am thinking of converting an annuity I have with Vanguard to Prudential. I have my pension in an prudential annuity from my previous employer, and I am very happy with the way Pru is managing it. Anyone has opinion whether converting my Vanguard annuity to pru is a good idea?"
Piper Sandler raises the PT on Prudential to 115 dollars from 107 dollars.Maintains Neutral Rating.
"This company is an excellent income stock and also trades at a reasonable valuation. Dividend has not been cut at all in the last decade, only raised. I sold my AT&T shares today on news they were going to be slashing the dividend in half and bought more of PRU today as a replacement."
Not that I'm complaining but PRU is en Fuego for no known newsArguably one of the very best financial performers this year and that still better than 4% dividend is just awesome.If it breaks above 110 it probably won't stop until it crosses 120 barring a melt down in the market.
Will Monday open down 1.15 and traders freak? May be chance to add a bit
"Net income attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. of $2.828 billion or $6.98 per Common share versus netloss of $271 million or $0.70 per share for the year-ago quarter.• Record high after-tax adjusted operating income of $1.665 billion or $4.11 per Common share versus $897million or $2.22 per share for the year-ago quarter.• Book value per Common share of $145.05 versus $152.45 per share for the year-ago; adjusted book valueper Common share of $100.49 versus $99.71 per share for the year-ago.• Capital returned to shareholders of $842 million in the quarter, including dividends of $1.15 per Commonshare, representing a 5% yield on adjusted book value, versus $945 million in the year-ago quarter.• Parent company highly liquid assets of $5.4 billion(1) versus $5.3 billion for the year-ago.• Assets under management amounted to $1.663 trillion versus $1.481 trillion for the year-ago.• The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of an additional $0.5 billion of itsoutstanding Common Stock, increasing the authorization to up to $2.0 billion from January 1, 2021 throughDecember 31, 2021.Great report!"
I had seen a few people expressing concern with the dividend not being declared in the ER call yesterday. The CEO seemed to make a commitment to covering the dividend but I dug a bit deeper.I looked at past history and transcripts. It seems the Q4 ER call (in early February each year) corresponds with a dividend declare date but the declare date is usually 1-2 weeks after Q1-Q3 ER calls. Based on history I am guessing it will be next Tuesday 5/12.
Why does PRU have such a low P/E ratio?
"Bought at 62.50 after the crash last year and got out at 97.75. A nice gain in just over a year. That panic took the good companies down with the bad, not hoping for another crash but this is one stock I'll gladly jump back into if we get a correction."
What caused today's spike 1.29%? Interest rates are still way down and insurance companies live on interest.
