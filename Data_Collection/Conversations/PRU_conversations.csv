"wowza, PRU up ^ scope again. 14% gain in 1 month since starting position, plus caught the div...not too shabby. I used a 7 yr. blended P/E average chart for PRU- (4yrs. trailing P/E and 3yrs. fwd E estimates) - a good mix of periods of under and over valuation. PRU has a normal P/E of 8.84 for this period. IOW, it's FV. Using analysts avg. estimates for 13%E gain in FY2021, gives a EOFY21 price of >$102. And that's just returning to FV, not considering any effect of a double digit E. increase... a >5%yearly increasing, rock solid div.. works for me. %^). It's a keeper..."
Not just debt but rating their assets is probably now more difficult and how liquid are they really. IMHO
A solid company trading at a big discount. Yield 9.5%. I am accumulating at these levels and using DRIP. Before the bear is over I should have about 10K shs. Income you can retire on.

plenty of supply 67.8
"PRU ^ nearly 23% YTD, and still rocking >5% div yield. Not too shabby %^)"
"Lookin for income and came across PRS. Like the chart and divi, but can not figure out what it is?? no info. It trades at a healthy vol/day. Is it a REIT, ETF, Preferred, insurance co, sub of PRU?? What is its relationship to PRU."
"Interest rates more than doubled last 6 months. The prudential cash  hoard just keeps printing money for us, the fortunate shareholders"
Down almost 7% in pre-market trading?
"Not complaining, but why?"
Long PRU!!!
I made a big mistake. I didn't follow my rule to not trade individual stocks ! Can this go back up if market goesup??
Has anyone ever seen PRU up $10 in one day ? Awesome and amazing.
"Wow, hit $100+."
Sorry longs but I had to sell today because I think the whole market is tanking. Still a good company and I hope they keep the divy going for you guys. GLTA
Pru gonna make new yearly highs past 110
Guy Adami just picked PRU as his final trade into earnings next week!!!
if it gets another dollar tomorrow it will be bumping up against the upper Bollinger band. It might be time to sell some out of the money calls
"Per Yahoo, year over year quarterly sales are down 16%. Rivals are not down this much and some are up. Is there a good reason for this? Hoping they sold a division or something along those lines because I am long."
Best stock ever. Lucky to have average down price to 59 a year ago.
why the last time we were down here i bought and sold some at 115 time to buy
RBC lifts PRU price target to 70 dollars from 63 dollars.Maintains Sector Perform Rating.
Why PRU forward P/E 7 so cheap and it is still under book value with interest spread is rising? Wierd. The income is stable and predictable with expanding wealth management in Asia
"just in : PRU) announced today the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share of Common Stock, payable on September 16, 2021, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 24, 2021."
PRU beats.
broke 60 HERE WE GO
I guess 39 was a good buy.
"This company is an excellent income stock and also trades at a reasonable valuation. Dividend has not been cut at all in the last decade, only raised. I sold my AT&T shares today on news they were going to be slashing the dividend in half and bought more of PRU today as a replacement."
The world is not ending and strong companies adapt. People will need life insurance as well as other financial products and a company like PRU may get bruised but will survive and thrive in the future. Buying below $50 give a current high dividend and a lot of upside. If they happen to cut the dividend believe me they will have it back to these levels as soon as things level out. A fairly safe bet in these markets IMO
when this go 90
"yowza, PRU moving ^ again.. After lower 2020FY Covid earnings, double digits E. gains est. for 2021 and 2022. Still just below it's historical FV, superb yield, great DGR, A credit rating, 20%LT debt.. works for me %^). All great cos.return to FV."
What a beautiful stock!
when zacks and yahoo finance say sell buy buy buy you will be the winner
Will Monday open down 1.15 and traders freak? May be chance to add a bit
Interest rates will have an impact. They need to match their assets with their liabilities in duration and yield. Their Liabilities are mostly long duration. When LT rates go down they will have difficulty making money on new business.
I sold my position before end of day. There isn’t any catalyst that will move this much higher in the short term. There is plenty of downside with low interest rates and a management team that has not shown they can deliver.
PRU will outperform SP500 this year. our share price will appreciate between 15% to 30% plus dividends
"Let’s go, PRU. I have 1000 shares now. I keep buying the dips."
"It's a mystery why this isnt higher. They keep beating earnings by a lot, they are generating a ton of cash, and every year they increase the dividend. When interest rates go higher they should make more money. I wouldnt be surprised if someone tries to buyout the company it's so cheap."
"How secure is the dividend, any thoughts ?"
"Did Prudential get hacked? My company has their 401K through PRU, woke up this AM and all the money in my Guaranteed Income Fund was ZERO. Should have been hundreds of thousands. Made calls and PRU just does not pick up even after 1 hour. Called my 401K admin and they somehow got through, PRU said they had a reporting issue. Then their website puts out that message. Check back few hours later and my account had over $1 Billion in it. LOL. Check back later and my account is gone.This is more than a reporting issue. This looks like a hack."
En fuego!
"Loaded up both my own and wife's retirement accounts, as a longer term investment with PRU at about 42 Sp, in this downturn.This is a pure gift, IMO at all these crazy low levels below 70.The management team, fundamentals and dividend of this company are all terrific.When the market's sanity returns, PRU will be over 100 dollars.Cheers to all longs."
"PRU is still my largest position, however I've been taking profits and reinvesting into energy. I am looking to keep my final shares with an eye toward selling some out of the money calls. If we are at $93 Tuesday hopefully I can get a good price for the $97.50 March calls as a slight hedge."
JPM keeps PRU at Overweight Rating.Price target reduced to 91 dollars from 93 dollars.
"Despite operating in a low interest rates environment, PRU has managed to grow earnings by more than 11% annually for the past five years, from $6.70 EPS in 2012 to $11.31 EPS in 2017. 2018 can only be better."
EPS $3.22 which is over analyst estimate of $3.07. Revenues slightly down. Good report. If she dips more than 5% I will be doubling my posittion.
We are still trading at $70 below book.
"Huge net loss? Doesn't sound so good to me. Here's the first line from the first bullet point: ""Net loss attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. of $2.409 billion or $6.12 per Common share""That's a huge net loss. Am I missing something good?"
"why are all the messages i look at so old, nothing new in recent days"
PRU mainly hold fixed income investments. those are going through the roof. next quarter will have record profit
"My company's stock price is down 33% in six months, Time for a new CEO that can verbalize their thoughts to their stock holders. Anything would be nice to hear. Make up anything, I'll probably believe it at this point."
Lets try this post again. Pru stock down almost $10 a share times over 400 million shares = over 4 billion in shareloss due to reported earnings (bs). I am not a financial expert by no means (sounds like a song) but this loss dueto a small loss ???? is outrageous. It seems like some kind of stock manipulation IMO. I don't know if anyone canexplain it so that I could understand. Any experts out there can explain a near $10 drop in stock price.
Book value over $90 and cash over $50.
"With a discounted future cash flow of $ 142./ sh. & a current share price of $ 93., & low debt this is a deep discount of 35% to FMV. With abroad portfolio of prop. & casualty, Life & Health & disability with regulated product pricing by state insurance commissioners, there is no financial or product explanation for the deeply discounted stock price.Greg C. Esq."
I know the news on interest rate inversion is hammering stocks this morning but I think PRU is heading for new 52 week low. 
"It's really quite simple. Pull up a 5 year chart and again explain to me per your thesis, why this is going higher. Let's think about that for a minute or two."
"Strong weekly chart, move coming to get back to 75 maybe more."
"This company has good fundamentums, good divident growth and cheap prize. Extremely undervalued. Bought 25 shares today at 100.50. Like it!"
PRU correlation with China deal? Seems to be very responsive both ways to China news.....are they involved with Chinese markets? I understand Japan but have never seen any tie in with China. Anybody know?
Any input on how long term care insurance exposure may effect PRU
up both days after ex-div..not too shabby
I was wrong in saying that PRU would raise its dividend since it was a year since the last raise. It has only been 9 months since the last raise in Feb of this year. We must now wait till this coming Feb 2020 for the next raise in dividend.
The biggest issue is not death payments but investment return in a low interest environment. Stop panicking.
Prudential might be the most solid financial company around and the safest; I cannot believe this company trades at such a low PE
My routine is to add a few shares prior to ex dividend but share price seems a bit frothy right now.
I have yet to hear any rational explanation for price drop in this stock. Does anyone want to venture a valid explanation? It appears undervalued based on just about every metric. What am I missing???
Very likely $100 by June and a possible $125- $130 for new highs this year.
Stock can’t hold any gains...what’s up with that?
Day before the dividend. Of course
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-hold-prudential-pru-144802768.html
"what's up with pru. book value 167.00/share, 5.3% dividend yield. this is a screaming buy."
Morgan Stanley raises the PT on PRU to 85 dollars from 76 dollars.Maintains: Equal weight
"hi all, 6.4%yield, book value 166 per share, more cash on hand than total debt, what's not to love about this stock. l bought 1000 shares at 63 bucks. thinking about adding more."
This stock deserves to trade in the 120s; dirt cheap with high dividend and completely safe
"Is it just me, or do companies use stock buybacks at the wrong time? PRU suspended share buybacks last year when the stock bottomed, now after the stock price has doubled they announce they will starting buying back their own stock? Wouldnt it have made more sense to buyback stock last year when it was $45, and suspended the program now, that the stock is near its long term average?"
Let's get rational with simple math - EPS growth rate from 2019 to 2020: (13.81-12.64)/12.64 = 9.26TTM EPS * growth rate w/ 5% margin of error = (3.15+2.44+3+3.14)*(9.26*0.95) = $103.19
Insurance companies are the perfect inflation hedge. They will benefit greatly from the coming inflation.
Stephanie Link said today on Halftime Report that she took a position in PRU. Called it cheap. Likes the dividend and planned buy back
I don't think the earnings are sustainable.
this stock pays dividend? this stock will go 200$? what ur opinion
PRU is way undervalued and earnings guidance is positive. Why is this thing stuck below $115 when it should be closer to $125+?
As the market drops I am buying in small bites as it falls. Here I buy in either 25 or 50 share buys
Bought this last week. Cramer said he didn’t like it last night. If you do the opposite of what he says you will get rick.
JPM maintains Overweight Rating on Prudential.Adjust Price Target to 93 dollars from 99 dollars.MS raises PT from 72 to 74Maintains Equal-weight Rating.
when was the last time PRU actually met earnings expectations? 5-6 missed quarters in a row.
Dividend declared nice yield
Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) reported quarterly earnings of $3.79 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $3.02 by 25.5 percent. This is a 104.86 percent increase over earnings of $1.85 per share from the same period last year.
"I hope people bought shares of this in the 40s,50,s60s,and 70,s when you do your own research and just use the experts for reference"
Morgan Stanley raises the PT on Prudential to 99 dollars from 90 dollars.Maintains: Equal Weight Rating.
got in around 64 .my money guy put me on to this .glad he did. the div yield along is worth it. If and when interest rates go up this will soar.
target short term down to 63 Buy there
Pending a fairly good earnings report I’m buying more this is one of my favorite long dividend stocks
"sure if left lower interest rates hurt their investment income but only if they dont recoup expenses from digital transformation, more income from derivatives and more profit from selling risk products and less capital products. Sure execution will require management and leadership... I dont know the CEO but hopefully the board is engaged too..... eh what do I know..."
"Pull up the MAX stock price chart for PRU and you will see that this stock has the same price as it had on August 1, 2009. That's almost 12 YEARS ago. I realize everything is down in this market, but you really need to look at the long term ""relative performance""........it's not good."
Credit Suisse went from a neutral to BUY—-with a price target of $ 124. today!
Yields increasing. Operations solid. Limited to no exposure to recent hurricanes. No reason for PRU to be below $110. Market recovers but PRU does not??? What am I missing? Somebody please explain. This one is does not make sense.
"I guess Falling Bond prices is hurting them since that will be reflected in their Book Values, but the Increasing Yield should be causing these stocks to go Up since earnings should be higher."
I’m in at $105
This should be a 150 stock price with this kind of performance
"Don't understand why PRU isn't worth a lot more given very low price to book, low PE ratio, strong cash flow, high dividend yield, higher than normal annual dividend increases, and good EPS growth projections by analysts covering the stock. Consensus EPS $9.89 going up to $11.71, an increase of 18%! Every time I want to sell covered calls, I look at the price and conclude it's way too cheap to risk losing. Can anyone on this message board tell me why this stock isn't cheap as it appears, and what risks I need to consider before investing even more money into PRU?"
"Prudential, the great American company is estimating the jobs in Dresher Pennsylvania. letting everyone go in the Life claims division shipping everything out to India. great paying jobs with benefits are no longer than normal at this company. And in fact new people don't even have a retirement program. they have stripped down the salaries of their workers so much that they should really never win any award for treating any employees great ever again. as the board and CEO become richer they do it at the expense of quality jobs that used to exist and no longer do. Trump should step in or an activist investor."
"On the first trading day of 2018 PRU opened at $115. On the first trading day of 2019 PRU opened at $79. This represents a 31% decrease, year to year. How is it that no one in PRU management is held accountable for this stock price collapse ?"
Well PRU has been a very pleasant surprise. I came in at $61 as an dividend income play. The capital gain has been pretty stunning and I haven't even collected my first dividend yet.
"PRU on the Muve ^ again, still <9 P/E, triple d's price in sight, another div payday a month away.. not too shabby ...%^ )"
Seems every time this goes above 100 the market tanks and this thing drops like a rock
bought the dip a day ear ugh
I had seen a few people expressing concern with the dividend not being declared in the ER call yesterday. The CEO seemed to make a commitment to covering the dividend but I dug a bit deeper.I looked at past history and transcripts. It seems the Q4 ER call (in early February each year) corresponds with a dividend declare date but the declare date is usually 1-2 weeks after Q1-Q3 ER calls. Based on history I am guessing it will be next Tuesday 5/12.
"I was just researching PRU again. Pulled up a 5 year chart. The share price on 6/30/2014 was $91.88/share, about where it closed today 2/14/2019. I added all the dividend payments from then until now assuming you had 100 shares. That total is $1295 So $1295/$91.88= 14%. The 5 yr total return is 14% and it's all dividend. Just the facts, not to hurt anyone......hopefully to help someone. GLTA"
Anybody know when the X-Div date is?
"the 20 mda was fairly predictable today. Even if we close under it for a couple of days, it's still a smart entry for a swing trade."
seems like a better place to stash cash. their valuation is VERY low right now!
Not sure what to make of it.Down 5 yesterday up 3 today and nothing changed.Was thinking to add at 63 this morning after listening to the uninspiring CC webcast last evening.Not complaining though. I'm good with the shares I got at 58 last summer. For me it's a dividend play with opportunity for above average growth.
"Nice jump at the open today. Up $4.41 or 5.7%. No news, except for the win of the Georgia Senate Dems. Maybe investors are encouraged by the demise of the Deceiver-In-Chief. But the Dems will have their own big challenges, especially if they (with the Republicans) keep running up the national debt over COVID. A couple of years from now, we could see inflation soar. Even divvies of 5% could be dwarfed by inflation at 6 or 7 %. -Scott"
niceee!
Was there a dividend paid on the 25th yesterday? I don't see the # of my shares changed...
"All financials have been hammered; including PFG, PRU, MET, LNC, C, KEY, JPM------------this is a sector depression that will in very soon and very forcefully. Hold onto your financials and collect the dividends."
Earnings look to be very good. If guidance is equally as optimistic we could see a dividend increase and additional stock buy back. Glad I have a piece of the rock!
"my wild guess: next midsummer the 10 yr treasury will be above 1.4%, the employment participation rate will finally start to inch up, and PRU will be back to $85ish, and the sp500 will be around $3800;"
"Nice beat in quarterly earnings.Regardless of short term trade, bodes well for the future with dividend support and increases.Cheers to all longs!"
"There is something terribly amiss here. This stock is solid. Making a nice profit, buying back stock and paying anice dividend. What in the world would cause this stock to drop from aprox 125 to 94. roughly 25 Pct. I'm nota professional money man (maybe thats the problem) and can't see anything this company is doing to merita drop of 25 or so percent. Something fishy."
Where else can you get four per cent on your money with a relatively stable stock
"Prudential Financial EPS beats by $0.36Feb. 4, 2021 4:21 PMPrudential Financial, Inc. (PRU)By: Gaurav Batavia, SA News EditorEven better than the earnings report...“The Company’s Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of its outstanding Common Stock during the period from January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021. In addition, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share of Common stock, payable on March 11, 2021, to shareholders of record as of February 16, 2021, representing an increase of 4.5% over the prior year dividend level and a 4.9% annualized yield on adjusted book value.”https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/news/3658783-prudential-financial-eps-beats-0_36"
Does anyone know what date you have to have shares in order to receive the next dividend ?
"Everybody has different goals but for me 5.5% yield with future increasing payouts is too good to ignore. PRU is hedged and reinsured and will survive any short term stress whether interest rates or economic slowdown. Definitely not a high growth, capital gain stock although at this price there is even a bit of recovery gain to be had eventually too imo."
What is this stocks profile?
"The Fed needs have a program to provide near term capital, in the event that these companies have any liquidity issues due to the market and virus. Prudential should be ok, but the market needs reassurance that a safety net exists."
"""Prudential Financial Inc has agreed to sell its full-service retirement business to Great-West Lifeco Inc's U.S. unit Empower Retirement in a deal valued at C$4.45 billion ($3.51 billion)"" how will this effect the dividend and earnings?"
Was there something in the call that was negative? I don’t get why this is down almost 4%
"5:03 pm ET August 4, 2020 (Benzinga): Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) reported quarterly earnings of $1.85 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $1.71 by 8.19 percent. This is a 41.08 percent decrease over earnings of $3.14 per share from the same period last year."
"I wouldn't be surprised to see the sp500 take a breather at this point and fall another 300 or 420 points from here over the next few trading days. however, PRU is a good place to be over the short term and long term. I refuse to sell at this point so close to exdiv."
Not that I'm complaining but PRU is en Fuego for no known newsArguably one of the very best financial performers this year and that still better than 4% dividend is just awesome.If it breaks above 110 it probably won't stop until it crosses 120 barring a melt down in the market.
"Follow the 10 year bond and you will see the direction of PRU in the near future. The main driver of PRU stock price has been its ability to earn money on its liquid assets. As this differential has dropped over the last 3 years so has its stock price. Makes sense really as the idea behind insurance is that the company will be able to earn more money off of the insureds payments, than the future payout at time of insureds loss.PRU has done a nice job expanding its business over time, but it has been fighting an uphill battle with earnings on liquid assets. All in all earnings have remained relatively stable, but investor sentiment has dropped (thus the long term declining stock price).The run up over the last few weeks has been fueled by investment spread optimism (increase in 10 year rates points towards investment spread increase).Don't worry too much about earnings as PRU's reaction to them rarely makes sense. Normal price to earnings ratios also rarely apply to PRU. It is the investment spread earnings that really determine the stock price.Hopefully we have seen the bottom for spread earnings and are entering into a period of long term increases.Curbie2"
Today is dividend payout day. Has anyone got theirs yet? Still waiting for mine.
"Okay, this may get reaction as a dumb question but I'm old and don't really care. I bought PRU at 60.99 less than a year ago as a safe dividend play. As it's turning out it's been my best growth play by a wide margin. I just have to admit to being clueless why the value has gone up so much so quickly. Can I get a rational explanation please. Simply curious."
What was that at 1:45pm..... a squeeze? Whatever it was congrats to everyone who has taken a once in a generation move and stayed the coarse without selling over the past yr.
What caused today's spike 1.29%? Interest rates are still way down and insurance companies live on interest.
How many shares will Prudential shareholders get of the spinoff?
Just recently bought 858 shares. With a div of 1.10 per share. very happy.
This stock is lower today than it was 15 years ago in 2005. Is there anyone here who works for the company ?
JPMorgan maintains overweight with 110 price target. they must know something we don't because there is no shareholder value created with this company.
"Shareholders....(and I'm not one of them), PRU did the same thing last quarter. Miss on EPS and revenue and provide NO guidance for the next quarter. Then they will come out next week and warn on the next quarter. Like they can't give the investment community that information NOW. I hope an analyst ask for next quarter guidance on the CC tomorrow morning. Not wishing anyone bad luck here, but even with the higher dividend I would NOT own this stock. And by the way increasing the dividend on a drop in profit and revenues is NOT a good sign. Just visit the AT&T board and see the hell they are living thru, with discussions about living to 150 years old so that their dividends will cover their decline in the stock price. GLTA"
headed to 75
JPM raises the PT on PRU to 105 dollars from 91 dollars.Maintains Neutral Rating.
"Jenny Harrington, CEO, Portfolio Manager at Gilman Hill Asset Management, is very positive on the results and holds this as a long term position. I have been long on this one for a while and enjoy the dividends and buy backs."
Goldman Sachs initiates coverage on PRU with a BUY Rating.Price target: 88 dollars.
Buyer- any time dips below $99
it went down bc dividend was paid today. People sell to get dividend.
"Once the virus passes, pru will head back to 100 !"
Bought more today at $103.75
Forward P/E of 6 trading at 1/2 BV yielding 5% for an extremely profitable company? Crazily undervalued.
"I am thinking of converting an annuity I have with Vanguard to Prudential. I have my pension in an prudential annuity from my previous employer, and I am very happy with the way Pru is managing it. Anyone has opinion whether converting my Vanguard annuity to pru is a good idea?"
90.00 a share by end of July.
"Looks like they knocked earnings out of the park, everything looked great. Am I wrong?"
loaded up more @57 this is a strong company
Frankly it would great if some people on this board could a) construct a sentence B) communicate their thoughts clearly
Why no reaction after stellar earnings?
PRU earnings 13 dollars a share next year stock should be closer imo to 100.
How much exposure does PRU have to REITs? Separately I do think there will be downturn with this stock before this goes higher based on higher than anticipated mortality due to Covid and prolonged economic impact.
What percentage of their bond holdings BBBs and lower? Where they heavily financing commercial real estate? do they do much face to face selling? Earnings from fees or spreads may become compressed with the 10yr rate collapse. Valuations becomes tricky and always lag but I am still hopeful
So they missed expectations wow... oh wait but earnings up.... low debt low payout ratio .... good div yield and ROE... low PE low price to book value....... eh I will hold and may buy more at this price and my age its still better than a guaranteed annuity....
"lol, RBC upgrade. Of course. Low PE and still below book value with tailwinds. it is setting up the climbing ladder pattern to step higher and higher as bond income increases"
"interesting stock. Most insurance companies have a fairly stable share price. This one fluctuates as much as $25 per share. I cannot figure out why. I just sit back, ignore the share price and collect the dividend."
I got in at 40 last year and receiving over 11%!!!! Great for a retiree!!!
"Bought at 62.50 after the crash last year and got out at 97.75. A nice gain in just over a year. That panic took the good companies down with the bad, not hoping for another crash but this is one stock I'll gladly jump back into if we get a correction."
Upbeat conference call + 4% dividend + $6 below adjusted book value! Worth $100 at least.
Earnings morning or after close?
I don't think we are going to hit the $33-37 zone . I think at worst we may hit $38-40 if Dow goes to 16-17k. Pru may be range bound $41-50ish. I'm thinking of adding more at $42ish. What do you all think?
time to start bonus discussions. increases of 20% at least! make sure management get their options awarded at 80. they really deserve to get RICHLY rewarded for their social experiments great job guys
"I think I was Smart adding a few at 99 today.. dialed in with my shoe phone, would you believe?"
"if it drops more, I'll just buy at a discount price."
"Up 16.9% in one month since initial purchase, and still sporting a 5%+ div yield.. not too shabby %^) . It's a keeper."
PRU looks like a great value with a great dividend. This stock can do well with or without the market.
"Howdy all. Note PRU up $2.37 today, times 417.71 shares = nearly a billion dollars increasein PRU value today. Not because of some financial deal but due to a Goldman buy recommendation.Isn't it ironic that word of mouth is more important than actual financial dealings. Also works on thenegative side as well. Since the stock market can be influenced by word of mouth rather than on actual dealings of a company, it is in my opinion a big hoax and you had better be able todecifer what is coming out verbally by various brokers vs what is real."
who got their dividend thumbs up
We are doing good here. Collect healthy dividends from strong company
"Bought new PRU @92 this am.. wow-woo..that's a 5% fwd div yield. Still below it's historical FV, double digit % E gain est. thru 2022. Rock solid divs w/ DGR averaging 5+% yearly, A credit rating, ultra-low debt.Just a return to PRU's own historic blended P/E at EOFY22 would be ~14% ROR. works for me..."
Credit Suisse raises the PT on PRU to 121 dollars from 79 dollars.Rating: Outperform from Neutral.
"Lather, rinse, repeat, here's what I wrote just before the last q report: think this is a good company to own, all the metrics are pretty good. That said, I think its been a while since it reported and didn't take a dive after reporting. So this recent run-up seems like a chance to take a few gains, then get back in a day or three later. I won't do that, but not a bad strategy, especially if its a retirement acct and doesn't have tax implications."
Anyone on the call? The stock is all over the place
"Net tangible assets ended up at $66 billion, an increase of nearly $6 billion over year-end 2019. Market cap less than $32 billion. $11.71 consensus EPS for 2021 and $13.08 for next year, an increase of 11.7%. The PE ratio for this year is only 6.8. Dividend yield was previously 5.3%, but PRU just increased it again by nearly 5%. Short ratio only 2.62%. This stock is cheap, and don't understand why the analysts hate insurance companies and have such low price targets. This stock should be trading at over $100! The board should consider taking this company private, or it should be acquired. PRU gets no respect, and should be part of everyone's diversified portfolio at this low price given the valuation, high dividend yield, and history of strong annual dividend increases."
It’s a good buying opportunity with the overall drop in insurance for some reason today.
They killed it book value 163. When you compare the metrics against MET it really should be trading at 163!!
How are they still covering this dividend?
Price looks headed to December low... then buyers will step in... that's what the charts look like
"Any good news from company, or what is this over 4% ?"
"My dad worked for Prudential during the '60s, '70s, and '80s. He primarily sold insurance in face to face meetings. He had benefits, and assets through the company which when he died were transferred to my mom. I had heard through both my parents that the company was difficult to deal with. I can say from personal experience, that the company seemed totally dysfunctional. They did pay the insurance promptly. However, my mom received my dads pension. When she died, they sent letters saying that the pension had been overpaid. I sent them a check, which the company never cashed. A few months later I received a second letter saying that I still owed the money. I sent a second letter. This time certified. I received a letter back saying that the money was not owed.Its been a couple of years since I cleaned out all the accounts at Prudential. I recently received a letter from the Prudential Employees Savings program (PEST) saying that there were assets in the account. I have to call and verify that there were not assets in the account. Crazy."

"How can PE be just 5,8? Is this a typo? I checked other sites too.. it was around 12 a month ago ? Comments?"
When is dividend?
Looks like Pru will be using the retiree same money to pay down debt. Setting a nice tone for the earnings call.
"I love this company stock, great deal!"
"Can Someone tell me additional free message boards that I can follow comments on Pru? In the day I used to follow conversations on Raging Bull, but it's not available to me now. There was another one, but I can't remember. Thank You!"

"the market is no longer afraid of negative rates, instead spreads have really moved nicely with the 10 yr t billbreaking out, Jamie diamond signaled the economy is surprising to the upside, the sp500 found support at 3090, PRU has room to run to $79... however by the 3rd week of June the market might start paying attention to how the ppp loans are impacting the economy."
"After my own research this checks all the boxes for me. Taking a substantial position and holding. Low risk long term, I believe."
wait to buy till low 60s. get a better price when PRU inevitably goes on sale again.
Pru makes their profits on the spread in the products. Those gross margins get crushed with interest rates dropping. It’s all about the 10 year treasury. When that recovers. Then I’m a buyer. Until them. I’m resting my money.
This stock should be trading no less than $85-$90 a share and that’s an absolute minimum! IMO & after seeing yesterday’s Q3 numbers it is my opinion that PRU should be easily trading up into the triple digits! I don’t care what anyone says and all the clear corruption this stock is extremely cheap!!! BUY IT!
"Home run on EPS this quarter. 6.98 versus Street estimate of 2.75Ignore the negative short term trade, as usual.Analysts will raise PT's."
A 5/1 PE ratio #$%$ even if this stock doubled to 200 its pe ratio would be less than 99% of stocks out there. This stock is so under valued its not funny
Took a small position. The dividend should double again imho in 7yrs.
"Ex dividend date tomorrow, may 21."
This stock is so under valued . their p/e is 15/1 while met life is almost 50/1 while Metlife has a eps of .33 and Pru is 6.38. Pru could easily be 150 share price makes no sence why Metlife PE ratio is more than 3 times pru

Citigroup raises the PT on PRU to 80 dollars from 58 dollars.
Great week for PRU shareholders who bought back at $45.Better days ahead with more jobs & the flu going away!!!!
Incredible earnings!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"$2 billion in share buybacks would represent 5% of the market cap. That's a pretty significant return right there. Add a generous dividend and super-low ""now"" Forward P/E and we could see ~$130-140 SP this year quite possibly"
is rising interest rate good for this stock? or rising yield
Finally! Going up after hours let’s hope it holds tomorrow
"Opinion: 10 value stocks to buy for 2020By Michael BrushPublished: Dec 20, 2019 12:59 p.m. ETSHARE 0Newsletter writers weigh in with their recommendations"
Low hanging fruit. All in. This is a keeper. Don't worry about short term trends/volatility. Buy and hold. Get back to me in 24 months when you will be a lot richer. Book value $120/share.
Pretty great stable dividend payer
"Prudential Financial, Inc. Announces Second Quarter 2021 ResultsPrudential Financial, Inc. reported second quarter results. Net income attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. was $2.158 billion ($5.40 per Common share) for the second quarter of 2021."
Average cost at 70 and I’m actually really happy with that...
"$293B of $310B of debt on PRU books is rated BBB or better, and of that $234B is rated A+ or better....PRU is not going away any time soon...and if it were to collapse we all have bigger problems to solve. Tangible Book value is over $100/shr."
"This would seem to be the perfect market for PRU to thrive (rising interest rates/volatile market). Its PE and relatively strong dividend would seem to scream ""buy"" in this environment. What am I missing? Why can it not seem to break out of this funk?"
AT&T has lied to me for so many years. Why should I trust PRU ? I seek a sustainable dividend with honest management. is that asking too much?
This will pop before 4th Feb earnings. Looks like earnings going to beat.
"Prudential tops Q4 earnings and revenue estimates, improves its cash from operations and it raises dividends. Great report and outlook. I am expecting the stock to be back over $100."
have to be Steven Hawking to understand the earnings of PRU. insurance companies have the most complicated financials of them all.
bought 5000 shares at 79 i cannot believe this stock is trading below 110 do the math
"Started a position this am. @ 77.9. It's under FV to itself historically, rock-solid div with a sweet yield and superb DGR... wporks for me %^ )."
"Lordy, up >10% in 4 trading days since last buy, with still >5% div yield...we dont need no stinkin' tech %^)"
Why is everyone convinced of dividend hike next quarter?
Cash per share 91.28 plus book value over 146.00. What is wrong. What am I missing?
So a leak prior to earnings?
If I was to sell tomorrow my total yield would be just shy of 35% in less than a year. Total surprise as I just bought for the dividend. Sweet.
"7 times PE with 14% Return on Equity , too cheap indeed"
"Recovery rallies from panic bottoms are often capped by triangles, low volume, currently in one now. Financials same triangle, Spy dbl top? waiting for better entry."
"said it yesterday and was mocked. No Guidance on earnings report always construed negatively. With the entire banking index down today it was obviously PRU would go with it, If market turns red due to election controversy over the next week i wouldn't put it past seeing this drop to mid 50s, where it would be a good spot to pick up. gl"
Anybody buying at this level ?
What are you current thoughts on PRU? I just started a small position and overall I was intrigued by the dividend and I needed exposure to insurance industry
"Listen up.....I used to own some PRU but don't any more. The TRUTH is this. This is a safe dividend stock but that is it. All you have to do is pull up a 5 year chart for the stock. It's trading very close to where it was 5 years ago. The dividend is great but if you are looking for TOTAL shareholder return, PRU is not a good stock. When it gets cheap (in teh $70's) it's a good trade in the $90's it's just a value trap of 4% yield. Better than cash but certainly not a good ""total return"" stock."
Anyone know why we're down today?
All the financials are up today but I like price action going into tonight’s report.
"When the insiders start buying, that will be the signal to start accumulating."
I hope existing shareholder will be getting shares in the new split off company. Or is this money just going to the CEO and CFO?
Thinking 60 today. Great buying opportunity.
Jumped in at $60 but mainly for the yield. Looks like some price appreciation is an added bonus.
Got in at 40 and change. Making over 11% on just the dividend! Life is good!
This appears to be a positive ? Correct me if I'm wrong. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prudential-financial-inc-redeem-1-201800742.html
"They have a significant Japan presence. With Covid 19, concern may be that the increase mortality rate from the virus could negatively impact their life insurance profitability."
"Anyone have good insight on why insurance stocks, like PRU, trade at such a low PE multiple given their very high dividend yields and generally strong cash flow?"
"it is my uderstanding from reading the annual report that low interest rates are not favorable to pru. if I am right, would someone more knowledgeable than me pleaseexplain why. Thanks"
"This is what the hipster apocalypse can do to reality. PRU with incredible revenue, assets, cash flow and dividend lingers while companies losing millions sky rocket. I am loading up every day."

It looks like they took a big charge after they marked down future interest earnings and lowered their rate projections. Apparently even after this quarter charge they still assume 3%+ future rate on 10 year treasure LT..........ouch... IMHO keeping fingers crossed they can underwrite and price better.
You guys remember when you could buy this under $50 and all the little violins were singing about this going to $0. The folks with the shmongus dogans were buying with both fists and you can count me in that number. See you at $150!
we are looking to close above the 20 deal of $81.62 as we head down the stretch to Feb 12th. btw for those who care about earnings: TTM $10.21 with a p/e of 8 would be $81.68 per share.
Big day today. Go Pru!
"S & P, Dow both up big but PRU down again. What’s wrong with it."
PRU is becoming an investment management company and someday it's price will reflect that. Stay long forever.
Will the recent hurricanes/floods affect PRU's earnings? They did for Allstate
I'm buying under 80.betting on it goes back to 100
All life insurance companies got pounded again today 8-10%. This is absurd. I know the virus is deadly but from what I can tell it kills the most in the 70+ age range. How many 70 yr olds do you know that carry life insurance? The odds that this affects PRU to that degree are silly. The biggest risk is we go into a severe recession and people stop paying premiums. Sure that hurts cash flow but also lessens risk exposure. This company is an extreme buy at these levels.
$120s. Here we come….
followed the same path they have historically. what a steal at this yield rate right now.Prudential Financial declares $1.10 dividend https://seekingalpha.com/news/3573577
