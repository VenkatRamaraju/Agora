What caused today's spike 1.29%? Interest rates are still way down and insurance companies live on interest.
Forward P/E of 6 trading at 1/2 BV yielding 5% for an extremely profitable company? Crazily undervalued.
"My dad worked for Prudential during the '60s, '70s, and '80s. He primarily sold insurance in face to face meetings. He had benefits, and assets through the company which when he died were transferred to my mom. I had heard through both my parents that the company was difficult to deal with. I can say from personal experience, that the company seemed totally dysfunctional. They did pay the insurance promptly. However, my mom received my dads pension. When she died, they sent letters saying that the pension had been overpaid. I sent them a check, which the company never cashed. A few months later I received a second letter saying that I still owed the money. I sent a second letter. This time certified. I received a letter back saying that the money was not owed.Its been a couple of years since I cleaned out all the accounts at Prudential. I recently received a letter from the Prudential Employees Savings program (PEST) saying that there were assets in the account. I have to call and verify that there were not assets in the account. Crazy."
"Anyone have good insight on why insurance stocks, like PRU, trade at such a low PE multiple given their very high dividend yields and generally strong cash flow?"
"Looks like they knocked earnings out of the park, everything looked great. Am I wrong?"
Where else can you get four per cent on your money with a relatively stable stock
oh yay - 52-Week High 110.12 10/08/202
What is this stocks profile?
Frankly it would great if some people on this board could a) construct a sentence B) communicate their thoughts clearly
Anybody know when the X-Div date is?
Not just debt but rating their assets is probably now more difficult and how liquid are they really. IMHO
"Nice beat in quarterly earnings.Regardless of short term trade, bodes well for the future with dividend support and increases.Cheers to all longs!"
"interesting stock. Most insurance companies have a fairly stable share price. This one fluctuates as much as $25 per share. I cannot figure out why. I just sit back, ignore the share price and collect the dividend."
I hope existing shareholder will be getting shares in the new split off company. Or is this money just going to the CEO and CFO?
Day before the dividend. Of course
A solid company trading at a big discount. Yield 9.5%. I am accumulating at these levels and using DRIP. Before the bear is over I should have about 10K shs. Income you can retire on.
I don't think we are going to hit the $33-37 zone . I think at worst we may hit $38-40 if Dow goes to 16-17k. Pru may be range bound $41-50ish. I'm thinking of adding more at $42ish. What do you all think?
time to start bonus discussions. increases of 20% at least! make sure management get their options awarded at 80. they really deserve to get RICHLY rewarded for their social experiments great job guys
Citigroup raises the PT on PRU to 80 dollars from 58 dollars.
I got in at 40 last year and receiving over 11%!!!! Great for a retiree!!!
Why does PRU have such a low P/E ratio?
"Let’s go, PRU. I have 1000 shares now. I keep buying the dips."
up both days after ex-div..not too shabby

"Huge net loss? Doesn't sound so good to me. Here's the first line from the first bullet point: ""Net loss attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. of $2.409 billion or $6.12 per Common share""That's a huge net loss. Am I missing something good?"
Sorry longs but I had to sell today because I think the whole market is tanking. Still a good company and I hope they keep the divy going for you guys. GLTA
"$293B of $310B of debt on PRU books is rated BBB or better, and of that $234B is rated A+ or better....PRU is not going away any time soon...and if it were to collapse we all have bigger problems to solve. Tangible Book value is over $100/shr."
Will the recent hurricanes/floods affect PRU's earnings? They did for Allstate
"Prudential Financial EPS beats by $0.36Feb. 4, 2021 4:21 PMPrudential Financial, Inc.

"Up 16.9% in one month since initial purchase, and still sporting a 5%+ div yield.. not too shabby %^) . It's a keeper."
"Shareholders....(and I'm not one of them), PRU did the same thing last quarter. Miss on EPS and revenue and provide NO guidance for the next quarter. Then they will come out next week and warn on the next quarter. Like they can't give the investment community that information NOW. I hope an analyst ask for next quarter guidance on the CC tomorrow morning. Not wishing anyone bad luck here, but even with the higher dividend I would NOT own this stock. And by the way increasing the dividend on a drop in profit and revenues is NOT a good sign. Just visit the AT&T board and see the hell they are living thru, with discussions about living to 150 years old so that their dividends will cover their decline in the stock price. GLTA"
bought the dip a day ear ugh
Dividend declared nice yield
Will Monday open down 1.15 and traders freak? May be chance to add a bit
As the market drops I am buying in small bites as it falls. Here I buy in either 25 or 50 share buys

"My company's stock price is down 33% in six months, Time for a new CEO that can verbalize their thoughts to their stock holders. Anything would be nice to hear. Make up anything, I'll probably believe it at this point."
This stock should be trading no less than $85-$90 a share and that’s an absolute minimum! IMO & after seeing yesterday’s Q3 numbers it is my opinion that PRU should be easily trading up into the triple digits! I don’t care what anyone says and all the clear corruption this stock is extremely cheap!!! BUY IT!
"Ex dividend date tomorrow, may 21."
We are still trading at $70 below book.
I have yet to hear any rational explanation for price drop in this stock. Does anyone want to venture a valid explanation? It appears undervalued based on just about every metric. What am I missing???
We are going to 120
"Okay, this may get reaction as a dumb question but I'm old and don't really care. I bought PRU at 60.99 less than a year ago as a safe dividend play. As it's turning out it's been my best growth play by a wide margin. I just have to admit to being clueless why the value has gone up so much so quickly. Can I get a rational explanation please. Simply curious."

Goldman Sachs initiates coverage on PRU with a BUY Rating.Price target: 88 dollars.
This should be a 150 stock price with this kind of performance
"I think I was Smart adding a few at 99 today.. dialed in with my shoe phone, would you believe?"
This stock is so under valued . their p/e is 15/1 while met life is almost 50/1 while Metlife has a eps of .33 and Pru is 6.38. Pru could easily be 150 share price makes no sence why Metlife PE ratio is more than 3 times pru
Today is dividend payout day. Has anyone got theirs yet? Still waiting for mine.
"hi all, 6.4%yield, book value 166 per share, more cash on hand than total debt, what's not to love about this stock. l bought 1000 shares at 63 bucks. thinking about adding more."
"""Prudential Financial Inc has agreed to sell its full-service retirement business to Great-West Lifeco Inc's U.S. unit Empower Retirement in a deal valued at C$4.45 billion ($3.51 billion)"" how will this effect the dividend and earnings?"
"Don't understand why PRU isn't worth a lot more given very low price to book, low PE ratio, strong cash flow, high dividend yield, higher than normal annual dividend increases, and good EPS growth projections by analysts covering the stock. Consensus EPS $9.89 going up to $11.71, an increase of 18%! Every time I want to sell covered calls, I look at the price and conclude it's way too cheap to risk losing. Can anyone on this message board tell me why this stock isn't cheap as it appears, and what risks I need to consider before investing even more money into PRU?"
Book value over $90 and cash over $50.
"Strong weekly chart, move coming to get back to 75 maybe more."
"Once the virus passes, pru will head back to 100 !"
Guy Adami just picked PRU as his final trade into earnings next week!!!
"It's really quite simple. Pull up a 5 year chart and again explain to me per your thesis, why this is going higher. Let's think about that for a minute or two."
PRU mainly hold fixed income investments. those are going through the roof. next quarter will have record profit
I sold my position before end of day. There isn’t any catalyst that will move this much higher in the short term. There is plenty of downside with low interest rates and a management team that has not shown they can deliver.
"PRU ^ nearly 23% YTD, and still rocking >5% div yield. Not too shabby %^)"
"PRU is still my largest position, however I've been taking profits and reinvesting into energy. I am looking to keep my final shares with an eye toward selling some out of the money calls. If we are at $93 Tuesday hopefully I can get a good price for the $97.50 March calls as a slight hedge."
followed the same path they have historically. what a steal at this yield rate right now.Prudential Financial declares $1.10 dividend https://seekingalpha.com/news/3573577
Not that I'm complaining but PRU is en Fuego for no known newsArguably one of the very best financial performers this year and that still better than 4% dividend is just awesome.If it breaks above 110 it probably won't stop until it crosses 120 barring a melt down in the market.
"Lordy, up >10% in 4 trading days since last buy, with still >5% div yield...we dont need no stinkin' tech %^)"
broke 60 HERE WE GO
"my wild guess: next midsummer the 10 yr treasury will be above 1.4%, the employment participation rate will finally start to inch up, and PRU will be back to $85ish, and the sp500 will be around $3800;"
This will pop before 4th Feb earnings. Looks like earnings going to beat.
Down almost 7% in pre-market trading?
Looks like Pru will be using the retiree same money to pay down debt. Setting a nice tone for the earnings call.
"what's up with pru. book value 167.00/share, 5.3% dividend yield. this is a screaming buy."
Price looks headed to December low... then buyers will step in... that's what the charts look like
PRU will outperform SP500 this year. our share price will appreciate between 15% to 30% plus dividends
This appears to be a positive ? Correct me if I'm wrong. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prudential-financial-inc-redeem-1-201800742.html
"This would seem to be the perfect market for PRU to thrive (rising interest rates/volatile market). Its PE and relatively strong dividend would seem to scream ""buy"" in this environment. What am I missing? Why can it not seem to break out of this funk?"
"Did Prudential get hacked? My company has their 401K through PRU, woke up this AM and all the money in my Guaranteed Income Fund was ZERO. Should have been hundreds of thousands. Made calls and PRU just does not pick up even after 1 hour. Called my 401K admin and they somehow got through, PRU said they had a reporting issue. Then their website puts out that message. Check back few hours later and my account had over $1 Billion in it. LOL. Check back later and my account is gone.This is more than a reporting issue. This looks like a hack."
How many shares will Prudential shareholders get of the spinoff?
EPS $3.22 which is over analyst estimate of $3.07. Revenues slightly down. Good report. If she dips more than 5% I will be doubling my posittion.
This stock deserves to trade in the 120s; dirt cheap with high dividend and completely safe
"Started a position this am. @ 77.9. It's under FV to itself historically, rock-solid div with a sweet yield and superb DGR... wporks for me %^ )."
got in around 64 .my money guy put me on to this .glad he did. the div yield along is worth it. If and when interest rates go up this will soar.
Pru gonna make new yearly highs past 110
I guess 39 was a good buy.
when was the last time PRU actually met earnings expectations? 5-6 missed quarters in a row.
"This company is an excellent income stock and also trades at a reasonable valuation. Dividend has not been cut at all in the last decade, only raised. I sold my AT&T shares today on news they were going to be slashing the dividend in half and bought more of PRU today as a replacement."
wait to buy till low 60s. get a better price when PRU inevitably goes on sale again.
Stock can’t hold any gains...what’s up with that?
"$2 billion in share buybacks would represent 5% of the market cap. That's a pretty significant return right there. Add a generous dividend and super-low ""now"" Forward P/E and we could see ~$130-140 SP this year quite possibly"
Cash per share 91.28 plus book value over 146.00. What is wrong. What am I missing?
"just in : PRU) announced today the declaration of a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share of Common Stock, payable on September 16, 2021, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 24, 2021."
"the 20 mda was fairly predictable today. Even if we close under it for a couple of days, it's still a smart entry for a swing trade."
Credit Suisse raises the PT on Prudential to 131 dollars from 125 dollars.
Let's get rational with simple math - EPS growth rate from 2019 to 2020: (13.81-12.64)/12.64 = 9.26TTM EPS * growth rate w/ 5% margin of error = (3.15+2.44+3+3.14)*(9.26*0.95) = $103.19
Finally! Going up after hours let’s hope it holds tomorrow
"After my own research this checks all the boxes for me. Taking a substantial position and holding. Low risk long term, I believe."
Bought this last week. Cramer said he didn’t like it last night. If you do the opposite of what he says you will get rick.
"This is what the hipster apocalypse can do to reality. PRU with incredible revenue, assets, cash flow and dividend lingers while companies losing millions sky rocket. I am loading up every day."
Does anyone know what date you have to have shares in order to receive the next dividend ?
"it is my uderstanding from reading the annual report that low interest rates are not favorable to pru. if I am right, would someone more knowledgeable than me pleaseexplain why. Thanks"
PRU looks like a great value with a great dividend. This stock can do well with or without the market.
niceee!
"How secure is the dividend, any thoughts ?"
"Can Someone tell me additional free message boards that I can follow comments on Pru? In the day I used to follow conversations on Raging Bull, but it's not available to me now. There was another one, but I can't remember. Thank You!"
"wowza, PRU up ^ scope again. 14% gain in 1 month since starting position, plus caught the div...not too shabby. I used a 7 yr. blended P/E average chart for PRU- (4yrs. trailing P/E and 3yrs. fwd E estimates) - a good mix of periods of under and over valuation. PRU has a normal P/E of 8.84 for this period. IOW, it's FV. Using analysts avg. estimates for 13%E gain in FY2021, gives a EOFY21 price of >$102. And that's just returning to FV, not considering any effect of a double digit E. increase... a >5%yearly increasing, rock solid div.. works for me. %^). It's a keeper..."
"Bought new PRU @92 this am.. wow-woo..that's a 5% fwd div yield. Still below it's historical FV, double digit % E gain est. thru 2022. Rock solid divs w/ DGR averaging 5+% yearly, A credit rating, ultra-low debt.Just a return to PRU's own historic blended P/E at EOFY22 would be ~14% ROR. works for me..."
is rising interest rate good for this stock? or rising yield
This stock is lower today than it was 15 years ago in 2005. Is there anyone here who works for the company ?
Bought more today at $103.75
"This company has good fundamentums, good divident growth and cheap prize. Extremely undervalued. Bought 25 shares today at 100.50. Like it!"
Jumped in at $60 but mainly for the yield. Looks like some price appreciation is an added bonus.
why the last time we were down here i bought and sold some at 115 time to buy
Just recently bought 858 shares. With a div of 1.10 per share. very happy.
JPM raises the PT on PRU to 105 dollars from 91 dollars.Maintains Neutral Rating.

Anybody buying at this level ?
"On the first trading day of 2018 PRU opened at $115. On the first trading day of 2019 PRU opened at $79. This represents a 31% decrease, year to year. How is it that no one in PRU management is held accountable for this stock price collapse ?"
"Net tangible assets ended up at $66 billion, an increase of nearly $6 billion over year-end 2019. Market cap less than $32 billion. $11.71 consensus EPS for 2021 and $13.08 for next year, an increase of 11.7%. The PE ratio for this year is only 6.8. Dividend yield was previously 5.3%, but PRU just increased it again by nearly 5%. Short ratio only 2.62%. This stock is cheap, and don't understand why the analysts hate insurance companies and have such low price targets. This stock should be trading at over $100! The board should consider taking this company private, or it should be acquired. PRU gets no respect, and should be part of everyone's diversified portfolio at this low price given the valuation, high dividend yield, and history of strong annual dividend increases."
"Jenny Harrington, CEO, Portfolio Manager at Gilman Hill Asset Management, is very positive on the results and holds this as a long term position. I have been long on this one for a while and enjoy the dividends and buy backs."
bought 5000 shares at 79 i cannot believe this stock is trading below 110 do the math
PRU is becoming an investment management company and someday it's price will reflect that. Stay long forever.
You guys remember when you could buy this under $50 and all the little violins were singing about this going to $0. The folks with the shmongus dogans were buying with both fists and you can count me in that number. See you at $150!
"PRU on the Muve ^ again, still <9 P/E, triple d's price in sight, another div payday a month away.. not too shabby ...%^ )"
when zacks and yahoo finance say sell buy buy buy you will be the winner
"How can PE be just 5,8? Is this a typo? I checked other sites too.. it was around 12 a month ago ? Comments?"
Pretty great stable dividend payer
I was wrong in saying that PRU would raise its dividend since it was a year since the last raise. It has only been 9 months since the last raise in Feb of this year. We must now wait till this coming Feb 2020 for the next raise in dividend.
Earnings morning or after close?
"Is it just me, or do companies use stock buybacks at the wrong time? PRU suspended share buybacks last year when the stock bottomed, now after the stock price has doubled they announce they will starting buying back their own stock? Wouldnt it have made more sense to buyback stock last year when it was $45, and suspended the program now, that the stock is near its long term average?"
"Prudential Financial, Inc. Announces Second Quarter 2021 ResultsPrudential Financial, Inc. reported second quarter results. Net income attributable to Prudential Financial, Inc. was $2.158 billion ($5.40 per Common share) for the second quarter of 2021."
Credit Suisse raises the PT on PRU to 121 dollars from 79 dollars.Rating: Outperform from Neutral.
Seems every time this goes above 100 the market tanks and this thing drops like a rock
Thinking 60 today. Great buying opportunity.
"The Fed needs have a program to provide near term capital, in the event that these companies have any liquidity issues due to the market and virus. Prudential should be ok, but the market needs reassurance that a safety net exists."
PRU earnings 13 dollars a share next year stock should be closer imo to 100.
"I was just researching PRU again. Pulled up a 5 year chart. The share price on 6/30/2014 was $91.88/share, about where it closed today 2/14/2019. I added all the dividend payments from then until now assuming you had 100 shares. That total is $1295 So $1295/$91.88= 14%. The 5 yr total return is 14% and it's all dividend. Just the facts, not to hurt anyone......hopefully to help someone. GLTA"
Any input on how long term care insurance exposure may effect PRU
Has anyone ever seen PRU up $10 in one day ? Awesome and amazing.
What's up today with this stock?
What a beautiful stock!
"said it yesterday and was mocked. No Guidance on earnings report always construed negatively. With the entire banking index down today it was obviously PRU would go with it, If market turns red due to election controversy over the next week i wouldn't put it past seeing this drop to mid 50s, where it would be a good spot to pick up. gl"
"Follow the 10 year bond and you will see the direction of PRU in the near future. The main driver of PRU stock price has been its ability to earn money on its liquid assets. As this differential has dropped over the last 3 years so has its stock price. Makes sense really as the idea behind insurance is that the company will be able to earn more money off of the insureds payments, than the future payout at time of insureds loss.PRU has done a nice job expanding its business over time, but it has been fighting an uphill battle with earnings on liquid assets. All in all earnings have remained relatively stable, but investor sentiment has dropped (thus the long term declining stock price).The run up over the last few weeks has been fueled by investment spread optimism (increase in 10 year rates points towards investment spread increase).Don't worry too much about earnings as PRU's reaction to them rarely makes sense. Normal price to earnings ratios also rarely apply to PRU. It is the investment spread earnings that really determine the stock price.Hopefully we have seen the bottom for spread earnings and are entering into a period of long term increases.Curbie2"
Upbeat conference call + 4% dividend + $6 below adjusted book value! Worth $100 at least.
Prudential Financial (NYSE:PRU) reported quarterly earnings of $3.79 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $3.02 by 25.5 percent. This is a 104.86 percent increase over earnings of $1.85 per share from the same period last year.
Morgan Stanley raises the PT on Prudential to 99 dollars from 90 dollars.Maintains: Equal Weight Rating.
"lol, RBC upgrade. Of course. Low PE and still below book value with tailwinds. it is setting up the climbing ladder pattern to step higher and higher as bond income increases"
"yowza, PRU moving ^ again.. After lower 2020FY Covid earnings, double digits E. gains est. for 2021 and 2022. Still just below it's historical FV, superb yield, great DGR, A credit rating, 20%LT debt.. works for me %^). All great cos.return to FV."
Got in at 40 and change. Making over 11% on just the dividend! Life is good!
"S & P, Dow both up big but PRU down again. What’s wrong with it."
Big day today. Go Pru!
Morgan Stanley raises the PT on PRU to 85 dollars from 76 dollars.Maintains: Equal weight
If I was to sell tomorrow my total yield would be just shy of 35% in less than a year. Total surprise as I just bought for the dividend. Sweet.
have to be Steven Hawking to understand the earnings of PRU. insurance companies have the most complicated financials of them all.
Was there something in the call that was negative? I don’t get why this is down almost 4%
"Howdy all. Note PRU up $2.37 today, times 417.71 shares = nearly a billion dollars increasein PRU value today. Not because of some financial deal but due to a Goldman buy recommendation.Isn't it ironic that word of mouth is more important than actual financial dealings. Also works on thenegative side as well. Since the stock market can be influenced by word of mouth rather than on actual dealings of a company, it is in my opinion a big hoax and you had better be able todecifer what is coming out verbally by various brokers vs what is real."
"There is something terribly amiss here. This stock is solid. Making a nice profit, buying back stock and paying anice dividend. What in the world would cause this stock to drop from aprox 125 to 94. roughly 25 Pct. I'm nota professional money man (maybe thats the problem) and can't see anything this company is doing to merita drop of 25 or so percent. Something fishy."
"With a discounted future cash flow of $ 142./ sh. & a current share price of $ 93., & low debt this is a deep discount of 35% to FMV. With abroad portfolio of prop. & casualty, Life & Health & disability with regulated product pricing by state insurance commissioners, there is no financial or product explanation for the deeply discounted stock price.Greg C. Esq."
Anyone on the call? The stock is all over the place
"Bought at 62.50 after the crash last year and got out at 97.75. A nice gain in just over a year. That panic took the good companies down with the bad, not hoping for another crash but this is one stock I'll gladly jump back into if we get a correction."
I'm buying under 80.betting on it goes back to 100
headed to 75
"why are all the messages i look at so old, nothing new in recent days"
"Lesson learned, always buy tons under 100"
Buyer- any time dips below $99
It looks like they took a big charge after they marked down future interest earnings and lowered their rate projections. Apparently even after this quarter charge they still assume 3%+ future rate on 10 year treasure LT..........ouch... IMHO keeping fingers crossed they can underwrite and price better.
They killed it book value 163. When you compare the metrics against MET it really should be trading at 163!!
All the financials are up today but I like price action going into tonight’s report.
Incredible earnings!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not sure what to make of it.Down 5 yesterday up 3 today and nothing changed.Was thinking to add at 63 this morning after listening to the uninspiring CC webcast last evening.Not complaining though. I'm good with the shares I got at 58 last summer. For me it's a dividend play with opportunity for above average growth.
"Despite operating in a low interest rates environment, PRU has managed to grow earnings by more than 11% annually for the past five years, from $6.70 EPS in 2012 to $11.31 EPS in 2017. 2018 can only be better."
Why no reaction after stellar earnings?
"They have a significant Japan presence. With Covid 19, concern may be that the increase mortality rate from the virus could negatively impact their life insurance profitability."
Why PRU forward P/E 7 so cheap and it is still under book value with interest spread is rising? Wierd. The income is stable and predictable with expanding wealth management in Asia
I had seen a few people expressing concern with the dividend not being declared in the ER call yesterday. The CEO seemed to make a commitment to covering the dividend but I dug a bit deeper.I looked at past history and transcripts. It seems the Q4 ER call (in early February each year) corresponds with a dividend declare date but the declare date is usually 1-2 weeks after Q1-Q3 ER calls. Based on history I am guessing it will be next Tuesday 5/12.
"I love this company stock, great deal!"
"Listen up.....I used to own some PRU but don't any more. The TRUTH is this. This is a safe dividend stock but that is it. All you have to do is pull up a 5 year chart for the stock. It's trading very close to where it was 5 years ago. The dividend is great but if you are looking for TOTAL shareholder return, PRU is not a good stock. When it gets cheap (in teh $70's) it's a good trade in the $90's it's just a value trap of 4% yield. Better than cash but certainly not a good ""total return"" stock."
All life insurance companies got pounded again today 8-10%. This is absurd. I know the virus is deadly but from what I can tell it kills the most in the 70+ age range. How many 70 yr olds do you know that carry life insurance? The odds that this affects PRU to that degree are silly. The biggest risk is we go into a severe recession and people stop paying premiums. Sure that hurts cash flow but also lessens risk exposure. This company is an extreme buy at these levels.
"When the insiders start buying, that will be the signal to start accumulating."
I know the news on interest rate inversion is hammering stocks this morning but I think PRU is heading for new 52 week low. 
Earnings look to be very good. If guidance is equally as optimistic we could see a dividend increase and additional stock buy back. Glad I have a piece of the rock!
"Nice jump at the open today. Up $4.41 or 5.7%. No news, except for the win of the Georgia Senate Dems. Maybe investors are encouraged by the demise of the Deceiver-In-Chief. But the Dems will have their own big challenges, especially if they (with the Republicans) keep running up the national debt over COVID. A couple of years from now, we could see inflation soar. Even divvies of 5% could be dwarfed by inflation at 6 or 7 %. -Scott"
JPM keeps PRU at Overweight Rating.Price target reduced to 91 dollars from 93 dollars.
What are you current thoughts on PRU? I just started a small position and overall I was intrigued by the dividend and I needed exposure to insurance industry
"Not complaining, but why?"
"Everybody has different goals but for me 5.5% yield with future increasing payouts is too good to ignore. PRU is hedged and reinsured and will survive any short term stress whether interest rates or economic slowdown. Definitely not a high growth, capital gain stock although at this price there is even a bit of recovery gain to be had eventually too imo."
Well PRU has been a very pleasant surprise. I came in at $61 as an dividend income play. The capital gain has been pretty stunning and I haven't even collected my first dividend yet.
"7 times PE with 14% Return on Equity , too cheap indeed"
When is dividend?
"I wouldn't be surprised to see the sp500 take a breather at this point and fall another 300 or 420 points from here over the next few trading days. however, PRU is a good place to be over the short term and long term. I refuse to sell at this point so close to exdiv."
Pending a fairly good earnings report I’m buying more this is one of my favorite long dividend stocks
The world is not ending and strong companies adapt. People will need life insurance as well as other financial products and a company like PRU may get bruised but will survive and thrive in the future. Buying below $50 give a current high dividend and a lot of upside. If they happen to cut the dividend believe me they will have it back to these levels as soon as things level out. A fairly safe bet in these markets IMO
"Prudential tops Q4 earnings and revenue estimates, improves its cash from operations and it raises dividends. Great report and outlook. I am expecting the stock to be back over $100."
target short term down to 63 Buy there
"I am thinking of converting an annuity I have with Vanguard to Prudential. I have my pension in an prudential annuity from my previous employer, and I am very happy with the way Pru is managing it. Anyone has opinion whether converting my Vanguard annuity to pru is a good idea?"
do anyone know when we will receive JXN shares?
We are doing good here. Collect healthy dividends from strong company
Stephanie Link said today on Halftime Report that she took a position in PRU. Called it cheap. Likes the dividend and planned buy back
Took a small position. The dividend should double again imho in 7yrs.
Why is everyone convinced of dividend hike next quarter?
Very likely $100 by June and a possible $125- $130 for new highs this year.
A 5/1 PE ratio #$%$ even if this stock doubled to 200 its pe ratio would be less than 99% of stocks out there. This stock is so under valued its not funny
Great week for PRU shareholders who bought back at $45.Better days ahead with more jobs & the flu going away!!!!
I don't think the earnings are sustainable.
What was that at 1:45pm..... a squeeze? Whatever it was congrats to everyone who has taken a once in a generation move and stayed the coarse without selling over the past yr.

"the market is no longer afraid of negative rates, instead spreads have really moved nicely with the 10 yr t billbreaking out, Jamie diamond signaled the economy is surprising to the upside, the sp500 found support at 3090, PRU has room to run to $79... however by the 3rd week of June the market might start paying attention to how the ppp loans are impacting the economy."
$120s. Here we come….
"It's a mystery why this isnt higher. They keep beating earnings by a lot, they are generating a ton of cash, and every year they increase the dividend. When interest rates go higher they should make more money. I wouldnt be surprised if someone tries to buyout the company it's so cheap."
who got their dividend thumbs up
"Home run on EPS this quarter. 6.98 versus Street estimate of 2.75Ignore the negative short term trade, as usual.Analysts will raise PT's."
Yields increasing. Operations solid. Limited to no exposure to recent hurricanes. No reason for PRU to be below $110. Market recovers but PRU does not??? What am I missing? Somebody please explain. This one is does not make sense.
this stock pays dividend? this stock will go 200$? what ur opinion
buy buy
"Loaded up both my own and wife's retirement accounts, as a longer term investment with PRU at about 42 Sp, in this downturn.This is a pure gift, IMO at all these crazy low levels below 70.The management team, fundamentals and dividend of this company are all terrific.When the market's sanity returns, PRU will be over 100 dollars.Cheers to all longs."
Morgan Stanley raises the PT on PRU to 76 dollars from 74 dollars.
Average cost at 70 and I’m actually really happy with that...
The biggest issue is not death payments but investment return in a low interest environment. Stop panicking.
PRU is way undervalued and earnings guidance is positive. Why is this thing stuck below $115 when it should be closer to $125+?
