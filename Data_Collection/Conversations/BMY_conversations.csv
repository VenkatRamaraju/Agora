Good news and BMY down why ? Please some one why ?
I've stopped trying to understand reactions after earnings. It often seems completely random...
Share price manipulation. Orchestrated event.
"Bloomberg News is now reporting that BMY will tender all of its shares of Acceleron in the Merck acquisition. The tender offer price is $180, and BMY owns 11.5% of XLRN. BMY will receive $1.3 BILLION plus it retains rights to XLRN's top drugs including REBLOZYL and Sotatercept which could be a blockbluster medication."
CFRA lowered price target from $72 to $60. Downgrades to neutral to buy. Concerned about the pipeline ability to offset main drugs going off patent.
"Partnerships in place with $mrk $bmy $roche - strongest cash position ever in co history, Nps licensing imminent - share price will be doubling Tripling or Quadrupling in less than 90 days. T Cell Activation Combined with Checkpoint Inhibitors for Ovarian and Mesothelioma End Stage Patients, results set to exceed BAT."
I've been in and out of Bristol for over 25 years and it was always talked about the same thing. Being bought out or teaming up with a larger company. Fast forward 25 years and it's the same talk. Don't know why anyone would waste their time on this.
I’m thinking of going all in here. I figure 3k shares at this price and set a sell at 66 is 30k. That is the lowest analyst estimate. This is not a bad company and I do not understand why it has gone down so much but it can also be looked at as a gift at this price. I’m not sure but I think it will get back to mid 60’s at some point
Thought earnings were good and guidance. Don't understand price
Is it just me or does the majority of the BMY stockholders feel we need a management change? I have a lot invested in this business and I’m down approximately 15%. The rest of my Pharmaceutcal investments are up 30%+.
I wonder if the market will ever appreciate this stock? They are so much cheaper than other big pharma with a really good dividend and lots of cash. I keep pumping money into it and it keeps loosing. Thinking if I stay long enough it may turn around
"So mrk made less per share than bmy, less guidance for the year and is up 2%. Makes sense"
"Nps Licensing 30 days, 4, Billion dollar Catalysts in the next 69 days $BMY $MRK $roche End Stage Ovarian Cancer and Mesothelioma Combination readouts - First time results will show Patients Surviving Beyond best available treatments. Intl Headlines> IMO + AML Phase 3 Fda review just +/- 5.5 months 1,000% -2,500% Gains coming for this Baby Bio. Be holding every bag you can carry.LMk if you have any questions."
"Not buying bmy at this point is insanity. Look at rsi. Look at history. Look at the future. The company is fine, the dividend is good, the growth prospects are more than decent."
"Bristol Myers interested in buying Aurinia, aothet 4-6 billion hole again?"
Is there news today that caused this to be down? Looks like several pharma companies are down today. What gives?
"There are several FALSE comments below about remlivid patent protection. The drug will have patent protection in the USA until 2026. Next year, there will be only a very limited generic production. The impact is being vastly overstated by the market."
"Saw this important comment regarding share repurchase from the CEO in the earnings conference call: ""We have an existing authorization for another 3 billion this year. And obviously, we'll continue to look at that as well."""
What’s aggravating is seeing abbvie barely beat estimates but go up over 2% where Bmy beats estimates and goes down over 3%. I apparently picked the wrong one to invest in.
Did we hit a 16 month low with record earnings?
"something must be wrong with my stock quotes today, it shows BMY green and outperforming a positive market today."
BMY needs to up dividend and become a utility.
General for almost all of my stocks: the better the earnings the more they fall
"The market going through the roof and BMY struggling to get back to 58, much less back to 68."
Top and bottom line beats and increased guidance on estimates in place when this was trading at $69 and progress on many new pipeline drugs. Excellent report.
"After 2 1/2 months of almost relentless selling, BMY share price is down 19% from Aug. high. Now that earnings have been released, I believe selling is almost over, and shares will rebound (barring a major mkt selloff). The share price held above $56 today which is important. As the CEO noted today, BMY has $3 BILLION available for share repurchase. Hope they start tomorrow."
"I predicted BMY had reached bottom two days ago -- based on earnings release, collapse of Medicare drug pricing changes and 2.5 months of relentless selling. Also, remlivid is under US patent protection until 2026 -- not 2022 as is falsely reported on this board."
"See below for a major reason why pharma stocks are UP today. The proposal issued by Bide WH today includes ZERO changes to Medicare drug coverage: ""That the White House has instead, for now, fully dropped drug pricing from the bill is a testament to the power of the pharmaceutical industry, which has for months poured millions into lobbying and advertising to kill the effort."""
"BMY 5 year trend = 16%, while S&P 500 did 108%. Not including dividends of course. Incredible."
"Tip ranks survey of 8 analysts over the past 3 months has moved consensus from a moderate buy to a strong buy. Average price target is $75.57 with a high of $85.00, and a low of $68.00.. even at the low, that is greater than a 20% upside with a 5% yield, so greater than 25% total return. Not too shabby a potential performance."
"One thing good about Elon Musk, he stands up and supports his share holders. Better than BMY's management. Market makers must have told management to remain quiet."
"if it was good to buy at $60, then it is better at $56 with solid earnings report."
Lowest analyst price target is 66 and highest 85.
BMY fair value is $42.34. The stock has lost its growth momentum.
"BMS is repeating Celgene’s saga! The more Revlimid sells, the lower the stock price goes! Soon BMS will be bought up!"
BMY: we had great earnings and increase guidancemr market: meh who cares?
This stock is less than it was 20 years ago?
"YadaYadaYada:Bristol Myers Squibb EPS beats by $0.08, beats on revenue, boost guidance"
Wake up Giovanni Caforio. Time to step up to the plate.
"Is this stock allergic to green? Going to buy at some point, but it looks bottomless no matter what it does…"
