This stock is less than it was 20 years ago?
"Bad report, drop, good report, drop."
All my gains in Merck are going down the drain with BMY
"Another article about the cheapest big pharma and it’s a screaming buy! Well, who is buying? Need some positive news"
Just buy!
Been way over sold for a month. Worst chart i have seen for a long. long time.
"Tip ranks survey of 8 analysts over the past 3 months has moved consensus from a moderate buy to a strong buy. Average price target is $75.57 with a high of $85.00, and a low of $68.00.. even at the low, that is greater than a 20% upside with a 5% yield, so greater than 25% total return. Not too shabby a potential performance."
"Saw this important comment regarding share repurchase from the CEO in the earnings conference call: ""We have an existing authorization for another 3 billion this year. And obviously, we'll continue to look at that as well."""
"if it was good to buy at $60, then it is better at $56 with solid earnings report."
management change ?
the fact that this stock underperformed so badly leading up to today is very highly suspicious that there are people with insider information dumping before the released news. These people need to be in prison
Share price manipulation. Orchestrated event.

"BMS is repeating Celgene’s saga! The more Revlimid sells, the lower the stock price goes! Soon BMS will be bought up!"
IThere should not be 3 billion for repurchase. If the management had any confidence or understanding of market technicals and momentum they would of repurchased shares and increased the buybacks. This company needs a leader not a bunch of promises. They should stop punting for next year.
"Suppose that the volume limited generic competition agreements, which start in March 2022 and goes completely off patent in 2026, allows for 25% increments over the 4 years (just a hypothetical). So 25% year one, 50% year 2, 75% year 3 and then unlimited. Usually the total efect is 90%, but just have it go to zero.In the first half of 2021 the revenue growth of the highlighted non-Revlimid drugs was about 13%. 15.651 billion in 2021 first half versus $13.835 in the first half of 2020. Now, 1st half of 2020 was impacted by Covid, so easier comps somewhat.Maybe non-Revlimid can grow at a 10% rate. If revenue projection is 46,490 for this year, and you lose 25% of Revlimid in 2022, that is, just rounding, $12 billion down to $9 billion, leaving 37,490,000. The non-Revlimid this year would be $34,490 (again, just rounding, revlimid should be higher), and that grows 10%, that's $3,449, giving you $46,939.00 next year. That beats the lowest estimate of $46.49 but shy of the average of $48.23.Given that Mavacamten should come on line and you are early stages with Breyanzi, Onureg, Abecma and Zeposia, Eloquis still doing well, Optivo, Yervoy, etc., well, it seems like BMY has a diverse line-up that should be able to cover Revlimid disappearing over the next 4 years.Yes, overall growth may seem slow or reversal, but should return over time. In fact it could surprise to the upside. This patent cliff has been a known commodity for some time. BMY should be able to handle it. If it does miss, that's really well more than priced in at this point, I'd say. Inability to pay debt and dividends doesn't seem at all in the cards. BMY's bonds are not trading or rated like there's any hint of a default risk.BMY's management has been caught out in the past, so there's always that risk, the known contingent right risk, regulatory risk, etc. What equity is risk free? It had to deal with Plavix losing protection. It's gone through this issue before with expiry just like all pharmas must. Yes, debt is high but should remain serviceable. Not a pump. Sell if you must. It doesn't seem like it is about to takeoff so if you expect a quick return, may not be there. Maybe it trades back up in the channel it's been in. And may take a bit for growth to return (and then you go through the whole ""need to deal with expiries and build the pipeline"" all over again.But this sell-off seems pretty extreme at this point. Do your own DD."
"What is the predection to November, December and 2022?"
"So mrk made less per share than bmy, less guidance for the year and is up 2%. Makes sense"
Let’s see if it will actually hold a gain
My question is why does the ceo or anyone else in the company not come out and say something. Maybe a vote of confidence would be nice to hear.
I’ve owned this thing for a while. I don’t think I remember it ever having a 4-5 percent up day. Seems impossible but true
So we have people shorting this stock now? How does it go from a 52 week high to a 52 week low in 2 months with little news? Wth
Market needs up tick reinstated.
"If MRK takes out Acceleron instead of BMY, Bristol will net almost $900M. Bristol owns 7million shares of XLRN at around $40…"

Was able to add some more shares at 56.30. Very happy with that price. :-)
i bought 58 but I am happy. i think in the future this will very best share
Weekly option expiration and a few shorts getting squeezed. Nice to see.
"Dow Jones just published a news story which says that BMY did not bid for Acceleron. Instead, BMY proposed the following. Can anyone explain exactly what this means? Thanks. ""Bristol proposed full forgiveness of future royalties owed to each company, along with a balancing cash payment."""
"So how is this so down? Beat earnings, just read the transcript and all seems positive. 3 billion left to repurchase shares? I just don’t understand. I see nothing but positive. Lly misses earnings and goes up?"
"After 2 1/2 months of almost relentless selling, BMY share price is down 19% from Aug. high. Now that earnings have been released, I believe selling is almost over, and shares will rebound (barring a major mkt selloff). The share price held above $56 today which is important. As the CEO noted today, BMY has $3 BILLION available for share repurchase. Hope they start tomorrow."
Back to $65 + within 2 weeks
"Reported today XLRN is in advanced talks for an $11B takeout…BMY is rumored to be in the mix. The slide of BMY beginning Aug 20 coincides with the rise in XLRN beginning Aug 19…Not sure if good or bad for BMY, just reporting what is out there…"
BMY should put itself up for sale. C’mon PFE buy this dog out and save me the heartache of seeing my investment in this company go down on a daily basis.
Market seems to like the idea of the aquisition
Oversold. RSI 26 looks like its starting to bottom. Brutal fall from 67!!
"Hmm, posted link but disappeared. Abraxane shortage. Manufacturing delays, issue first at Illinois contractor then at company owned in Phoenix. This on top of FDA rejection of attempt to delay generics in July. And the China contract notice, which appears related to China halt due to Illinois issue. None of this reported under Yahoo news for BMY. Hmmmm. Do your own DD. Not a long term issue (other than never a good reflection to have manufacturing issues), and doesn't change a long term thesis, but short term perhaps another reason for the recent weak performance. Perhaps a miss and morning washout can start a rebound (maybe one has already started), but one never knows with the market. Good luck."
Shorts in control of this mega cap
"Analyst actions in pharma today. Barclays raises Merck, $87 to $92, but lowers BMY $71 to $68."
Just wait for Nancy Pelosi and her husband to buy in here at the end of the year. That’s the signal to buy. Insider info at its finest
Great buy today. Nice call volume today in November that captures investor day!!! Plus next earnings call. Nice dividend. Good future earnings estimates. This is a buy here at a low..
Very low volume today. Maybe the sellers are getting tired
"mkt is 52 wk high, bmy 52 wk low, ?"
"I predicted BMY had reached bottom two days ago -- based on earnings release, collapse of Medicare drug pricing changes and 2.5 months of relentless selling. Also, remlivid is under US patent protection until 2026 -- not 2022 as is falsely reported on this board."
"You buy stocks when they are on sale. BMY trades in a range between $60 & $70 give or take. I’ve been buying under $60 and will sell after it returns to mid to upper $60’s. Wash, rinse and repeat."
"Bloomberg News is now reporting that BMY will tender all of its shares of Acceleron in the Merck acquisition. The tender offer price is $180, and BMY owns 11.5% of XLRN. BMY will receive $1.3 BILLION plus it retains rights to XLRN's top drugs including REBLOZYL and Sotatercept which could be a blockbluster medication."
"Is there any chance JNJ would ever buy BMY? Not sure that PFE or MRK are big enough to gobble up BMY.Although, if BMY continues its downtrend....and the market cap erodes......hmmmmm."
so is BMY going to buyout Aurina ? l hear the rumors but l have heard them before .
I've stopped trying to understand reactions after earnings. It often seems completely random...
Today's gain is the biggest % move for BMY in months. I think a bottom was put in place on Wed. Stock could move back to low $60s.
"if future EPS get cut in half, this would become fairly valued. We all know about the patent expirations but operating cash flow right now is $12B per year.btw, did they raise the dividend yet? I expect a 4 cent raise from .49 to .53 per share8% raise and a buyback."
A PE of 7.7X FY 2021 earnings is simply insane...
Time to start a position if you don’t own. This is a solid opportunity with a company at a 12 month low.
"At some point I will have to pity buy this, maybe at $48. It has to go up one day, lol."
"The market going through the roof and BMY struggling to get back to 58, much less back to 68."
I’m thinking of going all in here. I figure 3k shares at this price and set a sell at 66 is 30k. That is the lowest analyst estimate. This is not a bad company and I do not understand why it has gone down so much but it can also be looked at as a gift at this price. I’m not sure but I think it will get back to mid 60’s at some point
Just wonder if the bmy major market player told management they were going to run the share price down and remain quiet.
Just about 52 week low with record earnings. Beat by .04 cents.
"after nov 3 will bounce back to 60, but it may continue to go down till next june 2022 when loss of Revlimidaffect to bottom line. that support will be 43"
Big Pharma cant and won't get a break with this admin. Look at PFE. They are supposedly saving the world and their stock has had basically no gains..
Good news and BMY down why ? Please some one why ?

Looks as if some shorties have thier ask in a sling.
"It's not just $TDOC, have people looked at other growth stocks? Almost all of them (the 20x+ sales types) have been crushed. $PINS, $ZM, $ROKU, $FVRR, . . .Down 30% or more. Has to do with:1.) massive overvaluations2.) stay-at-home trades getting re-rated3.) rising 10-year Treasury (which crushes high multiple stocks)4.) inflation rising and sticking5.) gridlock on infrastructure/stimulus (in which this possible tax hikes on the rich)With regard to possible persistent higher inflation, the argument is that growth stocks do worse, because their earnings are far into the future. If inflation is persistent and higher in the future, then the value of those earnings could be a lot less (unless they have pricing power to raise prices). Value stocks, by contrast, have their earnings more in the here and now. Take $BMY trading at a 9 P/E vs $ZM trading at an 80 P/E. $ZM's valuation takes the bigger hit, because it's earnings will be worth much less (it is argued) from future persistent inflation. You also had end-of-quarter ""window dressing"" and ""mark ups"" by fund managers, who want to hide their losses and pretend they held the winners this quarter all along, which led to some late-September selling. In short, LOTS of growth stocks took a hit this quarter. $TDOC is not alone (despite my not liking the company for other reasons - have you seen the scandals/criticisms on its Wikipedia page?)."
SEC needs to wake up. Manipulation the hello out of BMY.
BMY needs to up dividend and become a utility.
how big of a dividend raise do you guys think we'll get?

I've been in and out of Bristol for over 25 years and it was always talked about the same thing. Being bought out or teaming up with a larger company. Fast forward 25 years and it's the same talk. Don't know why anyone would waste their time on this.

Did we hit a 16 month low with record earnings?
Executive management should stand tall and proud.
"After March 2022, when patents on Revlimid are set to expire, the Indian drugmaker will be allowed to manufacture and sell Eliquis could lose U.S. exclusivity after 2026. Opdivo's patents also begin to expire later this decade"
BMY fair value is $42.34. The stock has lost its growth momentum.
Perhaps we are starting to see a change? 2 good days in a row now it appears. At some point money will go back into the value stocks when the growth stocks get to far out there. Would be great to get to the 60s soon
Just know this stock will never go above $70. Just look at the past 5 years.
Is there any way someone can buy BMY out. This is the only way us suffering shareholders can maybe make some type of money for holding for the last decade. This company is just a dog with fleas. All I can say is wow!!!
"Bristol Myers BMY recently announced that the mid-stage study investigating pipeline candidate deucravacitinib for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) has failed.The phase II LATTICE-UC study is evaluating deucravacitinib, a first-in-class, oral, selective tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor compared to placebo in UC patients. The primary endpoint of the trial is clinical remission (using the modified Mayo score) at week 12. Secondary endpoints include a clinical response (using the modified Mayo score), endoscopic response, and histological improvement at week 12.The study did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint of clinical remission at week 12, nor secondary efficacy endpoints."
General for almost all of my stocks: the better the earnings the more they fall
I say we fire Caforio and the entire board. They have been a travesty to the wealth of long-term shareholders like myself and so many others. I for sure thought with the acquisition of CELG this would have been a rock solid investment for the next decade. Boy was I wrong!
Is it just me or does the majority of the BMY stockholders feel we need a management change? I have a lot invested in this business and I’m down approximately 15%. The rest of my Pharmaceutcal investments are up 30%+.
I wonder if the market will ever appreciate this stock? They are so much cheaper than other big pharma with a really good dividend and lots of cash. I keep pumping money into it and it keeps loosing. Thinking if I stay long enough it may turn around

This dog won’t hunt until 2023. Waiting on all this option volume from late October that Justin mentioned would get us to $65?
Cannot believe my eyes that this stock is up today. Been quite a roller coaster ride with BMY. I am hoping this ship turns around because it’s a winner in my opinion. One of the best pharma companies but it’s stock price doesn’t reflect it.
"FYI- Regarding the MRK/XLRN deal, on top of the cap gains BMY will receive from their +10% stake in XLRN, BMY will also receive a 20% royalty from all global sales of Sotatercept…BMY below 60 is a gift…BMY is frustratingly in a channel below $70, but if you want extra yield it is a covered call gold mine, just like GILD…"
Top and bottom line beats and increased guidance on estimates in place when this was trading at $69 and progress on many new pipeline drugs. Excellent report.
Short and cover over and over. I am buying. ;)
Something’s up………….Giovanni might be on his way out………….How could you defend him with the price action…..
i really wish i could see some bad news for BMY. 56 makes no sense after that ER. Heck 60 would be cheap by any metric.

Down everyday no matter earnings
Don't these bmy dudes own some of that company Merck just bought? I would think that's a bonus. A gain on investment. Should be positive to bottom line.
Can someone please explain why this is going down on good news...?
"tested 56.1 and hold, great news"
"I would like to mention the issue of buyouts again.How likely (%) is it that Garo has already made a buyout deal with $BMY ?Should $BMY have submitted a decent offer to agenus management, then Agenus should calculate it exactly whether it makes sense to independently rebuild all sales channels for your medication or to accept a buyout?A company has to enter into deals when they realize that going it alone in this pharmaceutical industry is a tough act or rather more relaxed in a sidecar with driving without having to provide all the requirements of the driver and the towing vehicle."

"There are several FALSE comments below about remlivid patent protection. The drug will have patent protection in the USA until 2026. Next year, there will be only a very limited generic production. The impact is being vastly overstated by the market."
Is there news today that caused this to be down? Looks like several pharma companies are down today. What gives?
Going buy AUPH. Stock worth owning now
"I’ve been holding this stock since CELG. Love the dividend, but can’t understand why it seems every major trading house highly recommends it with big old target prices, yet it languishes between $60 and $67.

"WHY the massive selling of BMY stock by BMY Insiders....and virtually NO buying...NONE, NADA??"
Well a nice beat and it’s up 1 penny. Other stocks get a beat and go up 2-3 percent. Amazing
CFRA lowered price target from $72 to $60. Downgrades to neutral to buy. Concerned about the pipeline ability to offset main drugs going off patent.
What’s aggravating is seeing abbvie barely beat estimates but go up over 2% where Bmy beats estimates and goes down over 3%. I apparently picked the wrong one to invest in.

"Pfizer CEO is on the page. The USA needs universal drug coverage in some ""form"". The USA should bargain for ""most favored nation status"" from drug companies on drug pricing since we are the biggest market. The USA should pay no more than 10% above the cost to any 1st world country for a drug. This method will give leverage to the companies to demand higher prices in the rich countries because the USA is no longer subsidizing them and footing the bill. The USA and the drug companies can benefit from this approach. More attention should be given to PFE and MRK for their covid vaccine pricing. If the vaccine had been in the hands of one company they could have priced the shots 10-20 fold higher. Pfizer left billions on the table and there are no media thank yous. The moats in the Pharm industry may look large but they not showing up in the bottom lines."
