"Ended March with $2.2B in cash, during MID-CRISIS end of April cash position went UP. AZUL will STILL be sitting on a mountain of cash at the end of Q2 with their LOW burn rate. Investors are NUTS for bailing now. Anything in the $6-$7 range is a STEAL with this one. Load up and expect aa 250% return by year end."
Tomorrow opening @20$ 
New to the market. Bought Azul about a week ago. Asking for advice please. Should I hold or sell at $20?? I appreciate everyone’s opinion. Thank you
Anyone know why this is showing way down?
"Cases going up cos they testing more ,the same happens in USThat was a plan ,let people out but put more testing insteadSo number of new CASES going up but less likely DEATHS which becomes stabilizeWe will se tomorrow on worldometerTheir last DEATHS chart was updated yesterday by independent organizations counting deathswhich has been hidden in the past by goverment.Thats why it shows more than usual numbers and it can be like that for rest of this week."
"Something big happening next week. Check options interest for 6/19, $17.5 call. Very high volume/interest, plus lots of buying (500+) towards Friday EOD. Blackrock is also their biggest investor. Something is coming."
"I told you so,buy more, thinks in Brasil are improving ,azul is going higher!in decmber starts summer vacation (last 3mths)covid cases are coming down,Azul finances improving,best airline, big country,economy better,dollar will devalue,what are you waiting for,BUY to make good profit has I am doing."
If AZUL buys LATAM it is a wrap!!! Tomorrow I hit one year anniversary of holding. Lets go longs this could be big for us!!
The smoke is starting to clear on the pandemic. Time for AZUL to FLY! 
I been waiting to long for a good exit. not gonna sell lower than I got in 4 sure. been waiting a long time. low 11 is a good entry. but its gonna be a long time waiting for profit.
so under valued its aamzing
"Becareful J. I'm an American living in Brazil. This company just hired the same law firm that Avianca holding did to help them file for chapter 11. You might night speak Portuguese, but here it is in the Brazilian newspaper. Use Google translater if you need to. Be careful, because if they do file for bankruptcy, all your money is gone bro. Good luck.https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/amp/mercado/2020/06/azul-contrata-escritorio-que-assessorou-avianca-brasil-na-recuperacao-judicial.shtml?__twitter_impression=true"
traffic up123% in september y/y over.Flights to USA start nxt month from Brasil.
"Azul Reports November 2020 Traffic. On track to emerges as the winner in the airline industry:“In November we recovered 85% of our domestic demand, which is one of the fastest rates in the world. Weexpect this trend to continue as we progressively ramp up our operations. We will fly to 113 destinations by theend of 2020 as our fleet flexibility and unique network structure enable us to accurately match capacity withdemand”, said John Rodgerson, Azul’s CEO."
I picked up a couple more shares today as well. Five shares for $100.
"bought more today,virus (covid) going down in Brazil has better immunity to the virus (herd) much better then vaxx.that is my opinion,everything is open,and traveling season will increase by september going forward,it's taking off,up and up...."
a travel stock during pandemic. chance to grab as much as you can.
"Load up in AZUL, covid -19 is slowing down in Brasil ,summer is aroud the corner ,Economy will improve ,dollar stable or weaker.People are not as concerns about the virus,vaccine around the corner,more air traveling is coming.All on board?"
"Everybody in Brasil is out and about minding their own business, except they are using masks and trying to keep their distances, they will fly and Azul will go up."
1 month around $26 share
"Being the best airline in South America and #1inBrasil,pop.220 million ppl country bigger then continental US in square miles,is just a matter of time before Azul start flying""$"" high again,there is no better way to go from point ""A-to-B""except by plane."
This is on the way up and will begin improving as Covid starts to fade away.
I picked up another 5K shares
"This is sooo oversold, when this thing turns ... to the Moon baby!!"
"Just want to let u guys knows there's a possibility of a merger between Azul and Latam, this was in Brazilian news, not official, but speculative news. I bought some shares on this news."
"I bet the farm on this one in March and more than doubled up in June. Since then, I've taken advantage of the volatility as its bounced between $11 and $16. Sitting at $13.17 now ... time to load up again. No reason this stock should be trading below $14."

"Time to buy.. The company is in good shape financially and soon will be back fully operational. Whats happening in Brazil is an economical issue because the Economic Minister is trying to approve some stimulus and the other side opposes it, saying it will exceed the spending limit and will create more debts with no way to pay it. Among others things..."

"Full recovery in 2021:Azul Reports December 2021 Traffic São Paulo, February 8, 2021 – Azul S.A., “Azul”, (B3: AZUL4, NYSE: AZUL), the largest airline in Brazil by number of cities served and flight departures, announces today its preliminary traffic results for January 2021. Domestic passenger traffic (RPKs) increased 13.2% compared to January 2019 on a domestic capacity increase (ASKs) of 17.6%, resulting in a load factor of 79.3%.“We began the year on a very positive note as one of the few airlines in the world, if not the only, with domestic recovery already above 2019. We continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and the positive benefit from the vaccine rollout closely, and remain confident in a full recovery during 2021”, said John Rodgerson, Azul’s CEO."
"Great quality airline and excellent management ! I bought early and ready to buy more, before it gets to the $30's."

Anyone know what time earnings figures are being released?
"Brazil opening up ,economy improving though slowly but up,big country!you have to fly to go from point A to B,summer vacations star in december.Imay buy more shares if it comes down to 14$."
$44 stock pre-covid one of the premier airlines in S.A. and the top choice. Great balance sheet. $44 to $11....this is bouncing to $20 soon.
$AZUL seems like fuel prices related swoon. Gol is down 20% too. CPA not so much. Seems to be levelling off.
Azul is a major airline for brazil and they have the ability to shut down completely since they don't have union. so they can reduce their cash burn to essentially minimum. This stock is undervalued and I bought 2500 shares at 6.60. I hope everyone understood how this works. stop listening to the news and don't let the hedge funds get ahead of you
"I think I’m bad luck, ever since I bought it @28, the strike begins and it started to drop.....low .....low.....and even lower. "
"Azul and LATAM today announce an agreement to connect routes in their domestic networks in Brazil. We will also have a partnership for loyalty programs, where TudoAzul members and LATAM Pass members can accumulate points in the program of their choice. Initially there will be 50 domestic routes to/from: Brasília (BSB), Belo Horizonte (CNF), Recife (REC), Porto Alegre (POA), Campinas (VCP), Curitiba (CWB) and São Paulo - Guarulhos (GRU), offering customers several options of new and more convenient connections in Brazil. They will also enable a smoother travel experience between Azul and LATAM flights, with shared tickets for check-in and baggage dispatch. Tickets will go on sale in the coming months."
"i dont know who is investing and where they get their info from, but based on traffic and not bad economic outlook in brazil, both azul and gol are heavily underpriced. 400 flights from 900 before are intitated for september and theyre at around 25% atm. including cargo and cost savings, its unclear to me how the price is only at around 1/4th of the high at around >40$. US airlines are at 1/3 and 1/2 of the price already..."
"What I don’t get is that the executives on the call stated that AZUL is number one in various areas of the airline business. The numbers look good and not that bad. They only burning like $500k a day, and pax loads where up year to year. So what I am I missing that I can figure out why this stock is not at $12 right now???? This stock at $5.70 is a steal, correct?????"
Investing in emerging markets is risky. Investing in a country with a crazy president is risky. Investing in airlines is risky. Investing any any business that's 90% closed due to the coronavirus is risky.I'm in.
What happened after hours? Are they going to file for bankruptcy?
"Totally not overbought. It will be $40 by the end of the year. It is just going through a phase all the other airlines are going through right now. (LUV is over bought, AAL is overbought, JBLU is overbought). AZUL's phase is more harsh then the others so it will rebound higher than the rest in a couple months."
Zack's had this as a Strong Buy a week ago and yesterday listed it as a Strong Sell??? Enlighten me!
Wheels up captain!
big support at 11.30! dont let the shorts win
azul will be $17 by the end of the day
"just fyi (2): if you want to sell azul based on the covid news, please note 1) brazil's infections are NOT rising, 2) brazil airlines' busiest season is starting now (summer time) so: stock up, not down."
Really……
Hold we will be fineeeee. Trust.
"here is my piece of advice.Buy AZUL,I bought today,this month of december there was 60% increase to of # daily flights as of comparison prior to covid! airlines had to bring extra planes out of parking to meet the demand from public for tickets.young are flying(-"
Holdddddddd. Ive been in since $8. Listen to me if you wanna pop champagne lol
"Brazil is opening up the economy almost all green, added up to my Azul position with 7k more shares"
"Use Google translater to see the link below. Company hired same law firm that Avainca did to file for chptr 11. Good luck. I love the company, but there are better investments.https://www.google.com/amp/s/www1.folha.uol.com.br/amp/mercado/2020/06/azul-contrata-escritorio-que-assessorou-avianca-brasil-na-recuperacao-judicial.shtml"
July Brazilian govt will offer R$2B for the airline companies. Stock will probably jump a little.
"Buy AZUL it's going up, air traffic is back to55% to previous covid,give another 6 months it will be easy 50% gain for the stock, just buy and hold"
Should I buy AZUL?
"This is getting manipulated so hard right now expect a huge squeeze to come, only good news has come out about this stock and the airline industry yet it has fallen regardless."
"Q3 earnings are out, better EPS of -0.68$ (-3.58R$), but lower revenue of 144mil$ (805milR$) compared to estimated -1.05$ and 170mil$."
Foreigners can now enter all airports in Brazil
"Just flew both Gol and Azul - (CNF-GRU) and both were 90% full. Azul was a much better experience from start (booking) to finish-(arrival) but Gol baggage handlers were quicker.Azul also has a nice code-share partnership with United and Azul doesn't have absurdly detailed carry-on baggage measurements like Gol.- From the customer perspective, I'd buy AZUL."
"Wow, the market cap on this getting decimated...like chump change for such an airline...amazing!And on no apparent particular news that anyone is commenting...how odd..."
"HI,citigroup just recommended to buy AZUL this AM,things should get better ,the,train is leaving the station, jump on board"
Wait for a better entry point. Have contacts indicating that pandemic is intense. Just pushing a bit a ahead of itself right now. More than likely b/c people experiencing some FOMO.
"next week comes the report of traffic volume for august,if that is positive the stock will move higher"
Any news out there on why AZUL is tanking?
This is going upSource: Trust me
"We have to be patient...it is all set up to skyrocket soon, Azul is surrounded of more and more good news each day but still not reflected yet in the stock....and more good news to come in the short term...be patient and do not hear shorters"
"Bought at $11 in June - should have gotten it at $5 in April, but still, happy with almost a double so far its coming into high season in Brazil for travel and their Covid is apparently waning. This stock would double again just to get back to normal high ranges. You could say the same for cruise stocks, which I also waded into when they sunk and have since risen like a high tide. Can't wait to cruise again and fly on Azul when we return to Brazil - our last experience with them in 2018 was simply amazing. When you fly in Brazil, you are reminded of the glory days in the USA when our airlines actually provided you a pleasant flight experience."
Does someone know why is this stock down more than the rest of the other airlines stock? What’s going on in Brazil?
I worry that the massive covid spike in Brazil is going to negatively impact this stock.
Only reason it came from 15 to 13 is I bought it at 15
"Citigroup analyst Stephen Trent reiterated Buy recommendations on several domestic and foreign airlines Wednesday, including Delta Air Lines (ticker: DAL), Spirit Airlines (SAVE), Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY), Azul (AZUL), and Copa Holdings (COPA).Here comes the BOOM"
"beginning 11/01/21 brazilians w vax.can travel to US, +for azul."
What are the chances Azul goes BK?
Loaded up the boat today. I set my sell order for 25 when it fills it fills
"Well, I bought today. Almost bought this back when it was in the 40s. Eyed it at around 5 and really thought about it. Got in today. Am I chasing a bit? Yes. But as long as this doesn’t go bankrupt, I thought I’d give it a shot since I don’t mind being long."
Down 12%?! Wow! For what?
What’s the prediction ladies and gents. What the target say two months from now ￼
Should I sell ? Now or wait
Azul longs where yall at!? Haha
Wow.
"Azul has laid off 1,000 employees. Clearly struggling.￼Source: https://www.reuters.com/article/azul-layoffs/brazilian-carrier-azul-has-laid-off-nearly-1000-employees-source-says-idUSL1N2EE03O"
The bear in me thinks if if breaks down thru $11 then there is no bottom i can see readily until around $9.5. I dont claim to be an expert but I feel like if that happens it could even visit $8 or lower. If GOL files BK this stock price could very well follow it down even tho it does not deserve it. The optimistic bullish side of me feel like this is near bottom. I'm on sideline watching for the right time to get back in
"Not going to go lower than it has since Nov 2020 when there wasn't a vaccine. The vaccine hype is yesterday. Look at the progression of the last few quarters, all are going up(Revenue, Profit, Income). $40 by December."
Question. What is the risk of this going bankrupt compared to the other airlines
"Suggested to buy GOL instead of AZUL 10 days ago. Stock is up 20% just this week. Still time to jump in. Forecast see GOL somewhere between 8 and 10 USD, thats 50% UP!"
It was a good quarter given the circumstances. This company will rock the second half of this year!
Time to by azul
what happened in Brazil today?Every Brazillian firm is down 10-15%?
I will never buy this company stocks. This is my own opinion.
"Great opportunity to get in, this stock will be to the roof when we see the market improve. It did prove itself last week when the market and the dow were doing good. The stock will not go to low low like as $7 or $8 so do not wait and lose the gain because these prices are will not gonna come again guaranteed!!."
Flying high soon
Lets go.baby 
Major opportunity to.buy
Today felt GOOD
I bought at 12$ should I buy more now?
"just fyi, stock price of azul at the brazilian stock exchange (azul4) has long reached more than half of prepandemic levels with valuations reaching above it (the most recent is at 3/5 of prepand. price). they arent as confused as US investors. its a pity those dont look."
"Just heard from my contact from Brasil that Azul will start flying back to Florida by the end of this month ,positive news."
HOLD
"Since May, LATAM has exited Argentina, partnered with rival Azul SA in Brazil and cut back domestic operations in Chile, while Avianca has departed Peru.LATAM is now open to a deeper alliance with Azul, even as the two airlines usually control a combined 60% of Brazil's domestic market.The scaling back could reshape air travel in Latin America, weakening competition regionally and driving up ticket prices while also helping some carriers survive. The moves show how the industry is already shrinking through attrition, as airlines are too cash-strapped to consider buying the competition."
This is going to slingshot it’s way back to $20 as soon as the tide turns
"Traffic numbers didn't look all that great for April, but you know what I like about 'em? Easy comp for next month and next year! This will double in a year.Isso aí cara!"
What is going onnnn :(
"AZUL the next SAVE , 20 this week , don’t sell guys"
Earnings will be Crazy! Azul have a lot of traffic!20$ Here we goooo
"Imagine, you are in the money with $900 per 100 share NEARLY 2 years out! for the ones who don't get it. Buying long term calls. It is almost like playing with house money.And they were going for as low as $650 per contract just a few days ago...And they are buying back shares!It is like taking candy from a baby. Blue baby!"
"Great management team. They've done a good job of conserving cash and restructuring their routes on a weekly basis in line with demand. They've also done better than most in restructuring their orders and pushing out their takedowns. Their position in the Brazilian market is hard to beat at this point. They control the NW Sao Paulo market with their domination of Campinhas airport. The BNDES bailout money is there as a backstop, but I'm not sure they will need it going into summer in the southern hemisphere. Stock is trading at a 50% discount to where it will be in 24 months, maybe sooner?"
"Wow, down 25% in 5 days. What happened?"
"Haven't been here to comment on AZUL in a long while if ever. I did buy AZUL in May for $20 and thought it was a good deal. I sold around the $27 mark a month later in June. I have been doing a lot of looking into this company recently because of the extremely low price for a major airline that made it thought the pandemic very well. I went to the AZUL website and looked through their financials for 2021, 2020 and 2019. I am reading a lot about the Brazilian economy and the Bancs need for input. I hear a little about stagnation as well. And I have read these comments here. I think AZUL is a great buy right now in the sub $15 range. Will it move lower? Maybe. Will it return to its mid $40 range. Of course. I would not worry too much about fluctuations in price when the end picture looks positive. I would encourage anyone looking to buy more to do so soon.I have looked at AZUL's price charts for the past year and see when this stock begins to move it does it very quickly. It could double in a month and it has in the past. When the new of the third quarter financials come out and it is positive it is going to jump up. Don't worry about the economy and the Bancs it will always work out...it always does. I am going to buy again and hold for a year. I see a triple in AZUL's near future."
"Stable Cash Runway: Whilst unprofitable Azul has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years if it maintains its current positive free cash flow level.Forecast Cash Runway: Azul is unprofitable but has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years, due to free cash flow being positive and growing by 38.4% per year."
"Boy, no noise here...it's like we are flying on silent mode. The less on the mainstream this is the better, I suppose."
Any expectations for AZUlL?Why it’s going that much down?
WTH happened. Thoughts?
According to news ERJ received government Aid. what that means is Aid is coming to airlines I brazil.
Wow. What’s the reason for this decline?
"ALGT is up 13% today because it reported exactly what AZUL is also doing, and will be reporting in March. Today low volume reflects how everyone is holding this stock and getting ready to see this go to $30. Closing at $24+ today sets this up for a well deserved breakout... and maybe an early one! Diamond Hands will prevail here....."
Time to make another run at $25. Odds are good it will stick this time.
"Don't worry about Covid in Brazil as it relates to AZUL airlines. What is happening has happened, and what is done is done. Meaning, all the things happening today are already fixing themselves to correction, and what is done is in the past and will soon be forgotten. AZUL is mainly a local carrier. Brazilians are traveling within their country borders just fine. With well over a hundred destinations by AZUL, only eleven(11) are outside Brazil. Even if the AZUL discontinued these 11 destinations to combat the spread it would not affect the carrying service it already provides within Brazil. On a better note AZUL added flights to New York earlier this year and when things turn around, and they will soon, this stock will be $40. My guess is by December. Buy now. I added another 3,500 shares. It is one of the few stocks still able to double by December."
"the faulty sell offs are starting again. can someone tell everyone please, that brazil's covid situation is improving A LOT while the US worsens? rofl"
I said it back when it was $5 and $6 but everyone was too focused on Corona and thinking the end of the world!!! Well I hope Lesson learned for those..
Add while you can....this is an upward trajectory. Competitors are less too....latin american travel is back quicker according to charts....this should recover 45% of losses. PT $16 very soon.
whats the news thats making this up?
This stock is money in the long run!Gotta bite the bullet for a few weeks. Lose a little to make a lot.God Bless friends!
Flew on AZUL a few years back - exceptional service from start to finish. Reminds me of how passenger USED to be treated in the USA. Friends in Brazil like this stock as COVID is now waning there and boarding are up again to over half of the pre-COVID highs and the busy summer travel season is arriving.
Any experts care to comment on what the Hainan related equity offering at $16.15 mean for the share price going forward?
What do you think the lack of government support in keeping its citizens safe will have on this stock? Do you think it will drop below $8?
I hold 2500 shares at 10.95 but I do believe it might drop to 10 again today and pick up. I will be ready to buy again
"So my fellow longs, we still grinding this out together?"
Azul is down 7.24% to 14.73
Expecations: dec 2020 back to 80% of dec. 2019. BIG country. BIG on domestic travel. Young population. Only 6% above 60 years. Low fear. Only 4.8% retraction of economy in 2020.
So many sell off today... are they all putting ii all on Tesla???? Hopefully for a rebound tomorrow
20S before end of summer 
"Being the main domestic airline in Brasil,air traveling increasing plus more overseas travel,covid down,it's time to add to my position,it has to go up base on business logic."
"Was just in two flights in Brazil last week. Packed. This is a first in class airline.And Brazil is not reacting to business flying like the U.S., keep this in mind.What a no-brainer. I bought a few 2023 calls on the real cheap when it was down too.David, who started this airline, who was the founder of Jetblue, is starting Breeze...look out for that one.."
"Vaccine news from moderna, AstraZeneca tomorrow- stock SHOULD BE UP 10%-"
"need to rebound to 44 ,still plenty oportunity ,best brazilian airline ,people love this airline and it has smalest debt of them all"
Hahahaha party start 
27@friday
big sell-off at market open like always. i don't get my hopes up anymore for azul.
I have to buy more of this. It honestly is the next Spirit Airlines (SAVE)
"ONE OF THE THINGS I like about Brazil is that the people there are tough. They are not cowering inside, which as it turns out does nothing to slow the spread of Covid. They are living their lives. Good call! This will be over soon then BOOM!"
"Bought in 5k, just saw the Bloomberg reports! Let’s do it!"
Great services and business picking up ahead of their expectations.
"AZUL 11% domestic growth compare with 03/20 last month ,-2%.2 load factor not bad with increase of virus cases ,wax.in the country increasing, good point to enter,Real(currency) will increase in value against dollar."
"Check worldometer ,the corona cases going down ,last diagram ""outcome of total cases"""
"Air traffic in azul increase 26.4% in august in comparison to july of this year as did prices of tickets,good news"
"I think the story on Azul is one of huge longterm opportunity: 40% of a 200M person air-travel market that is growing fast, and a logistics business that is probably worth $250M at its current level, and could be worth 10x that in five years. A great, great chance to buy a company with a clear path of growth ahead of it."
Really good news came out in an SEC filing recently published late yesterday. AZUL is already planning to have a large expansion of flights both internationally and domestically. They state due to the fact they have a flexible fleet they are able to do this. http://www.conferencecalltranscripts.org/no/summary/?id=8007687
"Let's GO!! Need to get to $15, then maybe $18... We can't hold over $12 with reports of rated #1) airlines and better than expected numbers. This might not fly until after Oct."
Azul - Best airline in the world
New investor today and for long term holding. Good luck to everyone
"buy azul, flights all book,for usa."
"people below age thirty flying more then before and out of houses,vaccine being given Azul will be at 30$at february that's my impression"
"I told you guys this stock will be on the 20$ before the end of the year,I have a big position the shorts will be squeeze out.Summer is around the corner ppl will travel.BUY now for Big profits."
Laying people off during a pandemic caused slow down is prudent management. Not laying people off would be worrisome.
So frustrating lol …..
This is the best and most undervalued airlines stock.
Keep buying the dip!!
"bought more today,its cheap,people will fly more and more despite the politics.This stock will be on the thirties by the end of the year"
Just hold. Dont panic sell lol. You will be fine. Do research and you can find out yourself with evidence . This will be eventually back to $40. Patience......
Tomorrow green day
Azul traffic rose m/m 41%.It is the only carrier in 70% of the route that flies
I havent been here in this message board for months and have been holding for over a year now since $8. These recent drops from the mid $20s brought me back to this chat lol. Dang its geting hit hard hopefully we get back up sooner than later . I gotta sell at some point and then buy back in ahahah
BAM! let er fly. Taking some profit in a few mins and will let the rest fly on this and gol!!!
Why is this message board so quiet? We making money yall! Too the moon!!
"Tom Brazil fed will announce reduction in the borrowing rate by 0.75 basis points, which is anticipated by the market. This will cause the real to get weaker and majority of Brazilian stocks to drop, that's what happens historical. Then I'd get in on GOL, not Azul."
"This can go even lower, winter season, high cases of Covid-19..low rate of vaccination, no inside and foreigner tourists..I think 18$ is good!"
"Let's see if people can see past the short term Covid pain, which would seem to be logical thing to do.Realistically, if it drops on the Covid news today, I would just pile in because:A) This pandemic WILL end- B) Anyone with half a brain, would not invest ON ANY airline in a country's population like Brazil of 230MM+ people, OTHER than AZUL - Period. stop. Check out their very weak peers.All U.S. institutions seeking foreign airline exposure on their holdings should take a look at this one before it takes off. It is Best in class. Sure, they are taking on debt, but compare this to U.S. airlines; it is minuscule."
Couldnt resist going back in for another trade after the bottom bounce today at $11.13. Will sell if it drops near $11.50 and let her fly for another round if it holds above that. I still feel like a run is in the works soon. But I will just continue to trade this thing short term until we see a steady trend reversal. The volatility is perfect for short term trading lately. Good luck tomorrow everyone..
Is everyone holding their breath?
"So, Rodgerson says that taking over Latam is a process too complicated to outright confirm which is why he is not. But it seems to be a goal they aim toward although honoring uncertainties.If you use in-browser google translate, you can skip the paywall and read the indirect quote here.https://blogs.oglobo.globo.com/capital/post/azul-preve-retomar-metade-da-demanda-pre-pandemia-ja-no-terceiro-trimestre.html"
"Brazil is the largest country in Latin America. More than 200 million people. Take away $GOL and $AZUL then they almost have no airlines. Those two airlines will not go bankrupt, at least not in the next 5 years..By the second week to July these two airlines should be up 150% each. The market, stock brokers, impatient people who want to get rich overnight, angry people like creating fear. Did I mention that Brazil has a new Treasury secretary to oversee the Airlines stability as soon as possible?"
do i buy it now?
this feels like its moving slow and it is. but i have been holding azul over the last couple months since the predictable volatility subsided and it has been a real winner. slow and steady gains. I think I may be getting emotionally attached lol... Hold long :)
"at this moment, AAL is own -1.23%, UAL -2.74% and AZUL -8.04% -> you have to be kiddingAZUL has more demand, more supply, less infections, vacation outlook just in front, q3 numbers on nov 5th"
Fly Baby Fly
Enticed to buy at these levels but not sure what is causing the decline.
Went long on a small position.. testing the water again. hope this may be the start of a slow reversal. hope it sustains
Easy $20 when the momentum shifts
"@Ivan Another 3.7% down. 80,000+ new cases every day in Brazil. Sell and buy US airline stocks."
cases are down in bosnia there i include azul will rocket ship to the EMA GAP and dow futures 32 thousand by November 17th
company outlook improving every month
"Azul Announces Second Quarter Liquidity Position and Cash Burn GuidanceSão Paulo, August 02, 2020 – Azul S.A., “Azul” (B3: AZUL4, NYSE: AZUL), announces today that as of June 30th, 2020, its preliminary liquidity position, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivables, totaled R$2.3 billion compared to R$2.2 billion on March 31st and to a previous forecast of R$ 2.0 billion. Azul had originally forecasted a daily cash burn between R$3 million and R$4 million in May and June, but was actually able to increase its cash position in the same period.For the remainder of 2020 the Company expects an average daily cash burn of approximately R$3 million with no scheduled debt amortization as a result of ongoing negotiations with its financial partners. In addition, thanks to the intensive efforts made by the Company in partnering with its crewmembers, financial partners, and lessors, as well as the faster than expected ramp-up in capacity and demand, the Company’s projections show sufficient liquidity through the end of 2021 assuming no new capital raise. However, since there is still uncertainty in the recovery, the Company plans to raise additional capital in due time to increase its liquidity cushion.“Thanks to the support of our partners and the efforts of our crewmembers, we were able to increase the Company’s cash position during the second quarter of the year, which was without a doubt the most challenging in aviation history. The Azul recovery plan has yielded better than expected results. We have satisfied our short-term liquidity needs, and we are confident in our ability to navigate this crisis and restore our position as one of the most profitable airlines in the region,” said Alex Malfitani, Azul’s CFO. https://api.mziq.com/mzfilemanager/v2/d/ed78542a-4e01-429a-8926-03d69ccfa307/ad2ad445-80c2-bf82-7d9d-80a9ce1eb81e?origin=1"

"The current scenario of high exchange rates and waning demand has negatively impacted the three major sectors in Brazil.The Latam group, which filed for bankruptcy in the United States at the end of May, is the one that is most dependent on international routes, which have had the greatest retraction.According to the risk rating agency Fitch, 51% of the company's revenue comes from international routes. Another 30% come from the Brazilian domestic market, in which the company disputes the leadership with Gol.Azul and Gol, on the other hand, have sought to renegotiate debts to avoid having to resort to judicial recovery in Brazil.The big three have in common the difficulty of paying off all debts without an injection of new money in the coming months, an accumulated drop in market value during the pandemic and a billionaire debt.The liabilities are formed mostly by bank loans and aircraft and engine leasing contracts.The contribution should come from the bailout package of the BNDES (National Bank for Economic and Social Development), which provided R $ 2 billion per company, considered insufficient to prevent the companies from failing.The president of Latam Brasil, Jerome Cadier, has already stated that he expects the funds to come in July. Although the biggest hurry to receive the money is from Latam, it is a fact that Gol and Azul also need cash later this year"
Anyone have an idea what happen today? Why it went up almost 10%
