"Wow, down 25% in 5 days. What happened?"
I havent been here in this message board for months and have been holding for over a year now since $8. These recent drops from the mid $20s brought me back to this chat lol. Dang its geting hit hard hopefully we get back up sooner than later . I gotta sell at some point and then buy back in ahahah
"Being the main domestic airline in Brasil,air traveling increasing plus more overseas travel,covid down,it's time to add to my position,it has to go up base on business logic."
"This is sooo oversold, when this thing turns ... to the Moon baby!!"
Really……
Loaded up the boat today. I set my sell order for 25 when it fills it fills
Easy $20 when the momentum shifts
"Haven't been here to comment on AZUL in a long while if ever. I did buy AZUL in May for $20 and thought it was a good deal. I sold around the $27 mark a month later in June. I have been doing a lot of looking into this company recently because of the extremely low price for a major airline that made it thought the pandemic very well. I went to the AZUL website and looked through their financials for 2021, 2020 and 2019. I am reading a lot about the Brazilian economy and the Bancs need for input. I hear a little about stagnation as well. And I have read these comments here. I think AZUL is a great buy right now in the sub $15 range. Will it move lower? Maybe. Will it return to its mid $40 range. Of course. I would not worry too much about fluctuations in price when the end picture looks positive. I would encourage anyone looking to buy more to do so soon.I have looked at AZUL's price charts for the past year and see when this stock begins to move it does it very quickly. It could double in a month and it has in the past. When the new of the third quarter financials come out and it is positive it is going to jump up. Don't worry about the economy and the Bancs it will always work out...it always does. I am going to buy again and hold for a year. I see a triple in AZUL's near future."
traffic up123% in september y/y over.Flights to USA start nxt month from Brasil.
Down 12%?! Wow! For what?
Wow. What’s the reason for this decline?
So frustrating lol …..
Azul is down 7.24% to 14.73
This is going to slingshot it’s way back to $20 as soon as the tide turns
Currency deflation and oil is the issue right now. Long term this is a clear buy.
What is going onnnn :(
$AZUL seems like fuel prices related swoon. Gol is down 20% too. CPA not so much. Seems to be levelling off.
"buy azul, flights all book,for usa."
Enticed to buy at these levels but not sure what is causing the decline.
"Time to buy.. The company is in good shape financially and soon will be back fully operational. Whats happening in Brazil is an economical issue because the Economic Minister is trying to approve some stimulus and the other side opposes it, saying it will exceed the spending limit and will create more debts with no way to pay it. Among others things..."
