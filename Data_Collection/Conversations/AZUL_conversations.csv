Azul is down 7.24% to 14.73
"Haven't been here to comment on AZUL in a long while if ever. I did buy AZUL in May for $20 and thought it was a good deal. I sold around the $27 mark a month later in June. I have been doing a lot of looking into this company recently because of the extremely low price for a major airline that made it thought the pandemic very well. I went to the AZUL website and looked through their financials for 2021, 2020 and 2019. I am reading a lot about the Brazilian economy and the Bancs need for input. I hear a little about stagnation as well. And I have read these comments here. I think AZUL is a great buy right now in the sub $15 range. Will it move lower? Maybe. Will it return to its mid $40 range. Of course. I would not worry too much about fluctuations in price when the end picture looks positive. I would encourage anyone looking to buy more to do so soon.I have looked at AZUL's price charts for the past year and see when this stock begins to move it does it very quickly. It could double in a month and it has in the past. When the new of the third quarter financials come out and it is positive it is going to jump up. Don't worry about the economy and the Bancs it will always work out...it always does. I am going to buy again and hold for a year. I see a triple in AZUL's near future."
"Being the main domestic airline in Brasil,air traveling increasing plus more overseas travel,covid down,it's time to add to my position,it has to go up base on business logic."
$AZUL seems like fuel prices related swoon. Gol is down 20% too. CPA not so much. Seems to be levelling off.
"buy azul, flights all book,for usa."
I havent been here in this message board for months and have been holding for over a year now since $8. These recent drops from the mid $20s brought me back to this chat lol. Dang its geting hit hard hopefully we get back up sooner than later . I gotta sell at some point and then buy back in ahahah
Enticed to buy at these levels but not sure what is causing the decline.
Short sellers are active because they can! that is about it! They know putting the fear works;
This is going to slingshot it’s way back to $20 as soon as the tide turns
Anyone know what time earnings figures are being released?
"Don't worry about Covid in Brazil as it relates to AZUL airlines. What is happening has happened, and what is done is done. Meaning, all the things happening today are already fixing themselves to correction, and what is done is in the past and will soon be forgotten. AZUL is mainly a local carrier. Brazilians are traveling within their country borders just fine. With well over a hundred destinations by AZUL, only eleven(11) are outside Brazil. Even if the AZUL discontinued these 11 destinations to combat the spread it would not affect the carrying service it already provides within Brazil. On a better note AZUL added flights to New York earlier this year and when things turn around, and they will soon, this stock will be $40. My guess is by December. Buy now. I added another 3,500 shares. It is one of the few stocks still able to double by December."
"Full recovery in 2021:Azul Reports December 2021 Traffic São Paulo, February 8, 2021 – Azul S.A., “Azul”, (B3: AZUL4, NYSE: AZUL), the largest airline in Brazil by number of cities served and flight departures, announces today its preliminary traffic results for January 2021. Domestic passenger traffic (RPKs) increased 13.2% compared to January 2019 on a domestic capacity increase (ASKs) of 17.6%, resulting in a load factor of 79.3%.“We began the year on a very positive note as one of the few airlines in the world, if not the only, with domestic recovery already above 2019. We continue to monitor the development of the pandemic and the positive benefit from the vaccine rollout closely, and remain confident in a full recovery during 2021”, said John Rodgerson, Azul’s CEO."
"bought more today,virus (covid) going down in Brazil has better immunity to the virus (herd) much better then vaxx.that is my opinion,everything is open,and traveling season will increase by september going forward,it's taking off,up and up...."
Loaded up the boat today. I set my sell order for 25 when it fills it fills
Currency deflation and oil is the issue right now. Long term this is a clear buy.
Easy $20 when the momentum shifts
"Azul and LATAM today announce an agreement to connect routes in their domestic networks in Brazil. We will also have a partnership for loyalty programs, where TudoAzul members and LATAM Pass members can accumulate points in the program of their choice. Initially there will be 50 domestic routes to/from: Brasília (BSB), Belo Horizonte (CNF), Recife (REC), Porto Alegre (POA), Campinas (VCP), Curitiba (CWB) and São Paulo - Guarulhos (GRU), offering customers several options of new and more convenient connections in Brazil. They will also enable a smoother travel experience between Azul and LATAM flights, with shared tickets for check-in and baggage dispatch. Tickets will go on sale in the coming months."

New to the market. Bought Azul about a week ago. Asking for advice please. Should I hold or sell at $20?? I appreciate everyone’s opinion. Thank you
"Let's see if people can see past the short term Covid pain, which would seem to be logical thing to do.Realistically, if it drops on the Covid news today, I would just pile in because:A) This pandemic WILL end- B) Anyone with half a brain, would not invest ON ANY airline in a country's population like Brazil of 230MM+ people, OTHER than AZUL - Period. stop. Check out their very weak peers.All U.S. institutions seeking foreign airline exposure on their holdings should take a look at this one before it takes off. It is Best in class. Sure, they are taking on debt, but compare this to U.S. airlines; it is minuscule."
"beginning 11/01/21 brazilians w vax.can travel to US, +for azul."
Add while you can....this is an upward trajectory. Competitors are less too....latin american travel is back quicker according to charts....this should recover 45% of losses. PT $16 very soon.
Really……
What is going onnnn :(
"Wow, the market cap on this getting decimated...like chump change for such an airline...amazing!And on no apparent particular news that anyone is commenting...how odd..."
Going to $9 before back to 20

$44 stock pre-covid one of the premier airlines in S.A. and the top choice. Great balance sheet. $44 to $11....this is bouncing to $20 soon.
So frustrating lol …..
"I told you so,buy more, thinks in Brasil are improving ,azul is going higher!in decmber starts summer vacation (last 3mths)covid cases are coming down,Azul finances improving,best airline, big country,economy better,dollar will devalue,what are you waiting for,BUY to make good profit has I am doing."
"Wow, down 25% in 5 days. What happened?"
"Azul Reports November 2020 Traffic. On track to emerges as the winner in the airline industry:“In November we recovered 85% of our domestic demand, which is one of the fastest rates in the world. Weexpect this trend to continue as we progressively ramp up our operations. We will fly to 113 destinations by theend of 2020 as our fleet flexibility and unique network structure enable us to accurately match capacity withdemand”, said John Rodgerson, Azul’s CEO."
"The current scenario of high exchange rates and waning demand has negatively impacted the three major sectors in Brazil.The Latam group, which filed for bankruptcy in the United States at the end of May, is the one that is most dependent on international routes, which have had the greatest retraction.According to the risk rating agency Fitch, 51% of the company's revenue comes from international routes. Another 30% come from the Brazilian domestic market, in which the company disputes the leadership with Gol.Azul and Gol, on the other hand, have sought to renegotiate debts to avoid having to resort to judicial recovery in Brazil.The big three have in common the difficulty of paying off all debts without an injection of new money in the coming months, an accumulated drop in market value during the pandemic and a billionaire debt.The liabilities are formed mostly by bank loans and aircraft and engine leasing contracts.The contribution should come from the bailout package of the BNDES (National Bank for Economic and Social Development), which provided R $ 2 billion per company, considered insufficient to prevent the companies from failing.The president of Latam Brasil, Jerome Cadier, has already stated that he expects the funds to come in July. Although the biggest hurry to receive the money is from Latam, it is a fact that Gol and Azul also need cash later this year"
"I bought more today. My average is $14. Hopefully, this will go back to $20."
"Time to buy.. The company is in good shape financially and soon will be back fully operational. Whats happening in Brazil is an economical issue because the Economic Minister is trying to approve some stimulus and the other side opposes it, saying it will exceed the spending limit and will create more debts with no way to pay it. Among others things..."
"Azul Announces Second Quarter Liquidity Position and Cash Burn GuidanceSão Paulo, August 02, 2020 – Azul S.A., “Azul” (B3: AZUL4, NYSE: AZUL), announces today that as of June 30th, 2020, its preliminary liquidity position, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and accounts receivables, totaled R$2.3 billion compared to R$2.2 billion on March 31st and to a previous forecast of R$ 2.0 billion. Azul had originally forecasted a daily cash burn between R$3 million and R$4 million in May and June, but was actually able to increase its cash position in the same period.For the remainder of 2020 the Company expects an average daily cash burn of approximately R$3 million with no scheduled debt amortization as a result of ongoing negotiations with its financial partners. In addition, thanks to the intensive efforts made by the Company in partnering with its crewmembers, financial partners, and lessors, as well as the faster than expected ramp-up in capacity and demand, the Company’s projections show sufficient liquidity through the end of 2021 assuming no new capital raise. However, since there is still uncertainty in the recovery, the Company plans to raise additional capital in due time to increase its liquidity cushion.“Thanks to the support of our partners and the efforts of our crewmembers, we were able to increase the Company’s cash position during the second quarter of the year, which was without a doubt the most challenging in aviation history. The Azul recovery plan has yielded better than expected results. We have satisfied our short-term liquidity needs, and we are confident in our ability to navigate this crisis and restore our position as one of the most profitable airlines in the region,” said Alex Malfitani, Azul’s CFO. https://api.mziq.com/mzfilemanager/v2/d/ed78542a-4e01-429a-8926-03d69ccfa307/ad2ad445-80c2-bf82-7d9d-80a9ce1eb81e?origin=1"
