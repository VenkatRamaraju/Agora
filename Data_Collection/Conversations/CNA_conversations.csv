"CNA Financial Corporation is a poorly run company due to incompetent people running it. They claimed in a Federal lawsuit they overpaid someone for 11 years on lifetime annunity contract. The sum total of the over payment was 247,096 dollars which would be broken down to 22,128 dollars per year. They clearly they dont know how to review accounts properly. They should have found this ""error"" long before the 11 years has passed. The money they wasted filing the lawsuit as well should worry each of us because in the end they withdrew it. I am convinced the only thing keeping this company afloat are questionable accounting practices. they may not be illegal but they have to be pushing ethical bounds."
