Well .. not too bad compared to the rest of the market
"k has never let me down, Held it for years. Great retirement investment."
"Earnings beat, top and bottom"
"Something doesnt add up. Either the earning forecasts were wrong, or they sold for too cheap. Seems like smoke and mirrors to me. Using the sale as an excuse to cut dividend. And earnings were not going to be met. Why would you sell for 10% of enterprise value what causes you to need to cut divi by 30% and earning by 25%. Doesnt add upp to sell for 10%. Smoke and mirrors. Maybe ol’ warren the oracle is lining someones pockets."
"Investors, is the drop with D still related to Scana merger? In your opinion?"
I purchased this equity for the roughly 5% yield and to my surprise its up 22% to boot!
so i see a green day and this #$%$ is red.... how does that work???

Why are utilities so interest rate sensitive? A better economy that causes higher rates also means increased electricity demand benefiting utilities. Just wondering if anybody has any insights as to why that is or is not the case.
"Frank, I like purchasing D shares for $69 on dividend reinvestment and selling the same shares for $80 later on. I have own D for years and it will be back in the 80's. This is not my first rodeo with D"
Yesterday was an absolute disaster. Management MUST be replaced. The magnitude of the dividend cut is completely unacceptable. A class action lawsuit has got be be initiated. Recently released forward guidance was not truthful.
What is wrong with the utility sector here lately? a lot more negative days than positive days
anyone Trade D consistently? I thought it was in trading range and now not so much ... comments/input/.
I just received my dividend statement. I have always reinvested and this statement does not show any reinvestment. They do not have a bank account number to send dividend to. I just called them and the auto message states to call during normal hours . This is moral hours. Did anyone else have the same problem . I have been using their drip for more then ten years!
What's the difference between D and DCUE?
Payday today thanks big D
One lesson I’ve learned in 30 years of investing... never bet against Dominion. Market roasted them for divesting NG assets before NG prices dropped too. It’s good strategy getting SCANA... buying opportunity
Looks like the shorts are covering..guess it's good news@!!
"Just got a letter from Farrell explaining why the ACP was cancelled, why the sale of assets to Buffett, and why the dividend reduction. As I suspected, they were all done for the long term health of the company. This letter was sent out to all Dominion Energy retirees."
Finally! Nice if it can close @ $70 -or higher of course!
D is very good to me. I get my monthly retirement check and this wonderful dividend. Go big D!

The company has a diverse mix of assets that provide multiple options to achieve its credit objectives while still achieving its earnings targets.

"Experts said utilities were a ""safe haven"" and Tesla was risky!"
WHAt just ahppened $74.2 to $72.06 in 10 minutes???
From the Conference Call :-Better than expected Tax savings.-Growth in electric and gas distribution businesses.-Higher margins do to lower maintenance and operating costs.-On FERC- D and others have requested 'expediated re-hearing' it will take years for it to have material effect on DMP distributable cash flow- and any change will be inmaterial to D's earnings. Atlantic coast pipline and Cove point are not directly impacted by FERC outlines.-The reason dividend increase in 2020 'is grey area' is due to MLP uncertainty.-Cove point 'is booked' for 20 years!-They are still 'optimistic' on SCANA.
At least above 70.
Will buy under $72
payday tomorrow
Long D. Created a position today. Been watching this one for a long time. Management says this will be a positive right away. On top of 10% dividend growth out till 2020 (Most Recent Quarter Slides) and a safe business. Though I may be young I love the safe dividend with compounding interest.
"So the infrastructure plan helps Dominion, anybody think we hit 80s next week?"
$73.40 is the price- 5% yield is the div... buy will be the action... lock and load...
"Old article...... but if you read carefully, it turned out Farrell made some poor business decisions that culminated in a significant dividend cut and share decline. Per the article, he is very involved and enjoys participating in the rarefied social circles in Richmond. Given his failed business decisions, failed Richmond development pursuit,really poor timing on a movie hobby., and his age..... it's a small leap of understanding he wants to rehabilitate his image and leave a positive legacy. Per his own words, he wasn't going anywhere and wasn't giving up ""leadership"" of Dominion after the reshuffle of positions. The board is submissive to him and Blue seems to be too. The ""all in"" turn to renewable energy production is worthy, but the technology has yet to be proven a viable business model (I sure hope it does). My concern is Farrell is forsaking shareholder value for his own personal concerns of legacy and status. This company has enjoyed a history of being a solid investment and until lately was a foundation of any retirement portfolio. Right now my confidence in Dominion's leadership is shaken..... I hope I am wrong. I invite you to send a message when it's time to vote again and vote ""no confidence"" to all leadership. Maybe that will wake (woke) them up.https://richmond.com/news/virginia/farrell-not-going-anywhere-as-dominion-resets-leadership-succession/article_3e6dc4cc-7436-5150-a1f4-771bf996f78e.html"
"Dominion Energy just retaliated against a whistleblower who went to the NRC with safety concerns. Keep your eyes on the news in the coming months regarding their Millstone Nuclear Power station in Waterford, CT."
Haven't all the contingentcies been accounted for in the SCANA merger/purchase?
Recently released guidance was untruthful. Management MUST go.
"Does anyone know - were the 70 million in 'non-core' assets sales in the SCANA settlement out today known to D when they made their initial offer(s) to purchase SCANA? if not, seems like we need to rework our offer."
"From what I read a few weeks ago, the dividend will be reduced to $2.61 a share, after the 4th quarter dividend of .94 is distributed. The good news on this is, that Dominion will be using a few billion dollars to repurchase their own stock. I am guessing that approximately 5% of their outstanding shares, or 40+ million shares will be purchased within the next few months."
Has anyone considered buying scana? If approved by all agencies and shareholders you will receive .669 shares of D.... using the 64.00 recent price that translates into $42.81 and scana is trading at $36.66 at the moment....
You can view 'ex parte' meeting on-line. Main questions were on renewable energy and jobs- along with rate relief. Odds are good that merger will be approved from what was presented. Nuke rate relief negotiations are still the 'wild-card'.
"Will D still increase the dividend even though the stock price continues to erode? Maybe things will change, but kind of puts a hole in the promised 10% return (6% dividend increase / 6% share appreciation). I for one hope the leadership's commitment is valid, if not, they should be voted out."
The market is at all time highs and D-shares are down 15+% from highs; dividend down 30+% from highs..... Where is the new CEO? Does he and the board have a plan to increase (or gain back where they were six months ago) shareholder value? Or do they even care?
Looks like earnings release is scheduled for Jan 29th. Get the 'lowdown' on what is going on with SCG then. Also- maybe a divi increase announced as well? It is usually March payment when it is raised :)
Added on the dip today. I have a feeling AAPL will push the market down over the next several trading days. Bought D and AEP today.
"Offshore windfarm energy construction is due for completion in 2026. Their construction of the windfarm equipment servicing vessel is due online by 2023. It will be Jones Act compliant and be US flagged. Short term traders could care less, but long term holders should profit dramatically over time."
"Stock price the same as it was 5 years ago, dividend was cut by a third and the stock is still way overvalued."
I will buy under $72

"Just to post again: ""When will the ""Blue Crew"" return to their fiduciary responsibility of increasing shareholder value?"""
"Dominion will implement a 7.7% rate hike on S.C. residents in six months. For a consumer who averages a $300 monthly bill that means they will be paying a 13th extra check of $300 to Dominion. Meanwhile Dominion donated 3.5 million to Benedict College's STEM program. Benedict is one of the poorest performing and financially run minority colleges in the U.S. If you read Dominion's recent press releases it is primarily about the money they are donating to woke projects at the expense of their customers and shareholders. Vote the board out and take a close look at the current CEO. The average Dominion customer is hurting financially right now with the dim crashed covid economy and I have never seen a rate hike from a utility in the S.E.

The donations are part of the company's ""We Care Rebuild Project,"" which has designated $5 million to social justice and community rebuilding efforts across its 16-state footprint."
What is the justification for the significant dividend cut? I have lost $5000 in annual dividend income. Never expected this from Dominion.
Does anyone out there know if D is going to mandate COVID vaccines? Any spike in cases at one of the power stations could cause a disruption of services.
"everyone thumbs down me, hopefully some listen, i warned you.. while there was bogus articles claiming this would be a good thing... maybe for the long term for the company. but for investors short term you have keep an eye on your investment. read daily about the company you have your money in. if there a divy cut. thats not good in short term, EVERY other stock that trimmed or cut the divy dropped like a rock.. not sure why this one took so long. on top you have boards selling their shares in the mid 80s.. and the fail Atlantic coast project.. 39 billion in debt.. must i go on.."
Great dividend. Just bought some. I’ll be rewarded in time at these prices. Easy buy

"Flashback: Here's what Dominion's CEO Thomas Farrell told analysts on the firm's fourth-quarter 2018 conference call:""We recognized that it (dividend growth) is not going to be 10% in 2020, highly unlikely. And over time, we will bring the dividend growth rate, not going to be a cut in our dividend, that’s not even in contemplations, the notions will bring our growth rate of our dividends more in line with our peers after this year."""
D just raised the dividend 10%. Sweet!
"SCANA = a bargain for Dominion - D is smart enough to turn SCANA's chicken-poop into D's ""chicken-salad"" ... D has a SMART BOD, and will become the nation's largest Utility Company This dip will be short-lived, as we see the stock is already UP since the initial announcement ;-)"
"Under Dominion’s announced dividend plan, the Dividend will rise to $4.00 by December, 2019."
"From D CEO interview on Cramer:CEO interview - Dominion Energy (NYSE:D)""Dominion announced the merger of Scana Corp. (NYSE:SCG) for $14.6B. Cramer interviewed CEO Tom Farrell to know more about the deal.Farrell said that Scana is an incredible company with many assets, gas utilities and gas sales. The deal is complex as Scana was forced to abandon a $10B nuclear facility project. This deal will help Scana customers by offering $1.3B in refunds within 9 days of the deal.The customers will also get 5% reduction as consolation for the nuclear project. This deal will be accretive to Dominion's earnings immediately even after the payout as Dominion is six times larger than Scana and they will be able to deploy resources to take advantage of great opportunities in South Carolina.Dominion is also ready for its first natural gas export terminal in Virginia after 5 years of planning and construction, and they have 20-year contracts in place with Japan and India for American sourced gas. Farrell also thinks there will be more nuclear facilities in the long term but nothing in short term""."

"Per Wallmine website: LAST UPDATED: 28 DECEMBER 2020 AT 6:57PM ESTThomas Farrell Net WorthThe estimated Net Worth of Thomas F Ii Farrell is at least $113 Million dollars as of 7 December 2020. Mr. Farrell owns over 50,000 units of Dominion Inc stock worth over $67,766,029 and over the last 17 years he sold D stock worth over $28,190,006. In addition, he makes $17,257,000 as Executive Chairman of the Board at Dominion Inc.Stock down 15% from 2020 highs, dividend cut by 33% and he is paid $17M plus...... with that performance, is he worth the compensation?"
Whatever happened with the giant stock buy-back that was part of divesting the gas business?
"I love utilities, but it worries me that most are trading at 20+ pe's like come on they are utilities, not growth stocks."
"I invest in Duke Energy and was looking at D, can anyone tell me why the PE ration is out the roof? I have always been taught that a PE ration around 20 is a over valued stock, but D is around 50 I have never seen a PE ratio that high, can someone tell me why so high???"
"Thanks Dead Farrell, your mismanagement now makes D a speculative stock with an underwater dividend versus inflation."
"Great utility sector movement today - most ute's went x-divy last monthYes, D will drop at least the divy price, and possibly regain, or exceed that drop by the end of the day. GO BIG D"
"Latest Morningstar analyst- D 'fair value' @ $87-"" Dominion remains one of our top U.S. utilitiespicks based on its high-quality business and relativelycheap valuation. Dominion trades at an 11% discount toour fair value estimate as of Jan. 8. Since Scanashareholders would become Dominion shareholders if thedeal closes, we think Scana shareholders have even morelong-term upside than the market prices imply.South Carolina politicians gave Dominion's offer alukewarm reception. Legislators return to session Jan. 9and are set to repeal Scana's right to recover the $5 billionspent on its new V.C. Summer nuclear project. If thatlegislation passes, it could violate one of Dominion'sclosing conditions. However, we think Dominion's size asthe second-largest U.S. utility by market cap gives it roomto negotiate what we estimate is about a $1 billiondifference between its offer and opponents' demands.We expect a first read from South Carolina regulatorswhen the companies hold an ex parte briefing Jan. 11.Scana has also said it will file its first post-abandonmentrate proposal within the next week, but that could bepostponed""."
Thank God this is a 3rd of my portfolio!!!
"mmm, D seems to be following up on 'positive after-hours mkt activity' from last night?"
Only two more shopping days to pick up a great stock before X-divy
Dominion does not keep its promise. Should this surprise you?
"""Blue Crew"", are you paying any attention?Dominion Energy Inc. (NYSE:D) was in 34 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of June. The all time high for this statistic is 47. D shareholders have witnessed a decrease in support from the world's most elite money managers in recent months. There were 39 hedge funds in our database with D holdings at the end of March. Our calculations also showed that D isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q2 rankings"
"For those who are determined to keep Dominion or acquire the stock you need to answer this question-Are you willing to invest in a Company that blind-sides investors? I supported Dominion management by voting for their slate of directors and approving all compensation plans. The Atlantic Coast pipeline project was in its sixth year. I bought the Dominion stock because the pipeline project and LNG terminal set Dominion apart from the other stodgy utilities. Now Dominion seems intent on becoming just another regulated, stodgy utility except Dominion's management can not be trusted. Finally on the dividend cut, they cut the dividend by 1/3rd in the midst of a historic economic downturn when retirees, such as me, needed the income to pay bills. They retained the share repurchase program to boost the EPS and maintain the value of their stock options. I have no use for a management that can not be trusted or depended on. Buyer be ware."
Didn't realize this stock is at a 4 1/2 year low. Yield is fantastic now.....over 5%. Will have to put this company on my 'radar' list....
"We need a new ceo. I have never seen a stock crater like this one when they sold something and the acquirer go up. Get out ceo, you can't run a business."
I was going to buy D but was wondering if its too late to get in now? I was hoping for $80? Any chance we get there? Thanks
SCANA down big today. It should be up. The deal to be bought by Dominion may not be going well.
I see Georgia 'gave blessing' on Dominion/Scan merger- but still 'slim' that South Carolina legislature will let 'rate hikes' stay in place!
Get a 5% divi MPW just raised guidance. 22 mil shares short just got whipsawed when co raised guidance. Ex divi 9/15

"Big D heading back up slowly, div jacked nicely. Cove Point and Scana buy are long term endeavors- they are planned out over decades. I'm glad I bought low, when the chips were down and gloom&doom high."
This transaction is a disaster. Reduction in expected EPS and dividend of over 30% with only enough cash to buy back 5% of oustanding shares. Net loss to shareholders of 25% of value. We are lucky the stock is only down 10%! The shareholder lawsuits are coming next!
"I'm thinking if this shr price gets close to where I bought it (82.7) I might sell half of my holdings and go with SO. I already hold a LOT of PPL and AEP, FE. I don't have any SO so I might go with that."

"On the last call, Steve/shareholder relations mentioned that he planned to launch a ""information"" campaign to better communicate the decisions made and plan going forward. Seems to me if the decisions were in the best interest of the shareholders, this effort would not be needed..... hmmm, sell a business, $3B in cash and lower the dividend by 33%. And tell us this is how the monies will reward the shareholders? Why not defend and freeze the dividend and let the business grow into the payout? Share buybacks rarely reward the long term shareholder, but yes it will make the financials look better with a higher EPS. If free cash flow would not support reinvestment for power generation without lowering the dividend, there may be more problems than fully communicated."

Rest assured once your portfolio is at its lows D will be at its highs
Go mighty D
"The deal was completed today. Jan 2, 2019, The merger is official."
is it true D owns a LNG terminal on east coast???If so should be moving up like Chienre Energy?
go mighty D. try for 72 today
The up trend is still intact. Looking good 
Stocks rise. Stocks fall. I bought most of my shares of D last year at $65 so I have concern if the price fluctuates between $80 and $73. The most important thing with a company like this is its dividend. I do enjoy predicting future price moves. Look at all asset classes. At record highs. Even now gold is catching up after lagging for years. The issue is EASY MONEY and as long as this remains all assets will rise higher...
"Well, I guess they have run out of buy-back money. Will the stock bottom out in the low 70s are even 60s? Six years to get back to this years dividend payout; 10 years to get back to this years highs...... really well managed company. Remember when it's time to vote again."
Hmmmm...... Duke at 92 [no dividend cut]; Dom at 80 [with significant dividend cut]........ what's the difference in the two companies? I have my opinion........
"I took the time to read much of what has been posted lately in the ""Investor Relations"" site. They give a lot of time to ES&G issues. There is a thinly veiled attempt to re-make Dominion Resources into a maternal entity. Curiously, there is little comment about those steering the utility as to their responsibility to the shareholders. What a shame, this company -was- shareholder friendly and for years provided a worthy return in equity appreciation and dividend. It almost appears that Farrell is trying to re-make his brand at the expense of the shareholders. The board seems to be submissive and allows Farrell to do what he wants without any oversight. My hope is everyone will vote ""a no confidence"" vote at the next annual meeting"
Added today. Today's news is very positive.
The market is overreacting to this deal.
Going GREEN means going Broke. Either you can supply the residents or you don't make money. Use all forms of energy.
"Ex-div today, so less than 83-cts down is good."
"I hear and read all of the buy and sell articles. The only thing I am interested in is what caused this steep stumble and does any one have any idea when it will come to an end. I am one of the small fries and have only 2000 shares that I have accumulated over the years because of the great dividend returns, but now I am afraid that the loses we are sustaining have eaten all of my profits in the last month. Can any one help allay my fears?"
Two months ago management reaffirmed earning estimates for 2020 & was positive on the Atlantic Coast pipeline project. I bought based on their guidance which now looks like a bunch of lies.
"We, the shareholders, have one recourse and that is to vote the entire board of directors out at the next annual meeting, This will be the fifth year of earnings decline. There is no mention of responsibility to shareholders and no plan to date to increase share value. When you vote, start with voting against Farrell and work your way down the list. If we pull together we can make a difference."
"The divvy is safe, right? My goodness, these price levels are extraordinary. 5.3%. Stock goes from 85 to 63 in a few short months. This is a utility, not a tech stock, right?"
"William, maybe 72.50 tomorrow"
"poss. new investor here. just curious about yearly dividends this stock pays out,all comments welcome"
"Cramer, on his show tonight told his audience to buy D tomorrow and that it’s a good long term. :-)"
I see that D has the 'Annual Meeting' scheduled for May 9th- which should clarify everything that is going on now and how they are addressing the recent 'hiccups'.
When will this stock ever go up
"Ghost of Dead Farrell, the gift that keeps giving…… I mean taking, share price!"
Done nothing since 2017. What's to like??
"Given the board of directors we have, the CEO and his legacy team, their inability or more likely their lack of interest in the shareholders of D...... I have lost hope of this company to provide a return on investment more than barely average. This ""team"" never speaks of any plans or strategy to increase shareholder value. Yes, they give a courtesy mention of 6% growth / 6% increase in dividend per year for 5 years. This is nothing more than a forecast and the share growth value story is already lagging that vision. We have an average board and average CEO which results in average results. Unless the investment community decides to become actively engaged in this company...... there are much better places to invest."
Ghost of Dead Farrell still haunting this stock!!!
OOOOOOO.......ESG Ghost of Dead Farrell still haunting D shareholders.......

"$6/share in earnings times a 15 p/e equals a price of $90. With a nice dividend, even it it only gets to $80 that's a wonderful return."
may top 76.90 today ( I Hope)
See today that D is announcing giving away another 1.3 million. They need to concentrate on getting the dividend and share price back up.
"Well, it looks like the merger may not go through. S. C. legislature just passed legislation that may cause D to opt out. We'll see."
"Thesis: If the economy slows, D yield remains attractive, so hold the stock. If the economy heats up, D share price will start dropping and provide an opportunity to buy on a dollar-cost-average basis for a number of years, building a solid income source for the future and eventual re-appreciation. I'm 63 and can see buying for another 5 years or so, but the real opportunity is for the 40-year-olds. Much simpler than some mutual fund, both on a tax and earnings basis (not to mention picking the fund.)"
"As a long term and considerate investor in big D, I have taken a position in a company ATAI that perhaps will benefit the Blue Crew....... or myself if I continue to witness their shareholder interest."
Solar project 27 miles out at sea. This is a huge undertaking with a current 9 billion dollar price tag. But those with wisdom know that that figure has the potential to be double. I hope the leadership team remembers the pitfalls of (Scana) before any financia balance sheet distress. I really see a future Merger on the horizon with a bigger utility.
Any idea what is going on. Up 2.88%. I'm definitely not complaining.
Bought my first shares in 1989 at 14.50 a share.Dividends on those shares are $15 a share today
"a few more D today <70, add a few O and DNP as well. Waitng on SO to go >5% yield... I'm building up the div machine!"
Dividend increase coming our way . 2.5% increase. Happy holidays everyone!
"Dealing with the South Carolina government just adds risk and uncertainty to this. They seem very emotional and unpredictable. Dominion should be very careful. No good deed goes unpunished. South Carolina may want to let SCANA go belly up if it means they all get re-elected. D should pass now, and revisit this in bankruptcy court."
Article today from South Carolina university professor basically saying that the Merger would be a No-Brainer for South Carolina. This may flip the SC Legislature. :-)

"Looks like the South Carolina legislature will be approving the Scana acquisition on November 21, 2018.That is the last hurdle. Should be a positive impact on Dominion stock price."
"I encourage every stakeholder to attend. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) will host its third-quarter 2021 earnings call at 10 a.m. ET on Friday, Nov. 5, 2021. Management will discuss matters of interest to financial and other stakeholders including recent financial results. At the last earnings call, the blue crew spent more time about their safety record than about operating earnings (or how to improve earnings). Safety is important, but I would like to hear a plan to increase shareholder value this time. It's time to hold the crew accountable."
"I’m getting tired of the wait. It’s time for some type of shareholder activism. Someone needs to take a significant stake in D and show the current management team how to develop the right short and long term strategies and run this lack luster utility. If someone desires a less aggressive approach, I see it as an opportunity for BRK. Thoughts?"
"As a retiree living off, what up tp now has been a steady appreciation in share price and dividend I can say this might be good (someday) for the company, but I’m not going to live long enough to see it."
Dominion Energy goes x-divy on Dec.6 at $0.835 per share ... payable on Dec 20.
I have no idea why a few tree huggers are allowed to delay important infrastructure projects. Abundant clean burning natural gas is critical to the growth in The SouthEast.

Insider buying at Duke and Dominion. :-)
"Shareholder rebellionFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to navigationJump to searchShareholder rebellion occurs when the owners of a corporation work to throw out management or oppose their decisions. Shareholder rebellion may occur at an annual general meeting or through a proxy battle. Shareholders may also threaten to collapse a firm's stock price through concentrated selling.[1] In 1998, the Rockefeller family led a shareholder revolt against Exxon over its climate change policy.[2] In 2005, Michael Eisner retired after Walt Disney's nephew, Roy Disney, led a shareholder revolt, claiming Eisner was a micromanager who had caused a creative brain drain.[3] In 2010, British Petroleum[4] and Shell faced a shareholder revolt over their Canadian tar sands policy.[5]Recently, shareholder rebellions have occurred over the issue of executive compensation at Cable and Wireless[6] and Shell;[7] Shell in response unveiled a plan to curb executive compensation and bonuses.[8] According to some analysts, institutional shareholders have been lax about holding management accountable because they were concentrating on picking correct stocks rather than protecting their interests in the stocks they owned.[9]Shareholder revolts are becoming more common, with a record number of advisory “Say on Pay” votes in the US failing to win majority support in 2018.[10]"
"Proxy is out; time to consider carefully, and vote accordingly. If you are not happy with the performance and decisions of the last 5 years, 33% reduction in dividend, and 17% decrease from last year's high..... then send a message. This is a good company; we need to get the leadership to re-focus on the shareholders."
"Good news: just saw this. Please vote - no confidence -.RICHMOND, Va., Feb. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE: D), will hold its annual meeting of shareholders on Wednesday, May 5, 2021, at 9:30 a.m. ET. Details of the annual meeting will be included in the proxy statement delivered to shareholders in late March."
Just continue to pay the dividend and I’ll be happy. My kids can cash in the stock after I am gone.
I agree with some other post. 1/3 of my stock portfolio is Dominion. After watching the rest of my stocks I am very thankful.
I added 600 D today. Nothing but rising interest rate panic all day long.....but D up. I think this has bottomed. 10% Dividend increases sounds very good to me.
"I recently added D to my portfolio at a higher price. Today I had the opportunity to add more shares at a bargain price . I lost a couple of bucks on my initial buy, but D will spring back . It doesn't need Scana, it's strong without it. Lucky me. "
The next likely step that's probably in process is a significant rate increase for Dominion Energy customers. It's a no lose situation for corporate executives and top management.
What I’d like to know is why did the CEO basically give away these assets to Buffett. He could have gotten more money for these assets...
Cove Point has now become operational. This will help greatly. Dominion’s natural gas business is undervalued. Gas is the future.
moving back up
These prices are great for us dividend re investors
Signs of Life.....D has a pulse!
"BTW, no one mentioned the 11.6 mil shares of D traded yesterday, vs. the 3 mo. avg of the normal 3.8 mil traded per day. You're welcome in advance :~)"
"Posting, and not affiliated w/any hedge fund..so why no posts?? guess it's only for those shorts!"
Put in an order at $70.00.
"Right now it is all a big game of chicken. The politicians don't want to be seen to be caving in to Dominion's offer, BUT the alternative could be far worse. Dominion made a very clever play here; if the deal doesn't go through they will have a relatively small charge MAYBE. But if the deal goes through they will get a subsidized service for decades PLUS the option of completing the nuke plant without any of the startup costs. If you are long the stock here my opinion is to realize the ride might be a bit bumpy right now but the rewards will be great on the other side."
where is stacks...... i need some reassurance herei'm going to buy this stock when it levels off... add to my $65 basein the mean time i lost bigley..... oh well it is all paper unless you sell
"Per investment group AAII August 13th: Dominion Energy Inc Stock: Bottom LineOverall, Dominion Energy Inc stock has a Momentum Grade of F, Estimate Revisions Grade of D and Quality Grade of B.Whether this is a good investment depends on your goals and risk tolerance. AAII can help you figure out both and identify which investments align with what works best for you.When will the ""Blue Crew"" return to their fiduciary responsibility of increasing shareholder value?"
"Being retired, the div reduction has a big effect on my income. I'm strongly thinking about liquidating my position and putting the proceeds into CVX and ABBV, whose divs were better anyway."
D stock is at bargain basement prices. Scana is a huge opportunity too. Buy both at under 75 and 40
"D is going through some transition but will rebound. This stock will be at 78-80 by year end. With a 5% div yield,,,"
Question how safe is this company?
"Interesting, D's partner in the pipeline project (Duke) is now at $97.00 and did not reduce their dividend. D is at $76.00 and will take six years to recover their dividend payout. If you haven't voted yet for the board members, perhaps you should take this into consideration."
Dominion’s annual dividend will jump to $3.67 per share in March. :-)
"CEO on the CC said:Because of the unique nature of the take or pay contracts with Cove Point, very significant cash flows flowing out of that with the recapture of the capital cost that we would see through drops into the MLP that we would grow the dividend 10% a year in 2018, 2019 and 2020. And then, when we got to 2021, we have to see what the landscape looks like at that time."
D is a great long term investment. Sooner or later you will get your money back on the stock and you can earn more than 4% in dividends while you wait. Great run company so I do not see dividend ever being cut.
Could be close to 73 today.
JPM has an article out about utility stocks going up sharply in Japan.......saying its foreshadowing for the US market. :-)
So if Dominion sold 25% of cove point to Brookfield in December and another 25% of Cove as part of the Buffet deal just how much do they still own. And how much money did FARRELL and insiders make on th deal as they were the principal shareholders of the subsidiary company.
"Looks like the investment community was not very impressed with the qtrly results or guidance. Again, no mention of shareholder value beyond the matra of 6.5% growth, 6% dividend growth..... all this just to get back to where we were...... I guess D is a bond now."
