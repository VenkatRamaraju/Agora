"Hey, ""board"" i've been posting..where are my posts ??"
Ghost of Dead Farrell fully knee capped this company!
My hope is Duke or nextenergy or progress energy take over Dominion energy. Or even a Merger where the controlling/ Steering compass would not be Dominion. There leadership team has stabbed their widow's in the back with the dividend cuts.
"As a long term and considerate investor in big D, I have taken a position in a company ATAI that perhaps will benefit the Blue Crew....... or myself if I continue to witness their shareholder interest."

"The Blue Crew at work........... would be interesting to know ""the whole story"".By Associated Press|Oct. 19, 2021, at 10:57 a.m.U.S. News & World ReportCEO: Dominion Wants Money Back From Anti-Youngkin PACRICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Dominion Energy’s CEO said the company's political action committee didn’t properly vet an anti-Glenn Youngkin PAC before giving it large donations, and Dominion wants its money back.Dominion has a long history of transparent and bipartisan political giving, but news stories highlighted activities of the Accountability Virginia PAC that they wouldn’t knowingly support, CEO Bob Blue said in an email to employees Monday."
I will buy under $72
"Just to post again: ""When will the ""Blue Crew"" return to their fiduciary responsibility of increasing shareholder value?"""
"So the infrastructure plan helps Dominion, anybody think we hit 80s next week?"
Get a 5% divi MPW just raised guidance. 22 mil shares short just got whipsawed when co raised guidance. Ex divi 9/15
Looks like the shorts are covering..guess it's good news@!!
Does anyone out there know if D is going to mandate COVID vaccines? Any spike in cases at one of the power stations could cause a disruption of services.
is it true D owns a LNG terminal on east coast???If so should be moving up like Chienre Energy?
Ghost of Dead Farrell still haunting this stock!!!
Why the run up today
"Ghost of Dead Farrell, the gift that keeps giving…… I mean taking, share price!"
"Given the board of directors we have, the CEO and his legacy team, their inability or more likely their lack of interest in the shareholders of D...... I have lost hope of this company to provide a return on investment more than barely average. This ""team"" never speaks of any plans or strategy to increase shareholder value. Yes, they give a courtesy mention of 6% growth / 6% increase in dividend per year for 5 years. This is nothing more than a forecast and the share growth value story is already lagging that vision. We have an average board and average CEO which results in average results. Unless the investment community decides to become actively engaged in this company...... there are much better places to invest."
"Offshore windfarm energy construction is due for completion in 2026. Their construction of the windfarm equipment servicing vessel is due online by 2023. It will be Jones Act compliant and be US flagged. Short term traders could care less, but long term holders should profit dramatically over time."
"I encourage every stakeholder to attend. Dominion Energy (NYSE: D) will host its third-quarter 2021 earnings call at 10 a.m. ET on Friday, Nov. 5, 2021. Management will discuss matters of interest to financial and other stakeholders including recent financial results. At the last earnings call, the blue crew spent more time about their safety record than about operating earnings (or how to improve earnings). Safety is important, but I would like to hear a plan to increase shareholder value this time. It's time to hold the crew accountable."
"Will D still increase the dividend even though the stock price continues to erode? Maybe things will change, but kind of puts a hole in the promised 10% return (6% dividend increase / 6% share appreciation). I for one hope the leadership's commitment is valid, if not, they should be voted out."
"Pre Market, losing half of what we gained yesterday.. so Sad.."
When will this stock ever go up
Can't believe this price is as high as it is. Stock is living in the past.
Why would anyone buy this? Five years of doing nothing.
"Think is was a good sale.....up after hours.w/w all you ""shorts"" dumping....not a trader...we'll see how they interpret this news..."
Holding my shares strong for John Kerry 
Solar project 27 miles out at sea. This is a huge undertaking with a current 9 billion dollar price tag. But those with wisdom know that that figure has the potential to be double. I hope the leadership team remembers the pitfalls of (Scana) before any financia balance sheet distress. I really see a future Merger on the horizon with a bigger utility.
"Posting, and not affiliated w/any hedge fund..so why no posts?? guess it's only for those shorts!"
A Blue Crew indicator will be 3Q reporting of EPS earnings growth / direction. If D reports a decline after a 3B dollar share retirement then there is something very wrong with management. The buyback alone should show (non-organic) growth in pershare earnings..... It will be interesting and telling about this bunch.
Will buy under $72
"""Blue Crew"", are you paying any attention?Dominion Energy Inc. (NYSE:D) was in 34 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of June. The all time high for this statistic is 47. D shareholders have witnessed a decrease in support from the world's most elite money managers in recent months. There were 39 hedge funds in our database with D holdings at the end of March. Our calculations also showed that D isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q2 rankings"
Done nothing since 2017. What's to like??
Payday today thanks big D
Waiting for 71.09
NEE is a better company and may buy all the smaller companies in the next 50 years.
"Dominion drops $200,000 into a fake political group and the stock goes up 3%.. go figure"
"I don't mind making money on an investment but not this wayDominion Energy Gave $200k to Secretive PAC Attacking Youngkin from the RightPatrick Wilson Oct 16, 2021 36Big-league political influencer Dominion Energy donated $200,000 to a secretive PAC attacking GOP gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin, a new filing shows.The money from Dominion’s PAC went to Accountability Virginia PAC in Washington, according to a public filing this weekend by Dominion with the Virginia Department of Elections.The political news outlet Axios reported in late September that the Accountability Virginia operation has ties to Democratic activists and is funding an ad campaign in which the Democrats pose as conservatives “to drive a wedge between the Republican candidate for Virginia governor and his core voters.”The ads on Facebook, Instagram, Google and Snapchat target rural areas of the state that support Youngkin, and the ads question his commitment to the Second Amendment, Axios reported.Dominion gave $200,000 between July and September to the PAC running the ads.Youngkin’s campaign said Democrats are desperate.“Forty year politician Terry McAuliffe and the Democratic party are running scared, so they’ve done what all politicians do — call in their special interest cronies to dump obscene amounts of money into shadowy organizations in order to protect their entrenched interests,” Youngkin spokeswoman Macaulay Porter said by email for this story. “Glenn Youngkin is winning on his message of being an outsider running against politics as usual, so it’s no surprise that desperation has set in for the ruling-class that sees their power slipping away.”Dominion spokesman Rayhan Daudani said by email: “There is nothing secretive about any of our company’s political donations. They are disclosed monthly on the company website. We give in a bipartisan, transparent manner as our voluntary disclosures demonstrate and will continue to do so.”He declined to answer why the company preferred McAuliffe over Youngkin in the Executive Mansion. The election is Nov. 2, and early voting is ongoing.Dominion this summer took an active role in the race for attorney general, injecting $200,000 into a political operation that was helping run Democratic Attorney General Mark Herring’s primary campaign against challenger Del. Jay Jones, D-Norfolk. Herring faces Del. Jason Miyares, R-Virginia Beach, in the general election.Dominion also gave $100,000 this summer to Hala Ayala, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, who had previously promised not to take campaign money from the regulated utility. That was followed by more donations from Dominion to Ayala.Winsome Sears, the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor, has attacked Ayala for a vote that will raise electric bills and for flipping on her promise.Dominion’s involvement in the election comes as the utility is fighting efforts before the Virginia State Corporation Commission to order customer refunds and an electric rate cut following a finding by SCC staff that the monopoly utility earned more than $1.1 billion above a fair profit over four years.Critics of Dominion say the regulated monopoly’s excess earnings were allowed by friendly laws approved by lawmakers who are heavy recipients of Dominion’s campaign money.Reporting by the Richmond Times-Dispatch and ProPublica in 2020 showed how Dominion exerted influence in the General Assembly session on a clean energy law called the Clean Economy Act. Youngkin has been critical of the new law, which aims to transition Virginia away from fossil fuels for electricity production by 2050, while McAuliffe supports it. State regulators estimate the law and other legislative actions will lead to large increases in customer electric bills."
What is wrong with the utility sector here lately? a lot more negative days than positive days
