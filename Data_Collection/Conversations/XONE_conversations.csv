YES!!!! Unlike DM we actually have production printers. DM is four years and a lot of hype late. Cool animations at the DM site and a lot of PR hype will not make up for slow 2015 2.0 technology. XONE has the goods. DM sent for their P-1 production printers this week. They print at 1/4 the speed of the newXONE X1-25 pro. Ford will not be happy. https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3759044867468194&substory_index=0&id=344398878932827
This can very easily do what DDD did. This is very undervalued. Need some good news and we will see $20 very soon.
i sold all my bngo shares and bought xone. why? because xone is backed with real revenue and many institutions. the future of 3d printing is now.
heading back to 50...more big announcements coming soon. market will be on steroids once this infrastructure bill passes one way or another. 2 for 1 split once it hits 80
ExOne and Ford have qualified aluminum for printing. That’s the words I have been waiting for. Ford was a pipe investor with DM. But now we see Ford has been ACTUALLY working with XONE. DM CEO has made a lot of promises his machines aren’t able to keep. XONE has the printers manufactures want. And Ford knows it.
I find it laughable xone is not trading above $20/share. Fairly low float...one decent press release and this will be up 50% in this current momentum driven market.
"OH YEAH!https://finance.yahoo.com/news/four-companies-offering-3d-metal-123000688.htmlInternational Data Corporation (IDC) today published an IDC Innovators report profiling four companies in the 3D metal printing market. IDC Innovators are companies that have introduced innovative new technologies or groundbreaking business models. The four companies are Desktop Metal, ExOne, Rapidia, and Velo3D.Key trends, such as manufacturers seeking manufacturing flexibility, supply chain efficiency, light-weighting, and part consolidation are making the 3D Metal printer market one of the fastest-growing segments of the 3D printing business. From the supply side, new 3D metal printing technologies are reducing costs while providing significantly greater quality and production speeds than have been available in the past.""The 3D metal printing market is seeing dynamic growth, and a key part of that growth is the development of new technologies and materials. These new products are creating new capabilities that enable a wider set of manufacturers to adopt 3D metal printing,"" said Tim Greene, research director, 3D Printing. ""But it's not just adoption, the lower costs, better quality, and faster production are also allowing wider utilization within the companies that use 3D metal printers, up to and including the production of end-use parts."""
"Ark Invest just sold off all their Xone stock. Ark Invest is all into disruptive technology, much including additive manufacturing. I believe Ark Invest sees the writing on the wall with Xone due to Desktop Metal's recent SPAC through TRNE. Check out TRNE. Their metal and carbon printers are much more superior to Xone. Desktop Metal also has designed their printers for ""throughput"" and mass manufacturing. They are the true next generation additive manufacturer for metal printing. Ark is just waiting to see if Desktop Metal's valuation will lower. So far it's selling for 8% over what the big investors like Chamath Palihapitiya paid. I'm long on TRNE (soon to be DM after the SPAC reverse merger completes). Jump on board if you like!!!!"
"Quite the bloodbath today....XONE doen 8%, SSYS down 4%, and DDD down 3%. I figured XONE was overbought at $16. I'll be watching for a possible re-entry point, but I bought some SYSS today."
Resumption showing 23.09!
I do not what to do...any advice?
"Like if you've never actually used a 3D printer? The idea of 3d printers seeming like a good idea in 2014.. a little better in 2021.. and will be perfect in 2028! I plan to invest in XONE then, as well as the Star Trek Holodeck and Mars flights. To the Moon (not the stock, me)."
"Full disclosure here: I’m taking a bath on this one, as I’m in 1500 shares an average of $35 per share. It’s my own fault, though; I know I shouldn’t have such a large stake in one company. Anyways, I’m thinking this is good news, because obviously XONE management didn’t have confidence in their own company, and you might as well get what you can, right? And hopefully I’ll be wiser on the next one."
ARK mentions XONE is much undervalued compared to Desktop Metal which is going to be IPO.https://ark-invest.com/newsletter/issue-237/
"agreement to purchase at $25.50, why the discount? is it covering the risk of acquisition not going through?"
"Hello. Can someone explain ? I had shares of XONE in the past and have lost money. I sold at $4 last year and just kept a handful of shares that I sold recently at $18. I remember when it was at $4 that one analyst said this stock does not worth more. I know last earnings have been good, but what's the reason of the current growth in market cap? I see the stock climbing to 20, 30, 40, 50... some regret of course (hopefully I did a good usage of the money on other stocks), but just would like to understand the rationale, if there is. Of course I am confident in the 3D printing market. The analyst was wrong, and that is ok. But between 4 and 51... ? Thank you."
I'm jumping in. Growth potential here is massive. Initiated a position. will add more.. Anyone here think I've made a mistake?
Just went and read everything on XONE's website and listened to the recent conference call. The technology seems to have interesting applications different from other 3D printing companies. I already own a decent number of shares (at a loss) but I've been trying to buy more under $7 to average down in anticipation of a good ER.
"This stock will go flat till Q4, so at least we have time to decide if we sell or take the deal."
Hey where are capitulation Chris and chris?Well none yet but that 200 EMA is at 21.37 and the 50 Week EMA at 19.86.It looks like after that the door is open for the 200 week EMA at 13.99.I’m just sharing. Who knows where a bottom is.Peace.
Let's see this reverse and rebound big today! We have seen the opposite way too much lately.
I'll never trust anyone again
"Desktop Metal, Inc. ( DM Loading...Loading...) (“Desktop Metal”) and The ExOne Company ( XONE Loading...Loading...) (“ExOne”) announced today they have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Desktop Metal ( DM ) will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of ExOne ( XONE ) common stock. Under the terms of the agreement, ExOne ( XONE ) shareholders will receive $8.50 in cash and $17.00 in shares of Desktop Metal ( DM Loading...Loading...) common stock for each share of ExOne ( XONE Loading...Loading...) common stock, for a total consideration of $25.50 per share, representing a transaction value of $575 million, subject to a collar mechanism as described below and implying a 47.6% premium to the closing price of ExOne’s common stock on August 11, 2021 and a 43.9% premium based on the 30-day average closing price of ExOne ( XONE Loading...Loading...) common stock. The transaction value also implies an acquisition multiple of 6.4x 2021 consensus revenue estimates for ExOne"
"Just me, but I am going to sell this profit tomorrow and wait to see what the fallout is."
Forbes article says 3d printing is like investing in Apple in 2002. I hope so long 12k
"Thevictor and Lazerator, you two still bashing DM between yourselves ? I suspect, at least in victor's case given the vitriol of his posts, that it's personal (maybe he used to work for DM and got fired?). Instead of being bitter, you should be happy that the excitement surrounding DM, NNDM, etc., has caused all companies in the space, including xone, to rise. And make no mistake, should DM collapse, it will drag xone and others down with it. I think, however, that victor would be happy in that scenario so long as DM fell farther than xone (even 80% vs 79%, for example). My friends, move on and find peace -- you'll lead a more joyful life. And query me this: if DM is going to collapse, why has ARK bought over 500k shares in DM in the last few weeks (at current and higher prices)?; why would the owner(s) of EnvisionTec (the original inventor of DLP 3D printing technology, and a company that has one of the strongest IP portfolios in the space and over 5,000 customers across a broad range of industries, including medical devices, aerospace, and biofabrication) want half of the buyout price in DM shares if they were not confident of DM's future (on the call, DM's CEO said EnvisionTec were offered more cash upfront but they wanted more shares instead)?; why would the 4 analysts noted on CNN Financial have price forecasts for DM of between 23-30, median 26.50 (and note xone by comparison: The 5 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for ExOne Co have a median target of 18.00, with a high estimate of 29.00 and a low estimate of 10.50)?; do you really think that Chamath and JB Straubel, the co-founder of Tesla, would have invested in DM through the PIPE if they didn't believe in the company?; and finally, do you really believe that the MIT professors (I'll repeat ""MIT professors"") that found DM are not at the forefront of 3D printing technology? Well, I think you know the answers to all these questions, and indeed, based on what I've written, I think many xone shareholders might think of selling some of their xone and buying some DM! :) But I'm not bashing xone; let's all be happy and hope that ARK's recent prediction about the 3D printing space (60% CAGR over the next 5 years, and 120 billion by 2025 from 12 billion today!) turns out to be accurate. If so, I'm confident that all retail shareholders in xone and DM will make tons of money. Let's hope for that instead of bashing. GLTA!"
Plenty of newshttps://www.thefabricator.com/additivereport/news/additive/exone-launches-sand-3d-printing-network
"recently I can see some better ratings for xone, so let's roll it over $13 then!""Shares of ExOne Co (NASDAQ:XONE) have received an average recommendation of “Buy” from the six ratings firms that are currently covering the stock, Marketbeat reports. The average twelve-month price target among brokerages that have covered the stock in the last year is $13.67."""
"Yesterday, my brokerage company asked me to loan them shares to short. I declined as they were only offering a 3% rate. Still, the departure of the CEO the next day is making me wonder. I'm hoping the technology is good but the execution has been lousy. Maybe having Rockwell in house and in charge will help."
Whenever you try to get catch a falling knife expect to get burned.I'm buying here because XONE has long term solid support around 10.Add in the 100M or so (about 6 dollars a share) of cash they added back in Feb (about 150M in cash now vs 50M then ........or around 40% of their market cap) and you're right around that level.Probably go lower still....but I think it's getting near the bottom.
A parabolic frenzy fueled by several well timed press releases followed by equally well timed secondary offering. I don't believe in coincidences.
"There's more and more articles coming out warning that climate change will disrupt industry at ""unprecedented rate"". Additive manufacturing is gonna explode and xone is the clear leader (and undervalued to it's closest competitors). $90/share is coming soon....https://finance.yahoo.com/video/climate-change-cause-industry-disruptions-120000809.html"
If I bought this stock over $30 I would join any lawsuit there is
"When does the deal with DM finalize , and this gets delisted ?"
Not many posts here but this “new” environment is very positive for XONE. Growth has been good and will continue with more profitability. I’ve been a discouraged long for years but now see some serious light in the tunnel!
"I’ve been day trading for years and I’m so glad I finally found (http://Rightpicker.com). They’re pre-market watchlists cover all the latest market-moving news, and they don’t beat you down with tons of ads. Highly recommend!"
I believe XONE has the ability to jump $50 a share in a single day. Just look at what you are seeing in terms of 4.0 Siemens Mindsphere and the autonomous shuttle. This is being funded by I believe Ford. They need lights out 24/7 printing volume. And when they order it will be 10-20 or even a hundred printers. All told they will in 10 years have as many as thousands of the X1-160 pro printers. Running around the clock.
"I suggest taking profits across the 3D Printing (Additive Mfg.) space before these companies report earnings. Fundamentals may have improved, but I do not expect they will live up to the exponential moves these stocks have had in the last month."
I keep adding it’s going up everyday. The price targets seem old on this stock. What price do some of you guys see this hitting as we go through 2021 thanks
What's with the huge drop after hours ?
"We’ve all seen it this year, a stock beats earnings, revenue, guidance is great & stock goes down versus a stock misses earnings, misses revenue & guidance is just okay, but stock goes up due to possible future growth. ER plays haven’t been logical at all this year. As for value... well even there are a lot of undervalued equities out there that have either traded sideways the past year or down & overvalued have skyrocketed.... so it’s all a crapshoot lately. I was in at $19 & I still will see what this week brings. It won’t be a gap fill from $10. It will be between from $15."
"3 significant takeovers in the additive space in the last 2 weeks, so I suspect xone is also either being bought or is buying (or at least that's what investors are betting on). We'll see."
"DDD +20%, pulling the entire 3d printing sector. Time to load up."
"I bought at $45 long time ago, although not much, seems like will never recover "
"If I'm going to get $25.50 in 6 months, why wouldn't I take $25.10 today and call it a done deal?"
"Up 9.30% this morning, now negative 6%, all in a single day, after a seemingly great earnings report. I am in total disbelief."
Good so far. Let's see if we can build momentum and have a strong close boosted by short covering and ARK buying.
You're losing 5% gain selling at $24.25
"ARK is scared of something and sells XONE every day, but it’s still the largest position in 3D printing ETF"
hopefully we see 60 next week
"Does it make sense to take profits here. Short term back down to the $20s who knows. No cracks in the overall 3D realm. Xone still seems to be the underrated undervalued potential wise , market cap wise gem. Don't mess with Kent Rockwell. Boom"
will there be more buying tomorrow? public offering to go on sale $54. anyone care to explain? does that mean stock price will go down ?
"If you sell here it is a mistake and shortsighted. Earnings is two days from now. Best case scenario for another 20% increase after earnings: They already preannounced a beat, but maybe they downplayed it and will beat even more and up the forecast based on how well received the new X1 160 Pro. Record backlog and 20% y/y projected revenue growth and with first quarterly profit in q3. That would justify a nice run."
Secondary offering was $54. All these sellers probably bought < $10. ARK didn't sell any yesterday. It will be interesting to see if they add more today.
Dm is buying them... $8.5 in cash and $17 in DM stock for a purchase price of $25
I am gonna say it. I am not selling 300 shares of this one until it reaches +90 USD or 150USD. Who knows?
"i've been left holding the bag since my 31$ average buying price, months ago... and all i read about this company is a 1.6 mil contrat with the DoD. WTH...? is this the 3D printing revolution!?"
Why this isn't moving today? What's going on here?
"I have not done my DD but just finish reading the acquisition News.""ExOne shareholders will receive $8.50 in cash and $17.00 in shares of Desktop Metal common stock for each share of ExOne common stock, for a total consideration of $25.50 per share,""It seems to me this is an arbitrage opportunity given that the current price of ExOne is still $17.38 which is lower than $25.50. Have I missed something here?Of course, this is given that the stock price movement relatively small and cannot be massively controlled by either DM or ExOne to push price of ExOne up until the acquitision is completed.There is also a investigation news for Merger Investigation from law firm Halper-Sadh-LLP.This Law firm probably does that to push the price of ExOne down so those who pay them could get it cheaper ??."
"$SSYS I'm guessing that today's sharp stock rise (on a day when $DDD is down), has to do with the $DM purchase of $XONE . Earlier this year when Stratasys announced they were dropping their metal printer to focus on polymers, I was disappointed, as they had spent millions on development, only to jettison it before it was even released. I thought it might in reality be because $DM told them they didn't want the competition. $DM of course has been sharing the $SSYS reseller network for some years: Stratasys was concerned they might start losing some of their exclusive network because they had no metal printer for the network to offer to complement their polymer printers. Now I wonder if this new $DM deal hasn't been known by $SSYS for some time, and THAT'S why they dropped their metal printer. We now have a powerful, broad spectrum metal company linked to an equally powrful, broad spectrum polymer company (of course Stratasys was an early investor in DM also). An eventual formal combining of the two companies? I have no idea of the underlying practicality/desirability of that, but at least their present partnership is very promising. They should be making some noise."
Markforged is going public via spac (AONE). They will be valued at over $2b. They are not BJT like XONE but they do metal. 2020 revenue of $70M and forecasting $700M in 2025. XONE is in a better position to capitalize on high volume metal production than any company imo and is valued at less than half of Markforged and 1/5 of DM! Wake up folks! This doesn't quadruple and then just retreat back to obscurity. ARK doesn't have this as a top holding for no reason. We base here for a few weeks and then take the next leg higher after earnings!
The DM/XONE buyout makes an attractive combination. The worst XONE shareholders could do is get 1.7 DM shares and $8 cash. If DM goes back to $20 on the increased revenue and synergies in the coming months you’re looking at $42 per XONE share.
Congrats to XONE shareholders. Nice jump. Welcome to DesktopMetal!!
We are just above the 50 dma and just below the 200 dma and the general market has stabilized near ATH. The worse is over in IMO and we start to see a breakout from this 6 week trading range. If you wait for the golden cross to be confirmed you will already have missed a 20% return. I believe we see 30 by end of June. Good luck all.
"I did have a few 40 shares of XONE since 2014 bought at $39. In 2020 I added 4000 around $7.5. Being desparate, I sold at the very bottom ($4.31) when reading one bad analyst comments saying the shares are going nowhere. After the spike to $54 and pullback, I bought 6000 shares with an average of $17.3 in July, and 1000 more yesterday at $17.37. So it could have been better if I kept my 4000 shares from last year, but finally a good story with a few false starts."
When does the deal with DeskktopMetal happen?
XONE is up 41.16% to 24.39
Bullish engulfing pattern. Is this the start of the uptrend?
"Combining DM and XONE is a very positive move for both companies. I think DM got the better part of the deal (I hold both DM and XONE shares), but overall everyone wins with this transaction."
"To clarify the confusion: if you have hundred shares of Xone you will receive $850 cash and 1,700 that will be converted to desktop metal shares so that is approximately 180 shares as today's desktop metal value. What is not yet clear is conversion will occur all I read is that it is 4th quarter so until then I think you still own whatever you own in Xone"
XONE shares on sale today. Courtesy of panic sellers. I will buy more. I don't mind at all. Thank you. Good luck all.
"I own 16,500 shares of the 3D printing leader who is patenting aluminum printing with Ford Motor Company big that doesn’t resonate with you then you aren’t smart enough to have enough money to invest."
No matter what the share price is for DM we still get $25.5

"3D sector down, market up. Doesn't make sense. Buying more...."
Oh wait...DM is buying XONE ?....Have both of XONE and DM....What will be happen my shares of XONE ?
"Why is $XONE down today? It's because DM is down. It's simple math....if the buyout happened today you'd get 2.1 shares of DM plus $8.50 cash, or $23.57. It's selling at a discount to that because of the uncertainty of the merger."
Nice deal with Ford. Let's see what that means for sales. A bigger loss than expected just means we get to buy again in the lows 30's. I think we open down and close up tomorrow if market is green.
Wasted time energy and money on this average price over 26
"Pricing its underwritten public offering of 1.67M shares at $54/share; underwriters granted 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 205,907 shares. Dilution but now flush with cash. Let's see how the market views the strong financial position."
I voted no!
"Xone's facilities remain open under government order - ""This crisis demonstrates the critical role 3D printing should play in de-risking supply chains and enabling a distributed manufacturing strategy, closer to the point of use,"" Hartner said. ""During these challenging times, we remain strongly encouraged by high interest in 3D printing, a record backlog, and sufficient liquidity and discipline to carry us through this crisis."""
Ya not going wait 6 months for the 25.50 I take 25 and move on lol
I posted this past weekend that xone should hit the $60 range by mid-March. I now think xone will hit $60 today!
"Wow I regretted selling my shares at 16 after many many years but sorry, seems like this will go further if any bad news erupts. GLTA"
It would be interesting to know when DeskTop first approached Exone re the merger. If they approached Exone prior to the February stock offering at $54 a share then they have some explaining to do. I remember reading some speculation about a merger some time ago but it was probably just speculation.
"This is all of the additive manufacturing stocks. Most are well run companies with advantages and disadvantages over the others (at least what is being reported). Compare the charts of just about any AM stock and pretty similar patterns.They all took off in December, just as many stocks did at the end of last year. They are finding their ground now as I feel many other stocks will as well. I assume they will eventually fall around the same prices that they were in Sep-Dec, slightly higher to that level to adjust for growth/inflation. I would think XONE will be around $16~$17 when the dust settles with highs a bit more and lows a bit less to follow news and investor interest trends. Obviously, good news and bad news will help move either way. I have positions in XONE, DM and VJET, since I am a believer in the technology eventually rewarding my initial investments. Research has me at those three, but was a coin flip with others in the industry. Many good competitors in this industry, run by some very bright people with great ambition. Following the same logic of the Sep-Dec figures with some added value for growth/inflation, I think DM will settle in the $11-$12 range. I think VJET will be in that same $11-$12 range. A few of these companies should take off in 3-4 years. It will likely be a roller coaster ride until then. Possibly a few unexplained climbs like each took in Dec-Mar and a few dips that are likely more than they should be. I don't think any are particularly good short term investments unless they drop significantly below those numbers. Long term, I think most will be good investments (why I have split between three). Hopefully all three take off next week like some want to believe, but I think we know it won't happen. If it does, it isn't going to be like January. Right now, these are three of the most volatile stocks that I own."
you all ready for a delta scare of the markets Monday morning...the birth of the new 3D run is beginning
"This is institutional and market maker manipulation at it's best. The bond yields and pumped up valuations are an excuse to punish retail investors. They pushed this up to 50+ then dumped the shares to a new generation of bag holders. Watch 3800 on the S&P for support. If we break that, we are in trouble."
"When it goes up 4 to 5 percent, it drops instantly. Manipulation at the highest level"
"Something's brewing. Yes they knocked it down eod today but that's common with this stock. Heavy volume again, like volume this stock has never seen before the past 2 days. This is not some stock guru's recommendation causing this massive volume. Either big institutional buying due to the tech craze of late or rumors of a buyout is all I can think of. Either way be surprised if this doesn't continue to run into the $14 range this week...Robinhood newbies will be catching on to this tomorrow"
ARK has bought over 1m share this year so far for its 3D printing ETF. It's more than a coincidence of the price rally to $60. Keep buying low and hold long!
"XONE will recover, their services have been up, well, the machine part is down this quarter, as Rockwell stated ""our recognition of machine revenue was unfavorably impacted by timing of installation and customer acceptance of our printers"", so in other words it is a timing issue typical (or seasonal) for this company....I hold for now, however anywhere below 6 bucks would be a steal at this point,my prediction: $10 by Xmas"
"Institutional just bought over 100 million stock offering @$54 a share in February 2021, down 40% just in 1 month, retail investors should be happy to buy at this huge discount"

"Incoming Earnings will not matter much . It is the GUIDANCE that will determine the direction of the Stock price . 3D Printing Industry is set to explode upwards by 10 fold in the next 5 years , and more in the next 10 ."
Huge miss on the top and bottom line. $13M/-.29 vs 14.3M/-.21.It was a mistake buying this back where I did at $33 ish after selling at $64.5 ish. That $54 offering really suckered me.Their guidance is still projected at 15%-25% but to even justify this price it’s got to be 25% IMHO which would only get them to about $75M for the year. It’s great the backlog is increasing but if it isn’t being worked off?I just took a cursory look so we’ll see how the call goes and how it acts.Peace.
"When Exone issued the new shares six months ago, they forgot to include in the risk factors that management might decide to sell the company for 50% of the offering price.....minor oversight."
Just wait til DM collapses. Their new P-1 production printer runs a spj head. So this print method the market says is worth a market cap of $5b. It prints the same MIM powders as the X1-25pro. The DM P-1 prints at 1300CC per hour. The XONE C1-25 pro prints at 3600Cc volume per hour. So if DM SPJ is deemed worth $5b then the XONE technology is 3 times faster. So the printers XONE makes are three times faster and has 1/10 the market cap. Figure it out. XONE can run for years.
Per cc sold 17 machines in Q3 expect double in Q4. That’s 47 machines in 6 months. 25% of all machines sold were sold in the last 6 mo. That is proof of accelerating adoption. New MIM printers will be a huge addition to sales and profits. Long 13k
Tremendous rise over the past few weeks. 10+ and no signs of slowing down.
"I sold $25.11x 1000 of XONE and bought $DM $8.30x 2000..Thinking of buying more $DM..DM+XONE combined around $400+ BILLION Revenue next 12 months, if you take into account their Growth (DM growing at 2340%, XONE Growing at 110%. Sone mixed up. But that's a high growth, imagine $400Bn Revenue in pocket already next 12 months.. If that's the case, $$DM UNDERVALUED comparing to other 3D Printing stocks).. I watched this YOUTUBE explaining $$DM is better positioned due to choosing 'Binder Jetting method of printing as opposed to other choices..""Any opinions, advice appreciated Thanks in advance"

Desktop Metal claims they are the binderjet leader. But with $16m in annual sales of all 3 of printing systems available for purchase we are seeing a different story. Ford and ExOne recently announced qualification and patent application for aluminum 6061. Let’s dive deeper on this fact. DM received $66m in PIPE funding from Ford. So somewhere between that investment and 2019 the relationship soured. And Ford began working with ExOne on aluminum. This partnership was obviously fruitful. Ford uses millions of tons of aluminum. From how fortuitous on the same day DM and XONE announce aluminum printing. Big difference in the announcements though. DM said they are going to begin to qualify aluminum. Ford and ExOne HAVE QUALIFIED and are filing for a patent. This process took two years. So Ford and ExOne are two years ahead of DM in this process. And when they get the patent that will put DM and a lot of other 3D binderjet printer makers in a pickle. This announcement is huge for XONE. Ford needs millions and millions of aluminum parts a year. This will mean Ford will have to buy hundreds and thousands of printers like the new X1-160pro. The first order from Ford will be for dozens and potentially hundreds of machines just to put a dent in the quantity of parts they will print. Not to mention how they will monetize the IP with the other players wanting to print aluminum. This is a multi billion dollar company. The sky is the limit for XONE. In 10 years I predict this will have a $10b market cap and DM will end up just like DMs CEOs last venture A123Systems did. Bankrupt.
"nucera, I do agree that the 15%-25% needs to ramp but I need to listen to the call again as one analyst tried to talk the S curve, i.e. when does growth take off? I don’t believe he got a clear answer probably because the future is hard to predict even for this CEO or even if he thinks he knows he’s guiding through what he hopes to be the end of a pandemic.There was also a question on break even and the CEO stated that they had previously said it was possible at mid $70s. ( which may have been wishful thinking) but what he said was what investors should want to hear, I.e. given their cash levels they will invest more in R&D for the future. Hopefully this pays off at some point in the next few years. Good luck.Peace."
"Haven’t been on here in a while, is everyone done crying about the market correcting itself the last two weeks yet?"
"While XONE currently has a very ugly chart (at least the 3 month one) I'm starting to warm to this company.After taking advantage of the recent spike in share price they raised around 100M dollars at 54 dollars a share...making the balance sheet rock solid with around 150M in cash.So now you have a company trading with a market cap close to 50% of their cash value (which is why I think it's either at or close to it's bottom).The other, and most important positive as it relates to the balance sheet, is while they are losing money it's not very much. Maybe 25M this year and dropping to maybe 10M next year....and turning profitable after that.With a runway that looks like it will last for at least a decade going forward (3D printing is still in it's infancy) that current 25% growth rate will going for a very long time.No clue when this will head north again....just think it's worth holding at anywhere near it's current price.Hard to think you'll get burned much on the downside over the next two years (may tank short term still but odds are it will rebound to at least this level before too long) as long as revenues continue to grow at their current clip."
"We'll see how 3D Systems earning effects XONE. The quote from 3D systems CEO below could be a catalyst.""Our Industrial business growth reflected broad-based wins, particularly in the metals application areas, pointing to increasing demand for our products in markets like aerospace, automotive, and consumer products""."
"Does anyone think there will be a better offer for XONE by, perhaps, DDD?"
"Exone is an important position of 3 of Ark Etfs, being nr 1 holding in Ark 3d printing etf, it seems they are very confident about the company. Xone has definitely a bright future!"
"I've been a huge fan of XONE for years, but that shady two-step move they pulled with the BS earnings pre-release pump only to be followed by the dilution offering dump the next day (after a 50% rise in share price) would make me reluctant to buy any new shares until it settles.I am holding what I have for now (with far OTM covered calls), but sold 1/2 my position through the Jan/Feb spike between 45-60. I'll buy them back if we get under 15, but the management shenanigans raise a red flag."
Big news today! Here come the $8-9 range this week!
Sooo at 40k a day that’s hmmmm 55 days to cover on a company that is affirming 20% sales growth. Going to be fun to watch this cover
"Told you all. This was oversold. If you cost averaged down and put new capital to work, you get rewarded in this market."
ALL IN. Will sell at $40 next month!
Breaking 200 day average. Freefall to $5. Very negative triangle pattern breached.
Why I like Xone and Why is Xone and 3D such an important technology??1. Made in USA2 Secrets of construction can be kept in house. Prototypes are way cheaper3 shipping costs from foreign companies are minimized4. Changes can be made quickly and cheaply5 material strength is impressive and Quality control is much better when done in house
WHAT HAPPENS TO MY 30$ CALLS ??????GOING TO ZERO??
"Anyone else notice that thevictor has not posted here in weeks? He pumped XONE while he was here, but he sold his XONE stock and now he's on the DM board still bashing it with no vested interest. The truth is he bought A123systems stock and he lost his butt on it when it went bankrupt, and the CEO is now the CEO of DM. That's why he hates DM."
"well this piece of cake is dropping since vjet did an offering this week..so what? next dilution expected for XONE..? I doubt that,just added more...below 20 bucks could be a gift here,gl2all"
Well the good news is that 3D systems reports tomorrow and I expect a very very good quarter from them. If that happens it will lift xone as well
Do earnings come out after the bell tomorrow
If you were an institution and knew this was the market leader and most likely to capitalize on the manufacturing of EV vehicles you would want to accumulate as much as possible at these levels before the next big announcement.
God has been good to us longs today.
Confused. Will any new investors who buy the stock now get the $8 and have their shares convented to 2 dm shares? Why would u buy at the higher price now just to get 2 dm shares?
Looks Like Cathie Wood owns more DesktopMetal now!!!
Market will gobble up the 1.6 million shares and keep on going up. As far as I see it it can go to $350 a share to match the hype factory DM market cap.
We should get back over 25 on the heals of DDD strong earnings and anticipation of same blowout from XONE. Need that feisty Nasdaq to cooperate!

"My guess is that in a few weeks, XONE will announce a stock offering of 5 million shares at $55 a shares. That will give them $250 million to fritter away and to pay back Kent Rockwell."
"3D printing companies help mfg to cut time consuming, lower labor cost to compete with low cost producers in Asia, bring back the supply chain to the west, deflation for consumers, it is a must needed for the west"
"When XONE goes down, it goes down fast. I really don't get it but I will just average it down. I am not selling until I make profit here. (My AVG is 44 )"
"Seems like all 3D print companies are doing pretty well... I am so hype!$DDD $PRLB $SSYS $MTLS $NNDM $XONE $DM. That's all I can find,"
Does anyone know when the deal officially closes?
"XONE is the number one holding in ARK's PRNT ETF. I said three weeks ago this can do what DDD has done. I was right and so was Marco, TheVictor and even Benjo. The technology is second to none and valuation compared to other growth tech companies is still undervalued when considering revenue and growth rate of production capable 3d machines like the X1 160 Pro. This can easily go to 50 by June, if the market doesn't tank. I am buying on a pullback. Missed the last one at 23 but will look at 25 as an entry point. Would like to see consolidation between 25 and 35 for a few weeks before going higher. Worried about season selling pressure for taxes. Still have a few thousand shares. chris 21 days agoThis can very easily do what DDD did. This is very undervalued. Need some good news and we will see $20 very soon."
This is the future of metal casting. This technology is not used for making tiny little parts. It is for making large complex metal castings. Printed in inexpensive sand or fine powders for more detail. Much more cost effective than expensive powders and lasers.
xone is gonna run into the end of the year....I believe $14-16 will be the new range in a couple weeks from the $10.50-$12 range it's been hovering the past couple months. Good to see a PR today....they should be more forthcoming about orders etc going forward. DM threat is overrated. Xone holds lots of patents and keeps improving speed and material costs....2021 should be a breakout year
Did DM just say they are buying us or did I hear that wrong?
Marco is 100% spot on. DM tech is DOA 3 of their 4 platforms have been available for over 2 years and sales are less than 1/3 of XONE. Only thing the print is hype. And computer animation of their unicorn production printers. Their P-1 runs at 1/4 the speed of the X1-25pro.
Up 17% on over 4 times normal volume with almost 2 hours to go in trading. I don't see any news. What's up?
Can’t wait for the CC tomorrow. I am excited to hear about the new 160pro and the progress on qualifying aluminum for production. This is the future of metal printing. XONE has the printers. DM has the hype machine.

"EXONE will change the world of metal manufacturing and it's supply chains. They are just beginning to address the EV, industrial and energy markets. For example manufacturing of turbine blades and fuel nozzles is a huge market. Turbines are used for power generation for utilities, universities, institutions and for compressing natural gas through pipelines. There ae tens of thousands of turbines that can benefit from this technology. They all need to be overhauled someday. New turbines will need to run on hydrogen mixed fuels which requires different designs and materials. More reason to 3d print and cut down time to market by having less time in development and iterations.I have seen the potential of this technology first hand. Nothing like it and EXONE is the leader!"
"Great article on 3D printing..XONE is positioned nicely, mid-teens coming this summer.https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/24/3d-printing-in-valley-of-despair-but-may-have-a-catalyst-ark-ceo.html"

"The recent loss of 29 cents was worse than expected, I was predicting no more than 25 cents loss,however, there are some positive things over horizon,- the revenue for Q1_2021 was matching the one from Q1_2020,- increased backlog,- increased cash,- still predicting growth expectations of 15% – 25%,- new printers in development - X1 160Pro,- a significant expansion of the global sales distribution network,- launch of the ExOne Metal Designlab,- growing revenue from services, 15% increase from Q1_2020,- .... (you add it)overall not looking bad, the company is growing, my target - $44,gl2all"
Certainly seems suspicious that they didn't combine the positive earnings pre-annoucement with the stock sale program given they were days apart. Doesn't seem to be a coincidence why they we're released in the order they were.
Xone is better off being alone or team up with 3D than DM
"The whole 3D printing sector seems dead right now. Last year the DM IPO sparked a jump, and that was followed by DDD reporting great earnings. Things have settled back down so what's the next catalyst? Will the next round of earnings spark more interest in the sector again?"
"3d printing is about to be 60b in 2024. If xone hits 22b market cap it will be at $1000 this is an easy couple year multibagger."""
Moment of silence for those who have a avg cost of 30-40 kinda screwed??
"Yesterday, I wrote the reply below, but it seemed to get buried in the thread.""The AM sector is going to have its best year in 2018 due to the global economic expansion. Those w/ a large presence in Asia and Europe adding to their US operations will do particularly well. The next big thing in AM is direct manufacturing en masse while foundry applications that respond to economic growth worldwide should be the very stable high margin business that provides sustained profits in the near term. I'm looking for revenue growth of 35% and Gross margins of 45% for the best performers in the sector,"
The future of the metal printing revolution is XONE. Desktop Metal touts their technology and printers but only have one in beta test. They promised sales of production printers in Q1 2019. They are now 6 quarters late. Can you read between the lines here?? So when they raised capital last year they said it was enough to carry them to profitability. Now they want to IPO the company. Google Rick Fulop and his past at A123 systems. He Went public and cashed out. Left company. Two years later and they were bankrupt. The batteries they touted were not that great. My opinion is there was a lot of hot air and fluff on the specification end there. Fast forward to today. Same CEO Rick Fulop and a promised game changer printer. Only problem is it is 6 quarters and still counting late??? Why?? XONE has the experience and printers that exceed the DM promises ( that have yet to materialize) Not to mention XONE 160 PRO build box is 4 times as big as DM yet to be seen printer. Do your homework on this. I have long 13k
"Averaged down doubling my position, cutting edge tech...good luck longs"
"interesting timing, just before earnings report"
If you know the answer ..please xplain. What will happen with the short position? Is it possible that Exone stock raise more tha$ 25.50?
"Xone market cap 650 million, pro lab, desktop metal, Ddd 2-4 billion market, xone has a lot of catch up to do"
Are you all seeing what is happening with SGLB? This is good for XONE as well. Lockheed Martin is using their quality assurance systems for QC of metal printed parts. Metal printing is the future. IF it wasn't you would not be seeing these types of announcements and such huge moves in the sector. SGLB is an acquisition target for XONE or DM maybe. I have a big position in SGLB and sold some on the news. I would get back in around 5.5 -6. Go XONE!
Can anyone tell me if there has been a shareholder vote on the merger? I don't recall voting but maybe I did. I get a lot of proxies and vote most of them.
expected to beat matket estimates on financial report. hope it translate to higher stock prices

"Let’s see if the upcoming band holds or if it keeps dropping.Long term 76.4% pullback = 21.31, 200EMA= 21.16, 50 week EMA = 19.65, short term 76.4% pullback = 18.40.If none of those provides support it probably goes below $15. 200 Week EMA = 13.82Good luck.Peace."
"I think almost all lawsuits by these class action law firms are a bunch of baloney. That being said, Exone probably will have to do some explaining as to why they thought their shares were worth $54 a share when they issued new shares in February and now after announcing record earnings, they are selling the company for $25 a share. Certainly anyone who bought the newly issued shares at $54 has a legitimate complaint."
Ford Motor Company and aluminum patent. Relax. DM is a different story. That’s a BS Ponzi scheme. However!!!! I like the market cap they were given because they SAID they were the binderjet leader. Ford Motor Company knows who the binderjet leader is. And we will see the day XONE HAS A $3b market cap.
"If xone was trading at dm's valuation right now it would be around $145/share. xone with a record last Q and a record backlog and comps against dm which has similar products could well make xone one of the best performers of 2021...if of course they keep executing. Fundamental analysis...technical analysis this holiday week means nothing, just the mm's trying to get people to tax loss sell. Have a great 2021!"
I see this is in at least 2 of the ARK funds as everyone seems to know here.As of yesterday's close it still held the #1 holding of PRNT at 9.14% of the ETF and 1.5437M shares and in the ARKQ ETF it was about .85% with them owning another 886.2k shares.It still seems like they hold plenty of shares here regardless of a pumper who dumped. This doesn't mean the stock is going up or down or sideways.Good luck.Peace.
"Here are the terms of the deal.''The share consideration component is subject to an exchange ratio adjustment if Desktop Metal’s 20-day volume weighted average price (VWAP) 3 days prior to closing is between $7.94 and $9.70. If the 20-day VWAP exceeds the higher end of that range, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 1.7522 per share, and if the 20-day VWAP goes below the lower end of that range, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 2.1416 per share.''If you run the numbers it pretty much locks in 25.50 per share....if you plan on selling ASAP.But if DM trades higher than 9.70 it's a win as you won't get more shares but those 1.75 shares will be worth more.Conversely if it trades below 7.94 you get more shares (2.14) but they will be worth less.Anything in between is a push.My thinking is there is more upside potential than downside risk so I'll be holding for a while.....and maybe just settle into DM."
Ahhhh little Benjo sold his position in the low-30's after posting 'there's no resistance to $70' a week earlier. Now the little wannabe chart analyst thinks his little posts will allow him to buy back at $13. Thus the name Benjoke
"So you get $8.50 in cash and $17.00 in shares of DM when they close the deal later this year. Doesn't this mean if DM shares goes up means it worse for us? I mean if DM some how went above $17, means I get less than 1 share for 1 share of XONE? Wouldn't it be better to sell it now and buy DM since it is only $9 now? Am I wrong about this? I average at $37 so this is not a good deal for me."
Did you guys read the press release about the online quoting tool. The tool itself is very helpful. But they gave two updates in the release. One on the X1-160 said “ Our 10th and most anticipated machine ever is being met with even better than expected demand” and those are large and expensive workhorses. And secondly the update on aluminum is for full qualification in 2021. That is huge. Aluminum is probably the most important metal for printing light weight parts. I also listened to the Needham conference talk. They basically shot down all DM wild outlandish claims. But they were graceful and informative in doing it. They poked at DM for YOY SALES DECREASE. As a sign of DM machines not gaining favor in the market.
Anybody else taking advantage of these dips and buying more?
Did it state the share price or did I read right past it
"Wow I was planning on buying tomorrow, had my money tied in other things. Happy for everyone who got in on this, cheers!"
60% YOY sale increase in Q3 20. $42.6m backlog. He is where you see due diligence displayed. Backlog going into Q4 20 is $10m higher than last year entering Q4. We all know Q4 is big for customers spending on capital goods. Analysts have basically no higher number on Q4 than Q3. So do you think this beats those numbers with what you just heard? Now throw in the X1-25pros are shipping to now??? Starting to make sense?
"Price Crumbling again . Will see how it holds up after the Bell. If this Company has a Future , and it looks like it does , then Buy any big dip ."
XONE being bought? what does this mean to us shareholders?
read ssys ceo comments today. 'we expect revenue growth to accelerate in 2022 and beyond. nice beat...blew past Q rev forecasts by like $35m. xone is next up...better discuss manufacturing expansion in the works on the call
any news today?
That was a messed up day!!..I bought some more but all my Stocks were down today so good only due some minimal shopping

Fourth quarter revenue of $17.4 million supported full-year revenue growth of 11%Record year-end backlog of $39.4 million increased 27% year-on-year and provides runway for 15% to 25% revenue growth expected for 2021Total liquidity increased to $59.7 million at December 31, 2020; subsequently enhanced by common stock sale of approximately $100 million in February 2021"

DowngradeCanaccord Genuity: Buy to Hold8/12/2021
Truly disruptive and innovative technology. I see nothing but high growth for the next 3 months plus.
Invested both DM and XONE since I could not sure who will be the winner of 3D Metal Printer.......haaa. two become one company...that is fine....but 8.5 cash plus 17$ DM share? any idea when would be a time line for that to be close ? They are saying the conversion rate would be 1.75 to 2.1 depends on the price of DM....Any idea based on what day ?
The real question is whether or not binder jet tech is ahead or on par with other leading technologies. Patents pending are key if in fact xone's version of additive manufacturing is game-changing. Right now press releases is all we have to work with...seems mgmt and Rockwell have hope in their future. 2020 will be the year this stock either hits $20 or becomes obsolete. Will be interesting for sure
This is a historic day for those who have been long on XONE since the single digits. I bought and sold and bought and sold all the way up and down. I loaded up at 17 and 20 and am very pleased. I bought some in the 30's but my average cost is around 23. I will take it and move on to DM! Good luck all!
It’s been a long time coming and finally light.Very Nice! 
I just bought 300 shares. First timer. Hope I made a right decision
XONE results demonstrate the growing interest of AM technology and its many applications. More importantly it demonstrates that the sector can generate sustainable profits as long as the underlying cost structure is scaled to the rate of revenue growth. VJET will be approaching that level shortly and its stock price will have a lot of catching up once it does.
Any ideas why the stock has dropped to over $1.25 below the buyout price? Is it just the time value of money? Or are some investors just taking the money and moving on?

"I notice Ark is selling 10,000-20,000 shares of XOne almost every day."
"XONE can sell 7 or 8 large printers for a total of $12 million or they can sell 5 million shares for $250 million In this market, it's a lot easier selling new shares versus high priced printers."
Halted till 16:50
"Guys don't forget SLM solution, climbing into ARK print portfolio in the last few days !It's a different additive manufacturing tech but more mature and they have the best market offer with a high productivity machine ! Already sold 6 machines (+2million#$%$ per machine probably) to OEM.Chart is forming a nice W, it's a 23 and no resistnace until 30 !"
"SLM solution is also a pure player in metal additive manufacturing, with a different technology based on laser melting (versus binder jetting), this tech is not a competitor to exone but complementary as it can produce larger parts. Capitalisation is very low compared to their position in the market (leading in productivity). I think I'll sell some Exone after this good run to add on SLM.ARK ETF Print is also well furnished with this one representing 4% of the total portfolio, and they have doubled on SLM since beigning of january without any effect on the share value, so good accumulation here.I think the same evolution as XOne is to be expected there."
