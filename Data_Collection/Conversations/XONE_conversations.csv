"To clarify the confusion: if you have hundred shares of Xone you will receive $850 cash and 1,700 that will be converted to desktop metal shares so that is approximately 180 shares as today's desktop metal value. What is not yet clear is conversion will occur all I read is that it is 4th quarter so until then I think you still own whatever you own in Xone"
"Full disclosure here: I’m taking a bath on this one, as I’m in 1500 shares an average of $35 per share. It’s my own fault, though; I know I shouldn’t have such a large stake in one company. Anyways, I’m thinking this is good news, because obviously XONE management didn’t have confidence in their own company, and you might as well get what you can, right? And hopefully I’ll be wiser on the next one."
Invested both DM and XONE since I could not sure who will be the winner of 3D Metal Printer.......haaa. two become one company...that is fine....but 8.5 cash plus 17$ DM share? any idea when would be a time line for that to be close ? They are saying the conversion rate would be 1.75 to 2.1 depends on the price of DM....Any idea based on what day ?
"I have not done my DD but just finish reading the acquisition News.""ExOne shareholders will receive $8.50 in cash and $17.00 in shares of Desktop Metal common stock for each share of ExOne common stock, for a total consideration of $25.50 per share,""It seems to me this is an arbitrage opportunity given that the current price of ExOne is still $17.38 which is lower than $25.50. Have I missed something here?Of course, this is given that the stock price movement relatively small and cannot be massively controlled by either DM or ExOne to push price of ExOne up until the acquitision is completed.There is also a investigation news for Merger Investigation from law firm Halper-Sadh-LLP.This Law firm probably does that to push the price of ExOne down so those who pay them could get it cheaper ??."
"Something's cooking today?Exone up today,23.16+0.67 (+2.98%)As of 12:10PM EDT. Market openhowever, DM is down...Desktop Metal, Inc. (DM)NYSE - Nasdaq Real Time Price.7.02-0.12 (-1.72%)As of 12:12PM EDT. Market open."
Any ideas why the stock has dropped to over $1.25 below the buyout price? Is it just the time value of money? Or are some investors just taking the money and moving on?
Confused. Will any new investors who buy the stock now get the $8 and have their shares convented to 2 dm shares? Why would u buy at the higher price now just to get 2 dm shares?
"Price Crumbling again . Will see how it holds up after the Bell. If this Company has a Future , and it looks like it does , then Buy any big dip ."
No matter what the share price is for DM we still get $25.5
XONE being bought? what does this mean to us shareholders?
Can anyone tell me if there has been a shareholder vote on the merger? I don't recall voting but maybe I did. I get a lot of proxies and vote most of them.
Hmmm..maybe buyibng more XONE is cheaper than buying DM directly ?

"I bought at $45 long time ago, although not much, seems like will never recover "
"So you get $8.50 in cash and $17.00 in shares of DM when they close the deal later this year. Doesn't this mean if DM shares goes up means it worse for us? I mean if DM some how went above $17, means I get less than 1 share for 1 share of XONE? Wouldn't it be better to sell it now and buy DM since it is only $9 now? Am I wrong about this? I average at $37 so this is not a good deal for me."
Xone is better off being alone or team up with 3D than DM
"The whole 3D printing sector seems dead right now. Last year the DM IPO sparked a jump, and that was followed by DDD reporting great earnings. Things have settled back down so what's the next catalyst? Will the next round of earnings spark more interest in the sector again?"
"When Exone issued the new shares six months ago, they forgot to include in the risk factors that management might decide to sell the company for 50% of the offering price.....minor oversight."
"I did have a few 40 shares of XONE since 2014 bought at $39. In 2020 I added 4000 around $7.5. Being desparate, I sold at the very bottom ($4.31) when reading one bad analyst comments saying the shares are going nowhere. After the spike to $54 and pullback, I bought 6000 shares with an average of $17.3 in July, and 1000 more yesterday at $17.37. So it could have been better if I kept my 4000 shares from last year, but finally a good story with a few false starts."
"Desktop Metal, Inc. ( DM Loading...Loading...) (“Desktop Metal”) and The ExOne Company ( XONE Loading...Loading...) (“ExOne”) announced today they have entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Desktop Metal ( DM ) will acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of ExOne ( XONE ) common stock. Under the terms of the agreement, ExOne ( XONE ) shareholders will receive $8.50 in cash and $17.00 in shares of Desktop Metal ( DM Loading...Loading...) common stock for each share of ExOne ( XONE Loading...Loading...) common stock, for a total consideration of $25.50 per share, representing a transaction value of $575 million, subject to a collar mechanism as described below and implying a 47.6% premium to the closing price of ExOne’s common stock on August 11, 2021 and a 43.9% premium based on the 30-day average closing price of ExOne ( XONE Loading...Loading...) common stock. The transaction value also implies an acquisition multiple of 6.4x 2021 consensus revenue estimates for ExOne"
"Anyone else notice that thevictor has not posted here in weeks? He pumped XONE while he was here, but he sold his XONE stock and now he's on the DM board still bashing it with no vested interest. The truth is he bought A123systems stock and he lost his butt on it when it went bankrupt, and the CEO is now the CEO of DM. That's why he hates DM."
"This stock will go flat till Q4, so at least we have time to decide if we sell or take the deal."
"When does the deal with DM finalize , and this gets delisted ?"
"I sold $25.11x 1000 of XONE and bought $DM $8.30x 2000..Thinking of buying more $DM..DM+XONE combined around $400+ BILLION Revenue next 12 months, if you take into account their Growth (DM growing at 2340%, XONE Growing at 110%. Sone mixed up. But that's a high growth, imagine $400Bn Revenue in pocket already next 12 months.. If that's the case, $$DM UNDERVALUED comparing to other 3D Printing stocks).. I watched this YOUTUBE explaining $$DM is better positioned due to choosing 'Binder Jetting method of printing as opposed to other choices..""Any opinions, advice appreciated Thanks in advance"
"Why is $XONE down today? It's because DM is down. It's simple math....if the buyout happened today you'd get 2.1 shares of DM plus $8.50 cash, or $23.57. It's selling at a discount to that because of the uncertainty of the merger."
"Wow I was planning on buying tomorrow, had my money tied in other things. Happy for everyone who got in on this, cheers!"
WHAT HAPPENS TO MY 30$ CALLS ??????GOING TO ZERO??
I voted YES on the merger!!
"Here are the terms of the deal.''The share consideration component is subject to an exchange ratio adjustment if Desktop Metal’s 20-day volume weighted average price (VWAP) 3 days prior to closing is between $7.94 and $9.70. If the 20-day VWAP exceeds the higher end of that range, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 1.7522 per share, and if the 20-day VWAP goes below the lower end of that range, the exchange ratio will be fixed at 2.1416 per share.''If you run the numbers it pretty much locks in 25.50 per share....if you plan on selling ASAP.But if DM trades higher than 9.70 it's a win as you won't get more shares but those 1.75 shares will be worth more.Conversely if it trades below 7.94 you get more shares (2.14) but they will be worth less.Anything in between is a push.My thinking is there is more upside potential than downside risk so I'll be holding for a while.....and maybe just settle into DM."
Anyone has an idea whether 8.5$ Cash will be a taxable income if the mearge approved ?
"I think almost all lawsuits by these class action law firms are a bunch of baloney. That being said, Exone probably will have to do some explaining as to why they thought their shares were worth $54 a share when they issued new shares in February and now after announcing record earnings, they are selling the company for $25 a share. Certainly anyone who bought the newly issued shares at $54 has a legitimate complaint."
I voted no!
"ARK is scared of something and sells XONE every day, but it’s still the largest position in 3D printing ETF"
"Combining DM and XONE is a very positive move for both companies. I think DM got the better part of the deal (I hold both DM and XONE shares), but overall everyone wins with this transaction."

"$SSYS I'm guessing that today's sharp stock rise (on a day when $DDD is down), has to do with the $DM purchase of $XONE . Earlier this year when Stratasys announced they were dropping their metal printer to focus on polymers, I was disappointed, as they had spent millions on development, only to jettison it before it was even released. I thought it might in reality be because $DM told them they didn't want the competition. $DM of course has been sharing the $SSYS reseller network for some years: Stratasys was concerned they might start losing some of their exclusive network because they had no metal printer for the network to offer to complement their polymer printers. Now I wonder if this new $DM deal hasn't been known by $SSYS for some time, and THAT'S why they dropped their metal printer. We now have a powerful, broad spectrum metal company linked to an equally powrful, broad spectrum polymer company (of course Stratasys was an early investor in DM also). An eventual formal combining of the two companies? I have no idea of the underlying practicality/desirability of that, but at least their present partnership is very promising. They should be making some noise."
"If I'm going to get $25.50 in 6 months, why wouldn't I take $25.10 today and call it a done deal?"
What's with the huge drop after hours ?
This is a historic day for those who have been long on XONE since the single digits. I bought and sold and bought and sold all the way up and down. I loaded up at 17 and 20 and am very pleased. I bought some in the 30's but my average cost is around 23. I will take it and move on to DM! Good luck all!
"agreement to purchase at $25.50, why the discount? is it covering the risk of acquisition not going through?"
