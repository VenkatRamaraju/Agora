WDAY will be over 275.00 tomorrow easy
CC sounds good
WDAY can easily hit 300
"$WDAY should buy this company. At a valuation of only $4B, this is a bargain. At a minimum, I expect this to double before year end. In an inflationary environment, the demand for services from Workday and Alight will just keep growing."
"Not the same, but PANW continues to rip higher days after post earnings beat"
"MORE VACCINES ROLLING OUTS AND EVERYONE GOES TO WORK, NO NEED WDAY ANYMORE, OR IT 'LL SINK AHEAD, SPECIALLY IN CORRECTION TERRITORY BY THIS YEAR END"
Sold my calls. Party over for today

Wday 'll sink or gave up its gain same as Crm.

$WDAY Target Raised by Loop Capital Buy USD 320 » USD 340Maintains Wolfe Research Outperform USD 270 » USD 300
Good time to take profits ahead of POWELL SPEECH that could dampen the stock...
it will go more upon Monday considering the 380% increase in volume comparing with the last 3 months.?
"11.5% increase in one day ... thanks, its been fun. Off for the rest of the day. See you Monday at $262"
Congrats to the longs this is a buy and hold forever stock for me with plenty of secular growth rail winds for the next 30 years!
Any idea what's going on here?
profit taking to begin in 2hr 21mins
"Saleforce, CRM is having strong e/r lately and much much stronger than WDAY ....but give up its gain and up only 2%...caution !"
Hope this company goes bankrupt soon so I don't have to listen to their annoying radio ads.
"Next week could be massive sell-off as POWELL said will start tapering by the end of this year, which is couple months away...market 'll be crashed soon...good time to take profits before too late....as heavy correction ahead...."
HIGH ALERT !!!CRM now is only up 1.5 % after gave up all its gain since yesterday....high caution...!!
$WDAY is up 10% today. Hope CRWD will get such pop after earnings.
I heard about WDAY the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
I cant afford $WDAY ... so Alight Solutions via SPAC merger with $WPF is the cheaper alternative. There is room for cloud-based HR in the market for 3 or more vendors. Alight is the second best out there after Workday.
Hello 265
Getting volume we need
It will be above $270 tomorrow morning
"JUST SOLD ALL MY WDAY POSITION TODAY, IT 'LL BE HARD TO KEEP GOING AT THIS LEVEL"
"ON THIS PEAK MARKET RAISING FULL YEAR GUIDANCE MEANING NOTHING ! LOOK AT ULTA, ONES SHOULD KNOW IT DOESN'T MATTER, ULTA GAVE UP ITS GAIN AND IT SEEMS THEY KNOW IT'S GOING TO CRASH ANYTIME SOON ! THAT'S WHY THEY CAN'T HOLD THEIR GAIN !SAME FOR CRM YESTERDAY E/R TOO. AND NOW IT'S SURE WILL BE THE SAME FOR WDAY !"
They actually have made a profit.
Definitely it's not good to hold at this bounce today...sell before any correction territory occurs in near future
