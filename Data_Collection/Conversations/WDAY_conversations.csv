Easy money here shorting this at the open today.Growing slower doesn't bode well.
Good time to take profits ahead of POWELL SPEECH that could dampen the stock...
Crashing after hours
"I don't get it. WKDY beats on all cylinders! How could the stock be down in AH trading?Other stocks like BYND, ABNB, ETSY all up despite of bad earnings. Hmmm"
"MT Newswire writes: ""Non-GAAP EPS increased to $0.31 for the three months ended July 31, from $0.24 a year ago. That surpassed the $0.26 average estimate of analysts surveyed by Capital IQ.Fiscal Q2 revenue increased 27.9% to $671.7 million, from $525.3 million, also exceeding the analyst consensus of $663.4 million.Looking forward, the company said in a statement, ""Based on our second quarter results, and inclusive of the acquisition of Adaptive Insights, we are raising our fiscal 2019 revenue outlook and now expect subscription revenue of $2.341 to $2.348 billion, or growth of 31%. We expect our third quarter subscription revenue to be between $609 and $611 million, representing 31% to 32% growth."""
"Slowdown hitting WDAY: Workday is definitely losing its revenue growth rate. In the past, WDAY had maintained an 8% average sequential growth rate, but projections now look bad and are now saying that WDAY growth rate is going to drop significantly from this for Q2. As you can see from the data below, if WDAY was to stay at 8% sequential growth they must hit $891 million in revenue for Q2. But analysts are no longer believing WDAY can scale. They have deeply reduced their estimates of WDAY's growth rate now to 5.7%. Terrible! This was a growth stock but is seemingly losing the ability to grow. If they don't hit $891 million in revenue for Q2, WDAY will fall significantly. Currently WDAY is priced for perfection only as a strongly growing company. But they came in with poor sequential revenue growth last quarter, and analysts are again predicting poor sequential growth for Q2. The stuff is going to hit the fan. They continue to dilute shares just as fast, but growth rate has been degrading. Also, every one of these quarters showed a GAAP net LOSS! Looks very bad. You should not be surprised to see WDAY hit $55 per share in the next few months. Qtr .……Revenue ……Seq. growthJul '18 …..671.7m ………8.6%Oct '18 ….743.2m ……..10.6%Jan '19 ….788.6m ………6.1%Apr '19 ….825.1m ………4.6% Jul ’19 …..891.0m ..…….8.0%. (but Jul '19 is now actually projected to be 872m which is 5.7% growth. Very bad projection trend! If they can’t hit $891 million, stock price will fall toward $55 per share)."

Gradual and steady increase :)
"It is a profitable company on a non GAAP basis. ""The company’s net loss widened to $116.3 million, or 52 cents per share, in the first-quarter ended April 30, from $74.4 million, or 35 cents, a year earlier. Excluding items, Workday earned 43 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 41 cents per share"""
"Ed here posted 24c miss vs. 26 expected, Andrea posted a 31c beat vs 26c expected. Which one is it???"
"ON THIS PEAK MARKET RAISING FULL YEAR GUIDANCE MEANING NOTHING ! LOOK AT ULTA, ONES SHOULD KNOW IT DOESN'T MATTER, ULTA GAVE UP ITS GAIN AND IT SEEMS THEY KNOW IT'S GOING TO CRASH ANYTIME SOON ! THAT'S WHY THEY CAN'T HOLD THEIR GAIN !SAME FOR CRM YESTERDAY E/R TOO. AND NOW IT'S SURE WILL BE THE SAME FOR WDAY !"
15 times sales and no profits. This is a repeat of the dotcom bubble. This over hyped marketing machine will come back down to earth. The top executives are bleeding the company and continuing to dilute shareholders. Do your own DD.

I cant afford $WDAY ... so Alight Solutions via SPAC merger with $WPF is the cheaper alternative. There is room for cloud-based HR in the market for 3 or more vendors. Alight is the second best out there after Workday.
longs don't sell now sell at $130 in few months
100 x earnings....you can have it
WAYYYYYY over valued. They will run out of cash in one year . sales have been decreasing Q over Q
"Initiated short at 164.44. Little uptrend left, downwards potential enormous."
Solid Beat at 31 cents VS expected 26 cents. This is just like VMW and CRM. Down a few buck after hours and will recover give it some time.
Should be in green tomorrow
"Workday Inc Enters Wave 3 of Elliott Wave Cycle10/11/2019Recognia has detected that Workday Inc (WDAY on NASDAQ) has entered Wave 3 of its Elliott Wave cycle. This bullish signal indicates that the price may rise from the previous close of 180.44 to the next Elliott Wave target price of 184.23.Wave 3 of the Elliott Wave cycle is the third and typically the most powerful move in the five wave trend. This move is in the direction of the overall market trend (either bullish or bearish). By definition, Wave 3 cannot be the shortest of the three impulsive waves and should as a rule have greater volume then either Wave 1 or 2. For stocks, Wave 3 is usually the longest and most trade-able wave in the Elliott Wave cycle. The Wave 3 target price is determined using Fibonacci ratios and should typically be 1.618 or more times the movement of Wave 1."
HIGH ALERT !!!CRM now is only up 1.5 % after gave up all its gain since yesterday....high caution...!!
251 price target from KeyBanc!.. This is a money maker!!
Bought at EOD. Get ready for a pop early next week.
"This is now, with the lower growth rate, substantially over-valued. Should be 5-6x revenue, no more based on growth rates and future projected ROIC. So, 50% downside to get to fair value....will probably get there by next year as growth continues to slow down...no company can escape the law of large numbers...the unfortunate reality...cheers!"
This is the one to watch blow up for a cloud based company with forward looking growth ahead.
"This company might be worth a P/E of 30. Unfortunately analysts are now only projecting $1.60 per share for the next year. At a P/E of 30, this would put WDAY stock at $48 per share! WDAY is way overvalued."
"Why is workday sputtering? Understand it is ""overbought"", but the other ""overbought"" cloud companies have been moving up quite well. What is different about wday? Thanks."
"WDAY growth rate is dropping. In order to maintain sequential quarterly growth rate of 10%, they needed to hit $820 in revenue. Revenue fell far short of this and was only $788 million for Q4. Too bad revenue growth is slowing."
Very secure investment with sound balance sheet with continued improvement for income trend.
Way oversold in a single day. It will jump back to $220 tomorrow. Great results and great outlook for 2021. No reason for it to be in oversold territory. BUY BUY BUY.
I bought today at 191. Hope to make 5-10% on earning day
EXPLOSIONS LOOM.
"Nah, this is a long term secular grower. Growth will be lumpy from time to time as Capex comes expands and contracts. Still, 20% growth in core business is not too shabby. Shares are trading off for the year- love it at these levels."
These guys track CRM.. They will be up over 10% next week on great earnings.

Who is buying this up 10% the day before earnings?
Great earnings always drive a stock higher. Workday is a winner.
CEO sold 25% of his holdings at $144. I think he knows more than anybody on this site.
Definitely it's not good to hold at this bounce today...sell before any correction territory occurs in near future
"Monday (5/13) Mad Money Segment on Workday. ""In his final ""Executive Decision"" segment, Cramer sat down with Aneel Bhusri, co-founder and CEO at Workday (WDAY - Get Report) , the human resource software provider with shares that fell 4.6% by the close. Shares of Workday are still up 27.4% for the year.Bhusri noted that Workday has no exposure to China or the trade war and he's not expecting to feel any impact. Overall, he said businesses continue to migrate to the cloud faster than expected and new companies, like Workday, have proven to have the best solutions.Workday is also active in the higher education sector, a market Bhusri called underserved but very receptive to new technologies.Finally, when asked about his goal to hit $10 billion in revenue, Bhusri noted that he thinks the company can get there organically, but he's not opposed to one or two additional acquisitions to help accelerate that process."""
"Guys, do you think this pushes through 260, or pulls back?"
Cramer will pump this up to $260.00 in a few minutes.
Any idea what's going on here?
20% above expected diluted earnings. Beat revenue target. Raised guidance. And down in the after market. I don't get it.
"Next week could be massive sell-off as POWELL said will start tapering by the end of this year, which is couple months away...market 'll be crashed soon...good time to take profits before too late....as heavy correction ahead...."
"So Workday's stock-based compensation expense for Q1 is $185 million, up from $133 million in Q1 last year. They really should change the name to Payday."
"Will wait for a pullback on this one in next month or so, how can you buy at these prices. Same for crm"
"Going trade down to $200 tomorrow, similar to Splunk. Cramer even said buy after it corrects."
"Not the same, but PANW continues to rip higher days after post earnings beat"
I am bullish! Going higher as the night goes on and higher in the morning. Love this and CRM. Always solid every quarter. I am content with this beat and content with the spending
Not bad. Another 6% tomorrow.
Anybody CRM vs. WDAY ? intelligent response will be highly appreciated .
My company is moving over to Workday. Most of my colleagues really prefer the system.Great productWill buy moreCheers to Workday
"Wow, that quarter stunk! They have confirmed that revenue growth is slowing and the company can no longer meet the traditional 8% increase per quarter. Losses increased once again. GAAP loss was $120,712,000. The company is losing more money, on-track for losing $500 million per year. WDAY is way overvalued! We are going to see a drop in WDAY stock price."

"No way on less than $120.. SAP just bought Qualtrac's for $8B and they only did $184""M"" in revenue in the last 6 months and only grew by ~ 40% (on such a low base). WDAY is growing 25%'sh on a $2-2.5""B"" base."

"Going into earnings unfortunately the stock was overcooked and rsi at one year level was over 70 or oversold. Has dropped to around 55 level and will now bounce around in the 190 area. Since this is Friday do not expect a jump back to 200, but over time it will creep back up. Stock has a lot of new customers and these techs are all based on expectations. The problem is they are hard to compare to anything. HR is getting new customers and the Finance side is improving. Looks like a great future if everything keep going like it has. Look for this to move back to 200 and then consolidate and move higher. It moved from 117 in November to the 200 range all the good stuff was baked in before earnings. If you base your bets on the times earnings and revs don't be in tech because it doesn't work that way. Buy Costco, target Walmart and those brick and mortars. Good luck."
"Saleforce, CRM is having strong e/r lately and much much stronger than WDAY ....but give up its gain and up only 2%...caution !"
Will be back to $200 within a weeek. Mark this post
WDAY will be over 275.00 tomorrow easy
no one taking profits?...
"$WDAY should buy this company. At a valuation of only $4B, this is a bargain. At a minimum, I expect this to double before year end. In an inflationary environment, the demand for services from Workday and Alight will just keep growing."
"There is support at $120. WDAY will get there in a few months, but hopefully hold firm at $120 per share for a year or so and rise back to $130 per share."
Hello 265
"Just like all the other earnings. A complete recovery is coming in a few days/week. Today there is a cloud problem, so let#$%$ new lows for the day first in the 162's. Watch out though if the market drops again."
"Workday’s most recent earnings had the highest annual gains among its HCM competitors, who have also highlighted how Covid-19 has increased new sales and adoption of cloud services. Workday’s revenues for the third quarter were $1.11 billion, up 17.9% compared to last year, and its subscription revenue was $968.5 million, an annual increase of 21.3%."
Should be a short term bottom now. We should see upside from this point.
this was a great earnings report and this stock is on sale buying calls 30 days out more than sure I will make money...
Wday 'll sink or gave up its gain same as Crm.
This stock doesn't deserve your hard earned money. Stay away.
48 billion market cap? That’s funny. That’s way more that Ford alone. Realtity will set in very soon.
Someone mind telling me how this is down? and I don't want to hear it ran up into earnings because it didn't nor is it overvalued. Getting sick of this rigged market. First NVDA yesterday and now this.
Ooops...this is what I was afraid of. Softbank will demand alot and pay discounted valuation..just sayin
January calls looks very attractive.
"HAVING WAITING SO LONG TO SELL, AND HAPPY TO GET RID OF MY WASTE TIME HOLDING ON WDAY FOR WHILE AGO"
Can't believe how evil these options expiration are ... they purposely bringing it down to max pain ... $212.50 Otherwise WDAY will close easily at $220
"Beat revenue and raised the guidance! enjoy the ride.Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY) reported Q2 EPS of $0.44, $0.09 better than the analyst estimate of $0.35. Revenue for the quarter came in at $887.8 million versus the consensus estimate of $872.31 million.“It was a strong quarter, with continued global customer momentum across the Fortune 500 and Global 2,000, as more organizations look to Workday for the ability to plan, execute, and analyze in one system powered by machine learning. In addition, we celebrated one year with Adaptive Insights and continue to make great progress on our integration vision,” said Aneel Bhusri, co-founder and CEO, Workday. “As we move into the second half of the year, we are continuing to invest in areas that leverage our strengths and open new opportunities.”“We delivered strong Q2 results with subscription revenue up 34%, along with solid operating margins and cash flow,” said Robynne Sisco, co-president and chief financial officer, Workday. “Based on our second quarter results, we are raising our fiscal 2020 subscription revenue outlook and now expect subscription revenue of $3.06 to $3.07 billion. We expect our third quarter subscription revenue to be between $783 and $785 million. We continue to prioritize investing in long-term growth initiatives, while delivering solid operating margins and cash flow over time.”"
Congrats to the longs this is a buy and hold forever stock for me with plenty of secular growth rail winds for the next 30 years!
WDAY can easily hit 300
This will pull back as earnings will be “sell on the news” event regardless of how stellar they are.

"$WDAY is starting to get viewed as an established tech company versus a high-growth newbie cloud company. It's time for $WDAY to offer a dividend like its ERP competitors and more established tech companies; SAP, ORCL, MSFT. Something in the 1.25% - 1.75% would be appropriate at this time."
"Negative GAAP earnings, $230 stock price"
"analysts targets still way higher than today...Workday (WDAY - Get Report) shares are down double digits after RBC Capital analysts cut their price target on the human-resources cloud-application platform to $212 from $225 while affirming the stock outperform.After the Pleasanton, Calif., company's analyst day on Tuesday, RBC said Workday presents a ""durable"" growth story. But RBC sees that growth slowing as penetration into larger accounts slows. The new price target still represents a potential upside of 17% from the stock's Tuesday closing price of $180.96.Workday shares at last check on Wednesday were trading down 11% at $160.63. Meanwhile, analysts at Macquarie said in a note that ""several new products"" at Workday ""may be difficult to monetize.""Macquarie has a neutral rating and $196 price target on WDAY. Analysts at Citi see international and mid-market growth as keys to the company's future, but the firm also says these are ""lower confidence sources of growth."" Citi also rates the stock neutral, with a $192 price target. And Jefferies has a hold rating and $188 price target on Workday due to valuation concerns."

"WDAY gave away the store to get this ACN job. There is no profit margin from the contract. WDAY which was already losing money is now getting farther and farther away from profitability. Sad day for WDAY, you will see losses grow in the next quarterly and even more losses growing after that."

Karen I just want to see the kids Please I'm begging you there my children too. I don't understand why you wont let me see them please Karen."
"Disappointing to see WDAY revenue growth faltering so badly. Revenue growth used to be over 30% per year, but the company's growth has stumbled even further. Now, it can not even hit the 16% per year growth rate. I didn't think this company would lose its growth so fast. Is this the beginning of the end for the high price-to-sales metric? Could WDAY be headed for P/S of 3 ? That would put the price per share near $40 per share for WDAY."

Overreaction today
"This stock is on sale at this point. I'm surprised with the YoY earning beats, that it has not moved higher by now."
"This thing spike to 259 a little over a month ago, then sank down to 219, consolidated for a little bit, and now it's run up and crashed through it's 52 week high. Earnings are a couple weeks out. Not sure what to make of this move. Outside of the Goldman Sachs upgrade and PT increase, there has been no other news."
"WDAY stock price is in a bubble. My company uses it, and very few like the system."
from my perspective and I make at least 500 to 800 a day in the marker just playing with several funds. This stock you buy at this low price and in about 6 months see a 30% growth. Not bad for a gain.
I heard about WDAY the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"WDAY is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 116.07. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 53.9, so we one might conclude that WDAY is trading at a premium comparatively."
"Of the 35 analysts who cover Workday, seven cut their price targets on the stock for an average of $214.35, according to FactSet. Not all analysts were overly negative, however. Cowen analyst J. Derrick Wood, who has an outperform rating and a $240 price target, said more financial services are moving to the cloud from on-premises servers and that Workday will be “a leading beneficiary of this trend.”“Management disclosed more color around Financials vs. previous analyst days which we believe is indicative of better footing heading into a seasonally strong 2H,” Wood said."
BUY....BUY...BUY...!!
"Despite that earnings reaction being a decent selloff, it just only tells us that was the short term selling climax. When we look closer, it also looks like $WDAY just completed a microsubwave 2 within a subwave 2 before proceeding higher"
"Very weak. WDAY revenues are getting delayed or likely not going to show up at all. WDAY used to grow 8% sequentially, but now growth is coming to a halt. For 8% sequential growth, WDAY needed to hit $851.7 million in revenue for Q1. But the company missed that again, and Q1 only hit $825.1 million in revenue. Huge slowdown. WDAY missed the 8% growth again and actually only grew by 4.6%."
another software company that is a little ahead of itself. 33 billion market cap with small earnings. definitely solid company but valuation just a little too high at this point to be an attractive buy
what exactly do they do? My company uses them and I find their product confusing. I wished their files are more structured for easy to find.
WDAY just broke the 50 MA on the daily chart. This is going to continue it's climb.
"It will go up late this coming week, if it’s past history is any indication of performance after earning. Usually 5-7 days after earning., not counting the weekend. Good luck to all."
"They sounded very subdued on the analyst call, the new products are off to a slow start it seems. May not be enough to support premium valuation."
"Sold all my high flyers of last week to buy 10k worth of $WDAYSolid company, great earnings, loads of room to grow.This will bounce right back on monday. Cheers!!"
"Why is WDAY dropping like a falling knife, is it because Workday’s revenue growth rate is tanking? Traditionally, WDAY had maintained an 8% sequential growth rate, but projections now look bad and are now indicating that WDAY growth rate is going to drop significantly from this for Q2. In order for WDAY to maintain 8% sequential growth, they must hit $891 million in revenue for Q2. But analysts are no longer believing WDAY can scale at that rate. They have deeply reduced their estimates. The stock is currently priced for perfection but still hasn’t hit net profitability yet. If a recession comes, WDAY definitely will not hit profitability and will fall a LOT more than most companies. The stuff is going to hit the fan. They continue to dilute shares just as fast, but growth rate has been declining and employees are starting to get antsy. Every quarter showed a GAAP net LOSS! Looks very bad. If WDAY missed $891 million for the quarter, you should not be surprised if you see WDAY hit $55 per share in the next few months."
Never seen a pumping like this.
profit taking to begin in 2hr 21mins
half anaylsts raised prices to below what it is trading at.. just shows you how out of touch market is.. primed to fall..
WDAY is one of the cheapest SAAS stocks! Could easily double in next 12 months
"Think of the funds that own this that have daily redemptions. What are they going to sell? Something up 50% in two weeks, or the rest of their stocks that are already down..."
"Terrible. This company is diluting shareholders interest. They are losing $400 million per year. This is way overvalued, even more so than the already overvalued market. Soon, the US government is not only going to stop stimulus, but they are going to reverse the stimulus and implement a significant tax increase that will slow the economy, reduce the current benefits currently coming from all over-exuberant flow down from companies and from government and from investment to the broad range of Americans. This will hurt the stock markets and prospects of growth. Sky-high PE ratios will deflate most rapidly. Reality will return with a slap. It will be sobering. In 2017 (before the tax cuts), the S&P500 was 60% of what it is today. It will go back there. We will likely see at least a 40% drop in the S&P500 and the high beta and high-PE stocks will drop even more. Beware!"

CC sounds good
"Looking like trouble for WDAY, since they are losing money by posting negative GAAP operating loss every quarter. They need show 10% growth every sequential quarter (that is what hyped companies like Pets.com did). They need to justify their valuation by maintaining this minimum revenue growth, otherwise, there is no reason for investors to even think about dumping money into them. However, their growth is starting to falter. To obtain the sequential growth for the upcoming report, WDAY needs to show revenue of $820 million. My sources say that this is the quarter that WDAY is going to fall short. They are falling off track because the balance sheet has been degrading. The continued losses are taking their toll. Cash had dropped hugely. Nearly all companies that push this strategy eventually suffer as it is noticed that they are not making sufficient progress toward improving the net tangible assets or cash. It is becoming clear that WDAY's strategy is unsustainable. This is going to have dire consequences for WDAY common shareholders -- the same shareholders that have been getting diluted every quarter. The jig nearly up. Beware. You may not see support of the stock until it hits PS of 5, which is still pretty high. That would put WDAY stock around $55 per share."
"11.5% increase in one day ... thanks, its been fun. Off for the rest of the day. See you Monday at $262"
This will open at 275 to 280 tomorrow morning and then it go higher ....look at all companies that have beat the earning .....
Tanking anytime soon. I repeat. This is worth $100/share.
Why the drop ?
If these guys can keep their costs in check a little. They could be trading north of $300
$WDAY is up 10% today. Hope CRWD will get such pop after earnings.
"Stock is already down from its highs, any profit taking by big investors already happened."
"For you who don't understand that WDAY is losing money every quarter and hugely diluting common shareholders. Look at the SEC documents. Here are the net income numbers from WDAY:Jan 2018 -$89.1 million (yes, negative numbers are losses)Apr 2018 -$74.4 millionJul 2018 -$86.2 millionOct 2018 -$153.3 millionThese are huge net losses every quarter, and balance sheet (and especially cash and tangible net assets) are going down every quarter. Common shareholders are in for a surprise on how their common shares are going to lose a lot of value."
"Technically, WDAY should have a bounce to ~$170 in the final week of 2019, after the tax-loss selling are completed."
"So WDAY gains $4.3 billion in market cap instantly on a revenue beat of only $20 million, some of which is due to acquisition of Adaptive Insights. Market reaction defies logic."
their earnings report is gonna be spectacular. mark my words. $230 a share coming right up...
"OK, I think I will start a positionn here.what is the market cap?35 billion???this one is headed to 100"

The revenues have spiked by nearly 50% to $481.2 million. The Gross Margin is enormous at 48.40%. $MSFT, $APPL, $ZM, $SHOP, $NOW, $WDAY"
They actually have made a profit.
blowout earnings today.
Just bought on the dip to 164
Andrew Left should announce a short position in this stock. It is so vulnerable at these heights it would drop like $50 that day.

Would not want to enter a long position at this level.

Cover it now before we see $240 by few hours :)
"Morgan Stanley (Overweight, $295 price target) says the macro environment created ""significant headwinds"" in the quarter and guidance shows ""we’re not completely out of the woods yet,"" implying slower subscription backlog growth."
"This is why we're down...think its a bit overdone“Given the timing of these launches and the time it takes a new product to impact subscription revenue growth at our scale, these emerging products won’t start to have any notable impact on our revenue growth until fiscal 2022 and beyond,” Sisco said, adding that Scout RFP would shave 1.5 percentage points off the adjusted operating margin in 2021, while adding less than 1% to subscription revenue."
"Sheesh nice let go yday @ $240. I could tell sentiment wasn’t strong enough to hold the initial pop from the report.COVID resurgence concerns, slowing growth, light sales growth q/q. Great company, but frothy from last q report, and salesforce boost. From here I expect CRM & WDAY to decouple and for CRM to outperform."
"PE of over one hundred and PEG of about 5 against the 2020 estimate, making it one of the most expensive stocks on the map. Priced for way beyond perfection. Not only no margin for error but could drop 25% and still be risky. Took profits last week, sold some hedged 187.5 calls, broke even on them (after sweating a bit).Starting to take a short position, this has to be topping out."
Will probably get a boost from $wday & $okta reports later.
"This stock had great earnings, my calls better print tomorrow."
"“Net loss per basic and diluted share was $0.68, compared to a net loss per basic and diluted share of $0.52 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.”Keep on buying!! Decade of operations and still no profitability. Instead, a bigger and bigger net loss. And lowered revenue guidance of top of that."
It will be above $270 tomorrow morning
"I clearly agree with the article. I did not understand the drop on Friday when the results are outdated and in addition, in this complicated context, Workday has succeeded in winning new large customers and has managed to expand into new countries. And also, on a human resources software, once we are on it, it is for more than 10 years so that will allow workday to still have a large fallout of money.https://qz.com/1936389/workday-earnings-and-software-subscriptions-rise-due-to-covid-19/?utm_source=YPL"
"The Oracle + Microsoft partnership could really hurt Workday's market share going forward. Oracle's CEO says WDAY is ""not competitive"" “I think Workday does – again, my sense of Workday is they do a decent job in upmarket HCM where they can divorce the HCM buyer from the ERP buyer. When the ERP buyer and the HCM buyer are aligned and combined, they’re really in a position with no chance because they don’t have much of a financials product,” Hurd said.“And I know they hype it and they talk about it and all that, but at the end of the day, they are just not competitive. So, for us, the market really is for us to keep moving ahead. I don’t know what our market share must be in cloud financials now, but it must be plus 90%, 92%, 93%, 94%.”https://cloudwars.co/oracle-workday-not-competitive-sap-time-bomb/"
Look at insider transactions...they are exercising options and SELLING while the price is right....they only hold 1.2% of shares oustanding....they are selling because they know more than you do...wise up before its too late.
"• Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) is in good position to capitalize on HCM and financial enterprise spending triggered by reopenings, the firm says. Also here, consensus billings growth (for 16.6%) looks conservative, poising the stock for outperformance in 2021."
"I would like to offer predictions today.Big tech’s dominance is finally over. Their decline began in 2020 and in a few short years they’re going to be in a free fall as the public confidence in them rapidly erodes. A major realignment will take place and MICROSOFT is going to emerge as the dominant leader because of a spectacular growth in its revenue and profitability. Coupled with the fact that CEO Nadella is a level headed person focused on Microsoft’s growth and not activism, investors will see the value in its stock. I believe even more investment will flow into the $MSFT stock starting this year.My prediction for other stocks:1 Investors will start realizing that $AMZN’s valuation is significantly higher than its peers. I believe the stock won’t surpass the ATH it saw in 2020. It is quite likely that the stock price may decline during 2021.2 $AAPL stock will likely grow higher during 2021, but its high flying days are over. Apple car is just a concept and it will be several years before a physical product is launched. In the meantime, Tesla Cybertruck and a possible low priced car may already be in the roads, thereby making Tesla the undisputed leader. It will be very difficult to penetrate its market. I see no innovation from Apple and investors will see that too.3 Stocks like $GOOG, $FB, $TWTR will likely stagnate and commence MASSIVE declines. I expect that regulations by governments around the world will act as catalysts to their decline.4 Other tech stocks like $WDAY, $NOW, $CRM will likely have more realistic P/E."
what happened to @+/% day?
"WDAY is down in after hours because traders are tired of paying a premium valuation for companies that are not profitable like Workday. Anyone who traded in 1999-2000 knows how this turned out. Companies that were not making any money and kept on reporting a quarterly loss eventually fell back down to earth to a more sensible valuation. For Workday, that number may be $180 or less."
"this Is just typical sell the cloud stocks because the world is coming to an end. it happens every quarter and these stocks fly rite back up, twlo, crm, wday, etc. same old same..."
"""Workday is loss-making"" ...and stock price is being desperately inflated.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/want-invest-workday-inc-nasdaq-171838834.html"
"At $180, it will still be 50 times 2022 earnings. I seriously doubt that 2022 earning will rise 50% over 2021. So the current stock price may be justified one year from now when you are looking at 2023 earnings."
"40 billions market cap ...the smart people start too understand that forward p/e 80, price/book 12 is just comic overvalued."
Sold my calls. Party over for today
"I got a chance to research WDAY after 5.5% decline on good earnings that beat expectations. The company's flagship product (HR database) is innovative. It is eating into SAP's vast established customer base. This will continue for next 4 years.WDAY is also the HR database of choice for small companiesWDAY is the defacto HR database for other cloud companies.WDAY expense control is ok. Not bad. Not stellar.WDAY diversification and growth plans are ok. Earnings day selloff was impulsive. The stock has risen from $75 to $225 in little over 2 years. If SPX decides to go towards 3000 - WDAY is bound to cross $200.If SPX instead takes a correction to 2750 before heading to 3000,WDAY could see $155 before heading to $200.Below $150 WDAY becomes a $200 buyout entity. SUMMARYSolid company. Buying opportunity at $180Bigger buying opportunity at $155Very high chance of seeing $200 in 6 months."
"MORE VACCINES ROLLING OUTS AND EVERYONE GOES TO WORK, NO NEED WDAY ANYMORE, OR IT 'LL SINK AHEAD, SPECIALLY IN CORRECTION TERRITORY BY THIS YEAR END"
"Terrible day for WDAY shareholders. Continues to lose money and even more. Net loss for Q4 was $128 million vs. $104 million. Losses expanded by 24%.Net loss per share was $0.56, compared to a net loss per share of $0.47 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.Losses, goodwill and number of shares outstanding are going up fastest."
Yes. They beat but trading at 16x sales compared to $CRM which trades at 10x Ttm sales... and are profitable. Still a show me story and likely to go down in the next few months. This is a sell the news story.
Bullish article by Quartz. Covid19 is speeding the shift to digital accounting for businesses. This will hugely benefit Workday! https://qz.com/1936389/workday-earnings-and-software-subscriptions-rise-due-to-covid-19/?utm_source=YPL
any news on why this is up so much in pre-market ?
"If you like growth and don’t mind negative net income, you have some research to do. WDAY is losing money every quarter. They have been putting revenue growth ahead of sound business practices and profitable growth (ala Pets.com). WDAY net tangible assets have dropped from $1.5 billion recently, now all the way down to $0.1 billion in the most recent quarter. The company is seeing reduced cash flow from operations. Cash has dropped significantly, and goodwill has risen hugely. The Adaptive Insights acquisition was a terrible and costly move that is not paying off. It is not just costly for the company, but will be seen to be VERY costly to shareholders. That is why top management is dumping WDAY stock. Note the $200 million per quarter expense (due to share diluation) is like a drug that the company is addicted to. It does not appear in the non-GAAP income, but it is a true expense to shareholders. Beware, Warren Buffett would not invest in WDAY because of this. Don’t be surprised when you see the carcass left behind by current management."
I guess we have some confidence around the earnings
Hope this company goes bankrupt soon so I don't have to listen to their annoying radio ads.
A company regularly losing this much money on a quarterly basis would be way lower without the Cramer promotion.
"JUST SOLD ALL MY WDAY POSITION TODAY, IT 'LL BE HARD TO KEEP GOING AT THIS LEVEL"
"If you cant afford $WDAY, Alight Solutions with its merger with $WPF is the next best investment. It is already profitable"
Workday is up 7.47% to 265.19
