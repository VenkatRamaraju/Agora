$WDAY is up 10% today. Hope CRWD will get such pop after earnings.
"I clearly agree with the article. I did not understand the drop on Friday when the results are outdated and in addition, in this complicated context, Workday has succeeded in winning new large customers and has managed to expand into new countries. And also, on a human resources software, once we are on it, it is for more than 10 years so that will allow workday to still have a large fallout of money.https://qz.com/1936389/workday-earnings-and-software-subscriptions-rise-due-to-covid-19/?utm_source=YPL"
Wday 'll sink or gave up its gain same as Crm.
What's wrong with WDAY.Stay short for now
"They sounded very subdued on the analyst call, the new products are off to a slow start it seems. May not be enough to support premium valuation."
Way oversold in a single day. It will jump back to $220 tomorrow. Great results and great outlook for 2021. No reason for it to be in oversold territory. BUY BUY BUY.
Buy here and shelf it for 3 months and you can sell in the 180s. WDAY has a strong moat.
"Not the same, but PANW continues to rip higher days after post earnings beat"
It will be above $270 tomorrow morning
I heard about WDAY the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"11.5% increase in one day ... thanks, its been fun. Off for the rest of the day. See you Monday at $262"
"Beat revenue and raised the guidance! enjoy the ride.Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY) reported Q2 EPS of $0.44, $0.09 better than the analyst estimate of $0.35. Revenue for the quarter came in at $887.8 million versus the consensus estimate of $872.31 million.“It was a strong quarter, with continued global customer momentum across the Fortune 500 and Global 2,000, as more organizations look to Workday for the ability to plan, execute, and analyze in one system powered by machine learning. In addition, we celebrated one year with Adaptive Insights and continue to make great progress on our integration vision,” said Aneel Bhusri, co-founder and CEO, Workday. “As we move into the second half of the year, we are continuing to invest in areas that leverage our strengths and open new opportunities.”“We delivered strong Q2 results with subscription revenue up 34%, along with solid operating margins and cash flow,” said Robynne Sisco, co-president and chief financial officer, Workday. “Based on our second quarter results, we are raising our fiscal 2020 subscription revenue outlook and now expect subscription revenue of $3.06 to $3.07 billion. We expect our third quarter subscription revenue to be between $783 and $785 million. We continue to prioritize investing in long-term growth initiatives, while delivering solid operating margins and cash flow over time.”"
"At $180, it will still be 50 times 2022 earnings. I seriously doubt that 2022 earning will rise 50% over 2021. So the current stock price may be justified one year from now when you are looking at 2023 earnings."
"ON THIS PEAK MARKET RAISING FULL YEAR GUIDANCE MEANING NOTHING ! LOOK AT ULTA, ONES SHOULD KNOW IT DOESN'T MATTER, ULTA GAVE UP ITS GAIN AND IT SEEMS THEY KNOW IT'S GOING TO CRASH ANYTIME SOON ! THAT'S WHY THEY CAN'T HOLD THEIR GAIN !SAME FOR CRM YESTERDAY E/R TOO. AND NOW IT'S SURE WILL BE THE SAME FOR WDAY !"
half anaylsts raised prices to below what it is trading at.. just shows you how out of touch market is.. primed to fall..
it will go more upon Monday considering the 380% increase in volume comparing with the last 3 months.?
Definitely it's not good to hold at this bounce today...sell before any correction territory occurs in near future
"Next week could be massive sell-off as POWELL said will start tapering by the end of this year, which is couple months away...market 'll be crashed soon...good time to take profits before too late....as heavy correction ahead...."
This will open at 275 to 280 tomorrow morning and then it go higher ....look at all companies that have beat the earning .....

Bullish article by Quartz. Covid19 is speeding the shift to digital accounting for businesses. This will hugely benefit Workday! https://qz.com/1936389/workday-earnings-and-software-subscriptions-rise-due-to-covid-19/?utm_source=YPL
"JUST SOLD ALL MY WDAY POSITION TODAY, IT 'LL BE HARD TO KEEP GOING AT THIS LEVEL"
20% above expected diluted earnings. Beat revenue target. Raised guidance. And down in the after market. I don't get it.
Good time to take profits ahead of POWELL SPEECH that could dampen the stock...
A company regularly losing this much money on a quarterly basis would be way lower without the Cramer promotion.
"I got a chance to research WDAY after 5.5% decline on good earnings that beat expectations. The company's flagship product (HR database) is innovative. It is eating into SAP's vast established customer base. This will continue for next 4 years.WDAY is also the HR database of choice for small companiesWDAY is the defacto HR database for other cloud companies.WDAY expense control is ok. Not bad. Not stellar.WDAY diversification and growth plans are ok. Earnings day selloff was impulsive. The stock has risen from $75 to $225 in little over 2 years. If SPX decides to go towards 3000 - WDAY is bound to cross $200.If SPX instead takes a correction to 2750 before heading to 3000,WDAY could see $155 before heading to $200.Below $150 WDAY becomes a $200 buyout entity. SUMMARYSolid company. Buying opportunity at $180Bigger buying opportunity at $155Very high chance of seeing $200 in 6 months."
WDAY can easily hit 300
"It is a profitable company on a non GAAP basis. ""The company’s net loss widened to $116.3 million, or 52 cents per share, in the first-quarter ended April 30, from $74.4 million, or 35 cents, a year earlier. Excluding items, Workday earned 43 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 41 cents per share"""
"Saleforce, CRM is having strong e/r lately and much much stronger than WDAY ....but give up its gain and up only 2%...caution !"
"MORE VACCINES ROLLING OUTS AND EVERYONE GOES TO WORK, NO NEED WDAY ANYMORE, OR IT 'LL SINK AHEAD, SPECIALLY IN CORRECTION TERRITORY BY THIS YEAR END"
"Of all the stock advice services I have used, I find (http://Fairstox.com) to be one of the absolute best! Their advice is well researched, helpful, and up to date. I don’t know how I ever went about day trading without reading their newsletter first!"
Chance to make money? Let's go PAYO!! Pump it up PAYO is amazing!!

"""Overall, analysts covering the maker of cloud-based human resources and finance software are mostly bullish, with 19 of 28 sporting a ""buy"" or better rating."" - Schaeffer Research (Nov 20, 2020 at 10:36 AM)Bullish article by Schaeffer Research. We can conclude that this is a great moment to get in. Buy the dip! Earnings were great. Cloud computing for finance and HR are the future. Especially now during the pandemic, digital solutions are a must. Thank you Bob Mayering for tipping me on this stock. It is my largest position now.https://www.schaeffersresearch.com/content/news/2020/11/20/workday-stock-stumbles-despite-upbeat-quarterly-report"

"For you who don't understand that WDAY is losing money every quarter and hugely diluting common shareholders. Look at the SEC documents. Here are the net income numbers from WDAY:Jan 2018 -$89.1 million (yes, negative numbers are losses)Apr 2018 -$74.4 millionJul 2018 -$86.2 millionOct 2018 -$153.3 millionThese are huge net losses every quarter, and balance sheet (and especially cash and tangible net assets) are going down every quarter. Common shareholders are in for a surprise on how their common shares are going to lose a lot of value."
HIGH ALERT !!!CRM now is only up 1.5 % after gave up all its gain since yesterday....high caution...!!
Congrats to the longs this is a buy and hold forever stock for me with plenty of secular growth rail winds for the next 30 years!
"So WDAY gains $4.3 billion in market cap instantly on a revenue beat of only $20 million, some of which is due to acquisition of Adaptive Insights. Market reaction defies logic."
CC sounds good
