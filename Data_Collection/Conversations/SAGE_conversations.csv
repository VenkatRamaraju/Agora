I am back here
why is former CEO still getting paid $1.2MM...for his performance?
"Bought a boatload of this boys. Just couldn't resist.Why?Because this is a $100 stock all day, and the only thing keeping it suppressed at these ridiculous price levels is the organized crime racket on wall street, the hedge fund mafia which has the full support and backing of the federal reserve and the SEC. I still suspect they're gonna make all of us pay for buying at these levels, and they won't close their shorts until this is under $30. I have seen the way these guys operate. If you want some good examples, look at what they did to the stock prices of companies like RRC and VALE during their darkest days. Stocks like that don't get that low without criminal collusion and manipulation on a LARGE scale by major players. And you can bet your bottom dollar they were all scooping up millions of shares under $2 on those bad boys.Anyway, let them slam it. I'm in. And I'll triple down under $30 and laugh in their faces when I'm up %200 within a year from then.GLTA"
WSJ 8/26: “Pharma’s Appetite For Biotech Bodes Well”. Good read. Although specific to Pfizer buying Trillium therapeutics…. Article speaks of respect for insider pharmaceutical moves and how those moves should be respected by investors
I just took a position today. I have been a long term investor in BIIB and it’s been a rocky road but I believe in the therapies and what these companies are striving for. The valuations are also compelling. I think WS has been extremely bearish on the sector and overly focused on the recovery stocks and have overlooked the value and importance of the sector. Eventually refocus will occur soon.

"Today’s (10/18) price stinks. However at exactly half way through trading day, volume is less than 100,000 shares. As a contrarian indicator, I call that bullish."
Finally good news on zuranolone! 
"I am so excited about zuranolone. It is just a completely new angle for treating depression. It tanked on ""poor data"" for improvements in depression. That was dumb though and means people don't understand how bad all antidepressants are. Antidepressants need to be given daily and usually for at least 9 months and longer. If i can trial a two week drug first... even if it only helps 1 in 10 people, I'm going to try that before committing the person to a year of treatment. Furthermore, no clinician will care how effective it is if it gets fda approval for post partum depression. Every pcm in America will be prescribing it. Its painful telling a depressed new mom the options we currently have. If there is the slimmest chance itll help her, I'm prescribing it. Its so hard to get a drug that's studied in breast feeding moms and they have already done it with zulresso (32 hr continuous iv infusion). Zuranolone is the oral synthetic form. My only hang up with it is, that once it's approved, I'm going to face the ethical dilemma of divesting so it doesn't effect my practice..."
If you are looking for a good video on SAGE:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRrKeWa0kSI
some little kiddies sell this off AH or PM to give the idea it's dropping. tired of it.
I had a dream last night that sage jump to $84.12 that is as good as anyone else’s advice on this page
2nd Nov results are out. Fingers crossed people!
Omg wish I could short note in June . Record low now and heads to single digit
"Looks like the hedge fund goons are conspiring to drag this back to $30 again.Getting pretty clear that's their game,Can anyone stop them?Unfortunately this isn't a marvel movie. Super man doesn't come to stop Lex Luther when the whole financial sector from the Fed down is populated but Lex Luthers. We've got a criminal culpable of insider trading in charge of the Fed. You think things get BETTER as you go down the ladder? Sad really."
It is a good price to buy
"This bottomed at 40. Should never have gone below 80, and will get back to 80 soon enough.I'll be adding on every dip on the way up. Good luck to all!"
Wow down big glad I shorted it early
Looks like a nice discount to me...why the price cut?
"Let me give you a lesson in facts. On the 5th, SAGE is meeting. On the 5th, SAGE will discuss #Covaxin #WHO #EUL On the 5th, Bharat Biotech will give a presentation at the #SAGE meeting. #SAGE is the prerequisite & last step before the WHO EUL. Some approvals happen before SAGE."
