"Based on earnings and forward earnings, PEG and every other measurable metric i can see this stock is traded at more than double its fair valuation?"
"The analysts are still treating this as an ad-driven print medium, which it is not. Two of them have removed their ""buy"" during the first quarter, while the stock has moved from 32 to 45. They added 587K digital subs in the first quarter and will probably beat that this quarter."
"NYT's gains today outpace the gains of the DOW 30 stocks. That's nice - - thanks NYT for your splendid performance, and valuable service to democracy."
"“Failing” NYT has been one of my top performers since Trump became President. The stock has more than tripled since Jan 2017 !I already sold enough to get my investment out and now riding on profits. This begs the question: Who’s failing, NYT or Trump ?Over 60 mil have already voted despite overt voter suppression by Republicans in red states and stood hours in line.Trump and Republicans will pay a heavy price on Nov 3."
Solid quarter... staying on track regardless of the Dark Sides best effort to shoot you down... I’m proud of all you and so are my families 5 generations going back to Ellis Island.
"Someone (Morgan Stanley) finally noticed. Initiating coverage today with an ""overweight"" rating and a price target of 55, they noted -as I have been pointing out here - that this company is no longer driven by print circulation and advertising, but by digital subscriptions. They project 12-13 million paid digital subs by 2025. At the current subscription rates, 12 million subs would produce revenue in excess of $2bn per year. My own back-of-the-envelope estimate is that they will show about $190 million in digital subscription revenues when they report on Nov. 4. Needless to say, as subs grow and as economic conditions improve, advertising revenues should also rebound."
"Wow The New York Times (NYT), which was called 'failing' by Trump just before it tripled in price, just set a new 52-week-high on Friday! Thanks for your superior content, NYT, and thanks for the excellent stock perfomance!"
"On a hunch I bought 1000 shares of NYT soon after Trump inauguration in 2017. At today’s price, I have doubled. Thank you “failing” NYT. I am also a subscriber to this iconic publication. Keep up the good work and keep reminding that WH Buffoon and his cronies that a free press is not the enemy of the state. Trump is."
"NYT has closed higher for 10 trading days in a row, moving from 39.93 on Nov.18 to 46.24 at the moment. This is definitely under accumulation and 50 is a possibility soon."
"Fantastic performance from our dear New York Times, protector of freedom and democracy! Bravo!"
"Unfortunately, the outstanding New York Times will be hurt by Trump's out-of-control trade war tariffs. They are stifling GDP growth in the US, as evidence by the stock prices of 3M, CAT, US Steel, STLD, and other US businesses. My associates at The Institute and I must say that this Trump fellow doesn't know what he is doing."
"Look at it this way Stevie. My investment in the “failing” NYT in Feb 2017 has tripled. So who is failing NYT or Trump?TAKE.YOUR.TIMEAnd President Elect Joe Biden on Nov 3, 2020!"
"During this Trump Great Depression, the NYT is one of my best performing stocks, by far. Thanks NYT, for making me healthy, wealthy, and wise!"
"Once again, our NYT stock outperforms the US DOW on the upside! Bravo for NYT and bravo for our Endowment Fund!"
"During the second quarter, their digital subscription revenue increased from $112.63 million to $145.98 million. Which is unsurprising since I was paying $4.00 a month for my digital subscription last year and am now paying $15 a month. If they continue to add digital subs at 600 - 700,000 per quarter and are able, over the course of a year to increased their rates while retaining, say, 500,000 of the new additions, the implications are clear: Advertising revenues (which, in a normal economy, would be increasing as the audience increases) will almost become irrelevant. My calculations suggest that during this quarter digital subscription revenues should approach $190 million. Meanwhile - perhaps due to Trump's repeated assertions that the NYT is ""failing"" - the short position remains lodged at about 15% of the float."
"New 52-week high for NYT today. Congratulations, shareholders, especially the ones who saw their investment triple since 2016. Nice."
"Despite being what Russian appointee Trump termed as ""failing,"" the New York Times made another 52-week high again. It's good that investors in NYT are being rewarded as their investment protects our democracy from Russian trolls (Dave, Barrry, bad-William, etc - - all the same troll) from their Putin-inspired propaganda."
"Ad revenues up 66.4% for the quarter, projected to climb another 30-35% in the next quarter. 8 million digital NYT subscribers the most desirable audience for travel, real estate, books. entertainment, etc."
Great news for NYT regarding digital subscribers. Despite what Trump says the NYT is one of the best sources of real news and of keeping the public informed in this country.
"Thankfully, another Trump-inspired domestic terrorist was caught. Unfortunately, agents fear he is only the tip-of-the-iceberg in Trump's and Putin's war against American freedoms. https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/20/politics/coast-guard-mass-killing-hit-list/index.html"
