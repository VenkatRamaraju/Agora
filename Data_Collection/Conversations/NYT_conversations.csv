"The Hill has a story about the President complaining of illegal votes, but in the title of the report says its unfounded. Yet California was ordered to deliver notices to a million voters who had duplicate names, or duplicate addresses, or who had already died. According to sources, 11 California counties have more registered voters, than people of voting age. Why is the Times taking a back seat in this, and enabling fraudulent voting. Why does the Times value the vote of someone cheating, more than someone who works and pays taxes. The Times doesn't realize that many of the people coming here, or the people cheating at the polls don't have respect for free speech, and many other American values. One day they'll wake up, and have to submit everything they print to the government for approval. Apparently, the Times hasn't thought this through."
"You learn something everyday. DeBlasio says the tallest candidate always wins.You gotta hope and pray that DeBlasio does not, and does not do to the nation what he did to New York.Homeless has gone up from 51,000 in early 2014 to 61,849. That's a 21% increase, while nationwide the number has been dropping. DeBlasio intends to tax the rich, yet he's worth a cool 1.5 million. He is much wealthier than the average US citizen. Warren Wilhelm Jr, wow, do you know that he was asked why so few homeless people were offered a chance in a housing project, and he bellowed ""Not during my workout."" He was elected by getting 8.5% of New York Voters. Those are the officials and developers and friends and insiders who are profiting from his election.. And what of Chirlane McCray, who has no idea where 850 million dollars government dollars for a mental health program was lost. She should not be allowed to leave the city, until she finds it."
"New 52-week high for NYT today. Congratulations, shareholders, especially the ones who saw their investment triple since 2016. Nice."
The dynamic duo of NYT and WaPo keeps exposing the deep rooted corruption within the Trump administration. It’s a pity WaPo is privately held. Maybe Bezos should consider making it a publicly traded company ???
"Today, Charlie Gasparino said White millennials are the reason the left has gone to socialism.Its partly true. Its not their fault though. Teachers, college professors and Hollywood elites, and newspaper editors, devoid of values push the ""for me"" movement. Someone needs to take a millennial by the hand, and explain to them that the house they are living in was created and purchased by the wealth created by someone who actually did work. Not by someone who could only mutter :give me-give me-give me"""
Expensive stock 1) Earnings boosted by a temporary reduction in tax to 10% set to revert to 25%. 2) Risky move to raise subscription prices instead of focusing on just new subscriber conversion. $17 is a big psychological jump from $15 and they may eat into any growth next quarter 3) digital advertising still in decline. Is it really worth the current PE??
There are “Trump for Sale” signs posted in world capitals. Every world leader knows it’s easy to throw money at the Trumps and get what they want.
"Hunter Biden sat on the board of Ukraine energy giant Burisma Holdings, lacking any credible experience.During an investigation, Joe threatened to withhold a billion in aid to the country, if they didn't change prosecutors.Then later publicly bragged about it. Hunter received millions of dollars for the position. This is what liberals do. They use their power to enrich family, and friends. Why does the Times stand silent on public corruption ?The President should be calling every country, where Biden went, and where Hillary helped after getting Foundation contributions.Its not just Joe Biden and family who prospered from 8 years of corruption. Theres a long long list."
"6 people conspired to kindnap gov Whitmer. While dozens of China and Soros funded companies and people plan to take over the US.If those 6 people are jailed, so should NYT, FB, Twitter, and MSFT execs, Brennan, Comey, Hillary and Soros. They should all have arrest warrants issued for sedition."

Anyone who didn’t invest in NYT a few years ago missed out a lot. Trump has unwittingly been great for NYT. Love the publication and the stock. Been a subscriber for over 30 years.
"The NYT was deeply disappointed the CDC did not perform contact tracing for whoever was in contact with or whoever gave the President the virus. They would have loved to know who everyone was with. They love spying on people. But why do we still contact tracing ? Especially from an event 10 days ago. You wear a mask, wash your hands, and if you get it, you'll get therapeutics. And if you are a child, you won't even know you have it. Less than 300 people per state are in intensive care. Its like the flu now. The only contact tracing should be for nursing home exposure. And of course we all know the 5 governors who pushed covid patients into nursing homes. If not for them, we'd have 50% fewer deaths. FACT."
"Dozens of suitcases filled with ballots were delivered overnight in Detroit.Did they have postmarks ? I didn't know the USPS used suitcases.I didn't know their carriers delivered mail in the middle of the night.Hopefullly this delivery, and some of the envelopes without postmarks are on video.There will be mail fraud grand juries and sentencing for years."

"Okay, I can't resist: YTD, ""the failing New York Times"" is up 44%. Fox Corporation is down 32%. Trump was crowing about the fact that his Tulsa speech was the highest rated speech in Fox's history. This was because none of the other network outlets covered it live. Even I was watching it on Fox, I'll confess. I also slow down to look at traffic accidents."

"The Penn Stater magazine has a story about tariffs from one of their professors. Buehler has said how harmful tariffs are, and how after the US imposed tariffs on China, China reciprocated. he didn't mention how China doesn't impose tariffs on a lot of goods, just simply not allow many to be imported. And some autos have small tariffs, but spare parts have extremely high tariffs. WHy wouldn't an economics professor agree that while some goods may rise in cost, as millions of Americans get jobs, and their wages go higher, many of them will no longer collect welfare, have heating bill assistance, get food stamps, and many of these people not only will stop receiving government assistance, but be PAYING TAXES. Why doesn't the Times stand up for all these people ? Why do they stand for the billionaires, and handful of companies that profit at the expense of 10 million smaller companies ?"
"My associates at The Institute have just informed me that every employee of our fair institution will receive a 10-year subscription to The New York Times! Bravo, NYT, for your brilliant work!"
THE BIG HEADWINDS FOR THE NYT1) CEILING ON SUBSCRIBER BASE. YES they can grow but they will hit a max. NYT print is not Netflix. It appeals to more intelligent literate people and they represent age a far smaller pool that for DIS or NETFLIX. So they growth cannot be sustained. 2) LUXURY for the next 2 years is a dead market. Just look at retail on Mad Ave. And they are Major advertisers on NYT - with print and digital and they will negotiate rates hard or withdraw as sales do not justify big spend.Nothing in NYT to support such a high stock price. You can't Buy out the NYT as well with voting control tied up. A High rise stock in the environment and if there is a sell off in the market back to the 20s
"Added a spectacular 669,000 digital subscribers during the second quarter. In fact, the increase in digital sub income totally offset the predictable dropoff in advertising revenues. Most of these new subs start out at the $1 a week promotional rate and then, after a year, are moved up to one of the higher rates ...and the retention rate is remarkably low. So you have a thriving paid subscription model with the likelihood of a recovery in advertising revenues. This is still under the radar. Only a couple of questions from analysts on the conference call. Bought some more today."
"How about Tom Steyer, diffusing a confrontation between Bernie and Elizabeth. Warren, who claimed to be of native American descent to get a job, among other things, also said she lost a job due to pregnancy, while transcripts of the vote show the school board continued her job. Tom made his fortune from fossil fuels.He helped delay the Keystone to help the pipeline company he invested in from having competition. He also created shell companies, to hide his ownership in coal companies. he also remained invested in Baker Hughes long after he promised to divest. Like many liberals, he made his wealth, and now wants to keep everyone else from succeeding. Hey Tom, if you want to save the planet, start up a clean up company and fund it with your money. Don't penalize the rest of us for the pollution that was created for your wealth."

"Its obvious Pelosi is rushing the impeachment process. No open hearings. No laws broken. But its not for ethics. Its to protect a billionaire, a convicted felon, who used the Ukraine to steal billions. The closer the world comes to finding out about the corruption, the harder the left tries to keep it hidden. Sadly, left politicians know when this guy is outed again, their donations with trickle to a halt. They will do anything for Georgie boy, and so will the Times. And good time Charlie isn't aware or doesn't care how his investment is helping protect one of the worst humans on the planet. For if he did, he would dump his shares, like a bowel movement."
"Yahoo Finance keeps telling us how Biden will tank the stock market.As usual, Yahoo Finance is lying to your face. For you see, under Biden, there will be a big push to socialism, as agreed to with Bernie and Liz, and his biggest donors. Under socialism, there is no stock market.All industry is owned and regulated by the government. Biden won't tank the market. he help will eliminate it. And shareholders will have their wealth taken by the government. That is socialism."

I Remember when Fake News CNN - MSNBC- NBC- ABC- CBS- NYT- Washington Post all said this about President Trump the past 2+ years. 1. Trump would never be elected.2. They said if Trump was elected the stock market would crash.3. They said Trump would be impeached within the first three months of his presidency. 4. They said he would be impeached after Mueller found Russian collusion. And they wonder why President Trump and smart people call them Fake News now. You all lie to us daily or spin the real facts. Shame on all of you. Sorry if truth hurts but you earned the title as Fake News. $NYT $BA $HD $GE $CSCO $K $GM $F
NYT facing huge law suit for false report on deaths at a private nursing home in New Jersey. Nursing home may face bankruptcy as a result of fake report by the Times. Their reputation has been destroyed.
"During WWII, the US freed China from Japanese oppression and unthinkable acts.Soon China is ending 1 million troops to kill US soldiers in N Korea. Later they send billions in aide, logistics, training and weapons to help kill US soldiers in S Vietnam.Clinton let China in the WTO, and showed their top generals our most secret military installations as a reward for NP Lap Seng and Charlie Tre giving millions to his campaign.Bush gave China PNTR, and then the bottom falls out. Obama wrote executive orders that helped Steyer and Soros garner billions, while Bidens son reaped a fortune from them. Now we have China buying technology company stock as a deep discount. These companies will have to fear China selling it at any time, and will must do as they are told.China corrupted the WTO, the WHO, the Voice of America, many college professors, and the NYT.We have been invaded by the virus months ago. We've been invaded by China decades ago, in stealth."
"The mayor of Hazleton, Cusat, has called for a curfew. The Luzerne County manager has asked the state for the National Guard to help impose it. These people are trying to save lives. Meanwhile, we don't know where DiBlasio is, never hear from him, and he continues to flip a finger at Cuomo. When Pelosi runs her impeachment inquiry about the handling of the Virus, every Mayor twiddling their thumbs will be called in to tell the committees why they didn't respond when the numbers started to skyrocket. Its really sad to see the citizens of New York be hurt by having their jobs sent overseas, more recently the streets are filled with bad people because of the parole law, and now people are dying because a Mayor is marching to the agenda, and will no doubt be blaming others, when he sat there. And the Times says nothing. They can't They aren't allowed to. But Times employees will die from corona. oh well, to the left, whatever it takes, how ever many must die, they will do what they have to, to reach their goal. This will go on for months. A FULL SHUTDOWN WOULD HAVE STOPPED IT IN 3 WEEKS."

"Despite being what Russian appointee Trump termed as ""failing,"" the New York Times made another 52-week high again.

"After falsely claiming Trump worked with the Russians, we now find out Hunter Biden was given at least 3.5 million dollars from the wife of the Mayor of Moscow. The report, just skimming the surface of the Burisma cesspool, does not say how this money changed US policy. Yet the Ambassador to the Ukraine, the deep state, Biden and Obama himself all plotted to keep Trump from being President. That is a change in US policy. And so is firing the lead investigator to corruption. This is the start of bringing to light how the left moves money around, to enrich itself. As said before, Hillary was an apprentice to Joe Biden, in the scheme of corruption. This laundered money now being used to tear apart the country, so that old men can have relations with little children, and those in power, can steal even more. Joe isnt running to help minorities. He is now in it, to help hide the untold corruption that hasn't even been found yet. He's running to keep his son and family and friends out of jail."

"Hallmark employees about 16,000 people. This privately run company will soon be forced to make major changes. The first thing the House of Reps did just now was forbid the use of mother, father, daughter, son, grandfather, grandmother, or any other gender adjective/noun. Hillary forbid these words in the State Dept when taking bribes for the Foundation. Soon the Pope will call the use of Mother and Father as hate speech, and Hallmark will have to redo all of their cards that refer to gender, and add theys and thems, due to the school system pushing 8 year old boys and girls to trans gender. Dont think this is being done to make them happy. Many children regret it, reverse it, hate it, or have a life time of problems. Anyway, its being done, to help keep people focused on marijuana and sex and personal pleasure, instead of thinking of a loving family, respecting other people, and achieving satisfaction at work, and making something out of your life.

Under Diblasio, public school pass rates have dropped from 77 to 72 in one year for Ebglish, and from 66 to 62 for algebra. WHy would DiBlasio not want students to learn English ?The left says they want to end tribalism (forget all about your heritage, forget about where you came from), but for some reason want people to speak the language of their ancestors. The left really doesn't care about ending tribalism. They just want to separate and divide us. Multiple languages isn't helping poor and undereducated children get jobs. But they want people dependant on government."

With a 50% drop in ad revenues for next quarter why does NYT keep rising ?
Both NYT and WaPo are American icons. Without their cutting edge investigative reporting on Trump and his administration’s blatant misdeeds we would not know.

"While Ginsburgs body was still warm, Schumer demanded her replacement take place after the election.This is what liberals are all about. THEY DONT CARE ABOUT PEOPLE. THEY CARE ABOUT POWER."
"70 years ago, Chinese forces went into North Korea, in response to an alleged threat of the US entering Chinese territory. This being 5 years after the end of WWII, where the US helped liberate China from Japanese treachery. Till this day, China is still stealing from us, take our jobs, our cash, bad deals from corrupt politicians, and attempts by the Chinese to interfere with our election. Why would a country so indebted to us, turn around and pay NIH officials, WHO officials, hundreds of college professors, and many corporate executives in order to hurt the country that saved it from a hundred years of oppression under Japan. WHy in the world would the NYT embrace such corrupt economic systems as socialism and communism, when they can see the only way any of them thrive is to steal from the US. If other ways are so great, why must everyone either receive aid from us, or rob us blind."
"Fake News- Telegraph to Pay Melania Trump ‘Substantial’ Damages for Article.“We apologise unreservedly to The First Lady and her family for any embarrassment caused by our publication of these allegations,” the Telegraph article said. “As a mark of our regret we have agreed to pay Mrs. Trump substantial damages as well as her legal costs.” Will NYT Be next to write big check for Fake News story ?$$$$"
"I watched the New York governor talk about a possible impending patient explosion. Does he know China built several large pole style buildings, with sheet metal, in weeks, to temporarily house patients in a city ? Does he know there are 1,800 school buildings in New York City, and many of them could be used temporarily to house patients. NYC does not have to build 200 permanent hospitals that won't open for 5 years. They can easily have accommodations ready weeks from now. He also talked about ventilators. They don't have to buy thousands of expensive 25 to $50,000 hospital style ones. They can buy portable ones for around 5,000. In an emergency, not everyone can or needs to have their own room and the best equipment. Governor, think outside the box. You did do a good job talking about bringing in retired doctors."
"CNN Fake News is a joke. Still, even as the Democratic Party scrambled to figure out what to do, CNN, the facts first, ‘this is an apple’ news network, decided to just label Democratic Ralph Northam a Republican in a video the governor’s office issued last evening on the matter. It was an apple, but CNN decided it was a banana regarding Northam’s party affiliation. You cannot make this up. If this was an honest error, it’s still embarrassing. CNN and other covered the 2017 elections. They basked in the glory of the blue wave that crashed last year. And they thought Northam was a Republican. The Democrat-media complex is hard at work, but they cannot spin this. CNN earned Fake news network title with this type of recording."
"Most on this NYT message board are not familiar with it, but in June Stevie shared with me that for the last 6 years posters Stevie and William have been together. I just pay no mind to their Unamerican chat, and I will say nothing against their relationship; indeed that is their perfect right and choice. So good for them."
"Subscriptions at $4.00 a week is like giving away Pennysaver supermarket circulars. Sooner or later, 'subscribers' will cancel (like I did). This stock is a turkey, like the company's columnists and reporters."

"Baltimore receives over 17 billion a year in federal assistance. With a population of 600,000, and a poverty rate of 22%, that means everyone living in poverty receives about 100,000 a year in various forms of assistance. Cummings had the chance to help pass funding for infrastructure improvement, which would have put many in the Baltimore area working, and paying taxes, instead of being dependent on the government. When someone criticized someone who has been a failure for decades, it is not racism. Its the truth. Cummings should stop insulting the President and work with him, instead of laying Baltimore to waste, so that he can garner another 6 years. Recently the Pres had agreed to meet with the NAACP. At the last minute, they changed the meeting day. And people are saying the Pres refused to meet with the Blacks. Don't rely on the Times for news. Don't you see they are all working together, to make the Pres look bad. The question is, why would you invest in a newspaper, that is owned by someone from Mexico, and orders his staff to print stories that help his business and wealth ?"
On 1/20/2017 the day Trump was officiated as President the NYT closed at $13.35. Yesterday’s closing price was $44.36. One of the 2 is failing and it’s not the NYT. One of the best investment in my portfolio.
why is this trading at 50x current and forward earnings with a PEG of 9? someone please explain this crazy valuation.

"Joe Biden went to Iowa, thinking there were alien crop circles there. All he found was half a dozen reporters sitting in painted circles. Bumbling Biden is blaming Trump for unrest in the cities, yet Bidens staff bails out looters and building burners every time they get arrested."
"Wow The New York Times (NYT), which was called 'failing' by Trump just before it tripled in price, just set a new 52-week-high on Friday! Thanks for your superior content, NYT, and thanks for the excellent stock perfomance!"
"I read the news every day. I am very interested in the economy and the decision makers that can impact it. You might say, that I am interested in any news organization that has a balanced firm grasp on economics and can represent both sides in evenly. As I'm online looking for interesting articles to read, I find myself avoiding anything from new york times, washington post, cnn and fox. It never was this way. It started with fox then spread to cnn, both of which are blocked from my view. Now I am considering nyt and wp since the spin is so obvious. thank you in advance for telling me I'm a wps - back at you..."
"Here are Biden's campaign issues from 1972...His campaign issues focused on withdrawal from Vietnam, the environment, civil rights, mass transit, more equitable taxation, health care, the public's dissatisfaction with politics-as-usual, and ""change"". Sounds like he hasn't accomplished much in almost half a century in public office."
Donald Trump should be President of the United States for Life. We love him here at the NYT !
Great news for NYT regarding digital subscribers. Despite what Trump says the NYT is one of the best sources of real news and of keeping the public informed in this country.
"Anonymous sources say that subscribers to the New York Times, and investors, are being investigated for trying to subvert our government and overthrow the President."

"Unfortunately, the outstanding New York Times will be hurt by Trump's out-of-control trade war tariffs. They are stifling GDP growth in the US, as evidence by the stock prices of 3M, CAT, US Steel, STLD, and other US businesses. My associates at The Institute and I must say that this Trump fellow doesn't know what he is doing."
"The one world government is promoted by the left. And the official language will be Chinese.One of the first goals of the left, and the one world government, will be the Lowering, or Elimination of the age of consent.While some moderates will deny this, this is the goal of many on the left, and media like the NYT, and will be implemented within weeks of the formation of the new government. That's just the beginning."

"The analysts are still treating this as an ad-driven print medium, which it is not. Two of them have removed their ""buy"" during the first quarter, while the stock has moved from 32 to 45. They added 587K digital subs in the first quarter and will probably beat that this quarter."
I look forward to their daily emails each morning that list pre-market movers based on thoroughly researched stock market and world news. I highly I don’t know how I ever traded without using (http://Thetraderguide.com)! recommend anyone who invests in the stock market!
"Many on the left, including the Times, are in denial about losing the election. They blame Russian meddling. Yet when the DNC was hacked, the FBI did not possess, and look at all the info on the Crowdstrike server. The DNC said ""don't worry about it"", and Obama did nothing. Our President, in order to stop meddling, asked Zelenskyy to look into where the server is in the Ukraine, and to get it. And to get a fair prosecutor. Zelenskyy said he was appointing all his own people, in order ""to drain the swamp."" He also appointed a new ambassador to the US. There was no offer to Ukraine if they did anything. In fact, trump told him Germany gives Ukraine nothing, except for empty words from Merkel. We all see why the left is upset. When they get that server, many people will be implicated and jailed, and the Times will have to look for new sources of corruption to help foster and protect. Later, Trump asked him to look into Biden, as he was bragging about stopping the prosecution. That was obviously obstruction of justice, when Biden withheld 1 billion in aide, unless that original prosecutor was fired. Who does the Times work for ? Its not for hard working Americans, that's for sure."
"wow. 300 million dollars. and all to help us have a better life.yeah, right. Bloomberg spent 300 million. but hes doing it so warren or Bernie don't get elected. A 2% wealth tax, would cost Bloomberg 940 million a year. People who have billions spend their life keeping the government from getting it. That's a fact.300 million could have been 3,816 for every homeless person in New York. Liberals care not about the poor, only enriching themselves."
"Another democrat now acknowledges the problem at the border. recently, billions of dollars were approved to help the crisis there. Yet WGAL Lebanon York Lancaster Harrisburg, in a public service message. says 1 out of 9 residents of the Susquehanna Valley is hungry. And where are additional funds for the homeless already here. Why doesn't the Times speak out for Americas homeless, and cold, and hungry. Why doesn't the Times say we should improve the lives of all citizens, before spending money on other people. Why has the left turned their backs on Labor Unions, Blacks, the poor, the homeless, the starving. Any decent shareholder would go to a annual shareholders meeting, and demand the Times start fighting for the poor already here."
"“Failing” NYT has been one of my top performers since Trump became President. The stock has more than tripled since Jan 2017 !I already sold enough to get my investment out and now riding on profits. This begs the question: Who’s failing, NYT or Trump ?Over 60 mil have already voted despite overt voter suppression by Republicans in red states and stood hours in line.Trump and Republicans will pay a heavy price on Nov 3."
"Based on fingerprint analysis there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official, or First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, was involved in seeking confidential Federal Bureau of Investigation background reports of former White House staff from prior administrations of President Bush and President Reagan."
"President Trump’s transparency is driving left-wing Democrats not messing up their impeachment dreams. “He wasn't supposed to release the transcripts. Or the whistleblower report. He was expected to do what any president would have done – what President Obama always did. Hide the evidence,” former Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) writes. House Democrats “weren't counting on the president's unprecedented transparency. Nobody releases a transcript of calls between heads of state. But Donald Trump did.” Read the transcript because fake news is lying to you and so are the Democrats. MAGA 4 more years coming. $BAC $FB $NYT $BA $GM $F"
"I've long wondered why Obama catered to the brotherhood and Iran, vs the likes of Saudi Arabia and other countries. Take a look at this story, and how Obama had his name changed over the years, and why Iranians were dancing in the streets when he was elected, and why he hired Valerie Jarrett as an advisor. Also, at the beginning of the story is reasons why he gave up his Illinois Bar license, and could never be a supreme court nominee of joe biden.https://citizenwells.com/2012/04/09/obama-illinois-bar-application-fraud-obama-lied-about-drug-use-other-names-and-tickets-andy-martin-complaint-letter-to-il-attorney-registration-disciplinary-commission/"
"NYT is branching in numerous directions. They can break into the profitable conference world, especially when affluent and well-educated readers can travel together and meet each other and produce more future affluent readers. Are NYT cruises and yoga retreats with David Brooks out of the question?With Google and FB soon having to give back some of the ad revenues they stole from content creators, NYT could grab some of the portals' ridiculous market cap. If Google, Twitter, & FB will have to police their content, they will naturally focus on the safe, established sources. And this is the greyest lady of them all, but her grandkids have successfully taught her how to get on the internet."
Upgrades on the way.
I believe ULTIMATSTOKCALERTS has the awesome trading suggestions. look them up .
"After sending thousands of sick seniors to nursing homes, and exposing thousands more to the virus, Cuomo now says ""the data"" will determine if schools open."" Yet the data is, only .06 % of all deaths are people under 17. That is less than 1 person in a thousand. Cuomo isn't fit to be governor, or even a sanitary engineer for the state of new york. he is the one messing with your children.Maybe there is some good. When de blasio defunds the Police, it won't be safe for your kids at the bus stop."
"During this Trump Great Depression, the NYT is one of my best performing stocks, by far. Thanks NYT, for making me healthy, wealthy, and wise!"

I will be alright. That's good mommy, but I wasn't worried about you, I was worried about losing my inheritance. LOL Chelsea, just like a Clinton, always thinking of themselves. Don't worry, because the Times will run stories when needed to help sway public opinion. I only lose elections. Ok, thanks mommy, say hi to Mark T next time you have orders for him to publish something. nighty night."

"Someone (Morgan Stanley) finally noticed. Initiating coverage today with an ""overweight"" rating and a price target of 55, they noted -as I have been pointing out here - that this company is no longer driven by print circulation and advertising, but by digital subscriptions. They project 12-13 million paid digital subs by 2025. At the current subscription rates, 12 million subs would produce revenue in excess of $2bn per year. My own back-of-the-envelope estimate is that they will show about $190 million in digital subscription revenues when they report on Nov. 4. Needless to say, as subs grow and as economic conditions improve, advertising revenues should also rebound."
"Another splendid day for shareholders of The New York Times. Bravo, dear shareholders, marvelous job of stock-picking, indeed!"
"Great earnings for the ""failing"" New York Times and the stock hits a new 52-week high. In the last 3 years, the ""failing"" New York Times has tripled. LOL. That probably makes the ignorant Trumptards very angry. LOL."
"Cuomo wrote another book. Apparently bragging about his covid response. So who paid him up front, to write a story about how he is personally responsible for over half the New York covid deaths. When Atty Barr brings in indictments against him, thousands of them, he will have to forfeit that up front payment, and they should use it to send checks to the survivors of his carnage. Some people think Cuomo got that book advance as a reward for his contribution to the agenda. People don't do bad things without expecting to be rewarded. Lets see if Wolf, and the other 3 Governors who sent covid patients to nursing homes get some book deals soon."
"I'm a TRUMP supporter through and through, voted for him in 2016 and I'll be voting for him again in 2020. I worked at The New York Times for 30 years in the circulation dept. and I retired with 3500 shares in 2013 when it was 13.00/share. The New York Times company is not, I say NOT only the newspaper and website, they have a wide ranging basket of companies in their portfolio."
"The editorial page is supposed to be a place, where different views and opinions are heard.It used to be a place of joy for liberals who wanted to speak of different thoughts and ideas.Sadly, now that liberals run and own the NYT, the NYT no longer is interested in variety and diversity.Its only interested in goosestepping to the agenda and serving their master billionaires. So much for freedom."

Its difficult to believe the Times since they add opinion to everything. Nothing worse than letting people with no knowledge make decisions for the rest. The Times has no credibility and have lost more readers than they realize. That's a nice balance in that offshore account. Amazing how people can be bought.
"For 7 minutes, the President didn't hear about Ginsburg's death. Big Flipping deal. The Times didn't release their story until 2 hours ago, fully an hour after Hillary woke up, and posted on twitter about it.The Times knew, and didn't tell anyone for over an hour. They probably purposely waited."
New York Times is up 7.16% to 35.75
"During the second quarter, their digital subscription revenue increased from $112.63 million to $145.98 million. Which is unsurprising since I was paying $4.00 a month for my digital subscription last year and am now paying $15 a month. If they continue to add digital subs at 600 - 700,000 per quarter and are able, over the course of a year to increased their rates while retaining, say, 500,000 of the new additions, the implications are clear: Advertising revenues (which, in a normal economy, would be increasing as the audience increases) will almost become irrelevant. My calculations suggest that during this quarter digital subscription revenues should approach $190 million. Meanwhile - perhaps due to Trump's repeated assertions that the NYT is ""failing"" - the short position remains lodged at about 15% of the float."
"very sad to have to admit that the onion & infowars is more credible now than NYT, SHORT IT!"
"When you were 7, you remember your mom telling you about grandma. How she and her husband worked hard, so that your mom would have the good life, a good future. You grew up, had a family, and told your children about your mom. Then your children had kids, and your children told your grandchildren all you did for them. Only now, instead of loving their parents and grandparents, the children of today have been told they got their wealth by exploiting people. That none of that hard work, and unlimited love mattered. So you, grandma, are watching the riots on TV, and you see your grandson burning something. You report him. Good for you. When he gets out, you tell him that burning and looting is not the reason you had children, and not the reason their parents had children. They can be helped, and you grandmom and you mom, have to awaken from the dream you are in, and say no to the evil in the world."
Should I read the Times today or watch the Hallmark Channel? Both seem to view reality through the same lens.

"Now that the voting is done, several states which allowed late mail in votes know how many votes they need to win. In some states, its not very many. So now there are voting fraud centers set up in different states, and the AG was able to insert several operatives. They have been filming people fill out phony mail votes. Once those mail in ballots are dropped in the mail box, or dropped at the Post Office, each of them will be guilty of committing felonies. Operatives have also been filming buses bringing people in from other states, and they know the bus number, the bus driver, and who hired the bus, and they know everyone on the bus. Its good that the Federal Govt has been reducing prisoner counts over the last decade. This organized crime of election fraud is going to be locking dozens of people for a long long time."
