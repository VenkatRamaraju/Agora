It will go high again. I think big money wants it low for now. It’s trying hard to go back up
Elevate Credit is down 8.84% to 4.33
I think the price not moving much over the last year is actually a blessing. It has given me time to add to my position.
I have made some good profits on the stock over the years but I need to see how pulling out of England will hurt the bottomline.
Good er?
I wasnt expecting to be able to get back in at such a significant discount. God is Good!!!
I'm in at 4.72...fingers crossed for earnings to turn this around.

This was a test Hopefully someone at elevate is tracking message boardsTo see if the investing public is even aware of this company I concluded that this stock is not being watched by a serious number of investors and institutions My hope is that the company has a PR plan to increase awareness of the company and its prospects for future growth
ELVT is up 7.08% to 2.57

Just to let you know how cheap this stock is:The company currently has $197 Million in cash and the market cap is $127 Million. No DCF needed. This is a no brainer.
Starting to get close to buy range. $1.65 is where I would really feel comfortable getting back in.

Just a thought…perhaps this company needs a PR firm or should consider advertising their services to the masses via cable TV and internet advertising.With no visibility I think this going to be a longer road to success than 2-3 years.

"First, I'd like to note that over the first quarter, Elevate repurchased 2.5 million shares, roughly 6.5% of our outstanding shares. I won't say a lot here, but clearly we believe our company is very undervalued relative to both current profitability and most certainly profitability we believe is possible in the years ahead.As long as Elevate is undervalued, we will continue to utilize our authorization to repurchase shares."
well those werent exactly stellar earnings were they
