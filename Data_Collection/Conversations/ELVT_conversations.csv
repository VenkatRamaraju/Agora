I have a buy at $3.45. I don’t think it will hit. July 13
Great earnings numbers!
AK where are you??
A steal at this price!
"Hi Steve: Linda Stinson, 10% Owner, sold 146,837 shares of Elevate Credit (ELVT) on Apr 30, 2021, for $491,019. Stinson, after the transactions detailed in the SEC Form 4 filing, controls 3,781,011 shares of company stock of which 2,702,275 shares are held directly and 1,078,736 shares are owned indirectly. The market value of the direct and indirect holdings, based on the prior-day closing price, is approximately $12.25 million."
"Whats going on, it’s still going down more and more any new caused that?"
AK are you here?
Nice steady climb. We are pumping this stock up every 20 days. All 2 or 3 of us for a much traded stock. Seems Steve is mad at the world for some reason.
Elevate Credit is up 9.22% to 3.48
Hey Linda. Can you please stop selling? You must have less than 10% by now. Is there something you want to share with the rest of the class as you nosedive our stock price? Thank you
ELVT is up 6.47% to 4.61
ELVT is down 5.88% to 4.48
I wasn't expecting another good chance to buy this low again. I will wait until after earnings. I hope it drops back to the 3's and I can ride this ride again back to 5's
"Congress Introduces Resolution to Rescind “Fake Lender” Rule that Facilitates Predatory Lenders’ Evasions of State Interest Rate Limits...THURSDAY, MARCH 25, 2021Lisa Stifler330+ groups representing all 50 states and the District of Columbia called for Congress to support a resolution to overturn a rule that helps triple-digit interest rate loans spread across the country by evading state and voter-approved interest rate caps...In June 2020, the District of Columbia Attorney General filed suit against yet another rent-a-bank lender, Elevate Credit, Inc.. The DC Attorney General argued that Elevate is the true lender of loans made in DC, well in excess of the District’s rate cap. Elevate sold two short term loan products to District residents that carried interest rates between 99 and 251%, up to 42 times the legal limit in DC. In two years, Elevate made 2,551 loans to residents well above the maximum interest rate of 24% for lenders that disclose their rate in contracts and 6% for those that do not.Currently, there are only a few of these rogue, predatory lenders, but they will spread to all 50 states if the OCC rule is not overturned. Lenders’ use of online platforms allows them to inundate markets across the United States. By gutting the long-standing anti-evasion doctrine, the OCC’s rule will eviscerate the power of state governments to independently regulate interest rate limits and will have horrible consequences for consumers, small businesses, and especially, communities of color."
I got in at a dollar and hopefully gonna ride this roller coaster to the top LETS MAKE SOME MONEY GUYS !!!
It's hard to read anything positive into their price chart. Anyone have any insight?
I have made some good profits on the stock over the years but I need to see how pulling out of England will hurt the bottomline.
"E, I think it's my turn to go negative, which should drive the price up! lol"
"Tyler = Mr. Head is the voting trustee of The Tyler W.K. Head Trust dated March 20, 2014 (the ""Voting Trust""), which has voting power over the shares held by the Linda and Mike Stinson Irrevocable Asset Trust. Mr. Head as trustee has no pecuniary interest in the Voting Trust shares."
I think the stock will stabilize at $3.50 for a few days and then go up from there.

Bought 10 $2.50 august calls at $1.10. I figured they may do something by then or I’ll execute them before earnings.
Bought more call options for November at $2.50 for $1.19. I hope they all cash in soon. My average option price is just under $1.20 and I'll keep buying the November ones for now.

Amazing that TCV sold 1.4M shares in two or three lots at $3.40 when it was trading at about $3.60 to $3.65. I guess they wanted to get rid of their position.
"Stock awards disclosed for CEO Ken Rees, COO Jason Harvison and CFO Chris Lutes on June 23rd for awards granted May 19th (disclosed almost a month late). If valued at closing price on May 19th of $7.48, worth approx. $4.2 million for CEO and $2.1 million each for COO and CFO. Awards also made to Board members and others. Seems like a lot of expense to add now. Wonder how this might affect Q2 and full-year 2017 earnings projections? #ELVT #ElevateCredit"
"Wow! Those shorts are looking awfully smart right now, aren't they? Yikes. How long can Ken Rees or Jason Harvison hang on?"

I wonder what loan loss statistics are for their target group and how it impacts elevate given they use other people's money?
"Well....the volume is very light. It seems that once Tyler sold all his shares and Linda stopped, the volume dried up. I still think there is a lot of money to be made and we should be at $4.23 - $4.37 range by the end of the year. I hope to cash in on my options which I find to be a deal considering that I can execute them and get the stock at the price that I want a few months down the road."
Anyone know why Sequoia is dumping their position?
Elevate Credit is up 13.69% to 2.74
"strange that no one is interested in this message board, considering it does real business"
"Up 16%..Now we see how long people will hold on for the ride. Do you take a small profit now or hold on for much larger gains in 2018? They are in 17 states now, so the earns will definitely look good in the short-term."
"took a while, but thats nice for us longs"
Will this go up or down tommrow?
This stock has a Zacks Rank of 1 (strong buy). Great buying opportunity at $4.03
"Last time Linda and Tyler submitted something was on April 29, 2021. Sorry Steve, I don’t have an update for you this morning"
Not happy...bought more at $3.40 (July 8 2021) :-(
I think the price not moving much over the last year is actually a blessing. It has given me time to add to my position.

Current company employees (or imposters) coming on the Yahoo thread to pump up the stock. Absolutely hilarious.

"Linda, though Tyler, sold another 58k+ shares from 4/27 to 4/29. Amazing how they are getting rid of shares each and every day. At least it is not the volume they were dumping a few weeks ago. I hope they sell and leave once and for all with ""all in the family"" company. Shame on them."

I am going to try and wait one more day and hope it drops alittle more before I jump back in.
I'm in at 4.72...fingers crossed for earnings to turn this around.
"First, I'd like to note that over the first quarter, Elevate repurchased 2.5 million shares, roughly 6.5% of our outstanding shares. I won't say a lot here, but clearly we believe our company is very undervalued relative to both current profitability and most certainly profitability we believe is possible in the years ahead.As long as Elevate is undervalued, we will continue to utilize our authorization to repurchase shares."
what's going on?

I believe that we will hit $3.80 today 7/7/21. I’m selling and have a buy at $3.65.
Starting to get close to buy range. $1.65 is where I would really feel comfortable getting back in.
"Amit, the drop from $4.47 to $3.50 doesn’t worry you?"
"Seems 1 insider sold 1,5million shares...Anyone got some info on this?The company still looks healthy from what I've been able to find."
"7 shares traded after hours (Aug 18, 2021). 2 at 3.57, 1 at 3.64 and 4 at 3.68. But it looks nice on Yahoo after hours which states +0.11!!! Tomorrow is another day."
I think dropping UK was a good move. Thoughts?
"Wow, it looks like the $6.50 IPO price may have been more accurate than some investors thought."
Bought at $1.69

I was sooooo wrong. 
"I was offered a senior director job at elvt and rejected it. Pay was 215k and lot of equity...at $8 a share that is. GLAD I DIDNT JOIN ! my manager the VP, was a fat white racist and whose reason for hiring for this role was simply to do less dirty work."

Just a thought…perhaps this company needs a PR firm or should consider advertising their services to the masses via cable TV and internet advertising.With no visibility I think this going to be a longer road to success than 2-3 years.
"Earnings per stock: 2017: 0,16, 2018: 0,28, 2019: 0,59, 2020: 0,87, 2021 Q1: 0,34.So earnings per stock are rising already several years.In 2018 this stock almost hit 11 dollar.Can somebody explain to me why this stock looks so cheap.Ok, there is a lot of insider selling. But they also did this before the good Q1 report."
Bought 10 more$2.50 call options for november at $1.15.

Good morning .... earnings are out this morning and stock is down over 11%. I did buy shares at 3.52 near the open and also bought 2.5 November calls at $1.15 (but only 10 to see what happens in the next few days).
