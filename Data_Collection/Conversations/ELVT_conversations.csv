"First, I'd like to note that over the first quarter, Elevate repurchased 2.5 million shares, roughly 6.5% of our outstanding shares. I won't say a lot here, but clearly we believe our company is very undervalued relative to both current profitability and most certainly profitability we believe is possible in the years ahead.As long as Elevate is undervalued, we will continue to utilize our authorization to repurchase shares."
"E, I think it's my turn to go negative, which should drive the price up! lol"
Just a thoughtâ€¦perhaps this company needs a PR firm or should consider advertising their services to the masses via cable TV and internet advertising.With no visibility I think this going to be a longer road to success than 2-3 years.
Bought at $1.69

Almost time to start a new position. I have always made money with this stock in the 3's.
Starting to get close to buy range. $1.65 is where I would really feel comfortable getting back in.
happy to see some new names here!
Cool Biz Model. Profitable. Small Float. Unusual Volume. Hmmm
"if yahoo stats are correct, this $134 million market cap stock has $105 million in cash on the balance sheet."
"If I read it right, a major beat."
This was a test Hopefully someone at elevate is tracking message boardsTo see if the investing public is even aware of this company I concluded that this stock is not being watched by a serious number of investors and institutions My hope is that the company has a PR plan to increase awareness of the company and its prospects for future growth

Hey cartoon boy.......how many shares did Linda and Tyler sell before the earnings announcement?
Is today's uptick a prelude to good earnings? Or is it those in the know helping their friends get out before the earnings?
a few technical signals pointing to more upward movement. next week should be decent
New CEO should help make this great growth stock become more visible to the big institutions.
A forward P/E of 4.38 with growth and positive Earnings. WOW!
Just to let you know how cheap this stock is:The company currently has $197 Million in cash and the market cap is $127 Million. No DCF needed. This is a no brainer.
"strange that no one is interested in this message board, considering it does real business"
