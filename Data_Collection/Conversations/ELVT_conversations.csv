"so Mr. Head is the voting trustee of The Tyler W.K. Head Trust dated March 20, 2014 (the ""Voting Trust""), which has voting power over the shares held by the Linda and Mike Stinson Irrevocable Asset Trust.

"Wow, it looks like the $6.50 IPO price may have been more accurate than some investors thought."
This was a test Hopefully someone at elevate is tracking message boardsTo see if the investing public is even aware of this company I concluded that this stock is not being watched by a serious number of investors and institutions My hope is that the company has a PR plan to increase awareness of the company and its prospects for future growth
what's going on?
Worldwide economies are slowing down and Elevated is a perfect company to take advantage of this current financial turmoil around world!!! Check all my previous post. I have been spot on with when to buy and when to sale.

Let's thank Linda for the tanking of the stock. Maybe she will just walk away with all her money and leave us to recuperate our losses and get back to gains.

Yikes! Placed on a Zacks sell list. That's not going to help.

building up for breakout
Nice day...fighting off Linda and her henchman Tyler. I hope they leave soon and let the stock go up. Looking forward to May when earnings come out. Up 4.8% today. (at last a little up volume)
Bought some shares at $3.67 and $3.66 in the past 5 minutes. They’ll pay off. (June 28 10:40)
Have a buy at $3.4 with more November options to buy at $1.05

(NYSE: ELVT) (“Elevate” or the “Company”), a leading tech-enabled provider of innovative and responsible online credit solutions for non-prime consumers, today announced that combined loans receivable - principal outstanding recently surpassed $500 million.Chief Executive Officer, Jason Harvison commented, “We, along with the banks we support, are proud to have eclipsed half of a billion in loans outstanding during the peak of summer demand season in 2021. Consumer credit has recovered faster and stronger than originally expected and we now expect combined loans receivable - principal balances to end 2021 in a range of $545 million to $575 million compared to our previous outlook for $475 million to $500 million.""""Elevate continues to build momentum and execute against our strategic growth initiatives. Our new Blueprint platform has enabled strong growth across all three products.

While this growth increased upfront origination related costs, such as marketing and credit provisioning expense, we expect to achieve our targeted returns on the significantly scaled volumes. We plan to provide an update to our full-year 2021 financial outlook on the 3rd quarter earnings conference call in November."""

"If it hits $3, Linda will sell again."
Share price should be moving with the new funding announcement from VPC. 300bp of COF improvements is tens of millions in improved earnings.
Stop losses are really kicking in this morning. Picked up some more at $4.08. Amazing and hope I am not wrong
Elevate Credit is down 8.15% to 3.72
I think the stock will stabilize at $3.50 for a few days and then go up from there.
"First, I'd like to note that over the first quarter, Elevate repurchased 2.5 million shares, roughly 6.5% of our outstanding shares. I won't say a lot here, but clearly we believe our company is very undervalued relative to both current profitability and most certainly profitability we believe is possible in the years ahead.As long as Elevate is undervalued, we will continue to utilize our authorization to repurchase shares."
Elevate Credit is up 9.82% to 4.20
"So insiders are dumping this stock? It's a deep value play, but I guess the business model is slowly dwindling quarter by quarter. Anyone have some insight on this matter?"
AK are you here?
ELVT is up 5.19% to 8.31
"It has come back a bit. I need it to go to $4 and change and even though Linda and Tyler are selling on a daily basis, it is holding very well. It’s wait and see."
what's this going to do today
Someone traded 1.1M shares today in a lot....I wonder who it was. The stock recovered after the sale but I wish I would had bought at $3.40 for that one trade....too late but hope it keeps going up!
Elevate Credit is up 8.49% to 3.52
Elevate Credit is down 8.92% to 3.37
Bought at $3.36 and sold at $3.45. Also bought a few more options today. Hope it keeps going up. I really wanted to wait for $3.46 to sell but didn’t want to get too greedy. I did like the volume and how strong it ended. Good luck tomorrow.
I wasnt expecting to be able to get back in at such a significant discount. God is Good!!!
wait more.
ELVT is down -4.94% to 10.01
Almost time to start a new position. I have always made money with this stock in the 3's.
"Earnings per stock: 2017: 0,16, 2018: 0,28, 2019: 0,59, 2020: 0,87, 2021 Q1: 0,34.So earnings per stock are rising already several years.In 2018 this stock almost hit 11 dollar.Can somebody explain to me why this stock looks so cheap.Ok, there is a lot of insider selling. But they also did this before the good Q1 report."
"Seems 1 insider sold 1,5million shares...Anyone got some info on this?The company still looks healthy from what I've been able to find."
And just bought more at $3.64. (June 28 12:33)
EPS beat by 0.13! I will take that any day!!!!

ELVT is down 28.19% to $4.56
Bought some puts yesterday and sold them and made about 4% in about 5 minutes. Tried it again today but it didn’t work. Hopefully tomorrow near the open I will be able to sell and then I hope it goes up for those holding the stock. Good luck
Cool Biz Model. Profitable. Small Float. Unusual Volume. Hmmm
I think the price not moving much over the last year is actually a blessing. It has given me time to add to my position.
I'm in at 4.72...fingers crossed for earnings to turn this around.
Time to rethink my strategy now and where to jump back in.
Hey Linda. Can you please stop selling? You must have less than 10% by now. Is there something you want to share with the rest of the class as you nosedive our stock price? Thank you
Sold 60 of my calls at $1.30. Made over 20%. I’ll see if I sell or buy more.
I was sooooo wrong. 
Starting to get close to buy range. $1.65 is where I would really feel comfortable getting back in.
"Tyler = Mr. Head is the voting trustee of The Tyler W.K. Head Trust dated March 20, 2014 (the ""Voting Trust""), which has voting power over the shares held by the Linda and Mike Stinson Irrevocable Asset Trust. Mr. Head as trustee has no pecuniary interest in the Voting Trust shares."
Bought more call options for November at $2.50 for $1.19. I hope they all cash in soon. My average option price is just under $1.20 and I'll keep buying the November ones for now.

"Linda, though Tyler, sold another 58k+ shares from 4/27 to 4/29. Amazing how they are getting rid of shares each and every day. At least it is not the volume they were dumping a few weeks ago. I hope they sell and leave once and for all with ""all in the family"" company. Shame on them."

I have made some good profits on the stock over the years but I need to see how pulling out of England will hurt the bottomline.

Nice revenue and earnings growth for ELVT 2018 2nd quarter.

New CEO should help make this great growth stock become more visible to the big institutions.
Amazing that TCV sold 1.4M shares in two or three lots at $3.40 when it was trading at about $3.60 to $3.65. I guess they wanted to get rid of their position.

"Congress Introduces Resolution to Rescind “Fake Lender” Rule that Facilitates Predatory Lenders’ Evasions of State Interest Rate Limits...THURSDAY, MARCH 25, 2021Lisa Stifler330+ groups representing all 50 states and the District of Columbia called for Congress to support a resolution to overturn a rule that helps triple-digit interest rate loans spread across the country by evading state and voter-approved interest rate caps...In June 2020, the District of Columbia Attorney General filed suit against yet another rent-a-bank lender, Elevate Credit, Inc.. The DC Attorney General argued that Elevate is the true lender of loans made in DC, well in excess of the District’s rate cap. Elevate sold two short term loan products to District residents that carried interest rates between 99 and 251%, up to 42 times the legal limit in DC. In two years, Elevate made 2,551 loans to residents well above the maximum interest rate of 24% for lenders that disclose their rate in contracts and 6% for those that do not.Currently, there are only a few of these rogue, predatory lenders, but they will spread to all 50 states if the OCC rule is not overturned. Lenders’ use of online platforms allows them to inundate markets across the United States. By gutting the long-standing anti-evasion doctrine, the OCC’s rule will eviscerate the power of state governments to independently regulate interest rate limits and will have horrible consequences for consumers, small businesses, and especially, communities of color."

Just a thought…perhaps this company needs a PR firm or should consider advertising their services to the masses via cable TV and internet advertising.With no visibility I think this going to be a longer road to success than 2-3 years.
I'm all in @ $4.20
"Well....the volume is very light. It seems that once Tyler sold all his shares and Linda stopped, the volume dried up. I still think there is a lot of money to be made and we should be at $4.23 - $4.37 range by the end of the year. I hope to cash in on my options which I find to be a deal considering that I can execute them and get the stock at the price that I want a few months down the road."
why does it say its debt to equity is 3.16 when the balance sheet suggests otherwise
Sold my Feb calls too. I only had 8. So $0.15 gain. Not bad. 11% or so
"I was offered a senior director job at elvt and rejected it. Pay was 215k and lot of equity...at $8 a share that is. GLAD I DIDNT JOIN ! my manager the VP, was a fat white racist and whose reason for hiring for this role was simply to do less dirty work."
