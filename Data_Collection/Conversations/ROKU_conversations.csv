"I have been waiting for the whole week for any competent bashers to point out the death cross we dealt with this week, they sucked apparently. Just like CupNHandle did not pan out, this looks also baked in. Check the $TTD chart as an example - A few months ago, it had to deal with the cross too and ended up >5% after a week.Meanwhile there is a hat trick for $Roku in play also. May the 4th(Q) be with you the longs. GLTM and enjoy the weekend."

Beautiful start to the day my friends. I'm fine tuning our engines and cleaning out the furnace and replacing the pistons as we speak. Gotta get this freight train in perfect working condition for earnings and the big ride back up to 400 that will follow
Mathematics say DOW 41K then rug pull. Let's go money printer.
Orange Capital Invest did a deep dive on ROKU
Shopify app for small business advertising on streaming is a game changer. It’s once again the tip of the streaming iceberg and no other platform can keep up.
"Roku Announces New Shopify App for Small Businesses to Easily Launch and Measure TV Streaming Ad CampaignsRoku announced today it is launching a new app that will allow Shopify (SHOP) merchants to build, buy and measure TV streaming advertising campaigns. Roku's addition to Shopify's marketing solutions will become the first-ever TV streaming app available in the Shopify App Store. Roku's application, which is slated to launch in advance of the holiday season, will enable Shopify merchants of any size to create TV advertising campaigns using precise audiences and measurement throughout their marketing funnel.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roku-announces-shopify-app-small-130000998.html"
Were going to cross 375 by mid November
"I sold my Roku near the top. Paid the gains taxes. Then bought a WISH. Now my WISH is in the wash. I think I’ll post nonsense all day and cast others as the bad guys. Then I’ll wait for Roku to go really low, sell my WISH really low, and buy back less shares than I had in the first place because Roku never got low enough. Who am I?"
"Roku taking a book out of a Netflix playbook? On Thursday they launched a subscription channel for ""This Old House,"" a home improvement TV franchise it acquired in March. It's the first time Roku will offer its own content ad-free via a subscription."
"I am humbled that ROKU dropped today under $300 beyond any expectation, so once again I will be adding to an already large position. Like I said in a prior post, ""pull the band aid off and drop to $280"" which will be the next time I add.I am still a ROKU bull but ground is getting shaky, so lets get the bottom over with and start a climb back to $400. There is no way ROKU should be so down.....maybe recent highs are at risk but ROKU should easily be at $380 plus. It will need a big catalyst to get back up, and that most likely will be some announcement of geographic rollouts and increase in user base."
"I am watching CNBC thru my ROKU device and in the last few days I viewed two ROKU ads that were quite clever, one touting simplicity of ROKU devices and the second its licensed smart tv platform. I just can't believe that ROKU got to play with the big boys in streaming without much previous marketing or having invested a lot of money in content. Kudos to AW and the team. I am holding. God bless and stay well."
Looks like the markets have refuted the many attempts for the October correction and are now on rally mode towards the next earnings season.
"Seems like we’re hitting at least a little ST resistance at $330. We need to retake it, and hold it in the next week or so. I think that would be a pretty solid pivot point to start back to an up trend."
Wow that popped quickly!
"Key to understanding the behavior of the selling pressure of medium size investors is appears to the shortened time frame used in their RSI calculation triggers for sells. It appears to be limited to calculations using a 5 day duration for RSI calculations instead of the typical two weeks or longer durations. This causes the RSI to be higher and that triggers sell orders. This puts the brakes on any ability to build the price.Of course, RSI is more of a psychological and chartist tool for predicting future prices. It does not consider existing fundamentals or news that promises to improve fundamentals. Promises are impossible to write into code. But poor assumptions can be easy to code. Every time Roku comes out with some good business news the stock goes up because of buying pressure from optimistic buyers, the 5-day RSI goes up, and that automatically triggers the sell order from the computer code used. I have to wonder if that is defensive, trying to lock in the gains before the other big investors can? If so, it could be a short-term gain with a long-term loss of larger gains.If you take the typical RSI calculations using longer durations you find ROKU averages around 33, which just hovers above the oversold situation. It has been that way for over two years because of the explosive growth of the company. As the quarterly revenue and earnings, the fundamentals, continue to explosively improve that should force the price to improve, otherwise the RSI will fall below 30, typically used to signal an oversold condition. How many computer trading algorithms are keyed into that signal?In conclusion we should take the RSI triggered sell orders as opportunities to buy and hold what they provide us at a lower cost. Don't even think of selling for the next few years at a minimum."
"I think it hits 325 this morning, then goes back down this afternoon unfortunately. Hope I'm wrong. still long, still strong. GL"

"manipulation!?? the answer is right in front of you.. the market is waiting to see if user account numbers can recover from the disappointment in August and smash expectations.. no mystery.. If Netflix user account numbers are good it will give Roku massive momentum in the lead up to the November report .. Until then, this is the price action you'll see.. and it really doesn't matter what happens now because if Roku's report is stellar, which I expect, you won't remember flatline days like this. . and if they don't do well, which I doubt, any gains in October will be wiped away anyway .. So, it's not some shady banker in a dark room somewhere smoking a cigar causing Roku to trade like this.. if so, then Elvis coild be walking around Buenos Aires right now doing a little shopping.. along with Jim Morrison.. hmmmm never know!"
"Laura Martin maintained a Buy rating on Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) on Friday, price target of $550.I can't get the link to stick. The article was posted today...just look for it."
I REMEMBER WHEN ROKU WOULD STAY 100 LOWER THAN NFLX. NOW ROKU HAS BEEN EXTREMELY OVERSOLD. ROKU HAS A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO DO.NFLX TO $700s. ROKU TO $400s-$500s
Over 300K shares (buys) last ten minutes today. Those are not retail buyers. Institutions know a good entry point when they see it.
Good morning friends! I'm sure glad I changed out this pistons last week and ordered fresh coal. Old coal doesn't burn evenly and it takes away from our ability to power up big hills and inclines. We're on our way back to the 400 station.
"When built from the ground up with the purpose from day one not changing that creates a lasting advantage either in the form of a head start or quality of the product or both.Roku's purpose-built OS is the best out there for a reason. Their OS maintains a head start on the competition and this partly explains why the giants of the industry could never catch up with Roku..It pays to have a vision from the start. It's true across various industries as well. Take Lucid motors for example. Among all the EV makers it's the only one with a purpose-built production plant - built in Arizona. All the others, including the legacy auto makers trying to make the EV transition are retooling older plants to make them EV capable.Roku will be the biggest winner of the streaming revolution when the smoke clears and the dust settles.."
Shorts are desperately trying to cover. This has gone parabolic!
Wasn’t under $300 for long…..

I love you all!
That’s was really quite refreshing
Long time holder. Just saw the Sky TV announcement that they are making their own TV's and streaming service. Effect on ROKU?
"If you like it at 319, you'll love it at 519. Streaming is here to stay!"
"A few thoughts I have regarding ROKU1. I think a lot of analysts are not considering the fact that ROKU gross margin will increase from 50% (already is increased from 40%) to a much higher %. This is because their advertising revenue is growing much faster than their low margin hardware business and it this will show in their financial in their next few years.2. Unlike Amazon or Netflix (Roku were actually a Netflix spin off), Roku is a content aggregation platform therefore they don't have to deal with the high cost content production like other media companies. They currently have the highest market share in this space which allow them to build up this list of data and insight on their customers. Which allow them to have to have very good content recommendation compare to Prime.3. It's all about choice, the ROKU ecosystem have the most channels compare to other services like Amazon or Google. Hence, there are channels that you can view on Roku which is not available in other services. Therefore advertiser flock to them instead of other channel like Amazon, Disney or Google. This is because they are not a wall garden but open standard and I have no incentive to only showing there content (which they have none).4. Roku TV OS were build from the ground up not ported from mobile OS like Prime or Google. Which allow their system to be very computational and energy efficient. Therefore TV manufacturers love them as Roku allow them to build TV model with cheaper hardware but the same performance.We will see in a year if I'm right :)"
"Anybody else expecting great news very soon…??Well, I am… for sure…Roku stock to the moon and beyond!!!"
"Just saw a commercial for ROKU..... basically a wife was explaining to her husband that their TV has ROKU built in and does not need a plug in. The Ad messaging tagline was ""yes, ROKU does that""!The interesting piece was the TV was and showed Apple TV Plus, so obviously ROKU and AAPL has created a joint commercial. INTERESTING!"
Hate to count my chickens before they hatch but it looks like we are turning around in a significant manner today.
"It's sad to see ROKU being so low and not participating in today's rally but to us long term holders, we know we are sitting on a stock ready to have a major explosion anytime."
A bucket load of call contracts for Friday are betting on a close in the $327 to $330 region for a short term profit.Seems a reasonable supposition given we're already at $325 in after hours.
Still just a hold. I am not excited about adding to this or any of my other positions right now. I did sell 5 VZ puts today. Pretty boring. I know. Right now I’m just basically waiting to deploy cash. Hold
"Get serious, if someone what to sell, this stock would have been in the 200's or 100's range a long time ago. These are some games markets are playing to collect premium on the ridiculously expensive options."
Volume broke 6 million. BOOM!!
"Currently I am a full time investor. I am looking at $ROKU for a $120,000 investment at market close today. I have another big holding $VZ. It looks like a amazing opportunity. My strategy incorporates Fundamental Analysis and Technical Analysis. I shorted a tiny amount in the market a little while ago. I suggest for any new investor don't over complicated stuff. I am making a quick buck flowing Warren Buffet with $BABA thats all you have to do."
Lol just buy it after earnings. Tough comps and supply chain issues will pressure margins. Great company that will be fine long term

"Any ideas. It's been hovering around $326/ $327Is it trying to establish a bottom, support or it can't go through $328 and a chance of going lower than $326Maybe testing $314 before going higher."
"""Cheerleaders"" and ""bag holders"" are up 10% from the bottom while Steven is still in ""cash"". Wake me at $500. That last laugh is going to be good."
"so, I was on anther yahoo chat board and someone posted...""there's a hat trick"" goin on with ROKU.. Can someone explain what a ""hat trick"" is/means ? I tried Google but don't see anything that makes since to me. IDK ???"
"Don't take any of this volatility personal...it's all part of the plan. The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient. – Warren Buffett. The roku game plan is intact and execution is better than expected. Like other companies that have transformed a sector, those share holders have been greatly rewarded over time. Roku is changing the way the world consumes TV. A few more years, ladies and gentlemen, it will be showtime...it's simply inevitable. These prices today will be considered bargains and there will be millions split amongst us bag holders. haha! Best ahead!!"
"335 tomo with this setup, 345-360 by end of week"
"Did I read this correctly, that Laura Martin insinuates that ROKU could some day be a 450 billion dollar company? That's more than 10 times today's stock price."
"Roku Trading just 40% off its high, Roku is the tamest of Mr. Market markdowns on this shopping list. Roku is the pioneer in streaming video gadgetry, and it continues to be a niche leader with 55.1 million active accounts through the end of June. Roku powers streaming experiences through a series of affordable dongles that plug into TVs. It's also the default operating system in 38% of the smart TVs shipping in this country. Business is booming. Revenue soared 81% in its latest quarter as user growth (up 28%) is getting a boost from an even bigger increase in ad revenue per user. Wood did unload some of her Roku shares earlier in the summer, but she's been building her position back up aggressively since early August. Roku's founder CEO is Anthony Wood, but he is not related to Cathie Wood."
Why is Roku only up $3 when the market is up big and An analyst reiterated a buy at $560?
https://m.benzinga.com/article/23249248?utm_campaign=partner_feed&utm_source=TechInvestorNews&utm_medium=partner_feed&utm_content=site
Brazil is even better news than Germany because it reaffirms the relationship between ROKU and TCL.TCL is in many more international markets that it can draw ROKU into.
What happen to $600 by summer cheerleaders?
I own way too much ROKU. How do people on this board muster all this enthusiasm?ROKU has dropped $157 per share in less than in less than 12 weeks. How about some real reasons for optimism.
"Finally made my first buy today @ $304.27. I made this a very small purchase of 50 shares. This will be the smallest purchase on this pullback. Possibly 5 more purchases will be made through q1 2022For those who have been waiting for my signal, this is it. Buy! Just don’t go all in."
"Not sure if this is a head fake or not but of course the cheerleaders are out celebrating. Look at zoom. it makes sense that their growth will likely be hugely affected by the reopening, their stock is still sinking. We did the zoom meetings because we didn't have a choice and it worked ok but for the most part it really isn't that much better than a conference call. Roku is different. once you cut the cord most people will not be looking back. also as a customer of Roku, we continually find more and more content and their own content is quite good so far. it keeps you interested, they just keep getting better."
"you guys realize the comments posted by 'Steven' are probably from a 19 year old with a portfolio valued close to what a paper trading account is.. one of these awkward borderline isolated lonely types with a 2 day old teriyaki sauce stain on his T-shirt.. can't take this stuff that serious as you probably already know..I think if ever the cloak of anonymity was ripped away a lot of people, decent people who like to come on here for reasons I always ask myself, would feel a little foolish.. just sayin.."
Price predictions for tomorrow guys ?
Should be about 10%-20% downside from here. I am suggesting hold at these levels snd selling out of the money November calls. Start buying or selling puts as it trades under $300Great long term play here. Uptrend should start near end of year.
More delusional fabrications from Steven. He’s dedicated. He’s committed. Errr should be committed.

Just look for CNET Best streaming device in 2021Hint: I like who came in first place.From Apple TV and Roku to Amazon Fire Stick and Chromecast, here are our favorite devices to stream Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, Disney Plus, YouTube and more on your TV."
Friends- It's nothing more than a rotation out of high growth tech cause of rising rates. Nothing more and nothing less. So we wait.
"From all stocks I own ROKU is causing me the most pain, I think I will delete it from my watch list and will take another look 12 months from now. For everyone else with an average price of $310 like me (or more), stay strong and don't get weak hands!"
"Starting to see new Roku commercials. New type of adverts never seen before. They are encouraging people to buy a Roku tv. Not a specific brand, just a Roku tv. Great strategy. It also reveals the company's thinking which is to dominate tv's with their best in class operating system.Anthony Wood, while he's no Sherwood Schwartz, is a genius and a competitive strategic visionary!marsha marsha marsha !!"
"All of a sudden Anthony Wood and Roku will start making the wrong decisions after proving to be brilliant at what they do?After defying the odds since well before their IPO all of a sudden that's going to change?After staving off the much larger competition when Roku was much smaller now all of a sudden you shouldn't buy this stock because of those fears?Just when ad dollars and streaming are gaining massive strength and cable is dying even faster all of a sudden you shouldn't buy Roku stock?After the constant drum beat of valuation warnings since 2017 (!) now Roku with all this momentum both domestic and international all of a sudden you shouldn't buy because of that broken record of negativity and short-sightedness?Roku is a buy. It has been since September 2017 and it is now. All you need is patience, a little focus, and the money to invest. If the market brings it down further -- along with all stocks -- I can think of no other company that is safer to buy the dip."
Nice !!!! Keep it climbing these analyst open their big flapper to drive the price down and steel your money. Now look 2 days later up over 20+

Say good bye to the low price on this one!
Nice Short Squeeze! Shorts thought they were safe on a big market down day. This is why you don't short Roku.
"I do flip a bit of ROKU. The reason is, it's on average as high a percentage of my portfolio as any one stock should be, but if it dips, I am prepared to temporarily exceed that percentage when it's clearly on sale with a view to restoring the balance when it comes back up. I did that twice this week already."

"I think the downgrading Wells Fargo analyst wrote his hit job before reading about Roku's new app on Shopify. Or he saw it, but did not mention it as it did not fit his agenda. I've been selling my products on Amazon for 13 years. Amazon has nothing like this available. I know that a majority of sellers would buy TV ads if available. We already spend a lot on Amazon advertising only seen on Amazon website. But that's as far as the advertising goes. If the buyer/customer is not already on Amazon site, they'll never see the ads. With TV, they can referred to Shopify. The new Roku App on Shopify is huge!Look at the info below and you'll see how big this move is for Roku:1. Shopify Has Nearly 11 Percent of the Total E-Commerce Market Share2. More Than One Million Businesses Currently Use Shopify3.

We’ve potentially had a double top and a triple bottom over the last 6 months or so. Who’s ready to go for the triple top? And maybe a bit higher?
Very quiet on the news front. Strange feeling that big news is about to hit.

"Those concerned about the lack of news (at least from Roku), don't forget we are in the ""Quiet Period"" now: The period beginning on the quarter-end date and ending at the time of the earnings release for that quarter should be observed as a quiet period with no formal or informal business discussions by management with analysts or investors."

Love the bounce back the last two days.
"In a vacuum of no new information Roku is oversold, but to assume there won't be new developments with a company already commanding 37% market share with a first in class OS and first to the game, isn't a smart assumption.Roku is oversold largely due to overall market conditions. However, with an industry continuing to experience and benefit from a shift in billions of dollars of ad revenue and customer habits, this stock can fly at any time.When this happens, and nobody can predict or count on it on any given day, but when it does it will justifiably cause already high expectations for this stock to go even higher."

"Oct 14, 2021 at 6:55AM Motl Fol Issues Rare “All In” Buy AlertMany tech stocks have fallen hard in the past few months. For instance, shares of Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) currently trade at 38% and 32%, respectively, below their all-time highs. But, in both cases, Wall Street's pessimism appears to be based on short-term headwinds, and that creates an opportunity for long-term investors.RokuRoku has become a key player in the streaming industry. Its platform connects users with content publishers, allowing viewers to access virtually any streaming service. And, as the only purpose-built operating system for connected TV (CTV), Roku has established itself as the industry leader, powering 31% of global streaming time in the second quarter of 2021.Even so, the stock has trended downward in recent months, driven by slowing growth in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, streaming hours rose just 19% in the most recent quarter, a significant deceleration from the 65% growth posted in the prior year. However, investors need to contextualize that figure. Over the same period, streaming time across all platforms dropped 2% in the U.S., meaning Roku actually crushed the industry average.Why does that matter? It implies a highly engaged user base, and that makes Roku's platform valuable to advertisers. To reinforce that advantage, the company is adding original content for its own ad-supported service, The Roku Channel, and so far the results are promising. After debuting 30 original series in May, The Roku Channel saw record streaming in the two weeks that followed, which translated into a strong financial performance.During the second quarter, active accounts jumped 28% to 55.1 million, monetized video ad impressions more than doubled, and revenue surged 81% to $645 million. Roku also posted a positive GAAP profit of $0.52 per diluted share.More importantly, I think the company can maintain that momentum over the long term. This year, 17% of U.S. TV ad spend will go to CTV platforms, up from 13% in 2020, evidencing the growing popularity of streaming entertainment. To capitalize on that opportunity, management is executing on a strong growth strategy.For instance, Roku recently launched an app on the Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) App Marketplace, making it easy for merchants to create targeted ad campaigns on the Roku platform. To add, Roku is also working with Lionsgate (NYSE:LGF-A)(NYSE:LGF-B) to produce its first original movie, and it has other original content in the pipeline, with plans to release a total of 75 original series in 2021. For all of these reasons, this growth stock looks unstoppable."

More and more streaming is being offered through virtual reality goggles. In my opinion VR is ready to become the next big market when it comes to streaming. I hope ROKU is looking into this.
Just like William Shatner this stock is flying to the moon........let us hope unlike William Shatner it does not come back down. LOL
User account numbers from Netflix will move this stock. It always does. Roku has never decoupled from Netflix on earnings and they're not going to this time regardless whether you think they should.If Netflix user accounts pops and beats Roku will shoot higher especially during oversold conditions like we're in now. If Netflix misses but does well on user account additions Roku will be collateral damage in the after hours and next day but that will simply be a buying opportunity. It always is.Consider Netflix ER as the pregame to the Roku November report.
"With the exception of the last 3 weeks in July, Roku website traffic showed a steady decline throughout the late Spring and early Summer which was reflected in the August report user account numbers. Since July 13 web traffic to Roku's site climbed steadily peaking the first week in September and maintaining that level ever since -- small dip the last week in September then resuming an upward climb.Source: Alexa website trafficAccording to Alexa traffic analysis Roku's site rank -- primarily in North America and not taking into account Europe or South America -- increased 6.98% from July 13 up August 5, and an additional 9.77% (on Alexa's global traffic rank) from the week of the ER release to October 10. Total percentage increase for Roku's website since July 13: 16.75 % (most of those gains taking place by September 1).This could be a nice indicator of what we'll get in the November report since new account sign ups have to go through Roku's site."
"Not everyone can see the greatness of a company beyond the numbers. There are professionals who can; there are professionals who can't. There are amateurs who can; there are amateurs who can't.For example, Morgan Stanley the professionals can't see beyond just the numbers with Roku but many others, even on Yahoo, can. The numbers are great but with Roku there's so much more to the story. There's the vision this company has. A vision of what it can achieve. If you can't see this your expectation, and by default your price target, gets diminished and the competition appears more formidable than they really are. This is the problem analyst Ben Swinburne who covers Roku for Morgan Stanley has with this stock. He has never been able to see what's special about this company. This is why he said sell in February 2018.That's the beauty of investing. You don't necessarily need a title or stature on Wall Street to be right about something, but more importantly, you don't need those things to disagree with someone who does either!Roku has that special something. It has both the numbers to prove it and the intangibles to go beyond whatever limitation the Morgan Stanley's of the world set. Stick to your guns and don't let those who are supposed to know better derail what's obvious to you but will never be obvious to them."
"Analysts predict positive year over year growth rate of 51,4%!!! Lets gooooo!!!! "
"A little history lesson for all the downers/missed out folks out there. From early 2020: Roku TV brands in 2020 include ATVIO, Element, Hisense, Hitachi, InFocus, JVC, Magnavox, onn., Philips, Polaroid, RCA, Sanyo, TCL and Westinghouse. The growth story continues to unfold before our eyes. Include the recent news on the business/platform front and anyone with a bit of common sense will see that the opportunity continues to pour in. I truly got lucky and bought into the vision and I've been watching this story play out for a few years. This stock has already changed my life and it will continue to be life changing for many in the years to come...do your research, understand transformative technology, follow the trends, follow the money, etc. Roku is the leader in this space and will continue to be the leader for the foreseeable future. Remember, this is all they do, 24/7. I'm telling you all, it's not about hating Roku, Amazon, Apple or just being upset. It all echoes loud and clear for those that are listening and understand... ""All TV will be streamed"". Anthony Wood is changing everything we know today about TV and the coming years will be exciting times for the investor. Count on it.Best ahead!"
median target 450 high end of 650 per 23 analyst say! well let's go with that! were not all geniuses!
"Won't be any end of quarter profit taking on ROKU this time. 3 billion revenue this year, 5 billion next year. Just waiting for the explosion."
"Come on now, lets keep this going! No more pullbacks, grind this back up everyday going into earnings report in early November. The ROKU fever will catch fire again.......run up coming!"
Heisenberg uses RokuMarsha too!Looks like barring any unforeseen market calamity Roku's bottom is in.With the holiday season approaching and many people who traveled over the last few months back home a spike in numbers is what I expect in the November report.buy the dip is back.. correction looks like a 2022 risk not a Winter 2021 risk... no one can predict but it doesn't appear imminent.
Morgan Stanley's Swinburne stated that most streaming will be on smart TV's. He is in the group that still hasn't figured out that Roku's streamer device is not it's big money maker. Here's the top 10 smart tv's on Amazon. Note that ROKU is number one and has a total of 5 out of the ten listed:https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Electronics-Smart-TV/zgbs/electronics/5969290011
Ben Swineburne with Morgan Stanley has made 11 recommendations on Roku Stock in the past 2 years. 1 recommendation was a hold and 10 were sell. These recommendations started when Roku was $118.46Roku stock is up 252% since his first hold/sell recommendation. Draw your own conclusion.
"Looks like the yearly bash by Morgan S. target 310Valuation revisit: Shares in Roku are down nearly 20% since reporting 3Qearnings, due in part to the rebound in the 10-Year Treasury yields (see Exhibit10). Roku continues to trade at a premium to digital media platforms - currentlytrading at an implied 24x our '22E gross profits,a premium to peers (see Exhibit11) on an absolute basis although a more modest premium on a growth adjustedbasis. Shares are broadly in-line with our price target given recentunderperformance, but we see risk skewed to the downside if AA growth fallsshort of expectations and/or interest rates continue to drive multiplecompression in long-duration growth stocks."
"Mike Lohr, has a target of $425 per shareon ROKU for Christmas!"
"The company's active accounts surged 28% year over year to 55.1 million in the second quarter. Ad dollars follow eyeballs, and Roku more than doubled its monetized video ad impressions compared to the prior-year period. Together, this helped Roku's net revenue and gross profit soar 81% and 130%, respectively, to $645 million and $338 million. ""Audiences, content, and advertisers continue their shift to TV streaming around the globe, and Roku is a key enabler of this long-term secular trend,"" CEO Anthony Wood and CFO Steve Louden wrote in a letter to shareholders. And with this global trend still in its early stages, Roku is poised for strong growth in the coming years.Thus, Morris's $395 price target seems not only possible but probable, and long-term investors could enjoy even greater gains."
bought 500 at 324.30 on Friday. feeling nervous. more concerned about macroeconomic environment than than roku as a business
"No different thing companies like Square, Zoom, Shopify, etc. When there is a market rotation out of tech, always the highest growth names get hit the hardest. But we also know they're the ones that rebound the fastest and hardest when the money flows back into the sector."
"I think the bottom number is 294. This is easily calculated by multiplying 7 *42. We know 7 is the number of day in a week and 42 is the ultimate answer to life, the universe and everything, so if Roku drops below 294 again. We will need to create another universe to prove that 42 is not the ultimate answer to life, the universe, and everything. This study will simultaneously prove the existence and nonexistent of our universe."
Some news likely to hit tomorrow
"NO $200 FOR YOU SHORTY ALSO, DOCN STILL ON PATH TO SEE TRIPLE DIGITS. CONGRATS if you bought in the $50s when I told the board."
I see this year's chart as a magnified likeness of the double top that occurred aug-nov 19. Then look what happened after that: BOOM!
Last week Germany and today Brazil. Starting to expand our dominance outside of the US now. So many tailwinds and such a long runway to grow revenue like a weed. I can't wait to see what station this freight train will be pulling into even just 12 months from now... let alone 2-3 years from now. Congrats friends who have been on this train for the last 18 months and congrats to those just getting onboard now!
"What is under appreciated, is ROKU's massive amount of data!! ROKU data is like a window into the future. No coincidence, that ROKU big move into original content and Netflix's massive stock move higher! See a future of ROKU and NFLX in all out battle for the most relevant content."
"Not sure why some write about shorts. There are only 4m shares short…one day’s average volume. Shorts have nothing to do with the ups and down. The fundamentals are good and like any other stock with rapid appreciation, inventors need to take profits when they reach their intended investment goal. Hand on and sell when you’ve made enough. I personally will hang on for a few more $100’s in profit"
"In a race to a Trillion dollar market cap, ROKU is going to smoke NFLX!"
Just bought two streaming stick+ to replace two #$%$ firestick relics. I still have two more to go and I?m giving serious thought to getting a stick to take with me when I travel
"Would it be better to have a unifying operating system on most Tv's, one that simplifies the entire streaming transition from cable and organizes all your choices. yes. many people still don't get that, including those in the industry. That's a good thing because it means Roku is still the sleeping giant with a huge runway ahead. valuation is one of those things that is sort of an elusive and changing concept/number. A stock can be expensive but not necessarily. If all of a sudden Roku opens the eyes of the still oblivious investors and those in the industry to the potential dominance of it's OS -- Windows dominance -- then Roku becomes cheap. As great as 37% market share is there is much more room to grow. So many don't get that but until Roku starts making this a reality you'll still see bears like Benjamin Swinburne of Morgan Stanley issuing narrow-minded price targets of $312 because he doesn't get it. He never has.The tv commercial I saw today proves that Roku knows that getting on more TVs and educating the public to get a Roku TV and what in fact a Roku TV is is where the game will be won. Seeing progress specifically in this category is all you need to make the big step toward 51% market share. Once roku gets over 50% it will be a watershed moment. The stock will explode and their P/E will begin to shrink in relation to the share price. Talk of walled gardens like facebook or Google will begin to make sense with Roku.If you know and share this vision of the company and know what's it's planning then you have an advantage others do not. Morgan Stanley never embraced this vision and that's why they've been telling you to sell ever since the first week in February 2018. Look it up.marsha marcia marsha !!"
"From our friends in the UK: ""The findings highlighted in our ‘The Streaming Decade’ report show that TV in the UK has reached a tipping point, and streaming is becoming the norm for all ages,"" said Mirjam Laux, VP International at Roku. ""With more and more new and interesting content available to consumers, streaming has become the dominant force for consumers. And where consumers go opportunities follow for brands to engage them with compelling, best-in-class advertising that’s relevant to their interests. Streaming is clearly the future of TV."""
"It's my sense that the decline in the share price has been driven by fear that ROKU TV's are losing shelf space at the retail level. Here are a few of my personal channel check observations - Best Buy - at present it's clear that Google/Android TV's have more space and units for sale. The question is why. Is Best Buy awaiting shipments of Hisense and TCL ROKU TV's or have they made a change. Costco - similar to Best Buy, Google/Android has made inroads but locally, ROKU has a stronger presence than at Best Buy,. Walmart - ROKU powers Walmart's Onn brand and I'd wager that Walmart has little interest in an Amazon TV and they did not appear to have many Google/Android models. Target - ROKU still has a presence while Google/Android has entered the chain. Note that the above does not include all chains but just a quick look at four national chains. At present, it's difficult to draw conclusions as inbound holiday product shipments may not have arrived but it's undeniable that Google/Android has made some inroads. I do not view this as a cause for concern because I always assumed this market was going to have 3-4 significant players and that ROKU would end up with somewhere between 20-40% of what is a $250B global advertising market. ROKU's TAM is much larger as it includes subscription revenues, ad placement (OneView) revenues and likely other future revenue streams. ROKU has roughly 1/5th to 1/4 of Netflix subscribers with the potential to grow this number significantly but perhaps to something less than Netflix due to competition. However, it's very much worth noting that unlike Netflix, ROKU has the ability to drive revenue per user much higher than a $14 per month per subscription due to the nature of its platform. This year's volatility is all a part of investing in a company growing at a significant clip in a huge market. Some may try to trade this but I'm happy to be a long term holder. Good luck and good investing."
ROKU is about to start up MONEY PRINTING MACHINES all over the Globe!!!
if this is the nadir then I see 650-800 in the next leg up
Hey Steven did you buy back your 4 shares of Roku yet?And what’s up with WISH? Bag holding or taking your loss? Inquiring minds want to know.
"Any Arizona Cardinals fans? I’m jumping aboard for 2021. My Eagles aren’t going anywhere, but since Ertz is joining you, I’m jumping in. He should help you guys. He’s a team guy, and still has some tread on the tires. I wish him and his new team the best. GL!PS any FFL players Goedart moves up the TE ranks."
"Roku upgraded to Buy from Neutral with a $395 price target at GuggenheimThe analyst expects the connected television advertising marketplace will continue to grow at a ""rapid pace"" and that Roku will be a primary beneficiary. Morris also sees value in the company's international expansion and potential for additional targeted marketing partnerships. Roku's expanded advertising tools are underappreciated, the analyst tells investors in a research note. He sees an attractive entry point at current share levels."
Charts. Downgrades. Sellers vs buyers. Future. And overrall market does not indicate Roku headed back up anytime soon.It may have to wait until next earnings date. These are facts. Not opinions as cheerleaders do.
"Watching ROKTV channel and the selections are pretty good. Advertisers I saw include Google, Amazon, Facebook and Starbucks...etc. Wow...either mainstream advertisers are here because they know the data or one of them is checking Roku out to see the how effective and maybe make a bid. IMHO. Thoughts. God Bless and stay well."
SHORTS GAVE UP ON THAT $200 FANTASY LOL
"The great stagnation. Remember? I do. Stagnation is what it seemed like but in reality it's just what happens from to time with every stock, no matter how great the company. The great stagnation, or the first of it's kind in Roku's still relatively short lifespan as a public company was from November 21st, 2019 (roughly) until August 21st 2020 (roughly). If you bought Roku in November 2019 above $150 you wouldn't have seen any breakout or appreciable gain with your holding until September of 2021. If you were long on Roku buying in November 2019 above $150 would have been smart -- the right thing to do since you were buying long term and basing your purchase on a comprehensive assessment of Roku's future growth potential. Your decision to buy despite the price action the following several months was the right thing to do. You were eventually proven right just like those who bought earlier in 2021 will be proven right this time too.If after your purchase in November 2019 you came to these boards you would've found countless comments telling you how dumb you were for buying ""high"". You would've had to read comments for 10 months telling you that you shouldn't have bought over $150. You would've had to listen to hecklers telling you they successfully timed the market. Not put in those words but that's what these self-proclaimed geniuses are really saying.It was the right time to buy then and it was the right time to buy over $400. You can't time the market and always be wary of the charlatans and downright dopes who tell you they can."
Canada and UK numbers are just the tip of this huge iceberg! We just went from the top of the 3rd inning to the bottom half of the 3rd. Lots of game left. GL Roku....the bun for every hotdog!
"Excerpt from today's press release: ""Video-streaming company Roku is in talks to lease more than 100,000 square feet at 5 Times Square in Midtown"".I don't think Roku would be making such a comittment if they were not certain of their future continuing growth and profitabilty."
"Really Ronco??Posting a motl fol article?? You do realize they post articles about each stock positive 1 day negative the next. Last month they posted that Roku was not a buy.Honestly. You actually had me fooled. I thought you legit LONG But with all your bias and pumping and posting. Proves you are not a TRUE long. Nothing but a cheerleaders. Why didn't you post the article last month ?Why not post about facts as large holders been selling. But you post 1 day of a ""large"" order??You a rookie cheerleader."
"Bontino Contino, adding significantly to ROKUposition."
FOMO is back on the menu :)
"Happy Indigenous People Day! It’s about time there’s some recognition for the original peoples of this country. I only have one question. Why not just create an additional holiday, instead of replacing Columbus Day? We Italian Americans kinda like our little holiday. Who cares if the guy never set foot on the actual continent? "
"Research analysts at Truist Securiti raised their FY2021 EPS estimates for Roku in a report released on Tuesday, October 12th. Truist Securiti analyst M. Thornton now expects that the company will post earnings per share of $1.80 for the year, up from their previous forecast of $1.75. Truist Securiti also issued estimates for Roku's Q4 2021 earnings at $0.60 EPS and FY2023 earnings at $4.75 EPS."
"Oh, how I long for the days ROKU moved up $20-$30 per day. NOW it takes around 3 days to move that much. LOL!What we need is that escalator as we go into ER to get back to over $400."
"Roku, is just a savings account for Large Institutions Stay away"
Roku Expands Canadian Advertising Business With OneView Ad Platformhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/roku-expands-canadian-advertising-business-130000473.html
"Not sure if you caught this but this is how I see it. see the following story regarding Roku. from Motley FoolRoku: Summertime bluesDanny Vena (Roku): There's little doubt that cord-cutting has reached epic proportions. Pay-TV subscribers have declined by more than 23.5 million since peaking in early 2012. Last year alone, more than 5.1 million customers cut the cord, marking the worst year of losses on record. The migration to streaming is undeniable and the biggest beneficiary of this trend is Roku.Roku provides a host of boxes and devices that provide access to all the major streaming services, but it doesn't stop there. The platform has more than 10,000 streaming channels on its platform, providing options for even the choosiest viewer. This includes both paid and ad-supported channels, with something for everyone.The company has a superpower that's unknown to many investors. Roku developed a smart TV operating system from the ground up -- rather than repurposing a mobile OS -- which the company licenses to TV makers. As a result, the Roku OS has become the No. 1 selling connected TV operating system in North America, notching 38% market share in the U.S. and 31% share in Canada. Roku is the leading streaming platform worldwide, stealing the crown from Amazon's Fire TV last year. To close out 2020, Roku had 51.2 million active accounts, up 39% year over year, while Amazon reported 50 million accounts, up 25%. Additionally, and unbeknownst to many investors, Roku is becoming a powerhouse in the digital advertising space. Many associate the company with its namesake streaming devices, but those merely act as a gateway to bring viewers onto Roku's platform. The company makes the lion's share of its profits from digital ads that appear on its platform. Roku gets roughly 30% of all the ad space for streaming channels on its platform. The company then uses its DataXu advertising platform to better place those ads in front of their target market.Finally, as a result of short-sightedness by some investors, Roku is selling at a discount. When the company reported its second-quarter results in August, streaming hours had grown just 19% year over year, while active accounts had grown 28%. However, given the recent pandemic reopening in many locations, coupled with regular summertime activities, it isn't surprising that the growth in these metrics would decelerate. Short-term thinking by some investors has caused Roku stock to tumble more than 35% from recent highs. It won't be long before the streaming pioneer's blockbuster results resume, so investors should be buying Roku stock hand over fist."
Just to correct some of the disinformation being posted: ROKU OS is the dominant OS in Smart TVs.
Steven-O spamming on this board
Our beloved Laura Martin said that ROKU will make .58 cents a share while the consensus is .06 cents. I would say with certainty that ROKU will crush the numbers again as usual. Unbelievable buying opportunity.
2 trades total $61 million few minutes ago.

I finished changing out the pistons and got a fresh shipment of coal helicoptered in. We're ready to roll once again friends!!
"Stagnation will end at 4pm after Netflix reports.User account numbers will be what moves Roku. It's the one relevant indicator that will give an indication of what Roku's number will be. It's this metric that caused Roku to drop after the August report. I expect a reversal, or a resumption in the positive direction.Roku has been trading sideways mainly since October 7 -- same as Netflix. For right or wrong, the market still links the stocks together especially on user accounts."
"Truth. From a new article this morning...""This is one of the original momentum stocks. It moves fast in both direction, so it’s not for the faint of heart. This comment only concerns traders, because investors who stuck with it are smiling ear to ear. In 5 years, the stock is up more than 1,000%. That’s 10 times the progress that the S&P 500 made."""
"Sometimes investing comes down to things that are so simple in that some key indicators are right in front of you which is why they are sometimes overlooked. In this case the new commercials by Roku is key to revealing or confirming their ongoing strategy, and that strategy is to get on more TV's (no kidding) -- preinstalled where the brand of the hardware is becomes less noticeable than the kind of OS that's installed.When I buy a TV I consider the operating system now. That wasn't the case in years past. When it becomes a consideration for everyone that's when Roku gains another upper hand on the competition because it clearly has the best in class OS. the fight is on. It won't be easy but Roku has the advantage.marsha marcia marsha !!"
"very interesting that they mention Canada and the UK in their survey. Maybe a hint of international success in their next earnings, ROKU has made it a habit lately of providing hints to their next earnings a month before they come out."
What is everyone’s thoughts leading up to earnings? What has Roku traditionally done?
"Im always quite the positive human when it cones to Roku… But:Turned out to be a very disappointing week, actually also a month… :-("
"I have an old Roku and the Netflix that my wife pays for still works. I just read the support was possibly ending. Well that's a simple choice for me. Roku or Netflix, goodbye Netflix paying for garbage foreign films and politically correct force fed I can do without any day."
It’s hard to imagine that generally speaking people would want more Amazon in their lives:/
"Rosenblatt analyst Mark Zgutowicz raised estimates, reiterating a Buy rating and $560.00 price target on Roku Inc. (NASDAQ: ROKU) suggesting investors buy shares ahead of earnings in early November. Strong platform revenue and gross margin results should outweigh ongoing, albeit temporary, industry supply chain disruptions.The analyst stated ""Addressing the supply side, for conservatism, we modestly reduce 3QE/4QE net adds --now roughly in-line with consensus-- and player revenue and gross margin. Importantly, we don't expect to see a meaningful supply shock impacting Roku holiday (4Q) player and/or TV hardware sales."" He went on to comment ""With big media stock prices near 100% dependent on growing/retaining digital subscribers, we don't see this trajectory stalling anytime soon. We model a growing mix of this 80%+ gross margin segment, providing nice buoyancy to overall company margin. We reiterate our Buy rating and $560 DCF-based PT."""
