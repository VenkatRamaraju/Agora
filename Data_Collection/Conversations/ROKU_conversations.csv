"So glad that I didn't look at stocks at all last week while on vacation. Yes, I was shocked to see the price of ROKU Monday morning and again today, but I remember AMZN and NFLX and the likes going through the same swings. Today it is tech, but I did not hesitate to buy this incredible dip. I am long on ROKU so not worried. Thank you to that special someone that gave me some or all of their shares this morning for $363.50 a piece."
Nica amount @ 370. Tomorrow payday? ;-)
This stock is on sale right now. It’s only a matter of time before we are back at 500 again.
are you guys buying????????????
The world according to Steven…1) every long is a cheerleading pumper. 2) every long bought at 400 or higher. 3) Steven has been here forever4) the rest of us are all recent Roku holders. 5) Steven is the only one getting everything right. The world according to just about everyone else…1) Steven is full of it. The End.
Best Buy cannot keep TCL and Hisense 4K Roku TVs in stock — I’m a buyer of ROKU at open
We got upgradeThanks
Patience needed for now before heading back up towards $500!!
Boyz and Girlz. Sell Roku and buy VIAC. Roku has a 50% downside risk and VIAC has a 100% upside potential. Its time to switch the rocket and go check out the numbers for yourself.
"Vet pumper Ray said he bought more yesterday 4 months ago when roku high 380s. He also said ""Bought more""So you support and told others to buy at $480 5 weeks ago. You bought high $300s. Now you bought more?But you don't support people who buy low sell high???Lol."
"On a Roku note, not an awe inspiring week, but maybe some signs of a ST base. It did close a bit higher than last Friday. Have a good weekend all."
Friends! Anyone else taking advantage of this discount? I just picked up another 10 shares at 390. That makes 530 shares for your conductor and happy hour coordinator. Can't wait to look back in 30 days and congratulate myself on the move. Haha
"Hope y'all are loading up here. I previously invested all my cash in the stock so here I sm selling long puts and using the cash to buy more stock. When the stock rises again, you win double as the put premiums decay and the stock appreciates."
"Hope the Y! does not delete this - https://seekingalpha.com/news/3727239-roku-amazon-are-top-two-in-connected-tv-amid-sharp-recent-growthI was keeping a wary eye on the new Google Chromecast that was released towards the end of 2020. It looks like that has not really impacted Roku in any way. As per this streaming monitoring report from Samba TV, Google's streaming fell 49% while Roku has increased...since FY20 Q4, Roku streaming increased 114%. Go Roku!"
"NO $200 for you shorty. You would be lucky if you ever saw $300 again. You better do something soon shorty! Otherwise, ROKU will just continue to trade in a tight range until it’s ready to run up to the $400s again. "
Too much good news today between spectrum and new linear channels to Roku. Will def end day green!
This is still a good entry point for Roku. Last week was ideal. RSI is starting to trend up and also with the MACD. It should take off from here.
could be a twenty dollar day. cover cover cover. roku loves down market days
All aboard! Wake me at $500
Great results: ROKU reported quarterly earnings of $0.52 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $0.12 by 333.33 percent. This is a 248.57 percent increase over losses of $(0.35) per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $645.00 million which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $618.54 million by 4.28 percent. This is a 81.14 percent increase over sales of $356.07 million the same period last year.
"Also raised/beat guidance. Roku sees Q3 revenue $675M-$685M, consensus $645M"
Numbers seem extraordinary. The only thing they missed was MAYBE active users. Street looking at 55.8 million and reported 55.1. Total net revenue up 81%!
me waiting for Steven to show a screenshot of his $2 AMC shares .....
let's see the green
I've been through about 10 earnings calls this is to be expected. made dry powder just for this dip.... have a great weekend. see you Monday
International QuestionsAt what point do the numbers become meaningful enough for management to separate out international active accounts and revenue numbers? When will we know if international growth is tracking to expectations? What does the competitive landscape look like internationally? How do the growth rates and margins compare to their business in the US market?I think these question are important ones for the company answer so investors can understand just how big the opportunity is outside of the US.
"The good and the bad from the pandemic. Roku’s management warned at Q4 that there would be tough comps starting in Q2. In fact tv viewing overall is down 19% as the economy began to open back up. At some point, the numbers will normalize and the comps will make sense again. Bottom line is that even with the tough YOY comps and the reopening trends, Roku still blew out their numbers on a year over year basis and beat on both top and bottom lines. I’m very excited about the launch of TCL’s Roku TV in Europe as that should see strong adoption. Plus entering the German market should give us another new growth driver."
There are very interested buyout OFFERS coming…. Stay tuned
"I do not disagree that a stock trading sideways in an up-trending market is poised for a fall. I’ve been in ROKU long enough to know, that it often marches to the beat of another drum. Regardless, even though I concur we could be in for a short term drop, the long term potential far outweighs minimal short term downside risk. For you to sit back and bash while maintaining a position seems silly to me. If you don’t like the action, get out. But don’t whine about it."
LIMITED/MINIMUM DOWNSIDE RISK. ROKU just strong to keep down. EASY MONEY
"Daily, monthly, up, down, sideways...none of it matters. $500+ by the end of year. Best ahead!"
Are they negotiating a MA just feels like the way Roku price is reacting! Is Comcast actually looking to scoop up Roku before some other companies make a move??
"Look at the chart, move lower so far today is nothing, it's within the pattern, but the MACD is about to crossover. This happened before the August 9th move. Diamond hands. Shine, shine like a diamond. $ROKU investors will be looking this cord cutter over."
Wow! 1/2 million shares turned in 12 minutes. Moving on some volume.
SHORTS ARE NERVOUS. Not knowing what day ROKU will gap up and keep going 
afghanistand had 5% internet in 2001. Now almost all of them have internet! Let's drop some roku sticks to them and let them watch team america: world police for free on the Roku Channel!
"@ Vincent. Can you show some facts or proof for your claim? No drama. Simple request. In other boards. People usually post links and present website where they get their info from. Roku board seems different. More ""opinion"" then facts."
Don’t you live Joe’s stock market? My 401k is through the roof
Lets try this again… we will see 360 today and hold it
Buy it ....and forget it....
LIKE CLOCKWORK! GOT TO LOVE THE ROKU GAP UPS. ALWAYS EASY MONEY FOR DIP BUYERS 
"TCL’s very best TVs, which include the 8-series and 8K-capable 6-series, will still exclusively run Roku OS"
"Roku constitutes a majority of my portfolio and I enjoyed the opinion of investors on this forum over the last two years. Now, most comments remind me of a middle school playground filled with name calling. I appreciate the response to my question….is anyone worried about TCL and Google. What is the Google TV interface like? Is it user friendly?"
This is still a hold. Do not add more until a firm bottom is in. Could be $329. Not a sell either. Just hold here.
https://seekingalpha.com/article/4452808-roku-stock-forecast-2022
Not bad for a Friday
360 next week
So unlike roku to just sit
great buying opportunity 360 by Monday

All of sudden Roku will move up rapidly back towards highs!!
"$DIS up, ( great numbers) so will $ROKU tomorrow…"
How we all doing today? Only down less than 1%? Not bad. 4 Marines were killed I saw. Sick to my stomach. Life could be a lot worse. Prayers to those Marines.
1.46M shares won’t move this stock on any day. Stock is frozen and has no interest lately
"Roku #18 on Apple Store Apps .... Higher than Uber, Disney, Hulu, Discord, Pinterest, Twitter, Venmo, Chrome, Paypal, Reddit, Twitch, Walmart ....."
"Yawn, still averaged in the low sixties after first buying shares on the initial public offer at 16. Been backing up profits with puts since 200, sold enough shares at 450 to allow me to play with house money too. So at the end of the day shorts, keep your yapping, doesn't change my thoughts on the stock or its future. Now go find your rock to hide under."
Back towards $500 again Roku is next nflx.. even better!Just stay long!
"the week of pain is over, did everyone get some cheap shares. I hope so"
going to erupt soon 
STAY LONG & STRONG. ROKU 
Rejection again
"Perhaps it’s wishful thinking, but I’m showing we closed right on a trend line dating back to 03/17/20. Last time we touched the line was 05/06/21. Not coincidentally, that is the only date in last 12 months, RSI was this low (29.52). Looking/Hoping for a reversal here. GLTM."
Told you 360!
http://www.businesswire.comThe Roku Channel Adds New Linear Channels to Lineup
buy the dips
"Anybody who took the time to listen to the CC can only see where ROKU is headed. So many positives on all fronts, very clearly explained. I'm not going to sit here and type out all of the positives, do ur own DD that's not for me to do for you. What I do know is I've been long for a couple yrs now, and I will stay long years from now. Anybody with half a brain can see where the new way to watch television is going and Roku is the leader and will lead the way in the future. I think once real investors digest the whole scope of ROKU ER and CC, they will have the same take I did. Yeah day traders will make money and some will get burned, that's fine if that's ur thing. Myself, I will continue to hold thru the ups and buy on the dips when I can just as I have been doing. No concerns here at all. If after listening to the call if you don't see it the same way...... well, that's on you. My conviction has never been stronger on a stock and the KU just further confirmed it today. Laugh, down vote, whatever you wish, but in 2-5 yrs I will have the last laugh on you! GL to all who see the picture (no pun)"
"Interesting article in the WSJ today’s business & Finance section about ‘Executive Stock-Sale Plans’ as someone once said (Me) “Information is $” this article surprised me in the details of how Executives set up plans to sell their stocks. A few weeks ago, someone on this board mention that Mr. Wood sold shares at Mid $440. With some one else on this board responding that it is a common practice scheduled months ahead, it appears not. I am long on ROKU but this information was/is informative."
"With the perception of Roku’s Active User Accounts starting to slow, now would be the perfect time for Roku to advertise on cable/satellite tv services… “The Beauty of Cord Cutting”. Literally, the beauty is no wires or set top boxes showing. Show a bunch of “before” entertainment walls compared to the clean look of those same walls with a Roku device or Roku tv. When I’m socializing with friends I get the cord cutting question all the time. When I run through aesthetics benefits, the women are all over it! You can see the light go on! The men are more tuned into the savings part. The market is really punishing Roku on it’s perceived slowing of active accounts. Why not run a serious ad campaign to promote the main advantages of cutting the cord and going with Roku? I bet this campaign would be wildly successful!"
I’ll sell at 950.
"The only negative in the entire press release is the new accounts growth. Given that there were/are supply chain issues and that folks were able to travel a bit in Q2 2021 for the first time (and purchased fewer TV's and watched less TV), I am not concerned about this in the least as seasonality came into play this quarter with regard to this one metric. ROKU already has over 40% of US households as active accounts already. If Mr. Market wants to discount the stock for this reason, it presents a buying opportunity for long term investors."
"‘ Charter & Roku statement on return of Spectrum App. ""The Spectrum TV App is now available for download from the Roku channel store. We are pleased to renew our partnership & offer this great streaming experience to our shared customers.” They describe deal as mutually beneficial’"

"Ive been watching this board for a good long while now. Any idea why your “leader” , um I mean “conductor” has a strong strong tendency to post on good days (green) yet disappear on bad days (red). I follow sports and any coach who did that would lose all credibility in the clubhouse. Truly great leaders are always with you, win or lose, through it all. Good days or weeks or bad days or weeks or months for that matter one should never feel abandoned my their fearless leader. Key word being fearless. Ive noticed this trend, any thoughts?"

"Buy good companies at good prices and hold them. In 3 years time I could see this doubling, there’s so much future streams of revenue. This can be a full on Netflix in a decade."
"@ Kevin""Zoom was out with earnings and some people think Roku is tied to these pandemic stocks. Not.""I didn't see you comment June 2020 ZM when up after ER and lifted Roku up a little. All was good and gravy then. You can't have both ways / side. Pick a side and stick with it. Not based off of what matches the pumping agenda."
Any theories on the deep drop in the past hour?
What Roku lost in subscriber growth they more than made up in ARPU growth. With more marketing and international expansion this company has potential to still grow a ton!
"I have a 10X return on ROKU shares already and today's ER just show how far the company has come. Thank you for your hard work AW and team. Thank God for the outstanding return. Red ink in ER has turned firmly to green. According to AW, the next leg of growth is international. He mentioned UK and Germany and there are many countries beyond that plus the streaming tide is now in full swing, not just here but globally. I don't like reading manual or instructions and I love the simplicity of the hardware. The stock price may have gotten ahead of itself but as investors, stay calm and enjoy the ride. God Bless and stay well."
"I got laughed by Roku cheerleading pumpers when I said i sold 3/4 of my shares for all overall stocks. They insulted and laughed. That money went into other non stock investments that are doing great. Some even into trading cards where I've already made 100-300% return on high psa graded cards. When people say or use phase ""cash on hand or side"" usually means they have it in other investments. But cheerleaders won't understand or know that. Sure I am down today on the stocks i have. BUT I'd would have lost about 40-50% of my profits if i kept what i had in Feb. Buy low. Sell high. Best to sell for profit than risk. Only advise I can give."

The afterhours decline is a ""market overreaction"" to a 4.9% sequential decrease in video consumption, the analyst tells investors in a research note. The metric is consistent with the reopening of the economy, Forte adds, stating that he is not ""overly concerned"" about the implications for Roku. The analyst recommends that investors take advantage of the pullback as he remains positive on Roku's ability to exploit the transition in advertising spending to connected TV/advertising video on demand and away from linear TV."
"I was a buyer yesterday and my post got censored probably due to mentioning the withdrawal debacle;) I'm a buyer today too trying to get back some shares I lost a couple weeks ago and also topped off my $MGNI holdings recently and added a lot of beatdown $APPS with my newly minted cash - it was just announced that APPS will be added to the MidCap SP400 last night so a big pop of 14%(18+% earlier) this am for the ticker. My point here- for those disappointed with Roku's action lately, I want you to imagine the day Roku adding to SP"
EASY MONEY FOR PATIENT LONGS/DIP BUYERS.Enjoy the weekend 
Roku is still up over 100% from a year ago. I'm holding for 5 more years. No reason to look at a 1 day move. It could be up or down another $50 by the end of the week. You guys fight it out I really don't care. I'll be here when u r gone!!!

"Very important week here guys. Support has been reached since for the past week, week and a half have been relatively green and based on the charts looks like we are now poised for a rebound. This would be the time for hedge funds etc to start picking this up so fingers crossed!

This is a great stock to rotate some profits to... has been beaten down on great earning and has not seen a significant bounce with the market lately.... almost trades like a china stock.
"I'm Kabuled. It is one of the worst days for America and you do not need to read WSJ to learn that - it is ‘Saigon on Steroids’: The Desperate Rush to Flee Afghanistan. It is unseemly to watch. This event emboldens America's enemies and erodes the confidence of its allies. America and the whole world is less safe today than yesterday. I invested about 500k into $TTD and $Roku less than 2 years ago hoping 1 of them would hit a home run, boy I was wrong- both excelled beyond my expectations (more than tripled for the period). I never considered trimming until last week and put in some stop-loss orders. I technically took out all my principals this morning and will let the majority of the rest shares ride for the next 5 years. While the USA is still strong there is no doubt that we unfortunately have weak bureaucratic amateurs in charge of the federal government, we'll all pay for it - my punishment is less share #s than I planned, I guess I will take my share of humiliation as an American. With MSM's help, you can pretend our southern border crisis is non-existent, the higher inflation is transitory and arguing high crimes are just ""gun"" violence however there is no hiding the utter failure of Afghanistan collapse in front of the world's eyes - and the worst is we still do not know how bad it'll end. Also headwind $3.5 T spending bill is another shoe to drop, in the next few months the closer the final bill to that #, the worse for the overall market. In a nutshell, I'm still super bullish on $Roku, $TTD and other picks individually, my holds are long term, but my confidence in the foreseeable big economical background is on a shaky ground."
"It’s not a stretch to predict Roku will have its first $1 Billion quarter for Q4, 2021. That would imply a 55% revenue increase over 2020. Should be more than doable since the preceding two quarters have had an averaged growth rate of 80%."

"I'm literally going to be driving by Roku headquarters in a few weeks. If I see a motorcade of executives from Samsung or LG, I'll post it here. Then again, would be inside info perhaps.. so maybe I'll just keep it to myself.."
It’s been awfully quiet on the news front lately. Could something be brewing?
Going Up!!!
"I challenge any of you naysayers popping out of the woodwork to actually read the ER and then listen to the CC. Then come back and try to backup ur drivel. Not a thing in either that concerns me one bit. This went down simply because they didn't pick up as many subscriber counts. Oh yeah I forgot, people finally got outdoors again to enjoy the freedom they have left. Viewership on people watching TV in general down 19% streaming down 2% except Roku, that number was up 19% Pretty much says it all. Roku might have slipped a tad, but the numbers say they are still better than anyone else. I was hoping for some International numbers that really didn't come out, but I don't have a problem with Roku holding those cards close to their chest. All is well on that front, just another ace up their sleeve. Once that card gets played, and it will, lookout above. Anybody with half a brain knows where this is headed just by reading and listening, I suggest you do the same if ur on edge or clueless. Play ur games, doesn't affect us long term investors. Maybe more DD and less drivel will serve you well, but to some I doubt it. GLL"
Very low volume and going sideways for a while. But I really think we are getting ready to launch upwards.
roku isn't any different from when it was trading at 490 than today - except for the shorts. buy accordingly...
this is where I bought at Last earnings drop. hahaha
I sold 3/4 of my shares at $455 but then turned around and invested in $WISH and $FUBO. I have lost all the profits and now I’m thinking I should sell my remaining 5 shares. Where should I invest it though?
SEE! easy daily/weekly trading gains. TIME TO RELOAD CHEAPER AGAIN.OCTOBER 15th/JANUARY 2022 CALLS. Perfect for trading the swings and for holding much much higher prices. 
I can't believe we are down 122 points in one month with great earnings and a raise. Geeezzz
"How many stories over the last 3 years about ROKU's competition? Dozens, Amazon Fire TV's, Android TV's, Samsung Smart TV's, TIVO, Apple TV, Wallmart, Google TV, and what has been the reality? ROKU, platforms growing Revenue faster than ever. Every sell off, on anxiety has been a buying opportunity! ROKU's ad platform's are still worth a King's Random!"
365 tomorrow easy
"We need to break this range to the upside. Take a basic six month chart. Take today’s closing price, and draw a straight level line back six months. This looks like an inflection point. A break higher is positive. Lower isn’t. If we break lower I think next support is 320ish. Just my take. Hope it doesn’t come to that. Still bullish LT."
"Rockem Sockem ROKU!!! This will be heading well north of $400 soon, no reason to hang around down here. Matter of time and patience, this is the one to add on dips."
"You people here are good ROKU cheerleaders but not much interested in making money. Today one day, Tue Aug 24th, a dozen EV stocks jumped 4 to 10%, half dozen Energy stocks went up 4 to 6%, a bunch of the meme stock jumped up and GME went up 27%. Buy Roku ‘tomorrow’ when it turns back up."
"time to call up our top prospect, Algo Rithm"
We all have seen roku go up $25 in a day hold on it will go bk to $400 its oversold like it was in june then went to $450
"FuboTV is launching its integrated Free to play Games and Fanview live stats .., (CONMEBOL) is also a plus for ROKU. It would be even better if they can buy FUBOTV if FuboTV’s financial stmts don’t improve."
The closer ROKU gets to 3B revenue this year the closer the stock gets to 750. That's a fact not an opinion
What’s holding Roku back?
"I know some of you (maybe many) have muted Steven. I have a proposal for Steven, and I ask those that may have muted Steven to sign out so you can understand my offer to Steven. Those who didn’t mute him can already see it. In stevens post below this one, he quotes me as saying…Remember. ""It's not a lie if you believe it.""Famous quote from Roku Captain Blue Fox.So Steven. Here’s my offer. Go back through my comments. IF YOU ACTYALLY CAN FIND THAT COMMENT, copy/paste it, and tell us approximately how far back we need to go to see it. If it’s actually in my comment history. I’ll leave for a month. If you can’t prove it, you leave for a month. You’re being put in call. Deal or no deal???Step up boy. Or own up to your bologna. "
"Good morning friends! It's nice to see some green. But I remind myself does this pull back from a new all time high just several weeks ago really matter at the end of the day if we're holding this stock for at least several years? Of course it doesn't. At the end of the day we all know both the growth story and incredible future this company has infront of it. Congrats to all of you out there that got on the train last year with me (there's alot of you!), and congrats for staying on to at least thr 500 station which is where I'm taking us. This train doesn't stop."
I may be forced to pick up another 10 shares and bring my haul to 540. This multi day drop due to stop losses being triggered is too good of an opportunity to pass up. I'll keep you posted my friends.

There will be a $20-$30 up day sometime in the near future. Only question is how much will it go down? If history repeats itself it would be somewhere around $280-$330. My guess would be $327 but depends on the overall market. Roku was brought down the past 2 days by the market just when it was going up and showing life. still confident this stock will be back to $380-$450 in no time!
WOW this stock does NOT move
Normally I would say that this is a little fishy and think its being help in place with very little volume and movement. but this is a very tight range for roku. push it down and get some people to sell their stock but it can equally be said they are trying to hold it up so others can sell their stock. we will know soon enough. whether new good or bad comes out it will probably make sense then.
Added some more in my kids Roth IRA. Imagine what those 7 shares will be worth in 60 years!
"Expecting a nice bounce up today. Next week +400? Very, very possible..!!"
I love Roku but locked in profit when it was around 450. Still holding a position but will only add if it goes to the 320 mark. GLTA
Zoom was out with earnings and some people think Roku is tied to these pandemic stocks. Not.

Minimal shares traded after hours. Beat both top and bottom. Strong guidance for 3rdQ. miss of 1.5 subscribers meaningless.
"Cathie Woods plan is almost complete. Sell lots of ROKU on days leading up to ER, everyone follows, stock price drops, buy back a the low price. Wash, Rinse, Repeat.ARK bought $132 Million of Roku today: August 5, 2021 BUY 337688 (shares) 0.5813% ARKK"
Sell some share at the price anthony wood does — don’t fall in love with the company.
Need your advice guys. I have $300k to invest. Should I go in FB with 26PE or roku with 211PE? Please advise
Nasdaq bring Roku down but hopefully will bounce back up
HOLD
time for this roller coaster to go up $10 per day instead of down.........
"Need some night time reading? Research articles beginning in 2014 on the Roku/TCL partnership. Roku put TCL on the map and the partnership is stronger than ever. Major expansion in South America and Europe began last year. There's the other 13-14 TV manufacturers in the mix too. Google just wants a piece of the pie with TCL. Will they be successful, time will tell. Roku has a huge lead amongst all of the competitors on the TV OS. The frame work is set and the roku team is executing on all fronts to grow the business world wide. Folks, just have to say it again...best ahead!"
The fact that the Roku cheerleading pumping squad believes that 2.9% float short interest moves a stock and causes down trend PROVES they have no idea what they are doing. No stock in history moved by such low short interest. Large holderz selling is cause.
"Here is a good one from Cheerleader Brian M 2 months ago""Oh there you are. I just wanted to thank you.You kept saying this wasn't a $500 stock and Roku on a downtrend. You kept telling me that it was a good company. And guess what. I listened. I added 450 shares 4 July 16 $400 calls 1 October $500 call and I sold 1 $420 put.""This is all thanks to your advice. Thank you Steven.If only you listened to yourself. But instead 1/2 your money is in cash.""So this Cheerleader ""Long"" added 450 shares July 4th @ $435. Which is $108,750 Well well wellSo, in less than 2 Months, you lost $26,750.But hey... I am the one that doesn't know what I am taking about eh?"
"What’s up with Roku, any news?"
Barron’s just put a buy rating with a 550 PT. I better cancel that subscription
It is now in the over-sold range.
Let’s go
"up almost 8 bucks today, nice"
Roku is up over 1300% since 2018...we're fine! During these few years it has weathered misleading information and a slew of naysayers and will continue to do so. The foundation has been laid in the USA and they company is executing. They're even taking this on an international basis as well. Check out the latest youtube video with Giannis and TCL. Wonder how many TVs Giannis helps sell across the world? Best ahead!

I'm just wondering why the pumpsters are not out in force pushing it up. did they sell? are they fair weather friends? you like they have done so many times before.
"Our pivot point is at 327.Our preference: short term rebound towards 414.Alternative scenario: below 327, expect 298 and 281.Comment: the RSI is below its neutrality area at 50. The MACD is above its signal line and negative. The configuration is mixed. Moreover, the stock is trading under both its 20 and 50 day moving average (respectively at 366.4545 and 405.3218)."
News from tdameritrade:Roku to start selling streaming hardware in Germany | FierceVideohttps://www.fiercevideo.com/video/roku-to-start-selling-streaming-hardware-germany
"Roku reiterated BUY with $650 price target at Cannonball ResearchCannonball Research analyst Vasily Karasyov believes the video advertising revenue that The Roku Channel revenue shares back to content owners can be viewed as a content cost and that even when it's combined with content assets amortization, the two items represent only 12% of the Platform revenue. As such, the bear case based on the expectation that Roku will ""ramp up content spending to irrational levels is not going to materialize,"" Karasyov tells investors in a research note. The analyst keeps a Buy rating on Roku shares with a $650 price target."
Can't wait for all NFL to be streaming on Roku Channel. The deal these cable companies signed up for isn't financially feasible without them going to ad supported streaming. What's the best way to get 50M+ active eyeballs to make up for the sunk costs? The Roku channel.
If ROKU reports positive earnings tomorrow then it would be eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500. Here are the requirements: a market cap of $13.1 billion (as of June 2021 guidance) the value of its market capitalization trade annually at least a quarter-million of its shares trade in each of the previous six months most of its shares in the public’s hands at least a year since its initial public offering the sum of the previous four quarters of earnings must be positive as well as the most recent quarter.3
"is this a rotation out of ROKU into NFLX because of the extraordinary investments into content by NFLX? We have had upgrades galore on ROKU, yet that news does not move the stock back over $400. ROKU needs something else as a catalyst to drive stock price to new highs. IMHO we have a $100 potential upside once ROKU starts its momentum again."
"We need a big $20 day, this stock doesn't move well with nasdaq at all"
Roku Call volume weekly currently at 32000 for 370 strike
"Ladies and gentlemen... this is your conductor and happy hour coordinator. I'm taking the family up to the lakehouse by Alexandria Bay for a long weekend. I am going to spend 50% of my time boating and drinking Titos, and the other half looking at the schematics of this freight train to see what kind of upgrades I can make on it next week. I wish you all a great weekend and don't worry... I'll get the furnace on this steel beast blazing hot once again very shortly. See ya Monday!"
"Well, we now have a huge buying opportunity. Things are really looking good for the company. All the ""ducks"" are lined up and Roku is ready for another blastoff!! I'm feeling good!! I'm adding more."
Honestly not a bad day considering how bad the market and nasdaq are today
"""Do not wrestle with a PiG""!A few things about Steven : the queen of the BS, and almost every one of his comments is a lie (check his posting history and you'll see yourself), also the most muted person on this board."
TOO EASY TO MAKE DAILY/WEEKLY PROFITS FROM THE DIPS. 
Nice close. Volume finally kicked in towards the close.
"""You people here are good ROKU cheerleaders but not much interested in making money. Today one day, Tue Aug 24th, a dozen EV stocks jumped 4 to 10%, half dozen Energy stocks went up 4 to 6%, a bunch of the meme stock jumped up and GME went up 27%. Buy Roku ‘tomorrow’ when it turns back up.""100% Agreed.The Roku Cheerleader Pumpers made fun of MEME stocks in which OVERPACED the market and each sector by a lot.I'll repeat so it sinks in their small heads. OVERPACED the market and each sector by a lot.I made more in last year than in the last 5 and mainly from ""MEME"" stocks.Still HOLD AMC, LUCKIN, GME from the lows 1.5 years ago. Sold 3/4 of shares at highs. Smart money knows where it's at. Simple buy low, sell high."
"It’s interesting that TCL stated that they see the streaming world ending up as a two company race, between Roku and Google. Everything I’ve seen suggests a two company race between Roku and Amazon. Do you guys see any evidence that google tv or Android tv are making ANY headway in the market share race? Last I saw, google’s market share is shrinking, not growing."
"All TV will be streamed! The most amazing aspect of that statement is that we all have front row seats to watch this happen in real time. We don't have to think about the ""what if"" stocks from 5, 10, 15 or 20 years ago. Best ahead!"
"I know what I'm holding, but nevertheless a very disappointing day."
"The report looks good. Aside from a modest decrease in user growth (only 500,000 new users per month), and the slight decrease in the entire streaming industry viewing hours (due to the reopening, I imagine), the rest of the report looks absolutely fantastic.And, they're going into the German market.It's hard to argue with 81% yoy revenue growth, with a forecast of 51% revenue growth next quarter. All in all, another exceptional quarter from the team at Roku."
"Would it be technically possible for Roku to add a serious gaming option to their platform? Either by way of acquisition of a major gaming platform company or by allowing gaming content publishers to offer games on the Roku platform? Curious to hear Roku investor’s thoughts on this. AW was actually asked this question on the Q2 earnings call and while he said their open to the idea, it really was not a big enough opportunity for them right now. Also wondering why that would be?"
"Some thoughts on ER. New users was going to slow a bit at some point. Covid and stay home skewed the recent ERs to the upside. Roku just got that growth sooner. Similar scenario happened with NFLX and DIS to name two. Of course growing users remains important. But more important to me is the revenue from ads and fees. The ‘set top’ revenue. That continues to beat expectations. And that’s where the $$ gets made. That revenue involves little additional cost to Roku day to day, and is high margin. Not sure what the ST trade range will be, but I remain confident LT. There’s still a lot of users to be gained, and future ways to monetize. That’s the end game. Have a good one and GL."
"For those interested, please go to the TCL site and review the TV count on the various operating systems. It's right here too:Roku - 85 TVsAndroid - 10 TVsGoogle - 7 TVsAgain, competition is always good for the overall marketplace. Obviously there is a clear leader here and their scale continues to grow and dominate."
"If you have equity in Roku or long options just relax and hold. Dont sell for loss…It has always happened in the past. Stocks pullback only to go up .. checkZM, microsoft, apple, nvda , crm,All have fallen so why not roku… dont panic and sell…It will come backup with volume. Can be any day this week as well"
I disagree with Steven. The reason its down or not strong is the news and the street. They are convinced that somehow the competition is the reason they only grew subscribers by 3mil instead of 5 even though prior numbers and their input was it was going to fall apart with the lock downs ending. they still grew! they grew profit which meant nothing to the street. the street has this wrong the s-called competition is not grabbing the new subscribers either but they are somehow ignoring that. they are wrong IMO and they are missing it. this was seasonal with longer days and all that it should not be expected to grow in a straight line. it has nothing to do with short interest.
The only tech stock that doesn't move with nasdaq but moves with it when it goes down
Zero volume. Like I said the other day friends... thr profit takers are out and the weak hands are out. It's only hedge funds and long retail that are involved in this freight train now that is up 140% over the last year.
"So we're shocked to hear that the TOTAL viewing hours decreased as the public was let out of their cages and returned to work, but users were up, ad revenue up.....unwarranted selloff...buy the dip."
"Look at the best buying electronics on Amazon... ROKU is 6, 7, 20 and 61 with the Amazon Firestick placed at No. 1... but ROKU is also selling at Best Buy, Fry's etc. with people buying Amazon FS, well on Amazon.With the Olympics and tons of new shows brought in mid Aug, streaming hrs should go up significantly again."
"We all know many sellers/fence sitters will get caught off guard one of these days, and ROKU will skyrocket much higher. ROKU IS ALWAYS EASY MONEY for patient dip buyers. "
"In case you missed it, CNN posted a review of ROKU's streambar pro the other day, calling it a ""no brainer"". https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/29/cnn-underscored/best-soundbar/index.html"
I hope everyone has a great night. And maybe focus time and effort on productive tasks rather than the car alarm that goes off 24/7. I’m out.
Anyone concerned about Pelosi’s budget
Target lifted to $480strong buy at thus price level!
"I’m beginning to think problems with Google is having more of an impact on ROKU.Read article “ Roku stock has faltered with competition, but don’t count it out”"
"I think we can expect som $Tesla investors today… bad news there, $roku a better option these days.Include big institutionals scooping up after the good ER.Will get interesting!Time for a nice spike up..!!!Lets go!!"
Any thoughts guys on when the next stock market crash is going to happen? A bit worried since ROKU isn't big on profit but see that we have no risk with short or long debt. This next crash from the so called experts will be the worse of all time. Any thoughts? Think this matters more than how the stocks performing considering its going to hammer this and all tech stocks way way down
"Even though it’s down slightly it’s still keeping in line with the uptrend, hoping for a +20 day soon"
Slow but steady increase! I like it!
RSI 30. Everytime it hits this level the stock has a 20-30% bounce back
"Ahh durrrr buy the dips duhhhh$485-345 ""Easy money"""
It's a good day to buy!!!
"thanks for all the cheap shares. took me a month but I started adding to Roth IRA.got a hundred there and added 200 to individual account. I had almost 1000 last year. bo for 120, sold from 150 to 200"
Wake me at 500
Roku now qualifies for entry into S&P 500. The selection committee meets in Sept. We'll see.
"When Roku breaks 1,000 we should all meet! I'll even pay 4 Stevens airline ticket and Uber ride from the trailer park!!!"
Got new 50 inch Roku Absolutely fabulous
"The Big Picture.....As of Jun 30, 2021, active accounts totaled 55.1 million, up 28% year over year. Along with this, a 19% year-over-year increase in the streaming hours propelled significant growth of 117.4% in platform revenues for the three months ended Jun 30, 2021.This has attracted advertisers to its streaming platform and is expected to aid top-line growth in the near term."
"sooner or later this is going to pop , $ 20 and then 10 just like that.......you watch...."
"Any FFL players here? Let’s swap thoughts. I’m in Philly so I know the Eagles. Hurts should end up a low end #1 or high end #2. Ertz should bounce back, but I look forward him to be traded. If Ertz is traded Goedart will put up #1 numbers at TE. If Ertz stays he should remain in 2nd tier at TE. Sanders at RB will produce if he stays healthy. If he goes down, look at rookie Gainwell. I won’t recommend any WR. I live Devonta Smith, but haven’t seen much if him and Hurts together. Hard to say who steps up. If it’s a keeper league, take Smith as your WR4. Eagles offense will be better. O line was decimated last year. Two pro bowlers out, and Jason Peters (future HOF) just isn’t Jason Peters anymore. There’s a young guy (Jordan Maillota former rugby player) in his place. He’s big and fast and improved dramatically as last year went on."
"So, question to all the Roku cheerleaders pumpers out there.ARKK along with many other large holders have machines to buy / sell and trade based off of fundamentals, ER, overall market, trends and so on.Many of these holders that YOU agree with, have bought low, and sold many shares high for profit. Many have also put large PTs on Roku While a day or few days later SOLD into that ""upgrade"" (while you bought high)So how is it wrong when other posters as myself also agree and sell high, buy low. Or even short when its high. But all you cheerleaders say its ""not smart investing.""So the same large holders you FOLLOW do the same thing. The pumping agenda that your whole team follows and believes, makes zero sense. 6 months ago, ""Netflix is and like Roku and related"". 4 weeks ago, according to the same Roku Cheerleaders""Netflix is nothing and not related to Roku""Doesn't matter what the news or facts are. Only if it goes along with your pumping agenda, do you agree. Everything else is fake and lies. There can be an asteroid headed towards Earth causing market crash. But you cheerleaders will blame it on ""Manipulation"" And the price of Roku proves it. Whose been right, and who has been wrong. Honestly Overall... None of you cheerleaders know the first thing about investing. Kind of curious how much money you all lost."
2022 yet
"Connected TV (CTV) accounts for 60% of total ad views, with Roku and Fire TV devices continuing to lead with 43% and 26% of CTV views, respectively."
"Well it took a few minutes as cheerleading captain blue fox had to call his pumpers up to assist him. Welcome pumper Ray. So. You say I own 4.5 shares.Blue Fox says I hold nothing. Brian M said i sold it all. John says i own 10+Hmmm your team can't even get your own lies correct. Shame2/10 score for performance.2 points for participating. Oh btw. All.of you ""muted"" me 4 weeks ago? Oh right that was another LIE. Lol you make this too.easy."
I wonder how many college students are showing up to campus/dorm room with a new Roku TV?
"Roku will start selling its streaming players in Germany and is reaching out to content creators with information on how they can update their video applications to support the German market.The company's plan to sell its streaming players in Germany was foreshadowed earlier this month in a letter to shareholders that accompanied Roku's latest quarterly earnings report.A note to developers that said Roku is now allowing app designers to distribute their channels in Germany. Additionally, Roku has activated a monetization feature through its Roku Direct Publisher program that will allow app developers to make money from their products distributed in Germany, the United Kingdom and in other European Union countries where the platform is supported.Germany will be the fourth country in Europe where Roku's platform and hardware are officially supported, following earlier launches in the United Kingdom, Ireland and France. A senior communications analyst at the media research firm Hedgeye, said Roku's expansion to Germany was a ""logical next step"" for the company's international growth plans. ""Roku has a good leg up internationally is that it's a low-cost operating system, which is going to help them compete in these other countries."""
How much of a McDonald’s paycheck could be devoted to stocks each week?
"There's no doubt that ROKU remains a volatile stock but what is of note is the higher highs and lows in the chart over time (particularly with longer term views of the chart) which generally align with dramatic growth of the business. My view is long term so I really do not spend too much time with short term movements in share price. I add on sell offs but do not plan to sell for years. Valuation discussions about the stock interest me and how they've changed over time. ROKU now has been profitable for four consecutive quarters and shows no signs of regressing in the future. It's now likely that eps will cross $2 per share in the near term. One argument against ROKU was it's lack of profits. Now it's that it's not profitable enough. It's also interesting to note that this year revenues will approach if not exceed $3B which puts the revenue multiple around 16.6x. If ROKU were to do $5B next year that multiple shrinks to about 10x. Once next year's view become clearer, it's certainly possible that the stock has the potential to make a 50% or more more. That's just in the relative near term; say by March at the latest. It's likely that ROKU's performance over the next 7 months is going to make all the chatter on this board over the last few weeks look silly. Good luck and good investing."
