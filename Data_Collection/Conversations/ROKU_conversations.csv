Beautiful! Like I said last week... the profit takers are all gone. Only the big boy institutions and long retail train passengers are left holding shares. Let go!!
So (according to amzn) apparently HBO is losing 5M subscribers - apparently amzn thinks they're the only player in town!! HBO can stream through anyone they want - seems other players will benefit. Amzn has never been the #1 streaming service anyway!
$370 in two weeks
Picked up a few more shares In ATH at 318. Looking better for Roku now hope I’m not buying too soon but will hold long term

"Here come the pumper cheerleader statements like Gap up, back up to$500, next stop $400 and the like. I do believe the selling is over done and the street is giving way too much credit to the other so-called players in the space. They have not performed well in comparison to Roku but apparently its good enough for them to hear they are doing something and that means roku must take a beating. again we'll see over time"

Nasdaq and Roku both at support levels right now. Hoping it holds tommorow and we are back to 350 in no time
Friends! Sorry about this morning. I got home late last night and possibly had 1 or 4 too many Titos. I'm back behind the controls now though and getting us back on track. Happy Friday by the way! I'm heading to Saratoga tomorrow for a concert at the SPAC.
"Wow, ROKU actually managed to be green (at least as I post this). I was mocking the stock a couple of hours ago for always being down. So I will at least admit I was wrong to do that. Having said that, I think we can all agree (longs and shorts), that its recent performance has been horrifyingly awful."
Roku is up over 1300% since 2018...we're fine! During these few years it has weathered misleading information and a slew of naysayers and will continue to do so. The foundation has been laid in the USA and they company is executing. They're even taking this on an international basis as well. Check out the latest youtube video with Giannis and TCL. Wonder how many TVs Giannis helps sell across the world? Best ahead!

"Let's see how many brick and mortar retail stores are going to line up to sell an Amazon branded TV. None is the answer. So who's going to buy a crummy fire operating system on Amazon's website? Bezos' mom, maybe."
"@Brian.... so, your going to take one paragraph out of the article and share dilutions and make it a negative article? I'm pretty sure it's not a negative article if read the whole thing with an open mind sir."
"https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/09/15/3-top-stocks-that-just-went-on-sale/“According to eMarketer, CTV ad spend is expected to grow 49% year over year in 2021, and thereafter at a nearly 20% compound annual growth rate through 2025. And according to FreeWheel, Roku currently demands a whopping 43% of CTV ad slots, meaning this company should benefit from the massive growth in CTV ad spend even as competitors attempt to steal market share.”"
"There have already been ""Amazon"" TVs in Best Buy. Now we're just going to brand the outside? Not scary. I switched everything in my house from Fire Tvs to Roku Sticks when I actually used the product. Roku is much less buggy, content agnostic, and entirely a better experience from a customer perspective."
You can trade out any Fubo shares you own for Roku on Tuesday next week
Fire tv and google tv are getting lukewarm reviews. Roku will emerge even more dominant. Vincent…please prep for departure.
"Friends! This is definitely a tough stretch, but I will not lose focus that I bought 400 of my now 530 shares 16 months ago yesterday at a $116 a pop (and averaged up twice last year as well). I will also not lose focus on the fact I'm holding this stock for at least several more years, and we all know where this stock will be next year let alone in several years compared to where it is today. Life is really good for us shareholders. Congrats on the 2 run homerun we hit over the last 17 months, congrats for the 3 run homerun alot of you hit by buying even before I did, and congrats in advance for the grandslam we're all going to hit 2-3 years from now. This stock will do what it's going to do right now, but it's all a moot point really if your time horizon is at least 1 year out let alone 2 or 3. Enjoy your evening! Its shrimp cocktail and Titos time for me."
I have said it before: Roku needs a 5 or 10:1 split so that retail investors can more reasonably consider 100-share lots as e.g. an IRA investment.
ROKU is easy money for patient dip buyers.ALSODOCN (Digital Ocean) CONTINUES IT’S RISE. Should easily see Triple Digits IMO. 
I will sit and hold till the next Roku run! Growth stocks are very unpredictable and it's been natural for months now. The run is going to come again. Patience is key!

DECREASE of 900k shares. Which means they sold more than 20% of their holdings. During this time, you and your pumping buddies spammed ""Buy more, Added more"" you even suggested others to buy at highs. While I said sold or reduced. You still talk bad about Fubo who has been out scoring Roku and preforming better as of late. Why are you even posting about shares they held over a year ago? Who the hell cares. what matters now is how many they hold, been selling and when will it stop. This is what moves the stock. NOT what happened a year ago. Once again, you bend the facts and truth, make up numbers, to fit your cheerleading pumping agenda. Once again, my sources are from ARKK website, where are yours from?"

"this morning: Roku reiterated Buy at Deutsche bankDeutsche Bank analyst Jeffrey Rand believes the Roku Channel is well positioned to take a ""leading position"" in the advertising-based video on demand market. The channel continues to expand its content, offers an attractive viewership experience versus competitors and demands a premium cost per thousand impressions due to Roku's first party viewership data, Rand tells investors in a research note. Post channel checks and analysis, the analyst has increased confidence in the growth strategy for Roku Channel and Roku's opportunity to leverage its first party data to receive premium pricing on its ad inventory. He maintains a Buy rating on Roku shares.Also after earnings on 3 weeks ago.Roku reiterated BUY with $650 price target at Cannonball ResearchRoku price target raised to $600 from $560 at DA Davidson, BUYRoku price reiterated BUY with a $550 price target at BenchmarkRoku UPGRADED to Overweight from Equal Weight with a $475 price target(from $400) at Stephens"
"Roku should buy Vizio for $5B and integrate their ad space on their platform. Then sell the tv manufacturing aspect to TCL for $3B with assurance they will a. Sell all devices with Roku platform. B. Sell more TCL devices with Roku platform. Stock would dip a little bit but we would gain millions more users, and clear a pathway for more growth!"
Prediction: 228 close. 223 next week then rebound to 350
"@tanyaI am curious, why do you think that this company is mismanaged?"

"By releasing TCL TV's closely integrated with their in home spy devices, Google and Amazon are poking a sleeping giant. What is stopping ROKU from giving it's millions of users a ROKU brand privacy invader? Hey Google, Hey Alexa, Hey ROKU?"

""These results show that TV streaming has passed a tipping point.“"
"S&P inclusion: I believe this may be a deterrent for ROKU’s entrance into S&P 500: “S&P Dow Jones excludes new entrants into the S&P 500 that have dual-stock classes”. As we all know, ROKU has class A shares, which we all hold, while AW owns mainly class B shares with the additional voting rights. I took that quote from a Bloomberg article published last week. In case any are wondering, some companies in the S&P 500 which have dual-stock classes were apparently grandfathered in."
"Y'all don't worry about these swings! Remember...""All TV will be streamed."" It's plain and simple here. Roku is a transition stock (cord-cutting, OTT, etc.) and those that got in early have reaped a tremendous gain. Those that bought in the last month or three, yes, there is a bit of pain. However, this will be short lived. Patience will be rewarded...let this story unfold, we're early in the transition. One day, sooner than later, perhaps by 2025, all TV will be streamed. Plus, we have Vincent...go ahead and ask him where we're headed!"
"An over priced stock behaves just like this one. Longs don't be frustrated. It will continue with the pain. Forward PE 204, Price to sales ratio almost 19. It is what it is and thats the truth."

"ROKU is by far the best streaming device on the market. I bought 2 Amazon fire sticks, my streams were constantly bombing out and I would have to reset and restart the fire stick. Then I got smart and bought a ROKU and installed it. I was so impressed I went back and bought a second one.since owning the 2 ROKU's I might have had 2 or 3 incidents where They buffered for a second or less. Also adding the mute button, volume up and volume down controls on the side of the remote was shear genius. Both the Amazon fire sticks are in the landfill."
Interesting article out today about how Roku is being pummeled by share dilution
What should Roku do with sizable cash on hand along with abundant credit available?
chart shows that the only times (2) that Roku has hit the Acc/ Dist ratio this low corresponded exactly to a months long reversal cycle. If this pattern holds then I'm expecting 750$ over the next year.
I really want to hold this but it keeps dropping. I feel like anything 300-330 is a good buy point though
"Market manipulators see momentum is on roku side, drive down price let momentum work then buy back. Market manipulation gotta love it"
Keeping an eye on this one. Getting to be a better and better deal. I love my Roku. It usurps the use of any of the apps on my Samsung TV.

"I’ve been hilariously wrong on this one for months. Had a 397 avg short average before that epic squeeze lost big, then went long at 355 avg, currently down big. Best way to play these truly massive swing are to buy these massive dirt cheap dips (now) and sell only a small amount on those massive pops ( just 10-25% ). Good long term company, in a growing sector, at a can’t go wrong price here"
Big money to flow in here…. Really soon..!!! Time to get back up to +500!!!

Strange things are going on in the economy these days, that’s for sure. No idea why my old car would have gone up so much in 5 weeks. Gonna use my extra $2,000 to buy more Roku. I’d buy more Tesla, but they need to stop leaving money on the table… get your shxt together, Elon!"
people buying are 373. but few buying at 350 yesterday.. I don't get it
"Missing the late July pricing around here, ROKU stuck in a rut."
Most CTV add stocks got beat up including TTD. This is not Roku’s fault but Wall St. fund managers manipulating and making the move.
Didn’t Amazon just reported today they will be making Amazon tv now? How will that effect roku bottom line with a juggernaut like Amazon stepping in.
The 200 DMA is acting like resistance now. We need to bust through that. More coal is coming!!

Still overvalued imo.Based on facts of sellers growth earnings and so on.
8 months dead money for Roku. Actually still down more than $100 per share. While you cheerleaders spammed. Others and myself making money on stocks like Fubo. Mocking me and others.
"All these ppl trying to bring ROKU down please short the stock, they just announced to today they will be launching into Germany as they increase their expansion into Europe…..never bet against ROKU"
"ROKU looks like it's broken, I've been in ROKU since $105 a share but with 3 chances now to sell well over $400 and almost $500 at one point I am starting to reevaluate my thesis. Slowing subscriber growth is a concern, also other stocks in the sector are flying higher as ROKU languishes. Falling in love with a stock is a mistake and I have many other stocks with much better performance, or more certain outlooks IMO. ROKU is a great company but if it reports one more quarter that doesn't measure up or shows further slowing subscriber growth ROKU will drop to the 200's range. Tough call, competition could be hurting ROKU."
Will this stock ever go up again? The stock can’t even muster a positive day when the broader market rallies significantly.

"It seems that there may be some market concern about competition from large companies like Amazon and Google, etc. I would remind everyone that this market is large enough to support several large competitors. Annual TV ad spending is $250B. Using the ROKU business model, approximately 30% of this will be shared with the platform on which the ad is run. In other words, the global TV ad market is worth $75B to be divvied up amongst the platforms. This of course does not include the 20% commission on streaming subscriptions or the 20% commission on streaming video rentals. Additionally, this does not include revenues generated by ad optimization and placement services like TTD and ROKU's OneView. This also does not include potential future revenue streams from ecommerce, wagering, etc. The point here is that the market is so large it will easily support multiple companies at revenue streams that are more than 10x today's levels. When one considers that ROKU generated $1.70 eps on $2.3B in revenues with significant scalability to be achieved (earnings will grow faster than sales), the future does look very bright. That said, there will continue to be significant volatility along the way. Good luck and good investing."
"I was a buyer yesterday and my post got censored probably due to mentioning the withdrawal debacle;) I'm a buyer today too trying to get back some shares I lost a couple weeks ago and also topped off my $MGNI holdings recently and added a lot of beatdown $APPS with my newly minted cash - it was just announced that APPS will be added to the MidCap SP400 last night so a big pop of 14%(18+% earlier) this am for the ticker. My point here- for those disappointed with Roku's action lately, I want you to imagine the day Roku adding to SP"
"Classic Roku stock action. Remember back a couple of years ago when a 5% swing day was commonplace and accepted? Seems that now though people are much more surprised. Try not to let it bother you, great company, great product, sky is the limit for this stock, just give it time."

Those 100 shares would have only been $35k two weeks ago.Looking like i made the right choice!!! Hopefully this repair gets me through until we see back $500/share to get my truck almost brand new."
Very low volume and going sideways for a while. But I really think we are getting ready to launch upwards.

"I see the 4.5 shares holding Steven was making a ROKU overvalued comment (what unspoken here was his FUBO, Wish or Meme stocks having great intrinsic values comparatively I guess;) and also another misleading half truth statement to fit his anti-ROKU agenda without providing reference data regarding ARK funds. If you read ARK Q2 quarterly report, $ROKU was quoted as the biggest positive contributing factor for both ARKK and ARKW in the quarter. For whatever reasons, ARK funds do trade and/or rebalance their fund periodically just like the other funds do. As of Friday 9/10/2021, ARK funds(ARKK & ARKW) hold 4,042,746 shares of ROKU - an increase of 26% over a year ago (3,210,895 shares as of 7/31/2020- reference ARK annual report) and a decrease of 12% from 7 months ago (4,594,037 shares as of 1/31/2021- reference ARK semi annual report).Unlike the recent events in which they are wisely selling out most of their China related names, the bottom-line here is that there are no fundamental changes in ARK funds regarding ROKU, ROKU remains their solid top 10 holdings in both funds. This is where nowadays individual investors (I mean long investor, not trader nor gambler) may have an advantage over these funds, IMHO. We have almost the same access to the available information but can buy and hold for a much longer duration if you have high conviction with grasp of the fundamentals in a particular stock like $ROKU."

Congrats if you caught the $50s"

So many stocks are down by a similar percentage this morning. This is about market makers setting the price rather than anything to do with price action on any individual stock.
"Folks, any theories on what caused the dip today? I see strong buy rating from analysts, but it concerns me to see the dip. Ended up buying some prior to the last earnings, and sitting on significant loses now. Still I am holding, but it makes me wonder what is causing the dip despite no real negative news from either the company or the analysts. Thanks in advance for any thoughts and insights. Much appreciated."

Stop relying on chart patterns and the buying of other investors to inform your trading decisions. A decline in price means that a stock has become more valuable plain and simple. Do you go into a department store and wait for the price of a sweater to start going up before buying it?

Amazon Firefox OS is in 1.6% of all TV's sold in the World.If Firefox was better than Roku it would be ahead of Roku.

So… Woods sold 85.000 last week. Thats a lot. Only 45.000 left in his hands.Now I know he does this quite often… but beginning to wonder is somethings going on here below the surface… /install_Seismo 
Your portfolio should have a higher than usual cash position right now. I am currently at just over 20% and about 20% of my holdings are in value plays. That is also higher than normal. I have also significantly reduced my tech holdings including ROKU. Make sure you are not too heavy in one stock before you add.
"Amazon TV? So this is why we were down yesterday and now today? Add it to the list of non starter reasons to sell the stock. TCL added Google’s OS to some of their TV’s recently, Walmart is making their own TVs now as well. Look there is a lot of money in streaming and the market is growing fast. ROKU’s not going get every dollar but don’t think for one minute they won’t hold onto their leadership position. They have the best OS in the market and their brand has a ton of equity. All boats will rise in the coming year but the most important segment, Advertising— which is where Roku makes most of their money, is clearly dominated by Roku with 43% of the connected TV ad views in 2020. There is not even a close second. Advertisers love how Roku has built their company to maximize their ability to reach target audiences efficiently. Success should be measured by platform revenue growth and ROKU’s grew last quarter by 117%. That rate is accelerating! The Amazon move is an attempt to keep up with Roku. Why wouldn’t they do this? Walmart did it, Google is doing it and Roku was first to do it. ***News flash*** “Expect more moves by the competition”! Amazon’s move is not a game changer though."

"@ havenotimeyetI am confused by your comment""No one lining up to buy""But the Roku cheerleaders keep saying to buy and add more since 480$+They also keep saying ""this is bottom"" Does that mean you are wrong or them? Please help me with this confusion"
"I’m waiting to add more at $323. There has been support at that mark in the past. Obviously, a stock trending down in a market testing all time highs, does not seem favorable. No worries long term. I’ve been pounding the table for nearly 3 years, that there are not many/any companies growing the largest segment of their business 80%+, with 60% gross profit margins. That segment is now growing at 100% YOY, with 60%+ margins. If anyone on this board can name another stock with those characteristics, I’d love to hear it. I would certainly take a hard look at that company. Anyone?"
"Shortly after Roku released its first device, big names went after it including Sony and Western Digital. Do you see them now? Then came Google's Chromecast which still exists but they barely earn users these days. Apple TV is an expensive dud. Amazon Fire TV OS has been a formidable competitor, but clearly is not winning, that's why Amazon is now trying to make its own TVs. The same with Google TV OS, it's an indication that Chromecast is not getting enough traction. If in the future, Google makes its own TV, you know their TV os was failing. Amazon's TV idea is no different from Microsoft's Surface laptops or Google Pixel phones: they are not game changers, but it only again proves Wood's vision: connected TV is the bacon now. Buy when you think the price is right!!!"
"""Hey look, Ma! It's GREEN!"""
"ARKK is one of the many large holders that have SOLD more shares than bought in the last 8 months. The only times they are buying are on small dips to gain quick $$ then to resell again. Google arkk investments roku . So when some of you mention ARKK buying, its misleading as the facts and truth is all there on their website.I am a share holder, but I won't post BS and lies to others when the truth is the opposite."
I love Roku and will be holding for years to come but these growth stocks give me stress!
Which why I sold 3/4 of all my positions in Feb...Odds are for market correction. You wouldn't but $100 on black in Vegas to win $50 if lands would you? Same said for buying overpriced stocks at highs. Wait till you have edge on dealer. Then buy.
"ROKU price will stagnate until (1) it resolves the dispute with GOOGL (YouTube); (2) the Roku channel offers a more enticing, contemporary roster (3) Anthony Wood retains a promoter more inspiring than himself;(4) it expands its foray into gaming."
Remember when this was $30 and people were HATING with such passion and certitude and confidence because this was the next Fitbit and would soon be zero? Never forget that these are the same type of people hating now. Too weak to buy. Missed out when this was 10 percent of current price. It’s called jealousy.
So Roku goes down with the Market but doesn’t go up with the market?
"Tough week, sure! Now go enjoy the long weekend with family and friends. Best ahead!"
315 is a clear support level just look at the chart history. Who wouldn’t buy or take some position at this point?
"Everyone I just confess. I am the notorious buyer at 490 lol I won't lie, got caught in a short term trade for earnings and the Cathy wood sell killed me at first, held on for earnings to recoup then boom massive fall and I wasn't willing to sell because it was all fluff as to why it went down in the first place, then comes amazon news to further slam it.But guess what, no chance in hell am I selling. Everyone well the short noobs of the world just assume magically Amazon's going to crush yet they have duds all the time and I highly doubt they'll even dare to go full into this space. Not only that, it's just news and people have to actually purchase Amazon tvs and will want to go off reviews before purchasing, some obviously will just buy blindly and that's understandable to.What they are ultimately forgetting is in the last ER, they publicly stated that they are into the ad space and will want to continue to dominant that space, a 113B dollar industry at that and roku just broke into Germany and from there it will tumble thru Europe and pretty much every other area. And it's funny how the public reacted to less stream time and all those metrics, covid has loosened its grip so naturally people will go outside but people freaked and it still hasn't recovered. Massive buying opportunity but I'm not selling and intend to hold LONG and not worried one bit. I can see 400-600 in the next 3 months once it gains momentum, everyone still waiting for support, we almost had it at 350 then 320 so looks like sideways for a short while then upwards and onwards with the next ER "
You don’t sell a business growing revenues in the 80+% range with an RSI in the 30s
"Roku needs at least 15-20 quarters with growth 80-120% to get to a reasonable PE. It has been almost 20 years since the company was founded. How long do you think people will buy at 200PE? Me thinks the last quarter was the peak, hence the funds unloading."

Beautiful entry for anyone who has been waiting patiently.
"I make sure every tv I buy is a Roku tv. I bought ROKU at $353, and thought that was good. Picked up some more today to double my position since it's down some. A real bargain here in my opinion. Good luck all!"

Looks like Amazon it’s going to have something similar to Roku moving merchandise through the TV
Where does Amazon plan to showroom these new TVs? Who buys a TV sight unseen? Noise. Nothing but noise.Wake me at $500

"So I spent the day at my sons. It was my g-daughter first day in first grade. She’s not quite 7 yet. She comes home. We ask about her day. She tells us. Then she shows us something she learned from one of the kids. She turns around. Bends forward. And TWERKS! It’s sorta funny and cute. Except it’s not. A seven year old has no idea what that will reflect when she’s a teenager. My son laughs, but he and his wife are livid. Me too. Is this our future? And it’s a good school district in Bucks County Pa. So we ask how she learned it. She says “Shamika showed me.”Thanks Shamika. You’re parents will be getting a call from the school."

"Just a comment on Pelosi speaking about ‘breaking up WFC’. Political or otherwise, it’s market related. While I agree in principle that WFC shouldn’t get away with shady financial dealings, I’m not sure I wanna open that can of worms. Find another way. To me there’s the risk that a full break up and any resulting audit, might show even worse issues. This is the risk of bringing on more consequences and ramifications. What if WFC is found to have extremely cooked books and bad dealings? It leads to the potential domino effect of other banks in the same boat. And even if that’s not the case, it brings a dark cloud to banking. And hence the market. I’m not ready to see 2007-08 all over again."

"Just looked at google TV. You can buy theTCL 75"" for about $1405 before tax but the catch is you have to sign up for a $65+tax google TV subscription and they try to talk you into $100+tax per month to get Sling TV too. Shoot, it's getting as bad as cable and cord cutters won't have it"
Stephens inc analyst keep ‘overweight rating at $ 475 target.
"Nothing to worry about with Amazon, they just announced and if they are a threat we won't see it for years since ROKU is the out right leader. Acquisition most likely but before then this stock should still be 400-600 next year at least. again, Amazon won't be a threat for a few years and roku is making it clear it wants to dominant the ad space so already 5 steps ahead all noise and people are weak minded for the most part so makes sense they sold, there loss. Even if we go below 323 all good, the wise will come In and this stock will need to go where it needs to. Just like a super hot girl with good morals no rush it will come lol"

Steven’s father was always getting Jack Dover, while his mom Mona Lott. Steven is actually a pen name he uses for social media. His given name was Ben Dover. As one might expect he spent many years grabbing his ankles in order to live up to the name.Once Steven reached the age of 18, he legally changed his name. After years of being Ben Dover, he needed something more suitable for his current circumstances. Now he is legally Lou Spowls. The End"
All TVs now getting google or android tv ..Samsung has one version tv in every Samsung tv.most of the tv sold in us are either Samsung or Sony ..roku is losing big time on this market ..I don’t think any one will buy roku devices ..going forward very tough times for roku..

The jump for ROKU today is the reason why you NEVER sell your shares. Just add to the shares you have on dips like we are still in. ROKU will go a lot higher.
It’s going to rebound tomorrow for no reason
A few months ago. Cathy Woods spoke about covid stocks and Roku was one of them. While she said this. She slowly started to sell shares. Which caused others to sell.Those that want a reason for Roku recent drop. This is it.Sources. 2 different articles as well as her own website proves she's been selling.
"Yes ROKU is a great long-term investment with tremendous opportunity ahead and patience is the key to be successful in the stock market BUT I have to admit that this is my my annoying stock to own and I got in Oct 2020 at 225 the first time...Stay strong and patience and good luck to ya folks, don't let big money take your hardly earned money  shall rebound after next ER at the latest with new AH to come!"
"How are you red again today? Good grief, the negative sentiment continues after 50% drop."
"@ Rainbowmeow your post makes zeron sense. Do you buy gallon of milk $8 when you know it cost $4? No you don't. So you and others that said buy at highs and ""added"" more bought milk for twice the price. Do you go department store buy shirts $75 each when you KNOW in a few months they will be 30-50% off? No you don't. So why would you recommend buying high but not low on sale? Smart investors wait not for the summer sale but the clearance sale. Right now summer sale. Roku still has more to drop"
this stock isn’t worth 100 the streaming space is crowded and they really don’t make money.
"Seriously, Cathie Wood has explained why she sells her stocks a thousand times already. This week, she sold Tesla because it was up 30% and she wanted cash to buy PATH, which was down 10% recently. Why is that a mystery? Why do the finance bros always act like she has changed her conviction? Soon, she’ll be selling ROKU again. Get ready for it. It’s what she does. So many words have been wasted trying to explain why she does what she does when she’s already explained it."
Some news from managementWould be great any day to squeeze the shorts. Could see it rally 10-12%. Nice 10-17$ move

I sure miss the last administration. Is this seriously what people signed up for?! And not just about inflation and the abysmal market performance….just about everything has been miserable under this administration! What a difference 9 months makes.
"Yes, Vincent...we all know she's a giving her best. Happy Thursday y'all!"
"Summing upWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Roku has US$1.99b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. The cherry on top was that in converted 81% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$181m. So is Roku's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us."
"Original content announcements will start coming in. Content is king, platform is established."
"im new to roku and have taken a short positions simply because of the PE ratio, book value of $20.00 and the fact that $google tv will ship with new $tcl tv's and $amazon will ship two self branded tv's at the beginning of the month"
Unbelievable to me that this crashed 180 points in a month and a half over literally nothing. I never expected to see it go below 400 again. Man was I wrong.
market manipulation folks. buy more here and don't be afraid.
Dip buyers rewarded again. Day traders LOVE ROKU.
"Boy, have we seen this before. ROKU getting punished for no reason at all. 3 billion revenue this year and 5 billion next year. ROKU should be $1,000 today."

One year target for ROKU on yahoo finance is $470
"If Roku doesn’t start climbing, I’m gonna ask the wife to have kids. For each one you get more stim checks. You get the $300 monthly payment. And some parts of the country will pay you $300 a month if you drive your kids to school, cause no one wants to drive a bus fir $25/hr!!Seriously! You can get around $10g per year, per kid. And if you’re low income you can get SNAP and CHIP too. Have kids! Make love AND money!!!What a country!! "
It went green. Holy smokes break out the whisky
"This is a growth stock remember, if you cannot handle the swings you shouldn't be in this position. Roku can return big rewards when it does go up. Hold on for the ride. Roku also could be a takeover candidate, platform is already there. Buy Buy Buy $$$$$$"
"two paths, both successful for Roku but only the first option will give you netflix/msft-type returns.1. the migration of all TV manufacturers over to one or two operating systems -- Roku one of them. That reality has at least stalled for the time being as Vzio serves as a bellwether in that instead of adopting Roku they are trying to emulate the Roku model. If Roku is to be the Microsoft of streaming it's at least going to take more time to see this become a reality than previously thought.. This option is the greatest potential for Roku as a company and the only option that can justify paying such a high multiple; the only option that will make this stock a life changer like Netflix and MSFT did for so many.2. Roku solidifies itself as a great company as it takes advantage of it's current 30%-plus market share and provides strong growth for it's investors in a fragmented highly competitive streaming landscape that continues to see multiple successful operating systems. In this option Roku will not be over $800 p/share anytime soon and will struggle in the short term to justify it's current valuation especially in a market that's continues to be due for a pullback.I was all in on Roku because of the first point. I still think Roku is a leading candidate if or when that happens as the streaming world must organize, but apparently it's not likely to happen anytime soon. In this market climate and if we experience a broader market pullback as anticipated, Roku will drop to the low 200's. As I said when Roku was well above $400 back in July, my bottom is $228. I'll be buying starting at $250."

Market down and Roku green on Friday can’t complain
Let me guess. Another down day. Geeezzzz
Bought under 330. This is the rebound area IMO.
We are now above the 200 day MA. This is so important that it recaptured this and that we hold it until the end of the day. Hard Support at 350. All weak hands are gone. Now off to new highs. Enjoy the ride.

"We all know many sellers/fence sitters will get caught off guard one of these days, and ROKU will skyrocket much higher. ROKU IS ALWAYS EASY MONEY for patient dip buyers. "
I work for a marketing company that works with Roku. Just heard VCR - Video completion rate for ads on Amazon and Roku OTT is %98. That’s a pretty good rate Isn’t it?
"As I said earlier this morning.. ROKU has been dropping 2-3% everyday for weeks.. When the market goes up or down. This company has tons of cash, revenue income and continued growth. Excellent business model.. Yes, there is competition, But Really... Down over 35% from the high. Totally nuts but this is not the first time... Just wait until it is finished doing it's thing and buy, buy, buy.."

2 Green Day’s in row is a good sign. Hope this is a good support forming.
Jan 2024 options began trading today. Did some calendar rolling today but didn't get round to ROKU options yet. Will look at that tomorrow. Things look promising.
"Don Pugetch, says BUY!"
"Cheerleader pumper John once again spams ""buy dips"" as he said for 100th time this year. Instead of saying nope. Not great idea. His buddies Ray and Blue Fox upvote and support him. So they agree with posters that say ""add more and buy at highs"" Then turn around and say they never did? Why not call out your pumping buddie John? Tell.him he's been wrong and spamming is bad. Go on do it. Chickens"
"Lookup the cathiesark website when you all get a chance. Since September 3rd...ARKW - 180,095 shares purchased, ARKK - 103,098 shares purchased. If the site is correct, it looks like they hold just under 4million shares total. All the noise out there are from folks who missed out on the early gains of roku or bought at these higher prices and have no patience. Timing is everything. The business plan is intact and the management team is executing per the last few earnings reports. Best ahead!"

So as you can see Steven you piker... im loving life. And it gets even better! I'm holding these shares all the way through the shift from linear tv to streaming and cashing all my chips at the end whether that's $600 a share, 700 or higher. Add it all up and the answer is obvious... the passengers on this train won and you lost. Oh well..."

Roku 4K+ 2021 is the No. 1 seller on amazon: Electrics/New Releases
"I’d be more likely to buy a TV built by Caterpillar or John Deere. Certainly if it came with a ROKU OS. Just shows that Fire TV cannot compete with ROKU in getting deals with TV OEMs. Those OEMs will now be motivated to drop any deals they have with Amazon, and potentially go back to just ROKU."
It's acting like the old Roku....holding or going up when the market is down!
"I was ready to say,""someone wake up Vincent"".... but he is awake...My friend, where is the 200 day? thank you, Tim"
"Well, the PE is under 200 now! "
"Reaching the younger generation is so, so difficult. So much so that companies like Walmart are spending billions for a STAKE in TikTok. Very few platforms have succeeded in reaching the millennials/Gen Z. Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, TikTok being some examples. ROKU has the ability to be in this group."
"I'm still going to keep with my gut prediction - $500 by Christmas, 2021. Long ROKU!"
Look at the price action on June 14 and June 15 this summer. Look what this craziness preceded. It was the final shake out before the surge. This action looks very similar.
330+ next wk
"Shorts will make a coordinated effort to take it down to $365 to bail themselves out. If volume picks up again then, you should buy at will."
What will make Roku stock go up?
I'm not selling
"2 months ago I witnessed the Roku cheerleaders buying clothes. Right next to the clothes encap there was a sign. ""On sale next week 30% off""But they still all bought them. They even said they will come back tomorrow and ""add more""The cashier even said.""You know those will be on sale in a week did you want to wait?""They responded with insults and gave the store 1 star reviews. They came back 2 weeks later and demanded a refund or that the price gets put higher to what they bought at. They seen the line of people buying. Knowing they got cheaper price they were upset.They started to chant and spam outside the shop. The cheerleaders are legend and stories still say they are stil there chanting."
Next support is $311 I believe.Broke $331 . Over sold!I’m long!
Signs of encouragement at last
