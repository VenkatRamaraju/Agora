"Not that congress is getting involved I'm guessing Google will be forced to leave their apps in the Roku store. Keep in mind existing customers are grandfathered it, they can't remove the app from their Roku devices."
The wisest thing that should be on everyone mind currently should be to invest in different streams of income that doesn't depend on the government especially with the current economy crisis around the world
And then on Monday we get the news that Amazon news was a fake news and you tube issues resolved up$20 plus back to the highs !
"Best ahead! US streamer Roku supports Brazilian push with São Paulo FC dealUS streaming giant Roku has taken a one-year sponsorship with Brazil’s São Paulo Futebol Clube, its first step into football club sports marketing in the country. Roku launched in Brazil in 2020 as an affordable service with easy-to-use streaming devices, carrying more than 100,000 movies and TV episodes from channels like Netflix and Globoplay.Roku’s logo is on each shoulder of the club shirt, as well as on training kit, interview backdrops, and signage in the training centers, among other assets. No value was given for the sponsorship.“São Paulo Futebol Clube’s sponsorship reinforces the desire to be even closer to the Brazilian community, encouraging one of its greatest passions. We want to bring streaming to all football fans and we want to be present in their football marathons, movies and series”, says Luis Bianchi, Marketing Director for Roku in Latin America.Roku is a pioneer in streaming and has grown its business rapidly via Roku TV models and Roku streaming players that provide aggregated content from rights holders and other media organisations to subscribers. In 2020 it generated revenue of $1.78 billion and has a market capitalisation of more than $47 billion.“It is with great satisfaction that we welcome Roku to our team of sponsors. It is a large North American technology company, which proves the power of São Paulo to deliver with great results to partners. This new sponsorship reinforces how we are always attentive to global changes and their trends, with a vision focused on innovation and opportunities to expand our brand together with those of our partners,” said Eduardo Toni, Marketing Director of São Paulo Futebol Clube."
"It's selling off this week due to fear of bad earning. That means 2 things: 1) If the quarter wasn't good the worst of the sell-off is behind us 2) If the quarter was good... oh boy... leave the bar cars, get back in your seats and fasten your seat belt cause we will be blowing past stations."
"Just a lot of nervous nellies with weak hands selling now, you’d think the sky was falling, it’s just an earnings report for goodness sake’s, This to will pass and we will be back to businesses as usual, slow and steady wins the race, patience here!!!"
"This weeks Newest Roku Cheerleader award goes to …. ** Drums ** RDL!!Congrats to RDL! Welcome to the Roku Cheerleading Squad. Blue Fox Trained you well!RDL has a interesting story. He claims to have been here for 15 Earnings, yet, started only posting last week. His FIRST post ever, was him insulting me 10 days ago.Since then, he has been pumping nonstop. While ranting about analyst who are wrong and don't know what they are doing. Before then deleting his post after I called him out on his little lies. His post earlier gave him the new title of a Roku Cheerleader and is what gave him the win this week!RDL said 8 hours ago.""I generally always feel better when Roku heads into the report on weakness. Since they always outperform the stock reacts more positively because it's always a question of how much they beat by and not whether they beat.""Not once did any billionaire or expert ever said stocks are better when they are dive bombing before earnings.From my experience, it means large holders are unloading because they do not believe the company will make earnings or fall short. So who to believe, a cheerleader or... common sense?RDL claims to also be long but has been pumping spamming nonstop. Almost as if he is convincing himself he made a good investment by buying high and now trying to break even. There are some honest folk here who actually admitted they bought high and not trying to hide it. (hats off to you all)"
"Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter's lowered PT is no concern for me. He is Ben Swinburne light..Pachter, the man who famously said on CNBC back in 2010-2012 sell Netflix, has missed the mark on Roku from day 1. While not nearly as bad as Morgan Stanley's Swinburne, Pachter has always managed to be blind to the Roku story - no surpriseNovember 7, 2019 Pachter came out with a $105 PT on Roku, saying this: “less impressive than the elevated share price required” and commented further by saying, ""while Roku has a number of growth levers, the path to success won’t necessarily be smooth."""
Wedbush lowers price target from 475 to 415 sighting supply chain issue and less advertising now how would they know this today?
"I would venture to say we get the same reaction as Netflix. If we have great earnings and profits and membership increase, I see a dip and then off to the races into the end of the year. We will see￼￼, long and strong and I love this stock!!! Great future.."
"Nothing has changed since IPO.Roku is the perpetual underdog, continually having to prove itself. Concerns over digital ads -- Roku will get pounded more than is justified. Concern over competition -- Roku will drop even more than it should because every time competition is mentioned Roku always gets wacked. Concerns over the stay at home spike ending and user accounts still tepid -- Roku will not get the benefit of the doubt. The fact of the matter is Roku has exceeded expectations in every report, dropping after ER a few times because of the perception that price action got ahead of it's skis and not because of any story changing failure on the part of the company.The story is intact and this sometimes demoralizing price action is nothing new. Roku is the David next to the Goliaths and has been since 2017. One day there will be a tipping point when that is not the case but until then it's business as usual. This doesn't mean Roku stock will spike up in November after the report; there's certainly no guarantee of that no matter how promising this growth story remains. What it does mean is that even if the market punishes Roku further next month, the long term story is as powerful as ever. If Roku spikes up, great. If Roku dips significantly I will confidently buy the dip because I think at the very least 2022 will be a stellar year for this stock -- similar to the performance of 2019.. have a great weekend!"
"Redbox mid-2022 deal with Roku users and Walmart shoppers will offer a $5 credit toward movie rentals when consumers download the Redbox app via their Roku player. Smith believes, “there’s an opportunity for us to help bring our customer base to these devices like we’re doing with Roku, and that’s probably a better use of our resources than doing our own device…That’s why we’re doing the promotion with Roku because we’re helping to bring new customers to Roku through the sale of Redbox promotion-led devices at Walmart.”"
"My take is earnings beat. But given the qtr includes summer months, and given folks have been confining themselves to home for the last 1 year, they might have gotten out more, and the subscription and streaming hours may come low. This does not mean (s)low growth in an absolute sense. The point we need to remember is, Y2Y comparison is meaningless when the previous year was abnormal due to pandemic and the growth was an outlier. IMH any analyst not foreseeing this and making adjustments isn't doing the calculations right.ROKU has been doing consistently better, making good business decisions over the years (going back past the pandemic year). From that angle I would expect the company to post good results. Again, last year metrics were outliers, and it shouldn't be a disappointment for savvy analysts and investors if similar metrics are not observed this time.Even speaking of the last earnings in August, I don't agree ROKU disappointed. It was investors and analysts who failed to factor in the effect of vaccinations, ending of pandemic, and increased out door activities. Those who got shocked, in my view, partly set themselves up for disappointment with their incorrect forecasts / expectations. ROKU has the potential to grow at healthy pace, will likely better than its growth rate prior to the pandemic, which is what counts in my view. As for stock price, that's hard to predict. I see a lot of irrationality in the investment trends (like unjustifiable exuberence and panic). Hard to predict how people pump or dump or for what reason."
Oct 4 2021 it was 295.. Do not over panic cheezzz
"OK ROKUs ARPU of $34-$36 is PER YEAR.That's only $3 per month! People have been willing to spend $200 per month for cable and are spendind $14/month for NFLX.ROKU has MILES to run yet to capture the money people are willing to spend on entertainment.That fully justifies the currently high P/E , IMO"
"Roku is a good product. The company is beginning to show investors a little encouragement and respect with some profit. Longs, just relax and buy the deep valleys."
"Roku in a nutshell- last sixteen quarters, it's BEAT revenue growth- Just started international expansion. Let that sink in. Just.- PS is moving lower and PE as well- No longer a hardware company but software and advertising- Considering cable TV is on its last legs, this is the future and we are still in 1st placelong term we're fine. Short term there might be ups and downs but long term we're gold. Just like Netflix, they didn't pop off until they expanded into different countries and were just beginning now. this is a totally different company than a few years ago so to say, growth has stalled etc is bogus lol long term roku. Next 3-5 years see this going over $700-$800 and that latest shopify deal was massive. If we lose out on the amazon prime that will suck but not overly worried thinking big picture"
"stock manipulation before earnings date, seen that before.someone must be loading up"
"Roku needs to add a user-created content category to its Roku Channel, just next to the Live TV icon, and start directly competing against YouTube. They could drop the heavy handed censorship that Google loves so much. And maybe offer better terms to the content creators. Maybe this dispute will push Roku in that direction. Could end up being a good thing…"
"Hey guys. I know it ain’t a sexy stick. Or a multi bagger. But Ford just blew out numbers, and restarted dividend. Also strong guidance. If you’re looking for something relatively safe from a major drop, with the chance to gain another 25% in 3-6 months, take a look. I think it goes from $16 to $20 within 6 months. The E-Stang and E-150 has its fans/buyers."
"I’m thinking about selling some Tesla and buying some Roku LEAPs. For Roku call investors, what kind of time horizon and strike price would you suggest?"
"Top 5 tailwinds in Roku's favor going into next year: 1. current marketing blitz on a level of exposure I haven't seen in 3.5 years I've been following this company -- it will take time to pay off but it will in fact pay off. 2. a still largely untapped international market for Roku, meaning it's all extra frosting on the cake -- future increases will have a noticeable affect on earnings. 3. a growing perception that Roku as a company offers you a trustworthy and viable alternative to the large tech monopolies that are increasingly becoming less popular. 4. the multitude of TV manufacturers Roku's OS is installed on, a reality unmatched by competitors. 5. the technical superiority of the Roku OS over other alternatives even without any additional subscription to enhance your experience such as the case with Amazon -- to get the most out of Amazon you really need to be a subscriber."
"U.S. connected TV (CTV) advertising revenue will reach $14.4 billion this year — up 44% from $9.04 billion in 2020 and 125% from 2019’s $6.43 billion, according to the latest estimates from eMarketer.The forecast calls for the total to grow by another 67.7% by the end of 2023, to reach $24.2 billion.Hulu, YouTube and Roku will continue to dominate ad revenue going forward, but fast-growing newer rivals Pluto TV and Tubi (and to a lesser extent, smaller verticals) will continue to eat away at their shares."
@dave it’s likely due to Comcast earnings report that showed a 1.6M drop in subscribers confirming the cord cutting tend

"AMZN , ATT , DIS , or APPL will buy ROKU"
@ fake Steven. You are talking about taking profits now? You are late. That was suppose to be done in February and again in July. I sold High 400s so I am happy. Wish is a bust atm. But my other investments used with Roku profits have been great. FuboPortillosZimDwac in out fastUnited steelCan't win them all. I still have hope in Wish. May take a few years lol.
A little internet/ctv ad based company PERI delivered a great earnings call today. Looks like ROKU and TTD should do just fine.
"Roku’s claims already caught the eye of two of the most important members of Congress attempting to rein in Big Tech through antitrust legislation. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., sided with Roku on Thursday.The fight between the two companies centers on a 2019 agreement to allow YouTube TV on Roku. Roku said Google demanded special access to search data from Roku customers as a condition of allowing YouTube TV on Roku devices. Roku also said Google asked for prioritized search results for YouTube videos in Roku’s search feature.Roku said it agreed to those terms, but also asked that Google not ask for any additional data. Google would not commit to that, according to Roku, and now both sides are at an impasse. Unless both companies come to an agreement before Dec. 9, YouTube’s apps will disappear from Roku’s app store."
Blue Fox I told you yesterday to buy LCID! I was confident in Roku in 2018 and it took 3 years to find that same level of confidence in another stock and that stock is Lucid Motors.
"Go take a look at the latest news release, ""Expanded Comprehensive Coverage is Major Milestone Towards Nielsen ONE"" and it spells out the future for the advertising/marketing arm of Roku. Accumulate when you can and make smart trades when necessary. Best ahead!"
"""Roku, which is working to launch the first-ever TV streaming advertising app on the Shopify App Store expected in time for the holiday shopping season, making it easier for small businesses to afford advertising on TV."""
Everyone enjoy their weekend! Both bar cars are open. I'm off to catch the Stone Temple Pilots show at the casino. Robert/Fox- Make sure both bar cars don't run our of Titos while I'm gone. See you Monday friends!

"Not crazy volume here going into earnings, down 15 points on only 3.5 million, have to say the sky’s not falling on Roku, looks like somebody wants some cheap shares going into earnings, no matter, holding here since $153 with 900 shares. I’ll wait this one out!!"
Market all time highs and we are down 32% for the past three to four months ? Any thoughts?
Roku succeded beat analysts predicitions last 16 quarters?
"Spotify just posted great numbers, advertising dollars growing, this is great for Roku!!"
"Hmmmm, price sagging going into earnings with supply bottlenecks at ports possibly delaying sales. Bad juju….. I’m out and selling 290 puts to get back in."
This will be my 15th Roku earnings report and for what it's worth I generally always feel better when Roku heads into the report on weakness. Since they always outperform the stock reacts more positively because it's always a question of how much they beat by and not whether they beat. INot a technical analysis obviously simply my sentiment going in.
