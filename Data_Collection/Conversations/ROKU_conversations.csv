"this morning: Roku reiterated Buy at Deutsche bankDeutsche Bank analyst Jeffrey Rand believes the Roku Channel is well positioned to take a ""leading position"" in the advertising-based video on demand market. The channel continues to expand its content, offers an attractive viewership experience versus competitors and demands a premium cost per thousand impressions due to Roku's first party viewership data, Rand tells investors in a research note. Post channel checks and analysis, the analyst has increased confidence in the growth strategy for Roku Channel and Roku's opportunity to leverage its first party data to receive premium pricing on its ad inventory. He maintains a Buy rating on Roku shares.Also after earnings on 3 weeks ago.Roku reiterated BUY with $650 price target at Cannonball ResearchRoku price target raised to $600 from $560 at DA Davidson, BUYRoku price reiterated BUY with a $550 price target at BenchmarkRoku UPGRADED to Overweight from Equal Weight with a $475 price target(from $400) at Stephens"
Normally I would say that this is a little fishy and think its being help in place with very little volume and movement. but this is a very tight range for roku. push it down and get some people to sell their stock but it can equally be said they are trying to hold it up so others can sell their stock. we will know soon enough. whether new good or bad comes out it will probably make sense then.
"Big week, charts show big upswing. We've hit the bottom, that's a fact but now we're looking to 360-370 next two three days. Let's pray the nasdaq wants to keep climbing but won't be long when nasdaq and everything else crashes"
"Very important week here guys. Support has been reached since for the past week, week and a half have been relatively green and based on the charts looks like we are now poised for a rebound. This would be the time for hedge funds etc to start picking this up so fingers crossed! Really hope we start climbing again to new highs before the world realizes we are heading for a depression, not a recession but a depression... all signs point to it inflations high as ever pretty much across the board!"

"Friends! I just stopped the train for a few hours tonight so I could check out the NY State Fair. Great time. Deep fried oreos, fried dough and I washed it all down with about 10 Titos and soda. I'm back in the driver's seat now though. I did a walk through and Robert, Fox, Shannon, Wayne and Steady Hands are all in their sleeping cars like good boys and girls. See you in the morning!"

Very low volume and going sideways for a while. But I really think we are getting ready to launch upwards.
Nasdaq down about 100 but we just shed a buck and change on great volume. I'll take it. Very positive sign.
"We all know many sellers/fence sitters will get caught off guard one of these days, and ROKU will skyrocket much higher. ROKU IS ALWAYS EASY MONEY for patient dip buyers. "
"Connected TV (CTV) accounts for 60% of total ad views, with Roku and Fire TV devices continuing to lead with 43% and 26% of CTV views, respectively."
"just pre-ordered the 2022 TCL Roku 65"" 8K @ 120 Hz with my premiums from covered calls :)"
Friends! Looks like ordering those new parts over the weekend when I was at the lake house and installing them on Monday was the right call. That and all the profit takers and weak long hands were all out the other day when I made that post.
"I do not disagree that a stock trading sideways in an up-trending market is poised for a fall. I’ve been in ROKU long enough to know, that it often marches to the beat of another drum. Regardless, even though I concur we could be in for a short term drop, the long term potential far outweighs minimal short term downside risk. For you to sit back and bash while maintaining a position seems silly to me. If you don’t like the action, get out. But don’t whine about it."
I wonder how many college students are showing up to campus/dorm room with a new Roku TV?
"On a Roku note, not an awe inspiring week, but maybe some signs of a ST base. It did close a bit higher than last Friday. Have a good weekend all."
"We need a big $20 day, this stock doesn't move well with nasdaq at all"
This is a great stock to rotate some profits to... has been beaten down on great earning and has not seen a significant bounce with the market lately.... almost trades like a china stock.
Zero volume. Like I said the other day friends... thr profit takers are out and the weak hands are out. It's only hedge funds and long retail that are involved in this freight train now that is up 140% over the last year.
Zoom was out with earnings and some people think Roku is tied to these pandemic stocks. Not.
