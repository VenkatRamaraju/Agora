"The patent they just received titled ""load balancing across origin servers"" is huge. Let's see what happen to the share price :-)"
"Why do so many hate this stock so much? I’m holding my 200 shares through earnings. Got to turn it around, right?"
"When we have an earnings surprise and shorts begin to cover, we’ll be in for a nice SP!"
"An investment company called Long Walk Management that has $175m under management in Connecticut has filed their 13F for July-Aug-Sept. During the quarter they bought 103,000 shares of FSLY, and they ended the quarter owning 429,000 shares. Long Walk only owns 6 stocks, so obviously they like to concentrate on their best ideas, and FSLY is one of those. A nice vote of confidence for FSLY."
Firm just bought $50 million worth of shares. Nobody does that with a failing company. Nobody does that listing to shills on yahoo forums.
This earning needs to be good after sluggish growth in previous quarters.
Today is the kinda day that the bag holding from 80 doesn’t feel to bad.
"Alli McCartney, a Managing Director at UBS Wealth Management, was on Closing Bell on CNBC on Monday. Q3 earnings will start to be reported by companies later this week. McCartney said that she is expecting a strong earnings season, and therefore she believes that recent declines in stock prices represent a buying opportunity.In the April-May-June quarter, UBS increased its position in FSLY by 83% with a buy of 168,000 shares. After the big decline in the stock price from well over $100, I think a lot of investors see FSLY as attractively priced at current levels."
"(NYSE:FSLY) shares were trading higher Tuesday after the company was granted a U.S. patent titled ""load balancing across origin servers."""

Close above 50 alert
"Richard Weiss, the CIO at American Century, was on Bloomberg-The Close on Friday. He said that he likes small cap stocks right now. American Century was holding 645,000 shares of FSLY as of June 30, so if they're buying small caps right now, they may be adding to their position in FSLY."
"The New Jersey state employees pension fund has filed their 13F for Q3. They owned 67,000 shares as of Sept 30, including 7,200 purchased in Q3. Not huge numbers of shares but I always like to see pension fund investors. They do a lot of due diligence and they only invest people's pension money in solid businesses, nothing speculative."
I see no reason to own this over $30. It's going down !
If the earnings even they miss on revenue or eps by narrow margin it goes back to 35. But if they beat or meet the street expectations it will go 65 easily . Good luck !
This patent alone is worth more then 5X what FSLY is trading for right now! This stuff is genius...
"FSLY was granted a patent... apparently what's leading to the spike today. (However, still looking for source communications)."
We just can't seem to hold the momentum. We are back to red again.
fsly breaks your heart...sell at least half position pre-earnings
I smell a earnings surprise. Does anyone else smell it? Surprise profit? Maybe? $80 price tag....
"$FSLY is about to explode in revenue now that they are already working with Microsoft. $100 is when I'll think about exiting some of my shares, not a dollar sooner."
Patent Secured ! !
"Yesterday was a holiday (for the bond market) so a lot of the Wall St. strategists are out with notes today. Tom Lee, one of the most widely followed strategists on the Street, is saying that his base case continues to be that stocks will rally into year end. Marko Kolanovic at JP Morgan, who is also widely followed, believes Covid/Delta has peaked, and that investors should maintain a pro-risk allocation. And UBS is saying that the ""Equity Rally Has Further To Run"". My view is that we're going to get a positive report from FSLY on Nov 3, and that investors should be buying the stock ahead of the report. As of June 30, UBS owned 371,000 shares of FSLY, and JP Morgan owned 178,000. I think we'll see significant buying by these and other institutional investors once FSLY reports their quarter."
"Seeing some buying by institutional investors on Friday. A large block traded at around 10:10am. Morgan Stanley, Blackrock, Vanguard, State Street, and Credit Suisse all owned over 1m shares as of June 30. One of these large investors may be adding to their position today."
"Kristina Hooper, Invesco's strategist, was on Wall St Week on Bloomberg on Friday. Bloomberg's David Westin asked about speculation in cryptocurrencies and in SPACS. Hooper said she thought that this action may be a sign of some froth in financial markets right now. However, it's also a sign that investors are looking for returns and willing to consider risk assets. In her view, this is a sign that the bull market in stocks has further to run. As of June 30, Invesco owned 86,000 shares of FSLY, including 6,000 shares purchased during April-May-June. Invesco will be filing their Q3 13F in the next several weeks. It will be interesting to see if they added some additional shares to their position."
"A lot of people on here trying to spread FUD. Shorts are worried. This room is usually dead. I’m guessing earnings pop. That mixed in with, positive forward expectations and higher than usual short interest should trigger a nice run up."
"Buying FSLY today is going to be like playing a roulette,,,"
Have you guys ever heard of http://alert-sounds.com/? The picks on there are way better than FSLY
"Brian Belski, the strategist at Bank of Montreal, was on the Halftime Report on CNBC on Friday. Some strategists have been recommending selling tech stocks and rotating into other sectors like energy, but Belski is saying no, don't sell tech. He believes tech and communications services will be the best sector over the next several years because that's where the growth is. As of June 30 Bank of Montreal owned 33,000 shares of FSLY. They'll be filing their 13F for the July-Aug-Sept quarter in the next couple of weeks. Since they like tech it will be interesting to see if they've added to what was a relatively modest position in FSLY on June 30."
"I bought this at SP of 75 and holding it, and thought the name of company FSLY as it went down ""Fastly""..So happy to see this anf know it can go up ""Fastly"" as well :D"
"Morgan Stanley has been the most bearish firm on Wall St lately. Their strategist, Mike Wilson, has been calling for a selloff in stocks throughout this year. But now, he's turning more positive. He's out with a note on Monday saying, ""Equity markets may remain well bid in the near term."" I saw him on Squawk Box on CNBC on Monday and he likes tech. He said that companies are going to start investing more in technology.As of June 30, Morgan Stanley was FLSY's largest shareholder, with 13.5m shares, including around 400,000 shares that they bought in Q2. They obviously like the stock. Now that they're turning more positive on the market, and expecting increased investment in technology, it wouldn't be a surprise if they started adding to their position in FSLY."
Lowering target from $30 to 20 with strong sell rating !
"Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, was on Squawk Box on CNBC on Wednesday. He noted that the stock market lately has been trading up and down, but he said that he's bullish longer term and that he's eventually expecting to see a series of higher highs in the market. A large block shares traded on Wednesday just before 2pm, looked like an institutional investor coming in and buying. Blackrock is one of FSLY's largest shareholders. As of June 30, they owned 4.2m shares, including 441,000 that they bought during April-May-June. Who knows, maybe they added more shares today."
"An investment company called Adirondack Retirement Specialists which has $100m under management in Queensbury, New York (about 50 miles north of Albany) has filed their 13F for the July-Aug-Sept quarter. During the quarter they added 7500 shares to their position in FSLY, and they ended the quarter owning 117,000 shares. Adirondack only owns 19 stocks, so obviously they like to concentrate on their best ideas, and FSLY is one of those. A nice vote of confidence for FSLY."
Institutional investors are moving into FSLY today. Volume of 1.2m shares in the first hour of trading today. I expect a good earnings report from FSLY on Nov 3.
"Adobe is out with its online holiday shopping forecast. They're predicting a record $207b in sales - this is positive for FSLY, especially now that Amazon is back on the network."
Cloud game development is gonna boom. They are already working with Microsoft Azur. They are gonna make a lot of money.
What's going on?
"I'm sorry, it was $984 million they raised for the purchase price of $102 by 2026. When Fastly starts moving up, it's gonna be quick. How does an $80 up day sound??"
FSLY Has been oversold for too long. Time to get what it’s worth. $100+ EOY.
