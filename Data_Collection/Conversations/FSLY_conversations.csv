"Boy, did this board die out. Where's all the $100 pumpers now? Moved over to Cloudflare I guess"
"Price is at $41.50 and the RSI is still only 30, meaning it's still oversold"
"Over bought, like all stocks"
$UBER $Fsly BTFD doesn't work with these stocks...
Amazon back to n/w now it’s time for TikTok.
Fsly to 50?
sell sell sell
"i new here , i did mu DD ...six month ago the share price was 110 down to 33 due to a COVID AND SOLD BY INSIDERS... with no time this will be 50 dollars"
They had some interesting insights about FSLY on (http://Thetraderguide.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Over 500,000 shares of volume in the first 15 minutes of trading. Definitely institutional investors buying."
$fsly is still on top of list of cml pro. Cml pro recommended nvda years ago. Fsly is currently sitting on the top of the list. fsly will rocket soon. Patience is virtue. Fsly shaking weak hands

Some rookie chaser bought at $140 and just sold at $40.
"Wow. If we close above $40, I am going to personally thank God."
people selling this morning based on temporary problem caused by outage! Let’s give it a year & see where we at at is my take !
I have 1000 shares @ $59.08. I belive in this company and have to (not by choice lol) to be a long with this one. If it rises I will buy more but at this point its enough to see ~60K converting into 48K. Hopefuly I will be rewarded for my patience.
The massive insider selling was a tip off........................................
"Just listened to the Oppenheimer Conference presentation from last week. The company see 10s of thousands, maybe 100k, potential customers out there. They're driving towards $1b in annual sales and growth of 30%+ - they see 10 years of 30% growth. Just bot 1,000 shares in the low 40s. I doubt the stock will do much short term, but I like the long term outlook. I encourage everybody to listen to the Oppenheimer Conference presentation from last week."
"Yep. They will have plenty of spare kitty to spend on M&A , after a last minute decision not to acquire the UK based Morrisons supermarket. Parhaps the Morrisons withdrawal was done precisely so that they could target Fastly. Because, rest assured once Amazon makes a move, they all will : Cisco, Alphabet etc"
What will be a good price to load this up?
Another ARK funds that plunged today.
I think old trick again. Rise a bit to attract buyer then drop after then.
"FSLY was trading in the 30s all last week, doing a bit better today. I think the stock can move up into the mid-40's over the next several months. Keep in mind there will be tax loss selling. By December/January a lot of the tax loss sellers will be buying back in, new money will also be coming in, and the stock should go."
is it pump and dump or legit move?
Shorts are going to get burned.
"Alicia Levine, the market strategist at BNY Mellon, was on Bloomberg - The Close on Thursday. In the very short run she's got some concerns about the stock market - concerns about Covid/Delta and supply chain disruptions. But medium to longer term she remains positive and feels the market can move higher. She said we're now past the peak of economic growth and she now likes technology/growth stocks that can grow their earnings in a slower growing economy.As of June 30, BNY Mellon owned close to 600,000 shares of FSLY, and they added 23,000 shares in the April-May-June quarter. FSLY is a fast growing company, the kind of company that BNY Mellon is now looking for, so I would expect them to be buying an increasing number of shares in the current quarter and later quarters."
I trashed this stock and bailed at $50 and predicted a $20 stock and ya’ll said I was crazy. Well watch the bottom fall totally out tomorrow. This place is done. They need to find a buyer or it’s lights out!
When you average down.. it keep going down. This time was different!!
"FSLY surely needs a new management. I remember in last ER call after shares tumbled 20% in AH, there were at least 3 analysts questioning about the upward revision of the full year revenue guidance during the call. One analyst brought up a very logical question. What drives the upward revision of the full year revenue guidance when Q2 guidance is flat to Q1, and historically Q3 sequential growth was 7~8% in 2019 & 2020? So mathematically Q4 will need 30% sequential growth to meet the low end of their revised revenue guidance of full year 2021. The CFO said it is from the management confidence, and the results remain to be seen! #$%$A quarter later, the full year guidance is now revised down by more than 10%. What is the reputation of the management?"
"get ready head up to $60, FSLY!"
bought at 34.10 and average now at 57.5;0)
Morgan Stanley owns 800 million dollars worth and Vanguard owns 600 million dollars worth.Today was just the #$%$ hedgefunds manipulating on earnings report like they do on every stock every quarterly report. Lmao BUYBUYBUY!
"The stock market trading is like sailing a ship on a rough sea and if you ain't got an experienced captain at the deck, your ship is sure to crash!!! Likewise, trading, the importance of a mentor is never overlooked, cos no matter how good the strategy is, you might get confused at a point and that's where the expertise comes on and if not properly guided. It will result in a whole lot of losses. That's why it's pertinent to have a very good trader to guide you. Crypto still remains the Future of Finance, I will advise every investor to keep buying and trading, to increase your portfolio this month by working with Joe Albert through his registered investment company. Just do something that will make you money while you sleep, no matter how little. The pandemic has been a perfect eye-opener for us all to really see how life can be without your usual income stream.

Fastly shareholders still holding after going all in at $120 LOL
Imagine working for this company walking into work because you can’t afford a car in Silicon Valley while Ferrari’s & Lamborghini’s whiz by you going to their jobs!
"And the management is making the market aware of this during earnings call, and not pre-announce bad news as it is required to??"
They tanked one or two quarters ago but has since been hyped by cramer and other analysts....sorry for those who lost..
"New short interest data is just out for Aug 13. Compared to July 30, FSLY short interest dropped by about 13% to 18.8m. Apparently there was a lot of short covering when the stock traded 50m shares on Aug 5. But as of Aug 13, there was still 18.8m shares sold short, so additional short covering could give the stock a boost for a while and help offset tax loss selling."
Who is buying here pre-market ?
Made some quick cash on this #$%$.. just sold it all
even Cathie wood sold this #$%$ in May
had 2500 shares two weeks agodumped 2000 thank godwish i dumped the rest too
Will buy after hours at $35
"People who make the $FSLY and $NET comparison time and time again fail to understand that these are two fundamentally different companies; starting with products, the revenue models, and all the way up to leadership (Prince and Zatlyn!). Cloudflare is going to fundamentally become a part of internet infrastructure while Fastly is just a CDN. I feel extremely confident holding $NET for the next 10 years and will buy any dip."
"Go back and read my post before closing I said $30 easy just by reading the options chart. Doesn’t hurt the CEO Bixby sold $30,000,000 in stock so far this year LOL "

All I can say is what I said at the last earnings report… this is dropping fastly!
Where are the earnings ?
I see $20 on this.
so far so good on those 34s
This is going to 60+
"The last time Fsly cratered on earnings in May, it fully recovered 35 days later. I bought long here expecting another recovery. Fastly is trading at a price to sales of 12x. Compare that to Cloudflare, currently trading at a 76x multiple"
Amazon probably figured out fastly is best in class
It’s been a painful year for this stock. My sense is the worst is over. Huge market for their services. It’s oversold and I’ve added to my position.
The macro economic situation coupled with Democrats inability to govern will lead to a 20-30% drop in stocks in the next 2 months
Back to $16. This is sad
GAP @$24. See you there
I am curios. The analysts are mark this down this morning like anything and drop their target prices down to $33 level and this happens? Who is buying it.
"If you want content delivery company, by $LLNW it is at the bottom. $FSLY will be $5 stock 8n few quarters."
"Don’t buy , dead money now"
"Glad that I averaged down last week. Even if fsly is not profitable in any way yet, I strongly believe in this business."
This will be the turnaround story of the century. Cloud flare is 10 times market cap and is in the same business.
Exactly what will happen to cloudflare too
"Okay Guidance is down so what? This is just pure panic and overreaction. They are adding new customers, fix issues. This stock will be 200 in a year time."
wish I could buy aftermarket:(
Haven’t looked in a while is FASTLY still $136?
"Rick Rieder, the Head of the Global Allocation Team at Blackrock, and one of the more influential voices on Wall St, was on the Halftime Report on Monday on CNBC. He's been buying some stocks today, but not a lot, waiting for a bottom. He said longer term, ""There is no doubt in my mind that equities are headed higher"", and ""There could be significant upside to US stocks."" Tech is one of the sectors that Rieder said that he likes, and FSLY is a stock that Blackrock likes. In the April-May-June quarter, they bought 440,000 shares, and they owned a total of 4.3m shares as of June 30. It wouldn't be a big surprise if Blackrock started buying more shares of FSLY in the near future."
"Like I said yesterday, FSLY is now in the low 30s."
Back to 1$ ?
"Well known tech investor Kevin Landis was on Closing Bell on CNBC on Thursday. He was asked how the various uncertainties that the stock market now faces - China/Evergrande, rising commodity prices, rising interest rates, a possible default on US government debt - could affect things. He said that if the market gets into trouble, there will be fewer and fewer good growth stories out there, and the scarcity of growth stories will make the ones that are there more valuable. At the Oppenheimer Investment Conference a couple of months ago, FSLY said that they expect 10 years of 30% growth in their business. There's not all that many businesses that have that kind of growth opportunity, so this could be the kind of story that investors like Landis are looking for."
"FSLY holders. Don't sell here. Wait to see where this settles. I bought more today. FSLY is in a uber-high-growth market, just not executing properly. Maybe time to show CEO the door"
"Honestly speaking, I have never ever made a bad decision like this one. I get caught when it was $ 100 per share with 300 shares, Since I am just stuck with it and its get worse and worse hopefully one day I will recover just half of my capital."
"Well, looks like I’ll be holding this one forever. Who needs money anyways? "
$42.27 buyers——————->
"Still way down from my cost basis but, I guess I feel a lot better than I might have felt..."
$FSLY WILL DOUBLE by year end. Load up before it's too late!!!
It was overpriced at $136 and it is overpriced now
Anyone bought stocks at 135$? Do you regret ???
"$30 stock price, then $25 will be new range"
Better to buy this one after the earnings if you don’t want to take risk. Stock is ok long term
The short interest is so big. Watch out for sudden drop to 20s. No earnings !
Who bought this @around 100 bucks? Don't think we'll ever see this amount anymore in the near future!
$20 is good entry
Fsly to 50$???
back to where it belongs
They had some interesting insights about FSLY on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"So much for $43. I got assigned on 10x puts, so down $950+. Should I just unload it at open tomorrow, or is there any chance this could rise some to recoup some of it?"
Whats wrong with fsly ?
"Due to the outage, delays in projects from numerous customers, and one of the top 10 customers leaving the platform, Fastly updated its third-quarter and full-year guidance. Unfortunately, the updated guidance did not meet expectations, and the numerous yellow flags discussed during earnings have caused some analysts to downgrade Fastly."
"Maybe today selloff is, in part, because of Facebook outage... But I think that Facebook used akamai in the past and now uses its own cdn, correct me if I'm wrong. I take it as an opportunity to double my position, I'm confident that in a few weeks collaboration with Apple will be revealed, and with Amazon back on board we will see a good ER"
over 40 end of day? Thoughts?
still way down from my cost
over sold alert
Form is temporary....but Class is Permanent.
"Anthony Saglimbene, the Global Market Strategist at Ameriprise, was on Bloomberg - The Close on Monday. Saglimbene is bullish and, in contrast to some other strategists that are recommending defensive, high dividend stocks, he especially likes companies that are showing strong growth. In the April-May-June quarter, Ameriprise bought 5,000 shares of FSLY, and ended the quarter owning 30,000, a small position for an investor of their size. There have been days recently when it's been obvious that institutional investors have been buying FSLY. If Ameriprise likes growth stocks, they may be among the investors that have been buying FSLY lately and building up a larger position."
I think this is becoming a very interesting buy out opportunity in the next quarter or two.
Crashing fastly!   
"Barely $4b market cap anyone remember $20b market cap? I do, I shorted"
"Give me a faster more secure internet any day, Go Fastly!!"
"Sherry Paul, a portfolio manager with Morgan Stanley, was on Bloomberg - The Close on Tuesday. She believes we're in a secular bull market. One theme she likes right now is the ""digitization of everything"", a theme that plays right into what FSLY is doing on the Internet.Morgan Stanley is FSLY's largest shareholder. In the April-May-June quarter they bought 400,000 shares, and they ended the quarter owning 13.5m shares. Obviously MS really likes this stock. I think that portfolio managers at MS that want to play the theme of the ""digitization of everything"" are most likely continuing to buy FSLY."
Fastly is up 8.67% to 44.81
Going out on a limb here...Amazon should/could/may/may not buy Fastly!
I don’t own any stock but I think it’s time to start nibbling on this at this price point.Going to buy some shares tomorrow or Friday.
Whatever Cramer says u do the opposite
"In terms of valuation buying their business for 4bln is just cheap with all the technology and network they have.In terms of execution its not good but despite the outage the impact is not that heavy given the nature of the business...They are still kind of a unicorn business but last few quarters went just wrong... they were heavily impacted by TikTok departure... if that didnt happen theyd be valued at 12-15b atleast.Dont know what to think here honestly... great potential, extremely cheap but one more situation like this and it will take a year to remedy that."
is it good entry point or wait for ER?
Too over bought
So far this company has been my worst investment. But I’m still optimistic.
100$ soon
What say you board?
Today 45$
"Olivia Engel, a strategist with State Street, was on Bloomberg Markets on Monday morning. Right now she likes companies with strong balance sheets, where management has a long term plan for the business.In last month's earnings conference call Fastly said, ""We will continue to invest in our network in a disciplined manner, keeping long-term profitability in mind. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with 1.1 billion in cash, restricted cash, and investments. We remain well capitalized to invest in the future growth of Fastly.""In the April-May-June quarter, State Street bought 379,000 shares of Fastly, and ended the quarter owning a total of 1.4m shares. I think Fastly is the kind of stock State Street is looking for right now, and I think they will continue to buy."
But but Cramer was promoting this on his show.......................
Good thing Cramer said that it was too early to buy this stock when it was at $35 this morning. He's got really helpful investment advice! LOL
FSLY goes from $136 to $33 and people are cheering $41 LOL 
$FSLY is a $100 stock. I don't care about all the blah blah blah cuz ya'll shorts can #$%$ as far as I'm concerned. I'm in it for the long haul. Ain't nobody gonna change my mind.
"I am holding 1,200 shares of FSLY at $61. This is not looking good. Not sure if there is a future for this company."
"i bought 5000 shares at the Dip 35 a Couple of Days Ago, I Make A lot of Money Right Now, Should Sell now and Lock-in Profit ? Any Advice ?"
"This was a $19 stock before the pandemic. Now, im not saying it still is, but with the rise of it's income, its losses has jumped or doubled. Huge losses. I just don't see a catalyst for this right now, income will probably drop and more people head back to the office. Last month was a big month for many returning employees like us."
Party is over for the Shorts.
A takeover target?
sold 500 share AH with $7000 loss. I held it too long believing it will recover and it did not! I feel so devastated today.
Isn't FASTLY too EXPENSIVE to enter at this price ??? Appreciate your view !!
"Cramer says don’t buy this stock,it’s going lower...the street says it might be a goner. Some of Fastly’s customers are leaving."
"On the other hand, if Fastly was a legitimate play they would have been taken out by a bigger player by now. I'm changing my guess to total collapse."
Good price to get in.
"I gotta tell you. Right now , I couldn't be happier with the way it's currently trading."
I've lost a lot of money on this one too.. :-( after initially seeing great gains.. Wondering whether or not to sell and cut losses or sell half .. or hold .. thoughts?
added at 35.75
Is it a win if sometime we are only down 10% after a earnings report? NET is suppose to be a inferior product to FSLY but a better management team. YTD they are up 50% and we are down 50%. Does that say anything at all?
What ever happened to the 850 million the company raised with the no interest $110 warrents? Any of it left??
..only 25% of avg daily volumegood volume is a good indicator.
"back to ipo price, that's a joke"
Anyone listen to me and buy weekly put options into earnings if anyone knows how to read an options chart & listened to me they just made mucho dinero
So at 15$ is it a good buy ?
Volume looking good today! Can only go up!
Fsly to 50$:)))
Why the jump today? Any major news?
Bad deal at $135.Great deal at $35.
FSLY is going to the moon & rebound baby 
Thoughts about this stock?
best to BUY strength !! buying weakness is much harder
What makes you think this is not a falling knife?
Hope this stays down until Friday want to double up what I hold under $40 then set back and wait 2/3years...while looking for more deals...It's a great hobby that pays.
50 soon
going 200$
FSLY needs to buyback stocks... look at the mega caps.... pretty easy way to float SP
"Question, how is fastly now below their pre pandemic price? I get EPS has gone down but it’s cause of spending? What am I missing here?"
"Fastly will announce its second-quarter results after market close today. It's generally extremely difficult to guess how a market will react to a company's earnings report. Investors may want to tune into the company's results when they go live after the bell to check on how well Fastly's business is performing.I am really glad that I found https://tradepicker.today/7crp9t It will help you put various potential stocks under your watchlist, ensuring that you invest on them before they boom."
Who elese loaded up premarket -22%
"Disappointed with the way Joshua handle the conference call, especially, in answering on few analysts questions on the need to clearly quantify the impact of the outage. To calm the investors, he can easily clarify whether we are seeing one time issue of outage or actually we are seeing systemic loss of market share due to competition. What he need to do is add a row label as loss from outrage. As investors, we can add the loss from the outage, and judge ourselves whether the future growth story is intact. Joshua and the outgoing CFO is inexperienced in handling crisis!"
"fsly,has a negative earnings per share of 1.50,akami a positive of 3.50 and viac a positive of $5 . What's a better buy"
I'm assuming we're all pretty impressed with this come back
Any news?Fsly is on trending today
FSLY heading to below $30 later.
Why didn’t they pre- announce all of the problems the power outage caused. I smell law suits brewing in the nit to distant future.
sell ratings are Low 30s.. which means high $20s.. take the pump money and run
"Can’t emphasize the importance of hedging. The outage was a black swan event which I don’t think anyone predicted. The drop is huge so expect lawsuits. Still, this is the first time it’s looked like an attractive buy in over a year. At the very least, any serious trader will take a bull position going into next week to make some lunch money. After that, it’s up in the air since this has always been a directional trade."
https://finance.yahoo.com/m/b09a9e82-baa4-34b5-85eb-7b50ed5c96d6/why-fastly-s-stock-is-gaining.html
"Alli McCartney, a Managing Director at UBS Wealth Management, was on Closing Bell on CNBC on Monday. Q3 earnings will start to be reported by companies later this week. McCartney said that she is expecting a strong earnings season, and therefore she believes that recent declines in stock prices represent a buying opportunity.In the April-May-June quarter, UBS increased its position in FSLY by 83% with a buy of 168,000 shares. After the big decline in the stock price from well over $100, I think a lot of investors see FSLY as attractively priced at current levels."
What's a target for tomorrow? $30 or $25
Short every pop from here on out.
conntrary to all the expert market analysis (noise) this stock will bounce back in a week as it is over sold. I see this settling at 40 to 45 till next earning and for long term it remains a growth stock to buy abd hold!
Posted by a VC on Twitter:You really can’t make this stuff up:Got a call from a Fastly exec today who was trying to resign but their boss had just resigned so they didn’t know who to tell that they’re resigning.As the saying goes- the impact of bad culture and leadership are felt gradually then Fastlyhttps://twitter.com/bryce/status/1443376158695899140?s=21
When will the CEO get fired? Time for a new one.
There is not one analyst that does not rate FSLY a Strong Sell. How can they all be wrong?
"His name is Joshua Bixby and he sold $30,000,000 in stock this year as FSLY CEO."
Dropping Fastly
"Kristina Hooper, Invesco's Chief Global Market Strategist, was on Bloomberg - The Close on Monday. She stated that she's positive that the market will end the year higher than it did today.As of June 30, Invesco owned 86,000 shares of FSLY, after adding a few thousand shares during the second quarter. Invesco is a long term investor, so it wouldn't be a surprise if they took advantage of the current low stock price to add to their position."
"OK, FSLY had a bad week- it failed to match expectations. But stand back and look at the COMPANY, yes the good stuff outweighs the bad, That's why I bought another 25% and have a $60 target by Christmas."
"Will probably re-trace back down now and close around $37/38 from my technical analysis, but I had a great day trading this"
someone with a lot more money than me seems to want it
Just like TWLO in its younger days....I just wish I still had my TWLO shares I bought just four years ago...
Anyone know why jump up
"When this runs 50% like it has in the past, expect tears from all those hedge fund managers."
I own a few garbage stocks. But I think this one wins the prize for the biggest garbage in my portfolio
what happened to fastly ? isn't it a compare cyber security company to crowdstrike and cloudflare ?
I knew I should bought Slowly instead......:)
Can we please have decent earnings this quarter?
"Wow, if it opens this way tomorrow, FSLY will be down almost 90% off its 52 week high.........YIKES !!!!I was thinking of starting a position this week, being down almost 70% from the top, but glad I didn't. I have to look into it further, but almost 90% of its high makes it a Meme Stock Candidate, right ?"
Good level ($35) to start accumulating. Long term vision intact.
"A lot of panic selling.. CEO must take the hit.. But boy I'm just seeing opportunity totally overly sold.. Market just typically will slam dunk u. Can't see CEO staying.. Will buy over the next month. Fastly will bounce back I've no doubt. Im loving the SP price, imo its a buy. Gl yall. ."
"Interesting, yesterday volume is more than 50M shares transacted, 54% is shortie, yet price able to climb up. Todate Short interest shares is at 19.68M shares, if buyer continue able to outdo the shortie, we will have squeezed position, that will be really good, as Price will up very fast!"
4Qtrs of misses and now we forcast missing the full year along with losing customers. Well a couple more quarters and we will be at zero! Should've bought as meme stock.
"Oversold now. Imagine the price was $20 level before Fastly business boomed and it price surged to >$100!!Just with a one time outage event, with lower quarterly revenue, price dropped to $40! Fastly has invested a lot to build strong the business model with superior signal tech, this is underplayed. Do also trace the trend for past earnings of Fastly, repeatedly happened.. earning missed, huge plunged, and shoot back right after. Just a cycle for this counter.. Definitely good entry price since it get stabilised post earning last night. Won’t strike the bottom, but for 10-20% gain from price entry of $40 range, it’s brainless decision to make.Short term target price is $55-$60, with any development of it buy-out plan, $70 level is achievable."
"This quarter, we generated 85 million in revenue, net of the 1.2 million deferred revenue write-down associated with the acquisition of Signal Sciences, representing 14% year-over-year growth. While acknowledging the tough year-over-year comparison to Q2 2020, we are pleased with the ongoing demand and long-term growth potential of the platform. Turning to gross margin. Our GAAP gross margin was 52.6% for the quarter, compared to 60.2% in the same quarter a year agoThey beat revenue despite acquisitions and issues. What all this nonsense trash talk bears ?"
down -47% brutal waiting to break even and I'm out.
"It’s gonna to be a V-shaped rebound tonight. The share price has started to price in the outage and missed earning since Jun, all to wait until the earning date and see the impact. While the result isn’t good, pple are panic selling and it’s oversold which Mkt will adjust back to right level. Institutional investors and those who bought high the past will enter to average their share price too."
"Chill people, this is a scare tactic. This stock will be fine."
I heard about FSLY the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"Barclays is out with a note today saying any dips in the market should be bought. As of June 30, Barclays owned close to 200,000 shares of FSLY. Now that FSLY has mostly recovered from their network outage, institutional investors are starting to come back into the stock and buy any dip that takes the share price close to $40."
Funny fact. When FSLY was trading at 60 P/S(price to sales) and NET at 15 P/S analysts recommended FSLY over NET. Now that FSLY is at 15 P/S and NET at 60 P/S they recommend NET over FSLY.
"I have to buy under $40.00 with some apprehension about the near term. If the market gets better, FSLY goes up. Otherwise, it could drop quite a bit."
i told you so ... back to 50 in 2 weeks time
"So they made their numbers for the quarter. If they had missed, they would have pre-announced in today's press release which gives the date for the release of the financial results.Fastly will release financial results for the third quarter of 2021 after market close on Wednesday, November 3, 2021."
Checkout the institutional holders holding 67% of the shares.There are 461 institutional holders!
Going back to $33 soon! Anyone want to bet me? There is absolutely no reason to be long this stock ever again after today. CEO sold $30m shares!
Maybe CISCO is on the prowl again. Does everyone know that Fastly can make the internet faster? AND more secure of course..
amazon back to the network
FLSY always recovers well when oversold. Hopefully earnings and outlook is better this time around.
Bought at 36.33
It will go a bit high today to attract buyer then drop like no tomorrow by end of the day. Fishing.
"Compared the numbers between net and fsly. In the last 2 years, both had around 50% increase in overall revenue, but the increase in losses was only 15% for net but 90% for fsly. Looks to me that fsly is still showing that typical large loss scenario for growth companies, while net is coming out of that cycle. I think at some point, fsly will do that same and the stock price will rebound. Big issue is when will that begin to show up -- lower losses for fsly?"
I am finally in control of my finances and ready to invest! FSLY to the moon! Red!
"During the second quarter, we also managed through a significant outage that impacted our Q2 results and will have an impact on our Q3 and full year outlook. We have a couple of customers, one of them being a top 10 customer, that have yet to return their traffic to the platform. We also had several customers delay the launch of certain projects, which delayed the timing of traffic coming onto our platform.”"
"A pickup in price and volume today in the last 15 minutes of trading, the time when institutions are most active in the market. Institutional investors see anything below 40 as very attractive in this stock. We don't know what institutions are holding this stock now, but as of June 30, Morgan Stanley held 13m shares, Vanguard held 8m, and Blackrock held 4m. This stock has been an institutional favorite before and will be again."
"It got hammered down after the last ER, although it only missed by a little.Not feeling good about tomorrow's ER :("
"Important: DA Davidson analyst Rishi Jaluria downgraded Fastly to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $33, down from $60. The analyst cites the company's Q2 revenue miss and reduced FY21 guidance as June outages resulted in a top-10 customer and several others pulling all traffic from its network, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Jaluria further cites the management's commentary that there have been delays in those same new customer ramps this quarter, unrelated to the June outage."
"250,000 shares of volume in the first 5 minutes of trading. Definitely institutional investors buying."
"So FSLY will triple over 5 year period as per Motley Fool? Appreciate feedback, should I buy Apple or FSLY?"

"Yesterday was a holiday (for the bond market) so a lot of the Wall St. strategists are out with notes today. Tom Lee, one of the most widely followed strategists on the Street, is saying that his base case continues to be that stocks will rally into year end. Marko Kolanovic at JP Morgan, who is also widely followed, believes Covid/Delta has peaked, and that investors should maintain a pro-risk allocation. And UBS is saying that the ""Equity Rally Has Further To Run"". My view is that we're going to get a positive report from FSLY on Nov 3, and that investors should be buying the stock ahead of the report. As of June 30, UBS owned 371,000 shares of FSLY, and JP Morgan owned 178,000. I think we'll see significant buying by these and other institutional investors once FSLY reports their quarter."
"I wish I had the guts to say hat I doubled-down at $34.00 today but, I didn't."
"FSLY stock is broken at the moment but the company is fine, it sure does have some issues to resolve and nothing tells us that the problems are not fixable. For the patient investor, this beaten down stock could be a big winner in 6 months."
"Gap down was closed at 2:00pm ET, then trending down again. Very clear downtrend from here."
Not a buy. Check short interest. It's going up. Be safe ! 20 be good entry !
I think now could be the time to start a position in $FSLY with a share price trading at $37 it is now at 52 low the company has so much potential just look at the 52 week highs! Could be an easy 2-3X within the 2-3 years
Finally! the market is making sense!
I just yolo bought 100 shares at 44.32. all I know about this company is people use the internet right? :)
"Gargi Chaudhuri, a strategist with Blackrock, was on Bloomberg Markets/Americas on Wednesday. There's been a lot of talk on Wall St about whether higher interest rates have been driving down the price of tech stocks. Chaudhuri said she thought that there could be more volatility for the next 2-3 weeks, but that longer term a 10 year Treasury rate in the 1.7 - 2.0 range wouldn't stop tech stocks from rallying. FSLY is a stock that Blackrock likes. In the 2nd quarter, they bought 441,000 shares, and they owned a total of 4.3m shares as of June 30. We saw some institutional buying in FSLY late Wednesday, with price and volume both moving higher into the close. Who knows, maybe Blackrock is once again adding to their position."

"I believe a base is forming. I haven't purchased yet.......but think once I begin to see some large block buys I will jump in. IMO FSLY has potential to see $55+ Am also looking at BILI as a possible buy. Currently holding NVDA, SQ, OKTA, and SHOP."
Some of y’all talk about this company likes is mature. This is a young company with tremendous growth potential. Growing pains are inevitable.
"AJ Oden, Head of Investment Risk at BNY Mellon Investor Solutions, was on the Closing Bell on CNBC on Monday. He said he wouldn't be surprised to see small cap stocks (the Russell 2000) outperform for the rest of the year. As of June 30, BNY Mellon Investor Solutions owned around 600,000 shares of FSLY, including 23,000 shares purchased in the April-May-June quarter. I'm seeing institutional investors coming into FSLY. With its $5b market cap, FSLY is a small cap stock, so BNY Mellon may have been among those buying today."

"SYDNEY - 22 SEPTEMBER, 2021 -- Fastly, Inc. (NYSE: FSLY), a global edge cloud platform provider, today announced that Melbourne-based linking platform, Linktree, has deployed Fastly's edge cloud platform and next-gen cloud-based web application firewall (Cloud WAF) to support its 16 million global users, making their online content easier to find, safer to manage, and likelier to convert on social media platforms and eCommerce stores.Linktree decided to leverage Fastly's edge cloud platform to enable the organisation's developers by facilitating more team members to use the infrastructure simultaneously, saving time and streamlining the DevOps lifecycle. With a dedicated CI/CD pipeline for deploying changes to Fastly, access to the Fastly UI can now be restricted, and developers can make changes easily via pull request.In addition, Linktree has worked with Fastly to improve its security posture and scale seamlessly at a time when the organisation faced a three-month sign-up spike during which millions of new users created an evergreen link to their online content.Fastly's Cloud WAF deployment option offered a dev-friendly environment, including the accessibility to work at the edge and use Typescript code at the application layer.""Although we had rules set up in our [previous] WAF, it was case by case rather than a holistic solution,"" says Paul Oram, Engineer Manager, Linktree. ""We wanted it to cover the whole edge and integrate with our content delivery network. Indeed, there was a time when I was in the console all day every day, looking at attack surfaces and putting in rules to either block or rate limit them.""Early on in their engagement with Fastly, Linktree noticed a bad actor that had written a Python script to create multiple fake accounts daily. Leveraging Fastly's Cloud WAF, Linktree's team was able to create new rules within two minutes to block the bot. Fake accounts were shut down instantly.Hot on the heels of the Fastly edge cloud platform and Cloud WAF deployment has been a performance boost. Uptime increased from 96 percent to 99.999 percent, putting the platform in a much better position to prepare for the unexpected.""Selena Gomez might join the platform, then [Metallica], and that sets off a cascade of new users that you just can't predict. Having Fastly scale underneath us has been super beneficial,"" says Bradley Shawyer, Head of Engineering at Linktree.During 2021, Linktree has seen steady growth with changing consumer behaviours, including more time spent on social media and online shopping. In the first three months of 2021, that growth spiked to add 4 million new users, with sign-ups peaking at around 43,000 per day.Fastly has been a strategic upgrade for the Linktree developer and technical teams to meet evolving consumer and market conditions.""It just works the way it should in a DevOps environment and is straightforward to empower infrastructure-as-code. Programmability and being able to work with Fastly in code has been powerful for Linktree. At the same time, Fastly has enabled Linktree to benefit beyond the engineering team - we supported the customer success team to lighten their load. The integrated product is working well for us. It's handled everything we need it to,"" says Oram.Next on the team's agenda are ongoing security improvements, exploring Fastly's Image Optimizer, and moving Linktree's monolith application to serverless microservices architecture. Fastly helps people stay better connected with the things they love. Fastly's edge cloud platform enables customers to create great digital experiences quickly, securely, and reliably by processing, serving, and securing our customers' applications as close to their end-users as possible - at the edge of the internet. Fastly's platform is designed to take advantage of the modern internet, to be programmable, and to support agile software development with unmatched visibility and minimal latency, empowering developers to innovate with both performance and security. Fastly's customers include many of the world's most prominent companies, including Pinterest, The New York Times, and GitHub."

"David Lebovitz, JP Morgan's Global Market Strategist, was on Bloomberg-The Close on Friday. He said that volatility could continue in the stock market for a few more weeks, but ""We remain very constructive on the outlook as we look ahead to 2022.""As of June 30, JP Morgan owned around 120,000 shares of FSLY. My view is that we are going to get some good news from FSLY when they report their quarterly results on Nov 3, and JP Morgan and other institutional investors will come in and buy after that."
3rd quarter earnings expectations?
"Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, was on Squawk Box on CNBC on Wednesday. He noted that the stock market lately has been trading up and down, but he said that he's bullish longer term and that he's eventually expecting to see a series of higher highs in the market. A large block shares traded on Wednesday just before 2pm, looked like an institutional investor coming in and buying. Blackrock is one of FSLY's largest shareholders. As of June 30, they owned 4.2m shares, including 441,000 that they bought during April-May-June. Who knows, maybe they added more shares today."
Today expected to drop below $33. Closing might end up at $32.60
