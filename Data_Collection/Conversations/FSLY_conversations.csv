"head up to $60+ zone, FSLY!"
One of the most important internet companies of the world...sitting at a 6b market cap. Patience is key and no doubt longs will be rewarded.
Finally! the market is making sense!
"New short interest data is just out for Aug 13. Compared to July 30, FSLY short interest dropped by about 13% to 18.8m. Apparently there was a lot of short covering when the stock traded 50m shares on Aug 5. But as of Aug 13, there was still 18.8m shares sold short, so additional short covering could give the stock a boost for a while and help offset tax loss selling."
5 year price target $550.Revenues are actually up.lolCheckout the list of clients.HUGE!
Do you remember when Cramer said to BUY BUY BUY FSLY @100. He would never admit it.
Cybersecurity breakthrough within days of NASDAQ listing and $10 million cash from MAXIM. Price ready to pop really big! Comps suggest $4.00 to $50. https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/21922151-bioresearch-alert/5630521-microsoft-investment-in-4b-rubrik-cybersecurity-highlights-undiscovered-4m-data443-extremely
"Interesting, yesterday volume is more than 50M shares transacted, 54% is shortie, yet price able to climb up. Todate Short interest shares is at 19.68M shares, if buyer continue able to outdo the shortie, we will have squeezed position, that will be really good, as Price will up very fast!"
"This quarter, we generated 85 million in revenue, net of the 1.2 million deferred revenue write-down associated with the acquisition of Signal Sciences, representing 14% year-over-year growth. While acknowledging the tough year-over-year comparison to Q2 2020, we are pleased with the ongoing demand and long-term growth potential of the platform. Turning to gross margin. Our GAAP gross margin was 52.6% for the quarter, compared to 60.2% in the same quarter a year agoThey beat revenue despite acquisitions and issues. What all this nonsense trash talk bears ?"
it's so cheap for 37 dollars
Another ARK funds that plunged today.
"Stocks down big today are $lmnd, $etsy, $uber, $fsly, $gm, $roku, $lyft, $sklz. I own none of these. Feel better lcid is not down that much. Lcid will bleed slowly."
amazon back to the network
$fsly is still on top of list of cml pro. Cml pro recommended nvda years ago. Fsly is currently sitting on the top of the list. fsly will rocket soon. Patience is virtue. Fsly shaking weak hands
conntrary to all the expert market analysis (noise) this stock will bounce back in a week as it is over sold. I see this settling at 40 to 45 till next earning and for long term it remains a growth stock to buy abd hold!
"Glad that I averaged down last week. Even if fsly is not profitable in any way yet, I strongly believe in this business."
Trap.. fair value $25
It’s been a painful year for this stock. My sense is the worst is over. Huge market for their services. It’s oversold and I’ve added to my position.
$FSLY WILL DOUBLE by year end. Load up before it's too late!!!
I too am down on my Fastly holding but I just feel it would be foolish to sell something with so much potential. As Warren Buffet said the market transfers money from the impatient to the patient. At this level I'm going to top up my holding before the figures next week
"During the second quarter, we also managed through a significant outage that impacted our Q2 results and will have an impact on our Q3 and full year outlook. We have a couple of customers, one of them being a top 10 customer, that have yet to return their traffic to the platform. We also had several customers delay the launch of certain projects, which delayed the timing of traffic coming onto our platform.”"
Is it a win if sometime we are only down 10% after a earnings report? NET is suppose to be a inferior product to FSLY but a better management team. YTD they are up 50% and we are down 50%. Does that say anything at all?
"Anthony Saglimbene, the Global Market Strategist at Ameriprise, was on Bloomberg - The Close on Monday. Saglimbene is bullish and, in contrast to some other strategists that are recommending defensive, high dividend stocks, he especially likes companies that are showing strong growth. In the April-May-June quarter, Ameriprise bought 5,000 shares of FSLY, and ended the quarter owning 30,000, a small position for an investor of their size. There have been days recently when it's been obvious that institutional investors have been buying FSLY. If Ameriprise likes growth stocks, they may be among the investors that have been buying FSLY lately and building up a larger position."
Party is over for the Shorts.
"The stock market trading is like sailing a ship on a rough sea and if you ain't got an experienced captain at the deck, your ship is sure to crash!!! Likewise, trading, the importance of a mentor is never overlooked, cos no matter how good the strategy is, you might get confused at a point and that's where the expertise comes on and if not properly guided. It will result in a whole lot of losses. That's why it's pertinent to have a very good trader to guide you.

Made some quick cash on this #$%$.. just sold it all
Let’s go fsly!!!!!!! Time to fly
"Oversold now. Imagine the price was $20 level before Fastly business boomed and it price surged to >$100!!Just with a one time outage event, with lower quarterly revenue, price dropped to $40! Fastly has invested a lot to build strong the business model with superior signal tech, this is underplayed. Do also trace the trend for past earnings of Fastly, repeatedly happened.. earning missed, huge plunged, and shoot back right after. Just a cycle for this counter.. Definitely good entry price since it get stabilised post earning last night. Won’t strike the bottom, but for 10-20% gain from price entry of $40 range, it’s brainless decision to make.Short term target price is $55-$60, with any development of it buy-out plan, $70 level is achievable."
"Fastly price drop less than $35, will be the candidate for take over, as the market Cap just around $4B. Fastly has 145T network capability, Computer@edge as well as recent Signal Science acquisition capability, Fastly should be value at higher value than Cloudera acquisition, which KKR pay $5.115B"
Fastly rising today. Enjoy
"Something fishy, there are now more than 3M shares available for shorts, only asking rate of 0.49%. We only transacted 1.5M volume out of 105M outstanding shares!"
The massive insider selling was a tip off........................................
This is going to 60+
Is this a buy now?
"It got hammered down after the last ER, although it only missed by a little.Not feeling good about tomorrow's ER :("

Massive buying here. Volume of 1.5m shares traded between 9:30am and 9:50. Buyers are stampeding in.
Fsly to 50$???
"People who make the $FSLY and $NET comparison time and time again fail to understand that these are two fundamentally different companies; starting with products, the revenue models, and all the way up to leadership (Prince and Zatlyn!). Cloudflare is going to fundamentally become a part of internet infrastructure while Fastly is just a CDN. I feel extremely confident holding $NET for the next 10 years and will buy any dip."
Too over bought
Funny fact. When FSLY was trading at 60 P/S(price to sales) and NET at 15 P/S analysts recommended FSLY over NET. Now that FSLY is at 15 P/S and NET at 60 P/S they recommend NET over FSLY.
As promised I added 401 shares in my cash brokerage account. No stop loss this is a patient well thought out investment.
"Companies used to have the courtesy of warning investors ahead of earnings if the earnings were going to be bad. They don't seem to do that, anymore."
#$%$'re right...been trending downward for some time...
Fair value…meh not even $12.
I've lost a lot of money on this one too.. :-( after initially seeing great gains.. Wondering whether or not to sell and cut losses or sell half .. or hold .. thoughts?
even Cathie wood sold this #$%$ in May
sell ratings are Low 30s.. which means high $20s.. take the pump money and run
Amazon returns to the fold...VALIDATION...
Double B.
i told you so ... back to 50 in 2 weeks time
Form is temporary....but Class is Permanent.
Imagine working for this company walking into work because you can’t afford a car in Silicon Valley while Ferrari’s & Lamborghini’s whiz by you going to their jobs!
Maybe CISCO is on the prowl again. Does everyone know that Fastly can make the internet faster? AND more secure of course..
Where did all the people go that called out they were shorting in the $30s?
I am curios. The analysts are mark this down this morning like anything and drop their target prices down to $33 level and this happens? Who is buying it.
I see $20 on this.
I think old trick again. Rise a bit to attract buyer then drop after then.
over 40 end of day? Thoughts?
Anyone bought stocks at 135$? Do you regret ???
It was overpriced at $136 and it is overpriced now
Buyout target!
Amazon back to n/w now it’s time for TikTok.
All I can say is what I said at the last earnings report… this is dropping fastly!
so far so good on those 34s
Over done my opinion only
I think this is becoming a very interesting buy out opportunity in the next quarter or two.
Back to $16. This is sad
I would not touch this until Monday or Tuesday!
"Maybe, the Reddit crowd is saving us. If so, I like them a lot more than I did before."
4Qtrs of misses and now we forcast missing the full year along with losing customers. Well a couple more quarters and we will be at zero! Should've bought as meme stock.
"I bought in today $44.1 Average cost, 3k shares.Sold previously 0n 10/8/20 with a gain of $71.2k. I am optimistic that FSLY will fly again soon, maybe after today's earnings."
I'm not feeling any thing good about earnings either.
"Yes. There are issues. But, the revenues were higher yoy and earnings a tad better than estimates.What really hurt was guidance. I figure this price is close to the bottom. And, we could get a bounce when the shorts close their positions and move on.The technology still seems promising but, the CEO sounds lost."
is it pump and dump or legit move?
thank you god for telling me to sell at 54.....thank you thank you thank you
Back to 1$ ?
100$ soon
"Maybe, Joshua is smarter than I thought last night."
"Don’t feel so bad. I am here to cheer you up. Look at $fsly, $etsy, $uber down big afterhours. Thought it would make you feel better."
going 200$
"$1,000 PT for 5 years."
"FSLY was trading in the 30s all last week, doing a bit better today. I think the stock can move up into the mid-40's over the next several months. Keep in mind there will be tax loss selling. By December/January a lot of the tax loss sellers will be buying back in, new money will also be coming in, and the stock should go."
"On the other hand, if Fastly was a legitimate play they would have been taken out by a bigger player by now. I'm changing my guess to total collapse."
Anybody has any idea if FSLY going to bring back its huge revenue generator Tiktok to its platform. I believe sooner or later it will come back and will make a huge leg up.I am a long holder.
One juicy press release and Fastly will be back over $100.
"I gotta tell you. Right now , I couldn't be happier with the way it's currently trading."
Morgan Stanley owns 800 million dollars worth and Vanguard owns 600 million dollars worth.Today was just the #$%$ hedgefunds manipulating on earnings report like they do on every stock every quarterly report. Lmao BUYBUYBUY!
Fsly to 50?
Will buy after hours at $35
Ouch after hr
This simply has to be shorts closing out their positions.
FSLY is going to the moon & rebound baby 
Fastly is up 8.67% to 44.81

"OK, FSLY had a bad week- it failed to match expectations. But stand back and look at the COMPANY, yes the good stuff outweighs the bad, That's why I bought another 25% and have a $60 target by Christmas."
This is a 10 dollar stock if there is a downturn in the market
1... 2 ..... 3 .... start now ...buying more
Dropping Fastly
"i new here , i did mu DD ...six month ago the share price was 110 down to 33 due to a COVID AND SOLD BY INSIDERS... with no time this will be 50 dollars"
What's a target for tomorrow? $30 or $25
"Cramer says don’t buy this stock,it’s going lower...the street says it might be a goner. Some of Fastly’s customers are leaving."
Why the jump today? Any major news?
When you average down.. it keep going down. This time was different!!
Holy Moses
Hopefully something would happen on the earnings day. I’m quite tired of this company some my long position has disappointed me quarter after quarter.
"Olivia Engel, a strategist with State Street, was on Bloomberg Markets on Monday morning. Right now she likes companies with strong balance sheets, where management has a long term plan for the business.In last month's earnings conference call Fastly said, ""We will continue to invest in our network in a disciplined manner, keeping long-term profitability in mind. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with 1.1 billion in cash, restricted cash, and investments. We remain well capitalized to invest in the future growth of Fastly.""In the April-May-June quarter, State Street bought 379,000 shares of Fastly, and ended the quarter owning a total of 1.4m shares. I think Fastly is the kind of stock State Street is looking for right now, and I think they will continue to buy."
Good price to get in.
FSLY needs to buyback stocks... look at the mega caps.... pretty easy way to float SP
Tarot card says the same
I trashed this stock and bailed at $50 and predicted a $20 stock and ya’ll said I was crazy. Well watch the bottom fall totally out tomorrow. This place is done. They need to find a buyer or it’s lights out!
What say you board?
Should have named the company something else cuz its always either going up fastly or going down fastly
"I have learned over the years that when alot of losers scream sell at the same time, you buy. Bought before earnings, let's see what happens short dycs."
"Okay Guidance is down so what? This is just pure panic and overreaction. They are adding new customers, fix issues. This stock will be 200 in a year time."
"I bought FSLY just now at premarket, and keep buying now, and will buy more when market open, buy asap and hold !"
Where are the earnings ?
$FSLY is a $100 stock. I don't care about all the blah blah blah cuz ya'll shorts can #$%$ as far as I'm concerned. I'm in it for the long haul. Ain't nobody gonna change my mind.
What a run! What do you think is going to close at?
Fastly. Could be bought out with this cheap value
"Over 500,000 shares of volume in the first 15 minutes of trading. Definitely institutional investors buying."
"Like I said yesterday, FSLY is now in the low 30s."
"Another day, another drop. Not easy being a shareholder but patience is the key."
$Fastly the technology will take the sp to 100+
bought at 34.10 and average now at 57.5;0)
Better to buy this one after the earnings if you don’t want to take risk. Stock is ok long term
lol
"When this runs 50% like it has in the past, expect tears from all those hedge fund managers."
"Price is at $41.50 and the RSI is still only 30, meaning it's still oversold"
"His name is Joshua Bixby and he sold $30,000,000 in stock this year as FSLY CEO."
"I have to buy under $40.00 with some apprehension about the near term. If the market gets better, FSLY goes up. Otherwise, it could drop quite a bit."
"Disappointed with the way Joshua handle the conference call, especially, in answering on few analysts questions on the need to clearly quantify the impact of the outage. To calm the investors, he can easily clarify whether we are seeing one time issue of outage or actually we are seeing systemic loss of market share due to competition. What he need to do is add a row label as loss from outrage. As investors, we can add the loss from the outage, and judge ourselves whether the future growth story is intact. Joshua and the outgoing CFO is inexperienced in handling crisis!"
best to BUY strength !! buying weakness is much harder
"Afraid the fat lady has sung on this one. These young growing tech companies get one bite at the apple. This latest outage casts a huge doubt on their platform. Unless a Cisco or Intel steps in, this company will dissolve quickly. Investors hate the unknown and Fastly is no longer reliable."
Good thing Cramer said that it was too early to buy this stock when it was at $35 this morning. He's got really helpful investment advice! LOL
To the  today!?I am so happy to be with fsly.
Others have finally joined! Welcome. Hope you can stay for the ride
"It’s gonna to be a V-shaped rebound tonight. The share price has started to price in the outage and missed earning since Jun, all to wait until the earning date and see the impact. While the result isn’t good, pple are panic selling and it’s oversold which Mkt will adjust back to right level. Institutional investors and those who bought high the past will enter to average their share price too."
"get ready head up to $60, FSLY!"
"fsly chart update, fsly turning #$%$ at this time, the almost 20% shorts should start to cover soon."
"Barely $4b market cap anyone remember $20b market cap? I do, I shorted"
Oops. Shouldn’t have sold yesterday ah.
Wow glad i didnt buy at 120
"Shares of edge computing specialist Fastly (NYSE: FSLY) have cratered recently, falling more than 60% from highs earlier this year and a total of 54% year to date."
One of Cathie woods amazing stocks lol total trash. All her ETFs will ultimately collapse as they are nothing but hype
Will it be 10% down or Up today? What do you think ?
"250,000 shares of volume in the first 5 minutes of trading. Definitely institutional investors buying."
FSLY goes from $136 to $33 and people are cheering $41 LOL 
"Wow, if it opens this way tomorrow, FSLY will be down almost 90% off its 52 week high.........YIKES !!!!I was thinking of starting a position this week, being down almost 70% from the top, but glad I didn't. I have to look into it further, but almost 90% of its high makes it a Meme Stock Candidate, right ?"
Today 45$
This will be the turnaround story of the century. Cloud flare is 10 times market cap and is in the same business.
"No growth, unprofitable, fair price is $12"
"Alicia Levine, the market strategist at BNY Mellon, was on Bloomberg - The Close on Thursday. In the very short run she's got some concerns about the stock market - concerns about Covid/Delta and supply chain disruptions. But medium to longer term she remains positive and feels the market can move higher. She said we're now past the peak of economic growth and she now likes technology/growth stocks that can grow their earnings in a slower growing economy.As of June 30, BNY Mellon owned close to 600,000 shares of FSLY, and they added 23,000 shares in the April-May-June quarter. FSLY is a fast growing company, the kind of company that BNY Mellon is now looking for, so I would expect them to be buying an increasing number of shares in the current quarter and later quarters."
Bought at 36.33
So at 15$ is it a good buy ?
I will be interested in this at $10.
over sold alert
"Sherry Paul, a portfolio manager with Morgan Stanley, was on Bloomberg - The Close on Tuesday. She believes we're in a secular bull market. One theme she likes right now is the ""digitization of everything"", a theme that plays right into what FSLY is doing on the Internet.Morgan Stanley is FSLY's largest shareholder. In the April-May-June quarter they bought 400,000 shares, and they ended the quarter owning 13.5m shares. Obviously MS really likes this stock. I think that portfolio managers at MS that want to play the theme of the ""digitization of everything"" are most likely continuing to buy FSLY."
Going out on a limb here...Amazon should/could/may/may not buy Fastly!
Since June 28...every day sinking since then fallining knife!
Buy a little bit of AMC the short squeeze is starting right now
They had some interesting insights about FSLY on (http://Thetraderguide.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Honestly speaking, I have never ever made a bad decision like this one. I get caught when it was $ 100 per share with 300 shares, Since I am just stuck with it and its get worse and worse hopefully one day I will recover just half of my capital."
still way down from my cost
I'm assuming we're all pretty impressed with this come back
is it good entry point or wait for ER?
"FSLY stock is broken at the moment but the company is fine, it sure does have some issues to resolve and nothing tells us that the problems are not fixable. For the patient investor, this beaten down stock could be a big winner in 6 months."
They tanked one or two quarters ago but has since been hyped by cramer and other analysts....sorry for those who lost..
"Due to the outage, delays in projects from numerous customers, and one of the top 10 customers leaving the platform, Fastly updated its third-quarter and full-year guidance. Unfortunately, the updated guidance did not meet expectations, and the numerous yellow flags discussed during earnings have caused some analysts to downgrade Fastly."
bought big at $34...looking good
I wanna buy but I better control myself and wait. Too much negativity on this company right now. Maybe a better buy after next earning.
Price to book is 5! Don’t be bag holder!
"Can’t emphasize the importance of hedging. The outage was a black swan event which I don’t think anyone predicted. The drop is huge so expect lawsuits. Still, this is the first time it’s looked like an attractive buy in over a year. At the very least, any serious trader will take a bull position going into next week to make some lunch money. After that, it’s up in the air since this has always been a directional trade."
someone with a lot more money than me seems to want it
Time to short it
Who bought this @around 100 bucks? Don't think we'll ever see this amount anymore in the near future!
Double bottom. You can call this quarter: the kitchen sink.See ya at 80 EOY
Bad deal at $135.Great deal at $35.
What will be a good price to load this up?
"going back to $15, lol"
Impressive comeback today. A bit over-reacted sell-off this morning…
"FSLY surely needs a new management. I remember in last ER call after shares tumbled 20% in AH, there were at least 3 analysts questioning about the upward revision of the full year revenue guidance during the call. One analyst brought up a very logical question. What drives the upward revision of the full year revenue guidance when Q2 guidance is flat to Q1, and historically Q3 sequential growth was 7~8% in 2019 & 2020? So mathematically Q4 will need 30% sequential growth to meet the low end of their revised revenue guidance of full year 2021. The CFO said it is from the management confidence, and the results remain to be seen! #$%$A quarter later, the full year guidance is now revised down by more than 10%. What is the reputation of the management?"
Shorts are going to get burned.
Checkout the institutional holders holding 67% of the shares.There are 461 institutional holders!
Some rookie chaser bought at $140 and just sold at $40.
Why didn’t they pre- announce all of the problems the power outage caused. I smell law suits brewing in the nit to distant future.
$136 to $36 in the less than a year.
Going back to $33 soon! Anyone want to bet me? There is absolutely no reason to be long this stock ever again after today. CEO sold $30m shares!
Cramer just kicked the can.
"Chill people, this is a scare tactic. This stock will be fine."
down -47% brutal waiting to break even and I'm out.
wish I could buy aftermarket:(
"The last time Fsly cratered on earnings in May, it fully recovered 35 days later. I bought long here expecting another recovery. Fastly is trading at a price to sales of 12x. Compare that to Cloudflare, currently trading at a 76x multiple"
Haven’t looked in a while is FASTLY still $136?
I have 1000 shares @ $59.08. I belive in this company and have to (not by choice lol) to be a long with this one. If it rises I will buy more but at this point its enough to see ~60K converting into 48K. Hopefuly I will be rewarded for my patience.
waiting for 60+ hmmmmmm
It rallied 18% off of today's low. That's significant.
Shall the ceo return all his money?
I still say 150 comes before 20!!!
$20 is good entry
"i bought 5000 shares at the Dip 35 a Couple of Days Ago, I Make A lot of Money Right Now, Should Sell now and Lock-in Profit ? Any Advice ?"
Some of y’all talk about this company likes is mature. This is a young company with tremendous growth potential. Growing pains are inevitable.
"In terms of valuation buying their business for 4bln is just cheap with all the technology and network they have.In terms of execution its not good but despite the outage the impact is not that heavy given the nature of the business...They are still kind of a unicorn business but last few quarters went just wrong... they were heavily impacted by TikTok departure... if that didnt happen theyd be valued at 12-15b atleast.Dont know what to think here honestly... great potential, extremely cheap but one more situation like this and it will take a year to remedy that."
Crashing fastly!   
$23 to $24 range in the next few weeks
in last 5 years many Cybersec shares went up 10xIt has gone up only 2xSo if they put their act together - it can go 5x from here.
I heard about FSLY the other day on (http://Rightpicker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Added started position of 500 shares.
"plummeting down to $34.60, down 22.25%. LOL"
"A lot of panic selling.. CEO must take the hit.. But boy I'm just seeing opportunity totally overly sold.. Market just typically will slam dunk u. Can't see CEO staying.. Will buy over the next month. Fastly will bounce back I've no doubt. Im loving the SP price, imo its a buy. Gl yall. ."
the chart on fsly is telling us the panic selling the past months has ended. its a brand new game and the chart is saying higher prices are on the way.
"Yep. They will have plenty of spare kitty to spend on M&A , after a last minute decision not to acquire the UK based Morrisons supermarket. Parhaps the Morrisons withdrawal was done precisely so that they could target Fastly. Because, rest assured once Amazon makes a move, they all will : Cisco, Alphabet etc"
So this is heavily down only on a volume of 9.9M only. Not a big deal. Should bounce back quickly.
"Still way down from my cost basis but, I guess I feel a lot better than I might have felt..."
Nice
Anyone listen to me and buy weekly put options into earnings if anyone knows how to read an options chart & listened to me they just made mucho dinero
added at 35.75
What makes you think this is not a falling knife?
droping fastly
$UBER $Fsly BTFD doesn't work with these stocks...
Institutions have their eye on this stock at the current very attractive valuation. An institutional investor came in with a large buy order just before 2pmET Tuesday.
"A pickup in price and volume today in the last 15 minutes of trading, the time when institutions are most active in the market. Institutional investors see anything below 40 as very attractive in this stock. We don't know what institutions are holding this stock now, but as of June 30, Morgan Stanley held 13m shares, Vanguard held 8m, and Blackrock held 4m. This stock has been an institutional favorite before and will be again."
new lows...bring more new lows
Fastly shareholders still holding after going all in at $120 LOL
Whatever Cramer says u do the opposite
Just bought the huge 22% Fastly dip tonight for a Fast rebound back to $140-$280.
When will the CEO get fired? Time for a new one.
It's looking good for Cisco to take them over at these much lower levels.
"I wish I had the guts to say hat I doubled-down at $34.00 today but, I didn't."
The company should announce a stock buyback.
How gullible are people to think that earnings are kept secret until they are announced. It's commicle...
"Over 32,000 Websites Down After Critical Akamai DNS FailurePray FSLY escapes this type failure...now go pick up some new big clientsFSLY Sales Team. GLTA"

Exactly what will happen to cloudflare too
I don’t own any stock but I think it’s time to start nibbling on this at this price point.Going to buy some shares tomorrow or Friday.
"If you want content delivery company, by $LLNW it is at the bottom. $FSLY will be $5 stock 8n few quarters."

Who is buying here pre-market ?
Will another outage cause fsly go flat under 10$ or will it bounce back
"Since I invested in Fastly, I noticed that my internet is much faster and it just feels more secure.."
I don't see this can stay over $8-9.
GAP @$24. See you there
"New CFO, New board directors, conversion of class B into class A, FSLY takeover is imminent."
Amazon probably figured out fastly is best in class
"Over bought, like all stocks"
"Fastly will announce its second-quarter results after market close today. It's generally extremely difficult to guess how a market will react to a company's earnings report. Investors may want to tune into the company's results when they go live after the bell to check on how well Fastly's business is performing.I am really glad that I found https://tradepicker.today/7crp9t It will help you put various potential stocks under your watchlist, ensuring that you invest on them before they boom."

"And the management is making the market aware of this during earnings call, and not pre-announce bad news as it is required to??"
people selling this morning based on temporary problem caused by outage! Let’s give it a year & see where we at at is my take !
What ever happened to the 850 million the company raised with the no interest $110 warrents? Any of it left??
"Question, how is fastly now below their pre pandemic price? I get EPS has gone down but it’s cause of spending? What am I missing here?"
"Gap down was closed at 2:00pm ET, then trending down again. Very clear downtrend from here."
"This is now high than the price in may, it's way too high now. be careful, will fall back under $38.Hope you had a great day trading this like me, but I'm not holding overnight. way too dangerous"
"Omg what happened to this stock? Investors lost their shirt on this one...makes you wanna get out of the market, doesn't it?"
had 2500 shares two weeks agodumped 2000 thank godwish i dumped the rest too
"Looking @ options which are my speciality I see FSLY down to around $30 or so after earnings. Sorry, just the way it is, too many huge money put option buys all week expiring next week. If you are long just sell and short it’s going to zero. Thank me later. Logic says it’s down from 136 to 40 so it will go up, NOPE, it’s gone down from 136 to 40 because the company is a scam."
80 bags here and can only hope for a positive earnings catalyst. When your bags are this empty no use in cutting loses.
"Had a good day but the price is WAAAY to high now, it will settle back to $38 from my technical analysis"
Almost a 52 week low congratulations  to all 136 bag holders I still haven’t covered
Buy high sell low?lolYou shorts are still holding on after the bottom?lol See you at $280.
Why is FSLY dropping fastly? Maybe it should change its name? LOL
Good level ($35) to start accumulating. Long term vision intact.
"First timer, I bought 200 share at $52.20!!!!looking into earnings...how will they do? anyone?"
I knew I should bought Slowly instead......:)
"Wow. If we close above $40, I am going to personally thank God."
There's a real appeal to the way Mr Joe Caused goes about his trades and explanations. And I really like his promptness to reply
"Rate FSLY a screaming buy at any price below 40. As always the longer you hold a stock, especially FSLY, the lower the risk of losing money"
They had some interesting insights about FSLY on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
this stock has been going down every day for the last two months every day. Never had a green day. Tomorrow will be key to either stop falling or be into a bottomless pit
"Go back and read my post before closing I said $30 easy just by reading the options chart. Doesn’t hurt the CEO Bixby sold $30,000,000 in stock so far this year LOL "
...floor..any thoughts ?
Are you ______ me? $42?
"Just listened to the Oppenheimer Conference presentation from last week. The company see 10s of thousands, maybe 100k, potential customers out there. They're driving towards $1b in annual sales and growth of 30%+ - they see 10 years of 30% growth. Just bot 1,000 shares in the low 40s. I doubt the stock will do much short term, but I like the long term outlook. I encourage everybody to listen to the Oppenheimer Conference presentation from last week."

"Will probably re-trace back down now and close around $37/38 from my technical analysis, but I had a great day trading this"
I just yolo bought 100 shares at 44.32. all I know about this company is people use the internet right? :)
Hold your shares
"$30 stock price, then $25 will be new range"
"FSLY holders. Don't sell here. Wait to see where this settles. I bought more today. FSLY is in a uber-high-growth market, just not executing properly. Maybe time to show CEO the door"
Volume looking good today! Can only go up!
Just like TWLO in its younger days....I just wish I still had my TWLO shares I bought just four years ago...
$42.27 buyers——————->
"Poster ""Amature"" is muted with all the fake pumps. Bye bye.We always have a fanatic to each stocks. They are blind, just look at what happened to Fastly. $fsly got decimated today. I lost over $700 withholding of 200 shares. Had to cut the loss, could not hold any longer. AND for me PLTR seems to be next on the chopping block!!!"
Who elese loaded up premarket -22%
I heard about FSLY the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Shorted $37 seems like a can’t miss trade will cover around $15
Short every pop from here on out.
Slowing growth and no profit margins.......not so good.
sold 500 share AH with $7000 loss. I held it too long believing it will recover and it did not! I feel so devastated today.
"I had a blast shorting this from $80 with tons of puts. I LOVE YOU , HYPE-CHASERS!!!"
So far this company has been my worst investment. But I’m still optimistic.
