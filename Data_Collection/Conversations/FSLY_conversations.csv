"Kristina Hooper, Invesco's strategist, was on Wall St Week on Bloomberg on Friday. Bloomberg's David Westin asked about speculation in cryptocurrencies and in SPACS. Hooper said she thought that this action may be a sign of some froth in financial markets right now. However, it's also a sign that investors are looking for returns and willing to consider risk assets. In her view, this is a sign that the bull market in stocks has further to run. As of June 30, Invesco owned 86,000 shares of FSLY, including 6,000 shares purchased during April-May-June. Invesco will be filing their Q3 13F in the next several weeks. It will be interesting to see if they added some additional shares to their position."
Earnings report must be good since there’s no news. Nothing like insider trading
"FSLY was granted a patent... apparently what's leading to the spike today. (However, still looking for source communications)."
fsly breaks your heart...sell at least half position pre-earnings
Good earnings?
"Nuveen's Chief Investment Officer Saira Malik was on Bloomberg-The Close on Thursday. She described herself as ""moderately bullish"". She said she thought that a bull market is still ongoing and that earnings growth could take the market higher by a single digit percentage in 2022.As of June 30 Nuveen owned over 300,000 shares of FSLY, so they like the stock. Nuveen will be filing their next 13F in the next month, so it will be interesting to see if they add to their position."
"Important: DA Davidson analyst Rishi Jaluria downgraded Fastly to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $33, down from $60. The analyst cites the company's Q2 revenue miss and reduced FY21 guidance as June outages resulted in a top-10 customer and several others pulling all traffic from its network, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Jaluria further cites the management's commentary that there have been delays in those same new customer ramps this quarter, unrelated to the June outage."
Amazon returns to the fold...VALIDATION...
Today is the kinda day that the bag holding from 80 doesn’t feel to bad.
Insider sale... Time to get out..
Anyone know why jump up
sell sell sell
This patent alone is worth more then 5X what FSLY is trading for right now! This stuff is genius...
"Richard Weiss, the CIO at American Century, was on Bloomberg-The Close on Friday. He said that he likes small cap stocks right now. American Century was holding 645,000 shares of FSLY as of June 30, so if they're buying small caps right now, they may be adding to their position in FSLY."
"Gargi Chaudhuri, a strategist with Blackrock, was on Bloomberg Markets/Americas on Wednesday. There's been a lot of talk on Wall St about whether higher interest rates have been driving down the price of tech stocks. Chaudhuri said she thought that there could be more volatility for the next 2-3 weeks, but that longer term a 10 year Treasury rate in the 1.7 - 2.0 range wouldn't stop tech stocks from rallying. FSLY is a stock that Blackrock likes. In the 2nd quarter, they bought 441,000 shares, and they owned a total of 4.3m shares as of June 30. We saw some institutional buying in FSLY late Wednesday, with price and volume both moving higher into the close. Who knows, maybe Blackrock is once again adding to their position."
"The New Jersey state employees pension fund has filed their 13F for Q3. They owned 67,000 shares as of Sept 30, including 7,200 purchased in Q3. Not huge numbers of shares but I always like to see pension fund investors. They do a lot of due diligence and they only invest people's pension money in solid businesses, nothing speculative."
"Why do so many hate this stock so much? I’m holding my 200 shares through earnings. Got to turn it around, right?"
Today is the HAPPIEST day for me. I finally sold this disgusting stock. Bought it at $75 and kept hoping that it recovers. Can’t believe I’m happy with losing so much. But it’s true 
"Brian Belski, the strategist at Bank of Montreal, was on the Halftime Report on CNBC on Friday. Some strategists have been recommending selling tech stocks and rotating into other sectors like energy, but Belski is saying no, don't sell tech. He believes tech and communications services will be the best sector over the next several years because that's where the growth is. As of June 30 Bank of Montreal owned 33,000 shares of FSLY. They'll be filing their 13F for the July-Aug-Sept quarter in the next couple of weeks. Since they like tech it will be interesting to see if they've added to what was a relatively modest position in FSLY on June 30."
Short sellers wanted to cover.
what's happening with NET?. Really great price action. I wish FSLY will do something like that
SHORTing time lads. get ready to drag this back to where it belong 7-10$ range
We just can't seem to hold the momentum. We are back to red again.
SELL before earnings.. this is a CDN company that cannot compete with NET.. and have had outtage issuesand clients leaving in droves.. BAND is a better investment IMHO and trades at a fraction of the multiple.High Conviction Short !
Any news?Fsly is on trending today
waiting for 60+ hmmmmmm
"Alli McCartney, a Managing Director at UBS Wealth Management, was on Closing Bell on CNBC on Monday. Q3 earnings will start to be reported by companies later this week. McCartney said that she is expecting a strong earnings season, and therefore she believes that recent declines in stock prices represent a buying opportunity.In the April-May-June quarter, UBS increased its position in FSLY by 83% with a buy of 168,000 shares. After the big decline in the stock price from well over $100, I think a lot of investors see FSLY as attractively priced at current levels."
what happened to fastly ? isn't it a compare cyber security company to crowdstrike and cloudflare ?
So much for our rally
Institutional investors are moving into FSLY today. Volume of 1.2m shares in the first hour of trading today. I expect a good earnings report from FSLY on Nov 3.
Back to over $100 but this time by 2022 will be $250. Just hold tight!
It will go a bit high today to attract buyer then drop like no tomorrow by end of the day. Fishing.
ESCAPE
I am finally in control of my finances and ready to invest! FSLY to the moon! Red!
"Barclays is out with a note today saying any dips in the market should be bought. As of June 30, Barclays owned close to 200,000 shares of FSLY. Now that FSLY has mostly recovered from their network outage, institutional investors are starting to come back into the stock and buy any dip that takes the share price close to $40."
Haha it went up Fastly today !
"Should be high 30's at best for a second rate CDN company with massive losses and growth suspectwith Cloudflare dominating the space.. Look out below, expect a landslide .."
This is only company stock price currently is over analyst target price of $37. This means this stock will go higher. All my other stocks are 40% below analysts target price. Al my other stocks are not going up but staying flat.
My guess is we are at $100 after earnings or $30 or maybe we just stay where we're at. We will see in 9 days. Place your bets.
"Adobe is out with its online holiday shopping forecast. They're predicting a record $207b in sales - this is positive for FSLY, especially now that Amazon is back on the network."
"AJ Oden, Head of Investment Risk at BNY Mellon Investor Solutions, was on the Closing Bell on CNBC on Monday. He said he wouldn't be surprised to see small cap stocks (the Russell 2000) outperform for the rest of the year. As of June 30, BNY Mellon Investor Solutions owned around 600,000 shares of FSLY, including 23,000 shares purchased in the April-May-June quarter. I'm seeing institutional investors coming into FSLY. With its $5b market cap, FSLY is a small cap stock, so BNY Mellon may have been among those buying today."
The short interest is so big. Watch out for sudden drop to 20s. No earnings !
This is a growth stock
"Alicia Levine, the market strategist at BNY Mellon, was on Bloomberg - The Close on Thursday. In the very short run she's got some concerns about the stock market - concerns about Covid/Delta and supply chain disruptions. But medium to longer term she remains positive and feels the market can move higher. She said we're now past the peak of economic growth and she now likes technology/growth stocks that can grow their earnings in a slower growing economy.As of June 30, BNY Mellon owned close to 600,000 shares of FSLY, and they added 23,000 shares in the April-May-June quarter. FSLY is a fast growing company, the kind of company that BNY Mellon is now looking for, so I would expect them to be buying an increasing number of shares in the current quarter and later quarters."
A takeover target?
"Olivia Engel, a strategist with State Street, was on Bloomberg Markets on Monday morning. Right now she likes companies with strong balance sheets, where management has a long term plan for the business.In last month's earnings conference call Fastly said, ""We will continue to invest in our network in a disciplined manner, keeping long-term profitability in mind. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with 1.1 billion in cash, restricted cash, and investments. We remain well capitalized to invest in the future growth of Fastly.""In the April-May-June quarter, State Street bought 379,000 shares of Fastly, and ended the quarter owning a total of 1.4m shares. I think Fastly is the kind of stock State Street is looking for right now, and I think they will continue to buy."
"The patent they just received titled ""load balancing across origin servers"" is huge. Let's see what happen to the share price :-)"
"$FSLY is about to explode in revenue now that they are already working with Microsoft. $100 is when I'll think about exiting some of my shares, not a dollar sooner."
Whats wrong with fsly ?
Cdn king is back!
"Yesterday was a holiday (for the bond market) so a lot of the Wall St. strategists are out with notes today. Tom Lee, one of the most widely followed strategists on the Street, is saying that his base case continues to be that stocks will rally into year end. Marko Kolanovic at JP Morgan, who is also widely followed, believes Covid/Delta has peaked, and that investors should maintain a pro-risk allocation. And UBS is saying that the ""Equity Rally Has Further To Run"". My view is that we're going to get a positive report from FSLY on Nov 3, and that investors should be buying the stock ahead of the report. As of June 30, UBS owned 371,000 shares of FSLY, and JP Morgan owned 178,000. I think we'll see significant buying by these and other institutional investors once FSLY reports their quarter."
We report Thursday and NET reports Friday. How do you think we will fair compared to them? Are we going to be up Thursday then down Friday?
"I'm sorry, it was $984 million they raised for the purchase price of $102 by 2026. When Fastly starts moving up, it's gonna be quick. How does an $80 up day sound??"
"An investment company called Adirondack Retirement Specialists which has $100m under management in Queensbury, New York (about 50 miles north of Albany) has filed their 13F for the July-Aug-Sept quarter. During the quarter they added 7500 shares to their position in FSLY, and they ended the quarter owning 117,000 shares. Adirondack only owns 19 stocks, so obviously they like to concentrate on their best ideas, and FSLY is one of those. A nice vote of confidence for FSLY."
Cloud game development is gonna boom. They are already working with Microsoft Azur. They are gonna make a lot of money.
"back to ipo price, that's a joke"
"When we have an earnings surprise and shorts begin to cover, we’ll be in for a nice SP!"
"I bought this at SP of 75 and holding it, and thought the name of company FSLY as it went down ""Fastly""..So happy to see this anf know it can go up ""Fastly"" as well :D"
"Buying FSLY today is going to be like playing a roulette,,,"
"An investment company called Long Walk Management that has $175m under management in Connecticut has filed their 13F for July-Aug-Sept. During the quarter they bought 103,000 shares of FSLY, and they ended the quarter owning 429,000 shares. Long Walk only owns 6 stocks, so obviously they like to concentrate on their best ideas, and FSLY is one of those. A nice vote of confidence for FSLY."
If the earnings even they miss on revenue or eps by narrow margin it goes back to 35. But if they beat or meet the street expectations it will go 65 easily . Good luck !
Why hold this until earnings when every time it drops like a rock afterwards.
Posted by a VC on Twitter:You really can’t make this stuff up:Got a call from a Fastly exec today who was trying to resign but their boss had just resigned so they didn’t know who to tell that they’re resigning.As the saying goes- the impact of bad culture and leadership are felt gradually then Fastlyhttps://twitter.com/bryce/status/1443376158695899140?s=21
Have you guys ever heard of http://alert-sounds.com/? The picks on there are way better than FSLY
FLSY always recovers well when oversold. Hopefully earnings and outlook is better this time around.
Patent Secured ! !
Firm just bought $50 million worth of shares. Nobody does that with a failing company. Nobody does that listing to shills on yahoo forums.
$150 target price in 2022. Buy now before it goes back up big time.
Sold my position today. RSI was 70 and its going down. I expect 45 before earnings.
"get ready head up to $60, FSLY!"
this is going up on heavy volume. there may be news forthcoming? IDK
I see no reason to own this over $30. It's going down !
Shorts don’t win today close 50+
Why is earth_rover crying?
"Compared the numbers between net and fsly. In the last 2 years, both had around 50% increase in overall revenue, but the increase in losses was only 15% for net but 90% for fsly. Looks to me that fsly is still showing that typical large loss scenario for growth companies, while net is coming out of that cycle. I think at some point, fsly will do that same and the stock price will rebound. Big issue is when will that begin to show up -- lower losses for fsly?"
"Morgan Stanley has been the most bearish firm on Wall St lately. Their strategist, Mike Wilson, has been calling for a selloff in stocks throughout this year. But now, he's turning more positive. He's out with a note on Monday saying, ""Equity markets may remain well bid in the near term."" I saw him on Squawk Box on CNBC on Monday and he likes tech. He said that companies are going to start investing more in technology.As of June 30, Morgan Stanley was FLSY's largest shareholder, with 13.5m shares, including around 400,000 shares that they bought in Q2. They obviously like the stock. Now that they're turning more positive on the market, and expecting increased investment in technology, it wouldn't be a surprise if they started adding to their position in FSLY."

"This stock is so underrated. They are working with Microsoft, Shopify, Stripe, Shazam, Github and Imgur. Github and Imgur have more than half billion visit in a month. Shazam half billion new user per year. They are working with Microsoft Azur on cloud game developing, GAME DEVELOPING. This is insane! They are going to make a lot of money!"

Something good seems to be brewing...Time to get the toes wet..
short squeeze?
"Buy MIRO, Bidu, QS, DCRC, NNOX if you want to get rich fast."
"Rick Rieder, the Head of the Global Allocation Team at Blackrock, and one of the more influential voices on Wall St, was on the Halftime Report on Monday on CNBC. He's been buying some stocks today, but not a lot, waiting for a bottom. He said longer term, ""There is no doubt in my mind that equities are headed higher"", and ""There could be significant upside to US stocks."" Tech is one of the sectors that Rieder said that he likes, and FSLY is a stock that Blackrock likes. In the April-May-June quarter, they bought 440,000 shares, and they owned a total of 4.3m shares as of June 30. It wouldn't be a big surprise if Blackrock started buying more shares of FSLY in the near future."
Fastly is more of an edge computing company than a CDN
tomorrow 15 % down 20% down? this is $$$ stock
https://go.trade-ideas.com/SHFB
FSLY Has been oversold for too long. Time to get what it’s worth. $100+ EOY.
Today will drop to $39.40
"This was a $19 stock before the pandemic. Now, im not saying it still is, but with the rise of it's income, its losses has jumped or doubled. Huge losses. I just don't see a catalyst for this right now, income will probably drop and more people head back to the office. Last month was a big month for many returning employees like us."
"I believe a base is forming. I haven't purchased yet.......but think once I begin to see some large block buys I will jump in. IMO FSLY has potential to see $55+ Am also looking at BILI as a possible buy. Currently holding NVDA, SQ, OKTA, and SHOP."
It will go back to 7-9$ by end of next 2 quarters/earnings. No one’s buying them as well. They have poor customer satisfaction record and their ceo talks shot in earnings. STAY AWAY or SHORT
"I am holding 1,200 shares of FSLY at $61. This is not looking good. Not sure if there is a future for this company."
"A lot of people on here trying to spread FUD. Shorts are worried. This room is usually dead. I’m guessing earnings pop. That mixed in with, positive forward expectations and higher than usual short interest should trigger a nice run up."
"Well known tech investor Kevin Landis was on Closing Bell on CNBC on Thursday. He was asked how the various uncertainties that the stock market now faces - China/Evergrande, rising commodity prices, rising interest rates, a possible default on US government debt - could affect things. He said that if the market gets into trouble, there will be fewer and fewer good growth stories out there, and the scarcity of growth stories will make the ones that are there more valuable. At the Oppenheimer Investment Conference a couple of months ago, FSLY said that they expect 10 years of 30% growth in their business. There's not all that many businesses that have that kind of growth opportunity, so this could be the kind of story that investors like Landis are looking for."
I heard about FSLY the other day on (http://Multistockalerts.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
"So FSLY will triple over 5 year period as per Motley Fool? Appreciate feedback, should I buy Apple or FSLY?"
Go to 80s
"A gift at under $40 Think 2 to 3 years out, $100 plus"
"David Lebovitz, JP Morgan's Global Market Strategist, was on Bloomberg-The Close on Friday. He said that volatility could continue in the stock market for a few more weeks, but ""We remain very constructive on the outlook as we look ahead to 2022.""As of June 30, JP Morgan owned around 120,000 shares of FSLY. My view is that we are going to get some good news from FSLY when they report their quarterly results on Nov 3, and JP Morgan and other institutional investors will come in and buy after that."
Close above 50 alert
why won't u stay above 50. get back to 80 so I can break even. awful investment
Looks like funds are going to push Fsly much higher probably seeing much higher prices goi g forward to 2022.
Not a buy. Check short interest. It's going up. Be safe ! 20 be good entry !
Thats what I’m talking bout baby! Run forest run!
"Billionaire investor Paul Tudor Jones was on Squawk Box on CNBC on Wednesday. Long term he's got some concerns about inflation and higher interest rates, but for the here and now he likes stocks. He thinks that with the inflation we've got and the higher interest rates he expects later you should be in equities not bonds. He points out that in the last year and a half the Fed has created a huge amount of new money and this is moving into stocks. He said, ""The flows into equities are incredible."" My thoughts on the remarks made by Jones: When the economy is strong enough to generate higher inflation, Fastly's Internet business should do well, and should provide at least a partial hedge against inflation."
"Big dip to shake out the weak hands so that your shares can be bought cheaper. This will go higher so keep holding, do not fall for the dip and don't let your shares go on the cheap."
Lowering target from $30 to 20 with strong sell rating !
"Over 500,000 shares of volume in the first 15 minutes of trading. Definitely institutional investors buying."
"Kristina Hooper, Invesco's Chief Global Market Strategist, was on Bloomberg - The Close on Monday. She stated that she's positive that the market will end the year higher than it did today.As of June 30, Invesco owned 86,000 shares of FSLY, after adding a few thousand shares during the second quarter. Invesco is a long term investor, so it wouldn't be a surprise if they took advantage of the current low stock price to add to their position."
What's going on?
"Larry Fink, the CEO of Blackrock, was on Squawk Box on CNBC on Wednesday. He noted that the stock market lately has been trading up and down, but he said that he's bullish longer term and that he's eventually expecting to see a series of higher highs in the market. A large block shares traded on Wednesday just before 2pm, looked like an institutional investor coming in and buying. Blackrock is one of FSLY's largest shareholders. As of June 30, they owned 4.2m shares, including 441,000 that they bought during April-May-June. Who knows, maybe they added more shares today."
Stock price still too high.
Earnings might have been leaked? Good earnings coming?
"When this runs 50% like it has in the past, expect tears from all those hedge fund managers."
"Seeing some buying by institutional investors on Friday. A large block traded at around 10:10am. Morgan Stanley, Blackrock, Vanguard, State Street, and Credit Suisse all owned over 1m shares as of June 30. One of these large investors may be adding to their position today."
About time!!! What's the news?
Just bought 500 shares to start building a position.
"(NYSE:FSLY) shares were trading higher Tuesday after the company was granted a U.S. patent titled ""load balancing across origin servers."""
"Worst stocks I've owned in past year: FSLY, RKT, BIGC, FROG, PLTR, TDOC..."
"Sherry Paul, a portfolio manager with Morgan Stanley, was on Bloomberg - The Close on Tuesday. She believes we're in a secular bull market. One theme she likes right now is the ""digitization of everything"", a theme that plays right into what FSLY is doing on the Internet.Morgan Stanley is FSLY's largest shareholder. In the April-May-June quarter they bought 400,000 shares, and they ended the quarter owning 13.5m shares. Obviously MS really likes this stock. I think that portfolio managers at MS that want to play the theme of the ""digitization of everything"" are most likely continuing to buy FSLY."
amazon back to the network
Fsly to 50$:)))
Short sellers are reasons why stock prices way depressed to these levels. Otherwise stock should trade at $65 levels.
"So they made their numbers for the quarter. If they had missed, they would have pre-announced in today's press release which gives the date for the release of the financial results.Fastly will release financial results for the third quarter of 2021 after market close on Wednesday, November 3, 2021."
Debt kind of high
"Maybe today selloff is, in part, because of Facebook outage... But I think that Facebook used akamai in the past and now uses its own cdn, correct me if I'm wrong. I take it as an opportunity to double my position, I'm confident that in a few weeks collaboration with Apple will be revealed, and with Amazon back on board we will see a good ER"
I think it’s the time to buy right now.
W patterns are for winners!
Its a trap mostly with no legit news to cheer.

This earning needs to be good after sluggish growth in previous quarters.
After earning it will go down massively
"SYDNEY - 22 SEPTEMBER, 2021 -- Fastly, Inc. (NYSE: FSLY), a global edge cloud platform provider, today announced that Melbourne-based linking platform, Linktree, has deployed Fastly's edge cloud platform and next-gen cloud-based web application firewall (Cloud WAF) to support its 16 million global users, making their online content easier to find, safer to manage, and likelier to convert on social media platforms and eCommerce stores.Linktree decided to leverage Fastly's edge cloud platform to enable the organisation's developers by facilitating more team members to use the infrastructure simultaneously, saving time and streamlining the DevOps lifecycle. With a dedicated CI/CD pipeline for deploying changes to Fastly, access to the Fastly UI can now be restricted, and developers can make changes easily via pull request.In addition, Linktree has worked with Fastly to improve its security posture and scale seamlessly at a time when the organisation faced a three-month sign-up spike during which millions of new users created an evergreen link to their online content.Fastly's Cloud WAF deployment option offered a dev-friendly environment, including the accessibility to work at the edge and use Typescript code at the application layer.""Although we had rules set up in our [previous] WAF, it was case by case rather than a holistic solution,"" says Paul Oram, Engineer Manager, Linktree. ""We wanted it to cover the whole edge and integrate with our content delivery network. Indeed, there was a time when I was in the console all day every day, looking at attack surfaces and putting in rules to either block or rate limit them.""Early on in their engagement with Fastly, Linktree noticed a bad actor that had written a Python script to create multiple fake accounts daily. Leveraging Fastly's Cloud WAF, Linktree's team was able to create new rules within two minutes to block the bot. Fake accounts were shut down instantly.Hot on the heels of the Fastly edge cloud platform and Cloud WAF deployment has been a performance boost. Uptime increased from 96 percent to 99.999 percent, putting the platform in a much better position to prepare for the unexpected.""Selena Gomez might join the platform, then [Metallica], and that sets off a cascade of new users that you just can't predict. Having Fastly scale underneath us has been super beneficial,"" says Bradley Shawyer, Head of Engineering at Linktree.During 2021, Linktree has seen steady growth with changing consumer behaviours, including more time spent on social media and online shopping. In the first three months of 2021, that growth spiked to add 4 million new users, with sign-ups peaking at around 43,000 per day.Fastly has been a strategic upgrade for the Linktree developer and technical teams to meet evolving consumer and market conditions.""It just works the way it should in a DevOps environment and is straightforward to empower infrastructure-as-code. Programmability and being able to work with Fastly in code has been powerful for Linktree. At the same time, Fastly has enabled Linktree to benefit beyond the engineering team - we supported the customer success team to lighten their load. The integrated product is working well for us. It's handled everything we need it to,"" says Oram.Next on the team's agenda are ongoing security improvements, exploring Fastly's Image Optimizer, and moving Linktree's monolith application to serverless microservices architecture. Fastly helps people stay better connected with the things they love. Fastly's edge cloud platform enables customers to create great digital experiences quickly, securely, and reliably by processing, serving, and securing our customers' applications as close to their end-users as possible - at the edge of the internet. Fastly's platform is designed to take advantage of the modern internet, to be programmable, and to support agile software development with unmatched visibility and minimal latency, empowering developers to innovate with both performance and security. Fastly's customers include many of the world's most prominent companies, including Pinterest, The New York Times, and GitHub."
Breakout ! Run Fsly Run!!!!
"$150 by 2022. $300 by $2025. Only holding 500 measly shares due to fact I ain't rich. Oh well, hope my targets come true."
"fsly,has a negative earnings per share of 1.50,akami a positive of 3.50 and viac a positive of $5 . What's a better buy"
I am staying far away from FSLY - It looks like it is going to drop off a cliff. I actually get way better stocks at http://alert-sounds.com/
Fastly is up 6.21% to 47.55
