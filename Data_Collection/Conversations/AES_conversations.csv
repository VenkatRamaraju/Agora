Very quiet here. Any active investors?
Have to say that the new presidents line on climate change is only going to benefit this company of ours - utility scale battery is gonna be huge and aes and its 50% owned subsidiary fluency gonna be major beneficiaries of the
So glad I loaded up with more shares back in March when it took a big dive.
"Need to get a new CEO -- Andres Gluski is a nice guy ,,, however, he was an average Exec. at a below average utility (Electricidad de Caracas) andnow he's the CEO of AES ???? I know it was Arthhur D. Little consultants who did the analysis for EDC to seekout AES for a reverse acquisition (to avoid a hostile deal with someone EDC didn't want to associate with) .... and that was the path Gluski became associated with AES. But it was the Partner(s) at ADL who were the experts in this field. How did Gluski ever become the head of AES?? I'm telling you he's, at best, a mid-level Officer of a Company like AES. The Board of Directors needs to find a true leader and strong intellect to guide this Company.... just offer Andres early-retirement and let's move on !!"
"- Fluence, a global battery storage joint venture of Siemens AG and AES Corp., said it reached an agreement with the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar for a $125 million investment.The funding will give the Qatar Investment Authority a 12% stake in Fluence and values the battery company at more than $1 billion, the companies said Wednesday in a joint statement. Siemens and AES will retain a 44% stake each following completion of the deal, the companies said.“This is one more milestone in our strategy of setting this company up and eventually taking it public,” AES Chief Executive Officer Andres Gluski said in an interview. The investment will allow Fluence to expand its energy storage offerings and develop its software that can maximize battery use in power markets, he said.The global energy storage business is expected to boom in the coming decades as utilities will look to batteries to backstop an increasing amount of intermittent solar and wind power. BloombergNEF forecasts that the worldwide energy storage market could attract nearly $1 trillion in investments over the next three decades.AES was an early entrant into the battery market, moving into the field more than a decade ago. Gluski said earlier this year that AES and Siemens were looking to sell a minority stake in Fluence, which has about 2.4 gigawatts of battery capacity installed or under development.Fluence will have about $500 million in revenue this year and expects it to grow annually at 40% to reach $3 billion by the end of 2025, Gluski told investors in August."
"AES Corp are investing in Uplight, Fluence, New preferred stock, that I think will sell out swiftly. I think we are heading on the course to greatness."
Great news! AES just announced quarterly dividend for Q1 of $0.1433 per share which is unchanged since it increased its dividend in December to $0.573 per share annually. This is great news as there was some speculation in the analyst community that they would reduce their dividend this quarter.
"Alright, estimates beat, trading below market value. Should see slow rise soon enough."
Anyone here thinking of buying the Fluence I.P.O ?
Anthony back to 22.50 from 8 mo. ago it is down over 25% from its high takes time 17.50 -18.00 will be a good buy .
AES has been one of my best investments. I definitely credit the CEO Andres Gluski. He has totally changed the trajectory of this company and the strategy is crystal clear. AES is the leader in energy storage which is about to become (or already is becoming) a game changer for this industry. I think they're well positioned for the future.
"Bought 10 $25 March calls earlier this morning. Happy to join the very quiet club here. Sentiment based on put/call ratio and the open interest 26-30 seems to be quite bullish. Analyst price targets around $30. Not expecting crazy movement or a massive earnings beat.. I just like how institutionally owned this is, not to mention the diverse energy portfolio/customer base"
"Wow, and I was thinking this Fluence news would bring us to $30 ???"
"Up, Up, Up I can’t wait for the Fluence IPO!"
Anybody Still Here?
"I think LNG is a smart play. Go AES, your a winner"
What a great run we’ve been on
"One of the key challenges to deploying renewable energy at scale is energy storage, or batteries. Solar and wind are ""intermittent"" sources of energy -- they turn off at night and when the wind stops blowing. So solar and wind power plants need to store excess energy during peak times to then supply it during the off times.A lot of innovation is needed in this space, and while there are some promising technologies on the horizon and some leadership beginning to develop, there are few independent public companies dedicated solely to storage. One of the current market leaders is Fluence, a private company, and a joint venture between the AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) and Siemens (OTC:SIEGY).Here AES gets to ""double-dip"" into renewables -- both as a U.S. utility that has successfully pivoted to renewable generation and project development, and as an investor in Fluence. As a utility, AES stock has outpaced the S&P 500 for the last five years. As an early stage investor, AES derives very little in terms of financial value from Fluence at this time. However, as Fluence continues to grow and solidify its leadership position, AES is bound to benefit. And AES's stock is priced much more affordably than Tesla's (NASDAQ:TSLA), its main competitor in large-scale storage."

"Many investors panicked during this pandemic and even sold their defensive positions. Cooler heads who understand that power is an inelastic service (people need electricity even during pandemics and market downturns). Utility stocks could recover quickly once investors realize that its defensive for a reason...fairly predictable income and consistent dividends.a swift recovery for utility stocks,"" once investors sense losses have bottomed out and begin moving back into traditionally safe stocks with strong dividends. AES is investment grade, a value pick because price dropped, innovativ and pays a lucrative growing dividend."
"The $15 resistance will be difficult to break, but once we pass that barrier, prepare to go the moon.-"
"With a growth rate annually at 40% to reach $3 billion by the end of 2025 their Fluence JV will add 8-10 billion to the companies assets post IPO. AES has already said they will IPO Fluence and since AES should keep most of their shares, it will dramatically decrease their liability profile. The value of those shares in Fluence will represent a long term asset. In addition you add the growth of operating renewable deployments and your looking at a rocketship. If you don't understand what I just said then move along, but if you do understand you will want to invest."
Down 4.5% pre market with no news??
AES is up 9.65% to 11.76
"Disturbing reaction to what I thought was a great call. Revenues rose YoY in spite of everything and projects coming online at rapid pace plus the backlog is huge. The add ons with battery storage, Uplight, and now battery production makes this a much greater growth story but Wall Street said Meh! I'm a long term holder and will collect the divvy while this play out. What bank is paying 2.3% with ownership and ability to capture growth in shares."
"Listening to call. No new equity raises thru 2025. Increasing dividend profile. All in all, very good quarter. The Fluence and Uplight investments WILL be monetized over time. Those are very exciting parts of this business. The Google deal is the new model for 24/7 renewable reliability. This and NEE are the leaders in green energy. PERIOD!"
Happy New Year. This thing is just warming up. I think we have years if growth in front of us.
"Up from a beginning of the year price of 14.2/share. Why the run up, not that I'm complaining?"
"Did they indicate if shareholders would get Fluence shares or would AES retain shares and just get the cash. Not opposed to either route. Retaining the stake would generate cash that may result in less (or no) equity issuance, which has hurt our share price."
"Argus research actually has a price target of $24. Prior to the Pandemic, it was heading in that direction and was over $21. AES is probably the most innovative utility company in the U.S. focused on renewables, energy storage, etc. It’s a great investment with a growing dividend for past 5 years."
I still can’t believe there are not more retail investors in this ESG stock. 1 month ago AES was at 22.50 and look at it now!
"Todo indica que las acciones van a subir, se presenta una linea de resistencia en $12, el score esta en su punto maximo (OUTPERFORM), el balance sheet esta bien, strong buy , el low price es $15 y el target de $17.9, los fondos estan bien, es una compania que opera en el servicio electrico de muchos paises y se mantiene operando aun con la pandemia, no tuvo que detener sus operaciones por esta causa. Este es el momento indicado se invertir en esta compania. Buena suerte.Everything indicates that the shares are going to rise, there is a resistance line at $ 12, the score is at its maximum point (OUTPERFORM), the balance sheet is fine, strong buy, the low price is $ 15 and the target is $ 17.9, the funds are fine, it is a company that operates in the electrical service of many countries and continues operating even with the pandemic, it did not have to stop its operations for this reason. This is the right time to invest in this company. Good luck."
"as i can see if nsdq cross 15200 below then easily AES can fall down 2% that might be 24.80$ , but it has to be open flat not gap up,,"
$16 baby
"I got a few bigger earners this year from March low , but my favorite is AES . I like the corporation and what they are doing and love the dividend."
"AES' strategy of pursuing renewables, de-risking the company and leading the way in new technologies like energy storage is benefiting from several long term trends, including environmental goals from investors, lots of capital available for low risk investments, and transformation of the energy sector. Credit to Andres for shifting the direction of the company in the past several years, the stock had a lot of momentum in last 18 months but there is still a lot to go given the long term trends and favorable dynamics to execute the strategy."
I just don't understand why this company is not on more folks radars
This stock is going to $60. Thank me later and sell it at that price
Full year earnings guidance $1.50-$1.58 vs. avg. analyst estimate $1.56.
Someone or someones bought a ton of call options at 23 that expire next week. Any ideas why all the activity?
