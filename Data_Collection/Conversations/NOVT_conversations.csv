"Shaggy: Okay, bailed from NOVT. held for 3 years. CAGR 28%. very respectable. reason to go: super buy opportunity (over a -10% price dip!) for GenerAC (GNRC). used funds from NOVT to finance. NOVT has been very good. consistent. NO regrets! looking for GNRC to rock on. you've been silent on NOVT for a long time! see you on the GNRC board?"
"oc, you still holding this? Posted good numbers, though it appears the guidance was a bit weak, or actually just shy of consensus, so weak is not really accurate."
NOVT is up 8.19% to 77.65
"I just get the feeling that they are getting ready to tank the Hades out of this one, they already dumped all of the other players in the sector but for some reason have left this one alone."
"Shaggy: Entered a -6.5% LO/PrevClose Trade Trigger contingent order at TDA for NOVT. NOVT is doing well, according to monitoring here. (FWIW: -6.5% has occurred four times since June 12 of last year; buys at any one of those price points would show very nice gains as of right now.) Onwards and sideways. I am very surprised that the conversations are not more active here on the NOVT board??? The company is 'on fire'???[Also posted this over on COHR; I have a mental 'tie-in' i've formed between this outfit and Coherent!)"
"In a brutal sea of RED today, mighty little Novanta posted a one sixth of a percent GAIN... The only one in the port here... every single one of the others in RED, some getting hit with -4% and -10% (Square) losses... Investors/holders of NOVT seem to be standing on bedrock(?) Are we having fun or what?!"

Shaggy-Today's early numbers showing almost a -3% pull back... I'm sure you're monitoring... might be an opp to jump on it after another drop or two?

Novanta is down 5.46% to 82.55
"Port largely down, but NOVT up over 2% today, on top of earlier gains... currently, NOVT sits within 1% of their 52 week highs, best numbers in the OC port here... I think the stock is beyond the suspicion of being pumped... at least I think so... still, would like to have a better handle on just what are the details... nothing jumps out when looking at the news and reports... unless I've not been thorough enough... always a possibility!"

Down is still down, but I'm struck at how little NOVT fell... my high flyers are off by 5% and 6%... kind of a note of the resilience that holders of NOVT feel in heavy storm market conditions... worth noting, I think... carry on... that is all..."

"I bet this thing ends up green today, things that make you go hmmm."
"oc, I in theory agree with your 6.5 drop zone but I just don't feel right about this, I loved GSIG (now NOVT) though it never made me much money. There is just something rotten in Denmark, I feel like there is some sweaty fat pigs, namely big money funds and investors parked here while they tank the vast majority of the overall markets and once they get the prices of the majority of stocks down to a generational great entry point they will dump this quicker than a hot coal. I see that with a few other stocks too, your stamps.com may very well be one too, I don't follow it. Good luck, but be very careful, they are killing IPGP and COHR right now, IPGP pre-announced and it didn't meet previous guidance."

"Shaggy: 2018 Q4 EPS reported: $0.56, vs forecasted $0.51, a beat of right around +10%. Looking to see market's reaction on stock. Shouldn't fall, unless folks were ""actually looking for more"". Should get a bump. We'll see."

"Chris, Fidelity has their anticipated next earnings announcement set for March 5, 2018. It will be even more interesting to see how the early reporting competition reports, ESIO reports on Jan. 31 and Coherent reports Feb. 5."
NOVT is down 4.94% to 73.34
"Novanta continues its crazy climb, another percent and a quarter today... there has to be an underlying force, beyond its obvious numbers, responsible. Simple market momentum? Upcoming contracts with a customer? What? (Not complaining, just would like some illumination as to the why of such a sharp increase, if there is one.)"
"Down based on insider activity, really? My gosh, the fact that he waited until it broke 90, when you have COHR, IPGP and II-VI at fractions of NOVT's P/E is testimony that he has faith in the company, I would have been selling like crazy at 70."
"Bonzai, Batman!... 17% jump this morning... all is well in a single minute... haven't had a chance to look for news... hope it holds thru the week..."
"You know I love you like a brother oc, but this thing is jacked up, as you said, when in a sea of red this little train that could just keeps chugging uphill. I guess I just don't understand it and it just scares me though I have bought in and sold quickly on some dips, which usually only last a day or two. Good luck to you man but still believe this thing is being gamed by big money boys. No justification for P/E based on the sale price and P/E of ESIO, the P/Es of COHR, IPGP and II-VI of which two just reported decent but not great numbers."
"I must say, I have been very pleased with how well this company has held up to the crushing that the overall markets have seen to include others in this sector, such as ESIO and COHR. That should bode well for us going into earnings."

"oc, never can tell with today's market. Reactions have been completely random and illogical. OLED results were okay but not stellar and they exploded by ending up over 25%, NVDA got tanked but it has all but recovered every bit that it lost. SWKS had poor numbers but it was up over 10%. Texas Roadhouse had good numbers and they tanked the stock. Manitowoc had good numbers and they tanked the stock, Terex had good numbers and they tanked the stock, Dillard's had decent numbers and they blew the stock up over 20%. So who knows. Good luck though."

Smaller version of COHR in my opionion.
"""The company delivered excellent results in the first quarter, with better than expected revenue growth and Adjusted EPS,” said Matthijs Glastra, Chief Executive Officer of Novanta. “Revenue growth was 7% driven by robust medical end-markets. Overall, we are pleased with our performance""OH,,,,,, SO THAT WILL BE WHY THE WS SPIVS HAVE TAKEN IT DOWN 10% THEN; YOU HAVE EXCELLENT RESULTS AND 10% OF YOUR COMPANY'S VALUE [MC] DISAPPEARS - WELL THAT MAKES SENSE - DOES IT ""NOT""......."

"oc, are you going to hold through earnings??"
"Another amazing day for NOVT; when other stocks in the port were ALL SERIOUSLY IN THE RED, some as far as -4% and -5%, NOVT UP over one percent! (+1.15%) Looking for news of recent NOVT devs. Nothing spotted. Only other stock in the port in the black today: TTD. +0.2%. I don't understand a lot of it, but it is what it is. Amazing."
"P, you have become a laser expert congrats, how are your IPGP positions treating you?"
"Wow, still pumping this one even with weak pre-announcement from COHR. Very interesting."
"Still has a ridiculous P/E, still can't explain the logic of this stock, I have to throw it in with NVDA and AMD as irrational exuberance, or a money holding station for the uber wealthy who are now tanking the markets."

NOVT reached a 52 Week high at 80.99
"oc, to be honest with you, I thought that NOVT would have tanked to put its P/E back more in line with the likes of II-IV, IPGP and COHR, who are anywhere from 18 to 30, which is half of Novanta's. So overall you are holding pretty good to be even. Good luck with earnings, could be one wild ride with the mid terms and also COHR reporting as well, though they already pre-announced, we know what can still happen, looking at IPGP earnings after pre-announcing."
"Surprised that it recovered somewhat after it broke through 70, thought it might have another leg down, probably to the low 60s."
NOVT is up 5.13% to 51.20
This thing is a beast.
"Good Lord! +8% today, after a very rocky first hour or two. Far and away top of the port results here for Wednesday. I'm gonna have to say Mr. Market was duly impressed with the reported EPS beat of +10%... something more than just a 'bump' ... NOVT is turning into an engine, instead of just a chugga chugging along.... I'm guessing there is some technical / engineering advantage they have over their peers / competitors... If so, I'd like to know what it is, and premise to make a further add to the position if warranted..."

A ten percent bump (if it holds!) after posting barn burning earnings... nice to still have a sizable chunk in the company... (I wonder why the estimated figure was so WAY below the final??? Hmmmm...)
"NOVT, up 3% on the day... highest performer in the port today... Why? Somebody sees things? Quien sabe? Just glad to see it join the ranks of the gainers, after slumping along with the market earlier. Recent moves take me from up several percents to now 0.0% flat, since 7/31. Looking forward to tomorrow. Damn market, going to drive us all to doing POT."
"oc, been monitoring a couple of other stocks more closely, sorry fell off radar. Dude, it is just too high for me, like you asked, what is driving this thing?"

"oc, looks like a sound beat of .51 versus .47 and 150 Million revenues versus consensus around 145 Million. Should be a good day for longs, IIVI had a great day yesterday with positive news. It also looks like we are going to have an overall market in the green as well, that is always helpful."
Still worth a buy tomorrow?
"ESIO got bought out, really wasn't expecting that one, wonder whether the deal goes to fruition after MKS finishes their due diligence period, still think they cook their books."
"Man oh man, the little engine that could... NOVT puffing thru a 2.3% gain today... course, there were others, but here NOVT is close to the top port performer for the day... (and the week)"

"Well I was wondering when the big money would pull the plug on this one, apparently it has happened. What they pump has to be dumped at some point to allow for them to pump it again. Repeat cycle, screw the small investor and make tons of money for the wealthy overlords who manipulate and control the markets. They will drive this back to the 30s."
NOVT reached a new 52 Week High at 66.25
"oc, my take on the subject and if you recall I think you started to look at the company after one of my posts on the COHR blog, so I do know a little bit about the company which I originally invested in right after the debacle called the dot com bubble. At the time it was called GSI Lumonics, which was a combination of two of the companies that were acquired/merged. The company was a Canadian based company at the time and traded on the Toronto exchange as well as the NASDAQ if I recall correctly as GSI and later changed to GSIG after a major departure from focusing on the laser sector and acquiring companies that were more associated with motion controls. If I recall correctly I think they even bought a precision ball bearing manufacturer. These moves actually hurt the company initially as investors saw them going away from the laser side of the business. Their laser segment was almost entirely focused on the fabrication yields for semi-con industry. I sold in the late 2000s, I think about a year before the housing bubble and really lost track of the company. My background is electrical engineering and we did use CO2 lasers and even YAG lasers for metal working associated with CNC equipment in the heavy manufacturing arena. Though I had limited exposure to the types of lasers used for semi-con which were usually much lower power yet much more detailed in their control systems. I did come across a few General Scanning lasers in my career but never worked with them. With all that said, I had lost track of the company for several years so things have obviously changed and also for the good as if I recall correctly when I finally sold GSIG, I did so for 15.75 a share, while I did make a few bucks as I think I had bought 500 shares for about 12 dollars a share, the fact that i held them for about seven years means I didn't even keep up with inflation. Obviously in the interim it appears that they have done an admirable job of bringing all of the diverse pieces together to enter the medical laser industry pretty heavily. I assume these are used for laser surgeries to include LASIK type eye sight correction surgery. I find it rather amazing that given this sector and the publicity of the procedures that more people do not follow this stock, the lack of volumes really cause me to question the overall movements in this stock. If I recall correctly the stock sometimes traded a half a million shares on a good day, though average volumes were closer to 50K a day, now remember this was in the day when a retail investor had to pay several hundreds of dollars to buy and sell a stock. Given that we can trade a stock for ten bucks (buy and sell for 4.95) it still defies logic this doesn't illicit more volumes if it is really that well regarded of a company. As I have said to you on many occasions, I still see this as a shell game or something, I don't really understand it. It continues to climb meanwhile the rest of the tech sector and the laser sectors crashed, it didn't. I don't think it ever went under a P/E of 50. I tried to research it a bit with limited success. I am a bit surprised though that others didn't answer your post."
"Sorry oc, I just got to say it, its a beast, everything else is just dying in the sector, but NOVT just keeps climbing, new high after new high."
I muted Shaggy and now have this board to myself.
"oc, need to be very careful here, the big money may pound the snout out of this thing at any minute."
Seems this stock is ripe for a split....anybody agree?
"oc, I am scared to death to buy this one. The P/E is four to five times higher than the big dogs in the sector, there is no logical reason for this to be true. Granted after the ESIO buy out there is a level of speculation of another buy out with NOVT, though the major difference was that ESIO was at a P/E of around 5 or 6 if I recall correctly."

I'm in...target 100 in a month
"Seven months ago, all the way back in July 2018, when I made my buy in to NOVT, I exited 100% of my position from STMP to pay for NOVT. Yesterday STMP dumped ALMOST 50% when they announced they were cutting off from USPS. IS THAT KARMA OR WHAT!!!??? I'm taking it as an omen of the highest rank! Talk about dodging a massive bullet, and coming up roses."

"Hey Bob, good thing, see how you are doing. I told you they were just waiting for the right time to tank this."
"oc, the question just has to be asked, why is its P/E so, so much higher than its peers? Is it a potential take over target like ESIO? Sure, but the situation with ESIO, if you really want to believe their numbers were correct, their P/E was in the single digits and even with the take over offer being a 25% premium, I think it barely went back into the double digits, so again, if you believe their numbers (which you know I don't) that was a sheer value play. NOVT is in the triple digits, that is not a value play, whether you look at forward or trailing. Again, just my opinion, but I played with COHR and IPGP and saw the crashes there too."
"This just has to be played by some big money, no reason for this to essentially be near 52 week highs after the debacle of the tech sector drop of 2018. A P/E of 63 blows everything else in tech out of the water."

"oc, amazing this is at 52 week highs while both COHR and ESIO have tanked and even IPGP is off of highs by nearly 10%."
"oc, smaller company though very much in similar businesses to COHR, finally made up all of my losses on COHR by trading between 160 to 165. Novanta is a more interesting animal, never know how it will react when COHR and IPGP and even ESIO are getting hammered. I like to play NOVT as well though I am scared to death of it at these levels, if it drops to the low 60s I might buy but COHR and IPGP would have to be accelerating back up to 52 week highs, though that won't mean much to COHR if levels stay this depressed. I believe NOVT usually post earnings after COHR and ESIO but usually before IPGP, so it may be an interesting earnings season for the laser manufacturers. Good luck, yes not much chatter on this board. Back in the days of GSI Lumonics when it was a Canadian based company there was a lot more and it traded in the 5 to 15 range. Of course most of the posts came from a Canadian who kept saying everybody should buy gold because the economy was destined to collapse, this was back in 2004 to 5 range so he was actually a little pre-mature but he nailed the housing bubble, and I believe he actually used those exact words. Can't remember his sign on name now, but we would go back and forth, have to give his kudos."

When is earnings???
"Interesting: On a day when all around was redder than Lenin's tomb, little ol' NOVT stayed basically flat, at a meager +0.05%. The port overall here is down for the day at -2%... TTD finished off almost -15%... ouch... stunning to say the least... but back on NOVT, looks like the shareholders for NOVT have faith in this little company!"
NOVT may soon show it doesn't deserve its rich 50+ P/E. Low-power CO2 laser and scanner maker trying to re-imagine itself as a medical device company thru expensive acquisitions (net debt $147m) isn't immune to slower growth and higher interest rates. I would not be a buyer or holder here at this PPS. Look for an entry point under $40 IMHO.

"Holy Chihuahuas! In a day of 'all red' in the market, my little NOVT beat them out by far... more than a single session drop of -5% ... I'd research the 'why' of it, but I've been on the road the past couple of days and too tired... all said and done, in spite of all, my NOVT holding is up over 28% in less than twelve months... inclination is to hold... onwards and sideways we go..."
"So has anyone else noticed that this little non-descript stock is now up over 9 dollars a share in five trading days on no news other than an earnings report from COHR which really didn't help its stock price out? oc, wishing you luck but there is definitely something fishy in Denmark on this one."
"Yet another amazing performance from little NOVT. Literally the entire world is a sea of severe ugly red, and this company ALONE posts a 1.44% GAIN. Looking for news, nothing jumps out. I can only surmise that holders of these shares have deep convictions on the company. (Here in the OC port, it is running #4 in a port of nine; up 36% over the past 18 months.)"
