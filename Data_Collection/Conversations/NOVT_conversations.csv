"oc, you still holding this? Posted good numbers, though it appears the guidance was a bit weak, or actually just shy of consensus, so weak is not really accurate."
NOVT is up 5.13% to 51.20
"oc, never can tell with today's market. Reactions have been completely random and illogical. OLED results were okay but not stellar and they exploded by ending up over 25%, NVDA got tanked but it has all but recovered every bit that it lost. SWKS had poor numbers but it was up over 10%. Texas Roadhouse had good numbers and they tanked the stock. Manitowoc had good numbers and they tanked the stock, Terex had good numbers and they tanked the stock, Dillard's had decent numbers and they blew the stock up over 20%. So who knows. Good luck though."
"oc, are you going to hold through earnings??"
Still worth a buy tomorrow?
"oc, looks like a sound beat of .51 versus .47 and 150 Million revenues versus consensus around 145 Million. Should be a good day for longs, IIVI had a great day yesterday with positive news. It also looks like we are going to have an overall market in the green as well, that is always helpful."
"Shaggy: Entered a -6.5% LO/PrevClose Trade Trigger contingent order at TDA for NOVT. NOVT is doing well, according to monitoring here. (FWIW: -6.5% has occurred four times since June 12 of last year; buys at any one of those price points would show very nice gains as of right now.) Onwards and sideways. I am very surprised that the conversations are not more active here on the NOVT board??? The company is 'on fire'???[Also posted this over on COHR; I have a mental 'tie-in' i've formed between this outfit and Coherent!)"
"Why do they give this little stock the pass, meanwhile they tank the laser sector and the tech sector as a whole, very interesting, indeed."
"So has anyone else noticed that this little non-descript stock is now up over 9 dollars a share in five trading days on no news other than an earnings report from COHR which really didn't help its stock price out? oc, wishing you luck but there is definitely something fishy in Denmark on this one."
"You know I love you like a brother oc, but this thing is jacked up, as you said, when in a sea of red this little train that could just keeps chugging uphill. I guess I just don't understand it and it just scares me though I have bought in and sold quickly on some dips, which usually only last a day or two. Good luck to you man but still believe this thing is being gamed by big money boys. No justification for P/E based on the sale price and P/E of ESIO, the P/Es of COHR, IPGP and II-VI of which two just reported decent but not great numbers."
"oc, gave a little back today, though it still is probably the best in class holding up to the supposed turmoil. Good hold, wish I would have."
"oc, amazing this is at 52 week highs while both COHR and ESIO have tanked and even IPGP is off of highs by nearly 10%."
"Good Lord! +8% today, after a very rocky first hour or two. Far and away top of the port results here for Wednesday. I'm gonna have to say Mr. Market was duly impressed with the reported EPS beat of +10%... something more than just a 'bump' ... NOVT is turning into an engine, instead of just a chugga chugging along.... I'm guessing there is some technical / engineering advantage they have over their peers / competitors... If so, I'd like to know what it is, and premise to make a further add to the position if warranted..."
Smaller version of COHR in my opionion.
"Sorry oc, I just got to say it, its a beast, everything else is just dying in the sector, but NOVT just keeps climbing, new high after new high."
"Chris, Fidelity has their anticipated next earnings announcement set for March 5, 2018. It will be even more interesting to see how the early reporting competition reports, ESIO reports on Jan. 31 and Coherent reports Feb. 5."
"I must say, I have been very pleased with how well this company has held up to the crushing that the overall markets have seen to include others in this sector, such as ESIO and COHR. That should bode well for us going into earnings."
"Shaggy: Okay, bailed from NOVT. held for 3 years. CAGR 28%. very respectable. reason to go: super buy opportunity (over a -10% price dip!) for GenerAC (GNRC). used funds from NOVT to finance. NOVT has been very good. consistent. NO regrets! looking for GNRC to rock on. you've been silent on NOVT for a long time! see you on the GNRC board?"
"I bet this thing ends up green today, things that make you go hmmm."
"oc, the question just has to be asked, why is its P/E so, so much higher than its peers? Is it a potential take over target like ESIO? Sure, but the situation with ESIO, if you really want to believe their numbers were correct, their P/E was in the single digits and even with the take over offer being a 25% premium, I think it barely went back into the double digits, so again, if you believe their numbers (which you know I don't) that was a sheer value play. NOVT is in the triple digits, that is not a value play, whether you look at forward or trailing. Again, just my opinion, but I played with COHR and IPGP and saw the crashes there too."
"Bonzai, Batman!... 17% jump this morning... all is well in a single minute... haven't had a chance to look for news... hope it holds thru the week..."
"oc, smaller company though very much in similar businesses to COHR, finally made up all of my losses on COHR by trading between 160 to 165. Novanta is a more interesting animal, never know how it will react when COHR and IPGP and even ESIO are getting hammered. I like to play NOVT as well though I am scared to death of it at these levels, if it drops to the low 60s I might buy but COHR and IPGP would have to be accelerating back up to 52 week highs, though that won't mean much to COHR if levels stay this depressed. I believe NOVT usually post earnings after COHR and ESIO but usually before IPGP, so it may be an interesting earnings season for the laser manufacturers. Good luck, yes not much chatter on this board. Back in the days of GSI Lumonics when it was a Canadian based company there was a lot more and it traded in the 5 to 15 range. Of course most of the posts came from a Canadian who kept saying everybody should buy gold because the economy was destined to collapse, this was back in 2004 to 5 range so he was actually a little pre-mature but he nailed the housing bubble, and I believe he actually used those exact words. Can't remember his sign on name now, but we would go back and forth, have to give his kudos."
New trader watchlist was published by these guys and it featured NOVT. (https:// www.tradenow.xyz)
"Shaggy: Made the buy on today's -6.5% price drop... fingers crossing, eyes closing, and breath holding... ah, it's only money, right? LOL..."
"Hey Bob, good thing, see how you are doing. I told you they were just waiting for the right time to tank this."
"I just get the feeling that they are getting ready to tank the Hades out of this one, they already dumped all of the other players in the sector but for some reason have left this one alone."
This thing is a beast.
I'm in...target 100 in a month
"Green again on a very, very bad day."
When is earnings???
NOVT is up 5.26% to 55.00
"Wow, still pumping this one even with weak pre-announcement from COHR. Very interesting."
"""The company delivered excellent results in the first quarter, with better than expected revenue growth and Adjusted EPS,” said Matthijs Glastra, Chief Executive Officer of Novanta. “Revenue growth was 7% driven by robust medical end-markets. Overall, we are pleased with our performance""OH,,,,,, SO THAT WILL BE WHY THE WS SPIVS HAVE TAKEN IT DOWN 10% THEN; YOU HAVE EXCELLENT RESULTS AND 10% OF YOUR COMPANY'S VALUE [MC] DISAPPEARS - WELL THAT MAKES SENSE - DOES IT ""NOT""......."
"oc, my take on the subject and if you recall I think you started to look at the company after one of my posts on the COHR blog, so I do know a little bit about the company which I originally invested in right after the debacle called the dot com bubble. At the time it was called GSI Lumonics, which was a combination of two of the companies that were acquired/merged. The company was a Canadian based company at the time and traded on the Toronto exchange as well as the NASDAQ if I recall correctly as GSI and later changed to GSIG after a major departure from focusing on the laser sector and acquiring companies that were more associated with motion controls. If I recall correctly I think they even bought a precision ball bearing manufacturer. These moves actually hurt the company initially as investors saw them going away from the laser side of the business. Their laser segment was almost entirely focused on the fabrication yields for semi-con industry. I sold in the late 2000s, I think about a year before the housing bubble and really lost track of the company. My background is electrical engineering and we did use CO2 lasers and even YAG lasers for metal working associated with CNC equipment in the heavy manufacturing arena. Though I had limited exposure to the types of lasers used for semi-con which were usually much lower power yet much more detailed in their control systems. I did come across a few General Scanning lasers in my career but never worked with them. With all that said, I had lost track of the company for several years so things have obviously changed and also for the good as if I recall correctly when I finally sold GSIG, I did so for 15.75 a share, while I did make a few bucks as I think I had bought 500 shares for about 12 dollars a share, the fact that i held them for about seven years means I didn't even keep up with inflation. Obviously in the interim it appears that they have done an admirable job of bringing all of the diverse pieces together to enter the medical laser industry pretty heavily. I assume these are used for laser surgeries to include LASIK type eye sight correction surgery. I find it rather amazing that given this sector and the publicity of the procedures that more people do not follow this stock, the lack of volumes really cause me to question the overall movements in this stock. If I recall correctly the stock sometimes traded a half a million shares on a good day, though average volumes were closer to 50K a day, now remember this was in the day when a retail investor had to pay several hundreds of dollars to buy and sell a stock. Given that we can trade a stock for ten bucks (buy and sell for 4.95) it still defies logic this doesn't illicit more volumes if it is really that well regarded of a company. As I have said to you on many occasions, I still see this as a shell game or something, I don't really understand it. It continues to climb meanwhile the rest of the tech sector and the laser sectors crashed, it didn't. I don't think it ever went under a P/E of 50. I tried to research it a bit with limited success. I am a bit surprised though that others didn't answer your post."
Novanta reached an all time high at 171.46
Novanta reached a 52 Week high at 103.36
"Seven months ago, all the way back in July 2018, when I made my buy in to NOVT, I exited 100% of my position from STMP to pay for NOVT. Yesterday STMP dumped ALMOST 50% when they announced they were cutting off from USPS. IS THAT KARMA OR WHAT!!!??? I'm taking it as an omen of the highest rank! Talk about dodging a massive bullet, and coming up roses."
"oc, been monitoring a couple of other stocks more closely, sorry fell off radar. Dude, it is just too high for me, like you asked, what is driving this thing?"
"ESIO got bought out, really wasn't expecting that one, wonder whether the deal goes to fruition after MKS finishes their due diligence period, still think they cook their books."
"oc, to be honest with you, I thought that NOVT would have tanked to put its P/E back more in line with the likes of II-IV, IPGP and COHR, who are anywhere from 18 to 30, which is half of Novanta's. So overall you are holding pretty good to be even. Good luck with earnings, could be one wild ride with the mid terms and also COHR reporting as well, though they already pre-announced, we know what can still happen, looking at IPGP earnings after pre-announcing."
