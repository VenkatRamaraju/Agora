oh well. guess I have to buy more. Isn't Qorvo one of KEYS' customers? They seem to have had done well today. Any comments?
In time heading to 100s BLOW OUT EARNINGS AND GUIDANCESoftware becoming big part of business.
"log on to the company's website and investors section, watch the presentions videos , they are longish, prepare to use your braincells,and Q and A they did showing their products , their research, the gross profit margins, their growth in software subscriptions. Best of all was the knowledge of the directors, amazing highly educated people. ."
"All 5G stocks down big time for the day, will rebound soon, obviously 5G is not going anywhere, it's the future."
This company is quietly doing everything right.
"Can someone interpret the report? It seems like a Beat, but at least compared to Zachs prediction misses the earning per share. Or i am overlooking it..."
why KEYS is dropping so bad today?
WOW!!!!750 million dollar share buyback??????
So I decided to buy $50K. Adding in but about $20k thus far. Curious to see what others think. No hype - I just think there's a future hear among 5G stocks i researched. Your thoughts??
"Since the market knows Keysight is directly effected by issues with China, it's virtually impossible for this company to provide honest, accurate guidance going forward. Any guidance with most software companies now will be speculating on the part of the company, accordingly I doubt this big move in after hours will be sustainable by tomorrow."
"Aha - SWKS is a supplier and now has some competition from QCOM, that explains some of the drop in KEYS, SWKS, QRVO, and UBNT. Competition."
What a beautiful chart!!!!
$mfgp 4% drop in revenue def doesn't justify 15% drop in price. Loaded up. $dxc $hpe $keys
the 90s probably tomorrow and upward go next week. I added another hundred shares today on the pullback.
Will be going to cross 85 tomorrow
Well done KEYS!!!!
I bought this stock in August just for a trade but the stock has acted so well over the last three months it has never given me a reason to sell. As a matter of fact I may have to add to my position once it breaks above 120 again.
Looks like a little distribution day today. I can't blame anyone for taking a profit I'm not because I still think there is more in this one.
Double TOP just formed on KEYS. Didn't like the XLNX earnings. Look for downside on KEYS to at least 50 day average. Sold my small position a few minutes ago. Good Luck if you still own this puppy!!!
New price target $127 given 6 hrs ago by Susquehanna... smarteranalyst .com Also on thefly a new PT was set at $120
"This company was in the business news today. First I’ve heard of it, small cap but “Fang” , interesting!"
"The issues with the Huawei ban were not addressed on the call, which means to me they still exist. KEYS does about 18% of their revenue in China, so I'm still wondering how they're able to provide any substantive guidance."
"This company just keeps adding great new products in all the right industries. Data Center, EV, 5G. This recent consolidation is just coiling the spring again. GLTA"
"KEYS has been on fire, since it broke above its IPO base of $35. At 19 times fwd earnings shares seem to be reasonably priced as I think they have the potential to grow earnings at a double digit rate over the next several years. Margin expansion should also happen during this time-frame."
Hope shareholders took HEED of the Double Top I warned about yesterday. Now look at the big drop in the stock since then (from about 91 down to 85 and change). Those double tops are MEAN to those who are long!!
Stock definitely going to $110 on Monday. People will wake up and realize the insanity.
"Good entry point is about 90-95/share. should get there by end of December, if we have a December in the market like last year, first 2 days of Dec. indicating bad December, again."
This is a perfect example of an under the radar stock. It's never going to be a high flyer but man you can sleep well owning this company.
"I think today's drop is a reaction to the Xilinx and Intel news and stock price drops today and yesterday.An additional big factor is that Anritsu stock in Japan sold off 12.77% yesterday after announcing earnings. I suspect the sell-off was partly due to the fact that the Japan Stock market is closed for holidays in the coming week.On the other hand, we have the good news of Qualcomm and Apple in agreement for Qualcomm to supply 5G chips.Anyway, the overall feeling right now may be that there is some uncertainty as to the effect on the 5G rollout schedule; hence the hit on KEYS. 5G is going to happen, so I am holding KEYS long. Will add once the situation settles down."
Louis Navellier is pumping this stock again as he did last May and it is absolutely a 5G stock.
Crushed earnings and gave good guidance. The company has a real function to play in the introduction of 5G as well. I remain a buyer.
2020 is the year 5G goes mainstream. Apple will be releasing 5G phones and this stock will be a double in 2020.Get in now!
"Several knuckle heads on this board that apparently don't know that there is a global pandemic underway. KEYS is one of the best 5G plays that there is, stock is now only about 5% off its all-time high. Smart money is holding on to KEYS and buying more on any short-term weakness."
Will see 57-59 tomorrow. Awesome report and huge gain
Price Target raised today by an analyst.
"Just jumped in @ $84, great chart, definitely in an uptrend, major accumulation going on. Obviously one of the top 5G plays."
"The market might react a little too much to the Q1 2020 headwind so brace for it to stand still for a moment, but i still feel like this was a great quarter, great sales, great cashflow. This stock should, ideally, should move some to the upside tommorow... maybe $110... deserves $115 in my opinion tho. But if the market focuses too much on the future headwind then that might not happen"
"That's great news, but has anyone heard how they guided, esp. whether they expect an impact on their supply chains and their earnings next quarter as a result of the coronavirus?"
"Manipulation, Keys top stock for 2020-2021 5G buildout absolute BUY"
