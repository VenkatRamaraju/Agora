Lotsa room to run from hereGo Keys!!!
quality stocks always win
Missed but it does not matter anymore in this market melt up ... Bad news is good news ... Good guidance assurance though
Nice little pop!!!Could this puppy make its move now???
Didn't somebody say yesterday that KEYS is to be downgraded in an August edition of some analyst? The stock has acted funny of late and I have to wonder if it's being shorted. It's recovered nicely the last couple of trading sessions.
"damn, if i wanted to loose money this fast i should have went to vegas"
Crushed earnings and gave good guidance. The company has a real function to play in the introduction of 5G as well. I remain a buyer.
Looking at the chart MFI and MACD continues to fall. This DOES NOT bode well for the stock going forward. RSI now below 50 which is also a big negative.
This is the worse reaction on earnings report compared to previous quarters.
Made visit to 79s another new high-can taste 80s

"Let’s see what they have to say about the guidance on the call...in this market, it’s definitely about guidance"
"Here is a e-mail report, released by NOVA-X Reports yesterday. It speaks of Keysight Tech. (KEYS), in a Positive Note. This will hopefully cause KEYS shareholders, to see their stock ""Pop""?!?I'm not a shareholder myself...not yet, but Good Luck to all!Wednesday, March 17, 2021Why Keysight Has So Many Great Shots on GoalBy Michael A. RobinsonIf you've followed along with me for even a short time, you already know that I'm always on the hunt for the Next Big Thing... often years ahead of the so-called in-crowd on Wall Street. That's why I first began talking about cryptocurrencies back in October 2013, when Bitcoin was trading at just $338.I also recommended 30 cannabis stocks back in the fall of 2016. All went on to make money, several of them with triple-digit gains. And even today, I'm telling you that there's another cutting-edge tech-project that hasn't even hit the public market yet, that could double your money in just eight months, and multiply it by 10 in under four years.Now, you can see exactly how to get in on this groundbreaking opportunity, and others with similar potential to multiply your initial investment by 10 by clicking right here. My desire to stay a step ahead of the pack has already led to our recent investment in Keysight Technologies Inc. (KEYS). It's an under-the-radar play on the whole back end of the rapid build-out of the 5G ecosystem.See, Keysight provides testing services for the wireless sector, among other industries. And there's plenty of stuff to be tested.As I mentioned at the time, in 2020 telecom equipment maker Ericsson had originally forecast 190 million global subscriptions to 5G by the end of 2020.On November 30 that year, the firm upped the estimate to 220 million, an increase of 15%. And it sees even faster growth in 2021 as the pandemic wanes and the rollout hits its stride across all global carriers and handset makers. What I didn't mention at the time is just how hard Keysight works to have the next-gen breakthroughs that open up new avenues of growth.For example, while the world is still rolling out 5G, Keysight is already hard at work developing the next wireless broadband standard - 6G. The firm expects this next-gen standard to offer download speeds of 1 terabit per second and a latency of just 1 micro-second.For comparison, that's orders of magnitudes faster than even high-priced residential cable Internet connections today. Keysight is already testing equipment and technologies on its 6G testbed and helps customers set up their own testbeds.Or take quantum technology, which is in its beginning stages and promises to unlock a whole new way to computation. The physics of these new kinds of computers are very complicated and sensitive, so current experimental models are still limited. But firms are making rapid progress, and quantum computing will soon let us unlock new advances in biotech, materials science, AI, and much more.Keysight is working to make this happen by building extremely precise and flexible, purpose-built chips to generate and decode the signals needed to input and extract information from quantum computers.That puts it years ahead of most competitors.But even our regular, ""classical"" computers are hitting the limits. The huge growth in Internet traffic over the last decade, only sped up by the Covid-led increase in video streaming, gaming, video calls, online work, and home education is pushing current network technologies to the brink.See, the connections to cloud data centers, as well as those between individual servers within data centers, were for the longest time stuck at 100Gb/s speeds.That was fine, but as data traffic exploded, the industry was caught somewhat flat-footed. It's now in the middle of an upgrade to 400Gb/s transceivers to enable the current demands for computing speeds and data transfer performance.But data traffic keeps growing, and 400G will soon be too slow. That's why Keysight is already working on developing and testing the hardware solutions needed to move to 800Gb/s speeds.More than just a doubling in speed, at 800Gb/s the transceivers are reaching the fundamental physical limits of silicon technology. So, design margins are minuscule, requiring more accurate and reliable testing equipment than ever.That's where Keysight comes it. At every point, from development to manufacturing, the firm already offers testing hardware to help clients get to the 800 Gb/s level fast.This puts Keysight way out front of the industry.The firm is also a strong earnings performer. Even though earnings were down a little in the December quarter, Keysight still has a run rate of 27% a year, meaning they double their earnings in just 2.6 years.Right now, we're up about 5%. But with so many shots on goal, I do see plenty of upside ahead. Be sure to keep a lowball limit order in place for the second half at $105.25.Cheers and good investing, Michael A. Robinson"
Should be another up day tomorrow
Profit taking today.
5G just getting started watch and learn!
why KEYS is dropping so bad today?
Hope shareholders took HEED of the Double Top I warned about yesterday. Now look at the big drop in the stock since then (from about 91 down to 85 and change). Those double tops are MEAN to those who are long!!
Keysight reached an all time high at 142.64
WOW!!!!750 million dollar share buyback??????
$200 by years end!!
Like I said this will hit $110
does anybody have a clue why the big drop of $6.48 I can't find ant negative news?
KEYS reached a new All Time High at 47.38
Sold 87 took a little loss on this trip want to protect my profits from previous buy.If it pulls back high 70s low 80s will return.
Highest close since the middle of June. Nice trend just need a good volume up day get this one moving.
Go KEYS go!! Beautiful chart!!! $200 coming fast!!
Is there a possibility for this stock to give dividends?
"Manipulation, Keys top stock for 2020-2021 5G buildout absolute BUY"
"50 billions connected devices 2030,21 billion 2025. all needing 5g where KEYS comes in."
They had some interesting insights about KEYS on http://tradenow.xyz. Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Aha - SWKS is a supplier and now has some competition from QCOM, that explains some of the drop in KEYS, SWKS, QRVO, and UBNT. Competition."
"And up we go, 5G underway"
CEO sold shares but SP is still holding up well...
"The issues with the Huawei ban were not addressed on the call, which means to me they still exist. KEYS does about 18% of their revenue in China, so I'm still wondering how they're able to provide any substantive guidance."
this is starting to look tempting before earnings.
Yes! Go flying KEYS!!
KEYS is down 6.88% to 80.08
Keysight has a bright future ahead of it..... I'll buy additional shares if it should drop into the 80s price range.
Does this mean that 5G has been cancelled?
"I think today's drop is a reaction to the Xilinx and Intel news and stock price drops today and yesterday.An additional big factor is that Anritsu stock in Japan sold off 12.77% yesterday after announcing earnings. I suspect the sell-off was partly due to the fact that the Japan Stock market is closed for holidays in the coming week.On the other hand, we have the good news of Qualcomm and Apple in agreement for Qualcomm to supply 5G chips.Anyway, the overall feeling right now may be that there is some uncertainty as to the effect on the 5G rollout schedule; hence the hit on KEYS. 5G is going to happen, so I am holding KEYS long. Will add once the situation settles down."
110 easy by end of year. Prayer sent.
So it hit the 90-95 range that I suspected it was going to 2months ago.Time to buy.
WILL HIT 80'S TODAY. MULTIPLE DOWNGRADES OUT ALREADY. I WILL COVER THERE AND MOVE ON. EASY MONEY MADE ON YOU LONGS.
any idea about holding this stock or selling today?
Best ask all night was around 110. Best ask right now is 115. I cant say itll go that high today but i feel like its headed in that direction. Good Quarter!
What a beautiful chart!!!!
what is going on here? down 7 percent pre-market?
KEYS is up 14.77% to 69.37
KEYS reached an all time high at 107.17
I sold one thousand shares @ 109 on Thursday following earnings released. What transpired between Thursday and Friday morning that leads to the flood gate door damage?
"Goldman Sachs rated as Buy, with a $120 PT. I'm excited for upcoming ER"
Bogus!!
"Something l;ike1 or 2 weeks ago this stock drop[s over 10% in one day, now back up 11% in one day. Some traders made a bundle on this one selling short and then rebuying"
KEYS: Get ready for BIG move up like QCOM 5G 6G stuff earning so far all good for 5G companies QCOM SWKS...
KEYS reached a new All Time High at 48.75
$90 it is!
"KEYS is almost at its 52 week high of $ 86.01. If it breaks through this number, the stock price will move to $ 88.00 per share by Monday, March 4, 2019!!!"
What's a good price to get in at here?
totally disappointed in keys since earnings
KEYS is up 6.46% to 86.41
Something is not right with earnings report. possibility of breaking 94 next week is very likely.I won't touch this at the moment until clarity.
https://edition.cnn.com/2019/02/28/tech/5g-benefits-mobile-world-congress/index.html
Backing up the truck today.Fill me up.
KEYS reached an all time high at 95.47
KEYS is up 4.92% to 94.23
KEYS is down 4.93% to $58.57
Textbook cup and handle. This is going higher.
keys is very disappointing to me its sp is barely up 3 points after a week of a good earnings report. everyday it opens and goes up and then goes down not good price action and barely making any headway I expected this to be $90 by now
Price being held down...Some institution must be unwinding a portion of their position
KEYS is up 6.53% to $57.90
So when will keys cross over 100 again? Any predictions?
GUIDANCE WEAK WILL GO TO 80 NOW.
"Zacks rank 2, let's go!"
It’s a very nice beat guys tomorrow 115$
when are we reporting earnings and what's the Outlook
"Since the market knows Keysight is directly effected by issues with China, it's virtually impossible for this company to provide honest, accurate guidance going forward. Any guidance with most software companies now will be speculating on the part of the company, accordingly I doubt this big move in after hours will be sustainable by tomorrow."
this company also is investing in 6g they are well ahead in their thinking
"KEYS is a dead stock, no higher than a year ago."
New high-new closing high----------24 HRS Will know
Anyone interested in KEYS should also look at >>>CREE<<< I'm loaded with XLNX already and added CREE recently.
SELL SHORT NOW
"this stock has been basing for the last several days after coming down cyclically as expected forward earnings numbers, and now it's going to cycle back up into the mid or high 80s later this week or early part of next week. It's holding its baseline support at the lowest level... very nice development...so be very patient!. Yesterday I added a thousand shares to my previous day's purchase of the same amount."
KEYS reached an all time high at 92.94
Will see 57-59 tomorrow. Awesome report and huge gain
KEYS is down 4.91% to 91.49
Starting to feel like you’re getting the quarter for free and their guidance was inclusive of their estimated coronavirus impact
Keys keeps growing!! $175 before years end!!!
"Several knuckle heads on this board that apparently don't know that there is a global pandemic underway. KEYS is one of the best 5G plays that there is, stock is now only about 5% off its all-time high. Smart money is holding on to KEYS and buying more on any short-term weakness."
Resting stage-will build new base-nothing much until next earnings.
Death Cross...I just bought today and thought it would hold above 200 mda
KEYS: retry to take out 102.50if success 105-107 by friday
Great quarter. Actually I'm surprised.
SOS
Does this stock have anything to do with the internet of things and 5G?
KEYS is up 5.78% to 87.12
KEYS reached a new All Time High at 53.87
Are we up or down?
"Stocks are strange. This stock, usually my biggest laggard, is the ONLY one that's green today in a sea of red. Go figure."
Getting painful. Buyers strike!
"profit taking, plus new neutral rating, stock has become pricey"
This is a perfect example of an under the radar stock. It's never going to be a high flyer but man you can sleep well owning this company.
KEYS is down 8.22% to 86.45
KEYS is up 5.96% to 94.45
KEYS reached an all time high at 79.71
So much hype on this stock. $85 is waaaay over priced. easy for day trading due to all the super-hype.
Held well AE needs analyst to give price TGT 110-120 before it can run-basing for now.
Red again
"What's going on? On good news, why are stocks such as KEYS, SWKS, QRVO, and UBNT down today? Only XLNX and QCOM are up. Just wondering - did I miss something?"
Stock definitely going to $110 on Monday. People will wake up and realize the insanity.
"Can someone interpret the report? It seems like a Beat, but at least compared to Zachs prediction misses the earning per share. Or i am overlooking it..."
The neutral rating following good earnings just killed the stock for now.
Another high-nice day.
"As $AAPL buyout $INTC 5G modem for iPhones watch $ISNG and $NOK rocket same as $KEYS and $ADI , 5G should explode soon HOT"

This stock is showing some strength the last few days albeit on low volume. If it can hold up okay in today's soon to be carnage I'll be happy.
i bought a option for a quick flip and it keeps going way pass my break even price and i own it until jan 15 i want to excercise to keep it now but i dont have enough money to buy it. great company and its undervalued.

Increase in shorts according to Yahoo finance! Below 200& 50 moving average! Coronavirus? Market faltering..... why buy this now? Wouldn’t it be better to buy at a much lower price ? Thoughts anyone?
Don't drop now-80s here-Feb 21 reports
Keysight reached an all time high at 126.18
Closing RED
Options expiration is another reason for the price action.
"What percentage could this stock grow to in 2025? 500, 1,000 ,10,000, 20,000 percent?"
What happened?
"Stock broke all support on the way down with more than 3 times average daily volume. This is some serious dumping by the big boys. I read through the earning transcript but didn’t find any red flags, may be except Huwai issue. There must be something management is hiding...."
KEYS is up 6.67% to 83.50
Nice and steady towards 100s.
Ugh I’m getting hammered!! Wish I had seen this post first.
A possible stock split in the future?
volume isn't good doesn't make since this sp should be going a lot higher on strong volume
Something is not right with Keys...never seen it like this before
SOLD OUT at 108.45 after a super run....just pulling some cash off holdings in prep for 2020. Good luck to all who still hold it... Boolean
Price Target raised today by an analyst.
Time to get som action on these boards. Long.
Gee...a deserted board...I guess KEYS doesn’t attract much attention ...
Need analyst TGT'S raised.
"its set for $91-93 before it rebounds.Manipulation at its best. NVDA reserved and bounced, KEYS wont. KEYS has small float that's easy to manipulate."
impressive quarter and a buyback!

Looks like a little distribution day today. I can't blame anyone for taking a profit I'm not because I still think there is more in this one.
So many positive catalysts that will grow revenue!!! Beautiful job!!!
Time to buy now
here comes a hundred again. 101 today
KEYS reached an all time high at 103.03
look at January 23rd and 22nd... same two days down but not breaking below support or very much and then it jumps up. today's set up is just like that one and it's getting ready to jump up into the high 80s.
Will be going to cross 85 tomorrow
don't get it.
I don’t understand why isn’t it increasing?
Would like to see it up Monday
"Why the hard selloff today with heavier than usual volume? I am clueless, long at 105 with 2K shares , now it’s depressing. Crazy move today"
Is this just another over hyped 5 G stock! Why should I consider purchasing ? Thoughts anyone?

back to 90
Next stop is ~$180.
Love the action!! Looking forward to earnings!! New high on its way!!!
"There's talk in Washington of spending big on infrastructure, including for high speed 5G. I believe this is why KEYS is up roughly 4.5% today. Of course, it's been due for a rebound as the stock has drifted lower with the Nasdaq in recent weeks. At least today it regained some momentum."
I bought this stock in August just for a trade but the stock has acted so well over the last three months it has never given me a reason to sell. As a matter of fact I may have to add to my position once it breaks above 120 again.
At what time will earnings come out?
Keysight is up 7.81% to 103.50
"Here we are down to 82 and change, quite a move down from that Double Top at 93 and change several weeks ago. Never fight a double top people, NEVER!!"
Is KEYS likewise a good buy here?
didnt see this coming
KEYS is down 6.59% to 85.75
This stock is a joy to watch.
I bought at 83.00 This stock has and will move much higher!!! Watch and see!!!!!!

The DOW and NASDAQ are rallying into the close!!! Great comments by Powell!!!
Perfect set up for another 10% run. Market is in an uptrend and KEYS is coming along for the ride.
This stock has acted really well the last six weeks or so. Let's see the reaction to good earnings.
Keysight reached an all time high at 135.37
"KEYS has been on fire, since it broke above its IPO base of $35. At 19 times fwd earnings shares seem to be reasonably priced as I think they have the potential to grow earnings at a double digit rate over the next several years. Margin expansion should also happen during this time-frame."
It's mainly falling because of Huawei but it's growing fast in other regions including government sector. I'm expecting it to touch $96 by end of this week and then rebound to $100 within next 1-2 weeks and then grow steadily.
Let the profit takers sell. I will buy more KEYS!!!
KEYS for surer 100s before 5-28
"All 5G stocks down big time for the day, will rebound soon, obviously 5G is not going anywhere, it's the future."

New high on a DOWN day closed in 90s-100s written all over it.
oh well. guess I have to buy more. Isn't Qorvo one of KEYS' customers? They seem to have had done well today. Any comments?
Double TOP just formed on KEYS. Didn't like the XLNX earnings. Look for downside on KEYS to at least 50 day average. Sold my small position a few minutes ago. Good Luck if you still own this puppy!!!
"Look at how vicious this correction from the lower 90s has been!! They are down today like they just missed earnings. Of course, it was due to a downgrade due to Huwaei!!"
Can any one explain why stock is moving down?
Analyst upgraded to outperform
Earnings today on this. Meant to be an earnings beat
"Good earnings, not great but enough to keep this one headed in the right direction."

"The market might react a little too much to the Q1 2020 headwind so brace for it to stand still for a moment, but i still feel like this was a great quarter, great sales, great cashflow. This stock should, ideally, should move some to the upside tommorow... maybe $110... deserves $115 in my opinion tho. But if the market focuses too much on the future headwind then that might not happen"

"This company just keeps adding great new products in all the right industries. Data Center, EV, 5G. This recent consolidation is just coiling the spring again. GLTA"
This one will fly up on Monday.
KEYS IS STARTING TO RALLY AGAIN!!!
Having another nice day-new high- earnings 2-21 I see 80s coming.
Keys holding tough!!! Very positive!!!
"Okay, heard about how KEYS is part of the 5G infrastructure. Just picked up a few shares in the low 92s. Anyone know if they are the leader in this field, one of the leaders, etc??"
"Just jumped in @ $84, great chart, definitely in an uptrend, major accumulation going on. Obviously one of the top 5G plays."
Any thoughts on buying the 10/18 105 calls. Thanks in advance~☆
