"Great news from Liberty. Revenue and cash flow rose 20% and 45% respectively from prior year results.Most importantly, cash flow was up 45% from a year ago. Also annual operating loss fell 86% , yes 86%, to 24 Million. Liberty will be profitable for 2019 and this will signal increasing growth and profitability in the next two years. They have also repair the network in Puerto Rico and had their biggest subscription rate (31,000) for the past quarter in 15 years. This will be a possible double in two to three years."

"According to the 7 industry analysts covering Liberty Latin America, the consensus is that breakeven is near. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2021, before turning a profit of US$89m in 2022."
"Liberty Latin America's stock has been crushed by the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the underlying business is still producing positive cash flow. The company recently completed the acquisition of AT&T's Puerto Rican assets at what appear to be fire-sale prices. The company has a large and very-difficult-to-replicate infrastructure of subsea fiber and cable lines that will provide an enduring advantage for a long time to come. With the accretive AT&T acquisition and a rebound that is sure to follow in its key markets, the stock is at least 60% undervalued currently."
