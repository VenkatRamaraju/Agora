"CEO bought 11,500 more shares yesterday, whatever that means. Probably that he stands by his work. Maybe something good to come?"
"Liberty Latin America's stock has been crushed by the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the underlying business is still producing positive cash flow. The company recently completed the acquisition of AT&T's Puerto Rican assets at what appear to be fire-sale prices. The company has a large and very-difficult-to-replicate infrastructure of subsea fiber and cable lines that will provide an enduring advantage for a long time to come. With the accretive AT&T acquisition and a rebound that is sure to follow in its key markets, the stock is at least 60% undervalued currently."
