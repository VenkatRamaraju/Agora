"I expect $HIIQ to grow faster than $HUM. If HUM can increase guidance, so can $HIIQ!"
My guess for 04/29/20 - substantial earnings beat opens at $390
"While I think of $HIIQ as a cloud based technology platform company, they also utilize TV and have football legend Joe Namathon TV commercials helping get people covered. Similar to $HUM commercial. I cant recall seeing a commercial for $EHTH...What I find interesting about this commercial is that people remember it.Interesting CEO said they have more leads than they can handle."
Lots of upside here. Been building a position.
"Next stop is $475, then on to $500.Let's go Comrades. Federal Gov't wants to expand Medicare/Medicaid until it bankrupts the whole country."
$HUM Initiates Coverage On SVB Leerink Outperform USD 494
"Looks like it will be a sluggish day, but to anyone whose here, $CVS is still - down 5.92% YTD ($CI up 13.95% YTD, $UNH up 36.57% YTD, $HUM up $34.22% YTD, $ANTM up 15.24% YTD)- CVS has the lowest PE ratio of all healthcare stocks of 10x to 12x- Coming off consecutive great quarters and going to finish with a great year- new CEO - heavily involved in Vaccine administrationPrice should be ($5.45 EPS ex $2 Div times 18 to 20 times) = $100For those that believe in $CVS, please hold your position and let's make today a good day.Honestly everything else ... energy stock weed stock tech stocks are already overpriced... investors need to recognize the value here and keep $CVS going up today."
"Beats estimate, raised guidance, and yet falling down."
People Medicare for all isn’t going to happen. Period. It would end the is economy for one. And Warren Will never when a general election. She is medicate for all now when it’s primary. Trust me she will never when by taken peoples healthcare away
"Be aware control of the Senate by Dems, and the threat it poses to managed care companies, is causing the stocks to sell off. A sell off that began shortly after the special elections in GA."
"CLOV is ripe for the picking. It's way undervalued when you compaire it to $UNH, $CI, & $HUM. Look at the valuations. This is a good buy at this price."
"Not a lot of reactions on HUM. Starting next week a lot of money can be made on this. Forget about Semis, Software, Tele Equip etc. The second half of the year will be consumer staples which healthcare is a part of. In the money calls can be very profitable on HUM. I am not recommending this for anyone else , but I am looking at the 445 call on next weeks weekly options."
"Sell volume seems like it is starting to slow down. Another dip under $229, might be good time to start position. Thoughts?"
"Seniors be careful. HUM cancelled my lower cost Walmart Medicare PDP plan for 2019 and by default placed me in its highest cost Humana Premium plan for 2020. They did notify of the change, but the premium increase is buried within the notification several pages in. As a result, HUM will pocket about an extra $500 in 2020 based on my prescriptions. Suppose that is good for shareholders but bad for me."
"What do 5 star ratings do? Make us longs money!!!! Enroll all year long, better benefits, lower OOP max, etc.2022 huge year in South. look out 500."
"This market manipulation is absurd. The volatility in this sector screams insider trading!I have presented some very interesting evidence to the SEC.Let's see if they turn a blind eye, as they did in the Madoff case. They were warned for a decade of Madoff's ponzi scheme. They ignored it, and they allowed the fraud to grow exponentially."
"Wish I had some money freed up. Once RSI and volume reserve trend, this will easily go up $40 a share."
"If it keeps going up tomorrow, I will be convinced that HUM is finally getting out of its slump. If you look at the Daily Chart, everytime the last time it hit 258/259 in April, it would start sliding again. We are not out the woods yet....a Bullish move above 260 is needed for me to be convinced things are turning around."
"Big jump this am. That's what 5 star ratings do. Enroll all year long, better benefits, lower OOP max, etc.2022 big year in South. look out 500."
Goldman Sachs gave HUM a ‘conviction buy’ rating
