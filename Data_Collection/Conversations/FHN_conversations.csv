The California ports will not be successful in trucking out the cargos of the hundreds of ships at anchor. The regulations are against owner operator truck drivers because they are non union. Blocks against them have been set up in numerous ways. If Florida doesn't change they present the same problems.
Odd trend: Since early August the DPST (representing regional banks) has trended down as the TEN year bond rate trended up. Logically they should follow the same trendline. Any guess why?
"If you’re a day trader, you should definitely check out (http://Pick-stocks.com). They send a watchlist covering the top pre-market movers every day before the open. It’s a great way to pick out potential trades for the day."
Just added again. One of these days it’s going to pay off!
"figures, beat on the earnings report and the stock goes down, got to love Wall Street!"
Why is this not $20?
Adjusted EPS of 50 cents.
Nice week! Up .60 cents! That $14.80 purchase a few days ago is looking good! Jacob… you missed your opportunity on the day you said “not yet”. It was the day to buy!
Horrible ADP jobs report means the Friday unemployment number will be horrible (unless Feds fake the numbers).
"Really, no love for this on the street, maybe some bad news like rogue trading, or selling sensitive information might get the stock price up....?"
Most of the other banks are up nicely today! Not sure why we are not participating?
"it's always one step forward, and two steps back with FHN"
FHN has been slowly but surly moving up hill again.....hold on...good times a head......IMO
Not into conspiracy theories but isn't it perfect timing for Powell to force his Fed Directors to sell all their stock holdings just before a possible correction?
Massive increase in share repurchase.....from 227 million to 727 million.....the street will like it........
"Why has Argus continued for a year to grind against FHN, now down to a target of only $16?"
They need to raise their dividend for this upcoming quarter. 0.19/share and no less imo.
"Recovery with FHN coincides with a massive bounce of the 10 year bond partly the result of the Feds deciding not to end (taper off) bond buying just yet along with the promise of rate hikes in next two years. Someone else already mentioned that.Despite Hurricane Ida, I still believe a dividend increase is in the cards for 2022."
"Wasn't that long ago that a so called Woman Expert was on CNBC saying to sell the banks and buy companies like Visa and Mastercard. Looking at the 5 days or so and Visa and Mastercsrd have taken a plunge while banking sector is on a tear, solid upward run.This is why you can't trust experts."
Nice recovery last two days for FHN! Props to anyone who added when it dipped to the 14s.
"10-YR Bond closing in on 1.70 already.I am getting the George Burns, ""I want to be 18 again"" song at the ready."
If FHN bought back 9 million shares every quarter on average then they would be buying back the entire outstanding share count in just over 15 years.
Here it is!
"buy, buy, buy! anything under $19 is a bargain."
Banks have been out of favor for quite a while now....it will turn around soon I hope....a rise in interest rates would be a heavenly thing but may be a while....FHN is solid and IMO one to keep hold of.....took a long time for it to break out of the 17's then I thought it was going to charge through 20......it will happen again....give it time.........
FHN priced at $15.56 has cash minus debt equal to $20.82 a share.
Good buy signal is in place!
Price movement recovery is reflective of the 10 year bond recovery. I think we will finish very strong towards end of the year.
Here we go boys and girls! 10 year up over 1.50%! FHN up nicely in pre market! Giddy Up!
"Ok. 9 million shares repurchased this past quarter.I think eps and revenue is based on the adjusted, if so then this is a 9 cent EPS beat and roughly a 15 million beat on revenue versus Zacks estimates."
CFRA just gave FHN a buy reco with target of $22.
"This stock seems to be in the right spot right now. Coming off the merger with IberiaBank to create a major regional in the fast growing South East US, with the combination of what appears to be the gradual increase of interest rates, this bank is potentially primed for a significant increase. With book value at 13.59 and a reasonable multiple of 1.5 book, that puts a potential price of $20.39. That's a 27% increase from todays current price of $16.10. Even if we don't see such an increase this year, there's nothing wrong with sitting back and collecting the 3.76% dividend. And since I am fortunate to not need the income, I'm set up to buy more shares with the divy each quarter. We may look back a year or so and think $16 was cheap."
"Increase in share repurchase, but holding dividend at .15c for next dividend. Historically the dividend has been raised in Q1, I’m betting next year will be the same."
"With the PPI at 8.3% today, the CPI on Tuesday is going to be anything but ""transitory""............God Help Us"
Sticking with 11/5-6 for the taper. Unemployment number is the next nail.
Other banks talking dividend increases. I would prefer company buyback and stock appreciation versus potential 1 time dividend increase. Much rather see $20+ per share stock price. Long and strong on FHN.
Nice to see this coming up
"After a multi-day pullback, 10 year bond looks set this morning to begin again a rumbling towards 1.70."
Could we get a discussion going on what to expect on eps for Q3 and Q4? I'll start it off by sticking to my predictions from a month ago just to give us a base to begin. My logic is the merger has gone well and is adding value and earnings ahead of schedule and interest rates are trending up slowly but will begin to speed up.
What's considered long term hold for this stock? Been in for 7yr and really haven't made much at all. I also own Regions and it has performed a lot better over this period.
