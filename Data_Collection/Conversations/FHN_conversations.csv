"Going into 2021, the Graham value of FHN is $24.57. That doesn't include possible share buybacks."
"Massive runup from yesterday to $10 plus was due to the FED actions. One thing they did was cut mortgage rates. This is soeculated to mean that home owners may refinance their home loans to take advantage of the lower rates. The sell off afterwards due to the stock marlet index selloff. But, the story regarding the mortgage rates coming down is intact hence the runup reoccurs today."
Did everyone in here get their dividends?
10 year bond yield jumping today. Could reach 1.70+ soon. Banking stocks favorite dessert is the appreciating 10 year bond.
There isn't one single thing wrong with this security........time to buy if ya got the cash.......one of the top rated US Banks......hold on and look forward to the dividend..........
What's considered long term hold for this stock? Been in for 7yr and really haven't made much at all. I also own Regions and it has performed a lot better over this period.
Could this be the bank PNC is looking at to purchase? It’s certainly in the Sunbelt.
"Not sure I understand...Investors dumping Amazon for FHN. I guess Green is the sexiest color versus red now. Amazon is bleeding while the banking sector is climbing in anticipation of more favorable conditions in 2021. Even before the pandemic plague, the rates were causing banks to have lower PE multiples. A turnaround on rates coupled.with favorable federal policy if that happens and a recovered economy should justify higher PE multiples even in my opinion past historic PEs. Banking consolidation could theorrtically jistify higher PEs past historic averages. Current uptrend in this sector could be a lot of forward thinking on the part of Big money movers."
"Interesting article by Bruce Greenwald, a former prof at Columbia Univ., known for developing the Earnings Power Value metric, EPV. He calculates the FHN EPV to be $30.37."
Jefferies just put out a BUY reco on FHN. They are all lining up just before the Q3 eps report.
Lets open this for discussion on FHN: What sequence of announcements could be expected for FHN and other regional banks. My guesses are 4Q20 Release loan reserves1Q21 Raise dividend to $.72/year2Q21 Shares buyback planShould these happen the share price could be $20-$25.What are your thoughts on this?
"To get a possible look at where regional banks might go, take a look at DPST 's chart over several years back."
Dividend chasers will be coming in soon....
Glad I got ahead of this rally by accumulating lots of shares. Now have 1000. 1000 shares with dividend reinvestment.
Still a financially strong company in a growing market. Pays a decent dividend too. I'm sure many larger banks are taking a close look at FHN.
Almost at 1776. I expect everyone is now financially independant once this closes at $17.76 or higher.
"10 Year Yield back on the rise. Inflation Inflation is our friend. FHN up 1.55% premarket. Dividend arrives April Fool's Day, no pranking. Investing in regional banks was best idea I had in 2020."
"seems like a great time to get in, no?? yeah??"
That 16.52 purchase yesterday is looking good! Congrats to anyone that bought that dip. Now... Can we hold 17 and move towards busting through 18? This is now my largest holding! Still way under valued!
Wish a political party would take as their mission to help make as many millionaires as possible as fast as possible! Then there would be jobs and money enough for everything and everybody. Taking from one to give to another is not working very well.
Banking stocks like FHN should be soaring today. Bidenflation will force FEDs to raise interest rates.
"Gosh, I need help from Zacks. I am terrible at math. Is a .95eps an earnings beat versus .51eps expected for the full combined company? Is a 35.eps a beat on expectations versus the .21eps expected for the First Horizon Bank portion of the company without the merger related impacts to eps? Math is so hard.Zacks is so good at estimates or is my math off again?In all seriousness.... The revenue portion at first glance looks like a slight miss but even if was who cares? The CEO has done an amazing job keeping expenses down and I see the bank moving forward solidly. Going out years from now when interest rates go higher the earnings potential will be enormous. It already looks enormous.If the earnings picture we see in Q3 is what to expect period then I see the stock price headed back to $17 really quick here and we could see all time highs in less than 2 years."
Should announce common share dividend in the next couple of days. Keep your fingers crossed. Should get another boost if the same or better dividend.
Well looks like bank stocks are out of favor right now....but we should be getting close to a bottom....still I think this is a great buying opportunity....I will add more if it dips more this afternoon.
"Worth reading: ""5 Reasons the Rally in Bank Stocks is not over"" by Bram Berkowitz is well written and explains in depth why we all have been accumulating shares of the better banks all last year."
I couldn't resist adding some more during this pullback!
"Over 18 before this weekend, banking stocks poised for big gains this week."
"Sooooo thrilled to get the opportunity in premarlet to scoop up mlre shares below $9. Even at $10 and below this is a solid buy. Once COVID-19 is in the past as an issue, banking sector is goijg to be super hoy. They will be managing efforts with businesses getting back up and running and with everything else. The merger is interesting as it puts this bank in new areas for expansion...I really like this investment over other banks I looked at."
Share price has been going up nicely as of late. Perhaps earnings info is getting leaked out a little early.
she be going to 18 by tomorrow.
7 days ago Zacks posts article stating their consensus estimate EPS is 16 cents. This morning they post an article stating FHN missed their consensus estimate EPS of 21 cents. Huh????????? A little bait and switch with your coffee this morning Zacks-bots?
Nice fresh 2 1/2 year high this morning.
Watch DPST as it just gave a significant sell signal.
"After a week of very large after hours FHN trades, I believe the fed will approve dividend increases and buybacks. Taking larger positions."
Morgan Stanley raises price target to $15 from $12 with an equal weight rating.
I thought we would have gotten a lot bigger pop in the PPS after Cramer said he liked FHN the best in the smaller banking sector at noon on the Judge's show......but green is green so I'm a happy camper.......:)
I am curious if the short sellers have been targeting FHN. It has had a very very low short float....but I'd like to see if the reason for FHN ddopping to the 13s was due to a sudden increase in that shares sold float stat. I can not fathom how anyone can think $15 is too pricy for FHN so lets short it to $13. Since when has FHN had an above average P/E in the financial sector?
Raymond James boosts share price target for FHN from $17 to $21 and maintains Strong Buy opinion.
I guess were headed back down to beginning of the year $12-13 all those gains gone in a month tooo funny!
"Most banks down big today, but, this one is getting crushed for now. Should come back though."
Raymond James just put out a strong buy reco on FHN.
This upcoming Q1 report will be an IQ test for FHN and HBAN leadership. They have seen the market think up excuses to punish already reported banks with outstanding earnings. What none of those reporting stocks did was RAISE their dividends. Please FHN and HBAN management DON'T FAIL THIS IQ TEST!
Merrill Lynch just issued a BUY on FHN with a target of $21.
"Hedge fund, Archegos Capital. hurting big banks (MS, BAC, C, JPM, GS, WFC today. Stay calm."
I’m optimistic! Got 500 shares at 9.65 just holding until the news breaks out.
"Monday, price jumps on high volume."
Stock marlet correction incoming.... and I don't care as I am several years away from retirement. Plenty of time to ride this out and let the DRIP buy more shares of stock at reduced prices. Have all but 1 investment on DRIP.
"Still bullish, holding myself but could be a time to lower average sale."
We will rock going forward! Great earnings and sure seems like the economy is going to explode June- the end of the year! Wish I would have bought more with that last dip! GLTAL!
"I'm loving the 1,300 I got at $9.48! I'm riding this into retirement income bliss.I picked up 1,500 of FBN at $7.17 (closed at $11.25) or I would have picked up more."
Janice buy now. This is a temp pullback becuz of lower interest rates affected all bank stocks. Their regional growth story is compelling and Merrill Lynch has a target of $23. So over 3% dividend and some upside potential with very little downside risk and you should learn how to sell covered calls against it as well to generate extra income.
"Why has Argus continued for a year to grind against FHN, now down to a target of only $16?"
Nice to see this coming up
"Can't wait for the sellers to sell off the market so much that buying shares of any company is free of charge. Want 10 million shares of Amazon? Sure, that will be $0 and 00 cents."
Looks like we may just take a run at 18 again.........:) trading strong........
"FHN Should be announcing their Q1 dividend in the next couple of weeks (they generally announce about 6 weeks before the Ex-date). I believe, based upon several years of historical precedent and a VERY solid earning announcement, that they will be increasing the dividend. The real question is by how much? Gong to .64 is a 6.7% increase and is probably the safe bet. This is obviously just my opinion, but I believe it is a safe bet."
Bought more at $15.
To 15 by next Q report!!!
blue oyster loves anacott steel
Nice recovery last two days for FHN! Props to anyone who added when it dipped to the 14s.
"Wasn't that long ago that a so called Woman Expert was on CNBC saying to sell the banks and buy companies like Visa and Mastercard. Looking at the 5 days or so and Visa and Mastercsrd have taken a plunge while banking sector is on a tear, solid upward run.This is why you can't trust experts."
"The 10 year bond rate is really helping the banks. Since Sept 15, 2020 at .679 to Friday at 1.635 the banks have improved the spread by .956!"
financials are heating up....WFC up over 7% today...good sign....maybe now we head to $15-$17 range...where we should be....
FHN is a forward moving machine that will not be side tracked.....:) I got the faith!!!!!
Up 12% in the last 30 days! Love this stock! I think there is much more to come!
"So I’m a bit confused. With the merger happening and IBKC holders receiving 4.5 shares to every 1 share they have. What will the benefit be for FHN? Sorry, I’m a bit of a noob to this..."
Nice recovery off the low today. Good stock and great divi.
"5/18 Stanley Druckenmiller announced buying 1,950,000 shares of FHN."
I predict $.58 eps for Q2. Any guesses?
Come in FHN! Are you going to increase the Divy? Most banks have! Buy backs? How bout some news!
Another example of bank consolidation is happening: HBAN just announced a merger with TCF that puts them in the top ten regional banks. All the more reason for someone to acquire FHN.
FED stress test results to release banks for buybacks and dividends are about to be announced so look for upward price pressure1
Fhn is strong in the mortgage business. They are going to have a much better q than expected. Unless things just unravel I see $13-15 by end of year. Minimum. Add in the writing of calls here and there and the divy and you have another 1.5. I love having a few slow and steady stocks in my bag.
"My natural curiosity leads me into interesting questions and I ask for your input on this one. Looking at the projected eps in 2021 and 2022 of a WIDE number of banks, the 2022 projected eps is equal to or LESS THAN 2021. That strikes me as one of two things: analysts are lazy and haven't done their work or these are outrageous numbers coming out of this past pandemic year. Please help me sort this out with your reasoned possibilities."
"The number one question in my mind and I would guess most investors in bank/financial stocks in this market has to be ""Have these companies deliberately over hedged their balance sheets against loan losses?"" If so the next Q report or the next after that those hedges could reverse into gangbuster earnings. We are already beginning to see better earnings than expected from some in this past quarter. Anybody have thoughts or info that might clear up this question?"
Not into conspiracy theories but isn't it perfect timing for Powell to force his Fed Directors to sell all their stock holdings just before a possible correction?
Even at 16 this is a EXCELLENT BUY!!!
This stock seems to have an allergic reaction to $10. Every time it gets there it runs back down. Could be the week to go through $10 and stay above though. It would be nice to start a run towards $11.
100% faith in this investment.....this is one money making machine in the coming quarters.........
I'm sticking with my Q1 eps estimate of $.60 on FHN and $.40 on HBAN. Dividend increases on both to $.17/Q at the Q2 report dates.
great news...........great earnings beat..........................great dividend..................great stable investment
"it's always one step forward, and two steps back with FHN"
Odd trend: Since early August the DPST (representing regional banks) has trended down as the TEN year bond rate trended up. Logically they should follow the same trendline. Any guess why?
Roller coaster ride. Thank you FED for messing up a good stock with all your overblown fear.
been holding since 7.50
FHN priced at $15.56 has cash minus debt equal to $20.82 a share.
Yield curve steadily moving up!
LARGE dividend increases and buybacks are being announced by the banks in afterhours.
Solid earning indeed. Unadjusted basis is a 10 cent EPS beat (53 vs 43) and a 15 cent beat (58 eps) on an adjusted basis (taking out the 5 million incurred from Iberiabank merger expenses).Revenues also surpassed analyst expectations 781 million versus 775.4 million.Zacks was wrong again. Conference call should be a must listen to.
"anyone here buying below $9.00?....seems like a bargain, but there is increasing fear in the market I think....."
Don't understand market's negative reaction. Maybe conference call will provide some understanding.
The market is showing a whole lot of new investors just how cruel it can be today.....you got to have brass bells to survive.....it's not all easy money with the market going up every day.....do your own DD and trust in your investment.....FHN doing a fine job of holding it's own.......:)
been holding quite a while....never thought I would see $14.00....hooooraaaayyy!! keep it going!
Dividend restrictions on banks ends after June 30. FHN will on all likelihood raise theirs. This is why I have been accumulating this baby.
Been here for over half a year........this is a diamond in the rough......long term hold and will be a happy camper in the years to come.......:) Passed the stress test with no problem at all......lookin for stock buy backs........hopefully even a rise in dividend .........:)
Now is the time to load up on this one.Great dividend. Wrote tons of PPP loan at 5% no worries commission.
Optimism rally from Fitch giving a BBB score and an outlook stable rating on FHN credit...
6/30 UBS issued a buy reco on FHN.
Just a reminder: Banks make money when the ten year bond rate rises. It was up to 1.695 today and moved up .071. At this rate my prediction of 2 by the end of June may be pretty close!
Getting closer to a 'fresh' multi year high....
"With the PPI at 8.3% today, the CPI on Tuesday is going to be anything but ""transitory""............God Help Us"
My records show dividend announcement this week.
Other banks talking dividend increases. I would prefer company buyback and stock appreciation versus potential 1 time dividend increase. Much rather see $20+ per share stock price. Long and strong on FHN.
What a beautiful stock
"unless FHN blows out the earning report, we may not see a sizeable upwards move until a COVID vaccine is in the market....hope I am wrong, but it just seems like the economy wont expand until people can go out and spend $....especially on the entertainment side which is taking the biggest hit right now....restaurants, movie theaters, bars....etc."
"FNB just announced resumption of their share buyback program! That should mean there is a green light on for other regional banks , like FHN, to restart theirs. Any thoughts on this?"
just no mercy for bank stocks whatsoever in this market
All of the economic trends falling into FHN's lap. Residents of New York City fleeing to States oile North Carolina which is one of the States of operation of the recent acquired Iberia Bank. More people moving into states where FHN operates means a boost to the economy especially real estate housing....which then spreads out from there.
"Holding up better than most of the market. Made my 3rd and final purchase today. Now sit back, collect the divy, and watch the share price rise!! Giddy Up!"
Banks have been out of favor for quite a while now....it will turn around soon I hope....a rise in interest rates would be a heavenly thing but may be a while....FHN is solid and IMO one to keep hold of.....took a long time for it to break out of the 17's then I thought it was going to charge through 20......it will happen again....give it time.........
Now let’s see if we get another dividend increase come March!
"Well couldn't turn down a company paying an 8% yield with a runway of growth and a rock solid balance sheet during times like these. I get there'll be some deferments on mortgages coming up, but down 50+% from it's highs? Easy money"
"Thinking I should have sold at $9.84 today and rebuy if it gets back into the $9.20's. That is the way it has been acting. Still like the stock, just trying to figure a way to make some $$$ while this seems range bound."
FHN pe ratio is 6.66 and today is Monday the 13th.
Cramer just pumped us big time.....now we'll see what happens today.......:)
"Well, we made up a good chunk today......:)"
Cramer just said his favorite Regional Bank was FHN! Don't know if thats good or bad! Nice to get a little plug though
"Kramer says FHN will report ""A whopper of an EPS"" for the quarter."
The banking sector is getting back into good favor with the market now......we'll just keep rolling up hill from here.......:)IMO
IMO....a lot of companies are just getting drug down short term because of hedge funds having to dig up cash out of their portfolios to cover all these short positions they hold....as soon as everything cools off....FHN will be right back on track again headed north........
Is there any good reason to invest here ? Is this bank stock in an expanding market ?
"Maybe we head back to $11 or $12 range ....,,hopefully higher?"
"this uptick could possibly be for real this time.....hoping so...it's been a long time coming, while in the meantime watching tech stocks exploding...."
It's almost like no one wants a stable company that pays a good dividend. FHN should be selling for over $20 right now.
"Jefferies upgraded FHN this morning from a ""Hold"" to a ""Buy""."
Que the song: 18 Again
"buy, buy, buy! anything under $19 is a bargain."
"Wells Fargo: These 3 High-Yield Dividend Stocks Have Double Digit UpsideTipRanks•August 6, 2020In line with his comments, Shaw rates FHN a Buy, and his $11 price target implies a one-year upside of 18% for the stock. (To watch Shaw’s track record, click here)Similarly, the rest of the Street is getting onboard. The shares have a Strong Buy analyst consensus rating, based on 6 Buys and 1 Hold, while the $11.50 average price target suggests that FHN has room for 23% upside growth this year. (See First Horizon stock analysis on TipRanks)"
Being cautious in the market is one thing....but I'm 100% bullish on FHN.....and long for the future of this company!!!!!!Wouldn't get rid of this now for any reason.....:)
Anyone receive their FHN dividend yet?
"10 year bond yield touches pre pandemic levels. Pre pandemic, FHN was not merged with Iberia Bank, had not yet acquired the 4 Truist (Trust?) Branches. Share price currently around pre pandemic level...not reflecting the merger yet."
Fed will release bank stress test results and recos at 4:30 today.
Morgan Stanley maintains equal-weight rating on FHN lifting theirnprice target to $18.50 from $17.00.
"Biggest question right now is the Dividend, period!! Will the merger allow FHN to keep the current dividend? Will the new rules put in place by the fed on liquidity allow FHN to keep the current dividend? These are what’s leading to days like today. I personally think the dividend will be maintained. And I am a buyer at these levels."
"any thoughts on when the merger is completed, will the divvy be adjusted higher ?"
This stock seems to be a great value at $15.46
"Recovery with FHN coincides with a massive bounce of the 10 year bond partly the result of the Feds deciding not to end (taper off) bond buying just yet along with the promise of rate hikes in next two years. Someone else already mentioned that.Despite Hurricane Ida, I still believe a dividend increase is in the cards for 2022."
Swear to god they just don't want this in the 18's.......but it will get there......:) It's like playing ping pong.....back and forth.......
"Prediction: FOMC will ""taper"" interest rates on 11/5-6. Be ready!"
"Did anyone read the Q1 transcript? By the number of ""indecipherable"" inclusions, I must guess everyone wore masks or everyone mumbled. Share buybacks during the quarter were stated as $76 million out of $500 million authorized and $53 million reserves were released. That leaves a lot that can help following quarters! Need the dividend increase or the top gets blocked at $20 where the yield goes under 3%."
"With this dividend and solid numbers I dont get it stock should be reacting big time,"
"Pay out rate is under 32%. $500,000,000 buyback is authorized. Merger is happening. A management with balls would now raise the dividend in this Q report and show their colors."
Slow and steady.......Almost long on this security and loving every minute of it!!!!!......:)
"Initiated new position in this company for the 1st time. Stock has not risen as much as some other financials the past 8 weeks or so. Good value here. And it pays a nice divi while I wait for capital appreciation. Needed a bank in my portfolio and chose this one. By the way, I have been utilizing their services for years. Always good service."
My average is now $7.80. What an opportunity to add shares before earnings and eventual merger.
I expect a series of bank buyback announcements over the next 2-3 weeks. JPM and MS have announced with GS expected tomorrow. Regions are getting lined up. Any estimates on FHN or other regionals?
If management stays at $.60 div in Q2 report the price sticks at $20 or less. If they go to at least $.72 the price can move up as high as $24. I bail if the dividend falls below 3% yield.
Open for discussion: Eight brokerages just forecast S&P 500 for 2021: Up 10.1% to 4113 (up 414 points) on $181 average eps vs 12/5/2020 eps $98.84. That calls for an improvement from 37.42 p/e to 22.72 p/e. Any thoughts?
"2021 estimates by Q: $.37,.41,.41,.36 = $1.69 probables by Q: $.51,.56,.62,.68= $2.37I for one have no faith in the estimates on this stock and think the probables are much more likely."
$19.00 around the horizon....maybe the lazy analysts covering this stock are waking up and realizing that FHN has an insanely low valuation....
"I found my new fav stock. 9 dollars on day, 10 the next. Easy 8-10 percent swing trading opportunities every other day. Strong company so don’t have to worried about some dramatic dip either."
"This stock seems to be in the right spot right now. Coming off the merger with IberiaBank to create a major regional in the fast growing South East US, with the combination of what appears to be the gradual increase of interest rates, this bank is potentially primed for a significant increase. With book value at 13.59 and a reasonable multiple of 1.5 book, that puts a potential price of $20.39. That's a 27% increase from todays current price of $16.10. Even if we don't see such an increase this year, there's nothing wrong with sitting back and collecting the 3.76% dividend. And since I am fortunate to not need the income, I'm set up to buy more shares with the divy each quarter. We may look back a year or so and think $16 was cheap."
"What I wouldn't give to tap in on the phone conversations of the Zach's executives,..... or hone in on the VIP conversations on the golf course.....how many dirty deals are being made under the table before they downgrade or upgrade a stock?.....If you think that doesn't happen......I have some beachfront property to sell you in Arizona...LOL"
hope we can keep it going tomorrow and push the PPS to $14.00...it would be a long time coming...
Is it too late to buy more shares? I’m on the fence.
"Congrats to the Longs who jumped in when this dropped to the 7's during Covid Panic of Spring 2020. You have seen a double, a quarterly dividend issued each time. Stable and Steady FHN"
Sold my USB today and bought FHN. Looks like a great stock to own with very nice Divy!
Could we get a discussion going on what to expect on eps for Q3 and Q4? I'll start it off by sticking to my predictions from a month ago just to give us a base to begin. My logic is the merger has gone well and is adding value and earnings ahead of schedule and interest rates are trending up slowly but will begin to speed up.
"""Everyone has given up on this. This is rather extraordinary. You're getting First Horizon at a 5% yield?! It's doing remarkably well. I'm not allowed to own stocks but if I could I think I'd own First Horizon. Bryan Jordan is a good manager, that is just crazy!"" - Jim Cramer 3/6/2020 (FHN traded at $12.63 at the time)"
"The target for this stock is $18, gains are coming!"
Merger with Iberia bank will be completed in July! Strong PPP loan base. Get in now!
this quarters report will have the full merger results plus the branches bought from sun trust...stock is going to rocket to $20 by jANUARY..Volume has been good lately
"My advice to you, buy the dip! This stock should be in the twenties. It will see extraordinary growth in the following years."
I agree...I'm amazed no one is even on this board....FHN will make many folks a whole lot of money in the market once the bank stocks get back to having good words said about them again......I'm most assuredly long FHN........
"JPM just announced a $30,000,000,000 share buyback plan. Regional bank shares will explode starting Monday!"
7% divided increase! 
12.3 million shares Volume. Trades up 32 cents at the close then another 32 cents After Hours. What is going on with FHN? Someone is loading up the truck(s).
Horrible ADP jobs report means the Friday unemployment number will be horrible (unless Feds fake the numbers).
Stock was up over 4 1/2% today and didn't beat the 10 day and 3mos. ave. volume. This tells me people need bids much higher to depart with shares. This stock is going much higher.
"BAAB report calls for 4Q to show annualized merger savings of $48,000,000 and $170,000,000 for FY21. That is strong!"
Many of us wisely foresaw the opportunities of buying banks/financials when the pandemic crushed them. We need now to collectively think through who will be the similar winners benefiting when the government pays off most or all college debts. Can we put our heads together and discuss the stocks to be accumulating that will be receiving this extra money that people won't have to pay for these debts?
A soon to be powerhouse regional bank (after merger) is sitting at $10 per share. wow!!!!
"FHN insiders bought 777,565 shares in the past 12 months."
Last month I said I thought my forecast of $.45 eps for Q4 was conservative. I agree with myself and move it to $.60.
Sixteen days ago the Fed cleared the banks to run and now we are into a new year. That has given managements and their boards time to meet and decide what actions they can handle: share buybacks and/or dividend increases. Time for announcements to start as a wave.
"Next week, the slow painfull climb back to $10. No love out there for banks right now. $10 may be a ceiling for the time being. Hope it's not though."
"I'm pretty happy about this one. A year ago I was showing a paper loss. I picked up more and all my shares are now showing a profit, the ones I bought last year a LOT higher price. Looks good to buy here, too. Not sure I will, but it's a solid company with a good dividend and some upside, considerable upside if they have to raise interest rates later. I recommend it."
"Come one, come all, and come get your 6% dividend yield. You do not even need to wear a Mask to get this delicious Yield. It is like the bank is coming to your living room to make a deposit in your pocket."
Price movement recovery is reflective of the 10 year bond recovery. I think we will finish very strong towards end of the year.
FHN just keeps a creeping north.....:) This is a money making machine and the bank stocks aren't even in favor right now.......imagine what is going to happen if the interest rtes ever do rise again.........BOOM........:) Super long term hold for sure for massive gains......:)IMO
FHN has such a strong financial structure. All indications are positive yet the stock meanders at a somewhat low level. Seems they positioning themselves for a buyout. Just an assumption but perhaps the soon to be banking conference will reap some rewards.
Most of the other banks are up nicely today! Not sure why we are not participating?
Don't stress out folks.....FHN is so under valued it's a scary thing....I'd bet both my eye teeth this security is going a whole lot higher......IMO........:) We just have to wait till the banks are back in favor again....glad I got in almost a year ago.........:) But even at this level it's a bargain....plus the dividend.........:)
this is the first stock since joining the trade market that I happy to own (: 15 shares and growing reinvestment
Nice week! Up .60 cents! That $14.80 purchase a few days ago is looking good! Jacob… you missed your opportunity on the day you said “not yet”. It was the day to buy!
hopefully this is the catalyst that will eventually get us to a reasonable valuation.....above $30.00
"On an adjusted earnings basis 51 cents EPS, a 5 cent EPS beat quarter to quarter. $76 million of merger related cost savings. Huge earnings report with the unadjusted 40 cents EPS exceeding analyst expectations of 37 cents EPS.."
last chance to get cheap shares before the train leaves the station...
Cramer to interview CEO of FHN on segment coming up. Prior to interview just said stock is cheap.
This was a $15 to $17 stock consistantly pre pandemic. Given the merger is now complete I expect a return to those levels rather quickly and then beyond those levels given the merger. Volume yesterday is a significant factor in my thought process. Ultra Bullish here!!!!
Here we go again...... just can't hold $10+. I thought with the merger and increase in size that we would see at least a $12-13 price. This stock makes me shake my head every day. Sticking with it though.
seems every financial institution increased there divys but FHN ...
"slowly creeping up....looks like they want to take it to $20.00......FHN really should be in the mid $30s.....to a valuation similar to its peers........I suppose that will come later in the year...in the meantime, keep those DIV's coming."
"For new investors of FHN, brokers are making it simple to enroll in DRIP, dividend reinvestment plan, via their apps. FHN seems like a perfect investment to enroll in my opinion, so I enrolled. Covid-19 won't be an issue forever. Iberia Bank operates in hard hit Florida though....But, both Iberia and FHN seem well capitalized and the feds said so about the top banks. I wish FHN would have said something regarding their dividend...Unclear if FHN is one of the banks being asked to reduce their dividend for 3rd Quarter or not."
Another div raise coming....
"Well, .30 a share for the day sure as heck is better than having it in a savings acct.......:)"
great dividend stock with a low pe.... good for slow and steady during market turmoil....possible buyout candidate being a small fish in the sea of banks..
Here it is!
"CFRA just moved the target up for FHN to $17, expecting '21 eps at $1.56."
Not a bad earnings report. Just setting up for some ugly times to come. They seem to be getting prepared.
"not sure why regional banks are punished for the big bank's under performance....seems a bit irrational, but then again this is an irrational market...... FHN should be trading at least $20 by now...."
Sticking with 11/5-6 for the taper. Unemployment number is the next nail.
"Now that the short sellers have collected their money, us longs get to finally enjoy the ride up to $10."
Zacks just moved FHN up to a Number one STRONG BUY rating.
"today is a turning point....vaccine soon to be out and Biden will probably raise interest rates...both positives for FHN, $15.00-$18.00 very possible IMO"
They are saying FHN is holding it's dry powder and not spending any of it's cash......will have plenty to issue loans soon....IMO this is a southern gold mine.....just kick back and enjoy the ride.......:)
In the process of moving to $14.
"My favorite bank stock. Even if you missed the recent rally in the past week or two, the growth runway + yield + balance sheet make this an easy double. Fantastic CEO."
Thank god for a bright green FHN......:) The rest of my portfolio is a blood bath........so far.......
"Remember when FHN was less than $10 a share? Yea, I can't remember when that happened either."
Just did a search for the top 100 U.S. banks with the highest operating revenue growth rate and FHN is in the top 10 at 59%.
Why is this not $20?
Next timer Cramer has the CEO on I hope he listens to how good things are going and then asks…..why no dividend raise then.
Back to business: 10 year bond yield gliding up.
"Market down, FHN up today. Why? Janet Yellen announced that a Federal Rate Hike may be needed. Truth is that inflation is spiking up big. Jist look at home prices, Crude Oil up big today, food and construction materials up big. The inflationary pain has only just begun. But, fed rate hikes are a Boon plus plus for Banking sector."
"""Bryan Jordan is terrific! I mean this thing yields 8%. I talked to Secretary Munuchin he's not talking about getting rid of the bank dividends like they did over in Europe. Bryan runs a fantastic bank in the strongest part of the country and I understand there's gotta be loan forgiveness but I think at $8 bucks...wow $7 bucks ENOUGH! ENOUGH WITH THE SELLING!"" - Jim Cramer 4/1/2020 (FHN traded at $7.43)"
Will the Iberia bank results be included in the next quarterly report? That could provide a significant increase in eps.
i guess wall street didnt like the results.....
"Even after the 30%+ rally from the lows in the past few weeks, this baby is still trading at nearly half it's highs and yields near 7%. Fantastic CEO and just approved a merger to make this one of the largest banks in the fastest growing region of the country. It's trading a bit under the radar being a regional bank, but that is quickly changing. This is still a fantastic bargain."
Here we go boys and girls! 10 year up over 1.50%! FHN up nicely in pre market! Giddy Up!
FHN has now become the takeover target for PNC and TFC. Should be an interesting fight!
A chance to buy below 15...expect outstanding report
Just added again. One of these days it’s going to pay off!
"The new Five Star Bankcorp IPO came out this week. This is one heck of a tiny California based regional. Less than 350 million Market Cap. Only 7 branch offices and 2 loan offices. It is well.within FHN's wheelhouse to acquire but not sure if FHN even wants the Northern California region. Maybe? Also I am not smart enough to speculate on things like this. But, I don't see any M&A targets for FHN that would be relatively cheap. Most regionals are way up there in Market Cap. What a super tiny bank...I wonder if FHN's appetite for growing through M&A is still there after having merged just 1 year ago with Iberia."
What a dividend cash cow. And banking sector sentiment is improving. Long FHN
This is a good time to be cautious in this market. Protect your gains until the political changes are over.
"what will the share purchase do to the price ?First Horizon Corporation Announces $500 Million Share Purchase Program6:45 AM ET, 01/27/2021 - GlobeNewswire"
"Ouch! Should be rebuying down here, but since I missed the move on 9/16, I now get to ride this back up for no gain.. All banks still hurting."
This stock is cheap compared to Regions. Regions down on their earnings report. A lot of favoritismon this one vs. FHN. Believe more people will now gravitate towards FHN. It's a cheaper stock and one that is OUTPERFORMING RF. Stock headed for $20+
Bank of America M Lynch raised FHN target to $20. Raymond James raised to $18.
The talking heads are starting to talk favorably about banks little by little.... I'm just fine with this creeping forward .......:)
Good news on the economy sends banking sector up big each time. Need to get people back to work and off the unemployment.
"From the call regarding the dividend: “...based on our understanding of the rules in the Fed framework, we feel very confident that we will be recommending to our Board that they consider continuing the dividend at the current levels.”"
"Reading the transcript, it looks like they released $28 million in loan reserves and still have $200 million on the books and will release a lot in 2021. They have the ability to buyback shares. They are well ahead of the two year schedule to cover the book value drop from the merger. Anybody pick up info from the transcript or hearing the meeting?"
We will see gains next week!
"WFC crushed it on earnings, good sign for FHN."
anyone else besides me thinks we get to $20-$25 range soon....seems logical based on the low valuation....PE ratio under 8...most other banks PE's are in the 15-17 range....
FHN is flirting with the 18 buck level again....if it breaks through and stays there for a few days my bet is it will keep on truckin......:)
SP running to the end of current yields price. Next course of action is to raise the dividend.
"two of my favorite regional banks are FHN and IBOC....but I cannot figure out why IBOC always outperforms FHN....IBOC's PE is currently more than twice as much as FHN's and their divy is less than what FHN pays.....in all fairness, FHN should be trading at least at $35 per share....."
