"Liberty Latin America's stock has been crushed by the COVID-19 pandemic; however, the underlying business is still producing positive cash flow. The company recently completed the acquisition of AT&T's Puerto Rican assets at what appear to be fire-sale prices. The company has a large and very-difficult-to-replicate infrastructure of subsea fiber and cable lines that will provide an enduring advantage for a long time to come. With the accretive AT&T acquisition and a rebound that is sure to follow in its key markets, the stock is at least 60% undervalued currently."
Well don't know if this short term rise will last but I'm happy you all are enjoying the ride with me.
