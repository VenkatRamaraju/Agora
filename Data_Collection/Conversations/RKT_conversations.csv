It has to break 15.90's to see higher
My puts looking tasty. $14 by days end off bagholdie
"You all can thank me, I sold HALF of my shares, usually its always happen. I sell stocks that crashing, then boom, the stocks jumped up the next day. Sold half on Monday, and you guess it, the stock been going up...LOL FML!!!!"
Hahaha People still have no clue how over valued this stock is. Company shouldn’t be worth more then $15Billion
"don't wait for the crash, take some off the table!"
"Target of 7 dollars taking a bit longer than expected, nevertheless stock price is still headed in that direction. New lows nearly every day."
I’m telling you' short interest has really dropped. They are buying it back. Going to push this stock over20
"no dividend, no chance to move up."
The structure of this company is more less private. You have 1.99 billion shares outstanding that are D shares mainly owned by the Gilbert family. These shares are not traded in the market. Only A shares are traded with. 136 million shares outstanding. The float is about 130 million shares which is only a little more then 6 percent of the company. No big outsider will ever enter this picture unless Dan Gilbert sells some of those D shares and converts them to A shares. Rocket can’t even be in the S & P 500 because you have to trade at least 10 percent of the shares.
"Dan Gilbert would love for RKT to hit $12/share, he can take the company private again as he did 20 years ago. DG is the smartest man in finance."
"Anyone invested in RKT needs to read today's wall street journal, page b12. This article explains exactly what's going to happen in RKTS profits (down) going into the future. Basically, RKT will be receiving less In commissions on each loan as they sell their loans to Fannie Mae after they originate them. I'm sure all the large hedge funds that are invested in RKT are also reading this article this morning. Monday could be brutal for RKT"
Bottom is in
Anyone else posts have been deleted on RKT???
wow dude. was yesterday really the bottom? when i get more money I'll buy some.
"Now... if you truly believe:""No Company is looking to aquire ROCKET MORTGAGE at a BARGAIN price""Keep shorting.... otherwise...... it might be prudent to hold and/or buy!!!!!Many Financial institutions and others such as AMAZON are eyeing the #1 Mortgage Lender in the Country!"
this company is finished! all investors are slowly getting out!!
Barclays raises from $18 to $19 Target!!!!
Rising interests rates are way overblown. 10 yr yield is 1.5% lmao and people are tanking a very profitable company on that.
They said 1B buyback. But sold half of it 500M at 25. with the money thy got with that sale now thy can buy back worth 1B. So there is no real back actually 
Cheap at 40 but can’t dare to buy at 15 
Sofi 10% up upgraded. Fintech
"If u r real long, u should know why mortgage stocks are up today  comment the reason if u know! Testing who is real longs here "
"this will hit over25 plus soon as soon as stock anaylist see how cheap pe ratio this stock is theyput out abuyoutof $50 to $60 a share..they make earning per share profit over $3.50 a share in 2021 and will make earning per share each year $3.50 next 5 year , pe ratio at only 5.00 while every other stock on nasdaq and ny pe ratio at 35.00 to 45.00. those that say they cannot find a hugehuge growth company that still have a low pe ratio at 5.00 is not looking hard enough .im sure billionierslike the icahn and buffet and mungers is looking and watching this company now for sure this will be taken over at $50 to $60 a share in 2022 too too cheap cheap not to betaken overin 2022. or a bigbig hedgefunders buy a bigbig chunk of this company or stocks in this company"
I never follow my own rules or advice but I always look back and think why didn’t I BUY when everyone else is selling?! Hoping the market will rebound by January.
"Option sellers made out perfectly with exactly $15. Congrats to the manipulators. Fridays are so predictable. What a great bargain for a profitable company that has shown it can increase market share in a rising rate environment. I forgot to mention, they have recruited an army of Realtors and Insurance brokers across the country that can now originate purchase and refi loans on their platform. This is just starting to bear fruit. Be patient and Accumulate. Probably not a good stock for quick money, but I think a GREAT stock for long term wealth. The Amazon of finance. I just had a loan close for over $500k with them and I spent about 2 hours originating it and following up with the buyer. People go back to them over and over.....my boots on the ground have shown me this."
Anyone know the short interest here??
buy at 2.00 only
Nearly $20B in EBITDA over the past 6 quarters with a Market Cap of $30B. Unbelievable!
"Sell this and move on. 6 Rafi picks to buy now: ASAN, WIRE, UPWK, APPS, TREX, ALLY."
don't short my company lol! got everyone to jump on board for the ride down!!
i see 80 in the future. This could get there by January
Rocket made in 1 year (2020) $10B dollars which is the entire Market Capitalization of UWM Corp. ($10B)
@bcool123 When did you reduce your position?
There are aggressive tired sellers at every corner. Holding the gains only possible with strong catalyst. Period.

"i'm about to sell all my shares, so get ready for rocket to liftoff. always happens that way"
Sofi 
The same bots post all day everyday lmao.
Under valued and over sold
"well hit down 40,000.00 worse mistake in my investing career. Is there any reason I don't just take the loss and move on? Serious thoughts please. I don't need reinforcement of my mistake believing in this company including the leadership."
The drop from 17.30 is fast and frustrating 
This company is making all kinds of profit. Why is the price so low?
"Rocket Mortgage. Rocket Auto Loans. Rocket Home Insurance. Rocket Home Equity Credit Card. Rocket Brokerage. The downside risk at this price point is very low, while the upside potential is exponential....particularly if you think the days of the old brick and mortar banks and insurance companies is coming to an end. Hopefully, Rocket is holding on to the adjustable rate mortgages in their asset portfolio and selling off the fixed interest rate mortgages."
With current trends. I wonder if at some point I might start to owe money for the privilege of owning RKT shares and have to start paying payments like a mortgage.
"Tv commercials and Detroit are the only 2 things management knows. When investors force, thy come up with some timber new line of businesses just for tax harvesting purpose"
"I am not discouraging Rkt, but upst another all time high day. 1b away to reach Rkt market cap. I know we can’t compare both! But an example y u don’t need 20 group of companies to perform better. Focus on ur one product. Rkt proved their tech in mortgage industry already and it’s really time to diversify and concentrate on another hot area with the money thy have. I trusts Rkt for long term play and can’t do miracles overnight"
"From JPM earnings today: Average loans were down 6% year on year, but up 2% quarter on quarter with portfolio additions now outpacing prepayments. It was another strong quarter for originations totaling nearly $42 billion, up 43% year on year, reflecting record purchase volume and share gains in the refi market."
In early November they report earnings along with the CC. It will be very interestingto see how many shares have been purchased by the company. They have authorized 2 - 1 billion dollar buybacks since going public. If no shares have been purchased they must be anticipating a rough market for the stock. Hopefully I am wrong!
As interest rates rise so will the bottom line for both RKT and $UWMC. Enjoy this beautiful journey we will be taking over the next couple of years:)
"In the last earnings call at 18, Jay told its way undervalued and they have tools to fix it with potential buyback and acquire. Just curious what he gonna say at 15  repeat the same script and end the call sooner "
Sold all my rkt 120000 k and rotation to msft & appl @ gm&amd
"Both $UWMC and RKT will go up when everyone least expects it. Then everyone will say, ""I wish I had bought more"". It happens this way every time!"
"As said earlier, bad boys trying their best to pin under 16. Let’s see tomorrow. My guess is it ends 15.99 or lesser"
Nelson my dear .i talk to you and please flow my idea .i book loss more then 183000 usd .first i buy 10000 k @27 then average till 18.35 and i wait near to 7 month with invest very big amount.last week i sold all my position and buy msft gm amd and appl .
"What I have noticed is that Rocket isn't yet good at being a public company and playing the earnings game. You want to estimate low and beat. Rocket instead gives their best estimate and slightly misses each quarter. Now for the quarter ending Sept 30th, the original estimate was .38 cents but Rocket has updated their figures so now analysts have .49 cents. Jay doesn't know how to run a public company!"
"told you, it's a scam!"
Dan I hope his health goes down the drain just like everyone’s investment did.
Rocket is a winner take my word
"There will be a dividend. But, it will be permanent!"
"Rocket Companies is a ""BUYOUT TARGET""Min. $35/Share.... JUST HOLD AND BUY"
It's Friday. Let's have some fun! What is your Rocket stock price in 5 years? 10 years?
20% move up coming
almost 14s after hrs!
new 52 week lows.. whats going on??
Go to $22
"I realized the day traders and shorts are playing this stock daily. Push up mid day, bring all the way back and most days even lower. We longs have been in this cycle since last March. It’s going to take a day for some reason this stock pops up hard, 2-3-4-5 dollars and it flushes this daily practice out. Until then, it will continue day after day after day."
"If you had the choice, would you rather RKT merge with Upstart to take over the lending market or with Salesforce and compete against Upstart and SoFi???"
"Very red market day! But, both UWMC and $RKT end green. I like it:)"
Single digits inbound. Exciting times as always
Kermit and facts of life are longs long gone  livin the good life after riding the rkt down!
drip drip drip
Still at 17.30
Dan Gilbert's wealth is tied to this stock.He will not let this stock fall to zero.RKT is a long-term investment strategy.
"Below are 2nd quarter result.- Generated revenue, net of $2.7 billion and Adjusted Revenue of $2.8 billion¹- Delivered net income of $1.0 billion and Adjusted Net Income of $0.9 billion¹"
"It is funny. When ever RKT is manipulated, through the blame on wall street bets."
"Remember when this was $18 and a bunch of these folks say, buy this dip, this stock is a steal at this price? Today is another good reminder how bad this stock really is. When the market goes up, RKT goes down. When the Market goes down, RKT goes down. Now imaging what will happen to this when the Fed finally raises interest rates and weakens the Refi and New purchase MTG."
"I’ll enjoy holding for 4 years. Gonna be nice return. Allow me to retire at 53. Most on this thread, “I want a million dollars tomorrow.” Might as well whine, “I want a pony.” Relax and enjoy the steady climb that is eventually coming."
Trading or investing in RKT1) JUST HOLD2) Be Patient3) COLLLECT HUGE $ as Rocket will be BOUGHT!!!!!! VERY SOON!!!!
u can't stop a downward momentum stock..
Really kind of criminal on Jay Farner pay. In 2020 he pulledIn 52 million dollars and should at least achieve that amount in 2021.Dan controls the whole company with 94 percent of shares. They are D shares and he gets 10 votes for one of our A shares which account for 6 percent ofthe other shares. It’s totally ran like a private company. Dan could bring a partner in and convert some of the D shares into the A. That certainly won’t happenat 15 bucks a share. Remember he wanted to sell more at 25. I think the shareholders that have the A shares will be stuck until something moves these shares. Buying the A shares back really doesn’t help much for Dan Gilbert. As shareholders of the A shares again we really only control 6 percent. This is very similar to a SPAC. Big lesson learned but very important to read before investing how the company is structured. I reviewed UWMC briefly and it has a messed up structure also.
Sofi running towards 20  quickly from 13 
A stock buyback or a perpetual dividend announcement will be the saving grace for this stock.
"$RKT's short shares availability is up by more than 10% recently. As I said in the link, the volume of options contracts are low for the coming weeks which probably has an impact on the rising stock price even though it may be slow. Why did the short-sellers not attempt to short the stock while the borrowing fees and margin requirement have been sharply down lately? Something gives itchy, I guess!https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RKT/community?p=RKT&messageId=fb135035-9a96-4177-9456-84e8e2446a8b&bcmt=1"
Who bought at $25?
We're well on our way to single digits here. Enjoy the ride
"Nelson just reviewed last conference call Rocket had in august 2021. Julie Booth disclose they had 4.4 billion that could be used as investments, dividends or buybacks. They did announce a 1 billion buyback in November 2020. Please review as this to me indicates a portion of this money could be used as a buy back. At 15 bucks it would not likely be Dan’s 1.85 billion D shares."
Anybody else green on this baby!
I can't believe I got in at $40.
"SHORTED this stock since back in mid march , i would like to thank . rocket leadership for my massive gains keep up the great work."
Oh now it's doing a course correction? Really? Lets see how long this lasts...
Strong hands have stepped in and determined yesterday was the bottom
Remember we all trolled that analyst few months ago when downgraded to 12 when it was trading at 19 
How much % of amazon Jeff owns?
reddit or no reddit rkt will plummet
LC year high today. My cost is 26. 11 to 33 in 4 months
"Lol, pump and dump to jack up call premiums. Don't fall for it!"
UNREAL.....Dow Up Almost 450 Points.Rocket... RED...I'm SO LUCKY Not To Own This Anymore..
"Is this a true statement? Gilbert owns more than 70% of the Rocket family of companies, under which Quicken Loans, the Cleveland Cavaliers, and Bedrock Real Estate are all housed, and which went public earlier this year, sending Gilbert's personal fortune into the stratosphere.Rocket Companies does not own the Cleveland Cavs right?"
"Due to the lack of bullish posts today, I'm going to assume they're now all bankrupt, had their internet/electricity cut off or potentially had their homes repossessed altogether. Call the Samaritans if you're feeling down and can't tell your loved ones the truth about your finances. Hope you're all holding up okay, you were warned plenty of times."
sold
Hahahaha let's see how much lower you can go. You've all been warned for months and thought you knew better. The time of reckoning is near.
quicksand!
is this undervalue or what pe ratio only 5.5 yet every other stock is a 35 to 45 pe ratio just a matter of time buyers will will buy this cheap cheap stock
In case anybody needs to know the bottom is in for both UWMC and $RKT
"rkt is only 5 percent pe ratio with earning per share over 3.50in annual year in 2021 ,they will earn over $3.50 a share every year next 5 years , while every stock on nasdaq and ny pe ratio at 35.00 to 45.00 all the stock analyist will put a price buyout target soon .too toocheapnot to betaken over by a hedgefund like billionier icahn they will be taken over soon in 2022 before 2022 probably in the $50 to $60 range fund"
"I've honestly learned my lesson here. PE and fundamentals means diddly. I'm just waiting for the right time to offset my gains with these losses for tax purposes. Not really a believe in this company anymore, just waiting for the right time to get out."
Honest question. Am I insane to think this can go back up? Possibly mid to low $20s?
Most overvalued stock in the market lol
Can’t blame those sold at high today! It’s down 2.5% from high 
ROCKET HAS CRASHED.
"dan . Detriot needs ,or money sell some more shares"
and to think I didnt sell when it ran to above 40 because I got greedy as Gordon gecko stated was good. now I am being punished for my greed until I repent my evil ways.
Wow just think of the market corrects this thing will be cut in half.
I'm thinking it will above 16 by Friday ..
BIG NEWS MONDAY $$$$$$$$$$
REDDIT!!!!! BUY BUY BUY
Danny boy says the buy back is on hold. gotta build the lions a new dome 
"All Fintechs are flying recently (Upstart, SoFi, Lending Club, and others). They are all based in California and a true tech companies. They specialize in software, AI, or scaled platforms. Jay just runs his mouth about being a tech company in downtown Detroit. I said this all along, Rocket is a great company and profitable but they have to look more like Upstart and less like PennyMac. They need to get a satellite campus in Silicon Valley and start selling their software and developing AI for their personal loans division. Do Fintech STUFF HELLO!!!"
"Being artificially kept down, will explode in the next 6-12 months."
congratulations longs! I just talked to Danny boy and he said the buy back starts at 3.99!!!  
My LC position so far doing good. Got in 2 weeks ago. My sofi also doing good and only failure is CPNG. It will also run soon long term play
Still not yet there and target is still 16 before end of this week.
I can feel the pressure building here at RKT! I like it:)
"Short interest has dropped significantly last 30 days. Down to 9%. So I hope thieves in NY have driven this down with all their announcements. Now they are buying up the shares in order to take it up to 25.00 a share. They certainly made money shorting this stock. Hopefully the ,momentum is changing."
can we get a new low today!
"Is RKT's PE really only 5.3?Biggest Mortgage Company in America, Really?Why?"
Yahoo lists long-term debt at 25 and a half billion down from 27 and a half billion last quarter... that's billion with a b... almost 3 billion in cash... why is it that market pundits never comment on this.... maybe this impedes stock appreciation or is it just the market and interest rates? was it Morgan Stanley that dumped some 10 million shares at $25 6 months ago? just asking honest questions before taking a position at these lows.... the other choice is OPEN.
I've never in my whole life of trading have seen a stock trade as poorly as this one. What's particularly interesting is it's a company that is profitable. Dan and Jay are completely incompetent in leading this company. That's also strange because they had the ability to start the company. I think Dan should bring in new leadership. Dan and Jay have taken this company as far as their talents can go. New leadership would be welcome news to the NY group that really dislikes them.
probably close down on the day.... 
A year ago they were knocking on banks and lowering their price targets. Those companies are now up 100+ percent in many cases. Nothing changed except the gloom that they keep predicting for them didn't come. It's all a game.
"Rocket Home Insurance leveraging captive customers getting new home mortgage, and removing pain point for new home owners who don't have any buying power to negotiate low rates with insurance companies. Rocket Home Equity Credit Card with variable spending limit and interest rate tied to current value of home and prevailing market interest rates. Rocket stock brokerage, with new mortgage customers automatically getting money deposited in their new brokerage account based upon size of mortgage they purchased from Rocket. ROCKET has a lot of upside and should be viewed as a fintech company by the investor community rather than an old brick and mortar mortgage/bank company. PE multiple is way too low for the market leader in online mortgages, that consistently wins awards for offering the best customer satisfaction, versus the brick and mortar banks and other online mortgage companies."
reverse split soon 3 to 1
"I want to share something that happened to me with UPST that started to look the same on Friday. Upst dropped from 90 down to 32.00. I had 300 shares at the time. I was #$%$ but started buying aggressively leading up to the 32.00. I accumulated 2000 shares. It was several days before the earnings call. I noticed about two weeks before the volume started exceeding the 50 day average. Then on the earnings call the stock took off after hours because the announced an acquisition. It went to 102.00 in an hour. I put a stop loss that night at 95 and unfortunately it just barely dipped down and took me out. I was very happy, this was my best hit ever. I do wish I stayed in because it?s at 320 a share now but 130,000 in an hour is still a nice victory. So, RKT just did the same thing. They pushed the stock the last four months down from 21 plus to 15.86 on low volume. Just like what they did to UPST. Then the volume picked up over the 50 day moving average for no reason. We can hate or love this stock but the reality is the thieves in NY play us individual investors. I think something is beginning to build here. It has nothing to do with any fundamentals or interest rates. If I?m right, this stock is about to pop. Check out my facts and timing on upst and you will see I?m correct. Let?s see but it?s identical to upst."
All I know is that they make billions of dollars. It is the sentiment of the mortgage industry. I just don't understand why this company isn't doing anything about its stock. Go back private.
"I really don't get people claiming ""They're rebuilding Detroit!"" like it's some kind of horror show. I don't care what the CEO does with his money. It's his money, and also rebuilding Detroit sounds like a great action. What I care about is, will RKT continue to earn and grow? Yes it will."
next stop 13s
zero is the bottom I think  could go lower knowing rkt 
"prediction - this thing touches the 14.90's today and triggers a ton of stop losses, and then explodes higher from there! well, maybe not a prediction and more like a hope."
Let's take a vote thumps up if you want me to start calling a daily bottom on $UWMC and RKT!
uwmc the real rocket  
why is this so low? it's dirt cheap. only 5 PE ratio.
"I learned this the hard way, if RKT management was so convinced that their stock was undervalued then they would have a large buyback program and insiders would be buying heavily. Neither is happening. If the company is not purchasing their own stock then what makes this a great investment for shareholders?? 10-year treasuries hit 1.6% today and rkt hit a day low of $15.13. RKT is a great company and the nation's, probably the world's largest mortgage broker but as an investment for your retirement account, not such a good idea."
titanic down! 
Just so everyone understands Rocket's high debt. Rocket finances home loans then sells those loans for .95 cents to .98 cents on the dollar to a bank. Rocket then charges a percentage to service the loan they just sold to the bank. Example: Rocket sells a $300K house. The $300K loan is temporarily on Rocket's balance sheet as $300K debt. Rocket then sells the loan to Chase for $295K. The loan is now on Chase's book and Rocket's cash flow just improved by $295K. Rocket then charges Chase $4K to service this loan.
As soon as senate passes the debt.. watch n learn.. stocks soar back. Unless u have a gambling problem and can't hold more than 5 seconds BUY And Hold. Once passed boom stocks this one 17 18. Make easy bank
"Think about this for a moment. Rocket made nearly $10B in 1 year. (2020). Of course we all know that that may never be repeated again to that level. Regardless, that is still real money. Some people are saying Rocket should be $15B Market Cap. So $10B for the 1 year and then $5B for the past 35 years plus future earnings. Makes absolutely no sense. You can't discount the real money that has been made already. Sure you can taper down future expectations but you can't ignore real money."
"Upstart Holdings seems to be doing everything that Rocket is. They do personal loans, auto financing, and mortgage lending via their AI and software platform. Upstart is a 10x bagger over the past 9 months. I am dreaming that Rocket can do half of that (5x bagger) over the next 12 months."
Please break 20ma and 50ma before the earnings and then 200ma after earnings 
Usually Friday here at $UWMC and RKT. Everyone go and have a great weekend!
"Facts are RKT is a mortgage company first and has the technology built into its platform to sustain leadership in the sector and to maintain best of bred. Its side companies will generate billions in near future, RKT is not a fintech company ... Yet. In no way did Farner did not Lie about anything hence those bS lawsuits fizzled awa and if you invested it to think you are smarter than the street (bcool) you are a nimrod.This company is printing billions and it is completely undervalued.... LONG TERM juggernaut here and time and patience will reap rewards... Investing is long term success...but short term its a hell of a trading tool as well"
"95 percet stock on nasdaq and ny is at pe ratio is at 35.00 to 45.00 ,while rkt pe ratio at 5.00 when rkt go to 10 pe ratio we will hit $25 to $30 if we hit 20 pe ratio we hit $50 to $60 a share it show you we so so undervalue we have alonglong way to go up im sure billionier ichan and buffet and mungers is looking watching and following this stock now with pe ratio a 5.00 with earning of 3.50 per sharin 2021and following years with huge huge growth in coming yrears ,this is ichan buffet and munger type of stock they will buy or do a buy a huge chunk ofthe company or shares ordo atake over in 2022 at $50 to $60 a share"
I still say BUY-OUT Target...Last two days.... Perhaps there are talks happening
"@Nelson Sorry you are down so much on this stock that has done nothing but go down. May I ask why you went all in so heavily on RKT? What was your investment thesis and has it changed? You seem like a smart and level headed guy, was wondering what your thought process was. I too went heavily on this. I started buying around $23, after it pulled back from the squeeze, thinking I was being patient and waiting for a dip to get in. That dip never stopped dipping and I just kept averaging down and here we are at $15."
reverse split 3 to 1 all the banks land money for mortgage it's not only rkt
Lending club LC - 7% up. My cost is 26.60
I still believe
"Why RKT Is a Win Win! Most People Bought RKT Because Rates Are Low! But, When Rates Begin To Rise Is When The Tech Part of The RKT Business Will Become Very Valuable! People Will Use It Much More When They Need To Search For The Best Rates When Rates Are On The Rise! Just a Little Food For Thought That Makes This RKT Gal Very Excited;)"
"hi, my name is RKT!"
14s today?
RKT longs would make great captains at sea. Always willing to go down with a sinking ship
all the longs keep disappearing 
So far so good pre market both RKT and my sofi. It’s gonna break 20 today. Hope my Rkt also get more booster . My sofi cost is 13.78 and RKT 24.
"I agree with Nelson and others below. The stock performance and the EBITDA are completely divorced from one another, and have been for far too long. Management needs a new approach that will result in a stock price that accurately reflects company performance. If the current management can't do that, they need to be replaced. The market is overflowing with companies that have good prospects but no profits and yet sell at unbelievable premiums. It is extraordinarily frustrating to see a very profitable company languishing from one month to the next."
"Get out of this trash before it hits $14, we are likely to have a nice end of year run through Q1 of 2022, so if you cut your losses here (for tax offset of gains) you can then move what's left to real companies that will benefit from the Q4/Q1 run! But it is dead money here, and god forbit what will happen when the fed has to raise interest rates."
"RKT will plummet down to earth T-minus 1 hour,. $13 gd speed"
You know as soon as you sell. $UWMC and RKT will both take off like a rocket! United We Make Cash!
"BUY ALL YOU CAN... : Game is overRKT - USA Stock USD 15.12 0.12 0.80%The current analyst and expert consensus on Rocket Companies is Buy with 4 hold recommendations. The current projected Rocket Companies target price consensus is 70.5 with 10 analyst opinions. One of the most common ways Rocket Companies analysts use to provide buy-or-sell recommendation to the public are conference calls analysis and financial statements evaluations. Some experts can also talk to Rocket Companies vendors, executives, and/or customers. Rocket Companies recommendation module provides expert sentiment on the projected Rocket Companies target price to derive its highest and lowest estimates based on target price standard deviation of 7.891. Additionally, take a look at Macroaxis Advice on Rocket Companies to cross-verify analyst projections. Unlike analyst recommendations, Macroaxis provides advice only from the perspective of investor risk tolerance and investment horizon."
"Upstart Financial has 500 employees is a 10x bagger over the past 6 months, has nearly the same market cap as Rocket and they are venturing into mortgage lending. A true Fintech vs a Jay mortgage / marketing company. Embarrassed I am such a poor investor!"
This company has strangely huge debt of $25B which I missed during valuation:Enterprise Value = Market Cap - Cash + debt= $31B + $25B - $2B = $54BNo wonder the stock is dumping. what does a service/software company take a $25B debt for?
Just Saw A RKTShareholder.....OUT In PUBLIC
Now many people out from rkt and buy others

Remember Jay said undervalued at 40. Greatest lie by any ceo. Sorry folks who invested based on his cnbc interview few months ago at 40.
Why no bounce at all. Something very wrong is going on. Anyone know what’s holding this down for so long without a bounce?
will see 20 easy..
$UPST - Cracks $330....only up 712% year to date

"Rocket. The ultimate value play. Earnings are going to be stellar. Again. And again and again. No end in sight to the low interest rate regime, consumer health and desire to own homes, and the desire to expand ones home to accommodate work from home in part or in full."
I buy at a 52 week low in what i consider a growing company. Any thing can happen. Something like what Sheldon Adelson of LVS fame did during the banking crises. He gave his LVS company one billion in cash and the stock shot off like a rocket. No pun intended.
Investor place website working harder than RKT management and pr team to pump this stock 
I am keep telling don’t chase to average down the falling knife and don’t sell kidneys for that. Many other names in the market to invest. I stopped adding month ago and diversifying
down on up days and down on down days what gives
we're did everyone go  
forever Red!!
Sharmota of the stocks
Don't be surprised..... I've said it many times..... BUY OUT!!!! Jay & Dan will WIN BIG!!!!
"I'm having deja vu here at RKT! Kermit, bcool, fun, Rob, Bob Haven (sorry if I left anybody out) All these people were here before our run to $42! Let's see how it turns out this time:) I think it's going to get exciting here at RKT!"
I am planning to buy $LC lending club in the dips. Rkt should acquire it..
"For sure no one going to trust these once in a blue moon Green Days, until it run up 1 week in a row"
"Many of my posts are being censored so I guess I'll just write more of them. Over the past two years, RKT had probably the most financial success in its history with billions of dollars of profits per quarter. On June 15, 2020, the 10 yr yield hit .70 basis points, 30-year rates fell to as low as 2.5%, gain on sale of the mortgage from RKT to Fannie Mae was as high as 4.73%. The average mortgage was $270,000 so RKT made on $100 million in loan volume, $4.73 billion in profit. Going forward and you can verify this through RKT financial transcripts, that spread will fall to approximately 2.5% from 4.73% so instead of making 4.73 billion, their profits will fall to $2.5 billion (not too shabby). This is great for RKT but not for shareholders. Yes, they will continue to write billions and billions of mortgages per year, and have the best technology to underwrite these mortgages, but they cannot control if someone needs to refinance or not. For example, do you need to remortgage your house right now???? Would you take out your equity to invest in this stock market??? How awful would you feel if you took out $100,000 of your home's equity and bought RKT at $22/share, specifically when Jay Farner states on CNBC that their stock is significantly undervalued. The only people that will need to refinance to a higher rate (and there are millions) are people that have high-interest rate credit card balances or people that want to remodel their kitchen and or bathrooms at a 3.5% interest rate instead of a Wells Fargo unsecured remodel loan at 9.5%. Everybody that currently owns RKT stock is significantly underwater. There is not one person that is breakeven or that has a profit in it. Be careful of the hype and as always protect yourself and your family from the rosy future outlooks of these companies."
I just closed out my RKT refinance. Second time I’ve done business with RKT. They are so easy to do business. The software used is so easy to input all financial information. It took 10 days to get my Refi to be approved. Met a Notary to sign the refi docs. Got the check in 2 days. A regular brick snd mortar bank would have taken three times longer. A big RKT supporter.
At least we are not getting punished like NVAX and BBBY. Oh my! Our RKT will be just fine!
Could RKT and SoFi come together to compete against UPST?
Detroit is priority over their stock. Keep proving again and again. Shorts are doing right thing here….
RKT should have never ran to $42 so quickly! Most of the people who bought at that level should have either sold at a loss or averaged down! If anyone has not sold buy this time then most like they are not going to sell no matter how low the price goes. The bottom should be very close.
I can't believe I would be missing $17 dollars so much!!!
Yahoo finally fixed Rocket's Market Cap. Now can Jay and Dan fix Rocket? I doubt it!
Buybacks and Very Good Earnings are my prediction +++
Look at the LOW LOW VOLUME....Those who KNOW..... are JUST HOLDING..... we will be paid GOLD soon!!!!!
My $13 puts are getting crushed. I am 17 years old first year of trading and now I'm losing my college money trying to short rkt junk into grounds red
Not sure why on yahoo it shows the market cap of 2.09 B?
"Many in this board are super negative in Rocket …. I just bought 20,000 shares at $15.35. Will sell at $17.50 before earnings !! Load up the truck boys and girls. Rocket will soon take off like a rocket "
"Buy oil, tech, retail, anything but Mortgage fake fintech wanna be. your welcome!"
The same 4mm shares traded every day.
What’s going on?
"I know everything is about potential and upside BUT Upstart Financial and Rocket Companies now have the exact same Market Capitalization. They are both in the same industries (Mortgage, Auto, Personal Loans) albeit Upstart is much more of a Fintech than Rocket. Upstart's last quarterly earnings were $37M and Rocket's last quarterly earnings were $1B. Again, same Market Cap. Sure Upstart has potential but Rocket is definitely undervalued!"
UWMC PE is nearly double that of Rocket. Rocket PE is 6. UWMC PE is 10.
"For being a well known name and 30 billion market cap, this thing looks so manipulated."
Down over 10% in a week. I'm guessing it closes below $15 by Friday. Worst managed company.
Lets break 15.9's today and hold above 16 for rest of the week.
Just Get It Over With......SELLAnd......
at this rate the stock should be at 0 in 3 weeks 
"Only some catalyst will save from further drop. It broke all our low assumptions and no guts to say this is the bottom  I invested on this with 401k loan amount at 4.5% interest rate. and it fooled me so far, everyday! I want to add more but no money and can’t dare to sell some other stocks to move here. At least I sold dozen of good running stocks to avg down this so far and tired "
"Every time it looks like it wants to bounce off the lows, it then goes right back down. Very bearish even at the 52-week low as the floor still hasn't been set."
guess what's on the way and don't act so surprised...
"Open door 14 to 21, in 2 months. Zillow also moving up"
September is almost over. I'm ready for October! UWMC and $RKT are going to Rock! Bring it on baby;)
Here they come REDDIT!!! REVENGE
futures are fried! 14.50 low midday
"Nearly every post I make here is censored and removed. I want to discuss potential catalysts for RKT to get feedback from others, but not allowed for some reasons. What's up with that?"
Happy Rocket is up 1 penny because it is not down 75 pennies!
"WOW.... Shorts here just don't stop commenting....Fear is Near.... BUY OUT is Eminent at this PRICE. Any day, any minute any second.... NEWS CAN COME OUT!"
"Company likes to inflate numbers. In addition, Dan is literally rebuilding Detroit using YOUR money lol"
Still Rkt is my biggest position. It has future but very slowly and don’t expect it to be 20 in coming weeks or months. I went too much bullish and lost big money. When they say fintech thought like upst. Lesson learned this is slow rich company
I'd like this too except for 26 billion in debt which is a fact that seems to escape many... by the way there is a small Gap left this morning from 1529 to 1542.... it may or may not feel most gaps fill 90% of the time especially on lighter volume.
"As days passes, 20 is becoming dream! Forget abt 30 and 40 "
New 52-week LOW!!!
"I'm still holding. Homes will continue to be bought and sold, and apps like Rocket will continue to take market share in the real estate industry. This company will grow and expand geographically where others cannot. If you look at the 25 yr chart of US home sales you'll see a nice upward trend. We had a special lift during the pandemic recovery, and things are evening out after that, but the long trend is up. This will continue in the long run."
Both RKT and $UWMC will be winners in the coming months. United We Make Cash!
16.12 sold
Currently down $-200K on a $580K investment into Rocket. Sick to my stomach but holding off selling as to not realize this loss. But it definitely hurts right now.
$18 today.... just be patient
What does rkt SP do as prime rate increases?
Buy back from class A to class D. Like moving your money from 1 pocket to another. And also that’s called indirect shorting.
how's everyone holding up?
whos goin down wit the rkt 
"THANK Goodness Reddit SAVED Me On This....Otherwise, I'd Be Down 150K + Now.....NO FUTURE..... 2 Much Competition...Rising Rates.. Decreasing Margins.."
RKT Consistently ........TOTES A LOT OfTimmmmmmmmmmmmberrrrrrr
Wow.... someone is CONFIDENT!!!! 77k on the BID!!!!
BAGS !It's UPAH !
"This hit $40 once, it can do it again. Hodl!"
CEO lacks fiduciary responsibility to shareholders
"BUY BUY BUY!!!!! I believe this is a New Business!!! ""ROCKETFLOOD"" Insurance....https://www.rocketflood.com/"
sell ur 3cent pop and move on 
"end and out, stick and move! "
"The same way things can't only go up and up, things also can't go down and down. It needs these bumps into green for the next leg down. All part of the play. The daily chart from 20th to 27th September shows exactly what I'm on about."
Explode to the UPSIDE... next stop $18 Rocket is being Watched... BUY OUT TARGET
last time u 15s
Honestly so disappointed in Rocket. I can't sell as I am down -160K with a price of $24. Most all other stocks I am following but don't own are up 200-500% over that same time. I am down -30%. It hurts but I really can't go anywhere at this point.
