"NEWS IS EMMINENT!!!!Amazon Mortgage Might Be a Thing SoonColin Robertson Colin RobertsonAugust 6, 2021Mortgage Newsamazon primeThere have been a lot of so-called mortgage disruptors entering the space of late, but this might be the biggest yet. Could Amazon Mortgage be in the works? One recent clue says yes.Earlier this week, HousingWire noted that Amazon appears to be in the process of setting up a mortgage shop, and is apparently hiring talent from a nonbank in the top 10 HMDA lenders.I believe that includes the likes of Quicken Loans, loanDepot, and Caliber Home Loans, though it’s unclear if any of their former employees are actually involved.All the publication could say beyond that is Amazon is looking for someone to head up their “newly-formed mortgage lending division.”"
It looks to me that this stock is charging... And will soon explode... I am thinking to enter tomorrow. It looks safe with good support and high potential.
Nothing good is gonna happen until the investigation is over to see if these CEOS profited from the lying and misleading of investors. I’m stuck at 24. Feels like a long way off. I hope they get to the bottom of this scam sooner rather than later.
Breaking: The Supreme Court has lifted the eviction moratorium.
We ended red as expected. I asked same question last 2 days. How many of u thinking this will end green on Monday even 1 cent up? Green thumbs up  and red thumbs down 
LDI is lousy company and had a bad Q2 but still managed to gain market share. 2.3% to 3.3%. Rocket should be in double digits market share this quarter. Nothing less than 10% share is acceptable at this point!
"What valuation would you put on an American company that does 1/4 of all home originations in the country? (Rocket's goal is 25% market share by 2030) Then include…the title company, auto company, solar financing, and personal loans division. Housing is the single largest personal asset of Americans. When you include Auto and Personal Finance…that is 1/3 of the American GDP! Rocket will have a decent market share of it. A $300B market cap in 10 years isn’t outrageous. There are $2T dollar companies TODAY!"
Is there news ? We are finally up
How many of u think this will end green at least a cent tomorrow?
As expected 17.30 tested again. That’s the $ range it trade. 17.30 to 18.30
One thing is clear. Wall Street does not like mortgage companies. Any of them!
Anyone not a bag holder? Cost avg $21.78 here
Rocket Shell Companies: Based out of Detroit. Hope u got it 
Can this get to $20?
"After 40 years of trading, this is what I’d have told myself when I started; Get in on growing companies that are selling a good or service that you think people will still want far into the future and once you do, never look at the price, because you won’t be able to resist the urge to trade in and out based solely on the price movements."
Red again. #$%$ stock
Some one wrote algo to go reverse to indexes. Thy turned green and this is crashing
I heard about RKT the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Why does revenue drop from Q1 $4.5billion to Q2 $2.6 billion? Does the huge difference come all from refinancing? Can anybody answer it?
Good news = $19
Rocket is the opposite of a Meme Stock:Meme Stock: Skyrockets up in price. No fundamentals. Not profitable. No future. Investors get Rich.Rocket Stock: Goes down in price daily. Has fundamentals. Very profitable. New business segments. Investors on Welfare and Food Stamps.
Going to buy more now
"Next week should be interesting. It's at support right now, so it could begin to climb a little. Or folks could drop it below support to test if there's any buying pressure. I'll probably sell another 20 puts this week at 16.50 strike instead of 17.50. I have NO qualms if folks decide to test price this week and drop it below 16.50, forcing me to buy. If that happens, I'll be in good company considering RKT would buyback at those levels. I'd just turnaround and sell 20 CC at 17.50-18. Lock in a small gain if those get called away and go back to selling puts. Rinse and repeat!"
Now we have TWO Companies - Rocket Mortgage & Rocket Auto as one org...What I would do?Spin the new Auto company as a Next Independent Equity.. !
Is there any news besides lawsuits?
"I love Rocket. Without Rocket, how would I have learned to value misery? How would I have maintained my work ethic knowing I will not be able to retire...ever?! This stock builds character and makes you appreciate the simple things in life like getting smacked by mom cause that trumps watching this dog all day!"
Fake lawsuits filings will end in a couple days! Hopefully we'll start getting some real news.
I expect special dividend this quarter do u know why guys ? Dan own 95% the dividend meaning collect profit !!!
"GOOD READ: This monthAmazon Buying loanDepot?The latest rumor related to Amazon’s impending mortgage moveIs a buyout of mortgage lender loanDepotThough it didn’t seem to be based on any real truthBut it’s been doing the rounds latelyIf, and this is a big if at the moment, Amazon makes a foray into the wonderful world of home loans, they could do so via a takeover, similar to their Whole Foods purchase.After all, it’s sometimes easier to just throw money at something than start a new venture from scratch.One rumor that began circulating recently was a potential Amazon and loanDepot tie-up, though it didn’t seem to be based on any real truth.Sure, sometimes whispers proceed a major announcement, and are often spot on. But in this case it sounds more like fantasy.To squash the rumors, even loanDepot founder Anthony Hsieh took to LinkedIn (his favored social media platform) to say the following:“Just talked to an industry titan that asked if we are under an agreement to sell to amazon. I responded how much was the deal for? Rumors are simply amazing and this one is a good one. mmca.”For the record, mmca stands for “making mortgages cool again.” Other than that, it doesn’t sound like there’s much here."
Rocket earnings after market close on Thursday…UWMC earnings before the market opens on Monday morning. Can we read anything into those release times?
it looks like the surprise company added to the Rocket Auto platform was CarMax!
Reddit boys coming to take us to 50

They had some interesting insights about RKT on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Generated cash = 37% of its MARKET CAP in one quarter!
I’m thinking a deal in the works
Can anyone explain the share structure between Class A and etc...I'm confused between shares outstanding 138Million and implied shares outstanding 1.99Billion

AMAZON ON THE HUNT for MORTGAGE COMPANY....Interesting.... since 2017https://www.quickenloans.com/blog/make-mortgage-payment-amazon-echo
Price / Earnings ratio today = 6.50More attractive today than yesterdayIf U lower they will come.
Huge beat!
For all of you that need to hear this. Rocket is not and has never been a meme stock. Do not wait thinking that will ever happen again. We had 1 day. And that was primarily a misunderstanding of the Rocket avatar on various boards.
tomorrow 20+
"CEO Positive Outlook:""Our record purchase mortgage volume puts us well on the path to our goal of becoming the largest retail home purchase lender in the nation by the end of 2023. That strong momentum will carry us into the second half of the year, as we expect our 2021 mortgage origination closed loan volume to exceed 2020's record performance of $320 billion. Our newer businesses Rocket Homes, Rocket Auto and solar program leverage our existing platform and represent significant growth opportunities."""
Looking like the bottom for today is in or very close!
This is looking to go lower. PT = 12
longs lookin 
"It's been a while since I've felt positive about RKT. This news and the sales of cars and trucks on Rocket Auto is going to be the catalyst we need as shareholders. Rocket has the name and as soon as they start promoting this newer company (which they advertise quite a bit), they will take a huge share of online sales/purchases. Good news finally"
WOW.... Jay talks about ROCKET AUTO tomorrow..... no wonder call options as high as $20!!!!!We will be pre-market $18.50 - $19.... then blow past $20
"The one interesting area for Rocket Companies in their quest to be more ""Fintech"" like is they have dedicated years to IT/software to map out the entire mortgage process across all 50 states and numerous local rules/laws. The idea is, if they can create such a software that can navigate this field, then they could create software to easily handle much more streamlined processes. Hence, there is a future outlook that their software platform can be scaled to other business and thus eventually get a ""tech"" valuation."
Guys just play stock no option calls. U get bankrupt easily 
HEADLINE WASHINGTON NEWS HOMES SALES SOAR AT RECORD PACE IN JUNE
The Margin Requirement Reduction is better than 3 recommendations...
"When the home buying competition is fierce, a Verified Approval from Rocket Mortgage can help. #RocketCan"
On Friday - U know they have to SELL then accumulate at Undervalued pricesremember 50 DMA level..The next crossing is going to be permanent & one of the strongest Buy Signal.If U bought (17.50s) RKT today U have rest of the day OFF...GL!
Way to many calls vs puts bought. Options people never lose. They know information way ahead of us especially if officers of the company are playing.
Company is running out of news. I don’t see any reason why this should rally soon! Every possible good thing is end up worth less!! Well I guess this run one day without any reason out of our expectations after all the retail investors move out!! Gif bless us longs 
Unreal. Up to 19.6 a few weeks ago
"earnings were fabulous! up 6.5% after hours! All you Yahoo Bashers don't mean anything to the real world. How many companies can say they ""took home"" over 1 billion in a single quarter? Let's go Rocket"
Guess I'll buy some more and sell at 18
"In short term is a negative sentiment with hedges. Today Jay comes to talk about RKT auto, and stock is damped down. They want to prove a point. It is very clear. It has been several times in the past. Discourage retail investors. In the long run, it will go up."
Remember if it break 17.30 it will go 16 easily. Can say on life support now
CarMax and Vroom so far on Rocket Auto.
$.20 quarterly dividend to be announced today! This is going to be huge.......I'm buying more!

"To the Moon. Wallstreet Bets going to take this to $40 plus. In the top 10 mentioned. Actually I believe it's #3,....go Rkt"
so do the lawsuits end today or someting?
Tomorrow 
Amazon looking into mortgage business is a joke. Remember ppl pump few months ago with rumors buffet taking partnership. IMO no one water into this low margin high competition seasonal business
"The stock may be green, but it wants to tank SOOOOOOO bad...hate owning a stock where its support is being tested every single day, when it should be the resistance that gets tested every single day."
Existing home sales rise for the second straight month. That's the news today.
We still have 2 hrs to go and volume has already exceeded yesterday's. Buyers slowly coming in.
It tested its frequent support 17.30 and bounce back. Next is resistance 18.30 which tested 3 times recently in a week
Why is Jay still being paid $12 million per year?
Lots of institutions shuffling the deck today
bought 1000 shares at 18.03. Will sell at 18.15
Another 20% gain coming Monday and Tuesday… this is going to be one of the top play for next week
Why did these guys go public - given profits and cash flow they should have stayed private and just milked the cash cow Don’t understand why ipo or why the stock price is in the gutter ?
sold again lol

"The most bizarre thing Jay said on the CNBC interview yesterday is that he views Rocket Companies as an ""ecommerce business"" similar to Amazon. Did anyone else see the interview? And what do you make of that comment? Seems he is reaching for something else because ""Fintech"" isn't sticking with investors."
"""Rocket Companies interacts with millions of Americans every year through our mortgage, real estate and personal lending businesses. More than 90% of those clients choose to come back to us time and again because of the experience we provide,"" said Jay Farner, Vice Chairman and CEO of Rocket Companies.

Lot of shorts exiting tomorrow as they will be needing to set new highs. Rocket 
"I'm getting a better understanding of this stock. It's the only stock I have down today. Just like every day. Down, down and down. Then a day comes along and it pushes up a dollar or so. Then day after day drops back down. There are no fundamentals tied to this stock. So, i have to day trade this to get my losses back. Then deploy to better opportunities."
#$%$ stock. I have 100000 shares
"Please see reddit stocks incl. RKT, AMC & GME...Forums..etc.."
Anybody who doesn't see this company as a money-making machine not only number one in home loans but now will be #1 in auto loan biz...

"""It will likely cost Rocket somewhere near $20 million to run two 60-second commercials on Sunday night. "" Also who knows how much they paid Tracy Morgan. Maybe they should had taken that ad Money and Tracy Morgan pay money and used the FUND to pay out quarterly Dividends to the Investors. Guess what RKT, asked Buick how they did paying millions to Celebrities like Tiger Wood, Shaq, and Manning to advertised a Car they don't even drive. You think Tracy Morgan need loans from RKT?"
The only good from next week is we will not see those lawsuit news 
Going to FLY to $20 PLUS!!!!!
Going to be huge today
Rocket auto news is out
90% net client retention rate
Finally UPGRADES!
The biggest concern of mine isn't that Rocket is a horrible stock. It is that it is a horrible stock in the middle of the largest stock market gains in human history. Capitalism has never been more overvalued than it is now. The S&P 500 are greater than a 39 PE! What happens when things eventually contract? Do we go to single digits?
"They have reserved 94,736,842 shares for issuance under their 2020 Omnibus Incentive plan which includes stock options (1/3 of which are vested after ipo anniversary) and RSU’s (restricted stock units) for key employees that will start vesting at the 2 year anniversary.

I sold all my shares and bought sprt. I'll be back after my house closing. Good luck to all
has anyone notice Yahoo news last lawsuit mention was 20 hours ago as of 12PM est. hopefully this BS would finally be over!
"Maturity date of master repurchase agreement is Oct. 9th, 2021. I typed it in my search but no news after the statement."

"Stick it to the shorts and the doubters, buyback a massive amount of shares of the most undervalued stock in the Universe!"
"No wonder that RKT is on the WallStreetBets Reddid boards today..Shorts, we are not selling today..That's it !"
"It is time for ownership to take radical steps to move the stock price. The primary problem is Dan's personal interest do not align with Rocket Companies. Dan needs to end the Tax Receivable relationship RHI has with Rocket that costs Rocket Class A part of their earnings. Also, he should sell back some Class D to Class A. THEN, Rocket should up the buyback to $2B. That will get the stock moving in the right direction for good."
ALERT! ALERT! RKT is crossing 50 Days Moving Average = STRONG BUY Signal is being generated. Stay tuned for more!

"this stock is like the engine that could. Going up hill pulling all the cars. You can do it, you can do it, go green. Even by a penny."
The Amazon of the financial world huh? Still waiting on that.
No way to sugarcoat it. Rocket is a horrible stock.
Rocket is such a disrespected company that Yahoo has failed for weeks to update its market cap from $2.5B to $35B. Even after I wrote their help desk tech team to make them aware of the issue. Rocket is definitely the Rodney Dangerfield of securities.
"Nelson-Look back at historical data and see this stock was in the 17's several times and shot right back in the 20's. You have not lost a thing until you sell. You did not buy a stock with a negative EPS, but a low PE and 4 billion in cash. Hold and don't look daily. They are growing slowly with a good plan."
"Fourth consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding guidance for closed loan, net rate lock volume, and gain on sale margins- Generated revenue, net of $2.7 billion and Adjusted Revenue of $2.8 billion¹- Delivered net income of $1.0 billion and Adjusted Net Income of $0.9 billion¹"
When are earnings exactly?
RKT should take out LDI while the stock is cheap. It would add 2 billion to its market cap and take out one more competitor.
RKT is only GOING UP..... from here..... SHORTS ARE DONE!!!If it stays low.... SURELY A BUY-OUT.... at any time!
"Generated revenue, net of $2.7 billion and Adjusted Revenue of $2.8 billion¹- Delivered net income of $1.0 billion and Adjusted Net Income of $0.9 billion¹"

I'll cover at 8 dollars
"Rocket Auto should be a big catalyst. Very similar to CarMax, Varoom and Carvana. So many people use these online car buying/selling sites. No issues and best prices!"
Congratulations to everyone who sold shares today
"Ready for an injection of hopium? Stop looking at daily charts. Look at the weekly charts. It has been trading sideways with 17.30-17.50 at the floor and 18.30 as ceiling for a sideways channel. It has been straddling the floor. But also look at the weekly charts. A slight upward channel began to form week of 7/19. It's weekly highs and lows trade within that channel, opening and closing in the middle. Then there was the spike week of 8/9, breaking the ceiling of that upward channel then dumped the next week with it's low bouncing off the floor of that channel. This week we closed above both the daily sideways channel floor and the weekly upward channel floor. Next week should be real interesting because of this. It could easily continue trading daily sideways, but also look at the weekly. If it closes next Friday below that upward channel floor, we'll likely continue sideways. If it continues straddling the floors, it needs to close next Friday in the 17.75-17.85 range."
Only red in my portfolio today
Can someone please articulate to me why is Rocket such a horrible stock? Please no shorts or one line clown responses. I want to hear from longs as to why they think we keep circling the drain here.
"Rocket Auto lists both Vroom and CarMax inventory. This is truly a Fintech platform as Rocket does not own the auto inventory but instead is brokering the deal using its software and marketing tools. If successful, the marketplace can gain additional customers and inventory. These are the types of scaling I like as they do not requiring much additional capital to grow!"
When will this stock do something?
"I was previously looking to exit my whole position on any spike. I did sell some which now I wish I didn't. I will be holding now. This is probably their best move yet. While the housing market swings up and down, cars/trucks are constant! RKT companies x 2 !!"
"This should open up properties and force some folks into house hunting: The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday blocked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s eviction moratorium, thereby opening the door for property owners to evict residents behind on rent amid the pandemic."
"I learned a big lesson on rocket. I’ve let my emotions over take results. Trapped myself in this trade with 8000 shares. 21.95 and I’m out. Hopefully it can get here before tapering starts. Otherwise, going to have to book a loss and move on. Any words of sensible encouragement? Why will this ever perform if it couldn’t the last 8 months?"
This could get a nice short squeeze pop if the WSB people hop back on and drive it like AMC and GME .
What a strong day I mean indexes
if it ever see 18 again sell it asap!!
Opened up margin account
what is rkt market capcity???
This stock is going to be great but if you try and day trade or option trade you will lose your as**! Now take my advice buy with cash and hold long.
Maybe tomorrow we will go up 50%
NEWS OUT SOON!!!!! GOING TO FLY to the MOON!!!!!
Nelson and Kelly are the same person I am convinced
Look at Toll Bros after hrs. They hit it out of the park. Home sales slowing???? HA Now look at RKT up 12 cents after Toll Bros report.
Only thing gained here is a tax write off.
"Lol, sold 20 puts at .20 yesterday. easiest $400 in less than 24 hours."
Is the buyback limited to the public shares or does it include the holdings of Gilbert. & co
Now that Dan has taken the company into the auto and solar sectors..... I could DEFINATELY see a buy out....by his Good Friend Warren Buffet!!!! Great addition to the Steady Profit Making Portfolio that Buffet has built.BUY OUT $30 PLus
$RKT needs a page from the $AMC $GME playbook.
Buy order in! Ten dollars!
If the evaluation is 2.5 bill that means buy buy buy
"Rocket Auto's marketplace format gives buyers the ability to view various makes and models, at every price point, from an incredibly diverse network of dealers. In the coming months, it will also be the only marketplace to provide buyers the ability to self-service, handling the entire process from beginning to end regardless of what dealer the vehicle comes from."
Should see 18.5 my dad says this week and must likely tomorrow
SHORTS better COVER...This is the LAST CHANCE

"Look at Upstart Holdings since IPO. I honestly thought this is how Rocket would trend. Upstart is a true Fintech. Hopefully, we will get there in the next 3-5 years."

"Down another day. Please spike to 21.98. I will be gone. Mark this post. My gut says I will be here for a while.Seriously, the company is profitable every quarter yet goes down over the last five months during explosive growth in the market. There's something wrong here."

Over 18 should be on rocket auto portal today
Only thing I’ve earned is a write off.
I heard about RKT the other day on (http://Thetraderguide.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.
Keeping it under 18 is the theme. Done 
Pure manipulation
20 is dream and 30 is miracle and 40 is can’t even think off
we are almost 1 year in IPO. hope they drop some good news
Eventually this will breakout from this beautiful base.

Same lawsuits showing on our Rocket page are also showing on Vroom's page. (Vroom's autos are in part financed via Rocket Auto). Somebody or some entity has it out for Rocket Companies. Can we discover what is going on?
They say it happens over night!
E Trade changed margin requirements from 100% to just 60% todayShould this be a positive or negative sign???
"I really like the thing ,you know that thing the rocket thing!! Go rocket"
Yahoo is showing the wrong market cap for Rocket. Take a look. They are calculating the share price times the class A shares only.
I have faith this will jump. Bought another 1000 shares and will sell those at 18.03
"Jay was just on CNBC. I only caught the last 2 minutes, but things sounded ok for rocket auto."
BOUGHT 2000 SHARES AT 17.56
Hope Rkt doesn’t come up with another business line! I don’t have patience to lose another dollar on stock price 
Missing Nelson’s view today. One of the best on this board. True and reality view of RKT.
"great outlook ,great numbers. even better news they say they have over4 billions plus that they can buyback shares which they started already and possible give a future dividend"
headline news the fed powell confirm low rates coming years great for housing boom news next 3 to 4 plusyears
Triple top around 18.35 last 2 days. It best break out today.
No int rate hikes until 2023 per CNBC just now.
Total waste of money I meant.
Let's move this to 19. 4 hours left
"Buybacks and lawsuit dismissed or settled for some cash, leaving a stronger company with fewer shares and no more faux issue holding it back."
Allright gentleman is there any hope here or should we just load up on our whiskey until next earnings?
CEO is very strong on interviews - almost at the Alan Mullaly level!
Think about this for a minute. Rocket has done $16B in EBITDA just over the past 4 quarters. Forget about 36 years in business. Just over the past year they have generated about 1/2 the market cap in EBITDA since going public.
"I was worried about my shares being called away on Friday ($19 and $19.50 CCs) so I thought I was offered an opportunity to close my CC option contracts when the share price dropped 5% on Monday. I sold some puts (8/27 @$18.50) and I am hoping the share price should climb before the weekend. I say this because put contract volume is relatively higher in comparison to call option contracts. I interpret it as stabilization in share price or slightly upward momentum at the least and also I think the Q2 report and what the management has said on Thursday (i.e. having decent amount of cash available from Q1 as well as Q2 may be redirected towards buyback program). This is heavily a regressed stock. I think the longs are favored slightly and the shorts are more concerned in the coming days as long as there is no negative sentiment building in the stock market. I don’t think the shorts will rush to push the stock price downward. If the general market does well decently, the stock price should not dip as before. I will guesstimate that $RKT’ share price will visit low $20s in the next two weeks."
What I wouldn't give to have sprt right now

What we need is for Gilbert to make all one share class so we can go on the s & p
Will this ever be respectable? I’d give anything for low $20s at this point.
Bought 1000 more at 17.94
This is the worst investment of the year for me. Totally worthless investment
Facebook was below its IPO price 15 months after going public. Now it is a 10x bagger. I am hoping there is a similar story for Rocket Companies. 2030 maybe not a 10x bagger but I think a 5x to 6x bagger isn't out of the question.
have u ever seen such a DISMAL stk performance?
"Existing homes sales rose 2% last month from June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.99 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. That’s greater than the 5.82 million economists were expecting, according to FactSet."
Green by the end of the day!
"An increase in July housing starts added to the Dallas-Fort Worth area’s construction totals for 2021.Through the first seven months of the year, construction has started on more than $16.7 billion in D-FW real estate projects — an increase of 22% compared with the same period last year, according to the latest estimates from Dodge Data & Analytics.More than 30% of this year’s building start increases have come in the residential sector, where $10.6 billion in projects have kicked off."
Buy and Hold. Set Sell Limit at $52.

Rocket  the place for homes! They are cross selling everything and they make $$$$$! When you control that much you become the standard!
Up 30% tomorrow
Approaching LT Capital Gains. Might as well hold forever now.
"I love it, but not sure I understand the rise on a miss but i will take it as I am long wayyyy to many shares"
Don't expect a cool down any time soon in the housing market. The rumor of higher interest rates did not pan out when reported on Aug. 18th. The 30 year fixed morgage slipped to 3.04% compared to 3.08%. The 52 week high was 3.37% so buyers still want to lock in these lower rates since home prices continue to skyrocket. Where's the slowdown? Where I live prices are high with multiple offers in one day and the bidding wars are non stop. I don't think it has hit its peak yet.
At 17.30 again let’s see. My buy order at 17.29
"Tried rocket a few months ago and was not pleased…a good portion of my income comes from my employers stock grants (my employer is a nasdaq 100 publicly traded company), rocket rejected the loan because it didn’t know how to properly evaluate my Stock grant. I eventually found someone else to do it and the rate was better than RKT."
Looking at level 2 I'm not seeing any major sell orders holding us down!
buy the dip for tomorrows drop  
I love the red rocket
"RKT should be in it's own category. They are so much more than a mortgages company. This makes it very hard to compare them to UWMC. Will they be successful? Time will tell! But, I am bullish on both $RKT and UWMC because both have hit the bottom on their share price!"
SRPT same action as RKT in March. Not too smart to short with Reddit crowd.
"REDDIT: ""Rocket is Ready for Take Off"""
What do you think the underwriters (Morgan Stanley-Golman Sachs-Credit Suisse) are telling their clients about their RKT investment. Morgan formed a small partnership with RKT and E Trade clients while Credit Suisee lowered the price target from 28 to 23. Goldman hasn't said much but all of the underwriters credibility has been tarnished somewhat. They all say to hold. Time will tell but being under the IPO after several months seems like a total flop. Jay can talk the talk.
There is no news. Shorts don't need to cover until it drops another dollar.
30 minutes to close and it's at 17.51. Only off by 2 pennies now.
everything I own is green. Except.... Can anyone guess?

"So the #1 lender with #1 customer and #1 employee satisfaction, working with historically low rates and historically high home values is being disrespected and doubted?"
