"As days passes, 20 is becoming dream! Forget abt 30 and 40 "
Anyone know the short interest here??
Now many people out from rkt and buy others
"Dan Gilbert would love for RKT to hit $12/share, he can take the company private again as he did 20 years ago. DG is the smartest man in finance."
we're did everyone go  
buy at 2.00 only
"I'm having deja vu here at RKT! Kermit, bcool, fun, Rob, Bob Haven (sorry if I left anybody out) All these people were here before our run to $42! Let's see how it turns out this time:) I think it's going to get exciting here at RKT!"
I still believe
"Many in this board are super negative in Rocket …. I just bought 20,000 shares at $15.35. Will sell at $17.50 before earnings !! Load up the truck boys and girls. Rocket will soon take off like a rocket "
RKT should have never ran to $42 so quickly! Most of the people who bought at that level should have either sold at a loss or averaged down! If anyone has not sold buy this time then most like they are not going to sell no matter how low the price goes. The bottom should be very close.
The same bots post all day everyday lmao.
"just be patient just keep buying one of these day you going to get a bigbig booom this is so so so undervalue,thisstock goingto have earning per share over $3 to 3.50 a share in 2021 and 2022 and2023 and so on, thiswill be over$200 to $250 to $300 stock coming year once more analyist follow them andlush thestock up"
Go to $22
"There will be a dividend. But, it will be permanent!"
Still at 17.30
"Rocket Companies is a ""BUYOUT TARGET""Min. $35/Share.... JUST HOLD AND BUY"
"well hit down 40,000.00 worse mistake in my investing career. Is there any reason I don't just take the loss and move on? Serious thoughts please. I don't need reinforcement of my mistake believing in this company including the leadership."
"Why RKT Is a Win Win! Most People Bought RKT Because Rates Are Low! But, When Rates Begin To Rise Is When The Tech Part of The RKT Business Will Become Very Valuable! People Will Use It Much More When They Need To Search For The Best Rates When Rates Are On The Rise! Just a Little Food For Thought That Makes This RKT Gal Very Excited;)"
I am planning to buy $LC lending club in the dips. Rkt should acquire it..
Nelson my dear .i talk to you and please flow my idea .i book loss more then 183000 usd .first i buy 10000 k @27 then average till 18.35 and i wait near to 7 month with invest very big amount.last week i sold all my position and buy msft gm amd and appl .
"Nearly every post I make here is censored and removed. I want to discuss potential catalysts for RKT to get feedback from others, but not allowed for some reasons. What's up with that?"
Dan Gilbert's wealth is tied to this stock.He will not let this stock fall to zero.RKT is a long-term investment strategy.
Going back to $20
last time u 15s
Dow up +300. Rocket up 1 Penny! Such is the life of a Rocket shareholder.
How much % of amazon Jeff owns?
"Only some catalyst will save from further drop. It broke all our low assumptions and no guts to say this is the bottom  I invested on this with 401k loan amount at 4.5% interest rate. and it fooled me so far, everyday! I want to add more but no money and can’t dare to sell some other stocks to move here. At least I sold dozen of good running stocks to avg down this so far and tired "
new 52 week lows.. whats going on??
SHORT'S WIN. long loses
"prediction - this thing touches the 14.90's today and triggers a ton of stop losses, and then explodes higher from there! well, maybe not a prediction and more like a hope."
Remember Jay said undervalued at 40. Greatest lie by any ceo. Sorry folks who invested based on his cnbc interview few months ago at 40.
Investor place website working harder than RKT management and pr team to pump this stock 
Explode to the UPSIDE... next stop $18 Rocket is being Watched... BUY OUT TARGET
"Anyone invested in RKT needs to read today's wall street journal, page b12. This article explains exactly what's going to happen in RKTS profits (down) going into the future. Basically, RKT will be receiving less In commissions on each loan as they sell their loans to Fannie Mae after they originate them. I'm sure all the large hedge funds that are invested in RKT are also reading this article this morning. Monday could be brutal for RKT"
"All Fintechs are flying recently (Upstart, SoFi, Lending Club, and others). They are all based in California and a true tech companies. They specialize in software, AI, or scaled platforms. Jay just runs his mouth about being a tech company in downtown Detroit. I said this all along, Rocket is a great company and profitable but they have to look more like Upstart and less like PennyMac. They need to get a satellite campus in Silicon Valley and start selling their software and developing AI for their personal loans division. Do Fintech STUFF HELLO!!!"
"Nelson just reviewed last conference call Rocket had in august 2021. Julie Booth disclose they had 4.4 billion that could be used as investments, dividends or buybacks. They did announce a 1 billion buyback in November 2020. Please review as this to me indicates a portion of this money could be used as a buy back. At 15 bucks it would not likely be Dan’s 1.85 billion D shares."
"no dividend, no chance to move up."
Wow just think of the market corrects this thing will be cut in half.
All I know is that they make billions of dollars. It is the sentiment of the mortgage industry. I just don't understand why this company isn't doing anything about its stock. Go back private.
quicksand!
"From JPM earnings today: Average loans were down 6% year on year, but up 2% quarter on quarter with portfolio additions now outpacing prepayments. It was another strong quarter for originations totaling nearly $42 billion, up 43% year on year, reflecting record purchase volume and share gains in the refi market."
RKT longs would make great captains at sea. Always willing to go down with a sinking ship
As interest rates rise so will the bottom line for both RKT and $UWMC. Enjoy this beautiful journey we will be taking over the next couple of years:)
Cheap at 40 but can’t dare to buy at 15 
this company is finished! all investors are slowly getting out!!
They had some interesting insights about RKT on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Honestly so disappointed in Rocket. I can't sell as I am down -160K with a price of $24. Most all other stocks I am following but don't own are up 200-500% over that same time. I am down -30%. It hurts but I really can't go anywhere at this point.
RKT Consistently ........TOTES A LOT OfTimmmmmmmmmmmmberrrrrrr
"Now... if you truly believe:""No Company is looking to aquire ROCKET MORTGAGE at a BARGAIN price""Keep shorting.... otherwise...... it might be prudent to hold and/or buy!!!!!Many Financial institutions and others such as AMAZON are eyeing the #1 Mortgage Lender in the Country!"
I just closed out my RKT refinance. Second time I’ve done business with RKT. They are so easy to do business. The software used is so easy to input all financial information. It took 10 days to get my Refi to be approved. Met a Notary to sign the refi docs. Got the check in 2 days. A regular brick snd mortar bank would have taken three times longer. A big RKT supporter.
"I want to share something that happened to me with UPST that started to look the same on Friday. Upst dropped from 90 down to 32.00. I had 300 shares at the time. I was #$%$ but started buying aggressively leading up to the 32.00. I accumulated 2000 shares. It was several days before the earnings call. I noticed about two weeks before the volume started exceeding the 50 day average. Then on the earnings call the stock took off after hours because the announced an acquisition. It went to 102.00 in an hour. I put a stop loss that night at 95 and unfortunately it just barely dipped down and took me out. I was very happy, this was my best hit ever. I do wish I stayed in because it?s at 320 a share now but 130,000 in an hour is still a nice victory. So, RKT just did the same thing. They pushed the stock the last four months down from 21 plus to 15.86 on low volume. Just like what they did to UPST. Then the volume picked up over the 50 day moving average for no reason. We can hate or love this stock but the reality is the thieves in NY play us individual investors. I think something is beginning to build here. It has nothing to do with any fundamentals or interest rates. If I?m right, this stock is about to pop. Check out my facts and timing on upst and you will see I?m correct. Let?s see but it?s identical to upst."
Just Saw A RKTShareholder.....OUT In PUBLIC
The same 4mm shares traded every day.
zero is the bottom I think  could go lower knowing rkt 
"I learned this the hard way, if RKT management was so convinced that their stock was undervalued then they would have a large buyback program and insiders would be buying heavily. Neither is happening. If the company is not purchasing their own stock then what makes this a great investment for shareholders?? 10-year treasuries hit 1.6% today and rkt hit a day low of $15.13. RKT is a great company and the nation's, probably the world's largest mortgage broker but as an investment for your retirement account, not such a good idea."
What does rkt SP do as prime rate increases?
sold
In case anybody needs to know the bottom is in for both UWMC and $RKT
"What I have noticed is that Rocket isn't yet good at being a public company and playing the earnings game. You want to estimate low and beat. Rocket instead gives their best estimate and slightly misses each quarter. Now for the quarter ending Sept 30th, the original estimate was .38 cents but Rocket has updated their figures so now analysts have .49 cents. Jay doesn't know how to run a public company!"
Happy Rocket is up 1 penny because it is not down 75 pennies!
how's everyone holding up?
The drop from 17.30 is fast and frustrating 
With current trends. I wonder if at some point I might start to owe money for the privilege of owning RKT shares and have to start paying payments like a mortgage.
Remember we all trolled that analyst few months ago when downgraded to 12 when it was trading at 19 
"Trainwreck. My condolences to the bagholders. The ones who still think this is a great stock, you get what you deserve Nimrods.."
"Every time it looks like it wants to bounce off the lows, it then goes right back down. Very bearish even at the 52-week low as the floor still hasn't been set."
Still not yet there and target is still 16 before end of this week.
My LC position so far doing good. Got in 2 weeks ago. My sofi also doing good and only failure is CPNG. It will also run soon long term play
Sofi 
Lending club LC - 7% up. My cost is 26.60
"For being a well known name and 30 billion market cap, this thing looks so manipulated."
Look at the LOW LOW VOLUME....Those who KNOW..... are JUST HOLDING..... we will be paid GOLD soon!!!!!
Just Get It Over With......SELLAnd......
sell ur 3cent pop and move on 
"Rocket Mortgage. Rocket Auto Loans. Rocket Home Insurance. Rocket Home Equity Credit Card. Rocket Brokerage. The downside risk at this price point is very low, while the upside potential is exponential....particularly if you think the days of the old brick and mortar banks and insurance companies is coming to an end. Hopefully, Rocket is holding on to the adjustable rate mortgages in their asset portfolio and selling off the fixed interest rate mortgages."
why is this so low? it's dirt cheap. only 5 PE ratio.
September is almost over. I'm ready for October! UWMC and $RKT are going to Rock! Bring it on baby;)
"Below are 2nd quarter result.- Generated revenue, net of $2.7 billion and Adjusted Revenue of $2.8 billion¹- Delivered net income of $1.0 billion and Adjusted Net Income of $0.9 billion¹"

"Being artificially kept down, will explode in the next 6-12 months."
guess what's on the way and don't act so surprised...
Hahaha People still have no clue how over valued this stock is. Company shouldn’t be worth more then $15Billion
"i'm about to sell all my shares, so get ready for rocket to liftoff. always happens that way"
"Is RKT's PE really only 5.3?Biggest Mortgage Company in America, Really?Why?"
never see 20s again!!
"I’ll enjoy holding for 4 years. Gonna be nice return. Allow me to retire at 53. Most on this thread, “I want a million dollars tomorrow.” Might as well whine, “I want a pony.” Relax and enjoy the steady climb that is eventually coming."
"I'm still holding. Homes will continue to be bought and sold, and apps like Rocket will continue to take market share in the real estate industry. This company will grow and expand geographically where others cannot. If you look at the 25 yr chart of US home sales you'll see a nice upward trend. We had a special lift during the pandemic recovery, and things are evening out after that, but the long trend is up. This will continue in the long run."
"Option sellers made out perfectly with exactly $15. Congrats to the manipulators. Fridays are so predictable. What a great bargain for a profitable company that has shown it can increase market share in a rising rate environment. I forgot to mention, they have recruited an army of Realtors and Insurance brokers across the country that can now originate purchase and refi loans on their platform. This is just starting to bear fruit. Be patient and Accumulate. Probably not a good stock for quick money, but I think a GREAT stock for long term wealth. The Amazon of finance. I just had a loan close for over $500k with them and I spent about 2 hours originating it and following up with the buyer. People go back to them over and over.....my boots on the ground have shown me this."
Just like I predicted $14.98 hahaha
A year ago they were knocking on banks and lowering their price targets. Those companies are now up 100+ percent in many cases. Nothing changed except the gloom that they keep predicting for them didn't come. It's all a game.
"BUY ALL YOU CAN... : Game is overRKT - USA Stock USD 15.12 0.12 0.80%The current analyst and expert consensus on Rocket Companies is Buy with 4 hold recommendations. The current projected Rocket Companies target price consensus is 70.5 with 10 analyst opinions. One of the most common ways Rocket Companies analysts use to provide buy-or-sell recommendation to the public are conference calls analysis and financial statements evaluations. Some experts can also talk to Rocket Companies vendors, executives, and/or customers. Rocket Companies recommendation module provides expert sentiment on the projected Rocket Companies target price to derive its highest and lowest estimates based on target price standard deviation of 7.891. Additionally, take a look at Macroaxis Advice on Rocket Companies to cross-verify analyst projections. Unlike analyst recommendations, Macroaxis provides advice only from the perspective of investor risk tolerance and investment horizon."
"I agree with Nelson and others below. The stock performance and the EBITDA are completely divorced from one another, and have been for far too long. Management needs a new approach that will result in a stock price that accurately reflects company performance. If the current management can't do that, they need to be replaced. The market is overflowing with companies that have good prospects but no profits and yet sell at unbelievable premiums. It is extraordinarily frustrating to see a very profitable company languishing from one month to the next."
$UPST - Cracks $330....only up 712% year to date 
Most overvalued stock in the market lol
Danny boy says the buy back is on hold. gotta build the lions a new dome 
"Is this a true statement? Gilbert owns more than 70% of the Rocket family of companies, under which Quicken Loans, the Cleveland Cavaliers, and Bedrock Real Estate are all housed, and which went public earlier this year, sending Gilbert's personal fortune into the stratosphere.Rocket Companies does not own the Cleveland Cavs right?"
"For sure no one going to trust these once in a blue moon Green Days, until it run up 1 week in a row"

"In the last earnings call at 18, Jay told its way undervalued and they have tools to fix it with potential buyback and acquire. Just curious what he gonna say at 15  repeat the same script and end the call sooner "
"RKT will plummet down to earth T-minus 1 hour,. $13 gd speed"
almost 14s after hrs!
I can't believe I would be missing $17 dollars so much!!!
"hi, my name is RKT!"
Who bought at $25?
We're well on our way to single digits here. Enjoy the ride
Not sure why on yahoo it shows the market cap of 2.09 B?
Rocket made in 1 year (2020) $10B dollars which is the entire Market Capitalization of UWM Corp. ($10B)
"Into the ground this thing goes haha, oh man. New lows coming today no doubt, single digits by EOY"
"Remember when this was $18 and a bunch of these folks say, buy this dip, this stock is a steal at this price? Today is another good reminder how bad this stock really is. When the market goes up, RKT goes down. When the Market goes down, RKT goes down. Now imaging what will happen to this when the Fed finally raises interest rates and weakens the Refi and New purchase MTG."
"If you had the choice, would you rather RKT merge with Upstart to take over the lending market or with Salesforce and compete against Upstart and SoFi???"
congrats guys. That was a huge move up today
u can't stop a downward momentum stock..
Dan I hope his health goes down the drain just like everyone’s investment did.
Barclays raises from $18 to $19 Target!!!!
I'm thinking it will above 16 by Friday ..
Trading or investing in RKT1) JUST HOLD2) Be Patient3) COLLLECT HUGE $ as Rocket will be BOUGHT!!!!!! VERY SOON!!!!
"Buy oil, tech, retail, anything but Mortgage fake fintech wanna be. your welcome!"
The structure of this company is more less private. You have 1.99 billion shares outstanding that are D shares mainly owned by the Gilbert family. These shares are not traded in the market. Only A shares are traded with. 136 million shares outstanding. The float is about 130 million shares which is only a little more then 6 percent of the company. No big outsider will ever enter this picture unless Dan Gilbert sells some of those D shares and converts them to A shares. Rocket can’t even be in the S & P 500 because you have to trade at least 10 percent of the shares.
BIG NEWS MONDAY $$$$$$$$$$
"rkt is only 5 percent pe ratio with earning per share over 3.50in annual year in 2021 ,they will earn over $3.50 a share every year next 5 years , while every stock on nasdaq and ny pe ratio at 35.00 to 45.00 all the stock analyist will put a price buyout target soon .too toocheapnot to betaken over by a hedgefund like billionier icahn they will be taken over soon in 2022 before 2022 probably in the $50 to $60 range fund"
You know as soon as you sell. $UWMC and RKT will both take off like a rocket! United We Make Cash!
"Target of 7 dollars taking a bit longer than expected, nevertheless stock price is still headed in that direction. New lows nearly every day."
"Many of my posts are being censored so I guess I'll just write more of them. Over the past two years, RKT had probably the most financial success in its history with billions of dollars of profits per quarter. On June 15, 2020, the 10 yr yield hit .70 basis points, 30-year rates fell to as low as 2.5%, gain on sale of the mortgage from RKT to Fannie Mae was as high as 4.73%. The average mortgage was $270,000 so RKT made on $100 million in loan volume, $4.73 billion in profit. Going forward and you can verify this through RKT financial transcripts, that spread will fall to approximately 2.5% from 4.73% so instead of making 4.73 billion, their profits will fall to $2.5 billion (not too shabby). This is great for RKT but not for shareholders. Yes, they will continue to write billions and billions of mortgages per year, and have the best technology to underwrite these mortgages, but they cannot control if someone needs to refinance or not. For example, do you need to remortgage your house right now???? Would you take out your equity to invest in this stock market??? How awful would you feel if you took out $100,000 of your home's equity and bought RKT at $22/share, specifically when Jay Farner states on CNBC that their stock is significantly undervalued. The only people that will need to refinance to a higher rate (and there are millions) are people that have high-interest rate credit card balances or people that want to remodel their kitchen and or bathrooms at a 3.5% interest rate instead of a Wells Fargo unsecured remodel loan at 9.5%. Everybody that currently owns RKT stock is significantly underwater. There is not one person that is breakeven or that has a profit in it. Be careful of the hype and as always protect yourself and your family from the rosy future outlooks of these companies."
UNREAL.....Dow Up Almost 450 Points.Rocket... RED...I'm SO LUCKY Not To Own This Anymore..
"I really don't get people claiming ""They're rebuilding Detroit!"" like it's some kind of horror show. I don't care what the CEO does with his money. It's his money, and also rebuilding Detroit sounds like a great action. What I care about is, will RKT continue to earn and grow? Yes it will."
Anyone else posts have been deleted on RKT???
"told you, it's a scam!"
Anybody else green on this baby!
As soon as senate passes the debt.. watch n learn.. stocks soar back. Unless u have a gambling problem and can't hold more than 5 seconds BUY And Hold. Once passed boom stocks this one 17 18. Make easy bank
"Looks like we're paying for yesterday's gains. Now we're back to square negative one, and going deeper and deeper into debt..."
Nearly $20B in EBITDA over the past 6 quarters with a Market Cap of $30B. Unbelievable!
4 more minutes to hit a $14 handle
Could RKT and SoFi come together to compete against UPST?
@bcool123 When did you reduce your position?
is this undervalue or what pe ratio only 5.5 yet every other stock is a 35 to 45 pe ratio just a matter of time buyers will will buy this cheap cheap stock
"Get out of this trash before it hits $14, we are likely to have a nice end of year run through Q1 of 2022, so if you cut your losses here (for tax offset of gains) you can then move what's left to real companies that will benefit from the Q4/Q1 run! But it is dead money here, and god forbit what will happen when the fed has to raise interest rates."
"Sell this and move on. 6 Rafi picks to buy now: ASAN, WIRE, UPWK, APPS, TREX, ALLY."
"Facts are RKT is a mortgage company first and has the technology built into its platform to sustain leadership in the sector and to maintain best of bred. Its side companies will generate billions in near future, RKT is not a fintech company ... Yet. In no way did Farner did not Lie about anything hence those bS lawsuits fizzled awa and if you invested it to think you are smarter than the street (bcool) you are a nimrod.This company is printing billions and it is completely undervalued.... LONG TERM juggernaut here and time and patience will reap rewards... Investing is long term success...but short term its a hell of a trading tool as well"
Currently down $-200K on a $580K investment into Rocket. Sick to my stomach but holding off selling as to not realize this loss. But it definitely hurts right now.
New 52-week LOW!!!
"Due to the lack of bullish posts today, I'm going to assume they're now all bankrupt, had their internet/electricity cut off or potentially had their homes repossessed altogether. Call the Samaritans if you're feeling down and can't tell your loved ones the truth about your finances. Hope you're all holding up okay, you were warned plenty of times."
"Tv commercials and Detroit are the only 2 things management knows. When investors force, thy come up with some timber new line of businesses just for tax harvesting purpose"
Strong hands have stepped in and determined yesterday was the bottom
Why no bounce at all. Something very wrong is going on. Anyone know what’s holding this down for so long without a bounce?
Still Rkt is my biggest position. It has future but very slowly and don’t expect it to be 20 in coming weeks or months. I went too much bullish and lost big money. When they say fintech thought like upst. Lesson learned this is slow rich company
"BUY BUY BUY!!!!! I believe this is a New Business!!! ""ROCKETFLOOD"" Insurance....https://www.rocketflood.com/"
$18 today.... just be patient
CEO lacks fiduciary responsibility to shareholders
forever Red!!
"SHORTED this stock since back in mid march , i would like to thank . rocket leadership for my massive gains keep up the great work."
don't short my company lol! got everyone to jump on board for the ride down!!
"Think about this for a moment. Rocket made nearly $10B in 1 year. (2020). Of course we all know that that may never be repeated again to that level. Regardless, that is still real money. Some people are saying Rocket should be $15B Market Cap. So $10B for the 1 year and then $5B for the past 35 years plus future earnings. Makes absolutely no sense. You can't discount the real money that has been made already. Sure you can taper down future expectations but you can't ignore real money."
In early November they report earnings along with the CC. It will be very interestingto see how many shares have been purchased by the company. They have authorized 2 - 1 billion dollar buybacks since going public. If no shares have been purchased they must be anticipating a rough market for the stock. Hopefully I am wrong!
Sofi 10% up upgraded. Fintech
I hope Jay and Dan go bye bye from this earth
"@Nelson Sorry you are down so much on this stock that has done nothing but go down. May I ask why you went all in so heavily on RKT? What was your investment thesis and has it changed? You seem like a smart and level headed guy, was wondering what your thought process was. I too went heavily on this. I started buying around $23, after it pulled back from the squeeze, thinking I was being patient and waiting for a dip to get in. That dip never stopped dipping and I just kept averaging down and here we are at $15."
I've never in my whole life of trading have seen a stock trade as poorly as this one. What's particularly interesting is it's a company that is profitable. Dan and Jay are completely incompetent in leading this company. That's also strange because they had the ability to start the company. I think Dan should bring in new leadership. Dan and Jay have taken this company as far as their talents can go. New leadership would be welcome news to the NY group that really dislikes them.
"Upstart Financial has 500 employees is a 10x bagger over the past 6 months, has nearly the same market cap as Rocket and they are venturing into mortgage lending. A true Fintech vs a Jay mortgage / marketing company. Embarrassed I am such a poor investor!"
I am keep telling don’t chase to average down the falling knife and don’t sell kidneys for that. Many other names in the market to invest. I stopped adding month ago and diversifying
I can't believe I got in at $40.
I think the market doesn’t like this one because of the share structure. It is definitely a good company and it really is the OG of fintec
Please break 20ma and 50ma before the earnings and then 200ma after earnings 
reverse split 3 to 1 all the banks land money for mortgage it's not only rkt
Upstart best IPO in last 12 months. IPO in DEC -2020 at $20 up 1480% since. ($ 316)
A stock buyback or a perpetual dividend announcement will be the saving grace for this stock.
Don't be surprised..... I've said it many times..... BUY OUT!!!! Jay & Dan will WIN BIG!!!!
Piper downgraded yesterday and raider eps today! What a joke.
Yahoo lists long-term debt at 25 and a half billion down from 27 and a half billion last quarter... that's billion with a b... almost 3 billion in cash... why is it that market pundits never comment on this.... maybe this impedes stock appreciation or is it just the market and interest rates? was it Morgan Stanley that dumped some 10 million shares at $25 6 months ago? just asking honest questions before taking a position at these lows.... the other choice is OPEN.
"THANK Goodness Reddit SAVED Me On This....Otherwise, I'd Be Down 150K + Now.....NO FUTURE..... 2 Much Competition...Rising Rates.. Decreasing Margins.."
Down over 10% in a week. I'm guessing it closes below $15 by Friday. Worst managed company.
whoever selling the stock now at a loss is really not investor just a trader... you better off going to the casino at least you'll get free drinks sometimes
Sofi running towards 20  quickly from 13 
This company has strangely huge debt of $25B which I missed during valuation:Enterprise Value = Market Cap - Cash + debt= $31B + $25B - $2B = $54BNo wonder the stock is dumping. what does a service/software company take a $25B debt for?
It has to break 15.90's to see higher
whos goin down wit the rkt 
It's Friday. Let's have some fun! What is your Rocket stock price in 5 years? 10 years?
"WOW.... Shorts here just don't stop commenting....Fear is Near.... BUY OUT is Eminent at this PRICE. Any day, any minute any second.... NEWS CAN COME OUT!"
Sold all my rkt 120000 k and rotation to msft & appl @ gm&amd
"$RKT's short shares availability is up by more than 10% recently. As I said in the link, the volume of options contracts are low for the coming weeks which probably has an impact on the rising stock price even though it may be slow. Why did the short-sellers not attempt to short the stock while the borrowing fees and margin requirement have been sharply down lately? Something gives itchy, I guess!https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RKT/community?p=RKT&messageId=fb135035-9a96-4177-9456-84e8e2446a8b&bcmt=1"
Detroit is priority over their stock. Keep proving again and again. Shorts are doing right thing here….
BAGS !It's UPAH !
Yahoo finally fixed Rocket's Market Cap. Now can Jay and Dan fix Rocket? I doubt it!
Oh now it's doing a course correction? Really? Lets see how long this lasts...
Hope some buy back happing soon.. It has to reverse with billions of profits then what is use of it RIght?
Both RKT and $UWMC will be winners in the coming months. United We Make Cash!
Usually Friday here at $UWMC and RKT. Everyone go and have a great weekend!
Let's take a vote thumps up if you want me to start calling a daily bottom on $UWMC and RKT!
Hahahaha let's see how much lower you can go. You've all been warned for months and thought you knew better. The time of reckoning is near.
down on up days and down on down days what gives
"If u r real long, u should know why mortgage stocks are up today  comment the reason if u know! Testing who is real longs here "
"Both $UWMC and RKT will go up when everyone least expects it. Then everyone will say, ""I wish I had bought more"". It happens this way every time!"
futures are fried! 14.50 low midday
"Company likes to inflate numbers. In addition, Dan is literally rebuilding Detroit using YOUR money lol"
Buy back from class A to class D. Like moving your money from 1 pocket to another. And also that’s called indirect shorting.
Buying RKT has been the biggest regret of any investment I have ever had. Time to unseat this CEO & possibly BODs.
can we get a new low today!
"dan . Detriot needs ,or money sell some more shares"
My $13 puts are getting crushed. I am 17 years old first year of trading and now I'm losing my college money trying to short rkt junk into grounds red
I'd like this too except for 26 billion in debt which is a fact that seems to escape many... by the way there is a small Gap left this morning from 1529 to 1542.... it may or may not feel most gaps fill 90% of the time especially on lighter volume.
wow dude. was yesterday really the bottom? when i get more money I'll buy some.
Single digits inbound. Exciting times as always
Honest question. Am I insane to think this can go back up? Possibly mid to low $20s?
Rocket is a winner take my word
20% move up coming
"Rocket Home Insurance leveraging captive customers getting new home mortgage, and removing pain point for new home owners who don't have any buying power to negotiate low rates with insurance companies. Rocket Home Equity Credit Card with variable spending limit and interest rate tied to current value of home and prevailing market interest rates. Rocket stock brokerage, with new mortgage customers automatically getting money deposited in their new brokerage account based upon size of mortgage they purchased from Rocket. ROCKET has a lot of upside and should be viewed as a fintech company by the investor community rather than an old brick and mortar mortgage/bank company. PE multiple is way too low for the market leader in online mortgages, that consistently wins awards for offering the best customer satisfaction, versus the brick and mortar banks and other online mortgage companies."
Sold some Rkt and added more sofi. Slowly cutting down bags. Still Rkt is my biggest position in my account
"Very red market day! But, both UWMC and $RKT end green. I like it:)"
REDDIT!!!!! BUY BUY BUY
yet another bullish right up from investor place and yet again no mention of over $25 billion in debt.... why is that? and then they wonder why the stock is at its all time low in spite of the booming housing and low interest rates.... so what are they going to do for an encore...
goin out of business! 2 for 1 refinance 
all the longs keep disappearing 
congratulations longs! I just talked to Danny boy and he said the buy back starts at 3.99!!!  
14s today?
titanic down! 
They said 1B buyback. But sold half of it 500M at 25. with the money thy got with that sale now thy can buy back worth 1B. So there is no real back actually 
Bottom is in
last look at 15
"The same way things can't only go up and up, things also can't go down and down. It needs these bumps into green for the next leg down. All part of the play. The daily chart from 20th to 27th September shows exactly what I'm on about."
Here they come REDDIT!!! REVENGE
At least we are not getting punished like NVAX and BBBY. Oh my! Our RKT will be just fine!
reddit or no reddit rkt will plummet
reverse split soon 3 to 1
Sofi highest volume day in its trading history. Wish I see such days at RKT as well  so tht I can dump and move on 
Under valued and over sold
Kermit and facts of life are longs long gone  livin the good life after riding the rkt down!
"I've honestly learned my lesson here. PE and fundamentals means diddly. I'm just waiting for the right time to offset my gains with these losses for tax purposes. Not really a believe in this company anymore, just waiting for the right time to get out."
next stop 13s
ROCKET HAS CRASHED.
I buy at a 52 week low in what i consider a growing company. Any thing can happen. Something like what Sheldon Adelson of LVS fame did during the banking crises. He gave his LVS company one billion in cash and the stock shot off like a rocket. No pun intended.
I can feel the pressure building here at RKT! I like it:)
Really kind of criminal on Jay Farner pay. In 2020 he pulledIn 52 million dollars and should at least achieve that amount in 2021.Dan controls the whole company with 94 percent of shares. They are D shares and he gets 10 votes for one of our A shares which account for 6 percent ofthe other shares. It’s totally ran like a private company. Dan could bring a partner in and convert some of the D shares into the A. That certainly won’t happenat 15 bucks a share. Remember he wanted to sell more at 25. I think the shareholders that have the A shares will be stuck until something moves these shares. Buying the A shares back really doesn’t help much for Dan Gilbert. As shareholders of the A shares again we really only control 6 percent. This is very similar to a SPAC. Big lesson learned but very important to read before investing how the company is structured. I reviewed UWMC briefly and it has a messed up structure also.
"I realized the day traders and shorts are playing this stock daily. Push up mid day, bring all the way back and most days even lower. We longs have been in this cycle since last March. It’s going to take a day for some reason this stock pops up hard, 2-3-4-5 dollars and it flushes this daily practice out. Until then, it will continue day after day after day."
I never follow my own rules or advice but I always look back and think why didn’t I BUY when everyone else is selling?! Hoping the market will rebound by January.
"don't wait for the crash, take some off the table!"
"Open door 14 to 21, in 2 months. Zillow also moving up"
at this rate the stock should be at 0 in 3 weeks 
Buybacks and Very Good Earnings are my prediction +++
Rising interests rates are way overblown. 10 yr yield is 1.5% lmao and people are tanking a very profitable company on that.
ROCKET . 2$ 2022. DAN the man. looks like 14$ today. RED RED RED .
