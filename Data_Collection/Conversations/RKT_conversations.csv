have u ever seen such a DISMAL stk performance?
No int rate hikes until 2023 per CNBC just now.
Jay on CNBC tomorrow morning to talk about rocket auto
E Trade changed margin requirements from 100% to just 60% todayShould this be a positive or negative sign???
Rocket is such a disrespected company that Yahoo has failed for weeks to update its market cap from $2.5B to $35B. Even after I wrote their help desk tech team to make them aware of the issue. Rocket is definitely the Rodney Dangerfield of securities.
They had some interesting insights about RKT on (http://Rightpicker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
Nelson and Kelly are the same person I am convinced
This is looking to go lower. PT = 12
Is there any news besides lawsuits?
Why don't we launch like everyone else ????????????
How this so cheap?
WOW.... Jay talks about ROCKET AUTO tomorrow..... no wonder call options as high as $20!!!!!We will be pre-market $18.50 - $19.... then blow past $20
back to the tank bank  haha! 16s again
Rocket auto news is out
The biggest concern of mine isn't that Rocket is a horrible stock. It is that it is a horrible stock in the middle of the largest stock market gains in human history. Capitalism has never been more overvalued than it is now. The S&P 500 are greater than a 39 PE! What happens when things eventually contract? Do we go to single digits?
We still have 2 hrs to go and volume has already exceeded yesterday's. Buyers slowly coming in.
"When the home buying competition is fierce, a Verified Approval from Rocket Mortgage can help. #RocketCan"
Hope Rkt doesn’t come up with another business line! I don’t have patience to lose another dollar on stock price 
"Nasdaq t record highs and up almost 240 points today , yet we stay flat....Thanks for keeping promises Farner!"
Now that Dan has taken the company into the auto and solar sectors..... I could DEFINATELY see a buy out....by his Good Friend Warren Buffet!!!! Great addition to the Steady Profit Making Portfolio that Buffet has built.BUY OUT $30 PLus
"Down another day. Please spike to 21.98. I will be gone. Mark this post. My gut says I will be here for a while.Seriously, the company is profitable every quarter yet goes down over the last five months during explosive growth in the market. There's something wrong here."
SRPT same action as RKT in March. Not too smart to short with Reddit crowd.
"RKT should be in it's own category. They are so much more than a mortgages company. This makes it very hard to compare them to UWMC. Will they be successful? Time will tell! But, I am bullish on both $RKT and UWMC because both have hit the bottom on their share price!"
why is the stock up 10$ after hours buyout?
"It's been a while since I've felt positive about RKT. This news and the sales of cars and trucks on Rocket Auto is going to be the catalyst we need as shareholders. Rocket has the name and as soon as they start promoting this newer company (which they advertise quite a bit), they will take a huge share of online sales/purchases. Good news finally"
"Underperforming #$%$ By the way, what are the odds that the advertisements from the law firms are going to continue after today? I wouldn't hold my breath on them going away after today."
"""It will likely cost Rocket somewhere near $20 million to run two 60-second commercials on Sunday night. "" Also who knows how much they paid Tracy Morgan. Maybe they should had taken that ad Money and Tracy Morgan pay money and used the FUND to pay out quarterly Dividends to the Investors. Guess what RKT, asked Buick how they did paying millions to Celebrities like Tiger Wood, Shaq, and Manning to advertised a Car they don't even drive. You think Tracy Morgan need loans from RKT?"
I heard about RKT the other day on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). It’s looking like an interesting play.

everything I own is green. Except.... Can anyone guess?
Green by the end of the day!
"Tried rocket a few months ago and was not pleased…a good portion of my income comes from my employers stock grants (my employer is a nasdaq 100 publicly traded company), rocket rejected the loan because it didn’t know how to properly evaluate my Stock grant. I eventually found someone else to do it and the rate was better than RKT."
"Existing homes sales rose 2% last month from June to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 5.99 million units, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. That’s greater than the 5.82 million economists were expecting, according to FactSet."
The Amazon of the financial world huh? Still waiting on that.
Law suit deadline. All lawyers total client total is going to may be big zero. Investor who loss more than 100K in investment are not going to loose more money in paying lawyer’s fees.
BOUGHT 2000 SHARES AT 17.56
headline news the fed powell confirm low rates coming years great for housing boom news next 3 to 4 plusyears
so do the lawsuits end today or someting?
"I was previously looking to exit my whole position on any spike. I did sell some which now I wish I didn't. I will be holding now. This is probably their best move yet. While the housing market swings up and down, cars/trucks are constant! RKT companies x 2 !!"
come on DOWN!
