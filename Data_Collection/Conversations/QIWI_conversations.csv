"Recently volume has increased significantly, maybe some institution at play? I can't seem to find any news source"
"Are the dividends paid by QIWI classified as “Qualified” or “Ordinary”? “Qualified Dividends” are taxed at Capital Gains rates 0%, 15%, or 20%. “Ordinary Dividends” can be taxed at higher Ordinary Income tax rates. I believe QIWI’s headquarters is located in Cyprus rather than in Russia."
"Waiting for a little consolidation, then i will buy"
"""1y Target Est 902.00"". I'd be surprised if it reached that in rubles."
The bad.....QIWI hit another all time low $8.29 today. The good......QIWI bounced as high as $8.60. I took advantage of this and sold 25% of my position in QIWI. I need some short term loss to cover the short term gains that have been piling up since the first of the year.
"How much more pain can you stand ? Another new all time low today, $7.96 ! Ouch !"
"At the same time, Qiwi said that they expect to smooth out the effect of not receiving the ECUP status and continue working with the bookmaker market.“QIWI provides financial solutions for both partners - bookmakers and their clients. Already at the end of last year, we considered several scenarios for the development of the situation with CUPIS and worked out a plan that, in the medium term, will allow us to smooth out the effect of a possible closure of this direction, ""- quotes a representative of RBC.More details on BCS Express:https://bcs-express.ru/novosti-i-analitika/obval-aktsii-qiwi-i-dal-neishie-perspektivy"
QIWI lost 33% of it's bussiness totay with most profitable directions? P.E is goint to be above 100 in 2022. Game over. Price target near 0$
"QIWI pressed down to $8.84 today, closing in on its all time low of $8.62. The gov. annoited ""Mobil Card"" to handle all bets to bookmakers. This was a big piece of QIWI business. We need an update from QIWI management as to what this means to QIWI going forward ? Will they be able to survive this blow ?"
I can't evaluate this stock.. I can't decide if it's a huge waste of money or a gold mine....
Great sales of capital intensive business at 2.x times profit. 35% IRR is excellent. The profits will go to the bottom line.
"LadaNiva, I see by your last post on the ""Vincent"" thread that reality is coming into your mind. Anyone who thinks that a company that has suffered as much as QIWI has over the last several months is going to continue to pay a 12% to 14% dividend going forward is detached from the real world. After their run in with the central bank they announced a reduction of 20% to 30% in the dividend. They have now suffered an even greater blow over the ""bets"" business. Mid Nov. is a long way off to their next quarterly report. Without clarification from QIWI I see nothing that will prevent this stock from continuing to grind lower. Since 9/9 over 2.5M shares have traded lower than their previous historical low of $8.62. Thats 4% of all the shares. The buyers think they are getting a great deal and this will eventualy double. The sellers think the buyers are going down a rabbit hole. Which is it ? I sold 25% of my QIWI on the day this week when the share price jumped up $.50/share. In accord with the wash rule I can not purchase again until 10/14 or I will lose the tax benefit of the loss. So, I am sitting on the sidelines watching."
when the shares hit a P/E of $1 I guess they can just go public for fun wait two years and go public again. Twice the profit non of the pain.
"The chart for this firm looks terrible over any time period but the last few days. It seems to just constantly decline in value. Perhaps it's a scam to fleece investors. Why would we believe ""this time it's different"" when the chart shows a clear and constant decline since before the laws changed ?"
"I can hardly figure out the floor but I have no reason to panic sell unless they stop paying dividend. The last ER was pretty solid ""despite overall challenging environment."" Next earning will include their profit from Tochka Project, and I hope additional good news."
"Yahoo! Look at your eps trend 30 days ago. Does that look right to you? It is in rubles. Correct it. Go through all the ADRs you report and correct them all. I'd write a program to check the numbers and train your staff to use it, if you could afford me."
EPS is only 4 and yield 11%. Thai is pretty undervalued to me. If not going up we can collect dividend until goes up to $30.
they pay almost 14% in dividend and good long-term investment. what's the problem here?
How does it cost the ADR for QIWI each year?
Internal rate of return 35% and 2.x times of the original investment are excellent return on investment in selling the asseta.
