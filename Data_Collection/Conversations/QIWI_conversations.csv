"Keep the share price low so I can keep adding more. Just rolled over my dividend (showed up in my account today) into more shares. Hard to beat an 8.25% yield and 70-100% upside. Even if it stays at this price for the next 10 years, I will have done pretty well just with the dividend income alone."
"Here's my take. In 2020 it appears earnings per share was $1.92. They say ""adjusted net profit is expected to decrease by 15% to 30% over 2020."" OK, that's fair. They have some rules changes which seem to be about making their financial system more sound. Nothing wrong with that, and probably a good idea for their society. So, that means earnings per share should be in the neighborhood of $1.34 to $1.63. Generously, they want to distribute 50% of that as dividends. I think that puts the dividend in the 67 to 82 cent range for the year. Not bad. I think that places the value of this stock at around $15 per share, well above where it is now, with a nice dividend at this price and prospects for growth with the other half of profit going towards growth and addressing any consequences of the rules changes. Looks like a good, honest company doing good work with transparent reporting. I'll keep my money in it and might buy a little more."
"Another interesting article from ""InvestingMatters"" They said that QIWI is very much undervalue and that NIA recommended as an investment for 2018. For you guys that are interested in QIWI, here I share the link so you can find the article. As I see, there is no problem to repost a link with an article. If this is not allowed please just let me know. And please comment or share good information if you find some.https://investingmatters.co.za/qiwi-is-launching-its-own-bitcoin-atms/"
at least 18 by the end of the year
the drop continues to defy logic not going to add more but not going to sell.
Wiill Qiwi grows like Paypal?
Massive earnings beat. CFO resignation is officially much ado about nothing.
Not liking this vote on the approval of disapplication of shareholders pre-emption rights... anyone else have an opinion and/or concern on that topic?
"Probably something to do with crypto . Nw that Corps have started byuing cryptos with TSLA entering .,.. this will get momentum and will shootup in blink of eye"
if Hillary wins both Qiwi & Yndx go down further because the US along with Germany is going to ratchet up sanctions
"market up, QIWI down. market down, QIWI down... that $28 offer looks awefully good now."
I've been studying QIWI for some time and every day I'm getting more excited on how serious this company is in the blockchain and cryptocurrency field. I think very few people have notice it. QIWI even has a subsidiary named Qiwi Blockchain Technology. This is a solid business with great exposure to blockchain technology.
This stock is absolutely undervalued
"Are the dividends paid by QIWI classified as “Qualified” or “Ordinary”? “Qualified Dividends” are taxed at Capital Gains rates 0%, 15%, or 20%. “Ordinary Dividends” can be taxed at higher Ordinary Income tax rates. I believe QIWI’s headquarters is located in Cyprus rather than in Russia."
Owned QIWI for 3 days. I took my 25% loss for tax purposes. I will deploy that money somewhere else with less risk and a greater potential return. Bad taste here for only owning for 3 days. Good luck to you all
"Excellent return on investment of 35% of selling the JV stake, which profits will likely return to shareholders as part of the dividend policy or shares buyback. The value of QIWI's stake was estimated at RUB 4.95 billion (based on the current enterprise value of RUB 11.0 billion), which may be revised up or down depending on Tochka's FY 2021 audited results. The total amount of investment that QIWI made into the Tochka project equals to RUB 2.1 billion. Throughout the holding period QIWI has also received RUB 0.6 billion in dividends from Tochka. As a result, the deal delivers an approximately 2.5x return on QIWI's total investment, representing an IRR of 35%."
they pay almost 14% in dividend and good long-term investment. what's the problem here?
"This will top $12 as soon as earnings are released in the next few weeks. Then, a slow quarter to quarter grind higher to $18 in the next 12 months. Just the view with my crystal ball."
"guys, sell it at $28/share or keep it?"
Down 10% in 2 days.
"Digital Alliance AB and QIWI Group have launched a new service initially launched in Russia under the brand «tap2go» with the plan to roll this out to International markets during 2021. The new service will enable end users to accept card payments directly on their Mobile devices, without the need for having card acceptance hardware ! Great innovation and offer user convienence. ."
"I can hardly figure out the floor but I have no reason to panic sell unless they stop paying dividend. The last ER was pretty solid ""despite overall challenging environment."" Next earning will include their profit from Tochka Project, and I hope additional good news."
"Holding cash of $7 per share, after subtracting debt, clean book val. So your getting the rest of the business cash flow for $3 a share."
Nice to see another green day. Please go back to $24.
Bought 10 calls happy me
"Massive growth company, huge risk with political issues."
Anyone here sold Qiwi at 28$?
What's comming first - $20 a share or Biden nukes Russia? USA have been waiting for this moment since 1946.
"In addition to the nice chart setup.. I'm thinking this trade war show with China, might help everything Russian.. bring together old enemies, no? anyone else have an opinion on how the #$%$ match between U.S. and China effects Russia, namely, QIWI?regardless, I'm going to add to my position with a slight low ball this morning.. looks like a nice triple bottom.. a small part of me thinks it could revisit a lower low below 15.. but me likes the chances it parks right above the 15.65 mark.. then goes up yet again to 17-18 land"
QIWI is up 4.94% to 9.45
"QIWI fundamentals are looking better than in 2014, when the stock was above $35 per share.They have beaten estimates in 4 of the most recent 4 quarters.We could easily see QIWI double from here this year, going over $35 per share."
Buying more if this breaks 20
"This is a pattern trade...buy at low $10s and let it sit for a while , don’t look at it and one day you will see $18"
"Earnings + dividend in 2 weeks, this is a must buy, Im long with 1543 shares."
It's being held down for some unknown reason. Could easily rip $1-$2 higher if the seller finishes.
if I could buy this whole business like Warren buffet. I would. her you go sir these are the keys to a system that generates cash and oh BTW there's no debt
"QIWI is looking very good now below $13 per share. Cash flow is strong. Earnings are strong. Stock price is cheap. P/E is at historic lows. Ruble is strengthening. Revenue is growing and headed over $280 million per year. Total liabilities is small and under control. Balance sheet is asset heavy with over $120 million in net tangible assets. Number of shares outstanding is holding steady (little dilution). I would value the company at market cap of over $900 million, which is over $15 per share."
"O.K earnings are Thursday morning. Yahoo finance seems to be off, it has a est of $35 a share? Already makes money and is trading on the Nasdaq. What am I missing here? I got a starter position today. This is either brilliant or some elaborate scheme. I may buy another 500 tomorrow or wait out earnings. Total spec play, I guess?"
Upgrade to 35 dollar
What happened to the dividend payments?
"I found a very good article that gives a lot of information about QIWI. I don't know if I can share it here, but if you are interested it is on SeekingAlpha. It is dated on January 03 2018. The title of the article is: ""Russia's BitRuble Cryptocurrency: How To Profit"". You guys that follow QIWI can read it and comment here with me."
Target now set at $5
Dividend questionanyone know if no more dividends it under 14 again :(
It appears the market had priced in a significant penalty for Qiwi's dalliance with Sovest. That penalty is now being erased as Qiwi withe the projected termination of said dalliance.Can someone familiar with the the problems within Sovest provide some insight.I rarely invest in non-US companies but I've been held captive in this security for a good few years now.
when will they start paying dividends?
seems to be very undervalued ... but its not making any profits ither ...
Scam
Excellent earning and growth
"OMG, another all time low, $8.15."
"So, they just announced an offering. Certain shareholders (Otkritie mainly perhaps) wanted to sell their shares. Positive momentum may have been capped. Again. Isn't it a bit tiresome? Every time the stock performs very well, there seems to be a management decision or something that pushed the stock lower again."
qiwi sg up over 6% already
"In case you missed it... This is why the stock has been up up up, and will likely continue into the mid 20's before it slows down.04:26 AM EDT, 05/21/2019 (MT Newswires) -- The 2019 and 2020 full year forecasted earnings estimates for QIWI Plc's (NASDAQ:QIWI, Recent Price: 16.38) have been raised. The consensus for 2019, has been scaled up to $1.46 per share from $1.40 per share, and the 2020 full year estimate has been increased to $2.34 per share from the previous consensus forecast of $2.18 per share. There are currently 3 published estimates included in the current 2019 consensus estimate and 2 for the full year 2020 estimate."
QIWI is taking a neutral no recommendation stand on the partial buyout offer according to SEC filings today. I am currently leaning towards offering up my shares as it may be a long time before we break $28 and I get a small profit. What are others opinion on this?
"Qiwi has 591 millions in cash without debt. Institution investor did not tender cause they know QiWi worth $40 to $58 dollars varying from zero growth to double digit growth assumption. With its strong growing profile and the valuation comparing to Visa, Paypal, $28 is under valuing Qiwi. I am happy to hold Qiwi with the interest of the management is .aligning with shareholders that management owns a lot of the shares. With so much cash on hand, it can invest in expanding network, pay special dividend or both as shown in the past. If you deduct the cash, it is about P/E of 8 with high return on equity., ."
"well, should we exit & run"
"Signing the marching tune! Ppl who can read financial statements know how incredible cheap this is for a high growth, cash rich and free cash flow positive prodigy My hope is that it can grow to a 10 billions dollar company. Growth is a definite, question is conservative 0% growth or higher. Based on Ser... bank size and its alignment with Qiwi, a small piece of pie should pop Qiwi with steady income and growth. Mgmt, Keep up the great work and expand to th rest of Europe organically. ."
"Net profit up 18% despite Central Bank restrictions on some transfers. They are forecasting decrease in profit for the year but my guess this is just insurance against the ""ambulance chasing attorneys"" ready to file a lawsuit on any bad news. If the first Q is up 18%, its hard to see annual down 15%. Hang in there longs. Another quarter like this and we'll be back to $18 on the ADR's with nice dividends ($0.22 this quarter) to enjoy along the way."
"cash is growing, they are growing. enterprise value half of market cap. great future with uber account and others. slot of diversification in applications and customer base."
Qiwi was working and leading on the cryptocurrency at one point. I am not sure if the project is getting clearance from Russian authority.
Well boys & girls I admit I'm now confused. A very long time ago we discussed QIWI's dabbling in distributed ledger and crypto currency payments. Can any explain why today other folks saw the light? What was so special about today?
BlockchainDB and BlockStack have just raised over 21 millions and 54 millions respectively in first stage. Qiwi has an early start on blockchain with prroven earning power and generating free cash flow to fuel both e payment and blockchain subsidary. Venture capital should just come in and invest in Qiwi. .
very intelligent to sell share almost free at specific shareholders
Internal rate of return 35% and 2.x times of the original investment are excellent return on investment in selling the asseta.
"Do they have any debt? I saw yahoo with N/A. If they have no debt and with that amount of cash in hand, with 4.4% dividend, I am sure I will sleep soundly and buy more in dips."
whos selling ? why ? in red on earnings growth :(
bought 1k @ 13.55 going long with this one
Absolutely blow out quarter. No wonder i stitutions did not sell at 28. long way to grow and collect cool dividend.
"I have a simple question for our BOD:-If our CEO being on an extended, company-paid vacation with the family for nearly a year will have no impact on the business, then why are we hiring the man in the first place?"
I see that as opportunity for overreaction on CFO who joined recently leaving. It occurs in job market if he got a higher offer. Qiwi business and e money trend have not changed a bit.
Anybody know why the drop in pm?
"Qiwi Forex broker, Qiwi Brokder for traders are just few examples of the tremendous growth Qiwi is pushing forward. I applaud at the tremendous progress Qiwi made despite the misguided rumors try to buy the stock cheap. Its reputation and strong approvals is probably spreading like COVID. there is an increasing number of brokers that provide Qiwi as one of their payment methods to attract potential clients. Like the majority of online payment service, Qiwi can process all transactions instantly and is supported by a friendly mobile app."
"QIWI looks good again today. Yesterday was interesting, but I was too uncertain. Today it's good to see some volume coming back in and a nice move up."
How can a company with 40B revenue and 4B earnings be valued at just 600M? I wanna invest but the sp to earnings ratio dissapoint me.

With all the positive news surrounding why is the stock not closing positive
I like how it still drops 5% once a week ... gives me a good day to look to buy more. when the next earnings call happens look for the price to stay above $20 pps
QIWI lost 33% of it's bussiness totay with most profitable directions? P.E is goint to be above 100 in 2022. Game over. Price target near 0$
SELL TO YANDEX FOR STOCK
Qiwi's Sovet multi-banking exchange/platform IS Like the Apple iPHONE and the Windows OS for PC. THe investment in the last 1.5 years is paying off handsomely and it will continue to grow. The best Paypal in the other side of the US continent in terms of growth with a profitable cash generation machine
"dividend paying stock, big player in russia, crypto in use, thought it should be more popular"
"These little orange kiosk which are used for cash payments are all over Russia and extremely convenient but I have to wonder if their business model is obsolete as more and more payments move to mobile phones, online, etc. Maybe the old people will still use it but the young people have moved on."

"Forget about those fake Blockchain stock, like LTEA RIOT. QIWI is a solid business with 1300+ employees, already made money every year. Remember the dot com bubble, those fake dot com companies went to zero while you have AMZN, GOOG which are not a bubble. Do not buy the bubble. Buy the company that has real potential."
"Qiwi has great fundamentals should be trading $20 range, but I'm betting we see $50/share when they get involved with cryptocurrencies"
is there any reason for this ?
More cash and profit rolls in for QIWI. And now the Russian economy is just starting to warm up. Balance sheet is also excellent. They are paying a healthy dividend too. I think we are going to see QIWI stock rise in a big way this year.
Why was this stock ever below $13 per share?!? Soon it will be clear that it is worth over $20 per share.
Another new 52 week high. They just keep piling up. If we can beat earnings concensus AND have good guidance it's off to $30 a share.
capitalization - Enterprise value = close to 600 millions cash. If dividend 600 millions cash /60 million shares= 10 dollar cash on hand ! Back up the truck.

60% growth and we're trading very close to cash value.Our current share price is made up from $1.18 equity and $12.72 in cash.Something is very wrong here.
this stock is a good buy.
"This is a very significant move on huge volume, in a real company with real earnings, related, at least, to digital payment services. Even if this is just another PayPal sort of company, PayPal has almost doubled since March. With terminals throughout Russia and elsewhere, they must be at least taking a look at expanding into Bitcoin transactions and maybe other digital currencies as well. I think the price could easily reach $30 in not too long a time, though there may be some resistance around $26.50."
"cbr restrictions ,could not find how long are these restrictions ? ,could be removed sometime in 2021"
We need to see this volume stay high.

"Beautifully undervalued! Analysts were predicting revenue of $46.7 million for the quarter Q1. QIWI has announced $51.5 million. They beat revenue estimates by over 10%. QIWI has announce increased guidance for Q2. The stock is just starting to climb. Enterprise value only $558 M, yet they can earn $60M per year in net income. QIWI is cash rich and growing. The company is very undervalued. Likely QIWI will see over $30 per share this year."

What's up with this today? 4% up after earnings and now down close to 4%. Can understand give back some of the initial gain but never expected the sudden and significant move into negative territory.
Feels like an underrated stock
"dividends questionanyone see quaterly cash flow 2018 statements shows dividend -69,000 but not annual as did not get dividends in 2018"

"""Qiwi filed a notice with the Securities and Exchange Commission saying that, after a scheduled audit of the company's books for the period from July 2018 to September 2020, the Central Bank of Russia discovered ""certain violations and deficiencies relating primarily to reporting and record-keeping requirements"" at the company. As punishment, the Central Bank has imposed a fine""the Central Bank has also suspended Qiwi's ability to conduct most types of payments to foreign merchants and money transfers to pre-paid cards from corporate accounts, effective Dec. 7...""..... The severity will be reported mid 2021"
"IMO QIWI is in the right sector to capitalize on BitCoin payments and bounce back up to $15-$16 once the record is set straight with the Central Bank of Russia. Just like Paypal, QIWI will explore, if not done already, payment services with BTC. Obviously this company is very quiet, no PR or updates since the 150K fine was reported on Dec. 9 last year. But also IMO, after the Feb. 9 deadline and all the Vulture Law firms go away, we should be getting an update. Earnings estimate date is March 23. I'm hoping to bounce back on some other stocks and maybe add another 1K of QIWI to my bag at this price!!. Good luck to all LONGS."

"Dividend announced. Another strong quarter. Russia will enjoy the rising oil price and eco. Qiwi introduction of the installment payment card will be a hugh additional revenue stream. The rise of oil price will increase e-payment and remittance transactions. Another solid year of growth in the e-payment direction. Investment will be well pay off. I anticipate revenue will further increase in new payment installment card and e-payment. Today OPEC great news will lift the oil related economy. The rollout of the installment acceptance card will be the guage of growth moving forward. High growth high profit. Russia sell less oil, oil price up more than offset the reduction of production. Smart OPEC move. ."
"Anyone have any idea what's going on?If the financials are accurate, we can now retire 60% of the shares using 43% of the cash and push our p/e under 3.This makes no sense.

Any reason behind this surge?
Down she goes. day after day.
Dividend is BIG news. The Board of directors aims to distribute between 65% to 85% of its adjusted net profit for 2019 from the first quarter 2019. So far thats a huge dividend if you do the math and we have 2 more quarters for 2019 !!

"Great news, Qiwi has just launchsed the subsidiary Hash investment bank.

The trading of the stock is just too wild though. I've been in and out of it, currently out, because I just couldn't trade it successfully and didn't yet have a clear sense of a valuation on the stock for a longer-term position, but I may go back in at some point soon."

I still cant wrap my head around this stock price since 2016 revenue and earnings have doubled since then and the stock price is the same. And this company is in the most overvalued sector in the world.
Nice buying opportunity on today's dip.
"Banks all up, except one. You guessed it, the one I own."
"Well Andy, they picked a bad day for their earnings release it appears. Great earnings, we'd be up $3 in an up market. Looks like $30 is a lock in 2017."
looks like QIWI starting to get noticed for blockchain reasons.. saw an article on seeking alpha.. I'm just bent because i suspect that $15-16 was absolute bottom.. my buddy is busting my balls for not calling the bottom.. we're in at $16. i bought more at $14.25.. oh well.. same thing happened with GNE.. called $5-6 and damn thing hit $4's... long term agenda helps ease this dilemma
Seems like this stock would be a winner if more people buy online because of the virus?
QIWI is down -100.00% to 0.00
CFO resign the worst thing would be accounting error. But the company has stated this was not the reason.. So thing would be back to normal. This CFO was only on the job for 3 months. The selloff is a buying opportunity
"A couple of years ago when Bitcoin was at 20,000, this stock was considered a Bitcoin play; their kiosks were equipped to transact with crypto."
"Qiwi pops higher on blog blockchain mentionDec. 20, 2017 3:17 PM ET|By: Stephen Alpher, SA News Editor Russia-based payment services company Qiwi (NASDAQ:QIWI) spikes more than 2% after iBankCoin notes the company has plenty of crypto exposure. The stock, though, hasn't received nearly the sort of investor interest or major stock price pop of names like Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT), Longfin (NASDAQ:LFIN), or Crypto Co. (OTCPK:CRCW)."
"high volume ,anyone see it ? hope it goes over 19.25 resistance"
"QIWI to Announce Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Financial Results on March 30, 2021"
"People are missing this one long term. Of course it will sell off with market selling off, but historically it will rebound with higher Oil prices. The economy that drives this stock depends on Oil, and oil is making 52week highs."
"At the same time, Qiwi said that they expect to smooth out the effect of not receiving the ECUP status and continue working with the bookmaker market.“QIWI provides financial solutions for both partners - bookmakers and their clients. Already at the end of last year, we considered several scenarios for the development of the situation with CUPIS and worked out a plan that, in the medium term, will allow us to smooth out the effect of a possible closure of this direction, ""- quotes a representative of RBC.More details on BCS Express:https://bcs-express.ru/novosti-i-analitika/obval-aktsii-qiwi-i-dal-neishie-perspektivy"
Should have been +30$
not sure why changeups are a negative
"Hard not to se the value on this company. In a couple months, we will not see $10 per share, rather 30-50, and continue receiving dividends while waiting to go up. Going long on this stock!"
"I am just going to keep holding my base shares while jumping in/out during these nice easy $1-2 swings... it's been rather a nice trend and pattern, be it from $15-16, then to 17 back to 16, up to 18-19... don't want to let go of my base shares because once this thing is done dancing around $19 and change.. it's going to break thru $20 and most likely ride easily to $22-25 range, don't want to miss that while playing the waves with my non-bae shares"
"Ok, QIWI is down from $19 per share to $9 per share. Now we see revenue has been stagnant. Coporate guidance is that their revenue and profit will fall. Are they going BK?"
"This, to me, is one of the few stocks that after releasing better than expected earnings, upgrading guidance and increasing the dividend, the stock price drops. Having said this, the price behavior may have something to do with the selling intention from the biggest shareholders..."
#1 Strong Buy by Zacks!Just added more position.Will Qiwi Surge Higher? http://n.webull.com/page/news?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffinance.yahoo.com%2Fnews%2Fqiwi-surge-higher-114911409.html&_v=1&theme=1&color=1&hl=en&sp=1
whats sudden drop to 11 strange trading
"I maintain the 28 - 31 price target, and the growth is still on tract."
what in the bloody hell is going on with this stock's price action? Does anyone out there feel this price is justifiable? Anyone even out there? Losing hope ad patience on this one...
Trump is likely to lift sanction Money seems to flow in
The appointment of secretary from Exxon Mobile who is close to Putin is an indication that sanction to Russia will be lifted. Time for Qiwi to lift off.
Excellent result. over 60% growth well beyond my expectation. The resumption of dividend was mentioned and is likely first quarter. Too much cash earned now
"i encorage people to go to their English web site to look at their earning presentations, I am very impresses with its execution thus far, it shows management is savvy and focus on payment needs with enterpreneurship. Now that Sherbank owns a significant stake, the alliance is perfect to break new territories and revenue streams"
QIWI is down -6.22% to 16.12
"this stock is absolutely under valued,"
"when I continue to see, every year, health earnings release like this one, having short term negative effects on a stock price.. simply wreaks of big MM manipulation and the general normalizing of all stocks.. if more people traded/invested as individuals versus having the most likely >90% relying solely on big MM types.. well, they drive the market pricing.. just look many similar patterns across all stocks in various sectors.."
"Three months ago I posted, ""$9.80 before $12"". Well, the other day it hit $9.84. Did any of you buy arround this price ? I did at $9.86. Lets hear from the pumpers on this."
"why is this continuing to fall? Even if they are not doing bitcoin, they are still undervalued."
I think someone bought a lot of shares for the buyout offer (might have been Ottktritie before they made the offer) and with the buyout not happening they are no longer interested in the company. It does seem strange but there was a big run up before the offer. As long as profits and revenues keep rising the stock will go back up.
Institutional investor has increased from 16% to 43% recently. Hedge funds are seeing potential growth in this company. The company will integrate blockchain into its payment systems in the near future. Potential upside for this company.
"solid financial solid dividend, hold for 10 years to get my initial investment back, I will write another post after 10 years."
BOUGHT 15K SHARES TODAY @ 9.15. BACK UP TO NEAR TERM 15
Why the big drop after hours today?
"Adjusted EBITDA increased 54% to RUB 2,516 million ($39.1 million)Adjusted Net Profit increased 62% to RUB 1,893 million ($29.4 million),Just have to sit back and relax while QIWI is working hard. The money earning means increasing payout to reward shareholders. Special dividend is likely as a result of positive growth in earning."

"if you loom at Cathie Wood's heavy bets on mobil payment, you will see Qiwi is in the trend of massive growth"
Is this stock for real or a joke. Red on a 600 point up Day

The breakout is a wonderful signal. DFS jumped over 8% and electronic payments on the rise
"The situation requires investors' patience. I believe Qiwi management can sort it out with 20years experience. Let's wait and see with the long term view. ""Never lose money ""because of inpatient decision."
"Easy trade... I have been waiting over two months for this one to trade like it did today. Once it starts moving, it will move a total of around $3 before resting. So, easy trade up to around $17. If it breaks $17 its going to $20 quick."
Is this the next crypto/bitcoin play?
"see many funds bought ,maybe they see this atleast worth $25"
Div eliminated.
The only news of Qiwi is all the vulture law firms cases against QiWi. Is there any business analytics on the stock?
"buyout coming , CFO did not agree it was best route for QIWI, so he will leave, but still cash -in his stock options."
"Does anyone know of some American block chain companies such as those doing health care, finances, etc. Herd square could be a good one. I am long QIWI"
Does anyone have any idea if the Croatian Bankruptcy will affect Qiwi's stock price?

"Under valued company with a strong balance sheet and NO long term debt , plus they pay a nice dividend."
"There is an excellent article on Calvin Ayre that provides considerable detail concerning the CBR audit and the upcoming “restrictions.” Apparently Yahoo isn’t a fan of me providing a link to this article, since they’ve deleted my post twice. Hopefully they will let this survive so that interested investors can do their research.As an option holder, I am sticking with Qiwi for now."
$QIWI is reported as top 100 growth company in 2020 by Fortune. Any idea when we start seeing some action?
"I m in with 100  will enjoy the dividend as I needed stock with a good dividend in my portfolio , the more this drops the more I add"
"So, I'm thinking that the recent sideways price action in QIWI here might be from Bitcoin going sideways for the past few weeks, in addition to apparent accumulation happening. All the other blockchain stocks I watch have been going down while QIWI is moving sideways and OSTK is hitting new highs the past couple days. IMO, neither QIWI nor OSTK need to be tracking Bitcoin (since they're each doing their own thing, well beyond what's going on with Bitcoin), but some correlation is certainly understandable."
"Finally got past the $17.75 area convincingly this morning. Nothing moves in a straight line, but we could see a good move up from here."
Wakeup gentle giantShow me love
This will be the next GME and favorite of the Reddit crowd.
glad I get to buy more at this level.. was not happy with my purchasing power earlier this year when QIWI was around this level last time.. let's ride yet another trendy wave!
QIWI is bank with a lot of illegal activity. The regulator is likely to block most of its profits related drugs and bets (most profitable) transactions. Be aware that in russia you use QIWI only if you want to send or recieve money anonymously. Only reason it is not banned complitely it is fast payment terminals. which SBER now places everywhere to replace qiwi
Just got the juicy dividend in my brokerage acct. In and out of the stock will miss the hugh move that is coming. Wait for the positive news....

"QIWI pressed down to a new multi year low of $8.77, just $.15 above its all time low of $8.62. The market is very sour on QIWI. As long as the company remains silent concerning the latest fall in their fortunes I suspect that QIWI will continue to grind lower."

"Excellent news for Russia & CIS - Growth has firmed up in the economy of the Commonwealth of the Independent States (CIS), as the region recovers from an abysmal 2015–2016. Comprehensive data confirm that regional GDP grew a solid 2.8% year-on-year in the second quarter, notably above the first quarter’s 1.1% increase. Stronger growth was seen in the majority of the region’s economies, with regional heavyweight Russia expanding at the fastest pace since Q3 2012. Search on CIS GDP 2017 , you will see the details."

"just noticed this stock reaching 52 week low with nearly 9% div. looks like a good balance sheet and low pe, etc. what's the problem? looks like a screaming buy."
"Somethings happening, anyone know why?"
When is this blood bath going to stop?
"Interestingly, if QIWI were to use all their cash to purchase shares at the current pps, the forward p/e would be under 4!I guess there's a penalty to operating in Putin territory."
Cyrus tourism up 12.7% in 2016 thus far compare to last year . It appears that Qiwi willl benefit from increase payment transactions from tourists and increase free cash flow .
How the fffff is going down?
"I'm thinking of buying this. Fundamentals look solid with increasing revenues over the last decade, good profit margin and ridiculous P/E of 5.Can someone help me understand why the bad price action since last August's earnings? Is there a trap with this company?"
"Tomorrow Qiwi will publish their 1Q earnings results. In the meantime, recommend checking this investment thesis on the company: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4262201-qiwi-plc-cheap-way-play-secular-trends"
I live in Moscow and travel throughout Russia and see their terminal everywhere. In addition they have very good mobile application in which you can make lots of payments through.

"a news flash on bloomberg: A recent interview with JP Morgan’s chair of global research, Joyce Chang, only cemented this theme. Per Bloomberg, which conducted the candid conversation, Chang was hesitant to admit that decentralized (or centralized) ledgers would overhaul the global financial system. However, she made it abundantly clear that the technology is likely to “marginally” improve global ecosystems after a period of around three to five years. The Wall Street researcher added that blockchain technologies are most likely going to see an application in trade finance, noting that the innovation can allow for “high potential gains in efficiency from digitalization.”A recent interview with JP Morgan’s chair of global research, Joyce Chang, only cemented this theme.

"The restrictive measures of QIWI Bank have expiredIn December last year, the Central Bank of Russia imposed restrictive measures on QIWI's work with foreign merchants, which gave rise to rumors and concerns. You don't have to be afraid:On June 7, the restrictions imposed by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation expired, and from June 8, 2021, the restrictive measures of the Bank of Russia ceased to be effective.Now we are actively working on the resumption of cooperation with foreign merchants within the framework of the law and regulations of the regulators. At the moment, we cannot accurately estimate how many partners and in what volume it will be possible to restore this year, but we hope to maintain business relations and successful work."
"Great news, Qiwi announced that the CBR permitted them to resume processing payments to certain key foreign merchants and lifted some of the other restrictions imposed in December 2020. There is disclaiming note that the measures by CBR might change."
"A months worth of research and google translating Russian documents....I really wanted to buy this stock and just sit on it, collect the dividends and hope for a price double in the next 5 years. I have come to the conclusion this company wont even be around in 5 years. 40% of Russians dont even use cash anymore. Every large Russian bank now offers all of the services QIWI does and far more. The regulatory landscape probably halves their overall business by Jan, 23. If the company pivots into new territory, I'll change my opinion, but right now, I personally wont risk it."
Wakeup sleeping giantAll your friends are marching ahead do not get left out.
The bad.....QIWI hit another all time low $8.29 today. The good......QIWI bounced as high as $8.60. I took advantage of this and sold 25% of my position in QIWI. I need some short term loss to cover the short term gains that have been piling up since the first of the year.

Actual block chain technology and it sells off. Wish they would have taken my shares at $28 when I offered them.
True explosion is coming soon. Buy now IMO.
Nice recovery

"Great article from Motley Fool yesterday, citing QIWI as the writer's favorite Russian stock right now:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-russia-stocks-consider-buying-000600054.html"
I wish yahoo would learn how to do currency conversions. I could write that code in a day and train their clerks how to read financial reports and enter the correct data. But they can't?
"Complete block chain move today. About time, these guys are real and have the technology in use. Should be trading in the $30's at a minimum."
"given QIWI's stagnating during an otherwise upward market trend.. I'm feeling more and more confident it is a good hedge for a market downturn, no?"
purchaser of 2m shares a 10 days ago. Happy camper. wonder why it is up.
Special dividend is in order
"This is actually a real company unlike the others, with strong financial AND real blockchain exposure."
This will be back to $18 by September. QIWI will resolve the regulatory reporting issues and COVID will no longer consume the news.
Long on QIWI
Russia cutting off tourism with Turkey will be negative for QIWI. This could be a percursior to a resumtion of the war in Ukraine.
Sanctions will put this in danger?
"I have been longing this stock since $8, the key to success is to buy in early age and sell earlier. I switched to long $QIWI now."
Too bad. Guidance for profit from ongoing operations is going to have a 15% to 25% decline.
"Its painful to watch this slow pendulum at 10 when thenwhole market is moving crazy and even #$%$ stocks are moving and taking advantage.And this is a good company with revenue, profit, returns and dividendAnd it does nothing.Hopefully the Russian Czars will take some action."
bring on the long overdue steady climb upwards.. watch when QIWI breaks 18 again.. rip off those rear view mirrors
wonder if any insiders buying
very strong volume
Any hope of recovery?
Bought this when it was around the $20 now with the lawsuits I’m not sure if I should buy more since it’s now $10 or just wait....
Saw this stock on Reddit. Not sure why it's not up a ton.
4 years ago the share price was between 30-40 usd when usd rur rate was 32. Now it is 14 bucks but usd rur rate is 59. Since then they added lots of pos and applications and users. The fair value should be around 18-22 usd nowadays
"LadaNiva, I see by your last post on the ""Vincent"" thread that reality is coming into your mind. Anyone who thinks that a company that has suffered as much as QIWI has over the last several months is going to continue to pay a 12% to 14% dividend going forward is detached from the real world. After their run in with the central bank they announced a reduction of 20% to 30% in the dividend. They have now suffered an even greater blow over the ""bets"" business. Mid Nov. is a long way off to their next quarterly report. Without clarification from QIWI I see nothing that will prevent this stock from continuing to grind lower. Since 9/9 over 2.5M shares have traded lower than their previous historical low of $8.62. Thats 4% of all the shares. The buyers think they are getting a great deal and this will eventualy double. The sellers think the buyers are going down a rabbit hole. Which is it ? I sold 25% of my QIWI on the day this week when the share price jumped up $.50/share. In accord with the wash rule I can not purchase again until 10/14 or I will lose the tax benefit of the loss. So, I am sitting on the sidelines watching."
"lost profit by 15-30% is not real numbers - 37-45% loss on transactions related to online casino , but resolve all Central Bank issues. 13.3 first target in 6 month. dividends about 8% on the way. 20-21$ before 2024. Still have many problems with terminals and big commissions for any transactions.( lost 15% of it's users in 2020) . with price below 13$ you can buy it with almost 0 risk"
Why is it dropping when the market is up???
I see 17 soon
How disappointing losing the nice gains of this morning. Day traders are here now it appears.
