"From my travels around the world, I can tell you that Russia is expanding and far more advanced than most people in the west know. Visit Moscow and St. Petersburg and you'll find beautiful cities that are using the internet and technology far more than even in North America. QIWI will benefit from Russia's explosive growth."
"why is this continuing to fall? Even if they are not doing bitcoin, they are still undervalued."
Why the big drop after hours today?
"just noticed this stock reaching 52 week low with nearly 9% div. looks like a good balance sheet and low pe, etc. what's the problem? looks like a screaming buy."
volume today 1/28 was up over 250 pct avg daily volume.... no obvious news
the drop continues to defy logic not going to add more but not going to sell.
Well boys & girls I admit I'm now confused. A very long time ago we discussed QIWI's dabbling in distributed ledger and crypto currency payments. Can any explain why today other folks saw the light? What was so special about today?
EPS is only 4 and yield 11%. Thai is pretty undervalued to me. If not going up we can collect dividend until goes up to $30.
"Are the dividends paid by QIWI classified as “Qualified” or “Ordinary”? “Qualified Dividends” are taxed at Capital Gains rates 0%, 15%, or 20%. “Ordinary Dividends” can be taxed at higher Ordinary Income tax rates. I believe QIWI’s headquarters is located in Cyprus rather than in Russia."
With all the positive news surrounding why is the stock not closing positive
Why is it dropping when the market is up???
"I have been longing this stock since $8, the key to success is to buy in early age and sell earlier. I switched to long $QIWI now."
Excellent result. over 60% growth well beyond my expectation. The resumption of dividend was mentioned and is likely first quarter. Too much cash earned now
"IMO QIWI is in the right sector to capitalize on BitCoin payments and bounce back up to $15-$16 once the record is set straight with the Central Bank of Russia. Just like Paypal, QIWI will explore, if not done already, payment services with BTC. Obviously this company is very quiet, no PR or updates since the 150K fine was reported on Dec. 9 last year. But also IMO, after the Feb. 9 deadline and all the Vulture Law firms go away, we should be getting an update. Earnings estimate date is March 23. I'm hoping to bounce back on some other stocks and maybe add another 1K of QIWI to my bag at this price!!. Good luck to all LONGS."
purchaser of 2m shares a 10 days ago. Happy camper. wonder why it is up.
How does it cost the ADR for QIWI each year?
"So, they just announced an offering. Certain shareholders (Otkritie mainly perhaps) wanted to sell their shares. Positive momentum may have been capped. Again. Isn't it a bit tiresome? Every time the stock performs very well, there seems to be a management decision or something that pushed the stock lower again."
"Top ranking in Reuter's analyst report at P/E of 5.1 to 6 and impressive ROE at 28%. Consistently growing at double digits rate since IPO with positive earning growth and free cash flow. Collect the dividend while you wait for it to explode to the upside. Soon, this stock will be free and can be paid for with its one year earning."
"These little orange kiosk which are used for cash payments are all over Russia and extremely convenient but I have to wonder if their business model is obsolete as more and more payments move to mobile phones, online, etc. Maybe the old people will still use it but the young people have moved on."
"So, I'm thinking that the recent sideways price action in QIWI here might be from Bitcoin going sideways for the past few weeks, in addition to apparent accumulation happening. All the other blockchain stocks I watch have been going down while QIWI is moving sideways and OSTK is hitting new highs the past couple days. IMO, neither QIWI nor OSTK need to be tracking Bitcoin (since they're each doing their own thing, well beyond what's going on with Bitcoin), but some correlation is certainly understandable."

14 + whitin a month.
We need to see this volume stay high.
"I had this stock for the longest time but couldn’t hold it, is too reliant on the Russian economy, and due to geo politic is just beyond my personal risk tolerance. These prices are quite attractive but won’t be jumping back in"
"I maintain the 28 - 31 price target, and the growth is still on tract."
"high volume ,anyone see it ? hope it goes over 19.25 resistance"
I still cant wrap my head around this stock price since 2016 revenue and earnings have doubled since then and the stock price is the same. And this company is in the most overvalued sector in the world.
I wish yahoo would learn how to do currency conversions. I could write that code in a day and train their clerks how to read financial reports and enter the correct data. But they can't?
"Ok, QIWI is down from $19 per share to $9 per share. Now we see revenue has been stagnant. Coporate guidance is that their revenue and profit will fall. Are they going BK?"
Upgrade to 35 dollar
What happened to the dividend payments?
is there any reason for this ?
capitalization - Enterprise value = close to 600 millions cash. If dividend 600 millions cash /60 million shares= 10 dollar cash on hand ! Back up the truck.
Seems like this stock would be a winner if more people buy online because of the virus?
"Banks all up, except one. You guessed it, the one I own."
Wakeup gentle giantShow me love
The bad.....QIWI hit another all time low $8.29 today. The good......QIWI bounced as high as $8.60. I took advantage of this and sold 25% of my position in QIWI. I need some short term loss to cover the short term gains that have been piling up since the first of the year.
KGB company
True explosion is coming soon. Buy now IMO.
"LadaNiva, I see by your last post on the ""Vincent"" thread that reality is coming into your mind. Anyone who thinks that a company that has suffered as much as QIWI has over the last several months is going to continue to pay a 12% to 14% dividend going forward is detached from the real world. After their run in with the central bank they announced a reduction of 20% to 30% in the dividend. They have now suffered an even greater blow over the ""bets"" business. Mid Nov. is a long way off to their next quarterly report. Without clarification from QIWI I see nothing that will prevent this stock from continuing to grind lower. Since 9/9 over 2.5M shares have traded lower than their previous historical low of $8.62. Thats 4% of all the shares. The buyers think they are getting a great deal and this will eventualy double. The sellers think the buyers are going down a rabbit hole. Which is it ? I sold 25% of my QIWI on the day this week when the share price jumped up $.50/share. In accord with the wash rule I can not purchase again until 10/14 or I will lose the tax benefit of the loss. So, I am sitting on the sidelines watching."

Dividend questionanyone know if no more dividends it under 14 again :(
Bought this when it was around the $20 now with the lawsuits I’m not sure if I should buy more since it’s now $10 or just wait....

"Great news, Qiwi announced that the CBR permitted them to resume processing payments to certain key foreign merchants and lifted some of the other restrictions imposed in December 2020. There is disclaiming note that the measures by CBR might change."

"Great news, Qiwi has just launchsed the subsidiary Hash investment bank. It expects Russia to pass crypto currency law this fall and will help companies to raise money for natural resources and energy sectors where it was difficult in the past with US sanction. So, there is great needs, and it will use its expertise in blockchain to help companies to advise on companies to avoid scam and is in the process to raise 20 millions for energy company. Search on Qiwi news in Utube and I am excited to see it has another leg to grow and dominate in blockchain in the CIS and Russia"
they pay almost 14% in dividend and good long-term investment. what's the problem here?
"anyone know when next earnings,if any dividend thx"
"when I continue to see, every year, health earnings release like this one, having short term negative effects on a stock price.. simply wreaks of big MM manipulation and the general normalizing of all stocks.. if more people traded/invested as individuals versus having the most likely >90% relying solely on big MM types.. well, they drive the market pricing.. just look many similar patterns across all stocks in various sectors.."
"I can hardly figure out the floor but I have no reason to panic sell unless they stop paying dividend. The last ER was pretty solid ""despite overall challenging environment."" Next earning will include their profit from Tochka Project, and I hope additional good news."
"Anyone have any idea what's going on?If the financials are accurate, we can now retire 60% of the shares using 43% of the cash and push our p/e under 3.This makes no sense. If that does not push the pps up, an acquirer could then use some of Qiwi's own cash to buy 100% stake in the company and also pay themselves a large cash dividend for taking ownership for free!The market is supposed to assign values that should make that impossible.Yet here we are!!That the heck is happening?"
"Forget about those fake Blockchain stock, like LTEA RIOT. QIWI is a solid business with 1300+ employees, already made money every year. Remember the dot com bubble, those fake dot com companies went to zero while you have AMZN, GOOG which are not a bubble. Do not buy the bubble. Buy the company that has real potential."

"Adjusted EBITDA increased 54% to RUB 2,516 million ($39.1 million)Adjusted Net Profit increased 62% to RUB 1,893 million ($29.4 million),Just have to sit back and relax while QIWI is working hard. The money earning means increasing payout to reward shareholders. Special dividend is likely as a result of positive growth in earning."
84% institution ownership is a vote of confidence of Qiwi's growth and strong financial performance
Massive earnings beat. CFO resignation is officially much ado about nothing.

"market up, QIWI down. market down, QIWI down... that $28 offer looks awefully good now."
I've been studying QIWI for some time and every day I'm getting more excited on how serious this company is in the blockchain and cryptocurrency field. I think very few people have notice it. QIWI even has a subsidiary named Qiwi Blockchain Technology. This is a solid business with great exposure to blockchain technology.
"Complete block chain move today. About time, these guys are real and have the technology in use. Should be trading in the $30's at a minimum."
"A months worth of research and google translating Russian documents....I really wanted to buy this stock and just sit on it, collect the dividends and hope for a price double in the next 5 years. I have come to the conclusion this company wont even be around in 5 years. 40% of Russians dont even use cash anymore. Every large Russian bank now offers all of the services QIWI does and far more. The regulatory landscape probably halves their overall business by Jan, 23. If the company pivots into new territory, I'll change my opinion, but right now, I personally wont risk it."
Any hope of recovery?

"Narratives follow price, not the other way around. After the price move, the narratives will be constructed."
Actual block chain technology and it sells off. Wish they would have taken my shares at $28 when I offered them.
"Here's my take. In 2020 it appears earnings per share was $1.92. They say ""adjusted net profit is expected to decrease by 15% to 30% over 2020."" OK, that's fair. They have some rules changes which seem to be about making their financial system more sound. Nothing wrong with that, and probably a good idea for their society. So, that means earnings per share should be in the neighborhood of $1.34 to $1.63. Generously, they want to distribute 50% of that as dividends. I think that puts the dividend in the 67 to 82 cent range for the year. Not bad. I think that places the value of this stock at around $15 per share, well above where it is now, with a nice dividend at this price and prospects for growth with the other half of profit going towards growth and addressing any consequences of the rules changes. Looks like a good, honest company doing good work with transparent reporting. I'll keep my money in it and might buy a little more."

"Excellent return on investment of 35% of selling the JV stake, which profits will likely return to shareholders as part of the dividend policy or shares buyback. The value of QIWI's stake was estimated at RUB 4.95 billion (based on the current enterprise value of RUB 11.0 billion), which may be revised up or down depending on Tochka's FY 2021 audited results. The total amount of investment that QIWI made into the Tochka project equals to RUB 2.1 billion. Throughout the holding period QIWI has also received RUB 0.6 billion in dividends from Tochka. As a result, the deal delivers an approximately 2.5x return on QIWI's total investment, representing an IRR of 35%."

"The restrictive measures of QIWI Bank have expiredIn December last year, the Central Bank of Russia imposed restrictive measures on QIWI's work with foreign merchants, which gave rise to rumors and concerns.
