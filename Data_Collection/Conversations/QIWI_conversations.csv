"At the same time, Qiwi said that they expect to smooth out the effect of not receiving the ECUP status and continue working with the bookmaker market.“QIWI provides financial solutions for both partners - bookmakers and their clients. Already at the end of last year, we considered several scenarios for the development of the situation with CUPIS and worked out a plan that, in the medium term, will allow us to smooth out the effect of a possible closure of this direction, ""- quotes a representative of RBC.More details on BCS Express:https://bcs-express.ru/novosti-i-analitika/obval-aktsii-qiwi-i-dal-neishie-perspektivy"
"cash is growing, they are growing. enterprise value half of market cap. great future with uber account and others. slot of diversification in applications and customer base."
"Qiwi has great fundamentals should be trading $20 range, but I'm betting we see $50/share when they get involved with cryptocurrencies"
"Hard not to se the value on this company. In a couple months, we will not see $10 per share, rather 30-50, and continue receiving dividends while waiting to go up. Going long on this stock!"
EPS is only 4 and yield 11%. Thai is pretty undervalued to me. If not going up we can collect dividend until goes up to $30.
"QIWI pressed down to a new multi year low of $8.77, just $.15 above its all time low of $8.62. The market is very sour on QIWI. As long as the company remains silent concerning the latest fall in their fortunes I suspect that QIWI will continue to grind lower."

How can a company with 40B revenue and 4B earnings be valued at just 600M? I wanna invest but the sp to earnings ratio dissapoint me.
"I am just going to keep holding my base shares while jumping in/out during these nice easy $1-2 swings... it's been rather a nice trend and pattern, be it from $15-16, then to 17 back to 16, up to 18-19... don't want to let go of my base shares because once this thing is done dancing around $19 and change.. it's going to break thru $20 and most likely ride easily to $22-25 range, don't want to miss that while playing the waves with my non-bae shares"
"Great news, Qiwi announced that the CBR permitted them to resume processing payments to certain key foreign merchants and lifted some of the other restrictions imposed in December 2020. There is disclaiming note that the measures by CBR might change."
when the shares hit a P/E of $1 I guess they can just go public for fun wait two years and go public again. Twice the profit non of the pain.
"""1y Target Est 902.00"". I'd be surprised if it reached that in rubles."
"I know their invest in SOVEST program and should still have lot of capital. Their blockchain subsidiary is developing mechanism in tracking energy. The fact that sales are up, the profit is up further if not SOVEST program, the guidance is still up as electronic channels usage are up. I am reinvesting using DRIP for undervalued shares, Allocating to growth projects are ok cause time is of essence in dominating ."
How does it cost the ADR for QIWI each year?
"just noticed this stock reaching 52 week low with nearly 9% div. looks like a good balance sheet and low pe, etc. what's the problem? looks like a screaming buy."
"More than 600 Fintech + banks are integrating to the brilliant leading edge Q-platfrom of Qiwi. This is the heart and platform for a disruptive technology for any companies outside and inside CIS. Qiwi grows continuously and as a leader in the technology and platform, with solid financial strength and records. The credibility is solid and vetted by key Partnerships such as SBI Bank, Absolut Bank, AkBars Bank and Otkritie Bank. I upgraded it further to a strong buy considering its Q-platform offers lots of value for companies leveraging e-payment technology outside CIS and inside CIS. Qplatform is the Open banking unit of Qiwi PLC"
"I maintain the 28 - 31 price target, and the growth is still on tract."
"OMG, another all time low, $8.15."
Got dividend today and reinvested
company FOR SALE to YANDEX ?
$10+ next
they pay almost 14% in dividend and good long-term investment. what's the problem here?
"The 28 dollars offered price by Otkritie Holdings indicates that Qiwi was expected to worth a lot. Judging from the growth rate, the current price is assuming no growth. The past results has already proven and indicating the growth rate is excellent, If use use the last quarter growth rate, this will be a over 42 dollars stock ! Otkritie may need to increase the price much higher now."
"How much more pain can you stand ? Another new all time low today, $7.96 ! Ouch !"
"Excellent return on investment of 35% of selling the JV stake, which profits will likely return to shareholders as part of the dividend policy or shares buyback. The value of QIWI's stake was estimated at RUB 4.95 billion (based on the current enterprise value of RUB 11.0 billion), which may be revised up or down depending on Tochka's FY 2021 audited results. The total amount of investment that QIWI made into the Tochka project equals to RUB 2.1 billion. Throughout the holding period QIWI has also received RUB 0.6 billion in dividends from Tochka. As a result, the deal delivers an approximately 2.5x return on QIWI's total investment, representing an IRR of 35%."
Sell the company to Yandex
I still cant wrap my head around this stock price since 2016 revenue and earnings have doubled since then and the stock price is the same. And this company is in the most overvalued sector in the world.
"QIWI hit another annual low, $9.66 yesterday. I actually saw it trade as low as $9.64. The market is very negative on QIWI with the quarterly report tomorrow. Could we see QIWI closing in on its all time low of $8.62 ?"
QIWI lost 33% of it's bussiness totay with most profitable directions? P.E is goint to be above 100 in 2022. Game over. Price target near 0$
"O.K earnings are Thursday morning. Yahoo finance seems to be off, it has a est of $35 a share? Already makes money and is trading on the Nasdaq. What am I missing here? I got a starter position today. This is either brilliant or some elaborate scheme. I may buy another 500 tomorrow or wait out earnings. Total spec play, I guess?"
"Yahoo! Look at your eps trend 30 days ago. Does that look right to you? It is in rubles. Correct it. Go through all the ADRs you report and correct them all. I'd write a program to check the numbers and train your staff to use it, if you could afford me."
"I can hardly figure out the floor but I have no reason to panic sell unless they stop paying dividend. The last ER was pretty solid ""despite overall challenging environment."" Next earning will include their profit from Tochka Project, and I hope additional good news."
"Are the dividends paid by QIWI classified as “Qualified” or “Ordinary”? “Qualified Dividends” are taxed at Capital Gains rates 0%, 15%, or 20%. “Ordinary Dividends” can be taxed at higher Ordinary Income tax rates. I believe QIWI’s headquarters is located in Cyprus rather than in Russia."
"I'm thinking of buying this. Fundamentals look solid with increasing revenues over the last decade, good profit margin and ridiculous P/E of 5.Can someone help me understand why the bad price action since last August's earnings? Is there a trap with this company?"
"Recently volume has increased significantly, maybe some institution at play? I can't seem to find any news source"
Internal rate of return 35% and 2.x times of the original investment are excellent return on investment in selling the asseta.
"solid financial solid dividend, hold for 10 years to get my initial investment back, I will write another post after 10 years."
"QIWI pressed down to $8.84 today, closing in on its all time low of $8.62. The gov. annoited ""Mobil Card"" to handle all bets to bookmakers. This was a big piece of QIWI business. We need an update from QIWI management as to what this means to QIWI going forward ? Will they be able to survive this blow ?"
I can't evaluate this stock.. I can't decide if it's a huge waste of money or a gold mine....
SELL TO YANDEX FOR STOCK
Great sales of capital intensive business at 2.x times profit. 35% IRR is excellent. The profits will go to the bottom line.
$QIWI is reported as top 100 growth company in 2020 by Fortune. Any idea when we start seeing some action?
I got more divided today than last quarter.
"Good golly, Miss Molly! QIWI hit a new annual low today, $9.68. This is the second lowest price in the 8 years since it IPO'd. I hope all you boys and girls were buyers today."
"Here's my take. In 2020 it appears earnings per share was $1.92. They say ""adjusted net profit is expected to decrease by 15% to 30% over 2020."" OK, that's fair. They have some rules changes which seem to be about making their financial system more sound. Nothing wrong with that, and probably a good idea for their society. So, that means earnings per share should be in the neighborhood of $1.34 to $1.63. Generously, they want to distribute 50% of that as dividends. I think that puts the dividend in the 67 to 82 cent range for the year. Not bad. I think that places the value of this stock at around $15 per share, well above where it is now, with a nice dividend at this price and prospects for growth with the other half of profit going towards growth and addressing any consequences of the rules changes. Looks like a good, honest company doing good work with transparent reporting. I'll keep my money in it and might buy a little more."
"There is an excellent article on Calvin Ayre that provides considerable detail concerning the CBR audit and the upcoming “restrictions.” Apparently Yahoo isn’t a fan of me providing a link to this article, since they’ve deleted my post twice. Hopefully they will let this survive so that interested investors can do their research.As an option holder, I am sticking with Qiwi for now."
This one is set to take off.
The bad.....QIWI hit another all time low $8.29 today. The good......QIWI bounced as high as $8.60. I took advantage of this and sold 25% of my position in QIWI. I need some short term loss to cover the short term gains that have been piling up since the first of the year.
"buyout coming , CFO did not agree it was best route for QIWI, so he will leave, but still cash -in his stock options."
"LadaNiva, I see by your last post on the ""Vincent"" thread that reality is coming into your mind. Anyone who thinks that a company that has suffered as much as QIWI has over the last several months is going to continue to pay a 12% to 14% dividend going forward is detached from the real world. After their run in with the central bank they announced a reduction of 20% to 30% in the dividend. They have now suffered an even greater blow over the ""bets"" business. Mid Nov. is a long way off to their next quarterly report. Without clarification from QIWI I see nothing that will prevent this stock from continuing to grind lower. Since 9/9 over 2.5M shares have traded lower than their previous historical low of $8.62. Thats 4% of all the shares. The buyers think they are getting a great deal and this will eventualy double. The sellers think the buyers are going down a rabbit hole. Which is it ? I sold 25% of my QIWI on the day this week when the share price jumped up $.50/share. In accord with the wash rule I can not purchase again until 10/14 or I will lose the tax benefit of the loss. So, I am sitting on the sidelines watching."
"IMO QIWI is in the right sector to capitalize on BitCoin payments and bounce back up to $15-$16 once the record is set straight with the Central Bank of Russia. Just like Paypal, QIWI will explore, if not done already, payment services with BTC. Obviously this company is very quiet, no PR or updates since the 150K fine was reported on Dec. 9 last year. But also IMO, after the Feb. 9 deadline and all the Vulture Law firms go away, we should be getting an update. Earnings estimate date is March 23. I'm hoping to bounce back on some other stocks and maybe add another 1K of QIWI to my bag at this price!!. Good luck to all LONGS."
"Keep the share price low so I can keep adding more. Just rolled over my dividend (showed up in my account today) into more shares. Hard to beat an 8.25% yield and 70-100% upside. Even if it stays at this price for the next 10 years, I will have done pretty well just with the dividend income alone."
"This will top $12 as soon as earnings are released in the next few weeks. Then, a slow quarter to quarter grind higher to $18 in the next 12 months. Just the view with my crystal ball."
Target now set at $5
"These little orange kiosk which are used for cash payments are all over Russia and extremely convenient but I have to wonder if their business model is obsolete as more and more payments move to mobile phones, online, etc. Maybe the old people will still use it but the young people have moved on."
"Ok, QIWI is down from $19 per share to $9 per share. Now we see revenue has been stagnant. Coporate guidance is that their revenue and profit will fall. Are they going BK?"
2nd Q earnings of $0.60 per share and quarterly dividend of $0.30. Load up because this is going to skyrocket.
That is horrible stock! PT when we recive dividend? 5$?

"The chart for this firm looks terrible over any time period but the last few days. It seems to just constantly decline in value. Perhaps it's a scam to fleece investors. Why would we believe ""this time it's different"" when the chart shows a clear and constant decline since before the laws changed ?"
