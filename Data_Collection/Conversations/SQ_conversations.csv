"Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance wealth, a great career, purpose is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that anyone reads this will be successful in life"

"Square upgraded to Overweight from Neutral with a $300 price target at Atlantic EquitiesAtlantic Equities analyst Kunaal Malde upgraded Square to Overweight from Neutral with a $300 price target. The company's growth prospects ""remain substantial"" as it continues disrupting consumer and business banking through ""strong execution against a digital-first strategy,"" Malde tells investors in a research note. Square's Cash App is a leading brand with network effects, innovates quickly and has ""multiple monetization levers ahead,"" says the analyst. Further, Malde says the Afterpay acquisition adds incremental growth opportunities for Square in buy now pay later and commerce. The analyst recommends taking advantage of the recent pullback in the stock."
"Lets break $260 already, this resistance for SQ has been here for months..."
"To focus on the daily gyrations of Square’s share price is madness. Most do not understand what Square is building. Several yrs. back it was known for its card reader, today it’s grown into an innovative leader in the fintech space. With its growing cash app, its dual ecosystem of products and services, and its visionary leader:Dorsey, Square will easily grow into a trillion dollar company."
"go SQ, I bought you instead of PYPL cuz you seem to have a direction...love the Cash App as well!"
History repeating it’s self. The whalers have started to sell. It happens ever time right before ER. They aren’t done yet. It gets driven down and then they buy back in. Watch and see for yourself.
Anybody know who the analyst is at Jeffries?
"I see SQ is still sputtering in the $240-260 range as it will for the rest of time. They still have no business plan or cohesive strategy for growth. Just bitcoin purses, Jay-Z and Tidal....all 3 that no one cares about or wants."
SQ is undervalued. SQ is growing a whole lot faster than Paypal but it's not trading at the premium it deserves.
"With Square backing Bitcoin and with Bitcoin holdings, why aren't they rallying more? It seems that they should be near all time highs right now"
Ok everyone. Didn’t I say the manipulation was done! Now back to $300! Last opportunity… $PYPL $SQ
Square CEO Jack Dorsey said late on Friday the company might jump into the bitcoin mining business.
SQ has been consolidating for nearly a year now. We're due for a breakout soon I would think...
"Square UPGRADED to Buy from Hold with a price target of $300 (up from $265) at JefferiesJefferies analyst Trevor Williams upgraded Square to Buy from Hold with a price target of $300, up from $265, after assuming coverage of the name. Square is a ""must-own"" over the long term as a ""proven innovator"" within payments, Williams tells investors in a research note. The analyst sees a ""long runway for share gains"" for the company's Seller and views the Cash App as the leader within the ""crowded"" neobank category. Further, the Afterpay deal has the potential to be 12% to Square's pro forma gross profit by fiscal 2025, says Williams."
