Incredible the revenues of this company ! Dorsey is a genius !!
Hadrian Level Solutions (St. Fentanyl) is back with more pollution. Bad day in market today. NASDAQ down ~200. Lots of tech getting creamed including SQ. Been way way up for awhile so a (big) pullback overdue. Will see how it plays out this week. $240-250's wouldn't surprise at all.
U buying sq is like charlie munger/buffet buying mastercard back then
292 possibly tomorrow? I got in late on calls and I’m down big. All I need is about 4-5% to be all good. So I’m praying this will rebound to 290s. please
"I thought earnings were to be reported on Thursday, August 5th. Why are they posted on their website in advance? Can anyone explain this to me? Thanks in advance"
Shorts are in trouble! This can easily run up over 10 points today!
SQ is becoming a major player in the financial world! Go SQ!
"Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, SQ "
After pay is pretty big in Europe and SQ isn’t. Is that being overlooked?
"If SQ goes above 266 and closes above 262 today, it will continue going up at least until Friday."
I just got an email from Zelle saying they are expanding to allow business payments with only a 1% charge. With pay by mobile phone becoming more of an accepted payment practice will this cut into Squares market share?
"Square price target raised to $365 from $325 at Truist, BUYSquare UPGRADED to Outperform from Market Perform with a $343 price target (from 266) at CowenSquare price target raised to $335 from $330 at Rosenblatt, BUYSquare price target raised to $325 from $281 at Keefe Bruyette, OUTPERFORMSquare price target raised to $320 from $295 at BTIG, BUYSquare price target raised to $312 from $305 at RBC, OutperformSquare price target raised to $310 from $280 at Canaccord, BUY"
"Separately, Square reported a jump of more than 143% in its total net revenue for the second quarter.The payments firm, led by Twitter boss Jack Dorsey, posted total net revenue of $4.68 billion for the quarter ended in June, compared to $1.92 billion last year."
"if small businesses are folding everywhere, how much longer can SQ keep going up? Maybe it is time to buy some GLD."
Dumping into the close!
"Relax the shares were up huge yesterday, square will be fine"
"So Square net profit was 200 mil in Q2, while Coinbase was 1.6 billion. Square stock somehow valued 175% higher."
"SQ shorts literally cause me to bust a gut laughing whenever I read their unintelligent, uniformed posts about how SQ is a bad company and worst investment. If that's truly the case, somebody is going to have to explain my 500 plus percent return since investing in March 2020. We'll see what they say when that turns into a 1000 percent gain. At this point my return is so big that even a significant drop doesn't cause me to lose anywhere close to a gigantic portion of my profits. Those who think SQ is going back to the double digits also likely believe we are going to ditch electricity and return to oil lamps. Digital transactions, like light bulbs in the late 1800s, are the future."
SQ will be heading North Pole tomorrow.
AFRM is UP by more than $30.00; that should have positive impact on SQ.

"This is the best entry point to load more, before it hits $300. For short term investors, do take profit when it hits $320, and expect some pullback in Sept. For long term investors, can just leave it as the financials forecast can support SQ to hits $500 by end of this year."
Shorts are sounding scared this morning. I hear panic in their derogatory posts.
Shorts. Cover before u lose ur life savings
Endless selling on SQ from ARK funds. Non stops for weeks
It's a great day to own SQ.
why is this company taking such a negative hit? is there negative news release someplace?
Bought only 15 share @ $239 down pre market
ARKK and ARKF dumped another $40million on SQ yesterday. SQ's weight in ARKK has fallen below 4%.
Shorts please exit your positions to avoid more losses
The eps is getting pushed up 30 cents every 90 days. SQ wll earn over $2 a share by year end at least. $300 is the floor on this thing. Easy $1000 a share stock.
"Jul 15, 2021 - PayPal's Venmo has more than 70 million users, with steady user growth expected in the future. Square's Cash App has 36 million users, and yet people wonder who is dominating the space. Not to mention PYPL's profit margin is 22.80% vs the profit margin of SQ at only 2.72%, and SQ is trading at 464% more P/E than PYPL. SQ's 361 P/E is not good comparted it's peers with such low profit margin. Both companies are good, but one is greater and way more stable."
30% dilution - see you at 150 -160 this week. Worse when the September market collapse hits.
"Square pre-market is not overrated as many investors have started to realise this is not a bad deal by referring after share price in Jun’21; rather, seems that this is an underpriced deal."
"Unbelievable, another day of buying opportunity! I am going to load up more today! Thanks shorts!"
It pays to hold. Been holding my shares since 2016 at $17.
"Director McElvey James Morgan dumped 200,000 shares AH today."
Looks like folks like the acquisition …I thought SQ would open at $225
"Yesterday's gain, today's losses. Stock goes nowhere."
"Sold @280. Re-entry target was 264 last week, didn’t happen. Now: 257 (thumbs up)…or is this draining for the rest of the month (thumbs down)"
"SQ will reach all time highs next week. Stay long, stay strong, ignore the have nots!"
Incoming dilution of approx 22 % but you get + 1 Company and a public market trading in Australia.You also get more customers into the core business of Square which will show up in the summer of 2022.Good deal imo.
Bullish Rectangle over the last couple days. Waiting for it to break out to that next leg higher
"By purchasing Afterpay, Sq is pandering into lending business with no collateral basis. Too risky, they took on the entire liability of all transactions. Hope they can get out of this deal if possible."
sq could hit $295 tomorrow.
Cash App is the catalyst. Square adding massive foundation for growth. Ride it for 5 years and retire.
who sold at 235 during pre market ?
SQ going to $300 or higher by THIS Friday.
What are chances of s&p 500 adding SQ to the index this week? MXIM will be likely removed on Aug 26th as ADI will close on that day. Two companies that meet all s&p requirements are ZM and SQ.
"Options will win the day today but feel very good with this for the next few months… graph is definite upswing price wise, making partnerships and ensuring growth with buying companies, one of the “loved” companies of CNBC, and headed for stardom! This is a juggernaut. It can go up $15–$30 a share in a day."
"This stock has actually done really well, close to its all time high's again.Other Cathie Wood top stocks like TDOC, Z, SPOT etc are still 40 or 50% off their all time high's."
"shorts, you pain has only just begun."
Hey there!! This thing is popping in the wrong direction Jack - do something!
Making money is the plan and with Bitcoin Investment your plans can be fulfilled
I bought at $287 today was that a bad move?
Will SQ correct this week or continue to climb?
"After all, this may close in the green today."
This is a $1000 stock in 3 years
Why are all the bears so quiet today? They love to hate on great companies.
"If SQ paid $29B for this, then $HOOD is going to be worth $50B plus, double current stock price, $1.3B revenue, $7.8B cash and over 18M of GenZ,…to the moon!!!"
S&P 500! Prepare for take off!
"BTC $50,000 next up??? see ACRX is running again, 6x upside on ACRX... $TSLA bitcoin thanks you, oh & $SQ too..."
$300 after earnings. Don’t be left in the dust when this takes off.
Hope you guys loaded up. 
$300 by Thursday
"Please go read the Afterpay reports - world's best bnpl offering by far. They are adding ~23,000+ customers every single day on average and have 30%+ return on capital and turn it over 15 X a year plus. SQ will get so many synergies it's crazy. great deal for both sides. Do your own research and don't rely on me. not financial advice. just for information only."
"Since Cramer disagrees with the Afterpay acquisition, then it must be a great acquisition."
ok so news hits PM drops to $235 and markets open and goes to $280.. Say what? this market ant rigged / FUD
SQ opens tomorrow Sub $200. Stock is so diluted now it has only one direction to go. DOWNBest to cover in premarket or lose everything. 30 billion for what????
Why are they up 10% since they missed their revenue numbers?
Short cover now $380 very soon?
I love this company and it’s different business components. I get it all except one acquisition. How does Square monetize Tidal? Is it just by having more “users” linked to their cash app? Just trying to understand how this can eventually help the stock.
"Does anyone have any news? I know they were talking about accepting more Crypto lately and settling lawsuits, but I doubt that is moving this thing. Wow!"
"Shorts are getting roasted today, and I’m loving it!"
12 hours till Black September starts -
"this is nothing but a WIN/WIN for both, SQ has made an excellent deal. Don't let the shorts scare you, if you are able buy more SQ. I sure did this morning and will be doubling up myself. SQ is a winner short term, long term if you have the nerve and money to load up. IMHO"
Wall street is having a fit because the Fed will slow bond buying by year end.
"Analysts expecting 4.99B in revenue(avg), this will report 4.68"
Black September begins this week -
Dilution of $29 Billion purchase is nearly 25% of SQ mkt cap but the installment company only adds 5% of the revenue. SQ stock should have fallen to $ 220.00 a share.
Wasting $29 Billion on an Australian installment plan is simply bad management.
SQ is making a turn to the green side today. Cover and go long!
"You guys need to remember, as long as Bitcoin is doing well, SQ will too. 8 Days til ER & counting "
I think it’s because of the platform outage. Today’s conditions going forward back to school and no one wants to travel internationally because of delta there is going to be a lot of spending and borrowing going on inside the USA and Chinese stocks dipping constantly all those investors will be pouring in to u.s stocks especially Bitcoin and square tomorrow square who doesn’t love jack dorsi leadership and super strong business crafts reputation and genius mind square is going to be back up and hitting new highs IMHO look at where the support has been this is amazing. I bought this dip a boatload and tomorrow is the glory day for square amen
this morning: Square price target raised to $345 from $340 at BarclaysBarclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal raised the firm's price target on Square to $345 from $340 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares.
"Folks SQ is in the nascent stage of an epic run. Stay long, stay strong and add on any dips!"
Shorts getting hosed.
"$SQ I think a lot of you are forgetting that Cash App users also tend not have banking accounts which is why their engagement stepped up in 2020 due to pandemic stimulus checks. You know what also just started? Monthly Child Tax Credit payments. If you use Cash App you get to use the money quicker and those parents will be using the card to buy clothes, school supplies, and groceries. Bullish for $TGT too."
Square posts upbeat profits while also announcing $29 billion deal for Afterpay…. in all stock deal  Why did SQ announce upbeat results prior to a scheduled release date and announcing the acquisition at the same time? Could it be a window dressing? PR stunt? Any thoughts?
"SQ reported revenue for Q2 of $4.68 bn, up 143% YoY. While it is lower than consensus (5.03 bn), how frequently do you see a company with consistently high growth like this? In 5 years it will join 2Tn club."
ValueAct builds $1.2 billion position in FISV. Thinks credit card processing business could challenge $SQ Square and become a $185B business by 2024. Clover worth $35-40B alone today.
Finally put that double top to bed with new high today…$300 soon
"IMHO, in August we will see some small correction. Anyone with me? No need to insult to disagree, just wondering how others feel about the market. GLTA! $MA $V $GOOGL $AMZN $CMCSA $JPM $SQ $VOO"
"Square upgraded to Outperform from Market Perform at Cowen Cowen analyst George Mihalos upgraded Square (SQ) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $343, up from $266. The analyst is ""bullish"" on the Afterpay (AFTPF) acquisition and sees the deal as accretive to Square's long-term profit growth even before revenue synergies. Mihalos expects ""levers for additional estimate upside"" relative to consensus expectations for Square. The company offered ""best of breed"" industry growth before the acquisition and post deal it should see pro-forma gross profit growth over 30%, even without synergies, Mihalos tells investors in a research note. He sees ""multiple sources"" of upside for Square and recommends buying the stock now.https://seekingalpha.com/news/3723728-square-upgraded-to-outperform-at-cowen-as-afterpay-set-to-turbo-boost-growth"

Square is about to pop. Do I see 300?
Who’s sold in PM? Lol
"PEG Ratio is under one and the mkt cap to sales is under 7. Square has been offering crypto trading for many years more than PYPL and others, and it shows in their sales growth numbers. They are executing on banking and digital finance with many innovative products and more ""decentralized financial services"" to come. A great buy for short and long term."
Epic battle expected at opening! Shorts will try hard!
Wow! Sq is priced higher than PYPL again.All is possible in the stock market.
Could we see a spike $273 next week?
SQ has now been profitable four quarters in a row which makes it eligible for S&P500 inclusion. Feels like this is slightly under the radar as an upcoming catalyst!
"I don’t understand how certain things that happen effect the movement in a stock. So asking, would Cathie Wood selling shares this morning make this stock go up?"
JP Morgan PT $320 from $300
Are you kidding me. Who would sell this stock. If you sell this stock you have no idea how to invest.
SQ $500 by December 2021
"So they want to add a service similar to PayPal credit. Micro loans. Got it. So why not just DO that by adding a few lines of code for little to no cost?? Why pay 29bil?? Are they just lazy? Desperate for artificial growth by absorbing another company? Checked their earnings report. Yep, they missed on revenue. SQ has a PE of 447 and a Fwd PE of 129. So they are scrambling to add revenue to justify their over-priced valuation."
shorts covering will start soon
Excellent company and leadership. SQ will dominate and transform the financial industry as we know it!Well done longs!
"In long term, it is a good deal to buy Afterpay just by issuing stocks, not cash outlay. In short term, retail investors hate to see immediate dilution of their interest."
"If Paypal and many others can invent their own instalment plan, why does Square have to blow $29,000,000,000 . I have lost confidence."
Beware of Jim Cramer. Watch him on video admit to how he manipulated the market and read how Jon Stewart tore into him for telling all his viewers to buy Bear Stearns right before the company collapsed
"Barrons take on this ""deal"", ""Dorsey paid a 30% premium for a loss generating company""."
"When $SQ went public, it was disrespected, by wall street. It went below $9. Now, few years later, it is in stratosphere.I predict the same outcome, for $SOFI. Before, they build a skyscraper. They need to build the basement first. SoFi, before it becomes a skyscraper, is at the basement build up, metaphorically speaking,$14.30 price is a gift "
"Sold this for a nice profit up in the 280s, then bought into PYPL in the 260s. If SQ takes a header when the 10 year spikes to 1.6, I am def going to get back in. SQ is the future of banking and better than PYPL, just a really high valuation right here."
We should see 300 on this leg up. One of the best stocks on the market.
"SQ Square reiterated BUY with a $380 price target at MizuhoBuying Square could be like buying JPMorgan in 1871 Says MizuhoMizuho analyst Dan Dolev believes Square's (SQ) Cash App ""may be en route to becoming the ultimate neo-bank and the money center bank of the future."" This could make buying Square shares analogous to buying JPMorgan (JPM) in 1871, Dolev tells investors in a research note. The analyst's analysis of potential Cash App products ""shows a visible path"" to an average revenue per user of $150-$200, or 3-5 times above current levels. He estimates that the U.S. bank account total addressable market is 400M-500M accounts, which is more than 10 times the size of Cash App's current active user base. Cash App's gross profit could see 4-8 times growth over the coming years, says Dolev, who reiterates a Buy rating on Square with a $380 price target."
"SQ is going to pop over the next two days. It hits the support level, and waiting for next wave of $300. It meant to shoot up today, but pulled down due to Nasdaq Mkt pullback. It started off 2% up, and outperformed other counters. It will turn green by today, and pops over the next two days when switching from DJI to Nasdaq! Be patience and no panic, Watch up the next $300 level.. "
Afterpay is bigger than the total market cap of the next 9 biggest players in this market. They are a micro loans service that competes with credit cards. Huge win for SQ to acquire them and integrate them into their services network. Should be able to expand SQ's services into Afterpay's 86K customers.
"SQ is a disruptive fintech, trying to turn traditional banking upside down. Afterpay is only a piece of jigsaw puzzle to integrate its platform. Now, let us see how SQ to execute its plan in our new internet age."
What day are earnings?
This thing is overpriced by a about 10X.
Wow...  this pony can run...
"￼July Trends andForward-Looking CommentaryWe wanted to provide an update on the trends in our business during the month of July.business trendsSeller ecosystem• In July, we expect Seller to deliver strong gross profit growth year over year. Seller GPV is expected to be up more than 45% year over year in July, and the two-year CAGR is expected to be up 25%, compared to 22% growth in the second quarter on a two-year CAGR basis. GPV growth trends continued to vary by region, product, and vertical, depending primarily on differences in the timing and phases of reopenings.Cash App ecosystem• In July, we expect Cash App to deliver positive gross profit growth year over year while lapping strong growth from the prior-year period, with strong gross profit growth on a two-year CAGR basis.• We achieved strong engagement across products in our Cash App ecosystem. Gross profit growth also benefited from customers pulling more funds into their Cash App accounts.Growth comparisons: Looking ahead to the remainder of 2021, we believe two-year compound annual growth rates from 2019 through 2021 will help reflect underlying trends in each ecosystem. In the third quarter of 2021, Cash App will lap strong gross profit growth of 212% year over year in the third quarter of 2020. On the other hand, in the third quarter of 2021, Seller will lap only 12% year-over-year gross profit growth in the third quarter of 2020 due to regional restrictions affecting in-person activity."
Square is getting so much benefits from reopening than PayPal. This earnings will clearly show it.
Bottomline growth is crazy. This is way cheaper than PayPal. Valuation is tricky but upside should be obvious in short term.
Sq going to 1000
I think $280 today
"Literally hundreds of companies that do what afterpay, does and this deal is likely very dilutive to square. PayPal and other companies have created their own pay later services at a fraction of the cost. Why is the stock being rewarded for overpaying for what really is a subprime lending business"
jack speaking at btc conference in an hour with Musk and Cathie Wood. this will fly 
CNBC just had the options analysts thinking the stock tanks because it very overvalued. Who knows.
What is to stop Visa and MasterCard from adding the same installment plan on larger purchases ?
"Pre-market today looked ugly but SQ is currently trading up over 8% with this deal announced over the weekend. Offense in fintech is key to relevance and you have to innovate or buy your way. All stock deal does not involve more debt and if the merged entity grows revenue and profits, I am all for it. JD has rewarded shareholders handsomely so I am holding and I have great confidence in his vision and leadership. We shall see if after the merger, SQ has a market cap similar to V, MA or PYPL or more in a few years. God Bless and stay well."
"Chart is in great shape. If outlook is raised, this can break out and run."
"Don's call yesterday for SQ finishing in $250's this week not looking too good. He also predicted $225-240 ""soon"" and $250's ""a year from now"". Take note and mark your calendars so we all know he told us so. @ Broken Clock (right once every twelve hour)"
SQ will perform exactly as it did in 2018 - blow off top/ All time high August - 52 Week Low November.
"This is the pullback you've been waiting for. By next Thursday when they report, the downward sentiment on these stocks will be over. SQ will rise bigtime after earnings."
SQ will be in the best position for S&P500 addition in the coming round. This is one of the strongest Covid19-proven stock. Hooray!!!! Get ready for the surge!!
I’d bet we finish in the green today!
"SQ is still on a downward trend and will stay on the sideline for the time being, it may find support at the 200 DMA of $230."
"I've paid a lot of people over the last month with CashApp : lawn service, house cleaning, moving etc. That app is not only easy, but has wide usage among small businesses. Equal to, if not larger than Venmo.Now AfterPay will open up new users to their platform."
"At $ROKU $SQ $SNAP $SHOP Valuation Multiples, BIDU (Baidu) is a $8000 worth stock."
going green
Best stock I have ever owned.
"Lots of investors without business knowledge tends to judge by looking at surface, and believe a tech giant to make stupid deal. One should put in some effort of why the purchase price, square can move so long and beats all competitors for a reason. Imagine a layman will pay premium for nothing? Not to say this is a decision with full of elite behind.. There are just too many short investors here, worried about the news, as the technical chart (prior to news) was suggested a pull back. Those who studied the financials and projection will surely understand this acquisition worths more than it."
"Keep holding SQ, and you will be greatly rewarded. Am still holding over 5K shares of SQ since 2016, cost basis: $17."
$VENA $SQ $TSLA This is ‘a great long-term story’
Been with SQ for years and years. Same old story. Take it down pre earnings so it can run after. Buying opportunity !! WATCH AND LEARN KIDS!

Think how much market cap from traditional banks this sq cash app gonna siphon Just its payment gateway alone will siphon 800billion in market cap from visa and master card alone. Do the math

I don't like SQ !==strong sell!
Let me get this straight. Issue 25 percent more shares and overpay for a very risky business that's losing money.I guess this is why the insider's get paid the big bucks.Just go ON cCNBC and push your bookGreat salesmanship.

"You know the news is good when the Spam on this board intensifies. Based on the amount of paid trolls on the board now, I’m thinking we are breaking $300 soon. "
Crazy My first purchase of SQ was 12/2017. 75 shares at $13.32 Up 20k on that purchase alone!
"So SQ announced blow-out earnings but missed on revenue, we'll see if we pull a paypal... The question i have with the acquisition of Afterpay, Will it be accretive to SQ's bottom line?Square agreed to pay $29 billion for Afterpay, an Australian fintech specializing in buy now/pay later services. The digital payments leader also released Q2 results ahead of Thursday's scheduled date. Square earnings per share spiked 266% to 66 cents with revenue up 266% to $4.68 billion. Analysts expected EPS of 30 cents on sales of $5.03 billion."
Almost a 10% position short in SQ— keeping the share price from running up…. They have a pretty strong hold on it and we need to break that.
$360 by end of month

I bought 1 share at 214 just because I had some extra money. I should have put more time in to it.
Love this stock. Huge future. Only have a couple of shares. I will continue to build future wealth through AMD
"you all know that the acquisition of AfterPay is a very good strategic move, right? it will take SQ to the next level, to $400+"
Mega dilution
"My guess is today’s action is from both a short squeeze ( more like a squish), as well as institutional/mutual fund purchases. Some large blocks are coming through, which is institutional."
"It will probably finish the week in the 250s. One year from now, it will still be sputtering in the 250s. Stock price doesn't go up because of the Afterpay blunder, the Tidal blunder, Jay-Z on the board and no coherent strategy moving forward. Consumers do have options other than SQ which is why this stock will stay where it is. The only future for SQ is to be sold to a bigger fish who will end up dumping the trash like Bitcoin, Tidal, etc."

In my experience the purchasing company stocks usually are going down in near term. Might be great move on the long run but on the short term it is a huge dilution to the stock due to being “all stock deal”.

"Just came back from vacation. People everywhere, lines everywhere, traffic everywhere and SQ everywhere."
Just feel this is teetering on big drop. ZM was probably excuse to sell. Asinine.
"SQ is in the best position to scoop in the fin tech banking system. Don’t try to short it, else will surely get burnt. With the latest research, it will reach $300 by this week in view of Bitcoin rocks and back on centre stage. Afterpay expansion just come at the right time with huge expansion plan."
"Today: Square price target raised to $353 from $317 at Evercore ISIEvercore ISI analyst David Togut raised the firm's price target on Square to $353 from $317 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. Following a deep dive into Cash App's key monetization channels, he sees ""material upside"" to consensus Cash App gross profit estimates in FY21 through FY23, Togut tells investors."
Congrats Long. Well deserved. I woke up at 5am for this. Amazing.
$350 by the end of the year! A stock to hold forever
"I used Square for a business years ago. I liked the platform, easy to use and set up taking payments from a mobile phone into my bank account."
why is SQ up so much...is it because word is out that I've been loading up the truck?
"So I’m a little confused, pre market, it hit about $234, which is about 3% down and then took off like anything. Was there a news right before open? I’m a bull btw"
"Told you all .....$300 after earnings. Man, I love being correct."
Does SQ have a moat that protects it from other companies trying to encroach on their business? What is Square's moat?
16 million more customers will be on the Cash App platform!!!
Anyone know how long it may take SQ to recoup this Afterpay investment?
Ye of little faith! SQ is a stock to OWN not to TRADE.
"SQ is not going to miss target, but beat it like they have done nearly every time. Look at past expectations & reports - mostly exceeded massively!"
2022. 4-500 per share. 2025 900-1021 per share. Square has the largest eco system out there. Ride the train.
Lol Must be looking good for SQ when the chat is getting spammed by bears/shorts
Buy . . . or sell . . . 8/13 $300 calls ?
"Ya don’t mess around w/ Square, the future of banking…"
Lets hope this time it sticks. Really need this stock to pick up the pace. Just retired and need some 2x stocks to give me a buffer for the downturns.

"Hurry up Dorsey, get more advice from Jay Z - $50 Billion for Popeyes fried chicken and Ball bonds - Make the Square EBT Card ecosystem complete!"
"Just read the full 29 page earnings report release on the square website, and those are killer results across the board…growing everything (revenues, earnings, key stats) at pretty much 100% year over year…and the acquisition can only make them bigger and stronger…impressed, and happy to own this stock seeing results like this."

"We are starting to get upgrades and price increases, so hang in there. ODDO BHF upgrades from neutral to outperform and 340 pt.Could finish the week in the green!"
Massive swing from this morning - can anyone shed any light as to what happened?
Close at 281 !!!!
"Jack's reaction to stock tanking.....""Bitcoin and Jay-Z is all we need!"""
"Sold 8/6 $300 calls, will collect premium for upside covered calls on this weekly for months . ."
"Sq premarket only down 1.5% from over 5% earlier. Markets probably realising that their revenue minus Bitcoin was still up a tonne, EPS basically doubled quarter on quarter and they just plucked the best independant bnpl provider out to add a financial element they didn't have previously. Could very well finish in the green today"
When will this go above $300 I’m in the red should I hold or sell I bought at $287 if I sell would I make profit by buying at a lower price
"bought a put for 3.25, sold for 5.35 no regrets"
Two days left in the week and SQ is closing in on the 260s range just as I predicted. Thanks Jack.
Has anyone read or listened to Peter Schiff's explanation on Square's acquisition of Afterpay? Wanted to hear what you guys think..thx.
CNBC analysts were predicting a trip to $230. They were caught on the wrong foot.
"Afterpay for 29 billion dollars.If SQ increases its stock by 20% or so, they will have purchased afterpay for free. We are close to 10% already.What a genius move buying with stock only!"
"""Afterpay posts bigger annual loss""this cant be good news for SQ can it ?"
"Monday volume 45 mil. with price +10% up, Tuesday volume 21 mil. with price -2% down. Last Sunday most writers here predicted -10% to -15% down for next market opening!!!"
$25 Billion in stock is around 104 million sharea depending on price. Current outstanding shares is only 392 million share or implied outstanding at 455 shares. Thats a large amount.
Today's $SQ buyout of Afterpay is the perfect set up for SOFI acquisition by $HOOD as there seems to be a chatter for Vlad doing an immediate acquisition with the IPO funds and stock.

"SQ is finally starting to get the long overdue recognition from the street on its earnings. Owning this company has been great for the last 3 years but earning didn't start being treated correctly until really last quarter or possibly the quarter before that. These earnings were spectacular and the acquisition of Afterpay on top of that significantly narrows the gap between SQ and rival PYPL. This should be key in helping their free cash flow to reach into the billions. Overall this quarter and now the possession of Afterpay is a serious blow to the bear case. Bitcoin will continue to make SQ volatile but the fact this company continues to do all the right things should be an indication that this is a name you want to hold long term, not own for a trade."
"P.M looks good, hope we can keep the green EOD."
"Aggressively SQ is striving to be a disruptive fintech stock, I want to see its evolving."
Its just down by 4%+ pre market. No need to panic yet. On a normal day SQ can drop 5% for no reason at all. It did go up from 200 to 260's recently quite fast..so its just a normal pullback.
Square to offer individuals FDIC insured savings accounts and CDs
Hyper growth stock for long term.
"Shorts are getting crushed today, and I’m loving it."
They say stocks go up on the escalator but come down in the elevator. This one is doing the exact opposite!
$300 today. Quote me.
"$380 price target on Square. My cost average is $38.78 it’s a long time keeper, good for the next 20 years"
$VENA $SQ $BABA 1 years from now I’m will be thanking the person I am today for investing in these companys.
"They should rename SQ to Tomato, because it is always Red.Never close GreenMost of the time lowVery few days close in Green"
"Would NOT surprise me to see SQ back to $250 by week's end, by end of August $265 and by year's end $300."
"Only the beginning of a long, bullish career for Square "
Anyone think cash app will ever have pre and post market trading available in near future?
This recalls my memory about FB’s acquisition of Instagram. Vision is a hard thing to judge. You could always analyze this kind of crazy deal ex post. Being able to see it ex ante is the mystery talent of a successful CEO. Is Dorsey such material? He is doing fine so far and maybe he is right this time.￼
"Buy the dip, it won’t last. Afterpay appears to offer the functionality to link Square's two ecosystems in a more meaningful way, RBC Capital Markets says. The investment bank says fully integrating buy-now-pay-later into and between Square's Cash and Seller apps offers several strategic benefits. It should accelerate Square's growth with larger sellers and open new geographies, while also enhancing consumers' ability to manage repayments. RBC notes Afterpay customers will be able to access the Cash app's money-transfer and trading tools. Square's Ebitda margins will decrease modestly after the deal's completion, the bank says. RBC has a $305.00 a share target price and outperform rating on Square."
