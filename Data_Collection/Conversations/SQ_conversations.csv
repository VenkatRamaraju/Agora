Love this stock. Huge future. Only have a couple of shares. I will continue to build future wealth through AMD
this morning: Square price target raised to $345 from $340 at BarclaysBarclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal raised the firm's price target on Square to $345 from $340 and keeps an Overweight rating on the shares.
Crazy My first purchase of SQ was 12/2017. 75 shares at $13.32 Up 20k on that purchase alone!
We should see 300 on this leg up. One of the best stocks on the market.
What are chances of s&p 500 adding SQ to the index this week? MXIM will be likely removed on Aug 26th as ADI will close on that day. Two companies that meet all s&p requirements are ZM and SQ.
"Since Cramer disagrees with the Afterpay acquisition, then it must be a great acquisition."
Black September begins this week -
"SQ is a disruptive fintech, trying to turn traditional banking upside down. Afterpay is only a piece of jigsaw puzzle to integrate its platform. Now, let us see how SQ to execute its plan in our new internet age."
The eps is getting pushed up 30 cents every 90 days. SQ wll earn over $2 a share by year end at least. $300 is the floor on this thing. Easy $1000 a share stock.
$300 by Thursday
sq is a strong buy. any pullback is a opportunity to get in

Bullish Rectangle over the last couple days. Waiting for it to break out to that next leg higher
Does anyone knows if there is any special news regarding SQ in the aftermarket???
"When $SQ went public, it was disrespected, by wall street. It went below $9. Now, few years later, it is in stratosphere.I predict the same outcome, for $SOFI. Before, they build a skyscraper. They need to build the basement first. SoFi, before it becomes a skyscraper, is at the basement build up, metaphorically speaking,$14.30 price is a gift "
"Keep holding SQ, and you will be greatly rewarded. Am still holding over 5K shares of SQ since 2016, cost basis: $17."
"Ya don’t mess around w/ Square, the future of banking…"
"SQ is finally starting to get the long overdue recognition from the street on its earnings. Owning this company has been great for the last 3 years but earning didn't start being treated correctly until really last quarter or possibly the quarter before that. These earnings were spectacular and the acquisition of Afterpay on top of that significantly narrows the gap between SQ and rival PYPL. This should be key in helping their free cash flow to reach into the billions. Overall this quarter and now the possession of Afterpay is a serious blow to the bear case. Bitcoin will continue to make SQ volatile but the fact this company continues to do all the right things should be an indication that this is a name you want to hold long term, not own for a trade."
Square is about to pop. Do I see 300?
"It will probably finish the week in the 250s. One year from now, it will still be sputtering in the 250s. Stock price doesn't go up because of the Afterpay blunder, the Tidal blunder, Jay-Z on the board and no coherent strategy moving forward. Consumers do have options other than SQ which is why this stock will stay where it is. The only future for SQ is to be sold to a bigger fish who will end up dumping the trash like Bitcoin, Tidal, etc."
"Just read the full 29 page earnings report release on the square website, and those are killer results across the board…growing everything (revenues, earnings, key stats) at pretty much 100% year over year…and the acquisition can only make them bigger and stronger…impressed, and happy to own this stock seeing results like this."
"SQ is going to pop over the next two days. It hits the support level, and waiting for next wave of $300. It meant to shoot up today, but pulled down due to Nasdaq Mkt pullback. It started off 2% up, and outperformed other counters. It will turn green by today, and pops over the next two days when switching from DJI to Nasdaq! Be patience and no panic, Watch up the next $300 level.. "
Hadrian Level Solutions (St. Fentanyl) is back with more pollution. Bad day in market today. NASDAQ down ~200. Lots of tech getting creamed including SQ. Been way way up for awhile so a (big) pullback overdue. Will see how it plays out this week. $240-250's wouldn't surprise at all.
Does anyone know why the drop ???
"SQ shorts literally cause me to bust a gut laughing whenever I read their unintelligent, uniformed posts about how SQ is a bad company and worst investment. If that's truly the case, somebody is going to have to explain my 500 plus percent return since investing in March 2020. We'll see what they say when that turns into a 1000 percent gain. At this point my return is so big that even a significant drop doesn't cause me to lose anywhere close to a gigantic portion of my profits. Those who think SQ is going back to the double digits also likely believe we are going to ditch electricity and return to oil lamps. Digital transactions, like light bulbs in the late 1800s, are the future."
I just got an email from Zelle saying they are expanding to allow business payments with only a 1% charge. With pay by mobile phone becoming more of an accepted payment practice will this cut into Squares market share?
"Square Q2 Non-GAAP EPS of $0.66 beats by $0.35; GAAP EPS of $0.40 beats by $0.45.-> Revenue of $4.68B (+143.8% Y/Y). Excluding bitcoin, total net revenue was $1.96B vs. $1.55B in Q1 and up 87% Y/Y.-> Q2 gross payment volume increased 29% from the previous quarter as the Seller and Cash App ecosystems continue to gain traction.-> Q2 gross payment volume of $42.8B, up from $33.1B in Q1 and $22.8B in Q2 2020.-> Cash App reached 40M monthly transacting active customers in June.-> Q2 adjusted EBITDA of $360M, increased 53% Q/Q and more than tripled from $98M in Q2 2020.-> Seller ecosystem revenue of $1.31B increased 81% Y/Y and the business's gross profit of $585M rose 85%. On a two-year CAGR basis, revenue increased 23% and gross profit rose 30%.-> Q3 and year outlook: Square expects Seller to show strong gross profit growth Y/Y in July with Seller GPV expected to rise more than 45% Y/Y during the month; sees two-year CAGR up 25% vs. 22% growth in Q2.-> Expects Cash App to deliver positive gross profit growth Y/Y, while lapping strong growth from prior-year period, with strong gross profit growth on a two-year CAGR basis.-> Regarding the rest of 2021, Square expects two-year annual growth rates from 2019 through 2021 will reflect underlying trends in each ecosystem."
"If SQ builds up the ground at $260, it is firm to go surpass $300."
"SQ is in the best position to scoop in the fin tech banking system. Don’t try to short it, else will surely get burnt. With the latest research, it will reach $300 by this week in view of Bitcoin rocks and back on centre stage. Afterpay expansion just come at the right time with huge expansion plan."
Almost a 10% position short in SQ— keeping the share price from running up…. They have a pretty strong hold on it and we need to break that.
SQ going to $300 or higher by THIS Friday.
S&P 500! Prepare for take off!

"Buy the dip, it won’t last. Afterpay appears to offer the functionality to link Square's two ecosystems in a more meaningful way, RBC Capital Markets says. The investment bank says fully integrating buy-now-pay-later into and between Square's Cash and Seller apps offers several strategic benefits. It should accelerate Square's growth with larger sellers and open new geographies, while also enhancing consumers' ability to manage repayments. RBC notes Afterpay customers will be able to access the Cash app's money-transfer and trading tools. Square's Ebitda margins will decrease modestly after the deal's completion, the bank says. RBC has a $305.00 a share target price and outperform rating on Square."
"""Afterpay posts bigger annual loss""this cant be good news for SQ can it ?"
"This is the best entry point to load more, before it hits $300. For short term investors, do take profit when it hits $320, and expect some pullback in Sept. For long term investors, can just leave it as the financials forecast can support SQ to hits $500 by end of this year."
Hope you guys loaded up. 
This is a $1000 stock in 3 years

Endless selling on SQ from ARK funds. Non stops for weeks
"Don's call yesterday for SQ finishing in $250's this week not looking too good. He also predicted $225-240 ""soon"" and $250's ""a year from now"". Take note and mark your calendars so we all know he told us so. @ Broken Clock (right once every twelve hour)"
ValueAct builds $1.2 billion position in FISV. Thinks credit card processing business could challenge $SQ Square and become a $185B business by 2024. Clover worth $35-40B alone today.
Shorts are in trouble! This can easily run up over 10 points today!
Has anyone read or listened to Peter Schiff's explanation on Square's acquisition of Afterpay? Wanted to hear what you guys think..thx.
"Separately, Square reported a jump of more than 143% in its total net revenue for the second quarter.The payments firm, led by Twitter boss Jack Dorsey, posted total net revenue of $4.68 billion for the quarter ended in June, compared to $1.92 billion last year."
Lol Must be looking good for SQ when the chat is getting spammed by bears/shorts
Wall street is having a fit because the Fed will slow bond buying by year end.
$VENA $SQ $TSLA This is ‘a great long-term story’
Two days left in the week and SQ is closing in on the 260s range just as I predicted. Thanks Jack.
"Afterpay for 29 billion dollars.If SQ increases its stock by 20% or so, they will have purchased afterpay for free. We are close to 10% already.What a genius move buying with stock only!"
Shorts are sounding scared this morning. I hear panic in their derogatory posts.
Short cover now $380 very soon?
Are you kidding me. Who would sell this stock. If you sell this stock you have no idea how to invest.
I think it’s because of the platform outage. Today’s conditions going forward back to school and no one wants to travel internationally because of delta there is going to be a lot of spending and borrowing going on inside the USA and Chinese stocks dipping constantly all those investors will be pouring in to u.s stocks especially Bitcoin and square tomorrow square who doesn’t love jack dorsi leadership and super strong business crafts reputation and genius mind square is going to be back up and hitting new highs IMHO look at where the support has been this is amazing. I bought this dip a boatload and tomorrow is the glory day for square amen
U buying sq is like charlie munger/buffet buying mastercard back then
SQ will be in the best position for S&P500 addition in the coming round. This is one of the strongest Covid19-proven stock. Hooray!!!! Get ready for the surge!!
AFRM is UP by more than $30.00; that should have positive impact on SQ.
"Congrats longs on BTC heading back above $50,000.00"
"If SQ goes above 266 and closes above 262 today, it will continue going up at least until Friday."
"Hurry up Dorsey, get more advice from Jay Z - $50 Billion for Popeyes fried chicken and Ball bonds - Make the Square EBT Card ecosystem complete!"
