"let's see what happens today with this one. the company is denying and an analyst upgraded it, the accusers are saying it is true. the market will decide who is right. i do find it suspicious that the stock is only up 4 points pre market after being down 16 friday."
"if this story is true,,,,stock could be under 30 on Monday !......SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS"
Piper Jeffries set new PT at $47
"Hmmm, I guess the shorts got squeezed out, huh?"
"EGBN being bid up +4% after hours now. Seems like the carnage today was overkill. Im looking to initiate a long position tomorrow at the open. Last time in 2017, EGBN bounced all the way back up after the same allegations. Old news = will rebound"
"I have invested in this stock since the SHORT SELLER debacle , I have seen NOTHING that suggests thatEagle Management did anything out of the ordinary to warrant such a selloff and on top of that THESE law firms have not issued any news of the company doing anything wrong. THE REBOUND in the stock price IF there was any improprietywould not be pushing 60,,,,,it would be below 40. That being said I cannot see this going back to the 63 to 65 level in the next few weeks."
"Maybe Trump is right, false news. EGBN has categorically denied the allegations by Aurelius. I hope they sue them. Sorry for those who sold at a loss. This is criminal."
what's the deal with these shorts?
$45. tomorrow!
Holy #$%$! $52!!! Good gain!
Too bad if u didn’t buy any at $47
I cant imagine this not going back to 60 today when it sinks in this was fake news ignited by short sellers !
"Company came out and a counter knock out punch. Saw a heavy increase in shorts in the months leading up to attack. Aurelius made his $$$, hope the rest of the shorts got out. I’m sure he is already."
Wow back above $50!!!
What good are brokers besides scaring clients to sell /buy by impulses instead of reason????!!!!
twitter is saying the CEO did something bad with loans for his family
Spam makes this a worthless board!
This is the same group that wrote about EGBN
"Where there’s smoke, there’s fire!"
"In late 2017 Aurelius Value warned of problematc insider loans and other perilous behaviors. Eagle said they were evil short sellers.Or not, I guess."
"The Company has defended itself very well by CEO Ron Paul SEE ARTICLES,,,GOOGLE it !,,,,,,The price should rebound to the low 60s in the next few weeks,,,,,theres no reason for it not to !"
I think 30% drop in price is punishment enough. Probably oversold under 50

where's the dividend?
"Fool.com (exactly my thoughts): What Eagle Bancorp didn't do is quantify its exposure to loans made to insiders, or companies where the bank's insiders have a financial interest. I take that to mean that Eagle Bancorp does have substantial exposure to such loans.Only time will tell who is right and who is wrong, but the market seems to be giving Eagle Bancorp a little more credit after hearing its side of the story on Monday."
Don’t touch this till it gets back to $51
"Current price is way below 8,21 and 200 day Moving averages, which means it is in control of bears. tomorrow if it breaks Friday's low who knows where it will close by 4 pm on Monday."
