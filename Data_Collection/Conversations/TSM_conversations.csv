"I purchased last week 200 for 114.64 believing that it was a great chance to buy on dip for a shot term speculation. Well, now gonna hold till the cows come home.However, it appears that the we've already reached the lowest price because it had cost 108 only twice since January.Your thoughts?"
"Guidance is positive....Q3 2021 Outlook: Revenue is now expected to be between $14.6B and $14.9B. previous average was $14.44B.This coupled with small EPS beat might be enough to cushion the fall, despite the revenue miss..."
Did they just raise the price of lower end chips?
Timing is everything to buy TSM at 112.
"taiwan is not china. it will go bigger than expected next year with arizona, german, Japan...accumulate and wait"
"l can't think of any other industries except EV and semi which have an assured exponential growth prospect at least for the next 5 - 10 years. A once in a life time opportunity, grap it and make the best out it to earn enough money pay for deposits of a nice house."
Nice consolidation taking place. Can't wait for it to break out. The best semiconductor company I. the world with all the major players depending on them. All with a forward PE of less than 25!
"This $150 Million Machine Keeping Moore’s Law Alive ASSMLintroduced the first extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines for mass production in 2017, after decades spent mastering the technique. The machines perform a crucial role in the chipmaking ecosystem, and they have been used in the manufacture of the latest, most advanced chips, including those in new iPhones as well as computers used for artificial intelligence. The company’s next EUV system, a part of which is being built in Wilton, Connecticut, will use a new trick to minimize the wavelength of light it uses—shrinking the size of features on the resulting chips and boosting their performance—more than ever before.The current generation of EUV machines are already, to put it bluntly, kind of bonkers. Each one is roughly the size of a bus and costs $150 million. It contains 100,000 parts and 2 kilometers of cabling. Shipping the components requires 40 freight containers, three cargo planes, and 20 trucks. Only a few companies can afford the machines, and most of them go to the world’s big three leading-edge chipmakers: the world’s leading foundry, Taiwan-based TSMC, as well as Samsung, in South Korea, and Intel.https://www.wired.com/story/asml-extreme-ultraviolet-lithography-chips-moores-law/"
This company is a king of semi
"From Mac RumorsApple and Intel are testing their chip designs with TSMC's 3-nanometer production technology, according to several sources briefed on the matter, with commercial output of such chips expected to start in the second half of next year."
"Steady fall since mid -Feb . Go ahead thumb down the charts . Thumb down the truth if it doesn’t suit you . If the truth is negative it’s not true If the truth is positive it’s true The truth is what you want it to be What is , isn’t if you don’t want it to be . These posts are a joke and are a reflection of the state of the masses in this country in 2021 . Objectivity does not exist here. Even mathematics is subjective in America . Delusion and Denial reign strong in the good old USA  . Please leave thumbs down . That’s evidence of the truth . That’s proof"
What bs
What is wrong with this stock? Why can’t it get going? Just stuck
"Man SP is like the water in an old house, dripping down quietly and drips everyday."
TSMC is an absolute beast of a company. The market will eventually wake up to realize this and not let US/Chinese political worries interfere. The stock deserves so much more love than what it has gotten this year. No bigger better positioned semiconductor company in the industry right now. Well except $ASML and maybe $AMAT.
"Latest news is that Tsm may change its policy to set up fabs in Dresden, Germany and Japan's Kumamoto district. Serious talks had taken place. Germany aim at 12nm and 16nm chips mainly needed for their auto industry which have experienced serious chips shortage. A huge European semi conductor industry consortium is involved.Japan is keen on the higher end chips. ln short, lots of actions are going on behind the scene.Tsm is entering a period of expoential growth in the coming 10 years.Good luck to all."
Just opened my position this morning along with INTC. Big win for all foundries!!!
"Intel is the world’s largest semiconductor company. Its main business is PC processor and server chip business. These two businesses gave them a leading position for more than 30 years. The Foundry manufacturing has also been a leader for a long time, but now all of this has been broken. $AMD $TSM $INTC"
@John short term agree. It had dropped for 6 days for me till I decided to sell to re evaluate my short term plan.
"1day -5day -1 month -6 month charts - horrible . Continuous down trend . Don’t thumb me , thumb the charts . Thumb the math , pretend the line is going up . Deluded and Denial is the game on Yahoo Finance App of shills ..."
"$TSM $ROKU $WIMI all we have to do is hold this stock till very high prices. Into the thousands, it’s costing us nothing for that. Our time will come. Yes it’s frustrating , but it’s the game we have to play to make life changing money. Patience !"
Got in yesterday ugh
Adding to my position with the dip to lower average cost.
"So what awaits us? hike 107 or 80? Now we are at exactly 200 MA, and judging by the activity of buyers, we are not going up. It's a pity, I was hoping for growth."
"No ones know until the chicken hatch...News is for far future, not today's date...it 'll sink tomorrow or even after this moment for sure...."
"The entire semi space is totally hyped up. Yes, there is chip shortage. But this will come to pass. These stocks have climbed 2X in the last 12 months. Investors are now waking up and realizing how over priced these companies are. Downside of at least 30% from here."
Is this a glitch or does TSM have well above 3 x cash on hand more than the share price? That makes no sense. Is this a currency conversion thing?
Do yourself a favor buy the dips we will be green and going back up Just bought 500
Don’t sell this company for 5 years.
"4 months of consolidation on the largest most advanced semiconductor company on the planet in a time where demand, profitability, and expansion have never been higher. A forward PE of only 25 in an industry with an average PE of around 32/33. Their superior tech, worldwide expansion, coupled with the shortage has only fueled the fire for their growth. They continually raise guidance leading into ERs and still beat expectations regularly. A breakout is immanent. Only question is how big will it be."

"What about China reclaiming its ""lost ""province? What me worry?"
looking for an entry point on this stock...108?? the medium long term future is green
"How can $TSM Market cap not be in the trillions with this revenue and earnings while apple, alphabet etc have incredible valuations without revenue to support?"
back over $120 shortly
"Lesson learned - luck is essential when you invest into a good company . After I sold . This stock raises , what the heck"
$TSM $VENA shows a very strong growth in Revenue. The Revenue has grown
Not buying TSM now is losing an opportunity
"This might be TSM savior after the miss. ""The Taiwanese company is also likely to get a lift from plans by Apple Inc., its largest customer, to ready 90 million units of upgraded iPhones for the second half of this year"""
Free at last.
"Weekly chart flashed a 'Sell' signal last week. Mild support at 110 and of course psychological support at 100. Gaps galore. Like so many other names, this moved too far too fast. No consolidation. Have to go down to 80 to find any real support. That area should provide a nice tradeable bounce."
"TSMC Receives 13k Job Applications For U.S. Chip Plant – Is An Expansion In Play?The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (TSMC) plans to build a chip manufacturing facility in Arizona might have more to them than meets the eye. Taking stock of TSMC's public announcements, the fab will invest $12 billion in Arizona over the course of the next few years, with the facility set to produce semiconductors on the 5nm process node in 2024.However, several rumors have hinted that TSMC is considering going beyond the initial scope of its announcements. Now, job applications for the seventeen posts open for TSMC's Arizona hint that perhaps something larger might be afoot, a fact that bolstered by the company hiring a decades-old Intel Corporation human resources and recruiting veteran for the Arizona plant at the start of this year.https://wccftech.com/tsmc-receives-13k-job-applications-for-u-s-chip-plant-is-an-expansion-in-play/"
"TSMC will gain in the 2nd half, 2021 as Qualcomm switches #5G chip orders over from Samsung, media report, saying Qualcomm could become TSMC's 2nd largest client for 7nm/6nm process technology in 2021, then 5nm/4nm in 2022. $TSM $QCOM #semiconductor"
If China attacks Taiwan the what will happen to TSM is what investors are worried. MU QCOM AMD AMAT are safer...
You can pull out TSM's financial statement and look at any metric and see this company is a semiconductor juggernaut .The only thing weighing on TSM is its massive capex(25-29 billion US)You have to remind yourself that the stock market is forward looking and for every dollar of capex TSM will get back more than 1 dollar
"Just made a video on why TSM is an good opportunity: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxNQOxgxFpo&lc=UgziX3U663tTylbzJcR4AaABAg&ab_channel=SafeInvesting-growth company with dividends-making laptop processors for Qualcomm-making 5nm or 3nm for Intel-apple m1 chips, Nvidia and AMD-largest fab in the world"
"At first i started investing in a stock market by myself, but I made much losses, before I met an expert that help me, so in my own perspective I feel seeking help an expert in handling our trade is the best option. Crypto currencies are gradually moving towards something big and the crash or raise of price over the pass few months is just the start of greater things to come. Many are ignorant of when to buy and whether it isn't too late to buy an asset, when you're holding it could be when trading, it's never too late to buy. An investor with a good strategy earn big regardless of market price ( bulls or bears).I have a successful trade using signal from expert Mrs Jasmine M Frankie trading signals, with her guidance & signal service, I've made over $25,000 in a couple of few weeks with the help of her platform.

"Woo today they sell l begin to buy. Hahaha... do you believe those who sell at today price is making money ?? They would have sold it months ago if there were profits.Come on, l am waiting to fill my 111 x 20."
"Can't believe there is a chip shortage and this thing has been range bound for the last 5 months, $110 to $120.....Look at the 6 month chart...whats the issue here..."
"This stock never surprises me. Are we talking about Potato Chips or Semi Conductor Chips! You hear all this talk chip shortage, demand is through the roof, TSM is the number one power house in chips, this company should be crowding $200.00 PSP but instead we are 10 smacks in the #$%$ away from $100.00 The market is screwy i know it takes time but when a company has stellar earnings, crazy demand for their product and has fallen from the mid 120s just weeks ago it is hard to keep throwing money and averaging down because the floor keeps falling deeper and deeper."
The car chips is only a minicuous % of TSM's sales. No reason to drop #$%$. Buy the dip for sure.
i've been in the semiconductor industry for 10 years. This company is a complete winner when it comes to flawless execution. Pity people don't even know about it. Apple is completely dependent on this company for now and AMD is too for the most part. Leggo!
"ONCE AGAIN MY FRIENDS  THE MAMMOTH HAS FALLEN. THIS TIME I’M IN AT $112.9. I SOLD AT $118.9 OVER 3 MONTHS AGO BECAUSE TSM KEPT FALLING. IN SPITE OF HAVING ALL THE CHIPS THEY CONTINUE TO FALL FROM THEIR LOFTY PERCH. SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY WRONG WITH OUR DRAGON...PERHAPS IT WAS OVERPRICED FOR ITS POTENTIAL GROWTH. HOWEVER, THE HEDGE FUNDS ARE NOT SO CONVINCED OF ITS INVINCIBILITY. I WANT TSM TO WIN BUT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT KEEPS GETTING IN THE WAY THAT SHOULD CAUSE INVESTORS TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. INSTEAD EVERY IS ALWAYS BLINDLY TOUTING HOW GREAT THIS SYOCK/COMPANY IS SO GREAT. YOU SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD. ADDRESS WHAT IS WRONG AND FIX IT!"
"TSM has returned to the price it was last Thursday, prior to the run up before earnings. The earnings beat anticipated was less than stellar. This will trade between 117 and 120 until next quarter when results should be really good. However, Semis and related industries are out of favor. Consumer staples is the way to go. See my post on the Humana board. October could see the mother of all sell offs in points, not percentage if inflation persists. Be on the look out for that. October has been notorious for sell offs."
All chip stocks down. Perhaps AAPL report will help. Supply issues.
"It's like a broken record that we have been hearing for the past 40+ years. This no brain propaganda song "" ccp took over Taiwan"".The facts include :a. ccp can't even make its so call 5th generation jet fighter engines which are applied by Russia. They can only make the body shell + some parts. And ccp have no more than 25 of these planes.b.ccp air defense system is S400 again it is supplied by Russia.c. What missiles ? Missiles need advanced chips to make precision guiding system. Without it, missiles are dangerous even landing on its own land. Aviod copy say this ccp bullocks propaganda which is meant to divert focus. The fact is that the Ally want to take on ccp if they don't pay for the astronomical damage covid-19 has done to world nations.Ccp days are numbered."
Does anyone know if they report before or after hours on the 15th?
"TSM is looking good and today says volumes, I think we are heading towards $120 in AUG and $132 in SEP."
"Good news from MU guys, good news for chip stocks! also check SAVA BA FAS BABA DQ RCL CVX,,,,,"
The powers that be refuse to let this stock break and hold $120. Its more then suspicious at this point
"Intel already taking more N3 capabilities than Apple, might replace Apple as the #1 client. Aiming at Nvda and amd. Rumor has it."

$TSM $VENA $C3.AI guess i'll buy some contracts :)
earnings report on the 10th i hope it looks good
Hedges are short squeezing TSMC & AMD. That?s why these two superb stocks aren?t bullish yet.Be patient & hold. Manipulative hedges want to #$%$ your shares for cheap price. Don?t let them.
"bullish, sold AMD at 93 and bought more TSM, glad I did!!!"
$140 coming soon
"I feel so sad invested in this, all my other options raised at least 10% and this one and only this one is -5%. I have a feeling that American compnaies have some privillage and Chinese or related Chinese compnaies are discreminated which is not fair."
Most all semis up nice today except TSM . Look at that 6 month chart . Horrible . Looks like the bearish arrow on this app . Check it out : compare the chart with bearish box
I'm sure most of you remember when the media started to discuss chip shortage. And the president of the US fully expressed his support of expansion in manufacturing. But do you remember the one specific company that he reached out to went out of his way to contact and discuss how to deal with the shortage.FYI It was this company.
"Shake it baby, hippy hippy shake.l have place buy orders $106 x20, 104 x 20, 102 x 20..... all the way down to $88. Of course l don't expect to see that level but just prepare for the unexpected.No worry friends, don't need a strong stomach to withstand this tiny bit of fluctuation unless you are a day trader.Concentrate on the big picture. Take an extreme example to illustrate the point, if you believe the make is gonna collapse 10,000 points then does matter how good the stocks would go down with the market. Oppositely if the market is gonna rise by 10,000 points. Even rubbish stocks would rise often by a greater amount due to its speculative nature. Nothing wrong with Tsm, just give the big boys a bit of times to accumulate. They are smart they know what they are doing.Good luck to all."
Bought some more of this. Been holding since March at a loss.
Fraud fraud fraud
"Quick, come on bear boys put all your money on it double down sell short. Next week see 110 again."
good luck all
I really don’t know what will. You have to be clueless to not understand what’s about to happen.$VENA $TSM

Buy TSM now
"All comes down to knowledgeable investors being afraid of ccp takeover. I don't think the world realizes how dangerous it is for freedom if China takes over Taiwan. All these other countries and companies Can invest big money into building new chip factories but, I don't think everyone understands that they still won't be able to produce the type of high end smart chips that TSM could produce for many years. Money crubers can't stop taking ccp money. A non ccp TSM is a big key to a free future. All this concern is what's keeping TSM down. If some agreement can ever be reached for the world especially the ccp to leave Taiwan alone. TSM stock would shoot up faster than a ballistic missile."
$TSM $VENA I’ve watched so much Dateline that I can never get married.
What could happen to TSM if China invaded Taiwan?
"Those scaremongers 40+ years propaganda ccp took over Tai Wan is like telling you don't go out cars would knock you down or live in hospital after 50 years old you would suffer heart attack anytime. Only no brainers would copy say this. They don't even know that the tune now has changed to ""Tai Wan is gonna take over China."" Lol."
Why is everything down so much after-hours?
"Starting a position today, this is going to to be a huge monopoly in time. Barrier to entry to compete is extremely high, the second largest chipset maker is even giving 20% of its business to TSM."
"The stock market is no longer an avenue of valuations, fundamentals current conditions or future outlook. It has turned into a legalized gambling casino. Companies with enormous valuations, profitable future upside trade in the red when other companies example (AMC, NEGG, GME) continue to bounce around 10* 10- everyday. Algorithms and Gamblers day trading have caused the stock market into a total Joke. The MM Hedge funds constantly manipulating buying selling day in and out. SEC Turns their head to anything they do. Phantom shares appear that do not even exist but are still be traded. Most of these hedges do not even hold a stock 24hrs. It has become so hard to buy great companies and see their price plunge due to gamblers with big bucks moving the market up and down like a yoyo every hour the market is open. TSM Should be trading today after last earnings announcement AROUND 135.00 if not higher. Take a look at the price now $115.82 as i type. What a disgrace WALL STREET HAS BECOME! Think i will put it all on Black and let it ride. i might end up making some money rather than loose it. Just my opinion but the Market has become a total joke!"
"the bottom was over, we can see it go back to $125 this week."
Buy the dip. Back to $118!!
CCP scared of TSM without TSM their tech giants will only go down and so with the CCP
IT MOST LIKELY WILL SINK TO UNDER $100 BEFORE IT CAN BE STABILIZE FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENT....IT'S ABSOLUTELY GOOD TIME TO SELL FOR BEST PROFITS EVER....
"Just order a case of beer and enjoying myself till this makes sense to me. All sectors are raising including Apple, AMD etc. And they are all using tsm lol"

"So earnings are up 11%, yay... so the stock drops > 5-6%? WTH??? What logic would you need to use to understand this precipitous drop? Lots of stocks are red today, but < 1% as a rule... Investing seems to get more and more unpredictable, I swear!!"

Wonderful opportunity to invest TSM now
"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) Raised to ""Buy"" at Zacks Investment Research Price Target $135.00"
may see $122 this week or next week guys! TSM will dominate chip sector soon!
Wonderful wonderful opportunity
"The semis are a toxic sector, massive fight about peak or multi year growth cycle. It's ugly. But TSM has no business down here. It is possibly the most important company in the world. Two words: China overhang. This stock is treated as a China stock. It will never get back to 142 until the China threat narrative ends, and then it will take another six months after that for investors to trust stocks in this region again. People want nothing to do with China stocks."
"111 l mean. No worry folks, it's just the market. Nothing wrong withTsm."
good result but still stock drops hard. why?
"TSMC should be about $180-200 now. A company making more than 50% chips, 94% of high end chips , that is, affecting 50% of human economic activities, only worth $650B?"
"Even Intel announced outsourcing to TSMC, I feel sorry for weak hands, TSMC will get the whole market in 2022."
"I was expecting an earnings beat... considering how much potential and opportunities they have, this is really disappointing, and revenue just met..."
Bullish to $155 in 3 month.
"great drop for strong hands to accumulate more shares, the drop in the stock price was due to smaller gross profit 50 vs 51 percent, big deal it is very smart of tsm not to overcharge for chips making it too expensive for the end customer to buy the products, instead they are making more and more sales making them me only real chip gaint"

"TSM is sitting at its first level of resistance for the day after testing the third wall. It's correction from it's lows recently is great, the company has a lot coming it's way in the long run if it can deal with the current supply shortage and over exceed expectations next quarter. Long term this bad boy is going to hit those ranges of 140 again. But currently as it stands, it's going to float in this weird limbo for a bit. It's dangerously high, and support levels sit at around 116.30, 112, and 107, so buy up more when it drops in the next week and let's keep the momentum rolling and when all the crazy relaxes around this virus prepare for lift, this company has a lot of amazing things coming it's way."

"Pump it up .Write this is a moneymaker and then take a look at the YTD chart . Horrible . Keep writing how this is a no brainer and watch the Share Price drop. Write why you can’t understand why TSM isn’t moving up The Largest fab . The smallest nano ‘s the fastest most powerful and energy efficient . How it’s so far ahead of the competition . How so many companies depend on TSM . How it has orders far in advance . How it’s revenue and earnings are growing at a rapid rate . How it’s stock price keeps dropping . You just can’t understand it . Blame it on shorts , manipulation , geo political issues . It’s so logical that this stock should be higher. But it’s not . Like most everybody thinks the same . Clones and market brains . So boring and predictable . Vanilla , plain , regular , just plugging along . I’m out ..... ps thumb this down and give a bad rap , I wrote “so predictable “ , “so boring”.

What happens to TSM corporate if the Chinese /CCP seize Taiwan. The imperial tiger is planning the next steps in their global expansion.....this move may be the trigger that brings on the big correction...a black swan moment is coming. 20% swing down in portfolios. Here comes the rain again.
wen is the er date???
"What gives with this so called BEST OF THE BEST company? its got the best of everything, bright future, best brains but while the market has gone up, TSM has dropped by almost 1/3 in the past year.......Something is wrong on every level and no one can explain or attempt to explain the underpinnings of this company.......why no dividend to speak of when the company is so profitable as well.......At this point, i am even on the stock but i didn't invest to simply watch the stock go up, get great reviews and then plunge without a stop for the past year.....i don't think its political either since china may try to re take the island but not want to risk a worldwide confrontation.....Hong Kong is a different baby as was macao......Something is wrong with the leadership in this company plain and simple......Shortages have become magnified and instead of increasing in profit, the stock has plunged, slowly day after day.......There is really no way to get into this mal adventure......"
TSM future is uncertainty! Stock price?
have to wait for about 5 days for the 60day moving average to go up
I think TSM is better than AMD as of now. They both great companies

Biden: 40-50% EV by 2030 (9years). English translation: TSM is printing money best money tree ever!
"TSM is undervalued here, been consolidating since March, and is due for a breakout. It's the most advanced semiconductor company that all the big boys utilize ($NVDA, $AMD, $QCOM, $APPL, $AVGO, ARM, $INTC) and have all given very positive future outlooks. It is rapidly growing and expanding it's operations in an attempt to try and meet extreme demand. It's unrivaled 3nm process is fully booked for the next two years and production on the 2nm process is set to begin in 2023. The chip shortage has greatly contributed to a super cycle with semiconductors. The global expansion will ensure massive semiconductor growth for years and technologies like 5G, IoT, AI, and EV only reemphasizes their long term importance. Semiconductor equipment manufacturers like $ASML, $AMAT, $KLAC, and $UCTT all stand to greatly benefit from this global growth and expansion by all semiconductor manufacturers like TSM."
Japan's softbank is dumping TSM to cover lost from China's investment.
"TSMC (TWSE: 2330, NYSE: TSM) today announced its net revenue for June 2021: On a consolidated basis, revenue for June 2021 was approximately NT$148.47 billion, an increase of 32.1 percent from May 2021 and an increase of 22.8 percent from June 2020. Revenue for January through June 2021 totaled NT$734.56 billion, an increase of 18.2 percent compared to the same period in 2020."
LETS GOOOOO
This is a bargain sale…covid lesson one was “need more chips”!!! Dont forget that.
"I wonder who is selling this stock, unbelievable... very strong company, wide moat, market demand of its products on fire, decent price... this is a strong buy on my book."
This thing has been consolidating for far too long
The world cannot without TSMC.
The same thing happened with nvda. I held it forever. Went nowhere. As soon as I sold flat it took off. Where is that gd 150?
"Chinese foundries cancelled ALL taiwanese orders out of blue!China first, ccp ordered all capacity goes to Chinese design houses.order log is as long as the great wall, lolbacklog situation will last at until 2024 assuming EV/internet of things/wfh chip demands will stay the same lol (not possible, demand will only get stronger!), samsung semi revenue/profits on steroid thanks to the chip demand same as tsmc. we are in a new era people are still figuring out, virus/chips/new energy/orbital tourism/Mars,....cheers"
What if China takes Taiwan?
"I increased my position today. Been averaging down so far this year, though still up overall as I first got in last year. Last 5 year chart is phenomenal. If $TSM is investing in new capacity, means there's room to run here instead of piling into industrials"
"China Mobile's announced winners of a procurement contract for 320,000 5G module units, with Qualcomm, UNISOC, and MediaTek the biggest beneficiaries, Taiwan media report, adding that all three have their modem chips made by TSMC. $TSM $QCOM"
"apple wants tsm to make more iphone chips, so apple stock goes up, tsm stock goes down."

looks like it will fly
Wow still a lot of bears on this board. I like it :)
"Investors, What do you think will happen to TSM if the CCP invades Taiwan?"
"bought 30 shares at 118.3 in the hope of growth when all MA lines were below, but something went wrong and now the share price broke through all MA lines very easily and the price dropped again, now below all MA lines and continues to decline. If you look at the graph, you can clearly see that such movements have been going on for half a year, sadly, I thought it was a great company, I was wrong."
Where is the gd management
Who bought the big put options on the stock?
Who the hell is dumping TSM?
"Danny, Tam, and George are the same persons, I believe. Gonna mute all three."
3-mos target is $122 and 6-mos is $132! That is good for me since I own 5K shares!
Option related dip? Any chance of Taiwan invasion and CCP takes over TSM?
Thinking on moving my whole position to crypto and be done with this :/
"Ha Ha! Those who short TSM are in big.. big.. trouble now, $200 is coming soon!"
$WIMI $AMD $TSM I trust in god they will come up soon
"CNET: Apple, Intel will be first to adopt TSMC's 3-nanometer chip tech, report says."
let's go break that 120 and beyond
BUY BUY BUY
anyone have EPS data?
Hedges are shorting TSM. They are so manipulative.Do not sell & buy more if you can. TSMC is the leading semiconductor company
$TSM is 3x as profitable as $AAPL $GOOG $FB etc yet with a market cap half the size of these companies. How is this justified? Either $TSM is undervalued or these big techs overvalued
$VENA $TSM $AMD strong  hand and more patient holder.
"NEW N7 plant planned in southern Taiwan. Demand can be tight into 2023, every last bit capacity booked. Sociologists will come up some explanations for this tsunami wave of digitization."
"TSM is the biggest semi manufcaturing company, the others are not even clsoe to it. Future will need chips everywhere, EV, IoT, future is digital world. Open your eyes!!"
I would say TSM is cheap even at 130.
"Hate to trade this horse, but the numbers no longer make sense at this multiple after the stock split. I think i'll take my profits and move it over to more sensible valuations, like $AMD $SWKS $TSM"
"should b at least $150 stock if this is an aAmerican company, our life style would go backward at least 2-3 years without ASMC, its the world’s leading dedicated semiconductor foundry ever. Intel needs a couple years to catch up, not even Samsung. The next Microsoft. Im all in."
The latest price increase will be a big deal! TSMC’s Chip Price Increase Might Let It Beat Intel Believe Analysts.https://wccftech.com/tsmcs-chip-price-increase-might-let-it-beat-intel-believe-analysts/
Simple... its overvalue.. current earnings is not equate to current share price. maybe be the best chip producer.. BUTTT its too expensive of a business.. Buying at $80. patiently waiting
love watching know-nothing shorties getting squeezed. LOL kept scaring about 'Chinese invasion' and don't have a clue about the technology of TSMC
"No, it is only at the foot of the mountain. My stock brokers would wake me when my sell orders are filled at $300. Back to sleep."
wow I am buying today! Cant believe TSM is not seen as a leader in the eyes of the market
buy tsm as soon as possible . we can see $130 very soon.
"I think this latest drawdown in price is due to people lumping TSM into the same basket as China stocks. INTC, SOXX, and chip stocks are not down this much. Heck, market's are not even down that much today."
"Remember Indiana Jones movie, there are those hundred years old warriors who have been there for just one job "" to protect the golden grail."""
"Yep..That said Dow may see another 1,500 drop tomorrow. Friends be alert and maintain holding power. Nothing to do with the Tsm, just the market in general."
Got some TSM and relative cheap with 30:1 P/E ratio and it is Cutting the only high end chip Maker.
The risk of TSM is what it’s future! Move to US or stay In Taiwan?
Totally manipulated
"@Jupiter it is not true. The risk is managing manufacturing all around the world. Currently , it is very effective at the central model where all manufacturing/research is done in Taiwan. It has all the talents stand by 24/7 but when it moves out partially to other location such as German and USA , the resource and talents will be hard to control and hire and cost will go up accordingly. But I still see it as good challenge for it to go globally to avoid uncertainty such as china’s conflict"
More fabs in the US will future proof $TSM. Stellar team groomed for decades by the founder. Foundry in China makes 14nm for autos. Not going to challenge the US aim to dominate in the most cutting edge fab via $TSM expansion in the US
$WIMI $QCOM $TSM Loading the boat on any weakness..! Watching this high conviction play daily
"This my biggest mistake so far. I put all my money at 235. I do not know what to do now and I have been trying to be patient but it is very hard. I lost confident in this stock. I do not care how good this company is and I know you can call it the most important company in the palnt etc but if the stock is performing the way it has been since March then is not good company for investor. I am not resercher or scientist etc. I care if the stock is doing when.. I do not care what you produce or sell. So mentally tired. I knew the new top target is 220. My gut feeling, it wont pass that no matter how many years I need to wait.. so mentally tired I can not even finish this without feeling the sharp pain and depression that this stock caused me. Not fair."
Technical breakdown happening. If no bounce from here then the bottom falls out!
Are hedge funds finally done holding this thing down and going to let it grow?
Been trading in and out a dozen times in last 5 months taking profits on every trade .
"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has received final approval to build its most advanced chip plant yet, a day after U.S. rival Intel said it planned to seize chip industry leadership.TSMC plans to build a 2-nanometer chip facility in Hsinchu, one of Taiwan's most important chipmaking centers.https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Taiwan-gives-TSMC-green-light-for-most-advanced-chip-plant"
What would be an optimistic estimate for the price per share in 2 years?
Looking good boys
Sell or buy follow your own feeling folks. No need to figure out why. Stock market is the last place to look for logics.
US GOVT wants Taiwan's help with chip shortage but USA hedge monger funds keep shorting it. So why should the Taiwan GOVT help when this is happening!!
"Business or Politics?Taiwan media reported that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Ltd. and United Microelectronics, Taiwan, are expanding the production capacity of 28nm manufacturing equipment without obtaining a supply license. If a US manufacturer in Taiwan transfers US equipment to a factory in the mainland, it will also need to obtain permission from the US?"
Time to buy TSM is now because TSM will raise pricing of their products by 20%.
"Probably due to china usa conflict.. no more $80 PT. Will stay away till conflict subside.. what if one day china take over TSM? Feeling stressed out on baba tencent etc. China gov doesnt care about capitalist, they care for general citizen. They can afford to disturb the big giants and bring more equality for their citizens.."
Obligatory closing bell sell off 
Up from now!
I don't think the China connection can be anything but a liability in the future
Sold all! Lost a lot! but I am happier now. This is going nowhere. It is not USA company so the stock will not do well. I better go and invest in other usa companies and I already start see my stocks in green. I bought this loser at 135. The last 2 Qs were amazing but the stock keep going down.. I can not keep up with this none sense. F anyone who stole my money (some of you) but I will get them back from other normal stocks.
Got my 20 at 110. Next 100
They make more than 50% high end chips. none US countries load up in Jan cause of Tax. I would load and hold till next year. No point selling this at this point. This is good puppy!!
"Somehow, Taiwanese government and citizens are less concerned about the war with China than people on this board. Also, a new foreign $3,5 billion investment is going ahead in Taipei. Taiwan isn't HK and Xi knows that very well. 700 Taiwanese long range missiles can bring hell deep inside China."
Huge short squeeze coming
One of the most important companies in the world 
TSM JKS BA DQ are way oversold - IMO
"Better sell now, delisting soon like all other ADR. Regardless of financial profits."
Meditek will release 4 nm 5G core Q4 2021!
"Slowly, patiently and unitedly we dry up the supply, no need to buy a lot each just get as many friends in to buy $10,000 or a little more having a 5 years view together we are gonna to earn pay for a sizeable deposits for our house. God bless."
TSM might drop past $100 for over optimism in the industry. There will be a company maximum output for chip shortage and thus even with 11% increase in revenue does not quantify the share price now. Be patient and let it come to you. Whole market is about to jump due to opec meeting and inflation.
$AMD $TSM $VENA The only thing we do know is that there's a 99% chance the market will be higher in 3 years.
$TSM $CLOV $WIMI These prices is the same as finding money
can't believe this is under 120 let alone 110
I am currently at 117. Should l add more to average it out? What is happening? What the drop all of the sudden?
"$110 level has been tested 3 times, we are going to $130 and beyond"
"I have most of my holdings in AMD, TSM, MU. With AMDs recent run up, been taking profits from some call options to buy long term TSM shares. its just a matter of time before this one gets going again, but havent had luck w options in TSM as of late so sticking w long term."
"Finally decide to dip my toe into semi at current daily low. Good luck to us. Split my fund into 2. if it goes down, I will avg down. If it goes up, I have money to buy something else. :)"
Not touching chip business for a while . It is a long and patience investment
"more chip they make, and more money they make ===> lower stock price."
$AMD $VENA $TSM It must be a non-sale item
"Future: Artifical Inteligence, Machine Learning, Eleectrical Vehicule, All will be impelented in Hardware and not software anymore. All the universitiess in the world work with TSMC. all the small size and average size companeis in the world activie in AI and ML making their chips with TSMC. Future is there, It can easily get few hundreds (above 300) in two, three years ..."
gros margins weak plus currency flucuations had a negative effect
I sucked it up last week and took a big loss on my BABA holding. The facts have changed dramatically since I invested in it. It was an investment and is now a gamble. I reallocated a significant portion of the holding to TSM.
Maybe it was an automatic sell-off because the upper limit of the weekly bolger band was reached.
Glad to see this growing over $120. No reason not to see this stock back to $140 with all the growth...
"""TSMC has revised upward its revenue growth outlook this year to above 20%, as the foundry segment and the overall semiconductor market (excluding memory) are expected to increase 17% and 20%, respectively."""
China is burning up the house. Stay away.
$VENA $TSM $FSR Hold and you will be rewarded.
"As stocks go up and down, buy at the dips with TSMC and with the pricing power it has, the existence of the chip shortage, supplier of AAPL, QCOM, among others, now is the “buy point” and some patience is appropriate. If still unsure, do your research as I did.Good luck, guys!"
EPS beats by $0.02
TSM has officially stayed about $120 for an entire trading period (fri 12pm - today 12pm)we did it!
Based on its latest e/r it's not good to hold as if it was good but while sink after its e/r....? it left a big concern without any explanation...
By this week $140
"$TSM $MU $WIMI What's coming is still coming,gogogo"
Taiwan foundries to see revenue hit another record in 3Q21https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20210720PD216.html
It’s bs guess who is going to fill that worldwide shortage tsm
I believe tsmc is a great company with many contracts with companies like Apple and a great long term investment also. Bought at 72 and I am still going to hold !
TSM is the reason China dare not to touch Taiwan at this moment
@Safeinvesting what is the metric for best. If you are talking about stock performance than Nvidia is the best semiconductor company.
Great post at 4:30 by Louis Navellier on TSMSee ya at 150
"Two type of people kept mention China invading Taiwan:#1 Short investors#2 Idiots10 years from now, these same types of people will still bring up China invading Taiwan!!"
buy Tsm right away .
Total gdmfg
Daily and weekly charts both on 'Sell' signals. Psychological support at 100. Technical support in the 75 to 85 range. Hedge/trade accordingly.
TSM hit triple bottom last 6 months which is the right time to buy - Look at 6-month chart!
TSM to build up to 6 plants in Arizona. .....
check out SELB and ALTO insiders buying
This is the best semiconductor company which owns the majority of market leave alone the quality of their chips. Look at the market. This doesn’t make any cents.
ccp through their servile wall street financial crooks trade this stock want everybody to sell so that they gain control of this strategically important company. See it now.
"Strategy is Tsm should occupy no more than 20% of your money. Bought it then forget it. With hundred thousands of investors holding $10,000/$20,000 each having a 5 years view we dry up the supply of this stock. Price will go sky high."
"Is anyone worried about the political risk? Look at recent statements among Japan, AM., and China."
"I can't wait for the day to get out of this stock...it might be a great company but for a stock,no...For the last six month this stock just toggles between $108 and $120, over and over again...I got in mid $130s because there is a chip shortage...been a major loss since.."
Urges sec investigation of trading here stock being manipulated
"Chips are in high demand, this is a $140 stock....just a matter of time to climb back where it was."
"l wish Dow droppedd 3,000 points today. How wonderful l am ready to buy 40 % of my money. Hahaha ... and cha cha cha........"
$VENA $GOOG $TSM Best Buy opportunity the market
there is an inverse relationship between revenue and stock price
"Why is tsmc P/E so low, being one of the best companies in chip industry?"
"Hooray for TSM - finally moving upward. I am surprised. Technical indicators all bearish, but it did have an interesting triple bottom."
Everyone is begging TSM for 3nm 
i think intel is trying to book as much N3 so amd/nvda and now qcom can't have access. qcom is also eyeing to make aapl M2 competitors too lol.
Add like there’s no tomorrow today market settles so nothing fundamentally changed we are trading under of 9 this is the time to add.
I guess that semi conductor chip problem is not a problem after all...
Congrats for Long
"it'll take others 2-3 years to catch up with TSM technology, Japan, Germany will follow US (Arizona) to collab with TSM for obvious reasons. Arizona has started recruiting to secure some top notch candidates for the facilities."
TSM planning to reduce China risk by moving some production to Phoenix. Very positive news!
"BUYERS AND SELLERS, LEND ME YOUR EARS. YOU CAN’T SPECULATE OR CALCULATE ON WHAT YOU DON’T HAVE. THIS CHIP SHORTAGE COULD LAST A DECADE. MY SECOND PURCHASE WAS AS $108....THAT BRINGS MY START PRICE DOWN TO $110 FROM $112.9. MY NEXT DIP PURCHASE WONT OCCUR UNLESS IT HITS $99. "
"Apple and Intel are reportedly first in line to use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s next-generation 3-nanometer production technology. Both companies are testing chip designs using TSMC's 3nm fabrication process and could begin producing chips in the second half of next year, according to a report Friday from Nikkei Asia, citing unnamed sources."

"Infineon: the earliest chance to catch up w order is by the end of 2022. English translation: TSM is printing money, best money tree. Impact on tsm stock price: none. it's manipulated by the evil communist..But overall tsm is doing good and outlook can't be any better."
$120 is key level here. GL
Short shares have declined the past 6 weeks over 7%
Next few quarters will be excellent and that why big boys are now in TSM. Check SAVA if you like!
Could be heavy sell off tomorrow ?
"CONTRARY TO THE SCHILL AT MORGAN STANLEY, THIS VIEW SEE'S HIGHER PRICING AND TSM'S DOMINANCE TO CONTINUE!!!TSMC’s chip dominance is expected to continue as it plans $100B expansionThe bigger picture: While several chip manufacturers are building chip factories in the US, the scale of investment pales beside TSMC’s planned expansion, which will cost $100 billion over the next three years. TSMC’s investment is a quarter of the entire industry’s capital spending per VLSI Research. Investments matching or surpassing TSMC’s planned expansion are needed to create a more diversified microchip fab industry.The global chip shortage is starting to push up prices of items like laptops, displays, and printers and could make smartphones and cars even more expensive. PC manufacturers like Asus and HP have already started to raise prices by as much as 8%, while printer prices have gone up by 20%, per StockXpo. Pricing is also going up for new vehicles, even as carmakers are producing fewer units because of the chip shortage.https://www.emarketer.com/content/tsmc-s-chip-dominance-expected-continue-plans-100b-expansion"
"Good news for TSMC regarding more COVID 19 outbreak:'TAIPEI, June 20 (Reuters) - Taiwan reacted with an outpouring of thanks to the United States for shipping 2.5 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to the major semiconductor-producing island, more than doubling its arsenal as it deals with a rise in domestic infections.'Hopefully, this stock will rise back to the 130 soon."
"AMD set to become TSM's 2nd largest customer behind APPL. AMD alone expected to contribute 10% to TSM's revenue, likely more post Xilinx acquisition."
Lot of trolls on the TSM board. It didn’t used to be like that. Mostly useless rants. Mute button in overdrive.
"It's a roller coaster, hold on for future gains or get off if you a chicken"
Not too worried about this current downtrend just waiting for the semiconductor shortage to subside in mid 2022 then we will see stocks like $NVDA and $TSM go to all time highs
time for the TSM stay over $120 for more than a day challenge
"Tsm is a ""manufacturing stock"", l repeat, ""manufacturing stock"" like Boeing.l shall explain more at appropriate time. Actually it is common sense.Investment vs share speculation is another thing. Remember don't use ""speculative mentality = quick money, to invest"". Want quick money go buy speculative stocks. Don't get this basic logic wrong."
Is it only me or eveybody else has the same feeling for this stock? It goest up very slow and cannot hold even 1% growth. What is seriusoly wrong with this? For such a successful company this is so wierd.
"Triple bottom here at 108 over the last few months. Neckline appears to be around 125, would like to see it breakthrough that on the next move up."
I'm glad I can buy it cheaply today. Please build a factory in Japan as soon as possible.

"Just take a step back and take a look at what is going on....fabless companies $NVDA $AMD and now $QCOM all reporting incredible ER's with tremendous growth WITH very positive guidance going forward. Semi manufactures like $TSM $TXN all reporting beats with significant growth and constantly guiding upwards with positive outlooks going forward. Other manufacturers like $QRVO and $SWKS will likely reports similar strong ER's this week. Semi equipment companies like $ASML (destroyed earnings) $LRCX $AMAT are and will likely continue reporting even more significant earnings and growth due to unprecedented demand. The semiconductor industry is looking outstanding right now and has an even brighter future. ER's are reflecting this nicely. I'm severely bullish on this industry right now and many of the stocks, particularly semi equipment stocks are looking like value plays ($AMAT and $LRCX especially undervalued)."

"Apple's M1 chip is being produced by TSM and has taken Apple's products to the next level, such as the Ipad Pro, Mac books, Mac Mini and newly refreshed Imac.
