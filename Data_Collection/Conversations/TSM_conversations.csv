I would say TSM is cheap even at 130.
"Future: Artifical Inteligence, Machine Learning, Eleectrical Vehicule, All will be impelented in Hardware and not software anymore. All the universitiess in the world work with TSMC. all the small size and average size companeis in the world activie in AI and ML making their chips with TSMC. Future is there, It can easily get few hundreds (above 300) in two, three years ..."
TSM JKS BA DQ are way oversold - IMO
may see $122 this week or next week guys! TSM will dominate chip sector soon!
The latest price increase will be a big deal! TSMC’s Chip Price Increase Might Let It Beat Intel Believe Analysts.https://wccftech.com/tsmcs-chip-price-increase-might-let-it-beat-intel-believe-analysts/
Next few quarters will be excellent and that why big boys are now in TSM. Check SAVA if you like!
"111 l mean. No worry folks, it's just the market. Nothing wrong withTsm."
TSM DQ and JKS are oversold and undervalued guys!
"Lesson learned - luck is essential when you invest into a good company . After I sold . This stock raises , what the heck"
"TSM is undervalued here, been consolidating since March, and is due for a breakout. It's the most advanced semiconductor company that all the big boys utilize ($NVDA, $AMD, $QCOM, $APPL, $AVGO, ARM, $INTC) and have all given very positive future outlooks. It is rapidly growing and expanding it's operations in an attempt to try and meet extreme demand. It's unrivaled 3nm process is fully booked for the next two years and production on the 2nm process is set to begin in 2023. The chip shortage has greatly contributed to a super cycle with semiconductors. The global expansion will ensure massive semiconductor growth for years and technologies like 5G, IoT, AI, and EV only reemphasizes their long term importance. Semiconductor equipment manufacturers like $ASML, $AMAT, $KLAC, and $UCTT all stand to greatly benefit from this global growth and expansion by all semiconductor manufacturers like TSM."
"$110 level has been tested 3 times, we are going to $130 and beyond"
Congrats for Long
$120 is key level here. GL
I sucked it up last week and took a big loss on my BABA holding. The facts have changed dramatically since I invested in it. It was an investment and is now a gamble. I reallocated a significant portion of the holding to TSM.
Back to 130s soon
If this breaks $120 this week I will literally drink water 
love watching know-nothing shorties getting squeezed. LOL kept scaring about 'Chinese invasion' and don't have a clue about the technology of TSMC
Up from now!
"Apple's M1 chip is being produced by TSM and has taken Apple's products to the next level, such as the Ipad Pro, Mac books, Mac Mini and newly refreshed Imac. Now this upcoming Fall with Apple to introduce the M1X chip and possibly next year introduce the new Imac Pro, TSM is looking to really put it into the next gear. Earnings for the next few quarters look really bullish based on the M1 Chip and its predecessors to come."
"Danny, Tam, and George are the same persons, I believe. Gonna mute all three."
I think the pain is just about over for TSMC. Good long consolidation time to strap in.
"TSM is the biggest semi manufcaturing company, the others are not even clsoe to it. Future will need chips everywhere, EV, IoT, future is digital world. Open your eyes!!"
NVIDIA Next Generation Ada Lovelace GPUs Will Use TSMC’s 5nm Process Instead Of Samsung’s.https://wccftech.com/nvidia-next-generation-ada-lovelace-gpus-will-use-tsmcs-5nm-process-instead-of-samsungs/
back to 140
"I purchased last week 200 for 114.64 believing that it was a great chance to buy on dip for a shot term speculation. Well, now gonna hold till the cows come home.However, it appears that the we've already reached the lowest price because it had cost 108 only twice since January.Your thoughts?"
"This $150 Million Machine Keeping Moore’s Law Alive ASSMLintroduced the first extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines for mass production in 2017, after decades spent mastering the technique. The machines perform a crucial role in the chipmaking ecosystem, and they have been used in the manufacture of the latest, most advanced chips, including those in new iPhones as well as computers used for artificial intelligence. The company’s next EUV system, a part of which is being built in Wilton, Connecticut, will use a new trick to minimize the wavelength of light it uses—shrinking the size of features on the resulting chips and boosting their performance—more than ever before.The current generation of EUV machines are already, to put it bluntly, kind of bonkers. Each one is roughly the size of a bus and costs $150 million. It contains 100,000 parts and 2 kilometers of cabling. Shipping the components requires 40 freight containers, three cargo planes, and 20 trucks. Only a few companies can afford the machines, and most of them go to the world’s big three leading-edge chipmakers: the world’s leading foundry, Taiwan-based TSMC, as well as Samsung, in South Korea, and Intel.https://www.wired.com/story/asml-extreme-ultraviolet-lithography-chips-moores-law/"
"As stocks go up and down, buy at the dips with TSMC and with the pricing power it has, the existence of the chip shortage, supplier of AAPL, QCOM, among others, now is the “buy point” and some patience is appropriate. If still unsure, do your research as I did.Good luck, guys!"
"I told you guys, I feel sorry for weak hands, TSM is the future, Nobody can repalce them are make them down,We will see 140 or even higher in Septmeber."
"Pump it up .Write this is a moneymaker and then take a look at the YTD chart . Horrible . Keep writing how this is a no brainer and watch the Share Price drop. Write why you can’t understand why TSM isn’t moving up The Largest fab . The smallest nano ‘s the fastest most powerful and energy efficient . How it’s so far ahead of the competition . How so many companies depend on TSM . How it has orders far in advance . How it’s revenue and earnings are growing at a rapid rate . How it’s stock price keeps dropping . You just can’t understand it . Blame it on shorts , manipulation , geo political issues . It’s so logical that this stock should be higher. But it’s not . Like most everybody thinks the same . Clones and market brains . So boring and predictable . Vanilla , plain , regular , just plugging along . I’m out ..... ps thumb this down and give a bad rap , I wrote “so predictable “ , “so boring”. Please be critical ; don’t disappoint . I don’t read them anyway / boring /predictable ."
"China Mobile's announced winners of a procurement contract for 320,000 5G module units, with Qualcomm, UNISOC, and MediaTek the biggest beneficiaries, Taiwan media report, adding that all three have their modem chips made by TSMC. $TSM $QCOM"
"Intel is the world’s largest semiconductor company. Its main business is PC processor and server chip business. These two businesses gave them a leading position for more than 30 years. The Foundry manufacturing has also been a leader for a long time, but now all of this has been broken. $AMD $TSM $INTC"
TSM planning to reduce China risk by moving some production to Phoenix. Very positive news!
"I can't wait for the day to get out of this stock...it might be a great company but for a stock,no...For the last six month this stock just toggles between $108 and $120, over and over again...I got in mid $130s because there is a chip shortage...been a major loss since.."
Sell or buy follow your own feeling folks. No need to figure out why. Stock market is the last place to look for logics.
Why is this stock flat during a chip shortage?
This is the best semiconductor company which owns the majority of market leave alone the quality of their chips. Look at the market. This doesn’t make any cents.
TSM Jan 21 2022 115 Call will be very profitable! IMO
"Ha Ha! Those who short TSM are in big.. big.. trouble now, $200 is coming soon!"
Wow still a lot of bears on this board. I like it :)
"Even Intel announced outsourcing to TSMC, I feel sorry for weak hands, TSMC will get the whole market in 2022."
