Right time for this company to over-perform as the US economy recovers?
SNA is very overpriced. SCX should reject any takeover bid.
Finally bought today after the $10 drop.
Dropping fast now
"Steady as she goes, chugging along with a small dividend. I am staying in."
"Both technical and fundamental are looking good, according stoxline and stockFA. http://www.stoxline.com/stock_chart/SNA.gif"
Snap-on is up 4.99% to 159.20
good ER?
Is it to late to get in with this company?
Think will get a nice climb tomorrow morning
"Nice pop this morning, should climb higher, shorts will be covering"
About time for a stock split wouldn't you say?
"Trump is supporting Oil, Gas, and Mining so this should help the tool business."
Safe dividend and quality balance sheet. Will benefit from when Main Street catches up to Wall Street.
SNA has been going the wrong direction lately. What’s up?
"I'm curious if anyone who is buying SNA (or the analysts who cover this stock) has actually spoken to one of their 4,600 franchisees to understand what is happening on their routes?"
"This stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4 (sell). However, I, a normal investor rate this stock as a buy. Tomorrow SNA (today closed at 153.56) will report earning and beat estimate."
"Bought some at $152 this morning, looking for $157 close"
"Snap-on is one of those hidden gems. Tool boxes and hand tools are a small percentage of what offer. They are huge in diagnostic equipment covering everything form passenger cars to tractor trailers. They offer tools that professions need and the average person doesn’t even know about. You don’t think of Snap-on as a company that also offers software and hardware to run a shop. Did you know that they are also a bank, yes they finance everything they sell which combined with also manufacturing their own products means huge profits. Dig into this company and you will invest. Don’t forget about the dividends."
Great earnings and another stock getting punished for doing there job!
