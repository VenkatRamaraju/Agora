SNA is very overpriced. SCX should reject any takeover bid.
"My local rep in NY just came in my shop with no mask or gloves on, as we all have been on lock down for 1 month. We are a no contact repair facility mandated by the state. I said are you kidding me, you travel to every repair shop in 3 counties , your like a super spreader and he looked at me with a dumb look on his face? This company needs to be proactive with their employees and independent vendors."

"Snap-on is one of those hidden gems. Tool boxes and hand tools are a small percentage of what offer. They are huge in diagnostic equipment covering everything form passenger cars to tractor trailers. They offer tools that professions need and the average person doesn’t even know about. You don’t think of Snap-on as a company that also offers software and hardware to run a shop. Did you know that they are also a bank, yes they finance everything they sell which combined with also manufacturing their own products means huge profits. Dig into this company and you will invest. Don’t forget about the dividends."
