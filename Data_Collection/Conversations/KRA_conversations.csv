Earnings do not look good. Time to exit.
Excellent day to buy KRA. I just doubled my position. Their recent acquisition into pine-based products has greatly increased their total cash flow.
"KRA is an incredibly strong company with huge growth prospects and their products are diverse, sustainable, and best-in-class. KRA is hugely undervalued at this price and they have an insanely low PE Ratio of 2. Their Earnings Per Share is a whopping $7.69 per share.Compare KRA's numbers to huge blue-chip companies like Google, who has a PE ratio of almost 29 and EPS of $49.57, Apple has a PE ratio of 27.48 and EPS of $12.73, and Amazon has a PE ratio of 128 and EPS of 20.94.Check out the KRA website, www.kraton.com, look at their array of product offerings and decide for yourselves.Stock PE Ratio(TTM) EPS(TTM)AAPL 27.48 $12.73GOOG. 28.88 $49.57 AMZN. 127.77 $20.94KRA. 2.08 $7.69KRA is a tremendous buy and hold stock for many years to come!"

"Given recent hiccups in COVID vaccine development I think the government has to look into Plan B, which is exactly BIAXAM is for. Imagine in hospital walls, desks, doors are coated with BIAXAM, cruise ship rooms, airplane seats, workplace desks, etc., uses BIAXAM for long term deactivation of the virus what it can do for the economy?"

"I started following ""awesomestokcalerts"" (Gooogle it - off course without any space or dash in between the words) and their notifications are better than anyone else."
"Well I would say the issue with this stock is the debt. According to Yahoo data, over the trailing twelve months, KRA spent $76 million on interest, which comes out to about 4% of revenues (76/1700). 4% of revenues is a pretty heavy interest burden, especially when Wall Street values the business at .3x sales (Yahoo, 2/3/20). Also, according to Yahoo data, only a touch of long term debt was paid down over the last year, with the number steady at roughly $1.4 billion, a number which is about 2.5 times the current market cap of $531 million as of 2/3/20."
Looks like it is heading to the low $20's. Stopped me out.
Kraton is up 11.04% to 28.73
"Several years ago, KRA was a best investing idea of a hedge fund manager at the Sohn conference in New York, televised in part by CNBC.. The stock price then was in the high $20. The guy said the stock was undervalued, should rise to mid $60 in a year or so, then to the $90.'s."
Insanely undervalued

"KRA has such an incredibly strong balance sheet and I challenge anyone on this board to find any company with as impressive PE ratio and EPS as KRA has, KRA is a tremendous buy and hold for many, many years to come!"
"Reiterating that 94% of Kraton stock is institutionally which makes it incredibly stable in these volatile markets. Always do your own research but KRA has immense upside from here and very little downside risk, and look at KRA's PE Ratio and Earning Per Share. KRA is a long-term buy and hold for many years to come!"

The China virus has played havoc with all chemical companies. Kra's 50/200 day moving average is $22.17/$25.68; with forward PE of 6.8x's. This selling is just typical panic with a small cap stock. I bought today and expect my investment to hit a price target of at least $25 before FYE
