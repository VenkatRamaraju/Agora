"Several years ago, KRA was a best investing idea of a hedge fund manager at the Sohn conference in New York, televised in part by CNBC.. The stock price then was in the high $20. The guy said the stock was undervalued, should rise to mid $60 in a year or so, then to the $90.'s."
Where the hell is everyone? Am I going to have to enjoy these gains all by myself?

"Well I would say the issue with this stock is the debt. According to Yahoo data, over the trailing twelve months, KRA spent $76 million on interest, which comes out to about 4% of revenues (76/1700). 4% of revenues is a pretty heavy interest burden, especially when Wall Street values the business at .3x sales (Yahoo, 2/3/20). Also, according to Yahoo data, only a touch of long term debt was paid down over the last year, with the number steady at roughly $1.4 billion, a number which is about 2.5 times the current market cap of $531 million as of 2/3/20."

"Reiterating that 94% of Kraton stock is institutionally which makes it incredibly stable in these volatile markets. Always do your own research but KRA has immense upside from here and very little downside risk, and look at KRA's PE Ratio and Earning Per Share. KRA is a long-term buy and hold for many years to come!"
