"Reiterating that 94% of Kraton stock is institutionally which makes it incredibly stable in these volatile markets. Always do your own research but KRA has immense upside from here and very little downside risk, and look at KRA's PE Ratio and Earning Per Share. KRA is a long-term buy and hold for many years to come!"
Kraton's Biaxam could be a home run.
"Several years ago, KRA was a best investing idea of a hedge fund manager at the Sohn conference in New York, televised in part by CNBC.. The stock price then was in the high $20. The guy said the stock was undervalued, should rise to mid $60 in a year or so, then to the $90.'s."
"KRA is an incredibly strong company with huge growth prospects and their products are diverse, sustainable, and best-in-class. KRA is hugely undervalued at this price and they have an insanely low PE Ratio of 2. Their Earnings Per Share is a whopping $7.69 per share.Compare KRA's numbers to huge blue-chip companies like Google, who has a PE ratio of almost 29 and EPS of $49.57, Apple has a PE ratio of 27.48 and EPS of $12.73, and Amazon has a PE ratio of 128 and EPS of 20.94.Check out the KRA website, www.kraton.com, look at their array of product offerings and decide for yourselves.Stock PE Ratio(TTM) EPS(TTM)AAPL 27.48 $12.73GOOG. 28.88 $49.57 AMZN. 127.77 $20.94KRA. 2.08 $7.69KRA is a tremendous buy and hold stock for many years to come!"
"KRA has such an incredibly strong balance sheet and I challenge anyone on this board to find any company with as impressive PE ratio and EPS as KRA has, KRA is a tremendous buy and hold for many, many years to come!"
"KRA is such a solid company with 94% Institutional Ownership and only 3% short interest, and a $19 price target and 52 week high of $35/share in September 2019. This stock has a very good chance to double from here in the next 3 to 6 months with very little downside risk. Buy and hold KRA if you would like to make some real money with minimal risk."
"Company put itself for sale over one month ago. Who, when and price??"
"Boy this company has been silent. Can roll a bowling ball down the halls and not hit an IR, CEO or CFO. Need some leadership here before someone searches the couch cushions for enough change to buy this company."
The China virus has played havoc with all chemical companies. Kra's 50/200 day moving average is $22.17/$25.68; with forward PE of 6.8x's. This selling is just typical panic with a small cap stock. I bought today and expect my investment to hit a price target of at least $25 before FYE
What's going on with the recent spike in KRA? Any insight on the FDA approval of BIAXAM?
Congrats!
"Glad I came across this stock. Best kind to buy/keep in uncertain times. Good product, solid fundamentals, upward potential, and above all, profitable."
"Im just starting to learn stock analysis.after seeing how good the fundamentals were,I figured the pandemic must be the reason why the stock had gone down but looking at historical data I see its been going down from 2016 drastically .Can anyone tell me why that is?What happened at that point and why it hasnt gotten back to anywhere near that price?After seeeing how exceellent the basic metrics were Im puzzled as to whats going on?also noticed that Yahoo gives the bearish call on it>"
"94% of Kraton's outstanding shares are owned by institutions, and they only have 3% short interest, making KRA a tremendous investment with huge upside, especially in this turbulent market."
I played this one...playing TROX as well. TROX will be next.

"Given recent hiccups in COVID vaccine development I think the government has to look into Plan B, which is exactly BIAXAM is for. Imagine in hospital walls, desks, doors are coated with BIAXAM, cruise ship rooms, airplane seats, workplace desks, etc., uses BIAXAM for long term deactivation of the virus what it can do for the economy?"
Earnings knocked it out of the park. Up big today and now AH.
Great news today for potential covid approval
Wow- pretty quiet here on that news. I'll take $52.
