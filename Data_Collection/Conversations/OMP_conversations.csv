"I bought another 400 shares this morning @ $24.75. Set up on DRIP. Sold SBUX and bought this along with positions in HESM, XOM, SBR and MO. Raised the divvy on that money from $950 to $3900 per year."
"Just like last month when someone bought over 250,000 shares just before the market closed, today someone bought over 157,000 shares, again just at the close. We have some strong accumulation going on by those who know a lot more than I do."
Well holy cow. I just realized that I bought 400 shares of OMP a couple weeks ago when my FA and I sold Starbucks. So I have 560 shares. This will bring me an additional 287.2 shares of CEQP. l can dig it.
"I loved holding this profitable cash cow. We all knew it was undervalued, at first glance, this was not the buyout/merger I was hoping for though. Guess I’ll move on."
"CEQP earnings history looks #$%$ compared to OMP. On top of that, OMP looked to have upside back to $35 based on its recent peak. CEQP's peak doesn't have as much upside.I don't know about this deal. Looks good for CEQP but not so good for OMP. The distribution looks much less safe with CEQP's recent loss history.What do you all think? Is the distribution safe?"
OMP currently pays .56 per Q in distributionsat .87 per share the equivalent CEQP dividend would be .54375 (.625 x .87)Thus .56 less .54375 = .0163.So we are essentially decreasing the OMP dividend by .0163 per unit per Q or .0652 annually.
"The next two weeks are very big for all of us. Tons of earnings coming up. Congratulations for all those who continued to buy over the past three years. You are about to be strongly rewarded from just about any of these companies I’ve posted below. Dividends, share buybacks, insane cash flows are just to name a few. Let’s make some money folks! It’s our time and there’s a nice energy supply crunch planned from the Sleepy Joe admin to push the green! I’m all for it! Keep your stick on the ice we about to make some dough! $BTE $OXY $CPE $RIG $OIH $SU $XOM $CVX $EOG $CNQ $LPI $CLR $CDEV $CPG $ATH $CNQ $USO $VET $PBA $MUR $PVL $KRP $BCEI $ERF $TPL $CPK $OMP $EGY"
New SEC filing for OMP: two new 15-year contracts now in place.https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=101533&ref=116182866&type=HTML&formType=8-K&dateFiled=2021-10-08&cik=0001652133&CK=1652133&symbol=0001652133&companyName=Oasis+Midstream+Partners
can this get any worse?
"Please help me to understand, let's say I have 1000shares of OMP, so I will get additional 870 shares of CEQP? Or it will exchangeable?"
i am only up 4% on OMP in 3 months. Waiting....
Today's action in OMP seems as though OMP is wanting to breakout and run.Looks real good going into earnings. If we get a boost to the dividend we will be off to the races.
"Reminder, OAS and QEP Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of FANG, will complete their transaction, which began in April of 2021, by Oct. 27, 2021. OAS is purchasing all of QEP's Williston Basin assets."
"Dividend News buried in the merger release.Oasis Midstream Partners LP (NASDAQ: OMP) (""OMP"" or the ""Partnership"") today announced that, on October 24, 2021, the Board of Directors of OMP GP LLC (the ""General Partner"") declared the quarterly cash distribution for the third quarter of 2021 of $0.56 per unit, payable on November 29, 2021 to unitholders of record as of November 15, 2021."
"every share OMP we buy now and until the merge will get converted to .87 shares of CEQP ( at the announced share price)?So at the current OMP price, you still gain by buying OMP shares I think?"
So just to confirm so I understand We are keeping the OMP shares we own and are getting an additional .87 shares of CEQP……Or am I wrong?Not sure if I understand completely Thanks guys!
