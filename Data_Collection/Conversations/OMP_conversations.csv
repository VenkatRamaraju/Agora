"Oasis Midstream Partners LP Announces Year Ended December 31, 2020 Earnings and Declares Fourth Quarter Distribution of $0.54/unit"
OMP up $1.76
"Any idea when is the ex-dividend date? no mention about that, or at least I couldn't find it"
The proceeds from the offering are being used to redeem from Oasis Petroleum Inc. a number of common units equal to the number of common units sold by the partnership in the offering. The partnership won't receive any proceeds from the sale of the common units in this offering and the number of common units outstanding immediately following the offering will remain unchanged.
This could be a buy once price visits tgd breakdown December pivot low candle... buyers will step in short term at least
30 yr treasuries at 2.0%. CDs at 2.2%. $OMP at 12% with growth potential. Distribution coverage 1.6+.Let the market decide.
"ugh no assurance can be provided in that regard.The Partnership expects total revenues will increase approximately $12.8 million to approximately $106.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 from the same period in 2019; impairment expense will increase to approximately $101.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 from the same period in 2019; and total operating expenses, including the impairment expense, will increase approximately $100.2 million to approximately $145.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 from the same period in 2019. The anticipated changes, and specifically the substantial increase in impairment expense and total operating expenses as compared to the modest increase in total revenues during this period, were primarily attributable to the significant decline in the future demand for the services that the Partnership provides caused by the collapse in demand for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids beginning in March 2020 as a result of Saudi Arabia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ actions as well as the ongoing impact of stay at home orders issued in response to the novel coronavirus 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic. The results presented"
"There seems to be some confusion regarding ex-dividend dates and how they work. Today is August 12, 2020. According to the SEC, here's an explanation of ex-dividend dates:The ex-dividend date for stocks is usually set one business day before the record date. If you purchase a stock on its ex-dividend date or after, you will not receive the next dividend payment. Instead, the seller gets the dividend. If you purchase before the ex-dividend date, you get the dividend. According to OMP's news release regarding the dividend payment:Oasis Midstream Partners LP will begin trading ex-dividend on August 13, 2020. A cash dividend payment of $0.54 per share is scheduled to be paid on August 27, 2020. Shareholders who purchased OMP prior to the ex-dividend date are eligible for the cash dividend payment."

"In the stock game, you really have to come to your own conclusions. If you have checked out the balance sheet, last several earnings quarters and such you have less to worry about. If you buy or sell because other people are buying and selling or because an investment bank gives an opinion, you are really skating on thin ice."
Very Solid earnings call given the circumstances in the oil market. Dividend is still onFeeling very optimistic about the future of this stock.
Moody's lol
Remember that as of July 9th OMP will be added to the MLPX (Cushing 30 MLP Index)This along with great earnings should move the stock.
12.63% divi !!! This is a load up day before ex divi date kinda play evidently
Will this company survive? How is it doing right now
Dividend payable June 8th
Blow-out quarter. So now what?
"In the big picture, TMF was  3%. That indicates positivity for stock."
"I bought my initial shares at $3.05. wanted to mortgage the house and buy 25,000 shares at 4. wife shot that down."
"Oasis Petroleum has sufficient liquidity and continues to operate its business in the normal course. Oasis Midstream Partners (NASDAQ: OMP), an independent legal entity operated as a Master Limited Partnership, is not included as part of the discussions related to a financial restructuring and remains independently well-capitalized."
I'm not following how they computed the IDRs last quarter. The payment was 491. ((0.4688-0.4313)*15% + (.49-0.4688)*25%) )* (20045196+13750000) = 369.21 What am I missing?
this board deletes almost every time i post very american.
Perhaps I’m missing something but I’m surprised there is no affirmation on this board that today is ex date for a previously declared $4 dividend payable 7/21.
this co is making me realize i don't belong in the stock market i believe it's manipulated for the owners.
This share price is not running up for a lousy $0.54 cent dividend payout before the ex date of 3/8/21 it makes no sense for the stock to jump 4X the dividend payment amount. The stock price always goes down right after the ex date a bit below the payout amount. Smart people don't try to buy the dividend payment in advance just before the ex date.
I’m in as of yesterday @ $11.45. Giddyup

"GOD BLESS DONALD TRUMP. There is talk that he wants a 4,000 tax credit for travel expenses in the next stimulus bill. This will greatly help this stock and all oil stocks in my opinion. A travel tax bonus to everyone in the USA that has been stuck indoors...FANTASTIC IDEA. I believe this will push up both oil prices and oil stocks. Vote Republican and let’s get this bill in place.GLTA"
"Several items here. First you have to recognize that there are no Oasis Petroleum shareholders - there is the creditor's committee, bands and the old management serving them. The larger question is what are they intent on doing - other than getting out of Chapter 11.* They want a lower cost structure and OMP is now a major cost to them, that needs to be reduced. That puts OMP's business - income stream and in turn their dividends at risk. C11 affords them the opportunity through the courts to force a renegotiation of the contract(s). That, if it occurs directly affects both OMP's income and the net worth.* If the ""parent"" is able to force a renegotiation of the contract(s), OMP's dividend is shrunk/eliminated and its share price is (possibly substantially) reduced. As others have observed here, right now you can purchase ""$960M in equipment and machinery (tangible stuff) is only valued at $237M."" - and after any contract renegotiation, the ""parent"" (after C11) can take a run at reacquiring OMP for [you choose a value - $100M???], thereby capturing OMP's $900M assets at a fraction of their value. That is moving OMP's shareholder value to the creditor's committee - at the expense of the OMP's shareholders.* OMP by virtue of their largest customer's C11 is essentially no longer in charge of its own destiny. It's all up to the banks and how bad do they want to screw OMP's shareholders (you). You have to understand that OMP was only created to provide the parent (Oasis Petroleum) with benefits - so the banks are viewing reacquiring OMP as getting back their own property..... just my opinion."
"Company holds 69% of all the common units so that leaves about 7 million units on the market to trade, no brainer back to 30s soon."
are midstream companies paid a fixed rate or are their fees adjusted according to the market price of the product flowing through their pipes?
What caused JPM downgrade to underweight? it seems to have hit the pps.
Is this dividend real? Are the really paying it right now?
Is this an emerging oil giant? or that the masses are chasing the price ?
Boys and girls: “how about them apples!!”
Why isn’t OAS going up and OMP is exploding.. Anyone mind explaining why they do not correlate?
will back to 30+ sooner than you can imagine
Over 250000 shares crossed right at the end of market hours today. Someone put in a 5 million dollar bet on OMP. Hope they know something.
8k just came out the shares were prices at 24.60 !
"They just reported. Things are going well, facilities near completion, etc. I'm buying more."
Is the dividend suspended??
Drops 13% in 5 days!! Not good...
Where the dividend at?
Well troops we have earnings today after close....Best of luck to all.
There's that 3.3% divi...for just the quarter! Love it. Going to hold onto this for a long time.
Crude at $46? Hope it bottoms out soon enough!!!!

This could be the next GameSpot or AMC ... REALLY
Am I wrong ? was this stock suppose to pay special Dividend of $4.00 per share yesterday ?
Does anyone on the board still own this share. Have recently bought a full position as a two year hold. Looks like a sound growth share.
When they will announce dividends?
"I added some more today. Not sure if its the right thing to do, but I love that div.There is so much more drilling to be done in the Bakken. With the new wells coming on line, there is lots of gas coming with it. I am a long term holder."
Dead money for a couple of weeks. Just sit back and collect the divy.
"Warren Buffet said it best, ""When others are fearful, be greedy."" Which is why I bought more shares on the huge dip that was created at the end of the week."
Trying to figure out the market is like trying to figure out women. Forget it. OMP kills OAS statistically but throw logic out the window.
Kenneth: please explain your reaction to the news. Thanks.
I found this stock over 2 yrs ago. What a home run!! It’s a super growth n excellent value 7.5 % play. Best of my holdings along with CLR
is there a chance for this co. getting back to it's high?
Went up nice today and looking forward to the dividend next month.
Great run today...Now announce the dividend and conference call.
"A SA article refers to a ""looming litigation"" affecting $OMP. Thus, the author recommends avoiding the stock.What is the ""looming litigation""? What is the status?Can someone supply a source reference?Otherwise, love the distribution yield and coverage."
Up .36 today. Why?
Anyone buying on today’s dip?
Are you sure OAS owns almost 80% of OMP? I thought it was less.....
"Earnings report after the bell on the 24th, conference call on the 25th. No mention of a dividend in this press release. If they don't declare a dividend on the 25th, share price will be back to single digits on the 26th. If you're in this for dividend income, have your exit strategy ready..."
"Its too early to buy OMP now, I own a little but I'm not getting more now even though it would lower my basis. I think it will still go lower over the next few days, plus I'm concerned as many companies do that they will use this as an excuse to reset the distribution. I'd rather have the facts before buying blindly."
what happened to the .6425?
"While I like the financial fundamentals of of OMP, I have some grave concerns putting a lid on my position.While it’s usually a good sign seeing shares held by insiders, it’s concerning to see 47%. That’s way out there - especially with such a small float. One major insider shareholder opts out, for whatever reason, they may all cash out.Have to face it, OMP is ripe for manipulation. Has to be concerning."
I hope I can buy again at 20
"Oil is up, but why not this stock, Can someone tell me please?"
It says in the financial report on OMP website the stock is currently worth $18
I'm in at $16.25. Oil disruption + price history + dividend = see you at $22 soon.
"this stock won't go up with a good earnings report,what can i expect if there is a little weakness in the next report?"
In the past they declared the dividend payout the day before the earnings call. So the 24th is my guess.
"The public offering is equivalent to share buyback, no dilution. It would have been nice if they announced the price of the offering, maybe would have kept the OMP price from tanking!"
I hope our next dividend is secured 
With the Bankruptcy this stock is high high risk
Why is this dropping like a rock?
"OMP's addition to the Cushing index may explain some of today's gain. In any case, great news."
Beautiful News....Beautiful Company....Best Managed MLP in the space.
(OASPW) warrants share $35 soon35 in 1 month
the large share holders are in total control of the share price.
I’m going out on a limb and stating I believe OMP declares a quarterly distribution of .6425 this week. Simply my calculated opinion.
"Normally a 2, 5, 8, 11 month payer. are they now going to 3, 6, 9, 12?"
OMP is the envy of the midstream MLP world. Excellent Management!!!
Total gain 169.7%.
Is there really 38% dividend?
"Look,the stock is down 48% over the last 52 weeks and down almost 30% since Dec 31,2019. Do you think the dividend is safe for May."
"This is down 7.00 in 2 days, WAY oversold here."

Should announce distribution today.
"Of note, the OAS restructuring plan has full agreement of Mirada which is the party that was in the lawsuit with OAS. I guess that removed the bit of uncertainty about OMP and is responsible for the impressive price recovery over the past month."
Having sold a bunch of OMP between 23 and 32 the past few months I see buying back in under 25 as nice bargain. $25 with a distribution of $2.20 gives me a nice safe 8.8% dividend on top of the possibility of going back up over 30. Oil is well over $70 and everything else has shot up so I'm parking some profits I've taken elsewhere back in OMP. If nothing else I'll qualify for a nice distribution in August.
The short story is shares sold by oas to public via omp.......look at it like insider selling. I think that explains to drop.
"Up over 8% in after hours buying spree. Let’s hope it holds…,"
Buy at $20.50 and sell at $23. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.

CFRA S&P Global Continues to rate OMP a “Strong Buy”.
A word from management might help.
I regret selling my shares at 5.50 when it dropped last week. Guess Ill just have to wait until this bounces back down to get back in. With jump like this I know there are plenty of day traders that will pull out at somepoint to give me a new entry point
picked up a bunch again. It made me really good money last month.
I believe what's keeping the price down is relationship with OAS - it happens all the time with MLPs just happened with EQM and ETRN - ETRN is acquiring EQM for benefit of both (ha ha) EQM shareholders get 2.44 shares of basically worthless ETRN and a 66% dividend cut. People are afraid same will happen to OMP with OAS.
I suspect the Cushing MLP Index is sorry they added OMP to their portfolio. I'm sorry I didn't get out at $35!
"I am buying back the shares I sold more than a month ago, missing most of the run up. Expect the price to go lower after that. As bad as my timing is, for once I will clear a little on the trade."
"Here is why OMP is down today...announced today that it has commenced an underwritten public offering of 3,623,188 common units representing limited partnership interests (""common units"").

All of the common units are being offered by the Partnership on a primary basis, the net proceeds of which (including any net proceeds from the underwriter's exercise of their option to purchase additional common units) are being used to redeem from Oasis Petroleum Inc.(OAS) a number of common units equal to the number of common units sold by the Partnership in the offering. The Partnership will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common units in this offering and the number of common units outstanding immediately following the offering will remain unchanged.Morgan Stanley is acting as the underwriter for the offering. The offering is being made pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement, which has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and became effective on October 26, 2018.

"Lawsuit, gist of the suit is as follows;Miranda and Oasis own oil properties that they bought from other companies. The original agreement binds the heirs, devisees, legal representative and successors of the parties to the original 1999 joint operations agreement (JOA). Miranda asserts that it is a successor to the company it bought from and as such the JOA is in force.. Oasis contends that Miranda only acquired the properties and not the company which functioned independently and as such is not a successor and as such is not bound by this agreement. Oasis also contends that Miranda is not a Heir (only people can be heirs), legal representative of a party to the original agreement. These are the entities bound by the original 1999 agreement. Oasis also contends that the properties do not have usage covenants as Miranda claims."

"If OMP is doing so well, why would OAS sell and pay a special dividend? Then they say this: ""Oasis will continue to evaluate strategies to increase visibility into its ownership in OMP and close the current sum of the parts discount imbedded in its stock price."" increase visibility by selling stake? closing stock price discount by paying out a dividend? paying out cash reduces OAS's equityNot a shorter btw, I am long.

"2Q 2019 Highlights:Declared the quarterly cash distribution of $0.49 per unit, an approximate 5% increase from 1Q 2019.Net income was $49.0 million and net cash from operating activities was $56.0 million.Delivered $61.9 million of Adjusted EBITDA(1) and $36.1 million of net Adjusted EBITDA to the Partnership(1).Generated $28.8 million of DCF(1), resulting in distribution coverage of 1.7x.Experienced operational downtime at the Wild Basin gas processing complex, which was fully restored beginning mid-July. Crude oil and natural gas volumes were adversely impacted by the downtime, resulting in lower than anticipated Adjusted EBITDA, DCF and distribution coverage. Adjusting for downtime, OMP would have realized distribution coverage of approximately 1.9x.Exceeded guidance related to water service volumes. Volumes increased 13% from 2Q 2018 to 52.4 MBowpd in Bobcat DevCo and 3% from 2Q 2018 to 143.7 MBowpd in Beartooth DevCo.Increased third-party natural gas volumes in Bighorn DevCo by approximately 94% from 1Q 2019 to 59.3 MMscfpd (30% of total natural gas volumes of 201.6 MMscfpd)."

All of you should go read the court case on your own and make up your own mind. If judgement awarded to Mirada, it will be a immediate deadly blow to OMP even if OAS by miracle survives."

"Letter from OMP Management to Shareholders and Customers""Dear Valued Oasis Petroleum and Oasis Midstream Partners Customer,We are reaching out with some news regarding Oasis Petroleum and its affiliate, Oasis MidstreamPartners (OMP).On September 30, 2020, Oasis Petroleum announced that it has entered into a restructuring supportagreement (RSA) with substantially all of the Company’s lenders and an ad hoc committee ofnoteholders on a comprehensive “pre-packaged” restructuring plan to significantly reduce its debt andstrengthen its balance sheet. To implement the plan, Oasis Petroleum voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 inthe United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. After a thorough review, OasisPetroleum determined that implementing a restructuring plan through a controlled, court-supervisedrestructuring is the right path forward.Oasis Petroleum considered several restructuring alternatives and ultimately chose what it believes isthe best path forward – and one that means its upstream operations and production are expected tocontinue as normal. Oasis Petroleum has sufficient liquidity to run its business, intends to work with itscustomers as usual, and expects to complete this process on an accelerated timeframe allowing for anemergence in November 2020, subject to Court approval.OMP operates as a Master Limited Partnership, independent of Oasis Petroleum. Importantly, OMP andall subsidiaries in which it owns an equity interest are NOT included in the Chapter 11 proceedings.That means that Oasis Midstream Partners will continue to operate in the ordinary course withoutoversight from the Court.OMP’s financial position remains strong, and OMP remains committed to prioritizing the safety of itsemployees and communities. In fact, OMP was set up so that it would not cross-default in the event of arestructuring event at Oasis Petroleum.We want you to know that, as a customer of both Oasis Petroleum as well as OMP, you should expect nodisruption in how we serve you. Throughout the financial restructuring process, Oasis Petroleum andOMP intend to continue working with their customers as usual, operating its wells and providing oil andgas as always. Both companies will continue to be guided by what is best for their respectivestakeholders, including valued customers.Below is a link to FAQs that will address some questions you may have.

Doubled down. The div and upside is too much to ignore at this point. Oil is down 20% in a month..something will happen to push that back up towards 60 soon IMO.

It’s good day
"Time to buy. Great margins, dividend, and growth opportunities. This will be 12 by end of July."
1.11 earnings vs .975 estimate.....
Hopefully all of the selling is over and we begin a major move up.
The risk is Parent buying out OMP with a 3 - 5% premium. It happens all the time when dividend get unrealistic. Where can you get a guaranteed 20% return with OMP current dividend yield.
I bought some at $21.06. I'm building a divvy cash cow and this looks like a great one.
I loaded up on more today. Couldn't say no to a 26% discount.
Where else could you find 46.1% of outstanding shares held by insiders?Only .59% of outstanding shares are short.Those are extremely good ratios folks. U always want management incentive tied to shareholders performance
According to OMP's August 2020 Investor Presentation: http://oasismidstream.investorroom.com/events-presentations 3rd Party earnings account for about 20% of total earnings and near term goal is 50%. Should OAS go bankrupt it is likely that whomever ends up with the assets that use OMP services will need to continue using OMP services in order to make money with those assets. There might be a temporary interruption during the reorganization but the receiver of OAS assets will very likely want to produce with those assets to make money and that will involve continuing the OMP contacts for services. I think OMP is strong enough and well capitalized enough to weather any temporary disruption due to OAS bankruptcy/reorg. It makes little sense to argue that they'll go broke just because OAS declares bankruptcy and reorganizes. There will be an impact but not one likely to be fatal to OMP.
"Well boys and girls, what are ya’ll thinking?"
Don't like this!!--Last year OMP released both Q4 preliminary results and declared its dividend on January 30th. This year no preliminary results and no dividend declaration as of February 11. what goes?
I was a buyer a few months ago at $9.5 range. Does anyone know what’s been driving this run lately??

Does someone know what drove the stock up in july ?
Back up to the 30s
This stock will double to $14 easily in no time 
"Took >50% loss...couldn't stomach it anymore. I originally bought as a long term play last year and have cost averaged down. However, the delayed earnings is a big red flag for me...and potentially OAS going down would cause this to go up in smoke as well. Seems to be too heavily linked to shale, which won't be profitable for some time. Good luck, ya'll."
"The rise in price today could have been oil prices rising all day nearing $70, highest since 2018!"

All storms eventually pass and the buildings with a solid foundation still stand
Dividend should be safe with all the major holders making a bundle. release date is delayed by parent co. calling the shots. They just emerged nov. 19. hence the push back on earnings release date.
I hope you guys didn't listened to that hedgefund short seller HW Graff last week. Good Riddance! You would have missed out on this amazing rally.
"I'm no expert, but by looking at the charts for the last few months, the current price of $23.57 doesn't seem like such a good deal. Also, looking at the one month chart, something seems kind of crooked with this one. I'm going to stay away."

"Oil Prices going up, US opening up and oil production cuts, this stock is looking more and more attractive, NOT to forget the 0.54 cent divi coming up. if they can keep it for the rest of the year this will explode specially with the low O/S the company has."
"y'all, I just a thinking this buy through.I have about 11% in cash and the idea of pouring some cash down a hole in Texas, well...its got me excited.I'm retired and mostly suffer from Senior Boredom. Riding a Horse is one thing, getting on it another.I heard swimming is good exercise for us elderly folks, so should I or should I not dive into the OPM pool?"
"Hi Dark Shadow, the issue is not the dividend risking being cut. In fact, they have been continually raising it repeatedly and they have a 2x DCF coverage and a forecast of 1.7x this year. Their earnings reports have been blowing the doors off. I have been considering writing a larger, more in depth, article on this on my website. Let me know if this would interest you, but the risks are:1) Lawsuit - It's hard to impact what the result will be. The parent will indemnify as much as they can, but the worst case scenario is that there could be a black swan ruling that forces OMP out of their own facilities. Unlikely, sure, but that's the risk. I haven't had time to personally review the lawsuit materials, but then again I'm not a lawyer so its hard to say what the final impact will be.2) Regardless of how many take or pay contracts they have, if the counter party goes under those contracts are useless, therefore, midstream pipelines respond to Oil and Nat Gas prices even though in theory they shouldn't. Oil is down a lot lately, therefore MLPs are down a lot lately. 3) IDR situation. If these are converted to common or class B shares, it will be dilutive to existing holders. Most of the time it seems that the sponsor, who controls the MLP through a majority holding gives themselves a great deal at the expense of limited partners. They really have no incentive not to. This probably won't cut the dividend but it could limit future growth of it. At 16%, probably not a big concern for most buying at these levels. 4) The sponsor could do a take over at unfavorable terms since the stock is really depressed right now. They only spun it out back in 2017, but if the deal is accretive for them they will do it. The sponsor isn't actually in great shape right now, so this might be a less likely scenario, but I'm sure they could find an investment bank to sponsor the deal. 5) Takeover at unfavorable terms by a larger MLP. There was the report a month ago that OAS was shopping it for sale. They've be leaving a lot of money on the table if they did that. Not sure if that would be in their best interest. But they could get desperate to sell off some assets. 5) Sponsor goes bankrupt. What happens then? I am not sure much would happen here. OAS bondholders become equity holders. Likely the oil and gas keeps flowing, maybe at a reduced rate. Don't forget that about 30% of their gas processing complex comes from third parties. A small piece of the revenue, yes, but OAS assets could be taken over by a various collection of entities and have a bunch of independent customers in a similar vein. I appreciate any other comments."
"Does anyone have an idea of what’s pushed and is keeping this down? I can’t find a reason this isn’t increasing. Earnings, divi, outlook, all good. Anyone??"
were aup a buck wow.
"Well, we all now know why the shares were selling off yesterday. The insiders were privy to the secondary announcement today. You and I are left holding the bag.Doubtful the PPS will recover anytime soon and the P/E ratio will be ridiculously high. As OMP will now be on the dime to cover distributions for new shares, the distributions will inevitably be cut.Will await a couple point recovery and exit"

People can buy in today to get the high dividends this company is paying out... Why is it going down?
Why the pre-market drop so much today?
"Not that it means anything, I did add a couple hundred more today. I do have minerals in the Bakken. So, I do try keep up on what is going on. I really like what the management is doing. I do have shares in Oais and will be adding more OMP as income permits."

"OMP having a good day.The beta on this equity is vey high at 2.76. By comparison AAPL is 1.25 meaning OMP SP is more than twice as volatile. Of coarse OMP is a small cap stock with a small float.

"First of all, don't read this until I'm done buying. Nothing happened here, except that OMP assisted a large holder, the parent, in liquidating its stake to the public. Very transparent. Thanks, sellers, for folding their cards into my lap for nothing. I'm happy you're taking your gains, and paying tax on them. Our Treasury needs the money."
The weekly decline was just shy of 32%......way overdone.
"Oasis Midstream Partners EPS beats by $0.22, beats on revenue"
OAS just completed their restructuring package. Why is it down 8% post?
"Where is the bottom for this stock? A few months ago I bought in the low 20s and it zoomed up into the 30s, where I sold out. Thought I had a great entry point when it dropped to 24 so I loaded up again.Since then, nothing but underwater. Oh well, I can live with it because of the great payouts."
OMP is up 4.94% to 18.90

"Looking great, longs! Nice month so far...This really does have a great chance of hitting $20+ by dividend date."

Anyone with 3 average here?
Both HESM and CEQP had great earning today...should bode well for OMP
34.49 1 week ago !
And oh BTW announce this bankruptcy #$%$ by the parent company and then the stock price doubles. Something smells.
"JP Morgan ""Downgrade"". This guy downgraded OMP and increased his price target. It's Monday before coffee, so I am just trying to get my head around this one. JPMorgan analyst Jeremy Tonet downgraded Oasis Midstream Partners to Neutral while raising his price target for the shares to $25 from $22. The analyst cites valuation for the downgrade following the recent outperformance of the shares."
"Fact is, the dividend is over 6%. And it doesn't sound like this is a dilution anyway. And it's not significant compared to the market cap either. So, I'm buying more."
"Let me start with this, this is NOT Wallstreetbets! I am an average person who is super long on OMP, with just under 49k shares. I will also say thank you to everyone this past Friday who sold their shares and drove the price down as it created an unparalleled buying opportunity, similar to when OAS filed for BK late last year. Last weeks events post-market close Thursday and pre-market and market open Friday, were an overreaction and/or folks just not understanding English. The two key highlights from OMP's post-market press release Thursday are contained in the first paragraph, as follows: ""The Partnership will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common units in this offering and the number of common units outstanding immediately following the offering will remain unchanged."" Translation, OMP is not attempting to raise money, OAS is, and second, there is no share dilution as the number of outstanding common units will remain unchanged. So, what's the issue!? There isn't one! The financials are sound and just with the bounce back post OAS BK, this will bounce back as well and continue marching higher and higher as OMP is wholly undervalued, period.Here are my other thoughts and considerations:First, to all of you who sold high and immediately bought back in or are thinking of immediately buying back in, I would familiarize one's self with the IRS Wash Rule (Publication 550). You might want to know this regardless if you are buying/selling via a traditional brokerage account or your IRA. There is also the issue of capital gains tax: short term/long term, so make sure you know what side of the fence you fall on. There are three things certain in life: change, death, and TAXES.Second, as far as I can see, and you can check NASDAQ yourself, I see no recent insider sales with OMP, only purchases.Third, look at institutional ownership for OMP. New positions out pace sold positions by a wide margin. And, institutional ownership is an excellent metric when gauging sentiment towards a company. Fourth, even with OAS redeeming what will probably be 4.1M shares, they still own over 33M shares: again, you can check NASDAQ yourself.Fifth, if you go back to late last year, starting when OAS filed for BK, OMP has had several instances of hitting highs before gapping down and climbing again higher and higher. For instance, when the pandemic started, when OAS filed for BK, and at least three other times. This is what stocks do. Patience is key and there is no need for immediate gratification/satisfaction. If you bought high and sold because the shares gapped down and spooked you, you made a conscious decision to be a bag holder as it is not a loss until you sell. Sixth, Warren Buffet said it best, ""When others are fearful, be greedy."" Which is why I bought more shares on the huge dip that was created at the end of the week. OMP is solid and will be for a long time and its GP (OAS) is a pure play in the Williston Basin that just increased is acreage to almost 500K acres.I close with this, fortune favors the bold."
Time to sell at $23 and then wait for it to fall. Take the money and run and live to invest another day.
I picked up shares today... We'll see where it goes from here.
is something up? forward dividends are not showing??
A good day for OMP. And it’s good to see.
what happened?
Sold 1000 shares at 32.00 got in at 15.38. Now will wait til it goes down to 20 and get back in! yeah baby!
I only want honest opinion to comment I just bought this stock this morning the dividend yield is very attractive does anyone know how long they have been paying dividends what's the chances of them quit paying dividends and what's the risk associated with this stock?
"Added a bit more here, again. Nice position, for sure."
"given the earnings, and the payment of the distribution I thought we would have been more more. There was a big block of 125,000 shares for sale at the open which is surprising. Guess it has to do with options unwinding tomorrow."
"Reminder, OAS and QEP Energy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of FANG, will complete their transaction, which began in April of 2021, by Oct. 27, 2021. OAS is purchasing all of QEP's Williston Basin assets."
