"Low floater AMS Adjusted Q2 earnings of .03/share vs a loss last year. And check out the balance sheet. Now sitting on $1.45/share in CASH, with tangible book value over $4. This low floater is way too cheap in the $2's"
There are people that automatically short stocks that have large pops but to short a stock with such a low float and lots of insider buying is a very dangerous move!There are lots of reasons why insiders sell shares but only one reason they buy.
"Another insider buy of 10,000 shares filed an hour ago:Brian Roney, Pres. bought yesterdayAlso Jamison Williams, Director bot 10,000 shares on 12/17"
Comedy is tragedy plus time.
This has to go up at least 4+ today
What's the news for CNFR?
Conifer Holdings (NASDAQ:CNFR) reported quarterly earnings of $0.06 per share which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $(0.03) by 300 percent. This is a 133.33 percent increase over losses of $(0.18) per share from the same period last year.
Hopefully this year this stock will be above 5+ soon and its all about covering insurance and things so this is useful
"It's awfully quiet on this board. Earnings for 2020 coming out next Tuesday after the close.I'm expecting either blow-out earnings or some major announcement...insiders didn't buy 25,000 shares in December for nothing!Good luck to anyone still here, this thinly traded stock can move big on good news."
"I buy when insiders buy:12/16 President bought 10K shares in the open market12/29 Director bought 10k shares in the open market12/29 Director bought 5k shares in the open marketNo one has sold any shares...when insiders are bullish, so am I"
Wth is going on here.. they need to put out a PR like yesterday .. even cannabis fluff is fine to gain awareness here.. lots of potential but a dead stock
They had some interesting insights about CNFR on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.

Insider buying
She’s almost ready
"They have a good product, just sucks they will not line up with some good growing agencies that write good profitable business so they could get to +++ cash flow faster. I am one of those agents that would and could write a LOT of business with them, but they don't seem to be interested. Lets see if this post gets to someone with the company that is interested...."
"OK, the company is losing money and is expected to continue to do so. Why are insiders buying?"
Hopefully tomorrow it will open at 8+

Do not sell ..low float of just 5m shares .came in benzinga alert. Once volume crosses 5M we will have fun
"It's great to see that Conifer Holdings insiders own 41% of the company, worth about US$9.1m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders."
im new to trading and im trying to figure out stocks and their catalyst but i can't seem to find one on this spike. What am i missing?
"Needs to stay above 2,89 to confirm the uptrend"
