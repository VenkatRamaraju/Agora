"Edu company races to the bottom:$METX = $0.5$YQ = $1$QTT = $1$QD = $1.45As soon as QD will announce education biz growth, hopefully it will cut in half"
Alright 10k shares at 3.48. It is so oversold. Lets go to the moon!
Why would China try to bankrupt their education technology companies?
Any spike we should sell it. I missed selling this two days back at 5.7Better to sell at loss instead of getting to 0Holding 1000 stocks at average price of $9
$4+ next week
Offloaded some shares to lower my cost average today. Now my cost average is down to: $4.50 and feel much better with my YQ investment for the long haul. Good Luck YQ Investors.
"$TAL $EDU $DAO $YQ $GOTUOne thing about Shorts. They all have Stop losses set but guess what ""When a stock is above the stop price the order becomes a market order and it executes at the next available price"". So if the education stocks open way up Monday, Shorts are Screwed. Good luck to all Longs"
This is another no brainer BUY! Cash position is many times current valuation.
"I am trapped at $13 a share. waiting for it to recover, i hope."
What a ride last week for YQ from $15 to $10. See what earning will do. Don't forget Xiaomi CEO hold over 20% of YQ shares. So he won't let this go to the waste side.
"CNBC news out, China allows IPOAnd educational stocks will give more time to make changes.It is not going to non profit and No going to delisting.... I told you,Last Friday was false news andIt created life time opportunities For us to buy a company's cash Shares discount at 60% ...I am going to buy 10k on the opening if the price less than 1.40....make a killing profit..."
"Sold 3000 @1.36, i miss the pop up @1.50. But still have 12k shares. Buy 6000 gotu shares,4000 tal. Full price still down40% at total cost. I am very confident that I will making huge profits. Or you may say that I am going to loss another 50%.Chinese like to gamble, and they never miss an opportunities.Looking at luckin coffee stocks Nio at 1.18., i was in China 2019 and the news keeps saying nio go to bk, and they did close the show room in Ningbo...."
Going up looks promising
"I added shares of YQ just now again, and keep buying now, It is a great company, buy asap and hold for long ! By the way, set your prices higher and hold for sure ."
"YQ reached its Bottom and I think it will keep going up 8% everyday to head back to 2$ to 3$ range within a week. Despite new regulation, it will keep earning although at a lesser margin but with more students due to affordability in education. That's still a great Win for YQ who is known for Quality Education which Parents will always prefer over any other providers. Long on YQ."
Selling under $5 makes little sense. I am not giving away my shares. Let see if YQ can stay above $5. Brought a little more today. My cost average is now $5.33. Best of luck YQ investors.
"True Long: Are you ready to battle with the short seller for the long term? Have you done your DD on YQ? If not, don't touch this stock (warning)!"
"I don’t have much time to live, will this get to $12 soon?"
It will be $0.00 soon!
"Rare Opportunity with a Strong Buy Signal$17 Education & Technology(YQ.US)$ share price must go up above USD 1 in order to meet its compliance with the minimum bid price requirement in Nasdaq.So, we all may aware that local authorities in China will no longer approve new tuition centres, according to a document from the State Council.Companies that operate Education Technology platforms will not be allowed to raise capital through initial public offerings.The above new policy gives a huge advantage and benefits $17 Education & Technology(YQ.US)$ as well to the company stakeholders and Investors.We think the opportunity in $17 Education & Technology(YQ.US)$ is very rare and in our strong buy signal.We think its share price would go up from now, up to 5 before Christmas, up to 10 by mid January 2020, and hopefully up to 15 before Chinese New Year on February 1, 2022."
"Got some at $9.19. Don't catch this falling knife if you are not experience. For me, I see this as an opportunity. Will never sell more core position until the big bounce happens! Good Luck YQ investors!"
17 Education & Technology is up 12.75% to 1.15

"Patience Long. Do understand unfortunately there are a lot of bag holder who brought in $9 and above. So when the share price increase, those bag holders will try to unload. But eventually just remember the IPO price is $10 and it will eventually (The Keyword is EVENTUALLY) get back up there if you can hold on. Good Luck YQ investors!"
Does seem to be going below 1 soon. Waiting patiently to load.
Never give up. This is bottom.
3k shares again @1.11I don't believe the tutoring businesses will disappeared in China. Period.
"1) $YQ - Super Bullish at these rock bottom price $1.20. No Brainer to buy till $2 with 1 yr Price Target of $15.2) Debt Free, $2.75/share Cash ( RMB2,240 Mil (US$342 Mil) , 21% rise in Quarterly Revenue 3) Innovative Technology - Owns 3 Leading Patents and 33 more applied4) Bought thousands and will hold for 1+ yr for LT Gain of 500% . Dont care about ST moves. 5) Beaten down heavily ( from high of $23.93) based on China Regulations which it will easily absorb and transforrm itself based on its cutting-edge technology. Buying $10+ worth stock at 90% discount for $1.12 - $1.80 is a No Brainer Value Investment. Just needs little patience of couple of months.. 6) Dont miss the opportunity before major Institution/Hedge fund Accumulate YQ at rock bottom price ."
The best thing that can happen to this is it becomes a meme stock & Reddit runs it up to $10
"There r not going to be non profit, government setting the price for k12. And open up adults training market for existing companies. Buying more if yq still down on Monday. If bad news is a good thing to buy, then we may see 100% jump..."
$YQ Breakout to $3.25 soon and will sustain that .. mark my words.
I need this to go back to $23 by November
"As July 30,2021.Kraneshares csi China Internet ETF, a 5 billion usd fund purchase 2.1 millions shares of YQ. And as Sept 15th, the funds increase YQ holding to 3 million Shares...... We Longs shouldn't be worried too much. Under cash value 1.68 is lifetime opportunity"
"got in at 6.50 , any advice?"
"Right time to jump in,"
"If you think 7.52% drops for YQ is bad today. It is actually pretty strong compares to its peers DAO, EDU, GSX, TAL. Muddy Water is doing something to the on-line education industry in China for sure. But short wil eventually have to cover much like GME."
Same track as NIO two years ago
"YQ - Back to $2 within 5 days.. Overreaction brought it down and so will go up everyday from now on.. Back to $3 within a month ,,"
It’s going to $0 & I could’ve sold at $1.75 Friday 
Look like the big boy is buying now! Thanks for the cheap shares at $6.50 yesterday :)
The volume will tell the true story. There are very little panic seller left. If you can stand the pain in the short term. There is only one way to go in the long term. But honestly YQ is not suitable for new investor!
"Looking at $10’s didn’t buy in, waited for reversal but slipped to $6’s. Waited for reversal but dropped to $4’s. Waited for reversal but dived to $1. This time is waiting for entry. I’m always lucky with the 4th time, and will be sure to da moon soon "
$3.75 this week
"Accumulated more YQ at these dirt prices for something worth atleast $9. Look at its big Cash /share and various Patents, If it goes for Privatization, this will sky rocket to $7+ easily ."

"I knew it, bounced off $2.51It’s positive right now"
At least $4.50 today
"So this is going to $0, right?"
Maybe yq finally find a near short term bottom.
"Anyone see the statistics page here quoted in USD, rather than CNY, Is that in error?"
This is the best buy in the market
Turning point for $YQ to $1.4 within 2 weeks & $2 within a month & $4.89 by Dec . Shorties have no option but to Short Cover.

Steve continues to convey and procure predictable benefits for me. He's awesome"
$20 next week
This thing will be $40 before year end

At least I finally stopped buying shares
Do you think YQ can become profitable?
"Started Long Position since cant think of such bottom price after it got dragged down from $23.9 to $0.95. A Small Positive news on EDU, will sky rocket this one with so many Patents , Good Cash & Innovative Tech."
"Short bear trap in effect. Once TAL reports earnings today, they will all go up huge."
Breakout time for $YQ now ? Fake rumors from Operators tanked it from $23.9 to $1.25 now. No Brainer to buy at this Bottom price where it can only sky rocket . Huge Cash ~ 2.73/share .. Shouldn't this be atleast $7 worth ? Privatization will easily sky rocket this back to $10+. Dont care about ST moves.. I'm ACCUMULATING YQ in 100Ks.

"From YQ's CEO regarding the future of Chinese on-line education. A very insightful opinion I thought:I would like to talk about how I can see the education industry in the longer run. There have been a lot of attention around potential regulatory policies on the education sector. The online classroom and online education measured in the 14th five-year plan are not limited to online school, but also include the digitalization of various in-school education scenario. The education authorities also rolled out a series of supporting policies on online education, online homework, and personalized homework.For example, in the Opinions on Strengthening the Construction and Application of Online Education Resources in Primary and Secondary Schools, [Foreign language], and the Notice of Strengthening Homework Management in Schools and Compulsory Education [Foreign language], the government introduced new requirements to leverage technology to make in-school teachings more efficient and tailored to the needs of students. In the Guideline on Curbing Myopia among School Children [Foreign language] issued on April 28, the authorities also take an approach to allow our teaching time using digital products, which should be less than 30% of total teaching time. We believe these policies will benefit the industry in the long run and support orderly, healthy, and sustainable growth. It is also clear that the education authorities now have a clear vision about the current situation and the future direction of the education system.China has also included in its 14th five-year plan a long-term goal of becoming a strong country in education by 2035. Guided by our vision, we believe that we can support the government's efforts to improve education. We aim to improve the learning experience for students, address the challenges of education inequality, tailor education to meet students' individual educational needs, and stimulate students to pursue all-around development through ability-oriented education. Ultimately, education is to serve students, whether it's done in-school or after-school, whether it's delivered by teachers, instructors, or by tutors after school, and whether it is conducted online or offline."

I got a strange feeling we see $2.75 next week
"Interesting FactsFounded in 2012, $17 Education & Technology(YQ.US)$ provides a smart in-school classroom solution that delivers data-driven teaching, learning, and assessment products to teachers, students, and parents across over 70,000 K12 schools. It claims to have covered 56% of the primary schools, 60% of the middle schools, and 7% of the high schools in China in the first half of 2020.Their online services represented 30.2%, 88.5%, and 93.0% of its total net revenues in 2018, 2019, and the nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively.Support independent journalism.The company claims it has serviced over 900,000 teachers, 54.3 million students, and 45.2 million parents as registered users on a cumulative basis.Proceeds from the IPO, in January 2021, will be used to improve its after-school tutoring services and student learning experience operations, as well as enhance the product offerings and educational content of their smart in-school classroom solution. It will also invest in technology infrastructure and its sales, marketing, and brand promotional activities, according to the filing.In 2018, the company raised US$250 million in a series E round led by Temasek Holdings. It’s also backed by Tiger Global, Shunwei Capital, and DST Global, among others.After Government Crackdown, What’s Next for China’s Edtech Firms?With new regulations hitting hard at home, China’s education firms are going global.""The implementation of the regulation on education supervision, along with other measures recently introduced, shows that the government is serious about pushing 'double reduction' policies, which have been talked about for a few years,"" Li Yanjie, a teacher at a high school in Fengtai district, told the Global Times. Li said she is glad to see the policies taking effect from a teacher's perspective. ""It is time to draw the attention of teachers, students and parents back to the classrooms, where the 'teaching and learning' should really be happening,"" she said. From May to July, education inspectors have conducted supervision in about 248,000 schools at all levels in China.The business-to-government path within China is also interesting for a growing number of firms. This is a large, untapped, and still unregulated market that involves selling directly to public schools, whose budgets are often controlled by their local governments. With governments at all levels putting more pressure on public schools to fill the gap the regulations are creating in the after-school market, public schools will need to develop capacity in IT services, curriculum design, and sheer workforce.The new regulations actually provide more opportunities as schools will need more excellent content, which requires the assistance from $17 Education & Technology(YQ.US)$.Experimental schools, which have more leeway and autonomy in their budgets, may be a good entry point for companies interested in developing their business-to-government revenues. The key question, however, will be how much local governments and public schools are willing to pay, and charge their students, for these services.Despite stringent regulations that have damaged many edtech firms in the market, a sizable number of companies see opportunities for product development. Many are reorienting their customer acquisition strategies through different channels or markets and offering more innovative products. The regulations ousted the newest entrants, but edtech’s largest players may well be poised for the sustainable growth that had eluded them."

the question you should ask yourself:1. how much you could lost?2.how long you could hold it until it back up?3.how much cash YQ has and how much debt it has? 4.if it will not BK then buy it every 15% drop. this is anther NIO example.5.Do you trust LeiJun? He pick the right CEO.6.K12 will it disappear in China? ---if so then the Sun is rise up from west.7.EDU; TAL;GOTU;YQ will be ok; but two of them may joint together.8.look at the market cap value; not the daily stock price. you are buying deep discount here if you are doing same business as YQ; TAL.

"Any serious long wish to check YQ's peers can put these on your watch list. Currently this whole sector seems to be rising and falling all together due to the Chinese government regulation or trends:DAO, EDU, GSX, TAL, IHGSX & TAL are the 2 with most of the short attack. I believe YQ and the others are just following along currently. This is a highly competitive sector and the reason I like YQ is it tight tie with China K12 schools and therefore they can spend much less marketing dollars to keep or acquire new students customers. And since YQ is one of the smallest of the bunch, the anti-monopoly rules in China should really favor YQ instead of punishing it. Good Luck to All YQ Longs!"
"$TAL $EDU $DAO $YQ $GOTUThere should be a nice bounce on Monday, because a lot of people will FOMO in when price is up.However:I talked with my partner about the education companies (thought there was an opportunity), but informed me China basically wants to remove the after school education and only let children go to normal school, to save burden for parents who might want to have 3 children (which is possible now) from paying too much. China wants families to increase in size to tackle the problem of an aging society."
Looking good! Rising in the largest volume for the last month already as of now! Big money accumulating for sure - Finally about time :)
