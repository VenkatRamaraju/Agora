"Best time to get rich buying at cheapest rate now in 1.3x to 2.x . Buy YQ in 20,000 shares .. Will triple within a week after these Fake rumors r dispelled.Bought another huge lots today.. will keep buying in tons.."
"Definitely going bankrupt, short it down to $0"
$23/share next year
My cost average is now $10.71. Let see how many more panic sellers are out there :)
"$TAL $EDU $DAO $YQ $GOTUThere should be a nice bounce on Monday, because a lot of people will FOMO in when price is up.However:I talked with my partner about the education companies (thought there was an opportunity), but informed me China basically wants to remove the after school education and only let children go to normal school, to save burden for parents who might want to have 3 children (which is possible now) from paying too much. China wants families to increase in size to tackle the problem of an aging society."
Is it a buy here at $1.40?
"I added shares of YQ just now again, and keep buying now, It is a great company, buy asap and hold for long ! By the way, set your prices higher and hold for sure ."
Gonna close at $2.85 today
What a ride. Let’s give it 2 years. 
"At the point when I saw declarations everywhere I thought they were bots or that they were made up till I was persuaded and gave it a try and genuinely I don't regret the move I made on the grounds that I invested my reserve funds, and now my first speculation with him acquired me benefits of more than $87,000 and its still running! Steve continues to convey and procure predictable benefits for me. He's awesome"
$23/share by December
"Today, yq above 1.40 will push to 2.00...Edu is good place to put your money too...I only pay attention for their cash level.Yq under 2.6 cash value still a good buy not for short. Tuesday21 million volumes is higher than first day IPO, considering its 31 million issues, turnover 70%. Rate... Bottom was done. Today break 1.40 we will see 2 by Friday"
It will be $0.00 soon!
I will keep Accumulating YQ at this Bottom price. Dont care about ST Move.. into LT Investment . Will hold for 1-2 yrs with LOT Cap gain of 700% atleast. Have been 100% successful in such moves in past 20 yrs of Investment and never been wrong.. YQ is my current Target . Have sold several other Nasdaq high PE stocks to get a heavy investment at these Bottom Prices. My Confidence Level : 2000% on YQ. Have Patience and see results yourself soon. Way to go YQ !!!!!!!!!!!
OMG. Under $10. Very Scary. Let me buy more :)
I didn?t think this #$%$ would break $10
Coming on! Nasdaq down almost 200 points and YQ only down 0.20? How am I suppose to get cheaper shares for my portfolio? Coming Panic Seller: Time for you to sell more so I can buy them off your paper hand!
Any spike we should sell it. I missed selling this two days back at 5.7Better to sell at loss instead of getting to 0Holding 1000 stocks at average price of $9
"Let’s see if it can close in the green for the first time in 6 months, fpos"
I need this to go back to $23 by November
This is a dead in the water #$%$ where?s that Chinese analyst that upgrade this to $22 PT in February?
"There r not going to be non profit, government setting the price for k12. And open up adults training market for existing companies. Buying more if yq still down on Monday. If bad news is a good thing to buy, then we may see 100% jump..."
Going to get crucified next week STRONG SELL
If today’s market sell off is been triggered by the Delta variant one could assume YQ should bounce back if the fear is a new wave of lockdowns!
These kind of stocks is meant for selling at open and cover at market close
What a round trip for this #$%$$10 to $24 to $10
$2.25 today
Breaking news coming Friday…
"Sold 3000 @1.36, i miss the pop up @1.50. But still have 12k shares. Buy 6000 gotu shares,4000 tal. Full price still down40% at total cost. I am very confident that I will making huge profits. Or you may say that I am going to loss another 50%.Chinese like to gamble, and they never miss an opportunities.Looking at luckin coffee stocks Nio at 1.18., i was in China 2019 and the news keeps saying nio go to bk, and they did close the show room in Ningbo...."
Might as well gamble on a $1.37 stock
Nobody sells here! Keep calm!
It was clearly mentioned that After hours tutoring has to follow fee standard established by authority. Meaning still they are going to earn something. Not like these are gonna close.
"Accumulated more YQ at these dirt prices for something worth atleast $9. Look at its big Cash /share and various Patents, If it goes for Privatization, this will sky rocket to $7+ easily ."
Retesting the $6.50 support. Let see if it will double bottom there. Buy orders ready!
Like your optimism
"$TAL $EDU $DAO $YQ $GOTUJust remember this fact. ""Economic fundamentals have not changed and the market will stabilize at any moment,"" Good luck to all Longs""In a front-page editorial Wednesday, the Securities Times said the recent slump ""to some extent reflects misinterpretation of policies and a venting of emotion.""""""It added that ""Economic fundamentals have not changed and the market will stabilize at any moment,"" according to Bloomberg and Reuters.

XIAOMI HOLDING 20% OF YQ; JUST LOOKING HOW TENCENT INVESTMENT ANOTHER 100M USD IN NIO @ 3.00/SHARE LAST YEAR. WE COULD SEE XIAOMI STEP-IN AND PUSH THE PRICE OVER 6.00 SOON.
Glad for you that you have a money printing press but I have to put food on the table for my family.
I have a feeling a short squeeze is about to happen anytime.
2.8 billion RMB on hand after IPO
"Yq has about 350 million cash on hands and doesn't want to buyback the shares in this insane level.... Unbelievable, they may want us to go zero and keep the money for themselves. I am going to find a lawyer for this.They can't get away with my money. Xu xiaoping, the co funder is Canadian citizen with his two sons in Canada. It better filling out the lawsuit against him before shares go to zero."
Close over $2 today
"YQ - Will rocket back to $3 within.. Cash = $2.34 Billion , Debt only $232 Million. Virtually a Debt Free Company.. Regulation overreactions gave opportunity to Suckers Shorties to short . Will get a Short Squeeze and Rush Buying soon.. YQ worth atleast $7 even with all the Regulations in place."
I have a feeling YQ closes positive today
Today’s the day
MLyon you don't work to look after your hunger?
This stock seems to be boneless chicken.. Go to ABNB.. Wowie Stock.. Raised my $1M to $1.5M within 1 day.. Happy Christmas!!!
17 Education & Technology is up 12.93% to 1.31
"$TAL $EDU $DAO $YQ $GOTUOne thing about Shorts. They all have Stop losses set but guess what ""When a stock is above the stop price the order becomes a market order and it executes at the next available price"". So if the education stocks open way up Monday, Shorts are Screwed. Good luck to all Longs"
Who else is buying? I am :)
Offloaded some shares to lower my cost average today. Now my cost average is down to: $4.50 and feel much better with my YQ investment for the long haul. Good Luck YQ Investors.

"Imagine buying this at $10.50 on IPO day, watch it go up to $24 & hold onto it crash all the way down to now"
"This stock is no brainer. $50 in one year. Hold for long. At least 2 million students will be enrolled on line, learning the scientific, cultural, and linguistic classes of the developing and developed world."
"Relax guys, revenue growth is doing well and even when goldman analysts are wrong, they are rarely that wrong. People are overplaying the regulatory risk, im going to keep averaging down."
"My goal is having 35k shares @1.68 average and hold up 3 years from now...next target buying @0.80..... Book value loss 50% is not a big deal for me, and I could trade it up and down by lower cost and gain more shares.If it's not going to bk near the future, I would not given up yq."
"My listing at today best dealsIs gotu, yq, tal,.... Edu has too much shares and its online company offline branches fighting each other. It does not make sense."
Huge volume in the past 4 days Tomorrow open gap will be huge.
"U don't sell ur yq stock today and going to buy tencent, baba, jd....all those investors are jumping in educational stocks this week bcz they are going to realize that they have not safe place to put their money.Most risky things are best return, that is wall street rules number one.... YQ @1.36 eod."
"I don’t have much time to live, will this get to $12 soon?"
Buy and Hold !
The only reason that I purchased the stock was the recommendation of Goldman. To me it is very scary that there has been no update from the firm after the release of the earnings
"I don?t have long to live I made a big mistake starting to buy this #$%$ at $12.50 & all the way down to $1I need it to go back up to at least $8, please help as much as you can ??"
Anything new about this stock?
"I am not surprised of the price drop today, I am a long term investor of this company, so I don’t mind the ups and downs. If you know China, you know the potential of this company, Chinese parents will spend every penny they have for their children and there will be millions new middle-class every year in China. I don’t expect to make any money from this stock in next couple months, if you want to make quick money, skip this stock, it is not the right time"
Going up looks promising
One of the safest stocks in 2021? The number of school and onboarded students will increase heavily during next quarters!

But eventually just remember the IPO price is $10 and it will eventually (The Keyword is EVENTUALLY) get back up there if you can hold on. Good Luck YQ investors!"

At least I finally stopped buying shares
"Edu and tal cancelled the reportsLast Friday after market closed. They were down 5% on Monday morning and closed up 5%!!!!The price movement tells everything, we are overreacting. YQ had strong cash position and they could handle this situation. All we need to do is buy buy buy....."
Never give up.........
Why couldn’t they announce this at $12/share?
"Super Bullish on $YQ . Its not about if but when YQ will be back to $3 + . Privatization in offing & so accumulation to start from Institutions & Hedge Funds ? So strong Fundamentally.. good Cash , Innovative Patented Technologies ."

"So this is going to $0, right?"
I think big buys are jumping today. over 7M shares traded so far.
All I need is $5.75 to break even
fly to the moon
Breakout time for $YQ now ? Fake rumors from Operators tanked it from $23.9 to $1.25 now. No Brainer to buy at this Bottom price where it can only sky rocket . Huge Cash ~ 2.73/share .. Shouldn't this be atleast $7 worth ? Privatization will easily sky rocket this back to $10+. Dont care about ST moves.. I'm ACCUMULATING YQ in 100Ks.
The worst stock in this entire world. Mostly will file bankruptcy and loot the money from ipo
What a ride last week for YQ from $15 to $10. See what earning will do. Don't forget Xiaomi CEO hold over 20% of YQ shares. So he won't let this go to the waste side.
YQ is very good buy at 10$ a sharebut i never hold a lot of share for each stockwhen the school open back this stock very fast jump back to 24$ do you guy see insider sell any shares . all they are trying to add . in here those people are trying scare you to sell this stockwhatever school have open back up in near future .
"$TAL $EDU $DAO $YQ $GOTUThe sentence below from todays Bloomberg News, is going to Crush Shorts on Monday.

this is going up!!!!
This is the best buy in the market
About time :)
"The company has 2.8 billion yuanAfter IPO 6 months, on May Q1Showed positive cash flows. Why we should panic about k12Business. In Chinese stocks market, most of companies had debt and unreliable business. Why do we sold out at this price?Look at luckin coffee, amc, nio, Gme, snap, Boeing,....... ThereFalse news all over the media for one reason, they want your shares!!!"
IT’S HALTED!!!!!!
"I am trapped at $13 a share. waiting for it to recover, i hope."
Alright 10k shares at 3.48. It is so oversold. Lets go to the moon!
"Any serious long wish to check YQ's peers can put these on your watch list. Currently this whole sector seems to be rising and falling all together due to the Chinese government regulation or trends:DAO, EDU, GSX, TAL, IHGSX & TAL are the 2 with most of the short attack. I believe YQ and the others are just following along currently. This is a highly competitive sector and the reason I like YQ is it tight tie with China K12 schools and therefore they can spend much less marketing dollars to keep or acquire new students customers. And since YQ is one of the smallest of the bunch, the anti-monopoly rules in China should really favor YQ instead of punishing it. Good Luck to All YQ Longs!"
Goldman Sachs analyst Christine Cho gave it a $21 price target 6 months ago
Wow! They repriced this on the fly from $21 to $18 in the span time of a whole minute. I got it for around 3 bucks less than I was ready to pay for...Thanks for the discount!!
"Expect $19 by March 5, before earnings announcement. It is going to be blockbuster earnings. Very high enrollment due to pandemic, and thereafter, the love of learning on line will keep subscribers hooked to the program. Long term, $50 by mid-year, if it doesn’t jump to $50 in March 8."
"$TAL $DAO $YQ $GOTU This is the link to how EDU is transforming to the changes that are taking place, Thanks to @MIKE at EDU. You will need to use google to translate it to english.

Never give up....Nothing for sale b4 2.00
Do you think YQ can become profitable?
What if the company buys all share now and issue new shares?
probably open under $15 today
This is a dead board
"From YQ's CEO regarding the future of Chinese on-line education. A very insightful opinion I thought:I would like to talk about how I can see the education industry in the longer run. There have been a lot of attention around potential regulatory policies on the education sector. The online classroom and online education measured in the 14th five-year plan are not limited to online school, but also include the digitalization of various in-school education scenario. The education authorities also rolled out a series of supporting policies on online education, online homework, and personalized homework.For example, in the Opinions on Strengthening the Construction and Application of Online Education Resources in Primary and Secondary Schools, [Foreign language], and the Notice of Strengthening Homework Management in Schools and Compulsory Education [Foreign language], the government introduced new requirements to leverage technology to make in-school teachings more efficient and tailored to the needs of students. In the Guideline on Curbing Myopia among School Children [Foreign language] issued on April 28, the authorities also take an approach to allow our teaching time using digital products, which should be less than 30% of total teaching time. We believe these policies will benefit the industry in the long run and support orderly, healthy, and sustainable growth. It is also clear that the education authorities now have a clear vision about the current situation and the future direction of the education system.China has also included in its 14th five-year plan a long-term goal of becoming a strong country in education by 2035. Guided by our vision, we believe that we can support the government's efforts to improve education. We aim to improve the learning experience for students, address the challenges of education inequality, tailor education to meet students' individual educational needs, and stimulate students to pursue all-around development through ability-oriented education. Ultimately, education is to serve students, whether it's done in-school or after-school, whether it's delivered by teachers, instructors, or by tutors after school, and whether it is conducted online or offline."
$4+ next week
Why would China try to bankrupt their education technology companies?
The volume will tell the true story. There are very little panic seller left. If you can stand the pain in the short term. There is only one way to go in the long term. But honestly YQ is not suitable for new investor!
$YQ - Back to $3.5 by end of Sep .. am so glad I am long on YQ . But won't sell for less than $5 even though my avg buy price is $1.25 now..
I got a strange feeling we see $2.75 next week
$YQ Breakout to $3.25 soon and will sustain that .. mark my words.
"Looking at $10’s didn’t buy in, waited for reversal but slipped to $6’s. Waited for reversal but dropped to $4’s. Waited for reversal but dived to $1. This time is waiting for entry. I’m always lucky with the 4th time, and will be sure to da moon soon "
$1.50 today
This is dream come true.I am buying 10k today. My target was 1.58Save a lot of money
Same track as NIO two years ago
47$ soon
17 Education & Technology is up 12.50% to 1.17
YQ is in 70k schools across china. revenue is 107% increase year over year. They are not big enough to violate the anti-trust law in china making them an easy buy imo.
"YQ reached its Bottom and I think it will keep going up 8% everyday to head back to 2$ to 3$ range within a week. Despite new regulation, it will keep earning although at a lesser margin but with more students due to affordability in education. That's still a great Win for YQ who is known for Quality Education which Parents will always prefer over any other providers. Long on YQ."
Who still dare to buy :) I just did. Good Luck YQ Investors!

"If you think 7.52% drops for YQ is bad today. It is actually pretty strong compares to its peers DAO, EDU, GSX, TAL. Muddy Water is doing something to the on-line education industry in China for sure. But short wil eventually have to cover much like GME."
Selling under $5 makes little sense. I am not giving away my shares. Let see if YQ can stay above $5. Brought a little more today. My cost average is now $5.33. Best of luck YQ investors.
I think this Chinese adr will come back. It is in the right business. Chinese love to invest in their children education.
Sold some this morning. Time to buy again near $10. Thank you panic seller & chasers :)
6.15% was down on pre market and now is all the way up. Something is going on.
what is going on with this stock. Target price 20 then in the last 3 months its lost 60% of its price? This cant be just short selling? What am I missing here?
"As July 30,2021.Kraneshares csi China Internet ETF, a 5 billion usd fund purchase 2.1 millions shares of YQ. And as Sept 15th, the funds increase YQ holding to 3 million Shares...... We Longs shouldn't be worried too much. Under cash value 1.68 is lifetime opportunity"

The reasons are :1. Yq tutoring fees is only half what others charges. 2. They only served 2 million students in past few years,, other than 9 cities banned. The market is still favourable for em.3. Yq spent more R&D than gotuCompared theirs sales and market cap. It means there are some things we don't see and not understand. 4. The COF has 2% of the company means we should not worry about the number in their balance sheet. It was like nio back to 2019. Scared but safe by the end."

Look like the big boy is buying now! Thanks for the cheap shares at $6.50 yesterday :)
There is high probability that only new orient and TAL will remain listed. All other stocks like YQ will be delisted. That's why people might move over to EDU or TAL
"Better not to catch a falling knife. If invested at higher price, then better don't check. New investment never ever think of investing"
Keep closing higher…
"Got some at $9.19. Don't catch this falling knife if you are not experience. For me, I see this as an opportunity. Will never sell more core position until the big bounce happens! Good Luck YQ investors!"
"True Long: Are you ready to battle with the short seller for the long term? Have you done your DD on YQ? If not, don't touch this stock (warning)!"
"I keep buying YQ now, buy asap and hold !"
8k filled... Tkx....
"Anyone see the statistics page here quoted in USD, rather than CNY, Is that in error?"
"Here we go, on way to $1.90 today"
Will be picked by momo crowd?
"Started Long Position since cant think of such bottom price after it got dragged down from $23.9 to $0.95. A Small Positive news on EDU, will sky rocket this one with so many Patents , Good Cash & Innovative Tech."
At least $4.50 today
This thing will be $40 before year end
"This is gonna move just like NIO, $3 to $65"
Does seem to be going below 1 soon. Waiting patiently to load.
the question you should ask yourself:1. how much you could lost?2.how long you could hold it until it back up?3.how much cash YQ has and how much debt it has? 4.if it will not BK then buy it every 15% drop. this is anther NIO example.5.Do you trust LeiJun? He pick the right CEO.6.K12 will it disappear in China? ---if so then the Sun is rise up from west.7.EDU; TAL;GOTU;YQ will be ok; but two of them may joint together.8.look at the market cap value; not the daily stock price. you are buying deep discount here if you are doing same business as YQ; TAL.
"Under cash value 1.68 I am stillBuying, before 2.22 will not sell A single share of YQ. 3 million shares now exchanged hands... It will close above 1.3Today...."
Appears to be selling pressure as there is no news to stimulate buying at the present time.
"Huge beat top and bottom line.Excellent guidance.Great and detailed conference call, where MS and GS representatives asked challenging questions.Company expected to achieve break-even in the next couple of quarters. Plenty of cash flow."
I will holding until hit $25.00 to sell
Never give up. This is bottom.
Thought 8% increase everyday but it started with 42% increase now today itself. Time to Rocket back to $3 within days..
