"Rare Opportunity with a Strong Buy Signal$17 Education & Technology(YQ.US)$ share price must go up above USD 1 in order to meet its compliance with the minimum bid price requirement in Nasdaq.So, we all may aware that local authorities in China will no longer approve new tuition centres, according to a document from the State Council.Companies that operate Education Technology platforms will not be allowed to raise capital through initial public offerings.The above new policy gives a huge advantage and benefits $17 Education & Technology(YQ.US)$ as well to the company stakeholders and Investors.We think the opportunity in $17 Education & Technology(YQ.US)$ is very rare and in our strong buy signal.We think its share price would go up from now, up to 5 before Christmas, up to 10 by mid January 2020, and hopefully up to 15 before Chinese New Year on February 1, 2022."

Turning point for $YQ to $1.4 within 2 weeks & $2 within a month & $4.89 by Dec . Shorties have no option but to Short Cover.
"Interesting FactsFounded in 2012, $17 Education & Technology(YQ.US)$ provides a smart in-school classroom solution that delivers data-driven teaching, learning, and assessment products to teachers, students, and parents across over 70,000 K12 schools. It claims to have covered 56% of the primary schools, 60% of the middle schools, and 7% of the high schools in China in the first half of 2020.Their online services represented 30.2%, 88.5%, and 93.0% of its total net revenues in 2018, 2019, and the nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively.Support independent journalism.The company claims it has serviced over 900,000 teachers, 54.3 million students, and 45.2 million parents as registered users on a cumulative basis.Proceeds from the IPO, in January 2021, will be used to improve its after-school tutoring services and student learning experience operations, as well as enhance the product offerings and educational content of their smart in-school classroom solution. It will also invest in technology infrastructure and its sales, marketing, and brand promotional activities, according to the filing.In 2018, the company raised US$250 million in a series E round led by Temasek Holdings. It’s also backed by Tiger Global, Shunwei Capital, and DST Global, among others.After Government Crackdown, What’s Next for China’s Edtech Firms?With new regulations hitting hard at home, China’s education firms are going global.""The implementation of the regulation on education supervision, along with other measures recently introduced, shows that the government is serious about pushing 'double reduction' policies, which have been talked about for a few years,"" Li Yanjie, a teacher at a high school in Fengtai district, told the Global Times. Li said she is glad to see the policies taking effect from a teacher's perspective. ""It is time to draw the attention of teachers, students and parents back to the classrooms, where the 'teaching and learning' should really be happening,"" she said. From May to July, education inspectors have conducted supervision in about 248,000 schools at all levels in China.The business-to-government path within China is also interesting for a growing number of firms. This is a large, untapped, and still unregulated market that involves selling directly to public schools, whose budgets are often controlled by their local governments. With governments at all levels putting more pressure on public schools to fill the gap the regulations are creating in the after-school market, public schools will need to develop capacity in IT services, curriculum design, and sheer workforce.The new regulations actually provide more opportunities as schools will need more excellent content, which requires the assistance from $17 Education & Technology(YQ.US)$.Experimental schools, which have more leeway and autonomy in their budgets, may be a good entry point for companies interested in developing their business-to-government revenues. The key question, however, will be how much local governments and public schools are willing to pay, and charge their students, for these services.Despite stringent regulations that have damaged many edtech firms in the market, a sizable number of companies see opportunities for product development. Many are reorienting their customer acquisition strategies through different channels or markets and offering more innovative products. The regulations ousted the newest entrants, but edtech’s largest players may well be poised for the sustainable growth that had eluded them."
"Yq has about 350 million cash on hands and doesn't want to buyback the shares in this insane level.... Unbelievable, they may want us to go zero and keep the money for themselves. I am going to find a lawyer for this.They can't get away with my money. Xu xiaoping, the co funder is Canadian citizen with his two sons in Canada. It better filling out the lawsuit against him before shares go to zero."
"Strong Buy$YQ CEO message regarding the future of Chinese on-line education. A very insightful opinion I thought:I would like to talk about how I can see the education industry in the longer run. There have been a lot of attention around potential regulatory policies on the education sector. The online classroom and online education measured in the 14th five-year plan are not limited to online school, but also include the digitalization of various in-school education scenario. The education authorities also rolled out a series of supporting policies on online education, online homework, and personalized homework.For example, in the Opinions on Strengthening the Construction and Application of Online Education Resources in Primary and Secondary Schools, [Foreign language], and the Notice of Strengthening Homework Management in Schools and Compulsory Education [Foreign language], the government introduced new requirements to leverage technology to make in-school teachings more efficient and tailored to the needs of students. In the Guideline on Curbing Myopia among School Children [Foreign language] issued on April 28, the authorities also take an approach to allow our teaching time using digital products, which should be less than 30% of total teaching time. We believe these policies will benefit the industry in the long run and support orderly, healthy, and sustainable growth. It is also clear that the education authorities now have a clear vision about the current situation and the future direction of the education system.China has also included in its 14th five-year plan a long-term goal of becoming a strong country in education by 2035. Guided by our vision, we believe that we can support the government's efforts to improve education. We aim to improve the learning experience for students, address the challenges of education inequality, tailor education to meet students' individual educational needs, and stimulate students to pursue all-around development through ability-oriented education. Ultimately, education is to serve students, whether it's done in-school or after-school, whether it's delivered by teachers, instructors, or by tutors after school, and whether it is conducted online or offline."
