Tal ..a better company
"$TAL $EDU $DAO $YQ $GOTUJust remember this fact. ""Economic fundamentals have not changed and the market will stabilize at any moment,"" Good luck to all Longs""In a front-page editorial Wednesday, the Securities Times said the recent slump ""to some extent reflects misinterpretation of policies and a venting of emotion.""""""It added that ""Economic fundamentals have not changed and the market will stabilize at any moment,"" according to Bloomberg and Reuters. Other securities dailies echoed those comments."""
Selling under $5 makes little sense. I am not giving away my shares. Let see if YQ can stay above $5. Brought a little more today. My cost average is now $5.33. Best of luck YQ investors.
I got a strange feeling we see $2.75 next week
This will get back up to $12 
Can’t believe it was .43 higher today
$2.25 today
It’s going to $0 & I could’ve sold at $1.75 Friday 
Today’s the day
Never going to hit 1.25 again
It's Over. 0 soon
This thing will be $40 before year end
Will be picked by momo crowd?
"They should just liquidate the company, if the amount of cash is even remotely accurate"
the question you should ask yourself:1. how much you could lost?2.how long you could hold it until it back up?3.how much cash YQ has and how much debt it has? 4.if it will not BK then buy it every 15% drop. this is anther NIO example.5.Do you trust LeiJun? He pick the right CEO.6.K12 will it disappear in China? ---if so then the Sun is rise up from west.7.EDU; TAL;GOTU;YQ will be ok; but two of them may joint together.8.look at the market cap value; not the daily stock price. you are buying deep discount here if you are doing same business as YQ; TAL.
I think big buys are jumping today. over 7M shares traded so far.
$23/share by December
"I don’t have much time to live, will this get to $12 soon?"
"Once again, shunwei capital is belong to leijun, ceo of xiaomi.They produce ai companion robot alpha, xiaoai teacher, and it will join with YQ for the future bcz shunwei capital is holding 20% of YQ. Leijun would not leave us for nothing. Be faithful and stay by lions."
"If you think 7.52% drops for YQ is bad today. It is actually pretty strong compares to its peers DAO, EDU, GSX, TAL. Muddy Water is doing something to the on-line education industry in China for sure. But short wil eventually have to cover much like GME."
I would love to know why it shot up to $1.77
"$TAL $EDU $DAO $YQ $GOTUThere should be a nice bounce on Monday, because a lot of people will FOMO in when price is up.However:I talked with my partner about the education companies (thought there was an opportunity), but informed me China basically wants to remove the after school education and only let children go to normal school, to save burden for parents who might want to have 3 children (which is possible now) from paying too much. China wants families to increase in size to tackle the problem of an aging society."
Sold some this morning. Time to buy again near $10. Thank you panic seller & chasers :)
I live in vegas and my 1000 bucks on a weekend just disappears so yup you are correct . This is much safer
"come on you can do it , will be breaking the $20 barrier soon"
When is this going back to $24?
"Imagine buying this at $10.50 on IPO day, watch it go up to $24 & hold onto it crash all the way down to now"
Nobody sells here! Keep calm!
"Everyday dumpling 1 million shares at the opening and buying back before the closing. What's your suckers games? Yq not going to delisting and they has2.4 billion yuan on March 31.If they want to privatization it, The price should be more than 3 dollars...... So, here is the money costing you.... Time."

17 Education & Technology is up 12.50% to 1.17
Why would China try to bankrupt their education technology companies?
Why did it go up to $1.77?
Either gonna be the greatest comeback in stock market history or bankruptcy
"This is gonna be the greatest turnaround in stock market history, $15 by eoy"
Waiting patiently to buy yq here. ShortsNeed to push it down faster.
"17 Education & Technology Group Inc. (NASDAQ:YQ) (""17EdTech"" or the ""Company""), a leading education technology company in China with an ""in-school + after-school"" integrated model, today noted that certain English and Chinese language media outlets reported that the PRC regulators are considering a new set of regulations concerning after-school tutoring service related to school subjects taught in China's compulsory education system. The regulations have not been published, and the Company has not received official notification of the regulations. It is the Company's policy not to comment on market speculations."

In compliance with the Shanghai Measures, the Company has stopped and will stop offering online Academic AST classes over weekends, national holidays and school break periods."""
"YQ still a Value Buy .. Time to load before it goes to $2 within couple of days. Cash = $2.45 Billion and Debt only $232 Mil.. Even after Govt Regulation, its value should be minimum $9. Will bounce soon when Shorties start covering up ."
"$3 is the bottom, on the way to $8 now"
"Look at the volumes.. within 10 days of stock in market, it already captured 15M volumes sold at the max. Yes, more the spike would lead to easily 100M shares sold.. Fingers crossed.."
"Expect $19 by March 5, before earnings announcement. It is going to be blockbuster earnings. Very high enrollment due to pandemic, and thereafter, the love of learning on line will keep subscribers hooked to the program. Long term, $50 by mid-year, if it doesn’t jump to $50 in March 8."
Keep closing higher…
"The company has 2.8 billion yuanAfter IPO 6 months, on May Q1Showed positive cash flows. Why we should panic about k12Business. In Chinese stocks market, most of companies had debt and unreliable business. Why do we sold out at this price?Look at luckin coffee, amc, nio, Gme, snap, Boeing,....... ThereFalse news all over the media for one reason, they want your shares!!!"
fly to the moon
This is the best buy in the market
"All Chinese stocks are at their year or all time lows, will they ever recover?"
Someone just bought a huge block of shares at $2.36
what is going on with this stock. Target price 20 then in the last 3 months its lost 60% of its price? This cant be just short selling? What am I missing here?
"i Bet 5000 Shares YQ at Dirt Cheap Prices 1.12, This is 100 Times Much Better than I bet in las Vegas, I'll take it if it Goes bankrupt, No Pain No Gain"
If they’re not going bankrupt than this is the best buy in the entire market
If this doesn’t go to $7 soon something bad is gonna happen
The worst stock in this entire world. Mostly will file bankruptcy and loot the money from ipo
"My listing at today best dealsIs gotu, yq, tal,.... Edu has too much shares and its online company offline branches fighting each other. It does not make sense."
These kind of stocks is meant for selling at open and cover at market close
"I keep buying YQ now, buy asap and hold !"
Is it a buy here at $1.40?
"My YQ holdings are now up over 12%. Whoever else wish to sell, please do! Let see if it can stay above $7 today... Good Luck YQ Investors!"
"This is gonna move just like NIO, $3 to $65"
"Definitely going bankrupt, short it down to $0"
17 Education & Technology is up 12.93% to 1.31
Someone just bought 1 million share block
"From YQ's CEO regarding the future of Chinese on-line education. A very insightful opinion I thought:I would like to talk about how I can see the education industry in the longer run. There have been a lot of attention around potential regulatory policies on the education sector. The online classroom and online education measured in the 14th five-year plan are not limited to online school, but also include the digitalization of various in-school education scenario. The education authorities also rolled out a series of supporting policies on online education, online homework, and personalized homework.For example, in the Opinions on Strengthening the Construction and Application of Online Education Resources in Primary and Secondary Schools, [Foreign language], and the Notice of Strengthening Homework Management in Schools and Compulsory Education [Foreign language], the government introduced new requirements to leverage technology to make in-school teachings more efficient and tailored to the needs of students. In the Guideline on Curbing Myopia among School Children [Foreign language] issued on April 28, the authorities also take an approach to allow our teaching time using digital products, which should be less than 30% of total teaching time. We believe these policies will benefit the industry in the long run and support orderly, healthy, and sustainable growth. It is also clear that the education authorities now have a clear vision about the current situation and the future direction of the education system.China has also included in its 14th five-year plan a long-term goal of becoming a strong country in education by 2035. Guided by our vision, we believe that we can support the government's efforts to improve education. We aim to improve the learning experience for students, address the challenges of education inequality, tailor education to meet students' individual educational needs, and stimulate students to pursue all-around development through ability-oriented education. Ultimately, education is to serve students, whether it's done in-school or after-school, whether it's delivered by teachers, instructors, or by tutors after school, and whether it is conducted online or offline."
$23/share next year

If it doesn’t go to $0 it’ll probably go to $10
The best thing that can happen to this is it becomes a meme stock & Reddit runs it up to $10
What year will this get back to $23/share?
"Under cash value 1.68 I am stillBuying, before 2.22 will not sell A single share of YQ. 3 million shares now exchanged hands... It will close above 1.3Today...."

At least I finally stopped buying shares
"Very suspect trading today, hedge funds pushed this up 50% & sold"
I didn?t think this #$%$ would break $10
"YQ - Back to $2 within 5 days.. Overreaction brought it down and so will go up everyday from now on.. Back to $3 within a month ,,"
All I need is $5.75 to break even
"My broker is insane, i place 2.14Edu and it didn't filled... So i amBuying more yq for another 5k.....go..... There two articles talking yq is over sold based on TQ, Do you own research, China government already claiming investment banks they're not going ban education business. Market was overreacting."

I told you,Last Friday was false news andIt created life time opportunities For us to buy a company's cash Shares discount at 60% ...I am going to buy 10k on the opening if the price less than 1.40....make a killing profit..."
There is high probability that only new orient and TAL will remain listed. All other stocks like YQ will be delisted. That's why people might move over to EDU or TAL
I only need 5 pts
"My goal is having 35k shares @1.68 average and hold up 3 years from now...next target buying @0.80..... Book value loss 50% is not a big deal for me, and I could trade it up and down by lower cost and gain more shares.If it's not going to bk near the future, I would not given up yq."
"YQ - Will rocket back to $3 within.. Cash = $2.34 Billion , Debt only $232 Million. Virtually a Debt Free Company.. Regulation overreactions gave opportunity to Suckers Shorties to short . Will get a Short Squeeze and Rush Buying soon.. YQ worth atleast $7 even with all the Regulations in place."

China says no after school schooling... That's what this company provide a platform for... Sell it while you still can. We dumped it at around 7 usd... Which I am very happy with...

If they don’t go bankrupt it’ll be back at $7 in 5 years
What a round trip for this #$%$$10 to $24 to $10
"I knew it, bounced off $2.51It’s positive right now"
The only reason that I purchased the stock was the recommendation of Goldman. To me it is very scary that there has been no update from the firm after the release of the earnings
IT’S HALTED!!!!!!
"I am not surprised of the price drop today, I am a long term investor of this company, so I don’t mind the ups and downs. If you know China, you know the potential of this company, Chinese parents will spend every penny they have for their children and there will be millions new middle-class every year in China. I don’t expect to make any money from this stock in next couple months, if you want to make quick money, skip this stock, it is not the right time"
"There r not going to be non profit, government setting the price for k12. And open up adults training market for existing companies. Buying more if yq still down on Monday. If bad news is a good thing to buy, then we may see 100% jump..."
"Buy YQ asap at bottom range now, YQ is a great company !"

"Super Bullish on $YQ . Its not about if but when YQ will be back to $3 + . Privatization in offing & so accumulation to start from Institutions & Hedge Funds ? So strong Fundamentally.. good Cash , Innovative Patented Technologies ."
"Shunwei capital spend 44 million usd investment in yq since 2012.They owned 16.8% yq. Based onBlct, blue city IPO they haven't sold their shares. I strongly believe leijun wouldn't given up on yq. The reasons are :1. Yq tutoring fees is only half what others charges. 2. They only served 2 million students in past few years,, other than 9 cities banned. The market is still favourable for em.3. Yq spent more R&D than gotuCompared theirs sales and market cap. It means there are some things we don't see and not understand. 4. The COF has 2% of the company means we should not worry about the number in their balance sheet. It was like nio back to 2019. Scared but safe by the end."
FROM 19.60 DROP TO 4.60; _75% OFF.WHEN YOU ALL IN @ 4.60; IT WILL DROP TO 1.18; ANOTHE 75% OFF. THAT IS THE GAME. YOU NEED TIME TO GET THERE AND CASH TOO.@4.60 YOUR 1000 SHARE COST WILL BUY YOU MORE @1.18 FOR 3898 SHARES.THEN YOUR AVG WILL DROP TO 1.88 FOR 4898 SHARES.GO SEE THE NIO PRICE MOVEMENT.

I have a feeling a short squeeze is about to happen anytime.
"Huge beat top and bottom line.Excellent guidance.Great and detailed conference call, where MS and GS representatives asked challenging questions.Company expected to achieve break-even in the next couple of quarters. Plenty of cash flow."
17 Education & Technology is down 19.86% to 1.13
"1) $YQ - Super Bullish at these rock bottom price $1.20.

Just needs little patience of couple of months.. 6) Dont miss the opportunity before major Institution/Hedge fund Accumulate YQ at rock bottom price ."
What if the company buys all share now and issue new shares?
How can a company with $2.24B in cash have a $500M market cap?
"Patience Long. Do understand unfortunately there are a lot of bag holder who brought in $9 and above. So when the share price increase, those bag holders will try to unload. But eventually just remember the IPO price is $10 and it will eventually (The Keyword is EVENTUALLY) get back up there if you can hold on. Good Luck YQ investors!"
$7.50 today
It will be $0.00 soon!
"So this is going to $0, right?"
Nothing related to the potential pandemic of Delta! It’s because of the power struggle and distribution of benefits!
"YQ reached its Bottom and I think it will keep going up 8% everyday to head back to 2$ to 3$ range within a week. Despite new regulation, it will keep earning although at a lesser margin but with more students due to affordability in education. That's still a great Win for YQ who is known for Quality Education which Parents will always prefer over any other providers. Long on YQ."

The volume will tell the true story. There are very little panic seller left. If you can stand the pain in the short term. There is only one way to go in the long term. But honestly YQ is not suitable for new investor!
Thought 8% increase everyday but it started with 42% increase now today itself. Time to Rocket back to $3 within days..
If today’s market sell off is been triggered by the Delta variant one could assume YQ should bounce back if the fear is a new wave of lockdowns!
3k shares again @1.11I don't believe the tutoring businesses will disappeared in China. Period.
"no one knows this stock, CRY"
MLyon you don't work to look after your hunger?
"Short bear trap in effect. Once TAL reports earnings today, they will all go up huge."

Who else is buying? I am :)
Wall Street Bets is gonna pick this up & drive it to $10 
YQ is in 70k schools across china. revenue is 107% increase year over year. They are not big enough to violate the anti-trust law in china making them an easy buy imo.
Who still dare to buy :) I just did. Good Luck YQ Investors!
Offloaded some shares to lower my cost average today. Now my cost average is down to: $4.50 and feel much better with my YQ investment for the long haul. Good Luck YQ Investors.
"$TAL $EDU $DAO $YQ $GOTUThe sentence below from todays Bloomberg News, is going to Crush Shorts on Monday. Good luck to all Longs""The new regulations are focused on compulsory subjects, meaning critical material like math, science and history. Classes for art or music mostly would not fall under the new restrictions."""
"Relax guys, revenue growth is doing well and even when goldman analysts are wrong, they are rarely that wrong. People are overplaying the regulatory risk, im going to keep averaging down."
i bought this because the short ratio seemed really low (among other things) but now am wondering if it is actaully high since it is about half of all the institutional ownership shorted. Am i wrong? half of what the institutions own looks to be shorted assuming they aren't all long and some hedgie is shorting.
Any spike we should sell it. I missed selling this two days back at 5.7Better to sell at loss instead of getting to 0Holding 1000 stocks at average price of $9
"I am at $16, do you guys think it can break even in the future?"

Buying this slowly and keep for the long haul! Good Luck YQ Investors.
What a ride last week for YQ from $15 to $10. See what earning will do. Don't forget Xiaomi CEO hold over 20% of YQ shares. So he won't let this go to the waste side.
"At the point when I saw declarations everywhere I thought they were bots or that they were made up till I was persuaded and gave it a try and genuinely I don't regret the move I made on the grounds that I invested my reserve funds, and now my first speculation with him acquired me benefits of more than $87,000 and its still running! Steve continues to convey and procure predictable benefits for me. He's awesome"
OMG. Under $10. Very Scary. Let me buy more :)

One of the safest stocks in 2021? The number of school and onboarded students will increase heavily during next quarters!
Look like the big boy is buying now! Thanks for the cheap shares at $6.50 yesterday :)
Isn’t there any analyst coverage from the conference call? I thought Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs reps attended the call.
"go to moon, go to 5$"
Retesting the $6.50 support. Let see if it will double bottom there. Buy orders ready!
"got in at 6.50 , any advice?"
Coming on! Nasdaq down almost 200 points and YQ only down 0.20? How am I suppose to get cheaper shares for my portfolio? Coming Panic Seller: Time for you to sell more so I can buy them off your paper hand!
delisting?
Amazing how instead of selling it at $10 I kept pouring thousands more into this fn #$%$ I said last year I was done with fn Chinese stocks
17 Education & Technology is down 13.81% to 2.87
Appears to be selling pressure as there is no news to stimulate buying at the present time.
$YQ Breakout to $3.25 soon and will sustain that .. mark my words.
i thought i was low before at 11.50 now i just tripled my shares at 10.57 price. not sure why this at such a low price but im ok with the discount.
"True Long: Are you ready to battle with the short seller for the long term? Have you done your DD on YQ? If not, don't touch this stock (warning)!"
Buy and Hold !
TAL is down 25% in Hong Kong today
going to $50 after hours
"Does anyone know, whats going on here?"
Like your optimism
$4+ next week
Breakout time for $YQ now ? Fake rumors from Operators tanked it from $23.9 to $1.25 now. No Brainer to buy at this Bottom price where it can only sky rocket . Huge Cash ~ 2.73/share .. Shouldn't this be atleast $7 worth ? Privatization will easily sky rocket this back to $10+. Dont care about ST moves.. I'm ACCUMULATING YQ in 100Ks.
Highly Bullish on YQ . Can't dream to buy at 2.3x level . Loaded thousands.. Am dead sure it will bounce back to 4 within days and 10+ within months . Huge Cash and so little Debt.. here can u find such a gem ?Chinese govt new regulation already factored 10 times ..
When it will go up .It will up like a maniac
Going up looks promising
"Got some at $9.19. Don't catch this falling knife if you are not experience. For me, I see this as an opportunity. Will never sell more core position until the big bounce happens! Good Luck YQ investors!"
17 Education & Technology is up 12.75% to 1.15
This is dream come true.I am buying 10k today. My target was 1.58Save a lot of money
"Dammmmm this is depressing...Now that the gloom and doom is at max, the only way is to go up slowly over time."
I think I’m gonna sell it all tomorrow just to watch it go up
The 2 analysts who cover this have $20 price targets
"Better get in today, this is going to $7 "
"Right time to jump in,"
"Any serious long wish to check YQ's peers can put these on your watch list. Currently this whole sector seems to be rising and falling all together due to the Chinese government regulation or trends:DAO, EDU, GSX, TAL, IHGSX & TAL are the 2 with most of the short attack. I believe YQ and the others are just following along currently. This is a highly competitive sector and the reason I like YQ is it tight tie with China K12 schools and therefore they can spend much less marketing dollars to keep or acquire new students customers. And since YQ is one of the smallest of the bunch, the anti-monopoly rules in China should really favor YQ instead of punishing it. Good Luck to All YQ Longs!"
Do you think YQ can become profitable?
I need this to go back to $23 by November
"Looks like $10 is a strong defense of this stock, it might be a sign to bounce back, just bought another 300 shares"
