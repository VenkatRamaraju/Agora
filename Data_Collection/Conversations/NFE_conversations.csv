Without some retracement to build up support its likely this stock will tank. That was a massive jump in a single day with little volatility following it. Feels like it will drop without more momentum.
I agree with you Tony. holding long
"SINGAPORE, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Price agency S&P Global Platts is expecting Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices to fall to about $11 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) next summer from $29 per mmBtu this week, an analyst said on Tuesday.""We are expecting JKM to be well above $25 per mmBtu in winter. Prices will fall from current levels next year but will fall quite dramatically,"" said Jeff Moore, manager of Platts' Asian LNG Analytics division during the annual Platts APPEC 2021 conference.Moore added that the agency expects spot prices to fall by more than $15 to about $11 per mmBtu next summer."
"Gary, you still happy you sold?"
it's green. lol
"Their Corporate Update this morning put the fire under NFE shares, and the fear under NFE shorts."
There are rumors of a block trade of 5.4 Million Shares @$32.75 via Morgan Stanley
The current momentum should get goosed after the conference call next week. In addition I believe that NFE will hit $50 a share by summertime (IMHO).
Confirmed - Stonepeak sold to raise money for TGP acquisition. Expected and will be interesting to see who bought the 5.4mm shares

"One needs to walk before they can run. Coal supplies over one-third of global electricity generation and plays a crucial role in industries such as iron and steel. It is not going away quickly. Natural gas is the best bridge fuel that can materially reduce the use of coal. What some idealists don't understand is that all forms of energy have drawbacks but we need energy to live. Uranium is a great choice but . oh no. there can be an accident. yet so many are dying from pollution. Natural gas and LNG are great choices, but they still can pollute, though much less than oil or coal. Solar! All hail solar! but there is much pollution to create the necessary hardware, and that hardware needs constant maintenance and updates. Wind, it's ok if you don't mind slaughtering birds. There are few perfect solutions in life but I am investing here not only to make money, but I sincerely believe in this company's vision. I suspect I will be a shareholder for many years to come. Not sure what prompted that outburst...."
"If you are worried about NFE being short natural gas or are short the stock I advise you to reread the companies July 21st presentation, slide 30-31....https://ir.newfortressenergy.com/static-files/ac44cb10-b4dd-4e6c-8460-7c7728030223"
big volume at the opening so very likely to be a typical short seller attack. Game on. I reckon that the price will slowly start to recover later today after their position is completed. Nothing but great things to come with this company. No bad news whatsoever so whatever pressure we see now will not be sustainable. Stay strong all

"It is my opinion that NFE is still way oversold and will not come close to its proper valuation until it passes $50. However if that takes more than 2- 3 years then the proper valuation may be much higher. It is not enough to find great investments, many can. But holding is the hard part (IMHO)."
Looks like alot of support in 18 ..20 area?Chart is hard to read..so technical s are difficult
"The extra $200M now expected for Q4 owing to NFE being long on LNG cargoes, which it is selling in the market place, is roughly $1/sh. Share price responded $6/sh. Why?Because the fear was that they were actually significantly short LNG cargoes to meet their needs, and that a market place purchase would have cost them dearly. That's how I see the apparent disproportionate share response"

"I wonder how much the high LNG pricing is affecting NFE operations today? are they insulated wholly with existing secured supply? Is there a drag on expansion opps? There seems to be too little LNG to meet current demand - their plan for Fast LNG seems well timed, but is it advancing?"
"BERLIN, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Germany must invest in an expansion of renewable energies and will also need to build new gas power stations to guarantee energy security as it is planning to phase out nuclear and coal power plants, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Wednesday.""If you're exiting, you're also having to enter somewhere else,"" Scholz told a conference organised by the IG BCE labour union, adding that Germany needed gas as an energy source during the transition to a carbon-neutral economy.Germany is not the only country ramping up NG and LNG.
