"some coverage from Stifel on the new award today:_____This morning New Fortress announced two new gas supply agreements (GSA) with Brazilian chemical and fertilizer company Unigel Participações totaling up to 1.4 million gallons per day for five years starting in 1Q 2022. As discussed in their latest presentation, NFE sees Brazil as a large opportunity for them because of their lack of gas supply. The Unigel Fertilizer Plant will now have the capacity to produce 3,000 tons per day in Urea with this new stable supply from NFE. With the shortages of both gas and power in Brazil, NFE's expansion into Brazil could result in a total opportunity north of $750m of EBITDA as gas buyers scramble for new options. This aligns nicely with NFE's goal in Brazil for replacing declining and high-priced gas supply. This contract is likely not the only one for the quarter in our view. Key Points • On the clock for 1Q22 startup. Starting new projects on time has been a challenge for New Fortress. As a result, we had previously shifted back our assumed timeline for each new project by at least six months relative to management expectations. That said, while NFE has the Sergipe facility fully up and running, there are three new terminals which the company believes to commence operations in 1Q22 (Barcarena - January, Santa Catarina - March, Suape - 1Q). These two contracts which have a five-year term, will draw gas from 1) the Sergipe facility which should be a lay up given the infrastructure is already in place with ample excess capacity on the FSRU, and 2) Suape import terminal will likely move the gas to the TAG pipeline and then deliver the gas to the facility in the town of Camaçari just north of Salvador in the southern state of Bahai. Both facilities appear to already have gas access, so NFE is simply enhancing/replacing existing volumes. Given the recent law changes that allowed more competition with Petrobras, and given the large volumes, the contract was likely won with lower gas sale margins relative to other NFE projects, although absolute dollars should be large given the contract size. The challenge for the Suape terminal is infrastructure. While Sergipe has an FSRU on site (which incidentally becomes significantly more valuable with greater throughput), Suape is basically starting from scratch some regasification infrastructure is likely needed. Perhaps this could be accomplished using the Golar Spirit which was acquired through the GMLP acquisition and is currently idle, but it would likely need an extensive overhaul after years of inactivity. Also worth noting, the agreement also includes an option to supply a chemical facility in Candeias which is immediately adjacent to Camaçari and should be and easy bolt on. • Rent to own. While the contracts are only five years in duration, we expect in all likelihood, they are forever agreements because outside massive growth in domestic gas production in the Bahia and Sergipe regions, the possibility of a secondary gas source materializing is extremely remote. This means that with anchor tenants, NFE can start marketing smaller volumes of gas within these regions increasing throughput and operating margin. •Implications. NFE indicated that this contract was in the works during the recent earnings call. This announcement puts meat on the bone which we believe is important as investors have been growing increasingly impatient for promised growth to materialize. By no means is the work on delivering on the potential complete, but we feel this is an important step in the right direction and gives some clue as to the immense opportunity Brazil is for the growth of New Fortress and the upside potential in NFE shares. Incidentally, strength in NFE shares should also correlate to strength in GLNG (Buy, $10.85) shares as well thanks to their 18.6 million share ownership. Back of the envelope, every 10% move in NFE shares should translate into about a 5% move in GLNG shares."
There is no reason to lose money on this stock. This company will be earning a ton of money within the next 2 - 3 years and its stock price will reflect this. This is what patience and conviction are all about.

"July 6, 2021 at 6:55 PM EDTNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 6, 2021-- New Fortress Energy Inc. (NASDAQ: NFE) (“NFE”) announced today that it has reached an agreement for liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply that will cover the remaining volumes for NFE’s existing natural gas and electricity businesses through the end of 2027.“This transaction secures our LNG supply for the next several years across our existing portfolio of terminals and customers,” said Wes Edens, Chairman and CEO of NFE. “With commercial operations expected to begin within days in Mexico and next month in Nicaragua, this will ensure we provide our customers a reliable and affordable supply of cleaner energy. We will look to secure additional volumes later this year ahead of commencing our Brazil operations and as we continue to grow our customer base across all our terminals.”With this gas supply in place, NFE will have purchased LNG volumes equal to approximately 100% of its expected needs for its current portfolio of five terminals and assets across the Caribbean, Mexico and Central America for the next six years. The Company anticipates securing additional LNG supply volumes later in 2021 to support NFE’s four terminals in Brazil, which are all expected to be operational in 2022.“We executed our strategy to neutralize LNG exposure by securing LNG supply contracts that meet our downstream needs,” said Kasciandro Senem, LNG Managing Director of NFE. “Our next step is to extend this strategy to our Brazilian terminals. This work is well under way and will be executed in coordination with NFE’s downstream developments in the country.”"

"Bullish Stifel turns more cautious on NFE after its two recent operational updates...——- Price $35.21 (close 7/8/21) FLASH NOTE Summary New Fortress Energy LLC NFE – NASDAQ July 8, 2021 Energy Infrastructure Sri Lanka Getting Gassy NFE announced a Framework Agreement with the Government of Sri Lanka. The deal will eventually allow NFE to build a floating LNG regas facility near Colombo. The FSRU will be used to power a 300 MW power plant which has the potential to grow to 1 GW by 2025. The 300 MW project should be able to generate ~$30-$50 million of EBITDA at a ~$3-4/mmbtu margin. That would be closer to ~$150+ million for the full 1 GW. It is good to see the company making progress in additional geographies, although timing and firmness of the contract leave a lot to be desired. In addition, with LNG prices moving up dramatically, the cost of importing LNG has moved up on an absolute and relative basis. It is still cheaper than oil, but not by much. There is still plenty of wood to chop, but this is a good step. Key Points Sri Lanka. Based on our own estimates, we expect that a 1 GW power plant would need ~1,500k gallons/day of LNG. At a $3-4/mmbtu margin, that would generate $150 million of incremental EBITDA. The capex to build out the import terminal is likely around $20-$60 million. The expansion of the power plant is likely $500+ million. The 300 MW power plant will need ~0.3 mtpa of LNG and a 1 GW power plant will need ~1 mtpa of LNG. Sourcing that could entirely be from NFE's Fast LNG platform, although there has not been an update in terms of finding a location to procure the gas. The terminal timing is unknown and the Framework Agreement is far from an FID, particularly given the company's track record with potential new geographies that never materialize. However, this is at least a good first step towards growing in South East Asia. Locked in LNG Capacity. This week, NFE announced that they entered into an agreement for all the capacity they need for their 5 terminals not in Brazil (Montego Bay, Old Harbour, Puerto Rico, Baja, Mexico, and Nicaragua). The ~2 mtpa agreement is through 2027. Locked in at today's LNG environment had to be more expensive than last year. As a result, we expect that the total cost will be Henry Hub + 115% + a $2-2.50/mmbtu toll. While most of the downstream assets have floating prices, that toll would have been ~$0.50/mmbtu less last year, which definitely hurts margins, but is not existentially bad for the business. The Fast LNG platform should be able to source 1.4 mtpa of capacity when it's up and running; however, that is at least 15 months away. Given the lack of information on the source of the feed gas, we expect like most other projects, doubling the time line is likely more realistic. Stock falling off. With the cost of LNG moving up, it is likely harder to sell LNG profitably, although it is not impossible as evidenced by this announcement (even it if it's not a firm order). With effectively all the company's gas spreads pre-sold, there is very limited commodity price risk, but we do expect new project development is likely more difficult and protracted. In combination with a delayed start-up of new projects and slow progress on growth initiatives, it is not surprising to see shares weakening. This announcement should help, but we expect there is likely to be some well deserved reservations until the cash flows start flowing."

"To make money on Wall Street you need patience and conviction. Personally, I will not sell NFE even if it drops to $25. I would try to come up with a way to buy more shares. Eventually the institutional shorts will exhaust the selling by retail investors. They have to be close to a bottom by now. When they start to buy it will be fast and furious, before most retail investors can move. I would not be surprised to see NFE move up 8% one day this week. The stock price may or may not need to stabilize first (IMHO)."

"I see in their PPT from yesterday, that they address the question of share valuation, at 2023 expected base case revenue (there of course is the ""show-me"" aspect to that projection)Bottom line - they view a range of valuation of $82 to my $120/sh, measured off of 2023 revenues.Of course their view is positive. The question is whether their revenues and margin assumptions for 2023 are reasonable. And, the followup is what their subsequent growth prospects are, since those dictate the multiple to apply to the 2023 income.Even if they meet 2023 targets, if their prospects beyond dim, then a multiple closer to 5 to 10x, rather than 15 to 20x would be more reasonable. The current share price reflects the latter, and considerable street pessimism.

"Barclays View (after Q1 earning, $45 target; Credit Suisse has $50 Target)_____New Fortress Energy Inc. 1Q takeaways NFE shares reacted positively to its 1Q business update (+3.6% vs. AMNA +0.9%), which we attribute to the company’s announcement of Zero Parks, a JV with FTAI that intends to FID two projects related to renewable fuels/hydrogen in the next 90-120 days. Operationally, 1Q results came in below our Street-low estimate on higher gas costs, which we had highlighted in our 1Q Preview. 4/20/21 where we assessed consensus was not fully factoring in the impact of legacy Centrica cargoes scheduled for delivery in 2021. Nonetheless, we view elevated gas costs as a transitory phenomenon as legacy Centrica cargoes subside, and think NFE’s 1Q update related to its existing business (maintaining committed run-rate guidance) combined with upside optionality with the announcement of Zero Parks screened positively for investors. NFE also indicated that it is close to executing asset sales of Jamalco and Nanook, expecting to generate proceeds of $600-$900mm. Zero Parks offers near-term optionality related to clean energy projects. In conjunction with 1Q results, NFE announced that it had signed an LOI for the formation of a JV (“Zero Parks”) with the intention of announcing FID on two $200-$300mm projects related to renewable fuels and hydrogen in the next 90-120 days. While NFE’s existing Zero program already offered optionality as it related to hydrogen, the strategy outlined by Zero Parks suggests more of an explicit, nearer-term impact (albeit ~24- month development time) at attractive economics (generating annual EBITDA of $50- $75mm). Exact financial details of the JV and projects are yet to be worked out, but NFE estimates a 75/25 equity split between NFE/FTAI with a longer-term plan of separating the entity as a standalone public company (in which NFE owners would receive shares in the separated entity). On its call, NFE indicated that it plans to utilize FTAI’s existing terminal facility in Jefferson, TX, envisioning one project that produces renewable diesel/jet fuel and another producing carbon-free hydrogen and ammonia. Next steps pricing mechanisms intended to mitigate price risk, but in interim, we think the announcement today marks a positive tangible development as NFE pursues ..."

A spokesperson said the deal was s six-figure one, with further details undisclosed.As for New Fortress Energy, assuming the company is indeed the said ADC Energy client, the company is developing a modular floating liquefaction facility to provide a low-cost supply of liquefied natural gas for its growing customer base. The company has said that the “Fast LNG” design pairs advancements in modular, midsize liquefaction technology with jack-up rigs or similar floating infrastructure to enable a much lower cost and faster deployment schedule than today’s floating liquefaction vessels. According to New Fortress Energy, a permanently moored FSU will serve as an LNG storage facility alongside the floating liquefaction - and presumably jack-up - infrastructure, which can be deployed anywhere where there's enough gas.Hydrogen rigsWorth noting, jack-up drilling rigs, normally used for drilling for oil and gas in shallow waters, are, apart from this LNG conversion project, being looked at as an option for the production of green hydrogen, too."

"Finally, we are heading north. lol"
"New Fortress Energy, a US natural gas company, has relaunched a bid to build a terminal for gas imports at Shannon Ireland, despite the Irish government's decision not to allow US fracked gas into the country.The gas firm says it is transitioning to hydrogen in the next ten years, and has also promised to site a data center campus at the terminal, which can make use of the massive amount of cooling created when liquefied natural gas is evaporated before piping around the country. The company has been allowed to submit a new proposal for its #$%$650 million ($780m) terminal to An Bord Plean�la, the Irish planning authority.shannon LNG terminal new fortress energy.jpgNew Fortress Energy's proposed terminal? New Fortress EnergyHydrogen tomorrow, fracked gas todayNew Fortress was set up in 2014 by Wes Edens, a former managing director at Lehman Brothers and BlackRock. Edens says it will be one of the world's leading producers of carbon-free energy and a net-zero emissions company within ten years. It has built a $1 billion floating LNG terminal in Jamaica's Old Harbour Bay.The company ships fracked fossil natural gas from the US, but claims this is ""cleaner"" than other fuels such as coal or oil, and has made promises to transition to hydrogen in future: ""Today, we modernize energy and power infrastructure in emerging countries, supplying a more affordable, cleaner fuel - natural gas,"" says its website. ""Tomorrow, we aim to provide zero-carbon energy in the form of green hydrogen.""New Fortress had a previous application to build the Shannon terminal thrown out by the Irish High Court in 2020, after complaints by environmental campaigners, including Friends of the Irish Environment (FIE).Since then, Ireland's Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan has spoken against fracked gas, saying ?it would not be appropriate to permit or proceed with development of any LNG terminals in Ireland, including the Shannon LNG project,? according to the Irish Times. Ryan is going to review the security of Ireland's energy supply and whether natural gas is needed. However, the Irish Government does not have the authority for a legal ban on fracked gas, according to the Times.The new application, sited on a 600-acre site in County Kerry, would hold a 600MW power plant as well as the LNG terminal, flies in the face of Ryan's statement says FIE director Tony Lowes: ?If permitting an applicant to apply for a #$%$500 million fossil fuel terminal is not ?proceeding? then I don?t know what is,? FIE Director Tony Lowes said to the Irish Times.Speaking in favor of the project, Sam Abdalla, New Fortress's vice president of project development said: ?This first phase of development ? the #$%$650 million power plant and terminal ? will create 270 construction jobs over a three-year construction period with 70 long-term jobs, once operational.?He also promised more jobs from the on-site data center campus: ?The development would occupy 100 acres of the 600-acre site and the site masterplan anticipates a follow-on development for a major data center campus with up to eight data halls which would create up to 400 additional long-term jobs.""LNG terminals have been proposed for data centers sites for some time, as they provide a very large source of natural cooling, when liquified natural gas at -160C is regasified. The idea has yet to be delivered in practice, although Singapore is furthest advanced in plans for data centers at LNG terminals. Among the possible objections are the fact that LNG terminals are sites of potential fire risk, and (because of that risk) are normally sited away from population centers.Abdalla repeated New Fortress's promise that it would wean itself off fracked gas onto hydrogen in future."

NFE is building out the infrastructure to be one of the largest LNG suppliers in the world at a time when the need for LNG is rapidly growing. Its' infrastructure will support liquid hydrogen when its time comes. It is clear when you look where this company's operations will be in 3 years that this company's stock is worth much more then its current stock price. More than that this company will continue to grow at a good clip for at least the next 10 years. The amazing part of Wall Street is that the answers are right there for those who invest with a longer term vision and don't play the game like they are betting in Vegas. Just my 2 cents...

"These are the kinds of things going on at NFE. Management is aggressive but savvy. RIO DE JANEIRO, May 17 (Reuters) - Maersk Drilling sold two oil drilling rigs to U.S.-based energy infrastructure company New Fortress Energy Inc (NFE) which it will convert into floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities, the companies said on Monday.Maersk sold the jack-up drilling rig Maersk Guardian to NFE and the two companies have agreed to the sale of the Maersk Gallant rig for closing in June for a total price of $31 million for both, Maersk said in a statement.A NFE spokesman confirmed in a separate email that the purchases are part of the company's strategy to expand into the burgeoning global LNG market by using existing infrastructure to save on costs.During a May 7 earnings call, NFE Chief Executive Officer Wesley Edens noted that a typical floating LNG facility can cost more than $4 billion and take up to five years to build while converting these jackup rigs can be done at a total cost of $500 million.The rigs will be converted by July 2022 and start production by the end of next year, NFE said then.Global demand for LNG, which can be transported by ship, has been rising and is expected to nearly double from current levels by 2040"

"Published date: 16 September 2021Share:Brazilian natural gas companies are expanding small-scale LNG distribution in the face of persistent obstacles to accessing pipelines dominated by state-owned Petrobras.""Small-gas LNG distribution is on our radar screen and is an important step to increasing the market,"" the new business director of LNG-to-power company Gas Natural Acu (GNA) Carolina Lachmann said in a webinar. GNA operates Brazil's second independent LNG regasification terminal and is eyeing the country's burgeoning wholesale market.Although the company is working on connecting its terminal to the pipeline network, it has been hamstrung by a lack of transparency regarding transport costs.""It is important to connect to the gas transport network,"" she said, adding that GNA is now working to supply LNG to clients that lack pipeline access.Industrial gas company White Martins, whose subsidiary Gemini GasLocal operates a liquefaction terminal in Paulinia, Sao Paulo state, sees significant potential for the expansion of small-scale LNG distribution. White Martins recently purchased Petrobras' 40pc stake in Gemini following an anti-trust investigation.""We have very strong industrial demand,"" hydrogen and LNG director of White Martins Guilherme Ricci said, adding that industries without pipeline access see LNG as a viable option.Other companies also see the potential for this market. LNG company New Fortress Energy is in the final stages of commissioning its regasification terminal is Petrolina, located 750km (466mi) from the coast in central Pernambuco state, where it will supply up to 40,000 m³/d of regasified LNG. The LNG is transported by truck in ISO containers to Petrolina, where it will be distributed by local gas company Copergas. A similar project will begin operating shortly in neighboring Garanhuns.New Fortress also has a supply contract of 150,000m³/d with Santa Catarina gas distributor SCGas to deliver LNG by truck from its regasification terminal that is under construction."

"Perhaps the jump today is because Barclay's put out a piece that has cut their view to $31 (down from $38), but with language that may have soothed markets a bit...------from Barclays report of 3 OctWhat does this mean for the stock? As mentioned above, sentiment right now is focused on prospective downside scenarios if NFE were to have to procure cargoes in the spot market, such that we think concerns related to 2022 short exposure are overdone. That being said, NFE has historically traded on run-rate economics and we don’t necessarily see that changing, such that we think it’s important to view recent short-term events in the context of its run-rate outlook. On that, we assess NFE’s outlook remains largely intact with perhaps some modest degradation as a result of higher potential liquefaction fees on open cargoes vs. NFE’s assumption of $2.50/mmbtu. We also acknowledge that recent events highlight the flexibility of contractual requirements (i.e. take or pay vs. exclusivity of supply) across NFE’s portfolio, which is positive in the context of NFE’s short supply position in 2022, but also highlights potential variability (risks) to run-rate committed volumes if higher Henry Hub prices potentially inhibit the economic arbitrage of gas vs. other feedstocks. In that same vein, investors have increasingly become focused on quarterly execution in order to inform their conviction level in the company’s ability to sustainably achieve the run-rate economics it has laid out, and we think recent events could highlight the inherent risk in NFE’s business model . With this in mind, we think successful execution on NFE’s Fast LNG concept has the potential to be a key catalyst for the stock given the ability to provide visibility for fixed-cost LNG supply. Next steps for the Fast LNG concept include finding a solution for gas sourcing, which the company expected to complete in the next 60-90 days as of its 8/5/21 earnings call, although our sense is that timing for this could slip. NFE’s target economics assume Fast LNG secures feedgas supply at $1-$3/mmbtu, but in the current environment of robust global gas prices, we think there could be risk to that range and/or potential timing delays with producers reluctant to commit to low prices in the current market. We revise our price target to $31 (from $38) based on 12x (13.25x previously, with revision reflecting increased risk related to NFE’s short gas position amid current commodity backdrop) our 2025e EBITDA estimate of ~$1.0bn (vs. ~$1.1bn previously), discounted back three years."

"One needs to walk before they can run. Coal supplies over one-third of global electricity generation and plays a crucial role in industries such as iron and steel. It is not going away quickly.

Uranium is a great choice but . oh no. there can be an accident. yet so many are dying from pollution. Natural gas and LNG are great choices, but they still can pollute, though much less than oil or coal. Solar! All hail solar! but there is much pollution to create the necessary hardware, and that hardware needs constant maintenance and updates. Wind, it's ok if you don't mind slaughtering birds.

I called IR and no one answered or returned my call. I wanted to find out if they have any plans to eventually pay a dividend. I also wanted to know if they are a 1099 or a K1. I would be very cautious for now because they have ambitious growth plans that will require a lot of money. Most growth companies need high stock prices so they can sell stock and debt at a 50/50 rate. Hopefully they can pay a dividend even if it is small just to create interest. I think their idea is a sound one of selling LNG to power plants where they use oil now to produce electricity. I want more information before I invest.

"Credit Suisse 9 July view after the initial Sri Lanka MOU:----Research Bulletin New Fortress Energy (NFE.OQ) Entrance To The East NFE announced a Framework Agreement with the Government of Sri Lanka last night. Here are our initial thoughts on the announcement. Largely Expected; Timing Consistent. Management had been guiding to a potential Asian customer since mid 2020; making the announcement itself widely expected. While the timing of a deal slipped, more recent projections pointed to a mid 2022 startup which is largely in line with the press release's 2H22 timeline for commencement. Under the Framework Agreement announced last night, NFE will construct a new offshore LNG import terminal to supply gas for power. NFE will also acquire a 40% share in a 300MW power plant. Volume Guidance Implies Rapid Growth. NFE's volume guidance (which remained unchanged with this update) implies 300MW growing to ~600MW in mid 2022. Based on prior disclosures, 300MW requires ~750mm gpd; NFE guided to the Asia project requiring over 1.2mm gpd which indicates power plant expansion. The press release pointed to growing to >1,000 MW by 2025. Its unclear if NFE will participate in funding the power build-out. Capex Should be Less than $500mm Initially. We estimate the 40% power plant purchase and the terminal build out to be less than $300mm of capex. To the extent NFE participates in power plant growth (to 600MW), capex could increase closer to $500mm. We expect margins on this terminal to be consistent with legacy NFE margins (>$4.00/mmbtu); which implies a return multiple between 3.0-3.5x. Pushback. We'd expect some pushback on the lack of a firmer agreement. The Framework Agreement creates a pathway to a formal gas import deal; we suspect investors expected slightly more progress. Nonetheless, the critical pieces appear to be materializing. Importantly, NFE will need to address supply for this terminal as well. For now, its unclear if NFE will procure a Henry Hub indexed supply source or supply the facility with FLNG. Strategically, the deal is important in that it provides NFE with its first footprint in Asia which can lead to growth in other countries once NFE establishes itself in the region."

It will be interesting to see what news they have at the meeting tomorrow.
Wonder if management is over or under selling the company … A lot of capacity is neither confirmed or likely … Either they are building oversized capacity or have a long term plan ? Any views ?
Bought more 2day at $30.60..Avg price now $34s..Have enough funds left for one more buy
"Another good news, another down day or what????? Will we see any upside???"
