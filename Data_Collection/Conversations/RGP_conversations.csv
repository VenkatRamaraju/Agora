"Volume pre-market on 8/27 = 1 share obviously trying to make the price appear to be down so market maker manipulators can help hedge funds, shorts, and option traders steal more shares from retail investors by stealing equity by selling thousands of naked short shares and never buying them back per wall street rules."
"Here we go again, drive the price downward all day with naked short shares, then sneaky buy them back at the same price out to a .0001 part of a dollar after hours."
"The old rules of chart reading indicate prices will tend to fill in the gaps, which means the price needs to go up to 15.80 to fill in two gaps."
"Yesterday, yahoo reported the close was 15.84. This morning, it claims the close was 15.70. Seems there is some gross manipulation of the price at closing that ordinary investors were not privy to."
"On the CBOE, just a 1000 buys gets us over $16"
Stock price should be at $18/share but for the criminals on wall street.
"Price gapped down today and by the old fundamental chart rules, a price normally goes back to fill the gap. The new rules are that the price goes wherever the market maker manipulators want a price to go by them using a computer generated algorithm and selling naked short shares"
"wall street manipulators, shorts, option traders and hedge funds sell all day in NY, then buy back on the TASE so they can hide profits offshore and evade US income taxes."

"Resources Connection says its fourth quarter big earnings estimate beat results were driven by 'pent-up client demand from the COVID-19 pandemic.' Well, LO and behold, we now have a Delta varient covid pandemic in full swing. Looks like there is a great chance, rgp will have another huge earnings beat this quarter or next as more get vaccinated."
Old chart reading rules say we have a BIG cup and handle indicating going up big.

"manipulators drop the stock price like a rock but go up by millimeters or 79 shares at a time. Gee, I wonder why brokers have to advertise and seek retail investors to help manipulators, shorts, option traders and hedge funds milk newbees."
next gap closed at 15.81
I would expect we're going higher based on today's announced quarterly results.
"625,000 shares of stock shorted"
