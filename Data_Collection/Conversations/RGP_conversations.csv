"I am sure glad there is no fraud nor manipulation by market maker manipulators helping steal money from honest retail investors to give to hedge funds and sellers of naked short shares and options traders because they are all too stupid to trade honestly and simply need a LOT of help from manipulators like for instance, yesterday there were 138K volume all day but right after close, there were another 96K volume to drive the price down.
