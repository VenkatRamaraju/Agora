"Earnings date approaching. Should be a good Q I think. FTA approval still in progress tho.. From what I undestrand, they are only shipping tests outside US."
"From the milestones in the chart below, BMRA's test looks like in Phase 2. It may take months to receive EUA. But they need to understand they will lose money if they develop the test at the speed of developing the vaccine. They cannot make money on ""Made in USA"" or ""Environmental friendly"". People need the ACCURATE test. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/apdn/community?p=apdn#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%3D%3D"
"I wouldn't panic like all the hasty sellers, folks..we know that there are a couple of likely upcoming positive announcements... So you have to wonder about the timing of the Offering filing.... If I was a savvy CEO and wanted to maximize the price I would get on a new offering, I would file for the offering just before some SP-bumping announcements...juz saying what I would do "
Do anyone know why BMRA all the sudden have dropped a lot?
Something wrong with the test kits.. production likely delayed
Chart says $10+ possibly $12 in 30 days... Event coming up maybe?

"FOR THOSE THAT PAID UP TO A 900% PREMIUM BUYING INTO THE OUTRAGEOUSLY BOGUS PR CLAIMING THEY'RE SENDING OUT TEST KITS ABROAD WITHOUT EVER ANNOUNCING THEY'RE WORKING ON A TEST FOR COVID-19, HERE'S CEO ZACHARY S IRANI'S ADDRESS SO YOU CAN ASK HIM HOW THAT'S POSSIBLE IN PERSON: Biomerica, Inc., 17571 Von Karman Avenue, Irvine, CA 92614https://www.sec.gov/whistleblower/submit-a-tip"
"Has anyone paid attention to this part of their 10-Q? Focus on March 20. On March 17, 2020, the Company announced it had commenced shipping initial samples of its COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test (qualitative membrane-based immunoassay for the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in whole blood or serum) to countries outside the US for evaluation. The test is a finger prick blood test that the Company expects will show results in approximately 10 minutes and can be performed by trained professionals at any location, including airports, schools, work, pharmacies and doctors’ offices. The evaluation test kits have been requested by Ministries of Health in multiple countries through our distribution partners who are working with their government agencies to assess the tests and forecast demand. In addition, the Company has begun the application process with the FDA under the COVID-19 Emergency Use Authorization aimed at the possible clearance and eventual use of the test in the US. On March 20, 2020, the Company filed a prospectus supplement to the base prospectus dated July 20, 2017 for purposes of raising up to $12,500,000 from time to time pursuant to the terms of the At Market Issuance Agreement. The Company has no obligation to sell any of the Placement Shares under the At Market Issuance Sales Agreement, and may at any time suspend offers under the At Market Issuance Sales Agreement or terminate the At Market Issuance Sales Agreement. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, sales and marketing activities, clinical studies and product development, making acquisitions of assets, businesses, companies or securities, capital expenditures, and for working capital needs. Subsequent to February 29, 2020 and through April 14, 2020, the Company sold 716,335 shares of common stock through the At Market Issuance Sales Agreement. Net proceeds to the Company were approximately $5,391,000.---------SO, I HATE TO SAY I WAS WRONG, BUT I'M A BIG ENOUGH MAN TO ADMIT IT. ""Subsequent to Feb. 29"" and ""through April 14"" includes from 3/17 to 3/20, the big pop. This to me does in fact look like a pump and dump. And play close attention to the description on the FDA site of the ""device"" registration. The ""Device"" was given a ""proprietary name"" that refers to Covid 19. So, what it seems to me that we have here is a company that shipped just the literal plastic box. Nothing in the box to test for Covid 19. You could put thelabel ""generic serology test kit"" or ""SARS test kit"" or whatever you want to call it as the ""propreitary name.""And why would you license from Mt. Sinai AFTER you supposedly shipped it already back in March? I am not happy."
Seems like a bunch of HYPE to move the stock (AGAIN). They have been talking this game since last year when the stock was halted. It jumped to $20 immediatley got halted and then dumped. So I wouldn't put too much into it now just because they came out with a tidbit of info. The emergency EUA from last summer never materialized. Emergency means right away.
"I think guys, there is preference towards big companies in approving these tests. Its understandable that they can scale up production a lot as well."
"I bought in on the Run up this morning! I saw the news and 52wk high , Plus the Low Float, I was expecting the Share Price to go higher but after the Halt it went down. Any thoughts on this I'm new to BMRA , Shouldn't this continue up with the Test kit orders and good news?"
SEC WILL BE IN THE TOP OF THE COMPANY!!!!!
A promising sign for bulls-- today (Wednesday 6/24) BMRA jumped 10% and 2% in AH trading on NO news and while the entire broad market was in red. Imagine when the FDA EUA approval is announced-- BMRA could gap up 50%.
A healthy pullback after such a great run. We shall march higher.

"Biomerica lost plastic supplier from India, and they start making these tests without plastics, that's all it is about. CE mark means that they can sell these tests without a plastic frame. Nothing has changed. LoL"
its now or never for bmra after the news about abbott's test. I hope that FDA will speed up with the approvals especially for tests that are US made.

"I would like an answer to 2 simple questions, and not from ""Vicki"" et al.(1) Why is there no press release on their website about having filed a pre-EUA / application for the test kit?(2) Has there in fact been an application / pre-EUA or whatever you call it submitted to the FDA for the test kit?(Thelonius, you replied to me a week ago that they were ""working on an application"" for a ""lab kit,"" but not the rapid test kit -- Are you an employee, or how do you know that, and do you mean that there is no application for the rapid test?)"

"Is bmra buying test-kit from Hong Kong based Zhejiang Orient Gene Biotech Co., Ltd, anyone knows?"

"The SEC S3 shelf re-filling changed the momentum. Biomerica is required to re-file SEC Form S3 every three years (the last shelf was done in 2017). This time Biomerica decided to increase its potential new stock offering from $45 million to $90 million ($45 was sitting there unused) and to pay off Palm Global (for its private placement from February 2020) with $6 million. That additional $45 new stock offering was a mistake, even though management claims there are no plans to use it any time soon. The market is now ""punishing"" BMRA stock.I am still bullish and holding my shares. BMRA is waiting for the FDA EUA and EU CE Mark approvals for its ELISA Lab-based serological Covid-19 test, which was submitted to the FDA on June 16th. Biomerca also submitted different rapid finger type serological Covid-19 tests to the FDA in April, and all of these rapid types of Covid-19 tests made by many different companies were tabled by the FDA for additional scrutiny. However, Biomerica received CE Mark approval in Europe in May and has been selling its rapid (1o minute) Covid-19 test all over the world. We are also waiting for the 2nd Q ER, which I expect to be positive. Finally, BMRA submitted to the FDA application for its revolutionary IBS In Foods test, which is a long term prospect but it has huge future market potential."

"With two subsidiaries in Mexico and Europe, Biomerica, Inc. is an entity incorporated in Delaware. The company manufactures and develops products, which help detect chronic diseases.In my opinion, the information released on June 16, 2020 about the development of a new test for COVID-19 made the share price creep up.I would actually expect additional share price increases because the company could receive the CE mark to sell the test outside the United States.The upside potential is massive on this name. With a share count of 11.31 million and 2.5% of the COVID-19 market, I would say that the share price could go to $25-$30.I am not really worried about the company’s total liabilities because the asset/liability ratio is equal to 2.3x.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4357567-biomericas-covidminus-19-test-ignites-market?mail_subject=bmra-biomerica-s-covid-19-test-ignite-the-market&utm_campaign=rta-stock-article&utm_content=link-2&utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha"
LOL 20 CENTS up hahaha. I should have sell it in PM.
"Yesterday (9/3) I bought more BMRA shares at $5.95 thinking it was the bottom. I was wrong. Today (9/4) I bought again even more BMRA shares at $5.55 believing it is the bottom. We will see?I am Biomerican. I believe BMRA will bounce back, so I am doing now ""stupid"" things-- averaging down. If I have to place blame, I take full responsibility here, but I also blame BOD. I cannot blame BMRA BOD for the FDA inaction or for the recent price drop when the entire broad markets are declining. But I can blame BOD for (a) poor PR communications, (b) for refilling the S3 shelf for an additional $45 million in the middle of the price uptrend, and (c) bringing in Palm Global hedge fund into the ownership structure with ""observer"" privileges, which most likely brought the recent SEC insiders' trading data inquiries.In short, I am holding, bullish, and accumulating, but I am not happy with the BOD."
Steady rise. I like it.
All the gains from yesterday wiped out. Is biomerica faking their Covid test stunt.Common BMRA give us some news on the development.
The market has been up up the last 5 days but BMRA has been going down? Is everyone bailing out?
Should arrive to 18
"Back in March this year, BMRA jumped over 1,000% in 2 trading days. Don't tell me it ain't gonna happen this time. Patience and positivity."
Any idea when the FDA will make a decision
why is Bmra dropping every day if they are fore filling order for test kits
"Typical short seller BS. Trying to crush the stock on good news, and hoping nobody will notice.208% rise in revenues.More important, InFoods appears to be on schedule. Will have news before year end. That's worth a minimum of $1bn if it works.Call it a one-in-three chance to make 20x your money. You're supposed to take that bet."
Time to sell... but AYTU teethe test is far superior and headed to US
"After the initial shock, I checked the internet and discovered that Biomerica filled with SEC today Form S-3 (7/20) “shelf” registration for 571,429 shares of BMRA common stock for total aggregate offering of $90 million ($10.83 per share). They used a term ""up to"", so Biomerica might not offer all of its 571,429 new shares. Good news-- Biomerica needs more capital for its expanding business. Bad news-- we are diluting shares, we have larger float now. Overall-- in my opinion, market overreacted today. TSLA did the same thing and price went up (I guess TSLA is not BMRA). But, I am not selling my shares. I am waiting for the FDA EUA news. Biomerica fundamentals remain the same. I am waiting for a pop tomorrow- we should recover some ground. Tomorrow will be an interesting day."
"Has anyone seen picture of bmra's covid-19 test-kit, can someone share?This one is aytu's I believehttps://corrierequotidiano.it/salute/covid-19-arriva-in-italia-il-test-per-la-diagnosi-in-pochi-minuti-prime-consegne-nelle-marche/"
Somebody buying lots of shares and dumping after it went up by 20 cents. Same process wash and rinse. The big short traders for sure. Lucky if the price will go up again
"Do you want to see a short squeeze in action? Take a look at the BMRA price action today. BMRA is up 20% so far today and we still have40 minutes left in trading. The low was $5.50 and it went up to $7.09. The only news on BMRA today was the upgrade from Aegis Capital, which adjusted BMRA target price from $10 to $13. It was reported at 11:24 am."
I jumped ship. Took my 500 dollar loss and what I had left in EROS. Good luck to the rest

"All, I want you to know that somehow my posts of positivity here on Biomerica keeps getting removed, for a few days now. I have attempted two times to add positive comments to my post that began “alright insiders...”. Therefore I am creating this separate note and here it goes. On the daily address the nation Dr Birx has made it very clear that the serology tests are the most critical tests to define those that have had the illness, have developed antibodies, and transmit the virus without knowing. Though the discussion did not state the company name behind the leading technology the call hinted that they expect the product to hit the market in the next two weeks. Today, Dr Birx made it known that there are two parts to the test and it is critical that both parts are ready to go before it will be authorized. Here’s my take, knowing human nature and the way things are misunderstood or misinterpreted by some the cdc will not release a test that informs an individual they have had the coronavirus and have developed antibodies to it unless the test also defines whether or not they spread the contagion. I can only hope Biomerica is critical to the resolution."
"Time to short!!!!""Biomerica is positioned to begin filling large international orders of this disposable one-use tests within weeks, assuming international product shipping channels remain open and active."""

"WERE THEY LYING THEN, OR ARE THEY LYING NOW?THEY SAID THEY OBTAINED THE CE MARK ON MAY 7, 2020. EIGHT(8) MONTHS AGO. SO HOW CAN THEY BE MAKING THE SAME EXACT ANNOUNCEMENT AGAIN ON JANUARY 12, 2021?Look at the press releases on their website, dated May 7, 2020 and January 12, 2021. Both of them say the exact same thing: Biomerica "" today announced it has received a CE mark . . . "" Neither of them says that they ""today received"" a CE mark. But if they received it already back in May, 2020, then all their doing is repeating the same announcement 8 months later. Unless the announcement in May, 2020 was false; so now their telling the truth. Or maybe it was true back then, then it became false, because the CE mark they had obtained was revoked. But then they lied by omission in failing to correct a previous material statement.So how do you vote, where they lying in May, 2020, or were they lying on January 12, 2021, or were the lying all along?"

Amazing that this stock has yet to be picked up on this message board. This is just the beginning. One country with approval. One test. This and other tests in the approval process worldwide. A multi-billion dollar market that serves people with a debilitating disease. The currently approved test is for in-home colorectal cancer screening.
I'm bullish on this stock and its down 33% over past 30 days! Stock price is looking bullish and I'll be adding more shares on any pullback! Best of luck to the Longs!.

"Dean-- you are obviously short here and thus bashing Biomerica. You are also lying here. The previous CFO simply retired-- she is an elderly lady in her late 60s. People do retire eventually. The SEC ""investigation"" is about Palm Global Hedge Fund, which invested $2 million into BMRA in February 2020 and obtained ""observer status"" with the BMRA BOD and that gave Palm Global inside information, which Palm Global allegedly used to trade BMRA shares. Biomerica is not a target of the SEC here. Biomerica received EU CE Mark in June of 2020, so they could not sell anything in Europe before. If you read that Biomerica press release, they only stated that they have the capability to manufacture million Covid-19 rapid test kits, not that they will sell million test kits.Finally, if you are still short and holding, you are playing with fire here--Biomerica is waiting for the FDA EUA and EU CE Mark approval for its ELISA Covid-19 test, which was submitted on June 16th, 2020. That approval should come in shortly (pardon my pun). When it does, BMRA will gap up, and you will have a problem."

Interesting week ahead. Brace yourself for holding this ticker upwards.
Yesterday the market over-reacted to yesterday's re-filing of the expiring shelf registration. No need to panic. All the same positives are still in place that were there before the re-filing of the shelf registration. Still very bullish on BMRA.

"I knew something (news) was coming out!. Biomerica Signs Exclusive Distribution Agreement In Canada For Helicobacter Pylori (H. pylori) Test, hp+detect8:21 am ET June 24, 2021 (Benzinga) PrintBiomerica Inc. (NASDAQ:BMRA) today announced that it has signed an exclusive five-year distribution agreement with a Canadian partner for the distribution and marketing of Biomerica's new and proprietary Helicobacter pylori test, called hp+detect. The hp+detect product has been developed for the identification and monitoring of H. pylori infection, the leading cause of duodenal and gastric ulcers, and a contributing risk factor associated with gastric cancer. Physicians and medical centers can use hp+detect to diagnose the presence of H. pylori and to monitor the efficacy of treatment.In order to sell the product in Canada, Biomerica's distribution partner will now seek Health Canada clearance using the clinical data recently generated by Biomerica using the hp+detect product. The Company also intends to seek a CE Mark for the product to be sold in the European Union and FDA clearance in the USA.Biomerica's test is designed to increase the sensitivity and specificity of H. pylori testing as compared to certain other products currently in the market.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection worldwide is approximately 50%, and as high as 80%–90% in developing countries, and ≈35%–40% in the United States. Approximately 20% of persons infected with H. pylori develop related gastroduodenal disorders during their lifetime.""1""H. pylori infection can cause serious health conditions, so early detection of the disease in symptomatic patients is important for those infected with these bacteria. Our hp+detect product identifies the presence of H. pylori antigen, enabling doctors to diagnose patients, as well as monitor treatment efficacy. Because of the rise of antibiotic resistance in H. pylori treatment, and the long-term cancer risk associated with proton-pump inhibitor ulcer medication use, it is important to monitor the eradication of infection,"" said Zack Irani, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Biomerica."

"WHY I SHORTED THIS AND MADE MONEY.(1) They announced in March that they would produce 1 million test kits / month a $10 each.(2) Just before that, they issued a ton of new shares, which quickly got dumped on the news.(3) The S.E.C. is investigating their March press release about the rapid test kits.(4) They obviously didn't sell much of their supposed test kits overseas -- Just divide their revenues by10 and attribute every single dollar to those kits, if you want to be optimistic, and it comes out to nada. If any of their ""samples"" that they sold in the previous quarter overseas were any good, they'd have had hundreds of thousands or millions of kits sold. So they must not be any good -- certainly the price point of $10 ea. is attractive, so the only explanation is that they don't work so there's no demand. Remember that they said they shipped samples in March to the EU, so they were early to get something in the market. If they had worked they would have had more demand then than they have now given new entrants.(5) Their CFO resigned on 8/31, the day before their previous earnings that they delayed by over 2 months from the estimated earnings date. Why the huge delay?(6) Their announcement of the CFO's resignation did not include any typical disclosure that the CFO had no disagreement with management, which is always done to avoid any suggestion that the CFO refused to sign-off on anything.(7) Their announcement of the CFO's resignation said she was staying on until December for a smooth transition, and that she'd been with the company for 50 years. So she obviously wasn't in a hurry to go on vacation. Yet she resigned 1 day before the earnings report, which had to be signed by the new CFO.WAKE UP PEOPLE. THEY HAVE NOTHING OF VALUE OTHER THAN THEIR NON-COVID RELATED PRODUCTS, THEY ARE WAY WAY OVER VALUED. EXPECT TO SEE THIS BACK IN THE 2'S AND 3'S WITHIN 6 MONTHS."

OTHER INFORMATIONITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGSAs disclosed in the Form 10K filed with the SEC on August 31, 2020, on July 2, 2020, the Company received a notice of investigation and subpoena to produce information and documents from the Division of Enforcement of the SEC. The subpoena seeks information and documents related to events and circumstances leading up to our March 17, 2020 announcement that we had commenced shipping samples of our COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test to countries outside of the United States, and had initiated the application process with the United States Food and Drug Administration under the COVID-19 Emergency Use Authorization for approval to market and sell the test in the United States. The subpoena also seeks information and documents about the identity of any persons who were aware of the substance of the March 17, 2020 announcement prior to that date. The Company is continuing to cooperate fully with the SEC’s investigation and provide information as requested. At this time, the Company is unable to predict the duration, scope or outcome of this investigation."
"This is not a good stock to short at all. In the short run, BMRA has two news items (FDA EUA and EU CE Mark for ELISA antibody test) that can come up at any time now. If that happens, there will be a huge gap up (just like this gap down today). If you are shorting it now and holding it overnight, you are assuming huge risk. Secondly, BMRA is a low float stock. All of the weak hands have left by now. (I am not selling.) Institutional stockholders (about 10%) of the float are not selling either because they are there for the long run.Thirdly, BMRA is not like UBX, STSA, or AKBA which tanked dramatically after bad news, and stayed there for a long time. BMRA has another log in the fire--InFoods (IBS), which is a long term prospect, but very promising prospects."
"For a tiny company, these guys are really outperforming. This new comfortable nasal swab that can be used in, for example, offices and schools. No lab equipment. If it's for real, is easily worth today's market cap.Ditto upcoming h pylori test.IBS/InFoods would be in a totally different league."
"Sold entire position @ 7.91 for slight loss.Today’s announcement felt like an attempt for an artificial lift. No factual data backing up anything at this point. Was patient, admit I may have erred and will miss a possible big future gain. That’s life. Good luck, you guys."
Just went to the dr. They said a covid antibody test is more accurate than the swab... we really are holding a gem here BMRA’s is approved this going straight to 20. Hoping for a dip to reload 
Looking powerful!
"FYI: Dave says he's not a paid basher. Hard to believe him given over 3,700 negative posts across dozens of stocks. Dave, get lost!!"
"Q: Why is BMRA moving up? A: Three reasons-- (a) upcoming FDA EUA approval for its ELISA serological Covid-19 lab-based test (submitted 6/16/20); (b) upcoming European CE Mark approval for its ELISA serological Covid-19 test; (c) upcoming 2nd Q ER in August, which will show Biomerica's international revenue increase from its Covid-19 serological #$%$ type rapid test."
"In last 18 months of buying stock, BMRA has been the BIGGEST disappointment of all my holdings. If it couldn't capitalize during the pandemic, what does it have going forward?

something poppin here
Stock is a joke! For shorting only.
so many TESTING KITS out there. This stock pumped up too much. It will drop back down under 7 tommorrow. This is pump and dump with the company has only 1 million cash left
"Shorts are getting desperate here-- BMRA jumped to $8.44 today on NO news. Imagine what would happen once that FDA EUA approval (which in my opinion is imminent) is granted.Biomerica has been in business since 1972 manufacturing different types of medical tests. It has been trading in relatively tight range till mid-March 2020, when BMRA became a Covid-19 stock when Biomerica announced it was manufacturing Covid-19 tests. Biomerica could not announce it was working on Covid-19 test any earlier because Covid-19 did not exist in the USA before. Since everything these days has been ""Covid-19"", I am not surprised that BMRA jumped in value since mid-March ($23.39 was 52-week High). If you are shorting here, look at your Risk/Reward ratio. If you are correct-- you can make at most $6. If you are wrong here, BMRA will jump to $20s or $40. Brent here is betting against Covid-19 stock based on what (some kind of Iranian conspiracy)?? Shorts lost big today because they are totally misguided. I am long here because I did my research, and so far I have been right."

"Alright Insiders help us understand. On today’s COVID 19 address to the nation Dr Birx stated that the accuracy of the serology tests conducted in Europe and other nations were not very accurate. It sounds like they are working with many labs to improve the accuracy of the tests but they are not effective enough yet to rely on. And, minutes ago, UCSF was feature on local Bay Area news stating they developed a test based on Crispr technology that can be replicated/processed through labs and could potentially be conducted at home. I’m still holding but it’s probably not very smart of me. What say you?"
How they allowed company like this a fake or scam announcement about corona virus text kits. It also add an icing that gets test results in few 15 minutes or less. There should be legal cases for scam companies like this or who ever reported it to be untrue.

Lost 50% of my investment because I bought it when it spiked. Seems like its stuck at $7. Should I just take the loss or hope for a better earnings report down the line...
When are results
"I think BMRA reached price support at $9.50. BMRA closed around $9.50 for the last two trading days when broad markets were all red. It closed $10.20 the day after the S3 fiasco when BMRA dropped 26% in 90 minutes. Short sales volume is also declining over the last three days, from 1.8 million shares short on Wed., to 0.6 million shares on Th. and 0.18 million shares short on Friday.

I wish that Biomerica never got involved with Palm Global.Weird, weird ER. I am still bullish and holding. It dropped to $6.14 in AH trading and then back to $7. Tomorrow (Tuesday 9/1) will be interesting."
"I would love to see this stock move up since I bought high. I guess I believed they were going someplace 7-8 months ago when they released info on their quick covid test. Then they fell off the map. EUA nonsense has kept them afloat. NOW is the time of reckoning. To me, if they don't pop with decent earnings, I'm out at a loss and never looking back. If they jump up at a decent level. I'll hold on to break even and maybe make a little. The charts are wrong!!! The high wasn't 16, it was over $20 when trading was halted bc it was moving too fast, Trust me, I feel the pain."
"15-min COVID-19 Rapid Test does NOT require expensive lab. Suitable for use in remote places, rural areas and POE Port of Entry."
This stock is going to fly!!!!!Getting EUA in the us for rapid testing for virus. It is 100% accurate. Let’s go.
Patients pays offI said once this is flying oneday Am sure of now
BMRA short interest is now 10% of float. Over 13 days to cover. Where is Reddit / Robinhood crowd?
"FULL DISCLOSURE: I've just learned that there is a regulation preventing the FDA from disclosing pending applications for approvals. Okay. So we can't get any confirmation from the FDA directly as to the rapid test.Maybe there is one, and maybe there will be an approval. But why no word from BMRA as to what has transpired since 3/17 when they sent their samples overseas? That one is hard to explain. So at this point, I'm now out altogether and just keeping an eye on this. Too bad there are no options on this stock."
"@mike Just read your response. I'm not really clear on your distillery analogy. When a distillery converts it delivers a product, hand sanitizer. When BMRA sent media info they were supposed to deliver tests after EUA approval. That has not happened from any reports I have read. They said they were sending over seas months ago, (no EUA needed in europe) but there is no info on what they sent or who they sent it to. A veil of secrecy makes me suspicious as I have seen many companies say one thing and never deliver on their press releases. I still want this company to succeed, but I expect a lot more clarity and transparency which is not evident. I understand Covid testing is not their business, but they made it their business and that's what alarms me. They need to deliver."
Finally when’s the earnings? So glad I didn’t listen to the bashers on this board! Good luck to everyone who’s long here

"DID YOU HEAR THE NEWS about the ""at home"" Covid 19 test, and the FDA's approval of just about everyone other than BMRA?""The North Carolina-based LabCorp — which launched its lab test for the illness in March — currently conducts as many as 65,000 tests a day and offers results within two to four days, Reuters reported.""The FDA’s around-the-clock work since this outbreak began has resulted in the authorization of more than 50 diagnostic tests and engagement with over 350 test developers,” Hahn said in the announcement.""So, why no word about BMRA's supposedly pending pre-EUA application? And why no word from BMRA as to any overseas sales?"
