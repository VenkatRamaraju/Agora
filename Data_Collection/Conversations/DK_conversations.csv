my bad > 2022
Over next 2 qtr's DK should be up and in the range of $23 and possibly as high as $27 as fuel demand surges into 2021. I'm watching how mg'mt will position themselves looking further out.
Refineries are in for a tough couple years due solely to glut of raw combined with significant reduction in demand. There are going to be refinery closures. Cash as always will be key to survival. Thus I suspect future dividends will be slim to none.
"After the disaster of these two days, on the positive side I see that CEO Yemin Ezra, maintains 4% or 706,083 shares of the company that at today's price $ 14.31 is valued at 10,104,047.73 And his shares were bought at $ 35.85 ,,,, $ 30.90 ,,, $ 29.76, do you think that the CEO is selling to this price? to lose millions of dollars, my idea is that he is buying more at these levels or that he is not selling because he knows that the DK will rise above the price i bought."
"The US$ 10 drop in share price is hard to explain, we still have the Midland to Brent crude oil differential if not higher than a month ago! One thing is for sure, DK should have great cash flow and the stock drop despite buy backs suggests we either overlook a tremendous factor or just can't belief the opportunity to buy the stock""Uzi Yemin, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Delek said, “We believe that Delek US is well positioned to benefit from the trends in the market with the current Midland to Brent crude oil differential and has the ability to generate significant cash flow that builds on our strong financial position"""
"DK has some of the best managers in the business. The stock is undervalued, the company is buying back stock, and the Board is shareholder friendly. The company has a track record of acquiring undervalued and complementary assets."
"EPA Proposes Biofuel Mandate Cut In Win For Oil RefinersBy Charles Kennedy - Aug 27, 2021, 11:30 AM CDTThe Environmental Protection Agency has proposed a retroactive reduction in biofuel mandates, effective 2020, in very welcome news to oil refiners who have been complaining of the costly mandates.Citing two unnamed sources familiar with the proposal, Reuters reports that the document was sent to the White House to be reviewed on Thursday, adding that it will likely deepen the rift between oil refiners and biofuels producers whose interests are at complete odds in the fuel blending department."
DK owns 34.7 million shares and will receive .94 cents per share distribution that's 35.348 million dollars just this quarter. Look at DK's market cap it is way undervalued.
"Oct 18 (Reuters) - U.S. refiners are expected to show higher earnings for the third quarter as margins to sell gasoline and diesel have improved despite the surging cost of crude oil, analysts said.After more than a year of depressed fuel demand, gasoline and distillate consumption is back in line with five-year averages in the United States, the world's largest fuel consumer. That has boosted margins on refined products to more than double what those companies were making at this time a year ago.The seven largest independent U.S. refining companies, including giants Marathon Petroleum (MPC.N) and Valero Energy (VLO.N), are projected to post an average earnings-per-share gain of 66 cents, versus a loss of $1.32 for the third quarter of 2020, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (GRAPHIC: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-REFINERIES/EARNINGS-OUTLOOK/mopanjqyzva/)Those gains are driven by the 3-2-1 crack spread, a proxy for refining margins, which assumes a barrel of crude oil is refined to three parts gasoline, two parts diesel and one part jet fuel. That spread is currently at $21 per barrel, compared with around $9 a year ago.Energy demand has recovered swiftly from the worst days of the pandemic in 2020, and Brent and U.S. crude oil prices have reached multi-year highs in recent days. But product demand has also increased, and that has helped boost margins.Product supplied - a proxy for U.S. refined product demand - was 21.5 million barrels per day in the most recent week, slightly higher than the same period in 2019, prior to the onset of the pandemic, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).""The market is getting back in equilibrium,"" Credit Suisse analyst Manav Gupta said in a note.Refiners are also benefiting from lower inventories of their products as recent storms and the pandemic knocked refining capacity offline. Approximately 2.5 million barrels per day of refining capacity has been shut since the start of the pandemic, which is almost four times the 10-year average, according to Credit Suisse's Gupta.Delta Air Lines' refinery in Monroe, Pennsylvania, earned nearly $100 million last quarter, its first positive results since the first quarter of 2020, according to figures released last week. Tudor Pickering Holt analysts cited strong gasoline and diesel crack spreads as helping the refiner recover.Jet fuel demand is still below pre-pandemic levels, but international flights are expected to resume to Europe in November. The spot price of U.S. Gulf Coast kerosene-type jet fuel is $2.10 dollars per gallon, the highest since October 2018, despite demand still 12% below 2018 levels, per EIA data.Analysts have also been raising estimates for refiners such as PBF Energy and Hollyfrontier due to declining costs of complying with the nation's biofuels laws. Refiners are required to blend ethanol into the nation's gasoline pool or buy credits for others who can.The cost of those credits declined sharply in the third quarter. Reuters reported in September that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expected to recommend reducing federal biofuel blending mandates for 2021 to below 2020 levels, according to analysts"
"I can't believe it's down that much, the results are better than expected,Delek US Hldgs (NYSE:DK) reported quarterly earnings of $1.18 per share. This is a 0.85 percent increase over earnings of $1.17 per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $1.54 billion which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $1.29 billion by 19.07 percent, tomorrow will be another day we'll see what happens,good luck"
"When these big falls occur and there is no justification for that, I take advantage and buy, add 4000 shares at $ 15.91, good luck"
"Uzi Yemin, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Delek US, stated, ""Our diversified portfolio is providing resilience during this period of weak refining margins with the logistics and retail segments generating a contribution margin above $80 million collectively. Our transition to midstream and more stable cash flow is well underway with previous capital investments poised to support ongoing growth from robust second quarter levels.""Mr. Yemin continued, ""Our company has a long history of being nimble and we remain agile in terms of flexing our capital spending and cost structure to the prevailing macro environment. We are on-track to exceed guidance of $100 million of cost reductions year over year. Capital spending was reduced dramatically from first quarter levels and we expect to remain disciplined with minimal outlay anticipated for the balance of the year. As of June 30th, the company had a cash balance of $849 million and is well positioned for a turbulent macro environment."""
"OK I own a lot of DK and am down a lot, so here is the good news:They reported $1.50 per share LOSS on a non GAAP basis, but they earned $1.18 per share on a GAAP basis, which is the real reported numbers the CPA's use in reporting. That handily beat the estimated numbers and even beat by a penny the preceding year's per share earnings. Why the big difference ? The GAAP reported numbers include depreciation and huge carry forward losses that write off against taxes, etc.So the accounting types are buying today and the headline reading types are selling today. look for a bounce back tomorrow. PS: Their drop down company with the logistics just continues to perform great and by next quarter will be even better.I am buying more today."

Citi downgrades stock it goes up....got love these manipulators...
Busted through 50d and 200d MAs on the chart. Next stop 52 week high 27. Undervalued and a chronic underperformer. Sweet spot with 80+ oil
"@peter68 This is getting a little scary. It is beginning to remind me of the disconnect between AR and AM in market cap and share price. AR should never be trading at less than AM, but now we have DK trading at a fraction of DKL when DK owns more of DKL than ever, since the Incentive Rights deal. Has there ever been a time when the LP bought out the mother-ship?? I believe that has actually occurred in the past decade. The refineries are the current boat anchor. Midstream, Pipeline and Transport is Golden."
"Don’t know much about the company but the more I read about it the more it seems to be undervalued with over 10% dividend. Bought over 30,000 shares at 11.97 which is less than ichan paid in March 2020. Will hold this for a longtime."
"Morgan Stanley Comments:Delek (DK): We are constructive into 3Q as we see scope for near-term upward revisions, largely driven by the company's Refining segment. Beyond near-term operational updates, we expect focus on the call to center around potential for the company to receive Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs) from the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. We currently do model this occurring and treat it as a one-time ~$180MM windfall in 4Q from RINs monetization. Meanwhile, incremental focus will likely be on DK's updated thoughts around a potential buy-in to the Bakersfield renewable diesel project operated by GCE Holdings Acquisitions, LLC, and any further planned expansion in the company's Retail business.HollyFrontier (HFC): We are cautious into 3Q earnings season. While we are quite constructive on the LT potential for HFC and see a significant upward revision in 2022 on strip commodity prices, we see limited scope for revisions in Q3 and Q4, largely due to the planned maintenance at the company's Navajo, NM refinery, which will limit the company's ability to capitalize on near-term market strength. We expect focus on the call to be on closing timelines for the company's acquisition of Sinclair Oil and Shell's Puget Sound Refinery, as well as a status update on its renewable diesel project in Artesia, NM. We are currently modeling the ramp-up of renewable diesel production through 1H22, a 4Q closing for Puget Sound, and a mid-2022 closing of Sinclair Oil.PBF Energy (PBF): We are neutral into 3Q earnings as we see some noise in 3Q estimates due to differing treatment of the company's expected RIN mark-to-market. Some leading edge estimates >$250MM appear quite aggressive to us, though we do expect the company to benefit from a meaningfully improving macro environment. We expect focus will largely center around major cash uses into year-end and early 2022. The company had guided to ~$550MM of cash outflows in 2H related to environmental programs, and has not been buying RINs at elevated prices to meet its 2021 obligations. Meanwhile, PBF continues to evaluate whether to move forward with its proposed renewable diesel project in Chalmette, LA – the company recently said that it expects to reach final investment decision is expected in the coming months, and we therefore could see scope for an update here in 3Q."
DK owns 80% of DKL or 34.7 million units. DKL is currently trading at $50.50 per unit. So the 80% stake amounts to approximately $1.75 billion. Therefore current unit price for DK is undervalued.
