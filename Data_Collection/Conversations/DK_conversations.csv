Took some profits yesterday. Sold 5000 shares at 21.9 and 5000 shares at 22. Still got over 42000 shares. Will buy back if it falls otherwise content with the trades.
Just raised $500mm from the MLP and more to come by year end...Div. is solid ...until the next increase.
"I held ALJ stock until they done the deal with DK. I sold all my shares because I didn't like the way the shareholders were treated. I took a position in DK yesterday, put aside my ill feelings. I believe this company has a good chance of growing well beyond where it is at the present time. It is a good place to park some retirement income investment for the present time. I see the stock market at a pause short term."
Next Tuesday $39 plus
Options calls manipulated
I thought they where doing share buyback
Today’s latest analyst updateDelek US Holdings Inc : Barclays cuts target price to $58 from $62 Buy

DK reached a new All Time High at 45.41
Own lots of DK.. Won't even think to sell until upper 30 range. I'm patient- No hype- for those short no problem at all. Still very undervalued - D
crack spreads are 17-20-- that means dk buys their oil cheapload up
"Bottom to buy now at $31.5, more than 3% dividend for long term. Oil price is up."
"Oil stockpiles are continuing to be sopped up with USA production down by about 2 million BPD and many small producers being forced out of the market. China has now placed an order for 20 million barrels of US crude as they are trying desperately to fulfill their phase 1 obligations. This will further deplete oil supplies in the USA and cause fuel prices to rise which is good for refineries.On the political front I think as we get to the end of September it will become clear that President Trump will win a second term. A second Trump term will be positive for our remaining oil drillers, pipeline companies, refineries, as well as just about every other business in America. A Trump win will reignite our economy just in time for those collecting unemployment to return to work.Regarding CVI, September is the month that management and our BOD must decide whether to go forward with their bio diesel plans. Personally, I hope they do as this will help us mitigate some of our RIN issues and it will open up a new line of production and new markets at a very low cost that will ultimately be paid for with tax credits.... a win-win situation! CVI also needs to make a decision on the expansion or merger front to decide whether they will merge with DK or pursue an acquisition in the PADD IV region.Personally, I think the PADD IV region idea is Mr. Lamp's a plan B option and an incentive to get DK to come to the table with reasonable expectations. Mr. Lamp is not too fond of MLP's and I suspect that he will want to see DLK absorbed by DK before he would agree to any deal (IMHO). Recent moves by DK regarding DKL would seem to indicate that DK is doing just that. I think if I were a DKL investor I would be looking for an exit point within the next few weeks and reinvesting in DK because, just as what happened when crvv was called by CVI, the assets and value of DKL's operations will transfer over to DK's balance sheet causing a substantial and immediate jump in DK's share price. In the end, if DK and CVI merge operations, I believe a new ticker symbol will be created for the combined company and investors will be granted shares based upon a predetermined formula. I believe DK investors would fair better in such a transaction after DLK is absorbed rather than in its present structure. Cheers!"
"EPA Proposes Biofuel Mandate Cut In Win For Oil RefinersBy Charles Kennedy - Aug 27, 2021, 11:30 AM CDTThe Environmental Protection Agency has proposed a retroactive reduction in biofuel mandates, effective 2020, in very welcome news to oil refiners who have been complaining of the costly mandates.Citing two unnamed sources familiar with the proposal, Reuters reports that the document was sent to the White House to be reviewed on Thursday, adding that it will likely deepen the rift between oil refiners and biofuels producers whose interests are at complete odds in the fuel blending department."
"Feel Dk is going higher from here. Expect 15 by December. Now have 46634 shares at 10.48 also have Kim 40454 at 10,71, my second largest holdings, My cannabis stocks cron, cgc, and grwg on a tear up at least 30%. My gold stocks, ssrm and fcx also doing great. Sold all of drd Friday and bought more Dk and Kim. I have more small cap stocks, then mid cap and a little large cap( xom & cop) to take advantage of the recovery from the recession due to the pandemic. I’m up at least 100% since March trading airline and cruise stocks which I sold all of it. I’m heavily invested in oil, cannabis, gold, and reit. Small holding in Coty , 25k which is on a tear as well. Can wait for the markets to open."
DK reached a new 52 Week High at 45.80
"This message board is dead. Does anyone have any thoughts or even hope for a catalyst to move this stock? I was buying on big dips as it plunged through 19 and then 16 and then 14. Then I ran out of money and courage. This thing is a boat anchor now! I would be happy to see 12 again. The fact that DKL still has a much higher market cap than the mother-ship, is still hard to rectify. Who might be interested in buying DK besides CVI? Their stock is so weak I can't see any upside unless thy gave us 1.5 shares for 1 and that is not likely to happen."
What a ride. This stock is very volatile . Sold most of 27992 shares yesterday and today iexcept 4618 and made good profits because I just don’t think fiscal stimulus is coming soon. Trump is playing game as he knows he will lose the election if there is no fiscal stimulus. The republican senators are not ready to endorse 2.4T. I will buy back after it falls again.
DK is up 4.91% to 52.76
"Over the last 2 days I have bought 18424 shares at 11.37. I sold 36,000 shares above 12.8 a few days ago when we had the hurricane. I plan to buy more as it goes down. With the vaccines on the horizon I expect this to go much higher. In the meantime I will be getting 10% dividend. Can’t beat that."
"DK, thru a subsidiary, is buying North Sea assets from chevron. See news for chevron, 5/31. The assets are characterized as mature, aging, and difficult. At the same time the fields are said to boost reserves by 150%. So is this perceived as a plus or minus for DK?Is DK perceived as getting overextended?DK appears to be aggressive in it's quest for growth. Too far too fast?Just thinking aloud here."
I thought they where doing a share buyback.?
Any ideas on this price continuing to fall and when the financials will come out?
"if definitely here in DK, there is a short day trading selling millions of shares, every time it recovers and reaches the range of 0.60 cents it sells millions and buys again after DK loses more than $ 1.10, today I watch him do that a couple of times a day"
"About a month ago I pointed out that DK was not going to hold up going forward. I sold nearly all my shares.Today came a serious downgrade predicting a $45 target, well down from the $62 or so available recently.I got panned for my post. I concluded that not every poster is an analyst. And I do make mistakes.$40 is going to be a realistic target imo. Put me down for trying to be of help but I see the present target not holding up Good luck!"
they move with the oil...I see them Skyrocketing After the elections! peace!
"It can be said that today was a better day, we recovered some of what was lost days ago, we'll see what they decide on the stimulus package, good luck"
It's not far from 1year low.
With oil climbing this should be higher
Now we are worse than pandemic times
Restrict Canadian pipeline... will help delek be more profitable
Have 26020 shares at avg 10.54. Confident it will go up in the coming days with vaccines and fiscal stimulus. Expect it to double and maybe triple in one year.
"I can't believe it's down that much, the results are better than expected,Delek US Hldgs (NYSE:DK) reported quarterly earnings of $1.18 per share. This is a 0.85 percent increase over earnings of $1.17 per share from the same period last year. The company reported quarterly sales of $1.54 billion which beat the analyst consensus estimate of $1.29 billion by 19.07 percent, tomorrow will be another day we'll see what happens,good luck"
Busted through 50d and 200d MAs on the chart. Next stop 52 week high 27. Undervalued and a chronic underperformer. Sweet spot with 80+ oil
Why Isn't Dk's Ownership Of The 10% Dividend From DLK Passed On To Us?
10 mm shares could come to market from CVI holders over the next few weeks..
DK reached a new All Time High at 42.32
Stock 40% undervalued
Any other alon holders get shorted on the buyout
This is the refiner wit the most impressive earnings and strongest financials!! a real bargain below $40s
Stock goes up 1% and Call does not move. Stock goes down 1% and the Call goes down 20%. Manipulation at its best
I agree with u uriahd. it is strange oil was going up but this stock was barely moving up. Now oil goes down and it drops two dollars. Zack rate it as a strong buy. I don't get it.
"JUNE 12TH 45 CALLS, 2 AT THAT PRICE, SAVE THEM FOR ME...HRTX SEP 36 CALLS WHILE CHEAP, HEXO JAN 2021 6 CALLS, PSNL JULY CALLS, GRPN 2022 5.5 CALLS, NVTA SEP 35 CALLS. ****"
"Boy, Yahoo! ought to block these incessant ads promoting stockdork BS. I must be flagging thirty or more daily. If Yahoo! cares, why aren't they doing something?"
Bought more today at 9.98. Ridiculously cheap. Now have 33809 shares at 10.41 which is around 12% dividends if not reduced in the future. Plan to buy more if it goes down. Hope to have 50k shares by selling my gold stocks. Buy while it’s cheap because this will rocket once we have the vaccines and or fiscal stimulus.
Is the DK dividend at risk of being reduced? I am considering to make a big investment in this stock on Monday ; and I would appreciate this communities advice. Does anyone have an explanation for why DK stock has been dropping lately? What needs to happen for DK to start going back up?
"@Nobody,Thanks for your comments, the hurricane has passed and its damage was less. The talks temporarily halted with CVI in recent months because the DK board thought the deal did not reflect DK's true value and some other COVID-19 related issues, DK is a much bigger company than CVI and I think because Carl Icahn's has $ 125.8 million invested in DK and much more in CVI $ 1,431,806,219 does not mean that we have to give him DK for a price outside its real value, I do not think Carl Icahn or anyone else is selling at this price, DK is one of the Little company on the planet that at the price of $ 15 pays a dividend of 6.97% per year, but perhaps you can be right in what it says, because everything can happen in these lives, good luck."
"Also, Q1 distribution for this year up to Feb. 7th is expected.Today I got hold of DK's Investor Relations head and he told me there'd be no distributions forthcoming because ALDW ceased to exist effective 2/7/18. I told him it is illegal to blend the books of both compainies until debt obligations are met. Also, it appears DK is backdating the paperwork so as to obscure the facts and legitimate claim's ALDW unitholders have.I'm filing complaints with the Texas Securities Board as well as the SEC.This is unpleasant stuff."
Extremely undervalued time to buy here shorts made fortunes shorting the entire week including banks and institutions
spreads look good. Everything is OK enough for this plug not to be going down. no news . I don't understand this.
Why the sudden drop 2pm
Monster gas draw tomorow!!! Spring break driving!!!!
DK is up 13.27% to 18.86
"Two months ago I predict this stock will see lower 20's, Big spring refinery going through some hell, issues and fires are daily things, margins are negative specially with coronavirus outbreak and oil in mid to lower 40's. I'll not touch this stock for a while as it may lower 15's."
"I really don't see the reason to lose around 4% today, a loss yesterday of 14% is enough to interpret any bad trimester result,I think a recovery in the afternoon could be the most logical,"
Sitting back waiting for this babe to hit 10 again and I’ll load up rinse and repeat at the 25-30 range. Oil is such an easy investment. More up and down than a see saw so buy a lot on the downs this company will see the high days again
"What a joke these Analysts are - TP Downgrading DK to a sell...Wow...What would we do without these guys. Stock is down more than 50% from where it was 200 days ago...So demand is slowly working its way back, retail sales in stores were good....So now they downgrade? I never trust any of these people. They are always super late to tell you to sell- and when the stock is up 20-30% then they say ""buy."" Net net , they are as helpful as all the ""experts"" on CNBC.. Holding D"
now's the time to buy!
"Regular Quarterly DividendDelek US announced today its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.31 per share. Shareholders of record on August 19, 2020 will receive this cash dividend payable on September 3, 2020.LiquidityAs of June 30, 2020, Delek US had a cash balance of $849.0 million and total consolidated long-term debt of $2,454.9 million, resulting in net debt of $1,605.9 million. As of June 30, 2020, Delek Logistics Partners, LP (NYSE: DKL) (""Delek Logistics"") had $995.2 million of total debt and $16.2 million of cash, which is included in the consolidated amounts on Delek US' balance sheet. Excluding Delek Logistics, Delek US had approximately $832.8 million in cash and $1,459.7 million of debt, or a $626.9 million net debt position."
"This is a $55 stock selling for nothing here!! Cash holdings above $1.1 billion!! Synergies between ALON USA, ALON PARTNERS and DELEK US HOLDINGS should be way higher than this!!"
I didn't see DK on the list of refiners that may be hit by Venzuela heavy crude import.Are they the unknown on this list?https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/venezuela-oil-sanctions-likely-to-hit-some-us-refiners-hard/ar-BBSEbs2
P.E of 6.26 this thing is 50% undervalued IMO
"What's the scoop on DK? Been adding as it drops... but it keeps dropping, lol. Just watching now."
Refineries are in for a tough couple years due solely to glut of raw combined with significant reduction in demand. There are going to be refinery closures. Cash as always will be key to survival. Thus I suspect future dividends will be slim to none.
Well managed company....
Down Grades Til They Accumulate What They Want? Co's A Cash Cow!
Good report
"Where is the bottom, Not sure this much hair cut is warranted!"
How many share of CVI is ICAHN BUYING?? Stats of CVI and DK almost identical...DK P/E substantially lower...Illogical move!!
10% down form yesterday's level PLUS 0.31 divy just declared. Yup took a position in DK today!
Refining stocks are all manipulated!! Option market for these stocks are even worst!!
"Don't think it's the fundamentals, I guess it's the technical's - It was going up too fast recently and hit the upper Bollinger, that's after 2 years of bull. That's all."
"Alert DK InvestersSunrise Pipeline from Plains ,Midstream oil Company is starting on Nov 1 st .They is at least 2 months ahead of schedule .This is the reason for the Midland differential to drop and DK shares drop ."
"What's happening today? , everything went better than expected, the economy added 1.763 million payrolls again in July, the unemployment rate fell to 10.2%, I see what the problem is today, the market has already risen in the last 4 days also oil and it's time for a week's correction, and now DK is dragging, it's incredible, but today we should end the day in green, good luck."
This sell off was orchestraded!! MM knew about this downgrades way way before market!!!
DK owns 80% of DKL or 34.7 million units. DKL is currently trading at $50.50 per unit. So the 80% stake amounts to approximately $1.75 billion. Therefore current unit price for DK is undervalued.
Will Cvi holders begin liberating Dk shares tomorrow?
"What's with DK, why she is so much down. All 4 refineries working retail business is good, pipelines operating then why so much negativity.."
Correction- Why Isn't DKL's .88 Per Quarter Passed On To Dk Shareholders & The 10% ALN Dividend After Te Buyout???
"@peter68 This is getting a little scary. It is beginning to remind me of the disconnect between AR and AM in market cap and share price. AR should never be trading at less than AM, but now we have DK trading at a fraction of DKL when DK owns more of DKL than ever, since the Incentive Rights deal. Has there ever been a time when the LP bought out the mother-ship?? I believe that has actually occurred in the past decade. The refineries are the current boat anchor. Midstream, Pipeline and Transport is Golden."
"Crazy undervalued.DK owns 80% of DKL. DKL Market Cap is 1.37B. DK Market Cap is 1.32B.That means the market is pricing the refineries, retail, & other business units as worthless.."
"Gotta love it- GS cuts DK to a sell and a $16 price target. I never listen to Analysts- In fact most of the time when they say buy I sell and when they say sell I buy. They are nothing more than legalized manipulators. Don't trust any of them, the experts on CNBC - who are also legalized frontrunners. I have lots of DK and have no intention of selling a single share. JMHO D"

Remember the true value of the combined ALON and DK is finally showing up in the earnings.See y’all at $60.
DK will be acquired eventually. Refiner is hard asset and there are only a few in this field. Big fish eats small ones. Buying more DK now. The price is very depressed. Loading....
wow just wow this stock is back to reality..... thanks Trump
Six month ago in pandemic was in $20
Four days red
the most undervalued in the whole refining sector!! Sitting on $1.1 billion dollar cash on hand almost 0 debt!!
10.5 mm shares to be distibuted on June 10 to Cvi holders...
my bad > 2022
Continue selling puppies!! MMs are buying today!!
"I have a question that circulates in my head, if API and tomorrow EIA announce a big drop in inventories last week due to hurricanes Marcos and Laura, it would be good for the refineries including DK or it would be bad, I can't remember how the refineries reacted in the past hurricanes, if anyone here on the board remembers please share it, good luck"
"half an hour after the market started, DK went from red to green gaining 0.51 cents, at that time all his pairs were in red, half an hour later most of his pairs turned green, minus CVI that is still in red, and DK lost 3/4 of the morning profit, my idea is that DK is so tied to CVI that even if it wanted to go up it never will, until a decision is known from this stalled merger, it's just my humble opinion,Someone here has a different idea,I'd like you to share it, good luck."
let it break $34.40
https://stocktwits.com/NateMN/message/372878612
This stock should double soonIt doesn’t show the actual combined value of Delek/Alon
DK earnings were solid and guidance positive. Tempered but ongoing stock buy backs is a positive and so is the increased dividend pay on this counter. DK is deserving of a PE multiple of 10 and provides upside of about 30% from here.
Will breakout soon!!!
It looks a lot like some market manipulating to me. Low volume on the last few days of upward movement followed by a decent amount of action on yesterday's downturn.
DK reached a new 52 Week High at 37.80
MMs happy with results! Well done and great team work!
This will be the last time you see this stock price!!!
This stock is headed for $31
Does anyone know whether Dk is paying dividends?
"A total disaster, a 20% drop in two days with no bad news, I only seen companies make these big losses when the SEC is conducting an investigation or announcing that they are preparing for bankruptcy, none of the Two options is happening with DK, I have no explanation ,,,, I will just cross my fingers for the Republicans and Democrats to reach an agreement and the news helps DK to recover, because if this continues to fall we will crash at $ 10 very soon, good luck."
"Uzi Yemin, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Delek US, stated, ""Our diversified portfolio is providing resilience during this period of weak refining margins with the logistics and retail segments generating a contribution margin above $80 million collectively. Our transition to midstream and more stable cash flow is well underway with previous capital investments poised to support ongoing growth from robust second quarter levels.""Mr. Yemin continued, ""Our company has a long history of being nimble and we remain agile in terms of flexing our capital spending and cost structure to the prevailing macro environment. We are on-track to exceed guidance of $100 million of cost reductions year over year. Capital spending was reduced dramatically from first quarter levels and we expect to remain disciplined with minimal outlay anticipated for the balance of the year. As of June 30th, the company had a cash balance of $849 million and is well positioned for a turbulent macro environment."""

Sold I prefer to grab my gains
Back up to over 54000 shares. Also bought dkl as it was way down. Next to Oxy and fcx this is my third largest holdings. My fourth is CVI. Oil going above 80 by summer with opec and us production restraints. Over 25 Monday with the senate passing 1.9T fiscal stimulus
Anyone know when they bought out ALDW?
DK down 6.4% but DKL up 17.3% can someone explain?
"Several companies are in advanced stages of their medications and soon there will be some vaccine available on the market for COVID -19, when that happens millions of people will take to the streets to drive and travel around the world, consuming millions and millions of gallons of gasoline daily, the Post traumatic stress disorder that COVID will leave in people's minds will make no one want to be inside their home for even a second, DK is well positioned to take advantage of that moment and will easily rise above $ 30, hold your shares and you will be rewarded, good luck"

"Oil up huge today; don't understand this? I bought some of the DKL in the last couple days; can't believe it's so cheap, considering it pays $.75/q and increases about 3% every quarter; and it's got 1+ coverage! It has no BV but that's probably the way it's set up with the mp. Seems to operate like a trust."
sold out today at exactly my buy price. Just glad I broke even
I feel like I have been UZIed___
I bought it when it was at 60 dollars…ugh
Reasons for the big dropping? Q2 is ok.
"I think in ten years, this stock will be higher than today"
vaka I can't quite agree with that because I have other refiners in portfolio that follow the Midland differential and they haven't took the hit DK has taken. Other have taken 3-5 dollars hit. But dk is 13-15 dollar hit. Something is wrong with this picture.
"holding 5k shares and happy to be doing so! Good earnings, Good jobs report, Stimulous on the way ! it will be on the up and up"
"Delek is right on with it's assertions that CVI is trying to take them over by infiltrating their Board of Directors with three of their own select Directors. CVI does not want to buy Delek in a cash offering to it's shareholders they are more interested in a merger. This is the same play that occurred when Holly Corporation and Frontier Oil Refining merged. Individual shareholders came away with very little compensation, but others up the chain made out handsomely."
Oi back to $48 and 6.000.000 build in the week of memorial week end!!
down $6 in last two days??
"After the disaster of these two days, on the positive side I see that CEO Yemin Ezra, maintains 4% or 706,083 shares of the company that at today's price $ 14.31 is valued at 10,104,047.73 And his shares were bought at $ 35.85 ,,,, $ 30.90 ,,, $ 29.76, do you think that the CEO is selling to this price? to lose millions of dollars, my idea is that he is buying more at these levels or that he is not selling because he knows that the DK will rise above the price i bought."
Driving season starts now!!! Load up this is a monster refiner it’s tons of cash!!
DK is up 4.91% to 43.16
Load all September calls you can now!! This is the day!!
Options being brutally manipulated. They manioulate the bid in a way I have not see lately!! Unreal!!
Barry I am tired of trying to figure them one out. I am with u. This so much market maker manulation that it is not funny. I don't know what else can be holding this one down. We should be close to $50 by now.
DK reached a new All Time High at 43.87
"Tomorrow and the rest of week may see lows at $30, Investment in Gulf of Mexico didn't suit wall street."
market cap is close to cash holdings!!!! ????
"I think what is dragging DK and all the refineries today is some negative news from MRO, also the price of a barrel of oil rose above $ 42 and inventories fell 7.4 million barrels in the week ending 31 July, gas stations sold less gasoline last week, all these factors together make refineries have to pay more per barrel and less profit margin for refineries, it's just my ideas."
Reasons for today’s up 4%?
They are accumulating cash to buy another refinery!!
Hoping to buy more DK today but the price kept going up so bought xom instead at 32.2 which also pays over 10% dividends. Being green today so only down 3.6% since 33809 shares were bought avg 10.43. I’m confident it will be 20 in 2-3 months while getting 12% dividends. Short term I’m sure it will go down another 5-10% unfortunately due to rising Covid cases.
"Jerry:HFC & DK are two unrelated companies! Market games are systematically being played in an attempt to generate undue momentum. This often results in paving the way for otherwise unavailable profits through trading.This approach is referred to as ""churning."" I have an enormous position in NGL, another stock under this sort of pressure. I'm using the opportunity to add many units.Likewise, I added to my DK position yesterday, taking advantage of the apparent market manipulation.Maybe we can't beat the bad guys but we can go in and feast in the same opportunities as I'm doing.Good luck to you!"

DK reached a new All Time High at 56.37
Did people really not see the earnings dipping? We’re all aware oil and gas has been hit hard by the pandemic just like a lot of companies. This is just a reflection of that. But guess what oil does and has always done... roller coasters... personally suggest loading up while it’s cheap and just hold onto for the dividends until it gets over inflated again then sell and invest elsewhere until the next big oil dip happens
Hurricanes are good for DK.

"@marcel, I also can't believe that DK is trading at the ridiculous $ 15 price, Delek US owns four refineries with 302,000 b / d of refining capacity.

From what I can tell today’s volume was the heaviest since August 2016. Consensus Q2 earnings estimates have climbed from an average $1.09 to $1.55 in the past 4 weeks.
DK reached a new All Time High at 47.79
DKL FLYING
Dk will be okay to ride this out. My mom has been their environmental consultant for 20+ years now and place is still doing well. Never laid off anyone as long as she’s been there and company is even setting up a million dollar fund to assist with families in the company affected by covid-19. Very good business that’s been steadily expanding and takes care of their employees. Good management = successful business. If it hits below 10/share again I suggest you load up
what about our February distribution to the ALDW unit holders?
This has managed to grow to be my largest position and why it might make sense to trim it feels like there’s still plenty of room to run further.
Over next 2 qtr's DK should be up and in the range of $23 and possibly as high as $27 as fuel demand surges into 2021. I'm watching how mg'mt will position themselves looking further out.
"Can anyone please explain what this really mean ? In connection with the adoption of the Rights Agreement, a dividend distribution of one Right on each outstanding share of Delek common stock will be payable to shareholders of record on March 30, 2020.Does it mean that ,we should buy this common stock before March 30 2020 to get the complete rights ?"
"Bought more xom, coty, and 5000 shares of drd at 11.5 which I sold at 13.5 Friday."
"Delek US Holdings Inc. (DK) said a storm caused an operational disruption and excessive gas emissions at its refinery in Big Spring, Texas.""The North flare exceeded the 500 pounds sulfur dioxide RQ [reportable quantity] and Possible Opacity and carbon monoxide exceedance from the ESP [electrostatic precipitator] By-Pass Stack as a result of a process upset during a lightning storm,"" the refinery said in a statement Tuesday night to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.It said the emissions began Tuesday morning and lasted four hours.The 73,000-barrel-a-day Big Spring refinery is in west Texas, 44 miles east of Midland."
What’s happening today? Big sell off again on no news?

Analyst working together with MMs!! Great team!! This is today’s market!!
going to $3.00 soon
"TAKEOVERSomeone is going to snap this up,imho"
"The US$ 10 drop in share price is hard to explain, we still have the Midland to Brent crude oil differential if not higher than a month ago! One thing is for sure, DK should have great cash flow and the stock drop despite buy backs suggests we either overlook a tremendous factor or just can't belief the opportunity to buy the stock""Uzi Yemin, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Delek said, “We believe that Delek US is well positioned to benefit from the trends in the market with the current Midland to Brent crude oil differential and has the ability to generate significant cash flow that builds on our strong financial position"""
"Don’t know much about the company but the more I read about it the more it seems to be undervalued with over 10% dividend. Bought over 30,000 shares at 11.97 which is less than ichan paid in March 2020. Will hold this for a longtime."
Dividend 0.31 announced 5.35% ex-dividend 3/9/20 payable 3/24/20 should raise it at least $1.20 next week.
DK reached a new 52 Week High at 36.94
If relief comes this will be $30 very soon!!!! HOLD strong!! BUYY
DK is up 12.11% to 38.15
DK reached a new 52 Week High at 40.78
Buy buy buy
DK reached a new 52 Week High at 41.73
I can’t log on to Ameritrade. Must be crashing. Wanted to trade.
Dividend increased ___ It's about time...Takes some of the pain away from owning this barker___
Now ALDW ALJ and DK are combined in just one company!!! They should be valued much higher!!!!
HOLD strong!!!
We are worse than in pandemic times
"DK has some of the best managers in the business. The stock is undervalued, the company is buying back stock, and the Board is shareholder friendly. The company has a track record of acquiring undervalued and complementary assets."
Distribution eliminated. Lol. Cheers!
Up today and hope this continues. Over 30% down in a month has to be some technical trading vs reality. With vaccines around the corner the upside potential is tremendous for this stock. Will see
"CVI just issued a 20% special dividend for the quarter. $2,30 per share and .10 new shares for every share held. DK is a much better company in my opinion so let's hope Management follows suit with a large distribution."
"Up nearly 10% since buying 36424 shares at 11.73 over a week. Still undervalued a lot. Sold Aal today so I could buy more of DK but will wait for a pullback. Also have Hal, 17468 shares. Up a lot today like DK but Dk is better with 10% dividend. Rising oil price definitely helping. More room to go up. Sold Aal today so have a lot of cash. Hope to own over 100,000 shares of Dk with 10% dividends over next 2-3 months."
DK reached a 52 Week low at 25.84
Now have 51410 shares at avg 10.77. This is my largest holding which is up 39%. With rising oil prices and vaccines Dk can be $18-20 by early 2021. My second largest holding is Kimco which I have 42414 shares. Up 35% and pays 4% dividends. This also can be $20 by December.
Dividend bumped up to 20¢ from 15¢ quarterly. I don't see it as enough to keep shareholders happy unless the appreciation side kicks in hard enough to present a large pot of gold.
"I wonder if Delek is selling a large quantity of their stock so they can buy it back at a much lower price? I wouldn't put it past them. I'm still wondering what happened to my ALON dividend when DELEK bought them out!wish I would have waited three more days when I bought at $47.69. seriously thinking about buying some more now. I feel it will likely go up around $15. per share from todays low which has gone up around $1. from todays' low.As for the hurricane, I don't think they have a refinery, filling station, retail store, asphalt plant, or any other assets any where near the East coast."
I’m a CVI shareholder. Been one since 2013. I have been a a DK holder in the past. I happen to like DK better than CVI. Can’t speak for any one else at CVI but l’ll be holding my DK to see how they preform. I’m not going to dump them just because CVI don’t want them anymore. I’m glad DK held their ground against CVI.
Sold my gold stocks and bought more Dk. Now have 42758 shares at 10.47. This is my largest holding. Probably buy more if it falls.
"I work for Delek they are going through a major outage at their Big Spring refinery for 2 months, means no revenue from the most profitable refinery, margins will be hurt I think Stock may see the year lows."
"DK now down by over 8% in a week, looks like I am late in booking profit..not able to find any bad news on it though...Hold or Sell ???"

This is roaring ahead now; but it's partner DKL is down in spite of dividend increase to $.77/q? Mr. Market is very inconsistent.
"What's wrong with this stock? anyone, any up-dates?MGMT don't seem to have any motivation to share info to save themselves."
"Took some profits Friday and sold 10,000 shares. Bought gold & Vz which pays over 4% dividends Still have 43909 shares at avg 10.9. Will buy back if it falls. New acquisitions cvi and oxy doing great. REIT stocks have cooled down somewhat as opposed to oil stocks but still bullish. Began to diversify more. Also added crm."
The funds are doing their quarter end window dressing. This should go up next week. Buy now at discount.
I doubled my position
"Go online to the Texas State Securities Board. You'll find a complaint form. Send it in snail mail. You'll find the critical points covering my own complaint at the ALDW board at IHUB. My name there is Jugs.I'd formerly held 23,500 units which were imnensely profitable as I bought beginning a month following the IPO in 2014.Calling Investor Relations did nothing good as the man in charge -Keith Johnson- made it clear there would be no further distributions because of the February 7th signing closing the merger. I explained that distributions due me preceeded that date. He was unable to say anything. He said he'd have ""legal"" contact me. This was Monday. Today is Friday. I didn't expect the call and doubt they will be calling.My background is in Investor Relations. I've never seen this ugly style before. I'm shocked that DK never issued a public statement stating there'd be no more distributions. ALDW has always provided guidance."
"Every evening I now go to posts found in stock picks of mine, looking for #$%$ from ""awesome stocks"" and ""stockdork.""These are probably not sexy ladies! My hunch is that they aren't people at all, just computer mock-ups intended to appear human by opening with comments such as:""OMG! I just found ......"" And then this fictitious person launches the phony promotion.Nearly every evening some of my dozen portfolio members are cluttered with promotions such as above.I hate these things! I feel great satisfaction when I'm able to get rid of some of these leaches. I hope others here will help, too.The trick I'm doing is to click the contributor's name as that often reveals the same message is going to nearly all of my picks. In a sense I'm going after the archer more than the arrow.Please help, won't you? If we work together we can make this a far better site for well intentioned input.Len"
Citi downgrades stock it goes up....got love these manipulators...

"I think the market is tired of going up, the good employment data did absolutely nothing to move the needle, the investors who made a lot of money the past 4 days the market went up, are looking from the outside to see what happens to the stimulus package, is just my opinion, good luck"
today should be the point dk reverses it's down slide trend in recent several months.
Can someone explain to me why it is the only one that is going down in the refinery sector?
"Up 38% with over 200k profits in Dk, up 35% with over 150k profits in Kim. My retirement account up over 150% since March. Might go 200% by year end."
"Peter68, only these items below will move these stocks .1.Vaccine Approval (By end of October)2.Merger New (CVI has deadline by Sep 15 th)3.Buying assets on the cheap(There is one refinery in Montana for sale )"
chickens gave it all back
"Delek US announced that its Board of Directors had declared its regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share. Shareholders of record on August 21, 2018 will receive this cash dividend payable on September 4, 2018.During the second quarter 2018, Delek US repurchased 371,271 shares for approximately $20.0 million, with an average price of $53.87 per share. There's cash north of $ 1B.At current prices dividend yield to rise, DK to continue repurchase program"
Great Q3! Will see huge up tomorrow！
We know there is a correction but MMS have been bleeding out this company since May
I just went into those ugly posts chronicling docstork and awesonestocks and red flagged them. I also went into the phony names and flagged all their input
Incredible earnings report! Delek is much more valuable long term staying independent. Hope no buyout anytime soon.
DK is up 4.98% to 48.90
When analysts say earnings are not going to be good that means a BEAT is coming!!
Weakness In Share Price Explained Shares of DK are tracking the Midland differential .Sunrise Pipelines is coming online next month .There is lot of volatility in Midland Differential .It is less then six dollars for the month of November .Look below .https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/energy/crude-oil/wts-argus-vs-wti-calendar-spread-swap-futures_quotes_settlements_futures.html
Caught this one at 10/share . Going to be a nice little pay day in the near future
"Some 26 vaccines are being tested in different phases, of which six are in phase 3, reaffirmed the OMS."
DK Management should use 1/2 of its cash to buy back stock instead of spending on pipelines.It would be a great investment.
Now have 48729 shares. Very bullish with vaccines which should be approved this month. 15-20 by year end.
Everything was shorted today
"OK I own a lot of DK and am down a lot, so here is the good news:They reported $1.50 per share LOSS on a non GAAP basis, but they earned $1.18 per share on a GAAP basis, which is the real reported numbers the CPA's use in reporting. That handily beat the estimated numbers and even beat by a penny the preceding year's per share earnings. Why the big difference ? The GAAP reported numbers include depreciation and huge carry forward losses that write off against taxes, etc.So the accounting types are buying today and the headline reading types are selling today. look for a bounce back tomorrow. PS: Their drop down company with the logistics just continues to perform great and by next quarter will be even better.I am buying more today."
Just bought 2 shares about twelve days ago for about $59. Should I be concerned?
MM working together with analyst!!! Destroying stock value and shaking weak handed retail.
"I don't see any reason for this decline today, the market is rising above expectations, jobless claims declined this week, resulting in more people going back to work and consuming more gasoline, much optimism with stimulus talks, I don't see any bad news for the entire refinery sector to lose everything they earned in the morning, If anyone here knows why it would be helpful if they told me ,? thank."
Monster cheap!!!
Monster run up!! Brutal presentation exhibit!! Way way undervalued!!!
Why is this up 40 percent? Their earnings were not that great a few days ago...
"When these big falls occur and there is no justification for that, I take advantage and buy, add 4000 shares at $ 15.91, good luck"
Dk takeover?Im hearing that Holly Frontier and PBF looking at buying Delek. Per Goldman Sachs 50 ish Forbes 4/30/18 article
