"I am very bullish on this stock. The housing demands are very strong, given the very low interest rates and short supply in the market. It will take construction companies several years to catch up with the demands. I think this stock has potential to reach $50 by the end of the year"

Going under 15.00 for lock up
Dream Finders Homes is down 11.88% to 21.51
Lockup July 20th. Any thoughts on whether the stock price will go down at that time? I’m looking to enter a 200 share position and don’t know if it’s better to get in now or wait.
"Hello Kkatchi,I actually work in the field and sell just about all of the builders. Unfortunately, people rarely take the time to leave a positive review. I'm not saying that in this case the buyers didn't have issues...it happens. I just know that Dream Finders is very good about standing behind their homes. I can speak for Florida only but their President & CEO is really great and their management team really cares about their homes and their homeowners being happy. We could pull up reviews online on every builder and we could find some that may not be positive...In fact there are other builders (employees) who write negative reviews on their competition to disparage their competition...It's sad but true!I personally bought stock in this company because I sell more in a year than most agents in 20 years. I'm assuming that makes me qualified to provide my opinion on DF Homes. Based on my experience with Dream Finders homes I find them to be the top builder I have worked alongside here in Florida.Anytime my buyers have had any issues they have been rectified to the satisfaction of my buyers and also to me(I'm much tougher than any buyer... Much!!) when I pre walk my homes I find all kinds of punch out items...DF is always great about fixing everything I find. Additionally, you still have the builder warranty and that warranty covers everything! (Except grass...if you don't water or over fertilize it and kill it...but if you mention during the walk that the grass looks dead or dry or doesn't look good they will stand behind your lawn)long story short...If we search for BBB reviews every single one will be a bad review as thats the nature of BBB...if we yelp, google review etc... you will find folks who write positive and Negative reviews.I challenge anyone who reads this to go to the same BBB site and pull up Pulte, Lennar, Taylor Morrison, Meritage or for that matter any other builder and you will find only negative reviews.Again these are just the experiences I have had here in Florida"
"This is the nuttiest stock ever. It crashes big time after a great quarter a few months back, then has another great quarter and does nothing. Never seen anything like this before."

take what people on here say with a salt of grain. when I bought into RUTH @$7.20 a share they tried to say it will not go up again for a few years and in less than a year it back up to $19 a share. people on here Don't know much about Florida business unless they live in florida. this company will go up in a year and stay up.
this stock is not a joke it will be a stock you will want to have. I live like 45 to 50 minutes from Jacksonville and they are building place in all four Counties around like dime a dozen. And I truly think it will go up .
Anybody here live in Jacksonville?
Should I start investing in this for the future?
BOMN is a better way to invest in DFH
