"ALE is at the price level it was 5 years ago in October 2016, so I made a few buys on Wed-Fri. Did anyone else start nibbling in this 61-62 area this week? The RSI is at 22.41 and listed as oversold and buried well below the oversold range of 30.00 but a few neutral long indicators starting to show up on the chart.The growth estimates for next year look solid at 22.20% and one sentence in the August 2nd earnings report kind of jumped out at me, â€œWe view the current year as transitional, with key growth positioning initiatives underway in support of higher earnings in 2022 and beyond."" Good luck & great investing!"
