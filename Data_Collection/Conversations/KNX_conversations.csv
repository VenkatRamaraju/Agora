"Great loading zone here, strong support by the 200MA"
Knight-Swift reached a 52 Week high at 40.88
KNX earned $.71 per dililuted share.....they blew earnings out of the water.
"Hammer that net profit line. One would think if can improve on driver acquisition and retention , fuel cost relief, expanding route efficiency would all = profits = stock value increase. As Cramer says, sometimes it’s just not enough and it may not make sense even though it appears to be sensible."
this is a buy even at 52 week high
"$KNX acquired AAA Cooper LTL carrier for 1.35B. It looks like they do $871M in revenue. YELL is doing 4.5B in revenue and their market cap is $327M. You have to see there appears to be tremendous value with YELL, if anything they also make a potential buyout candidate."
$ODFL and $KNX hit new 52 week highs today too. There is no reason YELL shouldn't be participating in this. Trucking and freight are strong and will remain strong with all the port shortages and back up in the supply chain of pretty much everything.

I assume some upgrades will be coming soon with them already issuing raised guidance all the way through 2021.
The upside potential for KNX just got a whole lot more interesting. Not sure how https://newstockdorks.blogspot.com/ finds all these incredible trade ideas but im happy.
Knight-Swift is up 4.92% to 48.01
Knight-Swift Transportation reached an all time high at 54.97
You look at YELL compared to others like $ODFL $KNX $SAIA and it makes sense for someone to try to take them out on the cheap. $4.5B in revenue and the 2nd largest LTL carrier with a $300M market cap. KNX bought AAA Cooper for $1.3B and they were doing $780M a year in revenue.
Bank of America Corp DE Trims Position in Knight-Swift Transportation Holdingshttps://technewsobserver.com/news/2019/10/10/knight-swift-transportation-holdings-inc-nyseknx-shares-sold-by-bank-of-america-corp-de-updated-updated.html
It’s an earning beat and the stock is crashing!!! Can someone explain this?
Great buying opportinity.. 22% upside!!! Argus target $109 and Wall St Journal $99!!! $ARCB recognized as most efficient and best supply chain logistics and trucking company!! Great Forward PE of 11!! Reporting excellent earnings results on Nov 2!!!$ODFL $KNX $SAIA $JBHT $LSTR $SNDR $MRTN $SNDR
"Just a lucky guess, right? Whatever..."
"This company when you look at EV/EBITDA and free cash flow yield is cheap. My question is why they have lagged the other trucking companies in performance, and should I expect them to catch up at some point? This is without a doubt the cheapest of the trucking companies right now. Most of the others trade at a premium now."
Strong momentum!!!:DDDhttps://investor.knight-swift.com/sites/knighttrans.investorhq.businesswire.com/files/event/additional/FirstQuarter2020EarningsRelease.pdf
"KNX is a solid play that is getting sold on light volume. A very good buying ppty to a company tied to continued economic growth. P/E at 14.8, good growth, runs lean and double bottom pattern is nice. Let's start the next wave up to $45.00!"
"Shares trading above the 200-day, just had a golden cross, PEG ratio below 1.0, book value practically the same as current share price, domestic economy remains strong, trade deal more likely than not before the end of the year, and 28-million shares shorted that will be re-purchased as the shares continue to trend higher. I've been aggressively buying shares here in the low 30's. If wrong, would cut losses just below $30, but, I suspect we'll be in the low 40's by summer and the shorts could push back towards $50 when they cover their positions."
Positive technical buying signal. Long over 38.48. Target: 47.91 at 9trading. http://www.foxchart.com/share/136742558.png
What is this new investigation regarding? The law firm investigating provided an email address that doesn’t even work and no one picks up their phones when you call in. Any info would be appreciated!
investigation is ambulance chasers looking to get your money for phony suit
"Best technical stock I’ve ever seen, a buy in mid 33s"
"other trucking companies are doing well like ODFL, SAIA why is KNX lagging?"
Comparing this to other valuations of trucking companies like $ODFL and $SAIA $JBHT $SNDR and $KNX it seems like YELL trades super low considering the fleet/revenue
The merger should make this a winner long term. Seeing some rough price action these last few weeks however hopeful that their lower guidance for next quarter earnings sets them up for a nice beat
Knight-Swift Transportation is up 5.87% to 53.73
Very fishy that this stock declined 10percent a day before reporting a earnings miss...down 13percent after hours.
Driver shortage...rising fuel costs
"$KNX got upgraded today, should bode well for YELL"
$35 by the end of this week. IMHO
go back up to $36
"This stock is frustrating, every time it hits 34 it seems to hit a major wall of resistance no matter what the circumstances. Even after a huge beat last quarter."
Oct-25-21 Upgrade UBS Neutral → Buy $51 → $65
I don't understand why the sell out when the most of analysts are raising the price target.
"big demand for trucking and home depot and railroads because of the hurricane ;;;put your money there ,really"
"The one point of concern is someone like $ODFL $SAIA $ARCB or $KNX (who already is on a recent acquisition spree) try to take out YELL on the cheap. The 2nd largest LTL carrier even with debt at $2B here, compare it to the market caps of the others, plus there would be operational synergies too."
surprised not more ppl following here....merger gonna make this a huge winner long term
