Instead they should thank this management who decided not to follow an easy way like their competitors .

Pleasantly surprised to see RIG above 3.5 on Friday. I hope it stays there or go even higher.

"Transocean (NYSE: RIG) stock got a big jolt on the morning of Aug. 3 and tumbled 12% by 10 a.m. EDT. At a time when pockets of the oil and gas industry are making money off this year's rally in oil prices, Transocean's contract drilling revenue slumped 29.4% year over year and its adjusted net loss ballooned to $109 million from $1 million in Q2 2020. Although consensus estimates called for a loss, the sharp drop in Transocean's revenue caught the market off guard."
Transocean is the winner! We are going up to 10$ great company!!!

"Keep it simple. Going forward RIG will trade with the whole energy sector. Last 3 weeks the whole sector got killed. Once delta is under control next 3 weeks the whole sector will fly. In my opinion earnings will not make much of a difference going forward. Look at XOM, MTDR and CVX. They had solid quarters yet they went down. What matters is where oil is heading next 6 months. I say $80"

You shorts can keep trying to keep this down but let me ask you this. Are you betting millions that this stock is going lower ? Insiders are betting millions that it's going up soon. That's a fact.
$7.3 BILLION $$$ backlog will translate into a share price if higher than $8.00 per share in the coming days/weeks.
"Today was a bear raid. What Is a Bear Raid?A bear raid is an illegal practice of colluding to push a stock's price lower through concerted short selling, while spreading negative rumors about the shorted company. A bear raid is sometimes undertaken by unscrupulous short sellers who want to make a quick buck from their short positions, leveraging social media platforms and online message boards."
"We are slowly...but persistently...crushing every road block and barrier to surviving our debt problem. I will be here when RIG trades over 20 bucks and the market for rigs will be sold out for the next 5 years.

Transocean is up 9.29% to 3.23
I say with solid API/EIA numbers this week we should go over $4. Patience
"No sign of Austin, Nancy, Kathy or the MB ID changing, post history DELETING ""self proclaimed"" BILLIONAIRE?To be expected as they were ALL completely WRONG on RIG's 2nd qtr performance and stock direction."

Great earning report. Very positive comments. Good luck to all.

Reaction at open tells you rates on that announced contract were not impressive
how can it crash that much in a few hours?

"We shall be patient on RIG, as long as the oil price keep holding at 70s, and more contracts will come."

Brazil offshore is booming...PBR just announced 10% cash dividend with more to come as debt plunges amid gusher cash flow. 100% deep water offshore presale...they should be signing up more rigs soon

Closing green an Friday 6?
"From Transocean (RIG) Q2 2021 Earnings Call TranscriptThese data points firmly corroborate our belief that we are in the beginning of an up cycle in the offshore drilling industry. As the world continues to rebound from the global pandemic, the need for hydrocarbons is increasing, which in turn dictates that more exploration and production is needed. Looking forward, we are encouraged by the relative stability in oil prices. They've remained well above $60 per barrel since early February and more recently above $70 per barrel.And as a result of the recent production agreement between OPEC and its allies, we expect this new pricing floor to be highly constructive and attractive for future investment from our customers. As the COVID-19 vaccines are distributed around the world, we expect that global demand for hydrocarbons will continue to recover. However, we are pragmatic, the timing of the global recovery may be a bit more fluid given the COVID variants that are circulating. Yet we've already witnessed as COVID cases diminish, economic activity returns, and so does the need for hydrocarbons.Most importantly, we believe our customers also share our view. Their confidence in improving oil market fundamentals has resulted in accelerated planning for new or previously sideline projects, many of which are expected to commence later this year or early next year. Taking a closer look around the global market. Starting in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we continue to see an extremely tight market with only one available asset as we enter 2022, and the very real possibility that this market could be entirely sold out of active and marketable rigs by year-end. Several of our recent pictures for our seventh gen assets are now near or above $300,000 a day, reflecting the improving market and the obvious scarcity of active high-specification assets. We expect this trend to continue through 2022 with relatively few assets available in the region. It's worth noting that we are not only responding to more tenders, we are also engaging in far more direct negotiations, particularly with customers operating in the Gulf of Mexico."
Can somebody explain to me why RIG only has a price to book value of 0.19? That seems extremely low to me but I cannot figure out why.
"$CPE an unmitigated disaster, a lost cause because of again overpaying for Primexx on top of their already huge debt and diluting shareholders. Stock price has nowhere to go but down. Ditto for $LPI, pulled off the same stunt in Apr-May. None of these companies give a hoot about public investors or institutions. Its a good thing Blackrock, Vanguard, State Street, Fidelity, GS, MS are forcibly starving oil companies of capital and choking their growth. Financial restructuring is incredibly cleansing and liberating for all involved esp. their horrible managements. Some like $BORR, $RIG, $GTE will file sooner or later."
Goldman S Thursday still maintain oil at $80 by end of year. OPEC will not increase supply they said as JB suggested
Is it possible report that insiders are buying at $ 4 + was a manipulation of markets.
"Children return from vacation, adults return to work. The demand for rope is increasing. Rig will increase to $ 5!"

anyone else playing the 2pm dip?
They had some interesting insights about RIG on (http://Thetraderguide.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.

"The earnings are not great but they are good. Operating cash flows have significantly improved due to increase in operating efficiencies, which is good going forward. Once institutions start buying in couple of days, RIG should go over 4 dollars soon."

"""Due to high levels of underinvestment and a consistent lack of reserve replacement by operators in recent years, we expect an accelerated effort to replenish reserves in the near and medium-term. Additional industry consolidation has also led to the retirement of assets and a constricting of supply that is likely to continue, as newly-restructured peers look to reduce unnecessary costs, meaning a limited number of assets will be addressing new demand. Given this context, we think Transocean’s high-grade assets will become more valuable over time."""
"Feeling very comfortable being long at these levels. Personally projecting a reasonably steady path to over 5 during the next few months. A few things go our way and we might blow right past 5. Long, optimistic, and patient."

"In the TV adaptation of Ray Bradbury's Martian Chronicles an astronaut lands on Mars and through telepathy the Martians convince him that he's in his old home town, years earlier. His dead brother and dead parents greet him. It's all so that the Martians can kill him with poison. That night he's lying in bed in his old bedroom with his brother in the same room. Then he starts to think, ""maybe we really did land on Mars and all of this is a lie"". Suddenly he starts to feel sick, poisoned by what he thought was pudding. One of the last things he says to his brother (whom he now knows is a Martian) is ""you couldn't disguise the air"". The thin Martian air is what gave it away. Well, the media crums can't disguise the price of crude. That's controlled by supply and demand. So unless the crums can crash the economy on Delt@ fears then oil stocks will rise. I'm not saying that the crums can't crash our economy. But hopefully the @merican people won't let them do it again. $CDEV $LPI $RIG"
Thank you doge coin. Unreal this gamble is better than the leader in offshore drilling.

"Oil demand at new record as inventory rapidly declinesThu, July 8, 2021, 3:17 PMPavel Molchanov, Raymond James Energy Analyst, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the OPEC+ meeting, demand in oil, and oil production.This is an excellent Video Transcript- I want to ask about US crude, if you think that we could see an uptick there in that production.PAVEL MOLCHANOV: Well as far as supply in the US and, indeed, just about anywhere outside of OPEC, that's not likely at all in the next six months. Capital budgets across the board this year by oil companies are the lowest they've been in decades. Maybe that will change in '22. We will find out at the end of the year.But as it stands, we're not looking for US supply or Brazilian supply or North Sea supply to pick up for quite a while. The entire industry is so fixated on discipline-- capital discipline, supply discipline. So OPEC countries have the ability to ramp production back up at their discretion, but in the US the rig count is at a level where there's just not going to be production growth in the foreseeable future.- And just last one for you here. I think this is the question that so many folks are really wondering because a lot of consumers have been paying a lot of attention to what's been happening to oil lately because they've been feeling the pain at the pump, so to speak. So let's just ask, how much longer you think that that could continue?PAVEL MOLCHANOV: Well, I'll take a step back and say that US consumers actually have it really good when it comes to fuel prices, globally speaking. Yes, of course, prices are higher than they were a year ago or two years ago. But compared to what their counterparts pay across Europe, in Japan and Australia, it's much cheaper. Even in California, the most expensive gasoline, it's cheaper.So if demand gradually recovers to pre-COVID levels by, let's say, next summer and OPEC continues to ramp production back up, we think that the price of crude, the main determinant of gasoline, obviously, will be flattish to slightly up from current levels. And it's worth pointing out, the commodity market is actually signaling that prices will go down from current levels. We disagree. We think prices are more likely to be higher, not dramatically, but maybe a little higher by the end of the year than they are today.IIII$CDEV $XEC $SM $MTDR $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $KOS $VET $CVX $XOM $SUN $WLL $OAS $EOG $COG $APA $RIG $CVEO"
What happens with RIG? RIG Last quarter results were bad and the price went down. This time the Stock price is very low before results. Rumors say insiders are buying and why are we at 3.60.?Tumorrow a lot of 3.50 calls are expiring. To inform about new contracts yesterday was probably Thigpen who tried to push up the price before result. This probably knowing that the price will drop after results.
Who’s accumulating more shares this month. Me or insiders???
"You guys do know that RIG is basically the Last one standing in the OSD sector rite? The other such as VAL NE DO , may have clean balance sheets BUT do not have much liquidity or assets to steal any business. Now, shld the offshore drilling cycle upturns as it obvsly is doing..... there is only 1 company that can do that. RIG."
29 million shares traded today following the money ... Something going on!
"One of the biggest deepwater drillers, Transocean, (NYSE:RIG) notes in an investor packet that in the next few years a number of opportunities could be spun from the success of the Anchor (sanctioned) project and the North Platte and Shenandoah projects (nearing sanction)."
Apparently I'm 100% of the 07/23 Put volume on RIG. Why would anyone think with OPEC control of the industry and a White House that has pushed for EV development to the extent that they would shut down domestic pipeline's that the most costly and environmentally risky method of producing more oil would somehow become profitable?This is from a guy who built most of his retirement account on being a long term COP holder.
There were 15 insider buys by 3 insiders in June for 25.8 million shares at prices ranging from $3.97 to $4.40.
"This could be why oil companies have crashed so badly over the past month:Today or yesterday Harry mentioned that the price of oil may only be falling relative to the dollar, maybe it's doing well against the Euro etc. Maybe the dollar is rising, or maybe there's just a fear that the dollar is going to rise. Here's why: A coming deflationary period is possible for the dollar. One indication is the FED Tapering. They're talking about starting it in September.""Tapering is the reduction of the rate at which a central bank accumulates new assets on its balance sheet under a policy of QE."" In other words they reduce the rate at which they are pumping cash into the market buy purchasing treasury bills, notes and bonds, quantitative easing.""Tapering is the first step in the process of either winding down—or completely withdrawing from—a monetary stimulus program that has already been executed.""They have been saying that they're not going to raise interest rates but that doesn't matter because there will be less cash going into the system and that means less money for banks to loan out...higher interest rates to you and me.Dollars will be harder to get.One thing, tapering has been attempted in the past, but every major economy that has tried it has ended up backing down and returned to easy money in a hurry. But the fear of tapering, and the fear of the rising dollar that it will bring may be what has caused the mess that we've seen over the past month. #LPI #RIG #MRO #MTDR"
"$BORR, $GTE, $KOS, $RIG are probable bankruptcy candidates in the future. Shorting could be a profitable play with not much risk if hedged with puts/calls (short or long dated needs to be carefully chosen).

These companies managements are solely to blame - worst in class always leads to epic fail in any situation."
"Oil futures remained under pressure Wednesday after the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude inventories fell by 400,000 barrels last week.

"Everybody knows RIG is going to win that bid for SDRL right? That was the 2nd bid in less than a month.

Oil prices have risen almost 50% this year as U.S. refineries run close to full-bore to keep up with fuel demand.

"@Value_Riskman trading this low because of current world events.. turmoil in the Middle East and fears of 2nd lockdowns coming. Thanks to the democrat liberals. 20M plus means something. Something we most likely know nothing about. I’d say it’s a very good thing for share holders. Everyone wants to see $10 now! People don’t understand that you shouldn’t invest with money you don’t have !!! That’s Patrick’s problem. If you invest 10 grand you should prepared to lose 10 grand… or it could turn into 15,20, 25. Remember anything is possible. MSFT was a $30 stock - 14 years ago. Still holding my position. Where will RIG be in 14 years @ a $3 dollar entry. But, at these buy in prices and patience is going reap great profits in due time. Just think insiders would not be buying, if they believed that the gig is up and we’re headed to zero. To me insiders purchasing this kind of volume means buy and hang tight."

"Gas prices are set to climb another 20 cents a gallon this summerStephanie Asymkos: Tue, July 6, 2021, 7:00 PMPump prices are climbing with summer travel in full swing with little relief in sight.Through August, motorists could see the national average rise another 10 to 20 cents, according to AAA, putting the national average over $3.25 per gallon this summer.“Robust gasoline demand and more expensive crude oil prices are pushing gas prices higher,” said Jeanette McGee, AAA spokesperson.The predictions come after U.S. gasoline demand set a new pandemic-era high over the Fourth of July, with national demand rising by 4.7%, according to GasBuddy. The national average is up over 3 cents since last week, and as of Tuesday, the national average stands at $3.12 per gallon, according to GasBuddy.U.S. gasoline demand set a new pandemic-era high over Fourth of July, with national demand rising by 4.7%. (REUTERS/Mike Blake)U.S. gasoline demand set a new pandemic-era high over Fourth of July, with national demand rising by 4.7%. (REUTERS/Mike Blake)“Gasoline demand over the holiday weekend certainly did not disappoint as millions of Americans flooded the roads for the long weekend, guzzling down gasoline at a clip not seen in years,” Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis for GasBuddy, said in a press release. “In the process, we could have set new all-time records for consumption.”Aside from demand stateside, geopolitical tensions are putting upward pressure on prices for crude oil, the raw material used to make gasoline. The meeting among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was canceled this week after a dispute between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over the cartel's oil production.“We had hoped that global crude production increases would bring some relief at the pump this month, but weekend Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) negotiations fell through with no agreement reached,” McGee said. “Crude prices are set to surge to a seven-year high.""Another factor that could affect prices is the June-to-November hurricane season in the Atlantic when the U.S. crude oil market moves when there are interruptions in Gulf Coast production.For the country’s cheapest fill-up, southern states Mississippi ($2.73), Louisiana ($2.75), and South Carolina ($2.79), lead the way. The country’s most expensive gas can be found on the West Coast: California ($4.29), Hawaii ($3.96), and Washington ($3.79).“For now, with imbalances in supply and demand continuing, motorists will continue digging deeper to pay for gasoline as prices are likely headed nowhere but up until global supply starts to catch up with the surge in demand,” said De Haan.DIAMOND HANDS...HODL!IIII$CDEV $XEC $SM $MTDR $SU $OXY $MRO $LPI $KOS $VET $CVX $XOM $SUN $WLL $OAS $EOG $COG $APA $RIG"

"Last couple of months insiders bought $108 million worth of shares in the low $4’s. Just watch as more Drama hits the Market, like “supply constraints, etc.” Oil will eventually hit $80 per Barrel and #RIG will be over $6. Today’s prices are merely a Buy Opportunity!"

$5+ by the end of the month. adding more rig! go rig!
It looks like the insiders buy at $4 and above was a set up to trap small investors. Now we will have to sit on this for a long time to recover your money. Never trust those insiders.. So sad.

The July 30 Call Option at $4 Strike is at $0.03. Stock is only 37.5 cents away from $4. I could see someone load up in these cheap calls (see today's volume) and try to push the common 10% higher for massive profit on options. At $4.09 the Call buyers pretty much TRIPLES his money.

"Note how many rigs are stacked and corresponding ages, does their carrying book value truly recognize their potential earning power. Will those rigs work again or has RIG been able to play the accounting game deferring actual asset impairments? Just a guess up to $5/sh. Then there is the going concern question. They've made some excellent financial moves, how many moves are left to extend the debt runway? Can the drilling market improve sufficiently and quickly enough to assist cashflow. Can they beat the clock."
"This is one of the largest manipulation of the market. We are definitely consuming more oil and fuel than we did in March but oil is down. we haven't ramped up production and the whole market is open. The powers at B keep referring to what ""MAY"" happen but not focusing on what is happening"

"STEINHAUSEN, Switzerland, Aug. 26, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Transocean Ltd. (NYSE: RIG) announced today that BOE Exploration & Production LLC (“BOE”) awarded Transocean a $252 million firm contract for its newbuild ultra-deepwater drillship, the Deepwater Atlas, including a mobilization fee of $30 million. Additionally, the contract provides for a significant performance bonus opportunity based upon agreed operating metrics.This award results from the final investment decision of BOE and the Shenandoah working interest owners to sanction the previously announced Shenandoah project in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.The Shenandoah program comprises two phases. Once delivered from the shipyard, the Deepwater Atlas is expected to commence operations in the third quarter of 2022, initially using dual blowout preventers (“BOP”) rated to 15,000 psi. The initial drilling program is expected to last approximately 255 days and result in approximately $80 million of contract drilling revenue."
Opened at 3.633 hope this goes up a bit.
2 new contracts in the gulf. I almost sold part of my shares today too.
The issue which reinforces my belief that this stock is ready for a breakout is the insider buys. If I am mistaken please tell me. But I thought these were outright purchases and not stock option awards.

"""Market Thirsty For Oil""Thomas Hum: Yahoo FinanceThu, July 15, 2021, 11:58 AM·As for longer term expectations for energy as the world economy recovers from the pandemic, Tsakos Energy Navigation (TNP) COO George V. Saroglou said that he remains hopeful for the oil market, citing OPEC’s diligent management of the collapse in demand, continued restoration of oil barrel production levels, and a market “thirsty for oil.”“Oil demand is recovering from the monumental losses of last year. And after a strong demand growth year in 2021, experts now see a return to the pre-COVID demand levels by next year,” Saroglou said.The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasted in June that global crude oil demand will return to its pre-pandemic high during the final quarter of 2022. Subsequently, carbon emissions have seen a significant rebound, in spite of many wealthy countries accelerating their push towards greater wind and solar utilization.Thomas Hum is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

Transocean great company. Soon they will have new bigger contract! Oil prices will go up in a long term.

"Offshore staffHAMILTON, Bermuda – Seadrill had three harsh environment rigs operating in the North Sea by mid-year, the company revealed in its latest results statement.The semisubmersible West Hercules continued work for Equinor while the jackups West Elara and West Linus have both been on long-term contracts with ConocoPhillips. In addition, the semisub West Phoenix was mobilizing for a new contract offshore Norway with Vår Energi.Three drillships were operating off the Americas., with the West Neptune under contract to Talos Energy in the Gulf of Mexico, and the West Tellus and West Saturn working off Brazil for Petrobras and ExxonMobil, respectively.In addition, the semisubmersible Sevan Louisiana is contracted to operate for Walter Oil and Gas in the US GoM and the drillship West Gemini should start work off Angola later in the year.As for Seadrill’s jackups, the AOD I, AOD III, and West Callisto continued operations in the Middle East for Saudi Aramco, with AOD II also resuming work on July 1.The West Castor, West Telesto, and West Tucana were on bareboat charter to Seadrill’s joint venture in Qatar, GulfDrill.The company has sold the jackup West Vigilant and terminated the lease for the semisub West Taurus (both long-term cold stacked rigs) and more recently completed the sale of the jackup West Freedom and entered agreements to recycle five other long-term cold-stacked units.Equinor has awarded the Aquadrill drillship West Vela a new contract in the US GoM, with Seadrill set to continue managing the rig until mid-2022.Confidence is picking up among oil company clients in terms of budgeting capital, triggering an upturn in future rig demand, especially for benign environment floaters.During the first half of 2021 opportunities increased for floaters, especially drillships, with take-up in the traditional ‘golden triangle’ across the Atlantic Ocean breaching 80%.However, demand for harsh environment floaters fell, in part due to rigs rolling off contract.Seadrill expects the harsh environment jackup segment to be stable going forward due mainly to award of longer-term contracts and a lower number of contractors operating in the segment.08/20/2021"
"Transocean (NYSE: RIG) fell 20% in July as lower oil prices soured investor sentiment on oil production and exploration stocks. No bad news came out in the month about Transocean, specifically, but lower-than-expected crude oil prices could threaten the company's financial performance in the coming quarters. Crude oil spot prices recovered throughout the first half of 2021, and the West Texas Intermediate spot price was above $75 per barrel entering July."

"Owning a 60% interest, Shell Offshore Inc. will operate Whale. Chevron U.S.A. Inc.

The company added the development will use energy-efficient gas turbines and compression systems.Shell’s 12th deepwater GOM host, Whale’s projected peak production will be approximately 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day, Shell stated. The company also noted the development, slated to begin production in 2024, currently boasts an estimated recoverable resource volume of 490 million boe.Discovered in 2017, Whale will use a semi-submersible production host in more than 8,600 feet (2,621 meters) of water with 15 oil-producing wells, Shell noted. The field’s production facility – in Alaminos Canyon Block 773 and adjacent to the Shell-operated Silvertip field – closely replicates the four-column semi-submersible host facility for Vito, which is scheduled to start production next year, the company added.

Maybe thigpen has a plan buy seadrill assets using more debt issue more shares talk about what a great buying opportunity. Then go on about how oil is going to recover future looks rosy. Then eventually file bk blame it all on covid keeping oil consumption down. Shareholders will be wiped out but he will have a lot of new shiny toys that he got from seadrill and because of bk he basically got them for nothing. To hell with the shareholders

Had Beacon offshore announced the drillship contract with RIG?
"The timing of the PR wasn't optimal but we now have data points and a commitment. The rates aren't exceptional but may be a bird-in-hand decision. Keep in mind this is a billion dollar asset and using simple math, OE&M may run around 50 pct (RIG on average is in the low 60s), the initial contribution will be in the 150s per day. Assuming a 30 yr life, payback is around 95k per day, WACC according to 3rd party sources is 10-15 pct. The investment needs the $450 day rate to even get close. Committed til Q1 2024, appears it will take about two months to upgrade the equipment mid contract. By 2024, how many competitors could have 20k psi ability? The upside, cash flow."
Why is it going higher today
Very good buying opportunity
Not worried. Delta V took over the oil market. Once delta is under control RIG will have a run to $6. Hold

"Q3 will essentially be a repeat of Q2. Breakeven looks to be around $900M+. Rig needs to start showing some real progress on the contracting front (granted 2022-23 activity), not just lip service, longer term contracts with some meat on the bone. Beacon also needs to make a commitment or RIG should move on, assuming there is truly other interest in the rig. Why continue to push delivery, put the asset to work. Also having to rely on the ATM program to supplement cash may be necessary but disappointing, makes one question flaws in GAAP when management/BOD can justify selling shares at a 75+pct discount to book. Of course cashflow rules."

"Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Independent Director Frederik Mohn for US$21m worth of shares, at about US$4.20 per share.

We do always like to see insider buying, but it is worth noting if those purchases were made at well below today's share price, as the discount to value may have narrowed with the rising price. The good news for Transocean share holders is that insiders were buying at near the current price."
"The pullback in oil stock valuations was far more drastic than the drop in the price of WTI. I think that earnings are about to start mattering. IMHO even if crude prices stayed the same, CPE, $CDEV, $LPI, $MRO, $MTDR $REI and drillers like $RIG and $KLXE would have risen unless Delta got really bad. That was a blow off bottom, so to speak."

Borr Drilling Secures Contracts for Rig Duo in W. Africa
"""For buyers, acting now means they could scoop up all Seadrill's assets without taking on any of its debt pile.""Massive consolidation of the industry, while simultaneously eliminating the low-ball operator. Todo esta bien."
Sold my tobacco shares last Friday to either double down Transocean or Clover. Luckily I chose Transocean.
JP Morgan oil analyst just said oil at $80 by end of year. Means RIG at $7 or higher.

"Thigpen concluded: “As we enter the back half of this year, we remain encouraged by the upcycle that is currently unfolding. Assuming oil prices remain supportive, we see utilization and dayrates for our ultra-deepwater assets materially improving as we move into 2022.”"

"NEW YORK CITY – Offshore rig contracting activity has cleared “easy” year-over-year comps for five straight months from March through July, according to Evercore’s August 2021 Offshore Rig Market Snapshot.The report notes, however, that “the streak could be at risk with 18 contracts announced for August thus far [as of August 16] tracking below the year ago total of 35.” A total of 10 jackup and eight floater contracts have been confirmed this month, as of August 16, versus a total of 19 and 16 respectively a year ago.Jackups continue to slightly outpace floaters on a contract count basis, but floaters currently make up 44% of all contracts announced year-to-date (YTD) vs. the recent peak of 39% in 2018. “More importantly on a rig-year basis,” the report notes, “floaters are on track to beat the recent 2019 peak by 13% for the best year since 2014.”With three term contracts announced for Valaris including a 3.5-year contract from TotalEnergies for the DS-11, floaters account for 68% or 8 of the 12 rig years announced this month, which is only slightly below the 17 total rig years booked a year ago, according to the report. Overall, floaters have led on a rig-year basis for three of seven months this year and account for 30% of the YTD total.“With contractors retiring another semisub and three jackups over the past month, bringing the YTD total to 16 floaters and 24 jackups, the offshore rig market recovery appears to be finally underway,” the report concludes.08/22/2021"
We won’t see Rig over $4. For long long time So I won’t buy more for now Keeps going down ???
"Beacon Shenandoah....come on, when does RIG go to work, day rate and for how long? The suspense!"
"New to Rig, opening a position here, adding as we go."
"If this goes ahead it should increase the debt to around $15bil. Never mind just stack some more rigs in the Transocean parking lots around the world. I expect the drummers on this site will say good opportunities, oil going up, green shoots and encouraging signs. Heard it all over the last 10 years"
