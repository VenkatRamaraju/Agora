"KRISTIANSAND, Norway – Nekkar subsidiary Intellilift has formed a joint venture with a subsidiary of Transocean.Inteliwell will commercialize products and services based on a solution the partners are currently developing to integrate digital systems for well construction, drilling control, and real-time data monitoring.The software solution interfaces with the drilling rig’s control system to autonomously perform tasks in the well plan, speeding up the well construction process.An integrated real-time monitoring platform measures downhole progress and evaluates conditions in the well to provide feedback to the drilling control system.Stig Trydal, managing director of Intellilift, said the partners aimed to provide software solutions (SaaS) “that allow operators to further improve the consistency of their operations while reducing drilling costs through more reliable and faster drilling operations.”10/28/2021"
"Here's a post written by this guy bjspokanimal on another (better) board.One of hundreds he's written there:More on Valaris's drillship fleet in the wake of yesterday's announcement of them unstackingthe DS-4 and drilling for approx. 1.5 years beginning next may.In late summer, Valaris had 4 active drillships and 7 stacked drillships. Since then, they've won contracts on 3, stacked units and begun unstacking them. 4 of the 7 stacked ships wereconsidered, by Valaris, to be quadrant-1 (within highest 25% of all drillships) quality and 3of those 4 are the ones being unstacked (the DS-4 was launched in 2010).So, valaris considers only 1 of the remaining stacked drillships to be quadrant-1.Scanning any articles on the DS-4 contract, None of them divulged the dayrate Valaris willreceive. I'm certain they would have divulged it if it was very good. Valaris has demonstratedso far that they're willing to unstack rigs under contracts that are less lucrative than what any of the other drillers would accept... except maybe Maersk. Separately, Northern drilling, a seadrill spinoff, has canceled the last of 3, 7th generationdrillships they had on order, leaving Northern with no rigs (so, I'm wondering if the companywill liquidate).Given the number of mostly-constructed ships now in shipyards with no owner, I'm wonderingwho might pick some of them up while they could still be picked up cheap.Seadrill's entire fleet is now valued at less than $2 billion. Some of the rapid decline in theirfleets value is attributable to their reduced earning power but the rest of it reflects poormaintenance of stacked rigs during their 2 bankruptcies.Valaris sold off and/or scrapped all the rigs they couldn't afford to maintain during theirbankruptcy, which accounts for the better quality of the remaining 7 drillships mentioned above.Finally, just a reminder that Transocean possesses a lot of tax loss carryovers from years ofnet losses. Once the company turns profitable, those carryovers will help RIG to minimize itstax expenses and amplify it's cash flow."
"The short interest in this stock has begun to decline, but still is held at almost 9% or 58 million shares. It won't take much on the earnings call to drive the stock over $5.00 costing the shorts about $70 million with oil near $85 the chance of RIG failing are pretty much over and I would think the largest short holder started at about the $10 per share level. I am loaded with calls which are cheap."
"All this from BAD PRESS!!From the only reporter not to insist Transocean was going bankrupt in 2020!! Find another article in April 2020 that DID NOT call for Transocean to be bankrupt?? They got it WRONG!!!https://seekingalpha.com/article/4459920-transocean-stock-is-trading-low-given-the-energy-crisisNOW THERE IS REAL VALUE HERE!!We chatted the other day about value indicators. Why I think Transocean will correct at some point. If your holding fine. But trading in and out might leave you behind.Try this for a comparison method.Valaris employs 3400approx. Transocean around 5400.Divide Valaris market cap by emplyee numbers. Then multiply it by Transocean employee numbers.Gives you a Transocean share price of $6.1Is this the start of a slow correction?Could climb quite a way.March '20 RIG$ 2.095 NBR $31.77NBR now $104 RIG ""should be"" $6.85But with the recent share issue there are 11%more shares.Therefore ( minus 11% share issue@$0.75per/share)RIG =$6.1That not quite a bagger in correction when it comes.But trading in and out might leave you with a swing the wrong way. Be warned"
"Earnings call, either way RIG will continue to climb…"
"I am expecting a good surprise , and I m convinced that Rig will star to move significantly up in 2022"
"From another boardChevron reports the highest profits in 8 years this morning due to high oil prices. I wish RIG would follow.I believe it inevitably will follow. But RIG takes longer because supply has to keep dwindling as demand grows, to drive up oil prices, to fund new exploration / drilling. It's just a painful wait.Good post.The truth is it will start to rise to levels ABOVE its prepandemic levels WHEN enough market sentiment is there to see value and they buy and hold and buy and hold. Not only does it have to be a good thing long term it has to have people believe it is and put there money where there mouth is and keep doing it.Tricky when the backlog has yet to rise significantly and drilling does not appear to be skyrocketing, however this is all played out within its yearly budgets and that will decide the drilling campains and they are not an overnight percentage otherwise the profits could increase inline with the same increase in drilling. The drlliling looks like a fixed sum. So I think the new year will bring a step change If the oil companies are serious about the working hand in glove with the offshore drillers next year will show you how much their making this year.Investors with this sort viewpoint has become mainstream, lets hope rig gets to dividens!!"
"Transocean management really is going ""all in"" on the offshore rig market bouncing back hard, and soon...20k ships on order, shifting debt obligations, no basement price dayrate contacting, share issuance, and now another (they bought Ocean Rig, and Songa in the last 5-10 years) bid on a competitor.

"Reactivation economicsBecause most drillers will not reactivate unless they can be sure to recuperate costs, it may be that reactivation economics could become an important factor in setting drillship dayrate benchmarks in the coming months, especially if more cold rigs are brought into circulation.Recent contracts fixed in the Golden Triangle have been as high as $300,000/day for active rigs, although the majority have been around the mid- $200,000/day mark. Ideally, a reactivation will be based on receiving a contract at a higher dayrate (somewhere around the $300,000 mark) and a duration of two years or more, but it is still possible to pay back the investment with one or the other assuming rig operating costs of around $120,000/day."
"source of info from another board. excellent reposted.15 hours ago via mobile mrtaxx and bjspokanimal like thisReplyQuotePost OptionsPost by pyromancer157 on 15 hours agoOffshore drilling rig reactivations have begunOct. 28, 2021www.offshore-mag.com/rigs-vessels/article/14213107/offshore-drilling-rig-reactivations-have-begunUtilization and dayrates continue their rapid recovery.Source: Esgian Rig ServiceChange in number of drilling, warm-stacked and cold-stacked drillships between Jan 2020 and October 2021.We expected it to happen just not necessarily this soon. But now it’s official: several cold-stacked rigs are about to be reactivated for new jobs in the Golden Triangle, and Valaris is taking the lead. Just last week, the driller confirmed that it will reactivate sixth-generation, ultra-deepwater drillship Valaris DS-4 for a minimum 580-day deal with Petrobras Brazil. The rig has been idle for over two years.This follows other recent announcements from the same rig owner for the seventh-generation drillship Valaris DS-11, which will also be revived for a long-term deal off Brazil with Petrobras; and Valaris DS-16, which will undertake a two-year deal with Oxy in the US Gulf of Mexico starting next year.Last year, the driller took a tough stance on its uncontracted fleet, preservation-stacking a hefty 19 rigs (nine floaters and 10 jackups) due to the lack of opportunities in the market. Now it appears to be front of the queue to bring those rigs back out and take advantage of the recovering market.Meanwhile, Seadrill will reactivate its seventh-generation drillship West Jupiter, also for a multi-year deal with Petrobras Brazil, starting in late 2022. Additionally, stacked drillships Auriga and West Carina (both of which haven’t worked in over a year) will also be ramped up and put out to work in 2022 for long-term deals in the USA and Brazil, respectively.Shrinking supply warrants resuscitationsSo far, most reactivations have been confirmed for modern, ultra-deepwater drillships due to a rapid increase in competitive utilization. This, combined with a strong demand outlook for 2022 and 2023, is expected to result in longer-term campaigns and higher dayrates for these types of rigs.Additionally, supply in this segment has also plummeted since the last upcycle. According to Esgian Rig Service, 44 drillships have been removed from the fleet since 2015. This is on top of the increased cold stacking that took place last year by the bigger rig players.The drillship market is currently comprised of 58 units currently working, and 11 of the 16 hot/warm stacked assets now have future work in place.With the pool of ready-to-go drillships shrinking, could this mean more of the remaining 18 cold-stacked units will return to operation? We expect to see reactivations initially for rigs that have been idle for the least amount of time, that have been well maintained, and that are still “top tier” younger assets.Semisubmersible and jackup utilization have not yet reached levels comparable to drillships. As a consequence, there has been a limited number of confirmed reactivations for rigs of these types. But that doesn’t mean it may not happen further down the line if the market continues its recovery.Youth versus experienceStranded newbuilds are being considered again too, though there is still a preference for reactivating rigs with proven track records, rather than bringing out a newbuild that has never worked before. Supporting this idea are all the additional costs and potential issues that often come along with a newbuild shakedown.Nevertheless, Saipem has confirmed a bareboat charter of the stranded seventh-generation drillship Samsung Santorini, which will be brought out of the yard in South Korea and put to work for Eni in the US Gulf of Mexico next year. Rumors suggest a few other newbuilds are currently under discussion too.And there are plenty to choose from, with 18 under construction or categorized as stranded assets still in yards, and just three confirmed for delivery so far.Reactivation economicsValaris says that it will cost in the range of $30 to $45 million to reactivate each of its preservation-stacked floaters, and that in most cases it expects the initial contract to pay for these costs. Transocean, meanwhile, estimates that the total cash cost of reactivating a cold-stacked asset in its fleet starts at $60 million and could go upwards of $100 million.Because most drillers will not reactivate unless they can be sure to recuperate costs, it may be that reactivation economics could become an important factor in setting drillship dayrate benchmarks in the coming months, especially if more cold rigs are brought into circulation.Recent contracts fixed in the Golden Triangle have been as high as $300,000/day for active rigs, although the majority have been around the mid- $200,000/day mark.

I believe today's drop may be related to Seadrill is coming out of BK. The assumption is that they will lower the day rate in offshore drill industry as they have much less debt. But this assumption will prove to wrong as Transocean is industry leader and have better control on contract pricing.
Good call on 3.50 today..... will shorts close their position today ahead of earnings? think they may....really earning is all about the future! so a bit of high risk to stay short at this level when everyone calling for $100 oil....
"The simple answer is the the pandemic created a dthery, dithery, delivery to the 8th gen and the contracts as oil producers hunkered in for a world stoppage.

"Rochester, a loser sits there an assails others for their predictions and trades when they don't offer any; and a TOTAL loser does that and then LIES about someone else's predictions and trades - and you, of course, are the latter. Let's go over a sampling of your lies about me, shall we? 1. Your contention that I delete posts because I want to hide a bad performance is a lie. There is not only no bad performance, but there has never been a loss on ANY trade I've publicly disclosed. You, on the other hand, delete EVERY prediction that you have made that has been wrong; for example, 2 earnings ago you promised a ""pump and dump"" and we would go from $3.3 to the $2s, and we sailed to over $5 - deleted posts. You just project what YOU do onto others. I delete all posts within 10 days, and I've already explained why - so traders can look at intraday data and see what I'm doing. Once you're past that, you only have the price and my documented realtime trade, and that's not maximizing their ability to see HOW I entered and when. And paradoxically, it allows clowns like you to lie about make up bad trades and losses for me. Let's go over some highlights of YOUR LIES. 1. I obtained my massive RIG position in the very first days of 2021, documenting every tranche in real time and an explanation why - lawsuits resolved, voluntary reorganization, debt-debt swap, so near term headwinds were addressed. And yet as you know exactly my position you say it doesn't exist and there is no proof. You are my proof. YOU know. But you lie. 2. I give my prediction for oil (wti) as I am an oil futures trader, first and foremost - it is my background. I said we would move from the $40s to the $60s and consolidate there, and then we would move to the $80s and consolidate there. And I offered my game plan trading oil futures - hold massively on the way to consolidation levels, sell, and trade intraday (primarily) the consolidations. And I gave the timing - $60s by summer, and $80s by EOY 2021. And we did that - and ahead of schedule. And I even offering to teach you how to do this and make more money than you ever thought possible. But YOU claim none of it exists and make up predictions I never gave - like $100 by April. Lie. 3. You not only lie about trades, claiming they are non-existent, but you actually make up trades for me - and always. If RIG has a significant retracement, I say it's a good time to buy - and that's with saying repeatedly the mantra that ANY buy in 2021 will be golden as a long term investment, and taking advantage of weakness is simply smart. But you will claim I bought shares when I didn't if RIG goes lower. Lie. 4. You will take stocks I offer - I mean, seriously, this is to HELP PEOPLE you sick clown - like SI and COIN, offer the rationale and why it's a good time to buy and you even LIE about my position and price when I give it in real time. SI @89 and COIN @$238? And those gains. The problem with you is that you are not only a loser clown but you actually contribute to others not benefitting from knowledge, expertise and success. You just bring people down with hate and vitriol and don't help them invest. And are you that short-sided and full of hate that you want to bury someone who wants to help others make money?I want to help people; and I have the tools and experience to do so. The question is why you are hell-bent on your crusade to attack others? If you had actually traded what I gave in REAL TIME positions, you would have already have more than you would know what to do with it. But that would require you actually learning, getting competent, taking risk. I've had said repeatedly predictions are meaningless insofar as they inform your trading activities and need to be reaccessed always. Take RIG. You had a sad, silly game of calling the open Nov 2. Anyone who actually does this and is successful laughs at that. And why? What is the trading activity going into the close prior to earnings? And calling an opening print isn't trading - it's gambling. And yet, I played your game and YOU deleted YOUR posts with your call. I mean it's YOUR challenge. And you say I didn't play when I did? And you say $3.47 wasn't my submission when it was? This is why LIARS lose - you say you don't delete posts but where is your number? Deleted. Lie. You say there is no record of my submission, yet you cite my number - $3.47. Lies are easy to exploit by their own stupidity. So I'll offer it YET AGAIN, Rochester. You can come meet me and see our operation at our family office. We'll play for a week of your time, providing all accommodations in the lap of luxury - world-class entertainment to boot - and then you can report back here that it is true, everything I've ever said, my history, including professionally, and what trades I've done. And THAT is a CHALLENGE I keep offering and you dob't take it, as you finish your life mad, angry, unfulfilled and tKing it out on others. But you could be wise."

"As Oil Races Toward $100, Consumers Tell OPEC+ Enough Is EnoughFri, October 29, 2021, 12:50 PM(Bloomberg) For the past year, oil consuming countries have become increasingly anxious at crude’s resurgence: first to $50 a barrel, then $75 and now to more than $85. And when Vladimir Putin, one of the leaders of the OPEC+ cartel, warned that $100 a barrel was a distinct possibility, the alarm bells really started ringing.Many consuming countries were reluctant to call more openly for extra oil production just before a major UN climate change summit in Glasgow, Scotland, known as COP26. But even that perception problem is starting to fade.

"Comment from another board and makes the most logical sense with undercutting dayrates for the competition to get their top tier vessels unstacked and working as they desperately need it to form leverage to borrow. As well as Transoceans reluctance to bargain basement and tie up its equipment when the supply could dry up very quickly. Especially GoM. Transocean has issued it's fleet update... as usual, a week or so ahead oftheir quarterly earnings report.Including the widely anticipated maiden contract for the newbuild Atlas, RIG'sbacklog declined from $7.3 billion in July to $7.1 billion in this 10/25 report.Generally, the dayrates achieved were attractive relative to many of the signingswe've seen since July by RIG's competitors, but RIG's competitors have beenmore aggressive toward getting ships un-stacked at lower dayrates.As I've mentioned before, Transocean is clearly following through on it'scomments that it is hesitant to un-stack rigs without attractive contractterms. It appears to me that they're most focused on keeping their hot rigsworking at above average dayrates and getting the contracts for their newbuildsall lined up while keeping their powder dry for ananticipated future shortage of rigs with their stacked units.The only 2 contracts at lower dayrates appear to be quick, single-well jobs that willbe completed next month and in December, respectively.Here is the report:www.offshore-mag.com/rigs-vessels/article/14212826/transocean-secures-multiple-drilling-contracts-in-the-gulf-of-mexicoTransocean secures multiple contracts in the Gulf of MexicoTransocean Ltd. has provided an update on its offshore drilling rig fleet.Oct. 25, 2021STEINHAUSEN, Switzerland – Transocean Ltd. has provided an update on its offshore drilling rig fleet.As of Oct. 25, the company’s total backlog is about $7.1 billion.Beacon Offshore Energy has awarded the Deepwater Atlas a two-phase, four-well contract in the US Gulf of Mexico.

"Please, where would an earnings surprise come from during the quarter? Is anyone aware of any undisclosed event that would positively impact earnings? The FSR was flat.Guidance from the Q2 conference call:“For the third quarter of 2021, we expect adjusted contract revenue of approximately $670 million. Based upon an average fleet-wise revenue efficiency of 96%, the quarter-over-quarter decrease is mostly attributable to the early conclusion of operations on the Transocean Barents, the Transocean enablers special periodic survey, the Transocean Norge rolling off contract and the Deepwater Mykonos Shipyard which was deferred from the second quarter. These negative impacts were partially offset by a full quarter of activity on the Asgard and Inspiration. We expect third quarter O&M expense to be approximately $427 million.The quarter-over-quarter decrease is explained by the factors previously mentioned. We expect G&A expense for the third quarter to be approximately $40 million, in line with the second quarter. Net interest expense for the third quarter is forecasted to be approximately $113 million. This includes capitalized interest of approximately $13 million.”Add depreciation and some taxes and its another ~$100M loss.The hope, a new contract(s) post FSR (unlikely). Will Thiggy’s positive outlook/spin without some hard proof be able to carry us?Other than this, oil, short term may continue to pull us north."
Roberto you nailed the problem. Day rates are under water compared to 2008 timeframe. add in inflation and every single ship is losing cash with every hour they operate. they need 400+ on average. the two new ships need over 500. People are excited about new build but the first is going into action as a cash negative asset not good imo.That's why this is just a pure commodity play not a business model play its a very bad business model. so throw out the asset value and all the normal metrics its just a commodity bet.
