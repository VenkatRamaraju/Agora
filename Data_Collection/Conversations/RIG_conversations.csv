"This (below), was an amazing read. It was written by a guy who goes by bjspokanimal. I swear he knows more about this company and industry than anybody i've seen!Re: ""demand destruction"", a key element in economics, is ""elasticity"", which usuallyapplies to ""demand"" but also applies to ""supply"".Basically, elasticity is a measure of how MUCH the demand, or supply, of a productchanges over time as a result of a change in price.Eg: If exxon and chevron share a street corner and offer gasoline for $3.19 per gallonand exxon were to increase it's price by a dime while chevron does not, then the elasticityof demand would likely shift significantly toward the chevron station.Historically, however, the elasticity of demand for ""oil"" is low, on a global ornational scale. When oil prices rise significantly, demand drops, but not that much.Over the past decade or 2, that in-elasticity has diminished, due to the development ofhydrocarbon usages that can switch between alternative fuels... especially in electricpower generation. In ""trendular"" terms, consistently high gas and diesel fuels wouldalso hasten alternative fuels as EVs become increasingly popular.But in terms of the market for offshore drilling rigs, here is what matters to me.Recent global oil demand in the mid-90 million barrels per day (BPD) range is now on a trajectorytoward 100 to maybe 105 million BPD by late next year and most ""peak demand"" estimates arearound the year 2030. So, if we reach peak demand by 2030 and, by 2040, we're back near95 million BPD, then maybe 91 or 92 million BPD by 2050, how does such demand glide pathcompare to drilling rigs?Right now, the newest, 7th generation drillships were launched in 2015. Aside from Titan,Atlas, and some new land and jackup rigs in the mid-east, nothing else has been built since2015 and nothing is planned to be built. The only exceptions, are a half dozen, partiallyor fully constructed rigs whose construction contracts were cancelled as the client drillerstruggled with bankruptcy and those rigs have been rusting away in shipyards since theirconstruction began, 6 to as many as 13 years ago.Looking ahead, few rigs will get built over the next 10 years unless the number of currentlystacked units declines Significantly, and once started, it takes 2.5 to 3 years toactually build, equip, and launch a 7th or 8th generation drillship. They're also very expensiveto build such big ships nowadays too... running between $1.3 and $1.6 Billion to build anythingthat can compete with Atlas or Titan.That means that a rig launched in 2010 will be 20 years old when we get to peak oil in 2030,and 30 years old (and likely scrapped) by 2040. What this MEANS, is that aggregate, deep-waterrigs (and deep water is where the big, quality, oilfields are) in the world will age FAR fasterthan we'll reach peak oil and begin to decline much from peak oil. The only thing thatwill CURB such an imbalance between the demand for oil and the aging of the fleet, will beenough of an oil boom to warrant significant rig new-builds, and I would maintain that sucha boom, which ""may"" be getting started currently, would have us ringing the register on asignificantly appreciated Transocean stock long before anybody's looking at very much""long-term"" demand destruction for oil.Finally, I think all the above supports the notion that it's healthy for deepwater and harsh environment drilling for oil prices to be profitable, but not excessive. $90 to $100 oil wouldshorten a cycle whereas $70 to $80 oil would elongate a cycle and #$%$ demand destruction or alternative substitution. Every deep water development on earth is currently quite profitablenorth of $60 oil and $75 oil would speed up some of this development, but $90+ would not be healthy, IMO, and is above what is optimal as we look at an environment that would fosterdayrates on 7th gen drillships in the $400k to $500k day rate range for contracts consummated late next year or into 2023."
There's a real appeal to the way Mr. Clifford Wells goes about his trades and explanations. And I really like his promptness to reply
"Patrick is not playing fair. It was a honest vote, he lost fair and square yet he keeps posting. We went up 14% today with him not posting. He needs to do the honorable thing and stop posting for the next two weeks. One week for the vote and one week for posting while prohibited. Play fair Patty!"

NBR now positive!! This could end up green today!
Been holding RIG for a while. Bought at around $3.80 and plan to keep holding. Oil's not going anywhere for a long time.
"One morning very soon you will see a move of $1.00 or more, up up & away !"
UK gas stations running out of gasoline and Natgas skyrocketing. RIG at $6 by end of year.
They had some interesting insights about RIG on (http://Pick-stocks.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"RIG going much higher, fair value based on book value is $19.20/share....cash value alone is worth $1.50/share. we are paying $2.50 for the company with higher book value. hold and be patient."
"The slow pace of resumption of drilling thisyear, despite surging oil and gas prices, reflects the devastation that occurred tomost E&P companies' (and sovereign oil producing countries') balance sheets duringthe heart of the covid pandemic last year.Just as E&P entities are slow to resume drilling, drillers are slow to unstackrigs, let alone planning on building any new ones. Like I said above, after 7 yearsof tepid exploration, capped by a disasterous 2020, EVERYBODY'S financial capacitiesare strained and everybody's reserves are significantly depleted. These are thecharacteristics that typically precede a sustained up-cycle.Re: the last couple of oil inventory reports; remember that this is the slackseason. Summer driving season is over and we are between air conditioning seasonand, most importantly, heating season. This is the time of year that refineriesusually reduce output for seasonal maintenance.This winter's heating season will require the usual consumption of heating oil inthe northeast. What will be different, is how much additional propane heating willoccur as a result of people still working from home... and how much the high costof natural gas will result in conversion of gas-powered power plants to fuel oil,which a healthy percentage of such plants are capable of doing.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-rule-out-an-energy-crisis-goldman-sachs-162317262.html"

"Valaris up 1.5%? Currently worth $0.2bn more than RIG?? How can this bee?? Just out of bankruptcy? Wiped out their sharehilders? Newly appointed C.E.O. from another comapny that also wiped out its shareholders? Would you put yuour money there? How can it be going up? Debt! it has to ""Bee"" debt! Clearing all that debt and letting Seadrill ex-C.E.O. should ""give you confidence"" the new C.E.O. wont let the company bankrupt twice! Don't be fooled by debt articles. Its scrapping out of date drill fleets that needed to happen, they are not cost effective. Not debt. Thats the way an industry that wants to spend its money offshore where energy is clean and cheap when done correctly will see value longterm. Thats the philosophy anyway. Next 5 years sees an increase demand for 25 deepwater floaters? Where will they come from?"
4% gain or 6%?
"RIG will forever be my best short play, even at $3 a share, I still have no confidence this company will ever improve under THUGpen. South only stock. Short NOW!"
"GoM look promising for RIG as Americas' Oil independence by Rochester said frackng will kill deepwater.From wikiMany proponents of energy independence look to the United States' untapped domestic oil reserves, either known or potential. Those who favor increasing domestic oil production often suggest removing many of the limitations on oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (see Arctic Refuge drilling controversy) and the outer continental shelf. Foreign dependence is not the only factor in North American energy politics, however; environmental concerns around land and water pollution and greenhouse gases are also matters of controversy.According to Rystads demand forcast by Noble in the next 5 years the global demand for deepwater floater will increase 25%, where will they come from?? Thats over 20!Deep water drilling where the pipline is encased in concrete and sealed! But not like fracking! fracture an area and before you know it gas comes pouring out all over the place! Sometimes really where you dont expect it! Ohh and thats the clean method of dry fracking!"
Thank you rei again.

Rig once again very bad price evolution. Probably getting red at an oil price of nearly 80 Dollars!! This shows clearly that the share belongs to the 3 and for the moment not to the 4... REI's price is getting higher than RIG... WOW!! Difficult to stay bullish!
If the general market doesn't roll over in the next 3 days look for massive short covering rally....
Wonder why most oil exploration and productions are up or even but oil services down today ?

"Here it goes again, oil up, rig up higher. Go green"
"From another board.Question :- I’m failing to understand how rig utilization has not gone up, nor have the day rates….(the day rates have been doing since the beginning of the year)Answer:- I'd put forth this thought about that thought...RIG is withholding their fleet waiting for day rates to go up to profitable levels while letting the companies emerging from bk fight for over low margin breakeven deals. (As RIG has more stacked drillships than the competitors have in thier fleet.)"
What time does the Fleet report approximately come out in any given day of the week? Thanks.
"Well, well, well, looked what happened when Patrick was banned from posting. RIG went up close to 14%. Ok Patrick you are banned for two weeks. I know it will be hard for you but just keep saying to yourself no, no, no, I will not ruin it for everyone. Self control son."
"From another board, good point.Oil to $100 maybe around the corner!!!“The big news last week and the story that could eventually send prices for WTI and Brent crude oil to $100 per barrel is that some industries have begun switching fuel from high priced gas to oil. This is the kind of demand that the experts did not factor into their pricing models.”"

"Well, will oil continue north? Just about any major oil svc company chart for today is a mirror image. Roberto, any thought to utilizing some trading shares? Days like today it helps to ease the euphoria and disappointment of the give and take, or maybe just a good whiskey."
"If $RIG is red, buy. If $RIG is green, hold. We’re in the first inning of a global energy crisis. ALL oil service companies are about to explode higher. Throw your charts out, it’s all about lack of supply now."
Not sure why RIG isn't up a whole lot more. Oil demand should skyrocket and supply cannot respond.
RIG still trading at the high for the day after hours. Fantastic! Broke back to break even again. Looking for some follow through now.
If you can make sense of this!!! Seadrill up 4%! that makes sense.
All oil service companies will break out in the coming months. Every holding in the $OIH oil service etf will be multiples higher. DUC inventory from 2019 is finally drying up. $RIG upside is higher IMO due to short interest and out-of-whack valuation. We’re going to $1-2 moves DAILY in the coming months. All OECD inventories are dangerously low and it’s only getting worse.

Is happy if people are invested and the price goes down.

"Ok people I give up. Patrick was supposed to be banned from posting for two weeks. He has completely ignored the ban with the exception of the day we went up 14%. Patty is a rule breaker and near impossible to control. He’s a spoiled little child that doesn’t play well with others. I give up, if I can’t get some other people to help me quell his obsession with posting, I’m going to just let him run wild."
RIG not returning to profit even when oil climbs. Why are they screwing us shareholders?
Thigpen is the man to have made it this long as ceo. Has done nothing but cash his checks. Great work.
Throw a dart at any company in the $OIH and it will be up 200-800% in the next 12-18 months. $RIG is closer to the 800% side. It’s basic drilling math. Today’s share price is a gift.
"I took a look at the price of crude and RIG for the last 20 years. RIG tracked crude until 2009. And since then RIG just headed down to a $1 even in times when crude went up. I plugged in CLR and it follows it much better. I know these are different companies, but can someone summarize why RIG has been so low and has not bounced back as much. Even before the pandemic. I am hoping with all the pent up demand that RIG will be much more relevant going forward. Was just wondering if there are other managerial issues or it just simply we need to continue with oil over $70/bbl and this will be back in the teens?"
I’ll say it againWe’re calling for RIG to hit 4.30 to 4.50 by the need of the month.

"Fortune: Gas prices have more than tripled in the last 18 months—and are likely to go higherChris Morris: Mon, October 11, 2021The price of gas is getting absurd and it’s going to go even higher before things get better—and there’s no telling where the ceiling might be.The national average for a gallon of regular unleaded stands at $3.27, according to AAA. That’s $1.09 more than a year ago, when most people were long past the stay-at-home orders of the pandemic. And it’s a 10-cent increase over a month ago.To put things in perspective, last March, the price of gas fell below $1 per gallon.It’s even higher in some states. California, for example, is currently averaging $4.44 per gallon, with some counties hitting as high as $4.65.Meanwhile, crude oil prices continue to balloon, recently topping $80 for the first time in eight years. As of 10:14 a.m. ET, the price of crude stood at $81.27. Since last November, crude oil has seen the biggest price increases of any commodity, by a long shot.An energy crisis in Europe and Asia is driving those increases, but riding demand for gas in the U.S. is playing a role as well. Crude oil supplies are also constricted, which is affecting prices as well.It’s a big bounce back for crude, which fell as low as $16.94 last April. And a little under two months ago, prices were just over $62.How do commodity prices impact your wallet? The price of crude oil accounts for about 67% of the per-gallon gas price, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Other factors, such as taxes, vary by state, of course, which can result in large variations in prices from state to state.Look no further than the states that saw the largest increases last week. Gas prices in Kentucky and Indiana shot up 15 cents, while North Carolina and Virginia only saw 7 cent increases.$CDEV $RIG $LPI"

"Democratic members of Congress from California seized on the oil spill off the state's coast to promote federal legislation to ban all offshore oil drilling, as investigators searched for what caused the pipeline to burst.About 3,000 barrels (126,000 gallons) of crude oil spilled into the Pacific Ocean, killing wildlife, soiling the coastline, and forcing officials to close beaches in several cities in Orange County, just south of Los Angeles. The spill follows dozens of incidents in the Gulf of Mexico following Hurricane Ida, which slammed into the U.S. Gulf in late August and damaged rigs and pipelines.There are just 23 rigs operating off California's coast, producing just 12,000 barrels of oil a day - a far cry from the 1 million-plus barrels in daily crude output from the U.S. Gulf. California once produced more than 200,000 barrels of crude everyday offshore. But activity has dwindled, and some lawmakers want to see it shut outright.""We have to do all we can to ensure that we phase out the 23 rigs that are out there now, and that we ban all new offshore rigs,"" said U.S. Representative Mike Levin, a Democrat who represents a district that lies just south of the spill."

With this in mind, the competition to hire offshore rigs has heated up drastically and is going to get much hotter, because no one is going to have the ability to start and complete a new build over the next decade.

Seadrill and transocean put me out of buisiness. In early 2015 I was working for ameriprise been in buisiness 22 years at the time i decided to put my clients and myself into both of these stocks. Had made money on rig in the past. Prices had come way down and they both paid great dividends.started buying transocean in high 40s at time paid a 3 dollar a year dividend stock had been up over 100 dollars a share seadrill was 11 dollars paid 1 dollar a year dividend. Oil had come down from 140 dollars a barrel at the time 100 dollars a barrel. Were always going to need more and more oil each year what can go wrong?

"Offshore driller Seadrill Ltd has requested an additional four months to retain control of its bankruptcy proceeding, saying it is still working to drum up as much support as possible for its proposed reorganization plan.The company, represented by Kirkland & Ellis, made its request in a motion filed on Tuesday, a few weeks before Seadrill is scheduled to present its proposed plan for approval to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David Jones in Houston. The plan aims to reduce the company’s $5.6 billion debt stack by $4.9 billion and raise $350 million in new financing. Senior lenders will take over most of Seadrill’s equity.The company has holders of 58% of its senior loans on board with its proposal. The company said in Tuesday’s filing that it is still “working to obtain the acceptance of all voting classes” for its plan and that an extension of its exclusive period to file a plan is critical to ensuring its plan confirmation and emergence from bankruptcy move ahead smoothly.Seadrill has faced opposition to its reorganization efforts since the outset of the Chapter 11 case, which began in February, from a group of lenders that argue a sale is a better option for maximizing the company’s value. Seadrill said in Tuesday’s filing that it is will “work constructively with opponents to the plan to resolve any remaining open issues.”The case is In re Seadrill Ltd, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of Texas, No. 21-30427."

"Major breakout to 6 or 7 is in the making, oil should push over 90 in the coming 6 to 8 weeks, as the push to green will force energy companies to go bankrupt, produce less, or wait for higher oil prices, as less companies produce oil, and the population continues to grow oil will go higher. With everyone wanting electric in stead of gas, mining companies will be the big winners, lithium, cobalt,nickel, copper, magnesium, and other metals will be needed. Also keep in mind not everyone wants electric cars, Last year 20 % of electric car owners traded in their cars for ICE or internal combustion engines, people dont like to wait for the charge, it takes too long, especially on 110 volt from the house. Oil will always be around, remember we need to heat our homes, only rich people can afford geothermal systems. Good luck."

The overall offshore utilisation rate in the market is near 82%. With Brent ftr prices nearing 80/bbl ++ … and with the amount of rigs scraped over these last couple of years … rig rates are going to sky rocket. Supply vs Demand.
Remember when crude was $30 a barrel and RIG was $9 a share? Those where the days..
There is no positive news oil might be 80 but day rates are still languishing under 300 K per day remember at 400 K per day they still lost money for years on end ￼
So many people are hot on rig. I am a long suffering long and pets face it this company and industry is irreparably damaged. The glory days are long gone.

"LOAD UP ON CPE, $CDEV, $RIG AND $LPI BOYS. LOOKS LIKE A PERFECT STORM FOR OIL INVESTORS! OPEC+ Will Be Unwilling And Unable To Stop The Oil Price Rally By Irina Slav - Sep 28, 2021, 7:00 PM CDT Goldman Sachs claims that oil has entered a structural bull market, reaffirming their $90 oil prediction Oil inventories are seeing their largest daily drawdowns ever, and the growing global natural gas shortage will only increase demand for oilOPEC+ will ultimately be unwilling and unable to counter soaring oil prices Few could have predicted that after an already extensive bull run this year amid recovering demand, oil prices had much further to go. And yet, the world’s most traded commodity just got a major boost from the gas crunch in Europe and Asia, prompting forecasters to update their forecasts. One of the most bullish of all observers has been Goldman Sachs, whose commodity analysts have stuck to their price target of $80 for Brent crude. Now, these analysts have raised their target to $90, arguing that oil has entered a structural bull market.In a note from earlier this week, the Goldman commodities team noted the sizeable drawdowns in oil stocks, which currently stand at around 4.5 million bpd and which are the biggest daily drawdowns ever recorded, are one of the factors driving the shift from a cyclical to a structural market.The International Energy Agency reported earlier that because of Hurricane Ida, global oil supply actually fell in August, despite OPEC+ ramp-ups, by 540,000 bpd. The IEA added it expected production growth to resume next month, but according to Goldman Sachs, this will be nowhere near enough to restore the balance between supply and demand.Finally, there is the bonus bullish factor for oil: the gas crunch that has crippled Europe and is beginning to cripple China as well. A combination of underinvestment in local production, a jump in demand as economic activity rebounded, and a harsh winter last year that left storage caverns half-empty turned into a perfect storm for Europe earlier this year and pushed gas prices sky-high, prompting utilities to restart coal and oil power plants. China, on the other hand, is suffering the effects of tight coal supply and self-imposed stricter emission regulations that have added to energy costs.All this will drive a persistent deficit for oil markets, the Goldman analysts noted. Further, “its scale will overwhelm both the willingness and ability for OPEC+ to ramp up.” A recovery in U.S. shale will also be insufficient to erase the deficit, the analysts noted."
