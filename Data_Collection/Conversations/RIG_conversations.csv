Sigh. I bought 1 share to watch for awhile and research. That 1 share has done simply phenomenal!
"First, 255 days and result in approximately $80 million of contract drilling revenue at 15,000 psi. 314 day rate. Second, 275 days and contribute approximately $125 million of contract drilling revenue, at 20,000 psi. rate 454 day rate, same as Chevron's.Average 387K dayrate, plus additional 30mil mobilization and 17 mil installation. I would say the deal is fair, good news."
"Rig a great company. Lots of new contracts planned. Plus they are developing their company, investing in company. This will go to 10$ soon"
"The pullback in oil stock valuations was far more drastic than the drop in the price of WTI. I think that earnings are about to start mattering. IMHO even if crude prices stayed the same, CPE, $CDEV, $LPI, $MRO, $MTDR $REI and drillers like $RIG and $KLXE would have risen unless Delta got really bad. That was a blow off bottom, so to speak."
glad I picked up another 20000 shares at 2.88 last week. Fingers crossed it holds...
"Who thinks that Transocean will win?""(Adds Seadrill comment, details) OSLO, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Offshore drilling rig contractors Transocean Ltd and Dolphin Drilling have made a new offer to buy the assets of stricken rival Seadrill Ltd , Dolphin's chief executive said on Friday. Oslo-listed Seadrill, founded by Norwegian-born tycoon John Fredriksen, is currently seeking to emerge from U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings under an alternative financial plan filed in court last month. ""I can confirm that Dolphin and Transocean submitted an updated bid yesterday,"" Dolphin Chief Executive Bjoernar Iversen told Reuters."""

"The timing of the PR wasn't optimal but we now have data points and a commitment. The rates aren't exceptional but may be a bird-in-hand decision. Keep in mind this is a billion dollar asset and using simple math, OE&M may run around 50 pct (RIG on average is in the low 60s), the initial contribution will be in the 150s per day. Assuming a 30 yr life, payback is around 95k per day, WACC according to 3rd party sources is 10-15 pct. The investment needs the $450 day rate to even get close. Committed til Q1 2024, appears it will take about two months to upgrade the equipment mid contract. By 2024, how many competitors could have 20k psi ability? The upside, cash flow."
Will we see an abundance of offshore drilling over the next 2-5 years?
"This could be why oil companies have crashed so badly over the past month:Today or yesterday Harry mentioned that the price of oil may only be falling relative to the dollar, maybe it's doing well against the Euro etc. Maybe the dollar is rising, or maybe there's just a fear that the dollar is going to rise. Here's why: A coming deflationary period is possible for the dollar. One indication is the FED Tapering. They're talking about starting it in September.""Tapering is the reduction of the rate at which a central bank accumulates new assets on its balance sheet under a policy of QE."" In other words they reduce the rate at which they are pumping cash into the market buy purchasing treasury bills, notes and bonds, quantitative easing.""Tapering is the first step in the process of either winding down—or completely withdrawing from—a monetary stimulus program that has already been executed.""They have been saying that they're not going to raise interest rates but that doesn't matter because there will be less cash going into the system and that means less money for banks to loan out...higher interest rates to you and me.Dollars will be harder to get.One thing, tapering has been attempted in the past, but every major economy that has tried it has ended up backing down and returned to easy money in a hurry. But the fear of tapering, and the fear of the rising dollar that it will bring may be what has caused the mess that we've seen over the past month. #LPI #RIG #MRO #MTDR"
"WTI's weekly chart shows a ""Golden Cross"" - Only done that TWICE in 20 years!It is indicative of 20% to 50% oil price rally in the horizon.""A golden cross occurs when an asset’s shorter-term moving average crosses above its longer-term moving average and is broadly seen as a signal of further upside.""$OXY $CPE $RIG $OIH $SU $XOM $CVX $VET $EOG $CNQ $LPI $CLR $CDEV $CPGSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/26/oil-has-only-done-this-twice-in-20-years-it-could-mean-a-50-percent-rally.html"

"NEW YORK CITY – Offshore rig contracting activity has cleared “easy” year-over-year comps for five straight months from March through July, according to Evercore’s August 2021 Offshore Rig Market Snapshot.The report notes, however, that “the streak could be at risk with 18 contracts announced for August thus far [as of August 16] tracking below the year ago total of 35.” A total of 10 jackup and eight floater contracts have been confirmed this month, as of August 16, versus a total of 19 and 16 respectively a year ago.Jackups continue to slightly outpace floaters on a contract count basis, but floaters currently make up 44% of all contracts announced year-to-date (YTD) vs. the recent peak of 39% in 2018. “More importantly on a rig-year basis,” the report notes, “floaters are on track to beat the recent 2019 peak by 13% for the best year since 2014.”With three term contracts announced for Valaris including a 3.5-year contract from TotalEnergies for the DS-11, floaters account for 68% or 8 of the 12 rig years announced this month, which is only slightly below the 17 total rig years booked a year ago, according to the report. Overall, floaters have led on a rig-year basis for three of seven months this year and account for 30% of the YTD total.“With contractors retiring another semisub and three jackups over the past month, bringing the YTD total to 16 floaters and 24 jackups, the offshore rig market recovery appears to be finally underway,” the report concludes.08/22/2021"
Transocean is a winner! They are winning all the best contracts now- many contracts. Their income is going up. Their stock price is very low now. We run to 6$ very soon. And then higher.
