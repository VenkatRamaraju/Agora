"UNFI is excited to be the first wholesaler to partner with DoorDash to bring more online grocery shopping and delivery options to our independent retailers! DoorDash, the leading restaurant ordering and delivery services, has just added grocery stores to their online marketplace for a convenient, hassle-free solution to eCommerce."
"It is clearly there are sector rotation today as the whole financial markets sell-off. There are monies have beenmoving in the consumer staples, i.e. food stock, supermarkets stocks.... Should see some interests into UNFIstock soon as this stock has been sitting in the oversold condition right now."
"After a nice move higher, it's normal to expect volatility as a new base is being established. But stay patient; this still undervalued, defensive stock is very much a solid position to own in an inflationary environment. Stay long..."
"Looks smashing! With the current market cap of just 2.8B, it seems to have room to go higher"
"FWIW, today William Kirk reiterated his buy on UNFI. He increased his PT to 59.00 from 46.00.Four other analysts have chimed in with all keeping their ratings and targets the same."
At this price there is a huge gap down to $39.23.It has been my experience in the market that generally speaking gaps do get filled.I am ready.
"I love all this short, short, short talk. You shorts do realize that $450 million had been lost by shorts on this stock so far. Good luck, I guess your hoping this time is different."
"The great rotation has begun, assets, valuation and earnings do matter!"
"Just noticed UNFI is hoisting a Job Fair up in Green Bay Wi, and the post says STARTING salaries are $30/Hr. Up there, you can live like a king on that even b4 overtime."
"back to where it was after the earnings prior to last earnings, insiders/WS know a lot that retail doesn't."
"I dare you not to laugh:Sysco market cap 40B, revenue 51B and book value $3.UNFI market cap 2B revenue 27B and book value $23Sysco stock price $79.75UNFI stock price 37.29Therefore Sysco is at least 8 times more expensive than UNFI."

"I bought UNFI in May of 2019 for around $10. This was the year after the SuperValu acquisition. UNFI had been on a buying spree with (Tony's Fine Foods and others). The reason I purchased is I had held Whole Foods and the stock was behaving in a similar manner (crazy downgrades from the usual analysts, overplayed pr that suggested the sky was falling, wild fluctuations). Whole Foods continued until the day Amazon purchased.I don't know if others remember with UNFI, but the Yahoo stock price was always wrong and showed massive negative numbers, Fridays almost always tanked, there were PR reports saying UNFI's business with Whole Foods came up for renewal YEARS out, as if it was a negative. The stock was definitely being played, it felt for a while like someone was trying to push into bankruptcy. Man- I wish I had bought more at $5 when it dipped down but those were dark days.Covid probably saved the company and I think it gave it the opportunity to redirect, clean house and get aligned. I'm excited as a shareholder, I think this stock is still undervalued and there is a lot of opportunity. Unlike retailers, inflation is a good thing for UNFI.I know there are some UNFI team members on this board and I just wanted to say thank you!Good luck to all longs."
"Albertson came out with positive things today about there earnings,.....saying eating at home continues and seems to be sticking!!!....."
"Usually I'm happy when I sell my position right before an EARNINGS release...other times, not so much."
UNFI can't find drivers. our order yesterday was 9 hours late because they couldn't find anyone to haul the load! Can't sandy drive a truck??
"All other food stocks i.e. USFD, SYY, SPTN, PFGC etc.... were earlier sold off nearly $2, since then have comeback and only lost 1/3 or .50 cents.....Expect UNFI to do the same may be at the close today."
"When the stock price goes to $53. Their market cap will be 3 billion, the price they paid for Supervalu.This would imply a $106 stock price to get to their 2019 true value. What have they done since 2019.A hell of a lot. Steady revenue growth.Consolidated DCs...etc."
"Well, where are you longs? Buy, buy buy!!"
"Earnings are coming up and we longs need to prepare for the volatility that comes each quarter as many ""occasional shorts"" like to play this name, and they've been rewarded in recent years. But this is a different company now, with new leadership and new focus on profitability. The mid 40s should be on the near horizon; stay long..."
If you invested 3 years ago you're at break even today . Congratulations. Company doesn't fit for investing.
When the stock price hits $63.We will have a PE of 15 and a3 1/2 billion market cap. Seems easily doable…Holding on tight

"earnings tomorrow morning, earnings releases have been dangerous for unfi share price. I hope this time is different."
"There are food stocks i.e. BJ, ACI KHC are UP while UNFI has been down and way oversold in the last severaldays.... It was down today again in sympathy with the whole financial markets.... Should be rebound soon asand should heading back to $47 near term..... I am starting to accumulate UNFI. What a great bargain pricingright now."
"Crypto Currency trading and investments have really helped a lot of people achieve their main aim and quest for FINANCIAL FREEDOM, but many have also lost due to SELF TRADING and also due to investing with the wrong people. I recommend George E Wright to those wishes to invest and make huge profit returns. He's is real and reliable."
"Congrats to all the longs on this board that have stayed patient over the past 18 months, enjoyingthe ride from single digits to $50. It's not easy to find stocks undervalued by most of Wall Street, and to shrug off commentary from all the shorts on this board. Well played! Now we have a market friendly new CEO and more attention from the Street. Let's grind higher as Now $80 (once upon a time UNFI visited this level) is in our sights. Stay long..."
"In just 2 weeks my area Save-A-Lot has been decimated! It was one of their very best stores, a flagship. Very busy, and a pleasure to shop at. Apparently some pinhead yuppy trash in 'corporate' has started tinkering with things. The excellent store manager and employees are appalled at what is happening. Some of the best suppliers have been stiffed. The store is running out of everything and there is nothing coming to replace it. A feeble shipment of inferior, unwanted junk food product at crazy inflato prices did appear and is absolutely shunned by all shoppers. They had the shelves lowered to 'make it seem like more is there'. Meanwhile the store has NO crackers, NO chips or coffee, frozen staples, deli meat, not even bread! and is running out of dairy, meat, canned goods, pasta, just about everything. Weekly sales have plunged by 75%!!! I kid you not!This is corporate folly at it's absolute worst! A beloved store, I watch the many befuddled shoppers straggle to the checkout with hardly anything in their carts now, shaking their heads. They are already plotting their next shopping trips out of town. Sad to see. How long until this new reality reflects in the UNFI stock prices?"
"Hey Kurt, what do you think about OGN Organon. They have a 3% divided, 9B debt and have earned 1.58 followed by 1.72 earnings the past two quarters. SP is currently at 33."
"Funny how all the shorts come out of the wood work,....when a stock goes up!!!!!!....."
$50 stock price…That was easy.
"For those who saw the following announcement: “UNFI today announced it has entered into a reseller agreement with DASH to bring on-demand grocery delivery solutions to independent retailers nationwide through the DoorDash marketplace”. Here’s a quick comparison between UNFI and DASH:UNFI has 6.4X more revenue than DASH, but DASH’s market cap is about 27X greater than UNFI’s. In other words, DASH has a PSR that is about 180X greater than UNFI’s. Also, UNFI’s P/E (next yr’s estimate) is 10.1, while DASH’s is expected to be negative. While DASH very well be a good investment over the long term, I think that much of its upside is already baked into its stock price. On the other hand, the market seems to be discounting UNFI. There’s an old maxim that says, “during a gold rush, sell shovels”."
"The low margin, but high (sales) volume biz model works for me as long as UNFI continues to cut expenses and maintains profitability. Debt is being reduced. Stock buy backs might occur. Dividends are doubtful and not expected. If stock volume increases, maybe the valuations will increase. All good for longs. I will continue to drink the kool-aide for another quarter and see what the new guy can do... Now if IR can just put out a few PR pieces other than stuff on canibis distribution that is meaningless."
"Not bad for the week,..up $12.05!!??.."
