"my friend who is in supermarket business says sales are still up 35 percent from last year. earnings and outlook are going to be awesome. trading at book value, sysco is trading at 14 x book value. 8.6 million shares short, cover now or lose a fortune."
"Usually I'm happy when I sell my position right before an EARNINGS release...other times, not so much."
You've got to know when to fold. Rally is way over extended. Do not over stay the welcome. Uncool.
"The entire short thesis (UNFI is too debt-laden) is gradually eroding. It may take a couple more quarters of watching the company pay down larger swaths of this balance before the shorts realize that the eventual sale of retail (Cub's and Shoppers) along with UNFI's growing free cash flow is taking them into a classic ""squeeze"" (more like a vise). Patience of longs will be necessary, however as these moves take time..."
"I'd be very careful selling prior to earnings. The FOMO will be strong if UNFI rallies and then you have to buy back in at higher than you sold. The last 2 years of Quarter earnings have been fundamentally different as UNFI was transforming given its integration SVU. This new UNFI is a giant and we know if pre-merger UNFI was $40 in 2018, then this new and improved UNFI is not going to be sub-40 for long especially give all the new attention recently. I don't want any rockets taking off without me. I'd rather sit there holding shares with a -20% short term dip, than be holding cash having sold at $32 and seeing it $40+. Because let's be honest, if it goes to $40+ because of a kick#$%$ report, we're never seeing the 30s ever again. Just look at 2018 and why UNFI lost the $40 support. Those concerns have now been quelled. Of course if you are heavy on calls right now, I totally understand why you need to exit prior to earnings. A 20% decline will kill the position. Here's an idea to make you feel better. Sell your profitable calls prior to earnings and lock in those gains. Then buy the shares. If it rallies after earnings, you won't have FOMO because your shares are going to moon. If it dips, well then shares can?t expire and you can feel comfortable holding as it recovers in the medium/long term. This is not advice and meant solely for discussion purposes."
UPGRADE to 36 Price Target by MKM Partners: Just now--Jan 28 2021. Lets GO! -FCF Generation Solves Balance Sheet Worry-Catalyst Calendar LoomingInvestment Thesis-----Growth does not require Inflation nor CV-19 due to cross-selling & new customer wins like Key-Promotional Activity Should Improve-Holidays should be Strong-Key Foods opens up the huge NY market-Whole Foods relationship unreplicable-Retail Asset Deleveraging Force-Distribution Realignment Efficiency Upside-Independent Grocers increasingly important to the local commmunity
"History lesson: Every time UNFI pops after earnings it goes back to where it started. Pray, screaming won't help. See you below $48 tomorrow."
Sellers and shorts are not easily being let in and if this keeps up tomorrow it looks like we may finally have broken through. Shorts may become afraid to sell short and sellers may face regret.
"I gotta find my Staples ""EASY BUTTON"" and set it next to my computer. I'm going to start pounding on it at the opening bell tomorrow..."
Time to take profits!
$50 stock price…That was easy.
"Reading a retail blog today I noted a UNFI facility in Centralia Wa has been shut down due to a COVID outbreak. This prompted the following response from the authorKC's View:This probably is a hard thing for the folks at UNFI to deal with, and not just because the coronavirus is complicating many people's lives and businesses at the moment. The thing is, conversations I've had with a number of retailers have reflected a certain dissatisfaction with the level of service they've been getting from UNFI and Supervalu.In fact, I cannot remember a conversation that I've had lately in which the company's efforts have been described in a positive light. Lots of grumbling out there, and this isn't going to help.I consider the writer to be someone who is very informed. Is this why UNFI has seen a defection of major customers latley?"
Sectors rotation into consumer staples especially food stocks right now.there are many food stocks are hitting new high or just less than $1 to new high.UNFI could hit $34 today....
"P&G expects pandemic shopping trends to continue into the near term future. Just one more example of why UNFI will continue to grow revenues. Ride this revenue train. The consumer is flush with cash, revenge travel and spending is just around the corner and UNFI is selling the picks and shovels for all those activities. There's gold in them there isles!"
It’s interesting that we are one week removed from new CEO being named and SP is down not up. This move was positioned on this board as a catalyst but in the real world it looks like meh.
I just listened to the ICR conference webcast. It’s posted on the UNFI web site. Management seems to be doing good things. I liked the part that Chubs will be sold this year all in one shot with a supply agreement and that all Amazon Fresh and other Amazon properties requiring food that UNFI sells to this should be a real positive with Amazon planning to open more supermarkets independent to Whole Foods and UNFI will likely be the wholesaler. The stock should appreciate tremendously as some of these events become reality.
At this price there is a huge gap down to $39.23.It has been my experience in the market that generally speaking gaps do get filled.I am ready.
"Let’s do some math. UNFI’s quarterly sales are about $6-6.5 Billion. Let’s assume that in this current Q2, they are $1 B higher. If they can make 2% on the incremental sales, that’s $20 Million in additional operating profit. About $16 M after tax. Or about $0.30-0.33 in additional quarterly earnings. After next week, UNFI could have $1.00 in EPS in the bank with 2 quarters to go. Think the range of $0.85–$1.45 is reasonable for FY20? How about $1.80-2.00 in EPS with a PE of 16. $30 stock price."
There are interests in the Consumer Staples - food stocks:ACI: hit 52 weeks high today. +.50 centsCAG : +06 centsBJ: hit 52 weeks high: +.1.01KR: +.61SPTN: +.15KHC: +.20UNFI : SHOULD FOLLOW THOSE LEADERS AND GO GREEN.
"Trading volume continues to be ultra-light and the earnings call is scheduled for 09/29. The number of shares shorted is steady and lower than last year. Will the cycle typical for the last few quarters continue? I miss those days of sideways, saw tooth trading patterns and easy swing trade money. Anyone know what is going on inside UNFI? Any heads rolling or dead wood getting pruned yet? Better start soon or it will be same shirt, different day. Crank up the value."
1. Upgrade from MKM Partners last week2. Upgrade from McLean Capital Management last week3. Labor dispute resolution with a long term contract4. Pandemic continues5. The economic recovery has been recalibrated to be much slower than originally thought6. Work from Home trend continues to increase as a permanent option7. The organic trend continues and UNFI is a leader8. Amazon will continue to outsource its carbon footprint -- hence will not replace UNFI distribution9. Cross-selling of Supervalue and UNFI products will continue and drive gains10. Debt paydown will add approximately .5/share every year for next three years
"in California UNFI is definitely taking over the wholesale industry. We are a small retail grocer and doing very well in this current Covid pandemic. As manager of the meat department I purchase twice a week. We just pulled in $25,000 dollars of meat products today. UNFI is a forward thinking company. Preorders are key to competitive pricing. UNFI has the protein and grocery sales locked in for Christmas and beyond."
I am pretty confident UNFI will earn over 4 dollars per share this year. After 2 quarters they have 1.76 EPS.Historically quarters 3 and 4 have been their best quarters. In 2022 they will most likely add a dividend.Thanks to covid doing nothing for 12 months seems easy peasy.Know what you own.
"1,101 $50 calls vs 4,823 $45 puts -> this balloon is popping"
"I’m bullish on UNFI over the long term because it seems extremely undervalued when compared with other companies. And once the market recognizes it, UNFI’s valuation will rise. UNFI ranks 103rd in revenue of all US based companies at $27.3B (TTM). Of the top 300 US based companies ranked on revenues (TTM greater than $10.9B), only 7 of them have market caps less than UNFI. When the listing is expanded to the top 500 US based companies ranked on revenues (TTM greater than $5.69B), only 10 additional companies are added to the list. In fact, there is only 1 company that has higher revenues than UNFI, but a lower market cap.The same holds true for EV. Only 9 companies in the 300 grouping have a smaller EV than UNFI, and when the list is expanded to 500, only 25 other companies are added to the list.Only 1 company in the 300 grouping has a PSR less than UNFI, and when the list is expanded to the 500, only 3 other companies are added. The P/E (next yr’s est) is only slightly less than this year’s, which suggests that the analysts are underestimating the future impact of the following:1. Economies of scale (efficiency improvements),2. Debt reduction, 3. Revenue stability and growth, 4. Upcoming events (earnings, Investor Day 2021, etc.).UNFI’s upside potential seems much higher than its downside risk."
When the stock price hits $63.We will have a PE of 15 and a3 1/2 billion market cap. Seems easily doable…Holding on tight
"Given UNFI’s size (in top 100 US based companies based on revenue), the economic benefits that they will derive from “economies of scale” should be a significant tailwind for the long term. A look at UNFI’s most recent earning’s call transcript provides an insight into what they are doing to improve their profit margin. Revenue Growth:- Cross-selling- Professional services- Sales growth (food-at-home vs dining out)- E-commerce platform- Community Marketplace (see today’s announcement)- Riverside, CA facility (new) and Ridgefield, WA (expansion) fully operational- New Allentown, PA under way (Key Food)- Whole Foods contract extensionExpense Reductions (efficiency improvements):- Debt reduction/refinancing- Optimizing distribution networks- Generating additional operating benefits (Value Path initiative)- Investing in technologies to gain insight into future business growth and to lower cost structure"
"wooglin had called me a ""tool"" yesterday. Why he said that I honestly have no idea. It was rude. So in summary, the live shot I'd posted below was of wooglin and the longs at premarket......and here is wooglin now:"
"UNFI was a clear beneficiary of the COVID-19 pandemic environment amid a major shift towards retail consumer food spending, Seaport Global Securities analysts said in an initiation note.The United Natural Foods Analyst: Eric Larson initiated coverage of United Natural Foods with a Neutral rating.The United Natural Foods Thesis: United Natural deserves credit for its ""superb"" performance during a ""very difficult"" operating environment, Larson wrote in the note. The company managed to stand out among its peers by sourcing products that others couldn't and this resulted in a new $1 billion annual sales customer, Key Foods Cooperative.Looking forward, retail grocery sales could remain elevated through the first half of 2021, but it is a ""tough call"" to model the sales trajectory afterward, the analyst wrote. There is plenty of pent-up demand to dine out, but at the same it is not clear if a large enough number of independent restaurants and away-from-home establishments will ""survive"" to address the demand.Meanwhile, United Natural allocated part of its strong revenue growth to deleverage the balance sheet as its net debt leverage ratio could end 2021 at 3.5 times, or at least a year ahead of management's prior timeline.Finally, a combination of strong execution and a clear competitive advantage may be factored into the stock's price that is up nearly six-fold since April 2020, the analyst wrote. Nevertheless, the ""stock is not expensive"" on an EPS or EV/EBITDA multiple basis."
My top position now is NMM trading at 50 percent of book value 30 percent net Asset value. They are going to earnings$12 this year and next. Cheapest stock I have ever seen.

"In just 2 weeks my area Save-A-Lot has been decimated! It was one of their very best stores, a flagship. Very busy, and a pleasure to shop at. Apparently some pinhead yuppy trash in 'corporate' has started tinkering with things. The excellent store manager and employees are appalled at what is happening. Some of the best suppliers have been stiffed. The store is running out of everything and there is nothing coming to replace it. A feeble shipment of inferior, unwanted junk food product at crazy inflato prices did appear and is absolutely shunned by all shoppers. They had the shelves lowered to 'make it seem like more is there'. Meanwhile the store has NO crackers, NO chips or coffee, frozen staples, deli meat, not even bread! and is running out of dairy, meat, canned goods, pasta, just about everything. Weekly sales have plunged by 75%!!! I kid you not!This is corporate folly at it's absolute worst! A beloved store, I watch the many befuddled shoppers straggle to the checkout with hardly anything in their carts now, shaking their heads. They are already plotting their next shopping trips out of town. Sad to see. How long until this new reality reflects in the UNFI stock prices?"
3-2-1.... RUG PULL !!
UNFI can't find drivers. our order yesterday was 9 hours late because they couldn't find anyone to haul the load! Can't sandy drive a truck??
"I dare you not to laugh:Sysco market cap 40B, revenue 51B and book value $3.UNFI market cap 2B revenue 27B and book value $23Sysco stock price $79.75UNFI stock price 37.29Therefore Sysco is at least 8 times more expensive than UNFI."
"The Fed is tapering off the cheap money and that likely is causing the market to slow down. Big money is waiting around to see what happens. So the kettle is simmering, but I doubt $50/share is in the cards near term."
"This thing tends to overshoot, good short start IMO"
"just bought ngvc,better margins and pays a dividend..unfi just makes executive's rich.kurt take your profit and invest wisely."
"Somebody please verify my math: CEO Steve Spinner sold 75,000 shares on May 7th CEO Steve Spinner sold 109,643 shares on May 17thThat seems to represent 100% of the CEO's shares!?!? See today's news link from Yahoo:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-natural-foods-inc-unfi-071516996.htmlAdditionally, since March of 2021 multiple insiders have sold substantial numbers of shares. I am not sure this is a reason to panic, but it makes me doubt we will see any strongly positive news in the immediate term such as sale of Cub, new distribution channels, online explosion, etc. Is my reasoning sound? I have been long UNFI for over 1 year, but this makes me nervous."

Game over!
"UNFI is still a ""BUY"" according to CFRA research firm: ""CFRA MAINTAINS BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF UNITED NATURAL FOODS, INC. with a price target to $26.3:41 pm ET September 29, 2020 (CFRA)""""We lift our target by $2 to $26, calculated by applying an EV/EBITDA multiple of 6.8x against our FY 21 (July) adj-EBITDA estimate of $610M (excludes UNFI's retail business). We lift our FY 21 EPS estimate to $3.50 from $1.95 and begin FY 22's at $3.55. UNFI posts fiscal Q4 adj-EPS of $1.06 vs. $0.35 (+203%), well above the $0.74 consensus; sales beat by 1.5% and adj-EBITDA beat by 4%. However, given all the reclassification noise this quarter, certain figures may not be comparable to consensus. Nonetheless, in our view it was a banner quarter, and the favorable operating environment resulted in strong free cash flow which drove debt reduction (leverage ratio is now 4.0x) and provides UNFI with much greater flexibility in FY 21 when food-at-home demand likely moderates. Yet the shares are trading lower today, likely on news that CEO Steve Spinner is soon stepping down, which we view as an overreaction given that Supervalu integration efforts are nearly complete and UNFI is set to embark on a new chapter."""
"everyone complains on this board about management, when Steve Spinner took over as CEO there were 49 million shares outstanding today we are at 59 million over ten years a small increase. revenues were about 2 billion per year now we are at 27 billion. free cash flow was at 100 million per year now we are at 700 million. the share price is about the same place it was when he took over, we should be at least 7x higher. the management has done their job, now the stock market has to do is job. good luck longs."
Steve said at the start of this year that they would annouce a new CEO by July. In their investor day they annouced the new CEO would happen this fall.I do not like when management blatanly lie to investors.It makes you wonder what else are they lieing about. They also increased wages by $2 per hour when the covid pandemic began. Now that it's over how about removing the big expense. The recent insider selling also indicates their own lack of confidence in themselves. IMHO new management can't get here soon enough.This organization lacks strong leadership.Maybe they should hire the truck union leader to run this company. (Just like China).Sorry folks but I had to vent.
"***PLEASE READ***Over the past three days there have been multiple reports of Amazon entering the Minnesota grocery marketplace (Google). I may be pulling at strings but I got to thinking. Spinner announced his retirement this summer. He also seemed entirely sure of the contract renewal with Amazon coming this spring on the earnings call. If Amazon is entering the MINN. market the acquisition of cub gives them quick market share. It also gives them swaths of customer data for which they can provide targeted digital advertising and begin to integrate their online platform. As they begin to open super centers they can move market share there. They could also serve as fulfillment centers for online orders. I was never a believer of an Amazon acquisition of Unfi or cub for that matter, but this seems to coincidental. Announce that they are divesting from cub in a sale to Amazon where they retain the rights to supply the stores. This is the final chapter of spinners time as ceo and they begin to execute on their plan to focus solely on distribution. The price action, downgrades/upgrades, believe their was unusual call options purchased for feb. Its suspicious to me, UNFI shareholders please share your thoughts"
"There are food stocks i.e. BJ, ACI KHC are UP while UNFI has been down and way oversold in the last severaldays.... It was down today again in sympathy with the whole financial markets.... Should be rebound soon asand should heading back to $47 near term..... I am starting to accumulate UNFI. What a great bargain pricingright now."

Take advantage of today'ssell off and add more to your holdings as we see mutual fund managers are doing right now. ...We see $46 near term....."
"If you are buying UNFI for the earnings I suggest getting in now and hold. The day before will be a small gain as the stochastic for this is already moving up. It will have good earnings we already know that, will it return to the high it had previously?? Buy at 19, you could see 23 I think. If you model after SPTN, they dropped to 17 a few days before the earnings call. Then if bought day before the earnings you got a little upside but not like the 17. But, for the future UNFI should keep moving up as will SPTN due to not only COVID but there is increasing inflation in the grocery business and that is when they make the big bucks by buying low and selling real high. Both are good long term holds. SPTN needs to name a new CEO and get some leadership and not sure about UNFI as I am not real familiar with them. Good Luck!"

On the list of first actions for Sandy will hopefully to upgrade IR role. Volume indicates UNFI no longer on anyone's radar.
New CEO Coke 1989-2018New Chair Coke 1979-2001. These 2 are very well acquainted I think.
oppenheimer2021 predicted to be as good or better than 2020. Retail is providing cash!Double digit growth possible. no slow down seen.
"UNFI, given its size (post SuperValu acquisition/integration), now has cost advantages due to its “economies of scale”. This example demonstrates that even small changes in its net profit margins can significantly impact earnings. UNFI’s consensus FY2021 earnings is $3.39 and FY2022 is $3.46. This represents a 2% increase in earnings, but only a 0.014% increase in the net profit margin (earnings/revenue). If UNFI can successfully deliver on their plans and improve their net profit margin by just 0.1% (vs 0.014%), then earnings will increase by $0.49/share (+14%). Here’s how UNFI is planning on improving their profit margin (from last earnings call):Revenue Growth: - Cross-selling- Professional services- Sales growth- E-commerce and Community Marketplace (4/7/21)- New Allentown, PA DC (Key Food)- Whole Foods contract ext.Expense Reductions (efficiency improvements):- Debt reduction/refinancing- Optimizing networks- Value Path initiative- Investing in technologies"
"GREAT question from another board---""What happens to this stock if CV goes away and grocery demand goes back to normal as originally expected?My take below---look fwd to all your feedback--Most expected exactly what you say=temporary 1 to 2 qtr max spike in grocery demand then back to normal as CV-19 fades in summer. Even if this scenario played out debt paydown cleared the top concern about this stock. BUT nobody expected longer term surge in grocery demand--this is what is playing out. Stats== >Remote work peaked at 50% from 5% pre Covid>>>Chief Economist from MS- Forecast remote work to permanently stay at 30%! Work from home cuts ""dining out"" by~ 8%>Unexpected infections rise in summer in HOT places(TX, FL, AZ etc.) cuts dining out and they can't eat outside cuz too HOT>Fall in the north limits dining out at restaurants =TOO COLD>Many Colleges and Univ. going online(Harvard, Yale, UMass)Bottom line- Dining out less is not temporary and this shifts to grocery demand for a sustained period of at least next summer! Vaccine is estimated for spring 2021 so won't be widely activated until next summer. Hope that makes some sense to your Q."
There’s an actual green stock today?
"United Natural Foods price target raised to $22 from $10 at BMO Capital BMO Capital analyst Kelly Bania raised the firm's price target on United Natural Foods to $22 from $10 and keeps a Market Perform rating on the shares. The food-at-home consumption trend remains strong due to the impact of the coronavirus with no signs of slowing down, the analyst tells investors in a research note, pointing to the company's 12% increase in Q3 sales. Bania adds that recessionary pressure should drive continued medium-term strength for United Natural Foods following initial virus-related stock-ups, though longer-term pressures for small and regional grocers are likely to return at some point.Read more at:https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3094833"
Set 40% of my holdings trail stop 3%.
"The low margin, but high (sales) volume biz model works for me as long as UNFI continues to cut expenses and maintains profitability. Debt is being reduced. Stock buy backs might occur. Dividends are doubtful and not expected. If stock volume increases, maybe the valuations will increase. All good for longs. I will continue to drink the kool-aide for another quarter and see what the new guy can do... Now if IR can just put out a few PR pieces other than stuff on canibis distribution that is meaningless."
"@kurt, @navid, @corey, @wooglin do you feel more or less certain on the fundamental situation today than you did when you bought below 10 in first days of CV-19? How about after the June ER? Def interested in your own views as mine may be too bullish.-My take is CV-19 demand on grocery has sustained 6-8 months longer than anyone anticipated even during the June ER when re-open trade started to take hold. Most believed this would disappear in summer and maybe get a re-spike in fall/winter but not STAY all thru summer. According to UNFI Steve Reich YouTube video in late March/April many suppliers called UNFI to ""re-confirm"" the huge orders they were placing would not be RETURNED! ie...assuming this would go away like all other similar pandemics besides Spanish flu in 1918 ;)So at the time of the full 2020 guidance in June it was too conservative due to fill rates gap and uncertainty as to whether CV-19 demand would stay elevated."
At 52 bucks we have a market cap of 3 billion.The exact amount of cash it paid for Supervalu in 2018.That was also pre Amazon buying whole foods.Therefore why should I sell my shares under 50 bucks?Looks like my patience and yours is slowly being rewarded. Go luck to all.
"UNFI received Zacks' STRONG BUY - see ZACKS 's Nov 2 article.Also, see the article on ""Whole Foods Predicts 2021's Biggest Health Food Trends8:50 am ET October 29, 2020 (PR Newswire) Print"".With the Covid 19 worries, more and more families turn to NATURAL HEALTH FOODS""for health reasons. No matter how expensive the prices, it is essential to stay healthythrough home prepared foods for your love ones. Whole Foods/Amazon is UNFI biggest customers and they predicts 2021 will be the biggest healthfood trends, this would translate more natural health foods will be supplies from UNFI to Whole Foods.You will see more and more natural foods from UNFI in all the traditional supermarkets. With today's pricedrop, it is a great opportunity to accumulate more UNFI shares at deep discounts."
"Based on Whole foods struggles, It is very clear that Amazon has a long way to dominate groceries. First they need scale before they can attempt distribution. Amazon will continue to rely on UNFi as a partner for grocery distribution. Amazons other businesses continue to grow thereby bringing the attention of regulators. That will make it harder for Amazon to vertically integrate grocery distribution if and when it achieves scale. UNFI has a huge value proposition for grocery retailers. Single source for organic and conventional groceries at a very good price point with high quality and reliability. This has been proven this quarter with the Key Foods win from C&S grocers. This was on the east coast where C&S is traditionally very strong. UNFI notched another win with San Diego Farmers outlet. Both of these together prove that UNFI is the best choice for large chains (400+ stores ) and small independent grocery operators across united states. Coast to coast."
congrats to the longs. still undervalued in my opinion. just hold and have lots of patience! lol
WOW!!! UNFI picked up an outstanding CEO and a lead board director that was announced today.I am seeing UNFI is heading $35 by Friday and moving forward to $42 near term....It is worth waiting forUNFI to shine.....
"This stock is a joke. How do they expect to deliver the food, by horse-wagon?"
"UNFI Selected as New Grocery Wholesaler by Key Food - October 06, 2020 PROVIDENCE, R.I.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- United Natural Foods, Inc. (NYSE: UNFI) (“UNFI”) and Key Food Stores Co-Operative, Inc. (“Key Food”) today announced they have reached a long-term supply agreement for UNFI to serve as the primary grocery wholesaler to Key Food with expected sales to UNFI of approximately $10 billion over 10 years. Founded in 1937, Key Food is a co-operative of independently owned and corporate supermarkets located in New York, New Jersey, other states in the Northeast, and Florida. Stores are operated under multiple banner names that include Key Food, The Food Emporium, Food Universe, Food Dynasty, SuperFresh, and Gala Foods Supermarkets. https://ir.unfi.com/news/press-release-details/2020/UNFI-Selected-as-New-Grocery-Wholesaler-by-Key-Food/default.aspx"
"I work at whole foods in California. Just the prime shipping sales increasing our store revenue to 20+ percent of total.I seen the craziness first hand last month. I seen all the out of stocks, and then the limits on items each customer can buy. I saw the long lines, all the way from the cashier's to the very back of the store. Every day ther e lines at all the grocery stores at these times. But you know whole foods is just one part of UNFI now. Just imagine all the other stores booming. This is facts not hype."
"Hi my friends. I am reading a lot of comments here and see that a lot of people are confused as to why a great earnings report would cause a stock price to fall so drastically.You guys need to understand who you are playing against. If you are retail investors, this is very important for you to understand...This stock has ~85% institutional ownership. These institutions have large amounts of money, and shares tied up in this stock. They may have been holding this stock since it was at $5. Since these institutions hold so many shares, they cannot just simply sell anytime they want. There has to be liquidity in the market. There needs to be enough buyers to buy their shares...therefore, institutions are going to sell into good news. When there is good news, the retail market gets hot and wants to buy shares.When a large institution starts to sell into the buy orders all the way down the book, the price of the stock is going to naturally drop."
"Seeking Alpha...people love it when there's a positive piece on company they are long; flip side applies.That said, ""Misunderstood Wholesaler On Sale: United Natural Foods"" was published this morning (2/6).Here's a few lines--including "" UNFI is going to be much higher or a 0 in a few years""""•United Natural Foods has plummeted in recent years, accelerated by debt burden.•Assets held by the business are not being attributed significant value by the market.•Given a debt load about 8x the market cap, expected debt paydowns could re-rate shares significantly.United Natural Foods (UNFI) represents a boom or bust deep-value play as a wholesale food distributor. Recent misunderstandings regarding their acquisition of Supervalu and the resulting significant debt load have obscured their value from the market, value that will become apparent over the ensuing quarters. Many analysts have recently lowered their price targets into the single digits for this stock, but as you will see, UNFI is going to be much higher or a 0 in a few years, there is practically no middle ground. Given the minuscule market capitalization (400m) compared to the company's financial debt (~3B), I will show my analysis on an EV basis rather than just the outstanding shares."""

"Regarding QFCTo follow up from Smiley's post yesterday. Kroger banners for the most part work with DPI for Natural and Specialty, including the QFC stores. I just did a tag check at QFC and there are new tags up with UNFI noted as the distributor. I asked someone in receiving and they confirmed DPI was transitioning to UNFI, wasn't sure if it was a total distributor switch or what. I saw UNFI tags for chill, frozen and dry groceries. FYI- not sure what this means but it's worth noting and is great news for more business."

"Investors can obtain some insight as to UNFI's valuation by taking a look at the pending buyout of Core-Mark by PFGC for $2.5 billion and debt assumption. Core-Mark is a significantly smaller company than UNFI and they compete in many areas---though the buyout values Core-Mark higher than UNFI's present market cap. PFGC is a direct competitor of Sysco (SYY); could UNFI be next? Regardless, UNFI now has a valuation comparison that demonstrates just how undervalued the stock still is, despite the huge move over the past year. Stay long, we're headed higher..."

"I did some additional research and wanted to provide an update to yesterday’s post. Based on solid fundamentals, I think that UNFI is undervalued, just as many of you on this board think as well. In this post, I compare UNFI against the broader market, which seems to clearly indicate that there is a huge gap in how the market values UNFI and other US based companies. Also, the stats are slightly different from yesterday’s post because I had inadvertently included some non-US based companies. - UNFI is in the TOP 200 companies in the US based on annual revenues but there are about 1700 US based companies that have market caps higher than UNFI. - UNFI is only 1 of 2 companies that have annual revenues greater than $25B and a market cap of less than $2B. Increasing the market cap limit to $5B doesn’t add any other US based companies and increasing it further to $10B only adds 5. - UNFI has a short interest of 21.5%, which is higher than 98.5% of the 1700 companies with higher market caps. - UNFI’s PSR of 0.07 is lower than any stock in the SP500. I know that UNFI is not part of that Index, but for perspective, UNFI’s stock could double (bringing its PSR to 0.14) and all but 3 companies in the Index would still have a higher PSR. - UNFI’s P/E of 11 (this year’s analysts’ estimate) would place it into the top 10% of SP500 stocks (ranked from low to high P/E). In fact, UNFI’s stock price could double (bringing its P/E to 22) and it would still be in the top 50%. In conclusion, UNFI’s upside potential is much higher than its downside risk."
I don't understand how this trades under 50 bucks
My goodness. This is spectacular.
"UNFI and NCG Extend and Expand Relationship. June 29, 2020. PROVIDENCE, R.I.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--United Natural Foods, Inc. (NYSE: UNFI) (""UNFI"") and National Co+op Grocers (NCG) today announced they have reached a long-term supply agreement extension for UNFI to continue as the primary grocery wholesaler and national distributor to NCG-affiliated retail food co-ops. NCG is one of UNFI’s largest customers. “NCG is one of the most distinguished purchasing co-ops in the nation and our team has taken great pride in helping optimize operational efficiencies and purchasing power for NCG member co-ops while providing top quality customer service,” said Chris Testa, UNFI President and Chief Marketing Officer. “We have a strong history and relationship with NCG and are thrilled they are part of our UNFI customer family. We look forward to helping them be even better positioned for future growth.” UNFI and NCG have worked together since NCG’s inception in 1999, with UNFI primarily supplying NCG member co-ops with a wide variety of natural products. With the signing of this new agreement, NCG and UNFI will focus on numerous business development initiatives resulting from UNFI’s expanded offering, providing NCG’s 147 member co-ops access to over 250,000 SKUs of natural, organic, conventional, specialty, bulk, and wellness products. This offering includes the addition of UNFI’s Brands+ portfolio and its more than 5,000 products across 200 store categories.To support its members, NCG is working closely with UNFI to find the best program offerings within the over 150 customizable solutions designed to provide operational flexibility and financial savings through UNFI’s Professional Services division.“UNFI’s scale and ability to service our 147 member co-ops across 38 states with a tremendous portfolio of natural, conventional, and private brand products helps ensure our members are successful and supports the continued growth of the cooperative grocery sector,” said C.E. Pugh, CEO of National Co+op Grocers. “UNFI has always had a strong leadership position in the natural channel and is now able to help us better position our stores with an expanded offering, new product categories, and more operational support. We’re looking forward to continuing our relationship with UNFI and leveraging their increased scale in the future.” https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200629005394/en/"
"Hey everyone, was just reviewing macrotrends which is a nice site for historical (up to 15 yr usually) stock data. so just for some information in the 13 yr period from 2005 to 2018 Net Income increased steadily year over year from 42 million to 166 million. this is a 295% increase or 22.69% annually, without much interruption or recessionary pressures. also revenue grew 396% during the same 13 yr period of UNFI from 2005-2018, or a 30+% increase annually. the ONLY change to these growth due to good management, and growing sales is the supervalue merger. And net income at the 50-150 million range is low to the growth stocks with high margins but this is a consumer staples retail stock.we have the same CEO as during all those years. nothing really changed, except the acquisition and BS from GS and shorts and lies about Whole Foods contract."
"this is a very interesting move by UNFI the past few weeks. We can all speculate the reason..ie short covering, amzn contract leak, long overdue appreciation for the improved results of the business. One that I'm reading more about is the return of inflation. that used to be a major force in their earnings and hasn't been around for quite a few years. what if it returned in a major way?? Just another reason to hold onto an underappreciated stock like unfi"
"UNFI: Many CEO are rewarded with the annual big bonus if the company stock hits a certain level.Needless to say, the new CEO of UNFI is working toward the company's goal in order for him to achieve hisannual big bonus.....I am seeing the UNFI will approach its last 52 weeks high of $42 by year end....I am accumulating the UNFI and stay being very patient with the stock price as the new CEO will work hardand bring UNFI to its best stock price performance, to prove that he is the best man for the job...."
"""CFRA REITERATES BUY OPINION ON SHARES OF UNITED NATURAL FOODS, INC.11:21 am ET September 22, 2020 (CFRA) PrintUNFI reports fiscal Q4 2020 earnings after the markets close on 9/28/20. We reiterate our Buy opinion as we believe consensus estimates are conservative, particularly sales, given the following: 1) food-at-home demand is still strong; 2) supplier fill rates should materially improve from fiscal Q3 2020; 3) more cross-selling opportunities exist between different customer groups; and 4) UNFI's decision to retain its Shoppers and Cub Foods retail banners for up to 24 months should be a sizable sales tailwind and help offset recent customer bankruptcies and last year's benefit of an additional week. We also expect UNFI to continue making strides in paying down debt in order to improve its leverage ratio and maximize financial flexibility. Food-at-home demand could remain elevated well after the pandemic ends given the shift to remote working/virtual schooling, increased investments made in grocery e-commerce (added convenience for the consumer), and bankruptcies expected in the foodservice channel.""UNFI opened UP $2.00 today but sold off due to markets correction. UNFI will easily beat the EPS estimate consensus $0.74 on Sept 28 (Q4-2020 earnings release). Time to accumulate UNFI."
"Investors don't realize that short sellers can literally ""control"" the pricing action on stocks that are more or less ""thinly traded"" and ""small cap"" like UNFI. They can build a ""wall of pessimism"" (like 20% of total market cap here) to cast a strong whiff of doubt to anyone who is long the stock. It could be a hedge fund (or several in sync), a potential buyer (SYY), or a player who can toss hundreds of millions around for trading (Goldman Sachs), or just a small group of rich investors that can manipulate the float of a small cap stock like this. The SEC is reluctant to go investigate small potatoes (thin budget), so this can go on for longer than one might expect. Eventually, fair value will be realized...shorts will face a reckoning. Been on both sides of battleground stocks before."
"I love all this short, short, short talk. You shorts do realize that $450 million had been lost by shorts on this stock so far. Good luck, I guess your hoping this time is different."

I like the CEO and chairman board of directors This company has $27 billion in sales and $3.50 per share in earnings. In 5 years I see $10 per share earnings. These new guys are getting their shares and options at these prices in a 1-2 years we are going to $100 in 5 years we hit $200.
Finally this company is getting what it deserves. Always had a very bad beating in the past on good or ok reports. I've been watching this company for the past year. Congratulations!

"As I mentioned earlier and others have noted as an issue as well the long delay in announcing last quarter earnings makes them less impactful and investors and analysts now focused on current quarter and beyond and just saw BoA analyst downgrade of KR, info below.(KR) — Kroger was downgraded to “neutral” from “buy” by a Bank of America analyst, citing a potential deceleration of same-store sales moving forward as restaurants start reopening. Shares of the grocery store chain slipped 0.9%."
"Here is some more information for investors that is in plain sightUNFI Revenues by QuartersNov 2019 6296 millionFeb 2020 6421 millionOct 2020 6672Jan 2021 6888Do you know what their growth is from 2019-20 to 2020-21 is for the relevant six months6.5 percent. The company grew a huge 6.5 percent at the peak of the pandemic through the months where people actually spend on holiday food. Do you know how much the average grocery store grew by -- approx 14-15 percent. That is from IRI data.Do you know how much kroger grew by 14.1 percent. If you have to maintain market share -- you have to grow as fast as competitionIf you have to gain market share -- you have to grow faster than competitionif you are losing market share -- you will grow slower than competition.UNFI unfortunately is losing market share. The reasons are multi-fold1. Independents losing share and closing down2. Big grocery retailers do their own distribution and will continue to increase the percentage of sales serviced by internal distribution vs an external distributor3. Whole foods is not really growing and Amazons focus is on Amazon Fresh. Unfortunately SPTN is the key supplier to SPTN. Given that Amazon even has an option to buy into SPTN , they will continue to favor and grow SPTN vs UNFI.My suggestion is that if you have gains that you are sitting on from last year either sell or some some in the money calls with a strike price of 10. That way you have booked your profit while deferring taxes and turning it into long term rather than short term gains."

"Bloomberg: ""U.S. Food Suppliers Are Having Trouble Keeping Shelves stocked""A few snippets:""Some of the largest U.S. food distributors are reporting difficulties in fulfilling orders as a lack of workers weighs on the supply chain.Sysco Corp,. North America's largest wholesale food distributor, is turning away customers in some areas where demand is exceeding capacity.""""Another major distributor, United Natural Foods Inc., is having trouble getting food to stores on time. The company said the labor shortages, as well as delays for some imported goods like cheese, coconut water and spices, are causing the problems.""We anticipate additional supplier challenges in the short term with gradual improvement through the fall and winter,"" a United Natural Foods representative said. The company's top priority is to support customers ""by working diligently to recover and bring their shelves back to normal inventory levels as quickly as possible.""""""The entire food sector is seeing ""massive labor shortages,"" said Benjamin Walker....at Baldor Specialty Foods, a New York distributor. ""Service levels are the lowest I've seen in my 16-year career, and it doesn't seem like it's going away anytime soon.""Finding truck drivers is ""next to impossible, "" he said, while freight costs are rising daily.""And in (somewhat) related news, there's a shortage of MCD milkshakes in the UK!"
We should see the food inflation flow through benefit this next quarter. Per Testa inflation math benefits them in a big way. May slightly be offset by higher labor costs
"I believe that UNFI's time to shine will come soon. People may be scared to go back to work but there is no free lunch that lasts forever. I wish I kept that book from the early 60's that said how to retire on $600 a month for perspective. Laughable but rent was $100 a month, new cars $2500 and food was cheap. Now you better have $1,000,000 or two and the only way to get it is to wisely invest. This stock is going higher soon and can easily provide that million. IMO"
I haven't been here in awhile. Looks like very low trade and posting volumes. Seems as if the new CEO announcement not generating too much excitement.
One of the arguments that I hear from people on this board as well as sites like seeking alpha and also some analysts is that AMZN could vertically integrate and replace UNFI business. While the possibility exists and also there are continuous business plans being put out at amazon to attempt to vertically integrate into the grocery distribution business -- Here are some reasons why amazon will not do so.1. Oursourcing amazons carbon footprint . Amazon has a goal to go carbon neutral by 2030 and probably even earlier. Distribution will add significant carbon footprint and will push out the date or increases costs. It will also increase supply chain risks2. Labor organizing . Organized labor will be more expensive for amazon. Food disttribution business is old and the labor is organized into unions. Unions will increase costs for amazon3. margins are low. Gross margins are in the 10% range with net margins even lower. 4. Vertical integration makes sense in an area that has seen execution risks from its partners. Grocery distribution has been working and has worked very well even during this pandemic.
"Investors are worried about food inflation (higher input costs--ie. raw materials) and are hitting all food stocks today. But UNFI is primarily a distributor; not a food supplier/manufacturer company like Conagra. They should be able to maintain their margins by simply passing on the costs. Stay long, still cheap here..."
And so the season of panic TP sales and hoarding starts as newscasts fan fears of fuel shortages and over-hyped (I hope) harsh winter. I hope this is a lot like watching the weather channel (or WCCO/KARE for us Twin City Norskies!) when there is a winter storm pending in the forecast and it turns out to be a dusting of sugar snow and the forecasted -30 degrees never materializes.
y'all ready for this??? talked to a grocery manager at a bar the other day... he said unfi has completely turned around. he said the last two years have been absolute dog$hit in terms of fulfillment and schedule. meaning trucks were never on time and always had almost half of what they ordered and sometimes they even had pallets destined for other stores..no more. he said now they are on time and most of the things (except for bigger supply chain issues like wasabi or whatever) are in stock.there was an article I read on simply wall street about unfi that put their fair value at 148$that's what I'm talking about! I think we'll see that in the next two years.this turn around so shortly after our new guy got in is a freaking good sign!!buy your local grocery guy a beer. they deserve it after last year. glta
The short whale has made money shorting UNFI for 3 years. I will not sell my shares till he/she has covered.30 percent of the current float is shorted. A $50 SP squats to 2.7 billion market cap. IMO this company market cap should be at least 5 billion.Know what you own.
"Keeping a lid on any over-optimism but... had not seen a day like yesterday with volume, strong close for over 6 months....then we got ANOTHER one today? Huh? May be just a ""catch-up"" to grocer's up moves last few wks(pre-downgrade) catching some shorts to magnify it. Or other possible drivers---News leaking about early 21' pending AMZN contract, warrants deal, and or Fresh & Go PR...maybe deal includes a purchase of Cub's with stipulation of UNFI still supplying 100% of the biz-ICR investor preso? It was strong but nothing new. Maybe a hedge or new institution hopped on board though. All we need is one or two to keep steady pressure to cause the short(s) to spend more to corral it down. Maybe this steady buyer caused some short covering last few days as it broke above the key technical levels.-ACI earnings report? Don't think so but outlook was very good so likely contributed some-Maybe Najerian & crew still pushing this up..-Polar vortex forecast a stormy monthly forecast helping grocery even higher(this is a stretch I know)FYI----This Friday we get advance Dec 2020 retail and grocery monthly report from Census bureau..Nov grocery mkt sales were 11.6% Y/Y..bet we get another 11-13% print for Dec. Last time the market grew by 12% we grew by 9% which would be ~$7.6B(we did $6.8B Dec 2019) next ER...~1.25 to 1.50 EPS vs. high estimate in 90 cent range-"
"LEt me share som IRI data with you guys. Here is the link https://indices.iriworldwide.com/covid19/?i=0When you go in there choose groceries. You will see that grocery sales have been down 10% year on year overall.Last year when grocery sales were up 15% up on average UNFI reported a growth of 12 percent for April quarter and then after that around 9% . The reason being that UNFI supplies some to independents and they are continuously losing share to the links of Walmart TJS , Aldis and Ralphas. Resulting in UNFI losing market share.This phenomenon will continue. UNFI also is losing share with AMAzon because earlier they were exclusive to Amazin through whole foods but now SPTN supplies to Amazon Fresh. Whole foods is losing share to Amazon Fresh. Overall I expect UNFI to be down around 12 % compared to last year. the loss of independents will continue . It really is a losing business. The big chains like TJS and Walmart and Albertsons do their own distribution and do not want to rely on an inefficient distributor like UNFI. If you have some gains from last year , I suggest you sell and get into some more solid stocks and not one that is losing market share. If you like to gamble and lose , go ahead. LEt me know if you want any more insights on UNFI and am glad to provide it."
"All other food stocks i.e. USFD, SYY, SPTN, PFGC etc.... were earlier sold off nearly $2, since then have comeback and only lost 1/3 or .50 cents.....Expect UNFI to do the same may be at the close today."
And now what??
Earlier this year you bought at $37 spike then it went straight down to $24A couple of months later you tried another shot at $42 then again to $36 in few days.Now you recommend anyone to give it a shot at $51 neck breaking spike?
"Any thoughts on the new CEO. It's not Testa, which some worried about. Past CEO of Staples and 30+ years with Coca Cola. Seems like he's weathered and ready to bring his experience to continuing the UNFI transition to greatness and domination! I like it. Surprised there is not a larger afterhours reaction?"
"people who are shorting this stock dont have a good understanding of the following1. How long this pandemic will last. Remember this is a pandemic. After it has been declared a pandemic -- fear will still persist in the population2. How much the work from home trend has shifted demand from restaurants/cafes to grocery stores3. How much ecommerce innovation during the pandemic and ecommerce investment during the pandemic has made it easier for consumers to get groceries at the same price as they were used to in the store and thereby removed hurdles for getting groceries to consumers. This will continue to improve and improve demand for groceries. 4. How much cross selling will increase revenues for UNFI. They just got started5. How efficient grocery distribution is. This is like the efficiencies in bottling/soda industry that ELON MUSK talked about during battery day. Its been refined over decades. 80+ years. It will take at least a decade to get there for anyone to replace UNFI/Supervalu6. How much the restuarant bankruptcies will push consumers to groceries 7. The medium term increase in sales that Amazon Fresh, Amazon Go and Wholefoods will have on UNFI. 8. How much debt UNFI can pay off in the short term.9. How much reduction in interests costs Refinancing the debt will have10. How large UNFI's $2 billion brands will grow in the next 5 years. Shorts are losing every day and will continue to lose. Time is against shorts and with long becasue even without the pandemic - UNFI's cash flows were around $12 per year. This is just huge. Just hold and crush the shorts."

Remember the Amazon Prime Shoppers as well as Instacart shoppers buy off the shelves. UNFI makes $ from e-commerce, private label items, advertising, etc. To view them as simply cost + 8 to WF is to not fully understand the company and potential. Brands are still lining up to get into UNFI, once Covid is under control, trade shows are other money making activities will resume for UNFI.

"It is clearly there are sector rotation today as the whole financial markets sell-off. There are monies have beenmoving in the consumer staples, i.e. food stock, supermarkets stocks.... Should see some interests into UNFIstock soon as this stock has been sitting in the oversold condition right now."
"Here are my top 3 reasons for still being bullish on UNFI over the long term:1. Sandy Douglas- The uncertainty of “who” the new CEO has been eliminated, but not “how” he’s going to lead. My suspicion, though, is that the overall strategy will remain intact, but will become more streamlined and prioritized. 2. “Fuel the Future” Strategic Plan- It’s basically solid and sustainable. All pillars are important, but not all have the same urgency.3. UNFI’s economy of scale (see 1st strategic pillar “F” in Future)- UNFI is “the largest publicly traded wholesale distributor delivering healthier food options to people throughout the United States and Canada”. For the sake of simplicity, if UNFI’s wholesale and retail are combined, UNFI’s average revenue per SKU (they deliver 275,000 SKUs) is $100K/yr, which yields only $715/yr/SKU in earnings (average profit margin is only 0.7%). Clearly, improving the profit margins will be key to their long-term success. This “long tail” issue isn’t unique to UNFI, but with clear direction from the leadership team, its economies of scale, and with continued automation and optimization, this current weakness can become a huge opportunity."

Its stock closed at 22.93 Tuesday, up from 16.24 on Jan. 11, and its fourth straight higher close.United Natural Foods Outlines 'Better for All' CampaignOn Jan. 11, the distributor of more than 5,000 food products across 200 categories in its annual Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) report outlined its ""Better for All"" campaign. That includes zero waste to landfills by 2030. And to donate 250 million pounds of food to people in need by 2030.Alisha Real, UNFI director of Sustainability and Social Impact, said United Natural Foods is marshaling its resources for nothing less than ""to accelerate progress toward achieving our near-term and 2030 commitments to transform the foodscape and our world.""Additionally, on Jan. 14 the company named industry veteran Gloria Boyland to the board.""Gloria's extensive experience leading operational transformation at global companies, coupled with her leading-edge, future-focused logistics and supply chain knowledge, make her a valuable addition to our Board,"" said Steven Spinner, UNFI Chairman and CEO.In terms of fundamentals, last quarter United Natural Foods earnings were flat on a year-over-year basis, at 49 cents a share. However, that followed reports of 375% growth and 78% growth in EPS the prior two periods. Sales last quarter rose 6% to $6.67 billion.The company earns the No. 2 rank among its peers in the Wholesale-Food industry group. Amcon Distributing (DIT) is also among the group's highest-rated stocks.Looking For Winning Stocks? Try This Simple RoutineUnited Natural Foods is building a consolidation with a 23.48 entry.

What happened to our Sav-a-Lot? Huge reduction in inventory/ items on shelf. Prices up 20-100% on what is left. The best stuff is gone.
"Looks like we hit a short term bottom at $31, markets been ugly but UNFI had been plugging along working it's way up. Doug coming on to the board being very bearish was an excellent contrarian indicator."
"I'm surprised the volume is so low today now that an unknown is known. That said, fingers crossed re new CEO!"
"UNFI is excited to be the first wholesaler to partner with DoorDash to bring more online grocery shopping and delivery options to our independent retailers! DoorDash, the leading restaurant ordering and delivery services, has just added grocery stores to their online marketplace for a convenient, hassle-free solution to eCommerce."
Interest rates and oil have plummeted. Grocery store sales are surging. This is an ideal operating environment for UNFI
"NMM earrings tomorrow morning, may be last chance to buy cheap."
With no dividend or buyback in place the price action on UNFI seems to be more easily controlled by shorts than my SPTN shares. I think the best hope is a short squeeze at earnings. SPTN would buy shares if it were this low like they did in March. I will give it until next Wednesday to see what happens. I know everyone likes to say debt only but when a competitor 1/3 your size with similar leverage does both a dividend and buyback I don't by that UNFI can't if you really think the future is bright.
UNFI management forecast range did NOT include Coronavirus effect = The NON one-time charges earnings 75 cents/share last quarter could easily be exceeded this quarter and next quarter = ANNUALIZED RATE of at least $3 EPS.= At a very reasonable PE of 10 = $30 share.= MY TARGET PRICE six months from now = $30/share.
"Zack’s released an article this morning entitled “Pick These 5 Bargain Stocks with Attractive EV-to-EBITDA Ratios”. UNFI is included in that list.EV/EBITDA, also known as the Enterprise Multiple, is used to determine whether a company is undervalued or overvalued. A low ratio relative to its peers, for example, indicates that a company might be undervalued, whereas a high ratio indicates that the company might be overvalued. Here are the ratios for all US based companies listed as Food Distributors ranked from low to high. UNFI 8.3ANDE 10.8 (an agriculture company- not a competitor of UNFI)SPTN 14.4USFD 38.1 (food service industry)SYY 47.3 (food service industry)PFGC 48.9 (food service industry)And to think that UNFI is in the TOP 100 US-Based companies for revenue, has a market cap of less than $2B, and a short interest (% of shares outstanding 3/15/2021) of 18.66%. Seems very undervalued to me."
"Another challenge: To add to Ctahoot’s post listed below, use whatever stock filter that you normally use, and I challenge you to find any other stock that provides as much value as UNFI does. One caveat, though, it must also have a high short interest (UNFI currently at 22% of shares outstanding). I’m not an accountant, but in my opinion, UNFI is undervalued and their upside far outweighs their potential downside. Earnings will be announced premarket on March 10, and if a new CEO and/or a renegotiated Whole Foods contract isn’t announced beforehand, then they will certainly be topics for the earning’s call.Here are some of UNFI metrics:- PSR 0.05- EV/Revenue of 0.195- Price/CashFlow of 3.8- Price/Book of 1.28- P/E of 8.5 (current year- consensus)Other factors that I considered was that the integration with SuperValu seems almost complete, the repricing of its senior secured term loan facility, the possible sale or spin-off of Cub Foods and Shoppers supermarkets, the increased “food at home” trend, and its net debt reduction. I’m sure that there are some other factors that I didn’t list, but feel free to add to the list."
"Stock screener- statistical tails.UNFI has an 85.1% Institutional Ownership, which when ranked against the top 100 US Based revenue generating companies, it’s in the top 20%. Although not part of the SP500, if ranked alongside them, it would be in the top 50%. According to Investopedia, “stocks with a large amount of institutional ownership are often looked upon favorably.” As I posted yesterday, UNFI is only 1 of 2 US based stocks that have revenues greater than $25B and market caps less than $2B. Furthermore, those same 2 companies have the fewest shares outstanding. Also, UNFI is only 1 of 2 companies of the top 100 US based top revenues generating companies to have a P/E (both this yr’s, and next yr’s, estimate) of less than 10. Given the high Institutional Ownership and low P/E’s, I’m still puzzled as to why, at last count (3/15/2021), 10.51M of UNFI’s outstanding shares were short (18.7% of the shares outstanding)."
"Congrats to all the longs on this board that have stayed patient over the past 18 months, enjoyingthe ride from single digits to $50. It's not easy to find stocks undervalued by most of Wall Street, and to shrug off commentary from all the shorts on this board. Well played! Now we have a market friendly new CEO and more attention from the Street. Let's grind higher as Now $80 (once upon a time UNFI visited this level) is in our sights. Stay long..."
"For those who saw the following announcement: “UNFI today announced it has entered into a reseller agreement with DASH to bring on-demand grocery delivery solutions to independent retailers nationwide through the DoorDash marketplace”. Here’s a quick comparison between UNFI and DASH:UNFI has 6.4X more revenue than DASH, but DASH’s market cap is about 27X greater than UNFI’s. In other words, DASH has a PSR that is about 180X greater than UNFI’s. Also, UNFI’s P/E (next yr’s estimate) is 10.1, while DASH’s is expected to be negative. While DASH very well be a good investment over the long term, I think that much of its upside is already baked into its stock price. On the other hand, the market seems to be discounting UNFI. There’s an old maxim that says, “during a gold rush, sell shovels”."
If you invested 3 years ago you're at break even today . Congratulations. Company doesn't fit for investing.
And down we go!
Im not super stoked about their update on guidance. It basically implies Q4 is only going to see EPS of $1.0 which I am very confused about. Obviously its more than original guidance but that is not much more given conditions.
"Analysts continue to measure UNFI by performance post CV-19 into 2022-OK fine. Lets analyze that----Demand tailwinds diminish but stay elevated compared to pre CV-19 due to work from home(from 3% pre CV to >60% at peak, to 30% permanently according to multiple research studies/forecasts) =10X more work remote permanently!). Restaurants will spike for a bit after vaccine in 2021 summer as pent up demand soars(like the roaring 20's) but normalize back home due to remote work-Fill Rates normalize(today they are improving but still not back to normal)-Promotional spending is zero now it will come back and become a tailwind-New product intros(big esp. in organic world) slotting fees are zero right now and a headwind but will come back-Acquisition projects like automation, prof svcs improve operating margin-New contracts like Key which will add $25M to botom line in 2022(according to analysr report) continue to de-risk AMZN biz as % of our sales(from 40% to 18% now down to ?). Of course AMZN ""Go/Fresh etc."" will likely start to pick up momentum now and that 3.6% growth we saw last ER will accelerate--OK with that ;)-Cross-selling momentum continues-DEBT from cash flow down >300M-DEBT down from asset sales...200M in corp owned R/E to be sold, Cub Foods to be sold=$X00M?Some real smart people up here can probably insert $impact to each piece of this list or add things I missed.I feel like whatever above is--- UNFI just is judged with a moving target whilst other food related stocks, pc stocks, home goods stocks tripled that pulled forward 3 years of sales but analysts not judging them the same way looking at their relative valuations(not saying this should ever have a valuation anything close to tech nor discretionary stcks but cmon)"
"FWIW, today William Kirk reiterated his buy on UNFI. He increased his PT to 59.00 from 46.00.Four other analysts have chimed in with all keeping their ratings and targets the same."
"Here’s a quick snapshot of how UNFI compares to other US based companies: - UNFI, with $26.9B annual revenue, ranks #106 of all US based companies in revenue, but ranks #1682 in market cap at only $1.96B.- UNFI is the only US based company with annual revenues greater than $25B and a market cap of less than $2B. Increasing the market cap limit to $5B doesn’t add any other US based companies and increasing it further to $10B only adds 5.- UNFI’s PSR of 0.07 is lower than any stock in the SP500. I know that UNFI is not part of that Index, but for perspective, UNFI’s stock price could double (bringing its PSR to 0.14) and all but 3 companies in the Index would still have a higher PSR.- UNFI’s P/E of 9.4 (this year’s analysts’ estimate) would place it into the top 10% of SP500 stocks (ranked from low to high P/E).Given UNFI’s current size and its economy of scale, even small improvements in its profit margin can have big impacts on its earnings. Personally, I’m still bullish on UNFI over the long term and think that the FY2022 guidance that the new leadership team will provide at the next month’s ER should be positive."

"The consumer staples ETF is approaching to its 52 weeks high and only .40 cents from its high. and many food stocks are up over $2 and hitting new high. And some other food stocks are just .50 cents to new high. GO GREEN ""UNFI"" and should hit at least $34 today....."
look at the chart. Easy short on this one. Hedgefunds agree. I will ride their coat tails down to 40.00.
"My predictions within a 2 year timeframe are bull case 6x, base case 4x, bear case 2x. This is given the positive trajectory of the business, current undervaluation, covid-induced trends, emerging positive sentiment change on this stock, and possible developing rotation to value stocks that analysts seem to be pushing. Then you have the pending news items that could supercharge the share price, like new CEO appointment, Amazon / Whole Foods deal, and earnings surprises. I suspect that the projected earning could be conservative by 25% plus or minus, based on recent results as well as previous comments from CEO where he mentioned wanting to take a more conservative approach to estimates than they did after the Supervalu acquisition. Or to sum it up like @kurt, this is going to $100 :)"

The consumer staples sector has been in the top performance in all sectors in the morning and UNFI belongs to this sector. UNFI has come back slowly from the big morning sell-off in the food stocks. UNFI has reboundedback to small gain due to oversold condition. The DOW 30 is trying to hit new high today.... Hope to seeUNFI to close above 32.25 todlay.
How easy/difficult is it to switch distributors and why would you? ... service? ordering platform? product offering? anyone on this board with industry experience or knowledge that can speak to UNFI's Advantage/Disadvantage?
"earnings tomorrow morning, earnings releases have been dangerous for unfi share price. I hope this time is different."
"Well, IR just posted that UNFI gave an ""Employment Inducement Grant""to Mr. Douglas. Funny, granting the new guy a boatload of shares is not unexpected, but calling it an ""INDUCEMENT"" Kinda sounds like when your college roommate tries to set you up on a blind date and says ""well she has a great personallity and her dad owns the bar""... Might be legal boiler plate, but sounds what to pc for me!"

Within the next 12 months UNFI management has predicted the following.1- New CEO announcement.2-Cub sale with proceeds to reduce debt.3-Share buyback or dividend.These plus all other UNFI activities will be very accretive to their stock price.If UNFI approached Amazon and offer them UNFI for 5 billion dollars. Amazon would scoop them up in a heartbeat. That would be a 95 SP.Know what you own.

"I beefed up my position this am, still trading on old algorithms, new CEO not factored in yet and bad news on Delta variant leaked earlier"
"It appears we now have a solid base at at least $35 and analysts are now having to revisit their price targets for this company--they are going up. Despite the good numbers, this stock still has a stubbornly high short interest. Lots of technical shorts go after stocks after big upward moves---they assume the stock has overshot fair value and is due for a big pullback. They've been very wrong here for the past year and are likely to continue to have to pay up for shares to avoid getting squeezed. Stay long..."
"I, like many on this board, am bullish on UNFI. One of my guiding principles is, “If at all possible, never sacrifice long-term potential for short-term gain.” I admit, though, that this is not an easy perspective to maintain given the market’s daily volatility and the instant gratification society that we live in. However, based on UNFI’s solid fundamentals, its current vision (“UNFI at ICR- Better Food Better Future”), and it’s ESG stance (“Better for All”), it’s long-term potential seems clear. This clarity will come into even sharper focus when this quarter’s earnings are announced, along with the much-anticipated announcements concerning a new CEO and a renegotiated Whole Foods’ contract."
"If UNFI were to have earnings of $1.40 over the whole year, I would understand the $17/$18 price tag, giving it a 12/13 pe ratio, but this is just what is expected over the quarter. With increased sales, UNFI is able to reduce their debt levels. Once people go back to their old habits though, UNFI's sales will begin to decline, but earnings will stay fairly strong given they continue to take advantage of the current situation and pay off more of their debt. If this company were valued like its competitors, it would easily be over $40, but UNFI received a lot of negative sentiment over the past couple of years, so it is going to take time for them to recover from that. I agree that UNFI's share price could reach $60+, but over the mid/long term, not any time soon; full value takes time to be realized, and UNFI needs to prove that they can continue this trend of debt reduction and strong earnings. I am very bullish on UNFI though and have a $30 target year end. Hopefully this quarter's earnings call can give us a positive outlook beyond this quarter, and more investors will hop on the UNFI train."
"UNFI : the Q2-2021 that was released on Mar 10-2021 beat all consensus estimated on both EPS and REVENUE. In addition, the announcement of renewal contract to Whole Foods/Amazon as UNFI Extends Distribution Partnership With Whole Foods Market to September 2027. UNFI has achieved all the criteriato be both Value and Growth stock by many investment research firms. The 2021 will be a great year for UNFI as US will be fully vaccinated soon. Life will go back to normal...and people will go out to enjoy life, and spending $$ more on healthy and natural foods in order to sustain a healthy life no matter how high the healthy and natural foods cost you.Family life is so important...It will most likely to benefit UNFI and Whole Foods.....and other healthy and natural food stocks as well.USFD ( with its disappointed earnings released today, sold off BIG but has come back BIG too, should not effect UNFI stock price today 's trading at all, but for some reasons, it did... Buy this deep discount on UNFI and it will bounce back tomorrow or this week to $38 near term... I am a buyer of UNFI today.All foods stocks are GREEN that help the consumer staples sector GREEN. The consumer staples sector has performed great and ranked between first and second all day long. UNFI should bounce back by the close today...."
"UNFI is not going away. Business and the economy will flourish. Many (most?) jobs will continue to exist but will morph in ways yet to be determined. Many people will leave jobs they hated and will take some time to re-enter. Low wage workers got the shaft, button they can pick and choose (for now) from multiple jobs. One of my daughters is working in a coffee shop making $19/hr with tips the other just graduated from college and had two good job offers on the same day 2 days prior to walking across the stage. This is a Golden Age and you can be fearful, or excited for the change. Carpe Diem! It may fall further again tomorrow and this week, but even with this current management team, I think it should have a long term share value well over $40."
"The volume on UNFI is consistently low (except on Earnings days). Some have shared concerns about defections, such as Coburns. Ok, that is normal business. The teamster and fuel costs are similar across the board (all truckers, union or not, are paid well). Everyone is dealing with COVID. The issue about the open CEO position has been dealt with. The world is still spinning and people WILL be eating at home again for another cycle. All good or UNFI. Inflation will not hurt UNFI and actually adds to he bottom line. UNFI is at the 200 day moving average. I likely will drift up into the high $30's- low $40's by Mid September's next earnings. I do not see it falling lower. Are there any bears out there? Where are the shorts? Mr Market will tell me where I am wrong, but are there any haters out there to flip my basket of eggs on the floor?"
It should be obvious to all of those who participate in the stock exchanges that unrestricted shorting of stock is a systemic risk to our financial system.Steps must be taken asap to create a more level playing field for everyone.

"Why UNFI stock price is down so much after a good ER? 1. CEO step down news.2. Uncertainty of earning capability after Covid19. 3. UNFI paid down $300 million debt in the 3rd qtr, but only $50 million 4th qtr. The 4th qtr number is normal. The 3rd qtr number is large because of rapid draw down of the inventory resulting in great reduction of its working capital, which cannot be replicated in the future4. There was still a $20 million integration cost in this qtr. It seems that they haven't finished the integration. we understand that IT integration takes time and money, especially with two legacy IT systems. We may still expect some integration cost next qtr.5. Regarding to the share dilution of more than 10%. That is the stock options cost over the last year. It is way too much based on their share base. This also tells the management team doesn't care share holder interest. That is also explains that there is almost no insider purchase even when the stock price is at $6.05. They overpaid $400 million for acquisition, which is about $8 per share. This can tell they don't have a good financial capability.In summary, they had two very good qtrs because of Covid19. However, this gave investors the impression of pure luck. Investors always project the stock price based on the forward looking forecast. It is the vague forward looking forecast causing the stock dive, not the very good ER we just saw"

"Investors need to realize that ""price discovery"" is a never ending process with stocks, and that the market can and will periodically misprice stocks, especially small, lower capitalized companies like UNFI. It's currently on display with many of the EV stocks that don't even have products or sales yet, being valued in the $10-20 billion range. Over time, these stocks will get crushed and therefore ""re-priced"" by the market, but this can go on longer than most realize. UNFI is exactly in the opposite camp: mispriced by the market to the low side. This too, shall be ""re-priced"" by the market--maybe even next week. Shorts are great at distortion, but over time, value will realized---stay long."

Sandy has been seen as a 'reformer', since he putting an end to ""Non - Customer Service "" and ""Sales Prevention "" mentality that has been embedded into the Company.

"Really great job by the UNFI investor relations branch to tell everyone how monumental it is that the Amazon grocery store is opening. They made it clear that the contract they have also covers center store supply to this new grocery store. Its really an amazing and concise job they are doing in communicating the growth potential for this company.What's that? You didnt see the story in any news releases by UNFI? That's crazy, UNFIs biggest customer is Amazon/WF and surely that company opening a new growth avenue for their products would be the first thing an investor relations group would want to tout in a PR.The key to finding the news is simply by going to either Kroger's news feed or Amazon PR and newsfeed. Super simple.Great job IR."

I see the delay of the sale of retails as positive, sales are on fire and people aren't in a hurry to go back out to restaurants, I'm loving cooking at home and the $ I'm saving. Natural products are growing and whoever is playing with this stock isn't letting up yet."
"The great rotation has begun, assets, valuation and earnings do matter!"
Why didn't I sell??
"Ok, The new CEO has large company experience at Coke and 2 years at Staples (and then left??) Lets see how the market shakes this out. Should be an interesting week. On a separate note, notice how someone just happened to work just long enough to qualify for an additional year of compensation... Strange how those things work out. Good riddance to dead wood."
"Haven’t made an appearance since the spring. Most of us agree that these shares are way undervalued, and full year guidance coming up in a few weeks will further lower all of the valuation metrics (if the share price stays at this level)...My concern is that guidance doesn’t mean anything if investor sentiment doesn’t change for UNFI... I’ve owned shares since the spring, but I bought Sep $17.5 calls a couple weeks ago and I need a reason to hold strong. Kroger had a great earnings call today (not to my surprise) and nothing happened. Maybe there will be a delayed effect once investors read over the report, but will the same reaction happen after UNFI’s earnings? Will people overlook Kroger’s forward moving business and keep punishing shares and then the same happens to good ole UNFI?"

"Short did loose ALL 3 ""S"" shorts, shirts and socks today...what left on their bodies now""? be sure to cover your face.....when seeing them naked.....GO BIG @UNFI......."
Many of us over the years have stated that this company is worth 100 dollars per share.Hopefully Sandy can right the ship and get this company closer to it’s true SP value.Change is the only true constant of life. Good luck to all the longs.

no volume today? under 60k shares so far and in the red?
"the fact this has held up as well as it has this week, all week risk on, like brutally risk on (cruise lines, airlines,anything that did poorly during covid fears, etc) people shouldn't people so bearish or pessimistic especially short term. there is enough buying pressure to keep this relatively even which is a good indication this isnt getting swept up in the risk on rotation because consensus is the quarter is a good one one they want in on, they can't sell and chase. That plus the amount os short interest still remaining some good gas in the tank left."
"Earnings are coming up and we longs need to prepare for the volatility that comes each quarter as many ""occasional shorts"" like to play this name, and they've been rewarded in recent years. But this is a different company now, with new leadership and new focus on profitability. The mid 40s should be on the near horizon; stay long..."
"Ann, are you still out there? Any insights?"
"The LONG TERM TREND is NOW OUR FRIEND!!! Last week, for the first time in almost 2 years, the 200 DAY MOVING AVERAGE SLOPE was POSITIVE!!! = The LONG TERM TREND of UNFI's STOCK is NOW UPWARDS!! Not only has the 200 Day MA slope turned positive, but by the end of this week, the 50 DAY MA should RISE ABOVE the 200 Day MA = THE GOLDEN CROSS!!! WISE WORDS: >>>"" I worry less about where the average is and try and focus more on the slope of the smoothing mechanism. If prices are above an upward sloping 200 day, in all likelihood we are in an uptrend.""... >>>""We generally like to trade in the direction of the underlying trend. In other words, we would rather be swimming with the tide, not against it""<<<The BEST SITUATIONS are when the FUNDAMENTALS are being supported by the TECHNICALS.....Here is my article about the FUNDAMENTALS at UNFI, which are now being supported by the STOCK TECHNICALShttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/united-natural-foods-unfi-stock-500-gain-intelligent-investors/?published=t"
"Looks smashing! With the current market cap of just 2.8B, it seems to have room to go higher"
"Looking at the chart from the June earnings call through now, there’s been 2 major dips that showed resistance in the $14s then soon after rallied to $19+.It seems that we’ve shown resistance to that $14 level again; is the beginning of another rally from $14? Also, does anyone have thoughts if UNFI will be punished yet again at earnings without any update on the search for their next CEO? They can show the best financial results/progress in the world, but after the last earnings call, the stock price showed there’s clearly a concern with Spinner’s retirement announcement. Yes there’s likely a huge short messing with the stock price, but they could not be solely responsible for the negative ER reaction."
This has been nothing but short squeeze. No deep pocket with right mind would buy this at the top of vertical rally. Give me a break.
"I bought UNFI in May of 2019 for around $10. This was the year after the SuperValu acquisition. UNFI had been on a buying spree with (Tony's Fine Foods and others). The reason I purchased is I had held Whole Foods and the stock was behaving in a similar manner (crazy downgrades from the usual analysts, overplayed pr that suggested the sky was falling, wild fluctuations). Whole Foods continued until the day Amazon purchased.I don't know if others remember with UNFI, but the Yahoo stock price was always wrong and showed massive negative numbers, Fridays almost always tanked, there were PR reports saying UNFI's business with Whole Foods came up for renewal YEARS out, as if it was a negative. The stock was definitely being played, it felt for a while like someone was trying to push into bankruptcy. Man- I wish I had bought more at $5 when it dipped down but those were dark days.Covid probably saved the company and I think it gave it the opportunity to redirect, clean house and get aligned. I'm excited as a shareholder, I think this stock is still undervalued and there is a lot of opportunity. Unlike retailers, inflation is a good thing for UNFI.I know there are some UNFI team members on this board and I just wanted to say thank you!Good luck to all longs."
I was here as a UNFI shareholder when it went up 30 % in two days!

"CFRA on UNFI: We lift our target by $2 to $26, calculated by applying an EV/EBITDA multiple of 6.8x against our FY 21 (July) adj-EBITDA estimate of $610M (excludes UNFI's retail business). We lift our FY 21 EPS estimate to $3.50 from $1.95 and begin FY 22's at $3.55. UNFI posts fiscal Q4 adj-EPS of $1.06 vs. $0.35 (+203%), well above the $0.74 consensus; sales beat by 1.5% and adj-EBITDA beat by 4%. However, given all the reclassification noise this quarter, certain figures may not be comparable to consensus. Nonetheless, in our view it was a banner quarter, and the favorable operating environment resulted in strong free cash flow which drove debt reduction (leverage ratio is now 4.0x) and provides UNFI with much greater flexibility in FY 21 when food-at-home demand likely moderates. Yet the shares are trading lower today, likely on news that CEO Steve Spinner is soon stepping down, which we view as an overreaction given that Supervalu integration efforts are nearly complete and UNFI is set to embark on a new chapter."
"Corey, Let me help you with your estimates because they are way, way low. 1) From ongoing operations, EX of special charges, (includes 3 BKs) UNFI earned 76 cents a share last quarter.That is because the qtr includes 1 week of greatly increased business from Thanksgiving.2) This month EVERY week is much, much more volume and profits than 1 week of Thanks giving.April will be even more profitable, because UNFI has had time to better prepare for the increased volume.3) UNFI base business was running at about 50 cents qtr, before extra expenses from consolidation. 4) So, thanksgiving adds in about 25 cents/share... That one week is huge, because most people are eatingat home with families. 5) multiply 8 weeks of thanksgiving type volume = $2/share. ... then subtract out some overtime, and $2 pay raise = $1.50 or so.... which is what Justin Dopierla estimated in his SA article. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4333701-united-natural-foods-proof-markets-are-not-rational-efficient?utm_medium=email&utm_source=seeking_alpha&mail_subject=unfi-united-natural-foods-proof-that-markets-are-not-rational-or-efficient&utm_campaign=rta-stock-article&utm_content=link-26) Longer term, I do NOT expect that older/at risk people will be crowding into restaurants UNTIL there is a vaccine... which is at least 18 months from now. 7) So, my base lower end forecast for next fiscal year is about $3/share, or about 75cents/qtr... Which is why I have a target of $30 for when UNFI reports in Sept. and gives guidance for 2021 fiscal year."
"When the stock price goes to $53. Their market cap will be 3 billion, the price they paid for Supervalu.This would imply a $106 stock price to get to their 2019 true value. What have they done since 2019.A hell of a lot. Steady revenue growth.Consolidated DCs...etc."
"It appears we've seen a base form around $34, and now need some catalysts--new CEO initiatives, analyst upgrades, etc. in order to see much movement higher prior to next month's ER. This is a strong defensive play in a generally overpriced market which is ripe for an early fall correction. Still undervalued here; stay long..."
"UNFI hit 52 week high this morning and then drop due to profit taking.It will come back at least $41 this week or higher. Great earning releasedlate last week, plus the management raised the whole year uptick in bothEPS and REVENUE for FY 2021. Announced a renewed contract over 5 years last week with Whole Foods/Amazon.Take advantage of today's sell off and accumulate more to your holdings as therehave been more purchases of UNFI by mutual funds manager lately."
Hi wooglin. Let me be bold and say that right now is the time to short sell this overpriced bloated pig.
hold?
