"This is an interesting part of the press release:Armed with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8155 processor and the highly reliable BlackBerry QNX Neutrino RTOS and QNX Hypervisor, the new Haval H6S allows for scalability and flexibility in its DCC design. The ability to consolidate multiple systems with mixed criticality and different operating environments onto a single hardware platform, effectively reduces both the model's initial development and long-term costs of ownership, while still ensuring industry-leading safety and security.QCOMBBReducing long-term cost of ownership"
The world now knows this stock will be worth $100+ by February 2022 and $60 by October
"A month ago, I posted that Blackberry will start moving higher this fall, we are close enough to fall and it may be that it has already started, and here is why. You've all heard of “Buy the Rumors.” I will not add the second part of ""sell the news"" and you will understand why when you read this to the end.There are now almost everyday rumors about the possibility that the sale of patents will be announced next month (September), so investors may start piling in and the price will start to rise. There will still be pullbacks, Blackberry will still continue to be volatile, but not so much downside from here. On the day of the announcement of the patent sale, depending on how favorable it would be for BB, the SP can go very high. Of course, we all know that the pullback will happen, whenever the price rises quickly, there is always a pullback, but here it would be only for a short time and it may not be a big pullback because the IVY demo should be released in October this year. The IVY launch will take place in February 2022, just a few months after October. I would say that 2022 will be the year of Blackberry. This is just my opinion, but I may be wrong, but in any case $ 12Cad may be the history you had the opportunity to see last time last week. Blackberry is moving higher and with every pullback, it forms a new higher bottom. That's my reason why I didn't want to add the second part of ""sell the news"" because there may not be that much ""selling news"" here. In my opinion, there is a greater potential for upside than risk for downside."

No news tomorrow !Q2is a beat
I like the stock.
"It is interesting how many jump in and out of liking BB stock. For what it’s worth here is my take…JC has been at this a long time. It is understandable that many, including myself, at times get frustrated with the lack of results. Here is why I continue to believe in this long play while taking advantage of a few trades along the way!1. Within the last year the amount of new partnerships has been great!!’ Sooner than later these yield revenue.2. The patent sale negotiations and that potential boost in cash.3. The FB settlement shows those patents had true value. This settlement is a boost in cash as well. 4. The 2000 patents approved last year! Fair to say BB is forward thinking!5. The markets they are in and what those markets look like over the next 10 years. EV, IOT, and Cybersecurity.Growth, growth and growth!!6. The current market cap in comparison to CWRD, S, SNOW7. The fact that they already have a huge foundation in government and banks!The list goes on and on. There are several true longs on this board, and I hope a few more do some DD and join us.GLTA"
"Block trades for the last 15 minutes... Don't give up your shares cheap, and don't get shook/stalled!"
"Their second quarter comes at the end of August. Unless there is news re: the patent sale or earnings have increased substantially, the SP is likely to head lower. With short interest waning, this is no longer that much of a meme stock. BB now needs to climb on their own merit. With cyber security being such a huge issue, let’s hope they can capitalize on their strengths along with QNX and IVY."

Big week coming up
"Two days left in BB’s FY Q2 so the next two days should be interesting! I would think if we’re gonna hear about the patent deal, it will be in the next two day."
For those viewing now is your chance...Hurry Hurry.
wasn't this supposed to drop to 8 bucks a share a few months ago? Asking for a friend.
I think the sell of time is over for me ….. still holding 70k shares Canadian accountBb will not see single digits again……Have a great weekend
Bought another 21k share today.. totaling 171K share.. My time frame is 3-10 year ..
$13 ish THIS WEEKNext week
$BB is the best deal on the stock market right now!
I realize we really do not know what is going on until its announced but I have two questions. Is the patent deal a flat out sale so here are the patents and here is your x dollars? Or is it a sale and a revenue stream? I would think it would be a revenue stream or royalties.
blackberry has partnered with jaguar for technology for the vehicles and jaguar has partnered with waymo for self driving vehicles for level 4 atonony and waymo has partnered with magna to make the jaguars autonomous robo taxis connect the dots my friends I already posted this but it got deleted !
Most Motley analyst and all the Canadian bank analyst have this as sell or Best Buy price they’ve been quoted at is between $10 & 13 depending on how the wind blows. All a scam to get ppl to wait to buy lower or sell when all the while they are accumulating for their customers.
"Tie-up between QNX and Great Wall through NoboGoing from memory, Great Wall sold roughly 800K vehicles in 2020, but they're on track to sell 1.2 to 1.3m this year. Their worldwide sales in Q1 totaled roughly 330K.Better yet, they're hoping to reach 4m in sales by 2025, with 3.2m of that amount being EVs. https://www.electrive.com/2021/07/02/great-wall-motor-plans-to-sell-3-2-million-evs-in-2025/Meanwhile, American politicians and the Big 3 OEMs in the USA are doing their damndest to slow down Tesla. They're trying to cut Tesla out of the new incentive program and orchestrating several investigations into Tesla's claims about autonomous driving, etc.But here's the odd angle: Tesla produces cars with the most American content -- by far. It's also (though you can disagree with this point as you wish) the clear leader in just about every category of the EV + AV movement: battery efficiency, integrated supply chain, manufacturing tech, HVAC systems, miles/kwh, dedicated computer chip, full autonomy, charging network.Who's in second place? Some might argue Volkswagen, or even Volvo-Geely (a Swedish-Chinese combo, with Chinese ownership). Others might point to a handful of start-ups that still haven't produced their first vehicles (Rivian, Lucid, etc.). Most obviously though there are 6 or 7 Chinese companies who are going Full Electron Ahead into the battle with Tesla.The good news is that BB-QNX is in tight with every one of these Chinese companies.The sad news is that the Big 3 in Detroit seem to be falling behind. Honestly, they still don't seem to realize exactly what they have to do to stay in touch.FYI, here's the great Sandy Munro on these topics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hcB1Z6-A7Q"
Everyone say bye to single digits
400$ stock in 2 years
MM's don't want to allow BB to cross $11 because of the options market....if it crosses $11 then on Monday they'll have to buy a ton of shares....watch the battle in the last hr. on whether the MM's will prevent BB to cross $11.

"0508kawi3 hr. agoAdditional comment actionsHere is content of article ...BlackBerry patent sale could be announced as soon as next monthNine months after IAM first broke the story of a potential sale of BlackBerry’s patent portfolio, the deal to get it done may now be entering the endgameIt’s almost exactly five months since BlackBerry confirmed in a press release about its Q4 and full year 2021 financials that the company was looking to sell a large section of its patent portfolio:During the quarter BlackBerry entered into an exclusive negotiation with a North American entity for the potential sale of part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking. The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.This came four months after IAM had broken the news that such a sale was being considered by the Canadian telecoms business.Since that March announcement, though, and the contents of a 10K release, there has been very little public or, indeed, private comment on the state of play in how the transaction negotiations are panning out.So, while it was known that the possible deal was with a North American entity and involved that part of BlackBerry’s 38,000-strong portfolio of patents “relating primarily to non-core or legacy mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking technologies”, there was no mention of a price, the stage the negotiations had reached or the identity of the possible buyer.Inevitably, rumour finds its way into such a knowledge vacuum. Over recent months, IAM has heard all manner of things, including, most often of all, that the deal is going nowhere because the parties are so far apart on pricing; or, alternatively, that a deal is imminent and involves a single, big, Silicon Valley tech player, possibly Facebook.Our understanding, though, is that neither of these – or the many other stories doing the rounds – are correct. Instead, although parties close to the negotiations are staying tight-lipped, we believe that things are reaching a conclusion, to the extent that an agreement could be announced around the time BlackBerry releases its FY 2022 Q2 financials towards the end of September.The pricing has been more or less agreed, and the numbers are material. Meanwhile, the buyer is actually a group of entities that have been negotiating without an intermediary. That has created a level of complexity around the deal structure which explains why it is taking so long to finalise.However, while there may be an announcement in the last week of next month, closure will take longer as the deal is going to require clearance from regulatory authorities in at least two countries: Canada and the US. If everything goes well, though, the sale will be signed, sealed and delivered by the end of this year.Note – the above is not definitive, it could be wrong in places. However, what IAM is confident in saying is that the deal is progressing, pricing is not an issue, the potential buyer is not a single company and the aim is to go public with an agreement on or around the day that BlackBerry announces its next set of financials towards the end of September.Famous last words"

"It’s simply FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG how Blackberry is priced right now compare to its peers. If I have $6.6B, you bet I would buy up all the floating shares. Wall Street keep manipulating this GEM"
Every article is hinting the patent sale and FB royalty deal this month
TSLA just had there 2 car crash they getting closer and closer to chose BB for their cars
many keep making the meme connection to GME and AMC but I don't see any correlation to BB. WSB has only so much horsepower and doesn't influence or control BB like those 2. BB seems to be trading more on its business restructuring and hopes of highly scalable revenues for the next few years as IoT and cybersecurity revenues take off
Should (when) the cybersecurity division prove its growing plus the IoT progress plus patent sale its difficult to see BB below $20billion Market Cap which is 2.5 timed current values. Analysts have to wait on the quarterly report and evidence cybersecurity is growing...not to mention the patent sale impact.
Let's go higher and higher.
Breakout pending!
"BlackBerry patent sale could be announced as soon as next monthNine months after IAM first broke the story of a potential sale of BlackBerry’s patent portfolio, the deal to get it done may now be entering the endgame"
I don’t think $60 MC is too much for BB if their security & IVY grows relatively in 2 years. This is a $100 price tag. Stay tuned !
