@ Blackberry where is the news … you said soon.
9 more patents this morning. https://www.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/pf446a/new_patents_interesting_systems_and_methods_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&utm_term=link

"for the last 8 month JC telling us he negotiate to sell BB patent package an yet nothing yet , on the other hand he purchase Cylance within less than 60 days of discussion paying $1.4 B what seems to be one of the worth MA ever , go figure who JC is working for , we need answers on FB and patent sell"
"My post disappeared, I can’t seem to repeat the same thing…. I asked all of you who say this flaw issue is a bad thing for BB…. Why BB price has gone up, why it’s not down big? I tried to repeat this again, but let’s see if it sticks this time…. This is an old version of QNX and any old version of any software of any company has a vulnerability, so the old version/outdated software may not be able to withstand a cyber-attack and the possibility of system failure increases. But here we have the old version of QNX and there are no breaches and system failure, so no customers have been impacted. For me, this shows that BB is safe and secure even with the old version, not to mention the new one"
"Didnt sell at 5 and didnt sell at 35, not even close to where we need to be for me to even start to think about taking some gains!"
My expectation is 30.
earnings in 22 days! 87% sure patent deal will be announced.
"It’s simply FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG how Blackberry is priced right now compare to its peers. If I have $6.6B, you bet I would buy up all the floating shares. Wall Street keep manipulating this GEM"
Everyone say bye to single digits
Everyone can expect BB to be a 100$ stock by 2023… likely more. It is executing exactly as planned. Certicom is using quantum computers and we will soon use this encryption for digital blockchain ledges go see our patent details.
"CRWD continuing its path with another +2% to all time high $ 65B with no stop while BB as usual struggling to maintain its lousy $6.B , why i am not surprise"
"Folks, do not buy weekly calls. Did you know there are posts on WSB (like gains posts) and other places that are designed to create fomo and make you yolo into weeklies. Shorts are smart that way. When you do that they can easily short more which flips the option gamma to work in their favor. It works as a multiplier on price."
"Don't you love owning a stock before Analysts are forced to upgrade? BB is in that position. Several analysts still have reduce or sell yet BB is making progress in both IoT and Cybersecurity software...direct statement to Analyst from execs. Patent sale deal and security software short term positives in my opinion. good look, make your own assessments."
"It is weekend and No BB trading for two days! We have been “stay tuned” for months now. Frustrating that no announcements for patents deal! Chen said the deal was in definite agreement month ago. Chen should have told investors how long it takes to complete the deal instead “stay tuned”.. no others news can move BB up including top picked for cyber securities. Maybe Chen is saving the news as Christmas presents to investors! For me, I want the news about patents deal Now!! Not @ Christmas Time!!!How about you?"

Way past March 31 John Chen announced PATENT DEAL PENDING....SHORTLY.
"Happy to see a strong day, but let's hold off on the ""squeeze"" or ""news pending"" nonsense as pretty much anything that has been destroyed in the last 3 months caught a bid today. Certainly doesn't appear to be BB specific."
I wonder if the multi billion patent sale might be announced in the AH market today??
"Patent sale and FB settlement has been completed and is in the numbers. Sadly, only covered managements dry cleaning last month. It's not material. Only sales growth matters."
Big movement this week :)

"Something cooking big. Wish they would just release the news so this stock will GAP up once and for all, and leave behind the flakes……… Still waiting patiently"
wasn't this supposed to drop to 8 bucks a share a few months ago? Asking for a friend.
Most Motley analyst and all the Canadian bank analyst have this as sell or Best Buy price they’ve been quoted at is between $10 & 13 depending on how the wind blows. All a scam to get ppl to wait to buy lower or sell when all the while they are accumulating for their customers.

"In June BB hit $24Cad, we all know it dropped after but what is important here, the lowest was $12Cad and for more than a month it traded in the range $12-13, so $12Cad was the bottom. Last week it started moving up and now we are sitting at $14.38, this tells me that a reversal may be happening here and BB is slowly moving higher…"

Early morning shake off...will rise no doubt.
BB is a 10-bagger stock. Has the potential to go up 10 times over time.
"A month ago, I posted that Blackberry will start moving higher this fall, we are close enough to fall and it may be that it has already started, and here is why. You've all heard of “Buy the Rumors.” I will not add the second part of ""sell the news"" and you will understand why when you read this to the end.There are now almost everyday rumors about the possibility that the sale of patents will be announced next month (September), so investors may start piling in and the price will start to rise. There will still be pullbacks, Blackberry will still continue to be volatile, but not so much downside from here. On the day of the announcement of the patent sale, depending on how favorable it would be for BB, the SP can go very high. Of course, we all know that the pullback will happen, whenever the price rises quickly, there is always a pullback, but here it would be only for a short time and it may not be a big pullback because the IVY demo should be released in October this year. The IVY launch will take place in February 2022, just a few months after October. I would say that 2022 will be the year of Blackberry. This is just my opinion, but I may be wrong, but in any case $ 12Cad may be the history you had the opportunity to see last time last week. Blackberry is moving higher and with every pullback, it forms a new higher bottom. That's my reason why I didn't want to add the second part of ""sell the news"" because there may not be that much ""selling news"" here. In my opinion, there is a greater potential for upside than risk for downside."

"At a 510 Billion Dollar Market Cap, BB shares would be 1,000 dollars. iot by 2023 is excepted to be a 1.4 trillion dollar market. this isn't impossible. 1,000 shares would be worth 1 million."

"Shorty, you do realize the chessboard has changed, right? The float is locked down and there are significantly less shares to use to cover... Bear trap, but it goes even further...

This is Wall Street. Once they know they cannot push us little guys out, this GEM will start trading at the RIGHT value. Don’t listen to the traders and option players on this Board. Together we correct the valuation and together we build wealth!!!!!!!"

Just read about flaws in the QNX system shortly after seeing issues on the news taking about Tesla's flaws in their self driving technology. I swear everything is being manipulated for financial gain.

"HA, trying to manipulate a stock price by flooding articles claiming a flaw with QNX? A version of OS that is dated before 2012! Which are on vehicles where connectivity to the net is not even a thing? Should sue these people with misleading articles."
"Coiled spring. We know this stock is manipulated (by retail AND institutions, each taking turns). Just hold strong. The price today DOES NOT reflect the value."
Complete manipulation and this is being shorted...dropped from 14.76 and now below 13.50...no true value for this stock despite all the positive news...
They are leaving it alone….. nobody selling=no shares to work with. Happy Monday Longs! Great job!
"70 million cars are produced annually. 23 of 25 EV OEMs choose Blackberry QNX…… so please tell me again….. why I should buy CRWD. Those peeps have made their money. Welcome to the future, not the past"
"MMs having a tough time keeping this under 11 USD today...(Friday options expiry). ""Come Monday it'll be alright, come Monday I'll be holding tight"" "
Goodmorning BB investors. Just a reminder BB is up 52% YTD and 113% in the last year. This stock definitely has the potential to be up another 52% in the next 6 months. Buy now and hold for the ride!!
Very few selling. If they want to push this down by 4 o’clock they are going to have to short it heavy to accomplish that. Holders are holding tight. They know what they own. That’s why volume has been low. So if they short it…… guess what comes next week? Come to Papa! LOL
Not even a million shares traded and it’s up 3 percent. LOL no one is selling………….
Well at least we’re not part of the meme anymore￼ Definitely not following as of right now
Announcement coming soon
"I'm long in this thing, but where do posters get that this will be 20/30 by Monday etc, the only run BB had was when it got lumped in with the meme stocks, I just don't see what will push this higher, to much short interest isn't helpful"
"Was in the red day today, but compared to previous times, the volume today was actually larger than yesterday. Thursday, friday will be interesting.Previous day pumps were followed by red days but with smaller diminishing volumes. Today was the opposite, increasing larger volume. And compared to last few times, volumes been double (20+ millions, vs the typical 10+)"
The piper will be paid in due time! Enjoy the roller coaster and go long! Longs will win! A quick swing trade might shock you one day if you think you can buy back when we release a Press release that will send this up 30-50% in a pre market

The combined EPP and EDR solution was able to provide complete prevention, complete detection, and zero false positive results, earning SE Lab's maximum AAA rating for its excellent performance."
Breakout pending!
"also, on top of all this amazing news. 33 million shares are short. once this goes up with WSB...which is now, those shorts will have to cover."
Boy oh boy… imagine not owning shares before this multi billion dollar patent sale! It’s half the marketcap… expect this to go up 50-100% in one day very soon!
Patent sale is very close to being released. Half the market cap is what we are looking at.
News incoming
"Is today the day? The ""program"" has been in effect for quite some time now, is this the culmination point?Let's get some news. I have a lot of shares under $10, let's move up!!!"
The world now knows this stock will be worth $100+ by February 2022 and $60 by October
Settlement announced tomorrow 9AM.
She's ready to erupt!
While everything turned red. I’m glad that BB still holding today
Hold the line and set sells high this is going up!!!
"Tie-up between QNX and Great Wall through NoboGoing from memory, Great Wall sold roughly 800K vehicles in 2020, but they're on track to sell 1.2 to 1.3m this year. Their worldwide sales in Q1 totaled roughly 330K.Better yet, they're hoping to reach 4m in sales by 2025, with 3.2m of that amount being EVs. https://www.electrive.com/2021/07/02/great-wall-motor-plans-to-sell-3-2-million-evs-in-2025/Meanwhile, American politicians and the Big 3 OEMs in the USA are doing their damndest to slow down Tesla. They're trying to cut Tesla out of the new incentive program and orchestrating several investigations into Tesla's claims about autonomous driving, etc.But here's the odd angle: Tesla produces cars with the most American content -- by far. It's also (though you can disagree with this point as you wish) the clear leader in just about every category of the EV + AV movement: battery efficiency, integrated supply chain, manufacturing tech, HVAC systems, miles/kwh, dedicated computer chip, full autonomy, charging network.Who's in second place? Some might argue Volkswagen, or even Volvo-Geely (a Swedish-Chinese combo, with Chinese ownership). Others might point to a handful of start-ups that still haven't produced their first vehicles (Rivian, Lucid, etc.). Most obviously though there are 6 or 7 Chinese companies who are going Full Electron Ahead into the battle with Tesla.The good news is that BB-QNX is in tight with every one of these Chinese companies.The sad news is that the Big 3 in Detroit seem to be falling behind. Honestly, they still don't seem to realize exactly what they have to do to stay in touch.FYI, here's the great Sandy Munro on these topics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hcB1Z6-A7Q"

"10% pop Tuesday, followed by 6% (initially) on Wednesday Am - > loss of all of today's gains within an hour; was a great opportunity to sell upside calls; if this thing hits my $17 price next week (highly unlikely) I will be relieved to unload 5000 shares after 7 years of holding the bag; cannot wait and focus on 2x / 3x annual price spikes for this one holding and hope I will be focusing on when it will hit a high sales price for the 5 - 10"" that it lasts, easier to sell options against it - far greater profits doing that for years than holding and doing nothing; if it does hit the $30, $50, whatever the cheerleaders & optimists are hoping for in coming years, more power to you...."
"It is interesting how many jump in and out of liking BB stock. For what it’s worth here is my take…JC has been at this a long time. It is understandable that many, including myself, at times get frustrated with the lack of results. Here is why I continue to believe in this long play while taking advantage of a few trades along the way!1. Within the last year the amount of new partnerships has been great!!’ Sooner than later these yield revenue.2. The patent sale negotiations and that potential boost in cash.3. The FB settlement shows those patents had true value. This settlement is a boost in cash as well. 4. The 2000 patents approved last year! Fair to say BB is forward thinking!5. The markets they are in and what those markets look like over the next 10 years. EV, IOT, and Cybersecurity.Growth, growth and growth!!6. The current market cap in comparison to CWRD, S, SNOW7. The fact that they already have a huge foundation in government and banks!The list goes on and on. There are several true longs on this board, and I hope a few more do some DD and join us.GLTA"
I guess that nobody is going to say we’re with GMC right now . Stay tuned !
"BB intrinsic value is at $16 anyways. It will go to $16 without any news. Adding on its patent deal potential and future revenue boom, BB should be priced at $18-20 in Q4 2021. When revenue starts to come, BB share price will burst up towards $30 if there is decent growth. If the revenue growth is more than 20% for 2 quarters consecutively in 2022, then BB is easily $60-80 by end of 2022."
Good News this week
"Their second quarter comes at the end of August. Unless there is news re: the patent sale or earnings have increased substantially, the SP is likely to head lower. With short interest waning, this is no longer that much of a meme stock. BB now needs to climb on their own merit. With cyber security being such a huge issue, let’s hope they can capitalize on their strengths along with QNX and IVY."
I believe Watsa and Chen friends and families + attorneys and CPA offices all loaded with BB shares and call options.They KNOW the BB DAM IS ABOUT TO OVERFLOW WITH PROFIT.
"Heavy support lines… we good, wait for the bounce"

"My understanding is that the new facility that manufactures H6S has a production capacity of 80,000 vehicles. Nobody knows exactly, but I got a pretty good idea what the QNX install is worth per car, and also the Hypervisor. One thing I’m convinced of… this is not small potatoes.."

I have been selling weekly call options against my BB for six months for great income. It finally was called away yesterday (I received $11.65 with the premium). Hopefully I will get a favorable re-entry this week. This thing can run much higher and I'd hate to miss a big run!
"The stock drops 10 cents and all the know it all bears come out patting themselves on the back. I invested in Blackberry, not in August 25th. You’re welcome."
How is it that Crowdstrike has higher Quarterly Revenue than BB ?? BB has to do something about sales already with all of the additional products and services I just don't get it.

Chart A or chart B…50/50.forget day trading short term. Forward thinking the answer could go either way if your bank account as a retail investor is 800$ and compared to a retail investor/someone that has 100 thousand to a hedge fund in the millions your risk tolerance is different people always learn from experience. Deterministic relationship is very different from realistic relationship. When you look at fin track and see major institutions buying millions of shares what do you think they are doing?I’ll leave you all the warnings… math is very powerful in finance but realize what’s going on
Some really big news in the making
"BlackBerry patent sale could be announced as soon as next monthNine months after IAM first broke the story of a potential sale of BlackBerry’s patent portfolio, the deal to get it done may now be entering the endgame"
"So happy to accumulate under 10usd turned into pleased to buy under 11usd. accumulated more today. looking to October Ivy rollout, Cybersecurity growth, and more QNX deals like w NOBO yesterday."
BB should be $50 by Now
Blackberry used with Nobo Tech!Get ready for an exciting ride in the morning. Nobo is a big deal and when the Chinese money starts getting thrown into BB.... whale feeding frenzy!!!
buy buy buy
For those viewing now is your chance...Hurry Hurry.
The future is bright for BB. By end of next year it will be $50
"people, many of you act ""dissappointed"" and emotional. acting on emotion can be your worst enemy. BB in my professional opinion is an aggressive speculative investment with large upside potential but yet to really prove itself on the growth side in the restructured business. Chen has admitted as much. WSB pumpers come in and out, I don't see this as a meme stock really though, do you? a few analyst have upgraded the past few weeks, there's reason to believe BB may finally be growing it's Cybersecurity revenues and building synergy with the IoT division, where growth is real but not huge yet."
Word on the street is the US Defence department is going to give $BB the cyber security contract because of Andy Jassy from AWS (Amazon)
I like the stock.

"If you been holding just look at the price when it always went below 10, it has strong support around 9.50 I seems like it can’t break it further down and if you check the past 3 times it drop below and touch the 9s it went up to mid-high tens the next trading days. It just hasn’t happen today because the market was deeply in the red zone just look how the price is fighting to go back to green on a very red day. Ps Hold on and don’t paper hand this, remember they have a product in the ev field that will be rolling out next year start strong and good luck."
Brewing. Patient.

The time to make the money is here. Big rise! Get in now!

many keep making the meme connection to GME and AMC but I don't see any correlation to BB. WSB has only so much horsepower and doesn't influence or control BB like those 2. BB seems to be trading more on its business restructuring and hopes of highly scalable revenues for the next few years as IoT and cybersecurity revenues take off
BB looking good. Keep buying. Heading higher. Some panicked shorts will help out making a run to $12 bucks soon.
"Interesting day on BB. Big move in morning from about 14 all the way to 14:50 in like 5 minutes, then drop to mid 14:30’s all day except around 3:15/3:30 a big drop on near zero volume, then back to 14:30’S. Somebody is teasing & fishing."

The price is currently stable, it is trading in the range of $12-13 Cad for a month and we might say that this is the bottom. Many here may also be disappointed with the revenue, but let's look at this from a positive side as well. Blackberry is going in the right direction and is well on its way to becoming number 1 for connected vehicles, and we all know that this is the future, so I’m not worried because revenue will grow and just one sign of revenue growth will push the stock price high…. Let's not forget cybersecurity and EVs.... The growing need for cyber security will increase BB's revenue... The growing electric vehicle market will increase BB's revenue...Lastly, you can just refer to my list that I like to post often (just as a reminder): Quick Facts about Blackberry:-Over 500M endpoints connected and protected-Over 195M vehicles connected and protected-Design wins with 23 of top 25 global EV automakers, representing 68% of EV production volumes-All 7 of the G7 governments-18 of the G20 governments-9 of the 10 Top Global Banks-45 of the Fortune 100-Operations in 30 countries-18 major development centres in 7 countries-Received NSA approval-Recent deals with Amazon, Baidu, Desay, Scania, Volvo, Xpeng, etc.-Blackberry owns approximately 38,000 patents-Over 165 million malware based cyberattack prevented in FY21-Blackberry IVY named a market leader in automotive and smart cities by Frost & SullivanThe list doesn’t end here, so the stock price cannot be held down for too long…."

"BlackBerry’s Price Surge Hints at Good News on the Horizon“The strong trading volume on Aug. 23 and today came even as meme traders remained fairly weak on the stock; BlackBerry’s time in the Reddit sun has already come and gone. Instead, the increase was likely carried out by institutional investors who obtained some little-known information about the company.I believe these investors learned BlackBerry will soon close the sale of its patents at a higher price than most expect. Alternatively, it may be set to benefit from provisions in one of the two major bills being considered by Congress.I’ve previously written that I think the Canadian company is going to sell a high number of its patents to Facebook (NYSE:FB) for more than most on the Street expect. Based on statements made by BlackBerry CEO John Chen, I had previously expected the transaction to close by July 31.That obviously did not happen. But now, assuming Facebook wants as little publicity as possible for the deal, I expect it to be announced sometime shortly before or after Labor Day (I also wouldn’t be shocked if the transaction is divulged on Labor Day itself.)”https://investorplace.com/2021/08/bb-stock-price-surge-hints-at-good-news-on-the-horizon/"
Bought another 21k share today.. totaling 171K share.. My time frame is 3-10 year ..
"This will climb today, you've been warned!"
"With Crowdstrike CRWD now approaching a $60 Billion market cap, the contrarian investor would think BB seems relatively cheap in comparison with its market cap sub $6 Billion (which is 1/10th that of CRWD currently)."
$13 ish THIS WEEKNext week
The H6 Haval SUV brand is the top selling SUV in all of China the past 4 years. BB landing this deal via Nobo for the H6S is a big deal in my opinion...not pumping here but this looks very positive to me.

I don’t think $60 MC is too much for BB if their security & IVY grows relatively in 2 years. This is a $100 price tag. Stay tuned !
Rock and roll
After this week im going on a very nice vacation!
"Still accumulating under 10usd for longer term investment shares. have a strategy and discipline. I consider BB speculative and agggressive and place it in that investment bucket. I believe their position in Cyber security and IoT is promising because AI and automation is the future but keeping your EV or train or anything connected to the internet is massively risky. I support Chen's restructure focus and am impressed with how he's positioned BB. The fundamentals in the Cyber security division have held BB down but I'm personally convinced they're going in a positive direction and we'll see revenue growth and synergy soon. buy low sell high. you could argue I'm early here and should wait on the quarterly report. not my style....i do my own analysis of the analyst reports, look at what they may be missing with a goal of being in or long before analyst upgrades. good luck. just know your risk tolerance, know your investment, and stick to your convictions based on facts not fear or emotions."

"0508kawi3 hr. agoAdditional comment actionsHere is content of article ...BlackBerry patent sale could be announced as soon as next monthNine months after IAM first broke the story of a potential sale of BlackBerry’s patent portfolio, the deal to get it done may now be entering the endgameIt’s almost exactly five months since BlackBerry confirmed in a press release about its Q4 and full year 2021 financials that the company was looking to sell a large section of its patent portfolio:During the quarter BlackBerry entered into an exclusive negotiation with a North American entity for the potential sale of part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking. The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.This came four months after IAM had broken the news that such a sale was being considered by the Canadian telecoms business.Since that March announcement, though, and the contents of a 10K release, there has been very little public or, indeed, private comment on the state of play in how the transaction negotiations are panning out.So, while it was known that the possible deal was with a North American entity and involved that part of BlackBerry’s 38,000-strong portfolio of patents “relating primarily to non-core or legacy mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking technologies”, there was no mention of a price, the stage the negotiations had reached or the identity of the possible buyer.Inevitably, rumour finds its way into such a knowledge vacuum. Over recent months, IAM has heard all manner of things, including, most often of all, that the deal is going nowhere because the parties are so far apart on pricing; or, alternatively, that a deal is imminent and involves a single, big, Silicon Valley tech player, possibly Facebook.Our understanding, though, is that neither of these – or the many other stories doing the rounds – are correct. Instead, although parties close to the negotiations are staying tight-lipped, we believe that things are reaching a conclusion, to the extent that an agreement could be announced around the time BlackBerry releases its FY 2022 Q2 financials towards the end of September.The pricing has been more or less agreed, and the numbers are material. Meanwhile, the buyer is actually a group of entities that have been negotiating without an intermediary. That has created a level of complexity around the deal structure which explains why it is taking so long to finalise.However, while there may be an announcement in the last week of next month, closure will take longer as the deal is going to require clearance from regulatory authorities in at least two countries: Canada and the US. If everything goes well, though, the sale will be signed, sealed and delivered by the end of this year.Note – the above is not definitive, it could be wrong in places. However, what IAM is confident in saying is that the deal is progressing, pricing is not an issue, the potential buyer is not a single company and the aim is to go public with an agreement on or around the day that BlackBerry announces its next set of financials towards the end of September.Famous last words"
$BB is the best deal on the stock market right now!
"All cyber security stocks are up today again,except BB, goes to show you its a manipulated market and its Canadian."

What impact will the partnership with Stellar Cyber have on revenue and income for Blackberry? Also could this partnership lead to another major acquisition into AI security?
STRONG CLOSE!

"WATERLOO, ONTARIO, Aug. 24, 2021 /CNW/ -- BlackBerry Limited (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today announced the results from SE Labs' Breach Response test on BlackBerry Protect and BlackBerry Optics, its AI-driven endpoint protection (EPP) and endpoint detection and response (EDR) products. The combined EPP and EDR solution was able to provide complete prevention, complete detection, and zero false positive results, earning SE Lab's maximum AAA rating for its excellent performance."
I see a lot of call options in the money tomorrow.

"This is an interesting part of the press release:Armed with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8155 processor and the highly reliable BlackBerry QNX Neutrino RTOS and QNX Hypervisor, the new Haval H6S allows for scalability and flexibility in its DCC design. The ability to consolidate multiple systems with mixed criticality and different operating environments onto a single hardware platform, effectively reduces both the model's initial development and long-term costs of ownership, while still ensuring industry-leading safety and security.QCOMBBReducing long-term cost of ownership"
I work for a massive government owned tech division. I can assure you that in less than 2 years BB is sitting in triple digits. New government contracts and the most innovative software coming out shortly.
big green week
That's a mighty fine looking chart since August 19.
I realize we really do not know what is going on until its announced but I have two questions. Is the patent deal a flat out sale so here are the patents and here is your x dollars? Or is it a sale and a revenue stream? I would think it would be a revenue stream or royalties.
TSLA just had there 2 car crash they getting closer and closer to chose BB for their cars
Are you ready
MM's don't want to allow BB to cross $11 because of the options market....if it crosses $11 then on Monday they'll have to buy a ton of shares....watch the battle in the last hr. on whether the MM's will prevent BB to cross $11.
Hold the line….

Blackberry simply need to announce one BIG contract to change the perception of what Blackberry as a company is. It will come soon. Be an investor and STOP trading. It a no brainer stock keep sliding because of you flakes and paper hands.

Should (when) the cybersecurity division prove its growing plus the IoT progress plus patent sale its difficult to see BB below $20billion Market Cap which is 2.5 timed current values. Analysts have to wait on the quarterly report and evidence cybersecurity is growing...not to mention the patent sale impact.
I think the most exciting thing is how $BB is climbing like.......dare I day.......a normal stock? Little pullbacks and buy ups on its run up is a big sign of momentum building. Enjoy the cruise ship to the moon everyone. Who needs bumpy rockets when you can just sail.
Buy Out Coming! I Wonder?
"Google ""apple, blackberry, kanata"" - they could not lure all key developers over, and patents... that is what is going to happen in the next month, the Apple Car OS development team is literally across the parking lot from the QNX/ Blackberry team....
