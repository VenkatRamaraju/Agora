"They missed their numbers, and guidance was very uncertain. And yet the stock is up. It makes no sense."

Terrific buying opportunity on the way down folks.. Have watched this movie over and over. All ends well.....
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on What*sapp>>>>>>> +447901191306 or Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"
This is hilarious!! I bet they spent all the share repurchase money in the $440 range. lol
DECK seems to touch the local bottom and ready to come back to 400th level. The quarter news is due within the next two weeks. The firm has surprised many times and historically it is expected to show another surprise.
a lot of their shoes are made in vietnam. which is having virus problems right now. production might run low for a while but will probably restore in the near future.
I think we are at the high end of our trading range for now. My dreams of $750 have been seriously deminished.
"Who wants to bet that these imbicyles are out of money to repurchase shares now that the COO unloaded at the top. Doesn't matter, nobody ever goes to jail or gets fired anymore."
"I'm at a HS track meet, 900 kids. I only seen 1 wearing Hoka and I was looking."
Getting really close to the $200's. Good thing management bailed during the Share repurchase process. Another billion dollar mistake. Nobody gets fired or goes to jail. It's all good...
"As we sink back into the $300's, it looks like Hoka brand is finally running out of steam. Hope UGG stays popular or $100 could happen."
Who leaked earnings??
One earnings miss is not a big deal especially when the main reason for that miss is the current problems with logistics (which is transitory) and not with the inventory or demand. Share price fell instantly -9% on after-market but rather quickly stabilized and as I'm writing this it's up +1.3%It's overall a really great and well managed company. The management seems to be really on point and have a clear vision of today and the future. (buy Hoka everyone!!)
At what time does management comment on this collapse in share price?
Will Deck face headwinds due to supply issues? Chart looks like Nike.. Hmm
"So far this week we are down $38, $6, $11 And $12 on no real news. Let's see what Friday brings."
The chart on Yahoo is not large enough to show the collapse of DECK.
"Down over $105 in the last couple weeks. CEO quit, COO bailed. They got theirs now give the shareholders the bad news that sends this stock to $100."
