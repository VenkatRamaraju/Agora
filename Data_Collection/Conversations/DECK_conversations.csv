"$750 million allocated for stock repurchase. Joe, I know you'll like that!"
"John: Would you like a project to help Deckers? If so, contact Amazon and complain that their list of bestselling women's shoes no longer is counting UGG women's Classic II boots. In their language, the best-seller filter is no longer counting this item. Until about a week ago this item was always one of the top three or four shoes. But then they stopped counting it and it disappeared. I complained about it, but they failed to fix it. (I did the same at Zappos when this happened more than a month ago, and they fixed it.)"
"Wow, AMZN is really looking nice, up more than 12% right now. It would have been the better play, but I just didn't see it as looking that favorable. Oh well, nobody is perfeKt. :-)"
Yahoo had them releasing their earnings tomorrow for the last 2 weeks. The earnings are not being released until next month.
I was in an UGGS store near the World Trade Center last week and the stuff was flying off the shelves. i have never seen so many people buying so much stuff. I bought some slippers myself. But I did not see anyone walk out empty handed. The store on Madison Avenue is always crowded. That's the way I do market research and it always works. Just watch what people are buying.
"All you have to do is look at the max chart to see the future of DECK stock. 100% of the time, in almost the exact same fashion this stock loses 80% of its value. It has never not happened. This is an easy one to sell.."
"This stock has $110 swings. The company has hundreds of millions in cash and very little debt, if any. No share repurchase program and no dividend?? What's going on here? What are they gonna do with all this cash and profits? Where are the activist groups?"
$353 close today.
DECK reached a new 52 Week High at 94.86
it will close at $353 tomorrow. This is so manipulated. Hind sight you can see exactly what they did if you follow the options. It's so wrong but I like it!!
"Like I say, the earnings we're built into this stock a couple months ago. It all depends on the Outlook and guidance. This is more important then the numbers they announce no matter how good they are. $30 up or down. Your guess is as good as anyone's."
"If DECK misses, look for a $25-$30 down day tomorrow. I'm not predicting this but I have seen this story many times before. Good luck.."
Management stopped the share repurchase plan when the stock fell to $90 and resumed the plan at $420. Nobody got fired??
DECK is down -5.06% to 92.57
DECK reached an all time high at 197.49
I think they guided lower because they do not want to spend $180 per share when they repurchase shares. They should have repurchased these shares in the $120-$140 range. Look for big volume tomorrow and that $11 point up day like I was talking about.
Insiders sell all the time? The Marcado Group sold at $90. What is your point?? There are only 27 million shares out there? This stock could go to $750 quicker then you think. If sales keep growing this does not stop. look for a split or a spin-off.
have you heard of crocs? ugg sounds familiar.
"P. S.

I only discovered this fairly recently, and now am able to keep track of the messages far more effectively. But maybe everyone already knows this....."
Time to spend some of that 350 million on shares before earnings are announced.
"Party is coming to a close...If you have a profit, now would be a good time to take some off the table before earnings."
Great news does not catipult this stock. Absolutely no reason for this stock to be stuck here. $200 after this beat tomorrow or head for the hills to a dividend paying stock.
I'm sticking with my $220 price by the end of the year. May have to raise it with the blowout guidance..$240??
time to take some profits...
"With 29 million outstanding shares and sizable buybacks, this company and its stocks are not going anywhere but up for the time being. Hoka is getting huge, I read they are the fastest growing name in athletic shoes out there. Growth for Hokas is tremendous."
watering down the UGG name with the BB&b presence and Koolaburra. Need to concentrate on the $300 classics...
$40 hit seems very unreasonable. All the shares that have been repurchased have been repurchased at much higher stock prices. This is why I prefer a dividend rather then the buybacks. This stock can go much lower.
Now we just have to figure out a price to go private. I believe the bidding starts at $105 per share and I believe this happens pretty quick. This company has a very bright future and whoever buys the company is getting it for a steal no matter what they pay for it.
"If we do not see new all time highs by the end of the week, $131 next week gets tested."
DECK is up 8.71% to 94.86
"As everyone seems to be jumping on the Hoka bandwagon. I still say the Teva story is just as good. Winter orders will start to roll in next Quarter. If UGG has a better YOY summer, $220 by October."
"If the board votes to resume the share repurchase program which they paused while the stock traded in the $80's and they want to resume it now while we trade above $300, I think a shareholder lawsuit would be successful and in order. Remember, this stock pays no dividend and has a ton of cash sitting on the sidelines doing nothing except satisfying bonuses and raises for the people making these decisions."
"Does anyone know why $0 went into the $350 million buy back last Q? Do management bonuses have anything to do with cash on hand? I am getting in touch with a lawyer to look into this matter. I'm not sure when a company says they have a share repurchase plan, does it really have to exist. Can a company's management lie to it's shareholders to manipulate the stock? is this legal?"
"The after-hours trades that have lowered the price have been tiny trades of 250 shares or less. Two of them were for one share each. Some trades, also involving small numbers of shares, have have had prices over three points above the close. I would add that the conference call went very well. I will be surprised if the stock price does not rise tomorrow (if not later this evening)."
Looks like George lost $17 today shorting DECK..
"Here is a little advice. If we can hold 23500 on the Dow, we will be in record territory by the end of the year. If we can not hold 23500, we will head straight to 18000. I think we will know where we stand real quick."
"If UGG sells it's Hoka Brand, I'm guessing that would put the stock at $460-$510 a share. If they do not sell the Hoka Brand DECK will be trading over $500 a share in less then 2 years."
I am looking for nothing less then an $11 pop after they report.
How come nobody got fired for not fulfilling the share repurchase agreement when the stock hit $84? Now they want to resume the repurchase plan while the stock is $350? What would one have to do to get fired if this is not a reason?
UGG is #14 on Zappos top 25. Not bad but it is not #1..
"I'll listen to any ""guidance"" that knows how long this will last, and how bad the impact will be on earnings. Might be longer than we think before people rush out to buy a new pair of shoes. For the moment, they ain't wearing out the ones they got."
"These shoes are in such High demand, full price is what they sell for. Only 25 million outstanding shares and shrinking is what will catipult this stock to $300 this year. If demand stays the same and the share repurchase plan stays active, this has no ceiling.."
Marcato is dumping 2.4 million shares on the open market. This is what happens when a big player bails. When the shares are digested we will get at least 50% back of what we lost today and then climb our way back to new highs. This is Marcatos way of saying spiting on the floor on the way out.
Don't blink $140 right around the corner..
"I think the truth about DECK is being exposed, hence the $6 down day..."
"Okay, up another $10 today so my $30 pop has occurred. Tomorrow may only see $5-$7 gain but still gonna push $260 by year end."
"Good stocks don't collapse like this. Risky, not worth the reward at this price."
Christmas orders should be coming in now. BIG days are coming very soon.
"Income/revenue will be way down year over year next quarter. Now would be the time to exit this stock and not at $80. After they announce the big miss at the next earnings release, the stock will get destroyed."
Stock going up now in anticipation of a beat. This is why you don't want to do these Pure Earnings plays at the last minute. I always try to get in by 3:30 at the very latest...
"So they issue guidance that's weak, and the stock is up in after hours. ALGN and IRBT issued weak guidance earlier this week, and their stocks were each hammered about 30%. This is why I never make a trade based on an earnings release anymore."
high of 27° on Wednesday! May be a 2 pair winter after all...
DECK reached a new 52 Week High at 85.07
They had some interesting insights about DECK on (http://Multistockalerts.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Going into the christmas season, this company over the next 24 months from this point shoud do nearly 4B in revenue and make more than 200M in net income along with 100-150M in cash. Stock is on the move to price in this years most likely much better than expected results along with future earnings. 2.08B valuation for a company that will have nearly 800M in working capital over the next 24 months, not going to cut it."
"This earnings release is scheduled for 4:05 ET, and the Conference Call begins at 4:30 ET. This means there will be a lot of traders still around and we should see fairly active trading during the 4:00-5:00 PM hour which should give us a fairly good indication of how the market views the numbers. Assuming the numbers are all very good, including Guidance, I will not be looking to sell here in the AH session, for any price under $195. But that's just me, taking good profit when you have it is always a smart thing to do, IMO."
"This is a very good ER and the stock has reacted favorably here in the AH session, but it could have been better. If you parse the numbers carefully, you can see a few concerning points on Guidance:Deckers Outdoor beats by $0.57, beats on revs; guides Q4 EPS below consensus, revs below consensus4:09 PM ET 1/30/20 | Briefing.com""Reports Q3 (Dec) earnings of $7.14 per share, $0.57 better than the S&P Capital IQ Consensus of $6.57; revenues rose 7.4% year/year to $938.74 mln vs the $900.43 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus. Co issues downside guidance for Q4 (Mar), sees EPS of $0.35-0.45 vs. $0.68 S&P Capital IQ Consensus; sees Q4 revs of $392-402 mln vs. $422.96 mln S&P Capital IQ Consensus.""But, the stock is undervalued, very impressive beats on both EPS and Revenue, so it LOOKS like the weaker Guidance might not result in anything more than a slight limitation as to how high she goes. But lets not ignore the facts here, taking profit when you have it is always smart, because trader and investor reactions are subject to change, tomorrow. Just my opinion, and for the record I am still staying in. I put a lImit Sell order in at $195.00 for this AH session. Will take that profit only, if I can get it. Otherwise holding for tomorrow. :-)"
It's all about the guidance. The stock market thinks 6 months ahead. A big beat is already built into the price of this stock. I personally do not see as many UGGS on people's feet as last year or the year before.
DECK reached a new All Time High at $133.45
Thank you longs! shorted at open and just covered.Nice 4% gain. Looking to short more in the next couple days.
If UGGs for men ever catch on....And this is a good indicator: https://www.yahoo.com/news/uggs-pigs-tartan-big-trends-mens-paris-fashion-193931445.html
HOKA gonna blow by UGG. Bought this stock shortly after putting on my first pair of Hokas a couple years ago.
"With nearly 13% of shares short, you have to wonder when this relentless upward pressure triggers a short squeeze..."
I personally would like a dividend instead of the share repurchase. I would like to see a 2 for 1 split and then the buy back of $351 million. $351 million only takes a quarter million shares off the table at these prices.
"This is a solid bet. I compare the UGG business to the Levi's business. Levi's have evolved with the times, they have good years and they have great years. DECK will be a private company just like Levi is a private company pretty soon. I would love to see Levi buy DECK. The people running Levi seem to know how to make a brand like UGG work, they have already done it with their jeans. These 2 companies are very similar. I believe UGG boots would be in very good hands as a trademark of Levi. Make sense??"

results mean nothing. I have seen stocks report record results but guide lower and take a 50% haircut. Good luck!
"Good pricing action on robust volume - sings point to ""Yes"" but still a little nervous about this earnings call"
"The only problem is management. Can you trust them to do the right thing? They never did right by the shareholders, what makes you think they will start now??"
What are they gonna do with all the cash if they are not going to repurchase shares or pay a dividend?? It is time to enhance shareholder value with a spin off of the Hoka brand or take this company private.
Who has a better grasp as to what is going on? Predictions anyone? Selig? $127.60 is my guess after earnings are released.
Sanuk in Costco = sales growth. Don't listen to the analysts.
"It might be true that all the girls want the Ugg boots, but times will be much harder this Christmas and parents are not going to pay 250 for a stupid pair of boots when it's all a fad anyway. It's way overdone. Now teenagers are into something else, like handbags. Can't have everything. No company is going to buy a company that is seasonal and faddish with a PE of 440. That's just plain ol stupid thinking. The mutual funds are manipulating the prices and when they have to show their performance, they will dump the stocks and investors are left holding the Ugg bag. I made my profit when it jumped and won't look back. Now when NVDA is at 125, I will take my money and invest there. This company is lucky not to be like Under Armour, but it soon will be. If any large company is going to be buying up a retail manufacturer, under armour would be the target, at clearance sale values."
Up 7 bucks nice yu charles you are the man.
"If you notice the way that DECK stock is breaking down, it is almost exactly as it's previous 4 total meltdowns. It never ends slowly it seems to lose 80% of its value in less then 5 weeks. My guess is DECK trades at $41 by the end of February. I am going to look into what time of the year the previous total collapses occurred. I'll let you know."
down $20 in 3 days. Hope management is continuing to buy.. Should be less then 20 million outstanding if they are doing their job.
"Besides a major beat they upped guidance also. The stock should be up $10, not down $10."
"Z: My point was merely that in the YouTube you posted Shiller's comments seemed to me to be entirely platitudinous. Who does not know about value-investing, that the market is partly psychological, that all information is always priced into every stock, or that timing the market is difficult? Also, I vaguely recall that he mentioned the importance of diversification in stock buying -- still another platitude (that actually guarantees that one cannot make a large amount of money in the stock market)."
Z
"I only see a $30 run in this stock before a big pull back. The charts don't lie, what is going to stop this stock from reaching $200? Any ideas Squeeky? I hope I'm wrong, I rarely am..Squeek Squeek!!"
Deckers Outdoor reached an all time high at 216.19

"Where does one get inside information and since it seems to be legal, why doesn't everyone who invest use inside information. Is everyone supposed to be okay with it because they put Martha Stewart I jail for a month 20 years ago?"
"25 million outstanding shares and a agressive buy back program makes this a stock that does not go down any time soon. Actually, if Hoka continues, this stock doubles in less then 2 years."
Weak guidance just makes it easier to beat for next Q. This stock is gold. I want to see them reduce the outstanding shares to under 20 million then we are talking $280-$310...
"What was the reason that when the stock price collapsed to $84 this management thought it was a good time to discontinue the share repurchase agreement? Did any of the management who made this decision get fired for this decision? Did any board members resign? Was a reason given why they broke the repurchase agreement? If the shareholders who invested in DECK because of this agreement, will they be able to sue the company for gross mismanagement of company funds?"
"It's possible that they miss. If they do, $30 down day coming up."
"less then a month before earnings are announced. No snow yet in the Midwest, boot sales must be down. A earnings miss could send this stock into collapse mode."
Any earnings predictions? I am a newbie to this stock and would appreciate and information from long term holders. GLTA

Love this company long term but it's going to be a tough 6 months.
"Wonder where Sam Poser is at now. Probably getting ready to right another absurd ""analysis"" of this stock where he downgrades us to $25 - not even an exaggeration really"
Brilliant move!! Selling Sanuk in Costco stores. I bought a pair and they are simply the best flip-flops I have ever owned. Anyone else who wares flip-flops will buy these and love them. Watch for Sanuk to start start growing at a much faster pace. Sanuk is a quality brand for sure.

"It seems to me that if there is not an activist group forcing the issues with this management to do the right thing, they just won't do it.

"In at 176 even, my limit sell went for 184 in the after hours. Much love Charles. See you on the next one."
I'm guessing we have a $60 run in the near term.
I still don't understand why they abolished the share repurchasing agreement when the stock slipped into the 80s a few months back. has anybody been fired due to this action? has anybody called a lawyer yet?

"Lots of dough, no debt and only 29 million outstanding shares."
Wedbush analyst came out today with a 12 month price target of $138 for DECK. They said in their report any growth is already priced into the share price.
The closest stock to $CROX is $DECK. $DECK is a slightly bigger company then $CROX but it will most likely follow the pattern PE up to lower 20's are coming soon.
"may be time to bail 1/2 position. No dividend, no share repurchase, just bonuses and promotions for the weal management."
Working capital coming 16 months will reach 50/share. Z
Typical DECK kind of day: market goes up over 300 points and we trade marginally lower on weak volume. Standard
"I've been holding long since about $117, and I sold in after hours just now. Why? Because did anyone see their forecast? They're guiding way below the consensus numbers. If management is correct with their guidance, a global slowdown with a weak consumer is a strong possibility."
Make DECK Green Again
I LOVE my HOKAs! Most comfortable shoe I've ever had by FAR!
This is such a gift. 315 million was sitting on the sidelines this morning. I hope they spent it all. If Hoka reaches 1 billion in sales this year they can probably sell Hoka to an investment group for more then the current market cap of DECK today.
"Makes no sense to me but I would guess it is because of management, they don't have a clue. Having almost a billion dollars sitting in your mattress is not a good idea. Refusing to stick to the repurchasing agreement when the stock dips is a bad idea. If they start the buyback up again while this stock is $220 I will personally sue these guys. I'm looking for a lawyer now. Where are the activist? These guys need help!"
"If the guide lower during the conference call, the stock loses 50% even if they report blow out numbers. It's all in the guidance."
"When the 350 million is used to buy back stock, we will be sitting on 27 million outstanding shares. The price of this stock could double in a relatively short period of time if this keeps up."
after hours excitement is cooling down big time..
I think you can safely sell around here and buy back 10% lower before it goes to $168...
"if demand for UGGs is good through winter(The orders are already in and we will hear about it next earnings announcement) we have a run all the way to $220 in a real short time. These UGGs are like crack to these women who like shoes. This could be the best 5 year investment around, this is a good one."
"I'm loving my Hokas, nothing like them. Best shoe ever!"
"Joe: Have you now sold all your shares, or are you short? Just curious -- since you so often give advice. Thanks!"
"Importantly, the stock still has very good upside price potential because it is significantly undervalued. If it was significantly overvalued, I think the lowered Guidance would be viewed in a MUCH more unfavorable light and would be impacting the stock price much more. IMO."
They need a stock split. 8 for 1 or split the company up..
"wow! if business stays healthy, $400 is a good possibility.. At $400 it would not even be it's best run ever. All systems go!! may take 3 years but it's gonna happen. Check out their max chart and figure it out.."
"My guess is that the gigantic growth rate of Hoka is slowing to just real big. Nothing lasts for ever. Just hope for a good UGG season, a slowdown in both would not be good.."
Unless you have a huge or tiny foot - stock is out in every shop in my area. Good sign! The last shopkeeper I talked to said it's a big difference from last year when they had a ton after the Christmas shopping season. He was out of everything except some off sizes. All at no discount. Let's hope this is more than just regional.
"I now own a pair of UGG, Hoka and Sanuk. These are by far the highest quality foot Ware. I'm hooked, now I understand. This stock is gold! In 5 years this is a $700 stock if they keep up the buybacks. $142 is a gift...."

"Stock is up very nicely here in the AH session, but on low volume. Would be more bullish and impressive if volume were higher. I am thinking to place a Limit Sell order for the entire day, including pre-market, at $195.00 for tomorrow. Will be working manual labor all day long, so no close monitoring of the action. Am wondering, how much upside does DECK have, given lowered Guidance?? $195 would be a VERY nice price to cash out. I don't want to miss out on such a pop, if it happens at any point tomorrow, because I don't see the likelihood of this going much higher than that price tomorrow. I know, even $195 might be pushing my luck, but as usual, I am feeling just a bit greedy... :-) Best of Luck to All! :-)"
John: I don't understand why you posted Shiller's vacuous comments. Do you think he can give you good advice about how to make money in the stock market?
The trading setup for DECK looks very enticing. if you guys have questions you should ask awesome-STOCKS. They often respond to my emails which is helpful.
This billion dollars sitting around collecting dust could have been shares repurchased at $84. Who made the decision to stop the share repurchase agreement when shares were $84??
The June 2019 75 PUTS are trading at $1.75! Not a good sign of things to come.
I don't believe there were any share repurchase yet. The share count has not gone down. What are they waiting for?
I can't do anything unless I buy my calls back. I wish DECK paid a dividend or announced a 1 time special dividend of $2.
"Actually, the shares could double from here and the PE would not be that out of line. Throw in a few good earnings beats and $280 is possible."
"I can't help but think about Sam Poser today, as DECK hits a new high for the year. Sam is the DECK analyst at Susquehanna. And he has been a DECK troll for about five years. Ten days ago (October 16) he issued a ""sell"" rating on DECK, with a price target of 55. And today, true to form, he issued another negative statement about DECK -- to counter the very positive news yesterday during the earnings call. In the future, my advice is to greet Sam Poser's attacks on DECK with what they deserve: laughter."
the stock market has to absorb 1.5 million more shares of DECK. Only 1 million of Mercado shares have been absorbed so far. The selling is not over period when volume hits 2.5 million then it will be safe to put your feedback in the water.
I'm thinking of taking Kayla out for a romantic dinner tonight and do some serious celebrating. We may go to our favorite place
I called for a $30 up day when earnings were announced. The stock is up $18 the last couple days so I am lowering my prediction to only $15 up upon announcement. Only fair...
"Here is the thing with DECK Guidance: They LOWERED Guidance specifically for the next quarter. But at the same time they RAISED Guidance for the full fiscal YEAR of 2020. Is this overall bearish, or overall bullish? To my interpretation, it is clearly net Bullish and the overall market SHOULD judge these Guidance indications as positive going forward, rather than negative. I also think that is why the stock has acted so well in the AH session. :-)"
Shorted another 300 shares today $172.41. Looks likeThis thing is about to turn!
you know what happens if they report $1 loss tomorrow? DECK goes up $21 bucks instantly. Analysts Ave them losing $1.42.
"I doubt the end is near unless people stop wearing shoes. The company makes what consumers want, they evolve. To many good names to fail now. This stock is GOLD. $500 in 5 years."
"Charles, what happens when this stock goes to $250+? Why would you sell? $2300 is chump change compared to holding for a few years."
DECK is down -4.92% to 90.99
analysts = Bozo's....
"Ugh (pun intended), what a day...Just wanted to weigh in here on both sides as we experience another classic day for this DOG of a stock. Stock should be trading at $120 but instead of course it's another ""here we go again"" moment. For what it's worth, the roughly 8% we are trading down today mirrors almost exactly the % share that Marcato cashed out. They made their money and I agree with John here: Mcguire is far from a genius. Looking closely, his ""efforts"" failed spectacularly (got no one on the board and no real changes unless you count Angel leaving the board (I don't). In truth, he was lucky enough to own during a couple of sensational quarters and cashing out of their position is a perfectly logical move. We're likely to trade sideways for a while and there's nothing for an ""activist"" investor to do at this point. I will be buying the dip at some point, but I agree with Joe too - DON'T try to catch a falling knife here. I don't believe this is over yet; not with this dog..."
Nice earnings report!
DECK was $137 a month ago. it will take 3 or 4 months to trade back in the $40-$50 Range. This stuff does not happen over night.
Is it true that the BOD stopped the share repurchase plan when the stock dropped into the $85 range and then resumed it once the shares hit $370?
why in the world is this stock trading at 260 with only 27 million outstanding shares? This is a $330 stock right now.
"Another life raft tossed to the shorts from above...IF they get greedy, we're looking at some pain (buying opportunities) for a couple weeks at most, but they would be wise to find the exits here."
"#DECK Stochastic oscillator and RSI are triggering bullish signal, according to stoxline. A break of 118.16 could move it up to 138.01."
Looks like the march to $500 is on!
"If there is no buyer I see $300 in not that long of a time but there is a buyer, someone will want this company and will pay."
Deckers Outdoor (DECK) reported 3rd Quarter December 2019 earnings of $7.14 per share. The consensus earnings estimate was $6.50 per share on revenue of $898.2 million. Big beat there!
Deckers must be experiencing supply issues. I keep an eye on Hoka availability at online retailers and inventory is low. Also their Hoka apparel is overpriced and only available on their own website. Deckers has also barred online retailers from discounting any of their popular Hoka shoes. Not good for market share and the decision to do that is probably related to the aforementioned supply issues.
$144 near term....
Markets will be down again tomorrow and so will My favorite short DECK!
"You are betting against the wrong company. Only 27 million outstanding, no debt and soon to have a billion in cash. Hoka grows at 100% a year and UGG is very healthy. This stock goes to 260 in lightning speed."
DECK is down -6.61% to 111.35
Crox tumbled today Deck and gco are next.
"Stock is bid up nicely, looking good to me. Will be interesting to see how the Conference Call goes, we could very well see further upside in this AH session..."
"Like I said before, it's all in the guidance. There is going to be a 40 point move after earnings are announced. If they guide higher, the stock takes off. If they guide lower, the stock goes lower. You see these earnings we're priced in when the stock was at $137. The earnings will be real good. It all depends on the guidance..."
Had to release earnings on the worst day for stocks in 5 years. All the luck...
I don't understand....Good earning but lower AH price?
"As we sink back into the $300's, it looks like Hoka brand is finally running out of steam. Hope UGG stays popular or $100 could happen."
"As soon as the analysts raised the price target for the stock, the stock drops $50."
buyout @ $125 in 4 months..
Crox down 40% after a crazy run up. Looking for the same with Deck. Way overbought insiders and funds will be dumping soon.
"Google just released its list of the top ten most-searched Xmas gifts, and UGGs are number 2 -- behind the new iPhone. So UGGs are the most-searched apparel item. UGGs are also selling extremely well in Zappos (top online shoe retailer) and Amazon. Obviously important indicators of a hot quarter. (You can find the story in the Daily Mail, among other sources. It just came out about 8 hours ago.)"
At $84 they decided to cancel the share repurchase program that the were obliged to carry out. If they did not do this DECK would be pushing $500.
"Conference Call is starting now, hope we see lots of positive and upbeat sentiment by the company, going forward, in addition to an emphasis on the current, great ER numbers... The market is always looking ahead, we need the CC to focus on a very positive future, IMO..."
Covered my GCO and CROX short positions with a nice 12 and 15 percent gain in one month. DECK you have only fallen 2 percent since I shorted you. Waiting for another 10 percent drop.
"What would a 3% dividend do for this stock? What are they going to do with all that dough, buybacks at $200+ or a nice dividend?"
overall a pretty weak day considering the beat??
Nike has a forward PE of 35 and deck has a forward PE of 22. Nike has 1.25 billion outstanding shares deck has 27 million. this stock might never stop going up.
Your answer is in the short interest: down 22% and fleeing in droves. The extended winter weather can only help as well. Next earnings season this thing goes to $110
Deckers Outdoor reached an all time high at 260.54
whatever happened to John??
There is still 25%-30% left in this run.$168-$175 by year end.
"Selig, what is the 1 thing that DECK does after a big run up like we have had. I'll give you a hint, it happens 100% of the time."
DECK reached a new 52 Week High at 107.81
"Did any heads roll when they decided to opt out of the share repurchase agreement when the stock was $70? If not, why not??"
"This company is growth at a reasonable price, is cheap relative to its peers, has a very high return on invested capital, which I take to mean it has a competitive advantage, etc. Been a fantastic 6 years, I see the next 6 as being equally good. Especially what I love about this company is it has $1.1 billion in cash, and little to no debt, as well as growing free cash flow."
"Market going back up and deck dips under 176, just cold feet holders i hope"
"You can get $3.50 for the Jan 2020, 220 CALLS. That's $65 out of the money!! Only 7 months away! $190 seems very conservative. I would say the $220 is more like it."
"exactly as I figured. Major beat, guide higher and off to the $140 range. It is all in the Outlook my friends.."
Deck 312 up 19 wow  remember this at 77 Cramer talking about it. Sold took profit
may be time to bail again..We test $100..
So... On first glance earnings destroyed expectations more than usual. Guess the price drop was just another random walk down wall street. I look forward to recouping that 13% and then some.
I agree. there are still 1 million shares for the market to digest. This could still go lower.
The buybacks seem to kick in around $154. let's hope it stays around $154 till the 315 million is all used up. The 14 PE heading into the big cash quarters is making me very excited.
"OK, analysts say this company will lose money this Q. My guess is a total blowout report and a $21 up day tomorrow. Maybe only $16 because of the $5 rise today. I'm still expecting an announcement on what they are going to do with all their cash. Let's hope for a good announcement."
"with only 25 million outstanding shares, this stock is so undervalued. We will blow past $230 real quick and then straight to$250 by June. $320 by year end."
DECK is up 4.95% to 186.16
NICE AH
"I am currently researching DECK as a potentially very attractive Pure Earnings play for the Thursday AH/Friday PM session. Stock is scoring very well on my 24 point checklist. I am expecting an excellent earnings report, solid beats on both EPS and Revenue consensus estimates. Company has an OUTSTANDING Earnings History, they have beaten consensus on EPS and Revenue for the past 11 consecutive quarters. Growth is one of the few and minor negative points here, but a comprehensive financial analysis of the company comes up quite impressive, to my subjective judgment. Company is undervalued, has almost no debt, profitability, as measured by gross margin and operating margin, is absolutely excellent. TTM is also absolutely excellent. They appear to have very popular and currently ""hot"" shoes that are creating a genuine buzz among consumers, leading us to the likelihood of higher Guidance. They did guide higher last earnings release.Top-ranking Analysts are bullish, most have $200+ PT on this baby. Going beyond PT's, specific and recent comments by multiple analysts are extremely positive. This is from 1/24/20:""Citi upgrades Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) to a Buy rating after having the retailer slotted at Neutral.Analyst Paul Lejuez says the value of the red-hot Hoka running brand isn't fully factored into Decker's share price. He estimates a stand-alone value for Hoka of as much as $2.8B.Lejuez and team assign a Street-high price target of $230 to Deckers vs. the average sell-side PT of $189.50.""Right now, DECK is my #1 pick as next Pure Earnings play, after I close my ALXN Long play tomorrow. Would welcome any thoughts or comments on DECK, negative or positive. I see excellent upside potential and excellent risk/reward ratio on going Long on DECK as my next Pure Earnings play. Best of Luck to All! :-)"
I dare anyone to look at the max chart and tell me if you see a trend. This looks exactly like every one of the 4 collapses in the past.
"As the positive articles come out and the new higher price targets hit the press, the stock collapses. Anyone else see anything fishy about this?"
Love the end of session pop!!!!!
They always kill earnings. This quarter there's been a real disconnect between earnings reports and after hours prices. I wouldn't even pay much attention to the AH price. It will be irrelevant by next week.
"Downside is limited because of the $350 million in buy backs. The next move up will be a double digit, quick move so you don't want to miss it. You want to hold this stock. To bad it doesn't pay a dividend, could be dead money till fall."
It is still hard to believe that the Marcato group could not sell this company for $90 a share less then two years ago. They claim they shopped this company around to over 50 investment groups and they all passed. I wonder if anyone would pay $300 today?
The $12 collapse over the last week should be taken seriously. Put your stops in at $105. If it goes to $105 it is going to free fall to $70.
"Sam Poser has now raised his target on DECK to 150. Presumably he did this yesterday or today. In recent years he has been negative about DECK, but now he has completely turned around. While I am posting, I would also like to respectfully request that Selig cease cluttering up this board with his latest YouTube passions. If he does not cease this practice very soon, I will have to block his future posts. That would be unfortunate, since I appreciate his relevant commentary on DECK. But his YouTube and other irrelevant posts are intolerable. Thank you in advance for ceasing this practice, Selig."
DECK reached a new 52 Week High at 111.75
"retails are reporting bad numbers and yet DECK defies the odds? How is that even possible except manipulations by the market? this POS is way overvalued. Only a matter of time before the house of cards fall. And when it does, expect DECK to be sub $50."
"Joe, I don't think any of us small timers on this board have any idea why the stock is down a few % the last few days. Maybe a little profit taking before earnings. The good news is if you've held this stock for more than a year or so, you're up like 300%. There's no way you can expect the ride to continue like that. Sometimes stocks hit hiccups for no good reason."
"If in the next 5 years they get the share count under 20 million, your $1500 a share is not out of the question."
"Chad, it's the timing of it all that bothers me, not the 13% drop and when you say it's only down a ""few"" % when it's down 13% just cought my attention. Is seem like you don't know simple math, that's all.."
"in 2008 DECK collapsed from $55 to $15. In 2011 collapsed from $120 to $48. In 2015 collapsed $100 to $35 and now after our high of $137, a collapse to $64 would be in order. This happens 100% of the time, it actually has never not happened. The charts never lie."
"President & CEO of Deckers Outdoor Corp (30-Year Financial, Insider Trades) David Powers (insider trades) sold 11,348 shares of DECK on 01/07/2021 at an average price of $310.01 a share. The total sale was $3.5 million."
Never took out the 52 week high. We are on our way to test $131 before we head higher. Don't shoot the messenger...
"I bought 5K shares at $14 less then 8 years ago. If you want to gamble, go to Vegas and play baccarat and bet the player."
Amazing earnings and bright future! I am buying!
I still want to know why they stopped the share repurchase plan when DECK dropped into the $80's earlier this year. This move caused the shareholders dearly. Someone needs to be fired.
Expect another big selloff tomorrow. There are still 1.25 million shares for the market to digest. I would expect this to be over by the end if trading on Thursday. Friday is the day to buy.
"Long 570 shares of DECK at $176.00. This is a Pure Earnings play. Stock reports earnings in about one hour, and I am expecting an excellent report, beats on EPS and Revenue along with positive Guidance going forward, to lift the price significantly. Looking for at least $190+, and depending upon how good the numbers are, close to $200. Please note that all Pure Earnings plays are very dangerous and risky, so do your own Due Diligence and make your own trading decisions based upon your own risk tolerance. I could just as easily lose $10k on this play, as I can gain $10k. But I sure hope the latter is what actually happens! :-) Best of Luck to All!"

Need to spin off hoka/Koolaberra/Teva or split the stock and have an aggressive buyback.
It's nice to see such a quality stock with a float of only 27 million. This stock has a long way to go.
I have been investing for almost 50 years. There are very few times that I can remember when a stock did not crash after a pause like the one we just had. Stocks very rarely continue upward. A 50%-70% drop is in order. The shorts will pile on to make this epic.
The beat was priced in. 2 years $750 or higher..
I will successfully sell at $133 and buy back at $121. can't go broke making money.
"Selig, you are very short sighted. What do you think happens if they guide lower on the conference call? My guess is if they have a massive earnings beat but guide lower, the stock collapses 80% just like it does 100% of the time. I'm guessing we are headed to the $40 range. Good luck.."
"Chad, you are gonna go broke. 350 million in cash to buy some shares. Long term shareholders will be rewarded biggly. There are only 27 million outstanding shares!!"
"DECK is almost certainly down today because of the recent negative statement by Sam Poser, even as Poser continues to cover his wildly wrong price targets for the stock during the past year or two. As the stock goes up, he moves his target up, yet continues to trash the stock. He has been similarly completely wrong about Skechers (which he recommended before its big fall), Under Armour (which he has been saying would tank), and, I believe, Crocs (before its big rise). But I guess inexperienced investors listen to him and sell their DECK each time he trashes it. He has been the most negative DECK analyst for a long time, while DECK has continued to rise. Anyone who listens to his analyses deserves to lose money."
It's all about 2020 winter boots season. 2019 is in the bag and very few know the truth of the numbers. The people in the know will act accordingly and then release the earnings announcement.
"Why is DECK tumbling, day after day after day......."
"Every dip down to the 200-day has been a buying opp. It’s just above that now. Retail down on Macy’s miss. If you don’t understand anything I just said, you’re not ready for trading yet."
After this 350 mllion dollar share repurchase there will be a little over 27 million outstanding shares. This is what will catipult this stock to the $200 level.
$141 is kind of disappointing when you think about how big this beat is and where they guided. My guess is that there is a second leg to the price appreciation coming due to this massive beat. See you at $160 pretty quickly.
Nice.nice shoes.interesting deck a $150 stock 2 billion in revenue a 17 pe.teva a $11 stock 19 billion in revenue a 4 pe.
This stock is turning out to be a joke. Down $15 in 5 days and falling...
Short squeeze may be here already folks. Over 4 million shares short. That's a lot of cash in the wrong direction. Having a short position in this stock at this point is insane and there is no way it doesn't get punished
"Down 10% in the last 2 days alone?? Maybe your talking about a different stock, one that is down only a few % and accidentally posted it here?"
"Wow, think the earnings leaked?"
$10 down on earnings announcement. To much hype...
A lot has changed? Marcato is out? Marcato is the only reason this stock had it's run. The selling is not even 1/2 over. Marcato owned 2.5 million shares.
Another upgrade today and price target yet again below share price. What is going on with some of these analysts?
I'm guessing over $200 by March. Higher if they add to the share repurchase plan by several billions. Gold Jerry!!
With earnings this has been on our watchlist for potential day trades. Good luck to everyone out there. See what else is on our watchlist. https://daytrading.group/DailyWatchlist
"Want to send out a personal ""thank you"" to those shorts who recently enlarged their position. Your $ is truly appreciated"
Love it when a stock price stalls and stays the same for a month or longer. We all know where this is heading.
"Along with competitor CROX, DECK is a solid investment for the next 5 years. These two shoe companies represent growth at a reasonable price, and feature stats that are more on par with tech companies and less with their fellow shoe companies. I would have no problem parking in my money in these two names, shutting them in a drawer, then reopening the drawer in 5 years to see how much my money has multiplied. Both have had a monster past 5 years. I don’t see that trend disappearing over the next 5 either."
The board decided to stop the stock repurchase plan when the stock dropped into the $80's earlier this year. This move has cost the shareholders dearly. My guess is the stock would be trading at $400 instead of $300. The cash is on the sidelines doing nothing. Nobody has been fired and all board members are still here? Im guessing a class action law suit is probable. These guys took bonuses for making these decisions. Heads should roll or at least an explanation is in order. This seems criminal to me.
"B you are too funny. Did you see the last quarterly report? They guided much lower for the upcoming quarter and that most likely means hokas great growth story slowed down, or uggs is going to have a very bad quarter. Better hope the great hoka has sales of at least $80 million this quarter or this is dropping fast."

All these upgrades aren’t doing anything for the share price. Looking for a bounce so I can short this UGGly company again.
"Loved their products of Hoka One One and Teva, later bought the stock."
Quite a run the last few days. 400! My token investment a couple years ago should be enough to pay for my hoka obsession for life.
"Growth slowing down with the trade war no ending in sight, except when Donald or Steve tweet we almost have a trade deal.

DECK reached an all time high at 186.16
The cancelation of the share repurchase agreement has cost this company and its shareholders over 1 Billion dollars.
Pathetically low volume today. This is just consolidation action
another 10% swing to the down side. A stock with such a low float should not be so volatile. There are not enough shares to be traded in this fashion. This is manipulation at its finest.
12% to the down side. Not acting like it should.

"Falling $18 is a little over done. The Q was a real good one, should be at all time highs before November. Very healthy correction to shake out the Georges. Straight up from here."
What does a company do when they have no debt and tons of cash and only 27.9 million outstanding shares? Is a split in order? Special dividend? Taken private? Spin off Hoka? What is the next step to enhancing shareholders value?
wow dow is down -440 and Deck is up to 96.1.. that is impressive...
I don't understand how having a billion in cash sitting around not buying shares back and not paying a dividends is a good thing for shareholders?
Hoka has forbidden all online merchants from offering promotional discounts on Hoka footwear. Hoka shoes must be selling really well.
25% of the people walking around the mall had UGG on and there was a line just to enter the UGG store. UGG's are back in fashion and in demand. Stock will double in a year.
"Even if there are no profits in the future for DECK which is certainly not the case. The 400k share repurchase is a instant 20% pop in the share price. If there are profits they will be 20% more powerful. This stock will trade over $100 in less then 6 months. So, if Deck is successful the share price doubles in a year. See you at $140, soon."
"I'm waiting for a big announcement, what are they waiting for? They can't just sit on a billion dollars and do nothing. They don't have a share repurchase plan anymore they don't pay a dividend, what are they gonna do with all the cash??? I'm sure the bonuses and salaries are gonna rise but what are they going to do to enhance shareholder value?"
Anyone want to see if you can predict the share price after earnings? Selig?? $127.60 is my prediction.
"Based off stock price action...might not feel like they crushed the numbers...but the numbers were crushed. If you follow the chart, Deckers is typically inefficiently priced to the under. Worth 160. Z"
How about a 5 for 1 split and an even more aggressive buyback?? Spin off UGG?
"It's comical that the stock is up over 5% in after hours, since they warned for next quarter."
according to Yahoo DECK has taken on over 200 million in debt an has 150 million less cash then last quarter. Is this due to end of year bonuses? Where is the money going to?
The only reason a stock would drop 12% right before earnings are released is because they leaked the results. Can anyone think of a different reason?
wasn't this stock above $180 a few weeks ago? Why the $50 drop?
Wedbush lifts price target from $138 to $148Lol
"You may get a breather at $260 but then again, maybe not. This company has a ton of dough, what are they gonna do with all this cash? Something to enhance shareholder value I'm sure."
"One of the best stock to add to my portfolio, I bought today big time. GLTA."
DECK has a ton of debt but they have a ton of cash. They do not pay a dividend and they refuse to purchase their own shares. Why aren't these guys in jail? Can someone explain?
Any long term shareholder have an opinion on where the stock price will be at the end of 2019? Thanks and GLTA
bad news ahead  its going downhill
I guess beating estimates and having enough cash on hand to buy the company is not enough these days.
"I want to be enhanced!! How about a spin-off, split or be taken private or sold. I'll take $250 today even though this could be worth much more in just 5 years."
The share count has not gone down in the past 3 years? I thought they were buying shares back?
DECK goes to $236 when the savings and share repurchase is complete.
"DECK seems to always have a 70% collapse after one of these run ups, it has never not had a 70% collapse."
At $84 they put a halt to the share repurchase agreement with $500 million left. Now that the stock is closing in on $400 they want to bring it back?? Why are these guys still employed and not in jail?
Sam Poser raised his price target to 67 after the earnings report. So possibly he is even more incompetent than I thought. His price target for Under Armour is 8 -- which also strikes me as fairly wild.
I think we hit a brick wall at $220. I'm guessing we see $220 in less then 6 months.
"UGGs has another winner, I'm seeing these slip-ons with fur in all sorts of colors getting popular. These are new and look goofy at first but when you see the chicks strutting around in these things, they look pretty cool and trendy. DECK doubles by the end of 2019. $230-$260."
Deckers Outdoor reached an all time high at 212.36
The market is getting crushed pre market. I hope I can get $110..
"Sold my 570 shares of DECK at $195.03 for a Super-Duper (Yes, that's what I'm calling it) profit of just under $10.9k. Oh yeah, another 5 figure Big Win, my fourth of the year so far. :-) I have zero five figure losing plays, four five figure winning plays. That's the way to play the Pure Earnings game: Win Big, Lose Small! So I am Green for the week by a few k, despite having 3 losing plays. When I research my plays, I specifically try to find plays that will go down SMALL, if they fail, while at the same time giving good odds of going up BIG, if they succeed. :-) Immediately jumped into ABG as my next Pure Earnings play. Long 1100 shares at $97.10. Stock was trending down for most of the day, traders and investors nervous about the ER coming pre-market on Monday, but I jumped right in and remain confident and optimistic that the odds are in my favor for an earnings beat, and for the stock to pop up nicely on Monday. We shall see if my current one-play winning streak can extend to two, on Monday. Best Wishes to All!"
"gonna be a very lean, mean, shoe making machine when business gets back to normal. $260 by the end of the year.."
"It's all in the guidance folks. The market is thinking 6-12 months down the road. An earnings beat this Q means absolutely nothing. The beat was priced in months ago, hence the $137 high. That is the past, it looks to me like next year is being figured to be a not so good year."
"Deckers' guidance is very weak. I don't think the pre market move will be sustainable, because of the guidance. Also one of their analysts raised the price target from $132 to $145. This is a 12 month price target of $145, so he apparently is betting on downside from here."
Short at open
"Is everyone happy about the $50 drop? The management must be finished with the buybacks. Jocogo, are you happy??"
If shareholders have to wait for their share value to be enhanced. I say this management and the board should have to wait for their bonuses and raises.
last 4 months have shown max downside is 111...upside...100's of dollars. Z
Stock being punished again. Down 20 points in the last couple weeks.
I would like to see DECK buy CROX. I believe it would be a nice fit and the added billion+ a year in revenue would be extra nice. The 2 companies do not cross paths in the shoes they make. What else they gonna do with the money?
DECK is up 5.22% to 109.08
That's pretty impressive! Wow!!
"It would seem that yesterday's sell-off was mainly selling by holders who had bought DECK in hopes of a sale of the company and a quick profit. Such people would have no interest in the fundamentals. Yet as I have indicated in the past, all signs point of very strong quarter. I am amazed at how well UGGs of various kinds are selling -- not only in the US but in other countries such as Germany and France. I have followed this company for a long time, and believe this is a very good investment at the present time.By the way, PEOPLE magazine recently had a feature on the return to popularity of UGGs with celebrities. It shows 20 celebrities wearing their UGGs (of various kinds). Wonderful for business!"
Interesting... who do you think will win?http://www.camdencourier.com.au/story/4636754/battle-to-use-the-term-ugg-boots-continues-in-us-court/?cs=4073
