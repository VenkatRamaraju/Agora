"they lost 38 million last year according to sqwak box yesterday. diversey was owned by unilever.. sold to Johnson wax professional, then went to private equity, then sold to sealed air, then sold to private equity, now public... at each step they sold mfg sites and real-estate to stay afloat and pay down debt. Bain capital trying to salvage a bad investment."
"Does anyone know anything about this company? I couldnt find any Quarterly reports, how am I supposed to buy shares if I dont even know if the company makes a profit?"
