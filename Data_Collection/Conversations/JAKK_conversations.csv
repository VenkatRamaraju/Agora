When Jack's beats 4th qrt estimates Stock will rocket over 10. low float stock. Anything under $20 is a great buyout opportunity.
Still early on the way up. Shares are cheap and limited so lock yours down while they are cheap.
Whatever happened to JAKKS PACIFIC ANNOUNCES RECEIPT OF EXPRESSION OF INTEREST FROM MEISHENG TO ACQUIRE 51% OF SHARES for $2.95 per share ???
THIS IS A 20.00 STOCK Caught in the wraths of Wall Cheat.
Everyone does know this does an RS tonight... so we get to loose even more! Yeah!
What is the reason for the rally with huge volume ? Anyone ?
This stock should be climbing as they start production of holiday toys this month.
Meadster sent me here.
445 k shares traded today. 2.8 million float. This one continues to move up!!
What in the world happened here
Jakk is such a low cap stock has little to know analyst following or recommending. private equity looking for a place to park $$$$. Jakk makes a smart move.
Great news today I think jakk is worth more than 2.95 imo but we will be controlled by a much bigger company
Somehow all these promoters post 20-100 tweets on pumps like $MVIS $IDEX $UAVS $JAKK $CCXX $DLOC $GAHC $TMXN $MTSL but then they go quiet & NEVER give sells on any pump & sometimes never even mention them again as it just brings up too much negativity. When will people wake up?
Jakks Pacific is up 10.52% to 7.46
JAKK is up 7.95% to 2.38
When news breaks nothing to keep it from rocketing over $20. All fundamentals improving. Buyback sends it to the moon. 75 mill in cash.
this is interesting action on low floater to start...could see 2+ pump easy
can't go much lower
Whats the target price for this??
Time to buy on the dip and extremely low volume. Only going one way after earnings. UP..
"The latest selling is probably end of the year, tax loss, selling. I expect a good bounce in January."
Got in .95
"Since Jan1, 2018, JAKK Pacific insiders have purchased over 2 million shares, and sold only 40k shares. And they bought at significantly higher than current prices. DYO research, But this seems way under priced now."
"Have y'all noticed that whenever you scroll to the conversations tab of a stock, it's almost always positive? I think it's because people who own it are wildly optimistic."
"Party's over, back to the 4's."
Jakk will be releasing apex legends action figures blasters plushes this is huge for gaming and toy companies.
Sell.
GME type returns in next 12 months. easy money from here!!
"These numbers are strong - up 18% vs 2019? (pre-covid). Excellent. Insider buying. Small float. Much, much higher we go."
"i don't get how this does not get closer to 2.95- if the Chinese company has suspended trading to settle their buying a large portion of JAKK at that price- unless there is the possibility of more shares being issues, but I can't see that happening. These guys have already committed twice before buying up shares in March 2017 for 19.3 million at about 5.27/share 18% of jakks ownersip"
This will rise with all the merchandise Disney and star wars will sell through them
"Obviously JAKK has a pendulum chart but beside that also dynamic!As expected we have seen some dropped after the earning reports, if you check the business update, then you might see whats coming on next earning reports. Some of Disneyland has been reopened and the other also preparing to reopening... Pretty sure that JAKK is gonna surge soon and smoothly as the volume is getting better."
"Sundial Growers Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL) Enters Licensing Agreement With Simply Solventless Concentrates one more info new crypto maybe next bitcoin potential long term investment without spending any money or giving any of your info out other than your name..... download ""pi network"" app and start in 2008.

Great start today... hoping to continue climb for the rest of the week...
"The 3 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for JAKKS Pacific Inc have a median target of 1.00, with a high estimate of 1.15 and a low estimate of 0.55. The median estimate represents a +56.30% increase from the last price of 0.64"
Folks JAKK is the next Sykes Supernova trade imo. $2.50 coming!
Hope it holds these after hours gains tomorrow.
How is here any value for the common shares if there is $175+ million in debt and $23 million in preferred (plus accrued divs) - the whole company is probably only worth around $200 million today
Getting ready to get fun!!! If Jakk were to come market today it would be a $30+ stock. I have a large sell order in at $30.
Everyone does know that us shareholders just voted on a reverse split right ?
LOW VOLUME SHORT GAMES. Great Opportunity!
strong buy zacks
Beware of offering like GNUS almost make 8k but walked away with 2 stock can go to .65 cents in 60 seconds !!!! Just be careful
"Wake up, people. JAKK is down today STRICTLY in sympathy with the big boys in the toy world, HAS and MAT. I bought 1,000 more shares at $2.35 in AH. When HAS and MAT pop back up, so will JAKK."
Conviction.Huge short and long term gains.
JAKKS Pacific is up 12.72% to 13.38
https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200218005003/en/INSERTING-REPLACING-JAKKS-Pacific-Partners-M-Star-Media
Volume in the after hours
It's time to sell the company as the board and company leaders have lost credibility.
"They were able to send it down last 45min on low volume. if it opens at this level, buy with both fist!!!"
Jakks Pacific is up 10.71% to 8.65
"senior notes will be settled first, then how much left over? What is the reason for 51% ownership- will the endgame be full ownership or was this to have more board seats or what?"
Unbeliabable selling 3.6 million shares @ 5.27 when the stock is close to its lowest level in years. Mr Berman and company have been collecting millions of dollars in compensation with total disregard to investors. This guys are totally incompetent and should be sued for negligence!!!
lol Shortie is trapped here. News coming and with virtually no volume right now its gonna be fun watching them try to cover. lol
#JAKK in play. On watch for clear above 2.84.
"Even after pandemic, do you guys it has more room for growth?"
Almost in the buying range....
"I don't think the movement stops now... wait a few days, you will see the share price going to $7"
Why does Yahoo insist on trying to fix things that aren't broken?Does anyone know how to get back to the old yahoo finance page????
Good chances this will be closing at $2 this Friday
Merry Christmas. 2021 will be a great year for Jakks and it's share holders.
"While the rest of the market zoomed up 440 Dow, Jakk was unchanged. Why ? The answer is probably that ,today, TOYS-R-US announced that they are considering bankruptcy and closing ALL stores"
this is ready to explode now. With the buyback about done and the business falling apart we will see new lows very soon. Looking for sub 4 by year end. We have been short here for close to a year from 8-10 and had to wait for this time because of the BS buyback. This will go even lower now though after the buyback as they wasted the money and bought shares at huge inflated prices.
"Strange day. Looking forward to when the dust settlesToday volume according to Yahoo finance was 927,591According to Yahoo finance screen as of July 9th:Shares Outstanding 35.55M, / 10 RS would make today 3.555MFloat 12.88M, / 10 RS would make today 1.288MShares short as of June 15th 2.21M, / 10 RS would make today 221K"
I smell a Buyout and a BIG ONE TOO. No Brainer. Wall Cheat suppressing stock for a reason. Cmon Jakks announce DISNEY and EA
Jakk is a very low float stock selling for pennies compared to sales. look for a buyout with 75 million in cash.
Monday will be %150 for sure 
"Well they were offered 9-10 Dollars in Buyout last year, Much Stronger Company Today, so will they take 20-25????? I think soo. Watch Volume here cause JAKKS may be for sale at the right price. Mattel?? Hasbro???"
"$JAKK Only 16 million shares traded today ;This is going higher then $IZEA $GNUS did ,it runs lighter .Imagine what a 50million share day is going to do on monday .Easy$2 on monday ;Stop watching the afterhours action.Monday the fun begins here"

"JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (the “Company”) will be relying on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Order under Section 36 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Modifying Exemptions From the Reporting and Proxy Delivery Requirements for Public Companies dated March 25, 2020 (Release No. 34-88465) (the “Order”) to delay the filing of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 (the “Report”) due to circumstances related to COVID-19. As a result of the current stress on the Company’s supply and delivery chains, the Company’s resources, which include key employees working on matters directly related to the completion of the Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Report”), have been substantially focused on addressing such issues as well as diligently attempting to prepare accurate financial models in an ever and quickly-changing business climate. As a result, the Company has not yet gathered all of the documents it requires to timely file the Report in an appropriate fashion which will adequately and accurately present the Company’s financial position in a way protective of its shareholders and investors. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Company expects to file the Report no later than May 14, 2020 (which is 45 days from the Report’s original filing deadline of March 30, 2020). In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the Company expects to include the following Risk Factor in its Report along with other required disclosures: (NOTE: Consistent with the terminology of the 10-K, the terms “we” and “our” refer to the Company). We face risks related to health epidemics and other widespread outbreaks of contagious disease, which could significantly disrupt our supply chain and impact our operating results. Significant outbreaks of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments, could have a material impact on our business operations and operating results. In December 2019, a strain of Novel Coronavirus causing respiratory illness and death emerged in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei province of China. The Chinese government has taken certain emergency measures to combat the spread of the virus, including extension of the Lunar New Year holiday, implementation of travel bans and closure of factories and businesses. The majority of our materials and products are sourced from suppliers located in China. Significant development and spread of the Coronavirus did not take place until January 2020. At December 31, 2019, only certain events and associated actions had taken place, such as the Wuhan Municipal Health Committee’s issue on December 30, 2019. Although cases were reported to the World Health Organization (“WHO”) on December 31, 2019, the WHO did not announce the Coronavirus as a global health emergency until January 30, 2020, which prompted national governments to begin putting actions in place to slow the spread of COVID-19.The Coronavirus was subsequently declared a global pandemic by the WHO in March 2020 and has been spreading throughout the world, including the United States, resulting in emergency measures, including travel bans, closure of retail stores, and restrictions on gatherings of more than a maximum number of people. To the extent that these outbreaks are disruptive to local economies and commercial activity, that development will likely create downward pressure on our ability to make our product line available to consumers or for consumers to purchase our products, even if our products are available. At this time, we cannot predict with any certainty the severity with which this disease will strike the United States or other places worldwide where we sell our products or manufacture our products. Accordingly, we cannot estimate the extent by which we will be negatively impacted by this disease. In the relatively short period with which the world has been dealing with this pandemic, significant economic turmoil has already impacted world markets. Numerous nationally recognized economists are predicting that the disease will lead to a worldwide recession. Should that occur, we can expect that our sales, net income and cash flows will be negatively impacted. While the governmental organizations of the United States, as well as governments across the world, are implementing emergency economic measures and announcing the consideration of additional emergency economic assistance packages, it is unclear what impact they are having, and will have, on the economy in the United States and worldwide. Great uncertainty surrounds the length of time this disease will continue to spread, the number of people it will impact, directly and indirectly, and the extent governments will continue to impose, or add additional, quarantines, curfews, travel restrictions and closures of retail stores. In addition, even following control of the disease and the end of the pandemic, the economic dislocation caused by the disease to so many people may linger and be"
If you just reading this you are probably already late to the party. Be as long as the volume stay up (already beat avg. volume within first 30 minutes) and is still moving up might as ride this out to Q1 earnings.
If case any of you missed it.https://jakks.com/investors/press-releases.php
Can’t wait until Monday 
"One of my worst investments- still holding but wondering how they have not had management shakup or been bought out for one or 2 decent products. They had past trends aligned with movies or POWer rangers or some thang in the past where they did superb, and Frozen the most recent, but something is amiss. Could be the convertible notes hanging over their head, with some being renegotiated, or trade war with China with Chinese ownership being a tad questionable. But they have some strengths- like the costume and princess gown stuff. Toys R us thing is overdone- Wallmart will gladly pick up the space- but it is crowded."
Jakked bagholders still here? Amazing. This will be BK soon!!
not much of a numbers guy but looks like the bleeding has been stopped. Love to know what the meshing / spelling long paragraph means- esp the convertible notes.
"I just checked the insider buys/sells for 2018. They listed 10 transactions : 2 were sales totaling a little over 40k shares ,the others were buys totaling over 2000k shares. Check for yourself."
What’s going on with this stock
I think after such a jump the profit takers will pull this back down. I'll wait before I buy in.
JAKKS Pacific is down 8.74% to 10.97
NO WONDER they didnt take last years 10.00 Buyout offer.!! Lmao Next offer over 20.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Don’t chase just bc the gap tooth twitter pumper

"6.5k+ shares thus far, there are a number of inflection points for this company and that refinancing deal is great news! check out courage and conviction and investing on seeking alpha if you want to know the details."
Ready for earnings!! $20 by May.
Short term bottom is in. 8 was a good retracement before the big push up!!
"This might be why we popped up yesterday...this article came out shortly after the rise in stock price. Some had new prior to this release...https://finance.yahoo.com/m/724bf5d4-2466-3207-b753-f5ac9097e3a1/mattel%2C-hasbro.html?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahooMattel, Hasbro well-positioned for coronavirus as consumers give up pricey entertainment in favor of toys: UBSMarketWatch Tonya Garcia,MarketWatch•March 30, 2020Mattel Inc. and Hasbro Inc. are well-positioned to manage the coronavirus pandemic as consumers shift their spending from pricey entertainment to toys, according to UBS. Analysts put the average price of a toy at $10, with more than two-thirds of toys priced at less than $25. ""Cutting back on higher-ticket entertainment spend (e.g. visit to Disneyland) can often result in replacing more expensive activities with cheaper in-home entertainment options, such as toys,"" UBS wrote. Walt Disney Co. parks in both Florida and California are closed until further notice due to the outbreak. Mattel stock has dropped 32.5% over the past year. Hasbro is down 18.8% for the period. And the S&P 500 index is down 8.6% for the last 12 months."
another 700 shares picked up.
why is this down after a fantastic ER.
Here's the smallest violin for everyone who got tricked by Stan the Pumping Man.
Great volume... will this be the next GNUS...
back into her cave she goes
EA Sports and Disney? Whispers of contracts. Need to confirm. Could see $1.50-$2.00 very quickly imo
"I don’t think it’s over , I’m long and foolish"
I wouldn’t be surprised to see a big move here soon.
Nice volume and price action yesterday the pushed the stock up. Giving some back so loading up the boat again! Good luck to Longs! Like to see this trade up into the single digits someday.
JAKK is up 8.77% to 3.10
My guess is that JAKK is due for a pullback in the short-run. Ive been struggling with this stock lately. Some of my other trades have been from awesom-eSTOCKS which are working out pretty well.
JAKK is up 7.32% to 2.20
"Why is this under a buck? Recent article 3-30-20 suggest to hold I beleive they should be worth 10 times .32. Hopefully I am right...It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Jakks Pacific (JAKK). Shares have lost about 60.8% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Jakks due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.JAKKS Pacific Q4 Earnings Miss Estimates, Revenues TopJAKKS Pacific reported fourth-quarter 2019 financial numbers wherein earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues beat the same.The company reported adjusted loss of 26 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 17 cents by 52.9%. However, the figure narrowed from the year-ago loss of 37 cents by 29.7%.Revenues of $152.5 million beat the consensus mark of $149.9 million by 1.7%. Moreover, the top line increased 15.3% year over year. This uptick can be attributed to strong sales of Disney Frozen 2 and Disguise products.Operating HighlightsIn the reported quarter, gross margin was 30.4%, down 20 basis points (bps) from the prior-year level. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $3.3 million against a negative of $1.6 million reported in the prior-year quarter.Balance SheetAs of Dec 31, 2019, cash and cash equivalents amounted to $61.6 million compared with $53.3 million as of Dec 31, 2018. Inventory increased to $54.3 million from $53.9 million at 2018 end. Long-term debt as of Dec 31 totaled $175 million, up from $139.8 million at the end of 2018.2019 HighlightsNet sales amounted to $598.6 million, up 5% year over year.Adjusted loss per share for the year ended Dec 31, 2019 was reported at 73 cents compared with a loss of $1.25 in 2018.Adjusted EBITDA for the full year was $18.9 million compared with $2.3 million in 2018.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Fresh estimates followed a downward path over the past two months. The consensus estimate has shifted -76.32% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Jakks has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a B. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookJakks has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months."
WOW; want to make more than trading this? AWESOME SHORT CHECK OUT BBI. 50% min downside advantage 
I am thinking of starting a position on JAKK. What are the biggest pros and cons? I need to decide if the position will be short or long... I hope that with your help I will make the right decision...
"I got a good feeling about this, insider buying shares for 6 million, and report coming today or tomorrow."
guess the senior notes gonna be settled real soon
why all the buying.... almost 30x normal shares traded. There are only 35 million outstanding shares with 9 million being the float.
"Locked and loaded. Bought more today. Very encouraged by improving margins and focused on making money rather than just sale volume. JAKKS made a lot of bad acquisitions over the years, not it's time for it to be acquired while it's down."
"Catalysts in place to reach higher prices, now. Someone keeps pressing it down ?"
No shares to buy. lock them down and next January will be over $20.

damnnnnnnnn miloooorrrdddddd 78k
Jakk continues to move up. Read the last qrts cc notes. 2021 will be the best year in the last 5. could see 30 if they do what I expect. very cheap for a buyout .
Seems like when stocks are up more than ever the company takes advantage and does an offering much less than current market value that really can hurt !!! I was in gnus and izea and saw the them tank hard ...
$16.3 mill or 2.86 share available in float. Lock those shares down for the next year and you will be richly rewarded.
"I can't see why they would buy a skin product company- this is bizarre. Unless it is to go with the princess dresses or some plan to market princess makeup brand, but even that is a stretch. How does a purchase like this happen- seems very much an impulse buy."
JAKK is up 11.58% to 2.90
Bear trap?
"My feeling is that they have to be doing well this quarter. So many kids at home, even though there are no Toys Are Us, there are plenty of online places to get Jakks products. Being quarantined I've built 4-5 puzzles, I never do puzzles. So, I'm sure people are out there buying toys other than just video games etc. People are watching older movies since there are no new ones. (like Frozen)just my opinion. Probably long into earnings."
"Just sold @ 50% loss, beter than the 75% tomorrow! $2320.58 POOF!!!"
"With Nintendo and WWE and Target stocks on the move, JAKK sells these action figures of Nintendo and WWE figures at Target. I am very bullish on JAKK!!"
anyone know why the stock moved higher today on higher volume?
"Lets Go JAKK Mgmt, If Wall Cheat wont buy our stock then BUYBACK rest of the Float!!!!!!"
"Some of you may not have been around for a few years so I'll remind you of some of the history here. If my memory is wrong please post a correction.A few years ago there was an offer of around $19 / share for a buyout of Jakk which was a premium to the then current price. Of course, management's advice was that it wasn't a reasonable price and the offer did not materialize. Since then it's been mostly down hill now to $1.00."
I'm hoping to see a rebound here with a reopening of civilization and parents splurging on their kids... jmo.
"what's the share count now? 32,000,000 / 10 = 3,200,000 million shares? Is that correct?"
"Still Time to Look at $JAKK, Key date approaching. Here is the link http://crweworld.com/article/news-provided-by-business-wire/221412/jakks-pacific-to-announce-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017"
JAKK is up 6.67% to 2.40
guys check SIPC its worth to see. hemp beer company with distribution in place
bullish
Red to green play
Is anyone else eyeing this company? I got to believe that they have staying power. I really think there will be a turn around at some point in the next year. There are enough movies and products coming out that something's got to be a massive hit. I haven't bought shares yet but it's definitely on my radar. Any other thoughts appreciated.
JAKK is way undervalued. If there was a buyout it would be a multiple of sales like 5-7 times sales would be high end and 1 times sales would be low end. If it was bought out for 1 times sales the price fo the stock would move from current price to around $100!
JAKK is up 6.52% to 2.45
Jakks Pacific is up 26.32% to 0.86
Are we supposed to hear some news today or tomorrow?
Anything under 15 should bring a buyout offer this year.
