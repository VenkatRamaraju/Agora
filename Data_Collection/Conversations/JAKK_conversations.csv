"Since Jan1, 2018, JAKK Pacific insiders have purchased over 2 million shares, and sold only 40k shares. And they bought at significantly higher than current prices. DYO research, But this seems way under priced now."
"The 3 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for JAKKS Pacific Inc have a median target of 1.00, with a high estimate of 1.15 and a low estimate of 0.55. The median estimate represents a +56.30% increase from the last price of 0.64"
Jakk will be releasing apex legends action figures blasters plushes this is huge for gaming and toy companies.
Ready for earnings!! $20 by May.
"I got a good feeling about this, insider buying shares for 6 million, and report coming today or tomorrow."
JAKK is way undervalued. If there was a buyout it would be a multiple of sales like 5-7 times sales would be high end and 1 times sales would be low end. If it was bought out for 1 times sales the price fo the stock would move from current price to around $100!
"Lets Go JAKK Mgmt, If Wall Cheat wont buy our stock then BUYBACK rest of the Float!!!!!!"
Jakk continues to move up. Read the last qrts cc notes. 2021 will be the best year in the last 5. could see 30 if they do what I expect. very cheap for a buyout .
"6.5k+ shares thus far, there are a number of inflection points for this company and that refinancing deal is great news! check out courage and conviction and investing on seeking alpha if you want to know the details."
JAKKS Pacific is down 8.74% to 10.97
GME type returns in next 12 months. easy money from here!!
"Obviously JAKK has a pendulum chart but beside that also dynamic!As expected we have seen some dropped after the earning reports, if you check the business update, then you might see whats coming on next earning reports. Some of Disneyland has been reopened and the other also preparing to reopening... Pretty sure that JAKK is gonna surge soon and smoothly as the volume is getting better."
"These numbers are strong - up 18% vs 2019? (pre-covid). Excellent. Insider buying. Small float. Much, much higher we go."
"This might be why we popped up yesterday...this article came out shortly after the rise in stock price. Some had new prior to this release...https://finance.yahoo.com/m/724bf5d4-2466-3207-b753-f5ac9097e3a1/mattel%2C-hasbro.html?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahooMattel, Hasbro well-positioned for coronavirus as consumers give up pricey entertainment in favor of toys: UBSMarketWatch Tonya Garcia,MarketWatchâ€¢March 30, 2020Mattel Inc. and Hasbro Inc. are well-positioned to manage the coronavirus pandemic as consumers shift their spending from pricey entertainment to toys, according to UBS. Analysts put the average price of a toy at $10, with more than two-thirds of toys priced at less than $25. ""Cutting back on higher-ticket entertainment spend (e.g. visit to Disneyland) can often result in replacing more expensive activities with cheaper in-home entertainment options, such as toys,"" UBS wrote. Walt Disney Co. parks in both Florida and California are closed until further notice due to the outbreak. Mattel stock has dropped 32.5% over the past year. Hasbro is down 18.8% for the period. And the S&P 500 index is down 8.6% for the last 12 months."
Great start today... hoping to continue climb for the rest of the week...
"senior notes will be settled first, then how much left over? What is the reason for 51% ownership- will the endgame be full ownership or was this to have more board seats or what?"
Time to buy on the dip and extremely low volume. Only going one way after earnings. UP..
"Locked and loaded. Bought more today. Very encouraged by improving margins and focused on making money rather than just sale volume. JAKKS made a lot of bad acquisitions over the years, not it's time for it to be acquired while it's down."
Is anyone else eyeing this company? I got to believe that they have staying power. I really think there will be a turn around at some point in the next year. There are enough movies and products coming out that something's got to be a massive hit. I haven't bought shares yet but it's definitely on my radar. Any other thoughts appreciated.
"Well they were offered 9-10 Dollars in Buyout last year, Much Stronger Company Today, so will they take 20-25????? I think soo. Watch Volume here cause JAKKS may be for sale at the right price. Mattel?? Hasbro???"
