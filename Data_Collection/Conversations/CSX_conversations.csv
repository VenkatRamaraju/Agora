Ahhhh..stock splits! The can't-miss road to easy money! CSX is now down a full 10% since.
Gonna split again soon
Good thing management spent several hundred grand to split the stock! It sure seems to have helped keep the steady upward momentum intact.
thoughts on the pan am deal????
I just got back in on CSX. As the plugged up east and west coast ports get goods on the ground to move this stock is bound to pick up in price along with other rail and trucking firms.
6-4-21 9 AM ESTThe announced CSX 3 for 1 stock split should have no impact on the SP ...... but IMO it will because it opens the ability of some to purchase CSX at a reasonable price.
"CSX went up over 4% today with volume over twice normal. I did not see any news that would cause this. Is some one big like a hedge fund, privet equity group , or a larger railroad buying up shares in the market?"
Have you guys ever heard of http://alert-sounds.com/? The picks on there are way better than CSX
I'm here for the long haul with $CSX - no reason to panic for long term. Lots of red lately but the dividend is steady.
Nice beat on eps and revenue compared to last comparable quarter. Conference call seems like it should be positive.
The rally is over get out now
"CSX trades higher after Citi turns bullish on 2022 setupJun. 29, 2021 7:02 AM ETCSX Corporation (CSX)By: Clark Schultz, SA NeCiti upgrades CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) to a Buy rating from Neutral and calls its one of its favorite stocks in the rails sector along Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific.Analyst Christian Wetherbee sees multiple tailwinds for the rails sector into 2022 as supply chain constraints ease and notes high truckload pricing will translate into better rail pricing in 2022 as contracts reset on a lag.Citi points to established operating leverage and efficiencies for CSX and notes share buybacks could be supportive of EPS growth.The firm assigns a price target of $116 off higher 2022 EPS estimates.Shares of CSX are up 1.60% premarket to $32.28 vs. the 52-week trading range of $22.18 to $96.24."
Carl - any words of wisdom?? Didn't think so....
The market will tank this week pulling Csx down with it
My Grandfather was an engineer on the B&O for 55 years. He left me all of his B&O stock which turned into CSX stock. An unbelievable run! It gets better every day. I've always said the value of the railroads is they own their own highway right of way and no one today can start a new railroad. CSX has a great future!
"after it reports tomorrow (wednesday), who thinks this goes higher? or does it proceed sideways for a few months?"
"Just imagine if today, instead of still being a rump railorad that waits for BNSF and UNP to transfer over freight in Chicago for CSX to then ship on into the eastern seabord...imagine if CP-CSX freight was unloaded from ships in Vancouver and express dleivered direct. All that additinal business that is now being redirected to Canadian ports from LA....millions of tons of freight. Sure, you still get a good chunk of the reduced amount that's currently shipping, just by being CSX. But you'd get a helluva lot more as part of a super-efficient, ""CP-CSX Transcontinental Express"". But it's just money, right? Y'all are here for the ""whoo whoo!!"""
"Insiders sold in the last week 5 million share about a 150,000,000 something going on insiders know some bad news coming"
Putting together coal trains ain't going to hurt the bottom line.
Get on the train it is leaving the station and not going to stop!
Next stop $45
Oil is going straight up.Even with hedge contracts CSX will feel the pain
What a beautiful stock!
CSX is a sound company with great returns. It is a keeper!!
Is the sky high gas price helping the railroad stocks??????
Feeling very Bullish on this.
Great buying opportunity
I think Governor DeSantis' invitation to shippers to come to Florida ports is really going to be a plus for CSX. That combined with coal needs this winter make this a bullish play.
oh boy;!!. I'm so happy about my CSX INVESTMENT about a month ago
Beautiful stock!
Jobs slipping Economy will follow.Hurricanes and covid reallly helping out Csx slipping
"Solid 2Q earnings but rising cost pressures in 2H on laborCSX reported 2Q21 adjusted EPS of $0.40, up 81% year-year, above our $0.36, and theStreet’s $0.37 estimate. GAAP EPS included a $349 million ($0.12/sh) benefit from thesale of property to the Commonwealth of Virginia. Normalized results include an $18million ($0.01/sh) benefit related to state fuel taxes and $18 million in other real estategains, a counter expense above our $5 million estimate ($0.01/sh). CEO Footehighlighted the growth was in all segments (carloads up 27% y-y, and 4% sequentially, inline with our forecast) and it has high demand for capacity from customers (yields wereup 5%, above our 2% forecast). Despite its strong results, CSX acknowledged thatcongestion at yards, and issues with securing labor were weighing on service andlimiting volume growth. It is working to counter this pressure through hiring initiativesand expects gradual improvement in network fluidity and service levels by year end. Thismirrors issues at other Class 1 rails, possibly signaling rising cost pressures. Thecompany reaffirmed its double-digit revenue growth outlook in 2021 (we were +11%,now 16%), but notably left out its expectation for operating leverage on volume growth,which it mentioned last quarter. We expect the acquisition of Quality Carriers to add 300bps to full-year revenue growth (+6% on a full-year basis), but to also drag on margins.Given a 100% OR from Quality’s revenues and rising costs, we look for approximately300 bps of sequential OR deterioration in 2H21, from the 55.1% OR posted in 2Q21."
Csx charts are not looking good at all
Is this still a good entry to get in
Holder for over 5yrs with cost base of $6.59.Buy and hold does work
