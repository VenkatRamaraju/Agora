Is this still a good entry to get in
"after it reports tomorrow (wednesday), who thinks this goes higher? or does it proceed sideways for a few months?"
Beautiful stock!
Holder for over 5yrs with cost base of $6.59.Buy and hold does work
"US recovery will need rails to transport incrrased goods to customers. The latest round of stimulus checks will increase purchases of goods. In addition any infrastructure deal will be yet another, even larger boom, for rails. Own CSX, don't trade it!"
"Insiders sold in the last week 5 million share about a 150,000,000 something going on insiders know some bad news coming"
Get on the train it is leaving the station and not going to stop!
Dear CSX...….. Is it not time to address dividend ???
Does anyone know if the track maintenance is being deferred?
I think Governor DeSantis' invitation to shippers to come to Florida ports is really going to be a plus for CSX. That combined with coal needs this winter make this a bullish play.
"Solid 2Q earnings but rising cost pressures in 2H on laborCSX reported 2Q21 adjusted EPS of $0.40, up 81% year-year, above our $0.36, and theStreet’s $0.37 estimate. GAAP EPS included a $349 million ($0.12/sh) benefit from thesale of property to the Commonwealth of Virginia. Normalized results include an $18million ($0.01/sh) benefit related to state fuel taxes and $18 million in other real estategains, a counter expense above our $5 million estimate ($0.01/sh). CEO Footehighlighted the growth was in all segments (carloads up 27% y-y, and 4% sequentially, inline with our forecast) and it has high demand for capacity from customers (yields wereup 5%, above our 2% forecast). Despite its strong results, CSX acknowledged thatcongestion at yards, and issues with securing labor were weighing on service andlimiting volume growth. It is working to counter this pressure through hiring initiativesand expects gradual improvement in network fluidity and service levels by year end. Thismirrors issues at other Class 1 rails, possibly signaling rising cost pressures. Thecompany reaffirmed its double-digit revenue growth outlook in 2021 (we were +11%,now 16%), but notably left out its expectation for operating leverage on volume growth,which it mentioned last quarter. We expect the acquisition of Quality Carriers to add 300bps to full-year revenue growth (+6% on a full-year basis), but to also drag on margins.Given a 100% OR from Quality’s revenues and rising costs, we look for approximately300 bps of sequential OR deterioration in 2H21, from the 55.1% OR posted in 2Q21."
Carl - any words of wisdom?? Didn't think so....
"CSX wouldn't spilt the shares at 3:1 unless they were confident that future growth is very optimistic and will reflect in the shsre price. GDP tracking at 6-8% for the rest of 2021 will drive a massive boost industrial and product shipments by rail and intermodal revenues. IMO, anyone selling shares here will regret it. GLTA!"
"Unusual trading today. The last 15 Minutes, around 2 million shares traded, and stock went up about 60 Cents by 4pm.Then in after market stock traded additional 11 Million more shares, and only up 9 cents..... DO WHAT ???? CSX last minute buys for 4th Q ???? No clue"
"Split disposition ?? I have 1774 shares of CSX that I HAD planned to hold onto till my retirement. The problem I have is CSX keeps saying the 3-1 split will be done as a dividend per their new release and including all other new stories. They do not say it will be a tax free split. I do not want to pay taxes on this dividend. I have asked a couple of people in CSX management(via email) but nobody will respond. The last person was in investor relations at CSX, Nick Pittman, but I am STILL waiting on some kind of response. If it is a taxable dividend, I would rather sell it all before the split(paying less taxes on long term capital gains) and repurchase it after the split. Can anybody help me with a confirmed news release or a CSX contact(that will actually respond) with true facts on the split."
"Per the announcement, each shareholder of CSX as of June 18, will receive a stock dividend of 2 additional common shares for every share held. Trading on a split-adjusted basis will begin on June 28."
oh boy;!!. I'm so happy about my CSX INVESTMENT about a month ago
Csx charts are not looking good at all
Oil is going straight up.Even with hedge contracts CSX will feel the pain
"Hugh growth in total carload traffic week 5. CSX was down 3% first 4 weeks, but after this week total down 0.3% Compare UNP total traffic down 12% thru week 4..... But after week 5 total carloads down 10%Trade fears going away..... now Carl should also"
"CSX, based in Jacksonville, Fla., has 21,000 miles of track that runs through much of the eastern U.S. The sale, if completed, will expand CSX’s reach in Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts while adding Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine to its existing 23-state network, the company said in the release."
"CSX 30 year performanceOct 23 1989 you bought 1000 shares, cost $34800.00Oct 23 2019 you would have 12000 shares valued at $860760.00-------- $71.73 per share currentSplits…….. for each one share you would have 12 shares today""""""""""""""Without dividend included""""""""""""""-------- you would have 2373% gain....

The market will tank this week pulling Csx down with it
CSX is a sound company with great returns. It is a keeper!!
What a beautiful stock!
My Grandfather was an engineer on the B&O for 55 years. He left me all of his B&O stock which turned into CSX stock. An unbelievable run! It gets better every day. I've always said the value of the railroads is they own their own highway right of way and no one today can start a new railroad. CSX has a great future!
Gonna split again soon
The rally is over get out now
"Just imagine if today, instead of still being a rump railorad that waits for BNSF and UNP to transfer over freight in Chicago for CSX to then ship on into the eastern seabord...imagine if CP-CSX freight was unloaded from ships in Vancouver and express dleivered direct. All that additinal business that is now being redirected to Canadian ports from LA....millions of tons of freight. Sure, you still get a good chunk of the reduced amount that's currently shipping, just by being CSX. But you'd get a helluva lot more as part of a super-efficient, ""CP-CSX Transcontinental Express"". But it's just money, right? Y'all are here for the ""whoo whoo!!"""
6-4-21 9 AM ESTThe announced CSX 3 for 1 stock split should have no impact on the SP ...... but IMO it will because it opens the ability of some to purchase CSX at a reasonable price.
Next stop $45
"Bottom confirmed. I expected market to have blow out sell off, which happened Dec 24, and that would be bottom for market.Dec 26 dow up over 1k. Dec 27 market test bottom, and stocks down 500 points, and then turned positive and closed up260 points. Even with all the fear due to so-called bad news...the market will continue up.This was a very hard call for me to pass on for investors, because I never want anyone to lose money... and I expectstocks to continue up, especially if a good company meets earnings expectations. Of course volatility will still happen.I don't think anyone will be hurt buying at todays price. glta"
thoughts on the pan am deal????
I just got back in on CSX. As the plugged up east and west coast ports get goods on the ground to move this stock is bound to pick up in price along with other rail and trucking firms.
"smartscore now has csx rated as a 9 out of 10 (10 being their highest rating, which is ""strong buy""). this is higher , than any other railroad i can find. the recent acquisition was made mostly out of leveraged free cash flow. what's not to like!"
Feeling very Bullish on this.
$CSX is a backbone in the US. Incredible fundamentals and opportunities.
Have you guys ever heard of http://alert-sounds.com/? The picks on there are way better than CSX
I'm here for the long haul with $CSX - no reason to panic for long term. Lots of red lately but the dividend is steady.
The only thing I got wrong on all my predictions was divvy increase. Now today I'm batting 100% just 3 weeks later. lol
"I worked for CSX for 38 years before I retired. I have bought stock ever since CSX was created. The stock under performed compared to the rest of the market for ever but I kept on buying and holding. When Michael Ward became CEO things inproved on the railroad and the stock started doing better, but there were still a lot of problems needing attention. I worked there and seen first-hand the inefficientcys that that went on and needed changed. CSX was a good company but it was poorly managed ."
CSX reached an all time high at 35.34
Ahhhh..stock splits! The can't-miss road to easy money! CSX is now down a full 10% since.
Nice beat on eps and revenue compared to last comparable quarter. Conference call seems like it should be positive.
"I just got 1k shares. It is such a value with dividends, stock buybacks, low OR, and constant efficiency gains. Anybody that listens to the bashers on here will be sorry they missed this gift."
"CSX trades higher after Citi turns bullish on 2022 setupJun. 29, 2021 7:02 AM ETCSX Corporation (CSX)By: Clark Schultz, SA NeCiti upgrades CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) to a Buy rating from Neutral and calls its one of its favorite stocks in the rails sector along Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific.Analyst Christian Wetherbee sees multiple tailwinds for the rails sector into 2022 as supply chain constraints ease and notes high truckload pricing will translate into better rail pricing in 2022 as contracts reset on a lag.Citi points to established operating leverage and efficiencies for CSX and notes share buybacks could be supportive of EPS growth.The firm assigns a price target of $116 off higher 2022 EPS estimates.Shares of CSX are up 1.60% premarket to $32.28 vs. the 52-week trading range of $22.18 to $96.24."
Let’s goooooooo 
Is the sky high gas price helping the railroad stocks??????
Prices for diesel fuel going steadily up
Choo chooooo!! Keep chugging along the little first class railroad that could! Daddy needs some more money for the house.
"I have never seen anyone so happy to see others lose money on their stock investments than the frequent poster on this forum. I want everyone to make money and be happy. What is wrong with that? There is enough negativity in this world with what politics is today. CSX is a good company to invest in. The Dow is in line for a 6.7% loss, with the S&P 500 down 7% and the Nasdaq Composite on pace for a 4.6% fall this year and yet CSX is up for year. Five years ago it was around $20. I have been in the market for 40+ years and have seen it go up and down but if you stay in for the long term and invest in companies you know you will make money. I know CSX, I worked for them and have invested in them for 38 years and I am very happy with my returns. I have just one more thing to say, over 75% of CSX stock is owned by institutions and investment funds and whatever is said by one or a group of individual investers on this forum doesn't really matter."
Great buying opportunity
I think CSX has hit bottom. To make big money.... buy when others fear. Now is that time. Everything I have seenabout CSX for Q4 is positive. They report in 26 days (4pm Jan 16th) and the stock will start moving up prior to earnings.Carloads YOY is up this Q over 3000 per week (around 38K) with only 2 more weeks in Q to report. glta
Putting together coal trains ain't going to hurt the bottom line.
Good thing management spent several hundred grand to split the stock! It sure seems to have helped keep the steady upward momentum intact.
Jobs slipping Economy will follow.Hurricanes and covid reallly helping out Csx slipping
Wow. Hunter was really worshiped by the share holders. Maybe I’m wrong but business stability and predictability are more important than one mans hopes and dreams. Let see the CSX get some of that freight back along with employees.
CSX like a rock sinking in a deep dark pond
"CSX went up over 4% today with volume over twice normal. I did not see any news that would cause this. Is some one big like a hedge fund, privet equity group , or a larger railroad buying up shares in the market?"
CSX big beat! Let's hope to hear about adding to the stock buyback or a dividend increase. GLTA!
