"I posted that the selling in CSX is an overreaction, and it was deleted. I bought 2200 shares and some call options. I have no doubt that this stock will be over $80 by Monday."
Is the sky high gas price helping the railroad stocks??????
$CSX is a backbone in the US. Incredible fundamentals and opportunities.
Ahhhh..stock splits! The can't-miss road to easy money! CSX is now down a full 10% since.
Let’s goooooooo 
I would love to see a big dividend raise. CSX has the money and it will benefit all involved. I sent in my request... lets see if they read it ;) maybe it'll make them laugh? Or think more about it.
I'm here for the long haul with $CSX - no reason to panic for long term. Lots of red lately but the dividend is steady.
Credit Suisse after earnings said: Outperform and raised price target from $79 to $81 and if stock pulls backThursday it would be a compelling buy opportunity. I agree... nuff said
"Double stack trains will also get favorable treatment in the upcoming $$$ Infrastructure Bill $$$. CSX's National Gateway (per the latest draft legislation) will get $700M in improvements (e.g. bridge, overpass modernizations) to put more costs savings double stacks out there."
Oh yeah bring on that earnings beat where oh where are the short sellers
2 more days to buy before split
"Moving up today ahead of 4pm earnings report. CARL must be buying, or is he still whining ?"
"I'm not going to break down the week 48 carloads. The trend for eastern roads continues. CSX down 3.0%. NSC up 5.5%. For the year to date; CSX up 0.3% on coal and intermodal, NSC up 4.9% on coal, intermodal, and merchandise."
"Just for fun, and the ""CARL'S"" on CSX. Look at the last 10 yr performance.2-14-2010 1000 shares, cost 44910.00 (split 3/1 Aug 2011)2-14-2020 3000 shares, value 238,200.02 at current price of 79.34up 429.9% and that does not include dividend reinvested...… which is up over 100% since 2011 split."
"We (a small group of investors) loaded up the last couple of days between 51.8 - 53.3. We could sell now and make oversized profits, but won't as there are just darn too many future catalysts to drive this stock's price higher."
i just read that June 29th will be the day ot trades split adjusted

"I am an ex-NASA engineer who last worked on the COBE mission.If you are a skeptic about UFO's the strongest evidence I can give you is provided below.While some are possibly ""black-ops"" military vehicles, there are mountains of evidence and eye witness UFO accounts including Presidents Reagan & Carter, Fife Symington the ex-governor of Arizona, several astronauts, the head of the Lockheed skunk works, pilots, over 400 U.S. government/military/intelligence officials have come forward, etc.The ex-Defense minister of Canada, Paul Hellyer, and astronaut Gordon Cooper have publicly stated that multiple alien species are visiting the earth, see links:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDGxq0Gzmj8https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvPR8T1o3DcThese not just not confined to sightings by one person out in the middle of no-where at 3:00am, but there have been mass sightings in Belgium (13,000 reports), Arizona, O'Hare airport, by entire schools in Zimbabwe and Australia.Perhaps the strongest evidence came at a 2001 conference at the National Press club, where ex-military, NASA, FAA, and intelligence officials came forward to give their experiences.On Wednesday, May 9th, 2001, over twenty military, intelligence, government, corporate and scientific witnesses came forward at the National Press Club in Washington, DC to establish the reality of UFOs or extraterrestrial vehicles, extraterrestrial life forms, and resulting advanced energy and propulsion technologies. The weight of this first-hand testimony, along with supporting government documentation and other evidence, established without any doubt the reality of these phenomena. These individuals offered to give sworn testimony to Congress about their encounters, but Congress has refused to hear them. Instead for 60 years, the government has covered up and lied to the American people about the existence of UFOs.Here is a link to the press conference, please watch and pass on!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-iaV_XW9iE"
"Hey RRJim, out of those supposed 2 CEO's that raised their hand out of the 50+, any guess on percentage of CEO's where Democrats?"
CSX is too underprice stock. Should be trading at least $100 per share just like other Railroad stocks.
Buyer
Not a bad report. It's still a good dividend.
Does anyone know if the track maintenance is being deferred?
Question. What does investors think will be the next big driver of PPS for rails ?1. Continuation of OR improvements2. Trade agreements3. Infrastructure4. US economy growth continuation Don't you think all would be very positive.....right? You have to admit RR's are on fire and future looks great!!!!!!! Your thoughts
Carl!! - Can you pay my taxes for all the GAINS I've made during the last year?? You kept saying this will go down but I've made a ton of money off of this!!! Up over 30%!!!
The rally is over get out now
So is this stock going to trade on Monday if the last chance to buy for 3:1 split was June 18th?
"Now is the time to add a few shares. Take advantage of .02 miss and buy while CSX is being kicked to curb.Don't wait for Fed action at end of this month..... or Pelosi to bring USMCA trade agreement to floor for passage, or China agreement, which I think will pass by end of this year. Not to mention Infrastructure. All will be massivefor CSX. glta"

"It's been a week now since CSX announced it was buying PanAm Rail. That press release had the (yet again MIA) Dodo bird wetting his pants and wearing out the exclamation point on his keyboard. Well, a week later, CSX is the exact same price. A jumbo nothing burger. Meanwhile, CP Rail ----which has announced nothing, bought no one, and just continues to use PSR principles in slogging its way through snow-covered Rockies, delivering freight ontime, to and from the busy west coast ----- is up almost 4% over the same timeframe."
A proud employee and shareholder enjoying the gains....was $24 per share when I jumped on board with this company. Been doing great ever since!!!
upgraded again...................
Jake and Timmay how are those highs?
"Unusual trading today. The last 15 Minutes, around 2 million shares traded, and stock went up about 60 Cents by 4pm.Then in after market stock traded additional 11 Million more shares, and only up 9 cents..... DO WHAT ???? CSX last minute buys for 4th Q ???? No clue"
didn't csx take the ppp money and then do a stock buy back?
im sticking with CSX because of their strategic positioning within the rail system. Wait until some infrastructure work starts taking place. you will see CSX all over the place and growing their web of interconnecting service lines.. Their business plan must be a good one. I see more of their rail cars moving in my area then any other line.
"I worked for CSX for 38 years before I retired. I have bought stock ever since CSX was created. The stock under performed compared to the rest of the market for ever but I kept on buying and holding. When Michael Ward became CEO things inproved on the railroad and the stock started doing better, but there were still a lot of problems needing attention. I worked there and seen first-hand the inefficientcys that that went on and needed changed. CSX was a good company but it was poorly managed ."

I've been out of CSX since 2016. I had owned CSX for decades. Now I'm thinking about getting back in after the split. Like other CSX splits there should be a slight pull back maybe $28-$29 a share. That's when I'm hoping to get back in. Hopefully it doesn't go stagnant like the split in 2011 that lasted till 2015.

BMO Sees Earnings Upside for Surface Transportation Firms, Higher Price Targets19 Dec 2017 15:32 ET 03:32 PM EST, 12/19/2017 (MT Newswires) -- BMO said in a report a U.S. corporate tax reduction to 21% starting in 2018 from the current 35% level could boost earnings of major U.S. railroads, including CSX (CSX), Union Pacific (UNP), and Norfolk Southern (NSC) in the range of 24% to 27% on its F2018 estimates.BMO transportation analyst Fadi Chamoun said in a report Kansas City Southern (KSU) will benefit to a lesser degree, while the benefit to CN Rail and CP Rail (CP) is relatively more modest at around 3.4%, adding that the benefits to logistic and trucking firms are expected to be substantial, and as high as 25% to 28% in the case of JB Hunt (JBHT) and Hub Group (HUBG).The analyst also said the tax-adjusted price target for CSX could rise to $75 from its base-case price target of $60, for NSC to $170 from $137, for UNP to $169 from $134, for CP to $259 from $250 and for KSU to $126 from $115, for FDX to $324 from $265, for UPS to $158 from $130, for CHRW to $103 from $84, for JBHT to $136 from $109, and for HUBG to $58 from $46.Price: 54.68, Change: +1.09, Percent Change: +2.03MT Newswires Click for Restrictions."
"So....about 6 months ago, CSX promoted one of its marketing guys, Kevin Boone, from interim to ""permanent"" CFO. His first achievement? Getting a stock split approved. Aaaand...he's now been moved back to the sales & marketing department. Great to see such management stability, Earth-shaking initiatives, and real operational progress being made!"
"Hey Carl - read this (if your able to read that is)...CSX stock has returned 25.7% YTD (year-to-date). The stock outperformed the returns of the SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN), which invests in US transportation companies. XTN has allocated 42.8% of its funds to the freight and logistics services industry. XTN has gained 10.2% YTD.Mmmmm?"
"Currently at 1023am all rails are in the red, except CSX up $.44 WHY2-7-20 Deutsche Bank moved from hold to BUY and raised target from, $72 to ….$90"
"Congrats to the ex-CFO!! Your creative, value-surfacing initiative of splitting CSX stock really lit a fire under it! CSX has now gone from being an uninteresting $99 share to 3 uninteresting $33 shares. All for the low cost to shareholders of several hundred thousand dollars.Just excellent work."
"CSX faces big headwinds in volumes. It seems as if a ton of the power companies are retiring coal plants, and once these are closed they aren't being replaced by new coal plants. CSX moves a lot of coal so this is going to be a continued decline. On top of that auto sales are weakening, which means less auto transports. Lastly CSX seems to be going around ticking off all their existing customers and wanting to hike their prices. Not a good combination all around for CSX. Their answer is to cut jobs and skimp all around, they'll meet numbers short term, but big picture it's a literally a train wreck over at the company."
CSX reached a new All Time High at 65.47
Jobs slipping Economy will follow.Hurricanes and covid reallly helping out Csx slipping
Beautiful stock!!!
"My CSX outlook. Stock price holding above bottom of 59.75 to 60 per share. Investors should buy some beforeearnings report (2 weeks from today) at 4pm 1/16th. Update Q4 on carloads looks great with company having nearly 4000 cars per week or nearly 48k growth this Q. Expenses also massively improving due to following:Cost for PTC more Engines, remove choke points, extend several passing tracks, open new intermodal terminals inc new cranes, and expand capacity at all terminals....all these issues are wrapping-up on expenses.Stock is around 30% (about $20 per share) below analyst current estimates. Good time to take advantage."
It always pops back up within 6 days from a big drop
"If CSX dives further this week, I believe it is a buying opportunity. Rail stocks have been going up since October, following the rise in the oil price. This trend continues. CSX should recover most of its losses in a few weeks."
$28-$29 area I will add.
How can the ceo taking a med. leave be worth $7.20 off the stock price?
Funny that CNBC is talking about how tariffs didn't affect CSX's quarter. The tariffs had barely taken effect during the quarter. They are barely affecting the fourth quarter.
Doing better than I thought. Though it is a bullish day overall. Let's see if it keeps themomentum and touches 55 this week.
"if you haven't heard mantle ridge is implementing the same strategy at aramark, for those of you who were here when mantle ridge took control you should know that aramark will have similar growth over the next two years"
Choo chooooo!! Keep chugging along the little first class railroad that could! Daddy needs some more money for the house.
just bought 700. What a gift?
down big on td ameritrade after hours any news
Will we see $40 per share by Friday?
Heavy institutional buying on weakness
"CSX actually beat earnings by 4 cents but the way it was reported it made it sound like they missed by a penny. They had earnings of $1.04 estimate was for a $1.00 but they had a one time non-reoccurring charge of 5 cents (related to the early retirement of debt). made it look like they missed by a penny. WHo ever wrote up the press release at ""Global Newswire"" , needs to be fired or at least reprimanded. If not them then either Bryan Tucker CSX Corporate Communications and/or Bill Slater CSX Investor Relations just don't know their job and need to be replaced. What are they trying to do drive the price down? I'm staying long !Ev"
"Time to buy again in premarket. Last Friday I made $3 per share within an hour. Looks like they’ll give me the chance again. Down 12% because a ceo passes, never smart to sell this low."
CSX has been showing support at 47.62 and resistance at 56.04. Buy rating: 5.5 at 9trading.
"The more the price drops, the more vulnerable it is to be bought out."
The only thing I got wrong on all my predictions was divvy increase. Now today I'm batting 100% just 3 weeks later. lol

CSX chugging along nicely
"Anyone here ever heard of PanAm Rail before this? Yeah. I thought so. So please save the ""industry-changing, seismic shifting impact"" boolshi+. Worthless tripe.

Why not buy now?

The Tax Reform and new Infrastructure Bill benefits all flow to the bottom line. Going from 38% (see below) effective tax rate to 21% (maybe 20%) is major good news for longs.

"Carl, dividend bump."
CSX EPS is $3.6 time 17.2 (S&P value without hype) = $62.
Carl needs to move out of our Great country!!! Mexico is awaiting you Carl...
"Split disposition ?? I have 1774 shares of CSX that I HAD planned to hold onto till my retirement. The problem I have is CSX keeps saying the 3-1 split will be done as a dividend per their new release and including all other new stories. They do not say it will be a tax free split. I do not want to pay taxes on this dividend. I have asked a couple of people in CSX management(via email) but nobody will respond. The last person was in investor relations at CSX, Nick Pittman, but I am STILL waiting on some kind of response. If it is a taxable dividend, I would rather sell it all before the split(paying less taxes on long term capital gains) and repurchase it after the split. Can anybody help me with a confirmed news release or a CSX contact(that will actually respond) with true facts on the split."

My condolences to Mr. Harrison's family.
My Grandfather was an engineer on the B&O for 55 years. He left me all of his B&O stock which turned into CSX stock. An unbelievable run! It gets better every day. I've always said the value of the railroads is they own their own highway right of way and no one today can start a new railroad. CSX has a great future!
"Seriously, expected earnings of $1.10 and instead they were $1.08 (which is still 7% growth year over year) and the stock falls 8%! I'll buy some of that!"
"Got more at $68.55 , I mean how can we live without trains ?"
love all the short holders spouting off... clueless. CSX ain't going down long term.
"what happened on 17 july this year? answer: th50/200 ema aka ""the golden crossover"" . the late/great marty zweig used this as one of his primary positive indicators. the train is leaving the station."
Wow. Hunter was really worshiped by the share holders. Maybe I’m wrong but business stability and predictability are more important than one mans hopes and dreams. Let see the CSX get some of that freight back along with employees.

Massive handout and now gone. Only in America. Only ones hurt are shareholders - again.

"Give every shareholder a George Foreman grill. CSX has the money, and it will benefit all involved."
"Well folks this is my stop. I got off this train this morning at $57.00. I must concede that totally clueless Felecia, I told you so Josh, and the rabble of union sanctioned saboteurs may actually be successful in their derailing of this company in their efforts to reorganize and change the way they do business. Which is a shame because in the long haul CSX cannot survive. IMHO. So I'm going to take all of my ill gotten gains and after paying less taxes on it thanks to the Trump tax cuts we as a family are going to Italy for 10 days. Arrivederci."

"PSA for those who might be interested in the ""Hunter Harrison way"" that CSX has embarked upon....A former Canadian business journalist has written the authorized biography on Harrison. ""Railroader"" by Howard Green.It is neither a cheerleading account of his career, nor a hatchet job. (The book was actually finished just after Harrison died, and he never got to read it according to the author.)I'd describe it as unvarnished. Great insight into a unique CEO's genius and his insecurities. Anyone in management should read it...even though Harrison's specific tactics might get anyone today fired. By the numbers, over his career, he made investors in the 4 railways he led (IC, CP, CN and CSX) more than $50 billion. Sure, this isn't on the scale of a ""tech sector"" home-run. But this is very LOW tech. It's simple, centuries-old, heavily government regulated railroading. $50+ billion....with a B. The most fascinating part of the book is the drama of when Harrison was eventually hired as CSX CEO. His amicable-but-financially hardnosed departure from CP, his new contract terms with CSX, and the pressure his rock star status put on the stock, and how that (quite legitimately) had the CSX board in a tight corner. (the title 'railroader' has many connotations...!?) A great read, and a great keepsake of the greatest CEO ever. I highly recommend it."
CSX reached a new high today. So did UNP.

"Intermodal and Coal are what CSX is relying on primarily. When these two income sources decline, they try to pump up their number three which is Chemicals. They are doing that as I write this.EHH shuttered twenty-five percent of the Locomotive roster shortly after he took over. The remaining Locomotive fleet are ""pulling their guts out,"" by pulling trains almost twice as long with one less locomotive at the front. I say pulling their guts out because I know someone in their mechanical dept. who says their Locos are getting more failures of large components like Alternators, engine failures, turbochargers, alt blowers, etc. To put it simply, the money they are saving (capitol costs), they really aren't because they are beginning to pay for these failures now. NSC is where my money is going."
Susquehanna moved from neutral to positive today on CSX and raised target from $74 to $87. PPS moving up accordingly
hey Carl check it out :) up up up
Oil is going straight up.Even with hedge contracts CSX will feel the pain
With no stimulus bill in sight this market will soon struggle to stay up.Csx is wayyy too high on the pps.
CSX is presently overpriced and still a total sell
"I have never seen anyone so happy to see others lose money on their stock investments than the frequent poster on this forum. I want everyone to make money and be happy. What is wrong with that? There is enough negativity in this world with what politics is today. CSX is a good company to invest in. The Dow is in line for a 6.7% loss, with the S&P 500 down 7% and the Nasdaq Composite on pace for a 4.6% fall this year and yet CSX is up for year. Five years ago it was around $20. I have been in the market for 40+ years and have seen it go up and down but if you stay in for the long term and invest in companies you know you will make money. I know CSX, I worked for them and have invested in them for 38 years and I am very happy with my returns. I have just one more thing to say, over 75% of CSX stock is owned by institutions and investment funds and whatever is said by one or a group of individual investers on this forum doesn't really matter."
Here's the bottom line --- the street has not priced in the hefty cuts the railroad industry would see in their deferred tax liabilities carried on their balance sheets. Shareholder equity across the group will increase in value on avg approx 11% on this measure alone.
"Whoever sold me shares at 49.95, thank you."
Week 45. Same story on car loads. CSX down 3.2%. NSC up 4.4%.
"Week 46 carload data is out. CSX Merch. down 4.5%, Coal down 3.7%, Intermodal down .7% Total down 2.9%. NSC Merch down 0.1%, coal down 0.3%, Intermodal Up 6.5%, Total Up 3.5%. The volume story continues."
I talked to the ghost of Prime Osborn. he said CSX will split 2 for one when it reaches $100 in the spring.
"This isn't a CSX stock rally, this is just a market rally on another stimulus bill, and hopes for a virus cure. When the dust settles, everything will pullback again."
Notice when the stock is going up the boo birds disappear and when it goes down they all come out and have a lot to say.Its about making money not being right or wrong.
"I really don't care what CSX does as long as the stock price keeps going up, up, up"
"Rising with good volume.Technically, a potential good entry point here, according to foxchart. Looking for breakout at 55.60 for a run up to 60.04."
"A couple weeks ago RetiredCSX said that had sold 99% of his CSX holdings...it was in the mid-90s then. He claimed that he would wait until a market correction before buying CSX again. Then two days later he announced that he bought CSX again in the 90s because the target price had been raised. When challenged about not waiting for the market correction he claimed that he had already sold what he had bought and made a quick profit. CSX has been going down since then. After being accused of pumping CSX, RetiredCSX got angry and deleted all his posts on this message board. Pretty crazy behavior for someone who at one time was a respected contributor to this message board!I'm sure everybody remembers when RetiredCSX was pumping CSX in the mid-70s prior to it falling to as low as 48 last year."
Buy the dip
I just got back in on CSX. As the plugged up east and west coast ports get goods on the ground to move this stock is bound to pick up in price along with other rail and trucking firms.
Csx charts are not looking good at all

Csx is well overpriced
Hunter Harrison just died..
Good thing management spent several hundred grand to split the stock! It sure seems to have helped keep the steady upward momentum intact.

meh. volume this quarter will be much lower. BNSF publishes weekly and have dropped 20% latest week.
Great buying opportunity
I just wanted to note that I still have all my stock with a cost basis of $6. Thanks Hunter Harrison for the $60 plus price. He may have been ruthless in his management style but he got results.
What are people’s opinion on CSX today?
Post split if CSX goes down to 33 pps how long will it take to hit 50 pps then???More than likely will not happen.A lousy process for CSX shareholders
"This stock is undervalued. The sell off was due to the China Tariffs. Thing is, imports from Vietnam, India, Taiwan, and Europe have offset the decrease from China, such that net imports increased last month. Whether they're railroading a container of stuff from China, or Vietnam doesn't matter."
"Week 39 volume carloads (Week compared to same week last year):CSX Merch. +2.6 Coal +16.4%, Intermodal +1.7%, Total +4.0%, YTD +1.1%NSC Merch. -1.2%, Coal -3.5%, Intermodal +6.0%, Total +2.5%, YTD +4.4%"
"Imagine if CSX had just allowed its shareholders a vote on the Harrison plan to begin with, instead of wasting 18 months fighting it, for the purely selfish protection of the entrenched executive. It would be part of a transcontinental behemoth, with a gateway to Asia. With industry-leader CP, it would now be the most efficient, best run railway in NA. Hunter Harrison would have turned it around long before his health deteriorated. With its combined market cap and network, every investment fund would HAVE to own it. So....enjoy. But CSX completely blew a singularly enormous opportunity."
"Cramer said , BUY, BUY ,BUY"
Jim Foote has no idea along with the sales & marketing team get out unless your looking for a merger
Only shareholders of record 6/18 will enjoy Monday’s 3:1 stock split
CSX reached a new All Time High at 63.67
CSX is up 4.91% to 33.12
Lovin me some CSX as usual!!! How ya doing Carl???
buy now or pay MORE later
Reminder for Derek and Carl. YOU DON’T OWN THE STOCK !!!!!
"Carl, why is this not going down like you said it would over the last few years????I'm tired of making money and paying taxes on it!!!"
"Per the announcement, each shareholder of CSX as of June 18, will receive a stock dividend of 2 additional common shares for every share held. Trading on a split-adjusted basis will begin on June 28."
I think the CSX downfall that Carl has been preachin for a while has just happened! We're down $0.25 cents today and I'm devestated! Well at least the downfall is over now!!! Thanks for the great stock trading tips Carl!!!
I thought the stock split was today?
"Hugh growth in total carload traffic week 5. CSX was down 3% first 4 weeks, but after this week total down 0.3% Compare UNP total traffic down 12% thru week 4..... But after week 5 total carloads down 10%Trade fears going away..... now Carl should also"
up almost 8% not bad
"Not a very good report when you look at the numbers https://www.csx.com/share/wwwcsx15/assets/File/Investors/Q1%202018%20CSX%20QFR.pdfRev flatCost cutting very goodLong term debt load has a large increase most likely for the large share (very large share) buy backAll in all, it shows no growth, even with inflation to support higher numbers"
"smartscore now has csx rated as a 9 out of 10 (10 being their highest rating, which is ""strong buy""). this is higher , than any other railroad i can find. the recent acquisition was made mostly out of leveraged free cash flow. what's not to like!"
Old saying.... buy the dip.... so I added 200 at 77.78.
"so NS beating drives CSX this much, the dividends arent being factored into the artificial growth rate it seems. how can you afford a greater payout without any increase in profit yoy? so odd the way the market is behaving right now"
Buffet says economy and railroads slowing down......
" CSX executives will conduct a conference call with the investment community this afternoon, January 21, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Investors, media and the public may listen to the conference call by dialing 1-866-324-3683. For callers outside the U.S., dial 1-509-844-0959. Participants should dial in 10 minutes prior to the call and enter in 2874369 as the passcode."
"US recovery will need rails to transport incrrased goods to customers. The latest round of stimulus checks will increase purchases of goods. In addition any infrastructure deal will be yet another, even larger boom, for rails. Own CSX, don't trade it!"
"Whether you like Hunters policies or dislike his policies, we should all wish him a speedy recovery and good health for the future.To do otherwise is just being ""un-christian""."
Look at report. Shows you that most of goofs below don't know what they are talking about. It's fine get over it.
Buying on HH's unfortunate death and MORE IMPORTANTLY the coming tax breaks. Railroads are one of the big winners there.
Well I’m back in the game again. In at $31.98. Bought quite a few shares. Will monitor to see if I add. You never know. Wonder if the old haters are around from the last time I was here and held????
"Just got back into good, old, All American, CSX after watching patiently for a bottom several days after the earnings miss. I haven't owned them since last year and believe their earnings will improve with the current booming economy. It was just released this morning that the Economy is growing at a 2.6% rate!! The Fools at the Fed will probably cut rates at least .25% even though unemployment is at 50 year lows, Booming Economy and near all time highs on most of stock averages. This should also help out CSX."
UNP blew it out of the park this morning with earnings. How could CSX get things so wrong?
"Always wanted to own a railroad. If this goes on any meaningful discount, I'll consider buying some. Really like the company."
CSX big beat! Let's hope to hear about adding to the stock buyback or a dividend increase. GLTA!
CSX…long and strong 
The Harrison supporters are slowly become more quite by the Day rumors floating that he is selling off all of toledo and Michigan which means a lot of auto coal and iron ore on top of that mixed freight into the hands of the ns timmmmay pumper where are you at? And Carl needs to come back and say I told you so
This stock looking like a snack. Great PE ratio. Great earnings growth outlook. Great Book value per share. Convinced me
CSX is up 4.91% to 53.39
Comparing the financials to CNI; CSX should be about $101 per share.
Unfortunate buying opportunity. Picked up some more pre-market.https://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/28/the-effects-of-a-ceos-death-on-stock-performance.htmlhttps://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1464&context=gradreports
"CP had a great qtr. Raised dividend another 15%, and now guiding for increased earnings in 2020.Repent. PSR saves."
I think CSX has hit bottom. To make big money.... buy when others fear. Now is that time. Everything I have seenabout CSX for Q4 is positive. They report in 26 days (4pm Jan 16th) and the stock will start moving up prior to earnings.Carloads YOY is up this Q over 3000 per week (around 38K) with only 2 more weeks in Q to report. glta
"Week 9 volume:CSX Merch. -7.4%, Coal +8.9%, Intermodal -0.1%, Total -2.2%, YTD -5.3%NSC Merch. +0.2%, Coal +12.7%, Intermodal +8.4%, Total +6.3%, YTD +1.5%"
Hey Carl!! When is this supposed to go down??? Remind me again.....
"CSX on Thursday reported coal down in Q4 : ""Coal decreased as domestic utility coal demand was negatively impacted by competition from natural gas prices and export coal declined due to reduced international shipments of thermal coal."""
"Looking forward. What happens after earnings tomorrow... If carloads gives a massive clue.... youshould note that in the first 2 weeks of Q1 2019.... CSX has total carload traffic up over 10K per week,or over 21200 growth in only 2 weeks!!!!!!.. The most impressive I have ""ever seen"""
"If it beat by 13%, why is it dropping?"
"They are not gonna build another RR in this country, calm down people, this is great stock to invest...."
"As an engineer at CSX, I can honestly say that we've been waiting for this. The trains have gotten smaller again, especially intermodal. They've cut to the bone, we are running short handed because they haven't wanted to hire. Its gotten so bad that they are parking trains now because nobody is rested. You can only squeeze that orange until the juice is gone, sooner or later its gonna catch up with you."
Carl was right after all... hugely dependent on coal plus pe 32 for a railroad ? This stock could be bigly overvalued.... UAL longs learned the lesson today after it barely dropped ah... my advice is to sell ASAP ah before reality sinks in like it did for ual today...
"I just got 1k shares. It is such a value with dividends, stock buybacks, low OR, and constant efficiency gains. Anybody that listens to the bashers on here will be sorry they missed this gift."
It has more room to run another day.
"CSX wouldn't spilt the shares at 3:1 unless they were confident that future growth is very optimistic and will reflect in the shsre price. GDP tracking at 6-8% for the rest of 2021 will drive a massive boost industrial and product shipments by rail and intermodal revenues. IMO, anyone selling shares here will regret it. GLTA!"
This stock has gone up over 20% a year for the last 60 years.
"In one year investors will look back and say..... why did I not take advantage of $70 pps, prior to FED, trade agreementsand infrastructure. Sorry but snooze and lose, is not very smart action. I stick to my add shares posted 13 pays ago. glta"
Can’t wait for the split!
CSX like a rock sinking in a deep dark pond
Beautiful stock!
"Solid 2Q earnings but rising cost pressures in 2H on laborCSX reported 2Q21 adjusted EPS of $0.40, up 81% year-year, above our $0.36, and theStreet’s $0.37 estimate. GAAP EPS included a $349 million ($0.12/sh) benefit from thesale of property to the Commonwealth of Virginia. Normalized results include an $18million ($0.01/sh) benefit related to state fuel taxes and $18 million in other real estategains, a counter expense above our $5 million estimate ($0.01/sh). CEO Footehighlighted the growth was in all segments (carloads up 27% y-y, and 4% sequentially, inline with our forecast) and it has high demand for capacity from customers (yields wereup 5%, above our 2% forecast). Despite its strong results, CSX acknowledged thatcongestion at yards, and issues with securing labor were weighing on service andlimiting volume growth. It is working to counter this pressure through hiring initiativesand expects gradual improvement in network fluidity and service levels by year end. Thismirrors issues at other Class 1 rails, possibly signaling rising cost pressures. Thecompany reaffirmed its double-digit revenue growth outlook in 2021 (we were +11%,now 16%), but notably left out its expectation for operating leverage on volume growth,which it mentioned last quarter. We expect the acquisition of Quality Carriers to add 300bps to full-year revenue growth (+6% on a full-year basis), but to also drag on margins.Given a 100% OR from Quality’s revenues and rising costs, we look for approximately300 bps of sequential OR deterioration in 2H21, from the 55.1% OR posted in 2Q21."
record highs
Buying anything under $31
Cramer says could be more downside…buy buy buy
another record high!
Csx will sink with the market
Feeling very Bullish on this.
"Bottom confirmed. I expected market to have blow out sell off, which happened Dec 24, and that would be bottom for market.Dec 26 dow up over 1k. Dec 27 market test bottom, and stocks down 500 points, and then turned positive and closed up260 points. Even with all the fear due to so-called bad news...the market will continue up.This was a very hard call for me to pass on for investors, because I never want anyone to lose money... and I expectstocks to continue up, especially if a good company meets earnings expectations. Of course volatility will still happen.I don't think anyone will be hurt buying at todays price. glta"
"@Lisa , Roger Luther gave you very good insight. Panama Canal widening changes everything. There are a couple guys on here that actually know what they are talking about.I'm sure you have figured that out."
6-4-21 9 AM ESTThe announced CSX 3 for 1 stock split should have no impact on the SP ...... but IMO it will because it opens the ability of some to purchase CSX at a reasonable price.
Where is old Management?
"Do any of you have ANY IDEA what 20+ inches of rain in Central Virginia and southern West Virginia will do to the railroad infrastructure there? Or North and South Carolina? By this time next week we could be viewing an flood of major proportions...along the line of Agnes in 65 or so that bankrupted the marginal carriers in the Northeast. EL, D&H and others filed for bankruptcy after that one. Not that CSX or NS would do that but the short lines that feed them will have damage they may not be able to recover from for some time. Watch the forecasts and pay attention to http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/ Unless you believe that's all fake news of course."
"The performance after his death has come to me as a surprise, I expected a big sell off and it has done well since, hope the stock stays solid."
4-21-21 11:30 AM ESTI'm having a difficult time understanding the SP action regarding new 52 week highs. Could it partially be related to the recent buy-out attempts of other railroads?Don't get me wrong ….. I like the SP action …. but it poses a difficult problem for me and that revolves around the fact that I”m a long time holder of 4000 shares of CSX with a cost basis of $18.15 and it's becoming too large a position in my unsheltered portfolio.What to do???? Sell some and send a boatload of money to various governments to waste ….. or keep holding until I think CSX may have topped ….. which may be a year away.At this point …... I think I'll wait.
"CSX is the cheapest railroad stock out there with a free cash flow yield of 5.5% which is amazing compared to others that have a yield between 3% and 3.7%. The issue might be the coal exposure but I think it is unlikely coal traffic will ever go to zero, so the market might be overreacting. https://svencarlin.com/csx-stock-analysis/"
"CSX went up over 4% today with volume over twice normal. I did not see any news that would cause this. Is some one big like a hedge fund, privet equity group , or a larger railroad buying up shares in the market?"
thoughts on the pan am deal????
It's sad for Mr. Harrison's family. Over-reacted market created a dream opportunity for us
I'm a huge fan of financial engineering (share buybacks) -- the #1 expected goodie in the latest tax package (freeing up cash). CSX has been doing that regularly and has more in the pipeline.
"Carl, thanks for the advice of watching CSX's stock price dropping UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Dear CSX...….. Is it not time to address dividend ???
"Carl, can you explain whats going on here??? This is supposed to go down isn't it? Why oh why am I making lots of money on this POS stock??? No - keep the IRS away from me!!!"
"I don’t understand this company, at all... they’re profitable yet unsure how to forecast going forward."
"You can't build another railroad in this country, so you are getting this one on sale today."
"this must have almost zero short interest, it moves up alot on very little volume. interesting to see the gains with such tiny volume"
Heading to $80 tomorrow
with the stock split what does that mean with my stock?
"01/21/2021 (MT Newswires) -- CSX (CSX) on Thursday reported Q4 EPS of $0.99, unchanged from a year ago. The result missed the $1.02 consensus estimate of analysts polled by Capital IQ.Revenue declined to $2.83 billion from $2.89 billion. That beat the projection of analysts polled by Capital IQ of $2.78 billion."
correction should take two to three session before share price settle if it will hold the 70 it will be good news its might bounce higher to about 73 them will drift side way until next report
"Week 30 volume carloads (Week compared to same week last year):CSX Merch. +3.0%, Coal +16.4%, Intermodal +2.4%, Total +4.4%, YTD -0.1%NSC Merch. +5.7%, Coal +0.6%, Intermodal +6.7%, Total +5.0%, YTD +4.8%"
