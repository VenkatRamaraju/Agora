"Is there any calculation or formula behind this price dropping ? Totally gone and no idea how long it will take to recover, my cost is 0.31 !!!! And have huge numbers of share . Please share your thoughts and experience if anyone have in this regard !"
Lot of ppl lost money on this company but new investors are always popping up I guess.
The authorities of the TSX must stand with minority share holders and must take strong action against this rollercoaster merge by the corporate fraud. Many voiceless lost their hard earned dollar. This is unlawful and cruel injustice. where are the so called TSX regulators. Must file cause action litigation

IT'S LMNL'S TURN 25+OR 50+not much shares in the market
I see this closing at 3.40
Here we go...P
April 18 if approved will be the beginning of strong upward movement we have all been waiting for
How many billion shares will there be after refinancing? I think we are going down to 1.5 cents. Then a reverse split will occur so that we remain listed on the TSX. Then we go down further...If shareholders were allowed to vote I would turn this plan down. I would prefer seeing the company sold for 25 cents a share.
"We need to be patient just a little longer. Once approval comes in April, this Stock will be on everyone’s radar as a possible acquisition . Five dollars will come this year!"
Should I buy this under $3.00? Will it bounce?

"Large lawsuit filed against Liminal for some $700,000,000See EDGAR in the US where Liminal filed the SEC Form -20 as required by US law. In it they disclose the major lawsuit filed by many Plaintiffs in a joint action against Liminal anf many other co defendaents. See https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1351172/000156459021015134/lmnl-20f_20201231.htm at page 131 in the report filed. Here is the relevant quote:""Legal ProceedingsWe are, in the course of our business, subject to lawsuits and other claims. On April 15, 2019, we announced our intention to enter into a series of related arrangements to restructure its outstanding indebtedness, reduce our interest and certain other payment obligations, and raise sufficient cash to build a robust balance-sheet for the next phase of our development (collectively, the “Refinancing Transactions”), which included (i) an offering of Common Shares, (ii) the conversion of approximately $229 million of the outstanding debt into Common Shares, (iii) the adjustment of the terms of certain outstanding warrants and (iv) a rights offering to all shareholders whereby each shareholder received one right for each Common Share held, with each right entitling the holder thereof to subscribe for 20 Common Shares for aggregate proceeds of up to $75 million.On March 2, 2021, we were served with an action instituted by multiple individual shareholder plaintiffs (the “Plaintiffs”) against the Company, Structured Alpha LP (“SALP”), Thomvest Asset Management (“Thomvest”), Consonance Capital Management LP (“Consonance”), as well as the directors (the “Directors”) that were on the Company’s Board on March 31, 2019 or on April 15, 2019 and certain officers of the Company (the “D&Os”, together with Liminal, SALP, Thomvest and Consonance, the “Defendants”).The Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that, as part of the Refinancing Transactions, the Defendants (i) undervalued certain products, (ii) reduced certain of their operational activities, (iii) artificially devalued certain assets in order for them to be written off the balance sheet, (iv) conducted their business in a manner that prevented them from obtaining financing from certain parties and (v) never properly disclosed their financial difficulties, the alleged collective result of which was, among other things, that SALP and Thomvest were able to take control of the Company to the detriment of the minority shareholders.The Plaintiffs seek almost $700 million in damages, approximately $664 million of which is based on the loss of future value of our shares. The Company believes that the Plaintiffs’ claims are completely without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself. Defence and settlement costs associated with such lawsuits and claims can be substantial, even when these lawsuits and claims have no merit. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal proceeding could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operating results or financial performance."""

"The average volume up to June never exceeded 10,000. Now LMNL has an average volume of 966,000. When a stock goes from not having the least significance, to increasing its average volume strongly, investors are beginning to give it importance. In addition, its price is in the lowest possible position of its historical price. June 5, 2021 is a very relevant date, and there are many months left. If the volume increases, there may be significant upward speculative movements (and then strong corrections), but larger falls cannot be ruled out, as this is what this company has basically demonstrated throughout its history. But as I said before, the probability of it happening is lower, because the volume has grown, and a major bank recently recommends buying at $ 20 as the target price. Don't put in a lot of money. Typical stock that either subtracts 70% or gives you 500%. That is why you have to put little. My bet is that it will exceed $10, but I don't know when, and I'm in no rush."
I suggest that it might be time to let Dr Laurin GO as well as at least one half of the directors. They keep on making promises which are never realized. With so many shares outstanding how can any reasonable person think that this stock can ever recover the lost capital and they will have to come back to the market and issue more stock thus furthering the dilution. I suggest that they try to sell whatever is marketable and distribute the proceeds before they burn any cash left in the kitty. Dr Laurin could you explain to the shareholders how and what you can turn the fortune of this corporation around. I have been a shareholder almost from the beginning and lately I see nothing but empty promises and cash burning without any tangible results. Please tell me when will the bleeding stop. By their own admission the possible number of patiants who will benefit from the successful completion of their research is small so what will be the price that will have to be charged to each patient and will be able to afford the medication so that the corporation can show some profit? PLI does not have the resources to carry on with Dr Laurin dream. So I suggest that we let someone else run the ship. What were the reasons why an important shareholder decided to no longer support PLI?
LOW FLOAT -. BUY IT UP. ITS GONNA ROCKET

I am thinking this Friday will be 0.015 cent on the market no one need to buy the offered right shares then they read don't have enough money to run for year .then?????
Why did the stock lost so much value in a matter of a week? was the sale a bad move?
Liminal Biosciences is up 11.27% to 4.64
I would not be surprised at all if this thing grows rapidly by end of year. Price now is seeming to be basement entry level.
how's can I buy back shares at 0.015 cent a share
"Conference call is scheduled for 11 AM today, I will be joining in and I will update."
small float of 8 million! this can fly
I said 22 days ago 'Another 6 to 9 months and this corporation will close the door'. I got 4 thumps down with nothing supporting it. I said that cash flow is a real problem and unfortunately I dont see them gettting the additional cash needed to support them. I maintain what I said.
What is the ticker symbol? I cant sell my shares

"STRONG BUY TGARGET , - UNBELIVABLE"
wow
What is happening??
is the 66% insider ownership still true?
I still don’t know why they valued the company this low. Why not offer 1 shares for 15 cents and if the management is confident in their ability to generate positive cash from operations why not keep debt. Why they want to be debt free..... perhaps because they think they will not generate any positive cash flow for next couple of years
As I said previously they need a buyer with good governance and managment skills ans quick.
anyone going to average down. any idea because i want to
With this deal the cash value itself should be 4.5. We should see 6 soon.

"This situation is not about risk management or even about losses.It's about how the proposed refinancing, in my opinion, acts in bad faith towards the non-SALP shareholders.What I mean by acting in bad faith is that: non-SALP shareholders are to take all the downside of the 'financial hardship' that was, arguably, not of their making; and are to be given little to no chance to 'benefit in any future success.'These are the very shareholders whose investments make any 'future success' at all possible."
I called Investor Rekations and some one answered saying Tim Hortons how can I help you ?I asked where did Minimal Bioscience go ? He directed me to an old airfield 100km outside of Laval .

I bought LML at 4:20! And now look where it is! My other stuff that hasn't popped yet is GERN. check it out. It was actually on the gurney message board that I heard about LMNL and bought it.
"I also thought this would be a good bet and went down with the ship. I don't believe the rights will help us. Too much water under the bridge to trust anything now. Wait until the restructuring (split at around 1000:1 is done and if the stock is then traded somewhere...Then take a look. I still think the science is excellent but the business of getting the science to market leaves something to be desired. Every company I have seen do a reverse split went down in value afterward. Doesn't say it will happen this time, but history does tend to repeat itself. Good luck to us all!"
$LMNL will open 100 percent plus up on Monday and close the day at least 200 percent up

Liminal BioSciences is up 14.34% to 3.27
"10 questions to consider?1. If their potential pipeline of products is worth billions why would SRAM back out of such a potential lucrative partnership deal.2. If their potential pipeline of products is worth billions why were they unable to secure another partnership deal or secure additional financing or god forbid a direct offering to existing shareholders?3. Why did they feel the need to submit their application for a TSX financial hardship over a holiday weekend?4. Why and for exactly what purpose did they need to do a name change?5. Does Thomvest really need this to actually suceed in order to make bank? Was not a lot of money raked in by hyping Prometic to raise the sp and then shorting it on the backside?6. If this is such a wonderful investment opportunity worth billions how many insiders have actually purchased shares on the public market? How much of their own skin do they have in the game and what is the actual percent of inside ownership?7. Is this a legitimate investment opportunity or a speculative gamble? Would you bet your life savings or the family farm on this? 8. What would prevent them from pulling the literal rug out from everyone by going private later down the road given their majority stake then rinse, wash, repeat and hey it is not like they have shown any legitimate concern for shareholders and history shows plenty of companies that have jumped to the big board only to become a delisted carcass shortly thereafter?9. What actual real value have they created for shareholders to date? 10. It boils down to what do you want to believe? The check is in the mail, It's only a cold sore, We are from Thomvest and we are here to help, A partnership deal and approval is forthcoming."

"Given my below comment, the companies action are telling! Where is the Co's PR or CEO SP support statement?"
"The Rights will be awarded to shareholders using a Date of Record. If the Date of Record is before the financing/conversion, there will be about 750 million shares fighting for 15 billion shares at 20 for 1. Since this is capped at 5 billion, if fully subscribed you will only get 6.67 shares for $0.01521 for each share you now own. This will seriously bring down your average cost, but I doubt it will be this way.Very likely the Date of Record will be after the $75 million financing to The Thompson Family and Constenance, which means there will be almost 6 Billion shares outstanding. All of those shares will mean Rights of 120 billion shares, to be fighting for the 5 billion Cap from the Rights, meaning the most you will get is about 0.82 shares for each one you have now. Peanuts.The Date of Record might even be after the Debt conversion, which means there will be 20 billion shares or 400 billion, fighting for the 5 billion from Rights, which means you will only get 0.25 shares for each one you now hold.The Date of Record is the key, and very likely it will be a date that is worst for current shareholders. You can bet on it. No way are they going to let you buy 20 for $0.01521 each, for each share u now hold.In others words, you are all plucked!"

"LMNL had a market cap of over $688 million in July last year. At $5.50.share it has a market cap of just over $165 million. They might raise cash near term, but I believe the company now has an even strong potential to be bought given their one FDA approval and current multi drug pipeline in clinical trials. Large pharma is taking advantage of still low interest rate window to grow through M&A."

At this price level I am really bullish...My average is 4.08 and I am honest that I didn´t expect that it drops that much and that we see a new all-time low which is also a result of the selling pressure so many small bio companies face these days.But we should see some nice catalysts in the near future:- good earnings on 15th of August due to the sale of plasma derived therapeutics and the 70 mill they receive because of Ryplazim. And also consider the 15 mill they got because of the sale of plasma-derived manucaturing facility.- many shares of the float are actually shorted so any good news can push a lot of pressure on the short sellers if they try to cover (low free float of 10 mill shares)- start of a trial 2 in England for Fezagepras as Liminal is analyzing the data of the trial 1 and mentioned that there were no side and averse affects- very promising pre-clinical pipeline of the small molecule facility (IND + start of phase 1 trials)
Gamma SQueeze coming 78% short interest src: Fintel!! 105mil vouchers are not a misprint BUT a literal FACT!!!
