"Looks like delisting territory next month, sad and pathetic leadership to take something to market and blowchunks with impotent R&D investments. Just gaslighting investors, and filling pockets of executives with overpriced salaries."
No takers at the bottom
Big after hours plop eroo .
"Hi guys new here, can anyone explain to me how the market cap can be pretty much equal to the recent sale of £105m?"

Showing signs of life. May be it is time to add some while it is still low.
Why did the stock lost so much value in a matter of a week? was the sale a bad move?
Low volume move. Will it continue?

It is called scam.
In theory it should gap up and go to 5+. But that isn’t happening. Why? Manipulation? Shorts? What else?

With this deal the cash value itself should be 4.5. We should see 6 soon.
What bozo paid 2.72 yesterday
The rising tide in biotech sector should lift us. Add at these levels.
Look at the stock price in 2016. It was $2750! Look at those huge drops bringing it down to $1.80 today! Must have reverse splits after reverse splits. How is such a company allowed to even operate! What do those employees do?
Should I buy this under $3.00? Will it bounce?
"This is going to be epic, this one deal greater than the whole market cap was lol"
Just based on the news and stock price math should be at least 5.85min!!! let’s get it fam!

"new buy rating for this beated beauty! One of the few small biotech companies with FDA approved drug! And so many nice catalysts on the horizon:- receipt of the 75 mill from the voucher sale - they inform us what they will do with the money- Fezagepras Phase 1 data full analyse - possible indications - expected news this year- INDs for Oxer1 and GPR84 - and we know what covid is about and and in which areas LMNL is specialized don´t we - also expeced news this year- next earnings Q3 will be awesome...positive EPS forecasted- this is definitely a potential buyout-candidate...maybe we also get news about funding, collaborations etc...and LMNL is after the FDA approval a known player in the segment of bio-stocksAnd we should not forget that this stock got shorted to the bone in the last three months...When it spiked two times during this period more than 20 mill shares were sold short. I am in with a huge position and I am very confident don´t care what bears say!"

"(the “Common Shares”), on the basis of a consolidation ratio to be selected by the Board within a range between seven hundred fifty (750) pre-consolidation Common Shares for one (1) post-consolidation Common Share and one thousand two hundred fifty (1250) pre-consolidation Common Shares for one (1) post-consolidation Common Share (the “Share Consolidation”),wow !!!!"
"Is there any calculation or formula behind this price dropping ? Totally gone and no idea how long it will take to recover, my cost is 0.31 !!!! And have huge numbers of share . Please share your thoughts and experience if anyone have in this regard !"
Does anybody have info about the results of ER? Calendar said it was gonna be held today after market close.
"LMNL had a market cap of over $688 million in July last year. At $5.50.share it has a market cap of just over $165 million. They might raise cash near term, but I believe the company now has an even strong potential to be bought given their one FDA approval and current multi drug pipeline in clinical trials. Large pharma is taking advantage of still low interest rate window to grow through M&A."
I love it . Management own 66 per cent . For once they have empathy with fellow bagholders
