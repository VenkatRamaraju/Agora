What will Argus research do now with the stock price above 5? Raise the target? Where is the value of that research?
This on is a No Brainer long term beautiful hotel !!! I Book my next road trip.in a Hilton 
Here we go! Optimism is coming back. Humans are going to survive this virus.
I’m convinced this is the last chance to buy in before this skyrockets. There is 4 different antibody tests suggesting that the Amount of people infected is many multiples higher and Being asymptomatic. That will bring the expected death rate down to way below 1% and the country will reopen very soon
"PK had a good day today along with all coronavirus recovery stocks like airlines. I am curious if we will see the $8’s like several bears on here were predicting. I have a limit buy order in for more shares at lowball $8, just in case they are right in the next month."
Could there be another pullback or May 14 was the final shakeout ?
"I like SPG but I like this more. Nevertheless, the hospitality sector took a small hit today. Might be an optimal chance to wire in tomorrow."
"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/did-hedge-funds-call-park-145217552.htmlA bit disappointed to see Pk isn’t moving with market today, but most travel stocks are down today; I guess we need more positive news on Covid19 Vaccine.Btw, found an interesting article."
should be back to $20 soon..Great company with great dividends
"The people buying for the long hold will join me in the cigar lounge while we laugh, drink Johnny blue label, Cuban cigars, talk about big gains."
"There are lots of trapped shorts posting on this board who didn't anticipate the vaccine news last week. They saw the selloff on the day following the news and thought hotels were going back to down to close the gap caused by the vaccine news....they didn't anticipate this 2nd rally on Friday, and now they are stuck, and resorting to bashing hotel stocks on yahoo message boards. Best to ignore them."
"Added another 200 today. You’ve got to believe in the company at these prices. If you were will to buy at higher prices, and the business model is still sound, why would you have an issue buying more now? This is a short term hiccup with real long term upside."
"My opinion is yes, the hotel has been steadily under performing since 2018. Downward spiral. However when we open up the economy very soon people will be itching to go out and stay at a nice property. This managements portfolio is outstanding for any type of traveler, business, leisure, family, you name it and the Hotel brand can accommodate. In fact this particular group may even outperform their peers and do better than post 2017. Just a thought."
"Just in, five hours ago (7 PM, EST), ""University of Pittsburgh scientists discover antibody that 'neutralizes' virus that causes coronavirus Scientists at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine have isolated the biomolecule."" Source, https://www.foxnews.com/health/university-pittsburgh-antibody-neutralizes-coronavirus. This sounds great and if true, and should help many people by allowing them to be able to travel and in the long run, PK should benefit from this breaking news. PK, $12, $14 soon???"
"Looked at the SEC Form 4 Database for Park Hotels & Resorts. Jill Olander, VP purchased at the lowest pps so far $9.217 on 03/12/2020. So, what state are most their hotels in? Some states are looking into stay-at-home orders going until the end of May 2020. Could cause further pps decline?"
"@Pacer 2001 - not true. For every seller there's a buyer. Buyers don't want the stock at the price sellers are asking (HaHa!!). @Willei - I think the reason the stock is heading down is that AFTER the earnings call, management announced that their forward guidance is being reduced. They COULD have said that during the call (I'm sure they knew it 24 hours prior to their announcement) but chose not to. Institutional investors hate it when management surprises them. Because the down volume since the guidance announcement wasn't much greater than average volume makes me think the selling isn't over yet."
"Any ideas why Bill Ackman sold all his Pk shares at 11? he had bought at 7, seems strange not to hold on for longer, not much more upside in near term maybe? risks associated with hotel/travel industry? what's your thoughts guys?"
Next week $7.50 it looks like

"I have just driven from Boston to Niagra Falls, then to the Upper Penninsula of Michigan, aross Wisconsin and Minnesota...thru the Badlands, Mt. Rushmore, Yelowstone, Big Sky Montana, down to Salt Lake City, Provo. Las Vegas, and now in Zion. I have done over 5000 miles (at like 85mph the whole way) and I stayed exclussively in Marriotts and Hiltons...and they are Packed FULL. I have been told at each hotel they have been full since mid May. Folks, the hotels are coming back to life and PK is going to double by December. People insist on vacations and travel. Everyone is wearing masks which is a good thing. Gasoline is cheap. Hotels are reasonable."
"Everyone expect a bad ER... no surprisedoesnt change anything for longs. HOLD. Patience is key, it will rise in few months"
"Insider just purchases 10,000 shares. That should help inspire some confidence into the weak backdrop for PK recently."
this will very likely double within next year. just be patient and hold..
"Unfortunately, the corona virus is going to effect PK's results this year, IMHO. I live near Yellowstone NP and the Chinese/Asian tour business is already down 25%-30% heading into the summer. Basically very few Chinese tourists will be visiting this year (we do get a lot!). Since PK has hotels around the U.S that Asian tourists would be booking, if those bookings are down anything like the Yellowstone tour operators, PK may struggle for the next few quarters. Maybe management will address this on the call."
They had some interesting insights about PK on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Earnings out...CEO comment from earnings release:Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “I am proud of the focused and proactive efforts of the Park team and our operating and lending partners during this quarter as we worked together to respond to the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our business. In addition to suspending operations at over half of the hotels in our portfolio in March, and consolidating operations at hotels that remain open, we proactively drew our $1 billion Revolver prior to the end of the quarter, giving us considerable financial flexibility to weather this extremely challenging operating environment. With our portfolio currently operating with only 15% of our rooms available, we have reduced hotel operating expenses by approximately 75% at the current occupancy levels and reduced our 2020 capex budget by approximately 75%. Additionally, last week, we amended our credit and term loan facilities to waive certain debt covenants through and including March 31, 2021 and extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility to December 2021. We received a unanimous vote from the syndicate of banks on the extension, highlighting the strong partnership and support we enjoy with our bank group. Our management team has managed several disruptive events throughout our careers, including natural disasters, 9/11 and the Great Recession. With $1.2 billion in current liquidity and a cash burn rate of $70 million per month in an extreme situation with all operations suspended, Park is well positioned to navigate the disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic.”"
"People are scared their earnings will push it down a lot because there is no earnings. However for the long term hold, this is a money maker."
Dividend SUSPENDED through rest of 2020 - Wall Street Journal
"Seeking Alpha 4/23/21 article has fair value at $31.89 which is encouraging for longs written by a CFA. Keys will be increased volume in HI, overall group business travel, and San Fran. Patient investors welcome"
lot of hotel and REIT stocks went up today. I bet tech stocks got dumped and these got bought.
The Normal life and Business & Leisure Travel will come back; People will go out Shopping againWe will all at least triple our money at that point. $PK $SVC $SABR $SPG
"This is the one to own. I live near San Francisco. Absolutely premier hotels, same with their NYC and Hawaiian hotels. Remember, in normal times, this stock was trading in the 20s with a 9% dividend."
We saw it coming. Second wave is here. Dont panic just hold. PK will fly once this pandemic is over
"Caught this too late. Hoping this drops to $5 again, I’ll be in then!"
"bought more today, so this past week I visited a beach and a mountain town. They are both popular vacation locations. To my delight I had a problem getting a room. Most of the hotels were booked solid for the weekend. The traffic was heavy also. JMHO"
"Impressed with CEO on Q/A on conference call. Tidbits include: NAV is at $27, will create tremendous value for shareholders, looking at adding a tower to Hilton Hawaiian Village complex, they waited to sell assets to deliver value back to the bal sheet, mandating staff is vaccinated, and “Leaders have to lead”. Well done"
My only regret was not buying WAY MORE when it was under 9
"Does anyone know when PK is expected to pay dividend? I saw ex date was 3/31/21, but I have not seen anything other than that date."
Shorts are piling into PK at these levels. Short Interest up 44% as of April 15th from March to over 13M shares sold short. https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PK?mod=quote_search
"I feel like this is going to be an amazing company to own over the long term based on this price regardless of what the numbers are tomorrow. I think when this is over, a lot of us that skipped vacations this year will be itching to get away next year and we'll have that extra cash we saved by staying home this year. Also, even after this is behind us, I think people will be a little more apprehensive about staying in Air BNB's because they don't really know how much cleaning is done between guest stays. You feel a bit more confident about disinfecting between guest stays at higher end hotels."
Hotels filling back up. Easy double from here . Sit back and collect divvies until we get there. Youre welcome.
up 38% since I bought in
"@psight PK is a great value buy anywhere below $10. You see it right now with a little good news about Covid it will jump fast. They will reinstate the dividend once things are back kind of normal, I’m guessing Q1 2021."
The company should consider utilizing the various advanced smart security devices from AiTX for both greatly increased security and patron convenience and at the same time dramatically lower costs.
"Analysts estimate $245.37 million for the current fiscal quarter. Low 214M, High 278.98M"

"Hello, does anyone know what happens if PK declares bankrupcy? I would assume that properties would go into auction, then at first all debt will be covered, and if there is any $$$ left, it will be split in between shareholders. What am I missing here? Because with P/B ratio 0.27, I don't see any reason why not to buy this stock. Even if hotel properties drop 50%, there is still quite a huge value buffer."
"For those that bought at the low, great job! Not me :( but I'm staying long..way too cheap"
PK is being accumulated today by large investors. 2 Million-share trades went through. It's lunch time and already the volume is 2x daily average. This company has done everything right by mothballing their hotel chain and raising liquidity. After paying-off the recent dividend they have about $4/share in cash.
"Hello everyone, I'm a small Italian investor. In Italy there is little information about Park Hotel & Resort. Can any of you more experienced tell me what you think? What target price would you give to this stock? Thanks to those who want to answer me."
"I doubled my money at $18 so I decided to take my profits and exit. There may be more upside to go, but it will be an uncertain market and I am managing risk. Good luck to all staying long."
Who’s buying these dips? I bought a nice chunk today. Long term bullish
"Longleaf Partners commented on their position in PK:""Park saw its occupancy levels hit unprecedented lows due to travel reduction and conference cancellations as a result of COVID-19. Park responded by closing all or parts of the majority of its owned hotels. We have evaluated the company’s debt (the next maturity is $700 million at the end of 2021) and liquidity (about $1.4 billion) and believe it will survive the crisis. CEO Tom Baltimore purchased shares personally after the stock’s sharp decline but still well above where it trades. The stock was deeply discounted at quarter end, but our appraisal of the value has declined with the loss of cash-flow. As we said above, it is in the third bucket, and we did not add during the quarter. Park trades at an extremely wide discount to both relatively stable replacement cost (it trades at less than 20% of that metric) and a fast moving value, providing a large margin of safety at today’s low price."""
"really excited for the upcoming earnings.from what I know, we are very close to being even.the experts said 35 to 40% occupancy is needed to be even. the latest info I am aware of says they were in that range on 75% of their hotels. the numbers hopefully have gone up in occupancy and no of hotels open.hold and we will be rewarded people."
We moving on up. Who loaded more at $6 last week?
"Declaration of long-term persistence: I solemnly declare that I absolutely will not panic sell, even if PK continues to drop another 90%. I am ready to lose all the money in PK, but I won't panic sell a single share."
"BofA Merrill analyst actually downgraded to sell at the absolute bottom, nice work pal."
Can someone explain why it’s rise with such a not good news for hotels ?
"I am so relieved to hear them say that they have funds to last another 17 months. I don't know how things will unfold but vaccines will come out next year and things will normalize slowly. if you can accumulate, now is the time."
"When all the market is going down 4%-5% and this stock is up, that's a good sign"
Who is selling at these levels? They are not going out of business
Checked many of their portfolio hotels for same day reservations today and about 2/3 were booked albeit at likely lower room rate.
Why is a company with a multi billion market cap have a lo nav
Nice rise today thanks to the employment numbers with the hospitality sector one of the bright spots
Very good news last night they were able to take out a new loan maturing in 2028 and increased their credit facility by $75mm. Extra cushion to ride this pandemic out.
"I was nervous getting in but after reading the financials, especially book value, looks about as reasonably safe as one can hope for. The Mar 30 dividend brought my break even down a little ($6.49) and even though dividends have been paused, I'm very optimistic about PK.Anyone know if there has been any revenue for hosting health care workers, or similar? Revenue from atypical sources? Or essentially zero?"
"I been doing nothing but researching the financial aspects of stocks I'm interested in. I was not sure about PK for the last week but if you just ignore the no income part for a minute. JUST 1 OF THEIR TOP TIER PROPERTIES IS WORTH OVER A BILLION DOLLARS. Just on the property value alone, their shares should be around $20 each. Who agrees with me. Give thumbs up. Im putting a large portion of my savings on this long term hold."
PK Hotels needs to give Investors an update on the occupancy rate of their various Hotels . If it has Improved considerably since April/May ??
"Sweet just booked our family vacation to Orlando. Were staying at a resort. Currently the Hotel restaurants, bars, gym, Spa Etc are all closed. Called them yesterday before booking and they told us starting June 30th everything in the resort will be fully open. Great time to buy now"
Short term this is stressful to watch. Long term it’s a great buy.
"This is a long term buy. The question as usual is when is the right time to buy. It feels like it's pretty solid here and could go up with the hope of states starting to reopen. However, a second wave (or an increase of virus confirmations) will cause this to drop significantly. Best of luck, I purchased at $7.30 yesterday."
Anyone know when the next dividend payout is? Just bought in for some passive income.
"In 9 to 12 months from now, either a vaccine is found or the world learns how to live with this disease and get back to normal life. I’m healthcare provider and go to work everyday knowing that there is No vaccine for HIV & Hep C; but I wear my PPE and do my surgeries. Why? -because the world has learned to live with HIV & Hep C virus among us; same will happen to this virus if a vaccine is not found. Aside from its high rate of transmission this virus is not as deadly as many other microbes out there, plus it’s target audience is very predictable; individuals older than 65 and patients with underlying conditions. The solution is simple; isolate and protect and support the at risk population and let the rest of the society live with the virus and function normally with some added social distancing.$PK $SVC $SABR $SPG"
"Park Hotels & Resorts (NYSE:PK) was upgraded by analysts at Wells Fargo & Company from an ""underweight"" rating to an ""equal weight"" rating. They now have a $11.00 price target on the stock, up previously from $7.50. 2.3% upside from the current price of $10.75."
"Buy PK, DXC, NRZ, MRO, JBLU and hold for 3 years.....your portfolio will triple in value, plus you will have around an 9% annual dividend yield on cost. Thank me later."
"Just have a look at 13F filings for hedge funds that have over 100 million invested in PK to give you and idea of where they see this heading.I’m not saying it’s going to Rocket, but it’s a sold long term stock going forward."
It’s hotel assets are very high quality. This is the best hotel REIT imo. We all know this will be $30+ again one day. No brainer
"Insiders - including the CEO - bought 122,500 shares in March, 2020 - ranging in prices from 10.86 to 18.31. Most of those were Wednesday, March 11. See https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1617406.htm. For those of you underwater, maybe buy alongside the CEO (Thomas J Baltimore, 78K shares @ $12.52)?I'm thinking it looks good here under $9 (3.13.20)"
$18 in December
Pk is slowly working its way back up. Hotels are seeing people return. I will take 2% up a week.
This is one of the most volatile stocks in the market. In fact over the past several months the stock has doubled on two seperate occasions -March 18 Close - $4.67March 26 Close - $9.42 (6 trading days later)May 13 Close - $6.93June 8 Close - $14.88 (17 trading days later)Friday's closing price of $8.53 is the lowest it has been since the third week of May. It might continue to go lower but I see the risk/reward favorable at this point for gigantic returns in the short-term. Those with a large risk appetite might want to consider establishing a position over the next several days because I believe most of the pessimism has already been priced into the stock.
"When is the earnings announcement for this company? All the stats say May 6, but there is nothing on the website under investor relations."
I am buying tomorrow
PK 8.35 is way undervalue!you wont see under 9 next week.Institutions accumulated PK shares at 11am today.Insiders will buy sometime early next week and will push pk above 9.30when vaccine come out. This is $16/share
Nice couple of weeks for PK. I'm good with a few cents a day for the next year!
I already have 2/3 of my final position locked in in $SVC & $PKWill buy more at 5 or sell more at 25. Otherwise just holding what I have. Both have great potentials
I'm adding with a longer-term view...div will be lower but that is fine
"Wondering if someone smarter than me can explain the impact if the junk bond rumor is true?https://finance.yahoo.com/news/park-hotels-closes-500-million-174632673.htmlWe knew the numbers would be awful. We know the Q2 numbers will be worse. Anyone surprised shouldn't be trading. Big question is the entry points, and when will return to some normalcy (in revenue) happen. No one has that answer."
"Earnings announcement* for PK: May 11, 2020Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. is estimated to report earnings on 05/11/2020. The upcoming earnings date is derived from an algorithm based on a company's historical reporting dates. Our vendor, Zacks Investment Research, might revise this date in the future, once the company announces the actual earnings date. According to Zacks Investment Research, based on 4 analysts' forecasts, the consensus EPS forecast for the quarter is $0.36. The reported EPS for the same quarter last year was $0.67."
"Gonna average down here, long hold but it’ll be worth it!"
This should be $5 a share before I’d take a chance.... They’re too far away from ever seeing anything like the revenues of past years.... They may not even survive...Covid destroyed this company
It’s either going way up or way down but I’m holding on. Good luck everyone 
"My dad went on a road trip the other day, told me he couldn't get a hotel room they were booked solid! That was in a little town in Wisconsin, not a major resort or business area. Looks like hotels are reopening pandemic or not. Under 10 dollars for a stock like this is great value."
How is this falling so hard after analyst upgraded this
"Park Hotels' Q4'2019 book value on Yahoo finance is listed as $27.14. The stock price mrq (12.31.19) was $26 (price to b/v of 0.95).So... deducting 10% in book value for all the craziness of the last 2 weeks, that brings BV down to $24.46, and the stock is trading at $8.04 as I write. Would give it a new price to book of .3275. From today's high at $10.09 to the low of $7.75, the stock dropped 23%.Am I missing something here?Leverage doesn't seem extreme. The properties are legacy (former) Hilton Hotels in prime areas of US business centers (link below). Last kicker, as mentioned below, the CEO and directors have been buying shares on the open market for 2 weeks at prices between $10.86 and $18.31, far above the current price. See:www.secform4.com/...Statistics - See: finance.yahoo.com/...Company's portfolio of properties - See: www.pkhotelsandresorts.com/..."

Not bad at all. Nice to see PK being teflon.
I’m with you Clyde. At 3 hotels in MO a couple weeks ago and they were completely full. Will be interesting to see how our portfolio performs in the short and long term.
"if drops further tomorrow I'm getting some shares here, my portfolio is way too heavy with bio stocksdo not expect if to fly, even if earnings are half positive, but I see this a safe-ish bet for mid/long termGLA"
Bought PK today.Yahoo shows 20% dividend yield. I am sure it's an old info. What is the current dividend (if there is one) ?Thank you.
out at 10.47...Cant keep waiting for ever. looks like as per conf this is going to start recevering only 2021 2nd half.THAT IS ..IF THE VACCINE WORKS
Two more insider BUYS in the beginning of June:https://www.secform4.com/insider-trading/1617406.htm
Great buying opportunity! Undervalued at this price. It will rebound back to over 18.00 per share soon.
"PK is a relatively simple story. When the news turns positive, the stock will quickly go up. Build up shares now mean a bigger reward later....."
PK is going to have a monster run in September !!!
This will pass . PK will be back at 30 . Easy money folks . Just buy and walk away
Has to be computers selling this. Nobody rational selling this when book value three times share price
"I checked on occupancy rates for over 20 Marriott hotels near Boston, and they are like full full full. I realize this is Fall in New England and with all the color changes, but that suggests that covid is better understood and people are willing to take precautions and still go to hotels and travel. The holidays are soon here and I bet this becomes common place as we get so much closer to a covid vaccine. I think pk will double by December and New Years and be back in the 40's by spring 2021. This and cruise lines are going to be good long term bets."
"could be a take-over for $50 per share....maybe Sternlich who buys quality and value...This is the best Hotel portfolio trading...As SPG is buying TCO, high quality centers . Quality and value being thrown out with bathwater!!"
so good to see some numbers.I am here to stay.some promising info: end of june hotels open 22 as of August 5 that is now 37I am less scared and more hopeful that this will be a money maker for me by end of this year or beginning next year.
Panic sale. Tomorrow back over 20$. Pick up some cheep stock.
Not much chatter on this board. I’d recommend looking at the March investor presentation which is very well done. Not all hotels open and they have been making many management decisions which make this company nimble and always looking forward for investors
$28 coming next
Stock remains in a tight range for 3 months between $7 and $9.50 with occasional spikes above. It is right at the midpoint now. See: https://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/advchart/frames/frames.asp?show=&insttype=&symb=pk&x=50&y=12&time=5&startdate=1%2F4%2F1999&enddate=5%2F4%2F2020&freq=1&compidx=aaaaa%3A0&comptemptext=&comp=none&ma=0&maval=9&uf=32&lf=32&lf2=0&lf3=0&type=2&style=320&size=4&timeFrameToggle=false&compareToToggle=false&indicatorsToggle=false&chartStyleToggle=false&state=11
This will go up significantly by July.
nice PK is sticking to their dividend plan! buy now if you want in on the next pay day
I would feel more comfortable buying if they halted the dividend until these issues subside. Paying out their dividend when the future is uncertain doesn’t seem like the most cautious approach. Any thoughts from the longs?
"Picked up some shares @ $4.90, I understand that travel industries won't pick up soon, but hope it's a good buy!"
This is a great stock for the long term. The current price is below book value. I Just bought 1500 shares.
Earnings report coming up mid july
"PK has 1.3 Billion to help get them through covid. I'm a little worried about Hawaii, but in August you can take a covid test and you can fly to Hawaii and not have to self quarantine. It seems as long as they don't go bankrupt this is a steal. I guess that's the 2.3 Billion dollar question. Some of the most expensive properties in the world can now be bought for 2.3 Billion. It seems like a nice long term bet that PK will get through this and be worth a lot more 3 years from now."
"Man, who is buying PK here at $24?!? Still burning thru $42M a month and probably won't be reinstating the divvy until 2023 now, and that will be at a low level. I like PK, but I sold my position here, which was acquired last spring/summer and more than doubled my money. We're at pre-COVID levels now when PK was paying $1.80, now its $0.00. Moved the funds into other REITs that are paying divvies, like WPC. Thanks PK, it was a great ride!"
"There were few interesting things on the earnings release.1. They are opening 20 more hotels that were closed and in total 53% of there's room would be available.2. They delayed all mortgage and loan payments until 31.3.21 with an option to delay it to 31.12.21 which is the most important thing.3.imporving the cash burn rate in a worst case when all hotels are closed to 65 million per month, which means 24 month of 0 income and still able to keep the head above the water.The numbers were ugly no doubt about it, but every investor that is holding the stock for more then 2 month now knew that already. So it's all comes to in what discount you bought the stock and when there will be a vaccine that will boost the stock to 16-18 easy.."
all depends on delta
"The best portfolio of Class A properties of any real estate hotel company in America. This is so overlooked by Wall Street...they dont understand real estate and never will! Value of PK hotels if sold is probable 3X present stock price. See profits on its recent sale of a few ""non-core"" hotels...WOW!!!"
PK Book value $23.66 per share.....probably worth even more to a synergistic buyer.
"I have 75+ stocks in our Roth portfolio. Every bit of research...pps history, BV, overall financial stats, etc. says this is by far the best bargain I own."
"Record high employment levels and shut down for unforeseeable duration. The stocks skyrocket. Finally we are opening up the economy, then every stock tanks hard."
Bought back in today and will add tomorrow. Bill Ackmann put the bottom in.
This stock will be in single digits when the vaccine hype fails.
"I jumped in, boys and girls. Dipping in the water with 500 shares at 9.93. We shall see if we can go back up to $15 by Christmas!"
"Said it before I’ll say it again, have patience for low 8s! If u get in 7,8,9,10 it’s all the same when you get to 25 soon. But if your like me with a lot to play the cents matter!"
"They say they dont have funds to last 17 months but1) I think we will have treatment by then, if not, then every other business will also fail and we will be in a super great depression. 2) They can easily sell any one of their 60 properties to get money to last few more months."
"Don't lose sight of the fact that the stock will move well before the travel industry has recovered. Vaccines will be approved in the next 6 months but investors will realize this will happen before it does. Trump wants one or more approved before the election, so may make sure one of more received emergency use authorization before Phase 3 trial is completed. As investors begin to see better days ahead, they will start buying briskly."
Good buying Op.. looks like a gift... if it goes down further or trends back up .. a gift...
I’m sticking with this one Iv added more today
"Not a lot of chatter in here...PK is not the most volatile stock and people are not flocking over here. One question for those that are invested here, is it at the bottom now? last month it got into the high $3's and I was hesitant, but looking back I should have went in!"
guys serious advice requireddo I buy tomorrow or wait till Thursday (after earnings)
"Definitely a unique opportunity to accumulate for both short and long term gains. Financially, they’re fine and BV is extraordinarily higher. And the $8.70 pps hit last Friday indicates a LOT of buyer interest."
"Seriously, who is selling? Even if the US real estate market is down by 30%, PK net value is 1.5 time its current market cap (after debt, liabilities, AND additional 6 months of losing money....). Just do the math. Who ever is selling now, is betting either on a complete shut down of the us. economy for the next 12-months or a decline >50% in US real estate market. That's just unreasonable."
nice to know that profitability for parks hotel is from 35 to 40% occupancy. also nice to know that 78% of parks hotels opened as of latest info. also glad to hear that hedge funds sold almost 100 million dollars worth of stock last quarter.= hold people and things should start going up nicely once the vaccines start becoming available.
It will recover...just be patient guys...great stock to hold
Worst case scenario this stock falls back to $15-16 due to rising Covid cases and both low corporate and leisure demand. Best thing to do would be to DCA.
Bought 1500 shares today. The price is below book value & headed higher. I plan to hold long term.
"Monday May 11. before the market opens, will be the Q1 earnings call. That's gutsy."
Started a position this afternoon at $8.56. Small bites.
"Guys we’re still down over 50% since March... Hotels, airlines, $BA, $PK are on the runway for take off. America wants her freedom!"
"$aht great earnings report, next one will be stellar! Fully booked, ended parasitic deal with Ashford Hospitality Inc, many preferred shares converted, occupancy at all time highs so can charge highest prices. Up, up, up! Rated buy with price target $4 by both https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/aht/analyst-research & https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/aht/forecast AHT market cap 224m with 508m revenue, pk market cap 5B with 830m revenue. Aht screaming buy esp with vaccines.$pk $ht $drh $sho"
100% out after yesterday. Will buy in slowly or buy a dip.
"The typical summer vacation destinations are recently sold out- every week, the businesses are going to b more open than the previous week. Translation, this stock is ONLY GOING UP from here. I would b very surprised if the SP is not over $12 by June 15th.. Very bullish, short and long term."
"Im bullish on this stock but based on all the company stocks I watch every day of my life, the stocks always fall when they release earnings report for the dates during the shut down. Its one thing to expect bad earnings but its another to see it on paper. I will load up after the big dip."
added another 680 to my position @10.05! still at a cost basis around $9
"The rest of 2020 is shot, and 2021 will be slow in Jan/Feb, revisit this in March but the outlook is grim..."
Between $pk and $svc what should the allocation be ? I think Pk is safer ?
If this goes back to below 6... I’m buying as much as I can
"-.75c vs ext of -.86c - Better than expected$1.6B in cashIt will be a rough ride, but brighter days are ahead."
"The COVID-19 issues have been rough on this sector but it appears that there are some key factors that will help reduce the effects of COVID-19. That said, this Company had a great market cap last year of $5 to $6 billion with current debt of $5.4 billion, cash on the books of $1.3 billion. PK has been granted a reprieve to pay mortgage rates. The mean average of this stock is at $28, so at a current price $8 to $9, it certainly appears that this stock should go back to its mean with in 4 to 6 Months. This is pending on the COVID-19 issues, but current UVC sanitation and disinfection protocols will enable this sector to be productive.So it appears to be a BUY even if the stock runs up to $16 which is still have the average mean.Bottom line, people are wanting to get out of their caves and travel to see friends, family and just get out of their current stay home situation."
One year anniversary of buying PK 4/1/2020 !!! Congrats to longs that are still holding on this rollercoaster !!! Just waiting on REIT Dividends to be reinstated...
"I bought at 7$ , what a bargain! I'm holding for over a year now and increasing my stake, once the divided comes back, this is gonna be my passive income. + they gonna flourish this summer and the share price will be around 22$ !"
Best resorts in America going to $18 by November.. Buy this dip with both hands 
Anything we can do about the spam on this page?
"Many of New York City’s biggest hotels closed their doors in March when the coronavirus wiped out tourism and business travel. The shutdowns were supposed to be temporary, but six months later, with no potential influx of visitors in sight, a wave of permanent closures has begun.Sinking under the weight of overdue mortgage payments and property taxes, some hotels have already shut down for good, and many others are struggling to survive.NY Times would notvss as low me yo copy entire article, but said several hotels in Manhattan do not plan to reopen (Times Square Hilton, 2 Courtyards by Marriott, as n Omni hotel, etc. If we can get back to quasi normal in the next year, the survivors will have less competition. I have a small position here and can’t really offer much re PK’s chances of survival. Maybe a few others here can chime in and comment."
Waiting for earnings to see if they will reinstate the dividends. Been holding for over a year @ $11.05
"Love this stock and it’s 60 beautiful hotels. Asset heavy, but interest rates are so low. Management did a great job preserving cash runway back to the economy opening up. Happy Valentines and GITA"
"Good run today, long PK for sure"
"I plan on holding on to what I have @10.01 and collect on dividends, whenever that may happen. Yay vaccine! I want my 20%/yr and double+ my moneys!"
Solid hold and accumulate on weakness from here. Very carefully. It is somewhat binary at this point. Does the economy recover in 18 months? Yes or No. I do not know.
"NATELLI THOMAS A, Director of Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. BOUGHT 20000 shares on 2020-06-15. https://formwhispers.com/s?t=PK"
Bought back in! 8.90. Seems like a phenomenal price.
"Have a long position here at 8, but added a larger short term position today to try and capitalize on Aztrazeneca phase 1 results being released monday, and then the Warp Speed Companies testifying before congress on Tuesday"
checked their HI website. Now its all sold out..Then why is the stock price flying down????
This is best travel value stock. Will go back to twenties when everything all clear and you can buy it 30 percent cheaper than the directors did and get a nice dividend
"As promised, opened a long position and i will constantly add below these levels."
"""Based on Park’s current liquidity of $1.2 billion and assuming the extreme scenario where all hotels suspend operations, Park currently has approximately 17 months of liquidity. This estimate does not take into account any possible alternative sources of revenue that may arise or payment of cash dividends or other distributions not already declared and paid in 2020, if any."""
Break-up worth a lot more than publicly traded valuation
Don’t understand who is selling at these levels. Assets are worth five times as much as share price
One of my favorite play in portofolio. I am long since 8s and I will see the 25s on the next 2-3 years & take advantage of the yield. Solid play  See you at Hilton near the Pool 
Invested with PK almost 2 months ago. Not alot of discussion on the board. With people beginning to travel what does everyone think is going to push PK back to 20 per share? Any predictions?
Glad I sold yesterday and took some profit. Didn't wanna get stuck like I did in june. I love this stock and will stay long. Just gonna let it go back down a little with the continued uncertainty in the market.
"Moderna (MRNA) announced that their phase 1 study for Covid-19 vaccine study and the results WERE GREAT!Its jumping 15% in AH. No, I ma not pumping MRNA, but this has huge ramifications on airlines, hotels and cruise stocks. All these sector stock are jumping in AH. I think PK is one of the best names in the hotel industry. Going up huge by the end of the year!!"
People need to realize those beautiful hotel will reopen sooner then later and will become much stronger  Buy & Hold
"Bad news put of the way. Vaccines coming soon. People are fed up not being able to travel and if the feds prevent people from traveling any longer, their will be huge protest. PK time to shine and start rising now."
Bought 2000 shares @8.36. Earnings better than expected. 0.75. Buy it or miss the train
what us the attraction of this stock? they have no short term positive outlook!
Is $9.50 the new bottom? Until more new comes out?
And of course my buying some was a signal to go down. Sorry about that! 
"You guys buy the blood?When people are greedy consider selling...When people are scared consider buying... A valid idea to consider especially while dealing important companies.... $BA. $PK. $JBLU $TESLA DyOr I’m bullish on PK. I’m looking into hotels and vacations next week.... I’m am probably not the only one!And by the way... EVERYONE should consider outing at least 1-10% of their portfolio in bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin...This an emerging asset class. Look at the data charts. You’re welcome.Not financial advice just what I am doing... actually I have 30% of my folio in cryptocurrency assets. Anyway. PK to $15 by next week most likely if Covid and media chill... while having good news. We shall see!"
"We are close to getting good news on Vaccine for Corona. 3 to 6 months at max per all the good news coming from differnt countries- front runners are India, US and UK. This will fly back to 30's soon."
I’m starting a position at 7.80
Pk has intrinsic real estate value that is at least 2X stock price. Similar to undervaluation of TCO that is elling to SPG for 2X its prior stock price....and the buy-out price is equal to a 6.9% cap rate on the beast small mall portfolio in USA. At a liquidation sale the average prices could have averaged 5.5%!!! PK is worth $50 pershare on a liquidation....so again Wall Street has no clue on how to value commercial real estate ....BUY FOR LONG TERM...the valuee will rise totop and get a great div while waiting.
"I have been buying in some amounts in the $7-9 range so I am break-even on this stock so far. Definitely trending down. Factors for successful mostly out of the control of this company. If the corona virus under control in the next year or so, this company will survive and the stock price will recover. If the corona virus still spreading in two years, this company is in trouble and may file for bankruptcy. The Feds providing a lot of liquidity to the markets and don't want companies going out of business so the big picture seems to indicate that this company will survive. Long term if the corona virus situation gets better in the next year, this will be winner with the understanding that you may lose most of your money if it doesn't. I am betting on a more optimistic outlook and looking to buy more under $8 and holding on for a while."
Yup. Accumulation. Hold a year for a double at least.
They have the cash to keep on going for 17 months. I’ll keep buying these dips. I’m long term bullish.
"The reason I want some kind of company news is I am curious how much it costs them to maintain their current deminimus business structure during this shutdown of most of their hotels. As stated previously, they have about $4.70/share in cash, no major debt payments for two years, and their credit line ($1 BL) only costs about ~$6.15ML/quarter. There are costs for maintaining the properties, hiring security firms to watch them, re-finance debt if need be. I would hope their general employees took advantage of the nice unemployment deal the CAREs act offers above state unemployment (xtra $2,400/mo through July). I estimate it to be about $4,200/mo total. They would not have a 2.64% coupon rate on their credit line if they were in any trouble. The mind-blower for this company is the value of the properties with their legacy hotels, which others here have highlighted.This is an aside, but why doesn't Macy's (M) start building apartment complexes or townhomes on all those amazing property locations they have? Good for those communities. Good for Macy's. They put up the land. Somebody else puts up the financing. And someone like Brookfield (BPY) builds it. There is a crying need for housing in the US and Macy's has amazing ACREAGE in highly-desirable areas because of their legacy investments in properties in the 1960s-90s."
"38% consolidated occupancy for the month of august is very impressive, doubt they reach precovid levels of RevPAR, EPS, etc... but there is definitely value here. Pretty safe buy, but I would not expect large growth in share price"
who keeps the stock through the worst time and then sell when they can only get better?the vacancy rate is going down and # of open hotels is going up. vaccines are coming in 2 or 3 months.
"""Beginning July 8, 2021, individuals fully vaccinated in the United States or its Territories may enter Hawaii on domestic flights without pre-travel testing/quarantine starting the 15th day after the completion of their vaccination. ""Should be very good for PK's two large hotels in Kona and Waikiki. And this is not just a summer play, but all the way into the Thanksgiving/Christmas holiday season. Selling extraneous hotels, nearing cash-flow positive, filling up hotels. PK at $19.16, (4.5 month lows)."
"The people will continue to travel , the people will need luxury and the best hotels!! Long term play !!"
Why PK is always in red while SVC is green? Aren’t they both hotels? Im planning to buy but can’t decide which one would be better for long term
PK Massively oversold and undervalued! JMHO
The best hotel stockAlready 20% upIn short timeSoon will reach 25$
"I just now saw this positive news: “Pershing Square said it built a position of almost 549,000 shares of Blackstone, according to a SEC filing. In addition, the billionaire’s portfolio disclosed a new position in Park Hotels & Resorts nc. (PK), in which it bought 678,000 shares, valued at about $5.4 million...”"
Any info on occupancy rates?
"Since PK was paying $0.45 per share to shareholders who owned on March 30th, the selling accelerated April 1st. We'll see what happens. Hold it, it's going to take a while to come back. My thought is by May 1st, USA economy will be coming back swinging, and this covid19 will just be a bad dream. I'm holding this gem. PITTSBURGH, Penn. (WTVO) — Researchers and scientists with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center announced a potential vaccine against the novel coronavirus on Thursday. Hydroxychloroquin is now a new hope also. Things are moving fast!!"
"Does anyone know of a good reason for this to be trading at 1/6 of its book value!? I understand that the coming months (maybe even year) won't be ""good times"" for the travel industry, but that seems to be doubly or triply ""priced in"" to this one."
"- More hotels gonna open with ""Covid Safety Standards"" - the public will be able to take a vacation while staying safe if they follow protocols.- Their Average Daily rate per room has increased on a month by month basis.- They expect to be almost 100% open till 2021 even with no vaccine due to being rated as a highly hygienic hotel company.- They will improve Rev per room and sell more stuff to people that come to have a great time after a long waited period that it took the hotel industry to fit itself to COVID."
My 2nd shot yesterday and ready to travel. Nice to see the sale in NO at a reasonable price knowing the market is coming back. Will be a great day when we are fully operational and generating positive cash flow
"Ever since $15, I think there is nowhere for PK to go, then it goes up another dollar.Tempted to sell but in this crazy market we could hit $20 in the blink of an eye.Pretty sure when earnings comes out for this quarter and next quarter the price will pause or rewind a little. There won't be much meaningful profits until 2nd half of 2021."

"And yes, picked up more on this dip. Will continue buying on weakness. I think revenues will be good this quarter, and next quarter dividend will be reinstated at maybe half of previous. Over the course of the next year, I think management works to get it back to previous levels. So yes, a buy."
94.5% effective covid vaccine from Moderna.dont get caught short..be patient in this stock.It will hit high teens within next 3 months when vaccines are being given throughout this country.
Hello anybody here. I just bot some Sept 10 calls on PK looks like it's going to breakout this week
Dow Future up 276 points.Could be a good week. $PK $SVC $SABR
Hotels are opening back up everywhere. People are starting to travel again. Will be back up to $10 soon
"Bought PK end of March and have not looked back, love PK and the new price target of $22 for December , then $32+ March 2021 and dividends of course...looks like a shorts nightmare..."
