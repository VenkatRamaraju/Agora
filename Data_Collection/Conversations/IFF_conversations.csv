Intl Flavors & Fragrances reached a 52 Week low at 103.76
Good buy around $104. Recent acquisition with too many small customers is questionable.
"Been researching and I realize this is all going to be first quarter 2021, but I'm only seeing this in regards to a price guess... More info:IFF (NYSE: IFF) (Euronext Paris: IFF) (TASE: IFF) and DuPont (NYSE: DD) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement for the merger of IFF and DuPont’s Nutrition & Biosciences (N&B) business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. The deal values the combined company at $45.4 billion on an enterprise value basis, reflecting a value of $26.2 billion for the N&B business based on IFF’s share price as of December 13, 2019. Under the terms of the agreement, which has been unanimously approved by both Boards of Directors, DuPont shareholders will own 55.4% of the shares of the new company and existing IFF shareholders will own 44.6%. Upon completion of the transaction, DuPont will receive a one-time $7.3 billion special cash payment, subject to certain adjustmentsAnyone in IFF/DD land have any thoughts on this? Real price? Buy- at what price?? Hold??"

He mentioned that the companies growth was primarily in food products flavoring them with whatever the manufacturer would want.Similar fragrances were also used in the manufacturing of candles.He told Cramer that this was the largest growth area currently and in years to come.

"I like iff but I can’t paly the options, no liquidity. Good luck longs......"
Does anyone know when in 2021 IFF will dilute shares to pay for the acquisition?
IFF is financially sound based on their audited annual reports. The acquisition was strategically intelligent and will be accretive to their bottom line while leaving behind an acceptable level of debt and a growing secure dividend. This price drop in the shares is an obvious opportunity for anyone who is versed in reading a balance sheet and an income statement. This one is easy. Buy it. Hold it. Next.
Sell
