"Sorry but need to get this off my chest. Option market on iff, almost a crime. As stock rallies put in an offer to sell and time value disminishes, even negative, 2 dollar on the stock in the money now position up 20cents. Fyi"
IFF is financially sound based on their audited annual reports. The acquisition was strategically intelligent and will be accretive to their bottom line while leaving behind an acceptable level of debt and a growing secure dividend. This price drop in the shares is an obvious opportunity for anyone who is versed in reading a balance sheet and an income statement. This one is easy. Buy it. Hold it. Next.

"Been researching and I realize this is all going to be first quarter 2021, but I'm only seeing this in regards to a price guess... More info:IFF (NYSE: IFF) (Euronext Paris: IFF) (TASE: IFF) and DuPont (NYSE: DD) today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement for the merger of IFF and DuPont’s Nutrition & Biosciences (N&B) business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. The deal values the combined company at $45.4 billion on an enterprise value basis, reflecting a value of $26.2 billion for the N&B business based on IFF’s share price as of December 13, 2019. Under the terms of the agreement, which has been unanimously approved by both Boards of Directors, DuPont shareholders will own 55.4% of the shares of the new company and existing IFF shareholders will own 44.6%. Upon completion of the transaction, DuPont will receive a one-time $7.3 billion special cash payment, subject to certain adjustmentsAnyone in IFF/DD land have any thoughts on this? Real price? Buy- at what price?? Hold??"
The IFF CEO was on Mad Money with Cramer a few months ago and was excited about their food Flavor and extract Manufacturing businesses which were growing rapidly and contributing dramatically to the bottom line. He mentioned that the companies growth was primarily in food products flavoring them with whatever the manufacturer would want.Similar fragrances were also used in the manufacturing of candles.He told Cramer that this was the largest growth area currently and in years to come.

"J0n here.The $7.2B acquisition works out to approximately $90/share. If IFF is overpaying by 10 or 20 percent, it's easy to see the current price decline, with even more downside. Some (most?) of that $7.2 is in stock, which itself is selling at a high multiple to book value, But there's little comfort in dilution if management doesn't get good value in exchange. This purchase is like a python swallowing a pig. The prey is not much smaller than the predator. Any comments on how that valuation stacks up? Or how long it will take IFF to see any positive contribution from this buyout?"

What do ya'll think the buy zone will be?

Doesn't it seem to others this is a company which as lost it's way. Huge move away from core business with the DuPont merger. Still reeling from the bizarre Frutarom con. Costs do not seem under control and it's not hard to see that hundred of people will go soon. So what is this company all about now looking through all the #$%$ and rhetoric. Will the perfume division be floated or simply sold?
