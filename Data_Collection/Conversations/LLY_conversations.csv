Some of the drop might be related to problems with the Biogen Alzheimer drug roll out
One of the few US companies that still has a pension and they pay your medicaresupplemental too.
"Not sure why the link to video that I shared below gets deleted! Its a talk b/w Dr. Jantz CSO & Co-Founder @PrecisionBioSci and Ruth Gimeno Vice President, Diabetes Research and Clinical Investigation @LillyPad / $LLY about their #geneediting collaboration & future. She answers ques like why Lilly chose $DTIL and how ARCUS will contribute to next gen medicines."
"Open a small position today for LLY due to recent pullback for long term dividend payer. PE is still a bit on the high side and dividend is comparable to that of S&P 500, 1.5%."
"On Monday, June 7th, $BIIB announced FDA Accelerated Approval of its Alzheimer's medication. The market cap increased by $17 billion! On June 24th, $LLY announced FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation of Their Alzheimer's medication. The market cap increased by $15 billion. Last Friday, Roche announced the FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation of its Alzheimer's medication. Its market cap increased by $13 billion. SAVA's Market cap sits at $2 billion. If the market cap increases by the Median ($15 billion), the SP will 8.5x. Oh, did I mention the above changes happened on ONE trading day? It did. Full post on FDA approval odds linked below. https://www.reddit.com/.../sava_will_85x_when_it.../"
Breaking --Exclusives: Eli Lilly out to crash the megablockbuster PD-(L)1 party with 'disruptive' pricing; reveals cancer biotech buyout$LLY
Unfortunately this virüs will stay with us at least 6 mnths imo. dont get mad @shrties but u longs thx 2 shrties . They are the fuel of all Covid related stocks. becauseofem they all will fly again. MRNA to 600 imo.$PFE $BNTX $BMY $LLY $MRK $JNJ (bullish all of them)
$ABCL flying low trading float very low institutions and insiders own most of shares moves easilyWay too many catalysts including coPlatoon of $lly (Eli Lilly 1404) covid drug.. ABCL is an arms dealer working with many big companies like Everest $MRNA $pfe the list goes on and on do your dd at this price it’s a steal long hold!! Even short term traders will bank get in now! 
"Why the bloodbath in the last week or so? Was Kamala Harris named the new CEO, or something?"
Seems like drug stocks are down across the board today including ABBV which I own. This sector is getting hammered. Capital rotation ?
Lost 34$ last month !!$ What’s going on ?
"LLY just reported earnings with Positive guidance ""Raises Full Year Forecast."" Bullish. Both LLY and UNH excellent!"
"ABCL down big time today, is that due to $LLY Not hitting its target Q3?"
"$BIIB is trading at the price it was at BEFORE FDA APPROVAL, actually not 1 FDA approval but TWO! They just had an FDA approval last week? All big biotech traders from $ABBV $AMGN $REGN $LLY $JNJ $PFE $MRNA $MRK will be loading this dip with both hands. Do you guys even know HOW MANY NOVELTY drugs are under Biogens belt or in the pipeline? THE bears are AGGRESSIVELY using the fact that ""only"" 100 patients have received the drug so far as a reason for it to trade at the price level which acts as the drug never existed.! As if the drug is not THE ONLY DRUG APPROVED for Alzheimer's. At this price it's FREE MONEY, it's a layup. Why is it BOUNCING HARD from $285? I'll let you think about it. Oh and let's not forget about the ""little"" partnership with $AAPL.that both $AAPL & $BIIB are keeping on the hush. $BIIB HAS HAD AT LEAST 4 MAJOR accomplishments since its FDA approval of Aduhelm that have ALL been overlooked. It's trading at a price BEFORE ANY of these accomplishments. You're crazy for missing it here."
Keep buying do not sell now that’s a rookie move I’m all in I’ve done the research I know this company... they are the company all these racers for mRNA tech will be flocking too.. idc if some here don’t believe in buyout but at this point with such big names needing their tech I see no reason why any biotech that’s big wouldn’t mind stomping out the competitions edge that they share and taking ABCL portfolio for itself! No brainer ! $mrna $nbax $bntx $pfe $mrk $lly
"Forget about the other pipeline but delta alone is gonna push sp higher mo. Unfortunately too many unvaccinated and this delta variant is so fast and not easily suppressed. We, not only need more care, more sanitation products oxygen cylinders and respiratory products etc but more VACCİNATİON!!. Hey if it is not that bad Pentagon would not order vaccination for all soldiers in active duty. Delta is coming in full force and we need more vaccination no matter what....Buckle up we may be flying to 600 in 6 mnths imo.$PFE $BNTX $BMY $LLY $MRK $JNJ (bullish all of them)"
"I understand Eli Lily is about to ACQUIRE Regen Biopharm (RGBP), is that right?? They collaborated few years ago on the same molecule that modified immune response, in fact they have patents on different aspects of that molecule. RGBP has licensed it's mRNA Vaccine Patent to Oncology Pharma for $1.1 Million plus royalty rights for 15 YEARS! No doubt Lilly would want to be in on that action and acquire the company."
"Great Reddit Post: Valuation: On Monday, June 7th, $BIIB announced FDA Accelerated Approval of ADUHELM (Alzheimer's medication, AD). The market cap went up to $17 Billion.On June 24th, $LLY announced the FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation of Donanemab (Another AD medication). The market cap increased by $15 billion. If SAVA announces a fast-track process for approval of its Alzheimer's (AD) medication, assuming it increases by 15 billion (like lly), that would be an 8.5x move in ONE DAY!I'll explain why Cassava has an excellent chance at being fast-tracked (soon) but let me highlight two key points first: 1) The above catalysts were NOT FDA approval; They were announcements that FDA approval was fast-tracked. 2) SAVA's AD medication has achieved what BIIB and LLY can only fantasize about. It is far superior to both. I'll provide data for that to make it clear. As the above is related to valuation, I'll throw in that you want to read more about valuation; see the Seeking Alpha article below. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pz6w8h/sava_cause_more_wrinkle/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source= click on the link to finish reading."
