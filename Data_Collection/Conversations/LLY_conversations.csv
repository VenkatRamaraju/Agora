"On Monday, June 7th, $BIIB announced FDA Accelerated Approval of its Alzheimer's medication. The market cap increased by $17 billion! On June 24th, $LLY announced FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation of Their Alzheimer's medication. The market cap increased by $15 billion. Last Friday, Roche announced the FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation of its Alzheimer's medication. Its market cap increased by $13 billion. SAVA's Market cap sits at $2 billion. If the market cap increases by the Median ($15 billion), the SP will 8.5x. Oh, did I mention the above changes happened on ONE trading day? It did. Full post on FDA approval odds linked below. https://www.reddit.com/.../sava_will_85x_when_it.../"
Seems like drug stocks are down across the board today including ABBV which I own. This sector is getting hammered. Capital rotation ?
"IMO the Big Boys like $REGN, $GILD, $PFE, $AMGN, $LLY, etc. could be looking at $SRNE as a potential acquisition target with its vast product pipeline and modest market cap."
Lilly is possible suitor for a buyout of INOVIO's --INO-- DNA Vaccine Platform. Inovio's vaccine has demonstrated the longest lasting immunity in the Challenge Study of Covid-19 animals. I would expect a 5x current market price buyout.
"OMER is the 2019 recipient of the Nobel Prize Of Pharma, The Prix Galien Canada Research Award. Google it. Big Pharma is anticipating covid19 mutations and will buy them up. $GILD $LLY $PFE $AMGN $REGN $GNUS"
Cramer said LLY will be an absolute gift if it gets down into the $160 per share level. ￼
"I understand Eli Lily is about to ACQUIRE Regen Biopharm (RGBP), is that right?? They collaborated few years ago on the same molecule that modified immune response, in fact they have patents on different aspects of that molecule. RGBP has licensed it's mRNA Vaccine Patent to Oncology Pharma for $1.1 Million plus royalty rights for 15 YEARS! No doubt Lilly would want to be in on that action and acquire the company."

"By Deena Beasley(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co on Saturday said its experimental Alzheimer’s drug slowed the rate of decline in a measure of cognition and function by 32% compared with a placebo in a mid-stage trial of patients at an early stage of the mind wasting disease.The drug, donanemab, also showed positive trends that failed to reach statistical significance on a range of secondary trial goals, the company said, providing details for the first time.The 18-month, 272-patient study showed, for instance, that patients treated with donanemab had a 23% slower rate of decline in a measure known as the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes, a tool commonly used to gauge dementia severity.The ability to carry out activities like dressing and eating is often impacted by Alzheimer’s disease, which reduces cognitive ability like memory and language.Donanemab is an antibody designed to remove clumps of the Alzheimer’s-related protein beta amyloid from the brain. It targets a specific type of beta amyloid that Lilly believes can be rapidly cleared, enabling short-term, but durable treatment.Patients in the study stopped receiving donanemab and were switched to placebo once their brain plaques reached levels seen in healthy people.Beta amyloid has been a popular target for dozens of experimental Alzheimer's drugs, all of which have failed so far.Unlike other drugs aimed at alleviating symptoms, Lilly is ""thinking about Alzheimer's disease as a pathology of the brain - more like cancer that you treat,"" said Daniel Skovronsky, Lilly’s chief scientific officer.In the study, the drug provided the most benefit to patients who entered the trial with lower levels of plaque.A brain swelling side effect, known as ARIA-E, occurred in 27% of trial patients treated with donanemab, the company said.Skovronsky said the company is continuing to study the drug in a second, 500-patient trial.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide in June whether to approve aducanumab, an experimental amyloid-targeting drug developed by Biogen Inc that has demonstrated mixed trial results.The number of Americans living with Alzheimer's is expected to rise to around 13 million by 2050 from more than 6 million currently, according to the Alzheimer's Association."
Prescience Point Capital Management - Apr 1FDA’s likely rejection of Pfizer $PFE & Eli Lilly’s $LLY new drug for knee OA is extremely bullish for MiMedx and we believe will lead to multiple buyout offers for MDXG from Big Pharma after its phase 2B knee OA trial results are published this summer
Much better days in horizon for longs.
A natural correction will buy at $115. Growth story still in tack.
Hopefully between LLY and SAVA there will be some tangible news on AD treatments.
I have Lilly too but Buying SAVA on the bell tomorrow
Did anybody see Mad Money today? Cramer had the CEO on today. March 15th is the day. Buy now in advance of the release of the upcoming trials release. He was very positive as was Cramer. Get on it while the getting is good. Look at my earlier post on Intel. I predicted the that Intel would be back in the $60’s within 2 months after it went down to the low $40’s. Almost to the day after my post it hit $60. I see LLY at $240/$260 by the end of March.
"Morning folks, just wonder if many had noticed the news released by Hemogenyx in the past few days? They have confirmed they have been working with Eli Lilly for the past few years on a few pipeline items that are very very significant. Looks to be integrating with Eli closely with the potential to blow away the competition in the very near future!What looks most significant is the humanised mice, it looks to me they have the potential to HALF the time of some clinical trials and associated costs.Looks like ready to start Clinical trials for new promising AML cancer treatment?Reading Hemogenyx RNS and its mind blowing the potential.What I want to know is are Lilly planning to buy out Hemo or just licence some products, if not buy, WHY NOT?????"
nobody will buy their drug if Sava goes.on market . Sava proven to be More efficient and less Side effect
Why is LLY going up so fast. What drugs in pipeline are accounting for this?
Anyone know how to increase the size of the font on these conversations without having to increase your iphone font?￼
I'm reading about donanemab drug that is pumping this stock today. I don't understand how this drug is better to SAVA's simufilam
So no one on this board is talking about the firm that announced a 25% stake in $ACIU today? What about Eli Llly $LLY announcing a 5% stake just an hour ago?
Keep working on your pipedreams and knocking out 9% of your market cap in one day.Where is the Lilly covid19 virus vaccination ?
Close to 27% (26.7%) of patients had brain swelling......Safety will be equally important as efficacy to capture maximum AD patients worldwide......Does SAVA have the goods ? The market appears to be saying ....yes.
Korea Biomedical Review cites a British AI developer as saying Lilly's Olumiant could be effective against the corona virus. The drug blocks the transmission of 2019-nCov. More research is needed. Any update would be appreciated...http://www.koreabiomed.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=7381
$LLY oversold so is $BIIB. $BIIB had huge news today and it's bouncing
"Thank God I chose Lilly instead of Pfizer on January 28, 2011587.20% Total 21.26% Annualized238.09% 12.95%"
"something going to happen with LLY, the option contract is acting so weird for this company. The March 15, 150$ Strike price have a volume over 123K . Something going to happen this week or next week."
I'm a buyer at $20
"Lilly is a great company. I have owned it for almost 30 years and I have made a ton of money on it. It is a good, steady performer. Be sure to reinvest the dividend then forget about it. Given time you will be well rewarded."
LLY reached an all time high at 133.61
I have very strong instincts that either one of $lly or $regn or $pfe will take over $srne .. let’s see time will tell
"Lilly is about to hit its ex-dividend date on May 13th. This means if your sitting on the fence on whether to invest in LLY, you should do it before May 13th or you won’t be eligible for the dividend payout on June 10, 2021! * This is not stock advice, but if you like pharma stocks, LLY is by far the one to own in 2021/22 & I believe will revisit the $220’s by June. $"
First time in nearly 20 years after a judge allowed generics to Prozac that LLY's stock has approached #100/sh.
when is the split coming?
I took a day off today . Fingers crossed and hoping LLY would provide a breakthrough announcement. Best wishes all
"“Every way that we look at the data, we cut the data in many different ways to try and look to see if there’s some anomaly that can explain the results other than a successful drug, and we just don’t see it,” Skovronsky, Lilly’s chief scientific officer, told Barron’s. “That’s different than every other Alzheimer’s study to date.”"
Buying SAVA on the bell tomorrow
"Interesting article on Seeking Alpha. Title is misleading, but the article makes me wonder if either Eli Lilly or Novartis ate the ideal companies for NAVB to be speaking to?Eli Lilly Receives Positive Data For Hard-To-Detect Inflammatory Arthritis $LLY https://seekingalpha.com/article/4256557"

Unable to stay positive. St the end of session always give up
"LLY “UPGRADED TO BUY @ $222”. This is the Pharma Company to own for both short & long term Hands Down Folks!! The pipeline is 1st class. The operating costs of this pharma company is right on par. So many positives Vs negatives to mention here, but just Google it & you will see. Plus for the Longs is the icing on the cake of a “Big Fat Dividend” to boot that was not slashed, but “RAISED” during last years country wide shut down.Bottom line, Lilly is a very solid 144+ year old pharmaceutical company and if you know any in Indy, the Lilly’s know how to turn a profit decade after decade. My $ is as safe a haven you will find in stocks to build wealth!"
"Same chart as QCOM a month ago... Give it 3 weeks it’ll hit $160-$162, sorry..."

Hello I really want to invest in Eli Lilly I have done research and I really like the pipeline of drugs. What do you think is a good starting price ?
"LLY doing very well on election results! A nice Biden win (78% chance right now) and Republican Senate (91% chance right now) after all is sad and done - that's great for LLY. It means divided government, which give big pharma more room to profit without government interference. It also means Trump is likely gone (so say goodbye to his efforts to lower drug prices). Biden is more easily lobbied and likely responds more to special interest money (especially without a ""blue wave"" mandate for ""change"" and less pressure form progressives). This election just delivered a ""RETURN TO STATUS QUO"" result. Soft (legal) corruption and influence peddling will continue apace. Buy big tech and Big Pharma and GET REWARDED. Workers in the US are the losers here, without Trump. Look for cheap immigrant labor flows to increase and for pharma price gouging, job / manufacturing outsourcing, Chinese influence, etc. to also increase. The rich get richer and workers get poorer, at least for the next 4 years. Corporate profits up, threading the needle between avoiding both regulation and also Biden's tax plans, as Senate will block big moves. Governing by ""executive order"" to continue. No one is going to be there to stop China or big tech from taking over the World."
"For anyone selling because of the generic glucagon approval from the FDA, this is a challenge to $LLY not $XERS. Xers is not selling much of the old style mixable glucagon anymore, they still lots of the Gvoke with glucagon. Very different products. This is another head fake to get people to sell before the stock price goes up again towards $7+. Get your cheap shares while you can, lots of news coming in January 2021!"
Is there a split coming soon ?
pfizer vaccine isn't even effective against delta variant. All of Israel is sick despite 80% vaccinated. Being vaccinated offers limited protection. Wake up
Anyone think this price action has to do with Government wanting to cap pricing on pharma?
Lily should consider using the technology from NNVC like GILD did with Remdesivir and turned a crummy drug into a winner.
I just bought in. Seems like a good solid quarter to me and they even raised upper end of the guidance which is rare in this environment. Only negative I can see is Cialis sales but their diabetes drug more than upsets any deficiency! Market moves are always baffling!
govt just bought more doses of their treatment... so bought some shares. does that make sense? I don't really know
Good data leads to lower stock price?! What’s going on here?
This strong upside is not surprising to me. I have been expecting it and I know there is more to come in the future. Lilly is the best pharma company out there.
Drug fails and then gets approved. Corruption apex
What’s going on. Since 2 weeks. Down down down
Lilly is suddenly getting a lot of press
"All the SAVA pumpers in the board are pumping SAVA, but the fact is Simufilam improved cognition by only 10%. “Cassava Sciences study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and found that a six-month treatment of simufilam improved average cognition scores by 10%. Tested levels for dementia-related behavior improved by 29% over the course of the treatment. “LLY is much more effective."
3 weeks ago I made a comment about what a good investment Lilly has been for me over the past 25 years. I got several thumbs down. Where are they today? lol.
"well, Cramer just toasted about $100,000 on his ambitious buying position... costly endeavor...."
"$ENZCUnder ""right to try"" & ""compassionate use"" laws, $ENZC's ""CLONE 3""/""proprietary mAbs production methodology"" should go straight to Clinical Trials to help later-stage patients, especially those who need help breathing.$LLY $REGN recently paused mAbs trials for late stage"
"Enrique Conterno, president of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly USA, said on an earnings call Wednesday that ""we continue to see pressure on pricing across all of our diabetes products.""""When we look at our Q4 results, I think there was pressure from a rebating perspective on the insulin portfolios of both Humalog and Basaglar in particular,"" Conterno said. ""But we are being extremely disciplined, and we like our overall prospects and the access that we basically have with all of our top brands. We believe that Trulicity, for example, is extremely well positioned for '18, and so is Jardiance.""Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly on Wednesday reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.14, representing a 20% rise from the year-ago period. Revenue grew 7% year over year to $6.16 billion."
Any reason for the stock being up almost $3 AH? when are we expecting ALZ data? thought it was this weekend?
"I think we finally going to make it to $170, vol is low nobody is buying selloff should start soon"
"is LLY the next trillion dollar market cap company? if their alzheimers treatment is the real deal, then yes it is ..."
Interesting take in that when Lilly posted earnings above expectations the stock price dropped but Novo Nordisk that narrowly missed saw an increase in it's stock price....
Lost 34$ last month !!$ What’s going on ?
"Compared to Lilly's (Loxo's) just published interim data on Loxo 292 (Selpercatinib), TPX0046 does hold its own very well, especially when it comes to cORR and intracranial ORR.

"$LLY today: The Indianapolis drug maker said Anne White, who currently serves as president of its Lilly Oncology unit, would become president of Lilly Neuroscience, responsible for the company's launched products and Phase 3 portfolio in pain and neurodegeneration. Perfect tie in for $SAVA..."
Lily to buy sava
A million shares traded at 9:32am and no news out there? Now it's even going higher.
"I look at this MRK and PFE as great long term holds, the baby boomers aren't going to get any healthier in the next 10 years."
Is this medication really given intravenously? There’s no way an IV drug will ever be successful
Great news. Lilly's tirzepatide significantly reduced A1C and body weight in people with type 2 diabetes. $4B market for long term growth.
"Great News! WOHOOOO!!!! Lilly partners with AC Immune for Alzheimer's treatment $LLY, $PFE, $JNJ, $RHHBYUnder the terms of the deal, AC Immune will receive an upfront payment of 80 million Swiss francs ($80.47 million) and $50 million in exchange for a note convertible to equity at a premium, the companies said on Wednesday."
This will breach $300 per share. This year (likely) or sometime next year.
"Great Reddit Post: Valuation: On Monday, June 7th, $BIIB announced FDA Accelerated Approval of ADUHELM (Alzheimer's medication, AD). The market cap went up to $17 Billion.On June 24th, $LLY announced the FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation of Donanemab (Another AD medication). The market cap increased by $15 billion. If SAVA announces a fast-track process for approval of its Alzheimer's (AD) medication, assuming it increases by 15 billion (like lly), that would be an 8.5x move in ONE DAY!I'll explain why Cassava has an excellent chance at being fast-tracked (soon) but let me highlight two key points first: 1) The above catalysts were NOT FDA approval; They were announcements that FDA approval was fast-tracked. 2) SAVA's AD medication has achieved what BIIB and LLY can only fantasize about. It is far superior to both. I'll provide data for that to make it clear. As the above is related to valuation, I'll throw in that you want to read more about valuation; see the Seeking Alpha article below. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pz6w8h/sava_cause_more_wrinkle/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source= click on the link to finish reading."
"Heard this story before, an alzheimer drug shows promising preclinical results only to fail in trials."
"I saw the presentation yesterday and the Lillys's AD drug is just terrible compared to SAVA's simufilam in every aspect: Painful 1h injections vs pillsBrain swelling vs no side effectsMediocre results vs cognitive, agitation and biomarkers improvementAfter 34 weeks no effects vs long term revert of AD"
Eli Lilly Jardiance lost against sotagliflozin from Lexicon in HFPEF!!
Some of the drop might be related to problems with the Biogen Alzheimer drug roll out
Buy Sava !!!
"About a quarter of patients had brain swelling and 7.6% of pts had small brain bleeds.....If SAVA's 9 month July 29th readout shows a superior safety and cognition benefit, LLY and BIIB will likely take a major hit...Something to ponder going forward."
Ouch ! Crammer got this one wrong like big time
$ABCL flying low trading float very low institutions and insiders own most of shares moves easilyWay too many catalysts including coPlatoon of $lly (Eli Lilly 1404) covid drug..

"A lot of people don’t want to hear this because BP and even SP can’t make money on this but the study is out now that confirms that VITAMIN D (which is very inexpensive) is the best thing to take for both treatment and prevention of Covid. Yes, VITAMIN D. Of course, this will be ignored because there’s no money to be made on Vitamin D but now you know $REGN $GILD $LLY"
"Those benefits will need to be confirmed in a larger trial. Sadly, the drug industry has had several prospective Alzheimer's drugs that showed promise and created stock market gains but eventually fizzled out. The Lilly data are from just 272 patients."
SAVA......EOS.
"LLY should rebound some from here, oversold, given the decent EPS and growth projections."
"I'm expecting LLY shares to move based on the FDA decision on the competing amyloid-lowering Alzheimer's drug from BIIB. While approval of Aducanumab might cause a few to sell their LLY, in the longer run it would likely be good news for LLY and Donanemab. It would set a very low bar for Donanemab approval, and should the antibody prove to replicate in a pivotal phase 3 trial its benefit of slowing cognitive decline and secondary endpoint biomarkers of disease progression, it would be well positioned to become a megablockbuster drug for LLY."
Who finds it concerning that a third official has now resigned from the FDA since Biogen's alzheimers drug approval? LLY shot up because of Biogen's drug approval
"All these Pharmas undervalued with what they have in the hoppers. GSK, BMY, LLY, AZN ...even PFE to some extent."
Probably one of the best pharma stock to hold for growth. But will it ever outperform GOOGL or FB or AMZN?
"Take a moment and see my response posted to Reuters news release: ""Lilly's lupus treatment succeeds in mid-stage trial"" Food for thought."

So the real ? w/ LLY is to hold/buy or cash out now? Where does this stock go in the next week or two??
Keep buying do not sell now that’s a rookie move I’m all in I’ve done the research I know this company... they are the company all these racers for mRNA tech will be flocking too.. idc if some here don’t believe in buyout but at this point with such big names needing their tech I see no reason why any biotech that’s big wouldn’t mind stomping out the competitions edge that they share and taking ABCL portfolio for itself!

I used to work for Eli Lilly. I recently got an email saying the lock up of employee shares is finished. Therefore I imagine the selloff is party due to this.

Take your money over to SAVA guys.. the real deal
People here comparing Lly and Sava !! Yes both AZ !!! And both should be complimentary to each other !! I wish good results for lly and sava in both cases this is needed for investors and even more for families around the world !!

"Phase 3 result of monoclonal therapy against Covid-19 will come out at any time. Most likely it will be positive. However, LLY stock slides. Why?"
"The antibody cocktail that President Trump received for his COVID-19 infection and touted on Wednesday evening as a ""cure"" for the deadly virus was developed using cells derived from aborted fetal tissue, a practice the White House and anti-abortion rights groups oppose."
The gov't should not provide monoclonal antibodies for free to anyone not vaccinated. This should be a cost borne by the individual who has made a personal choice to likely be infected with a deadly Pandemic Virus: Covid. The vaccine are only 1% of the cost of the monoclonal antibodies. They choose. They pay.
"Lilly Chief Scientific Officer Dan Skovronsky said the results appeared to show that patients who received the drug had about the same level of cognitive skills after 18 months of treatment as the placebo recipients had after 12 months.""We slowed the disease down by about a third,"" he said. ""In an 18-month study we've given them six months of less decline. Of course it's a 10-year disease. The question is over 10 years could you give them back three years.""Patients receiving donanemab experienced side effects such as amyloid-related swelling in the brain.Not as impressive as i had hoped. the company hyped it. it has a ways to go in terms of testing. the side effects were not good in a good # of patients.

"2 largely overlooked biotechs in AD, PD prevention/cure BioVie Inc. (BIVI) --- BIVI's NE3107, a selective inhibitor of inflammatory ERK signaling that reduces neuroinflammation. It is an orally administered first-in-class small molecule that inhibits inflammation-driven insulin resistance and major pathological inflammatory cascades with a novel mechanism of action. There is emerging scientific consensus that both inflammation and insulin resistance play fundamental roles in the development of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease, and NE3107 could represent an entirely new medical approach to treating these devastating conditions affecting an estimated 6 million Americans suffering from Alzheimer’s and 1 million from Parkinson’s. The FDA recently authorized a pivotal US Phase 3 clinical trial for NE3107.AC Immune (ACIU) --- Robust and diverse pipeline of nine therapeutic and three diagnostic product candidates has the potential to greatly improve the treatment of a broad spectrum of Alzheimer’s and neurodegenerative diseases.

At least CYDY is proven safe for over 1000+ patients. Glad to have stock there.
I am highly encouraged in the potential outcomes of clinical trials on antibody treatment of covid-19
"Okay so LLY showed no success with hospitalized patients in their antibody treatment. Neither did regeneron and the reason is that by that point, it is too late. But my feeling is that if either of those two treatments is started early in the infection process as what happened with Trump, they are quite efficient at stopping the infection. So the market for this drug in my opinion is people recently diagnosed that are in a high-risk category. I am hoping that my prediction comes true of course because I hold LLY stock."
$HRTX approval expected soon. FDA ahead of schedule this year. $LLY Trijardy approved. $HZNP Tepezza approved Jan 21st ahead of March 8th PDUFA date.$BPMC Ayvakit approved Jan 9th ahead of Feb 14th PDUFA date.$AZN Enhertu approved in December ahead of q2 2020 PDUFA. $SGEN Padcev approved December 19th ahead of March 15th PDUFA date. $NLNK Ervebo approved December 20th ahead of March 14th PDUFA date. Good to see the FDA is sticking to its initiatives for more prompt reviews. Especially for the fast track and priority review products that have unmet clinical needs like $HRTX htx-011. Good chance for approval in advance of March 26 PDUFA.
Looming buyout w/ JNJ could skyrocket $GERN. LLY investors should check it out as there may be growing value to jump on.
"No new light shed in today’s presentation of full data, so it continues to show the drug can slow down AD progression better than 35-40% on newly diagnosed patients, a number similar to preliminary one before. Should continue to be on a wait and see period until a larger trial with more patients to yield similar results. FDA will approve, if it continue to show the slowdown effect in AD progression."
Lilly successful antibody study to Covid. Strong buy.
Never buy the PEAK
How many IPO shares will we receive ?
This is the LAST TIME you will see $BIIB this low. Did you see that $48 million BUY yesterday? We could close WELL above $305 today.

"LLY and BIIB have SAVA and AVXL showing the FDA in later stage trials that their drugs are more effective without the side effects. So as desperate as everyone is for a solution of any kind or efficacy, the FDA has to lean toward AVXL and SAVA... and the market has been seeing that this year."
Sava got better advantage .. support sava
"i looked at SAVA and it is interesting. i looked at the mgmt and they are well credentialed. many alzheimer drugs have crashed and burned in the past. and this company only has the one drug. it is all or nothing. a $2B market cap still very small if successful. so maybe worth a small position, as this is a 50x bagger if it hits and goes to zero if it fails. glta"
A beat on bottom and top guidance raised and the stock is down 4%.Makes total sense......

I see the Sava folks feel a need to push their company here while Lily is in the news. What most of them aren’t pointing out is that Lily also has done significant work in curing Covid patients. Try searching for Eli Lily’s bamlanivimab if you want to know more.

"$BIIB is trading at the price it was at BEFORE FDA APPROVAL, actually not 1 FDA approval but TWO! They just had an FDA approval last week? All big biotech traders from $ABBV $AMGN $REGN $LLY $JNJ $PFE $MRNA $MRK will be loading this dip with both hands. Do you guys even know HOW MANY NOVELTY drugs are under Biogens belt or in the pipeline? THE bears are AGGRESSIVELY using the fact that ""only"" 100 patients have received the drug so far as a reason for it to trade at the price level which acts as the drug never existed.! As if the drug is not THE ONLY DRUG APPROVED for Alzheimer's. At this price it's FREE MONEY, it's a layup. Why is it BOUNCING HARD from $285? I'll let you think about it. Oh and let's not forget about the ""little"" partnership with $AAPL.that both $AAPL & $BIIB are keeping on the hush. $BIIB HAS HAD AT LEAST 4 MAJOR accomplishments since its FDA approval of Aduhelm that have ALL been overlooked.

"ATTN shep: 5 months ago you posted this:“lly is retaining 80% + of Elan. Wall Street is so disceiving to ipo a company and the buyers only own a 20% part of it. I would love to own some Elan but I guess I will just watch it. I didn't buy Zoetis when I had the chance and it has run up so much. It could be at some point in time LLY might spinoff to shareholders the part of Elan that it is keeping. We can hope”Looks like you got your wish. I'm guessing you're already aware of the offer, but just in case you aren't, here's the gist of it.Eli Lilly & Company LLY announced that it will launch an exchange offer for shareholders in order to divest its remaining ownership interest in Elanco Animal Health Incorporated ELAN.Under the exchange offer, Lilly shareholders can exchange all, some or none of their Lilly shares for shares of Elanco common stock owned by Lilly at 7% discount. Lilly expects the exchange offer to be tax free, except the cash received in lieu of fractional shares.Would be interested in your thoughts. If I'm reading the chart correctly, ELAN went public sometime in September @ around $36.00 It’s now trading under $30.00 which makes me a little leery."
