CFRA maintains strong buy on MRK and raises PT by $4 to $97
"MRK trading at 12.4X estimated 2022 EPS. And that 2022 EPS estimate is almost certainly ""outdated"", given all recent trends.Cheap!"
This is probably the most undervalued stock in the market on a risk adjusted basis. I bought this stock originally as a defensive play but it also has strong upside potential as well.
Barclays ups PT to $94 and maintains outperform rating today
At least $100.continue to buy.I am waiting Meme to push MRK to $150
Not too shabby. One would expect a good day from these earnings & guidance. We shall see.
Very pleased! Holding long and strong. Five years and we may be looking at $500 per share. Holding this as my dividend retirement stock. So no hurry ... no worry. Had a hunch and got in at $81. Averaged down and sitting pretty.
"I remember adding to my MRK position at round 60 because of the Div....you know, getting paid while MRK got its act together idea...........didn't realize that they would get their act together this quickly .....BONUS ! :)"
I am sick of all the spam on yahoo! I actually try to stay off of the MRK message board now and exclusively use http://the-alphatrader.com/
It's not to late to join the rally. Value Line has a $120 price target on this stock. This company has underappreciated growth potential and serves as a strong ballast against any market downturns.
"Very pleased with the MRK results generating a solid beat on revenues of $ 8 Billion and a strong beat of 12.9% or 1.75 vs. !,55 and revenue was 13.1 Billion. The company has a new target of 100 which may be achieved due the the announcement that they are forecasting a 20 million shipment of the new pill during 2022, The stock has a current PE of 13.33. With the earnings already generated they increased their EPS forecast to 5.70 from %.5.52 for this year . a Nice Dividend of $2.60 already in place. I can imagine this will be increased at the end of year. Quality company with strong results and a dividend of 3.03 %. Rated a strong buy by Doc Najarian on CNBC as his buy of the day this afternoon . I already own a huge position but I am considering another buy as the Future PE is quite low. The average DataBase 52.75 makes this look like a back up the truck buy."
"Believe it or not, I got into MRK many, many years ago when I bought 1K shares of Key Pharmaceuticals at 11$; converted to Schering Plough and then 5K shares of MRK + $180K. This more than made up for the many missteps I've taken over the years. Holding firm!"
smart move by management.poor countries can’t afford to pay $700.This will make fda bad if they postpone the decision.They can still sell the medicine toEU &other countries who can afford it.
When does Merck management and BOD discuss increasing dividend?
Do not listen to the shorts merck will be $ 100 dollars with in this year.
Did I hear this right ? The projected estimate for the following year does not even consider revenues from the Covid Pill and the revenue from Covid pill is expected at $7 billion over the next two years.
"i know $700 isn't the figure for every pill sold we'll reap, but potentially $21,000,000,000 in revs through next year assures us of seeing $100 at least. Buy."
European medicines agency equivalent to fda in usa has started rolling review of the medicine for covid-19.Indonesia is in talks with MRK to buy their medicine & asked MRK to open a plant in indonesia.Population of EU is about is about 448M &population of indonesia is about 273M.other countries will announce the same news pretty soon.
I can’t believe I sold this the other day
"Why this stock isn’t trading above $140 with earnings like that and the new anti covid pill there should be a huge jump in price, even the hedge funds should get on the action. I’m all in since a month ago."
