CNBC Good Covid pill news today!
"Molnupiravir (development codes MK-4482 and EIDD-2801) is an experimental antiviral drug which is orally active and was developed for the treatment of influenza.The drug was developed at Emory University by the university's drug innovation company, Drug Innovation Ventures at Emory (DRIVE). It was then acquired by Miami-based company Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, who later partnered with Merck & Co. to develop the drug further.In April 2020, Rick Bright, who was removed as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) before the approval of the drug, submitted a whistleblower complaint asserting that Ridgeback pressured BARDA to provide funding to manufacture EIDD-2801 despite Bright's concerns that similar drugs in its class have mutagenic properties. A previous company, Pharmasset, that had investigated the drug's active ingredient had abandoned it over similar concerns."
"FDA Approves Merck's KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab) Plus Chemotherapy, With or Without Bevacizumab, as Treatment for Patients With Persistent, Recurrent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer Whose Tumors Express PD-L1 (CPS =1)"
"Molnupiravir works by incorporating itself into the genetic material of the virus, and then causing a huge number of mutations as the virus replicates, effectively killing it. In some lab tests, the drug has also shown the ability to integrate into the genetic material of mammalian cells, causing mutations as those cells replicate.HARD PASS!"
Merck COVID pill molnupiravir has huge risk. No way to be approved
"n5 hours agoStudies from India show that molnupiravir (Merck pill) had not shown ""significant efficacy"" against moderate-severe covid 19 disease, Reuters news agency reports. The two Indian drugmakers, Aurobindo Pharma and MSN Laboratories, plan to discontinue their respective late-stage trials of the experimental antiviral drug in moderate-severe Covid 19 cases because of this."
Sell it boys and girls. Fda will not approve. Vaccines will win. Bad news after bad news let’s go article writers and fda. You know what to do
"To the NAYSAYERS you might want to try harder to give MERCK some credit. This great news has knocked $billions off the competition's balance sheets. Expect the screaming to continue. Meanwhile, drinking alcohol while driving and now cell phones are knocking off people left and right. Need I go on ?The old man."
Yes sir. Come on analyst keep saying bad stuff and writing bad articles. Hopefully fauci declines this drug then we just add another 0 to our pfizer and moderna balance. Keep the 0s coming. 100000. Moderna and pfizer printing money. Merck shorted. Let’s go boys and girls. Don’t approve drug.
From $84 to $79. Man loving this short. People keep selling and keep shorting. Vaccines will win thanks for making me more money on both Pfizer and Moderna. Uncle fauci and FDA going to say no. Why do you think they haven’t voted?
"Notice the fake hysteria . There has been no proof the pill causes cancer...yet 20 minutes after the news release there was an a professional hit attack . I understand that those people have million's to lose being stuck with their 50 times over price covid vaccine stocks but calm down... you people will be able to take the pill too. There are $billions to evaporate overnight but I am sorry. Enjoy this new pill. Remember , the pill in the 1960s that was suppose to cause the end of time ? Relax .The old man."
The naysayers are in a shock panic. Tomorrow they will say you can't take the pill while it's raining. The competition is working all night and day to fault this new answer for humanity. The real reason is the future loss of income. Reminds me when I read the history of Small Pox.The friendly old man
$100 on FDA approval.
It’s just common sense guys merck asked for approval about 2 weeks ago. If they were going to approve they would have. Now they have to wait until november 30. This is just all politics and games. For the last time. Fauci and FDA love vaccines. They approve everything moderna pfizer boosters next up children. It just doesn’t matter. I shorted merck made 6k and I own both pfizer and moderna and we printed a lot of money today and we will print some more tomorrow. Thanks for playing!
"If thus gets approved, it’s great newsLet me ask the shorts a question, if you get tested positive and they offer you this pill, are you going to take it or decide not to decrease your chances of getting severely sick by 50%￼?"
"Revive therapeutics is looking at cutting 70% hospitalization rate. Merck's used the word compelling and suddenly the results are good, 50 % is the minimum efficacy they should see, which does not make it suitable for FDA approval."
Chuckle. The MRK naysayers holding their over priced covid vaccine companies are desperate . This pill at this time is revolutionary and it irks the naysayers. People are funny. It's sort of like putting Harris in charge of the border. Smirk.
$700 per treatment. Not per pill.

"Besides many countries already buy the pills, today Singapore and Korea agreed to buy pills. German to weight to need to purchase. Good news, indeed.Shares fell. What is going on?"
Merck avoided the vaccine race and spent time on finding a pill to fight the virus…
Lucky wiener needs lessons on bashing1. Don’t do it every 5 minutes you lose your audience. 2. Play passive aggressive once in a while. 3. MRK is going over $110 easy!4. Bag hold for moderna when the next pandemic hits in 200yrs.
"I think there are still a huge population all over the world that have not taken the Covid vaccine yet, are waiting for MRK Covid pill. It may not be a effective as vaccine but good enough to prevent serious illness due to COVID-19. It can be easily accessible as it doesn’t have storage problem. I believe, this pill be a huge success once fully approved."
"KENILWORTH, N.J., October 13, 2021--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved KEYTRUDA, Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, in combination with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, for the treatment of patients with persistent, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer whose tumors express PD-L1 (Combined Positive Score [CPS] ≥1) as determined by an FDA-approved test.

"difficult to figure out investors, Moderna reaches $400 ,PFE goes nowhere yet they both provide vaccines to millions. MRK gives pill to 800 people with 50% success and jumps 8%"
Lots country is lining up to sign contract to buy
"guys - why people worried about the drug price? Governments around the world will control the price and provide huge contract for Merck as it is game changer. The cost of producing drug and material are very cheaper than vaccines. For example, MRNA could jack the vaccines to $700 - $1000 per two dose.... Would it be able to do so? For me MRNA is way over valued from $200 to $480 per share within one month.. Both MRK and Pizer were way under valued and good long term value stocks for sure."
Deadly Merck pill. FDA will not approve it . Merck shares will plunge 50%
in 120 days after approval stock should be 110 + It will be approved no deaths in tests. Moderna and PFE both killed nearly 100% of all animals tested and still received approval and both together have killed less than 1 million patients I have been told
With approval MRK goes to $95

"Government already booked $1.2 B on Molnupiravir. It may expand to $3B. Phase 3 will be known in Oct. Unlike vaccine, $700 per course is a rich people drug. Merck has exclusive right to global market. Oral is cool. But the high cost makes it hard to estimate the sale. Merck is under a negative pressure from a drug bill in Congress. But if the antiviral drug gets EUA in 4thQ, my target is $90 - $110."
"Zhou says that he is certain that the drug will integrate itself into the DNA of mammalian hosts. “Biochemistry won’t lie,” he says. “This drug will be incorporated in the DNA.”Merck hasn’t yet released any data from its animal studies, but the scientists believe that it would take long-term studies to show that the drug is truly totally safe.“Proceed with caution and at your own peril,” wrote Raymond Schinazi, a professor of pediatrics and the director of the division of biochemical pharmacology at the Emory University School of Medicine, who has studied NHC for decades, in an email to Barron’s.what if this is true what will happen to MRK stock ?are they exempt from liability in this drug ?"

So how you see this going if the pill gets approved ?
Gilead’s remdesivir is 87% effectiveMerck pill only 50% effective. So what?
The successes of Pfizer's covid vaccine and Merck's antiviral drug all come from buying or collaborating with small companies. Innovation does not come from the within.
"Wouldn't be surprised to see MRK get pushed down to the 77.50 area before starting to move back up. Not sure if it'll be today, but very soon."
"Indeed, Merck's reputation for rigor has eased some observers' worries. SVB Leerink analyst Daina Graybosch notes that the data on molnupiravir released last week came far later than some investors had expected. ""Merck took a really long time to develop this,"" Graybosch says. ""They haven't necessarily said this explicitly...but I think they've been doing a lot of work to get comfortable around this risk.""Graybosch, who covers Merck for SVB Leerink, raised her target price on the stock on Monday, to $104 from $101. Still, her outlook on molnupiraver is muted.

All mutigenic data and tests that could be collected has already been addressed by FDA previously to reassure exactly the arguments that are being raised now. The drug waiting approval is a prodrug of original meaning the new chemical structure was engineered without the capabilities to be mutigenic to normal cells. If not approved it would end up being another reason at this point. FDA was satisfied all the ways the new compound was addressed.

WOW still negative after all Docs are speaking for this pill on CNBC!
The Merck pill is only expensive because they have the license but the manufacturing of it should be no different than hydroxychloroquine look at the molecular formula it's just as small as hydroxychlorine this is basic organic chemistry manufacturing.
Merck blasted mrna down 200 points but why blame Merck the class A all American that also pays a great dividend ? The safe thing about Merck is you can leave it to your family. Don't try that with any of the other vaccine producers. Merck has many irons in the fire...shhhhh.

No news is going to move this
The trial results are great but the safety profile of molnupiravir remains a big concern; molnupiravir is actually prodrug of the synthetic nucleoside derivative N4-hydroxycytidine is mutagenic based on AMES test and there were subsequent controversial debates on its safety profile. FDA need to sort this out before approval
"The cost of a complete five-day course of Molnupiravir is $700 — or $70 per pill. That amounts to a 4,000% markup over what it costs Merck to make the drug.Citing 2013 prices provided by the WHO, Campbell said a five-day course of ivermectin — 10 3mg pills — costs $0.53. (However, at today’s U.S. prices, 10 3mg pills cost about $39).On effectiveness, Molnupiravir is lacking data. The only publicly available clinical data on Molnupiravir comes from a Merck press statement claiming the new drug is 50% effective against hospitalizations and deaths, when used as an early treatment.For ivermectin, using publicly available data, Campbell referred to one peer-reviewed study that pegs ivermectin’s effectiveness in early treatment at 62%, and an ongoing meta-analysis which shows ivermectin is 66% effective in early treatment and 86% effective as a prophylactic.Using VigiBase, a WHO database on pharmaceutical safety data, Campbell showed that out of 3.7 billion doses given of ivermectin there have been only 5,693 reports of adverse events — far fewer, according to Campbell, than the number of adverse event reports associated with amoxicillin and ibuprofen, both widely used and considered safe.will the truth ever come out about big pharma ?"

REALLLY feel good about this! My career in science (totally with Corporate America Pharma) tells me no way they would check into RNA mutations in Covid varients already (see news out today) if they weren't already seeing definate positive results in the ongoing clinical trials...obviously there would be no reason to. Depending on efficacy could be a Covid game changer worldwide!
"Merck's Molnupiravir has been hyped as a a block buster oral antiviral drug to treat Covid 19; Here is what I see:-Molnupiravir works by a distinct mechanism of action which is unlike other ant0viral drugs, Molnupiravir alters the genetic sequence of the virus thereby rendering the covid virus impotent, Most anti-viral drugs work in the following fashion: they prevent viral replication or enhance the human immune system to recognize the virus and prevent its spread. Because Molnupiravir alters the virus genetic code there is a distinct possibility that the altered virus by entering a healthy human cell will cause cancer in the long run. No long term studies have been conducted to address this uncertainty but this will have an impact on the FDA's guidance as to its use, Mitigating this carcinogenic risk is the fact that this is a short term thereby 5 days...Conclusion: FD grants narrow US approval for Molnupiravir for symptomic elderly unvaccinated patients. I am unclear whether there will be an exclusion for immuno-compromised patients due to their higher risk.This is a relatively smaller unvaccinated market than what the bulls are hoping for. If I am right, I would not buy Merck until after approval as I expect this narrow indication will have an adverse affect on the stock price.Conversely I see little impact on vaccines."
"Was in pharma over 30 years. A lot of these comments I'm seeing posted are jus in outer space and not in the realm of reality... Good friend thought he was superman (never sick day in his life), and thought vaccine was a risk! Got positive delta month ago. No meds kept him outta the hospital ICU with oxygen machine treatments for 3 days to stay conscious! Now at home on oxy machine treatments. U dont think he woulda jus popped pills 5 days to avoid this???? And all the chatter about ""only 50% efficacy"". U people dont understand! All the people in the trial had at least 1 preexisting condition (diabetes, asthma, heart disease)...and NONE DIED ON THE COVID PILL!! What about 90% unvaccinated deaths to vaccinated 10% of deaths now occurring? U think the vaccined population wont be popping the covid pill for some extra protection JIC of Hospitalization? The vaccines are not a cure all. Cant wait to see the escalating earnings releases announced thru 2022 and beyond!"

""approximately 50%; 7.3% of patients who received molnupiravir were either hospitalized or died through Day 29 following randomization (28/385), compared with 14.1% of placebo-treated patients (53/377); p=0.0012."".... so 100 covid positive patients take a $1000 pill per day, AND 7 of the 100 are hospitalized BUT if you don't take it 14 of 100 are hospitalized. huh??"
"The safety concerns suggest that the stock market’s reaction to the positive molnupiravir data on Friday might have been overblown. Shares of Merck jumped 8.4% Friday, while shares of Covid-19 vaccine maker Moderna (MNRA) fell 11.4%, and shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), which developed one of the leading monoclonal antibodies for Covid-19, fell 5.7%. Vir Biotechnology (VIR), which developed another of the monoclonal antibodies in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), was down 21.1%.“It was sort of, in effect, wishful thinking,” says SVB Leerink analyst Dr. Geoffrey Porges of investors’ reactions on Friday.Schinazi told Barron’s that he did not believe that molnupiravir should be given to pregnant women, or to young people of reproductive age, until more data is available. Merck’s trials of molnupiravir have excluded pregnant women; the scientists running the trial asked male participants to “abstain from heterosexual intercourse” while taking the drug, according to the federal government website that tracks clinical trials.OH WELL I WONT BE TAKING IT !!"
"Why buy MRK and lose money, buy XLRN and gain over 4% in the next few weeks."
Just a reminder that MRK used the pill to treat patients that had at least one risk factor and if getting COVID they had a high risk of severe disease! The pill did a great job of of protecting these people. Disregard the naysayers!
MRK SP will plunge into $60.Moderna SP will soar to $480 in 2 weeks

Results were either negative for this and/or due to the very short treatment period required to do the job this is not a concern.Have u seen pics of the mounds of bodies in India at crematoriums due to delta? If u are getting sicker (especially with a pre-existing condition) headed downhill to hospital care, it is ur every right to not take the molnupiravir pill! I take my chances on available data at this point to my likely alternative..."
MRK will dominate the market with COVID-19 pill and this is for all ages. MRK took MRNA/VAX/BNTX/CVAC/DVAX down badly today.
strong pre-market
"The 1st company have the Corona Virus pill. They already sign these contracts with Singapore, New Zeland, Korean, Australia… a lot of countrys waiting sign these contract with MRK… wow next year will see…I mean after Nov /21 meetings day. Good Luck everyone"
"This week, two Indian drugmakers independently testing generic molnupiravir in people with moderate illness due to COVID-19 sought to end their trials because they saw no “significant efficacy” for the experimental drug, although they plan to continue trials for people with mild illness. Merck’s findings, which were disclosed in a press release and have yet to be pored over by scientists and submitted to regulators for approval, applied to people with mild-to-moderate cases of COVID-19 who were not hospitalized. A spokesperson for Merck points out that moderate COVID-19 cases in India are defined as being more severe than in the United States and involve hospitalization."
"From Barrons:""The drugmaker plans to double manufacturing capacity for molnupiravir in 2022, the Financial Times reported. """"The company told the Financial Times it has secured secured deals with Singapore, New Zealand, Australia and South Korea to supply doses in the past week. Merck also said it was in talks with several other governments. """
"So, another discovery of long term impact of Covid 19. Covid causes diabetes in about 15% of those hospitalized with Covid. Diabetes is a costly disease that won't be covered by the Gov't, non-vaxers. The % of those developing diabetes from Covid 19 will likely increase IMO greatly as it has just been discovered as another long term impact/lifelong. I know for a fact that youth (and anyone) can and do die from Diabetes, even when under treatment. Just as with Covid, there is no cure. One has to take Insulin for the rest of your life with Diabetes. Insulin is expensive."
"A lot of FUD going around with regards to the 2 indian drug manufacturers who stopped trials in patients with moderate disease. We are not sure about the kind of patients they picked and if they simply panicked when these patients with moderate disease who were hospitalized patients did not immediately improve. That is quite possible. It is very unlikely that Merck would take such a chance, when there is no need to do so. Read the Ridgeback and UNC paper on their Molnupiravir trial. The only death that occurred was one of the patients who had been administered a placebo. ALL of the patients on Molnupiravir were virus free by day 5, compared to 11.5% people who had virus even after day 5. There does not appear to be doubt about whether it works - safety also does not appear to be an issue. This drug looks like it will be approved considering its effectiveness. You can bet Merck looked at all of the Ridgeback data intensely and minutely before deciding to go ahead. I think its great to get an opportunity to buy MRK below $80. The Acceleron acquisition is an added long term bonus. Merck is committed to making 10 million doses at $700 each, which is about $7B of highly profitable additional revenue. It's a great buy."
We need more FDA approved treatments like Merck's new COVID-19 pill.Channeling Charles Darwin: Just a theory here but I was thinking about the MU variant which may be vaccine resistant. That's bad news. The good news is the DELTA variant appears to out compete the MU variant to the point where the MU variant appears to be disappearing in the USA. Now here is where natural selection theory comes in. If the COVID-19 vaccines inhibit the Delta variant and to a lesser extent inhibits the MU variant then the environment now selects for the MU variant. So there will be a significant decrease in the vaccine protection. Depending on how big the the vaccine effectiveness to DELTA and ineffectiveness to MU variant ratio is we could be going back to square one before vaccines or maybe just a big setback. Just a theory.
"Covid Pills picture and story on front page...only 3 companies with covid pills, merck ADIXT ADTX, and Vaxart.A D T X trades for nothing when it should be above 15.

The chatter here will become extremely positive very soon. Buy now and collect another 10-15% before the end of January. This is the kind of product that appeals to the thinking public. Around 70 Million. Reduces risk and improves outlook both as a profolactic and therapeutic . Thank God for MRK. Safety and it will protect against a host of virus strains. The key to survival is staying out of hospitals. This does a good job of that. No deaths in early testing.
$MRK Merck & Co shares are trading higher after SVB Leerink maintained an Outperform rating on the stock and raised its price target from $101 to $104.
"Another thing that is worrying:This pill aims to let the virus mutate so it cant replicate anymore at some point. As it only works in 50% of cases isnt there a risk that we are creating new covid variants if they manage to ""survive"" that pill and infect other people while being in treatment?"
"NEW DELHI, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Merck & Co's (MRK.N) experimental antiviral drug molnupiravir has not shown ""significant efficacy"" against moderate COVID-19, a source with the Drug Controller General of India said.Aurobindo Pharma Ltd wants to discontinue a late-stage trial of molnupiravir in moderate COVID-19 patients, the regulator's expert committee said on Friday.https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/merck-drug-less-effective-against-moderate-covid-india-regulatory-source-2021-10-08/"
"So, the miss-informers can't keep the stories straight:-One group talks of vaccines making people magnetic, very bad (though untrue)....... A small % of Chiropracters follow the late 1800's founder of Chiropracty and believe the bodies magnetic field must be aligned as well as the spine then the body will heal itself from it's ""intelligence"".-One group talks of vaccines having tracking microchips in them/ they don't want to be tracked.......Yet I see few people without cell phones constantly, which can easily be tracked.Many other two faced issues which just don't make any sense. I believe the more one learns from the most experienced, most recognized/licensed/educated/... the better off one is. The more healthy one is. That leads one to vaccinations and not long term health issues: enlarged heart, lessoned lung capacity, Diabetes,...."
"Have you noticed that all of the extreme left-wingers haven't been talking about how much better Europe's and Canada's healthcare system is to ours lately? Have you noticed that all of the most effective vaccines and therapeutic drugs developed to fight COVID were by AMERICAN companies? America's subsidizes the world when it comes to R&D for new drugs and medical devices, and the rest of the world tells our American companies how much they're willing to pay for it, while Americans pay much more. Had America had the same healthcare system as Europe and Canada, which is what the socialist/marxist/progressive Democrats want, there would literally be MILLIONS more deaths around the world from COVID, cancer, heart disease, etc."
"Get out of Merck and get on to Gilead Sciences. Remdesivir is much better and also works in a differentway to molnupiravir. Remdesivir is a ‘chain terminator’. It stops the enzyme that builds these RNA ‘chains’ from adding further links.""""Gilead Sciences is developing a pill version of remdesivir. And Denison suspects that if the antiviral were given to people as early as molnupiravir is — when symptoms have only just appeared and viral loads are high — it would be similarly effective. In a study presented at IDWeek, a virtual meeting of infectious-disease specialists and epidemiologists held earlier this month, researchers reported results of administering infusions of remdesivir to people in the early stages of COVID-19 every day for three days. The number of participants in the study was small, but remdesivir appeared to reduce hospitalizations by 87% in people at high risk of developing COVID-19."""
What is interesting is that Merck is a $90 + stock without the pill. And of story.The old man.
"What will be the price of MRK after 30 days?????July 13, BNTX was trading around $207.

"$MRK Keytruda with chemo +/- bev approved in 1st line cervical cancer.

If any analyst thinks Merck is going to stop moving up at $85 ...maybe they should not be advising we little people. Nice dividend and more exciting life saving medicine on the way. To me it's safer than my bank and pays a lot more than their cds. It's time to get real.The old man knows.
