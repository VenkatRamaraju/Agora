Quite a drop today. It's interesting how a good article one day results in a drop over the next couple days. it's like we're being set up to buy while the big guys are selling.

It's amazing how a good earning's report will drive down a stock.
"This stock has been in my family since the '40s when it was known as American Machine and Metals. It's always been a winner. It's true that it would rise inprice and then split 2:1 or 3:2 to attract new investors, which is the only reason to split. Don't expect that in the future. There is simply no reason to do it. If you haven't, tune in to the earnings calls, they shed some light on it from time to time."

$$$FACTS$$$THE SAME PEOPLE THAT TOLD YOU TO SELL $GME A WEEK AGO ARE TELLING YOU TO SELL NOW. They said gme would fall back to under $10. Instead it went to over $500. They want you to sell because they are scared. If you all hold? this stock will skyrocket. Shorts will have to cover pushing this stock to the moon. Don’t take small profits. $bb $bbby $nakd $nok $ame
