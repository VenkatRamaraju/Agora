It's awfully quiet in here. What is the reason for the spike?
CHNG share price is now more than 25% below offer price of $25.75. I think investing in Bitcoin now will be the best option now especially with the current rate of the market as it has hit over $60k+ for 1 Bitcoin.
When will we hear from doj?
"Based on today's news, I think it's likely that UNH/CHNG will call off the merger. Also, there was obviously insider trading on this news as the CHNG share price has been declining for the past few weeks"
"After this merger falls through - which i think it will. Reminds of when Walgreens tried to buy RiteAid and the DOJ got involved. Both stocks have since underperformed.With that said, what do we think CHNG is worth? As someone noted below, the share price is falling back to pre-merger levels."
"Nearly two million shares traded in the after-market on Thurs. Stock price was up 3.5% to $23.70. Looks like the deal might be finally coming to fruition. I voted ""Yes"" for my CHNG shares yesterday."
There will be massive selling tomorrow due to fact that virtually 100% of current shareholders purchased shares due to merger.
ipo priced at $13/share
Any updates on the merger with Optum?
"Is there any news on the buyout by UNH? The price action of CHNG is very strange. It's dropped by more than 4% over the past couple weeks. There was a change at the top of UNH, but the new CEO is the former head of Optum who likely would have been involved in the buyout. Very strange."
"See recent comments below from UNH mgmt. It's doubtful the COO of UNH would issue such a statement if he believed DOJ would seek to block the merger.UnitedHealth Group expects its nearly $8 billion acquisition of Change Healthcare to close in early 2022, executives told investors on Thursday. Chief Operating Officer Dirk McMahon said on the company's earnings call that the regulatory process is proceeding apace. ""We continue to work diligently to satisfy regulatory requests and now believe, based on our experience so far, the transaction should close in the first part of 2022,"" he said. ""We are highly energized about the positive impact we can have working together with the exceptional Change team; a team aligned with our mission and values and focused on delivering substantial benefits for the health care system,"" he added. UnitedHealth Group intends to fold Change into its Optum subsidiary, which features a large data analytics arm, OptumInsight. McMahon said that the company believes the combination will allow it to address gaps in care, reduce administrative waste and allow for greater simplicity in healthcare payments. ""Optum and ChangeHealthcare’s capabilities fundamentally are complementary and distinct. Because both companies already successfully serve health plans and state governments, care providers and consumers in a highly competitive market, we believe this combination will make the health care system work better for everyone, and bring exceptional value to those we serve,"" McMahon said."
Time to accumulate. Over 8 percent return in your money in 6 to 9 months at these levels with an extremely high probability of the deal closing. Holding 18000 shares at 23.62 and accumulating more.
"Change Healthcare won a $125,000,000 contract with the US government yesterday and not a word on it?....am I missing something?"
Employee BenefitsAHA urges review of UnitedHealth’s bid to buy Change Healthcare by DOJ
"CHNG share price is now more than 25% below offer price of $25.75. The mkt is signaling strongly the deal won't happen. Expect some kind of press stmt from the DOJ in the coming days. It's my belief that UNH will fight the DOJ in court, esp. after spending nearly 10 mos. working on this merger."
What's the problem here? This 7 billion dollar company is being bought by a 300 billion-dollar company. The stock price is locked in--$25.75 all cash. Seems it should be trading at $25.50.
When and how much is the dividend? Why there are two different tickers for the same company: CHNG and CHNGU? Anybody please?
"Hopefully, with the new prior approval policy implemented at the FTC, this merger will be grandfathered in. Stock is showing some movement."
Down 1.5% today on heavy volume. Something appears to be happening with the buyout.
No comments for several days. Any opinions as to why the stock movement?
