"this company has laid off many workers, good workers too..they are doing whatever needs to be done to stay listed on wallstreet..lets see how earnings will be since (they have been laying off many many workers)glta"
"Is there any news on the buyout by UNH? The price action of CHNG is very strange. It's dropped by more than 4% over the past couple weeks. There was a change at the top of UNH, but the new CEO is the former head of Optum who likely would have been involved in the buyout. Very strange."
CHNGU is up 14.48% to 38.98
Definitely ranks up there as one of the WORST performing IPO's in the past 5 years. This POS can't get out of it's own way. Horrible!
CHNG share price down another 7.4% after hours. Can't find any news. Mkt is saying deal is not happening.
been watching for awhile. I'm small potatoes but I started a small position
Down about 5% in a week...what happened?
Itâ€™s awaken! Look at the volume thus far today / hopefully institutional investors are afoot #Long

This little guy is way undervaluded! Good report despite covid. This is a great long term field to invest in. I saw the opportunity today after the big merger was announced: Telehealth giant Teladoc is acquiring virtual care company Livongo in a deal valued at $18.5 billion
"and as usual chng is moving daily in its usual ratio with naz/Rsl2000 just as Ive said. right garrett, hey where are you? dont worry it's rhetorical lol"
"CHNG is up today, but ""naz"" is down. Bob told us that wouldn't happen. LOL!"
"NIce 225k block buy trade set the tone today. Oh and as usal 'pulled' by the NAZ orbit, ahem. anyway based on recent filings looks like they are still hard at work... I Imagine crafting a deal that will work to put smiles on faces."
CHNGU reached an all time low at 47.91
maybe 1000$??? LoL come on!!
New Morningstar report came out yesterday. Can anyone see if it raised price target? Thx
CHNGU reached an all time low at 45.81
whats different between this and $CHNG? percentage gain is not in lockstep
"Even if UNH/CHNG decide to fight the DOJ in court, CHNG shares will now be dead money for many, many months (if not years) with no guarantee of a court victory. Again, the merger is opposed by almost all healthcare providers who fear lack of competition/lower pymts on claims if Optum acquires CHNG."
"I see the OS is way over than what they had mentioned. On NASDAQ is said 40 Mil, and not it says 110M. Seems scam"
I thought this was the big day on whether the deal would get challenged yet it was just a minor move down. Anyone have any info?
"ISRG is better than TRXC, by the way, not comparison. But left TRXC with nice profits before price tumbled. Old school people on trxc board will tell you how seeking alfa, is just a portal for whomever thinks they know what they're talking about. Lazy week sad vetting over there."

"Nearly two million shares traded in the after-market on Thurs. Stock price was up 3.5% to $23.70. Looks like the deal might be finally coming to fruition. I voted ""Yes"" for my CHNG shares yesterday."
CHNG share price ($21.60) is $4.15 (16%) below UNH offer price ($25.75). CHNG is now trading closer to its pre-announcement level ($18.25) which indicates the mkt believes the deal will not happen.
CHNG should be valued at 40 according to my calculation.

What's the problem here? This 7 billion dollar company is being bought by a 300 billion-dollar company. The stock price is locked in--$25.75 all cash. Seems it should be trading at $25.50.
CHNGU is down 9.02% to 40.26

Adding to my position. I really think they will have a good earnings report. I suggest y'all look into this and think about adding as well. We are hanging around the IPO price... and its a healthcare company and we know this sector makes money...

anyone wish to comment on today's stock action? Thanks
"If this goes to court, a big problem for UNH/CHNG is that almost all healthcare providers oppose the merger. The DOJ will have a wealth of expert witnesses from hospitals, medical groups, etc."
CHNG is up 8.65% to 10.05

"DOJ requested information, so merger timeline will likely be extended depending on how long it takes to respond and how many follow requests come in."

CHNGU is up 13.18% to 37.00
Any opinions of Change Healthcare launching Suite of Solutions to support Virtual Care. It sounds like they are expanding right on time to handle the medical climate changes. This should help the worker morale. I heard morale was down after recent layoffs and news of no raises this year. I think the stock will have make a big jump next week.
"@CHNG---This stock was ""shorted"" 12 million shares. Short covering will bring CHNG price close to $25.75 near term. I will accumulate more CHNG .. or may be CHNG will get another, better price in all CASH offer. PATIENT!!!!!!"

Down 1.5% today on heavy volume. Something appears to be happening with the buyout.
"opens at 16 plus...or higher tomorrow..., everybody's at stock twits...lol....solid company, the market rewards. Congrats to all."
does 16 today and maybe touches 18.. maybe 19. Next week 20's.
what news
CHNGU is down 5.40% to 51.34

Folks... What is the status of the Buyout deal?? Any information on the closing date of the Buyout deal
"Jonathan, Sell it today and keep only 25%. It will drop back to the original. Also in Jan, the market will be unstable. Keep your profit, you will not regret!"
"Institutional buying vs. selling on this stock is extremely good on the buy side. With earnings on Wednesday, I think this is going to put out a great earnings report. It's been a rough ride these past couple months, but Wednesday should make it all worth it."
going red! what a joke

"After this merger falls through - which i think it will. Reminds of when Walgreens tried to buy RiteAid and the DOJ got involved. Both stocks have since underperformed.With that said, what do we think CHNG is worth? As someone noted below, the share price is falling back to pre-merger levels."
CHNG: Will any other health insurance firm step in to out bid United Health Care with this all CASH offer of $25.75. I think the offer all cash deal is too low.
"Well, I guess if CHNG goes below $10 we'll really need to add more. Save some coin for that to happen between now and the next earnings report."
CHNG is down 9.91% to 6.18
CHNG is down 7.61% to 8.25
"Can't find any reasonable explanation as to why CHNG is falling. Insiders are purchasing the stock, CHNG is among the top growing health IT companies, and CHNG has earnings. These are all positive signs that should translate into significant upside potential in the stock. So, what's the problem?"
Did somebody get an advance copy of earnings???Big down gap on Huge volume 2 days before earnings?Something smells fishy.
what is the difference between this and chngu? its seems like they are the same company but 1 is trading at 41$/share?

Anybody know if this Reverse Morris Trust is gonna work out for shareholders of Change Healthcare?
what will CHNG open at?
"Blackstone owns 50%, Really?"
CHNG is down 5.96% to 14.28
What exactly does this company Do?
"I believe this is the last chance here in the upcoming weeks to load at the bottom. After earnings come out this is going to take off. Clients are 1/3 of hospitals in the U.S. at the date of IPO. Healthcare spending has increased 6% compunded annually since 1970. They do carry 5 billion in debt, however that was probably necessary to grow to quickly. I only see upside on this long term pending any changes to the current U.S. healthcare system. https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/06/26/what-you-need-to-know-about-change-healthcares-chng-ipo/#616f900629f8"
this is a hidden gem. won't be surprised if this doubles by year end.
So why isnâ€™t it trading for $25.75?
The only green on my watchlist today
"Credit Suisse reports today 100% close with $650M divestiture to get DOJ ok, as per the agreement. A 60% chance to close without."
Getting back down to a bargain price!
Recently made this my second largest holding. Can't wait to see what happens when people actually catch wind of how big this company is going to be.
"So the Fiscal year ends 3/31/20. They have 50M shares on Float. Currently 30% (~15M shares) short. Since the market is falling and CHNG is going lower albeit slowly, there is a chance not many are covering yet or will until April.When April rolls around and IF they report a great Year and Quarter, this could very well rise in a dramatic fashion. Dig around and do your DD... let me know if you think my theory could be a possibility?"

Time to accumulate. Over 8 percent return in your money in 6 to 9 months at these levels with an extremely high probability of the deal closing. Holding 18000 shares at 23.62 and accumulating more.
"According to press release issued this morning, virtually 100% of CHNG shareholders have approved the buyout. This puts a little pressure on DOJ to approve the merger."
Any updates on the merger with Optum?
"The only action at this point is to accumulate shares while the stock price is low. And when the ""market"" notice this hidden gem, you'll be ahead of the curve. I beleive that is what the insider, August Calhoun, is thinking."

CHNG--- Just look at the top 10 institution holdings.... 102.67% . Feel bad for whoever short this stock...
As a customer of change I'd have to say avoid this stock. Most of their apps only support IE. They have no timeline on upgrading their systems. They are also the only vendor out of many others being used that didn't make plans for updating their apps to use other browser when end of life for IE was announced in 2019. I'm not shorting this and nor do I own any shares. I'm just letting investors know my experience as a customer. Honestly I hope they see this and tell customers when they will support other browsers. Just be cautious because if I ran an application company I would have been ready for IEs end of life in 2020.
Big short squeeze coming 38% of float is short. https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/chng
"So the ""naz"" is down by 142 pts, but CHNG stock price is up. Huh? I don't get it. Despite the pending buyout offer, Bob told us the price action was linked. LOL!"
Great conference call - very positive and upbeat tone. The word I focused on was growth and they used it a lot. Expect a few analyst upgrades next week. We should retest 17 in the near term - 2 or 3 weeks. Way undervalued at these levels.

When and how much is the dividend? Why there are two different tickers for the same company: CHNG and CHNGU? Anybody please?
So when will the merger be done? How much do we get per share??
How's everyone doing here? Hope you and your family are healthy and doing well.Hope you have been adding to your position.
why is this down so much today?
Just what I was looking for. It's only going to get better from here. Congrats to the ones who stuck through the hard times.
