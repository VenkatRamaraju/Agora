ok- not too bad of a report and good growth outlook. I'll be adding more as it goes down :)
Any opinions of Change Healthcare launching Suite of Solutions to support Virtual Care. It sounds like they are expanding right on time to handle the medical climate changes. This should help the worker morale. I heard morale was down after recent layoffs and news of no raises this year. I think the stock will have make a big jump next week.
Not looking good for now

"The DOJ has a high success rate in blocking mergers it deems anti-competitive. If this goes to court, DOJ will likely prevail."
So why isn’t it trading for $25.75?
"Hey All - we are getting close to going to 9.99 and under.... keep a sharp eye, set some price triggers and be ready to buy a little more. Especially if your avg is above $10/share.Health-Tech is a good thing. Also check out RCM GLTA"
Looking forward to a good report tomorrow!
"""Naz"" is down by more than 1%, but CHNG is up. What happened? Where's Bob? LOL!"
"I believe this is the last chance here in the upcoming weeks to load at the bottom. After earnings come out this is going to take off. Clients are 1/3 of hospitals in the U.S. at the date of IPO. Healthcare spending has increased 6% compunded annually since 1970. They do carry 5 billion in debt, however that was probably necessary to grow to quickly. I only see upside on this long term pending any changes to the current U.S. healthcare system. https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2019/06/26/what-you-need-to-know-about-change-healthcares-chng-ipo/#616f900629f8"
"Nearly 4x volume today plus a very high short volume, and all it dropped was 2%. Very strong performance"
Good news: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2020-06-05/change-healthcare-launches-covid-19-analytic-service-video
It’s awaken! Look at the volume thus far today / hopefully institutional investors are afoot #Long
"Is there any news on the buyout by UNH? The price action of CHNG is very strange. It's dropped by more than 4% over the past couple weeks. There was a change at the top of UNH, but the new CEO is the former head of Optum who likely would have been involved in the buyout. Very strange."
"I see the OS is way over than what they had mentioned. On NASDAQ is said 40 Mil, and not it says 110M. Seems scam"
"and as usual chng is moving daily in its usual ratio with naz/Rsl2000 just as Ive said. right garrett, hey where are you? dont worry it's rhetorical lol"
CHNG is down 9.44% to 10.07
"Change Healthcare won a $125,000,000 contract with the US government yesterday and not a word on it?....am I missing something?"
"Valuation is rich compared to competitors HQY and HCAT. To be comparable, CHNG will have to drop to 9s or 10s."
"Can't find any reasonable explanation as to why CHNG is falling. Insiders are purchasing the stock, CHNG is among the top growing health IT companies, and CHNG has earnings. These are all positive signs that should translate into significant upside potential in the stock. So, what's the problem?"
Anybody know if this Reverse Morris Trust is gonna work out for shareholders of Change Healthcare?
"The only action at this point is to accumulate shares while the stock price is low. And when the ""market"" notice this hidden gem, you'll be ahead of the curve. I beleive that is what the insider, August Calhoun, is thinking."
When and how much is the dividend? Why there are two different tickers for the same company: CHNG and CHNGU? Anybody please?
CHNG is up 5.22% to 14.30

Any updates on the merger with Optum?
As a customer of change I'd have to say avoid this stock. Most of their apps only support IE. They have no timeline on upgrading their systems. They are also the only vendor out of many others being used that didn't make plans for updating their apps to use other browser when end of life for IE was announced in 2019. I'm not shorting this and nor do I own any shares. I'm just letting investors know my experience as a customer. Honestly I hope they see this and tell customers when they will support other browsers. Just be cautious because if I ran an application company I would have been ready for IEs end of life in 2020.
what news
CHNG is down 10.31% to 10.26
been watching for awhile. I'm small potatoes but I started a small position

Did change report earnings today?
Hey. Just started a position... I'm thinking this company will do well over the next three quarters- Thoughts?
CHNG is down 5.40% to 15.25
"this company has laid off many workers, good workers too..they are doing whatever needs to be done to stay listed on wallstreet..lets see how earnings will be since (they have been laying off many many workers)glta"
It's awfully quiet in here. What is the reason for the spike?
"Based on today's news, I think it's likely that UNH/CHNG will call off the merger. Also, there was obviously insider trading on this news as the CHNG share price has been declining for the past few weeks"
The only green on my watchlist today
"This company has most likely handled everybodys doctor, dental, optomoligist , any health related appt, these are the people behind the systems. This is a massive profitable company. Shorts without due diligence will hurt in the pocket book, then come onto thr board and 'try' to scare people."
Definitely ranks up there as one of the WORST performing IPO's in the past 5 years. This POS can't get out of it's own way. Horrible!
"After this merger falls through - which i think it will. Reminds of when Walgreens tried to buy RiteAid and the DOJ got involved. Both stocks have since underperformed.With that said, what do we think CHNG is worth? As someone noted below, the share price is falling back to pre-merger levels."
"Even if UNH/CHNG decide to fight the DOJ in court, CHNG shares will now be dead money for many, many months (if not years) with no guarantee of a court victory. Again, the merger is opposed by almost all healthcare providers who fear lack of competition/lower pymts on claims if Optum acquires CHNG."
What exactly does this company Do?
Massive amount of shares dumped at close. Anyone know whats going on? First it was unusual activity with the 12.50 puts and now seems like some institution is dumping shares over the past few days.
"I'll say I'm very happy CHNG stayed over $14 today, that shows good support above $14."

No comments for several days. Any opinions as to why the stock movement?
this is a hidden gem. won't be surprised if this doubles by year end.
CHNG should be valued at 40 according to my calculation.
Great conference call - very positive and upbeat tone. The word I focused on was growth and they used it a lot. Expect a few analyst upgrades next week. We should retest 17 in the near term - 2 or 3 weeks. Way undervalued at these levels.
anyone wish to comment on today's stock action? Thanks
CHNG share price ($21.60) is $4.15 (16%) below UNH offer price ($25.75). CHNG is now trading closer to its pre-announcement level ($18.25) which indicates the mkt believes the deal will not happen.
"NIce 225k block buy trade set the tone today. Oh and as usal 'pulled' by the NAZ orbit, ahem. anyway based on recent filings looks like they are still hard at work... I Imagine crafting a deal that will work to put smiles on faces."
Back under $10.Time to add a little more. Bring your avg down.

Getting back down to a bargain price!
What's the problem here? This 7 billion dollar company is being bought by a 300 billion-dollar company. The stock price is locked in--$25.75 all cash. Seems it should be trading at $25.50.
Cannot buy from robinhood
"I can not figure out how come CHNG issued 42,857,142 (42.857 millions) common shares in IPO but Institutional holdings is a lot more than those numbers. Blackstone group owns 59, 620, 253 (59.62 millions) whereas all others are holding more than 25 millions as per the latest filings 13F."
"Good opportunity to put in your ""savings"" and pick up 11% within 3-4 months..."
Change Healthcare is up 10.20% to 11.73
Adding to my position. I really think they will have a good earnings report. I suggest y'all look into this and think about adding as well. We are hanging around the IPO price... and its a healthcare company and we know this sector makes money...
"So the ""naz"" is down by 142 pts, but CHNG stock price is up. Huh? I don't get it. Despite the pending buyout offer, Bob told us the price action was linked. LOL!"
"Jonathan, Sell it today and keep only 25%. It will drop back to the original. Also in Jan, the market will be unstable. Keep your profit, you will not regret!"
Nice
what is the difference between this and chngu? its seems like they are the same company but 1 is trading at 41$/share?
CHNGU reached an all time high at 62.44
gonna 15 bfore close lol
"So the Fiscal year ends 3/31/20. They have 50M shares on Float. Currently 30% (~15M shares) short. Since the market is falling and CHNG is going lower albeit slowly, there is a chance not many are covering yet or will until April.When April rolls around and IF they report a great Year and Quarter, this could very well rise in a dramatic fashion. Dig around and do your DD... let me know if you think my theory could be a possibility?"
