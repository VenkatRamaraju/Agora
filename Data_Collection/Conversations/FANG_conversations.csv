"With FANG we may trade on WTIs movement a lot but at these prices, FANG gets nothing more from it because the hedges are too low EXCEPT for the opportunity to lock in higher hedges later. They've already done some of that for 2022 so the best is yet to come. Long hold. But, but.. they need to continue to add hedges at even higher ceiling prices so we can finally take advantage of this upward movement. If we get oil over 100 for an extended period and we're stuck in the 60s-70s WTI I'm going to be #$%$ Once in a lifetime opportunity perhaps may go to waste."
"Listen to Alli McCartney UBS Financial Wealth Advisor this am, statement was, volatility ahead, oil marches higher, their buying oil, also said her husband was in Australia and demand will pick up there significantly."
I could give two s**ts about this quarters earnings. Maybe they will surprise...maybe not. Honestly don't care. I didn't buy this for now. Laredo is in a transition stage. I bought this for mid/long term. 2022 & beyond. Oil is staying high for the foreseeable future. You can take that to the bank. I want to see what they have to say for hedge prices & percentage that is being hedged. 2022 has potential to be a monster year for LPI. If natural gas stays high as well that is just icing on the cake. $LPI $CPE $FANG $CVX
"this comment is for my friend Don, our ultimate bull. 9-28-21 Jeff Currie, Head of Global Commodities Research for Goldman Sachs, regarding oil, stated, ""this is only the first inning of a multi year, potentially decade long, commodity super cycle."" I think he then dropped the mike and walked off."
"as I've shared, I've been concerned about the taper, so I've liquidated my oil stocks over the past few days in my non taxable IRA. seeing cvx n xom earning beats encourages me that fang will beat on mon + WTI rising, and all your positive expectations, I just bought 2,000 shares of fang hoping for a pop on monday. do we report before or after the bell?"
"Phil Flynn, Price Futures Group, we’re on track to $88.00 a barrel by end of the year and $100.00 a barrel first half next year."
"Humors me when the MM's are trying to steal my shares. Strong Fundamentals, Strong Price & Momentum are on Oil & Gas's side. Cash Cows right now. Until that changes......  $CPE $LPI $FANG $CVX $XOM"
Fang had hedges in place to provide downside protection on 50% of its expected 2021 production at a weighted average price of $38.13.Per AOGR
"Has anyone heard of a financial news and research newsletter called Energy and Capital? They're saying that oil will top out at $85 this year and the price will drop further next year. But they also like the Oils a lot for next year because they're saying demand will surge next year. So anyway, with all that said, they like the Oils and they're recommending Diamondback Energy as their number one Oil pick for 2022."
"Dan Niles, awesome hedge fund mgr, loves oil n banks; called them a year ago. Recently went to cash bc of taper announcement on 11/3. He manages billions of dollars very successfully. Said he will buy back oil lower after the taper reset. Any opinions on this?"
"Good take on why recent inventory builds from rigzone. “The real surprise to me is that refining utilization remains well below the 90 percent norm for this time of year, dropping in the latest week to 85 percent, despite gasoline demand remaining surprisingly strong. The only explanation to me is the backwardation of the market now - i.e. longer-dated oil being cheaper than prompt - which allows refiners to delay delivery of the crude they need for producing gasoline, diesel and other stuff. It’s a tricky hedge. The market could continue rising and even the backwardated contracts may get costlier than they are now. But refiners are still taking the gamble and that explains why you have such drawdowns particularly in gasoline week after week while crude inventories have piled up by a net 17 million barrels over the past five weeks."
I'm calling a buy. I think we move higher to 120 or beyond in next few weeks
I expect a big reversal either later today or on Monday prior to ER.
FANG now carries a Zacks Rank #1.
"Dollar falling today a good bit, giving support to oil price"
Cramer works for the hedges so anything he says is solely to benefit them…the morning dip was a gift for them to keep trying to pull it down and buy more…Winter is coming and so are higher oil prices
Japan Utilities switching to oil as LNG prices soar.....and so it begins. $LPI $CPE $CVX $FANG
"Per Bloomberg -""Crude oil could justifiably trade to the next level higher on the storage drought at Cushing alone,” said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA. “Forget about fuel switching, whether OPEC+ adds additional barrels, or dollar weakness: if Cushing continues to slide, it could get ugly quickly.”The rapid depletion of Cushing signals just how tight global oil supplies are and threatens to drive prices even higher from their current levels. Surging oil prices are already driving costs up for road fuel, freight activity and air travel and stoking inflation just as many countries are only just recovering from the pandemic-driven economic slump.At the current rate of draws it could be just weeks away from Cushing being effectively out of crude, JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts including Natasha Kaneva said in a report."
"I guess we find out Monday if the dividend goes up, how many shares they are repurchased and what the special payment might be to shareholders…nice holiday cash coming"
dont be afraid Raymond James boosted the price today from 125 to $165 a share and Mizuho upgraded from 127 to $148 only a start this will be $200 before next summer
