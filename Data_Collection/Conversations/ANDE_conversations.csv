Commodities( grain, gold, oil) are all lining up to follow in the footsteps of an extremely overbought equity market. What goes up on Wall Street, MUST come down and those sectors that have been so long beaten down will, as always, go back up. ANDE ? $50-$60-$70 . We'll see.GLTA."

Les Anderson's should be at least $10.00 higher. it's a very good diversified stock.

"NEWS ""Among the major funding details released Tuesday, $700 million will go to biofuel producers. The ethanol industry clamored for aid last year as demand for liquid fuel crashed during government shutdowns. Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, said the group is pleased with Tuesday's announcement and that the relief will come over the next two months.""reported in Farmers DTN news feedMY GUESS...

"Just when it looked like the ag sector was heading for an upswing some tragic things have set up circumstances for a Perfect Storm. Ag exports in the tank, farmers can't even plant their seed, let alone fertilize and spray( always said to be much worse than a drought), what corn is available will go up in price hurting ethanol producers( who are not hedged) badly. I sincerely hope I'm wrong, but the clouds are gathering on the horizon. Farmers who elect not to plant at all( under crop insurance provisions) will set off a dearth of row crop supplies not seen since the Payment in Kind(PIK) days in 1983 and even the Carter grain embargo of the Soviets in 1980. Ancient history ? Just watch."

"Okay, it's definitely RISK ON regarding ANDE. This company has endured a lot and is still kicking butt in a number of areas. The synergies, geographic and otherwise, of the LANSING acquisition are substantial. The discipline and execution in Ethanol is best in class. The Trading Group's very name proves how this unit has reinvented itself for the future. Nutrients just has lived in a bad neighborhood for a while. I am going to start loading up at these prices and with these prospects. ANDE and agribusiness in general will once again rule in this ""bubbledom"", foo foo dust equity environment. Cheers."

"Any kind of normal weather this spring will put ANDE on path for normal(historical) earnings. With the added punch of the rail and ethanol programs, this year will see major growth in earnings.

I think it is a takeover target.
"Anderson's will now start the climb back to 23-25. excellent planting season, ethanol plants back up-cars, planes moving, railcars moving that need repair, fertilizer, etc. You are stupid to not buy now after hanging in for the last 3.5 months. Go Anderson's."

As Eastern Cornbelt weather and marketing patterns normalize, ANDE will show considerable strength with all its drying and storage, blending and handling capabilities. Ethanol will nicely moving forward. Nutrients will show their value prop. Rail has a nice nitch but the rail industry is volatile indeed.I'm bullish ANDE . GLTA."

"Ballot123 you are all over the place, first you say ANDE is going to 50-60-70 a share then you say the ship is sinking. Commodity market is a #$%$ shoot but the Andersons buy of the Lansing Trade Group was a huge buy. Yes it added a ton debt to the bottom line but will be back to the $40-$50 range in 3 year or even more. Anyone that likes ANDE has to buy on the lows and highs of the Trump China trade show. This reason uptick will be wiped out by Trump evoking China again. I will be buying more when that happens. This trade war thing wont be gone in early next yr when election comes into play. GLTA"
"I know I can be over enthusiastic, but I’ve traded Ande since the 90’s through blowouts and droughts. We all know that commodities cycle for at least 10 year periods. Ag has been a non starter for well over 13 years now. It’s time is near. Back in the 70’s the world went on a food buying binge. That was “expansion”. . Now the world needs food and energy for survival. The political pressure to feed people is immense. ANDE and the entire ag complex will soon be back....soon. Take your gold profits and invest in Ag , the next big trend IMHO."
Andersons is up 8.91% to 19.80
"This is definitely not a 'sell' stock IMHO. The markets are sucking air right now, almost to the very, very top( just like mountain climbing, the air is very thin up here and will not sustain life). Commodities of all types, agribusinesses, farming will all experience a total reversal soon. GLTA."
"Richard bought in a few days ago. I bought in back in 1973 when ANDE was a limited partnership. All the star are lining uo in the heavens for agribusiness and ANDE going forward. World droughts and food shortages,international demand for grain and grain products, major growth trends for production agriculture in ANDE's service territories, huge national and international emphasis on renewable, low emission fuels(ethanol and biodiesel), and lastly the efficiencies and need for rail cargo logistics. The agribusiness sector has been ""risk off"" way beyond traditional 10-12 year cycles. Agribusiness is a ""dirt and rocks"" type of business. ""Pounds on the ground"" type of business, but when it returns to favor it all turns to GOLD. "" there is nothing more worthless than an excess bushel of grain. There is nothing more valuable than the last bushel."" Did anyone notice the scope of the extreme drought map in the U.S.....in the World ?"
"Look at the Yahoo Target Price and the Fair Value Meter for ANDE. Just look at it, and tell us what you see. This stock is so oversold and underrated , it's ridiculous. Do me a favor and VISIT an Anderson facility. Then tell me what this stock is priced where it is. Lemmings in the AG sector investment community ! As the world becomes a more precarious place and as the stock market revels in ""bubble"" territory, we all know where commodities and well-run basic materials/service companies will end up...UP."

"As I look back to my ""doom and gloom"" comments of last May/early June, I'm much more encouraged by weather, crop sizes, etc. Maybe we needed an ""off year"" to better balance the supply/demand tables. At least, it won't be catastrophic for ethanol or famers as well. Also doesn't look like an ""early"" frost...maybe the opposite. We'll see."
Personally i think this stock is a great value buy now. I think it’s washed out far enough. Could we go another $1 lower maybe.. but we are to a point one wants to step in and own it
the chart on this is looking very good. I could see this pop for 10 to 20 percent in less than a week.
