"Something that has not been mentioned is that the CNopy Growth 1 year contract is up this month. Question being, do they renew and or expand the arrangement? Finding a new partner seems very unlikely. Still would’ve good to get renewal confirmation- Canopy gives a ton of credibility to CLVR"
"holding chart low 8.02 VERY NICE! this could be the double bottom we need! Maybe sub 7 isnt coming because Kyle was smart and braced us for the ER which was better than i was expecting because Kyle braced us I was expecting much worse. usually if a CEO braces investors for a sub par er it is a disaster, this is a fine looking er to me all things considered."
"Like clockwork, MMs took it to 9.85 same low as before. its is official in my book... the double bottom has arrived. wooohoooo"
everything Kyle braced us for. probably see sub 8
Lol #$%$ happened to everyones comments for the last month
"way oversold, like clockwork this runs over 9.50 in a day or two. making lower lows and lower highs, clear bear market but then it goes back up to $10 range in a day. flip central with potential. GREAT COMBO"
What happened to CLVR today?
Why CLVR is so weak today?

I know- been lousy few days for longs --- I just added a bit more. Will continue to accumulate. I see thisas a good bet mid to long term. I'm patient - like the management team and strategy. Not shaken by recent pullback.. D
"All I know is that there is no reason for any company to deliberately lower its guidance while holding a large number of orders. I think the actual rev in the first quarter may be very unoptimistic, good luck for long-term."

Couple of big blocks lit a fire in early trading. Let’s see if we get some follow through and hopefully some scared shorts covering.
"I am no expert. Thus, this is my non-expert opinion.Blue chips and the indexes are up. It has pretty consistently looked like cannabis stocks get beaten up when those stocks are up. My theory is that the large players go to the more thinly-traded, volatile stocks, and work those markets when the large, less-volatile stocks are marching up. Right now, there is also the pressure to offset gains with losses, so some is the pressure from smaller traders taking losses.I watch/own about a half-dozen cannabis stocks. They're all getting beaten up today, all (best I can tell) for no reason. I try to keep some powder dry so I can buy during these dips. I get more powder by automatically selling some when it goes up from the bottom by a reasonable amount. That being said, I missed the bottom on VFF today; it didn't go as low as my limit.$APHA $CLVR $TCNNF"

I will have to sell a portion to buy $TLRY.
you all better wake up when prices start dropping sector wide and industry-wide for no reason and I'm saying no reason other than laddered short attacks that means something big is around the corner we all know the news is coming we all know Schumer is piecing it together big money is ladder attacking this for everyone to get in and people like you who are scared selling your longer positions and taking your losses are going to regret it
What are people’s thoughts on what the extra cash is being used for? Here is my take:Clever Leaves (CLVR) Raise $200m - But what for? https://youtu.be/-UwdfDIq_v0
Why is going lower and lower?
Guys its Eddie I spoke to clever IR today and they basically said that the revenue guide down from 57 mil in presentation over the summer to 17-20 mil on earnings call was due to a few factors and they said covid was a big one.... I know thats BS and I suggest anyone who has shares get out now before its too late.... this stock can go to 5 before it goes back to 18.... If you have a 5 year time horizon could be a big winner but I know most people dont
I think I can buy some at my target price.
https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/professionally-cannabis/id1462643626?i=1000525862843
anyone know what caused the jump yesterday?
"CC mentions the ""Colombian government’s new decree allowing the export of medical cannabis flower from the country, a historic milestone that has the potential to double our total addressable market. With our Colombian cultivation already EU GMP certified for dry flower production, and significant greenhouse capacity already constructed, we believe we are well positioned to leverage our experience in flower sales from our Portuguese operation to capitalize on this regulatory development. We look forward to leveraging our operational advantages as we prepare to add this latest offering to our international product portfolio"".Strange that guidance seems unaffected... ""The Company continues to believe that it is on track to achieve its 2021 plan. Revenue is expected to be between $17 million to $20 million""."
For some perspective on the power of the institutional shorts holding CLVR down look no further than pharmacielo. PCLO is our chief Columbian competitor and it is up about 50% in the last 5 days based on this flower export legalization news.
Not sure if this is the end of the pain why cant this stock go to $6.... they just guided 60% lower for revenue than was in their investor presentation
CLEVER ON A ROLL if we get similar volume/interest as the other pot stocks this stock will fly to 40’s-50’sWe still only had 158 mil dollars in volume yesterday which means their were mostly buyers.... If we get big money into the stock will be FLYING$clvr $sndl $tlry $acb $chc $apha
I’m now so used to the price going down that now I’m wondering why up today
So they have double the revenue of companies that have 10 times the market cap??? that's what I see..
EVERYONE WITH A BRAIN KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN TODAY
CLVR great takeover target.
Well they got a deal done.
"Despite ACB terrible earnings release the international medical cannabis segment had excellent top line YoY growth of 134% and was one of the few bright spots in their report. Hopefully this bodes well for the future of the main markets CLVR is pursuing. I had a quick look at the original analyst presentation from August 2020 and one thing that really jumped out to me was the pipeline opportunities listed. Pharma was only one of many potential downstream partners yet so far that is really the only partnerships so far being announced. As I’ve lamented often here, while pharma is great foe sticky contracts these are very slow to realize revenue opportunities. I’m hoping the sales team is making many in roads with quicker to market downstream opportunities listed in their potential pipeline (global cannabis, nutraceutical or cosmetics companies, other retail cpgpartners). All imo"
"doji Hammer was bearish that's the thing about doji hammers, they're either going to be a massive move north are they going to be bearish and just continue to move South which usually tells me we're going to drop at least another dollar looks like we're forming one more stair step down until we can actually get some good earnings which this report will be increased earnings but overall I think it's going to be negative they have already braced us for that months ago."
Shares short as of 6/15 was 2.12M shares. With recent daily volume around 150k. That equates to around 14 days of volume to cover. Any significant news event or catalyst could seriously light a fire. On the flip side argument there appears to be a ton of institutional money betting against this sector. Usually big money is on the right side of most trades so it’s certainly a sign for caution for the bulls. I did read recently that the Columbian government may soon be ruling on the ability for companies to sell and export dried flower which would be a huge deal for CLVR.
I am committing the cardinal sin these days... I am holding thru earnings... Maybe this time will be different.
trash stock
"21/05 a huge puts will expire. If the option is exercised, there will be a short sale of nearly 500,000 shares."
We really need WSB pump. The float is small enough and business is sound. It's even better than GME in every way.
this is the only #$%$ deep in the red today. waiting on a catalyat instead of organic growth is not the right strategy for me. give mr 1 more pump so i can cut. f this stock.
"Verdemed could be a promising partnership for CLVR. They have two generic alternatives to GW pharmaceutical for treating epilepsy and MS. And they are going into Chile and Mexico on top of Brazil, Columbia and Peru... so definitely added expansion to this partnership if it goes well."

Buy at $8 again.
gotta love the ladder attack by MMs right now. lots of 100 until they want to let it climb again. This stock is sooo predictable
"The new 2021 production quota authorizes Clever Leaves to extract medical cannabis and the total quantity allocated to their company is forecasted to be sufficient towards meeting the aggregate international demand for Clever Leaves’ products. To date, Clever Leaves has successfully exported to more than 15 countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, the Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, Israel, Netherlands, New Zealand, Perú, Poland, Spain, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States.“We are extremely satisfied with the quota that we have been awarded for 2021 and would like to thank the Colombian government and all entities involved for their continued support. We are very proud of the positive economic impact that we have made in Colombia, and we greatly value the partnerships that we have created with local and global regulatory agencies, governments, and businesses which have fueled our ability to create quality medical cannabis products, and in turn, improve the lives of many patients around the world,” said Kyle Detwiler, CEO of Clever Leaves."
"$HITI $SNDL $CLVR $CRON Sundial is trading for more than 45x price/sales, Cleaver Leaves is trading around 20x Price/Sales & Cronos is trading for more than 50x price/sales while high tide is trading for less than 2x p/s.

2021 annual meeting of stockholders at jun 29. I think the company is the 10X return in the next 3 years.
Why the drop today?
"Short volume was 650K shares on Friday, close to 34% of the volume and the highest since the stock has traded. So some big money is lining up against this move."
"TURNING GREEN! bulls taking charge. this is heavily shorted play bc its a SPAC. looks like shorts lose again! wait, or did they win because they drive the price down, buy more and ride it back up? lol. clockwork. predictable. long term they know this is $30-$40 stock in 1-2 years with peak high around $63"
Daily volume has collapsed which is a strange coincidence as that perfectly lines up with a very small amount of shares available to short. Currently just 60k shares available. And yet these guys still manage to short just enough each day to carefully “manage” the share price. They’ve successfully wrung out any enthusiasm in the shares as longs wait for a catalyst. The overall market is beginning to look vulnerable to a sell off. My hope is that’s not the catalyst the shorts are piled in for. Anyone else have thoughts on this?
This is the diamond in the haystack at this price
United States is flooded #$%$ $80 an ounce 24% THC has no need or no plans to import marijuana cannabis
FWIW the daily chart is showing a significant money flow divergence on that recent low reached post earnings. The last time the stock behaved similarly was at the end of January right before the February run up. Certainly not saying it does that again but considering how poorly the stock has performed since the mid February highs I’ll take any positive signs of life...
New York officials reach agreement to legalize marijuana
WAY oversold
"Not sure how accurate Fintel actually is but they are currently showing no shares available to short. Since short sellers represent upwards of 20 to 30% of daily volume, id Fintel is accurate then the shorts may not be as dominant without available shares to push the price down."
Top performers today $CLVR $XL and $MP all under valued recent SPAC mergers. Merry Christmas!
all major cannabis companies hitting lows for the year do you think this is a coincidence? right before Schumer is about to make some serious changes and he's already announced that he's going to do that yet all of the major cannabis companies going down? put in a buy order watch your lots go they go in lots of 100. the MMS are playing games
Well my grandson alerted me to this company. I got 1000 shares at 12.09 today which I think is a very low price for a company with this upside. I am hoping that even if earnings aren't phenomenal we get some analyst coverage and a price target.
all after hour trades were in TINY amount. 1-10 shares maybe upwards of 20. THIS IS MMs playing games walking the price down... then you see a REAL trade after hours for thousands of shares. open up your eyes people! this will go back up faster than it fell... you watch. been falling from $13-14 for weeks... because they walked the price down and let this get in at 9.85-9.99... it will go to $12-14 in one day. you watch.
Spac financial projections of $57M for ‘21E vs updated 17-20M.Why the guidance gap is so large.
"Schumer is introducing legalization ""soon"" . they can now do it thru budget reconciliation. they only need 50 votes. Indirectly but yet directly that was ruled on earlier this week. Aamazing as soon as that was announced pot stocks go down??? Its a 60 billion dollar annual market at a minimum."
chart looking good! this is volatile that's for sure. we should see a spike up with news
Flora just dropped below Clever 
shares about to jump back in the $12 range
"Double Bottom IS IN! look at 1 month chart, low is 9.85 and we hit low of day at 9.85. Only way this hits new double bottom to make this NOT the double bottom is dropping to $8.09 and I dont see that happening. This is a real company doing it right legally and being patient. They are looking for aquisitions and have cash on hand to weather storm until Schumer makes Medical MJ Legal in which CLVR has already said they will enter into USA once that happens and NASDAQ removes barrier. They are selling THC worldwide where they can and will continue to market dominate due to their cost of production being astronomically cheaper than ANY of the competition. EVEN CGC Canopy Growth acknowledged this. GO CLVR!!!!"
"This is going to be BIG, I am getting more shares."
Gonna catch this knife. Wish me luck!
Not to mention market REALLY LIKED THE ER REPORT and spiked when most in sector dumped after ER reports. THATS A GREAT SIGN as we will see many pot stocks instantly go away in the coming years.

Fuel cell energy is the under the radar new #$%$ stock. FCEL to hell not to the moon. Selling this and dumping all my money to lose to fcel
Loooooooow volume. Needs catalyst or slow bleed. Will still buy dip GLTA
Pre market bubbling nicely
Oof my calls
As per my interactive brokers account its over 50% rebate rate which means this thing is heavily shorted... which means if they announce something good on earnings can see a massive pop
This is an amazing company with great fundamentals. Sellers will be crying in about a month
STRONG SUPPORT at $10.10 this will bounce very fast to $12 approx imo
"I’ve sat through doldrums before with APHA and still made it out with a profit. My one mistake was not averaging down more. Won’t make it again with this one. Good company here, who operates in legal-regulated markets and which I believe will weather the storm. Guess we’ll have to wait and see, and until then I’ll buy the dip."
under $10 again! what a gift. thank you!!
pure rubbish!!!!!!!!
"look at the real time trades... this is clearly a group of people trying to accumulate. WSB? not MMs right now... MMs are helping but someone is quietly loading. they walk it down 100 at a time and in after hours only 10-20 at a time then when they see the volume is there they strike with a 500 or 700 or 1700 buy order. dont believe me, go watch the real time quotes. when this is over, most likely today, we should see a rise up tomorrow and end the week with a green day for a solid next week. Someone has accumulated a TON of shares. THOUSANDS and THOUSANDS"
This is a serious question not trying to troll. Isn't this stock tied to Columbia? Maybe I'm remembering the country wrong but definitely something I need to consider if I were going to buy some shares
Buy at $8.
All things considered its holding up well today
"Clever Leaves Holdings Inc., a leading multi-national operator and licensed producer of pharmaceutical-grade cannabinoids, today announced an agreement with Verdemed Holdings Inc. (“Verdemed”), a Latin American pharmaceutical cannabis company based in Toronto, Canada, to supply finished CBD products for the Brazilian and Peruvian markets. The initial portfolio of products includes finished formulations of CBD oral solutions with different concentrations used for different indications.Verdemed supplies cannabis products in Brazil under the compassionate use model and has submitted applications to register finished products in Brazil and Peru. The products manufactured under this partnership will be registered as pharmaceutical products and sold into distribution channels such as pharmacies and drugstores.Verdemed is an important player in the Brazilian market with existing access to patients and is well-positioned to tackle the high regulatory hurdles in Brazil and Peru. This partnership expands Clever Leaves’ presence in one of the largest markets in South America,” said Kyle Detwiler, CEO of Clever Leaves. “We are committed to increasing access for the millions of patients within the growing Brazilian and Peruvian markets, and they will soon have access to the high-quality products we produce thanks to Verdemed’s network.Partnering with Clever Leaves aligns with Verdemed’s mission to offer the best cannabinoid products to all Latin Americans, said José Bacellar, CEO of Verdemed. Clever Leaves products meet all of the regulatory and product quality standards in each of our key markets, and their EU GMP and INVIMA GMP certifications distinguish their products and bring higher value to patients.The Brazilian and Peruvian markets are expanding, and it is estimated that the Brazilian medical cannabis user base could reach close to 3 million people in the next few years. According to Prohibition Partners, with a population of 32 million, Peru’s medical cannabis market is estimated to be worth approximately $100 million. As of September 2020, almost 8,000 patients were registered in the DIGEMID, Peru’s drug regulatory authority database."
Not a conspiracy guy but SUCH A SCAM they deleted everyones comments for the last 30 days!!! They dont want you to buy this goldmind of a stock until they can get it for cheaper!!!
Gap down and very low volume sell off. 12.50 to 12.75 needs to hold or this gets ugly yet again possibly going back into the 11s. Is it just me or does it seem like this stock is super easy to manipulate.
The party's just getting started. The sellers are exhausted
The political situation in Colombia is my only reservation rn

"No news, no shares."
I understand the cannabis and psychedelics sector is on fire....but why did $CLVR in particular go up?
One could actually consider today a double bottom confirmation at $9. last $9 was feb 2021. moving day avg was significantly higher than sp (such as right now) and william %R and RSI was extremely oversold too (just like now). THen it went from $9 to $19 in a very short time. WE ARE GOING TO TEST NEW ALL TIME HIGHS SOON! jmho
"90,000 shares at 0.16! Staying long, my next long investment is Clever Leaves $CLVR, a multinational Cultivation company that can produce for $0.20/Gram, located in B.C!!!"
Today is the day to buy call options I will let you know exactly what I buy and how much... will buy probably 12.5 and 15’s
Buy 2K shares in $10.And I will buy more if it goes down.
Low volume wow
"Here are my 2 cents 4 CLVR…First, the market cap for this company is some where around 270 million+…It’s still very small in comparison to other public owned companies. Well, Clever Leaves is relatively small company now means a lot of growth potentials from here on. Also, it’s an easy take over target for other companies. There are so many potential catalysts for growth but I think the CL’s focuses on the medical cannabis will be the biggest winner their future and the investors. The reason is simply do to the company like Clever Leaves medical studies going to find many great medical usages for the cannabis plants. It will generate tons of great news in the future. I am sure some of you already know what they are…"
"Someone has bought 5700(3.88M) put in 21/03/16, strike 20, expiration 21/04/16 PUT.And this transaction has earned 50% of the profit.I don't think this is a coincidence. Let's see if something interesting will happen before the expiry date."
"its official. pump over, dump in progress"
Loading!!!! sub 9s again! nice. ABSOLUTELY NO REASON FRO THIS TOO
I need $17.00/share to break even.SUCKS!
"I was long on this stock but the problem is Clever Leaves expects full year 2021 revenue to grow to between $17 million to $20 million, with gross margin of approximately 61%. In their SPAC time investor presentation they projected $72 million revenue which is way higher than current projection. They still have $80 million cash and cash equivalent and I strongly believe that the company will spend it wisely but if you want to be safe then better to get back in below $7 or even $6."

day is just starting!!!
LOL WHAT THE HELL IS YAHOO DOING TO THIS COMPANY
"Noticing a lot of good resistance to and recovery from big drops caused by block dumps the last few days, especially on the warrants. Those big dumps used to send the stock price reeling (""big"" being a relatively term here given the low float...just 5-10k shares dumped at market would sometimes send the stock in a tailspin). I'm my opinion, this as a positive sign."
No volume but up at least.
Interesting company. Got in at high 9s. Curious about their relationship with CBD life after reading an article and researching $RMHB. Making grounds in Mexico.
this is the calm before the storm. cannabis will become more accepted and decriminalized officially... it takes time and that time is almost up. it is always darkest before dawn... and this sector will get the green lights needed then you will see a mad dash to own shares and a TON of mergers and acquisitions will take place. these company CEOs haber a plan and big tobacco and alcohol companies will finish their moves too. companies have leaned up and are ready. #48north #hexo #cgc #clvr #usmj #mmnff #tlry
approaching triple bottom... this might be considered the triple bottom right now at $10. chart looks BULLISH! all it takes is news on removing controlled substance barrier or making medical federally legal. dont need recreational yet. this will go through the roof
"The one-year contract with Canopy Growth has expired, hasn't it been renewed?"
This stock is OVERVALUED. Look at their guidance. $20MM of revenue at the high end with a very generous 10x multiple is a $200MM valuation. This is at $270MM. They're also going to burn through 1/2 their cash this year...$80MM to start less $10MM capex less $25MM in EBITDA less another $5MM-ish in working capital....left with $40MM. They better ramp up the revenue quickly.
trash stock! force everyone out to get in cheap? #$%$ u
big news coming
"Warrants popped 40+% after close today. I know the warrants on this are highly manipulated and volatile, but that seems excessive. I wonder what’s up?"
Listen I am well aware of how the shorts are going after SPAC’s and since this was a SPAC it has high short interest... however this company is a winner and they have a catalyst which if they perform well can blow the shorts out of the water
SNDL and CLVR are the future of cannabis; we might end up $50+ /share
Almost complete silence on this board during a very strong week long rally. I’m wondering if many longs dumped their shares and moved on. From my perspective I completely distrust this latest rally in CLVR since there has been no news release or fundamental change to the company’s revenue and profitability stated guidance. Aside from a general oversold bounce I don’t see this ramp up materializing into a sustained run up in shares but I must admit to hoping my distrust is misplaced and that perhaps this recent move is the precursor to something big. You never know!
"Wow, this one sure can rise/fall ""quick""."
"Rather than a Canadian LP or a US MSO, Clever is an MNO (multi-national operator). it operates 1.8 million square feet of cultivation, and is the region's only Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certified operation in Columbia. The reason why Colombia is sought-after comes down to cost. The average cost to produce a gram of cannabis for most of the largest Canadian players ranges from 1.50 to 1.89 per gram, while in Colombia, the projected cost sits around .20 per gram. this is the reason why this company is going to the top worldwide and especially in the USA once NASDAQ removes barriers."
@marc whered u go bro lolol .... you dont know what it means when i sy clvr needs nasdaq ro remove barriers. omg rofl lolol
I’ll check back in 6 months
Partnering with Clever Leaves aligns with Verdemed’s mission to offer the best cannabinoid products to all Latin Americans
sooooo is that a triple bottom in the last month?!
"So they are selling in the U.S., Europe, and have the lowest cost by far per gram and have sales that already outpace companies with 10 to 20 times the market cap. What am I missing????"
"Someone bought 600,000 shares at close."
"The short ratio has averaged between 20 to 30%!or higher on most days for several months. But Friday, with over 2M share volume the short ratio was only 6%. So what do the shorts know that the rest of us don’t?"
WHY
"Company is speaking at a conference tomorrow, could be interesting with stock below $9"
This company has huge potential! It can produce a gram of marijuana for a 1/5 of the cost compared to a huge company like Tilray( which has a market cap of 4 billion!). While this company which has a market cap of only 300 million!
Why the AH jump?
"https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/1377280709686091779If passed, CLVR will be one of the biggest winners"
"This stock is up about 18% since the Columbian president signed the new law allowing export of dry flower. Not a triple bagger yet, but I like these gains and am still holding long."
Long to $40.
"Can anyone from a TA perspective, the ""bottom"" is in?"
Waiting for $8.
Cannabis sector is gearing up for a massive run up. EVERYONE KNOWS NEWS COMING about Schumer bill to pass and we need taxes with federal medical cannabis and allow states to tax how they please. This is going to catapult this industry and we will NEVER see the industry so cheap. THIS IS MMs PLAYING GAMES SO BIG MONEY CAN GET IN CHEAP BEFORE THIS MASSIVE RUN UP. GLTA JMHO HUGE SECTOR NEWS COMING SOON!!!!
"According to the latest 13F, BlackRock has already bought some in Q1."

CLEVER cost to produce 1G of cannabis is 90% cheaper than it's competitors. canopy growth understands this and has even started to negotiate deals to work with clever on a wholesale basis. this is just the start they are currently the leaders in Colombia and Portugal. sure tilRay has some production in Portugal as it being their second production hub in the world but it came at a cost and it came after clever. at least to my understanding and timeline I have been known to be wrong and I am able to admit that I can be wrong. unlike a lot of people on here who just think that the predictions are going to happen and that if a stock doesn't go up 100% in the first week that it's a loss and a terrible stock LOL. but that is why till Ray is hurting is because company like clever is and has been producing their longer faster a bigger footprint and for cheaper costs. even look at the green organic Dutchman they spent what several hundred millions of dollars on a indoor grow facility and now they're looking at selling it for under 100 million and taking a massive loss I mean a massive loss to its shareholders because they realize that growing indoors costs way too much 1 oz of cannabis is an entire tank of gas money wise that is not efficient and so now they're trying to move things outdoors but the problem with that is they're gross cycle in Canada is not the same as say somewhere along the equator of Columbia Portugal it isn't even able to be replicated and so these Canadian companies have to trick the plants we are sitting awesome with clever
Just another #$%$ pot stock save your money
cannabis Market in the u.s. is flooded #$%$ in legal states but not federally legal are selling 28% THC 1 oz $100 this stock is overpriced
They are going after your shares.
pinned at $11 all day. No volume. Shorts are neither selling or covering.

"I own some shares of CLVR but also own some of the warrants which I am relatively clueless about. My average price of the warrants is about $4.40 and I understand that the ""strike"" price is set at $11.50 so do I have to wait for the share price to be above $15.90 for it to make sense to exercise the warrants?"
only medical cannabis facility in Latin America with EU-GMP certification
Based on premarket action “they” are about to gap CLVR below recent support below 11.90. The sharp trajectory of this latest down move on lower than average volume is a sector bet to scoop up shares from weak hands. My advice is if you’re looking to buy put an outrageous bid in and it may just get tagged in the next week or so. The market maker manipulators are going to run the stops in CLVR and the sector as well as the overall market. All imo
Could they buy CBDL as a foothold into the US?

WOW LOOK AT THE BUYS COMING IN! this is going to turn around asap. back to $12 immediately
Earnings came out March 30th!!! I am buying 25k worth of the 15 and 17.5 strike
what a gift. thank you shorts!
i might do a DD on Reddit. This has so much potential.
Immense upside. Kyle referenced a multitude of interest alluding to M&A. CLVR has some of the strongest assets and certifications in the industry period.Hard to not imagine a scenario where an American company pursues an asset light model and utilizes Clever Leaves disruptive cost manufacturing (if CLVR doesn't enter itself. Regulation permitting of course but that's why we have DaschleEveryone loves big name LP's and MSOs but are totally overlooking the real sleeping giant.
did they change the company name???? or get bought out???
bullish reversal confirmed what a day. I'm out have a good evening everyone
im a little confused this gem isnt noticed more. it's basically free money.
"this is the lowest market cap pot stock I can find, much less the only one with a worldwide footprint."
This is slowly being shorted again with no volume.
@mister take a chill pill and lay off the keyboard for a while.
Ive seen this movie befor they announce partnership stock up a bit and then gives back gains over the next week
"In case anyone missed it, earnings will be released Monday after close. Earnings call at 5pm Monday."
"A huge number of put options have been transferred from 0416 to 0521, which should be bought by holding institutions for hedging purposes, indicating that there is a higher downside risk in the near future."
this is going to correct itself just like #clvr did today
Boom bought the 12.5 at .7 looking forward to selling at a double
this company produces the cheapest high end cannabis in the world. BEST profit margins in industry world wide. CGC agrees with their interest with CLVR
Shaking some warrants out of weak retail hands this morning. Ouch!
Lateral and important Fibonacci support broke today. There currently appears to be very little institutional support so it looks like the shorts and mm’s are going to get there washout perhaps down to low 8’s again. I will add more if this happens. I think this sector is being manipulated down right before the US Senate finally acts by around Labor Day. There’s a good chance August will erase July losses.
