Love Netflix as a service but my Scottish self does not like the cash flow or the valuation for now. Hope to get in M12 months from now once we see the effects of competition.
Watch for $1000 before any real pullback.

"With Coinbase likely going public next week, that’s good news for the warrants SIVB holds."
Haven't seem much discussion on this stock but is just seems to keep going up. I'm thinking about taking a long position in it but the stock price makes it a little intimidating. Any thoughts on the companies future?

New to this name. Why has this been rising like an innovative tech stock? Thanks

What am I missing here? They blow away their earnings estimates. Are growing incredibly fast for a bank. Well run. Cheap. Why isn't this think $700?
Back to three hondo in 21 hours
Great job by SIVB management holding firm with holdout shareholders at BPFH. Excellent value-oriented dealmaking.
Does anyone know why the revenue has been improving well?
SVB Financial Group at $100 is a buy
Will this company ever pay a dividend...seems to be making nice money now.
Wake me when it’s over

These guys are the parent that arranged the Millendo Therapeutics merger with Tempest Therapeutics. In a recent 425 filing valued Millendo at $1.89 pre 1 for 15 split or $28.35 post split versus actual closing price of $13.36 on first day of trading today 6-28-21. Can u say absolutely incredible due diligence. How can you be off by over 50%!!!
why did this bank go down with the tech stocks when its a bank
"Rough rough day ahead, ER was great, good outlook bad market"
