ITs been a good week for UNM. Only stock I have currently. Hard to find much else ( at these levels) that is near as solid as UNM.
"Basically, buybacks + dividends = 8% return at the current price if no adverse events occur. Steady and safe company as well and relatively low price when compared to their competitors. Seems a ""boring"" but effective investment"
It seems all the stars are aligning recently to boost Unum earning in coming quarters and years. But very little movement in the stock. What am I missing?
"I love UNM. Took advantage of the dip from getting kicked out of the S&P 500. When I value a company, whether it is in a certain index does not enter into it for me. I find earnings a tad more important. With a $1.20 dividend and an estimated $5.20 in earnings, I'm pretty darn sure that dividend is safe. The far bigger kicker is that that extra $4.00 in earnings, in theory, goes to the shareholders one way or another. Either the company pays down debt, ups the dividend, buys back shares (which, of course, makes the earnings per share better) or some combo. You can say that that has been true for a long time but hasn't translated into a higher share price, and you'd be right, but I still have faith that it will. Seemingly safe PE's of 4.5 are bizarre."
"Longtime stakeholders, question is there any reason UNM can't return to 2015-2019 earnings levels (and share prices), has anything fundamentally changed? Looking at the top line, its up 30% from 2015 levels. Looking at Book Value, its up nearly as much over that time period."
"with the recent drop, I have added. ex divy coming in two weeks."
"So is UNM going up because Rates are going up or earnings?I thought 2Q Earnings were good so I have been riding this stock down and didn't pay attention to it until today........I can't believe I missed a chance to Add to my position below $24. Their Closed Block segment has the highest earnings at the moment, and it is the segment that includes LTC. Maybe the virus got more people to cancel their policies or got killed by the virus. BV is above $53 so it is VERY cheap!"
You need to own today to qualify for the 1%+ dividend but there is a sell off. This market is the new VEGAS . Complete joke of a market
Even with the share price increase the yield is still 4.64%. This is insanely cheap. The growth rate in the dividend in the last 10 years has averaged 11%. Seems like a good option in a shaky market.
"Look at the valuation metrics for UNM. If you valued UNM like their competitors UNM would be a $35-$45 stock.PE - this year 5.8XPE - next year estimates 5.2X (competitors 6.4 to 10.8X)PCF - 6.9X (top competitors 10.3 to 12.6X)Price to book - 0.52 (competitors 0.66 to 1.13)Price to sales - 0.43 (competitors 0.70 to 1.71)Dividend yield - 4.3% (competitors 2.22%, 2.33%, 2.91%)Add in $250 million share repurchase and you have an opportunity for significant returns in the next 12-18 months.ratios per broker website."
Up $1.13 within an hour after the share buy back announcement. Hope the timing caught some shorts short so they end up needing to pay up to cover tomorrow. I think it is also an indication the Q3 results are on target or better.
"Barrons article identifies UNM as one of the cheapest mid cap stocks, trading at just over 4X 2022 expected earnings. Not new news but hopefully it bring some more attention to the deep discount for UNM today."
Rocket ship!
"This stock is a rollercoaster. Not sure why, since it’s an insurance stock with similar earnings every quarter…"
Amazing how fast money flies into UNM when the ten year treasury rates start moving up
Amzn reports a disaster of a quarter and it’s down 3%. Meanwhile Unum announces nothing and is down 5% on low volume…although I suspect that will change in the last hour. This is the Rodney Dangerfield of stocks. The Board has to change that or resign!
Kind of an OK reaction to the share repurchase announcement. Wish they had stayed on track with the Q1 plan and announced this in the Q2 earnings call. The way they flubbed that cost them credibility and pushed the price down. Then they got the second whack with being removed from the index. C Suite messed this up in my opinion.
ouch ... kind of hoping for another opportunity at a 5% dividend
The strong tradition of enhancing shareholder value through repurchase and ownership concentration continues at Unum!2014: 255.5M shares2015: 247.0M shares2016: 235.4M shares2017: 226.5M shares2018: 219.6M shares2019: 209.7M shares2020: 203.6M shares2022: stay tuned!
I'm selling this before earnings.. I am 100 percent sure this will go down to 19 dollars
