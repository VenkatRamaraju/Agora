"Why is this so undervalued? 11B sales, and 8B assets, yet market cap at 7B??"
What is up with these pre market quotes? Up .91 cents then 0! Anyone?
happy with the steady run up. This should be a $30 stock easy
"how much of the all the re-balancing takes place today? all the shares got dumped out of the sp500, do the midcap fund buy today or next week?"
"Top line growth and recorded solid profit margins. Continue to buy back more cheap shares back. 100 million dollars returned to share holders. To me, the result is still very good and the cup is 3 quarter full. ."
"Unum, McLean Hospital and Meru Health Partner to Help Employers Support Their Workers' Behavioral Health. This seems very positive. The money going into Medicare/Medicaid is going to the moon. Hand out antidepressants at all stores."
Not seeing any news for the pop today. Guess I’ll just happily accept it
"Just went through financial statements on what UNUM has for reserves/investments on their books...the vast majority (96%) is government bonds or corporate securities that are investment grade...less than 4% are under BBB....the current valuation of UNUM, given virtually all claims are short term health related (I can't see life payout going up any more than a regular bad 'flu season') is nuts."
"Unloved....great value, big dividend, nibble at this price area"
Crying shame that it's getting dumped. What stellar earnings in a difficult environment with solid dividends to boot. Perhaps they should change their name to Virgin Galactic or Nikola ;-) . Value seems to have no meaning anymore.
UNM dropped much more compared to PRU. UNM has much volatility for some reason.
"Barrons article identifies UNM as one of the cheapest mid cap stocks, trading at just over 4X 2022 expected earnings. Not new news but hopefully it bring some more attention to the deep discount for UNM today."
"24% EPS beat, revenue in line and full year looking better than previous estimates. Unfortunately in this crazy market you can't tell what direction the stock price will go."
"I'm sorry but even after that last run-up, this stock is still INCREDIBLY cheap, what is the P/E, up over 7?! I just hang on and keep getting a nice 4% quarter after quarter...cheers"
Is there still a buyback program at the moment?
"Looks like another day of 2xs average volume, up 2% good start."
"Are they playing with this stock? Was way up premarket, down now.Yahoo Finance Insights3 hours agoUnum is up 7.72% to 23.99"
If you are convinced that UNUM is a solid company with good prospects then this might be a great buying opportunity for you.
"Just went long. Low P/E, boring companies is the place to be right now. ""The market is a voting machine in the short run and weighing machine in the long run."""
Mr market is really playing with this one.
Paid off $400M in debt last quarter. No remaining debt is due until 2024. $1.2B in cash. They are in a good balance sheet spot in this difficult time.
Was anybody on conference call? What were your takeaways from the call? I wasn’t able to be on this morning.
"UNM has a 4.23% dividend yield while the 10 year Treasury yield has drifted down from 1.7% to 1.4%. UNM is paying almost 4X the 10 year T yield, 17 X the 2 Yr T yield and 85 X the 30 day Treas yield.UNM dividend yield is 2-4X the yield on 5 to 10 year HQM corporate bonds.The five analyst that have updated price targets this year have all increased their targets for Unum. Current target is right about the current price but analyst appear to be playing catchup as the company performance improves. With a PE of 6 this stock is trading at a huge discount to the overall market. My perspective is analyst like to aim low and pat themselves on the back for share prices that exceed their conservative estimates. If you wait for them to come out with a target price of $35 the train will have already left the station."
Great yield now!
What's the deal with Barclays? Raises PT to $23 from $21. Is their quote machine broke?
Did anyone receive dividend?To be paid today.
"A 2021 & 2022 PE of 5 - lowest in their peer group (PRU, MET, LNC, AFL).P/CF of 6.6P/Sales of 0.4 - lowest in peer groupDividend yield of 4.5% - highest of its' peers and almost double some of themDebt on the higher side but Interest coverage 8.6X - 2nd best in the peer group. Others as high as 15 to 24XLowest analyst ratings in the group. They killed the stock momentum in the Q2 earnings call when they casually mentioned they were not going to initiate share repurchases in Q3 as they had indicated in the Q1 earnings call. In my opinion this stock should easily be in the mid $30's but lost the trust of analyst investors in the Q2 call. The good news is you can pick up shares that pay a 4.5% dividend today when real interest rates do not exist."
"2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 they repurchased about $400 million each year. If they continue that the # shares outstanding will decline significantly in the next few years."
"Responding to comments from a week ago regarding insider acquisitions and sales; Isn't it significant that prior to March, insiders were routinely selling a portion of the stock awards the day they received them and since the March drop that has not been the case?"
"This is going to be a controversial post, but at some point when the vaccine is available to everyone, should UNM drop coverage for those who refuse the vaccine? Why should they pay out a life insurance or LTD claim on someone who gets Covid and had refused the shot? Maybe they raise rates considerably on those that refuse the shot."
UNM: Q1 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.04 beats by $0.06GAAP EPS of $0.75 misses by $0.16.Revenue of $3.07B (+7.0% Y/Y) beats by $100M.Book value per common share of $51.77 grew 7.4 percent over the year-ago quarter.
Added more today. This is a good long term buy especially if rates go up and jobs are filled. I see both happening in next 12 months
I reviewed UNUM data on macrotrends. I like what I saw and bought at $23.25. Plan to hold and possibly sell covered calls when it rises to $25.
"Now that they are out of SP500, they should re-start buyback. I was against it when I wanted their market cap to be higher, but now they might as well try and raise the share price and shrink the share count."
ITs been a good week for UNM. Only stock I have currently. Hard to find much else ( at these levels) that is near as solid as UNM.
"29 million shares traded, dividend close to 5%. I'm hanging in."
MetLife just reported a good quarter - it’s an 8 PE. If Unum was priced the same it would be $40 and still cheap. I’m continuing to add.
"Those with a target price of 30 can sell,but I want 35"
The stock earnings yield is substantially higher than interest on their debt. They should have bought the stock back at $20 but it’s still accretive at $27
"Huge down spike at end of day. Almost 10M shares dumped for SP500 sale. Looks like we hit the 10% I predicted. It will be interesting to see how it goes from here. If these guys don't give a better outlook at next CC, I'm switching to PRU."
Hoping 2021 brings a $1 billion buyback. Company should just get rid of the dividend and buy back the stock for tax efficiency purposes. Buyback $1 billion a year of stock until the stock trades for book value
This was $26.41 when they announced it was out of the SP500 and in the $24's the day it actually got kicked out.
It's a no- brainer buying at this level. they wouldn't have increased the dividend if earnings weren't going to be good this year. huge positive sensitivity to interest rates which are headed up. there's no such thing as owning too much of a value stock like this. Christ last quarter's earnings showed #$%$ annuallized EPS!!!
"I'm not sure a buyback is the best use of cash. They have one of the lowest market caps in the SP500. A buyback could lower the market cap enough that they would get thrown out which would be awful for the stock price. In addition, they only have a little over 200M shares outstanding. Not a lot of shares to begin withA better use would be buying a complimentary business to grow the company, share price, and thus the market cap."
"cap 4.51B,buy 7.1Breinsurence,it is big joke!why don't declare bankruptcy?investors can get more money!"
"Maybe tech stocks have gotten so overvalued, people are finally realizing there are lots of other companies with plenty of upside"
"Strong div level, great cash flow, excellent operational and underwriting results... we push through Delta and get int rates moving up a smidge we will be back to 30 and higher........"
Friday’s volume price effect seems to be this morning. Someone got the shares late Friday at nice prices considering today’s.75 plus movement.
All insurance seems to be range bound. All in the 4% div range except afl.
The $25 puts I sold a few weeks ago expired worthless. Wish they hadn’t but I’ll try again if I get a chance.
"its only a number. Some sold, this is still a steady sleeper. Good luck."
"RBC Raises Price Target on Unum Group to $31 From $26, Maintains Sector Perform"
Amazing how fast money flies into UNM when the ten year treasury rates start moving up
Dividend yield now over 5%.
"Bought more under $17, 6.7% yield"
Earnings report looks terrific!Trading for 3x cashBook 53 bucks Could not ask for a better report
Positive start to the 3rd Quarter. UNM and UL are all I'm holding. Just seems like most stocks are over heated at this all time high level.
Don't like the article contemplating who TESLA will replace in the S@P 500. Not happy UNM was in the discussion.
"Looking back for couple of days, it seems the price dropped as someone sold to keep price lower coinciding with earnings.If earnings/CC were not good, price would have dropped further and thankfully that did not happen.Do not know what will be the catalyst to bring price higher toward meaningful PE ratio?"
So they will only make $5.00 EPS this year and the dividend is only 7 percent? Man. What a disappointment.  Will be buying more and more until it’s back up to $30 plus per share where it belongs.
"There was a huge sell imbalance on Friday's close. UNM was trading at 25.75 when the imbalance was announced. Usually after such a big move only caused by a closing imbalance, the price goes back to normal in a few days."
"I’m actually surprised this company hasn’t been bought out yet. Market cap is small, earnings are great, lots of cash flow. There aren’t many really good buys out there for value investors like me right now. This is still one that I’m slowly adding to."
That might of been the bottom as a 70K block was traded around $24.80I'm guessing a stop was taken out.
Is this Company not seriously mispriced (cheap) at the current price of USD 25 ?
Are they still writing new policies for LTC?What happens to the reserves and reserve requirements as the policies expire due to non payment or not needed any more?
Earnings must be going UP quite a bit for UNM for this stock to be going up like this.
I have too many stocks and didn't notice they sold it Off to below $24.......Some people are just too Foolish to be in the stock Market.
"Added more during dip, safe dividend play"
"snippet from an article.. “Stocks being dropped from the index inevitably are deep value stocks that have performed badly, are struggling as a business, and are dropped at distressed prices,” Arnott says.His firm’s research finds that buying the outgoing stock in discretionary deletions from the S&P 500 at the closing price on the day it’s removed from the index has beaten the market by an average of nearly 20% over the following 12 months."
"Just given a plug on CNBC. Said earnings were good but their were concerns about the LTC business. Mentioned nothing about the buyback as the reason. I believe it is the LTC division that has the deficit funding issue. ""I think you're also suggesting that any potential LTC block transaction may be contingent upon pre-funding PDR...Yes"".PDR is premium deficiency reserve in LTC"
"Good earnings, solid dividend, I'm glad I got in well below $18."
"Well now that they are out of the SP500, I expect a 10% downward move before stabilizing. They didn't do themselves any favors by not getting the share price up. Lame management."
Higher rates due to CV-19 vaccine will push this higher. Up almost 10% in pre-market. Financial stocks soaring
"Well earnings missed. . Also wall street is not giving unm much credit since share price is will below bv.Book value per common share as of September 30, 2019 was $46.70, compared to $38.95 at September 30, 2018."
"What will happen to this stock if another State comes out requiring them to Add more LTC reserve?I think that News on Maine is meaningful for this stock, and I have NO idea how much business they do in Maine...............But, I'm willing to bet it's probably their smallest market."
Has UNM declared a dividend date yet for 2nd quarter?
The dividend funds are asleep at the wheel if they're not loading up on this steadily increasing dividend. it would bring up the average yield of ANY existing dividend fund out there. with limited downside risk on the capital
Earnings in am?
Over $40 coming
"For people who love UNM, what other companies seem similarly attractive to you?"
Commendable dividend history here:2014: $0.62 2015: $0.70 (12.9% increase)2016: $0.77 (10% increase)2017: $0.86 (11.6% increase)2018: $0.98 (14.0% increase)2019: $1.09 (11.2% increase)2020: $1.14 (4.6% increase)2021: $1.17 (2.6% increase)Covid is just a speed bump I'm sure they'll get back to the double digit increases. So many companies suspended dividends completely and still only offer a fraction of the pre-covid dividend.Share appreciation is the main thing but the dividends really boost total return here especially when reinvested over several years.
How does Yahoo calculate the dividend yield? $1.20 / $27.03 = 4.44%
"After listening to the conference call I was left with the impression UNM management is ok with a PE and PCF of 5-6X which gives you the price we have today. Multiple comments that things were ""in-line with expectations"" and then comments some areas improved more than expected but are not expected to continue. Leaves the impression management has fairly low expectations and the good news is fading. Who drives for aspirational goals? Where is the focus on pushing sales and improving margins? If that is not coming from the team on the call then it does not exist in the company.The improvement in the full year outlook was described as a “lesser decline” vs. the previous outlook. Why not say ""our current full year outlook exceeds our prior outlook by x%"". The point was supposed to be positive.The capital position had multiple improvements vs. Q1. The initial discussion was they would invest in organic growth but few specifics. Then the focus switched to using the excess capital to fund the LTC liabilities which is not growth oriented. In response to a somewhat astonished sounding analyst question, they also stated the pre-funding would be voluntary vs. driven by regulators. If the capital position is better than their original plan, and accelerating the funding for the LTC liabilities it is not required, why is that better than investing in growth and/or share repurchases? Improving the share price gives them more market value for acquisitions and also maintains a higher total capitalization level to stay in the index.Many companies maintain a share repurchase authorization that they do not necessarily use frequently. Management response to the analyst question of share repurchases was a total change in tone from Q1 which seemed to catch the analysts by surprise. Unfortunately, I think UNM stock will be stuck at a grossly disadvantaged valuation based on the messaging from today’s call. I am very long so the only comfort is the healthy dividend yield.Also vs. other companies the # of attendees seems higher which does not help in the focus and consistency of the messaging. The best managed call I listened to so far this quarter was the ViacomCBS call."
"An interesting excerpt from an article on Seeking Alpha titled ""Undervalued Unum Profiting From Macroeconomic Trends, Plus 4.5% Dividend"":The index effect, defined as excess return on tickers added or removed from an index, has been waning in the past years. In a research report by S&P Rating Services titled ""What Happened to the Index Effect?"" the credit rating firm concludes that neither deletions nor additions greatly influence ticker prices, as shown in the chart below. This is also the consensus opinion in academic circles. For this reason, there is no valid reason to expect a significant depreciation in price multiples due to the index exclusion going forward.Comment: Obviously there was a short-term depreciation when removed from the S&P500, but this research report by none other than S&P themselves concludes that is not a lasting effect."
..Sector Rotation . Tech Profits pouring into Banks and Insurance Companies .
Moody’s review- Anyone who read it has any comments?Negative review would pressure price on Monday.BV 51 and dividend can carry the stock price higher...Short interest higher may be due to this anticipated review?!
UNM buying back shares probably the reason why management wants to keep the stock flat
"Just accept the dividend for now, and huge gains in the next 12-18 months"
"Its times like this, I'm glad there's so much volatility in our world. It gives people with the guts a chance to profit."
Chart looks like a run up to $ 30 could happen very easily
Buying this at this price means there is almost no risk! PE of around 6…. Wish there was more money to buy more!!!
UNM has to have visibility into its 2021 renewals at this point. Investors have to demand mansgement address the stock prices. The company swears in its 10k how much it benefits from higher interest rates. Company needs to do a $2 billion buyback
UNM report earnings tomorrow after the close of the market… Any guesses on what the stock price does tomorrow
Even with the share price increase the yield is still 4.64%. This is insanely cheap. The growth rate in the dividend in the last 10 years has averaged 11%. Seems like a good option in a shaky market.

"Time to issue some convertible bonds and use the proceeds to buy back stock. My god, this management team is worthless in balance sheet management."
"For perspective, as a result of share buybacks and current price Unum is now worth about what it was in the depths of the Financial Crisis. Long term earnings twice as high. Dividend more than double. There are no value investors, just algorithms that push the same story over and over. I don't know how this ends but wow."
"It’s time for the Board to move on from McKenny. He screwed up royally at Genworth and has been at Unum 10 years, 5 as CEO and in the greatest bull market in history he has delivered a company with a PE of 5. The discount to book value is 100% his legacy. Fire the guy, it is what a fiduciary is expected to do."
I invested in UNM and now cant stop. That 7 p.e and balance sheet make me out of (Insurance) control.I am here for the UNM anonymous program.
Earnings beat. Dividend increase. Resuming buybacks. Next stop is $40. This is one of the most unfollowed high dividend stocks I have come across.
Looks like 5 year low
"So is UNM going up because Rates are going up or earnings?I thought 2Q Earnings were good so I have been riding this stock down and didn't pay attention to it until today........I can't believe I missed a chance to Add to my position below $24. Their Closed Block segment has the highest earnings at the moment, and it is the segment that includes LTC. Maybe the virus got more people to cancel their policies or got killed by the virus. BV is above $53 so it is VERY cheap!"
Thanks $UNM.... love the double in price and the dividend yield. wish I had bought more.
Now that the good news is public look at the price spike and volume either at the close on Friday or Monday open. Somebody knew something
"Commendable repurchase history here, as evident by the falling outstanding share count:2014: 255.5M shares2015: 247.0M shares2016: 235.4M shares2017: 226.5M shares2018: 219.6M shares2019: 209.7M shares2020: 203.6M sharesMRQ: 204.5M sharesThey do have some catching up to do yet in 2021."
"I think the bear case is that profits, the balance sheet, etc. in the end are dependent on the reserves that UNM has to pay future benefits. And that is base on UNM's model to estimate its future payouts. There are some analysts (obviously the main one who has been discussing this issue for UNM is Credit Suisse) that believe UNM Is considerably underreserved. So, some of these profits the have been booking should have gone to reserves rather than earnings.Fine... that seems to be what has kept UNM's price down until more recently. Now, we have this huge drop in interest rates. Sure, it will help them in one way it will help their current investment portfolio short term. But if these much lower interest rates force UNM to use a lower long term interest rate in their model to calculate their future returns on current reserves, and this lowers their expected rate of return, then UNM may need to take a large charge and increase their reserves. Also, more of their current revenue stream may need to go to reserves rather than earnings.Now, at this level the shareprice may already be wayyyyyyy over compensating for any possible change future change in reserve calculation....this could be the perfect time to buy. But I think this is at least one big reason why the share price has declined."
Big option position at $30 on April.
"Was reading past threads.Came across nine months ago post by cj.unbelievable!CS saying 9 months ago about under reserved by 5B to 15B. How do they pick these numbers? Now I am glad after thorough review authorities came with 2B number.At that time share price was in 30’s and they gave price to be 19, now with 2B number, they should increase that numbers."
Beautiful 5%er
"with the recent drop, I have added. ex divy coming in two weeks."
Finally positive momentum.
Earnings call recording https://78449.choruscall.com/dataconf/productusers/unm/mediaframe/45551/indexr.html
UNM has grown book value $1 billion in 2020 even after $175mn in dividends while the stock has lost $1 billion in market cap. Company is only $4.5 billion company. Come on and address the garbage stock performance
"Its mind boggling to look at the numbers on Unum. The last time UNM had a money losing year was 2004. Its earnings do move around and there are negative quarters...that is the nature of insurance. But here are some numbers.Since 2010 (a relatively normal earnings year) ten years ago. Unum has essentially doubled EPS, tripled dividends all while its market value has halved. How is this a company that has a PE of 3.5 when nominal interest rates are zero and real interest rates are negative?"

"Does the move of UNM from the S&P 500 to the S&P MidCap 400 have the effect of offsetting the selling from some index funds because they will be added to others?

Why the big drop Wednesday
"Longtime stakeholders, question is there any reason UNM can't return to 2015-2019 earnings levels (and share prices), has anything fundamentally changed? Looking at the top line, its up 30% from 2015 levels. Looking at Book Value, its up nearly as much over that time period."

"when unemployment numbers flatten, and then start to improve the outlook of this company will improve, and it will reflect in earnings and share price. Many of the products are sold to employees and employers as employers layoff employees, sales go down. You are seeing future expectations prices into the stock.

Enjoy your ability to accumulate more at current prices."
If getting kicked out of the S&P gets this to a 5% yield…I’m buyin* more on Monday
"Dear UNM management. I have had a long position for a year. If the price keeps falling, I will have to switch from Coors light to Bush light. Please don't make me do this drastic move. Can we stay up around $27-$28? Yeah that would be great thanks."
Great earnings! Retired debt too
This has now become a growth story and a dividend story. Should be up over the next few months. One of the best values in the market right now.
"LTC business hit is what is causing the stock to decline...they will have to fund that business to the tune of $2B over the next 6 years...major drain on cash flow.....but, the rest of the business looks pretty sound....One outcome of the LTC business is they probably can raise rates to policy holders as a class, but that takes time and you have to go state by state to get approvals to do so."
Analyst Ratingshttps://www.benzinga.com/stock/unm/ratings
"Time for a new strategy? The 5 and the 10 year chart look awful. The only reason the 1 year looks good is that the stock was so low at the beginning of the year there has been a slight gain for the year. Can't be all LTC. Lets pick up the pace...Its so low , I am still buying, are you buying? Maybe the company should as well....... or look for other options."
Thought I was done buying anything for a while but this is to good to pass up.
"Lighter volume than last two days, but Price moved up. Still down.60-.70 from last 5 days in anticipation of ER to catch up…"
Nice dividend yield of 4% will provide about 100X more than your bank. Granted stocks have price risk but this stock is selling for a ridiculously low PE multiple and is re-starting a share buy back program.

"There are investors buying U.S. Treasury bonds, and UNM, its value is much higher than Treasury bonds in any respect, why some hesitations?"
Interest rates at highest level since March 2020. This should move up quickly if rates keep moving up.
I started buying Unum when it was about $13 a share last year and have traded it several times since then and I’ve always made money on it. In my opinion the market is really overbought at these levels but Unum is a solid company and I plan to stick with it.￼￼
"Unum doing great in such a low interest rate environment. When interest rates rise it seems that Unum might do even better. Seems to me this is a safe place to put your money, regardless of what happens in the future."
Note to Management. Sell the bond portfolio. All $55B of it. Take what the Fed has given you and book the gains. You'll be able to buy in at twice as high yields in a year.

"From 2nd quarter UNM earnings call :With the second quarter recovery in financial markets, we do expect the valuation for many of these investments has also improved and will be reflected in our third quarter reporting. We do not expect, however, a full recovery in the third quarter, but do expect them to fully recover over time and generate our assumed returns."
well removal of sp500 really wasn't that bad. who knows where stock goes from here but I still like the fundamentals
"Stunning opportunity for anyone interested in investing. UNUM is a bargain vs. competitors.Price/Sales - 0.43%Price to Earnings - under 7XPrice to cash flow - under 7XDividend yield almost 4.5%Dividend payout about 30%5 Year dividend trend +9%Compare these ratios to Met Life, Prudential, AFLAC, Lincoln Financial, Hartford Financial and you will see UNUM is selling at a significant discount. Share repurchases starting in the second half of this year will now be more impactful due to the lower share price. All good news for long term investors."

I mean a virus that is more lethal to an elderly population could end up freeing vast amounts of capital that is currently stuck supporting the LTC block. I'm not saying this is how it will unfold, but with a PE of 5.2 this stock has been at disaster pricing for 5 years now and the disasters never happen. Sure the LTC reserves got bolstered 2 years ago and that was such a ""disaster"" that the company managed to pay dividends and buy back $250 million in stock without adding to debt. Why can't management convey this message to the investor world?"
"UNM was never a trading stock, but with today’s volume, it can become one.Hope the trend from here on is up! Based on the low PE and dividend."
Most posters are saying the stock is way undervalued and it keeps dropping more…
Fundamentals looking good
What did they say in the conference call that spooked the market?
"Text book case for insane markets. PE of 6X. PCF of less than 6? Dividend yield of 4.71%. But all the ""smart money"" is buying Robinhood."
Guys please tell me where is the risk in ESGR and 2-2.5 PE ratio given that UNM has 6 PE ratio and no risk?
"Big earnings beat next week, back to 32"
"Below the 1 year SMA, nice valuation, huge yield and lots of coverage on that. I'm in!"
What is the deal with this company?I looked at their 2019 outlook back in 2018 and surprised this isn't above $30 considering that they were projecting Operating Income to be higher for LTC segment(closed block) in 2019.........Closed block only contributes like 8% to operating income so they should do with that since it is keeping this stock down because it looks more like a healthcare company than traditional insurer........This might be the cheapest stock since I see projections approaching $7 a few years from now.
"UNM is a good back pocket stock. You take the Covid issue off the chart this puppy was smoking up in the $37+ range. There are times to sell pre dividend (for tax etc.) or just ride it out. This one, you can sleep on."
At $30 UNM still has a 4%. I think this low price will be gone before long.
Why it’s down after hours?
"The S&P500 could use some help from Unum today, ha too bad!!"
bought at 25.07
The only recent company news is they refinanced debt at a lower rate and hired Polly Nicholas. Is Polly that bad?Sorry for the bad humor.
"will be kicked off from SP500,UNM donot need to care the capital to keep in SP500,so ,buy back quickly!"
Are they going to buy back shares like the banks anybody knows?
"Just saw whre KBW just raised target on UNM from $ 25 to $ 27, so basically an upgradeSteve E"
"Cheap stock, it's headed to $30."
"Those pointing at wage growth as a tail-wind for UNMs revenues are onto something here. Though auto sales are down, banks have had continuous auto loan growth this year just based on the fact average sale prices have risen. Same effect.  that dividend!"
"This will go back to old highs $40 +. I pay liability ( mandatory) for a home care. I pay a lot$$. We were a 4 employee co. In excess of $3000, a year."
Looks like a quick trip to $25. The hornet's nest has been stirred!
Bought more at $25.25.
"I love UNM. Took advantage of the dip from getting kicked out of the S&P 500. When I value a company, whether it is in a certain index does not enter into it for me. I find earnings a tad more important. With a $1.20 dividend and an estimated $5.20 in earnings, I'm pretty darn sure that dividend is safe. The far bigger kicker is that that extra $4.00 in earnings, in theory, goes to the shareholders one way or another. Either the company pays down debt, ups the dividend, buys back shares (which, of course, makes the earnings per share better) or some combo. You can say that that has been true for a long time but hasn't translated into a higher share price, and you'd be right, but I still have faith that it will. Seemingly safe PE's of 4.5 are bizarre."
Profit taking is driving the sell off on a good news quarter. $25 is the bottom. Unum was at $30 three weeks ago. Unum should climb back to $30 in a couple of weeks. I bought more at $25.25. Long UNM
I can’t believe it went down that much!LTC block is depressing the stock valuation unrealistically. That will creat a sweet risk reward opportunity Buying more today
good news!SP500 kick out the UNM.IT is harmful to keep in the index
Look at the long term price history of UNUM and think about what happens to the share price when you have rising interest rates.
Does anyone on the board own UNMA? It's the 6.25% preferred shares of UNM. Trade at a premium to par.
Over 30 dollars on sales. Lol on over reaction. Insurance stock attractiveness is its stability of premium and income.
"This price is big green light buy, especially with the Dividend Ex. 12 trading days out."
Dividend increase of 5.3% to 30c in 3rd quarter. Progress at least.
Looking for a return to 25.50 by the end of the week. A PE of 5 simply can't last.
Nice
Stock at 52 week high going into earnings. Should be an. Interesting day tomorrow
I've never invested in a company that is owned 100% by institutions like UNM. The officer's ownership is microscopic at .68%. Looks like the institutions could band together and force some productive actions on the managers like DOUBING the dividends or acquiring or selling something. Surely they won't just sit patiently since all these stock accumulations had to be at MUCH HIGHER PRICES! Before much happens they will have to trade back and forth among themselves and also sell to individuals to make a market. Surely that could make for some much needed volatility. Any thoughts out there on what they might do?
"Chubb wants to buy Hartford for $65/sh, 1.8X BV. Hartford wants more. We languish at 0.5X BV"
I have not seen any losses when looking back 15 years. The stock keeps adding to book and dividend. How come it does not trade 40?
This drop is nonsense. I have now doubled my shares. 8% drop?
Some institutional buying in first quarter...Finally little price gain today.
All the value stocks are battered due to call options buying…..The big money keeps making money on most of these stocks by shorting and selling calls…
This should be a $40 stock. Then it would have a PE of 10 and dividend yield of 3% ignoring changes in shares outstanding. With buybacks resuming in Q3/Q4 they will lower the share count and increase the EPS per share which would reduce the PE to under 10.It is amazing to see the hyper valuations on some stocks while others like UNM are a bargain and much more secure long term IMO. The biggest risk is interest rates increase dramatically reducing the attractiveness of the dividend yield and increasing the discount rate on earnings to determine the stock value.
"26.16, break that 50 day and things will be strong for 4th Q."
"Dividend News Alert! Unum just increased the dividend by 5.3% to $1.2/share per year (.30/share per quarter). We are likely back to Unum’s typical operating procedure of strong annual increases to the dividend payout. If earnings are strong in the 2nd half of 2021, as they are expected to be, I would like to see another dividend increase to make up for the pause during the COVID pandemic.Great work Unum executives, team members, and BOD!"
"Hi, could someone explain why this is relatively beaten down vis-à-vis its fundamentals? Seems highly undervalued. Appreciate the input."
What an incredibly gorgeous stock
Opened a position today. Hi
"Good points magic. Stock was doing fine until CV and Maine. That said, does it deserve this much of a haircut ? I would argue once fear leaves the market, yield chasers will be all over it. But for now it looks scary. Buy low, sell high. Not many companies paying dividends these days. This is a buy. IMO"
Anyone know more about their long term care reserves which were rated #$%$7B under reserved by Credit Suisse. UNM did raise their reserves by less than 1B and does anyone have any input on this. That?s all that is keeping me from opening a position
"I cant figure this stock out. I have analyzed their company reports six ways to Sunday and cant figure out why UNM is priced where it is. It peaked two years ago and has declined 60% since then. Yield 5%. Dividend growth 10%. P/E<5, Payout ratio 20%, EPS has doubled in the last 10 years and has bought back about 30% of their stock in the last 10 years while maintaining a low amount of debt. What are they doing wrong for the stock to be punished like this?"
"Since last year, they stopped buybacks for 2020.Hopefully they started buybacks."
"Volume on sell off isn't that great. It was the Maine reserve that brought the stock down. They have a 7 yr period too to fund the 2.2 billion reserve. With that said, Company is still in a good position to pay the dividend going forward."
Most of the insurance companies are bargains right now if you are an investor and not a day trader. Added some more today.
Is there any interest in this stock?
"UNM insiders bought 320,854 shares in the past three months and 741,987 shares in the past twelve months."
Noticed that Unum's borrowing costs for debt shorter than 6 years is less than what it pays in dividends. Forget the additional 6% in stock buybacks every share pays. How does this get hammered every day? Management should be buying shares hand over fist. They actually increase cash flow by taking on debt and buying shares.
Anyone on here explaining the reinsurance transaction in news today ? Thanks
UNM avg debt has a higher yield than the common stock. Therefore it would be better to buy back debt rather than the common stock.
Fidelity is showing volume for the day at 48M shares. I bought more in AH at $24.50. Either this bounces and we get a better outlook or I am switching out to PRU before year end.
"Added just a few shares today with the drop, I can catch the July div. Although it could very well drop below 27 on ex-div. Or with a bad E call in early Aug. I don't like that E est for FY21 are lower again like FY20, but FY22 est. is for a nice jump.. then there's the consistent divs and great DGR, worth a buy.."
Congratulations to everyone with balls that bought at 25! Great company
"One thing to note is that the higher interest rates and potentially higher inflation could actually be good for some parts of UNM’s business. For example, the closed LTC block has a huge reserve for future expenses, and the current reserve amount is based on future expenses discounted at estimated inflation rates. As inflation goes up, these future expenses are discounted at higher rates, so in the long run that actually lowers the company’s reserves."
Some rough but useful math here. A 1% bump in interest on their $50B of invested reserve assets is $500M. There's 200M shares outstanding so $2.50/share to the bottom line. A conservative 5.5X multiple gives you a $13.75 bump in share price. Just for a perspective. Assuming flat or improving other aggregate variables. Or am I looking at this all wrong.
Shifting out reasonably valued companies with expensive ones...
"hi guys, I am long term investor from last year ... I think todays drop is due to fear of new CoVid delta variant ... otherwise the quarter earnings are really great ..."
Revenue increases every year since 2016Trailing PE of 8Price / Cash Flow 10Dividend yield 4%Share Buybacks - shares declined by over 10% since 2016You are much better owning UNM at $30 to $40 than gambling in AMC at $35
"I hate insurance premiums but love insurance stocks; here's my insurance portfolio: AEG, AXAHY, LGGNY, MCY, PRU, SSREY, UNM, ZURVY I hold all these long term. Good luck!"
Management pretty much shot down the idea of share buybacks unfortunately.
"jumped in after reading Zacks review, but then I realized. wait, revenue are not going to be higher than last Qtr or last year since millions of people became unemployed, and benefits payouts in Q2 will likely be through the sky due the millions of Covid deaths, and the ST/LT disability and several health benefit that this company covers.. it was a wishful hope from Zacks, but no thanks.....I am out.."
Hired an M&A guy from MetLife and Morgan Stanley. Interesting.
Which one do you choose between treasury bonds and UNM? why worry?
750 millions stock buyback kind of grantee EPS increase continuously . Bargain price to pick up and also being an acquisition target
Why did this drop? Seems like a sweeter buy now
So UNM grows book value $4 a share after dividends and the stock goes down say $3 after dividends for a total of $7 on a $23 stock. When does management address this? The guidance was fine given how cheap the stock is
Why would UNM move 7% lower on election uncertainty. Makes little sense?
Looks like the all time high was $58.59 in January of 2018. Seems reasonable given the strong financial position to get back there within the next year or two. And hopefully they will increase the dividend some along the way.
"Based on results, will it be an upbeat day tomorrow??!Consistent profits, consistent dividend (high for today’s price), high book value, excellent current ratio, high institutional ownership..All this should realize upward price movement."
"Rate increases: In last quarter CC, I believe, management had mentioned they had increased allowed by the agency the premiums for LTC business. I just read one of the state is allowing health insurance rate increases also.Hopefully, that should help insurance companies including UNM’s bottom line."
"Why this stock has a price to book of only 0,52?End of 2017 price to book was at about 1,3."
"UNM is now in massive bear market territory, as it is down over 25% from it’s 6 month high of $31.98 to $23.58 this morning!!!!"
Off nearly 6% for no apparent reason ?????? Other than a possible rate increase or two from the FED at the end of NEXT year ??????
If one is a long term holder this stock will double in the next year. The current market is based on short term plays. I just bought some more at $16.90 this morning and I know it is less than this now. Good luck to all.
"Was reading upon LTC stats thinking about UNM.If they still have 1M policies in force, there was a following I came across:Tragically, while less than 1 percent of America’s population lives in long- term care facilities, this tiny fraction of the country accounts for 36 percent of U.S. COVID-19 deaths.If those two numbers are somewhat describing what happened during pandemic, UNM current spend on these policies would have gone down close to 1/3, which I believe, we saw in this quarterly profits of this segment.Also, during last 1-2 years their premium needs were allowed recently to be increased and as someone posted they almost doubled. If that is correct, their income going forward will be much higher for business that is no more adding policies for last 8-9 years and also not adding anymore. policies.One more thing to think about is the policies that are not renewed as some current holders may decide to continue due to higher premiums for rest of the life of the policies, so 1M number may keep getting reduced. On top of that funding has already been done based on higher number of policies already and may not be required as they reassess the needs based on rating agency guidelines.This all is good for UNM’s valuation, IMO."
Today’s volume double than normal.Earnings should be in line or better.Stock price is range bound for last 2-3 months except a spike to 32 a while back. Fingers crossed for upbeat results.
32 on UNM. I love these stocks that move up slowly on a 45 degree angle. I don’t have to panic and sell them early on the big moves up
The trading geniuses can buy and sell. More power to them. I’m buying at these levels. UNUM is a great company and the dividend is awesome!
This seems to like higher interest rates. Rates are up sharply today.
"Plus, expecting strong recovery in 2nd half of next year."
"With such a high book value, at 52, why aren't they being bought out? What is the core issue with UNM? Their earnings were decent, last quarter. I am tempted to take a position, but don't want to get caught in a value trap like Warren Buffet has been, lately with stocks like Kraft Heinz, oil and the banks."
Book value 53 dollars per common share I would saythis stock is under valued
"Have been a user of this corrupt company thru a Teacher program, 9 years, in NJ. Stories about denials and cover-ups on processing claims with bad intentions, led me to hire a lawyer when my claim was mishandled. Received a settlement in my 18 month claim period, but decided to forego the amount, $3k, they held back in a dispute. They misrepresent what patient doctors say and report and try to force customers to fight for their justified claim money in any period. They have layered departments to disrupt the communication to the policy holders. That's why they have been Sued, underthe various Names they use in the various areas they serve.Bad companies and bad practices need to be Wiped Out and/or given the Haircuts, theydeserve. Shorting this stock (late to this entity; Boycott Spending, eg Facebook group)at $15 with a April close at $4 - $6 when they are finally gutted and sent to the hospital w/oinsurance."
"Keaton finerman on CNBC said yesterday with rising rates and re open, 6 pe and 4 dividend this is a buy on final trades.... luv her"
If management is concerned about being dropped from the S&P 500 index then announcing a share buy back authorization makes a lot more sense than sending the signal they will not support the stock and allowing the market cap to drop 8-9% when the market is reaching new highs. Dumb move IMO.
"In reading the CC, they mention the rating agencies and Delta variant as some of the factors for not doing a buyback. It's possible the rating agencies did not want them to use capital buying stock with Delta variant uncertainty looming and threatened a downgrade."
"Q4 2020 Q4 2019 change 2020 2019Benefits 3,346.7 1,881.3 1465.4 8,972.9 7,496.2The Benefits in 2020 add 1465.4M,this case led that the earning in 2020 beat the estimate.why the benefit so high?Without this deduction, the real earning would far exceed expectations, may be over $2.5 per share of Q4."
Guys what do you think about earnings?
Why so green?
What a beautiful stock
5% dip perfect buying time after a great quarter. People can have their BS robinhood hype IPO
Bottomless selling.Any reason why the percentage drop much higher than other insurance companies?Difficult to hold for individual investor to see loosing so much..
