We are trading now almost exactly at tangible book value. They earn more than 3 times the amount they need to pay their > (greater than) 4% dividend. Seems like a safe place to park money.

"BCBP and another bank stock is BFIN. Over time they track although it isn't apparent day-to-day. At first I thought they tracked each other but I saw another chart, BNKU which is a geared ETF. They all seem to be doing the same things given a weekly trading or monthly trading chart view. It really comes into focus comparing the yearly charts. Given the bullish banking and high borrowing to play the stock market, these will (or should) all ""double bubble"" since we are at the start of this bubble right now.The problem is the meltdown to come if margin buying continues so steeply as it is. Banks are the first to take a hit on share price when the investment banks fall. Smaller banks drop like stones. A buying opportunity, perhaps, but it's a long slug back. For now I am looking to double. Another chart is DPST which is so expensive now, but again, look at it and BNKU and then see how BCBH and BFIN have responded. Thinks look very good for this year."
"This is a great small community bank that has a very attractive footprint in the best counties outside of Manhattan. They are fully integrated into their communities, have a clean balance sheet, efficient margins, continuous 4.6% dividend yield, and have high cost deposits from teaser rates rolling off that will make it even more attractive. At some point, this is a pure takeout."

Zacks Reach this a number one stock and loves the dividend. I’m concerned about the lack of volume. I’m on the fence about buying.
Anyone have thoughts on earnings?

Sell off might have been due to Zachs putting us as a strong sell due to earnings estimates revised downward by 1%. However I believe that is just a bot report. I consider that those estimate still project 20% earnings growth. The dividend is secure. We are trading at just above our tangible book value. At this price the dividend is now 4.7%! Re-considered but checked it out for myself and decided not to sell.

Today up over 7% on a strong spurt of buying - I don't see any news - except there is a general rotation toward value and financials. Or did somebody just stumble on my previous post decide to buy a lot. Should I ask Siri?

"Another quarter, another dog poo earnings report.This management team is unreal!Unfortunately, simple logic tells us that you cannot maintain dividend payout above 100%...unless maybe they do another share offering. Issue more shares, means more dividends to pay. It all eventually crumbles."

revs and earns missed by 1 penny each and BCBP is clobbered. But still revis up 25% YOY and EARNS up 42% YOY. And QOQ up on both. Continuing to grow strongly but stock is down 15% from last year? I guess it is just that much more a bargain. Dividend = 4.6%
