Where’s the Baker’s almost all of there stocks diving are they sleep or no longer interested?????
"Billy Dunn was at the Type A meeting. I'm not sure if that is ordinary. By the time ACAD gets their next meeting with the FDA, I suspect that Billy will be gone. Or maybe my perception is tainted by a life in the private sector."
The Bakers haven't done too well this year so far. But still like ACAD long term.
This has been a disaster any upside potential here?
"Initial knee jerk reaction followed by an irrational market. People are looking too much into this. The NEMJ publishes data on their terms, it is peer-reviewed and thoroughly analyzed. The timing of its publication has nothing to do with a Type A meeting. I highly doubt even the BBs have that much influence. As far as their poster presentation for next week's conference, they are one of many sponsors. They need material and data to present. Don't overanalyze"
"I agree with Anonymous. The Harmony trial was 38 weeks long and took 2 years to complete, so what the hell do the NEJM authors mean about a ""larger and longer"" trial needing to be run???????!!!!!!!! Would they like to foot the bill?If Aduhelm can be approved after two failed phase 3 trials and a thorough denunciation from the FDA's own advisory committee, then Nuplazid can be approved given data from 3 successful clinical trials and universal praise from experts."
"The ex-politician won't be happy, until Acadia and us are bankrupted."
$ACAD should at least be on investors watch lists. It is going to be another $A (Agilent technologies) IMO.
"The FDA abruptly decided to change the labeling for Aduhelm today. Here are a few clips from the article...""The abrupt label change, just weeks after the drug was approved, is likely to raise further questions among critics of the process as to why more clear-cut language wasn’t included in the label in the first place.“Of course this should have been done initially,” said Joel Perlmutter, a neurology professor at Washington University School of Medicine who also quit the advisory panel, “But my position is that there are inadequate justification for clinical benefit to give this drug to anyone outside of a research study,” he added.And.....""David Whitrap, ICER’s vice president for communications, said the current evidence is insufficient to show if Aduhelm improves the lives of patients with early disease. “For patients with more advanced dementia, our perspective is even more pessimistic: Aduhelm’s harms are likely to outweigh any potential benefit,” Whitrap added.Due to these views, as well as all of the backlash the FDA has gotten since the illogocal Aduhelm approval, I believe more strongly that they will work WITH ACAD to approve Nuplazid as quickly as possible since this is a drug with an established track record of safety, trial results that showed effectiveness-----maybe not totally across the board but in a majority of DRP patients, there is still NOTHING available that actually slows dementia progress in patients beyond the earliest stages of disease, and people need more than a drug approved based on ""HOPE"" that it ""MAY"" work WITHOUT trial evidence to support that decision-----like a drug that WILL improve the symptoms of DRP patients and their lives as well as their caregivers. GET IT DONE FDA!!!"
the spooks belong in prison
"i cant believe that FCC, FBI, CIA does not investigate BB in this scam.....just like last time we dropped to 13 and BB picked up 12M shares at 15 we had a perfect storm of CNN, missed earnings etc.....this time is they short info in the documents submitted to get denied and miss earnings.....in a few month ACAD will bring FDA the proper paperwork and get approved...."
"I have been in this stock for about 6 years. My break-even is about $28 a share. I must say, that I am disappointed. DRP approval appears to be dead. Even if the FDA agrees for Acadia to resubmit they indicated that the FDA will take up to 6 months to review the new submission. First they need to have the meeting with the FDA which will be ""later in the year"". We are talking about approval no sooner than 1 year not to mention that the FDA said we think you should do another study.The stock at this price $19.50 after hours is oversold. The fair value is likely in the mid 20's. Just my 2 cents. I was a bull for a long time. Sadly, I think the drug does work, but the FDA has decided to change course. GLTYA"
Volume is still quite low but that movement is promising.
if there is new data to convince the FDA to reverse then this data was withheld intentionally....
"I'm glad others here brought it up because it really has been #$%$ me off watching Steve at these investor conferences. Yes, please button up n put on a blazer. I guess I'm just old school and allow the woman to speak! Why have her there? It's just a bad look overall. It's ridiculous and yes at this point the Optics matter. They desperately need to work on their communication and presentation skills."
"I see that Druckenmiller took a new stake in ACAD in Q2. No way to know if he has added, subtracted, or done nothing else. Also, FWIW, Buffett dumped a lot of BIIB in Q2. These people have more information than we do, and minions to do analysis all night long. They make mistakes like everyone else, but it's not a bad idea to pay attention to what others are doing."
Trying to steel my nerves but I have to say I am not happy ( life is good lol. Just this company). I had mentioned mid teens in an earlier post and now we are on that doorstep. Not happy.
Well catch ya all tomorrow. Few cocktails tonight.

I ain’t got all day. Get all your sheet and put it together. Call the fda and tell them your ready and BAM drop The goods. That’s all it takes
So when do we officially call this mid teens? This is my definition. New term:Open shirt management. Lol
"The New England Journal of Medicine publishes the Phase 3 Harmony trial results. Why is that a big deal, you ask? The New England Journal of Medicine is arguably the world's most prestigious peer-reviewed medical journal as well as the oldest continuously published. It does not publish anything that is not vigorously reviewed or without merit in the scientific and medical communities. With a 5% acceptance rate, it is notoriously difficult to get them to publish one's work."
ACAD could have and should have started a new ADP trial by now instead of wasting time on telling FDA they moved goal posts.....
What`s going on? 8-10% down after hours.
"CONCLUSIONSIn a trial that was stopped early for efficacy, patients with dementia-related psychosis who had a response to pimavanserin had a lower risk of relapse with continuation of the drug than with discontinuation. Longer and larger trials are required to determine the effects of pimavanserin in dementia-related psychosis. (Funded by Acadia Pharmaceuticals; HARMONY ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03325556. opens in new tab.)"
"Fda and acad worked together for years and years , and now several months after the CRL why could they not clear out everything in 1 meeting ?What will there be different after the meeting later this year ( month ??) ????"
"This should be a case study. Compare the current situation or the two companies, Biogen & Aducanumab.You are witnessing what happens when a drug's sponsor has the FDA in their corner. They lobby on your behalf, hold off the record meetings, reanalyze failed trials, find guidance to suggest approval, disregard adcom members, disregard safety and efficacy concerns, come up with surrogate endpoints despite no evidence of clinical benefit.In the other corner, you have Acadia trying to climb the uphill battle. Agreed to clinical designed trials become useless, clinical evidence is failure, breakthrough designation gets rescinded, adcoms are not held, priority reviews become standard reviews, deficiency letters not listing the actual deficiencies are sent out, u get ghosted for a month until the CRL, meetings require requests, briefing documents must be sent in advance, etc.This is the FDA's process......this is why real progress is so painstakingly slow and the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases will continue to be decades behind all other indications."
"I think people miss the point. Regardless of FDA decision it will be increase in off label use, thus increase in the total revenue, thus the stock price will follow. Any future positive developments will add to an upside."
"Increased my position today by adding another 1500 shares. This stock is so undervalued, just based on the revenue from PDP alone. Stochastics indicate very oversold and I am very optimistic that ACAD and the FDA will work out a way to get Nuplazid approved for DRP and to the patients that desperately need it, especially considering that all of the articles that have been published regarding Aduhelm say that will be no help at all, and could even be more detrimental than doing nothing at all."
The stock is trading in a very tight range. Very peculiar. This is usually much more active and volatile. Something is up.....

"A very very small goody, but at least one:Acadia Pharmaceuticals (ACAD) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.27 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.30. This compares to loss of $0.27 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 10%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this drugmaker would post a loss of $0.53 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.42, delivering a surprise of 20.75%."

"“Although it should be noted that, frontotemporal dementia for example, is much rarer than Alzheimer disease and there are many fewer frontotemporal patients in the study than there are Alzheimer patients in this study. It's a little hard to be equally confident, but you can see from the results that all of them had a reduction in psychosis.”Cut n paste from NeurologyLive Dr Cummings interview after study was concluded EARLY as previously AGREED TO because OVER A 2 fold…well you know the rest. Finding more cracks in this FDA shameful mess"
"guys, .... this company create operative losses since 3 years ago and maybe more.... what can we expect from it ?"
Just sell the company Baker Bros and move on. Now the company will do additional secondary offerings to fund the individual studies
"ACAD has been abandoned by the market...It needs a catylist and soon before it goes to 15. I still believe its over sold at this price, but cannot buy a falling knife...been there, done that."
"Report out: Pimavanserin for the treatment of dementia-associated pychosis:CNS Drugs. 2021 Jul 5. doi: 10.1007/s40263-021-00836-7. Online ahead of print.Relevance of 5-HT 2A Receptor Modulation of Pyramidal Cell Excitability for Dementia-Related Psychosis: Implications for PharmacotherapyEthan S Burstein 1PMID: 34224112 DOI: 10.1007/s40263-021-00836-7AbstractPsychosis occurs across a wide variety of dementias with differing etiologies, including Alzheimer's dementia, Parkinson's dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and vascular dementia. Pimavanserin, a selective serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) inverse agonist, has shown promising results in clinical trials by reducing the frequency and/or severity of hallucinations and delusions and the risk of relapse of these symptoms in patients with dementia-related psychosis. A literature review was conducted to identify mechanisms that explain the role of 5-HT2ARs in both the etiology and treatment of dementia-related psychosis. This review revealed that most pathological changes commonly associated with neurodegenerative diseases cause one or more of the following events to occur: reduced synaptic contact of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons with glutamatergic pyramidal cells, reduced cortical innervation from subcortical structures, and altered 5-HT2AR expression levels. Each of these events promotes increased pyramidal cell hyperexcitability and disruption of excitatory/inhibitory balance, facilitating emergence of psychotic behaviors. The brain regions affected by these pathological changes largely coincide with areas expressing high levels of 5-HT2ARs. At the cellular level, 5-HT2ARs are most highly expressed on cortical glutamatergic pyramidal cells, where they regulate pyramidal cell excitability. The common effects of different neurodegenerative diseases on pyramidal cell excitability together with the close anatomical and functional connection of 5-HT2ARs to pyramidal cell excitability may explain why suppressing 5-HT2AR activity could be an effective strategy to treat dementia-related psychosis."

Nuplazid/Pimvaserin does work.
"7/22 NEJM Editorial on Pimavanserin for DRP patients:1. Editorial written by KOL Dr. Friedman from Mt. Sinai Psych Dept.2. Recommends approval of Pima for DRP based on existing standards, ie no dementia subtype categorization.3. Any changes for approval criteria should come from scientific and clinical community, not regulatory.4. Given the overwhelming global need for safe/effective drugs for DRP, and the favorable safety/efficacy of Pima, it should be approved based on AVAILABLE data.I've copied and pasted only the conclusion from the editorial which elaborates on the above points:""...Generating and using evidence from studies involving a mix of patients with different dementia subtypes subsumed under the “dementia” umbrella diagnosis seems to have become an accepted practice in the treatment of behavioral and psychotic symptoms associated with all forms of dementia. There is a paucity of data on the efficacy of antipsychotics in dementia subtypes with the exception of Alzheimer’s disease, for which sufficient evidence has accumulated to support the practice of using antipsychotics to control psychosis.6 Should pimavanserin be held to the same standard? Should the standard be reevaluated and future studies of these treatments be limited to individual dementia subtypes? This is a discussion that should occur within the clinical and scientific community.In the meantime, as of 2015, there were 46 million people with “dementia” worldwide; this number is estimated to increase to 131.5 million by 2050,7 translating into an increase in off-label use of antipsychotics to manage the behavioral and psychotic symptoms of patients with “dementia.” Therefore, treatment decisions should be guided by all available evidence regarding the efficacy of antipsychotic medication, balanced with their adverse-effects profile.8,9 Consideration of pimavanserin for this use should be based on the availability of efficacy data and its unique mechanism of action, which potentially confers it a different risk profile than that of antipsychotics.""Disclosure forms provided by the author are available with the full text of this editorial at NEJM.org.Author AffiliationsFrom the Departments of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Delirium Services, Mount Sinai System of Hospitals, New York."
Another big drop for Cassava this time. The conference actually was painful for some Alzheimer's stocks.
"im still holding out hope that ACAD suddenly will find some "" misplaced"" information that will lead to approval...."
"I figured it out, that Ex-politician, is heavily invested in Acadia's competitors, so he sits in on the FDA meetings, to disparage the FDA from dealing with Acadia fairly and gives the FDA some cash under the table."
what happened to this stock price
"Hey guys! Something interesting from Acadia's website today. Won't copy everything but in short version: Acadia Pharmaceuticals to Present New Scientific Data on Pimavanserin in Neurodegenerative Diseases at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference 2021 (AAIC)SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 14, 2021-- Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Nasdaq: ACAD) today announced that three scientific presentations in dementia-related psychosis (DRP) will be shared at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference 2021 (AAIC), being held July 26-30, 2021 in Denver, Colo., and virtually."
"I believe that the NEJM decided to publish the P3 DRP article on Nuplazid now to send a message to the FDA and the medical community in general that there ARE medications out there---and this one is already approved for Parkinson's psychosis---that really CAN provide hope and relief to thousands of dementia patients and associated caregivers. Not necessarily to slow or halt the progression of their dementia, but to provide MUCH NEEDED relief of symptoms and greatly improve quality of life. Now that is TRULY hope, and the FDA has the power to do that. Now----do they do the right thing? What was agreed to before the P3 trial even began and the FDA moved the goalposts? or do they just sit on Nuplazid expansion while hundreds or thousands of patients try Aduhelm and many suffer horrible side effects for absolutely NO BENEFIT???"
"maybe someone has to pay the price for acad's debacle ........ from 58$ to 17$.and i don't still understand that they can give a date a year upfront for rejection/approval but not a date for a next meeting couple months later .... i'am going to try this on my work :""well end of this meeting , see you somewhere later this year for the next meeting wen i feel great again ""...."
"If sava is on fire with no fda approved drug , what is wrong with this company,"
"Monday, at last - PERHAPS, could be interesting. Not expecting 'good news"", but whatever it is, let's get it over with and move on."
"FYI, the ""infrastructure"" bill failed, apparently due to no money to pay for it. I'm not here to debate the legitimacy of the infrastructure bill. My point is, that part of its' pork at the bottom of the bill, was to lower drug prices. If the bill had been approved/passed, the Acadia stock price would have even dropped lower and had lower profits and then during Acadia's next Q3 call, they would have had to lower their sales guidance even moreseo, due to lower profits/not being able to sell Nuplazid at a premium..."
"Forget SAVA, ACAD is the play. Serious no brainer at these level. If we get some positive news, easy double from these levels by year end."
Come on 15.10 ! Let loose those stop losses!Should I sell Apple stock to buy more Acadia?WhoooHooo!
"As a long term shareholder , 12 years + , I am losing faith with the management , again, . They seem oblivious to thier investors and the value of the SP, BUT, givem them full credit for continuing to find ways to line thier own pockets based on spurious performance as the SP continues to tank, ( never mind investors, managemt are still coining it ) .In the last year I have started to sell some ACAD and bought SAVA, while Cassava managment are buying shares showing confidence in their product while the SP is ripping, and my SAVA share value has already outstripped the value of my current 15k+ acadia shares which have lost 60% in the last year. I am still holding 15k shares in hope, but I fear I will need Nupe before it ever gets approved."
"Sales numbers should be good tomorrow. I have no idea how the Type A meeting went.If Acadia obliges the FDA's request to run another trial, it will be failing its shareholders. There is plenty of data across nearly 2 decades confirming the efficacy/safety profile of pimavanserin, including data from 3 DRP trials.If the FDA tells ACAD to run another trial, ACAD should immediately appeal the decision."
"The FDA gave Aducanumab a broad label across all subtypes and stages of Alzheimer's despite not having any evidence of clinical or statistical benefit. Let that sink in........Acadia met with the FDA following the phase 2 trial and was granted breakthrough designation, The phase 3 trial was a prospectively agreed trial design with the FDA. Acadia met both its primary and secondary endpoints, reducing the risk of relapse by 2.8 fold compared to placebo and reducing the rish of any cause discontinuation by 2.2 fold. The Division of Psychiatry then decided to change its criteria and told Acadia, it lacked statistical significance in some of the subgroups of dementia and had insufficient numbers of patients with certain less common dementia subtypes thus lacking substantial evidence of effectiveness to support approval.My question here is what substantial evidence did Biogen provide? It was clearly enough to give them a broad label despite NO EVIDENCE and despite not being tested across all stages of Alzheimer's. Clearly, Acadia should have filed for Accelerated Approval or is the fact that 2.4 million people suffering from dementia-related psychosis with no approved treatment, not enough. The hypocrisy and double standard are not only unacceptable but purely unethical."
Type A meeting held with FDA regarding DRP; Acadia will continue discussion with FDA in another meeting later this yearThat will be a bloodbath tomorrow
Price action is not encouraging. Anticipation of a plate of Type A poopus?
"Be prepared for a ""V"" shaped recovery from this drop. There is no news other than the announcement of upcoming earnings----which should be very strong thanks to increasing sales of Nuplazid. No explanation or reasoning for the drop from the mid $24's. Continuing to buy given this opportunity and expecting every buy to be profitable quickly."
What ever became of Myers? I liked his posts.
"Parkison's will be a thing of the past, pending the FDA's decision on the new NDA. No longer would anyone even need to Pimavanserin/Nuplazid, so it can be pulled from the market."
why would ACAD acquire 2 new indications (Rett and pain) while expecting approval for DRP???it just doesnt make any sense.....
"ACAD got spanked and left meeting with their tail between their legs....Davies changed his tone from FDA moved the goal posts to were looking at it in different ways....FDA recommends new trials in every indication....whomever designed the DRP trial HAS to be FIRED on the spot....instead of wasting time on this useless meetings ,knowing what the FDA wants ACAD should start ADP trial right away (and lets hope and prey they can show efficacy....what a nightmare from stopping trial early to this....."
Well Aug 4 could/should be our update.
"""FDA indicated that they are open to to discuss analyses from the HARMONY and -019 studies in support of a potential resubmission without an additional clinical study."""
"Good Luck getting anything approved. In the 1st 5 months of 2021 pre Aducanumab the FDA handed out CRLs in 15% of its decisions. After the approval of Aducanumab, it's up to 50%.No permanent Commissioner, OIG investigation, media scrutiny, etc. This agency is a mess."
"The question is for me, now that we are drifting into the teens, where does the institutional back stop kick in and or will there be accumulating? I’ve ran across some ‘thesis’ post about Bakers holding back info the drop stock. Well if that’s the case then about now is time to buy. And I don’t see that as the week comes to a close. Don’t really believe that thesis personally. What I am more apt to believe is we are in a dead pool for some time to come. And should the market overdue correction happen we have a good probability of seeing even more erosion 14-16$. This event hurt us no doubt and also shines a bright light on a ‘b’ team of leaders."
where's the buyout guys any day now its gonna happen where??? tumble weeds
"Articles out about how BIIB is pushing people to take cognition tests that nobody can pass, then directing them to see a professional to determine if they might be early stage Alzheimer's. How low can they stoop?"
"in the PDP approval FDA spent a lot of time and effort to narrow approval to the specific group of PDP, not PD and not PDD but only PDP....so knowing this ACAD went to design the broadest trial possible and brought it to the FDA for approval of trial design...FDA said "" show us efficacy and we will approve""......"
Vote!
Got to stay the course - mm's shaking the bushes - it will stop and then head back up like last time. Product is just too good even with this management.
"There is no rationale to the drop in ACAD. Earnings will be reported in less than 2 weeks, and they will show robust growth in revenue due to continued adoption and expanded use of Nuplazid, mainly in PDP, but there may also be some early off-label usage in DRP by some progressive MD's who want to see if it provides any relief to their dementia patients that also believe the FDA was off base with their denial of the label expansion----and might even be rebelling against the inexplicable approval of Aduhelm. These MD's cannot put their patients and caregivers through the waste of valuable time it would take to prove that the drug does nothing to slow the progress of this terrible disease, and may even cause side effects like brain swelling and bleeding that would even make things worse. ACAD will rise back to the $26-$28 level by earnings release, and then the movement will be dependent on the increase in revenue, forecast, and the results of the type A meeting which should be revealed either with earnings or slightly after. A more expeditious path to approving the sNDA will take the stock price at least back into the $40's."
"I feel your pain...I bought this at 20. so I am not down that much. FDA is like any other federal bureaucracy...inefficient, subject to bribes and pressure from powerful entities like big Pharma. Acadia needs a strong legal team used to dealing with the FDA and the balls to push them hard even if it means a lawsuit...the squeaky wheel gets the grease....the FDA is not afraid of Acadia...they need to be given a strong message by experienced people used to dealing with the FDA....this is mgts fault...they need to do a much better job."
When will the phase 3 negative effects of schizophrenia data be analyzed and or submitted to the FDA? Wasn't the phase 3 study completed in the last quarter of 2020?
BB please sell ACAD so PIMA can flourish.....they fired Uli to do this.....
"@Felix,Uh oh, the market cap is being lowered.The share price is going down, down, down in a burning ring of fire.Nuplazid will only have 1 indicated use and the many enemies of Acadia, even want to take that 1 indication away...It's the cancel culture, Felix that cat is in trouble.What do u do, what do u do?Do you take out credit cards?Do you foreclose on your house?Do you take out credit cards in your ex-wife's name and stick here with the bill?Do you ride the cotton pony, from here on out?It seems that Acadia pharma was overly hyped and now we crash and burn, crash and burn my enemy Felix!!!"
"Fortunately, the tourists will be gone by Tuesday. Have a good weekend, my friends."
Pima off-label use: I checked with a couple of geriatrician colleagues regarding Pima use for DRP. All were very positive on the efficacy/safety of Pima. One said that it’s the best geriatric psych drug of the decade. They prescribe it to their DRP patients by making PD diagnosis- in their late 70’s or early 80’s most pts have some tremor and cognitive decline and it’s all on a spectrum anyway- and then it’s covered by Medicare. It’s a win-win situation because patients are doing a lot better on Pima and Medicare faces overall reduced costs.
"Not a bad day for many biotech stocks and small-caps overall. I hope we meet the report with the price around 23 or even 24 if something positive comes out of conference. Actually there was already a big news called ""3 Reasons Dementia Cases May Triple by 2050"" from that conference. While it's sad for humanity it also opens bigger perspectives for Acadia."
"Q2 CC - The Good, the Bad, and the UglyThe Good1. Modest revenue growth despite lingering pandemic impacts.2. Increased new patient starts despite reduced patient/doctor visits.3. Reasonable EPS number.4. Remaining business activities moving forward.The Bad1. FDA open to further discussion, but no clear alternative path forward articulated and no associated time frames.2. Gross to net negatively impacted.3. Numerous non-answer answers in the Q&A due to either dodge or poor performance.4. Little off-label use.5. Earliest potential positive DRP partial outcome uncalcuable.6. No clarification re FDA’s evolved DRP position from trial design through decision.And The Ugly1. FDA reaffirms best path forward - conduct additional studies for each subgroup.2. Reduced net sales guidance."
Manipulators trying to shake shares if they can.
Losing grip and possibly more red tomorrow.
"Getting published in the NEJM IS a big deal! These articles cast a very bright spotlight on new drugs and therapies and are read by the vast majority of MD's and specialists. This is peer-reviewed and checked for discrepancies and inaccuracies. The MD's and panelists in the FDA also read this publication, and it will have some effect on how they base their decisions. They may also be getting calls and emails from Neurologists and psychiatrists pleading with them to make Nuplazid available to them and approve it for DRP, although the doctors always have the prerogative to treat DRP patients off-label since Nuplazid is approved for PDP. The fact that there was no associated decline in MMSE score in 9 months and no change in motor function is also impressive. This article will only be positive for ACAD and Nuplazid."
"This is truly INSANE! After the CRL came out ACAD dropped into the upper $20's. Then it dropped into the low $20's. Then it rose to the mid $20's(which is where it belongs). Now, with Nuplazid set to bring in close to $500 million this year and still expanding----the stock is trading at this unjustifiable level. And the next meeting with the FDA is coming up within the next few months and we will have a clearer path to the approval of the sNDA for DRP. $16? Really? This is one of those opportunities that you rarely get to buy a stock 40% below it's fair value. Not as set by me, but by industry analysts. This is not a 'Warren Buffet"" moment with ""when others are fearful"" blah blah blah. This is a moment where you just have to say, ""what the heck is the stock doing at this price?"" If you are selling at this level you will be kicking yourself in the head in a few months for letting your emotions cloud your judgement. If you are buying at this level----you have at least a 25% gain coming and more than likely a 50% gain in store for you. The market is very fickle, but if you can't see the ""RED LIGHT SPECIAL"" above ACAD right now, then you certainly have blinders on."
"If I was CEO of Acadia, none of this ever would have happened, we'd have approval for Nuplazid/Primavanserin, not only for Parkinson's, but for Depression, Schizophrenia and Dementia/Alzheimer's. Do you really think the pain killer for bunion removal surgery is going to save Acadia now? LOL!"
"waiting again and again and again, but may be one day......GLTL1)As a result of these discussions, the FDA indicated that they are open to discuss additional analyses from the HARMONY study and the -019 study that may support a potential resubmission without conducting an additional study. We're planning to additional discuss analyses with the FDA at a meeting later this year. In parallel with preparations for this meeting, we will also prepare for all potential outcomes that may come from this discussion.2)We recently completed enrollment from our Phase III program for trofinetide in Rett syndrome and are on track to deliver top line results by the end of the year. 3)Our Phase III program for pimavanserin for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia continues to enroll well. 4)Earlier this year, we initiated a Phase II study evaluating ACP-044 for postoperative pain associated with bunionectomy cert, and expect top line results later this year.5)Furthermore, in the second quarter, we initiated a Phase II study evaluating 044 for pain associated with osteoarthritis. Business development continues to be a key priority for our strategy to expand our pipeline for long-term growth and bring new therapies to patients with high unmet needs."
"Meanwhile.... the VA isn't going to cover Aduhelm. If FDA isn't going to do it's job, insurance companies and doctors will do it for them. The optics are very bad right now for BIIB and FDA."
What a slow bleed - All the long-term holders still holding? I am. I wish we could get some good news to bring this up.
"Oopsie, ACAD lowered guidance for 2021 and the FDA is causing more delays. We sink sub $20 now, stabilize at $15-17."
"July 14, 2021 9:00 AM EDTAcadia Pharmaceuticals to Present New Scientific Data on Pimavanserin in Neurodegenerative Diseases at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference 2021 (AAIC)"
Any news from conference in denver this week?
"they can give us a date a year upfront for rejection/approval , but they can not give a date few months in advance for the next meeting ??? If the ceo has everything black on white what the fda wanted and what the results are ( evidence by the external committe who adviced to stop the trial earlier by great results) and yet no concensus then the ceo is spineless ,and he wants this thing to go single digits .... let his head the first to be roll ...."
Does anybody what time they will be presenting at the AAIC?
OFF TOPIC - Is anyone else having trouble getting into Investor Village?
"I can’t honestly believe how bad the Bakers have done with both AMRN and ACAD. For all they’re worth, I’m not impressed"
so the FDA is supposed to approve AD because Pima showed efficacy in PDD....FDA is saying that no efficacy was shown in AD cohort.....since AD is what its all about ACAD need s to do a trial in AD....
"At these levels - why no insider buying, funds, BB? Only Druckenmiller?"
"After reading the New York times article an how Aduhelm got approved it really makes clear how totally screwed up the FDA is, and how likely it was that there were some ""under the table"" dealings going on with Biogen. There was virtually no chance that the drug would get approved and on the ADCOM 9 of 10 advisers voted NO and one abstained. There wasn't a single yes vote! And when the labeling was being established there were NO contraindications listed at all-----and the FDA's explanation was that ""the patient's doctor should be the one to determine if they are appropriate or not for the drug"". This pretty much goes against everything the FDA has stood for in the past, but ABSOLUTELY goes against the decision regarding Nuplazid. And the worst thing is that Nuplazid showed efficacy in the MAJORITY of all dementia patients and now the FDA is forcing a delay and keeping this drug from being utilized by many patients, families, and caregivers that have little to no hope right now and are at the ends of there ropes. The drug has efficacy, safety, and a history already-------GET IT APPROVED!!"
"So, if the FDA drags its feet, what are people’s thoughts on off label scripts by doctors for dementia?"
"Uh oh, when the 1st infrastructure bill is passed today and then the 2nd, human infrastructure bill, it lowers prescription drug prices, thereby taking the profits out of pharma, thereby taking the profits away from pharma investors."
"Good News!!!I just applied for the new CFA position, with Acadia, to replace Elena Ridloff.I'll right this titanic ship, straight away!"
share sale soon will be announced to bring shares to 15 or under and BB will step in and load up......
"Boy, the trading has really consolidated around $19.5. I was hoping to add shares under $19, and have a few orders in, in case there are any idiots trading after hours who put in market orders. Looks like I'm not going to be stealing any shares. Right now ACAD is a $23-$25 stock----and until we get some updates on the path to DRP approval, it's staying there or below and it's just a trading stock."
"A ray of light from the FDA - willing to have another meeting, presumably based on more analysis of existing data."

Pilot study with small ""n"" and short duration of treatment, longer duration placebo controlled trial needed:Mov Disord Clin Pract. 2021;8(5):694-700. doi: 10.1002/mdc3.13207. eCollection 2021 Jul.Pilot Study to Evaluate Pimavanserin for the Treatment of Motor and Behavioral Symptoms of Tourette SyndromeAndrew Billnitzer 1, Joseph Jankovic 1Affiliation1Department of Neurology Parkinson's Disease Center and Movement Disorders Clinic, Baylor College of Medicine Houston Texas USA.PMID: 34307741 PMCID: PMC8287163 (available on 2022-04-07) DOI: 10.1002/mdc3.13207Full text linksCiteAbstractBackground: Pimavanserin is a serotonin 2A receptor inverse agonist and antagonist used for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions in Parkinson's disease psychosis. Numerous studies support a modulatory role of serotonin in Tourette syndrome (TS).Objectives: To determine whether or not pimavanserin affects TS symptoms.Methods: In this open-label study of TS adult patients, pimavanserin was titrated to 34 mg/day over 1 week and continued for an additional 7 weeks followed by a 2-week washout. Tic severity, the primary outcome measure, was assessed by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale Total Tic Severity score (YGTSS-TTS). Secondary outcome measures included changes in the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), the Tourette Syndrome Clinical Global Impression of Change (TS-CGIC), the Tourette Syndrome-Patient Global Impression of Impact (TS-PGII), and the Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome - Quality of Life scale (GTS-QOL).Results: We enrolled 12 patients, but 2 dropped out after week 2 due to non-serious side effects. In the 10 patients, mean (standard deviation (SD)) age 34 (12.9) who completed the study the mean (SD) baseline YGTSS-TTS was 34 (9.3). This decreased by 3.6 (4.9) points at week 8, a 12% reduction in tic severity (P = 0.03). This improvement is small and may not be clinically important. Significant improvement was noted in the TS-CGIC, TS-PGII and GTS-QO. No serious adverse events were reported.Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that pimavanserin is safe and associated with improvement in motor and non-motor TS symptoms. These findings warrant further study by a larger, placebo-controlled, trial."
open and direct new 52-week low !!hope soon of some good news because this year we will have several mini crash (nasdaq -4%) and then it will go fast to single digits if this not change quickly ....
"The worst situation will be if ACAD's management tells us ""We tried everything but FDA didn't change their mind"". I hope to hear some realistic ways to get an approval and expectations for how long it will take."

#$%$ is going on with this stock. Trying to hold on but it keeps drifting lower and lower every day!! There is either something very wrong here that only insiders know about or the shorts are relentlessly selling the stock and the company is doing NOTHING to support it!! Which is it all of you who claim to know what?s going on??
Can't wait until CNN does another hit piece.
Please feel free to confirm on your own but as of 8-16 bakers and other top fund holders didn’t not sell. In fact some added. Bakers are same. It looks like Janus and fidelity shed 1M but still hold significant positions. This is good.
"This is what happened with AQST: Received CRL in 09/20, had type A meeting with the FDA in 11/20 and received further guidance from the FDA in 02/21.If history is any guide, then it seems to me from above that we all have been too optimistic about the DRP timeline."
Uh Duh...somebuddy knows sumthin'

"Does anyone really believe that dementia is going to take a break because of Covid19.There is quite a large population of boomers entering the age group with dementia and related psychosis. There are very few actual treatments available for this indication, so I think ACAD will prevail and shareholders will be rewarded and most importantly, patients, their families, caregivers will have better lives."
Socialist-Communist Government and Healthcare and FDA.
Anyone notice the 2M share short increase in one month from June-July. Might be a great candidate for a Reddit/Robinhood squeeze. Just sayin’. If not the hedgies that are short will tell you how the FDA talks are going because they’re all plugged into somebody there that feeds them the info. That’s exactly how we went from 50 to 20.
The bakers like and almost have the same number of shares as their largest (SGEN) I recall the same situation with SGEN back few years ago and look at the price of SGEN so if you are in ACAD for long term look forward for the same
Analysts are asking very good questions!
Let's someone at ACAD is trying to get us before the FDA committee again.
"What a buying opportunity here! Average analyst price is $25, and that is based on PDP alone. $500 million/year from Nuplazid and the next meeting coming up with the FDA shortly---second half of this year. CRAZY OVERSOLD here. Fair value is $23-$25. Largest position in ACAD in a long time."
"trial design in DRP worked against ACAD....instead of doing straight 50% placebo and 50% Pima, ACAD gave everyone the drug then cut it off to 50% of participants.....the problem is that Pima has an antipsychotic affect long after discontinuation on large part of participants....ACAD knew this because i heard many times on calls that Pima works well past discontinuation of taking drug....they designed all this trials to fail for some reason...."
"This is the typical hedge fund squeeze. Getting every last drop out of their short positions while loading up long at the same time. Expect this thing to blast off soon, $30 coming and $40 by next year."
"First we take Manhattan, then we take eighteen! Gltl"
The lawyers will go like most others in not being able to prove anything relevant.
"How many of you remember Tom Aasen or Michael Yang? If you're having difficulty remembering what positions they held at Acadia, it probably means in a couple of years' time, you'll forget how Elena Ridloff served the company as well.ER has been with ACAD since 2018. She's been CFO for over 2 years now. I don't think much should be read into her departure."
Do we see the first woodcock effect? Let's go gltl
if the news is bad it will be released with missed earnings for a big hit and maximum pain....im waiting with cash to pick up shares.....i dont think there is much chance of FDA reversing course......FDA will have lots of splaining to do if they approved a drug they denied a month before with no new data.....
"Just out: Biogen submitted a paper on aduhelm to JAMA. When JAMA demanded edits before it can be published, Biogen withdrew the paper!"

I don't know this color anymore.... Is it possible?...... looks like greeeeen?
Well the red wasn’t as red as I figured and for that I am glad to wrong. Gonna be lingering in this cow path probably for some time. No great revelation to many on this board. I will say yesterday didn’t make me feel any better about ACAD management. It must be the case BB’s are content with the status quo for now. As I mentioned in a post to Jameson glad we are over 90% tut owned or this would be a different story. I just feel blah right now. Lol.

The next meeting with the FDA will occur fairly quickly. Later this year still only leaves less than 4 months. I would like to hear something before Thanksgiving. It's only fair that shareholders have some idea what they should do before the end of the year.
The Baker Bros still see something in this company. no selling!!
"So---the FDA wants a study on the different subtypes of dementia? Do they expect ACAD to kill the patients so they can accurately determine the subtype with an autopsy? There are only a few types of dementia that can be definitively diagnosed without that. THIS IS BEE ESS!! They make a decision that allows Aduhelm to be tried on ANYONE at ANY STAGE of Alzheimer's(but then backtracked on that) and give the doctor the power to determine IF the drug is working(and we know that it WON'T because it has been shown that it DOESN'T). And it isn't even SAFE!!! This is just wrong in so many ways! You know how long it would take to find patients in different subtypes of dementia?? The FDA is a crooked and hypocritical as everyone suspects. Make the rules---change the rules. Approve a dangerous drug that shows no efficacy----reject a safe drug that does. Discuss and allow a trial on ""dementia"" patients with no prediscussion of subtypes---decide AFTER THE FACT that this is now absolutely necessary for approval----or even evaluation! They should all be fired!"
"This stock was $23 to $28 long before the dementia indication was ever on the table. So, dementia is upside from there and I am a buyer at these prices. Back up the truck.GLTALsNeil"
"lets say that ACAD is at 50 and BB want to sell ACAD at 100 per share but no one will pay it....now ACAD is at 15 where a buyer can pick up shares between 15-20 then announce a buyout at 100 and BB get 100, and the buyer pays 60......ACAD knew the trial will not work and still proceeded......if your after ADP why bundle it with other indications? bs....FDA same as the investors are victims here....."
today a new 52-week low !!!
Acadia is in free fall...
So watched cancord conference. Is it just me or does Steve look like he’s going out for a night on the Vegas strip? Lol that’s a lot of chest showing there Steve.
"This is from an article on Benzinga yesterday about biotech and the Alzheimer's sector, ""Investors who jump into biotech stocks based on positive clinical trial headlines risk losing their money if larger later-stage trials don’t pan out, or sometimes even if they do.For instance, take biotech firm Acadia Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: ACAD). This company’s stock dived about 50% in one day back in March when it ran into trouble with the FDA. ACAD’s drug Nuplazid, already approved and on the market to treat Parkinson’s disease psychosis, was awaiting the FDA’s label review for use in dementia-related psychosis. Trial data had been impressive, according to analysts. ""Of course, the FDA decision was made BEFORE they apparently changed their stance on drugs having to prove safety AND effectiveness and approved Aduhelm with NEITHER. Nuplazid has both and it will be approved. DRP providers and caregivers should DEMAND that the FDA approve Nuplazid for DRP so patients REALLY have something that will relieve their debilitating symptoms."
This is now just another trading stock.

I should have bailed out a long time ago. This stock has been going south and is continuing that way. Maybe I'll pick up more once it is in single digits then my average won't be so bad.
Tutes selling now...
At what price point will there be any support? This appears to be on a free fall. It did not help that the revenue numbers came below expectations. With good numbers that would have put a good backstop to the share price.
"Sad to see so many lost so much sp in a few weeks (from high $146+ to $53+). In March, I lost almost 50% in one day in my $ACAD (from $48+ to $25+). Today, it closed at $16+."
"Institutional owners are bailing out now, single digits on the way!"
"According to Bloomberg, Woodcock is out of the running for permanent FDA head, but will be allowed to remain in that position up until as late as November. I guess it just depends on how quickly they can find someone permanent. The Aduhelm fiasco was the nail in her coffin. This could mean that a couple of people below her will be reassigned or shown the door."
my break even is 20....I have plenty of time to wait...patience will be rewarded here.
Hoping for at least a $5 move higher AH when we get revenue numbers and DRP guidance.
was going to buy more ACAD but i think we have a very boring year ahead of us so will start increasing my position in TEVA.....sorry ACAD but in Steve and Stinkowitz i dont trust anymore......
How can u invest .. it gave up all the gain and then some
ADP should be the only indication ACAD is concerned about....DRP trial showed slight improvement in ADP over placebo but FDA was not impressed said not meaningfully significant.....
I demand executives to be investigated.
WOW! The Double Standard is ABSURD! How does a drug that was never tested outside those with early onset get a broad approval for all Alzheimer's? And only when the backlash came do they narrow the label! This is crazy!How do u give a sponsor guidance and then pull the rug right out underneath them after years? This is like leading a blind person down a long hallway and then slamming the door in their face at the last minute.
"Nice, -.02 gain today!This is only the beginning fellas!"
"Acadia is over bloated with 610 employee's, they need to trim the fat and let half of them go, starting with several board members."
wow what's next ?
"I am not reading anything into the stock movement over the last few days. Nobody knows anything about the upcoming report and no one at ACAD is allowed to reveal any information regarding the type A meeting until the news is revealed to the public. I think that the revenue from Nuplazid will come in as good as or better than expected. With the country opened back up and elderly patients getting vaccinated there would likely be more refills, doctor visits, and new rx's written for Nuplazid. If there is any kind of knee-jerk reaction to the downside----which could very well happen when the company reveals the plan to get the sNDA approved---I am prepared to load up because with the trial results we've already seen and the desperate need now for a drug-----any drug-----that actually works improving symptoms of dementia-----Nuplazid WILL eventually be approved for that. We only need to find out if it's going to be a matter of months, with a rewritten sNDA, a year, or longer if a full P3 trial is necessary again. I'm waiting for the news like everyone else."
"I keep holding, and it keeps falling. I’ll just average down. This company has been around a while and I hope they get their act together."
"I think anyone selling at this level is absolutely NUTS! What is your rationale? Nuplazid sales should surpass $500 million next year and even if ACAD has to run another full P3 trial(which I doubt), the stock is worth more than it's current price. 20-30% more. The volume today is very light. I have already added another 500 shares and will be adding more. I believe the Alzheimer's conference will be a positive for ACAD and Nuplazid."
"The next meeting with FDA won't be that soon. As Acadia said in the call ""So mechanically, we need to submit the request. And then depending on whether it's a Type A, B or C meeting, it will be a 30-, 60- or 75-day clock on the meeting and then we need to submit a briefing document 30 days before the meeting. So it's just mechanical rules that are in place with FDA. We are working very diligently on the material that will be needed to be included in the briefing document, and we're going to confirm that we have that clearly within our sights before making the request.""They are going to spend some time preparing new data and only after that we need to wait additional 30/60/75-days."
"Here's my take, for what it's worth-----The last couple of days have been meaningless. Traders playing the stock, triggers being tripped, and some selling by pessimists either thinking that there may be negative news on August 4th or there may be a better buying opportunity before or after that. The fact is ACAD has a drug that is going to generate more than $400 million in sales this year and is still growing---without current approval for DRP. They have a candidate in P3 trials for Rhett's syndrome that has a high likelihood of success. Nuplazid HAS shown very good efficacy in DRP in many types of dementia and is one of the first medications specifically for ""dementia"" related psychosis that has shown such a positive effect in human phase 3 trials. No other drugs can claim that distinction. There will not be any news until earnings are released due to the 2 week ""quiet"" period. So----every metric is indicating that ACAD is extremely oversold. Relative strength, stochastics, Bollinger bands---pick any one you want. After the FDA came out with their decision a few months ago, analysts recalculated their price targets, and the averages are somewhere between $25 and $30----without DRP. I believe the type A meeting has taken place and management will go over the details on August 4th. I think the pathway to DRP approval will be clarified, and I am hopeful that the FDA realizes that, while Aduhelm, which was originally approved for ALL alzheimer's patients but then the FDA slammed on the brakes and changed the approval to just the earliest onset patients who are barely symptomatic---MAY give these people some hope(false as it may be)----the vast majority of dementia and Alheimer's patients still have NOTHING that can give them any hope or realistic chance to relieve one of the most debilitating and dangerous symptoms of the disease while they continue to decline and their quality of life deteriorates. Since Nuplazid has been shown to be very safe---and do virtually no harm(as long as certain cardiac conditions are not present) I am hoping that the FDA decides to allow Nuplazid to go into phase 4 trials(like Aduhelm) with approval for DRP along with statistical monitoring and efficacy monitoring quantifying response in the various dementia subgroups----at least those that can accurately be determined and categorized while the patient is alive. Of course, if that's not the case, then we'll still know what it's going to take to get the sNDA approved and how long. I think the stock will move back up to the $25-$27 area before the ER and then what happens depends on the big reveal. Any selloff, though, would be an ideal buying opportunity since the floor is still being raised and stabilized by current Nuplazid sales and expansion. That's my take."
"ACAD management needs to press the FDA to treat Nuplazid the same way the FDA treated Aduhelm. By granting approval for Aduhelm the FDA effectively set a precedent for an Alzheimer's drug, allowing use and treatment with a drug that ""may"" work but hasn't shown conclusive evidence to that effect, and also has significant harmful side effects, which will need to be closely monitored during treatment. They also allowed Biogen to sell the drug AND conduct a P4 study following patient being treated for 9 years!! They apparently also accept the fact that Alzheimers is a ""presumptive"" diagnosis which, many times, is really another form or forms of ""dementia"" that are labeled as Alzheimers while the patient is alive because substantial testing needs to be done to confirm a diagnosis of Alzheimers and in many cases an autopsy to confirm. Many times these patients are just labeled as having ""cognitive impairment"" and subsequently, for insurance or categorization purposes given the diagnosis of Alzheimers. Since Nuplazid has been shown to be safe and effective now for years and the P3 trial showed efficacy across a range of ""dementia"" subgroups, they SHOULD be able to work with the FDA and establish a similar arrangement, using the approval of Aduhelm as a precedent to approve Nuplazid for ""dementia"" while conducting a follow-on P4 study on all of the subgroups the FDA may want(that can at least be categorized while the patient is living), and following a certain time period, whether that is a year, 5 years, or something else mutually established, potentially revise the sNDA depending on the results of the P4 trial. Of course, doctors, patients, and caregivers will be able to tell very quickly if Nuplazid has any effect on their symptoms and quality of life and will either stay on the medication or discontinue it----which will be entered into the data set. I believe the FDA OWES IT TO ""DEMENTIA"" PATEINTS AND CAREGIVERS to allow a drug that really has a high likelihood of improving their symptoms, quality of life and everyone else's life involved and is safe, to be approved-------and not have to wait any longer, especially not YEARS longer---which would be a horrible death sentence to many of these patients----and use the exact same rationale and approval stipulations that they used in the approval of Aduhelm. ACAD and the FDA need to come up with a solution quickly, for I already fear it's too late for my father, who has already had ""cognitive impairment"" and dementia for over 10 years with no relief and it has totally worn my mother down. FDA-------DO WHAT YOU DID WITH ADUHELM AND PROVE THAT YOU REALLY WANT TO HELP! You have opened the door with this type of approval for Biogen-----now do it for Acadia. These people are already dying in a miserable, undignified way. Ease their suffering, improve their remaining time, and everyone's around them."
