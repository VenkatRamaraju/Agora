"Good solid earnings and confident in success beyond the recent reimbursement issues. Many other emerging and strengthening franchises for robust sales and earnings growth. The pipeline looks amazing and well differentiated. Bought more on Friday @ $50. Hopefully, I will get another opportunity to load up more if it comes down to $50 again"

Numbers are very good!.....
"""but Glaukos' 16-quarter streak of 40% growth from year to year may be coming to an end."" Keep spinning it so it drops more. Reality is:downward revision to full-year sales guidance, from a range of $162 million to $167 million that implied growth between 42% and 46% over 2016 levels, down to a range between $155 million to $160 million. So 7 million dollars less and we beat the stock up like it's going bankrupt, missed earnings, shady accounting, etc.?"

"John D. Here this is a pull back forming a handle on the two year chart, a hold is in place and once we see the handle formed and the shakeout diminish the biggest move north will prevail. Increase position at 6% draw from peak right side cup. Target holds 53.30 low 56 high that’s it for now, Telling it like it, is good luck for now, happy hunting"

"John D. Here for all of you that follow me and know my work, my research shows GKOS has great fundamentals and has an innovative pipeline I believe this company is undervalued and is pressing north I do expect a short pullback at the 39-40 level, however, it will be a good time to establish a buy point. Once the draw back has been put in place, the stock will be spring loaded then hold on to your seat and enjoy the ride. I believe this stock will surpass its historical high 3/2017 of 52.50 my target on this one 53.30 low 56 high That’s it for now, Telling it like it is, good luck and happy hunting! JD"

As I expected GKOS 4th Qtr results were very good and the stock hit a new all time high. In reading the analysts before the call they never mentioned that the 4th qtr in the med device market is always the strongest of the year. This is because there is always more surgery in the 4th qtr as patients want to take advantage of their deductible being met and recover after surgery at home during the holiday season. Veterans of the med device biz know this but not too many analysts.

"Once again, keeping with this years tradition, the idiot traders are selling off a great stock on weak guidance (read: a couple million $). But what the heck some companies that have beet earnings but just didn't beat by ""enough"" dropped as much as this stock, so I guess this isn't so bad. This is proof that the game is ridiculous and analyst are useless!"

"John D. Here GKOS handle is now forming. Interesting enough when big institutional investors are getting ready to make big purchases of a stock they tend to put out old news to create a shakeout. This is when we stay the coarse. GKOS prior to earnings will create the spring loaded action, an increase in positions and or hold is my recommendation. Telling it like it is , good luck for now , happy hunting."
