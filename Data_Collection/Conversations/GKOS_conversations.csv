Anybody in on this 10 bagger?
"John D. Here for all of you that follow me and know my work, my research shows GKOS has great fundamentals and has an innovative pipeline I believe this company is undervalued and is pressing north I do expect a short pullback at the 39-40 level, however, it will be a good time to establish a buy point. Once the draw back has been put in place, the stock will be spring loaded then hold on to your seat and enjoy the ride. I believe this stock will surpass its historical high 3/2017 of 52.50 my target on this one 53.30 low 56 high That’s it for now, Telling it like it is, good luck and happy hunting! JD"
Is the medicare party completely over ???
GKOS is down -11.05% to 27.28
"John D. Here this is a pull back forming a handle on the two year chart, a hold is in place and once we see the handle formed and the shakeout diminish the biggest move north will prevail. Increase position at 6% draw from peak right side cup. Target holds 53.30 low 56 high that’s it for now, Telling it like it, is good luck for now, happy hunting"
why the downgrade?
$3 Billion market cap for what ? No E in the PE ratio. Eye stents ? Sounds pretty creepy to my team.
Think we bottomed out finally
GKOS is up 6.52% to 33.34
"My short position from above $42 is paying off. Next target = $35.00, minimum."
GKOS is up 7.31% to 43.87
As I expected GKOS 4th Qtr results were very good and the stock hit a new all time high. In reading the analysts before the call they never mentioned that the 4th qtr in the med device market is always the strongest of the year. This is because there is always more surgery in the 4th qtr as patients want to take advantage of their deductible being met and recover after surgery at home during the holiday season. Veterans of the med device biz know this but not too many analysts.
"Good ole fashioned short squeeze! Run shorty, run~!"
"John D. Here GKOS handle is now forming. Interesting enough when big institutional investors are getting ready to make big purchases of a stock they tend to put out old news to create a shakeout. This is when we stay the coarse. GKOS prior to earnings will create the spring loaded action, an increase in positions and or hold is my recommendation. Telling it like it is , good luck for now , happy hunting."
Perfect put at $60 strike price
Sure glad I bought a 1000 shares at $36.00 today. Hope this big AH jump holds tomorrow. I'll gamble. I think we see $70 in 6 months.
"John D. Here Bingo! Thanks to all who follow my picks. SCHW is spring loaded if your looking to hedge. That’s it for now, telling it like it is, good luck and happy hunting!"

I think I called this 2 hour ago ;)
I did not see any news today .....why the price drop on heavy volume? what gives?
"Good solid earnings and confident in success beyond the recent reimbursement issues. Many other emerging and strengthening franchises for robust sales and earnings growth. The pipeline looks amazing and well differentiated. Bought more on Friday @ $50. Hopefully, I will get another opportunity to load up more if it comes down to $50 again"
Finally Faang is right! Awesome short. No reason to go up. will go down to bottom of 50's

Today could not be more disappointing. After being up over $2 early GKOS has went negative with the market up 891 points. Horrible performance. Wish I would have sold be before earnings. Another mistake.
Here we go now
