JLL has a large presence in the UK. JLL had a huge drop when Brexit first got voted in. Now that those trade agreements are actually having to be hammered out I suspect this will one will keep dropping due to the uncertainty of what that means to their bottom line. That might be why you're see the stock price move against the great earnings.
