2.2 Million shares in the first 8 minutes? I think their share buyback kicked in.
Why is this dropping so much after good ER? All covid related or what am I missing?
Reason for weakness? Fiserv Inc : Truist Securities cuts target price to $120 from $135 * Fiserv Inc : Truist Securities cuts to hold from buyThey went from $120 to $135 after the last report. Don't know what made them change their mind. Based on the consensus PT ($143) they've consistently been below the street's opinion.
So many mixed reviews of this stock.. some hedge funds are buying.. some hedge funds are selling.. hard to gauge what the market sentiment is ... in the meantime it’s a hard one to buy at 90 pe….
* Fiserv Inc : Rosenblatt Securities raises to buy from neutral * Fiserv Inc : Stephens raises price target to $136 from $128
What’s with the huge drop in post market? Glitch?
"solid company. stay on it, growth unlimited. My prediction is 130 before end of March."
what just happened
"Wow, what an overreaction. Considerably oversold this week. A good entry point to start or add to a position, imo. FISV is well positioned and is the perfect hybrid of Financial and Technology."
"CFRA Maintains Buy Recommendation On Shares Of Fiserv, Inc.BY MT Newswires— 12:55 PM ET 04/27/202112:55 PM EDT, 04/27/2021 (MT Newswires) -- CFRA, an independent research provider, has provided MT Newswires with the following research alert. Analysts at CFRA have summarized their opinion as follows:We reaffirm our 12-month target of $140, 21.7x our '22 EPS estimate, in line with payment peers. We keep our 2021 EPS estimate of $5.50 and 2022's at $6.46. FISV prints Q1 adj-EPS of $1.17 vs. $0.99, topping consensus by $0.04, aided by cost takeouts ($129M) and led adj-operating margin higher (31.4% vs. 30.2% consensus). Revenues came in at $3.76B, in line with consensus, as strong performance in Merchant Acceptance (+8% Y/Y) helped counter lower periodic revenues in Fintech (1.5-point impact)."
Need less than $107 to buy more. Looks like I might get it soon
"Does anyone understand why New Omaha has to sell their shares of FISV this way and not just sell them in the open market? In any event, this does not appear to me to be a dilutive offering for FISV so no impact to EPS. Looks like a buying opportunity unless I'm misunderstanding the press release."
"Barrons just came out with an article that looked at the long holdings of hedge funds in liew these short squeezes. The squeezes arent happening here. But alot of their long term positions are down ytd. they are thinking they have to sell their holdings in their long positions to still play/short in gamestock, amc ect . FISV was mentioned. Maybe when they are done liquidating, FISV will bounce back up."
"From Credit Suisse..........Increased confidence in 2021 & strong margin trends drive 2021 EPS higher:Fiserv increased its FY 2021 revenue guide at the low end, moving to +8-12% (vs. +7-12% preliminary, provided at its December Investor Day) and delivered stronger-than expectedmargins in Q4 2020, which when combined with a meaningful share buybackauthorization (~60mm shares vs. ~680mm FDS outstanding) and ~$1.2b in FISV-FDCcost synergies should add up to a greater degree of comfort in 2021 & 2022 estimates(particularly given the path ahead in terms of stimulus, easing compares, weather, andvaccination). The Acceptance segment once again outgrew its two largest competitors(+3% [ex-BAMS, WFC, PNC] vs. down ~4-5% for GPN and down ~9% for FIS) on theback of Clover share gains, eCommerce strength, and a small (~LSD of segment) but fast growingISV business. We continue to believe that the increased transparency (~3 yearguidance by segment) & elevated confidence behind management’s outlook (ex-COVIDpath) is supportive of multiple expansion (vs. today’s ~18x 2022E) ahead."
"RBC Capital Adjusts Fiserv's Price Target to $144 From $141, Keeps Outperform Rating8:33 AM ET, 07/28/2021 - MT Newswires"
Reason for price going down ?
Staying low gives us all a chance to accumulate more shares before it takes off higher when FDC numbers are included in the earnings report. The beauty of FISV stock is it's stealth move higher over the years without huge swings up and down with the market. It seems to fly under the radar of manipulators and just keeps moving steadily upward. Just take a look at their long term charts to see the steady climb upward. Stay long and strong!
ValueAct builds $1.2 billion position in FISV. Thinks credit card processing business could challenge $SQ Square and become a $185B business by 2024. Clover worth $35-40B alone today.
This thing is trading in conjunction with the TLT. When bond yields fall so does FISV. Make sense? No.
"FISV just nominated #1 2021 IDC Fintech rankings Leader. 18th annual event ranks 100 WORLD WIDE providers overall. Ranks based on global hardware, software and service providers of Fin Tech industry. Let that sink in for a minute. My suggestion- Buy the Dip! FISV about to embark on long prosperous secular tailwinds."
Beautiful graph for the past 5 years. Fresh ALL TIME HIGH today.
the most flat stock and flat board I ever seen
"Sorry I started buying because of Bill Nygren's explanation of the hidden asset, Clover. And promptly the stock dropped...LOL. I seem to have that effect. Anyway continuing to accumulate."
Thanks first data
Time and price of execution is determined by the market maker $FISV $VENA
I'm still using my limited resources (I have access to Credit Suisse's research reports) to find any analyst notes on the impact to fintech from SQ's acquisition of Afterpay. While I haven't been able to find any direct references to said impact I do note analysts have updated their post acquisition price targets on FIS and GPN. Both have received price target increases and buy reiterations. So at first blush it appears the market is taking things much more seriously than the analysts. I just do not know which is right so I remain on the sidelines.
"Color me confused. In line quarter, confirm guidance, 20-24% YoY growth, analysts raise PT's, and it gets crushed."
Frank is going on Cramer tonight. Somethings up.
Ex FDC holder now a very happy FISV holder
Frank B. will be on CNBC within the hour.
"Hi I am new to this, I was not expecting such a low volume on earnings day, could this be a bad sign? any thoughts?"
"More from Credit Suisse............What we liked: 1) Clover volumes +25% in Q4 to $34b vs. +30% in Q3 (ramping overhigh growth quarters); 2) Merchant IRG +3% vs. CSe of +1% with better than forecastedmargin expansion (+~280bps YoY, and improving QoQ as well) despite timing benefit of~200bps in Q3; 3) IRG guidance for +8-12% (increasing low end by 1pt from investor dayin part due to stimulus), and EPS of $5.30 to $5.50 (+20-24%), both largely in line withStreet; 4) Run-rate of ~$755mm in cost synergies exiting Q4, with $1b in cost synergiesactioned by year-end, expecting to action $1.2b by year end 2021; 5) ~$180mm run-ratefor revenue synergies (towards $600mm 2024 target), partially driven by bank merchantwins (45 in the quarter, ~230 in 2020), with a pipeline of 500 institutions remaining; 6)Continued strength in ISV partner signings, adding 44 new ISVs, getting to 176 on the fullyear, resulting in active merchants +43% in Q4; 7) Entered BNPL with Citizens FinancialGroup partnership, enabling customers to pay with point of sale financing; and 8) UpsoldLyft relationship, with Clover now enabling disbursements to drivers for Lyft."
I feel like I should disclose to the public that I have started buying this stock. It’s got no place to go but down to zero now that I am invested.
90 in 3 weeks
Missed everything. Internal Revenue Growth only 5%. Not a good finish to 2019.
Is price too high to buy fdc/ fisv now?any suggestion?
"Just to show you how this crazy market works...........MA, V are up because the ""re-opening"" trade is on today (look at the airlines). MA, V obviously benefiting from spending (like travel) related to a re-opening. FISV, since it is associated with the credit card company's level of transactions, is up in sympathy. This speaks to the interconnectivity of stocks I mentioned in an earlier post.Anyone who listened to the CC knows the company's guidance depends on the timing of the economy rebounding. The faster and stronger it is the better for FISV (and all of us). Hence the 2.5% bump. This past Friday.........credit cards down........FISV down."
Bingo!
why wont this break 80$?
A bid for 22K shares flashed @ $109.02 at 10:00PM. Now that the post earnings report quiet period is over it may be that FISV in is the market buying their shares. Just a guess.
Fiserv named Frank Bisignano to succeed Jeffery Yabuki as CEO as of July 1. Bisignano has been president and chief operating officer since Fiserv acquired First Data in July 2019
The technical guys are saying FISV has now hit a solid bottom and is now cleared for the strong Wave 3 into the $160 area..lets hope so as loaded up this morning
"Mon, July 26, 2021, 1:15 PMIn this article:Explore the topics mentioned in this articleNEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc said on Monday it is partnering with the financial tech and payments company Fiserv Inc to expand its transaction banking and foreign exchange payments network, according to a joint press release."
I bought this when Melvin had to sell due to GME situation...up nearly 20% since
Just initiated a position here. Valuation is cheap and I'm excited to see how Clover payments ramp up.
What happened to FISV ? Down from 125 just 2 weeks ago.
FISV severely underperforming compared to GPN (which I bought Wed.) and FIS. Then again it was not hit as hard. For the sake of all you holders I hope it does well from here.
"Listened to the FISV call. Listened to the GPN call. Listening to the FIS call now. Taken as a whole investors should be flocking to invest in the space. They're are running in the opposite direction.FIS management was asked about SQ's acquisition. Specifically about ""transformational"" M&A. They regard BNPL as ""just another payment method."" They prefer not to take the credit risk from such transactions, implying BNPL is directed at less credit worthy customers."
"To anyone questioning the acquisition of First Data. Fisv is carrying $22 billion in debt. However, they generated $3.4 billion in free cash flow last year and will generate $4 billion this year. Will easily be able to pay down debt. Clover is growing faster than SQ?s #$%$ Also have Carat as a potential future catalyst. FISV is trading at 1/2 the valuation of SQ and Paypal. Won?t get obliterated in a market correction. Get in before everyone realizes the potential we have here."
"I own First Data shares, but wondering if it is worth holding for up to ten months at this price to get $FISV shares? Don't know much about Fiserv, any insight?"
"2021 guidance, as they indicated weeks ago, is in line with expectations @ $5.30-5.50. That puts the forward p/e at 21x."
"The only reason this stock is falling is because Melvin had high percentage of portfolio in it, they had to cover their short positions. Fiserv will bounce back. I will be greedy now."
I wonder if the reason the stock sells off after earnings on good results is because those in the know are aware the just announced New Omaha offering is going to be a regular event? Recall they offered 17.5M shares back on Dec. 9 and will still own 9.8% of the outstanding common after this offering.
Like I said before this company is the new Enron only a matter of time... it's being propped up for big exits.
FISV Mizuho Securities Buy Upgrade
The gravitational pull of the $110 option strike price was too strong. All things being equal the ascent should resume next week.
Going back up!
Not to read too much in to intraday moves but the stock has bounced off $108ish twice now.
https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/353074/fiserv-fisv-q4-earnings-meet-estimates
"Nice quarter, revenue is good, cash flow super and EPS outstanding. And they did without buying any stock back this quarter...I think."
"I know that FISV already owns Clover via First Data, but with all the consolidation in this industry, I wonder if FISV would ever try to acquire SQ?"
The most unpopular bluechip stock on the market… no one is ever discussing fisv or writing articles or making yt videos.. even if it’s undervalued for its growth what’s the point if no one cares
"2022 consensus EPS estimates are out, they're predicting $6.37 in EPS (18% growth). Not to say the earnings multiple is everything because there are a lot of other financial metrics to consider but at yesterday's close the forward p/e is 17.8. Put a measly 22 multiple on $6.37 and you get a $140 stock."
Down 4% on a market up day is not good. Waiting for news to break.
Let's go I've been patient with this one.
"It’s hard for me to see where this can go wrong. Is the risk to reward really this attractive?!? The only argument I hear about this stock in the near term is that people say, “All SPAC’s drop after the merger is complete.” The problem I see with this way of thinking is that BFT has already corrected BEFORE the merger (due to the macro environment we are in). Whereas most SPACS have a huge run up before the merger, and then correct AFTER the merger. Because BFT has already corrected from its all time highs it hard for me to see the stock dip even more post merger.Also name me a SPAC that is generating positive EBITA prior to merging.... I’ll wait.Maybe we could see a small dip in the next moth or two, but it’s hard for me to not see PSFE be ATLEAST a $20 stock by year end which would be a little more than a 30 % increase. This is quite conservative, but it is a return that I’m fine with for the next 1 year (I plan on holding for at least 3 years BTW). EV / EVBITA $PSFE is the cheapest fintech out there right next to $FISV Both have an EV / EBITA multiple of 16 based off of 2021’s earnings. I think PSFE has more growth potential though. These numbers can be found on slide 48 of there investor presentation.https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/user_upload/Foley-Trasimene-Acquisition-Corp-II-and-Paysafe-investor-presentation.pdfWhat do you guys think? If any of you guys have a bearish argument I would love to hear it!"
"with marijuana reform coming soon, will First Data open up their systems to allow credit transactions for MJ businesses? Working in the CC industry years ago i remember having to turn down numerous business bc of them not allowing on this platform."
"Why did this stock collapse in a strong market? There was no negative news, one analyst started the stock at neutral with a $104 target but 2 or 3 other analysts reiterated buy and RAISED their price targets. Very strange action in this stock. Couldn't even hold $100 where some funds bought 5 million shares on the secondary a few days ago. Business is firing on all cylinders now and getting stronger every month. They are far exceeding their pre-merger goals and Clover is on fire. Just a matter of time before it breaks above that 104 resistance"
Paid 22B for 17B of debt? Hope there is a plan to pay that down starting on day 1 of this deal closing.
"I never realized fisv all around us in bank industry, we sell Debit Card every day. I am very first joining today."
"I am wondering, too! I thought the split was on March 5."
"Alright team, first post since I actually feel qualified to comment on this one. Not sure if this is a reaction to Square’s acquisition, but I can tell you that Square has always had amazing products. But their merchants and target audience is different. They have always had their segregation and this doesn’t change anything as those merchants who choose traditional processors over aggregates will continue to do so. I am highly invested (both funds and 10 year career W2) and this doesn’t make me flinch (the acquisition, not the drop, cringed, but not deterred)."
Good AH action up almost 4% on earnings report!
"I'm not sure when the squeeze will be, but with all the volume and high interest keeping $FISV $VENA"
Will run to 120
The article just came out on Reuters well after the bump. Not cool.
Earnings today. This is amongst Maplelane hedge fund’s top 5 holdings. Fiserv owns Clover which makes up about 5% of FISV revenues. It’s the same business as Square but Clover processes more transactions than Square. Fiserv should be valued at 2X its current price.
"I doubled down after the initial draw down. The next day it fell out of bed. But now, it's back to where it was when I doubled down. So what I'm doing is I'm keeping FISV on a tight leash. Anymore misbehavior and I'll sell this dog to hungry Korean."
Any news in the last hour?
"Sold my entire position in FISV recently. If I want to be in the point-of-sales business without a dividend, i'd rather have hyper growth like SQ or PYPL. To think First Data is going to chest up with SQ and PYPL technology moving forward almost seems laughable."
"i took profit in shares on that, want to be long but in this market in booking any profits"

Frank should report great earning for FDC. Fisv should move up to 100.
why is this stock dropping? Super oversold as of now.
This is total nonsense how news leaks out and retail investors are left in the dust.

Anyone else feel like this is a pre-earnings run to something around $117? The 50 dma is about $0.75 above the current price.
"CFRA maintains buy. $140 price target and stated: With pre-pandemic comparisons now anniversaried and a synchronized pick-up across all segments forming, our outlook on shares remains bullish, due to our belief that FISV can accelerate its top line and compound cash flow at an above-average rate in 2021 and 2022."
Hey guys I’m new to Fiserv I know they did a pretty big acquisition to acquire first data is it paying off also do you feel like the stock is debt is manageable. Any opinions
Just opened a position today. Looks like a reversal is beginning. The reopening has begun and should surge once the delta strain is behind us. Massive pent up consumer demand heading into summer vaca and then holiday seasons. A forward PE of only 17 and PEG around just 1 suggests a fair value. Earnings revisions upwards with increasing revenue and EPS qoq. Been waiting to get into FISV for a while. Thankful for the recent pullback.
making no sense so I guess it's best I buy more at this price
Tried to post a link to Sq's acquisition of Afterpay but Yahoo rejected it. Anyone else think it's the reason FISV is getting slammed after a great report?
"Ok what are you hearing out there today? Hurricane cutting GNP , thus spending/payments revenue?"
What a sorry looking earnings statement.
Berkshire's secret investment.
"Beware of all the mentions of free stock picking sites... (all signed with women names .. )Remember the first rule about the web: If you didn't pay for it, you are the patsy,2/22/18 Fiserv Inc. (FISV) said Thursday its board has approved a 2-for-1 stock split. The split will take place on March 5, when shareholders will receive an additional share for every outstanding share held. The additional shares will be payable on March 19."
Also a lot of hedge funds who purchase this stock it represents only 1% or less of their portfolio.. 1% of my portfolio is hardly an amount of money to get excited over .. so I suppose I move on to another stock which has higher market sentiment
"FISV beats and raised. What else could you ask for? The stock is undervalued ... $105 tomorrow.Fiserv (FISV) reported 3rd Quarter September 2020 earnings of $1.20 per share on revenue of $3.8 billion. The consensus earnings estimate was $1.15 per share on revenue of $3.6 billion. The Earnings Whisper number was $1.19 per share. Revenue grew 21.0% on a year-over-year basis.The company said it expects 2020 earnings of at least $4.44 per share.

"From the CC, management does not anticipate any more secondary offerings from KKR. Instead, they may be selling some shares in the open market but not at the level of the prior secondaries."
Boom! Let’s hope it holds.

"re: Clover, FISRV, SQ, GPN, V, MA, PYPL, FB, AAPL, BABA, et als...good growth...however, going forward societal/business behavior is mobility, ease of use, efficiency, organic growth, Cloud vs. monolithic FinTech, etc...there are going to be many winners going forward 5-10-20 years. yay to all. :)"
"Anyone, please, why has this been dropping from $117-116 the last month or two??"
What happened? $3 up? I mean I'm happy!
Got a notice from fiserv that my info was breached. I assume from using their software at a retailer. Oh the irony
"What is going on with this stock? I purchased back my covered calls, because it looked like it was about to breakout, and now it’s dropping AH.."
What's up AH? Anyone?
Do the math everyone $FISV is bigger than PayPal and SQ by nearly 1/3rd. If you aren't buying into this with a portion with stocks or long options you need to find another day job.
"Whats up with the payment companies today? FISV, MC, VISA and Jack Henry all down big. Cant find news"
Delivery a better result and moving down ? what´s happening here ?
85 in the near future?
Another ouch day. Isnt inflation good for payments business?

FISV making all the right moves. Partnering with PayPal is a huge step in the right direction for enabling Fintech's mass disruption of the traditional banking system.
Looks like a pretty solid beat and raise.
