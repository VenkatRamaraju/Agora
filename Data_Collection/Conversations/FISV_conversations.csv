"FISV is a porkified company with a bloated management focus and way too much debt. It’s time to streamline management and reduce administrative costs, particularly stock compensation."
Another ouch day. Isnt inflation good for payments business?
Any news in the last hour?
Whats wrong?anyone knows?
ValueAct builds $1.2 billion position in FISV. Thinks credit card processing business could challenge $SQ Square and become a $185B business by 2024. Clover worth $35-40B alone today.
"Ok what are you hearing out there today? Hurricane cutting GNP , thus spending/payments revenue?"
Earnings today. This is amongst Maplelane hedge fund’s top 5 holdings. Fiserv owns Clover which makes up about 5% of FISV revenues. It’s the same business as Square but Clover processes more transactions than Square. Fiserv should be valued at 2X its current price.
"I own First Data shares, but wondering if it is worth holding for up to ten months at this price to get $FISV shares? Don't know much about Fiserv, any insight?"
"Raymond James cut the price target for Fiserv, Inc. from $136 to $111."
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on What*sapp>>>>>>> +447901191306 or Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"
Still a great beat. Losing Stripe is insignificant. The largest growth factor going forward for FISV is Clover. The potential with Clover is very underestimated and is their ticket into becoming a significant player in FinTech.
Let's go I've been patient with this one.
"FISV just nominated #1 2021 IDC Fintech rankings Leader. 18th annual event ranks 100 WORLD WIDE providers overall. Ranks based on global hardware, software and service providers of Fin Tech industry. Let that sink in for a minute. My suggestion- Buy the Dip! FISV about to embark on long prosperous secular tailwinds."
"I'm not sure when the squeeze will be, but with all the volume and high interest keeping $FISV $VENA"
Frank is going on Cramer tonight. Somethings up.
Time to add guys! (:
Fiserv is down 5.01% to 104.34

Super discount. I’ll be buying on a daily basis all the way down and all the way back to $107. Thanks sellers
"Wow, what an overreaction. Considerably oversold this week. A good entry point to start or add to a position, imo. FISV is well positioned and is the perfect hybrid of Financial and Technology."
"I think an OK entry point this year is around 90-95$, and a good one (well valued) is at 75-80$"
"Last chance to get in before $110 gentlemen, don't miss your chance this is overly sold and will bounce right back up."
"i took profit in shares on that, want to be long but in this market in booking any profits"
oh no. Mastercard and Visa seem to be holding up better than FISV today.Something disconnecting? Company specific?
FISV vs FISHas anyone looked at the comparision of these competitors. I am from Milwaukee so I just automatically gravitated to FISV. But FIS seems to have the same growth rate plus they give out a dividend and less debt.Any long term preference? FUnny question given this is a FISV board. But looking at a tax play here. Sell my FISC for loss and pick up similar FIS.
The article just came out on Reuters well after the bump. Not cool.
So why is the stock down so much? They beat earnings. Was there some bit of news disclosed causing people to sell?
"Why did this stock collapse in a strong market? There was no negative news, one analyst started the stock at neutral with a $104 target but 2 or 3 other analysts reiterated buy and RAISED their price targets. Very strange action in this stock. Couldn't even hold $100 where some funds bought 5 million shares on the secondary a few days ago. Business is firing on all cylinders now and getting stronger every month. They are far exceeding their pre-merger goals and Clover is on fire. Just a matter of time before it breaks above that 104 resistance"
Need less than $107 to buy more. Looks like I might get it soon
Revenue growth QoQ was a solid +10 pctNet income growth QoQ was up 62 pct
The good news is that at these prices and current EPS put the P/E under 40. Still high but way better than 90 at the beginning of the year.
"Bakkt Holdings (NYSE:BKKT) stock surges 170% after announcing another partnership, this time with Fiserv (FISV +0.7%), that will ""enable practical uses of crypto and emerging asset classes."""
another acquisition (bentobox)... it should raise value
This stock never goes lower. I know what I am holding. I will make all back from here. Not selling for cheap. $FISV $VENA
This is total nonsense how news leaks out and retail investors are left in the dust.
Down on great surprise earnings this is q gift BUY NOW on sale 10% OFF
"That little dip was fun while it lasted. Was able to add another 10% to total position. If it falls again, I’ll add again. FISV is one of my favorite total “No brainer” solid companies, at a great value to load up on right now."
Im curious. whats the news today?
