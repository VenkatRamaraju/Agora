Are you guys worried about the Sanctions and political issues in Russia? Also is there an ETF thatHolds this?
Huge premarket dump is happening right now. Looks like I made a mistake buying this. Entering the premarket sell order now.
"That dip right there is when you add, did same thing last few days."
"added more afterhours, convinced this will be the next meme stock."
"Will wait for the IPO frenzy to cool down and pick this up at a more realistic valuation. They happened to hit the market when the market was ripping higher. A few market down days and this will be back to the initial IPO target range of $22.50to $27.50. A lot of IPO's come out hot when the market is going up but come back down to earth when the market changes. Like this long term but, unless you are in for the long run, trading at anything over 30 is a suckers game short term."
Holy &$@/!!! I finally got in on the ground floor of an IPO that’s taken off like a rocket ship! Now I wish I had bought more than 84 shares a couple of days ago.
buy buy buy
200.00 stock 2 years or less
What do you think they will do with all that money from this IPO?Let me tell you. GROW!!!
Buy the dip! This is going to 70 next week!
"Definitely risk with this company, but they are probably firmly going to be #2 in Russia. Very easily could be a 50B market cap in 5 years (or bankrupt/diluted in 2)."
Down or up tomorrow?
Nice setup into earnings. Good report OZON should takeoff.
Seems a good day to add
Cyclo 3 PSS reached an all time high at 54.65
I like the future of this
Tomorrow the will be a JPM Investor Conference with OZON ... maybe some player know more :)
"Based on $se and $jmia valuation, $ozon should be trading at 150+"
Lol too funny. This is goi g to creep to 200.00 this year
The IPO of GDRX was priced at exactly $33 per share. Its highest price was $64.22. Similarly OZON could see its share price above $60. Good luck to all.
Seeking Alpha: Ozon Holdings: The Main Beneficiary Of The Russian E-Commerce Growth
200.00 1 year
someone just bought thousands of ozon that's why its going up again
"One year target $4,557, what does this mean?"
I've started to study russian in my spare time to understand this company better. Great company
OM-OZON
BCS GM on OZON: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbkEBaLx2GE
What is going on with this thing...
OZON could go as high as $300 per sharehttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4393599-ozon-holdings-growth-story
Nice pullback. Added a few below 41
So the consensus is this is undervalued. I also think that. But where is the company with some good news? Still think not many people know about this company and all of what they are into. And where they are going. A little help with some PR would be nice.
I use Charles Schwab but I could not find the ozon ticker ? Can anyone let me know how to buy it ?
buy buy buuy
Looking at panic happened with BILL and some other users caused by lack of the information I decided to share with you some of the information I have on OZON. If you have any additional questions you can PM me or leave the questions in forum. 1. IPO allocation was very low:~15-18% (1 broker 40% with low money investors) average between private investors.~2% between hedge funds.From the one side because of very high interest between investors from the other side to increase stock liquidity.If you look at 1 min chart for yesterday and the previous weeks you can see that there are lots of 1-5 mln orders from time to time. It means that funds is still continuing to increase their positions in the stock. While private investors are selling it scared by lack of the information for now.The first business day in Russia in 2021 is January 11.2. OZON has 2 major stakeholders:AFK Sistema (https://sistema.com/ ) which is pure Russian holding.BVCP (http://www.baring-vostok.com/ ) which is led by American resident. They concentrated on investment in Russia and CIS market.3. Last year Sistema presented their results on April 7 (https://sistema.com/investors-and-shareholders/financial ). Usually all of it subsidiaries presenting their results earlier.Sistema was awarded as the most clear information disclosure company for the last year. Usually all it subsidiaries has also quite clear information disclosure practices. Hope the same will be with OZON.Quite long post but hope it will help you :).
OZON (8.5 B market cap) is undervalued by looking at DADA (9.8 market cap).
"Sorry, I use Google Translate . I'm from Moscow and I believe in Ozone. OZON is a very popular company in Russia . Go to their website they sell everything, with home delivery, it is very convenient. They have free delivery to the pick-up point. And pick-up points all over the country. I see their delivery cars every day. Now, because of covi-19, many people are sitting at home and shopping on OZON. The company also began to engage in insurance and ticket sales. I believe in this company because it has been operating since February 9, 1998 and is developing rapidly."
Literally nothing change since this was in the 60s. Only more expansion and additional services added
This is probably the last time you will see this under $50.
Jan 4th the quiet period will be over....
"they report $100 B in annual revenue but their market cap is only $10 Bwhat the heck, lmao"
get ready to fly soon!! next stop 60$.
"OZON IS IN Russia, this company has so much potential at 1.6B market cap is a gift."
bought more ozon russian amazon
When is wish trading today??
I prefer JMIA to OZON since there is not a lot of precedence in the market for Russian companies. Chinese companies are still having issues and don't have the financial oversight yet - think of Lukin coffee going to zero
Any reason for the gap down today????
OZON  New Price Target at $56!
Wow
Jumia Led ecommerce stocks today:JMIA +3.97%$BABA +2.82%$SHOP +2.42%$PPD +1.74%$AMZN +1.42%$ETSY +1.14%$MELI -0.83%$OZON -0.86%$SE -3.60%$CPNG -8.15%

I hope that this will be getting better volume after tomorrow. Maybe even go in a different direction.
Cyclo 3 PSS reached an all time low at 38.11
Russian juggernaut
Everything is moved up but this thing is not moving anywhere￼. Do anyone know why?
"The Amazon of Russia is an AliBaba subsidiary, not OZON. I would wait for this one to come down. Selling for 6 times revenues, has good growth but it's an IPO and they almost always come down. Take a look at ROOT if you want to see what happens to overhyped IPO's. Good buy maybe at $20; patience is a virtue."
Any time now....
This could go much higher but this is obviously risky and not for faint of heart.
Junia and ozon both will give 15/20 x returns from wjere share price is now in the next 10 years OR LESS MARK THIS POST or they will go to 0.00 in in between.
Double top at $57. Today. Yesterday stopped at $57. Market maker’s need something from company to keep the rally alive. Just saying.
Bought in abkut a week ago. Just 1/3 350 shares. Starting to think that that’s abkut it. Don’t want to pay more then 40.00. We will see
What I like about Ozon is that they continue to invest in their logistic network. At the same time adding new services to their portfolio.
we still going
BlackRock owns 3mil shares
Like to see them get more active releasing news
If the intent of the MM is to not get anyone to buy this stock they are doing a good job. This stock has been red more then green since it’s IPO. Guess the MM’s are saying that they don’t like the company.
I told everyone to load this at $40. The Amazon of Russia!! Everyone was laughing on me
after the pull back this will go much further.

join to us on redit. ozonrussia
Hardly any competition in Russia
"Well, it might hit 50 next week. And I thought it is expensive...."
$BABA is the most undervalued gem I can find. Added 300 shares to my collection. Also adding to $JD $AMZN $MELI $JMIA $OZON when I can.
Buying started at 3pm EST. Volume is relatively low. When real accumulation starts this will jump up nicely.
Ozon filed a 13D from Sistema. Shows 33.78 percent stake. Sistema third quarter profits were 31 million. Sistema is a holding Co. in Russia that is into big things.
"like the stock for long term. Not too volatile, and nice consolidation. Slow and steady rise, will be good. We don't want to see JMIA like price movement.long OZON"
This is a long term investment. It is another Russia Amazon.
"all those guys that just bought above 48, weak hands just sold."
"good stock, buy and hold for 5 years"
"This company makes only losses for ~20 years. Early stage investors just want to return their money.OZON is not the best place to buy, prices on most goods on it are too high. And don't forget about Russian Ruble exchange rate to USD - Ruble never grows in a long term.I live in Moscow, btw.Read a good article from russian investorshttps://translate.google.ru/translate?sl=ru&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fsmart-lab.ru%2Fblog%2F660066.php"
LONG OZON
This is a great long term investment
Are there any big firm analyst ratings and price targets on this yet?
Goldman Sachs raises PT to $75
Lokks like krml starts buy ;D
Ipo market took a dump today dpor dasj hahaha too funny who ever bought these. But this ozon will be a winner. Totally undervalued here
"I have used Ozone before. To be honest, I always received my orders in time and without the hustle, so from the customers' perspective, it was a good experience. Bought some today, we shall see how this goes."
OZON just announced ready-to-eat food delivery service ... 
the PS ratio is less than 1. is this accurate.... how can a growth stock with very high growth rates have a ps ratio less than 1 lol....
I made a video about Ozon Holdings PLC ($OZON)Check it on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df7VvazG5T4
"Russian sanctions coming, what will the impact look like here?"
Ozon financials showing continuous loss expenses exceeding income since years.. want to invest but need reason
Any realistic reason for the hard selloff over 2 days??? 19 - 20 08 after buffalo for 6 days. I understand market indecision but when you observe a stock long enough something that goes against its natural momentum sticks out.????
Ozon strong on a red day in the market
I wrote 8 days ago talking about pull back. It’s a fact now. We’ll see what the rest of the week has in store but I sold puts on 55.
Ozon is up 4.92% to 52.91
This is going to be a Wall Street darling
Back to $48 today
Imagine what this looks like on a red day...
And the fun begins! OZON setting new highs
Let’s go gents! ER hopefully pushes us past the mid 60
should move after the options are started
Please don' forget that last summer Amazon and SoftBank Corp. tried to buy OZON.$AMZN $SFTBY
I purchased this company IPO am I looking good?￼
"Russian e-commerce company Ozon says it will apply for a banking license to expand its fintech services, and plans to offer loans to merchants "
Just bought 500 shares...looks like OZON is getting some interest. Anybody know why it's beginning to run?
"OZON will be added to the MOEX and the dollar-traded RTS indexes tomorrow, 12/18."
The news indicated OZON's 9 months revenue was 865 million in Russian currency? Does it equate to 12 million US dollar? It can't be...right? At $40 its market valuation is 13 billion US dollar.Anybody have any idea?
300.00 in 2/3 years
Opened a position in comrade OZON today.
OZON the Amazon of Russia. Let’s go to $100-$200. Money from $PLTR are coming here guys. New IPO with huge potential to be like $PDD FVRR $AMZN.
"rough handful of months but give it a year, we'll see the stock near $100 given their growth trajectory."
Welcome to the party Zip Tradershttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0B1il87jgo
Told ya! Russian juggernaut
"As per the prospectus, Revenue for nine months is 66,599 million Ruble. Which is 882.39 Million USD. That is more than 7 times Jumia revenue for nine months, Jumia 9 months revenue is 97.863 Million EUR which is 116.48 Million USD. Market CAP of OZON should be at least 20 billion USD. The market cap of 7.3 billion is low and it will go up rapidly once people review data."
Let’s go ozon!!!
Exciting!!!
"I will NEVER sell my 1000 shares again out of fear from a falling g market. I liquidated my entire account 3 weeks ago after watching it fall 356,000.00 all profit from last year and being in margin. The last 3 weeks has been stress free and depression. That I may never be able to buy my stocks back again. Not only am I workig in buyig then back but I am also restructuring my holdings. Any holdings that I’m buying back in buying back at least 1.00 cheaper. Ozon was my gift back today. I have a few more to go then I’ll be back in a ton of Marvin again paying it off slowly. It’s ok. I have been able to swing trade daily, and buying back stocks even cheaper. I’m happy. I will also continue to swing trade to offset interest charges and hopefully make a few dollars towards the principle every other. Ozon the Russian Amazon."
I will buy at back in at $45.
Someone’s playing with this. Low volume let’s the stock price be manipulated. I feel that who ever sells this so soon will be disappointed in the future.
"If there is doubt check out ( MELI ) Mercadolibre doing something similar in Argentina. Stock trading at $1,100 bucks. This is going to melt up the next few months."
today they fix the profit who bought at the beginning of the IPO at 47 and + today is Friday
I’m in 250 shares. Gonna accumulate 1000 gonna wait time see of there is a dip. I’ll add 100 around 35
Optimistic about this stock
This thing is gonna FLY
How do you guys view the fact that Sistema and Baring Vostok PE each own 37.9% of the holding and as principal shareholders can decide if and when to dilute US investors who own just a quarter of the company? Ideas?
Ozon will start a pilot with IKEA in the Moscow region to deliver IKEA-goods ordered online. So far no possibility to order IKEA-goods via Ozon (may follow). Can’t post the Russian news link unfortunately.
1000 bucks in 2021.
Looks like it will at least revisit the early March low....
"The 8 analysts offering 12-month price forecasts for Ozon Holdings PLC have a median target of 3,834.26, with a high estimate of 4,780.34 and a low estimate of 3,369.16. The median estimate represents a +7,190.85% increase from the last price of 52.59.Is this real?"
Added 100 more 38.83.feel like a thief in the night 350 shares deep
Christmas is coming...Where do you think Russians will buy from??
$100 + by Christmas!
"Ozon reported a ""hypergrowth"" stage in 2019 as sales for the year increased by 93% to $1.1 billion and the volume of orders more than doubled to 32.2 million. Company turnover by gross merchandise volume grew 188% year on year in the second quarter of 2020 and reached RUB 77.4 billion by H12020, an increase of 152% from the same period in the previous year. According to Ozon CFO Daniil Fedorov, the coronavirus pandemic created a new habit of shopping online among Russian consumers."
Ok back in! 53.11 x 1000 shares. That’s just like makig a g in my bookn
Will be growing ?
hidden gem. great quarter!
"Ozon expects growth in Company’s GMV incl. services of 90% or potentially greater for Full-Year 2021, compared to Full-Year 2020."
ill buy at 50
The price action of this stock has gotten absolutely horrific.
I’m out. Be back after earnings maybe after sept
"That’s awesome, how the shorts are slowly bleeding out. They were expecting a drop after earnings. Sorry shorties, but this stock is not pumped like most others. This willNot drop, it’s will slowly drip you’re blood until it gaps up. Then you lose it all."
Wants 55 next... then new PTs coming out
"lot of risk and looks like a falling dagger the past 3 months, but it's worth a nibble in mid 40s and hold for the long term."
"У продавцов OZON платное хранение продаваемого товара на складе OZON, стоимость исчисляется в зависимости от количества и размеров товара. Так вот у них постоянно слетают ( в личном кабинете продавца) размеры товаров в большую сторону в 50, а то и 100 раз сумма больше, и чек к оплате они в личном кабинете продавца начисляют больше во столько же раз, и корректность отчетности по прибыли у компании OZON под вопросом. Как и кто их проверял перед «Листингом» оставляет сомнения. Будьте внимательны в : 100 раз"
There it is--$48!
"What’s a good entry point? Seems a bit overpriced to me, do you agree?"

What do you think his target price is?
BCS GM: Ozon might be included into MSCI Russia index in February (they expected it to happen in May earlier). In case it happens it might take up to 1.6% weight there with up to 190 mln $ passive institutional investments. By the way it trades still below inclusion criteria for now.The full article (in Russian): http://www.finmarket.ru/analytics/5395514

BIG BUY OPPORTUNITY
Now we're cooking with gas. Up on larger volume. The word must be getting out. Just wait until mainstream media starts buzzing or the company releases some good news.
$50 is coming. This is the Amazon of Russia
"$69 today?Russia's Ozon to acquire Oney Bank in boost to financial servicesBY Reuters— 5:33 AM ET 04/13/2021MOSCOW, April 13 (Reuters) - Russian online retailer Ozon (OZON) has signed an agreement to expand its financial services operations with the acquisition of Oney Bank in a cash deal of around $10 million, the company said late on Monday.Ozon runs one of Russia's largest e-commerce platforms using couriers, pickup points and parcel lockers.It said it was acquiring 100% of Oney's charter capital from Sovcombank, Russia's third biggest private bank and among the country's top 10 by assets.Oney Bank LLC provides financial services in Russia and is a former subsidiary of France's Oney Bank SA. Sovcombank acquired 100% of its charter capital from retailer Auchan Group in January.Ozon ( OZON) debuted on the Nasdaq late last year and last month reported a 144% jump in 2020 transaction volumes to 197.4 billion roubles.EBITDA was negative, but the firm is seeking to capitalise on the hefty growth potential in Russia's fragmented e-commerce sector, with its own banking licence forming part of its strategy.Ozon will also continue to actively cooperate with other banks and fintech companies to finance its loan book and develop new products and services for the benefit of customers and merchants on its platform, it said in a statement.Citi analysts rated the transaction as neutral/high risk, describing it as a beneficial move for Ozon as other players in the market are investing heavily.""Fintech services could provide incremental revenue opportunities as well as support growth of its e-commerce business,"" the analysts said in a note. (Reporting by Alexander Marrow)"
We might see 50 sooner than later.....
65 by EOW?
Today we smashed the $48.21 resistance. Hopefully that will now be support.
У меня есть russian language Little bit
This stock is gonna Jumia when the it is the right time.
Amazon confirms the stay-at-home ecommerce play isn't going away anytime soon. I think it's likely we may battle with $57 resistance again tomorrow.
should be at 100 long term
Starting to see volume tick up as people see this is one of the best priced EM ecomm plays out there.
Long @ $45
I see this hitting a 100 bucks soon
"As of 9/30/20 OZON had the infrastructure in place to deliver its products to 40% of the Russian population the day after an order is placed! It recently doubled its logistics infrastructure, including a new 100,000 square meter fulfillment center in the Moscow Region. It currently operates with 9 fulfillment centers, 7,500 parcel lockers, 43 sorting hubs, 4,600 pickup points, and 2,700 couriers. As it grows, its logistics network will continue to expand which means it will become a true e-commerce powerhouse."
Why is this up 10.00 after hours??
"Full 2020FY Results: Number of orders increased to 73.9 million growing by 132% year-on-year, compared to 31.8 million orders delivered in the Full-Year 2019.GMV incl. services increased to RUB 197.4 billion with growth accelerating to 144% year-on-year, compared to RUB 80.8 billion in Full-Year 2019."
"New here to Ozon Holdings. Could someone confirm the IPO date? Looking at the Parabolic SAR and MACD indicators, it’s off to the races! It appears too new for the MA(200)."
"I know that Ozon and Wildberries are supposedly competing to become known as the leading ecommerce platform in Russia, but personally, I classify Wildberries as more of an ecommerce platform with a strong focus on women's clothing and accessories rather than a multi-category, full service ecommerce platform. Wildberries has diversified their offerings over the years, but their branding and overall feel of the site still gives me a women's clothing vibe. This is one of the reasons why I believe Ozon will eventually take market share and become ecommerce leader in the country. Of course, this is just my opinion."
does anyone knows when this company is publishing their results? press conferences or something? Im in for LONG but there is nothing about it..
does anyone know when ozon will release numbers for 2020
I just bought a couple shares today so that OZON remains on my radar. I will buy more once I get confirmation that institutional investors are hopping on board.
This is a long hold for me
Back in 53.17
All time highs coming soon!
$75 in 2 weeks or less. 30 million users soon.
Long ozon may add 500 more getting very cheap
Will be 50 EOY. ( Russian Amazon ) funds are buying in.. JMIA ( African Amazon ) went from 12 to over 30 after last ER report....
"Down sizing big time to avoid calls, and to lower exposure. Sold 2000 shares of cpng this am. Ozon I will not sell. The competition is not as bad"
OZON BREAKOUT
Zzzzzzz wake me up when they drop a PR
The company needs PR/ spend few thousand on it and not be super greedy The business is growing substantially but investors in US not aware about it.Very low volume!!
What time is earning announcement
"OZON is along term play. Buy it, forget about it, and come back to it in 10 years when the stock is 10xs what it is today. Massive opportunity in Russia for OZON."
Whats happen?
Ok in at 41.47 1000 more shares margin. It’s ok. 1350 shares total. I’m Happy. This will be a 3-400.00 stockIn a few years. With these Robin Hood boys maybe 700.00 plus
"MercadoLibre 2020 EV/S= 17Ozon 2020 EV/S = 5,2"
Whats the total share count? 33 million is all I seen is that right?
"Dropped $10k on Ozon, no reason to not give it a spin. Great business, just need to see how globally serious we're taken."
AliExpress is losing market share because of the long delivery time for orders from China. Ozon offers next-day delivery to 40% of the population. Ozon was the 12th largest IPO of 2020 raising $990 mil. Ozon and Wildberries are competing for first place.
"First Quarter 2021 Financial Results Highlights• Number of orders increased to 34.1 million growing by 161% year-on-year, compared to13.1 million orders delivered in Q1 2020.• GMV incl. services increased to RUB 74.2 billion, with growth reaching 135% year-onyear, compared to RUB 31.6 billion in Q1 2020.• Share of Marketplace reached 58.4% as percentage of GMV incl. services, compared to32.6% in Q1 2020.• Adjusted EBITDA was negative RUB 4.9 billion, which is comparable to negative RUB4.5 billion in Q1 2020, with Adjusted EBITDA as percentage of GMV incl. servicesimproving to negative 6.5% from negative 14.2% in Q1 2020."
Where’s the volume?
Well it looks like I’m going to buy again today at a discount. Anything under $75 is a discount at this point
Let it ride
