Wow
Literally nothing change since this was in the 60s. Only more expansion and additional services added
"lot of risk and looks like a falling dagger the past 3 months, but it's worth a nibble in mid 40s and hold for the long term."
This stock hasn't really done much in quite some time.
Letâ€™s go ozon!!!
Any realistic reason for the hard selloff over 2 days??? 19 - 20 08 after buffalo for 6 days. I understand market indecision but when you observe a stock long enough something that goes against its natural momentum sticks out.????
This thing is in a horrific and slow downtrend since June. Will be hard to breakout of it.
bought more ozon russian amazon
"Down sizing big time to avoid calls, and to lower exposure. Sold 2000 shares of cpng this am. Ozon I will not sell. The competition is not as bad"
Ozon is up 4.92% to 52.91
Hardly any competition in Russia
"rough handful of months but give it a year, we'll see the stock near $100 given their growth trajectory."
someone just bought thousands of ozon that's why its going up again
200.00 stock 2 years or less
BOUGHT SOME OZON TODAY AT $52.70 PER SHARE AFTER HOUR see u all for the next 20 years
