"The dividend gets paid on 2/27 at 48.5 cents a share. I can live with that. I just wish it would be eligible for doing a DRIP, because you know the price will drop after the dividend. This stock is pretty stable, however. Sometimes, it seems to go up based on the price of oil, sometimes, not so much. Anyway, the dividend yield works for me."

"Parent suspends Div, Reduces CapEx, and sells some assets...today on the news wires. Parent shares respond favorably.Implications for the LP?"
They raised the dividend again. Here is my pipeline strategy friends. Ive been doing it for a long time. Always acquire the pipeline system owned by a refiner. That's it. Simple. I own PBFX at 17.2. My only stipulation is font cut the divi. If they cut I'm out. I have been out of upstream oil (not refiners or pipes) for 4 yr now.
Their bonds are a beautiful thing as well. great safe payout
Easy cruise while collecting diva and getting to 18-20$ range .
past 11 now threshold is 12
Instability in OPEC is my guess. US gets oil domestically and a large chunk from Canada. OPEC can’t agree to increase production therefore oil prices are climbing. Oil prices being high isn’t always good for refineries.
"Does anybody ever post on this board? That works for me if you don't, because I can easily come back to see when the ex dividend date is, as well as the payout date is. Hard to believe that a great dividend player has no interest, but, what the hey?"

added more yesterday... very good company
Why is PBF falling everyday on low volume when the price of oil goes up every day?
what is the drop today. looks like major selloff
The dividend gets paid on August 31. 47 Cents a share.
My broker no longer charges commission so buying multiple very small lots no longer has the penalty it once did. I've been buying small lots all the way down. Today it finally came to rest on the 252 day simple moving average. 252 are the number of actual trading days in a year. More realistic than 365 days.

$PBFX will meet with investors and industry analysts. Here is the link for more info http://crweworld.com/article/news-provided-by-pr-newswire/303084/pbf-logistics-to-attend-mlpa-2018-investor-conference
Good work on the >$1b market cap. That is really important to a lot of folks!
PBF Logistics is expected to record 41.69% year-over-year growth in 2017 sales. The company had an average positive earnings surprise of 17.80% in the last four quarters.
Why does $PBFX have to sell a 2025 note at 9.25%? The rate seems rather high given high EPS.
"Nice article out, that can be found here under the summary, by Zacks finding PBFX to be and ""A"" rated value stock with a great PE ratio,"
I was wrong. The dividend gets paid on March 14. Today was the ex-dividend date.
threshold 11$
I thought $PBFX would be at around 12 given the $0.30 distribution and the minimum payment guarantees from $PBF. If the price is going to be determined by gasoline demand anyway I probably should have went with $PBF.
PBFX is up 6.91% to 7.27
"This is such an under rated gem of a stock. Just look at their balance sheet for crying out loud, or cash flow? I hope this company gets some attention in the near future."
PBFX goes ex-dividend on 8/11. This should provide some support this week.
PBFX is up 25.23% to 4.07
#$%$ me ! ! ! !
"good entry point, 200 shares."
is this gonna go down monday?
"Their 10-Q report, filed with the SEC, shows a current ratio of 3.5 (approx.). Encouraging."
threshold 12 passed ! ima saint. who ever doesnt enter now will lose out next week. everyone I know is going out and spending like crazy cuz stores have all the deals to make up for the losses. opening economy again. also unemployed people are getting the same amount of money cuz the 600 a week more. they are spending it I'm sure.

Why the 10% increase after hours today?
What is going on?
PBF Logistics is up 7.56% to 9.11
Great earnings report. 30 cent divi - will only grow from here Very good way to play long on Energy.
I like the high percentage of insider ownership. This is an easy double within the next 12 months.
PBF Logistics is up 6.15% to 9.50

Does anyone own PBFX in their IRA? What is the tax implication for a Schedule K-1??? I am looking to invest in this company for its dividend. Any thoughts or answers to my question??
what is this stock going to do next week? opinions?
PBFX reached a 52 Week low at 18.43
Share price off almost 30% in three days. The market has no appreciation of the fact that PBFX has the same earnings power as pre-covid. It is one of the least-affected companies. Will buy more.
PBF Logistics is down 5.41% to 15.03
PBF Logistics is down 5.75% to 16.22
Why haven't they increased dividends back to at least near pre-pandemic amounts? EPS have changed very little during the pandemic. They should reward shareholders for sticking with them.
"Breaking out of an almost-year-long cup-&-handle pattern, or so it looks."
"Whatever. I'm here for the dividend. We should be getting one by the end of the month. Too bad they only offer it in cash, rather than as a DRIP. Oh well, money is money."
PBFX is up 10.20% to 9.72
"Bought 400 PBFX at 18.65. Once Cedric is in you know its safe. He knows oil & gas and midstream better than anyone in America. Why buy now? Because oil prices will languish for the rest of 2017 and so its prudent to shift into well insulated stocks that can weather this period AND weather any additional market corrections that are in store. The refiners and MOST (not all) pipeline companies are going to come out in 2018 and post 3 terrific quarters. But you want midstream companies that are small, well connected to a refiner, and well run. PBFX is ok in this regard.If refiners fall another 3% from current levels than they become buys as well. Its ok to look at VLO or PBF. XOM also becomes a buy at ~ 80.5. Let the upstream snakes alone (excepting XOM at 80) eat one another for now. Do not look to get in them until after August at the earliest. Good luck"

This stock was between 4 and 5 about 10 months ago. So 12 really looks good. It was close to 20 for most of the last several years.
I just rebought.i have rebought 5 times these 2 months. what a loser
Not sure why anyone would sell this stock today. The dividend will go to those who are shareholders of record COB today.

"Great results! EPS beats the highest analyst estimate. Revenue only misses by a tiny bit, due to a substantial revenue miss on the part of PBF Energy, but largely compensated by impressive third-party revenue development. I am not bullish on PBF Energy, but it's worst quarter probably has passed and I'm not worried about is survival. This provides a good basis for PBF Logistics to grow and flourish."
PBF Logistics is down 5.88% to 8.31
How does this company pay a 9 % dividend ? Very curious
"I had a quick look at their SEC form 10-K (annual report) filed today (18 FEB 2021). There is definitely a significant improvement in their Current Ratio y-on-y. 2019 ended with CR = 1.97, whereas 2020 finished out at about 2.35. Some improvement in their Cash Assets as well.These significant improvements should enhance share price in the near future."
PBF Logistics is down 6.06% to 9.45
stock still in post-dividend phase---going down for support; next support level 19.65. then 19.35..
This should be a $30 stock. Then it would have a PE of 15 (2018 average for the Logistics Industry) and a yield of 6.5%

"With all of their commercial agreements on term contracts, many extending beyond 2025, barring counterparty failure, PBFx is among the best positioned to weather this storm. Their debt leverage is low, and they have a conservative balance sheet. Even if (and they have no need to ... ) they reduced dividend as much as 1/2, savings thereby $60M, they would still be yielding 20%.The point being that $4/sh pricing of shares at this time is excessive discounting of risks. That was, for all practical purposes, the claim too of UBS analyst who, while cutting share price from $18, kept a BUY $13 target on 25 March."

"$PBFX seems like a nice, stable brick to build a long portfolio on. I bought a few, and will hold. Could go up, but as long as it stays solid for the next year, I'll be happy."
Paid another dividend yesterday.
I would feel better here if PBFX would announce its distribution for the quarter before earnings.
PBF Logistics is up 6.21% to 13.00
I've been waiting a year for this stock to get back up to pre pandemic. Apparently it's not happening anytime soon.
Don’t understand how Zacks can give PBFX a Strong Sell when it yields 9.5% and is poised for sustained growth
PBFX is up 13.50% to 4.28
"Today's market reaction is absurd. PBFX earnings release: Revenue and EPS up (EPS actually up 40%!), share price down 4%. Ok, I get it that investors are worried about the parent company, PBF, which just announced closing down one of its 6 refineries. But PBF itself is up 6% today, meaning that investors welcome the move, probably thinking that would improve its chance of survival. Perhaps investors are happy about the survival chance of PBF but anticipate the closing of the refinery will bring down future PBFX revenue? But I must say this revenue reduction scenario has been priced in already, and many, many times more. This quarter's EPS is $0.71 and this year's earnings estimate is around $2.3-$2.4. The P/E is now only slightly higher than 3."

why did this drop from 11 to 9.75
Gap down at $9 the bears are pushing for
When is x-div date? What is distribution amount? Earning date is 2-16.

ive been watching this stock for 3 months now and I am in at 10 and going long for 6 months. what do you think drives the price in this stock? it seems Stable but unpredictable at the same time and I dont seem to understand how the gas price didn't affect stocks
Volume quite higher than normal today. Anyone know why this might be the case? I can't find anything to explain it. Thanks!
"Based on that PBF breakout, maybe some of those fund flows this direction???"
"It seems the new distribution rate of 1.20/sh or 12% is pretty secure. EPS estimates are 1.91 and 2.06 for 2020, 2021.After the shock of distribution shock and strong selling, we sit at 9.50. Doesn't this 12% solid yielder deserve a pps of 14?"
"More of the same! This is a great stock and I am sure it will go higher in the future, but what can possibly be driving it down week after week?"

12'S ? ? IS THIS #$%$ EVER GOING to stop going down ? ? ?
would be nice to see these guys meet or beat analyst estimates for a change. Also to just plainly publish the distribution coverage ratio along with all the numbers. unless i did the math wrong in my headt is about 1.3 for this last quarter that is good anyway
PBFX is down 5.08% to 17.95
I just had a closer look at the changes in Current Ratio (CR) for the last several quarters. I don't think improvements in CR have yet been fully reflected in the share price. Here are the most recent 4 quarters: 1Q2021 = 2.82 4Q2020 = 2.36 3Q2020 = 1.84 2Q2020 = 2.4 Looks encouraging based on the CR numbers.

"I wish that I knew this back in March. I bought a bunch of stock cheap and a friend said to buy PBFX, but only had cash left for 420 shares @4. I could have used margin and bought several thousand shares but didn't have the confidence. I am an old man and try to only buy stocks cheap. Best wishes to you all."
Buying more if this goes sub 13. Gas sales are almost back to normal pre-pandemic volume. Earnings will be very good!

"After researching this company, I put together the following memo for my friends that I share stock tips with. Please let me know if there is anything I should add or if you disagree with me thoughts. Thanks!PBF Logistics LP ($PBFX) is a company I’ve had my eye on for a while now. $PBFX is generally viewed as a company that transfers crude oil and petroleum, but the reality is that it also acquires and develops crude oil and refined petroleum terminals, pipelines and storage facilities. $PBFX traded at over $20/share prior to the pandemic, at which point the share price dropped 85%. This drop seemed like an overreaction for a multi-dimensional company that operates at both ends of the crude oil gamut.My initial intrigue was based on the fact that $PBFX was unaffected by the massive drop in demand for oil, and actually continued its steady, post-pandemic growth. I now attribute that growth to the storage facility segment of the company. Likewise, when the demand for oil rebounded, $PBFX again continued its steady, post-pandemic growth – unlike Tanker stocks and storage companies. I attribute this to the pipeline and terminal segments of the company. Basically, I believe that $PBFX has proven its resilience on both ends of the spectrum, making it a safe bet for growth in an industry that is otherwise experiencing massive volatility. For a stock that is currently trading at close to one-third value, resilience to swings is an attribute that adds confidence to my projection that $PBFX will continue its growth and return to post-pandemic numbers in the near future.Now that you’re past the Reader’s Digest version of why $PBFX is a great company, here is why you need to lock in your Call position ASAP:$PBFX Earnings Report is scheduled for Friday morning, and I believe they’re going to exceed the already encouraging projections for revenue, EPS and growth. The pre-ER bump is just getting started, and if continues at this pace we’re in for an even bigger bump Friday afternoon. I jumped on the $10 Call option expiring 6/19 as a cheap, low-risk option that could double or even triple in value over the next week.Additional Information:MKT CAP: 537.42MAVG VOL: 716,565EPS: $0.50REV: $89.53MAs a final thought, don’t forget that it’s never a bad idea to lock in a big gain. I wouldn’t mind holding onto my 6/19 option through earnings, but if my call option doubles in value before Friday morning I’m probably doing to lock in massive gains and just ride out my stock position through earnings. Hope you guys find this helpful or at least interesting! Good luck!Disclosure: Please be aware that I am not a financial advisor, nor do I have any investment related education. I invest purely as a hobby and enjoy sharing my research and documenting my thought processes."
"Wow, at $8 - do they plan to cut dividend or leave as is?"
