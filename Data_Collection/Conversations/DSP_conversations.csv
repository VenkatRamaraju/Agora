I bought in and sold this once on the bounce a few weeks ago. I keep looking to buy and hold but the stock has continued to slip. Good numbers by the company.... I feel that this will land in the teens. Holding for a bit longer. Anyone have thoughts?
"Because the remote working trend and digital transformation are expected to continue driving the software industry’s growth, we think it could be wise to add quality software stocks Yalla Group (YALA), NeoGames (NGMS), and Viant Technology (DSP) to one’s watch list. Wall Street analysts expect these names to rally by more than 110% in price in the near term. Read on. The software industry has grown by leaps and bounds, especially since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even with significant progress on the vaccination front this year, the need to work remotely and the ongoing digitalization of almost every industry have increased the demand for advanced software. Furthermore, consistent innovations by software companies are expanding the industry’s relevance.According to Statista, software market revenue is expected to hit $581.18 billion this year. Moreover, the sector’s revenue is expected to grow at a 7.2% CAGR over the next five years to $823.71 billion by 2026. Investors’ interest in software stocks is evident in the SPDR S&P Software & Services ETF’s (XSW) 6.1% gains over the past three months.Given this backdrop, we think it could be wise to add quality software stocks Yalla Group Limited (YALA), NeoGames S.A. (NGMS), and Viant Technology Inc. (DSP) to one’s watch list. Wall Street analysts expect them to rally by more than 110% in price in the coming months."
Hit a high of $35 
Sell...pump is over
"Super low float company currently, but about to change due to likely lockup expiration soon in a few weeks, typically all ipos have 6 months of lockup. Once it happens, more liquidity will come in this and people won't be able to manipulate the price just with a few hundred shares. This is a great company, pretty comparable to early years of TTD but having better tech than TTD. Their recent press release of going into cookieless ad system proves it. It's just matter of time this will start flying, GLTA!"
This stock is a lemon.
"Fk me , I’m done 60% 200k shares"
DSP reached an all time high at 61.42
is there an explanation for the 15% drop?It seems like DSP has always been sensitive to overall market dynamics but 15% down when the NASDAQ is down less than 1% seems like a lot. Am I missing something?
DSP is up 14.34% to 26.00
this is going to be 400 per share pretty soon. Mark my word for it.
DSP is down 15.71% to 33.08
Any idea on IPO lock-up expiration date?
I’m waiting to buy this if and when it hits 19 something.
Just bought more at 19.45. Now I have 500 at 19.50. Never like to buy with markets this bubbly but I think this rises in next 1-2 weeks. We shall see!
DSP is up 14.90% to 27.68

"3 Software Stocks Wall Street Predicts Will Rally by More Than ...https://www.entrepreneur.com › Finance › Stocks1 hour ago — Wall Street analysts expect the stock to hit $80 in the near term, which indicates a potential 111.7% upside. Viant Technology Inc. (DSP)."
"Vanderhook brothers are work really hard. I love founder CEO business models. These guys will do everything in their power to ensure their company succeeds. As an investor, it's all i really care about."
Wow I timed this one right. Will buy back if it gets to 13
"Instead of gambling for a few bucks here and there if you actually take some time to read about this company you will know this is a solid one. If some company is in the industry for 20 years, survived all ups and down, understands the industry, has done so many innovations and consecutively profitable for the last many years then you have found a golden goose, you just have to hold on to it for at least a few quarters and we will start getting a clarity. The only problem I see here is it's a super low float. It looks like they did not sell enough shares in the market during IPO, causing very less volumes which is super prone to retail manipulation like what we are seeing, mainly because of paper hands. Internet does not work without advertising. Only companies that survive without advertising are like Netflix, where users have to pay money, but for anything that is free, there will be ads to recoup the revenue for content. If you see their last 2 earnings, even in a pandemic like this, they were up. If you pay any attention to FB and Twitter advertising, budgets are coming back and increasing, even check out latest google's earning and their ad revenues, it's all coming roaring back, I bet this company is gonna get same tailwinds. They have their own programmatic DSP, what does that mean? I tried to research It means you don't need to add more people to manage clients as clients increases, means for same cost you can keep reaping the benefits of auto-scaling of higher revenue. Their main competitor looks like TTD, but TTD is all mainly a traditional ad business that depends on browser cookies. DSP articles have stated enough times that cookie is history and they have enough tech to survive the upcoming cookie apocalypse. I had invested early on FB and Twitter ipos, and those companies' main revenue is just advertising, just like DSP both went down to half of their near term ATH values but they both came roaring back. It's just a matter of execution and producing consistent positive results quarter after quarter. Let's see how they do in their upcoming earnings. GLTA"
Look at the fundamentals….. if the hype didn’t work then there really isn’t much here. Their growth is low single digit and they don’t have big amounts of cash.
How normal retail investor get in the pre IPO price of 25$?
Hey GW I just bought a bit at 19.55. You gonna get back in?!?
"Looong on TTD since May 2017. Hope this will move into a similar direction. Do not expect a 15bagger, but moving to tripple digit seems not be unrealistic based on valuation and sentiment towards Ad Tech. Also long on CRTO since a couple of days =Turnarround in the making."
Analysts keep saying this is undervalued :) Not sure if that is the case looking at the trend. Some stick with them due to their existence in this business for 20 years.
"Looking at Ad Tech companies, FB,Twtr,TTD usually have massive Q3 and Q4s, if DSP's Q2 earnings are a beat in a few days, then this stock is gonna roar back to 40s and above in no time. Earnings in 2 more days, GLTA!"
"GW is this a illegal set up of some kind? You indicated your are taking to a lawyer. i saw it because of the price gain today in a down market. It has no dividends issued, and why would this be bought over Apple , or the Fangs or other good companies. Their is no new news on this, I don't get it. Can you comment on this please"
Any info on DSP? I am just wondering with such a low volume down 19% hard to believe.I am long
"Digital Holdings $DGTLHF looking interesting in this space, just announced positive news, good value discount on p/s to sector comps izea $pubm $dsp"
There we go!! Keeps going up as market reverses. Let’s go!!
"For those who do not look at form 13G of other companies: J. P. Morgan owns 1.1M shares of DSP: https://seekingalpha.com/filing/5514494 That is 10.1% of all IPO shares out in the market. Companies like J P Morgan, does not get involved in companies to trade stock by +/-$2, they look for 10x, 20x growth in companies and they hold it for years to get their reward and eventually they get it. To buy or not is not even a question at this point. Don't be paper hands, wait for your respectable exit. If you want to have fun gambling without any research, there is always DOGE coin for everyone."
"what the heck is wrong with this thing? they reported a decent quarter. yes, Google delayed the elimination of cookies, but this is getting ridiculous. when is their next Q report? Has to be soon, within the next month."
I dollar cost averaged down twice at 34 and 23. hmmn...
Huge discount
I made the mistake of buying this at $45 without doing due diligence. Sold at $30. Check periodically bc they do have decent financials and prospects. But it should not be valued at anywhere close to $1b.
Oh yes! Getting close to my under $20 target!
"In at $31 can only go up from here, I hope lol "
Is this the new PLTR
"I'd almost rather be tortured than own this #$%$ Since April 1st, down every single day. Personally I think that they have a really good story and can't understand why this thing is so beaten down."
That guy who sold at the all time low comes back on down days and then deletes his Account. Strange. He will probably be back today!
I really wanted to bite today but I didn’t. Hopefully we get a chance to buy in teens. Hoping for a little ride from $19 to $26/27
This does look a good entry point now. The sell-off fog must clear soon and many will see the potential here. I'm going to dip my toe in today with an initial buy.
"as I mentioned thank you for the cheap shares. This stock will be remained wild for another few months. By end of the year, I have set price target in the range between $90-120"
"Digital Holdings looks very interesting in the social media space, otc $DGTLHF it's an adtech holding co at nice discount on price to sales to sector peers $pubm $kbnt $dsp"
Do not chase this stock right now people. MThis company is an also ran in the ad tech world.
at 32 today...here's to the people calling it a lemon.
I would still stay away from this. This company is an also ran in a crowded field and has a ridiculous valuation.
DSP to the Moon
is this a widow maker stock?
I’m hoping today will be the multi year low. I picked some up at 13.35. Maybe just maybe this thing will come through for me. We shall see!!
what just happened?? down 14% in the afternoon?
#$%$.I'm down70 %
DSP is up 17.62% to 61.47
This company should NOT have a 1.4 billion valuation. Ridiculous.
"~40M shares would be available for trading, once lock-up period ends, in next 1-2 weeks.So even more shares available for sale.Hope insider won't sell at these lower levels and price stabilize in few days."
If your trading account looks anything like mine months ago you should do something about it. Since I joined (http://Multistockalerts.com) my account has been sizzling. Join them today…
Analysts throwing out bogus upgrades and price targets...now a pump article to have more buyers they can sell into..SEC never responded to my complaint. $60 to $12 in 6 months

Last 2 days have been the worst since the epic fall early this year.
any idea why it's failing like a stone?
DSP is up 5.18% to 68.88

"I smell a massive selloff, just like last time at this point"
The leadership at this company is awful. I personally know these guys. They run a frat house and turnover is through the roof. This company should and will be valued at less than $100 million before end of year. They acquired myspace for god's sake. That's all you need to know.
"Bought 200 shares at $44.63, our nephews started this business in 1999, it'll definitely compete with TTD, no more cookies lol...."

Massive multiple on price to sales..looking for up and comers like $DGTL Holdings.....only trading 5X sales....vs. other sector comps like $AT Acuity Ads trading 10-15x or $IZEA Worldwide trading 15x
"Doubling up at $21,25. IMO way oversold."
Buy 200 shares at 44 and sell 50 almost every week ... gotta love $DSP

"Seel, it’s going to get bought out!!!"
how about peri trading for 2x sales. This dsp beast alreadying trading at 20x sales.
I feel bad for that one dude who deleted his account. He ended up selling at absolute bottom.
check key stats: cash per share > share price and debt is low. short sellers are turning the screws to this firm. the company isn't going to go out of business. didn't they learn their lesson with GME?
I am down $500 in one day on this beauty. Have a stop loss at $17. Hopefully the casino comes through for me one day soon. If not it was fun.
DSP is up 16.73% to 46.18

"Hmm, Needham #$%$ up?"
DSP is down 20.49% to 51.69
This should be a small cap. $25?￼
This is up 10 percent In two days. Congrats to those that caught bottom.
Market is more and more a casino. So many valuations no longer have any bearing on reality or even the business of the company in question. Just gambling pure and simple.
DSP is down 15.94% to 50.22
15% dropped without any news? Management needs to come forward with some good #$%$ explanations!
Please don’t tell me another scam stock!
"I am trying to understand some fundamentals.. What are their earnings, revenue, debt and growth numbers.. Any idea.. Can someone help me understand facts and compare this to a competitor?"
this stock has low float. so institutions own most of the shares. check out what institutions. they are probably lending shares for shorting and buying back in cheaper to cover there position.
what's happening today? anyone still here? I started falling asleep on this one
Barons Fund believes in DSP says it will eventually do very well.
Viant $DSP another good comp showing good value discount on Digital Holdings
DSP reached an all time high at 69.10
Viant Technology is down 15.12% to 28.86
"Gotta love this stock - showing very very similar signs as TTD before it broke out! Low float, great business with solid margins & ad spend is picking up rapidly as we speak! Would love to know your thoughts on this"
"Digital Holdings looks very interesting $DGTLHF great value early stage adtech play, deep discount to Viant on price to sales"
Anyone gonna buy in 12s? I already got lucky on this one. Don’t think I’m gonna press my luck again. Godspeed.

Buy buy buy...let the volume go up...
Almost in my buy zone! 19s is where I’ll buy and hope for run to 25/26.
Let’s get to the teens already so I can give this puppy a little ride!!
Ha. I have a $17 stop loss but it didn’t hit today even though it says low was $17. What a costly couple days with this junk at the casino for me. Thought I was out but I’m still holding for now!
what do people see in these companies there 20million in equity and also 12.8M shares outstanding which gives it a liquid value of = 1.58 talk about a bullmarket lol
DSP is down 15.33% to 27.86
What the heck did they say at the B of A conference??? Down $5??
Viant Technology is up 12.00% to 17.90
Up and comer digital media / martech / adtech mini SPAC - DGTL Holdings Inc. - $DGTL $DGTHF - huge growth potential and the story has just begun.....trading less than 5x sales.
this should be a $200 stock. Way undervalued
What a bummer. I picked up this stock last week. It keeps falling ever since. It was up in the morning yesterday. But i like the positive reactions in this conversation.
What is going on today? Market screaming higher and this down 8%???
"Every growth stock has experienced a massive pullback from ATH; It's not unique to DSP. If you believe the market is wrong buy more. Know that momentum and sentiment creates inefficiencies in the SHORT TERM. Especially with growth stocks. This is a buying opportunity for longs. And since we can't time the bottom, it's better to just DCA into a second position. This could fall back to IPO price or lower, but it doesn't change the fundamentals of the business. I will be buying every day it closes red at EOD."
Don't understand the pressure on this. I thought they reported a good quarter. Their outlook is fantastic-- very well documented and illustrated by the company. Major tailwinds for this company.
not worth at this price..
thanks for the cheap shares. This will rock back to $55 within a month
I might have missed my buying chance. This thing can be $30 by end of week. Oh well.
Woohooooo finally caught a bottom!!! Gonna sell now. 15 percent gain in a week!
"Digital Holdings looks interesting $DGTLHF , good value early stage adtech play, at deep discount to sector peers $pubm $izea $apps $dsp on p/s"
Down 35%-- more than a third of its value-- in the last 10 trading days. Nuts. Company has a great future.
This is up 25 percent in a week!!
"Yeah, no news and up big on a down day. Interesting! Either something is up with pending news or Reddit crowd is on the trail. Either way, let it run to 1000"
"nasdaq evaluates it at $1.3B, public did $3.5B...who is more D ??? to spend money to buy it"
Congratulations to the Vanderhook brothers for a successful business that started at home...
Laura Martin has been accumulating shares with an excellent track record. This looks like manipulation to me just like ATER recently when it down to low $3s a few weeks ago & just hit $20 today.
Daaamm. My $17 order actually got filled. This was 70+…what changed? Hype alone can’t be the reason.
"What’s going on on with this company , lost over 12% just for 2 trading days come on! The company is good , paper work looks nice , q1 result is profitable what’s going on ?"
DSP is down 17.03% to 42.00
This one is a Millionaire Maker!
They are hardly growing to be called the new TradeDesk.... their revenues are not that big to have this sort of single digit growth. I think there are other options in the space with a brighter future.
Amazing opportunity to buy more.
