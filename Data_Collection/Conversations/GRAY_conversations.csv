"As previously posted, I own both $ZIOP and $IFRX, and both are flying today!Also own $GRAY, which I feel is another sleeper stock that has huge upside potential. (GRAY's cash on hand is about equal to the entire market cap of the company right now. Which is a big positive for a small biotech like GRAY.)"
Lets take this thing to AMC status !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Graybug is going to have PR this month on their 6 month dosing on sunitinib. The problem with this stock is the dosing of their product is 6 - 12 months long. So unless they announce additional product line, really not much PR in between which means it’s wide open for manipulation by short. I welcome the shorts to take it lower. Would be happy to average down my buy as i see good positive phase 3 results this month."
GRAY has shown success treating wet AMD (macular degeneration) with Altissimo approval. Potentially a wide spread treatment program for ophthalmology patients.
"Guys this just small consolidation , this one is gearing up big run . Way the pattern and volume of trading is happening we should understand this going to be Biotech meme with short squeeze . Moreover insiders have bought this @16$ this will be worth getting in now"
"Gee~~, it looks bad. It appears that the SHORTs are winning. Where are the LONGs?"
I’m holding from $6.8 now it’s $5.3 and I’m worried. What do you guys think should I close it with losses
Graybug Vision is up 14.81% to 5.97
I'm going to have a good laugh due to GRAY.Because I know $4.00 will soon prove to be a bargain price that many simply failed to act on.You'll see...
I guess whoever is shorting will be heading to the bank today
Always better to sell in 3’s than 2’s. DO NOT HOLD.
nice
Bought 1100 shares at average cost of 7.25 i read the news and couldn’t find any evidence to support the level of sell of.
"we are getting closer for next big is run don't sell hold it , Hedge funds and insiders are positive on this for >4X returns. soon it will going to cross $10 , Do your homework on insiders and Hedge fund holding GL"
"more shorties post, more desperate they are. psych 101"
"Gonna try shorting this, the volume is way too light"
C'mon GREEN!!!!!
Buying restarting soon .....
"GRAY $78.2m onhand + Q2 EPS $(0.36) =94.7% improvement YoY!!!8/11 filing: ""As of June 30, 2021, the company's cash and cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments totaled $78.2 million.

c'mon 5.00
"The longer you hold, The more you'll lose. Guaranteed!"
Every time the shorties make a comment double your buying order !!!!!!!!￼
Graybug Vision is up 12.24% to 4.86
i feel bad for the call options dudes
"Incredible how 10k shares can take this down 5%. All bids get pulled at same time so it crashes. It's also happening across biotech, low volume dumps... Who knows when/if bio turns around soon."
GRAY gonna spike back to $7 - $9Don’t miss out when it does !!!!!!
"Investors (both LONGs and SHORTs) in GRAY need to pay close attention to this stock because the Jul 16, 2021 $7.50 Call has some high implied volatility of equity options, which may show how much movement the market is expecting in the future. I wonder whether the Options Market will predict a spike in GRAY in about two weeks."
"Hit $7.64 AH ""thus far"". Met June 18th call option of $7.5. Tomorrow, with volume, if it breaks $8.72 it could potentially gap up to $16+ a share. If there is a squeeze and/or sympathy in play, could potentially hit 52 week high. Hope it works out well for everyone invested."
"This is my ""watching the paint dry"" stock.Regardless, I'm resolutely holding as I feel GRAY will eventually move much higher up.(And I own the stock and not options, so my patience level will not come into play here...)"
Do NOT Hold. Selllllllllll
GRAY very oversold showing some reversal uptrend today. Low risk high reward stock. $6.97 3 days ago now $5.26.
10M volume in 2 hrs. Short squeeze has started. will continue this week
Green! by EOD
power hours coming hold tight
Sell before you are forced to sell in 3’s. You can always buy back in.
Tomorrow will be interesting. Low volume end of quarter rebalancing. Anyone know if gray hit SSR list?? Close down 10%.
the call options for the 16 are not looking good right?
In on Dip for more that’s all say about that LOL
to $8 today ?
Good idea... someone tell the robinhooders... with the float this low they could drive it to $500 in the blink of an eye.
"Picked up another 5000 today , going pop and spike back to 7.50-8 , LETS GOOOOOO GRAY"
Pre bell ALL-TIME-LOW. Do not hold.
Just be ready to see again 12-15$
Just added another 1000 #$%$ let?s go GRAY !!!!!!!!!Altissimo approval !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Last hour of Trading today. Ready for a Lift off to 7 ?
Why going up?
3’s before 5’s. SELLLLLLL
We hitting 6 tomorrow. Book it
I like this consolidation. If we break it we go again to 15-30$ levels. This is easy money. I love overreactions. I m all in
"It looks that the last 7-days of the breeding are finally stopped. Hope today is a turning point and GRAY starts to move to the July 16, 2021 CALL $7.50 and higher."
Do we close green... yay or nay... thumbs it.
Last one month steady rise from 3.5$-7$. soon gonna go for 10.
Wow. This thing went from. 20 to 3. I picked a winner with this one.
Graybug Vision is up 12.40% to 4.17
"A none stop decline since Feb 9th, the end is not near my friends. It’ll hit 2’s and maybe even 1’s where it will stall for years to come. Don’t hold"
The SHORTs are controlling the price pretty well. It is interesting to see what will happen tomorrow.
call options expiring in the money?
I’m just not worried... and down 50% I am only in for 2k but I feel like my odds of making 10 are better then going to 500... one good result. That’s all.
will go back to $20...buy..buy..buy
"Two stocks I went long this week, as I feel both have the potential to quickly trade MUCH higher.$IFRX and $GRAY.Pull up the charts on both of these stocks and then do some research. I'm expecting big moves on both of these stocks (meaning, at minimum into the teens) well prior to the end of this year. Just buy and patiently wait; both will pay off.This is my only post on these stocks until they move up.Prices as of today: IFRX - $2.52. GRAY - $4.20."
I called it first. Yesterday’s action was just a head-fake before the next leg down which has started happening already. DO NOT HOLD
We desperately need higher volume!
i guess we wait and buy again laterDANG!!!!!
"Just looked at the daily chart (missed the price action all day today). Holy cow, GRAY looks like it's going to pop off!!! I bet we're going to blow past 7.00 before end of the week."
Has an average price target of $14Cheap nowGonna hit 10-$12 with in 10 days Save this postAm in at $4.35
"Closer to All-Time-Low than 5’s. No stock has gone so low that can’t go lower. You can hold for as long as you wish, just don’t expect any change in trend."
Short squeeze Started .................
"Amazingly, three stocks that I own ($RKLB, $IFRX and $ZIOP), and have previously posted about, are all up big today.(While a couple of others are flat, which seems a win seeing as the market is red today.)And then there's my $GRAY. Which is also up, but no where near where I feel it should be. Yet.But I've been patient with the others, and I will remain patient here.(And especially so, as GRAY's currently tiny market cap - and previous highs - allow for some big moves if big money players decide to jump back in.)GRAY - my ""watching paint dry"" stock. :-)"
"Huge overreaction, gonna catch the rebound, strong buy"
is r/g day possible?
Looking forward to a strong end of month buying for GRAY. Lots of interest out there could really spring this one into higher levels.
"If it crosses 6.16 , we may have a lift off today"
Announce the approval ...................PLEASE
"The more you buy, the lower it goes and the longer you hold the more you’ll lose. Guaranteed!"
What a move!
"Based on 4 ranked analysts offering 12 month price targets for GRAY in the last 3 months, the average price target is $14.00, with a high estimate of $23.00 and a low estimate of $8.00. Since the mixed news on March 8, 4 Analyst have provided ptice targets of 8, 10, 15 and 23 ($14 average). This stock has been oversold, and not for great reason, #1 mixed results caused by a dosing issue, the drug still showed effectiveness and no negative implications or complications. #2 the pharmaceutical sector is being firesold, as people move their baskets into value stocks for the summer season, and large firms look to new emerging trends. When I buy a stock and it falls well beyond expectation... I buy more, i am holding and if this falls below $5.00 i will add to my position. Do not sell at a loss, that is not ""how winning is done"". - Rocky"
Starting of the run ...........short squeeze coming soon
 SELLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
I allowed myself to bag hold this SMHHHHH
"Oversold.. it wouldn’t surprise me if it gaps up before it opens tomorrow. Most of us have seen stocks like this close at $7.25 and open at $8+ .. of course we’ve seen it go the other way too, but this is oversold, so I don’t think it will happen down"
Selling any PUMP.
"I added another 15,000 shares. TSLA is extending a hostile takeover bid. Get in. $67 by the close."
Im in
"Great news this morning! I knew IFRX would soon see a big turn around; and especially so seeing as IFRX traded in the $50s in 2019.$3.00 was simply ridiculous.As previously posted, I'm also in two other biotechs: $ZIOP, $GRAY. ZIOP had a big mve yesterday, but like IFRX it has a LOT of upside potential. Like IFRX, I expect ZIOP will soon be trading in the teens.GRAY hasn't moved yet, but take a look at the chart. Because once GRAY does start to move up - and it eventually will - it, too, will easily jump back into at minimum the teens.Happy to see IFRX longs making some money today. That said, I'm holding, because I believe this is just the start for IFRX.Patience..."
shorts will be FRIED. no doubt.
I am here for GRAY. Any thoughts?
I think I'm going to buy the July 16 callsSone things up
Already long on this one and will buy an Porsche before I sell there U go !!!
Just added another 2500 shares go GRAY !!!!!!!!! Altissimo approval !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Smart investments, will buy this through power hour, then the aftermarket will spike and tomorrow we all get new shoes!"
breakout price tomorrow $16.70 or higher
Every time the shorties make a comment double your buying order !!!!!!!!
"Will the Options Market predict a spike in GRAY? The SHORTs need to pay close attention to this stock because the July 16, 2021 $7.50 Call has a very high implied volatility, which shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. I am a LONG and hope the stock price will pass up $7.50 before July 16, 2021."
this is running to 25 easy
Graybug expects to report the results from the ongoing six-month extension period of ALTISSIMO by the end of this year.
Sold everything and moved on.

Zero shares available on Schwab to short this. I've never seen that before.
"Look at TAL, EDU and learn from others mistake. DO NOT HOLD."
next stop 3?
12$ tomorrow? I think people have no idea about the trial. Positive news
Buying another 5000 on Tuesday It will be spiking to $7.50
C'mon Green again
I think we will finally head up from here.........................Hopefully good news tomorrow!
"I did study how to have gains on this stock. Detail is the following:I chose to invest $10,000 dollars on GRAY stock, and try to figure out opportunities to make gains, and lessons I learn from my own experience. OpportunitiesIt is risky to purchase $10,000 US dollars. I have maximum loss around $5000, 50% with 1280 shares, ave cost $7.2/ share. Here are opportunities of GRAY easy for me to catch, but I still did not take the opportunities. 1. Price went down $3.6/ share, I should purchase another 1000 shares of Gray; I was not on the track, worried about $5000 loss; Stay positive; It creates opportunity to short squeeze.2. On June 11, sell 1280 shares at price $8.5/ share. Make profit $1400 dollars. I tried to make more money. My expectation went higher, think about $12/ share instead. Try to play with the market, and take steps to build wealth. The stock is risky, the first step is not to lose money; 3. On June 17, 2021, short squeeze, there are four times from $5.2 to $6.0. 10% gain four times in less than one hour;4. Compared to NOK 4500 -> 3500 shares, GTE.TO 12000 shares, it is better for me to adapt high risky biotech, learn from this investment. GRAY stock is possible to make huge gains; 5. Do not be scared. I still have at least 12 months to learn from this investment and make profit. GRAY can still run another 12 months without financial problems. Just hold and wait short squeeze. Drop me a hint if you have."
Wanna make a killing everyday? Buy the dip on GRAY during the first 30 minutes of trading and sell before the close! So predictable! 
It’s going back to all-time high
What do you think 
more sinking
We all know Bechody is shorting. Just hold and we will be back $15-$17 in a few weeks
Well other day 1k add at $ 4.30 looks real nice once hit 16th !!!
Watch this going up until 4:00 p.m.
If it goes 6 beyond next week no coming back to 5's.
When Bids get pulled all it takes is a fraction of the number of shares to bring this down as it did to take up... no shares left to short... they didn't hit SSR.
Poor little Bechody With nothing much to sayWatching all his profitsAll but vanish through the day
Never miss out
It will come back to life eventually. Just wait
"Who sold and bought 462,153 shares in less than 1 minute before the closing at 4:00 PM? It is curious and very interesting to know. Any idea???"
15 M plus shares short on a float of $ 7.8 M with 86 % with institutional funds. Do the math and give it a few days
7.00 today?
It will close above 7 after hours
All of a sudden massive volume will come in !
GRAY moves crazy after hours.We have such a small float it takes light pressure to ramp UP !!
You guys are correct. GRAY has not reached a year. Wait until it happens
DO NOT LET THE SHORT SELLERS TELL YOU WHAT TO DO WITH YOUR SHARES !!!!!! They make $$ when they scare you into selling !!DONT BELIEVE THEIR BS !!!!!!!!!!!!!
to the moon
"I bet $5,670 this closes green today!"

GRAY very oversold excellent add or new buy while it's at discounted price area. Any news updates will bring it back to true valuation.
GRAY looking great again on no news.Maybe inside leak?
"""As of June 30, 2021, the company’s cash and cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments totaled $78.2 million.""GRAY's current market cap: $83M.The powers that be are going to play this stock until the company has something to say, but one thing I'm not worried about is GRAY running out of money. Which is often a big concern on these small biotechs."
nice gap fill there. MM's. Wasn't a short selling into it.
10 tomorrow!!!
"I think this is a very nice time to buy to be honest, the results weren't negative enough to explain %50 drop"
Is someone controlling this board selectively? Too bad.
It WILL only get worse. Sell and move on.
"hope i got in at right time @7.50 .. we will see. if not than still.its OK , but its way oversold!"
DO NOT HOLD

GRAY with some pre-market Bid-slappin UP...Over $4 already...It's about TIME to return to previous $15 lows as was...
"""cd"" are you still buying ???? I don't feel sorry for you."
I would appreciate it if someone would step in and rocket GRAY back into the mid-$20s.Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Wait until its 1st year. It will go up for sure
"6/23/2021 TA update on GRAY:Today GRAY closed at 5.10. This is about the 4th or 5th time GRAY has zoomed past 5.00 on extremely low volume from 4.90s. This is also the 9th day after the first squeeze to 8.00. And today closed with the lowest volume out of all the days since (close to yesterday). Price is also nearing the end of the wedge created from the squeeze, and that is about to close in one or two days. One last small detail I noticed is that after it popped up to 5.15 on the first rise today, it barely fell back as volume increased. However low the volume was in total, it did still increase after the jump (as usual), but price has remained steady.With all this taken into consideration, it's leading me to believe that we may not see sub 5.00 ever again. We'll have to see what happens in the coming weeks. But as per my previous comment, the current data thus far tells the story that shorts are out of money, capitulators are almost done capitulating, and bull whales are getting ready to buy.But I could be completely wrong and we hit sub 5.00 afterhours haha. So we'll have to see what the next few days brings us. Good luck Graybugs!"
This will make a huge move like SAVA this year
"4’s era is coming to an end. Do not wait to sell in 3’s. It’s your money, your call"

Bechody party is over $5 calls will win this Friday and I do not trade options
Thoughts folks?
Lots of buying here! Looking good!
As i said before we will see $10 soon mark my words
2 million + in ftd shares from May until today. All likely converted into put options January 2022 expiry. Funds can play the games all they want. The numbers are there. There's a price spike in GRAY's future

GRAY take down on 20% of daily average volume...Only UP from here.
"This is getting ah and pm play, about to pop?"
Don’t miss out
GRAY only 28k traded today.Somethings UP
Just be patient everybody!!!!!!!! It’s coming
"Since the initial afterhours squeeze to 8.00 on June 11, 7mm shorts were opened that day to profit on the way back down. However, the price probably didn't go as low as shorters expected. We can infer this because more shorts are being taken out each day, with short volume being higher than each average daily volume pre-7.00 drop. However, the short volume (and also total volume) has been steadily declining, and the price has been consolidating around 5.00. What this probably means is that shorts are starting to run out of money, and are deep underwater right now. Whatever whales have been buying, once they decide that they have accumulated enough, or if shorts have completely run out of money, the price will start bubbling up and we'll see a parabolic rise way higher than 8.00. Any future dip below 4.50, or even below 4.00 (unlikely) probably won't last more than a couple days tops. Strategy here is probably to either hold, or buy (DCA). Sideways movement or upward movement on any volume is good for GRAY holders right now, so don't let current stagnant price trick you into selling. This is not financial advice, but on the TA side things are looking good."
Hahahahaha that was awesome!!!!
"Before you listen to people who say this is a 2$ stock and sell.. Based on 4 ranked analysts offering 12 month price targets for GRAY in the last 3 months, the average price target is $14.00, with a high estimate of $23.00 and a low estimate of $8.00. Morning star rates the fair value of this stock at 7.84. This is a hold, if it does dip under $4... BUY BUY BUY I am all bull and holding atleast 3 months. TRUTH!"
croses 2 M with in first 1/2 hour. Real run begins after 11.30
I still think we will see 8.00 plus by mid month
we will see big moves
$12 just hold
Sold short
that move from $5.70 to $6.20 was on relatively little volume.. this thing could get interesting quickly.
This will be 20 + by the end of July
Well i got stopped out on that move. Very aggressive. All micro across the board are getting destroyed. Bios continue to be in the dog house. Oh well... stock is back trading at basically cash levels. Lol
Just added another 1000 go GRAY !!!!!!!!! Altissimo approval !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
