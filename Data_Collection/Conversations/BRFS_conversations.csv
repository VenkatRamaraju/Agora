"Moody's Ba2 rating of BRFS on July 3, 2020: BRF S.A.'s (BRF) Ba2 ratings reflect its strong business profile and leadership in both processed foods in Brazil and global poultry exports. After a strong deterioration in its operational and financial performance over 2016-18, the company is in a clear path of recovery in operational performance, which we expect to continue through 2020, reflecting initiatives taken by the company to turnaround its operations, increase volumes and improve profitability in its main markets, which resulted in improved operational and financial performance. Offsetting these positive attributes are the low geographic diversity in terms of production footprint and heavy concentration in one protein (poultry), and strong exposure to grain prices and currency volatility. Main risks to performance in 2020 include possible forced reduction in production due to the coronavirus outbreak in Brazil and weaker domestic consumption in the country as a consequence of recession, higher unemployment levels and lower disposable income, but we expect international markets will continue to benefit from the effect of the African Swine Fever (ASF) on animal protein demand and prices. BRF has an adequate liquidity profile, with about BRL8.3 billion in cash and equivalents and BRL 1.5 billion available under committed credit facilities at the end of 1Q20, which covers all debt obligations through at least mid-2023."

"This company makes the world's best chicken thighs in yogurt+rosemary+pepper etc. ready to be cooked over hot charcoal, but almost as good results can be be obtained frying it on a pan. My American buddies can't have enough enough of them. The only issue is that of distribution of this highest quality product as our BRF associates don't seem too eager to spread the word (and collect the extra bucks). The other awesome product used to be their Sadia sausage which was surprisingly replaced by the Perdigao one upon the merger of those companies years ago. There's nothing that compares in this whole USA. They oughta bring these goods directly to US consumers. BRF often has the best recipes but they lack follow through."
"Q1 released yesterday - Revenue up 21% Y/Y, EBITA up 67% Y/Y, cash generation of BR 1.5 Billion, and cash on hand of BR 9 Billion. Why isn’t this at $10.00?"
Brfs has an issue of not holding its price high enough for long periods and management don’t give update of what’s going on creating anxiety in stock holders ?????

"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — The federal government has decided to once again allow raw beef products to be imported into the United States from Brazil, a move that has angered some cattlemen and food safety groups who are voicing concerns about the quality of the meat.A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service said Friday the agency recently conducted on-site audits of Brazil’s raw beef production facilities to verify improvement in practices since 2017, when the USDA suspended importation of Brazilian beef over safety concerns.“FSIS confirmed that Brazil has implemented necessary corrective actions and has determined that Brazil’s food safety inspection system governing raw intact beef is equivalent to that of the U.S.” the agency spokeswoman said.She said the suspension ended Friday. Raw beef from Brazil will be “subject to re-inspection” at U.S. ports of entry, she said.A spokesman for the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said the group has concerns about quality given Brazil’s history of foot-and-mouth disease and its record of repeated food safety violations at ports-of-entry.“You can rest assured that NCBA will keep an eagle eye focus on all developments with Brazil and we expect nothing less than the highest level of scrutiny from USDA and customs officials,” said Kent Bacus, the group’s senior director of international trade and market access, in a statement.Environmental and food safety group Food & Water Watch Action said it’s not convinced product quality issues have been resolved.“It took two U.S. taxpayer-funded audits this past year for Brazil to have allegedly gotten its act together. We are not convinced,"" said Tony Corbo, a spokesman for the group.He said consumers will be taking a gamble every time they eat beef in the United States because there will be no country-of-origin labeling requirements on Brazilian beef."

Huge demand in China for BRFS product and at very favourable pricing. Q1 results were impressive and company says Covid 19 presents opportunity. See you at $10 by July.
"I wonder if the Bolsonaro really will be as long and big as the Trump rally? The meat industry is 20-25% of Brazil's GDP and was nearly half of exports in 2016. Bolsonaro will hopefully work with the meat industry to restore the business, instead of take the self-destructive path the last government did to reform the industry by destroying global confidence in Brazilian meat."

"Is there really confusion about what long term medium term and short term investing is all about? Long term isnt a few weeks long term is 3 4 5 years or longer I have owned CSCO stock for 20 years. Thats right 20 years. I have owned other stocks for 15 years or longer, i.e. TQNT became QRVO so thats how you own a stock for $24 that is now a $180 stock traditionally. Medium term is a form of long term you get a reasonable return and get the feeling that for a while at least the stock has shown all the gains its going to and you take your money off the table and run. Thats why I sold MKSI for $21 now also an $180 stock. Am I making my point. There are certain companies that their future is also the future of the industry also the future of the economy so you ride the macro and base it on really good micro fundamentals and there is no reason to sell. People have money because they dont spend it, the major reason why people have money the most fundamental reason why people have money is because they dont spend it. In fact the definition of saving is....... not spending. If you are investing for the long term you need to be using money that I always called dead money. This is defined as money that is set aside for investing not money for a cruise to Mexico on a dirty boat with disgusting poorly behaved people. This is money you retire on and more likely money you will DIE owning. There is nothing wrong with short term investing I have an account I will buy and sell a stock that operates in a 'known' range you can make consistent money doing this day trading or even holding a little longer I dont like stop loss selling so I try and do it with a stock I dont mind owning longer term if I get caught out. I bought BRFS at $3 in March or April of last year and Im in for the long term I dont need the money so its in there and the horse is running and the horse may very well keep running for 15 years or longer. But you know Brazil is a boom or bust economy when things get really good the Brazilians will find a way of screwing it up electing a socialist president and will bring their economy down again. SO in 3 or 4 years when Im looking at BRFS at $20 a share I might just sell it even though paying capital gains is about as appealing to me as cutting off one of my testicles with a rusty knife. This is what is called the old school approach to investing or as we like to call it common sense."
What is happening? Has Russia decided to buy BRF pork again?

The EU won't buy their chicken. The Russians won't buy their chicken. This company has a lot of work to do.
"China and the rapidly spreading swine fever epidemic is going to be a huge boost for BRF, right when it needs it, coming off the restructuring. The shares are not taking into account how much this will help the company get back on its feet."
BRF is up 5.50% to 4.60
BRFS is up 7.62% to 5.93
"This has been about as bad as it one could imagine for BRFS - meat ban, trucking strike, giant move down in the currency. But any lifting of meat bans, strengthening currency, de-leveraging or restructuring can be a big positive catalyst. In the very big picture, Brazil's chicken, pork and meat are important to the world. It's geographic separation from Europe/US/Asia means that it is isolated from the diseases of those other meat-producing countries. Russia, for example, is having a big problem with a swine disease outbreak now, and China has an African swine fever outbreak and avian flu."
BRFS reached a new 52 Week Low at 5.62
"So after the stock has lost so much in just a few days/weeks, the company ought to come out with a special call or something. Why delay the special meeting until April? They need to take care of this now!"
"Citi's downgrade because the shares are +55% does not make sense, unless he also thinks JBSAY's rally (3x) is also unsustainable. BRF is going to benefit from China's pig disease problem AND it is also only in the early innings of bouncing back from a low point operationally from the past 2 years."

I will buy a few shares around $5 later this week. It’s difficult to imagine a major corporation cheating on food safety.
"I can see this company picking up business from China and Middle East. If the dispute between Australia and China continues, BRFS stands to increase exports to China. I am betting on that and adding."
