"China and the rapidly spreading swine fever epidemic is going to be a huge boost for BRF, right when it needs it, coming off the restructuring. The shares are not taking into account how much this will help the company get back on its feet."
Best news for BRFS shareholders. The merger talks have been terminated. BRFS to profitability soon!

"Moody's Ba2 rating of BRFS on July 3, 2020: BRF S.A.'s (BRF) Ba2 ratings reflect its strong business profile and leadership in both processed foods in Brazil and global poultry exports. After a strong deterioration in its operational and financial performance over 2016-18, the company is in a clear path of recovery in operational performance, which we expect to continue through 2020, reflecting initiatives taken by the company to turnaround its operations, increase volumes and improve profitability in its main markets, which resulted in improved operational and financial performance. Offsetting these positive attributes are the low geographic diversity in terms of production footprint and heavy concentration in one protein (poultry), and strong exposure to grain prices and currency volatility. Main risks to performance in 2020 include possible forced reduction in production due to the coronavirus outbreak in Brazil and weaker domestic consumption in the country as a consequence of recession, higher unemployment levels and lower disposable income, but we expect international markets will continue to benefit from the effect of the African Swine Fever (ASF) on animal protein demand and prices. BRF has an adequate liquidity profile, with about BRL8.3 billion in cash and equivalents and BRL 1.5 billion available under committed credit facilities at the end of 1Q20, which covers all debt obligations through at least mid-2023."
Few months ago we hit 5.88 it’s good run but still more to come dont sell but buy
Huge demand in China for BRFS product and at very favourable pricing. Q1 results were impressive and company says Covid 19 presents opportunity. See you at $10 by July.
this will be double digits by end 2021
"This has been about as bad as it one could imagine for BRFS - meat ban, trucking strike, giant move down in the currency. But any lifting of meat bans, strengthening currency, de-leveraging or restructuring can be a big positive catalyst. In the very big picture, Brazil's chicken, pork and meat are important to the world. It's geographic separation from Europe/US/Asia means that it is isolated from the diseases of those other meat-producing countries. Russia, for example, is having a big problem with a swine disease outbreak now, and China has an African swine fever outbreak and avian flu."
"Q1 released yesterday - Revenue up 21% Y/Y, EBITA up 67% Y/Y, cash generation of BR 1.5 Billion, and cash on hand of BR 9 Billion. Why isn’t this at $10.00?"
Brfs has an issue of not holding its price high enough for long periods and management don’t give update of what’s going on creating anxiety in stock holders ?????
will close green around 7:90 today and tomorrow it's going to start uptrend
This stock was $7.3 when the pandemic started. Cases are dropping in Brazil. Economy is opening. This will return to its pre-pandemic state which is a 60% gain. This is only going up folks. Right now you are getting this at a massive discount. Get in and hold your position and watch your money gain 60% in 5 months.
"• From 2021 to 2023, it expects to record approximately 65 million Brazilian reais worth of revenue, and to double its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) as compared to the last 12 months. • From 2024 to 2026, both revenue and EBITDA will grow to a level ""2.5 times ... current levels."" • From 2027 to 2030, revenues will rise to R$100 million, and EBITDA will reach 3.5 times current levels, with EBITDA margins of 15% or better and net profit margins of ""approximately 6%."""
Great turnaround story. $10 by March 2022 is entirely feasible.
