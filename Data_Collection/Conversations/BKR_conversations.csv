BKR looks like it is about to drop. Be careful guys. I have been reading http://the-alphatrader.com/ and their stocks have been doing way better.
Seeing some good uptick in volume lately. Good earnings might run it to $30.2022 even stronger!
Just one cent of EPS? How disappointing.
"Many people are seeking for stability in this unstable crypto space and even the stock market, A lot of people are wondering if now is a good time to buy because of where the price is at right now. I'd say it's wrong to just sit back hold and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making profits should be the way of life that being said, the market is still majorly about BTC at the moment and I'll advise current investors and newbies to take advantage of the Mr. Arthur's copy Trading platform, a platform that handles people who lack understanding on how to maneuver the crypto space and stock market, to help them recover loss from the crash and also accumulate more positive returns, with this platform i went from having 1.4btc to 7btc in just 9 weeks. If you are interested in getting started, just send Arthur a message on What*sapp>>>>>>> +447901191306 or Tel**e**gram @ArthurFX47"

"Morningstar comments:""Third-quarter results would have been even better if not for supply chain issues and input costpressures affecting mainly the Oilfield Services segment and Digital segment. For the OFS segment,these issues were particularly strong in the chemical business, where Baker Hughes has much outsizedexposure compared with peers. These issues should greatly resolve in the fourth quarter, andmanagement is guiding for solid improvement in the segment's fourth-quarter results. Echoing peers' remarks, Baker Hughes expects continued profitability improvement in its oilfield servicesbusiness, driven by greater efficiency and higher pricing. Management is guiding for 500 basis points ofEBITDA margin improvement ""in the medium term,"" which will allow margins to soar past prepandemiclevels""."

"Blackstone Inc. co-founder Stephen Schwarzman said the world is facing energy shortages so severe they could cause social unrest.His comments were echoed by Larry Fink, who said there’s a high probability of oil soon reaching $100 a barrel, especially with many governments and investors pushing back against investments in fossil fuels.“Inflation, we are in a new regime,” said Fink, chairman of BlackRock Inc, the world’s biggest asset manager.“There are many structural reasons for that. Short term policy related to environmentalism, in terms of restricting supply of hydrocarbons, has created energy inflation and we are going to be living with that for some time.”Several analysts have said that European countries could halt gas exports to neighbors if winter’s colder than normal and prices keep rising.$SU $CNQ $ENB $COP $BP $OXY $VET $XOM $TOT $CVX $MPC $EOG $CLR $EPD $E $KMI $PSX $HAL $PTR $SNP $WMB $BKR $EC $IMO $CQP $MMP $TRP $XOG"

CFRA Cuts View On Shares Of Baker Hughes To Hold From Buy
"BAKER HUGHES (BRK) : Received multiple upgrades 10-21-2021 with prices target increased upward. See below:@BRK: "" Wells Fargo Maintains Equal-Weight on Baker Hughes, Raises Price Target to $267:25 am ET October 21, 2021 (Benzinga) ""@BRK: "" Baker Hughes Is Maintained at Equal-Weight by Wells Fargo raises to $267:35 am ET October 21, 2021 (Dow Jones)""@BRK: "" Barclays Maintains Overweight on Baker Hughes, Raises Price Target to $309:28 am ET October 21, 2021 (Benzinga)"".Great upgrades with prices change upward today. I am a buyer of Baker Hughes in sympathy with the whole financial market sell off. Oil inventory released yesterday's afternoon was unexpected below the projected level and that caused oil prices spiked yesterday late afternoon to 7 years high.It is likely oil will hit at least $90 near term. Oil prices dropped today due to profit taking and the markets sell-off."

A 'Miss' - but main thing is still the 'outlook' which should continue to be BULLISH!
"Container ships backed up for weeks at the port, all these companies get a great deal of equipment/components from overseas. shipping cost 4 times what it was. There has to be some impact, on these companies. Just another buying opportunity."
Not even for $20!
