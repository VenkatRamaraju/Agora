bhge stock probably broken but company not broken. most others are broken with the exception of HP. revenue is solid and do have earning.
"I think the news was BHGE was in the running for a big contract with India, not that the company was sold, or split from GE"
What do you guys expect the stock to do with the news of GE looking to shed its majority stake in BHGE?

How about we don't have as much oil as we think we do?

BHGE can make $500 a share in earnings in 2019 and wouldn't crack 30. They are tied to toxic GE and nobody is buying because of that. Pretty sad.

"$15B impairment! Ouch, end of the life cycle."
"GE has a great plan ... buy Baker Hughes at $37, then sell at $23. Wonder why JPM says GE is worth only $6/share now? This will hit BHGE share price some, but is now a good time to start taking a small position in BHGE?"
BKR up 1.00% on oil down 0.90% (on inventory build). Imagine if any good news comes out on oil. The world is a kettlepot at the moment too.
"S&P Global Ratings) Sept. 11, 2019-- Baker Hughes A GE Company(BHGE; A- / Stable / -) has announced it will repurchase $ 250 million of class Bcommon shares from parent General Electric Co. (GE; BBB + / Stable / A-2)concurrent with a secondary offering of BHGE class A common stock by GE. Thecompany intends to fund the $ 250 million share repurchase with cash on handand other available sources of liquidity.The share repurchases and secondary offering by GE are consistent with S&PGlobal Ratings' expectation that GE will monetize its interest in BHGE overtime. We note that GE will hold less than 50% interest in BHGE following thetransaction, which will result in a reduction of GE-designated board seatsfrom five to one.The ratings on BHGE are unaffected by these events."
"Heck to say this, but BKR and ""others"" can consolidate at this time without Democrat resistance. A Hal consoladition makes allot of sense right now,"
"GE please do us shareholders a huge favor. Sell this company before you destroy it. News article out today saying you might sell this off (or buy it all). Please sell it to HAL or SLB for $35 to 40 a share. DO NOT buy the rest of it unless you buy my shares north of $35.

Looking for that next bump in PPS.....surprised the stock didnt move all that much considering the price move in oil from $21.00 up to $29.00. That really means that if there is any breakdown in negotiations with Saudi/Russia the PPS can drop below $10....temporarily.

"Dear all, i normally don't post a lot, but for now it feels that I need to share my thoughts:This will get big squeezed (like $AMC $GME ) with fundamental underlying: remember the lighthouse strategy: Baker Hughes has made minimum, non-cancelable revenue commitments with C3.ai of $53.3 million in the fiscal year 2021, accelerating to $150.0 million in the fiscal year 2024. So far C3.ai has only recognized $21.6 million of this contract. Means $31.7 million have been added by end of march. Other examples for that strategy: Shell, Enel, ENGIE, Koch, the United States Air Force, Philips Medical. Additionally government contracting:DoD’s Innovation Arm Taps C3.ai for $95M Aircraft Maintenance Software Delivery Contract.Assuming for 2024 fiscal year (which is q2/2023-q1/2024) a sales volume of $600.0 million and P/S of 25 PT should be around $150. And this should be conservative, as $150.0 million are guaranteed alone by $BKR.Latest Market Date 2021-04-15 Short Volume 2,069,152 Market Volume 6,228,011 Short Volume Ratio 33% Again working very hard. It's every 3rd trade which is a shortsell. Borrow fee rates doubled to 3,x% last three days. Yesterday and today combined more than 5 million shares ... I expect now more than 30% of the float are shorted. One day they need to cover!!!"

"HAL, SLB and WLL all up 2 and 3% and BHGE is DOWN."
I thought the ship had already left without me. I am using this irrational selling to load up with a well run company with few competitors left. America ALWAYS needs oil and NG. Always.
"GE leaked news and BHGE reacted. They should halt the stock and put the full press release out. I can't imagine it went from 25's to 28 on ""we will sell BHGE in the future"". We knew that already. Someone knows it is sold and at a higher price. It's got to be in the 30's. HAL wanted to buy all of BHI for over 50B I think (not totally sure). So this might hit 40."
"Low oil prices destroys production, shuts in production, and cuts Capex for exploration tremendously. What this means is in the near future there will be a shortfall of oil, and prices will be sky high. I think 2022 should start to see this.... Big oil stocks will benefit by buying up assets for pennies on the dollar."

BHGE is also in trouble. Single digits is a foregone conclusion. I don't see a happy ending.
Bhge needs to be investigated too for accounting fraud as the current CEO was from the same pack of wolves at GE
Why so far down today
"Yahoo last listed 504.19 million shares outstanding, market cap of $26.77B, and stock price if $22.46. That data seems internally inconsistent. The numbers would balance if the shares outstanding excluded GE's 60% ownership, which would translate into a total 1.2B shares outstanding. Having just sold 100,000,000 shares, GE has reached their target 50.1% ownership. That means they will not be selling any more shares until next April. Is my math correct? If so, the current price should be a short-term low."
Take advantage of the “guilt by association “ with GE And buy on the dip.

Come on $40 if the big guy is listening upstairs I really need this
here comes news of our sale. it's going nuts
This stock isn't worth owning unless you can get it at $25 or lower.
"greg, you know GS upgraded BHGE from sell to hold the week before that Friday where the sell of started. Maybe we'll get some upgrades now to push higher. I mean, oil is going to rise between now and September. BHGE will earn almost 2 bucks next year. This thing is way undervalued."

How is market cap of this stock calculated? Shares outstanding 416 million x 36.64 not 41 billion.
Frustrating watching the price of oil just fluctuate between 40 and 43. 2 weeks ago looked like it was ready to push through 43 then the fed opened their mouths and killed the momentum!
"Only fools would sell. Hold for the long term. In the 1970's oil crashed. Peopled lost their ranches, homes, and committed suicide, because they had everything tied into oil. Had they tighten the belt and waited it out, they would have been happy. Oil came back with vengeance. Hold, do not panic and sell. You have a paper loss, not an actual loss. Use your brain for something other than a hat rack."
Inflationary wildfire will make Baker Hughes a triple by 2022. IMO.
"Positive sales will boost GE profitability . 120 billions of sales is no small feat. GE has a lot of valuable patents and assets. i assume 10% profit, that is 12 billions free cash each year."
Kinda hard to view this as a positive given Kulp comments yesterday regarding 'no liquidity concerns'. GE owns 65% of BHGE...this early out allows them to sell 165m shares at a price point that is 30% lower than when Kulp was hired. If no liquidity concerns why not wait? This will take their stake down to just over 50% so the rest will happen on originally anticipated timing...hopefully after oil recovers and BHGE share price goes up.
"With GE continuing to reduce its stake in BHGE, I expect the share price will be under pressure for quite some time. Selling an additional 40% of BHGE stock will certainly cause some price reductions as today's offering has done. I expect this could go down a couple of bucks long term unless oil prices dramatically rise."
"OMG, what is going on with this continuous downturn ?"
GE finally cut the rope. Lets see how they run on their own.
Waiting for $32 break even

It is extremely interesting to understanding the price movement in oil yesterday:$SU conversationShort data: March18 ,2021Today, Short sellers employed all of their tools in order to bring oil stocks and future contracts down.After failing to create a sell off in oil stocks ,they started to shorting April and May contacts for future oil.They brought WTI to 59$ from 64$.Biggest single drop since April2020.As you see in below data, compare to share price drop, the volume was extremely low.This volume does not match with share price drop.That was just a pure and irresponsible manipulation.Most media in the World censored this extraordinary event in capital market.We are talking about tens of Billions of $ contracts and options which they are trying to kill them, plus covering their short position with creating fake sell off(scaring shareholders).So far, we haven’t had sell off.Low volume.They prefer spent and burn few billion dollars and sell stocks at discount, but meanwhile save tens of billions of money in other side.Extreme and irresponsible manipulation which will have consequences in future of oil market ,especially in next OPEC+ meeting and their next policy.Explanation about below data:Vol: The total volume numbers of first hand shares which is coming into market for trading.It is different than total volume that you see in yahoo or elsewhere.Because in total volume one share can change many hands between traders.But original amount of coming shares and shorted shares are constant for day.For Canadian Stocks the volume is just for US market.SU : (Vol 2.326M shares), (Short 0.769M shares ), (33% of coming shares for trade)SU :XOM (Vol 12M ), (Short 5.715M ), (48% )CLR (Vol 1.129M ), (Short 0.703M ), (63% )CVX (Vol 3.363M ), (Short 1.784M ), (53% )OXY (Vol 8.277M ), (Short 5.32M ), (64% )CPG (Vol 0.693M ), (Short 0.314M ), (45% )CNQ (Vol 0.664M ), (Short 0.217M ), (33% )ENB (Vol 0.885M ), (Short 0.57M ), (64% )BP (Vol 3.458M ), (Short 1.265M ), (37% )CVE (Vol 1.543M ), (Short 0.978M ), (64% )CDEV (Vol 7.627M ), (Short 4.025M ), (53% )FANG (Vol 1.087M ), (Short 0.505M ), (47% )CPE (Vol 1.615M ), (Short 0.697M ), (43% )MRO (Vol 10.09M ), (Short 5.662M ), (56% )SLB (Vol 4.484M ), (Short 1.632M ), (36% )HAL (Vol 2.948M ), (Short 0.971M ), (33% )RIG (Vol 12.58M ), (Short 7.285M ), (58% )TOT (Vol 0.553M ), (Short 0.378M ), (68% )PXD (Vol 0.859M ), (Short 0.51M ), (60% )COP (Vol 2.865M ), (Short 0.808M ), (28% )BKR (Vol 1.79M ), (Short 0.659M ), (37% )LPI (Vol 0.417M ), (Short 0.181M ), (44% )PDS (Vol 0.054M ), (Short 0.02M ), (38% )#XOM, #CLR , #CVX , #OXY , #CPG , #CNQ , #ENB , #BP , #CVE , #CDEV , #FANG , #CPE, #MRO , #SLB, #HAL, #RIG , #TOT, #PXD , #COP, #BKR , #LPI , #PDS"
"GE CEO: To Exit Baker Hughes 'In an Orderly Fashion Over Several Years'GE is even screwing this up. Just put it out for bid. The only reason to hold it and get in an Orderly fashion is you think you get more because of improving conditions, in which case why get rid of it."
"BHGE is SEVERELY, EXTREMELY UNDERVALUED. Compare to any Oil company. GROWING, and CLEAN STRONG Balancesheet. 3%+ DIVIDEND, Lots of Cash"
"1 1/2 times shares bought at the last minute on Friday, just what I expected....."
"They actually briefly plugged $OIH on Bloomberg today , along with $HAL and $BKR , discussed how all the so called “green” energy push is ultimately just going to cause fewer high dollar “deep water” projects and more land/fracking wells that are ultimately higher turnover and more costly; does anyone on here watch Bloomberg??? Or is it just loser CNBC “Fast Money” Tom Lee chartists/speculators and Jim Cramer lemmings???  does anyone on here follow the small cap oil services names??? I’m not gonna tell you about any of the good ones , all y’all would jinx me "
no sale. GE is keeping BHGE. I'm shocked it's up. The other poster was right. WHY??? I need over 35 but this isn't news???
been a long time since this stock was worth buying
"rig count up 5 ,good for ofs stocks"
why does it keep going down?
"$32.80 today, up 23% in 3 months. Who is calling this a dog?"
"UBS maintains 'Buy'- $28 target:""The new estimates are leading to higher price targets across its coverage. It's maintained its Buy rating on Baker Hughes (NYSE:BKR), and raised those estimates on ongoing strength in Oilfield Services as well as Turbomachinery & Process Solutions, and consistent contribution from Digital Solutions. The new estimates lead to a $28 price target, implying 15% upside""."
I had a nightmare that I didn't sell BHI at 71just after HAL bid ...wait no nightmare. Ugh.
Does anyone know what is going on with BKR? OIH or small drilling companies did much better with 45% return whereas BKR has just returned just less than 10% when OIL shot up to 45%

Looks like GE is set on disrupting normal trading days for the next 3 years . This will definitely have a negative effect on the stock price going forward
"Why is BKR so cheap to SLB?? BKR's debt to equity is way better than SLB's, plus BKR much better price to book and a better PEG ratio than SLB? Is BKR the hidden gem? Would love some opinions please help."

"#1..What is BKR real outstanding Shares, float, and Mkt Cap, Conflicting numbers?? #2...Yahoo says 775m, $15 Bn Market Cap, Marketwatch says 656m, $21 Bn Mkt Cap (Marketwatch doesn't add up big time). #3...Either way, BKR is share count going up around 100m each year 2019, 2020, 2021. Is that due to GE Selling their ownership getting out, reducing below 50% ownership ???#4...GE oil Gas. BKR merged completed March 2017 (shares outstanding 424m 2016, so 427m 2017... Why share count did not go up in Dec'2017, 2018, remained nearly the same..??#5...Why now, 2019, 2020, 2021, each year around 100m increase in outstanding shares and same float..???Please, serious reply from informed people.."
BKR is down 5.34% to 19.50

"This started out on 10/31/2016 as a market cap 32 billion dollar company. Today, a few years later, the market cap is just under 13 billion. GE can never get back to close what they over paid for BH. 20 nbillion dollars, gone! Poof!"
Bought 1k in shares sold the 20 call for 4/16
$BKR $SLB Any clue on who's leading in terms of digital service and technology? Any industry professionals able to comment on this? Thanks in advance! SLB's Delphi seems to be an industry standard.
The price of oil goes up and BHGE goes down. I would hate to see oil go to $100 a barrel. Drilling activity would slow down even more. At $150 a barrel all drilling will stop.....at least the market thinks so LOL
BHGE reached a new 52 Week Low at 27.17
Upgrade:Baker Hughes (BKR) upgraded by BMO Capital from Market Perform to Outperform
BHGE reached a new 52 Week Low at $22.30
can someone explain to me now GE is not the majority shareholder but still controls 40% of BHGE.
This stock is going to tank because I just bought in
What is causing this 6% jump in stock?
"Hitting resistance levels based on May and June resistance hits and showed downward trend thereafter. Showing overbought with RSI at 81. A couple of interesting cross overs on the MACD indicators. Dec. 24th candlestick showed though bullish, tall wick showing downward pressure by sellers. Followed by 2 red candles sticks. Just slight bullish action today, almost doji like candle. Probably time to short it or go bearish option as it probably turns down tomorrow and takes a few weeks to settle back at 20.50. Could buy a Put at -78 delta at strike 27, ITM option, which is great if it does sink to 20 or 21."
