News can't get any worse than this so if you have the patience investing now for appreciation down the road and a substantial dividend soon might be wise.
"Watch for Industry update news at REX earnings results. Always good to keep abreast of fundamentals, look ahead. o Carbon Capture thoughts here are very matureo cost control goodo Volume and Inventory statuso excellent blance sheet Tempered knowledge of policies, rins, prices$GPRE$ADM$Alto,$ANDE"
Loaded up this week. ADM takes lower order goods and turns them into higher order goods. Deep value.
I must say that ADM'S PR team is on point. They're always delivering food news at the right time. This will easily be in the $75-$80 range in the next couple of months.
We're gonna go past $60 fairly quick as many option contracts will be in the money and market makers have to buy the stock to stay delta neutral. The next leg up is $65
It's a good day to own ADM!
ADM executives are buying shares like crazy. It's gonna pop.
the pet food deal is a game changer. ADM will be controlling the food supply chain from all angles

"I am a happy ADM investor right now. I can sleep at night owning this and it can help me pay my ever increasing grocery bills as an offset to inflation. Just like being an oil investor, you are happy to see gasoline at $3.00 instead of $2.00 even when its in your own tank. I do wonder how high this can run, given just how long it took to hold 50!! In other words, is everyone thinking we will hit 60, or are there those who think we could actually have a BG here?? I would love to hear thoughts on INGR as well. Good luck!"

"I'm a long time holder. Bought more today, but not all that I intend to b/c this blood bath isn't over and I'll see if I can pick up more lower. Can't go wrong with ADM."
"Appreciate the dividend, however treading water for years. As a former employee, I still hold shares. Reinvesting divvy over 15 years has almost trebled my stake. Good Luck longs. People need to eat and ADM will be there to buy, move and process food components."
"Two notes from EIA and ethanol world : 1. ADM is re-opening two plants. 2. West Coast ( mostly California) refinery demand , per EIA 0407 report, is at 150K barrels per day(bpd). While this up from 120K during Covid, this is +10k bpd above 2019 run rate. So demand for Ethanol is back to normal.Challenge is that West Inventory is down 1.7Million gallons, 200Kmgallons down from last week,and from normal 2.1-2.4M stockage level. AT run rate of 150K barrels per day. this means that from a supply line level, West coast has less than 11.2 days of supply.As a whole, Ethanol industry Optimum Goal is to run at a reserve level of 19 days of supply.This is to accomodate end-to-end issue of production, transporation, stockage, local distribution, peak demand days ...West coast usually has 14-15 days of supply with normal local production of 15-16K bpd or 660k - 700K gallons per day. SO ethanol stock depleting at a rate of 200K per day is worrisome! US Ethanol Production, with PEIX California plants down, is in the midwest.Going down river to ship by boat back to west coast is costly.Rack price in California is $2.30 per gallon now. I see $2.40-2.50/gallon coming.AT least one Alto Plant re-opening is ahead. Or should ATMX buy them?$adm$GPRE$Alto"
"Any thoughts on headwinds faced by ADM’s carbohydrate solutions high fructose corn syrup and ethanol? The syrup from facing backlash from nutritionists and public perception of its adverse health affects. Ethanol from decreasing demand - China and potential reduction of demand as a gasoline additive, coupled with oversupply."
"No one Cares. Sad. They would rather own ETH, Bitcoin or TSLA. A great company and a great quarter."
Food is second only to water. Ya can't eat a Google.
"As a former employee I've owned this since '97. The reinvested dividends have really added up. However the capital appreciation not so much. This is a stock position that I never worried about selling. I guess a core holding should do that. However, would I start a position now...ADM is fully valued.Low 40s seem a safer entry point...gle"
People gotta eat. Great long term option in the consumer staple sector. I'm in.
"Don't know a whole lot about ADM except they have a good reputation and appear diversified with essential products for humanity. Low Debt/Equity, Pay Me to Own it, An essential item. Any other ideas out there? Dipped my toe in the water today with CVX,PSX,INTC,CSCO,ADM,MDT, VZ, TAP for my dividend buys. Went into international for the first time as well,and gold yesterday. Plan on averaging in."
"Zack grades ADM as a ""Strong Sell"". In their top 5 as strong sells. Wonder why?"
One of the cheap pearls. short and long - good investment. especially china needs to feed 1.4B people.
"I would like to jump in, but some recovery must hinge on renewed demand from China. Anyone know how that stands?"

"NEWS ""Among the major funding details released Tuesday, $700 million will go to biofuel producers. The ethanol industry clamored for aid last year as demand for liquid fuel crashed during government shutdowns. Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, said the group is pleased with Tuesday's announcement and that the relief will come over the next two months.""reported in Farmers DTN news feedMY GUESS... Industry ran at 50% capacity ie 7B in a 14B gallon market.Fair distribution is 10c per gallon not produced.If so Alto had a capacity of 600M gallons...( so half would yield $30M seems a fair share... my guess)Alto ended Idling 180mil gallons in 2021.GPRE was at 1.2B gallons capacity( I think). So $60M GUESS!VLO had 2.7-2.8Bil capacity. So $135M GUESS.ADM. REX, AMTX...2020 was a hard year...

"GERS Receives Contingency Offer To Restart Litigation Against Ethanol Industry...This includes ADM's unlicensed use of GERS' oil extraction technology.CleanTech subsequently received an opinion of counsel that its remaining seven of twelve corn oil extraction patents are clearly valid and enforceable, along with a contingency-based offer to restart the infringement litigation from scratch. We are evaluating our rights and remedies in connection with all applicable matters, and we are unable to characterize or evaluate the probability of any outcome at this time Quote:Further, in connection with ongoing patent filings, the USPTO allowed CleanTech’s new corn oil extraction patents after considering the very information that the District Court found to have been withheld, and upon which the bulk of the District Court’s rulings were based. All of the information alleged to have been “knowingly withheld” from the USPTO in connection with the patents in suit was provided to and considered by the USPTO prior to issuance of several additional patents that are not covered by the District Court’s prior rulings (the “New Patents”). The USPTO subsequently disagreed that deception of any kind occurred when, on February 21, 2020, it issued another patent to us after reviewing the very evidence that was allegedly “withheld,” along with everything the defendants ever submitted and claimed, as well as the District Court’s 2014 and 2016 rulings – all in light of the facts that were never presented to a jury. Significantly, the new patent was allowed by the same examiner that the District Court said was deceived. In other words, the same patent examiner that was allegedly deceived looked at the purported evidence and claims of deception, and disagreed that she had ever been deceived. Thus, in issuing that patent, the examiner concluded that the inventive process was not “ready for patenting” in July 2003, that an invalidating “offer for sale” did not occur in July 2003, and that the “ready for patenting” and “offer for sale” information that the District Court determined to have been “deliberately withheld” from the USPTO was immaterial to patentability.Less"
Only posting because it’s so quiet. Waiting to fill my position on ADM. My average is $55.50 and I really don’t want to jump it up too much until the whole market shows it’s not going to tank. I don’t think globalist leaning administrations are big on creating independently wealthy citizens...
I think ADM is headed to 70 near term.
