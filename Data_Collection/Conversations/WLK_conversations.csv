All things considered the 1st quarter results showed an increase in sales and earnings. The markets are down because of the virus pandemic still and probably for months still. I would guess it will be sometime before the world economies stabilize. Here’s hoping we have a vaccine before next Winter or like with the second Spanish flu outbreak there could be hell to pay..

No one following this company? I have been holding a little over a year and have no answers to their drop in share price. They just bought a company to complement their product line. That probably explains the bump in share price.
The actual response from bio guard on when we would get some of our orders backed up from November and they couldn’t tell us it’s only gonna get worse in July

Tricolor buyout from Olin after the bell nothing big after hours but big position already for blow out numbers on tri cloro n ammo But tricolor is sold out retail store shelves just like toilet Paper and it didn’t even start to get hot yet we experience the first heat wave for four days more algae more chlorine as well as many pools still not open yet that are opening up across the country and will stay open late into September to get the most of this summer liquid sodium hypochlorite is the only thing available and it’s flying off the shelves and you have to put that in daily in about inground pools especially if you keep them heated
"With a soon to be announced China agreement, we will see new highs, IMO, accumulating with upbeat feedstocks and monomer sales!!!"

Some of my paid for information and WLK at 1:25 near its February financials reporting. That’s the state champ but in today’s market I’m holding until then
"From this mornings Rail Group News:""There are some positive railway equipment and logistics notes from 2020 chemical sector traffic. Plastic resins movement was a growth chemical segment overall in 2020 due to the role it plays in producing COVID-19 protective materials. Some chemical products that support automobile manufacturing are also recovering strongly. Plastics are a big input to automotive. From 2015 through 2019, automotive units averaged nearly 17 million per year. Sales during 2020 are expected to have come in at only 14.4 million units. The outlook for 2021 is perhaps 16 million units."""
