"USWS stock announced having ceased operations of its last active conventional fleet in late August of 2021. This development marked the company’s exit from the diesel frac services market. The company is currently operating five fleets that are entirely electrified, with the number expected to grow to 9 electric fleets by the end of 2022. There continues to be strong demand for electric fleets, as evidenced by recent commercial momentum. August 2021 also saw the company execute an agreement that extended an existing electric fracturing services contract through to the end of 2022"

"TDA now says there are 52.2 million shares outstanding.Prior to the split Yahoo said it was 95% institutional owned and 11% insider owned.TDA says 26.83% shorted, but I highly question that number because pre-split Yahoo said it was only 4% shorted."
Best time to buy is now after the split.
Buyout in near future.
"Get your tickets for the USWS Rocket Trip....take a look at the chart, it's getting ready for blast off on a trip to the moon....Fuel for the rocket trip is WTI @ $82.66 (West Texas Intermediate), electric fracking patents, all electric efleet company....Oil is only going higher and this stock is massively undervalued and getting ready to make some explosive moves to catch up to where it should be. USWS Price as of Oct 16, 2021 is $2.84...this stock will double or triple by February of 2022 and continue going up from there. Due your DD on this company...visit their website and look at their investor relations page as well as their 10-K. They are already licensing and have monetized their patented technology for electric fracking. I am long the stock.."
"Elon Musk became the richest man in the world thanks to enthusiasm for Tesla Inc.’s sleek electric cars -- and the company’s stratospheric stock price. But while Musk is perhaps the most well known clean energy CEO, SpaceX, his other company, is likely to rely on drilling for natural gas to power Starship, the new spacecraft and rocket designed to carry humans to the moon, Mars and beyond."
