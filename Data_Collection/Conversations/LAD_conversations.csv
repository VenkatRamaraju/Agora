There on the prowl again LAD and DCH looking to make another big North East purchase. if it plays out they will be the # 3 largest!! in the USA running by CARMAX. If they run this purchase like they did with DCH it should be a big move in the share holder value in the next year. Look at the upside move after buying all the DCH stores. Strong buy on any dip!!!!!!
I have a 10 year target of $1750.

Lithia Motors reached an all time high at 248.60
Wyoming is not the last stop for LITHIA not the last stop..... this purchase with the lithia team moving the units should exceed 78.2 million to there bottom line. I suspect a toyota store will open that area and the tundra model has nocked the domestics in the dirt lets not forget the tacoma sales in the area over the last 2 years.
oops footprint to large at this time the need to stop buying up so many stores in such a shorttime
One of the worst companies to work for. This stuck is a bubble. Mismanaged with fake numbers from there stores.
