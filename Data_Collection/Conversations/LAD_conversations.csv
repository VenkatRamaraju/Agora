"Great growth stock here. Crushed earnings, offers a nice dividend, and Zacks rates the stock as a strong buy. Has more room to grow."
LAD is the first of the auto peers to report. Up 8% pre-market. Looks like a great quarter for the auto industry.
Anyone know why the stock slid over $25 today to to settle at $342? What did we miss?
"A good company, I think the future will be good for it. But I have sold, I think there are better opportunities in the market, for example MED (-30% in the last months without any sense), DISCK (due to the merger with WB), FB (corrected valued in my opinion), GOOG (the strongest company on the heart reading the balance sheet and looking at its industry), and others. Good luck to all the bull"

I just bought this for my Safe and Sound portfolio . I bought it because on an over all basis it is a very strong company. Generating growth and free cash flow.
Footprint got to big try calling some of the east coast stores the phones ring 20 plus timesthen a voice says leave a message.They sold a nissian store & a Vw store plus the 10 year old DCH head quarters is on the block for sale.Closed a used car dept building to save on $ and combined it with new car deptMany hours waiting to get in the finance office to pay or finance there cars.Also Mr. debour has sold off most of his stock.The son brian may be moving to fast.Hence a 60 point drop.
oops footprint to large at this time the need to stop buying up so many stores in such a shorttime
I am not a believer in this concept- car buying during COVID and the new work from home trend is not painting a rosy picture for car sales.

3.5b market cap company reports blowout earnings on above estimate revenues. Great stock and no one is paying attention.This is the first legitimate investor post all year. You'll find dozens per day on every sketchy penny biotech. Bizarre.

Wow. LAD reports an amazing quarter. Blows away estimates for both earnings and revenue.
This should be right back to $365. There was absolutely No Reason for the Huge Price Drop yesterday ! 
"Lithia & Driveway (LAD) Increases Revenue 70%, EPS 47%, And Adjusted EPS 63%, Record Third Quarter Performance.Wow. This company is a monster LOL. Crazy."
