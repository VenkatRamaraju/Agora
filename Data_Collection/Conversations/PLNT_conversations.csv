For months people have been bashing PLNT on here over this and that...yeah the stock hasn’t jumped through the roof but they are holding up...opening stores and taking market share while competitors are not and or closing stores.
"How can we be at nov 19 levels with closed gyms and possibly not opening for months on end? If you want to avoid getting the virus, the last place you want to be is in the gym"
Planet Fitness Cut to Hold From Buy by Jefferies today! That's the reason for the weakness.
-cash <500 mil. -debt >1.5 billion- stockholder equity negative- thin margins- increasing costs- customer base will shrink dramaticallystonk people: looks good to me
EPS target is being lowered significantly by firms recently. Another today.
"Yeah CEO is buying shares, of course he thinks it is a good deal. However, when gyms open, who is going to want to go to a nasty gym and catch a virus? PLNT is going to be hurting big time."
"Planet Fitness EarningsRevenue for the chain rose 30.1% to $174.4 million. The results just beat Wall Street's forecast for $173.69 million. Wall Street expected Planet Fitness earnings per share to jump 33% to 32 cents. But the earnings came in higher, at 34 cents.Same-store sales rose 10.1%, marking the company's 48th straight quarter of positive same-stores sales gains.For the full year, Planet Fitness forecast a roughly 15% revenue gain. Analysts currently expect $637.15 million in revenue for 2019. That would mark an 11% gain from the $572.9 million Planet Fitness logged for all of last year.Planet Fitness also said it expected a 25% jump in adjusted earnings per share. Wall Street forecast EPS of $1.43 for 2019, which would be a 17% gain from the $1.22 per share Planet Fitness earned in 2018.The company said it expected same-store sales to increase ""in the high single digits.""

Planet Fitness stock traded tightly for much of this year.'Amazonian' Business Model?The attempted breakout by Planet Fitness stock on Friday came after a Jefferies analyst said the company had an ""Amazonian business model"" that protected it from competition.The analyst, Randal Konik, likened the company to a ""platform,"" along the lines of Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon, that could drive sales and consumer commitment.That platform, he said, consisted of digital services like an app that makes for smoother service. More ""premium memberships,"" advertising, and a broader array of gym equipment could help create more loyal customers. The company's Black Card perks program has room to grow. Franchising should keep expansion brisk and lighten the company's costs.And in some ways, Amazon (AMZN), which has forced physical retailers to clear out of stores over the years, has also helped companies like Planet Fitness grow.""From our group of experienced franchisees who are eager to expand their footprints to increasingly favorable real estate trends, our growing national and local advertising budgets and our initiatives aimed at enhancing the member experience, we believe there are tremendous opportunities to build on our recent accomplishments,"" Planet Fitness CEO Chris Rondeau said in a statement on Tuesday.'Robust' Fitness IndustryPlanet Fitness last year said it would ""work to build upon our current momentum as brick-and-mortar retail continues to be under pressure from online businesses."" Management added that ""landlords are increasingly looking to Planet Fitness to drive traffic in their centers.""Konik said that the fitness industry remains ""robust,"" as rival high-value, low-price gyms expand as well.But the discount fitness center market remains fairly scattered.

Is it true that the liabilities are more than the assets on PLNT? That can’t be good. Am I reading the balance sheet correctly? Thanks
"folks,we have had a runaway market for months now--only reason this is hugging 50-this will be one of the first sold when someone finally pulls the plug on this market. for no other reason its pe is over 40"
"Stocks are always forward looking. With that said, PLNT will be a $200 stock once everyone has been vaccinated and people want to be out in the gym (sometime in 2022). Working out at home is not very fun, unless you're wealthy and have a lot of money to blow at once on PTON and etc. PLNT fitness isn't competing with them. Their customers are the lower middle class that want to be at the gym and have access to all of those machines and fair price. NO other gym can compare to their pricing. SO, with that said, buy it while it's cheap. If you've never been to PLNT gym, then you don't know what you're talking about when you say the stock is a $25 stock. SMH"
We find 223 Planet Fitness locations in New York.
I'll get it at 50
Not to mention international expansion. Enjoy the growth in this company and of course exercise in their gyms if suits your workout needs!!
im pretty smart-I also realize the market is a rigged game controlled by computers---but for the life of me---this stock goes up 10% a day-------THEY ARE CLOSED WITH NO OPENING DATE!!!!! they might never reopen---short at will
Short
"You only need to look at HTZ to see how wack capital markets are these days. A high flying stock price does not a good company make. PLNT is in trouble, and the signs were starting to show BEFORE the pandemic. Almost a billion in debt with much of that coming due within the next two years, coupled with a relatively low free cash flow to service that debt. I have to believe capex must slow down to conserve cash, because mismanaged growth is probably what got the company into this mess in the first place. All this to say that this will no longer be a growth machine. The market will come to grips with this. Maybe not next week, maybe not the week after that. But the picture looks bleak, even if the company is able to pick up some market share from competitors. Mind you, I don't like betting against companies. Everyone should WANT free enterprise to succeed. But when things get this out of hand and irrational, lazy longs (who do no due diligence) only have themselves to blame. Trade this. Do not hold. It all shakes out in the end."
Can anyone tell me why in the world this stock is still at pre-covid levels? with no income is this all a scam?
"I just commented on this and now it was deleted. CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN HOW THIS STOCK HAS RALLIED ALONGSIDE S&P when they’ve been closed for 2-3 months? Also, does anyone else feel that their reported new sign up figures are complete BS? HOW IN THE WORLD ARE THEY REPORTING NEW MEMBER SIGNUPS ON PAR WITH LAST YEAR? CALL ME CRAZY BUT DOESNT SEEM REMOTELY POSSIBLE"
So it's up 150% from it's lows in March. It's a business that's not open and currently has no revenue. But Wall Street analysts want you to believe we are in rational markets. The only one to blame on this is the FED. Zero interests has forced the world into risks they shouldn't be taking. I just wish I could print money too then investing would be simple.
"Have a small postion and will only add to it if we get more dips, fitness wont disappear over virus, small gyms already struggling may close giving more customers to this best of breed company. You have to look long term here, stop letting the news impact common sense decisions gyms will come back and PF will be industry leader"
I’m titled by the completely blatant trading/manipulation by the institutional holders. If retail was holding this would be a $20 stock by now. Disgusted by the blatant manipulation to keep it over $50 until after the monthly options expire.
Still a great short at this price !
"you can kiss your customer base goodbye. went today to the gym first day open and 75% of equipment either removed , zip tied to prevent use and or flagged with a sign saying not in use for distancing. The 30 min work out room had a.max.capacity of two people, the streching-abb machines area same max two people. the weight section only two smith.machines working and only one lat station. people not driving.to the.gym.to weight around outside like a grocery store, they.will cancel memberships."
"Everyone keeps knocking the appearance of the Solo model and it baffles me. Granted, it is not the easiest thing on the eyes but the common consumer who will be buying these will do so simply because they do not see a need to have bulky, gas consuming, emission producing vehicles anymore just to drive to work. $SOLO is targeting a market that to my knowledge nobody has ever tested (there is $FUV which is a similar 3 wheel design but I think ends up more in the motorcycle category) and that people is how good long term companies are formed. I'm not in any means comparing this stock to Tesla but what did people say 10-12 years ago when Tesla broke onto the scene? I imagine they were saying the same thing people are saying about SOLO and that it is stupid, it will never take off, etc. and now look at Tesla leading the EV sector and setting the foundation for many of these startup companies. Different sector but look at Planet Fitness. They broke into the gym scene targeting the 80% of casual gym goers with cheap memberships and free pizza the first Monday of each month. Seemed stupid at the time why a gym would give away pizza when people are there to lose weight, but $PLNT became the fastest growing gym franchise in history all because they saw a market and went after it.The point is that SOLO sees a market, I for one think it is a very large market, for the single occupant vehicles for everyday commuting and 10 years from now I'll be happy to sit on my mountain of cash while the people who bashed it sit at their day jobs wishing they had gotten on the train before it left the station."
"corona is temporary - while ppl wont go to gym until virus goes away, but at the same time ppl arent cancelling their existing subscription to gym. so there is no revenue loss, although client growth is stunted for 2 months or more."
"Glad to see another positive quarterly report for PF. Nothing to see here except continued execution of their plan with unit expansion, growth in volume at existing locations, good expense management, margin reassurance, and improved guidance. Last month's dip appears to have been a pretty decent buying opportunity."
"Some people seem to forget that PLNT caters to a niche. If you’ve been in a PF before you know what I mean. Not everyone likes the way they run their clubs. As long as there are gyms, there will be competitors. Trust."
"Earnings miss, near zero revenue forecast for Q2, questionable Q3 revenue.... up 2%. Makes sense."
so is this jumping back up tomorrow since it beat earnings... or?
"It's about locations. Then price, then memberships, then more locations.PLNTs strategy will win.Pity your shorts."
Excited to be cutting prices based on collapsing sales? What BS!

"I don’t know why anyone would want to sell now, all stores are open generating cash, lots of cash. Much better to go to a large gym like PF than some small one right now where space may be a problem. In 2 months everyone that wants a vaccine shot will have one."
Looks like a miss for plnt.
"Wow, just wow. PLNT pricing in better than expected return to normalcy. They do realize that a pandemic has waves and we are 12-18 months away from a vaccine?"
why in the world is this stock holding and increasing through all the covid time and no income? it's seriously mind boggling. I've been a member for a could years and they stopped auto withdrawal for dues months ago. something's weird with this one. so bizarre !
I never know what to do with this stick. Bought it pre-COVID when it was close to its current price and it quickly set all-time highs. Obviously the pandemic didn’t help this one and it still hasn’t fully recovered.
No idea why this is up. There will be zero growth in customers. Lots of expanding will hurt. Glad to know this is not the bottom yet overall. To many investors trying to time bottom and fear in missing out
NOW YOU HAVE TO WEAR A MASK... AUG 1ST NOT GOOD
PLNT feeling the burn...up up up...
"should be many pulling guidance and downgrades to follow. Next qtr earnings will be far worse than today, so how does it hold above $40 ?"
Planet Fitness just shook off a revenue miss basically. It shows how strong this stock really is. I feel bad for not grabbing more when it took a quick dip into the 60's.
Planet fitness looks fit.. especially later when people feel confident enough to go to the gym. Right now millions of people are staying home packing on pounds
Hi everyone. Gym owner from more than 25 years. My gym is 11000 sf. I also own a equipment sale business. In the gym sales are down 40 % from last year same month. Im getting a 5 to 2 cancellation to new sign in ratio plus silver sneakers and other seniors subscribers are not visiting the gym. It is really bad for everyone in this business. People are not going to gyms now and are not going for a while. I starting signing members without a auto withdraw pogram and getting a lot of members from pf wich is 14 blocks away from me. I have never shorted a stock but I’m seriously thinking about shorting this one.Equipment sales company is down 100 % for gyms and up 100 % for home equipment . People are investing a lot on home equipment I can’t fulfill the demand for that area.
"This is the best performer on the boards for the last 3 months! Even down days, this stock is resilient and tenacious. Some would assume it is just a fitness gym franchise, but it is the Netflix of exercise! This company is easy $122 in the next few months. Wow, those glutes look hunky!"
Insiders are losing millions with repurchases of late.
"The rotation out of many high flyers this year continues, but the companies with real earnings growth will rebound as the tide goes out. PF may have gotten a bit ahead of itself at $80 with a lofty PE, but the growth story remains intact as they will continue to have positive comps and the location expansion continues in a favorable real estate environment. Could it bounce along at this level for awhile? Sure, but there is no smoking gun for this decline besides a rotation to safety from growth in a period of uncertainty. With record US employment levels, an extremely high value offering, and no China trade exposure, the only risk is management continuing to execute the same strategy that got them here. And unlike a lot of other dog recent IPOs that continue to reinvent themselves to shift the focus from their massive capital burns to fuel growth, PF is doing just fine with a strong business model that produces increasing free cash flow. Go get a workout in and chill."
"18 memberships cancelled today at our local pf, zero new people joining...."
@jthinkhouse how you doing today?
Here are the FACTS: - 10 Billion in free cashflow- Zero Debt- Analysts price target of $100+- Makes Jeff Bezos spill his milkStay Strong. Stay Long.
Short at 65 cover at 50. No one is going to gyms anytime soon even if they open today.
"Looks like some people can’t handle the truth about the planet. In time, you’ll see"
Liabilities greater than assets is pretty scary. There will be some if not a lot of franchises that will not be able to keep it’s commitments to Corp-scary. How do they plan to pay 2 billion dollars in debt when net income for the quarter is a small 10 million and no income potentially for foreseeable future-scary. Stock price to me seems like it should be about $30 per share
"you are nutz buying this stock. short it now, gyms will be the last safe thing to open. Beijing had a flare up at the gyms. it will happen here too."
planet fitness will win. business will be booming when markets go down
Planet Fitness reports bigger quarterly loss than expected..
can't believe I sold this stock at 28
My Planet fitness gives away free pizza in the actual gym once a month. Do others? I suppose that's one way to keep people having to come back for another workout.
"Space X, #rockettomusk, #carsinspace; Musk's other, other enterprise, Space X, has bolstered an impressive offer to purchase Planet Fitness for a whopping 11.8 Billion dollars in cash and stock, as reported late Thursday evening by Reuters World News. The deal, apparently already approved by the Boards of both companies, will take Planet Fitness private in May, 2019. The company will be called Planet X Fitness, in a clever mating of their company names. The combined company would be the worlds largest, and most valuable, Space and Fitness company on the planet. Cross platform synergies in marketing, equipment and training platforms should benefit each units overall top and bottom lines. Musk tweeted cryptic messages about the buyout of the fitness juggernaut, Thursday. ""Future Space X Mars missions will utilize PLNT fitness technologies to train the best Martian Asstraunats anywhere in our near Galaxy. #greatasstraunats "" Space X, Tesla and Planet Fitness and Paypal all declined to comment on specific details, but assured investors and club members the fitness space hasn't been this explosive, profitable and technologically important in decades. #interplanetaryfitness, #fitnessfromplanetx"
Who thinks a business model based on cheap gym equipment & low membership fees will be successful in a post-pandemic world? Everyone is learning how to workout from home and getting acquainted with interactive fitness tech. This franchise relies on volume and the will not get it.
"Earnings and guidence looked very good to me. Look forward, not backwards."
Why retained earnings are reported as negative for Planet fitness? Retained earnings should be sum of Net income minus any dividend paid out but company doesn't payout any so my question is why its negative.
"Just opened a position in PLNT. Read the article in Barron's. Looking forward to massive upside growth, as it's currently the only fitness player in town being publicly traded."
They won't be making any money on equipment now that purchases aren't required and they are giving a 15% discount.
"Total Debt 1.2 bl.Total Cash 220 mlAnd now intends to issue $500,000,000 of notes for working capital?What price this will end?"
overvalued is an understatement. negative net tangible assets. over a billion in debt and around half a billion in revenue... also even if they had 100 million people paying 10 per month gross revenue would be a billion... also that's the franchises' revenue.... planet fitness the public entity depends on opening new franchises to make significant parts of revenue. this stock is incredibly overvalued
Are people going to be required to work out with face masks? Will there be social distancing guidelines like only every other treadmill can be used? I just don’t see how a gym can reopen without their being a cure for covid19 and who knows when that’ll happen.
"Planet Fitness issued a financial forecast for 2019, including:Total revenue growth of approximately 15%.High-single-digit systemwide same-store sales growth.Adjusted net income growth of approximately 18%.Adjusted earnings-per-share growth of approximately 25%.The company's EPS growth will be positively impacted by stock buybacks. ""The board of directors is also extremely confident in our future evidenced by the decision to increase our buyback authorization to $500 million last August, which we acted on aggressively through [a] $300 million accelerated share repurchase program we entered into in November,"
Best short for sure
Planet fitness is the blockbuster of the gym industry.
I sold early and missed the boat....afraid of earnings after all the selling prior. Would like to get back in now....think I should wait for a pullback?
I might be one of the only people on this board saying they are going to do well long term and take market share. Ops are excellent and still expanding worldwide.
"I have a feeling PLNT will soon generate a Harvard case study on “How not to run a business”.Budget gym chain Planet Fitness says it was too late to call off plans to charge customers for March, and customers can cancel their memberships by visiting its locations—which are closedBased on many irate customers on Twitter, Planet Fitness may lose many of them before it can debit their bank accounts again.PLNT is soon to find how powerful a force social media truly is. Those investors who argue it’s only $10-20/ month are going to be surprised by the repercussions of PLNT’s PR blunder.Time to head back to the teens. Remember, this bloated pig never should have been trading at nose bleed valuations to begin with. Rondeau will soon discover what WS thinks the true value should be."
"Don’t sell your shares below 140 people! So many gyms are out of business and so many new subscribers will opt for planet fitness after they compare against LA fitness, crunch, blink, equinox, orange theory"
Manpower instead of trolling a middle tier stocks thread work on moving out of your mom's basement. The spam is getting old.
COVID 19 > Planet FitnessAnother shutdown of gyms will be brutal for this stock. Buyers beware.
How do they make money now when most gym are still closed? Maybe they’re going there virtually online ha ha...
"Planet only owns about 100 of the 2000 gyms, the other 1900 are franchised. Franchisee either lease from Planet or they lease the facility on their own. Planet also receives a 7% royalty as well as finances gym equipment for the franchisee. Folks thinking its just $10.00 a month and they wont cancel is a stretch. Most folks upgrade to the $25.00 pkg. So there will be some cancellations as well as little new memberships. Corporate Planet Fitness does have a lot of negatives coming at it."
Will plnt get access to stimulus loans? They aren’t necessarily “too big to fail” and they aren’t a US entity.. franchise structure means it’s fragmented and the organization is only as strong as its indie franchisees..Plnt future is highly dependent of the franchisees’ character capital and capacity
"I am a buyer here, why would anyone cancel it now then reopen later knowing they won't be charging during this time? if you are worried plnt cannot pay the rent, worry those malls stores first like macy's kohls, bbby and so on. when virus is gone, even if there is recession, watch ppl cancel high end gym memberships and join plnt."
"you simply can not have the amount of people in there that you usually saw, say at 5pm after work-it would be impossible from a social distancing scenario----so how is that going work? take a number? reserve a time to work out? wait in line? keep in mind--every single machine or weight has to be cleaned after each use---think about your last visit to the grocery store and how long it took to check out as everything is wiped down after each user-------its a problem going forward for this company"
Getting crushed. Just bad news all over the place with this company. Outbreak in Virginia due to PF gym exposure. Covid cases increasing all over the place. Getting sued in Georgia for charging people. Any thoughts? Dump it?
"I have informed Leticia James's office in NYC of the unsatisfactory treatment of membership charges and reimbursements, and non response from Area Managers. I hope they take up a Class Action against the PF NYC!"
"Planets are slowly but surely opening up....there is a great and well thought out plan to create a safe environment for our guests and team members (and its working). HUGE 100 + page booklet laying things out. + The speculation of huge cancellation numbers is completely untrue. Demand is there, people want to get out of the house and work out."
A good way to channel check is to look at each gyms business meter at their webpage. All that I have checked only have 2 or 3 bars out of 15.
"it's pretty sad that people buy bubble stocks thinking they're going to get rich and these are really just ways to get poor. biggest bubble in history. biggest economic depression in history. plus a covid outbreak that warrants a masks and lockdowns.. someone concludes a gym stock that now makes hardly anything is worth $5bn instead of $6 or 7bn pre-covid. yet many peers have went bankrupt showing that most gyms are worth 0. the darwin investment awards will soon move from nikola shareholders to planet fitness. the u.s. has been real quiet about covid second wave reports, while the rest of the world is ratcheting up the fear level. it's only a matter of time before the school wave, flu season shows that this stock should be trading below 20."
"No guidance is bad... Some people cancelling due to loss of health &fitness allowance from their employer, others lost jobs/income and others migrated to towns that don’t have planet fitness gyms"
"In 100 years, PE ratios on stocks have been this high 3 times. Right before the great depression, right before the great recession, and today."
"I am no Warren Buffett, but I can tell a thriving business when I see one and planet fitness is on fire! And the fundamentals confirm that."
It’s over for PLNT. They should launch a new gym after covid. With better equipment sauna pool etc
with the vast majority of locations being franchises seems many will not have the capital to reopen. Some may try but only last a month or so. Their business model is broken.
Looking to enter under 50- 48 fair entry
some one please explain the investment thesis here.
"Oh please, that real estate they own in all of those mini malls has got to be worth something. They'll bounce back from this. Just picked up more at $39.64"
Great news today...PLNT will eventually get back open and be back on track. Lots of room to expand especially if we see any other big boxes or competitors go under because of the downturn. I think NYSC considering bankruptcy will be a huge boon for PLNT in NY/NJ of BOSTON area if that were to happen as that’s where a lot of the corporate stores are located. Those members will need a reliable gym and most likely looking to reduce expenses simultaneously. PLNT has a lot of advantages coming out of this temporary crisis.
It just keeps on giving.
"Here are my thoughts. Gyms are opening as summer roles around ending the first wave which the market assumes that there will be no second wave in Fall/Winter.My school (UVA) announced they will open in person (small classes only) on Aug 20th but plan to end classes before Thanksgiving break. UVA says they think a second wave is most likely to hit. If a second wave hits, we will expect this to fall again as gyms will close again. In conclusion. I don’t know when if it will keep rising but I’m pretty confident it will fall back down once news on the second wave hits."
Nice Cup and Handle forming from 8/1. Golden Cross just happened. Very bullish. Look for a breakout above $82
"based on strictly financials this company is still extremely overvalued... also wait until the store openings slow... which they will. Revenue growth will quickly simmer, and then it will crash."
"How quickly is Planet's value eroding in real terms? I think we all sense it but let's hear what other real datapoints there might be. Someone on the board mentioned 18 subscription cancellations and no new subs at their gym. Does anyone else have intel to share?The CEO of Planet Fitness was on CNBC earlier this week and talked about how some of their customers were using their ""app"" to get the offsite training. How useful or robust is that compared to Peloton or others? Is it sticky?"
Looks like nice buying opportunity. Analyst said should be $100!
"I cant tell you what the short term SP will do, but the PF gyms I visit in Florida have never been busier. People have had enough of living in a cave to avoid a virus that kills 2% of those who get it. If I get Covid & die, it will be living my life to the fullest, not hiding in Tin Foil Bunker. PF is different. It is a safe place to work out for the elderly, #$%$ folk, & type B-Z personalities. It is possible to body build at PF, but body builders are uncomfortable at PF. They can go to every other gym to body build, pose, jockey for monopolizing the free weights, shout ""give me one more"", slamming everything & so forth. There's only one gym for the other people, its PF. I was a serious triathlete & bodybuilder when I was young, I get what it is all about. And you can do that to your heart's content, someplace besides PF. I'm old, & there are lots of old people at my home PF. We dont have to ""muscle in"" to get a chance to use the free weights. The gym doesnt sound like a roid rage cacophony, I like that. Lots of people like that. We have lives to live, not die. If the gyms are closed down again, it will be against the will of ""We the People"". I can see lots of poor people have lost their jobs, & that may cut in to EPS for a year for so. But this is short term. I love PF for everything it is & isnt."
"Got in today...I hate the price, but the entire stock market is overpriced right now. To get a good growth stock, it seems like you have to overpay at this point."
Yeehaw! PLNT beat on earnings and revenue and announced 100 million dollar stock buy back. Also PLNT said under the new tax law their tax rate will drop from 39% down to 25%. I am a Planet Fitness member and stock owner.
"Also, perhaps most important to confirm brand strength, same store sales growth was over 11%. The street was expecting 9%. They beat on every metric. I wouldn't be surprised if it opens at new 52-week high and holds. It never should have tanked in January to begin with, when that one analyst downgraded it right after New Years while the broad market ripped 20% higher. Turns out he was dead wrong. Now all that selling has to be reversed just to bring it back to last year's reality. Then up another 10% based on the new earnings guidance. A slow drift to $40 is not out of the question if the market holds up."
What are the options at this point: Go fund me page? Close locations permanently? Good luck selling equipment
this seems a bit excessive.
Starting to get pretty cheap! Just like their membership! BUY BUY BUY
Short at 56. Even if the gyms open today no one is going to go there. It’s called common sense.
55 after er???
I don't see how PLNT can realistically stay in the mid-$30 range. I see PLNT sinking back down to its 52-week low level. GLTA.
Just did my first gym sesh since shutdown. Gym was very clean. They also had new equipment. People will need gym affordable memberships as they gained weight and lost jobs/income. I’d love to buy lower
What are people's thoughts on whether this stock could get hurt by another covid resurgence this winter?
Did anyone notice the CEO pulled the lunk alarm after he gave earnings projections.
"They were doing well before the pandemic and it may take some time but several large chains, Golds, 24 hr I believe are gone. Great long term buy, I would like to buy it a little cheaper"
"Should I get out and take a loss or hold? Bought in at 70.00???? Help, guys!"
DOW IS UP 317 PLNT DOWN 7.000% PANIC SELLING TOMMOROW
1500 stores now! All 50 states!
No pizza at my local PF. Hard to buy pizza when you are losing money every day.
"I'm not understanding why there are so some many bulls on PLNT. I don't see people going back to gyms even after covid is resolved. Also, most people have setup their own home gyms now."
"Unless this is the end of the world, PF will be alright. If it is the end of the world, then it doesn't matter anyway. I'd like to think that there would be a much lower entry point here under the current market conditions - so the current price action is really really surprising - but then again cruise line stocks are getting way out in front of the recovery story. The market is pricing in that despite the return of state imposed gym closures, the post recovery future will have PF as a significant marketshare gainer. Keep watching - you might get that entry point price somewhere along the line in the next month or 2. The question is - when it comes - will you take it?"
"Working out at home is not a new idea brought forward by CV-19. Millions of people have tried this long before the pandemic and in the long run people give up on the boring basement bikes and tune-table treadmills. Face it, working out at home sucks and there’s always something else to do around the house and with the family. Peloton is already trying to update its customers bikes with newer models and in a way buying back the used bikes. I would guess the last thing they want is thousands of there bikes for sale on FB Marketplace and Craig’s List. This would dramatically reduce the value of their product and their customers that have cheaper products will be less likely to continue paying high monthly fees.￼ Planet Fitness is a friendly environment with hundreds of high quality machines and for 10.00 per month. That’s less than two beer and a tip in restaurants everywhere .Even México where PF is growing. My bet is on PF in 2021!"
I just joined PF. I am VERY impressed. I have been going to gyms for 40 years and the value to price is outstanding. Very little to join and no upselling to the higher priced package. I see this as the best bang for your buck
"Polatan's woes are PLNT's gain. We are going to $100 by year end, looking at the bullish chart."
You want to get in on a stock like this while the street is NOT impressed with earnings. This stock will likely flirt with 100's towards the end of this year as more and more people pick this up as another re-opening name going forward.
Bk announcement yet?
"Just on a valuation basis, I think this one is starting to get away. Company is growing but look at the balance sheet. Large debt. Also, lots of intangible assets and goodwill. Trading at high multiples of revenue. Also this category has high price elasticity. If they want to raise the price people will just stop going. They certainly have room to add more locations, but IDK just looking at the metrics it seems overvalued."
"PLNT fitness CEO making the media rounds this week. Positive seasonal trends - increased management bench strength, and 15% growth outlook for new US locations. Same store metrics have also been trending positively too. If they can get international growth going this has a lot of room to run in 2020"
Has anyone invested in this look at the balance sheet? Where the liabilities are greater than the assets. It’s very risky to own this stock as revenue will be drastically reduced for a long time as well as many franchises likely not to honor commitments to Corporate
planet fitness stores will see large cancelations and revenue decline and their franchisees will struggle. forget about the revenue from opening new facilities. but stonk people say not to worry about the upside down balance sheet
Article today on insider purchase. He wouldn't buy unless he thought the stock was going higher. Helps the bullish case here.
What is PF doing to retain customers?
Did any of you geniuses read the 10 Q? Or do you just sit here pondering. Hardware sales are going to be down 50% for the next year. Everyone’s numbers are predicated on the highest possible opportunity which is still down 30% year-over-year on earnings. So you have a company trading at 80 times next year’s earnings that doesn’t pay a dividend in a questionable business that may be in a house of pain for a long time. This is where you want to speculate?
CA closing indoor operations again including gyms in some counties. This is a template for all states struggling with reopening and escalation of COVID cases. This does not bode well for gym operators and all other commercial businesses reliant on foot traffic in store.
"Very few insiders hold a lot of stock. All selling, no buying. If any one gets stocks, it’s in 0 cost rewards."
Out of the 2000 locations only 100 are company owned. The rest are all franchised. That just means that there 1900 agreements that each one stands on its own. 7% royalty could be a problem. Planet hold 100's of master leases that they sublet to the franchisee......lots of exposure. This company has so many moving pieces and the rapid growth can sometimes do more harm then good.
They will pre announce in January that eps expected to be higher due to new Tax bill. From 32% to 21%. A lot of this factored in but this could be a $40 stock soon.
"Why on earth would anyone be long PLNT? With markets soaring, why drive your car into a brick wall? This is a national gym with concentrations in Arizona and other ""hot zone states"". It is trading at a rich P/E of 51+. It also has a failed 6-month chart that failed to break to the upside on a cup pattern. If you are long, don't be a rat brain trader and hold expecting that ""hope"" is a strategy. Sell and gather yourself and look for a winner trade. Good luck to all!"
Total revenue decreased from the prior year period by 36.8% to $105.4. That doesn't warrant a $60 share price. No guidance either.
Back to 20. Class action lawsuits. Another low float stock pumped by hedge funds to outperform the market then dumped. Same as weight watchers. WW hit $105. Year later it was $17. PLNT will do the same...so hedgies can buy again and play this game all over again. Spring 2020 this will be under $20. Then magically a new campaign and optimism will return to double the share price....just like weight watchers.
ill say it again--this thing has a pulse because of the incredible performance of the general market especially the nasd--when the market rolls over--which will be soon this will be one of the hardest hit because unlike Netflix and amazon have no money coming in with no change in sight
Planet Fitness is growing not only in the US but internationally as well. Partnering with established companies such as Kohl’s. Planet Fitness should be in the S&P 500 within the next 2-3 years. It is one of the fastest growing franchises in the US
"Covid-19 update:As of 5:08 est the world is at 9178 deaths, today. The highest by 700+ since April. Did people forget?? This is a major problem.....$plnt $uber $mgm $ual $rcl $wynn"
"I see that they moved group classes outside----that doesn't work in the rain,cold and snow--has anyone looked at the calender"
"Planet Fitness is growing!!!! 4,000 gym footprint for the future in the USA. Less than 2,000 now"
Planet Fitness upgraded to outperform today. Love working out there and wearing purple
Gearing up for a new all-time high.Earnings next week.
huge debt. people open your eyes. they have an unsustainable business during this time...people are going to cancel they will face higher costs associated with new requirements to stay clean and revenue will fall. their debt to equity is insanely high. also people are very upset theyre making it so difficult to cancel. even during good times i would argue this company is dramatically overvalued
Folks had all the time in the world to stop buying this one. You should know nobody will be going to a Planet Fitness for the next two months...
am reading these people have 12 million members at $10.00 per month and over 2000 locations.Tremendous revenue per month with plans to expand to 4400 locations.The math looks good to me.....Good luck to all......
I love PF the stock and the gym. but how is this thing climbing when all the CA gyms are closed?
"Is trading halted till tomorrow, or just no buyers to move the price?"
"The question is: when gyms start reopening, how many cancellations will happen? Let's be honest, NO ONE new is signing up for PLNT in the next 12 months. But most people will just let their account keep charging every month because they are too lazy to cancel."
What’s the transmission to EPS of a $1.00 increase in membership fee? About time the tack on a dollar on my membership.
Market cap is only 5.74 billion. 200 million members at $10 per month is 2 billion revenue per month.
Looks like big trouble ahead :(
"I don't exactly know why people would invest in a gym. I don't exactly know why people invest in planet fitness. I mean I go to 2 gyms, my personal gym and planet fitness to help train people get into shape.Absolutely cringeworthy. The one I go too has tons of bad form, macho manes who slam 10 pound weights, and no one whipes up after themselves. Disgusting. But to be fair, I personally see planet fitness doing well. I think it's great for what it is. I guess I just don't particularly like the people in some cases who go there. It's really weird seeing people go to a gym made to enforce gym etiquette not use gym etiquette. Was doing 4 plates on the squat machine since no squats. I mean, I can't barbell 4 plates, maybe a little more than 3. And I made the least sound amongst a majority of people there, slamming the 30 pound weights. None of the staff told them to stop slamming the weights. Here I am gently making 0 sound racking my weight. Absolutely cringeworthy. No gym etiquette. My tldr analysis? Great gym for people looking to be fit, drop the ego, and they need to do a better job at enforcing gym etiquette."
"This is a very fast moving company,no China / oil effect,more people want to exercise,number of gyms increasing in locations and margins, no effect from sales and purchase,looks like sold sustained growth should be 75 by year end"
What I love about planet fitness is the wining formula: culture + its a feel good/ high energy type of business. Customers are happy + employees are happy + owners and coorporate are happy + investors are happy. It's a full happy circle. Cheers!
"It's the bottom of the ninth inning of the recovery, folks. Vaccines are already widely available, even for walk-ups.On the call, Roundeau says -> 14.4M members at end of April.+0.9M from low at end of 2020,Still down -1.1M from last year.All adults in the US became eligible for the vaccine on April 19. All that was left at the end of April was for those at the back of the line to get their second dose. 70.4% of everyone who have pursued vaccination already had both shots. If the 29% of vaccine recipients still waiting on the second jab continue rejoining PF at the same rate as the priority group Planet Fitness may get back up to ~14.8M members by the end of May. But that will be the end of easy pick ups.They are still down 0.7 million members from peak last year - almost 4% YOY membership loss even as Covid fades into memory."
"Bigger loss than expected, No equity for shareholders (actually negative equity), so how come the PE ratio is super expensive??? (45!!!). Even Microsoft or Apple has lower PE"
Just got back from the gym. It was busy and no mask mandate in tx. This company has many successful decades ahead. There equipment is cleaner and safer than any other gym with the exception of equinox
Planet Fitness Tumbles on Report of Potential Virus Exposure
"Gold's Gym, a similar chain to 24 Hour Fitness, filed for bankruptcy in May. The company said the virus affected it ""deeply and in many ways,"" which included the temporary closures of many of its 700 global gyms. Gold's permanently closed 30 locations in April and expects to emerge from bankruptcy in August."
Planet traffic is up. Peloton getting desperate slashing bike prices by $400.. planet running back to school sign up special and they just retained Publicis Marketing firm! Insiders are buying at these prices.
Gym traffic is improving! I had to hang around a few minutes for a machine to free up. Looks like people want to go out and exercise and release the pent up energy from being locked down
I checked out LA fitness in Cali and had to walk out. I came to the realization the planet fitness equipment is better designed and much much better maintained. Oh and dues are better at planet anyway. Clearly planet is the better option. Had to go back long today.. bought 128shares will sell when this is in the 130s
"“Based on recent research, aerosolized droplets can remain airborne for up to 3 hours, making the potential for spread in crowded and confined spaces such as fitness studios problematic,” said Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency medicine physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City."
PLNT bankruptcy is a possibility in next 12 months. What can save them? More debt? No. Share dilution? Maybe. Will the market pay $50+ a share? Not likely.
"My thesis has changed a bit on the liquidity concerns. They can make it through the pandemic. Rather, the concern should be how much damage is being done to the business model long term if people switch to at home gyms. That said, PLNT’s customer base tends to be more casual. They’re not really the type to outfit a home gym."
Gyms are on the rebound as retail sales are back to pre pandemic levels. Planet is on track for record growth as people’s desires to get back to the gym and get back in shape is stronger than ever. Already Planet is making strides in new customers that are moving to higher membership payments and additional services. The broad selling today is creating the perfect opportunity today to grab some capitulation shares at 55.55!!!!
This business depends on subscription payments. 35% minimum is stuck in a freeze scenario. They are doing between 70-90% of last years revenue. But ALSO will not collect 35% of the Existing business. This will crumble... won’t BK... but won’t rebuild fundamentals until 2022. Betting my account against this.

"As a employee school just started so many college students cancelled their memberships because they were moving away, give it time."
Just love working out with a mask on. Time to retest lows.
"I think this is a little overvalued to be honest. could go down in a few weeks. dont take my advise though, we will see"
Could someone chime in as to what is going on with Planet?

"Why did this go down when markets so green. Oh yeah, common sense I almost forgot, lol. Longs may get the longing!"
"I was in for 2000 shares at just under $20. This is a relatively quick quadruple for me and I'm feeling its overpriced. I just took 1500 shares off the table this morning, leaving 500 shares. One never goes broke by taking profits, especially in a wildly overpriced market. I still have a little skin in the game, but now, it's all the ""casino's"" money! GLTA"

"Question is ""are customers cancelling memberships?"""
How does PLNT prevent customer complaints via phone? By NOT providing an 800 # for customer service on their Website. It takes a search via google to find it.
WHEN CEO OF PLANET FITNESS MADE FACE MASKS MANDATORY AT ALL TIMES IN ALL PLANET FITNESS LOCATIONS-HE SEALED THE DUMPING OF PLANET FITNESS STOCK-NO ONE IN RIGHT MIND IS GOING TO DO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WITH A MASK ON!! SELLEM AS LONG AS YOU CAN!!
Looks like a good buying opportunity here around $74
63 bucks and gyms still closed? where is the revenue? people will do a class action to get their dues back and then cancel.
"Everyone keep an eye on NLS (Nautilus) Coming off a solid quarter, new CEO Jim Barr came in last year & talked directly about how connected home fitness is the new way to workout! He evens talks up Peloton and the great job they've done as an industry leader unlike other companies who jock Peloton all the way til court day!! The new Bowflex C6 bike even reps how you can connect your iPad and stream the peloton app or zwift app!! They also own Schwin bikes which can do the same for under $1000. We do know Peloton is the leader but the price will be steep for some and Nautilus offers the best alternative while respecting Peloton & what they've done at the same time!! The company has been around for over 35 years and have been a public company for over 20 years!!! NLS was a $20 stock a couple years ago!! Now new CEO JIM BARR is righting the ship and is experiencing surging demand into Q2. The stock is in the 5s right now!!! I'm keeping an eye on it and you should too. #NLS main brands are schwinn & bowflex"
"Overvalued? No one told the biggest dude in the gym that he was TOO BIG...not one person did that. Underbought? Nope, oversold is more like it. There is way too much volume at these levels to be anything less than a breakaway movement. People love this stock and its 70x earings and 80x cash flow. You can't actually find a better performing, higher multiple stock in the markets. Can't do it. Zero performance enhancements, NO Pumping, 110% real price action! This is the real deal folks, no dividend, high growth, huge FCF, huge margins, Zero Debt, increasing membership. Don't stop this rocket! $100/share is just another notch on this weight belt!"
"This is going to come down a whole lot faster than it's gone up. Gyms and movie theaters will be the unsafest places to be during this virus outbreak. You can't make money with a gym unless you have volume and they won't fill up. With summer upon us, people will feel safer getting their exercise outdoors. Thirty million unemployed will further reduce interest. Older people will avoid entirely unless they have a death wish. This is one overinflated stock that will come down hard. Next earnings report will crush it."
"can someone explain how this stock share price is within 10-15% of its preCOVID levels? that makes no sense! everything is shutting down and what reckless people want to go to the gym right now? as they say: ""go to the gym today, and your grandparents die in two weeks""."
Earnings call sounds generally very positive for long term. More market share as industry consolidates. New owners should get favorable real estate which is there number 1 expense. Should be a big 2021-2022
"There is also 1.5 billion in debt here. so for the equity to have any value, the value of the company needs to be above 1.5 billion.. it is hardly certain that this isn't a bankruptcy if covid gets worse and lasts a year or so more.."
Company has allThis debt and they will lose at least 25% of customer base. I don’t see this surviving very long
"Post COVID, & with vaccine arrival this year, this will be the only gym to remain in business $90 by summer 2021"
lots of debt. Gym trading at over 10x revenue. - good luck
"Any bankruptcy experts here? What's the mathematical chance factoring: cash on hand, burn rate, franchisees default rate, etc."
CEO sells shares. Should give us a 5-10% drop.
I am back in this stock. Overpriced for sure but most high growth stocks are. Just workout there and enjoy your health as your investment grows over time
You don’t want to see what happens past $49 per
I am truly baffled
Who are buying at this level the GYMS will be closed for another 3 /4 months it will go below $40 in next few weeks . It will take 6/9 months from now to get back to normal by the most of people will be used to some online work outs it will be a long how to see growth
"35 PE, ALL gyms are closed, fake pump won't last long"
Hang on! Don’t sell. People will workout in gyms again. Don’t believe the COVID BS. It doesn’t exist!
Great piece by Motley Fool this morning on PLNT. Strong in pre-market.
42% EPS Growth YOY. Wow.
Gyms closing down again.
"This looked like a solid quarter to me. Same store sales growth of 11% is the key number. You can't ask for much better than that. EPS in-line and a beat on revenue.The outlook they gave for 2018 is the exact same outlook they gave on their previous call back in Feb. That is to say - 20% increase in annual revenue, high single digit same-store sales, and 40% increase in adjusted earnings.So how does a great outlook in February all of a sudden appear ""tepid"" in May? Probably because the analysts got ahead of themselves. But the long-run appears to be well on track."
How do you pay rents for a year with no income. These franchises members are desperate to open but faces high debt and limited capacity to gain profitability... might be a short candidate here.
WHY IS THIS GOING DOWN IF WE BEAT ER?

look at the business model people. This is a good stock.
Ill buy at $12
I'm a member and workout often... in the last two weeks people are pouring into my club... look for much better numbers in Q2...
Cancelled yesterday. Running outdoors with a lot of social distancing. Will resubscribe next year when covid is gone. This is a great play during a typical recession barring a viral disease pandemic
Give it two months
