Nice looking chart. Looks like we are going to challenge the old yearly high of $90.
Looks like the max pain for the calls expiring today is $82.50. Look for a close at or a little below that level.
Article today on insider purchase. He wouldn't buy unless he thought the stock was going higher. Helps the bullish case here.

"Polatan's woes are PLNT's gain. We are going to $100 by year end, looking at the bullish chart."
Excited to be cutting prices based on collapsing sales? What BS!
Hang on! Don’t sell. People will workout in gyms again. Don’t believe the COVID BS. It doesn’t exist!
Does PLNT ever not miss earning est ?if so can anyone tell the last Q that PLNT beat earnings est ?
Did anyone notice the CEO pulled the lunk alarm after he gave earnings projections.
"Planet Fitness EarningsRevenue for the chain rose 30.1% to $174.4 million. The results just beat Wall Street's forecast for $173.69 million. Wall Street expected Planet Fitness earnings per share to jump 33% to 32 cents. But the earnings came in higher, at 34 cents.Same-store sales rose 10.1%, marking the company's 48th straight quarter of positive same-stores sales gains.For the full year, Planet Fitness forecast a roughly 15% revenue gain. Analysts currently expect $637.15 million in revenue for 2019. That would mark an 11% gain from the $572.9 million Planet Fitness logged for all of last year.Planet Fitness also said it expected a 25% jump in adjusted earnings per share. Wall Street forecast EPS of $1.43 for 2019, which would be a 17% gain from the $1.22 per share Planet Fitness earned in 2018.The company said it expected same-store sales to increase ""in the high single digits.""

The IBD 50 stock on Friday briefly topped a 59.62 flat-base entry, touching a record 61.51 before drifting lower. Shares continued falling Monday.Planet Fitness stock on Tuesday was finding support at its 50-day line. The 50-day line is a key test of investors' support in a stock. Planet Fitness stock traded tightly for much of this year.'Amazonian' Business Model?The attempted breakout by Planet Fitness stock on Friday came after a Jefferies analyst said the company had an ""Amazonian business model"" that protected it from competition.The analyst, Randal Konik, likened the company to a ""platform,"" along the lines of Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon, that could drive sales and consumer commitment.That platform, he said, consisted of digital services like an app that makes for smoother service. More ""premium memberships,"" advertising, and a broader array of gym equipment could help create more loyal customers. The company's Black Card perks program has room to grow. Franchising should keep expansion brisk and lighten the company's costs.And in some ways, Amazon (AMZN), which has forced physical retailers to clear out of stores over the years, has also helped companies like Planet Fitness grow.""From our group of experienced franchisees who are eager to expand their footprints to increasingly favorable real estate trends, our growing national and local advertising budgets and our initiatives aimed at enhancing the member experience, we believe there are tremendous opportunities to build on our recent accomplishments,"" Planet Fitness CEO Chris Rondeau said in a statement on Tuesday.'Robust' Fitness IndustryPlanet Fitness last year said it would ""work to build upon our current momentum as brick-and-mortar retail continues to be under pressure from online businesses."" Management added that ""landlords are increasingly looking to Planet Fitness to drive traffic in their centers.""Konik said that the fitness industry remains ""robust,"" as rival high-value, low-price gyms expand as well.But the discount fitness center market remains fairly scattered. Only a handful have more than 100 stores to their name, compared to Planet Fitness' 1,650.

Planet Fitness reports bigger quarterly loss than expected..
Dropped below the 200 day moving average yesterday at $78. We need to climb back above that level and the stock will be fine. Higher. Great company.
Liabilities greater than assets is pretty scary. There will be some if not a lot of franchises that will not be able to keep it’s commitments to Corp-scary. How do they plan to pay 2 billion dollars in debt when net income for the quarter is a small 10 million and no income potentially for foreseeable future-scary. Stock price to me seems like it should be about $30 per share
"Planet only owns about 100 of the 2000 gyms, the other 1900 are franchised. Franchisee either lease from Planet or they lease the facility on their own. Planet also receives a 7% royalty as well as finances gym equipment for the franchisee. Folks thinking its just $10.00 a month and they wont cancel is a stretch. Most folks upgrade to the $25.00 pkg. So there will be some cancellations as well as little new memberships. Corporate Planet Fitness does have a lot of negatives coming at it."
The guys on CNBC's fast money were raving about PLNT today. $100 price target. Google it.

I never know what to do with this stick. Bought it pre-COVID when it was close to its current price and it quickly set all-time highs. Obviously the pandemic didn’t help this one and it still hasn’t fully recovered.
Has anyone invested in this look at the balance sheet? Where the liabilities are greater than the assets. It’s very risky to own this stock as revenue will be drastically reduced for a long time as well as many franchises likely not to honor commitments to Corporate
