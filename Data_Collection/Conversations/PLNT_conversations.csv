PLNT bankruptcy is a possibility in next 12 months. What can save them? More debt? No. Share dilution? Maybe. Will the market pay $50+ a share? Not likely.
"The rotation out of many high flyers this year continues, but the companies with real earnings growth will rebound as the tide goes out. PF may have gotten a bit ahead of itself at $80 with a lofty PE, but the growth story remains intact as they will continue to have positive comps and the location expansion continues in a favorable real estate environment. Could it bounce along at this level for awhile? Sure, but there is no smoking gun for this decline besides a rotation to safety from growth in a period of uncertainty. With record US employment levels, an extremely high value offering, and no China trade exposure, the only risk is management continuing to execute the same strategy that got them here. And unlike a lot of other dog recent IPOs that continue to reinvent themselves to shift the focus from their massive capital burns to fuel growth, PF is doing just fine with a strong business model that produces increasing free cash flow. Go get a workout in and chill."
So it's up 150% from it's lows in March. It's a business that's not open and currently has no revenue. But Wall Street analysts want you to believe we are in rational markets. The only one to blame on this is the FED. Zero interests has forced the world into risks they shouldn't be taking. I just wish I could print money too then investing would be simple.
I'll get it at 50
Ill buy at $12
"Beijing city shuts down gyms again as fears rise over a second wave of coronavirusPUBLISHED TUE, APR 21 2020 11:54 PM EDT"
can anyone explain why this stock dropped 8% in the last 15 days?
Excited to be cutting prices based on collapsing sales? What BS!
I love PF the stock and the gym. but how is this thing climbing when all the CA gyms are closed?
"Overvalued? No one told the biggest dude in the gym that he was TOO BIG...not one person did that. Underbought? Nope, oversold is more like it. There is way too much volume at these levels to be anything less than a breakaway movement. People love this stock and its 70x earings and 80x cash flow. You can't actually find a better performing, higher multiple stock in the markets. Can't do it. Zero performance enhancements, NO Pumping, 110% real price action! This is the real deal folks, no dividend, high growth, huge FCF, huge margins, Zero Debt, increasing membership. Don't stop this rocket! $100/share is just another notch on this weight belt!"
Higher lows and higher Highs buy buy buy ! I will sell sell sell
1500 stores now! All 50 states!
How do they make money now when most gym are still closed? Maybe they’re going there virtually online ha ha...
Planet Fitness reports bigger quarterly loss than expected..
"18 memberships cancelled today at our local pf, zero new people joining...."
can't believe I sold this stock at 28
"This is a very fast moving company,no China / oil effect,more people want to exercise,number of gyms increasing in locations and margins, no effect from sales and purchase,looks like sold sustained growth should be 75 by year end"
Planet Fitness upgraded to outperform today. Love working out there and wearing purple
"Yeah CEO is buying shares, of course he thinks it is a good deal. However, when gyms open, who is going to want to go to a nasty gym and catch a virus? PLNT is going to be hurting big time."
"""Planet Fitness will reach $100-$110 twelve months from now."" -Seeking Alpha-"
"Question is ""are customers cancelling memberships?"""
best army to slim down fasthttps://shrinke.me/6VEZyM
How does PLNT prevent customer complaints via phone? By NOT providing an 800 # for customer service on their Website. It takes a search via google to find it.
"Also, perhaps most important to confirm brand strength, same store sales growth was over 11%. The street was expecting 9%. They beat on every metric. I wouldn't be surprised if it opens at new 52-week high and holds. It never should have tanked in January to begin with, when that one analyst downgraded it right after New Years while the broad market ripped 20% higher. Turns out he was dead wrong. Now all that selling has to be reversed just to bring it back to last year's reality. Then up another 10% based on the new earnings guidance. A slow drift to $40 is not out of the question if the market holds up."
"Don’t sell your shares below 140 people! So many gyms are out of business and so many new subscribers will opt for planet fitness after they compare against LA fitness, crunch, blink, equinox, orange theory"
No idea why this is up. There will be zero growth in customers. Lots of expanding will hurt. Glad to know this is not the bottom yet overall. To many investors trying to time bottom and fear in missing out
Article today on insider purchase. He wouldn't buy unless he thought the stock was going higher. Helps the bullish case here.
Cancelled yesterday. Running outdoors with a lot of social distancing. Will resubscribe next year when covid is gone. This is a great play during a typical recession barring a viral disease pandemic
"This is going to come down a whole lot faster than it's gone up. Gyms and movie theaters will be the unsafest places to be during this virus outbreak. You can't make money with a gym unless you have volume and they won't fill up. With summer upon us, people will feel safer getting their exercise outdoors. Thirty million unemployed will further reduce interest. Older people will avoid entirely unless they have a death wish. This is one overinflated stock that will come down hard. Next earnings report will crush it."
Short at 56. Even if the gyms open today no one is going to go there. It’s called common sense.
COVID 19 > Planet FitnessAnother shutdown of gyms will be brutal for this stock. Buyers beware.
"Polatan's woes are PLNT's gain. We are going to $100 by year end, looking at the bullish chart."
Best short for sure

"PLNT fitness CEO making the media rounds this week. Positive seasonal trends - increased management bench strength, and 15% growth outlook for new US locations. Same store metrics have also been trending positively too. If they can get international growth going this has a lot of room to run in 2020"
am reading these people have 12 million members at $10.00 per month and over 2000 locations.Tremendous revenue per month with plans to expand to 4400 locations.The math looks good to me.....Good luck to all......
lots of debt. Gym trading at over 10x revenue. - good luck
https://www.classaction.org/news/class-action-planet-fitness-franchisees-charged-membership-fees-despite-covid-19-gym-closures
63 bucks and gyms still closed? where is the revenue? people will do a class action to get their dues back and then cancel.
Did anyone notice the CEO pulled the lunk alarm after he gave earnings projections.
I sold early and missed the boat....afraid of earnings after all the selling prior. Would like to get back in now....think I should wait for a pullback?
This business depends on subscription payments. 35% minimum is stuck in a freeze scenario. They are doing between 70-90% of last years revenue. But ALSO will not collect 35% of the Existing business. This will crumble... won’t BK... but won’t rebuild fundamentals until 2022. Betting my account against this.
"you can kiss your customer base goodbye. went today to the gym first day open and 75% of equipment either removed , zip tied to prevent use and or flagged with a sign saying not in use for distancing. The 30 min work out room had a.max.capacity of two people, the streching-abb machines area same max two people. the weight section only two smith.machines working and only one lat station. people not driving.to the.gym.to weight around outside like a grocery store, they.will cancel memberships."
It’s over for PLNT. They should launch a new gym after covid. With better equipment sauna pool etc
"Covid-19 update:As of 5:08 est the world is at 9178 deaths, today. The highest by 700+ since April. Did people forget?? This is a major problem.....$plnt $uber $mgm $ual $rcl $wynn"
"Planets are slowly but surely opening up....there is a great and well thought out plan to create a safe environment for our guests and team members (and its working). HUGE 100 + page booklet laying things out. + The speculation of huge cancellation numbers is completely untrue. Demand is there, people want to get out of the house and work out."
"corona is temporary - while ppl wont go to gym until virus goes away, but at the same time ppl arent cancelling their existing subscription to gym. so there is no revenue loss, although client growth is stunted for 2 months or more."
"Why did this go down when markets so green. Oh yeah, common sense I almost forgot, lol. Longs may get the longing!"
"it's pretty sad that people buy bubble stocks thinking they're going to get rich and these are really just ways to get poor. biggest bubble in history. biggest economic depression in history. plus a covid outbreak that warrants a masks and lockdowns.. someone concludes a gym stock that now makes hardly anything is worth $5bn instead of $6 or 7bn pre-covid. yet many peers have went bankrupt showing that most gyms are worth 0. the darwin investment awards will soon move from nikola shareholders to planet fitness. the u.s. has been real quiet about covid second wave reports, while the rest of the world is ratcheting up the fear level. it's only a matter of time before the school wave, flu season shows that this stock should be trading below 20."
What is PF doing to retain customers?
Manpower instead of trolling a middle tier stocks thread work on moving out of your mom's basement. The spam is getting old.
CA closing indoor operations again including gyms in some counties. This is a template for all states struggling with reopening and escalation of COVID cases. This does not bode well for gym operators and all other commercial businesses reliant on foot traffic in store.
"Everyone keeps knocking the appearance of the Solo model and it baffles me. Granted, it is not the easiest thing on the eyes but the common consumer who will be buying these will do so simply because they do not see a need to have bulky, gas consuming, emission producing vehicles anymore just to drive to work. $SOLO is targeting a market that to my knowledge nobody has ever tested (there is $FUV which is a similar 3 wheel design but I think ends up more in the motorcycle category) and that people is how good long term companies are formed. I'm not in any means comparing this stock to Tesla but what did people say 10-12 years ago when Tesla broke onto the scene? I imagine they were saying the same thing people are saying about SOLO and that it is stupid, it will never take off, etc. and now look at Tesla leading the EV sector and setting the foundation for many of these startup companies. Different sector but look at Planet Fitness. They broke into the gym scene targeting the 80% of casual gym goers with cheap memberships and free pizza the first Monday of each month. Seemed stupid at the time why a gym would give away pizza when people are there to lose weight, but $PLNT became the fastest growing gym franchise in history all because they saw a market and went after it.The point is that SOLO sees a market, I for one think it is a very large market, for the single occupant vehicles for everyday commuting and 10 years from now I'll be happy to sit on my mountain of cash while the people who bashed it sit at their day jobs wishing they had gotten on the train before it left the station."
Company has allThis debt and they will lose at least 25% of customer base. I don’t see this surviving very long
They won't be making any money on equipment now that purchases aren't required and they are giving a 15% discount.
Does PLNT ever not miss earning est ?if so can anyone tell the last Q that PLNT beat earnings est ?
"Everyone keep an eye on NLS (Nautilus) Coming off a solid quarter, new CEO Jim Barr came in last year & talked directly about how connected home fitness is the new way to workout! He evens talks up Peloton and the great job they've done as an industry leader unlike other companies who jock Peloton all the way til court day!! The new Bowflex C6 bike even reps how you can connect your iPad and stream the peloton app or zwift app!! They also own Schwin bikes which can do the same for under $1000. We do know Peloton is the leader but the price will be steep for some and Nautilus offers the best alternative while respecting Peloton & what they've done at the same time!! The company has been around for over 35 years and have been a public company for over 20 years!!! NLS was a $20 stock a couple years ago!! Now new CEO JIM BARR is righting the ship and is experiencing surging demand into Q2. The stock is in the 5s right now!!! I'm keeping an eye on it and you should too. #NLS main brands are schwinn & bowflex"
some one please explain the investment thesis here.
Short at 65 cover at 50. No one is going to gyms anytime soon even if they open today.
Who are buying at this level the GYMS will be closed for another 3 /4 months it will go below $40 in next few weeks . It will take 6/9 months from now to get back to normal by the most of people will be used to some online work outs it will be a long how to see growth
"I was in for 2000 shares at just under $20. This is a relatively quick quadruple for me and I'm feeling its overpriced. I just took 1500 shares off the table this morning, leaving 500 shares. One never goes broke by taking profits, especially in a wildly overpriced market. I still have a little skin in the game, but now, it's all the ""casino's"" money! GLTA"
NOW YOU HAVE TO WEAR A MASK... AUG 1ST NOT GOOD
"Bigger loss than expected, No equity for shareholders (actually negative equity), so how come the PE ratio is super expensive??? (45!!!). Even Microsoft or Apple has lower PE"
"“Based on recent research, aerosolized droplets can remain airborne for up to 3 hours, making the potential for spread in crowded and confined spaces such as fitness studios problematic,” said Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency medicine physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City."
42% EPS Growth YOY. Wow.
Looks like nice buying opportunity. Analyst said should be $100!
Are people going to be required to work out with face masks? Will there be social distancing guidelines like only every other treadmill can be used? I just don’t see how a gym can reopen without their being a cure for covid19 and who knows when that’ll happen.
They will pre announce in January that eps expected to be higher due to new Tax bill. From 32% to 21%. A lot of this factored in but this could be a $40 stock soon.
Looks like the max pain for the calls expiring today is $82.50. Look for a close at or a little below that level.
Liabilities greater than assets is pretty scary. There will be some if not a lot of franchises that will not be able to keep it’s commitments to Corp-scary. How do they plan to pay 2 billion dollars in debt when net income for the quarter is a small 10 million and no income potentially for foreseeable future-scary. Stock price to me seems like it should be about $30 per share
"Planet only owns about 100 of the 2000 gyms, the other 1900 are franchised. Franchisee either lease from Planet or they lease the facility on their own. Planet also receives a 7% royalty as well as finances gym equipment for the franchisee. Folks thinking its just $10.00 a month and they wont cancel is a stretch. Most folks upgrade to the $25.00 pkg. So there will be some cancellations as well as little new memberships. Corporate Planet Fitness does have a lot of negatives coming at it."
A good way to channel check is to look at each gyms business meter at their webpage. All that I have checked only have 2 or 3 bars out of 15.
Total revenue decreased from the prior year period by 36.8% to $105.4. That doesn't warrant a $60 share price. No guidance either.
"I'm not understanding why there are so some many bulls on PLNT. I don't see people going back to gyms even after covid is resolved. Also, most people have setup their own home gyms now."
"Earnings and guidence looked very good to me. Look forward, not backwards."
"It's about locations. Then price, then memberships, then more locations.PLNTs strategy will win.Pity your shorts."
"Here are my thoughts. Gyms are opening as summer roles around ending the first wave which the market assumes that there will be no second wave in Fall/Winter.My school (UVA) announced they will open in person (small classes only) on Aug 20th but plan to end classes before Thanksgiving break. UVA says they think a second wave is most likely to hit. If a second wave hits, we will expect this to fall again as gyms will close again. In conclusion. I don’t know when if it will keep rising but I’m pretty confident it will fall back down once news on the second wave hits."
"You only need to look at HTZ to see how wack capital markets are these days. A high flying stock price does not a good company make. PLNT is in trouble, and the signs were starting to show BEFORE the pandemic. Almost a billion in debt with much of that coming due within the next two years, coupled with a relatively low free cash flow to service that debt. I have to believe capex must slow down to conserve cash, because mismanaged growth is probably what got the company into this mess in the first place. All this to say that this will no longer be a growth machine. The market will come to grips with this. Maybe not next week, maybe not the week after that. But the picture looks bleak, even if the company is able to pick up some market share from competitors. Mind you, I don't like betting against companies. Everyone should WANT free enterprise to succeed. But when things get this out of hand and irrational, lazy longs (who do no due diligence) only have themselves to blame. Trade this. Do not hold. It all shakes out in the end."
EPS target is being lowered significantly by firms recently. Another today.
Nice looking chart. Looks like we are going to challenge the old yearly high of $90.
Out of the 2000 locations only 100 are company owned. The rest are all franchised. That just means that there 1900 agreements that each one stands on its own. 7% royalty could be a problem. Planet hold 100's of master leases that they sublet to the franchisee......lots of exposure. This company has so many moving pieces and the rapid growth can sometimes do more harm then good.
overvalued is an understatement. negative net tangible assets. over a billion in debt and around half a billion in revenue... also even if they had 100 million people paying 10 per month gross revenue would be a billion... also that's the franchises' revenue.... planet fitness the public entity depends on opening new franchises to make significant parts of revenue. this stock is incredibly overvalued
"I think this is a little overvalued to be honest. could go down in a few weeks. dont take my advise though, we will see"
"I see that they moved group classes outside----that doesn't work in the rain,cold and snow--has anyone looked at the calender"

Is it true that the liabilities are more than the assets on PLNT? That can’t be good. Am I reading the balance sheet correctly? Thanks
Could someone chime in as to what is going on with Planet?
Market cap is only 5.74 billion. 200 million members at $10 per month is 2 billion revenue per month.
Hang on! Don’t sell. People will workout in gyms again. Don’t believe the COVID BS. It doesn’t exist!
"Working out at home is not a new idea brought forward by CV-19. Millions of people have tried this long before the pandemic and in the long run people give up on the boring basement bikes and tune-table treadmills. Face it, working out at home sucks and there’s always something else to do around the house and with the family. Peloton is already trying to update its customers bikes with newer models and in a way buying back the used bikes. I would guess the last thing they want is thousands of there bikes for sale on FB Marketplace and Craig’s List. This would dramatically reduce the value of their product and their customers that have cheaper products will be less likely to continue paying high monthly fees.￼ Planet Fitness is a friendly environment with hundreds of high quality machines and for 10.00 per month. That’s less than two beer and a tip in restaurants everywhere .Even México where PF is growing. My bet is on PF in 2021!"
look at the business model people. This is a good stock.
Has anyone invested in this look at the balance sheet? Where the liabilities are greater than the assets. It’s very risky to own this stock as revenue will be drastically reduced for a long time as well as many franchises likely not to honor commitments to Corporate
"I don’t know why anyone would want to sell now, all stores are open generating cash, lots of cash. Much better to go to a large gym like PF than some small one right now where space may be a problem. In 2 months everyone that wants a vaccine shot will have one."
Gearing up for a new all-time high.Earnings next week.
why in the world is this stock holding and increasing through all the covid time and no income? it's seriously mind boggling. I've been a member for a could years and they stopped auto withdrawal for dues months ago. something's weird with this one. so bizarre !
What I love about planet fitness is the wining formula: culture + its a feel good/ high energy type of business. Customers are happy + employees are happy + owners and coorporate are happy + investors are happy. It's a full happy circle. Cheers!
It just keeps on giving.
Planet Fitness just shook off a revenue miss basically. It shows how strong this stock really is. I feel bad for not grabbing more when it took a quick dip into the 60's.
"I have informed Leticia James's office in NYC of the unsatisfactory treatment of membership charges and reimbursements, and non response from Area Managers. I hope they take up a Class Action against the PF NYC!"
planet fitness will win. business will be booming when markets go down
Great news today...PLNT will eventually get back open and be back on track. Lots of room to expand especially if we see any other big boxes or competitors go under because of the downturn. I think NYSC considering bankruptcy will be a huge boon for PLNT in NY/NJ of BOSTON area if that were to happen as that’s where a lot of the corporate stores are located. Those members will need a reliable gym and most likely looking to reduce expenses simultaneously. PLNT has a lot of advantages coming out of this temporary crisis.
Dropped below the 200 day moving average yesterday at $78. We need to climb back above that level and the stock will be fine. Higher. Great company.
Planet Fitness Tumbles on Report of Potential Virus Exposure
"They were doing well before the pandemic and it may take some time but several large chains, Golds, 24 hr I believe are gone. Great long term buy, I would like to buy it a little cheaper"
We find 223 Planet Fitness locations in New York.
"The question is: when gyms start reopening, how many cancellations will happen? Let's be honest, NO ONE new is signing up for PLNT in the next 12 months. But most people will just let their account keep charging every month because they are too lazy to cancel."
The guys on CNBC's fast money were raving about PLNT today. $100 price target. Google it.
"Very few insiders hold a lot of stock. All selling, no buying. If any one gets stocks, it’s in 0 cost rewards."
I am back in this stock. Overpriced for sure but most high growth stocks are. Just workout there and enjoy your health as your investment grows over time
after missing 6 quarters in a row who would beat that the 7th Q would be any differernt ?
Gyms closing down again.

I might be one of the only people on this board saying they are going to do well long term and take market share. Ops are excellent and still expanding worldwide.
"Wow, just wow. PLNT pricing in better than expected return to normalcy. They do realize that a pandemic has waves and we are 12-18 months away from a vaccine?"
"Some people seem to forget that PLNT caters to a niche. If you’ve been in a PF before you know what I mean. Not everyone likes the way they run their clubs. As long as there are gyms, there will be competitors. Trust."
I never know what to do with this stick. Bought it pre-COVID when it was close to its current price and it quickly set all-time highs. Obviously the pandemic didn’t help this one and it still hasn’t fully recovered.
so is this jumping back up tomorrow since it beat earnings... or?
Planet Fitness Cut to Hold From Buy by Jefferies today! That's the reason for the weakness.
"Have a small postion and will only add to it if we get more dips, fitness wont disappear over virus, small gyms already struggling may close giving more customers to this best of breed company. You have to look long term here, stop letting the news impact common sense decisions gyms will come back and PF will be industry leader"
"Why on earth would anyone be long PLNT? With markets soaring, why drive your car into a brick wall? This is a national gym with concentrations in Arizona and other ""hot zone states"". It is trading at a rich P/E of 51+. It also has a failed 6-month chart that failed to break to the upside on a cup pattern. If you are long, don't be a rat brain trader and hold expecting that ""hope"" is a strategy. Sell and gather yourself and look for a winner trade. Good luck to all!"
Not to mention international expansion. Enjoy the growth in this company and of course exercise in their gyms if suits your workout needs!!
"It's the bottom of the ninth inning of the recovery, folks. Vaccines are already widely available, even for walk-ups.On the call, Roundeau says -> 14.4M members at end of April.+0.9M from low at end of 2020,Still down -1.1M from last year.All adults in the US became eligible for the vaccine on April 19. All that was left at the end of April was for those at the back of the line to get their second dose. 70.4% of everyone who have pursued vaccination already had both shots. If the 29% of vaccine recipients still waiting on the second jab continue rejoining PF at the same rate as the priority group Planet Fitness may get back up to ~14.8M members by the end of May. But that will be the end of easy pick ups.They are still down 0.7 million members from peak last year - almost 4% YOY membership loss even as Covid fades into memory."
"As a employee school just started so many college students cancelled their memberships because they were moving away, give it time."
I checked out LA fitness in Cali and had to walk out. I came to the realization the planet fitness equipment is better designed and much much better maintained. Oh and dues are better at planet anyway. Clearly planet is the better option. Had to go back long today.. bought 128shares will sell when this is in the 130s
I am truly baffled
"I am no Warren Buffett, but I can tell a thriving business when I see one and planet fitness is on fire! And the fundamentals confirm that."
"Glad to see another positive quarterly report for PF. Nothing to see here except continued execution of their plan with unit expansion, growth in volume at existing locations, good expense management, margin reassurance, and improved guidance. Last month's dip appears to have been a pretty decent buying opportunity."
"Just on a valuation basis, I think this one is starting to get away. Company is growing but look at the balance sheet. Large debt. Also, lots of intangible assets and goodwill. Trading at high multiples of revenue. Also this category has high price elasticity. If they want to raise the price people will just stop going. They certainly have room to add more locations, but IDK just looking at the metrics it seems overvalued."
Can anyone tell me why in the world this stock is still at pre-covid levels? with no income is this all a scam?
Yeehaw! PLNT beat on earnings and revenue and announced 100 million dollar stock buy back. Also PLNT said under the new tax law their tax rate will drop from 39% down to 25%. I am a Planet Fitness member and stock owner.
Here are the FACTS: - 10 Billion in free cashflow- Zero Debt- Analysts price target of $100+- Makes Jeff Bezos spill his milkStay Strong. Stay Long.
Planet fitness looks fit.. especially later when people feel confident enough to go to the gym. Right now millions of people are staying home packing on pounds
CEO sells shares. Should give us a 5-10% drop.
"This is the best performer on the boards for the last 3 months! Even down days, this stock is resilient and tenacious. Some would assume it is just a fitness gym franchise, but it is the Netflix of exercise! This company is easy $122 in the next few months. Wow, those glutes look hunky!"
"This looked like a solid quarter to me. Same store sales growth of 11% is the key number. You can't ask for much better than that. EPS in-line and a beat on revenue.The outlook they gave for 2018 is the exact same outlook they gave on their previous call back in Feb. That is to say - 20% increase in annual revenue, high single digit same-store sales, and 40% increase in adjusted earnings.So how does a great outlook in February all of a sudden appear ""tepid"" in May? Probably because the analysts got ahead of themselves. But the long-run appears to be well on track."
Bk announcement yet?
I'm a member and workout often... in the last two weeks people are pouring into my club... look for much better numbers in Q2...
"I have a feeling PLNT will soon generate a Harvard case study on “How not to run a business”.Budget gym chain Planet Fitness says it was too late to call off plans to charge customers for March, and customers can cancel their memberships by visiting its locations—which are closedBased on many irate customers on Twitter, Planet Fitness may lose many of them before it can debit their bank accounts again.PLNT is soon to find how powerful a force social media truly is. Those investors who argue it’s only $10-20/ month are going to be surprised by the repercussions of PLNT’s PR blunder.Time to head back to the teens. Remember, this bloated pig never should have been trading at nose bleed valuations to begin with. Rondeau will soon discover what WS thinks the true value should be."
"There is also 1.5 billion in debt here. so for the equity to have any value, the value of the company needs to be above 1.5 billion.. it is hardly certain that this isn't a bankruptcy if covid gets worse and lasts a year or so more.."
Hi everyone. Gym owner from more than 25 years. My gym is 11000 sf. I also own a equipment sale business. In the gym sales are down 40 % from last year same month. Im getting a 5 to 2 cancellation to new sign in ratio plus silver sneakers and other seniors subscribers are not visiting the gym. It is really bad for everyone in this business. People are not going to gyms now and are not going for a while. I starting signing members without a auto withdraw pogram and getting a lot of members from pf wich is 14 blocks away from me. I have never shorted a stock but I’m seriously thinking about shorting this one.Equipment sales company is down 100 % for gyms and up 100 % for home equipment . People are investing a lot on home equipment I can’t fulfill the demand for that area.
"I cant tell you what the short term SP will do, but the PF gyms I visit in Florida have never been busier. People have had enough of living in a cave to avoid a virus that kills 2% of those who get it. If I get Covid & die, it will be living my life to the fullest, not hiding in Tin Foil Bunker. PF is different. It is a safe place to work out for the elderly, #$%$ folk, & type B-Z personalities. It is possible to body build at PF, but body builders are uncomfortable at PF. They can go to every other gym to body build, pose, jockey for monopolizing the free weights, shout ""give me one more"", slamming everything & so forth. There's only one gym for the other people, its PF. I was a serious triathlete & bodybuilder when I was young, I get what it is all about. And you can do that to your heart's content, someplace besides PF. I'm old, & there are lots of old people at my home PF. We dont have to ""muscle in"" to get a chance to use the free weights. The gym doesnt sound like a roid rage cacophony, I like that. Lots of people like that. We have lives to live, not die. If the gyms are closed down again, it will be against the will of ""We the People"". I can see lots of poor people have lost their jobs, & that may cut in to EPS for a year for so. But this is short term. I love PF for everything it is & isnt."
"How quickly is Planet's value eroding in real terms? I think we all sense it but let's hear what other real datapoints there might be. Someone on the board mentioned 18 subscription cancellations and no new subs at their gym. Does anyone else have intel to share?The CEO of Planet Fitness was on CNBC earlier this week and talked about how some of their customers were using their ""app"" to get the offsite training. How useful or robust is that compared to Peloton or others? Is it sticky?"
What are the options at this point: Go fund me page? Close locations permanently? Good luck selling equipment
Planet fitness is the blockbuster of the gym industry.
"Got in today...I hate the price, but the entire stock market is overpriced right now. To get a good growth stock, it seems like you have to overpay at this point."
"based on strictly financials this company is still extremely overvalued... also wait until the store openings slow... which they will. Revenue growth will quickly simmer, and then it will crash."
"No insider buys since March 2020 but...… here are the Insider sales since September. Everytime the stock price hits around 77 bucks or higher, I buy put options. Odds are definitely in favor of downtrend of PLNT vs. upside as long as Covid is around. 2020-12-08 Rondeau Christopher (Chief Executive Officer)Sale 42,929 75.73 3,251,227 2020-12-04 Rondeau Christopher (Chief Executive Officer)Sale 4,857 75.02 364,362 2020-12-04 Lively Dorvin D (President)Sale 100,000 73.94 7,394,499 2020-12-03 Rondeau Christopher (Chief Executive Officer)Sale 65,887 75.61 4,981,716 2020-12-02 Rondeau Christopher (Chief Executive Officer)Sale 11,400 75.09 856,037 2020-12-01 Rondeau Christopher (Chief Executive Officer)Sale 90,084 75.03 6,758,552 2020-11-24 Rondeau Christopher (Chief Executive Officer)Sale 89,890 75.17 6,757,121 2020-11-12 O'donnell Brian (VP, Chief Accounting Officer)Sale 3,672 72.46 266,065 2020-11-12 O'donnell Brian (VP, Chief Accounting Officer)Option Ex 3,672 13.48 49,498 2020-11-11 Lively Dorvin D (President)Sale 43,003 72.47 3,116,255 2020-11-10 Rondeau Christopher (Chief Executive Officer)Sale 44,953 76.48 3,438,005 2020-11-10 Lively Dorvin D (President)Sale 56,997 75.05 4,277,681 2020-11-09 Rondeau Christopher (Chief Executive Officer)Sale 150,000 81.70 12,255,300 2020-10-08 Rondeau Christopher (Chief Executive Officer)Sale 100,000 65.61 6,561,100 2020-10-07 Rondeau Christopher (Chief Executive Officer)Sale 150,000 65.26 9,788,700 2020-09-15 Rondeau Christopher (Chief Executive Officer)Sale 100,000 60.69 6,069,200 2020-09-14 Rondeau Christopher (Chief Executive Officer)Sale 150,000 57.82 8,672,400"
Earnings call sounds generally very positive for long term. More market share as industry consolidates. New owners should get favorable real estate which is there number 1 expense. Should be a big 2021-2022
Getting crushed. Just bad news all over the place with this company. Outbreak in Virginia due to PF gym exposure. Covid cases increasing all over the place. Getting sued in Georgia for charging people. Any thoughts? Dump it?
I just joined PF. I am VERY impressed. I have been going to gyms for 40 years and the value to price is outstanding. Very little to join and no upselling to the higher priced package. I see this as the best bang for your buck
55 after er???
this seems a bit excessive.
"Unless this is the end of the world, PF will be alright. If it is the end of the world, then it doesn't matter anyway. I'd like to think that there would be a much lower entry point here under the current market conditions - so the current price action is really really surprising - but then again cruise line stocks are getting way out in front of the recovery story. The market is pricing in that despite the return of state imposed gym closures, the post recovery future will have PF as a significant marketshare gainer. Keep watching - you might get that entry point price somewhere along the line in the next month or 2. The question is - when it comes - will you take it?"
Why is my gym closed in South Jersey?
huge debt. people open your eyes. they have an unsustainable business during this time...people are going to cancel they will face higher costs associated with new requirements to stay clean and revenue will fall. their debt to equity is insanely high. also people are very upset theyre making it so difficult to cancel. even during good times i would argue this company is dramatically overvalued
"I just commented on this and now it was deleted. CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN HOW THIS STOCK HAS RALLIED ALONGSIDE S&P when they’ve been closed for 2-3 months? Also, does anyone else feel that their reported new sign up figures are complete BS? HOW IN THE WORLD ARE THEY REPORTING NEW MEMBER SIGNUPS ON PAR WITH LAST YEAR? CALL ME CRAZY BUT DOESNT SEEM REMOTELY POSSIBLE"
"Any bankruptcy experts here? What's the mathematical chance factoring: cash on hand, burn rate, franchisees default rate, etc."
"you simply can not have the amount of people in there that you usually saw, say at 5pm after work-it would be impossible from a social distancing scenario----so how is that going work? take a number? reserve a time to work out? wait in line? keep in mind--every single machine or weight has to be cleaned after each use---think about your last visit to the grocery store and how long it took to check out as everything is wiped down after each user-------its a problem going forward for this company"
Did any of you geniuses read the 10 Q? Or do you just sit here pondering. Hardware sales are going to be down 50% for the next year. Everyone’s numbers are predicated on the highest possible opportunity which is still down 30% year-over-year on earnings. So you have a company trading at 80 times next year’s earnings that doesn’t pay a dividend in a questionable business that may be in a house of pain for a long time. This is where you want to speculate?
