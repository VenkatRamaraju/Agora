"great company at a good price, I'll be loading up"
And yet another story about how the Reston Town Center fiasco is playing out: https://www.restonnow.com/2019/01/18/plans-for-jinya-looking-more-uncertain-for-reston-town-center/
Boston Properties reached a 52 Week low at 106.86
"One of the Reston Town Center merchants has now filed suit against Boston Properties for its senseless and clumsy effort to introduce pay parking. Meanwhile, the boycott by area residents continues."
"Everything that was here was spam, so I've flagged it and it's gone – which means if you came to read something actually about Boston Properties, you're in luck. I held BXP shares for several years but sold them recently when I saw firsthand evidence of what I think is poor management at the Reston Town Center. Reston is about 20 miles outside Washington DC – a ""planned community"" suburb where there's never been paid parking of any kind because space has never been (and still isn't) at a premium. Soon a Metro line will serve the Town Center area, and Boston Properties has used that cover to justify implementing paid parking at Reston Town Center. Mind you, the nearby Tysons Corner area – closer to DC – has FOUR Metro stops and NO paid parking. At RTC, they installed expensive and far-too-complicated equipment requiring drivers to use a confusing and intrusive cellphone app, to know in advance which color-coded parking lot to select for which stores/restaurants and to write down their own license plate number so that if the car is lost it can be found by looking through footage of scanned plates in the garages. The ""enhanced parking experience"" also includes green and red lights above spaces to show which are open and which are not – in case your own eyes can't tell you as much. BXP claimed all this was necessary because their surveys told them people were having trouble finding places to park. As someone who has frequented Reston Town Center for more than two decades, I'm sure their surveys – if they even existed – were self-serving at best: I have NEVER had trouble finding a parking space. Confronted last summer with an outraged community of customers and RTC businesses, BXP backed off its planned introduction of the system. But they went live with it this month and Reston social media is full of locals vowing to shop and eat elsewhere on weekdays/nights. There are plenty of good alternatives where parking is free. It's unfortunate this will hurt many fine businesses at Town Center. Some have already left and others have indicated they will. BXP got this very, very, wrong and I think it will cost them dearly. That – and the fact that I didn't want to benefit from thoughtless, unnecessary greed – is why I sold my shares."

"Buying more BXP today.Adding to my position in PLD ( a leading Reit, focused onBig Box warehouses which also provides logisticaland high tech, scheduling, routing, inventory controlsystems to e commerce, transportation oriented andadvanced light assembly users). Base leasing rates forwarehouse/flex space in mid Atlantic region of USA haverisen 40% in last 3 years."
BXP is upgraded today by Sun Trust.
I believe that BPX should consider the following two suggestions to maintain its position in class A properties. First to increase security with the use of the various smart devices from a company called Artificial Intelligence technology Solutions (AiTX) and secondly with smart windows from (ViEW) state of the art for comfort and cost savings. Both of these concepts are being incorporated into various new projects as well as existing structures and venues.
We’re going to the mooooooon

"Hundreds of Reston residents took to the streets on Saturday to protest Boston Properties' tone-deaf attempt to introduce paid parking in Reston Town Center, a suburban community where parking isn't at a premium and where it's obvious that greed is the motivation. Search for Reston media stories and you'll see that opposition is strong and a widespread boycott is having a significant effect. I sold my shares in BXP last fall, unable to feel good about their inept handling of this project."

This price drop is unsubstantiated. I still believe this stock is undervalued.

"What Boston Properties is doing to the Reston Town Center (RTC) is disgusting. They have implemented a paid parking scheme and are rapidly turning one of the most vibrant centers in the area into a ghost town. The scheme can only be described as ""unwarranted and complicated"". With customers practically having to consult with legal counsel if they want to park their car. On top of that, those who do venture into RTC and attempt to use the system have found it rife with error. In fact, One man was recently erroneously charged $1000 for one hour of parking. After correcting the error, which took an act of Congress, Boston Properties still charged the man $3.00 for the parking session. This is par for the course for Boston Properties business in RTC. The parking was suppose to resolve commuters rom parking in garages but BXP has actually started selling spaces to commuters instead of resolving the issue and has driven away area customers of retail and restaurants and ruined the atmosphere, now there are usually literally thousands of spaces that sit empty after the office workers leave for the day. By the way, the office workers spaces is how they are distorting their statistics to investors who aren't familiar with the community."

"WFH is not going to gain traction. Productivity drops, period. And you end up working around the clock, you get burned out, because you NEVER actually leave work. Now, for the ones returning to work, because of pandemic, companies actually need larger space to space people out. This means more demand for office space. Long BXP, the best of the best blue-chip commercial REIT in the world."

"In the conference call, BXP admitted that it's losing a huge percentage of merchants in Reston Town Center. Why? Because BXP was utterly tone-deaf and greedy as they did something badly that shouldn't have been done at all – attempting to introduce a far-too-complicated paid parking scheme (no coins allowed, intrusive app, need to figure out which stores were associated with which garages, etc.) in a location where there are plenty of competing establishments nearby with FREE parking. Rather than learn a hard lesson and beat a graceful retreat when the community boycotted Town Center, BXP foolishly chose to double down and hire a PR crisis firm that couldn't have been more inept, telling the media that Restonians ""just need to be educated"" and then everything would be fine. Hah! Warren Buffett says that when he chooses to invest in a company, he prefers those even an idiot could run because sooner or later an idiot will. As a former BXP shareholder myself, and someone who has watched the Reston debacle unfold firsthand<, I'm not surprised that Buffett has shown no interest in Boston Properties."
Class A office space in the best business cities in the US makes for a very compelling investment at 90. Looking forward to next week's earnings call.

"$BXP has a lot of properties in it it’s pipeline, most of which are pre-leased. Collections have remained above 95%. Based on comments made during the last call they have been able to renew leases at higher rates and without cutting out of leases office space. Honestly, I think this stock remains undervalued. A lot of companies are already pulling workers back into offices so I strongly believe it will bounce back."

Great management team with exposure to CBD office and some life science properties. People will return to the office as WFH is overrated. Younger people needed to be mentored and a firm's culture weakens without employees being together to communicate and interact. Insiders have been buying@74-89
