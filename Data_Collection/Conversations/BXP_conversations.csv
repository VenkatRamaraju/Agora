"One of the Reston Town Center merchants has now filed suit against Boston Properties for its senseless and clumsy effort to introduce pay parking. Meanwhile, the boycott by area residents continues."
BXP is upgraded today by Sun Trust.
This price drop is unsubstantiated. I still believe this stock is undervalued.

Reston Town Center continues to hemorrhage due to the paid parking mistake! https://www.restonnow.com/2019/01/23/williams-sonoma-pottery-barn-set-to-close-this-week-in-reston-town-center/
"When will this stock recover and why is it performing so poorly, as are many of the REITS? Is it just the pandemic effects?"
Boston Properties reached a 52 Week low at 73.63
"Yes, a lot of tech CEO's believe working remote is NOT going to work. FB is one company allowing its employees to work remote, remember, that only applies to small % of their workforce. FB doesn't speak for anybody else.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-forever-big-tech-divided-151926990.htmlAt these prices, BXP is a steal. I'm buying. Thanks Covid-19."
I believe that BPX should consider the following two suggestions to maintain its position in class A properties. First to increase security with the use of the various smart devices from a company called Artificial Intelligence technology Solutions (AiTX) and secondly with smart windows from (ViEW) state of the art for comfort and cost savings. Both of these concepts are being incorporated into various new projects as well as existing structures and venues.
"WFH is not going to gain traction. Productivity drops, period. And you end up working around the clock, you get burned out, because you NEVER actually leave work. Now, for the ones returning to work, because of pandemic, companies actually need larger space to space people out. This means more demand for office space. Long BXP, the best of the best blue-chip commercial REIT in the world."

"great company at a good price, I'll be loading up"

"When vaccine comes out end of year, where do you think this stock will be at? Buy now, collect dividend, sell OTM call and wait for that inevitable price jump for the capital appreciation. Why buy FANG when you can get paid waiting. BXP is not going anywhere but up in the long run."

"$BXP has a lot of properties in it it’s pipeline, most of which are pre-leased. Collections have remained above 95%. Based on comments made during the last call they have been able to renew leases at higher rates and without cutting out of leases office space. Honestly, I think this stock remains undervalued. A lot of companies are already pulling workers back into offices so I strongly believe it will bounce back."

"BXP is collecting nearly all their rent so I don't really get why it continues to drop. If it hits 80 again, I'm buying more for long term."

"Yikes! In a weird way this drop is ok as long as they keep their dividend because you get more shares through DRIP.With that said this was supposed to be a safer stock, what was I thinking! Sometimes the safe stocks aren't as safe as you think, that is why I buy mainly small caps and microcaps, they're just as risky, but they go up A LOT more.I should've bought more STOR/BIP/CWEN, oh well let's go BXP!"
The most volatile REIT ever?
"I've been looking into shorting commercial real estate, an have any input on how to do this. like how would you go about it. there's no instrument, or contract how would I do this"
Class A office space in the best business cities in the US makes for a very compelling investment at 90. Looking forward to next week's earnings call.

Does anyone know whom they leased Boston lord and Taylor Bldg to. ? They announced done deal on call but not whom
Great management team with exposure to CBD office and some life science properties. People will return to the office as WFH is overrated. Younger people needed to be mentored and a firm's culture weakens without employees being together to communicate and interact. Insiders have been buying@74-89
