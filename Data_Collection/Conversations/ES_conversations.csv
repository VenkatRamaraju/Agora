"After reading about this company on Morningstar, I decided to short this stock. Looks overvalued based on the fundamentals. Historical average P/E ratio is about 15, the current average is about 22. This stock is trading at nearly 30. Compare that with Consolidated Edison (ED), a company in the same sector, which is trading at a P/E of 21. If you own this stock you should consider ED instead, a very similar stock for a much cheaper price with great upside."
