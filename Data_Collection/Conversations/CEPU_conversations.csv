Central Puerto reached a 52 Week high at 4.02
"Argentina stock rebound needs the market to go up, which it did yesterday (6.45%) and the currency to stabilize, which it did yesterday (strengthening from 62 pesos to 1 usd and now 58.25 to 1). Today should be a great day for CEPU"
"Is anybody alive out there? Making new 52-week highs constantly and this message board is deader than dead. Probably a good sign, all things considered."
"Thank God for the Argentine socialists. If it wasn't for them, there would be no cheap value stocks left in the world, ie. CEPU, LOMA, CAAP, etc."

What happened today?
This is a 3x by Christmas. The most undervalued stock around

"On September 3, the Argentine stock market / Merval was at 23,000 and today it is at 33,000. CEPU has lagged, but when the elections occur on October 27, the government will likely pass energy subsidies for the people increasing consumption. The infrastructure is worth way more than the current market cap of CEPU. Is there any reason why CEPU shouldn't be flying up double of today's price? I cannot think of one"
What could CEPU go to in the next 2-3 years? Looks like it has been as high as 17 in 2018.
Still profitable after a horrendous economic downturn in Argentina. Decent job!

"Though there is a lot of pump and dump articles on this stock, it is still a great long term value stock. Energy will be crucial all over the world to make all electric cars drive.Besides, when there are new elections in Argentina and this stock is aloud to pay a divided, it will boom."
New 52-week high
I think its really underestimated
Earnings looked good.
CEPU really starting to heat up now.
CEPU starting to show some real strength now. I'm long and strong. Would not shock me at all if this were a $20 stock in a few years.
Crazy volume today
Sold all my shares after holding for two years. I agree the election outcome can make a difference to this stock. I am still waiting for SUPV and BMA to recover. They have been down since they last election.

Wow what a bounce
"If the company sold its assets, it would be worth substantially more than current market cap. Good earnings. To reconstruct it’s infrastructure, it would cost billions. Should triple in market cap. Shorts will get destroyed"
"What are the thoughts on earnings? Seems like business as usual here, still cheap. Price/EBITDA around 1.5, P/B of 0.5..."
Soooo much value
despite the seeking alpha pump and yesterdays epic late day dump (volume about as high as ever on US side)I like this one as a long term buy and holdshould show some nice percentage gains
ex dividend on 02.12 ?
"Long... spectator, finally in @ $2.80 pre-election and earnings .. I'm in on TGS as well"
"Plus Argentina stocks rebounded yesterday and Cepu didn’t, which has no explanation and will cause stock to fly higher"
Buy Buy Buy. $4.15 is a good price.
"Nice financials this year, going more green the right way. Wait for the coronavirus to be gone and this is going to go to the 10's"
Central Puerto is down 8.07% to 3.53
Good volume and nice jump. It seems that it's trying to break out.
this stock will go up to 4 by October
This should trade much higher. Good P/E and lot of future.
