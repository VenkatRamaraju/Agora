CEPU really starting to heat up now.
"On September 3, the Argentine stock market / Merval was at 23,000 and today it is at 33,000. CEPU has lagged, but when the elections occur on October 27, the government will likely pass energy subsidies for the people increasing consumption. The infrastructure is worth way more than the current market cap of CEPU. Is there any reason why CEPU shouldn't be flying up double of today's price? I cannot think of one"
"I'm still long. Bagholding from 2,6."
CEPU starting to show some real strength now. I'm long and strong. Would not shock me at all if this were a $20 stock in a few years.

"Is anybody alive out there? Making new 52-week highs constantly and this message board is deader than dead. Probably a good sign, all things considered."

Earnings looked good.
Sold all my shares after holding for two years. I agree the election outcome can make a difference to this stock. I am still waiting for SUPV and BMA to recover. They have been down since they last election.
