"On September 3, the Argentine stock market / Merval was at 23,000 and today it is at 33,000. CEPU has lagged, but when the elections occur on October 27, the government will likely pass energy subsidies for the people increasing consumption. The infrastructure is worth way more than the current market cap of CEPU. Is there any reason why CEPU shouldn't be flying up double of today's price? I cannot think of one"
