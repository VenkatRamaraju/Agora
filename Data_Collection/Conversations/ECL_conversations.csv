What will happen to the Ecolab stock price after Ecolab Inc.'s upstream energy business merges with Apergy Corp next quarter. Ecolab shareholders will receive stock in the new company. Will Ecolab's share price drop when that happens?
"No layoffs for ECL, but instead they are hiring hundreds of workers to keep up with demand for sanitizing products. BIG earnings coming soon folks. ECL is a very good company"
Insiders sold at highest.Analysts are clueless about calculating a ball park figure for results.Shareholders pay the price.
"On my strong list to short. Great company though, stock price just too high."
ECL reached a new 52 Week High at 147.78
Amazing stock! Steady growth and excellent management. I see big potential here once restaurants start opening up their stock will increase along with their customer base!
"Ecolab... the classic American business story. Step 1. Build an awesome company, with huge growth, based on superior products, innovation, great service and fair pricing.Step 2: Become so big that growth becomes hard to deliver to wall street under the weight of massive middle management and corporate inefficiencies.Step 3: Start overcutting bottom line resources, shedding valuable assets and people to meet Wall Street expectations with declining top line growth.Step 4: Upper management further disconnects from valuable information trying to bubble up from the remaining good employees left.Step 5: CEO who eviscerated the company, departs as a superhero because he delivered such profitable growth for so many years, leaving an unstable house of cards ready to fall. With no bottom line left to cut and no clear vision of turning it all around it is a matter of time for the house of cards to come crashing down."
Appears that maybe someone big is on a buying binge
"Would at least (1) analyst inquire about $/rep sales?!!? You want larger volume increases; then reduce sales $ responsibility. Get institutional reps below $750k/year in sales, and the gain growth will increase. Any rep over that is going to have a hard time growing, AND maintaining service to current accounts!"
Can anyone explain why ECL June 12 290 Call has such huge volume and open interest?
Cleaning and sanitizing services should go through the roof once businesses reopen. If retailers and restaurants ever hope to reassure customers their establishment is safe they need to be sanitizing more often - as customers will demand it.
"Yeah.........this ""is"" overvalued.........by quite a wide margin.........don't really know why ?? should be about half of this pps............Oh well........"
Anyone got any idea about the stock exchange with Champion X?
What does one of the weklthiestmen in the world know that we do not know? Bill Gates recently purchased 1.7 million shares of Ecolab. Could it be he is anticipating a sharp increase in the industrial industry thanks to the Trump corporate tax reduction. Is he buying because it is a safe investment? Or is he primarily interested in Ecolab's soliid dividends and interest income? It is pricey but I am seriously considering buying some shares.Certainly he knows something we are not comprehending.
"I see the Ecolab commercials on TV frequently now. I do not see the point of wasting millions on a very vague commercial that somehow tries to connect Ecolab, a company many have never heard of, with hotel and restaurant sanitation. This because they also clean hospital operating rooms. I guess this type of wasting money makes sense to the C level. Here is a better option, restore the salaries that you cut of your most experienced techs!"
With restaurants and hotels ready to open and restrictions lifted we will see an improvement in Ecolab's business and stock price!
"Ecolab has severe internal morale, middle management and personnel problems. This downturn may just be market related. There is a much bigger storm coming for Ecolab unless Doug and his boys club start to correct sales stifling policies. Disclosure:I was a former employee. Disgruntled? No...better off now. Slightly bitter at the way they treat their sales people? Definitely."
I worked for the company. Decisions are (completely) driven by Wall St which is not okay. Not here... itâ€™s ended up hurting long term profitable planning. I think my stock will be stagnant for 2019-2020.
I have been a shareholder of Ecolab for the last 15 years. my cost basis is around 53 and when I started purchasing Ecolab there PE was 29. needless to say I have experienced good growth and good dividends being a long investor. this is one stock I have never felt the need to worry about or second-guess my investment. there negative movement yesterday was a surprise on the cuff of what I felt was a very positive news release. I say surprise but no worries. short investors need to stay home
"How many times has Ecolab missed projections before Covid. The retail, restaurants took a 19% hit which they got lucky that some of that was covered with 22% in hospitals with the sanitizer. They also spun off Champion."
