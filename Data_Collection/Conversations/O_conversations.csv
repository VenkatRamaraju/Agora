does anyone know if O dividend decreases to reflect lost earnings from merged company?
"guys need help on this. If we get 1 share for every 10 shares of ""O"", Then I should exercise my CALL option (expire Dec 17) before Nov 2 in order to get 10 shares. Am I correct ? pls advise, thanks"
Realty Income reached a 52 Week high at 73.48
why is O bullish today? because of the merger?
Iâ€™m glad I bought the dip. This is now a buy and hold forever stock for me.
There may be some volatility in Realty Income Corporation stock in November as the merger and the office properties spin-off occur. This occurrence is to be expected.
"Folks, Dis heeaa is a ""BUYERS MARKET""! Do you'll see all dat dar dippage?!? Even E-COINS had dippage!HeeHaw HeeHaw! Be prepared for ""AVERAGING DOWN"" like dd says, HeeHaw HeeHaw! Finally dat dar comment can be used appropriately! HeeHaw HeeHaw!"
I'm a newbie I want know I got 10 shares of O don't understand how many shares will. after Nov 3
Great day to be a shareholder.
"Thank god I bought my first position (30 shares) at 73.03, even if it falls down to 67 its a great REIT to hold for the LT"
"What is everyone buying this week in the market?At least for me, I'm just going to sit back and watch the market this week. Sitting on some cash right now, but can't seem to find any bargains. My portfolio has been pretty steady recently, but then had a big run on my largest two holdings last week and so I was up about $250,000 last week - but don't think that trend will continue. Holding some cash right now seems like a prudent decision, especially if I can buy more stocks on market downturns."
"@dd, dude today is an excellent day for your ""AVERAGING DOWN "" in NLY since it's dropping like a rock after earnings report, no? LOL!"
Would it be safe to assume that the addition of the VER properties and the spin-off of the office properties is already priced in and will not cause a significant movement in the price next week. Assuming no other news.
Do we know how much the new spinoff stock is going to be per share? And will this reflect in the O share price?
If I only own 2 shares would it be better to sell before the spin off or buy 8 more shares so I receive 1 share of the spin of company. I bought this stock @ 68.20 back in May.
"I want to make sure I understand this: after the merger, we still keep our Realty Income stock but we also receive 1 share of the new spin off company ( Orion) for every 10 shares of Realty Income that we own?"
"For whatever reason, my browser is having trouble accessing the homepage. Is the spinoff going to be a taxable transaction ?Thanks in advance."
"Wow, Zero is having a terrific day and is up about $2.50 per share early this afternoon. I don't see any major news for the large increase, so perhaps people are sticking with REITs as a possible hedge against inflation. In any event, enjoy your profits today"
Bought 500 shares 6 years ago at average price of $42/share in an IRA. With dividends reinvested I now have 682 shares. Company is a rock solid gem and long term shareholders will continue to be rewarded.
