Conversation
Here is the typical O buyer driving to his trailer in Alabama.
"Hey Brad, keep predicting the Disaster/Armageddon/Crash.You have to be right eventually, don’t you?"
Thanks for cheap shares!
"Michael Burry (from the ""The Big Short"") is selling O stock hand over fist.A crash is coming in October for this mall stock. All the best, Brad."
"O reported earnings of 33 cents for the recent quarter. That's an annual $1.32 earnings per share.Meanwhile they are paying out $2.80 per year in dividends. Anyone can see that's not sustainable.This stock is just a Ponzi scheme. All the best, Brad"
"We sold O fist over hand. Anybody who buys O now will get fisted.I recommend that you get into technology, which is where the real growth is now. All the best, Brad"
"Inflation concerns? Hedge against inflation and unpredictable market, BUY some ""O"" stock. Proven dependable dividend and SP stability with gradual growth. Get in now before the merger is completed later this year. Don't miss out on the SP POP!"
"Sid, if you're not sure who owns the malls then you are holding the 0 bag. O stands for the low-income malls that they own. Everything is open air vacant retail space. No wonder the fake Brad uses the word deluded to mock you. Did you smoke too much laced pot as a teenager?"
"What, no update on O in positive territory? Or update on NLY DOWN today from the usual TROLLS SDB, DD, or Brad_the_LIAR_Expert?"
Brad seems to be a Communist based on the photo in is picture - so who is your Vladdy?
Dam what a ride at the end! Great time to buy in (it normally floats at 66 - 68) really excited to see what the after hours hold! See yall on monday and enjoy the weekend. If your down (you know what to do) HOLD! If your up congrats on getting in so low :)
I saw the stock got upgraded to a buy I guess you buy on bad news and sell on good news
O's malls are closing due to the Delta variant. No rent is being paid
"Folks, from me to you CONGRATS! All week long thousands of you have been BUYING ON THE DIPS! Lots of really really SMART Folks who bypassed the TROLLS on this page! HeeHaw HeeHaw! Great job on such astute buying practices! HeeHaw HeeHaw!"
Bought 1000 more shares today.Added to my PLD position too.
Brad not sure who owns the malls you are dreaming of but O stands for the 0 malls that they own. Everything is single tenant free standing or open air. No wonder the true Brad uses the word deluded to mock you. He is dead on with that reference. Did you smoke too much laced pot as a teenager?
Good morning folks! Hope everyone is having a good week in the stock market so far. What is everyone buying this week? Yesterday I picked up a few more shares of ALX at about $266 and then a micro-cap stock that yields about 6.5%.
They had some interesting insights about O on (http://Stocks-tracker.com). Definitely made me think twice about the company.
"Ok, so they keep paying .23/share every month, but report about $1.20 annually in earnings. The rest is ROC???? What?"
"NLY looks RED to me, no? Anyone else see Red $-.02? HeeHaw! HeeHaw!"
"Mornin Folks! I'm here as your friendly neighborhood Buffoon to tell you the obvious again. HeeHaaw HeeHaaw! O is down today, HeeHaaw HeeHaaw! I like playing Capitan Obvious! I'm hoping that all of you are not astute enough to notice that the market is down over 2000 points. HeeHaaw HeeHaaw! I need you' ll to think I'm a smart Buffoon! HeeHaaw HeeHaaw!"
looks like slow bobs at work flipping burgersthey won't let him use his phone there has to keep his eyes on the french fries
"The fake Brad used to want to buy real estate in South Carolina, but he has no money and is bankrupt.So he became a LYING Expert. Now he post lies about REITs but still has no money. All the best, the real real REALLY real Brad."
This has drastically underperformed the market for sometime. What is the issue here?
Not again! Now this stock is down another $1 this morning! I told you all it was too expensive trading at 14 times sales.
"VNQ pays a much smaller dividend and pulls a small expense fee as well. And their top 10 holdings are what I would call the Cramer high flyers that are stalled out for the most part. O is acquiring VER which is going to boost their growth and become accretive to earnings within the first year. So you’re apt to see stock appreciation plus the dividend. Buffett owns a lot of STOR and that’s not in the top 10 of the ETF either. I would split my money 3 ways and buy thirds of the REIT, O and STOR. And make sure to stick with 100 share lots so you can sell covered calls on your positions to make extra. If your under 40 and not looking to be so conservative yet, I’d spend just a third of my money here, then another third with ARKK and third with IHI. Much more growth and a nice balanced approach."
"Hhhhhmmmm, I make a mistake about a decimal point, and a board troll feels vindicated, about what exactly? Hhhhmmm, O's insider ownership is .16%. However, the LIE of omission from Slow Dumb Bob is he failed to inform everyone O's peers insider ownership. Example, WPC 1.05% and STAG . 15%. So obviously, there's nothing abnormal in the REIT industry. This Buffoon, Slow Dumb Bob, efforts to defame O by portraying O as a deficient company has yet failed again REIT industry norms bears this out."
this thing is like a rocket ship ...only goes up
"I've been wanting to buy, but think recent price was too high so I'm waiting. Its come down a bit. I'd like to buy in the low 60's, but wonder if it will go that low. What do you think is a good strike price?"
"@dd, Let us know when NLY's SP gets to $69 with a $2.83/share dividend."
Thanks for the Dividends today 
Added 10 More shares
I have held this stock for over 5 years and am down over 10+% now. After 5 years!
"Hope everyone is having a good week in the market. Heck, even Zero is up today in price. Still sitting on my large $32,000 dividend payment for this month and am going to stay in cash with those funds - just in case there are any buying opportunities next month. Gotta run and do some work for a local charity this evening, but I'll be back next week giving out more rock-solid advice!"
"Realty Income Corporation is a Standard and Poor's 500 scam index ""Dividend Hoax"""
Just bought my first 12 shares at 68.5
"What's going on! Down 6$ this month, but the dividend is juicy!! Should I sell??"
"Hhhmmm, NLY closed STILL DOWN. While O jumps to over $72! Yaaaaaaa!"
"With just a basic review of the fundamentals, you'll clearly see that Zero is overvalued. Here are the Price to Sales ratio for Zero and some other large real estate companies, although not all of them are triple-net lease.Zero - 14.27NNN - 11.50WPC - 10.91FRT - 10.50VNO - 5.28KIM - 8.67ALX - 6.28NNN is probably the most comparable company as they have a similar model and are trading much lower at a Price to Sales ratio of 11.50. VNO is not very comparable, but you can see how much lower they trade at Price to Sales and they may be worth a further look for my personal portfolio. Hope my analysis was helpful, although I know a few of you still struggle with basic grammar and spelling."
"Folks, if you haven't noticed yet, I AM A BUFFOON! I whine about O's stock price going down in a downturn of the market which has lost over 1,500 points. I'm sure there is no correlation (look, I used a big word thar, HeeHaaw, HeeHaaw). How could there be? HeeHaaw, HeeHaaw!"
Great time to buy!!!
I'm LIVIN IN DD's head RENT FREE! HeeHaw HeeHaw!
"Fortunately we got all of our subscribers out of this laggard at 72.50 the week before.We recommend selling now to avoid further losses. All the best, Brad."
"So O declares dividends on a quarterly basis, but distributes them on a monthly basis? Is there a benefit in monthly distributions?"
I have enough. Not picking up anymore shares right now
"Juice dividend date coming in 4 days , big cover I hope. Juicy!!!"
no recovery when the market moves up 1000 points suffer greatly when the market moves sideways
"While Zero and ALX clearly have different business models, there are reasons I favor ALX now, even though there is more risk with the company. Based on their Prices to Sales ratio (per Yahoo), O trades at 14.88 times sales - a pretty high number. ALX trades at 6.58 times sales (rent), which I consider a very modest level. However, O is pretty well diversified with thousands of properties and ALX owns only 7 properties.I hope this explanation helps some of the novice investors on the board."
"Good afternoon folks! At the present time I'm not long or short Zero, so you can trust my independent analysis on the company. Just looked at the balance sheet and noticed as of June 30, 2021 the company has over $9 billion in debt. That is a lot of Zeros. I'm not buying shares again until the price really drops and they get rid of some of that debt!"
"dd, peddling a failing stock called NLY. It's an MREIT dealing in mortgages. Gee, I wonder what would happen if interest rates were to go up? Oh I don't know, Stock Depreciation? If you look at NLY's 5 year chart it has dropped from $12.50/share to about $8.45/share today. If you think that is something, the dividend dropped from $.30 cents/share to $.22 cents/share. Guess what, the FED expects to raise rates in 2023 but it could act SOONER. What does that mean for NLY? Crash, Crash, Crash. LOL. I'd rather own O that has been paying dividends since the 1960's and has been increasing dividends since then. $2.83/share/year from O is much more than $.88 cents/share/year than NLY, No? Don't be a dd and fall for the ""Yield Trap"" of a declining company and stock like NLY."
$O swing to $BRT pronto.
"Thank you O for the $47.20 today, it was used to purchase some WSM to add more money to 11/26"
69 again I'm shocked
third week in the row this stocks at 67enjoy your dividendFord motor company no dividend but has doubled for me which would you rather have fact that goes nowhere but pays a small dividend there's better things out there look around
"Someone just told me that at a yield of 1% the stock price of O will be $283/share. That's a good thing, right? All the best, the real real REALLY real Brad."
"Hi Brad, Im still adding on weakness and dripping my dividends...It is a very boring...thoughts on this plan?"
Anyone knows if O shareholders will have any stocks from the new spin-off? Thanks
"Glad I was able to take everyone on this board to ""school"" last week and teach you all the importance of Insider ownership of stock. Hopefully I'll be able to do some more teaching next week on investments. Glad to be of service to everyone here."
"Please feel sympathy for fools like me. I never bought O because I don't understand how it works.O is in the business of making investors like Sid rich. All the best, the real real REALLY real Brad."
So the stock dropped $1.32 on Friday...big deal. To everyone that buys the stock you just bought a $1.00 bill for $.98 cents! congrats :)
n l y up on the opening and going up much higher the big o down on the open with merger problems coming who knows what it'll drop to maybe 59 bucks e a p h holding steady that's your morning update for you bozos on this board hahaha have fun today I will got to go boating on the Gulf of Mexico hook up with you later
here's a good question why the big drop today all of the reads seem to hang in there except for the Big o why did it drop today anybody got an answer
"We buy O fist over hand. Anybody who buys O now will get rich.I recommend that you get into REITs, which is where the real money is now. All the best, Brad"
Folks - let's get serious about investments this week! What is everyone buying in the next couple of days? Any good bargains out there now?
"How is everyone doing this week with the big market sell-off yesterday? My portfolio is holding up pretty well and just added a few more shares of ALX today. Their current yield is 7%. Google is buying a NYC office building for $2.1 billion, so I still think office properties in the city will remain very valuable and ALX is a smart way to invest a small portion of my portfolio."
"Any good investment ideas out there now? I'm expecting to receive $32,000 in dividends this month and need a good place to invest the money."
"GOOD NEWS! According to Yahoo EAPH is up 9,900.00%!!!! The bad news is the price is STILL just 0.0001"
"O doesn't really own any malls then and I have been a fraud.I lied about the holdings on their balance sheet. BUY. All the best, the real real REALLY real Brad."
bad start for the beginning of the week but the dividend pays $3.93% and the one year Target is $77 I see this baby dipping down back to 69 as slow Bob would say buy the dips and make some big bucksgiddy up folks
"When interest rates raise this place will be at ghost town , the p/e ratio is insane , good luck holding, I'll go to a CD"
"Nice day in the market with the Dow up 65. Give me a ""thumbs up"" if you enjoy all of my great posts!"
"this stock's going to drop like a rock after earningswith another round of lockdowns runs not being paid in time contracts being broken for leases this all can't be good watch out we're going to 59 real soon then I would think of buying some of this company dividend then would be a little higher not the cheap 4%, I'm used to much higher dividends on 4% many stocks out there that are above 4% good luck with the 4%"
Was the dividend supposed to be paid yesterday?
"It looks like the October Death Spiral for O has started earlier in September.This would be a good time to bail out before you lose even more money. All the best, Brad"
"I detect desperation on this board. Tell me again where these so-called malls are? Weird I’ve never seen Walgreens, 7-11 or Dollar General leasing mall space. I can’t wait for the analyst upgrades after the VER deal is consummated. You should close your short positions soon."
here's what slow Bob calls a dip and a buying opportunity y'all jump in now go get them folks
I’m glad I bought the dip. This is now a buy and hold forever stock for me.
Here's an O investor waiting and waiting for his tiny monthly dividend
Brad like I told u long ago SRG owns most of the decent malls but your pcp brain is fried. You obviously think you are getting under my skin but I am all smiles as my long term investment is doing just fine. Your ranting may possibly sway 1 or 2 uninformed people a year. It’s not bending anybody else. You ought to call David Butterfield in investor relations if you need someone from O to explain why their method works. He is very competent as is all of the O office. I only hope you’re not short this stock. To pay interest for a short position on a stock that is so steady hardly seems like a sane strategy. Anyway hope you find what you’re looking for.
"It is tough to run with SDB and all of my predictions on stocks, but let's run with the my $2M that I've made in the market the past few years. I make money like Fort Knox!"
this might be because of interest rates creeping up
dd careful comparing junk to quality. NLY has debt/equity ratio of 472 and O is just 75. And NLY is not growing and actually showing decreasing revenues which explains their low PE. These 2 stocks are polar opposites. If you like risk and are convinced residential real estate is on solid footing then you should be OK. But if they have to cut the dividend then look out below. Merrill does not cover them or I’d give u their take.
Hey Minnie! I'd like to wish you and yours a very happy Columbus Day!
"Ken and John relax and stop looking at the nonsense on this board. O is in perfect shape and smart growth fully intact. No stock goes straight up. Look at the 6 month chart and that’s about what you’ll see again when you look 6 months from now after the VER acquisition and office spinoff or sale. Also FYI interest rates rising won’t hurt O in fact more often than not REITs go up with rates. And guaranteed there will be more shares issued to help pay for VER. O uses a formula of 2/3 equity and 1/3 debt for every acquisition which has always worked despite the naysayers ignorant comments on this board. VER isn’t coming for free but there will be immediate profits as O refinances VERs debt at a lower rate and can eliminate duplicate staff. All this takes time. Consensus targets around $78 in 6-12 months while you earn a dividend. This stock is conservative. If you’re an aggressive investor, find a riskier growth stock. If you’re preserving wealth, this is the place to be."
Is the 3.99% dividend paid monthly?
looks like slow Bob's got a day off from flipping burgers congratulations young man good job relax and play your video games today
"Folks, I just did a quick check here on Yahoo and the insiders only hold .16% of all shares. This is much less than 1% of the company. If they have faith in the company - why don't they own more shares??? Please let's discuss in a reasonable fashion. In comparison, insiders own over 13% of PSA - very high quality company."
Should I own O as my default REIT investment or am I better off with an ETF like VNQ for a long term investment?
The Para-Olympics are in full force now and love to see our Brad and DD out there on the field! Keep up the good work you guys!
"@dd , Who died and left you god over all to determine who is worthy of anything? I don't recall any elections placing you as god or president of this board to dictate what can be said and who can say it."
We doomed here?
VICI Properties just entered into an agreement to acquire MGM Growth Properties - for a nice premium. It looks like the good REITs are getting buyout offers now.
"What does next week hold for Zero? I'm not sure, but the past two months have certainly not been pleasant at all."
I'm looking to open a position but that PE of 66 is keeping me from buying. Can anyone tell me why a PE of 66 is justified right now? thanks in advance.
NLY debt $65B. O debt $9B. Stop comparing junk to a dividend aristocrat. To each his own but this isn’t a competition. I like to sleep at night. Merger problems? Highly doubtful with O’s skilled team. Merrill loves the acquisition and placed $78 target. Does that sound like a problem? Bark up another tree. Why would anyone short a high quality REIT in a recovering economy?
"Folks, I'm flabbergasted! I am totally lost for words to paint O in a negative light. It's been recovering nicely from the dip to $65. Who woulda thunk? I know I didn't because I never learned how to think. I know how to deceive and lie through , HeeHaw HeeHaw. Dat dar is my specialty! HeeHaw HeeHaw! Read my gibberish and fail in investments, JUST LIKE ME! HeeHaw HeeHaw!"
"@dd, Tantrum MUCH?"
"Folks, your hero SDB has done it again - I've reached the $2M mark in my brokerage accounts with my investing acumen in the past couple of years. Currently trying to buy more shares of a REIT that should be liquidated in the next year or so and have 20k shares. Would like to buy more if they are available at the right price. Today, picked up more shares of a royalty investment that will pay me 10% for the next number of years and will be a buyer of more shares in the next few weeks. It's all good here!!!"
"There is now a refrigerated truck parked at every O mall. This makes disposal easier.If you didn't get vaccinated, head down to your local O mall and get in line. All the best, Brad"
"Today the market has now turned positive, but shares of O are down. It will be interesting to see if this trend continues."
Hope everyone has a nice Friday! And hopefully everyone can have 20% returns this year in the market!
"O literally prints money every month, and lays golden eggs for the shareholders! Hurray!They have the secret sauce, and a dividend machine that prints the money. All the best, Brad."
"NLY is down today! Like it usually is. Has been for the past 10 years. Take my advice, if you own it, sell it and move over to O. I consider NLY it an insult paying a paltry $. 88 cents / share /year. What a slap in the face from a depreciating stock!"
"I'm just gonna occasional add shares and drip the dividends. Waste of money, right Brad?"
take my advice sell the stock today before it goes back to $69 you'd be a big winner you pick up two bucks and a 4% dividend whoopee-doo
"OH NO! O MISSED ON EARNINGS!The earnings do not cover the dividend. Another CUT in the dividend iscoming. All the best, Brad"
Zacks upgrades to buy and pegs 2021 earnings at $3.57 a share. Dividend around $2.80 a share so that’s less than the 80% payout ratio that Merrill gave me. News just keeps getting better and better. After earnings several targets raised to the $76 to $78 range. But oh yeah it’s a scam and all these analysts are just completely wrong. NOT.
"Folks, I was crying a few days ago about ""How can I get a thumbs down...."". The real question is why isn't anybody giving me ""thumbs up"" for the lies and deception I pour out here daily. HeeHaaw... wait.... WAAAAAAA!"
"Today's lesson is on insider ownership, as I love stocks that have a high percentage of insider ownership. It shows they have faith in the company and forward looking share value. All figures listed below are per Yahoo.Public Storage (PSA) the self-storage giant lists 13.56% owned by insiders. Great job!ALX, the owner of the flagship Bloomberg Tower on 731 Lexington Avenue lists a whopping 58% owned by insiders.Realty Income (ticker symbol Zero) lists a paltry .16% of shares owned by insiders. That sure does not give me a lot of faith when insiders own much less than 1% of the company."
"Folks, I's sold O back in March for $63/share. That was my stupidity showin through and through. I told yo'll to sell, stupidly, like me! HeeHaw HeeHaw! I's whines bout O's performance today (Like Brad_the_DumDum_Expert) because I's is angwy yo'lls is up over $8/share since MARCH! HeeHaw HeeHaw! Don't be a ""stupid"" and read and head the worthless words I type up here! HeeHaw HeeHaw!"
"I have a theory. It says that a slight majority of people in the United States, if tested, would be found to be at least slightly developmentally disabled. I present this message board as evidence, & rest my case :)"
"Most of O's malls are now closed, due to the rapid spread of the Delta variant.Another dividend cut is expected, since people aren't going into these Covid malls. All the best, Brad."
99.4% of tents collected. .6% defaulted by Brad.
"Are you guys kidding about SDB? I think he is 12 years old and his primary income is from his newspaper route. He is cool overall, but like his research."
"Due to the financial problems and vacancies at O's malls, another yield cut is expected.They will cut the yield to 1%. Try living on that. All the best, Brad."
O continues to turn lower and lower quickly approaching may lows WHY!
"Started a position in O today at 65.73. Here are my reasons:Highest quality dividend Aristocrat.Company is taking over VEREIT for added growthCompany expanding internationallyCompany will spin off office properties in 2022Price is at 200 day Moving AverageAlways buy when a good company is on sale. COVID-19 scared a lot of people away from REITS. This company is overwhelmingly involved with ""essential businesses"". If it goes to 64, I will load up the truck, then borrow my neighbors truck and load it up too.Just my two cents."
"Good afternoon Folks, I'm here again to say something inane because I have nothing else to do. Taaaadaaaaa, I'm Capitan Obvious, here to inform you about the OBVIOUS! O had a down day! No other stock in the stock market has ever had a down day! Stocks go UP each and every trading DAY! HeeHaaw! HeeHaaw! Don't let anyone tell'ya differ! HeeHaaw HeeHaaw! Is knows its alls. Time to get back to smellin my own flatulence! HeeHaaw! HeeHaaw!"
"The price to earnings ratio on this stock is 72X, and there is no growth . . . .The only reason for that is people are desperate for a tiny yield. All the best, Brad"
"I started positions in O and BXMT as hedges against inflation and another possible round of COVID Delta lock downs (thank you China, Dr. Fauci, and the NIH). Also in TIPS until inflation is looking done... if truly transitory. Other than a few small positions in spec stocks am sitting on a wad of money waiting for the next long overdue correction. I keep getting an itchy FOMO trigger finger but have to believe there is a day of reckoning soon with all the Congressional spending and Fed tapering/rate increases. Current inflation rate is 5.5%... if that continues to run hot... watch out!!"
For income investors just hang in there this stock raises dividends quarterly (+0.02 a year) and may have a spinoff next year which will also pay a dividend (As its a REIT).O is still a great company just dropping a little (but rising a little today)
That guidance is going to put this in the mid 70's pretty fast.
Why is this tanking so much recently??
sold off some O today.....dividend yeild getting to low.
So is O still paying monthly dividends? And if so what is the date they pay each month?
"Since some here (aka dd) are ignorant on how the YIELD is calculated, here is a quick class. YIELD = Dividend ÷ Stock Price. Example: O's YIELD is 4%. The equation looks like this .0403 = $2.83 ÷ $70.15 . NLY's YIELD is 10.62% The equation looks like this .1062 = $.88 ÷ $8.28. Those of you with a brain (not you dd) can see through these equations that in NO WAY does it show NLY's dividend is almost 3x that of O's dividend. Ignant folk forsake education and attach themselves to simple likes NLY's YIELD of 10.62%"
"We are buying TSM shares hand over fist. Now have 800,000 shares.Profit from the semiconducter boom with TSM! All the best, Brad."
Anybody know how to unmute someone?
"O is experiencing serious financial problems at their malls !This stock is now in a Death Spiral that will take it down to $10. All the best, Brad."
BYE!!
I was thinking about starting a position here at next support level $57. Seems people think it will go lower? Any ideas? At $57 that's a 5% divy and monthly payouts into other stocks but not a good plan as interest rates go up huh?
This stock is going to run back to 69 - 70 just give it 1 - 2 weeks
"We got our subscribers out of this laggard mall stock last week at 72.50.We are buying technology stocks fist over hand now. All the best, Brad."
"Right now the Dow is up 277 points and Zero is down almost 1%. This is what I call the ""Pineapple Upside Down Cake"" with the stock. Just glad I own other securities and not this one at the current price level."
"Hope everyone is having a good week in the market with the Dow up about 600 points today. Most of my securities are doing well and are holding up just fine this week. Zero is having a flat week so far, but there is always tomorrow! ALX was a good purchase in the mid 250's. Have to run now and do some volunteer work, but I'll be back tomorrow for stock discussions."
"O's malls are anchored by Dollar Store and Dollar Tree.The customers can only afford cheap plastic merchandise. This is why they are in low income areas. All the best, Brad."
"Another tidbit but with O it all adds up. 2nd Qtr rents were 95.9% paid. July rents were 99.4%. So assuming that holds for the 3rd qtr, then that’s a 3.6% rental increase. Of course when they gobble up and spit out VER, the end product is much more exciting. Nothing fast either. Just their steady as you go style. Brad laughs at the dividend like it’s nothing but when the stock appreciates another 6% a year for the next 3 years, then you’re talkin 10% annually, and if you sell calls at strategic times (hopefully peaks), you easily make another 3-5% annually. Selling calls the safest move you can make when you own stock. Bryn Talkington talks about this strategy occasionally on CNBC. A guaranteed 10% a year owning safe dividend stocks and selling calls. I will reiterate from a post back around January that O has the highest credit rating of all REITs according to Merrill Lynch and their stats on REITs are no joke. Brad has every right to sell this stock short because nothing ever goes straight up, but to always have to demean the company and it’s knowledgeable investors is just so lame. Look I like staying long and picking stocks that go up and selling calls to lock in profits and or generate extra income. It’s a time proven strategy and I sleep very well at night. If you have the temperament for shorting, best of luck to you but stop with the nonsense on this board. If it hits a technical high at some point then chart it for us like Carter does on CNBC. But calling it a scam is so hopeless. Or listen to Bill Joel’s song about the angry young man and change your approach to life. Cheers"
"With much thanks to Brad, going to run about $10k to my local charity for food, clothing and shelter. We thank him so much for his great comments tonight, much appreciated. Always a team effort here!"
It'll be interesting to see how the naysayers twist themselves into pretzels trying to turn a good report into a bad one. Free entertainment!
Is this a mutual fund?
"Whoa! This stock is down a buck thirty five today, so almost 2% in total. Not a good day for Zero shareholders!"
Yea so i feel like anytime O's starting yield dips below 4% just wait... sometimes it will be months but patience is key.
"Great news everyone! Just got off the phone with Brad and he told me he's been invited to participate in the Special Olympics this year. Not sure what events yet, but this is fantastic news for him!"
"What is going on today? The Dow is up 465 points right now, but Zero is down .40 cents. Guess people just don't like the low dividend of 4.26% right now. After taxes and inflation, there is nothing left!"
Good entry point
"Folks, looks like we have a Dead Cat Bounce today - but don't expect it to last long !!!"
"I used to be a real estate developer in South Carolina, but I failed and went bankrupt.So I became a REIT Expert. Now I write stories to help REITs raise money. All the best, Brad."
I’ve been watching this go up for months. Is now the time to buy or? What’s the reason for the dip guys￼?
Where did everyone get to this week? Maybe everyone is trading stocks and making a lot of money in this market! Picked up a nice REIT earlier this week at a decent price.
"Sorry, but you're not gonna get rich on a 3.9% monthly dividend.Only the CEO and his cronies are getting rich off your cheap loan. All the best, Brad."
Hope all my friends had a great weekend! Over the weekend I read Barron's and then went to see a Harry Potter movie at the theater.What stocks are people buying this week?
Inside ownership copy and paste statement again by Brad_the_REIT_Expert and the fake SDB.
Zacks downgrades to SELL and pegs 2021 earnings at $1.32 a share. Dividend around $2.80 a share so that’s more than the 180% payout ratio that Merrill gave me. News just keeps getting worse and worse. After earnings several targets lowered to the .76 to .78 cent range. But oh yeah it’s a scam and all these analysts are just completely right.
"It's August 12 we officially learn if the merger will happen today and if the spinoff will happen...No matter what you all picked thanks for voting. I hope its a ""YES"" and we can get a nice spinoff company and reap more dividends from another company"
"Michael Burry (from the ""The Big Short"") is buying O stock hand over fist.A dividend raise is coming in October for this great stock. All the best, the real real REALLY Brad."
I just realized it went down and it's break even. That's poor.
Just wanted to share another photo of DD and Brad on their honeymoon.
Why is this chat forum filled with the biggest loads of #$%$ Anyone have actual real thoughts about O going forward?
"Folks, I may be gone over the weekend to attend my annual Mensa conference, but will try to post as time allows for all of my dedicated followers on this board. Thank you all for the support."
watch out this stock's about to tank
"I put in a limit order for 3000 more shares at 70 pre-earnings. I was thinking today was my lucky day, but even in a down market day, this company shines."
"As I posted 3 weeks ago, the price dropped and my GTC order for 3000 shares was filled today at 69.76. I won’t buy any more unless we see a major pullback, which is a strong possibility with the current tool loving in the White House.Good luck longs."
"@dd, like how NLY has been dropping like a rock for the past 10 years SP wise and Dividend wise?"
"Well! Well! Well! The share price of Realty Income Corporation was up today, Thursday, August 26, 2021, when the Dow Jones Industrials, the S&P 500 stock index, and the NASDAQ Composite were all down today. What does everyone have to say about that fact?"
"Running events start today with Brad and DD. Go go go, and love this action now!"
Since dd deleted his post here’s a reminder. NLY 5 year chart is down 21.49%
"Yawn!!! Historically, the stock market generally is volatile during the months of September and October. I will allow the worrywarts to sell at ridiculously low prices, just as they did in in late February and much of March of last year (2020). I never will forget how a bunch of people panic sold during the market plunge on October 19, 1987. The economy did not go into a depression. By January 1988, the stock market was recovering and enjoyed ENORMOUS gains over the next few DECADES!"
"Just not sure I want to et into a commercial REIT when so many companies will reconsider their expenses on office space...Add the rates going up, lack of stimulus money going into the markets...I'll sit on the side-line and watch for a dip to buy in next spring."
Why has this been hit so hard lately??
"The share price of O normally drops immediately after earnings, so I am patiently awaiting buying more to add to my position."
With monthly you get your dividends a little faster and the stock won’t fluctuate as much on ex day as it would if they were paying 3 months worth. Bit it really doesn’t matter.
Hope nobody shorted based on the faulty yahoo payout ratio. The actual patio straight from the Merrill analyst who covers this stock is 80%. That sure makes a lot more sense than 292% which is absolutely erroneous and if true would certainly not belong to a stock that is hitting new highs.
It's true what they say - the view from the top is fantastic! The market is really up today and my massive dividend payment this month will be put to good use!
What’s going on here? Why the sharp sell off this week?
Oh no! Down over $1 today. I'm starting to get nervous for some of the longs here. Perhaps they should have bought ALX and enjoyed the current dividend rate of 6.85%.
Realty Income Corporation is a Standard and Poor’s 500 stock index “Dividend Aristocrat”.
"@John, wow you've owned O for over 5 years and are down over 10%? I jumped on O back in Jan of 2018 and again in March 2018 for a cost basis of around $51. LOL! According to Broker I'm up over 24% at current price level. Dude what happened?"
I wouldn't jump into soon on this stock you got October coming up the worst month for the stock market if it takes a hit guess what the Big o does too hold on for a while
"We sent an alert out to all our subscribers advising them to GET OUT OF O at $72.50.We also shorted it at 72.50, and Cha-ching! we have another easy profit. All the best, Brad."
was hoping to get cheaper shares but earnings seem good so up the price goes
"My auto-set order is still in place... ease in some @4.5% yield, buybuybuy @5% yield or more. Trim @75, dump @80. It still works...."
"It's time to back up the truck on this company. Well, the Dump Truck! You will thank me my friends!"
"Last week, we got our subscribers into Palo Alto Networks and Crowdstrike, just in time before they exploded higher.Technology is the future, not these vacant mall stocks like O. So what if the dividend is 4%. All the best, Brad"
"Wow, amazing how nice this board is once you mute/eliminate the redundant trolls."
"O's yield is an amazing 4% per month. That works out to a 48% annual yield !The way they fund it, is they sell more stock. O-O-O it's Magic ! All the best, Brad."
"We got out subscribers out of this garbage stock at $72.50 a few weeks ago,Now that the Death Spiral has started, we see O falling to $40. All the best, Brad."
this is what a stock chart looks like
"A typical O mall has: 1) a 7-11; 2) a Dollar store; 3) a Goodwill store; 4) a tattoo shop; and 5) a menudo stand;These types of malls are for low-income people, which is why they are low rent. All the best, Brad."
"SDB really delivered a knockout punch to me too while I was hanging on his jock strap, the stench from it knocked me out for 3 hours, LOL! Amonia couldn't awaken me from that knockout blow! It took 4 Liters of Oxygen/min and intubation to bring me back around!"
Just got a photo sent to me by Brad. He and DD are remodeling their new house and this is part of the new bathroom they just renovated.
"September and October each year historically are the most volatile months for the stock market. This year is no different. Apparently, many people did not learn their lessons from the stock market plunge that occurred in late February through much of March of last year (2020). Of course, numerous people panic sold during the stock market plunge on Monday, October 19, 1987. Of course, the stock market has made enormous gains during the ensuing DECADES since that time."
Good afternoon folks. Just got home and noticed the sharp decline in the stock price of Zero this afternoon. Looks like the good old 60's will be back again soon.
"In fairness to all parties involved here now, we have a false comment by Brad stating that insiders of Zero hold 16% of shares. It's simply not true - as Yahoo states they own .16% (much less than 1%), so I think he will correct this comment. Perhaps he was not wearing his glasses tonight."
sold this stock 5 years ago at $69where is it at now oh still in $69
Scooping up some bargains today with my large dividend windfall for the month! It is nice to be sitting on some cash when the market is down and there could be a lot more bargains later this month.What is everyone buying today? I'm looking at a few small community banks that are trading
