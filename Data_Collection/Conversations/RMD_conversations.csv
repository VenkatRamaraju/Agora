"Somebody taking profits? (And I mean institutional investors) The last week has been tough and my stop losses kicked in - but, I am back in. I am hoping we will soon see the slow daily rise again. I stand by my earlier statements ... there are are only two public manufactures of CPAP machines. And one of them has a massive recall. I want to feel bullish, but last week has me a little spooked."
Phillips revealing the toxic foam in their CPAP machines is the story today of ResMed's rally.
"Going back to $110+ by March, great growth year over year. Long term holder. JMO"
Anyone think this stock will do a 2:1 stock split soon like it did in 2010 and 2005?
"I recommend reading the transcript also. I'm impressed with the considered, thoughtful delivery and the outlined 5y strategy from this CEO. I like a 5y strategy... but I doubt I'll hold this stock for 5m.You never know if there's more pain to follow after a 20% cut but it seems to me that cut reflected mostly how fast this SP has come up and not issues with the company long-term. This may be ride lower for a little while but in a few months I'm thinking I'll be happy I bought this now.Some of these medtech stocks are high flyers. Last year I bought Penumbra after a 15% drop on earnings and sold it a month later up over 20%. I sure wish that happened every time! Good luck to longs only."
Another great quarter. This company is on a long steady year after year of growth.
Just a constant up-slope for RMD. One of my best performers! I assume there will be unwarranted selling when earnings is reported. I'd like to know how long their extra market share will last due to the Philips recall? Anyone know?
"Article on CBS NEWS,""Sleep apnea sufferers frustrated over CPAP machine recall"" dated Sept 6th. Phillips says it will replace or repair devices within approximately 12 months .... once the FDA approves a solution. Again slow continuous rise with low beta."
"Hello everyone ! Cramer said to buy this couple of months ago when it was $95 and I watched it run up to $115 and now back to 103 due to market sell off, assuming this market sell off comes to an end at some point what price would you say its a good buy ? maybe $95ish, thank you and Merry Christmas !"
Make your case.. no matter what ..Resmed is a screaming buy
Sleepapnea market used to be a duopol market before the recall. Now it is a monopoly game with only one participant. On the side line perhaps FPH will benefit. Time will show
"Gonna scoop 100 at open. 20% down friday on a rather small rev miss but with earnings being up. Company acquired two other companies thus why the minor miss. I dont care about any 5 dollar swings, ill get a dividend, and price will climb back fast before next earnings. For dividend collectors, good value here now that price has deflated, next ex divi on feb 6th, so youll want to grab it before then. For shorters: downside probably limited to another dollar or two, make sure you pull out before any rebound and then play the 99-105 range."
"Slow continuous rise with very low beta. Let's look at the facts. There are only two major CPAP manufactures: Phillips and ResMed. According to an old article from 2020, Phillip has a 62% market share and ResMed has a 33% market share. In mid-June 2021, the market leader initiates a recall of their CPAP machine due to cancerous foam used in sound suppression. That means there is only one real CPAP manufacturer left - which means from my perspective ResMed now has 95% of the market. ResMed of course cannot keep up with the demand. Phillips has not indicated how they plan to remediate the problem. I only see ResMed going up. Financials are stable and debt is below assets. Look at the graphs starting in June 2021 and ask yourself - WHY AM I NOT IN ResMed?!?!"
"while everyone is focused on the fatality rate, flattening the curve and eventually pulling out of this nightmare, many are missing the bigger picture here. a sizable percentage of coronavirus patients are requiring critical care including invasive ventilation, often for weeks at a time before recovering. the world average seems to be holding at around 5% of the total confirmed infected population. many of these recovered patients will be facing chronic lung issues requiring the very types of treatments RMD supports. as this virus rolls across the globe doing its damage in what could easily be 3 phases over the next 18 mos it will unfortunately leave millions of recovered victims requiring supportive respiratory therapies for the rest of their lives. additionally, governments around the world will be stockpiling everything from masks, to gloves to other PPE materials, as well as CPAP, vents, etc. no one will want to be unprepared going forward and ignoring this now clearly known and measurable threat would be politically unwise in the extreme. demand for these products and the money to procure them will be built into national budgets for years to come. this is a massive growth opportunity for a company doing good in the world and investors focused on the wrong things will miss it"
"Generally, but with exceptions galore, when a stock goes down this much and closes near its day's bottom, there is more pain ahead. But, I hope this would be one of the exception cases. As someone mentioned, with such a big run up, there is bound to be profit taking at the slightest hint of bad news, not to mention that people may prefer to be in cash with so much uncertainty around trade deal, govt. shutdown, worldwide economy slowing, etc."
Going back to $300 plus.
"based on trade sizes, looks to me like funds are moving in ahead of earnings. upgrades will follow once the big money has taken significant positions. meanwhile rmd continues to outperform broader market on a relative basis. call it whatever you want, safe haven, growth, possibly even turning into a momentum play at some point soon. the market has been slow to appreciate the full impact and long term implications of this pandemic, but it is fundamentally changing the landscape for the foreseeable future. many more chronic respiratory conditions around the world will require long-term care. and all nations that can afford to do so will stockpile as never before because none will want to get caught flat-footed again."
Amazing how few posts there are on this board ! It's a great stock.
